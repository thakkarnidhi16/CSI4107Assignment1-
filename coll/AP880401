<TEXT>
   The leader of the August coup attempt
that almost toppled the government of President Corazon Aquino
escaped Saturday from his prison ship in Manila Bay, the military
announced.
   A statement said Col. Gregorio ``Gringo'' Honasan fled at about
2:30 a.m. Saturday (1:30 p.m. EST Friday) aboard two rubber boats
along with 13 other people, including some of his guards.
   Chief of Staff Gen. Renato de Villa ordered a massive search for
the 39-year-old Honasan and alerted subordinate commands nationwide
to be on the lookout for him.
   The charismatic former colonel had been detained on the navy
ship since his arrest last December in a Manila suburb.
   Col. Oscar Florendo, chief military spokesman, said a reserve
lieutenant who was frustrated over his inability to obtain a
regular commission had aided in the getaway.
   Florendo said the boats used in the escape had been sent to
increase security after the military learned of a plot to free
Honasan.
   De Villa immediately relieved the commander of the vessel, the
RPS Andres Bonifacio, and ordered his arrest, Florendo said in a
radio address. He appealed to the public to provide information to
help recapture Honasan.
   Honasan, former chief of security at the Defense Ministry,
played a key role in the Feb. 22, 1986, mutiny which triggered the
popular uprising that toppled President Ferdinand Marcos.
   But Honasan became disillusioned with Marcos' successor,
President Corazon Aquino, accusing her of ``weak and inept''
leadership that fortified the 18-year-old communist insurgency.
   On Aug. 28, Honasan led a force of 2,000 men who attacked the
presidential palace and seized several media and military
installations in the capital before they were driven off by
pro-Aquino forces.
   The coup attempt left 53 people dead and wounded hundreds, and
Mrs. Aquino said it was aimed at killing her and her family.
   Honasan's effort was the most serious of several major plots to
unseat Mrs. Aquino's government.
   Military sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the
former colonel was so popular that he had become the ``dominant
figure'' aboard the ship which was supposed to be his prison.
   ``It is with sadness that the AFP (Armed Forces of the
Philippines) makes public the unfortunate escape from custody of
ex-Col. Gregorio Honasan from his detention,'' Florendo said in a
statement. ``During a normal inspection of the ship, it was
discovered that subject detainee together with his guards headed by
Lt. j.g. Gerardo Mojica and 12 enlisted personnel were found
missing.
   ``Initial investigation revealed that Honasan was apparently
assisted and joined by his guards led by Lt j.g. Mojica ... It is
believed that bribery was a factor that led to the betrayal of
their oath and sworn duty.''
   Florendo said de Villa had alerted the military to take
precautions to ensure that Communist rebels did not take advantage
of the confusion to launch ``terroristic actions.''
   The spokesman said troops were being deployed around Manila to
search for Honasan.
   Florendo said the military received information a week ago that
Honasan would try to escape and it sent rubber boats to guard the
ship.
   He said the military expected outsiders to try to storm the
vessel but ``instead it came from the inside.''
   Honasan was security chief of the Defense Ministry when
opposition Sen. Juan Ponce Enrile was minister of national defense.
Enrile was fired in November 1986 after the government said it
thwarted a coup attempt by his followers.
   Honasan remained in hiding for months after the August coup.
Brig. Gen. Ramon Montano, commander of the National Capital
Regional Defense Command, said weeks before the arrest that Honasan
was being protected by undisclosed civilian and military figures.

   Stock prices rallied after two days of consecutive
declines in Tokyo Saturday, boosted by favorable prospects for the
new trading week, traders said.
   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the Nikkei Stock Average of 225
selected issues, which lost 156.04 points Friday, gained 177.90
points, or 0.68 percent to end the week at 26,282.12.
   Participants appeared optimistic about the market situation next
week, although many of them sidestepped trading in the absence of
direction, said an official of a major securities firm in Tokyo,
who spoke on the condition of anonymity.
   He attributed the lackluster trading to the Easter weekend
holiday observed in other Asian markets.
   Share prices were mixed with the volume of trade in the first
section totaling 520 million shares during Saturday's half-day
session.
   Popular issues were major chemical, steel and metal. Automobiles
and machineries also rose. Department store, some construction and
foostuff shares lost ground, traders said.
   The Tokyo foreign stock exchange market is closed on Saturdays.

   The United States is sending about 1,300
additional military personnel to Panama to improve security for
American bases as well as U.S. civilians living there, the Pentagon
said Friday.
   The move was being taken ``in view of the growing unrest and
tension'' in Panama, and should not be read as an indication of
``some kind of military action on the part of the United States,''
the Pentagon said.
   However, CBS News reported Friday night that the Reagan
administration was ``considering a plan to overthrow'' Panamanian
strongman Manuel Antonio Noriega, although the network said no
decision has been made and the Pentagon opposes such a proposal.
   There are already more than 10,000 U.S. troops in Panama.
   While many of the troops to be dispatched are military police
and other security specialists, Army helicopter units also are
being deployed to the troubled Central American country, the
Pentagon said. The deployment will begin next week, the Pentagon
said.
   The move comes just one week after the Defense Department
completed a buildup that had already doubled the number of security
personnel guarding military bases in Panama. It also comes four
days after Panamanian troops marched on a Panama City hotel,
confiscating the tapes of four U.S. television networks and briefly
detaining several American journalists.
   CBS News reported Friday night that the Reagan administration
was considering a proposal, advanced by the State Department
earlier this week, ``to overthrow Noriega by triggering a new
political crisis'' which would require the dispatching of two
infantry brigades, or 8,000 combat troops, into Panama.
   No decision has been made, the network said, noting that such a
plan is opposed by Secretary of Defense Frank Carlucci and Adm.
William Crowe, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.
   The Los Angeles Times reported in Saturday editions that
Secretary of State George P. Shultz and Assistant Secretary of
State Elliott Abrams proposed a series of actions, including
kidnapping Noriega to bring him to the United States for trial,
landing more than 3,000 troops in Panama in a show of force and
using the CIA to organize a military coup.
   The newspaper reported that the proposals had been advanced at
high-level meetings, and that the kidnapping plan, which startled
other officials, had been shelved as unworkable. But the idea of
fomenting a coup remained under consideration, the Times said. The
CIA has prepared a draft presidential authorization for limited
covert action against Noriega, the newspaper reported.
   Pentagon officials who demanded anonymity told The Associated
Press late Friday that the decision to send the additional troops
came after a lengthy _ and vociferous _ debate within the
administration.
   The sources confirmed that the State Department had urged the
president to send an even larger contingent of troops to Panama,
but that Carlucci had counseled greater caution.
   The sources refused to say whether the State Department wanted
extra troops in Panama to mount a military operation directly
against Noriega, or rather thought there was more of a threat to
Americans in the country.
   State Department spokesman Rudy Boone said there was no comment
on the CBS report. ``We have nothing on that,'' he said. White
House spokesman Ben Jarratt also said he had no information on the
report.
   The Pentagon denied any plans to send more troops into Panama.
It described the upcoming troop movement as part of a continuing
effort ``to enhance our security posture there.''
   ``The instability of the current situation in Panama; the
heavy-handed tactics of Noriega in dealing with the situation, and
the potential for increased threats to U.S. citizens and interests
in Panama make this deployment essential at this time to ensure the
continued safety of U.S. personnel and facilities.''
   The Defense Department's prepared statement did not elaborate on
who or what would be protected. But a ranking Pentagon official
said the troops ``will not be restricted to providing security at
our bases.''
   ``They will be able to go where they are needed to protect
Americans,'' said the official, who requested anonymity.
   ``This action is consistent with the Panama Canal Treaty and is
a reasonable and prudent effort to further safeguard the canal and
U.S. lives, property and interests in the area,'' the Pentagon's
statement said.
   The Pentagon said the buildup would be gradual, with the first
contingent of troops leaving the United States next Tuesday.
   ``This augmentation of U.S. Southern Command's security forces
... is expected to be completed by Friday, April 8, 1988. Further
deployments will depend on circustances,'' the statement said.
   The units being sent to Panama include an Army battalion of
military police; a reinforced company of Marines; three Air Force
Air Base Ground Defense Units; two additional guard dog squads and
an Army aviation task force, the Pentagon said.
   The aviation unit will include seven AH-1 Cobra helicopter
gunships along with 15 UH-60 Blackhawk transports and four OH-58
Kiowa observation copters, the Pentagon said.
   ``The aircraft are to provide rapid transportation and highly
mobile protection for the security forces if necessary,'' the
Pentagon said.
   The U.S. Southern Command, which has its headquarters in Panama,
had about 600 security personnel among the 10,000 servicemen
assigned to it before the United States stepped up its campaign
early last month to oust Noriega.
   Over a 10-day period that ended on March 24, the Pentagon
dispatched another 670 security personnel to Panama for the stated
purpose of protecting military facilities.
   Besides the servicemen assigned to the Southern Command, there
are about 13,000 military dependents in Panama along with another
1,300 U.S. employees of the Panama Canal Commission and their 2,600
dependents.
   The Pentagon said Friday that Crowe, the Joint Chiefs chairman,
had recommended additional security personnel be dispatched to
Panama ``in view of the growing unrest and tension.''
   Carlucci and President Reagan subsequently agreed and the order
was given, the Pentagon said, adding the deployments should not be
read as portending ``some kind of military action on the part of
the United States.''
   ``It is simply a prudent move to enhance security,'' the
Pentagon said.
   The Defense Department said the Army MPs would be drawn from
Fort Meade, Md., and Fort Bragg, N.C., while the Army helicopter
unit would come from the 7th Light Infantry Division at Fort Ord,
Calif.
   The Marine company will be dispatched from Camp Lejeune, N.C.
The Pentagon said it was not prepared Friday to say where the Air
Force ground defense units would deploy from.

<HEAD>Contracts Sought By `Several Dozen' Production Companies</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Production companies responsible for such
programs as Johnny Carson's ``Tonight Show'' have opened direct
talks with the striking scriptwriters' union rather than wait for
their own union to end the walkout.
   Several dozen production units formally notified the Writers
Guild they want to bargain, Guild spokeswoman Cheryl Rhoden said
Friday.
   Among those are Carson Productions and the Academy of Motion
Picture Arts and Sciences, which hopes to gain a few days of help
from the scriptwriters before the Oscar awards ceremony is
broadcast April 11.
   The Guild's 9,000 film and TV scriptwriters went on strike
against the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers on
March 7, seeking higher residuals and greater creative control.
   Some of the companies seeking a contract include members of the
alliance, Rhoden said.
   ``We are compelled by law to bargain with them if they notify us
that they want to,'' she said. ``These are companies which
represent some projects that need to move forward immediately, or
they could lose it.''
   Alliance spokesman Herb Steinberg said the talks were
potentially embarrassing for the writers. ``It will result in some
writers working, while others are still on the bricks,'' he said.
   Steinberg and Rhoden said that both sides are far apart and that
there is no immediate prospect of returning to the bargaining table.
   Meanwhile, representatives of the striking radio and TV
commercial actors belonging to the Screen Actors Guild and American
Federation of Television and Radio Artists prepared to talk with
negotiators representing advertisers.
   The two sides will meet under the auspices of a federal mediator
in New York on April 6.
   The actors went on strike March 21 seeking more compensation
from commercials shown on cable television and rejecting a
management bid to eliminate a cost-of-living clause from their
contract.

<HEAD>Historic Three-Master Raised from Murky Waters</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Salvage crews used three giant cranes to hoist a
114-foot sailing ship from the murky waters of Boston Harbor in a
delicate operation some feared could destroy the historic square
rigger.
   The 80-year-old barkentine Regina Maris was successfully
refloated on the second attempt Friday, 11 weeks after it sank at
dockside in 30 feet of water.
   ``The knot left everybody's stomach'' as the ship came up, said
David Kenny, field superintendent of Cashman Co., which raised the
ship.
   An early morning effort to lift the three-masted ship with
cables around its hull was halted out of concern that one of the
cables could damage it.
   ``With a ship this age and it being a wooden ship, we were
concerned that if it wasn't lifted uniformly ... we would pull one
of the lifting cables through the ship, so it was important that we
lifted it evenly,'' said Jim Frye, managing director of the
vessel's owners, Marina Bay of Quincy. ``It was a little dramatic,
to say the least.''
   Debris cluttered the deck and hung from the rigging, but the
Regina Maris was free of visible damage.
   The $50,000 operation to refloat the ship took six weeks of
planning, Frye said.
   While in dry dock, the Regina Maris will be examined to try to
determine what made it sink, he said. The ship sank Jan. 15 in
subfreezing temperatures.
   The Danish-built former cargo vessel also has been used as a
training and research ship. The owners plan to turn the vessel into
a floating restaurant, said Frye.

<HEAD>Sandinista, Contra Fighters Warily Greet 60-Day Truce</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A group of Contra rebels, armed and
uniformed, huddled in front of a wooden shack in an isolated
mountain village. Nearby, Sandinista troops meandered down winding
dirt roads.
   Warily, they greeted the 60-day cease-fire that began Friday.
   ``We are waiting,'' said a rebel leader known as Comandante
Ernesto. ``We want a truce. This cease-fire is the first step
toward peace.''
   Ernesto chatted with a group of Contras at the edge of a small
hamlet nestled in Nuevo Segovia province along the winding Coco
River, which farther north serves as the border with Honduras.
   Several children in tattered rags chased each other. The rich
smell of coffee brewing on a wooden fire wafted in the damp morning
air.
   ``We want to work, to live in peace,'' Ernesto said.
   His bodyguards, armed with rifles and grenades and wearing
U.S.-made camouflage uniforms, appeared jittery, a bit nervous.
   The unexpected cease-fire agreement was reached March 23 at the
end of a three-day meeting between Sandinista and Contra leaders.
It seeks to end more than six years of war.
   The heaviest fighting has been around here in La Vigia, about
120 miles northeast of Managua, and in other parts of the
mountainous north.
   ``The agreement came as a surprise,'' said Ernesto, 24. ``We
heard about it by radio.''
   The warring factions put a truce into place on March 21, the
first day of the talks. But there were several violations reported
by dissident Contras oppposed to the cease-fire.
   Ernesto repeated comments from other rebels that they will not
lay down their arms.
   ``Never,'' the rebel leader said. ``That's all we have.''
   The agreement does not mention the laying down of arms. It calls
on the rebels to move into still-to-be determined zones during the
next two weeks. Talks between the leaders are to continue until
June 1 in an attempt to forge a lasting peace.
   Ernesto said he joined the Contras six years ago, fleeing from
his home in San Rafael de Norte, about 100 miles north of Managua.
   ``It was because of the lies the Sandinistas told,'' he said.
``We still don't believe them, but we want democracy.''
   About a mile down the road and throughout the countryside,
heavily armed Sandinista troops roamed. One soldier, toting a
Soviet grenade launcher, said the area had been quiet for the past
few days.
   Several troop trucks rambled along the bumpy, rock-strewn roads.
Atop several knolls, 122mm cannons and anti-aircraft guns rested at
makeshift posts in the north.
   Along the winding Pan American Highway, scores of villagers
walked in Easter processions Friday, praying for peace.
   ``We have to have peace,'' said an elderly woman. ``We just want
to live and work in peace.''
   A Defense Ministry spokesman in Managua said there were no
reports of truce violations.
   Banks, government offices, stores and most restaurants are
closed until Monday for the long Easter weekend. Managua's three
newspapers stopped publishing over Easter and many Nicaraguans took
off for Pacific coast beaches.
   With most offices closed for Good Friday in predominantly Roman
Catholic Nicaragua, there was no comment from the government on
President Reagan's signing into law of a $48 million, non-lethal
aid package for the Contras.
   It will probably be two or more weeks before the rebels begin
receiving supplies under the new legislation.
   U.S. aid to the Contras ran out Feb. 29 after Reagan failed to
secure additional military aid from Congress.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said in Washington
Friday, ``There certainly is an urgent need among the (rebels) for
medical supplies, food, clothing, the basic commodities of life.
This bill is very welcome in that regard.''
   Under the March 23 accord signed by the government and the
Contras, the Sandinistas will grant freedom of expression and
amnesty to political prisoners and will allow Contra leaders a role
in the political process.
   For their part, the Contras will go to the cease-fire zones and
accept only humanitarian aid from a neutral organization, such as
the International Red Cross.

<HEAD>Pope Carries Cross in Re-creation of Jesus' Walk to Crucifixion</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ROME (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In the Colosseum, where tradition says ancient
Romans threw Christian martyrs to the lions, Pope John Paul II
symbolically retraced Jesus' walk to his crucifixion. The pope
carried a black wooden cross.
   Heading a torchlight procession in Friday night's ceremony, the
Polish-born pontiff wore a white skullcap and gold-trimmed cape
over a white cassock.
   Vatican Radio and Italian state-run television carried the event
live and people gathered by the tens of thousands to watch the Via
Crucis, the Way of the Cross ritual that ends the saddest day of
the Roman Catholic year.
   Television said the spectacle was beamed to 27 countries on five
continents.
   John Paul pressed the cross, which weighed but one pound, to his
forehead as he marked the 14 Stations of the Cross representing the
physical suffering and mockery Jesus endured on his way to death.
   The stations include the three times Jesus fell under the weight
of the cross, the placing of the crown of thorns and whipping by
jailers.
   The pope began the walk inside the Colosseum, climbed the
cobblestone steps and ended at the Roman Forum, the ancient meeting
place of the leaders of Rome.
   Thousands read from prayer booklets illuminated by candlelight
as the procession took place.
   The pontiff earlier in the day heard confessions from 11
pilgrims and tourists in St. Peter's Basilica, a Good Friday
tradition he began during his first Easter Week as pope in 1979.

<HEAD>USDA Plans System to Trace Chemical Residues in Pork</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An Agriculture Department plan to require the
identification of hogs so that illegally high traces of drugs in
their meat can be traced back to the farm has the support of a
national consumer group.
   Ellen Haas, executive director of the Washington-based Public
Voice for Food and Health Policy, said in comments filed with the
department this week that the proposal is in the best interest of
consumers.
   ``Improved methods to control and monitor dangerous chemical
residues in the swine supply are sorely needed, and this measure
will help meet this demand,'' she said.
   The proposal was announced a month ago as part of a program to
strengthen USDA's inspection and monitoring of pork for illegally
high traces of drugs, particularly sulfamethazine used to treat or
prevent swine disease. The drug also has been used as a feed
additive for many years in low doses to boost weight gains.
   A stricter monitoring program already has been put into effect,
and the identification proposal is said by USDA officials to be on
a fast track for approval.
   The proposed rule would require all swine in interstate commerce
to be individually identified by a tag or other approved means, and
producers would have to maintain appropriate identification records
on each animal for two years.
   Ms. Haas cited USDA records for 1987 showing that levels of
sulfonamides as a group _ which include sulfamethazine _ exceeded
Food and Drug Administration maximum levels in 4 percent of the
total samples.
   ``But in certain states, the problem was dramatically worse: in
North Carolina, the violation rate was 10.2 percent; in Alabama, 8
percent; and in Georgia, 7.8 percent,'' she said.
   According to department figures cited by Haas, violation
percentage rates for sulfonamide residues in pork tested in 1987
included these states of origin:

the 1988 honey price support at an average of 59.1 cents per pound,
down 6 percent from last year's level.
   Actual honey support prices will vary between about 48 cents to
62 cents per pound, depending on the color or class of honey
offered by producers, Lyng said Friday. The price supports will be
carried out through loans on honey stored on or off the farm.
   Under the 1985 farm law, honey supports are being gradually
reduced. Last year's average loan rate was 63 cents per pound and
the 1986 rate was 64 cents.
   Lyng also said the 1988 program will retain the ``marketing
loan'' provision to help reduce inventories held as surplus by the
department's Commodity Credit Corp.
   In earlier years, producers could redeem their honey only by
paying off the full amount of the CCC loan, plus interest. They had
the option of not repaying the loan at all, allowing CCC to assume
ownership of the honey which had been offered as collateral.
   Consequently, because of large supplies and low market prices,
CCC inventories of forfeited honey increased rapidly.
   But since the 1985 law, a honey producer can take out a loan and
then repay it at the prevailing market rate. In effect, this allows
the beekeeper to sell honey to the government at a specified price
and then buy it back at a lower price.
   Currently, producers who obtained price support loans averaging
63 cents per pound for 1987 honey can pay off the loans at 34 to 40
cents per pound, depending on quality.
   Lyng said the lower buy-back rates ``will be established at
levels that will minimize loan forfeitures, reduce honey stocks and
storage costs, and maintain the competitiveness of domestic honey
in U.S. and export markets.''
   
   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Cigarette use per adult expected to decline
again this year after a 2 percent drop in 1987, says the
Agriculture Department.
   ``Domestic cigarette consumption is likely to decline this year
because of further price hikes, continued antismoking activity, and
increased restrictions on where people can smoke,'' the
department's Economic Research Service said Friday.
   Consumption averaged 3,201 cigarettes per adult last year, down
from 3,274 in 1986, according to the preliminary figures. That was
the lowest since World War II. The peak was 4,345 cigarettes per
adult in 1963.
   Officials caution that the figures measure the average
``disappearance'' of cigarettes among those 18 years and older,
including smokers and non-smokers alike. It is used to show changes
from one year to another and does not indicate actual use among the
smoking population.

   The Reagan administration, expressing concern
about the safety of Americans in Panama, has decided to dispatch
another 1,300 military personnel to the troubled Central American
nation.
   Among the units being ordered south is an Army aviation task
force that includes helicopter gunships.
   The Pentagon announced the decision to increase the number of
troops in Panama late Friday evening ``in view of the growing
unrest and tension'' in that country. The deployments are to begin
Tuesday and be completed by April 8.
   The move was recommended by Adm. William Crowe, the chairman of
the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and approved by Defense Secretary Frank
C. Carlucci and President Reagan, the Pentagon said.
   Administration officials who demanded anonymity said the State
Department had wanted to send even more troops to Panama, but that
Carlucci had counseled caution.
   The Los Angeles Times reported in today's editions that
Secretaru of State George Shultz and his assistant, Elliott Abrams,
had proposed a series of stronger actions, including kidnapping
Panamanian strongman Manuel Antonio Noriega to bring him to the
United States for trial, landing more than 3,000 troops in Panama
in a show of force, and using the CIA to organize a military coup.
   The newspaper reported that the proposals had been advanced at
high-level meetings, and that the kidnapping plan, which startled
other officials, had been shelved as unworkable.
   But the idea of fomenting a coup remained under consideration,
the Times said. The CIA has prepared a draft presidential
authorization for limited covert action against Noriega, the
newspaper reported.
   CBS News also reported Friday night that the administration was
``considering a plan to overthrow'' Noriega suggested by the State
Department earlier this week. The plan would require the
dispatching of two infantry brigades, or 8,000 combat troops, into
Panama, the network said.
   The sources who spoke to The Associated Press refused to say
whether the State Department wanted extra troops in Panama to mount
a military operation to topple Noriega, or rather thought there was
more of a threat to Americans in the country than defense
officials. A State Department spokesman had no comment on the CBS
report.
   There are already more than 10,000 U.S. troops in Panama.
   ``The instability of the current situation in Panama; the
heavy-handed tactics of Noriega in dealing with the situation, and
the potential for increased threats to U.S. citizens and interests
in Panama make this deployment essential at this time to ensure the
continued safety of U.S. personnel and facilities,'' the Pentagon
said in a statement.
   The deployment should not be read as portending ``some kind of
military action on the part of the United States,'' the Pentagon
added.
   The decision to send the extra troops comes just one week after
the Defense Department completed a buildup that had already doubled
the number of security personnel guarding military bases in Panama.
It also comes four days after Panamanian troops marched on a Panama
City hotel, confiscating the tapes of four U.S. television networks
and briefly detaining several American journalists.
   The Defense Department's prepared statement did not elaborate on
who or what would be protected. But a ranking Pentagon official
said the troops ``will not be restricted to providing security at
our bases.''
   ``They will be able to go where they are needed to protect
Americans,'' said the official, who requested anonymity.
   ``This action is consistent with the Panama Canal Treaty and is
a reasonable and prudent effort to further safeguard the canal and
U.S. lives, property and interests in the area,'' the Pentagon's
statement said.
   The units being sent to Panama include an Army battalion of
military police; a reinforced company of Marines; three Air Force
Air Base Ground Defense Units; two additional guard dog squads and
an Army aviation task force, the Pentagon said.
   The aviation unit will include seven AH-1 Cobra helicopter
gunships along with 15 UH-60 Blackhawk transports and four OH-58
Kiowa observation copters, the Pentagon said.
   ``The aircraft are to provide rapid transportation and highly
mobile protection for the security forces if necessary,'' the
Pentagon said.
   The U.S. Southern Command, which has its headquarters in Panama,
had about 600 security personnel among the 10,000 servicemen
assigned to it before the United States stepped up its campaign
last month to oust Noriega.
   Over a 10-day period that ended on March 24, the Pentagon
dispatched another 670 security personnel to Panama for the stated
purpose of protecting military facilities.
   Besides the servicemen assigned to the Southern Command, there
are about 13,000 military dependents in Panama along with another
1,300 U.S. employees of the Panama Canal Commission and their 2,600
dependents.
   The Defense Department said the Army MPs would be drawn from
Fort Meade, Md., and Fort Bragg, N.C., while the Army helicopter
unit would come from the 7th Light Infantry Division at Fort Ord,
Calif.
   The Marine company will be dispatched from Camp Lejeune, N.C.
The Pentagon said it was not prepared Friday to say where the Air
Force ground defense units would deploy from.

   On March 25, The Associated Press carried an
incorrect report from a spokeswoman for the Joffrey Ballet company
on the cause of death of Robert Joffrey, director of the company.
   Joffrey, 57, died March 25 at New York University Hospital.
   Pennie Curry, a spokeswoman for the company, initially said that
Joffrey suffered from a liver ailment caused by medication he was
taking for asthma and a muscle condition.
   ``He died of liver, kidney and respiratory failure, period.
Asthma medication had nothing to do with it,'' said Terrie
LoCicero, a spokeswoman for the hospital.
   The hospital rarely makes such an announcement on the cause of a
patient's death, she said, but did so in this case because the
erroneous link between asthma medication and Joffrey's death
``frightened a lot of people.''
   Rima Corben, press representative for the Joffrey Ballet, said a
corrected statement on the cause of death was issued after
Joffrey's death. The AP did not carry that correction.
   Joffrey, a lifelong asthmatic, had taken up dancing as a child
after a doctor recommended it as a way to improve his health.

   Independent counsel James C. McKay has not
found sufficient evidence to indict Attorney General Edwin Meese
III but could issue a sharply critical report about Meese's
conduct, according to a source familiar with the case.
   McKay announced Friday that he would not seek indictments of
Meese in connection with the attorney general's efforts to help
promoters of a proposed Middle East oil pipeline or his investments
in telephone company stock ``based on the evidence developed to
date.''
   If a final decision is made not to bring charges in a month or
so, McKay said he will issue a report ``covering all the matters
which have been under investigation.''
   McKay's staff is debating whether the report would state that he
had probable cause to bring charges but dropped the case because it
did not meet the Justice Department standard for probability of
conviction, said the source, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Any report would detail what evidence McKay had gathered during
the 11-month probe and point out what the investigation had not
been able to learn, the source said.
   Meese, meanwhile, hailed the prosecutor's announcement, saying
he was ``gratified by the action and the statement,'' adding that
he had no plans to resign despite pressure from Congress following
the departure this week of two top Justice Department officials.
   ``It is certainly my intent to carry on my duties as long as the
president wants me to,'' Meese told reporters.
   A U.S. News & World Report poll released Friday said 55 percent
of those questioned said Meese should resign, while 21 percent said
he should stay in office. Those identifying themselves as
conservatives or Republicans also favored Meese's resignation by
wide margins, the magazine said.
   The nationwide telephone poll of 1,004 adults, conducted by The
Roper Organization on Wednesday and Thursday, has a margin of error
of plus or minus four percentage points.
   Meese, in an interview Friday on ABC-TV's ``20@20'' program,
said he did not feel he was hurting the president, but that if he
thought he was, he would resign. He said much of the clamor for his
resignation was coming from a ``lynch mob'' that included the press.
   McKay emphasized that the investigation would continue for at
least another month ``as to these and other matters'' to determine
if criminal charges are warranted.
   The grand jury is expected to question Meese, his wife, Ursula,
and U.S. Circuit Judge Douglas H. Ginsburg, who was head of the
Justice Department's antitrust division during the breakup of the
American Telephone & Telegraph Co.
   Meese's ownership of $14,000 worth of stock in regional Bell
system companies at a time he formulated department policy on the
AT&T divestiture raised conflict-of-interest issues.
   The Washington Post reported today that the Justice Department's
internal watchdog agency, the Office of Professional
Responsibility, was preparing to reopen its investigation of Meese.
The Post said said files on the investigation into Meese's dealings
with Wallach were moved to the OPM offices Friday.
   McKay said his decision to issue Friday's announcement was made
``without outside consultation'' but acknowledged that Meese's
lawyers had requested a public statement ``quite recently.'' A
source, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said Meese's lawyers
argued that McKay should tell the public because ``we know it and
you know it.''
   McKay declined to say if his investigation had been hampered
because he couldn't force the grand jury testimony of San Francisco
lawyer E. Robert Wallach, Meese's former financial adviser Franklyn
Chinn, and Dr. Kent London, a business associate of Wallach and
Chinn.
   All four are under indictment in New York City in connection
with their efforts to help Wedtech Corp. get government contracts.
In December, McKay announced there was insufficient evidence to
prosecute Meese for his efforts to help Wedtech Corp. get lucrative
defense contracts.
   ``The refusals of Mr. Wallach and Mr. Chinn and Mr. London are
based upon the fact that they said they would invoke their Fifth
Amendment privilege,'' McKay said.
   If McKay dismisses the grand jury without bringing charges, he
could retain his appointment or seek reappointment if new evidence
surfaces later on, the source said.
   The pipeline probe involved whether Meese conspired with Swiss
businessman Bruce Rappaport, Wallach and others to violate the
Foreign Corrupt Practices Act in connection with a plan to pay the
Israeli government and that nation's labor party to protect the
proposed pipeline from military attack.
   Wallach, who was legal counsel to Rappaport, wrote a memo to
Meese saying that $700 million from the pipeline, which was never
built, would be paid to the Labor Party of then-Israeli Prime
Minister Shimon Peres. Meese claimed he did not read that part of
the memo and Peres says he was never offered money. Rappaport also
denies there was such a plan.
   The attorney general's meeting with four executives of regional
Bell telephone companies at a time he owned $14,000 worth of Baby
Bell stock was also a focus of McKay's investigation. The companies
persuaded the Justice Department to drop its opposition to the Baby
Bells expanding into new business areas.
   McKay's announcement capped a week that began with the
resignations of two of his top aides, Deputy Attorney General
Arnold I. Burns and Assistant Attorney General William Weld.
   Meese declined to discuss why his two aides left, saying his
discussions with them were confidential. But he acknowledged ``some
basic differences'' with the two ``as to the effect that recent
events had on the department ... in part they were the fact that
there was an independent counsel investigation.''
   Meese received other good news on Friday when Solicitor General
Charles Fried announced he would not leave office, as he was
reported considering. ``I have concluded that I while I am able to
lead I should continue to do so,'' Fried said.

<HEAD>Tour Bus Driver Passes Off Homeless As Junketing Gamblers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LAS VEGAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A tour bus driver rounded up homeless people in
San Francisco and took them to Nevada casinos, from which he
collected money by passing them off as gamblers on a junket, police
said Friday.
   Nevada casinos routinely pay tour bus operators to bring in
gamblers.
   The driver, Gilbert Gonzado, had duped the two dozen street
people into thinking they were getting a free vacation, police
said. The alleged victims said they slept on the bus for seven days
and had no money to buy food.
   Gonzado was arrested at Cactus Kate's Casino near Jean before
dawn Friday after the manager became suspicious of the passengers
who were being touted as legitimate gamblers, said Las Vegas Metro
police.
   Police said Gonzado had asked for $400 to bring the people to
the casino. Earlier, he apparently obtained money from clubs in
Lake Tahoe and Reno, police said.
   Police said the driver was held on charges of obtaining money
under false pretenses.
   The street people were picked up at Cactus Kate's in police vans
and taken to Las Vegas, 35 miles away, where they were put in a
downtown shelter. Police said the people would have to find their
own way back to San Francisco.

   The Navy has continued to award contracts for
specially fabricated weapons containers to a small Idaho company
despite clear findings of shoddy workmanship and delivery delays,
the service's inspector general has concluded.
   The performance of the Yanke Container Cop. has been so poor
that the Navy should immediately ``initiate debarment proceedings''
to block the Boise, Idaho, company from receiving additional
contracts, added Rear Adm. M.E. Chang in an audit report.
   Moreover, the Navy needs to determine why its buying agents
continued to use Yanke Container and why the service failed to take
advantage of ``numerous opportunities to default the contractor or
demand consideration (penalty payments) ...,'' the report states.
   ``Yanke Container Corp. contracts indicate a clear inability to
perform to contract with regard to delivery and product quality,''
the Navy auditors found. ``This inability has been repeatedly
demonstrated in contracts since 1982.''
   Yanke handled nine of the 19 contracts it received since 1982 by
delivering ``312 defective new containers, resulting in over
$118,000 in additional cost to the Navy,'' the auditors wrote.
``Seven contracts were extended and five were delivered delinquent
to contract.''
   The 11-page audit report, which has yet to be released publicly,
summarizes the results of an investigation requested last December
by Assistant Navy Secretary Everett Pyatt. The report was released
by the Project on Military Procurement, a Washington-based group
that helps whistle-blowers.
   Yanke owner Richard Fish denied the accusations. ``Generally,
most of that is untrue. We intend to have our day in court on
this.''
   Fish said in Boise, Idaho, that he had not seen the report, and
accused the Navy of investigating his company ``behind our back. We
have not been notified.''
   ``Many of the things mentioned here are untrue,'' Fish said,
declining to elaborate.
   ``We are still looking at the facts,'' said Lt. Janet Mescus, a
Navy spokeswoman.
   ``Debarment is an option, but no decisions have been made. We
normally try to work with small businesses to overcome problems as
much as we can.''
   Fish said he asked Sen. Steve Symms, R-Idaho, to intercede.
   The Idaho Republican wrote to the Navy, saying that Yanke had
heard a competitor was challenging its continued eligibility for
Navy contracts and wanted to know if that were true.
   ``In our correspondence, we were asking the Navy to advise us
and to advise Yanke just what their concerns were,'' said Phil
Reberger, Symms' chief of staff
   ``The purpose of the inquiry from the senator was to ask what
was the story here and when does Yanke get to respond (to these
allegations)? Yanke has not had an opportunity to address any of
these concerns, and we certainly haven't had an opportunity to
evaluate the matter.''
   According to the audit report, the Navy has awarded Yanke 19
contracts since 1982 worth $12.25 million to fabricate aluminum,
fiberglass or steel boxes used to ship explosive armaments like the
Sparrow, Harm, Harpoon and Standard missiles and the Mk-46 torpedo.

<HEAD>Mrs. Thatcher Outraged At Amnesty Probe Into Killing of IRA Trio</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher has angrily
criticized a planned investigation by Amnesty International into
the killing of three unarmed Irish Republican Army guerrillas by
British commandos in Gibraltar.
   Amnesty shrugged off her comments, saying it gets the same
response when it lists human rights violations in South Africa, the
Soviet Union and Chile.
   ``I hope Amnesty has some concern for the more than 2,000 people
murdered by the IRA since 1969,'' Mrs. Thatcher told the House of
Commons Thursday, to cheers from rank-and-file legislators of her
Conservative Party.
   Conservative lawmaker John Carlisle fumed, ``These are
interfering do-gooders ... it (the Amnesty probe) will be deeply
resented by the British people.''
   In Belfast, Northern Ireland, Paddy McGrory, the lawyer for the
families of the three guerrillas killed _ Mairead Farrell, 31,
Danny McCann, 30, and Sean Savage, 23 _ said the relatives welcomed
Amnesty's concern.
   The London-based human rights organization, winner of the 1977
Nobel Peace Prize, announced Thursday it is investigating whether
the March 6 shooting of the woman and two men was an
``extrajudicial killing'' and called on the British government to
provide a ``full and public account.''
   Amnesty said the circumstances suggested the three were
``deliberately targeted'' and killed without challenge or attempt
at arrest. It said one was shot repeatedly while lying ``helpless
and incapacitated on the ground.''
   In the House of Commons, Mrs. Thatcher agreed with Conservative
legislator Ian Gow, who said the ``three terrorists, mercifully now
dead'' belonged to a terrorist organization which breached ``all
decent standards relating to human rights.''
   The guerrillas were shot in front of witnesses in Gibraltar, a
British colony on the southern tip of Spain.
   British and Spanish authorities said the three planned to
detonate a bomb during a changing of the guard ceremony and that
the attack would have killed more than 100 people.
   Spanish police recovered an explosives cache in a car linked to
the guerrillas.
   The IRA acknowledged the three were in Gibraltar on ``active
service.''
   The British government said after the shooting that the three
were challenged by commandos and made moves as if they were
reaching for arms or bomb detonators.
   Mrs. Thatcher said Thursday an inquest in June was the ``proper
occasion for the matters in question to be examined.''
   The killings set off new violence which killed nine people in
Northern Ireland, where the mainly Roman Catholic IRA is fighting
to end British rule. It wants to unite the province, which has a
Protestant majority, with the Catholic Republic of Ireland under a
leftist administration.

<HEAD>WASHINGTON WIRE: Hussein Of Jordan May Hold Key To Mideast Success</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BARRY SCHWEID</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir of Israel is the
most visible target of U.S. diplomacy in the Middle East, but the
key to success or failure just as easily could be King Hussein of
Jordan.
   The U.S. plan for Mideast peace talks poses dilemmas for both
leaders. Shamir's problems draw most of the attention. But Hussein
is facing some tough decisions, too.
   First of all, he has to decide whether to agree to negotiate
with Israel, and in a framework that gives no direct role to the
Palestine Liberation Organization.
   Hussein has come close several times, but backed off.
   He lost the West Bank by joining Egypt and Syria in the 1967
Six-Day war with Israel. Now he is trying to decide whether he
should enter negotiations without a guarantee he can get most or
all of it back.
   Or should he defer to the PLO, which claims the land and which
all Arab countries including Jordan have recognized as the only
legitimate representative of the Palestinian people who make up
about 96 percent of the West Bank's population?
   Former Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger, writing in ``Years
of Upheaval,'' described Hussein in 1967 as ``caught between the
passions of his Arab brethren and his own realism, for which he
paid the price of several radical attempts on his life.''
   Kissinger went on: ``He was trapped in the paradox that he was
the Arab leader most ready to make peace, yet of all the
territories it had conquered, Israel was most reluctant to
relinquish the Jordanian portion, which it most intimately
connected with its own tradition.''
   Israel, as it turned out in 1979, was willing to relinquish
Sinai. This willingness, combined with the daring initiative of the
late Egyptian President Anwar Sadat, produced a peace treaty with
the largest Arab country.
   Hussein will not know, until and unless he holds the talks,
whether Jordan will recover any or all of the West Bank.
   The U.S. plan calls for Palestinians participating in a joint
delegation with Jordan. The Palestinians would need the blessing of
the PLO. But Yasser Arafat's organization would be shut out.
   Modifying the 1978 Camp David agreement, Shultz would establish
self-rule but not statehood for the Palestinians for three years.
Hussein is faced with a decision on whether that kind of
arrangement is practical for Jordan.
   Negotiations on an overall settlement of the Arab-Israeli
conflict would begin in December.
   Shultz will make another attempt next week to get the two sides
together. Arriving in Jerusalem Sunday night from Rome, he will
launch a five-day diplomatic shuttle that will take him to Israel,
Jordan, Syria, Saudi Arabia and Egypt. He has met here with two
members of the Palestine National Council, the legislative arm of
the PLO, and would welcome more meetings with Palestinians in the
area.
   The focus has been on Shamir and not Hussein for several reasons.
   On his last trip, Shultz spent more time with the Israeli prime
minister and in Jerusalem than he did with Hussein or in Jordan.
   Dealings with Israel tend to be more open. The vigorous Israeli
press is quick to smoke out a proposal or to speculate about U.S.
diplomacy.
   Shultz deals with Hussein more quietly, and often through the
secretive veteran U.S. diplomat Philip C. Habib.
   Shamir is voluble in denouncing various provisions of the Shultz
plan, particularly a Mideast peace conference. His well-publicized
visit here two weeks ago coincided with the deadline Shultz had set
for Arab and Israeli responses.
   The timing gave Shamir's objections much more attention than the
absence of a positive response from Hussein.
   Shultz's last visit to the Middle East was keyed to Israel. He
made Jerusalem his headquarters, returning every night after
diplomatic forays to Jordan and Syria.
   On this trip, though, Shultz will spend about as much time in
Jordan as in Israel.
   A few years ago, after the PLO backed away from a tentative
agreement with Hussein on negotiating with Israel, the king in
frustration gave up and accused the United States of being
hopelessly one-sided in Israel's favor.
   Frustrated at other times with congressional vetoes of projected
U.S. arms sales to Jordan, the king has hinted he would look to the
Soviet Union for help. But he usually cools down and maintains
strong ties with Washington.
   U.S. officials pushing the Shultz plan acknowledge it poses
problems for all the participants. But they also insist it is fair
and balanced. They especially hope Shamir _ and Hussein _ next week
will say yes.

<HEAD>Workers To Remove At Least 30 Layers Of Paint In Refurbishing</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The White House, which has had at least 30
coats of paint slathered on it since it was first whitewashed in
1797, is getting a facelift for its 200th birthday.
   Scaffolding went up along the north wall and part of the south
wall of the president's home this week as workers began the job of
removing paint preparatory to repainting.
   The elaborate sandstone carvings on the window pediments,
balustrade and roofline cornice of the building also will be
repaired in time for the bicentennial in 1992.
   The White House has been the home and office of every president
since John Adams, but the cornerstone was laid Oct. 13, 1792, in
the administration of George Washington.
   Five years later the building was first painted white.
   Until 1980, the building was regularly painted every five years.
Because of persistent paint failure, the White House and National
Park Service asked the National Bureau of Standards in 1976 to make
a study and recommend corrective action.
   Scientists recommended in 1980 that the 30 or more layers of
paint be removed. They said this would improve the building's
appearance and make it easier to maintain.
   The National Park Service says records show that the building
became a white house for the first time when laborers working on
its newly laid walls used whitewash as a sealer.
   The original walls were damaged when the White House was burned
by the British during the War of 1812. During reconstruction from
1815 to 1817, portions of the walls were replaced.
   The interior of the White House was renovated from 1948 to 1952,
during the Truman administration, but the new project is the
largest exterior refurbishing since it was reconstructed.
   Repair of the sandstone carvings is being overseen by Vincent
Palumbo, master carver for the National Cathedral in Washington.
Some of the stones will be replaced with stone removed from the
Capitol during a recent renovation.
   William Seale, in his authoritative book, ``The President's
House,'' writes that the sandstone, quarried from nearby Aquia
Creek in Virginia, ``was shaped to magnificence'' by the hands of
the Scots carvers who worked on it.
   ``The Ionic capitals on the colossal pilasters are carved in
high relief with rich scrolls surmounted by acanthus leaves,''
Seale says. ``From the center of each cap bursts a cabbage rose in
stone, great in size and fanciful in conception beyond the flowers
usually found on column capitals.''
   Roses also appear again as an ornamental feature in a carved
swag over the northern door of the residence. Chains and fish-scale
designs decorate the windowsills.
   Seale, who wrote his book after completion of a previous project
in which the North Portico was repainted, said the intricate
designs had long been obscured by paint.
   ``Stripped bare, the pale stone with its smooth surfaces and
rich carving attests to the skill of those who dressed it,'' he
said.
   The current project involves the exterior north walls and part
of the south walls.
   They will be kept bare until the spring of 1989 to allow the
porous sandstone to dry so the paint will adhere to the walls
better when they are repainted.
   The paint is being removed by brushing chemicals on the walls
and then flushing them with a stream of water.
   The work is being done by Ramco Technologies of Harford, Conn.,
under a $384,200 contract.

<HEAD>Wisconsin's Open Primary Makes For Varied Possibilities</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By EVANS WITT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Political Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WAUSAU, Wisc. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ask Roger Timm who will get his vote in
Tuesday's Wisconsin primary, and his answer sums up the confusing
possibilities: ``I'm looking at Jackson _ or Bush.''
   In this state with a reputation for political independence and a
primary system to match, Jackson's strategy is to stitch together a
coalition of blue-collar workers, farmers and college town
residents. There are indications he is having some success.
   ``Jesse Jackson touches you where your heart is on economic
issues,'' said Gary Heiser, a Wausau real estate agent and Marathon
County Board member.
   ``To win, farmers and workers, rural and urban, black and white,
must come together,'' Jackson told about 700 people gathered in the
parking lot of the labor temple in Wausau.
   As in Michigan a week ago, Jackson is drawing big, enthusiastic
crowds from the housing projects in Milwaukee to almost all-white
Cudahy, Sheboygan and Wausau.
   At the University of Wisconsin at Oshkosh on Thursday, Jackson
drew 5,000 to a nighttime rally. And campaign staffers said he has
strong support in Madison, where the big state university campus is
located.
   But while Heiser is certain Jackson will do well in Wausau, he
isn't sure he can carry it against Massachusetts Gov. Michael
Dukakis.
   Kevin Keeffe, Marathon County Democratic chairman in Wausau,
said Jackson ``will do well among these guys'' _ that is,
blue-collar workers locked in a wage giveback dispute with a big
manufacturing company.
   However, ``Dukakis has a very good organization in town,''
Keeffe said, mentioning the American Federation of State, County
and Municipal Workers, which backs the Massachusetts governor.
   One of the complications _ pointed out by Roger Timm's
Bush-or-Jackson comment _ is that Wisconsin has an open primary.
Republicans can vote in the Democratic primary and vice versa.
Since George Bush has the Republican race all but wrapped up, GOP
voters might be tempted to weigh in with a Democratic ballot on
Tuesday.
   Jackson does generate the enthusiasm. Linda Pribanich, a Wausau
activist, was literally jumping up and down as she cheered him.
   ``I would like to think he could win here. This is as white as
it gets in this country,'' she said of the Wausau area.
   Wisconsin has a small black population _ less than 4 percent.
But Jackson campaign staffers say that doesn't worry them, pointing
to Jackson's improving showing in white areas in the Michigan
caucuses on March 26 and in Connecticut last week.
   ``We're going to do well in Wisconsin, because we are expanding
our base,'' said campaign manager Gerald Austin. ``We got 22
percent of the white vote in Connecticut.''
   In Wisconsin, blue-collar workers are a major Jackson target.
   ``When I put on my worker's hat, I am not jesting. It is my
regular hat,'' Jackson said in Oshkosh.
   ``I'm a working person person,'' he told the Wausau crowd.
   At stop after stop, Jackson delivers the same message of ``jobs,
peace and freedom.''
   ``We do not need Star Wars in outer space, we need jobs for
workers in Cudahy,'' he told 1,000 people there.
   ``The little people are really hurting,'' added Adele
Iwaskiewicz as she watched Jackson emerge from a neighbor's home in
Cudahy where he had spent the night.
   Mrs. Iwaskiewicz said she wouldn't have any problem voting for
Michael Dukakis if he's the nominee. She voted Republican in 1984.
   Timm, a Milwaukee policemen, also said he voted for Reagan in
1984, but he is attracted to Jackson's message.
   ``I like his pro-labor stands. He's talking about the working
people,'' said Timm, who is a neighbor of Mrs. Iwaskiewicz.
   In appealing to blue-collar workers, Jackson is tapping a sense
of obligation from his work on the behalf of striking workers in
this state and others tossed out of their jobs in years past.
   Jackson has a television ad featuring his talk to workers in
Kenosha, where Chrysler closed a plant after promising to keep it
open for several years.
   He returned to Cudahy on Wednesday to talk to workers who went
out on strike in January 1987 at the Patrick Cudahy meatpacking
plant.
   Local union president Mark Rosenberg said of Jackson: ``He's
going to do something about the system and make it work.''
   On Thursday, Jackson picked up the endorsement of Richard
Congdon, a Waukesha lawyer who headed Richard Gephardt's campaign
in the state.
   Congdon said he backs Jackson because they have ``overlapping
constituencies'' of workers and farmers.
   Asked if Jackson is electable, Congdon said: ``If he's not
electable, why does he keep winning elections?''
   Then there is the view of Chris Black, an industrial engineer
who was holding his 2-year-old son at the Wausau rally. Black said
he is undecided although he likes Jackson's message.
   Asked which other candidates he would consider, he answered:
``Pat Paulsen,'' the comedian known for his mock campaigns for
president.

<HEAD>Democrats Attack Administration; Reagan May Stump For Bush</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LAURA KING</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   The Democratic presidential contenders are training their fire
on the Reagan administration, taking particular aim at Attorney
General Edwin Meese III. Meanwhile, the White House says President
Reagan may hit the campaign trail on George Bush's behalf.
   The Democrats headed into the final few days of skirmishing left
before Monday's Democratic caucuses in Colorado, with 45 delegates
at stake, and the Wisconsin primary the following day, with 81
delegates up for grabs.
   Three of the Democrats _ Albert Gore Jr., Jesse Jackson and
Michael Dukakis _ said Meese must go.
   ``We cannot tolerate a situation where the nation's chief law
enforcement officer is constantly operating under a cloud of
suspicion,'' Gore told supporters at a fund-raising event Thursday
night in Coconut Grove, Fla.
   The Tennessee senator pointed to the resignations of two top
Justice Department officials this week, which department sources
said were aimed at protesting Meese's refusal to step down amid
mounting legal difficulties.
   ``President Reagan and Vice President Bush say, `Oh, it's no big
deal. There are resignations all the time,''' said Gore. ``What
insensitivity! What contempt for the American people!''
   Dukakis also said Meese should step down, saying the Justice
Department was ``in turmoil.''
   ``I would hope at long last the attorney general would resign _
it's long overdue _ and the president would appoint somebody as
attorney general we could be proud of,'' the Massachusetts governor
said at a news conference Thursday night in Milwaukee.
   Jackson, too, said Meese ought to quit, because he cannot carry
out his duties.
   ``It is not a question of guilt or innocence. He simply cannot
fulfill the requirements of the job,'' Jackson told a rally in
Sheboygan, Wis. ``Ed Meese deserves due process. We deserve an
attorney general.''
   Although Meese drew much of their wrath, the Democrats were
taking some digs at one another as well.
   Gore, trailing the two Democratic leaders, has been criticizing
Jackson all week on experience and electability. On Thursday, he
slapped at Dukakis for failing to follow suit.
   ``Mike Dukakis is afraid to say a single word about Jesse
Jackson,'' said Gore. A day earlier, the Tennessee senator
described Dukakis' reluctance to spell out his differences with
Jackson as ``ludicrous.''
   Dukakis, for his part, said differences with Jackson would
``come out over time,'' and aimed his attacks at the White House
instead.
   ``This administration has walked away from the American dream,''
he said in a Milwaukee speech Thursday night. ``They've walked away
from the basic contract that says if you work hard and pay your
taxes and live within the law, you have a right to a good job, and
the right to a life where you don't have to go to bed every night
worried about whether that job will still be there in the morning.''
   Meanwhile, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater raised the
possibility that Reagan soon would abandon his official neutrality
in the Republican race prior to the party's convention Aug. 15-18
in New Orleans.
   ``I simply want to open the door to this new prospect,''
Fitzwater told reporters. Bush's main rival, Sen. Bob Dole of
Kansas, dropped out of the race Monday.
   Former television evangelist Pat Robertson remains in the race,
but concedes he has almost no hope of winning the nomination. Bush
leads Robertson in delegates by a huge margin _ 841 to 17,
according to the latest AP count. To nominate, 1,139 are needed.
   ``Pat Robertson is still a candidate, in a declared sense, but
he, too recognizes the realities of the situation,'' Fitzwater said.
   The White House spokesman said no Bush campaign events featuring
the president had been scheduled, and none was expected in the near
future. But he said the 77-year-old Reagan is ``ready at the drop
of a hat to get out there on the road.''
   Gore, meanwhile, celebrated his 40th birthday on Thursday, and
expressed hopes the milestone would stave off questions about
whether he's too young to be president.
   ``Forty makes all the difference,'' he said. ``You know, Jack
Benny was perpetually 39. I've been doing a kind of reverse Jack
Benny.... I've been trying to turn 40.''
   Gore, without a win to his name since Super Tuesday, has been
searching for a Northern victory. But polls suggest Jackson and
Dukakis are fighting it out for the lead in Wisconsin, with Gore
trailing.
   Gore also is well behind the two leaders in the delegate race.
The latest AP delegate count puts Dukakis at 652.55; Jackson at
642.55 and 484.6 delegates in the uncommitted column. Gore had
367.8 and Illinois Sen. Paul Simon lags with 169.5. A candidate
needs 2,082 Democratic delegates to be nominated.
   Simon, making what could be a last stand in Wisconsin,
campaigned in Madison, calling himself ``an underdog who fights for
underdogs.''
   Like his Democratic opponents, Simon had harsh words for the
Reagan administration. He said Bush is riding Reagan's coattails,
but won't take responsibility for the negatives such as cutting
certain programs.
   ``Evidently the pilot was going one way and the co-pilot was
going the other,'' Simon said.
   Jackson, meanwhile, won some praise from former President Jimmy
Carter.
   ``I think Jesse Jackson has run as near a perfect campaign as I
have ever seen in this country,'' said Carter, who himself was a
dark-horse candidate in 1976. Carter has not formally endorsed any
of the Democrats.

<HEAD>AIDS Virus Changes And Strengthens As Disease Progresses,
Researchers Say</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL RECER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A study at the University of California in San
Francisco suggests that the AIDS virus gets tougher, meaner and
faster-acting as patients with the immune deficiency disease get
sicker, according to a report published today.
   Dr. Jay A. Levy, professor of medicine at UCSF, said he and a
group of researchers isolated the human immunodeficiency virus from
four patients over a four-year period and discovered that the
virus, which causes AIDS, seems to go through an evolution that
makes it stronger while the patient gets weaker.
   ``It's surprising,'' Levy said in an interview. ``The virus
doesn't just stay the same, but actually changes its biologic
features. It looks like the same virus, but it's probably evolving
within the individual.''
   Levy said the study used randomly selected patients who tested
positive for the HIV virus associated with AIDS, but had not yet
developed the disease. As the study progressed, three of the four
subjects developed AIDS and two of these died. The fourth patient
remains without AIDS symptoms.
   In the three who developed AIDS, Levy said the HIV viruses
isolated from their blood samples became more and more virulent as
their symptoms intensified. Virulence was tested by exposing the
isolated virus to cells in test tubes.
   Levy said that when the subjects were experiencing the most
severe AIDS symptoms, the HIV from their blood was able to multiply
more readily, infect host cells more easily and would attack a
greater variety of cells.
   The virulence did not change, however, in the virus isolated
periodically from the patient who remained free of AIDS symptoms,
he said.
   Levy said it is obvious that the virus must be able to
reproduce, or replicate, in order to evolve this increasing
virulence. As a result, he said, if researchers can stop the virus
from replicating, then it could be kept harmless, even though it
continued to live within the patient.
   ``You wouldn't get rid of the virus. ... They are kept for the
lifetime of the individual,'' said Levy. ``They would just never
become strong enough to cause disease.''
   The UCSF researchers now are searching for the HIV genes
responsible for increasing its virulence and its ability to
replicate. If this gene can be isolated, said Levy, ``then we can
actually target some approach (such as a drug) of getting at the
virus and arresting its replication.''
   Working with Levy in the research were Cecilia Cheng-Mayer,
Deborah Seto and Dr. Masatoshi Tateno.
   A report on the study was published today in Science, the
journal of the American Association for the Advancement of Science.
   AIDS, or acquired immune deficiency syndrome, destroys
lymphocytes, a key cell in the body's defenses against disease.
Without this defense, patients develop infections or rare cancers
that usually prove fatal.
   The AIDS virus is spread through sexual contact or through the
exchange of body fluids. It is most common among homosexual and
bisexual men, and among drug users who have shared injection
needles.
   Since 1981, the Centers for Disease Control report a total of
57,575 AIDS cases in the United States. Of these, 32,190 have died.
Nobody is known to have been cured of AIDS.
   Other developments in AIDS research include:
   _Researchers at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore report
they have found that a protein essential for the replication of the
HIV virus has a novel chemistry that may suggest a new approach to
an AIDS drug.
   Alan D. Frankel said he and his colleagues have discovered that
molecules of an HIV protein called Tat are bound together by metal
atoms. This, he said, opens the possibility of attacking the HIV
virus by somehow blocking the binding of the metal atoms.
   The research, which also is reported in Science, was conducted
at Johns Hopkins by Frankel, David S. Bredt and Carl O. Pabo.
   _The CDC, in a reversal of earlier recommendations, said
Thursday that children infected with the AIDS virus should receive
vaccinations against measles. Previously, the CDC had recommended
against vaccination because the children's immune systems might be
too weak to tolerate the live-virus measles vaccine.
   Now, however, ``It's felt that the benefit of getting the
vaccine outweighs the risk,'' said Dr. Lauri Markowitz, a CDC
measles specialist.
   _In an effort to encourage voluntary AIDS testing, the Health
Care Financing Administration is proposing changes in the
record-keeping requirements of the nation's medical laboratories.
   Under the proposed rules, published Thursday in the Federal
Register, laboratories that come under federal jurisdiction would
no longer be required to maintain the names of most people tested
for AIDS.

   Athletes who take steroids to build up their
muscles may trigger mental problems ranging from deep depression to
impulsive buying sprees and outbursts of violent rage, doctors
conclude in a new study.
   The medical hazards of anabolic steroids have been widely
publicized, but the researchers said the psychiatric side effects
are probably even worse.
   ``This is a phenomenon that is probably common and gone
unrecognized for a long time,'' said Dr. Harrison G. Pope Jr., the
study's director. ``There is a far higher incidence of psychiatric
symptoms attributable to anabolic steroids than any of us
previously thought.''
   Pope, himself a body builder, found that a substantial minority
of athletes who take steroids suffer delusions, hallucinations,
manic episodes and other temporary mental illness. Such symptoms
occurred in one-third of the users he and a colleague interviewed.
   One of these steroid users said he bought an old car and
deliberately drove it into a tree at 40 mph while a friend
videotaped him. Another became enraged when a driver in front of
him accidentally left his turn signal flashing. At the next stop
light, he leaped from his car and smashed the driver's windshield.
   Another young man bought a $17,000 sports car while taking
steroids. When he stopped taking the drug, he realized that he
could not afford the payments, so he sold the car. A year later,
while taking more steroids, he impulsively bought a $20,000 sports
car.
   One user had the grandiose delusion that he could pick up a car
and tip it over. Others became paranoid, believing that friends
stole from them, or became euphoric, convinced that nothing in the
world could hurt them.
   ``Those of us that have dealt clinically with anabolic steroid
use in athletes know these symptoms well,'' said Dr. Robery Voy,
director of sports medical for the U.S. Olympic Committee.
   Dr. Herbert Haupt of Missouri Baptist Hospital in St. Louis said
he has seen similar problems. ``They become violent and aggressive
individuals,'' he said. ``They take on Jekyll and Hyde
personalities.''
   Pope said other research he has conducted suggests that hundreds
of thousands American men have illicitly used steroids, which
retard the tendency of muscles to break down.
   Pope, a psychiatrist at McLean Hospital in Belmont, Mass.,
conducted the latest study with Dr. David L. Katz of Harvard
Medical School. It was published in the April issue of the American
Journal of Psychiatry.
   They interviewed 41 bodybuilders and football players who had
used anabolic steroids. They found that nine of them displayed
full-blown symptoms of mania or depression, while five others had
less severe signs of mental problems. In most cases, the users had
the symptoms only while taking steroids.
   The doctors found that many of the athletes routinely took doses
of steroids that were 10 to 100 times greater than those reported
in medical studies. Some practiced so-called stacking, taking
several different forms of steroids at once. These included pills,
injections and veterinary hormones.
   Steroids can cause a variety of physical side effects, including
liver damage, sterility and testicular atrophy. In women, they can
also cause facial hair and deepening of the voice.

<HEAD>Speculation Persists On French Hostage Deal</HEAD>

<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A new report in a Beirut newspaper has fed
speculation in Paris that France freed a terrorist suspect as part
of a deal with Iran to secure the release of three French hostages
held in Lebanon.
   Premier Jacques Chirac denied any connection, saying the release
of Mohamed Mouhajer on March 24 was purely up to the judge.
   ``The release ... is linked neither closely nor remotely,
neither directly nor indirectly, to the problem of French or
foreign hostages in Lebanon,'' Chirac said in a radio interview
Thursday.
   The leftist paper As-Safir said Thursday ``secret negotiations''
were under way to free three Frenchmen _ diplomats Marcel Fontaine
and Marcel Carton and journalist Jean-Paul Kauffmann _ being held
by pro-Iranian Shiite Moslems.
   The Beirut newspaper said an Iranian clergyman and a Lebanese
businessman were involved in negotiations in the Ivory Coast. It
said President Amin Gemayel of Lebanon was told of the negotiations
``aimed at obtaining the release of three French hostages.''
   Interior Minister Charles Pasqua was in the Ivory Coast this
week, but broke off his African tour Monday to return to Paris. He
said he was needed in the campaign now under way for the April 24
presidential elections.
   An investigating magistrate cited insufficient evidence in
freeing Mouhajer, a Lebanese arrested a year ago during the
investigation into bombings in 1986 that left 13 people dead and
250 injured.
   Several newspapers immediately linked the move to the hostages.
   In Washington, State Department spokesman Charles E. Redman said
Thursday, ``We want all the hostages released, but we oppose making
deals. Making concessions to terrorists only encourages more
terrorism.''
   He noted that France and other participants in a 1987 summit
involving the seven major industrialized deomcracies ``committed
themselves to the principle of making no concessions to terrorists
or their sponsors.''
   Nineteen other foreigners are missing in Lebanon, including a
Frenchman whose killing was announced by his captors in 1986,
though no body was found. Those held include nine Americans, three
Britons, a West German, an Italian, an Irishman, an Indian and two
unidentified men.
   American Terry Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent of The
Associated Press, is the longest held. He was kidnapped on March
16, 1985.
   Fontaine, Carton and Kauffmann also were abducted in 1985.
   In Geneva, Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati of Iran told a

<HEAD>Teamsters, Trucking Industry Beat Deadline On Contract</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   About 200,000 Teamster drivers and warehouse
workers will begin voting in two weeks on a new three-year
nationwide freight contract with the nation's major trucking
companies.
   After two months of negotiations and several hours before the
midnight expiration of their old contract, the union and the
industry's collective bargaining arm reached tentative agreement on
a new accord Thursday.
   Terms of the pact were not disclosed. But Teamsters President
Jackie Presser said it ``addresses the economic needs of our
members and advances their legitimate claims for job security.''
   Under the expiring contract with Trucking Management Inc., the
base rate for drivers who had been on a carrier's payroll for three
or more years was $14.71 an hour. Including fringe and pension
benefits, the industry had calculated its total labor costs at $23
an hour.
   Dissidents in the union said negotiators reportedly had agreed
earlier to keep hourly wage increases within a range of around 30
cents a year with annual benefit improvements amounting to about
another 20 cents an hour.
   But they emphasized that they had no firm knowledge if that is
what occurred.
   ``I really don't know what's in it,'' said Ken Paff, an
organizer for the small dissident Teamsters for a Democratic Union
faction. ``They're keeping it real quiet.''
   Chip Roth, a Teamsters spokesman, said the union will not
announce the terms of the tentative contract until April 7, when
negotiators are to present it to local presidents at a meeting in
Chicago.
   Ballots for the ratification vote will be mailed to Teamster
freight members in about two weeks, Roth said.
   The union's schedule calls for counting the ballots and
announcing the results in mid-May. Under the Teamsters'
constitution, rejecting a tentative contract requires a two-thirds
majority.
   Going into the negotiations, Teamster officials were under
pressure from two directions after giving up automatic
cost-of-living adjustments and allowing lower wage rates for new
hires and part-time ``casual'' workers in the 1985 contract.
   Some large carriers are enjoying fairly healthy profits
following a shakeout of the industry from deregulation in 1980
despite competitive pressures to undercut one another's freight
rates. However, a large number of smaller unionized companies are
having financial troubles.
   At least 78 Teamster-organized carriers have declared
bankruptcy, been swallowed up in mergers or acquisitions or have
gone out of business in the past eight years, according to union
figures.
   Union officials acknowledged their members employed by the
larger carriers were most interested in wage and benefit gains,
while those working for smaller companies wanted more emphasis put
on job security in the bargaining.
   The Teamsters also fared poorly under deregulation, losing
120,000 members between 1979 and 1985 to new non-union companies,
many of them subsidiaries of unionized carriers party to the Master
Freight Agreement. But the union appears to have stabilized its
trucking membership the past two years.
   ``Negotiations were difficult because the industry is in
financial chaos,'' Presser said in a statement Thursday,
encouraging support for ratification.
   Arthur Bunte Jr., the chief management negotiator in the
bargaining, indicated that turmoil is likely to continue.
   ``In the outcome of these talks, we do not feel we were
successful in convincing the union of the harsh competitive
realities facing our members in the marketplace,'' Bunte said.
   But there was little evidence of rancor between the two sides in
the two months of negotiations, held both here and in Arizona,
where Presser spends most of his time while recovering from cancer
treatments.
   Neither side ever mentioned the possibility of a strike. The
last time there was a labor disruption over a nationwide trucking
contract was in 1979, when the Teamsters struck selected carriers
for 10 days.

Easter</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The government said it ordered its
soldiers not to give Washington a pretext for armed intervention
and it failed to meet another payroll for civil servants, dampening
Easter celebrations.
   Thousands of people lined up for meals provided by charity,
casualties of the 5-week-old campaign to try to force the ouster of
Panama's de facto leader, Defense Forces chief Gen. Manuel Antonio
Noriega.
   The office of acting President Manuel Solis Palma issued a
communique Thursday alleging the United States was looking for an
incident that could justify military intervention.
   It cited a letter from Solis to Javier Perez de Cuellar, the
U.N. secretary-general, that said recent U.S. military movements in
Panama and its territorial waters constituted a security threat.
   ``The Defense Forces of Panama have orders to refrain from using
lethal or destructive weapons at any time against the armed forces
of the United States or against U.S. civilians or against property
or installations of citizens or the government of the United
States,'' the communique says.
   Solis was apparently referring to the passage of the U.S.
helicopter carrier Okinawa through the Panama Canal this week and
military exercises being conducted by troops stationed at the U.S.
Southern Command in Panama.
   ``Aware of the overwhelming power threatening it, the Republic
of Panama ... will not provide the foundation for fabrication of a
charge of aggression that could pretend to justify the launching of
acts of war,'' Solis said. ``Under no circumstances will Panama
allow itself to be provoked nor will it lend itself to the
fabrication of an incident.''
   It mentions the U.S. invasion of Grenada in 1983, which the
Reagan administration said was necessary to protect U.S. students
there.
   On Monday night, police and soldiers arrested and beat several
foreign journalists, including Americans, during a raid on a Panama
City hotel. The next day, presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater
condemned the incident.
   ``It has always been a principle that we will protect American
citizens as best we can. And while we have said that we don't plan
to go in (to Panama) militarily, it is also important to note that
there are limits,'' he said.
   The government shut down on Thursday for the Easter weekend
without paying most of its 130,000 public employees for the second
time in a month.
   It failed to meet the $33 million payroll despite the collection
this week of $19 million in quarterly tax revenues. About $5.5
million was said to be taxes and fees from U.S. companies doing
business in Panama.
   In Washington, the Senate voted 92-1 for a resolution urging
President Reagan to cut off the flow of money from U.S.
corporations to the regime of Noriega, who is under U.S. indictment
on charges of trafficking in Colombian cocaine.
   Most Panamanians are short of cash and food as a result of an
11-day-old general strike and the cash crisis, which was caused in
part by a U.S. freeze on millions of dollars of Panamanian assets
in American banks.
   The sanctions were imposed after the Noriega-orchestrated ouster
Feb. 26 of President Eric Arturo Delvalle in retaliation for
Delvalle's attempt to fire Noriega.
   Banks have been closed since March 3.
   With most businesses and industries observing the general
strike, the largest congregations of people were found in the food
lines of welfare agencies.
   The Rev. Laurino Duran, head of a Roman Catholic Church relief
society, said his organization was feeding 9,000 families a day.
   ``The number is growing daily,'' the priest said, adding that
the effort is costing $600,000 a month, which the church receives
in donated cash and food.
   Leaders of the National Civic Crusade were meeting to plan new
strategies in their frustrated effort to oust Noriega.
   ``We'll be talking over the weekend, discussing where we go from
here,'' said Roberto Aleman, an attorney and director of the
Crusade, a coalition of about 200 professional, business, labor,
political and other groups.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Toni Morrison struggled through 200 years of
history to write a small story that would deeply touch those who
read her spellbinding novel, ``Beloved,'' winner of this year's
Pulitzer Prize for fiction.
   ``I was only aware of how difficult it was to do and how fearful
it was for me because it required living there all those years,''
Morrison said in an interview Thursday. ``About the fourth, fifth,
sixth or seventh revisions I began to see the authority and maybe
the surrender. And when the language arrived I felt this very deep
pleasure and a feeling that I could serve both characters well.''
   The book, which quickly climbed best-seller lists when it was
published last year by Alfred A. Knopf Inc., is based on a true
account of an escaped slave named Margaret Garner who decided to
kill her child rather than see her returned to bondage.
   It was a chilling choice faced by many during the horrors of
slavery; some Africans chose suicide during the crossing on slave
ships, while others killed children or wives before leaving the
continent.
   In rich, riveting language, Morrison tells the tale of Sethe,
who escapes from Kentucky and struggles to survive in post-Civil
War Ohio in a house haunted by her dead baby.
   ``I had made myself a promise that I would not hunt for a
story,'' Morrison said. ``I wanted the book to find me. I was also
weary of taking on a writing project just because I was a writer; I
wanted it to be something that was driven.''
   Morrison, 57, who grew up in Lorain, Ohio, had heard the Garner
story, and found herself curious and puzzled by the woman.
   ``It seemed to me that was ... worth a text,'' she said. ``I got
very frustrated while writing, and each time I felt I couldn't
write it. And then I felt that if I couldn't do it justice, then it
would be like the slave owners had won.''
   However, the author of ``Song of Solomon,'' which won the
National Book Critics Circle Award for 1977, ``Tar Baby'' and the
play ``Dreaming Emmett,'' said ``Beloved'' is the best writing
she's done.
   She's reluctant, though, to call it the Great American Novel.
   ``I shied away from giving myself labels like great,'' the
author said. ``But it certainly is an American novel because I
think American literature is coherent and American history is
coherent only when black history is in it. So it becomes American
in that sense because it completes something.''
   Morrison, a graduate of Howard and Cornell universities and a
former editor at Random House, lives near Nyack, N.Y., in the
Hudson River Valley, and teaches at the State University of New
York at Albany.
   Morrison, who had written her other books while still an editor,
left her job at Random in 1983 to work on ``Beloved.''
   ``The quality of the work improved enormously,'' she said. ``I
had time _ not just writing time, but novel time. Novels don't
emerge in the chronological time of human beings; you have to give
it its own time.
   ``That's six years between the last one in 1981 and this one.
Three of those years was writing and revising and at least a year
and a half was spent thinking, clarifying things.''
   Morrison felt ``kind of a redemption'' on winning the Pulitzer
because of the controversy and literary politics surrounding the
prize.
   After ``Beloved'' did not win either the National Book Award or
the National Book Critics Circle Award, 48 prominent black writers
and critics signed a statement deploring the celebrated writer's
lack of recognition.
   There was the feeling the Pulitzer fiction committee might
succumb to pressure and give Morrison the award, which saddened her
because she wanted ``Beloved'' judged for its own literary value,
not because its author is black.
   ``Joy is uppermost because I really was thinking dark and
difficult thoughts about what was available to this book in terms
of recognition,'' she said. ``I never had any doubt that it was
worth first-rate consideration and recognition, but I did not
believe that that alone _ that its sheer merit was going to be the
sole criterion.
   ``My second feeling is my respect for the difficulties the
committee chose to ignore _ the outside matters of speculation and
gossip.''

<HEAD>Northeast Slips to Least Populated Region</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   For the first time, the wide-open spaces of
the American West contain more people than the densely-packed
Northeast, and the rapid Western growth will continue, the Census
Bureau says.
   The bureau predicts that between now and the year 2000 more than
half of all national population growth will occur in just three
states _ California, Florida and Texas.
   The study adds that Texas is on the verge of crowding past New
York as the nation's second most populous state. The projections
call for Texas to surpass New York by 1995.
   The Empire State now leads Texas 17.7 million to 17.2 million.
But by 1995, Texas is expected to have just over 19 million people,
with New York at only 17.9 million.
   That transition is symbolic of the slippage in the Northeast,
which has become the nation's least populated region, falling
behind the West for the first time.
   Bureau demographer Signe Wetrogen explained that the projections
are based on assumptions about trends in births, deaths,
immigration and movement within the country.
   The Northeast has been declining in its share of the U.S.
population, with less growth than other areas, she said.
   ``It is the one region with the highest share of population in
the older ages, and has low birth rates,'' she explained.
   Population shifts to the South and West in recent years have
drawn away many people in the prime ages of 18 to 24, she said.
   ``So the (Northeast) region is left with more older people, and
it's left without anybody to have more kids,'' she said.
   But because it is smaller in area than other parts of the
country, the Northeastern states remain the most densely packed.
New Jersey leads the nation with more than 1,000 people per square
mile.
   Tables included with the report show that between 1987 and 1988
the West region increased from 49.6 million people to 50.5 million.
At the same the Northeast edged up only from 50.1 million to 50.3
million.
   The 1988 estimates list the South with 85.1 million people,
followed by the Midwest with 59.6 million.
   While it was the center of early American development, the
Northeast hasn't been the most populous region since 1820, when the
South edged ahead. It remained second until 1880, when it fell to
third behind the Midwest.
   By 1990 the projections call for the South to have 87.3 million
people, followed by the Midwest, 59.8 million; West, 52.3 million
and Northeast, 50.6. million. By the year 2000 the counts are
expected to be South, 96.9 million; Midwest, 59.6 million; West,
59.4 million, Northeast, 51.8 million.
   By 2010, the report adds, the West could surpass the Midwest and
be the second most populous region.
   The projections show California remaining the most heavily
populated state, growing from 28 million people today to 29.1
million in 1990 and 33.5 million in 2000.
   Florida is expected to remain the fourth largest, though by the
year 2010 it may be closing in on New York also.
   By the year 2000, Illinois will have replaced Pennsylvania in
fifth place and Georgia will move into 10th, displacing North
Carolina, the report says.
   The U.S. is expected to grow from 243.3 million people in 1987
to 267.7 million in 2000, an increase of 24.4 million.
   In that period, California is expected to add 6 million, Florida
3.5 million and Texas 3.3 million. The three-state total of 12.8
million people represents 52 percent of the projected national
increase.
   Predicted to lose population in this decade are the District of
Columbia and four states; Pennsylvania, Ohio, Iowa and West
Virginia.
   In the 1990s population losses are expected in those states and
nine others: Indiana, Illinois, Michigan, Wisconsin, North Dakota,
Nebraska, Kentucky, Montana and Wyoming. On the other hand, things
are expected to turn around in the District of Columbia, with
growth resuming in the '90s.

<HEAD>Proxmire Proposes Plan To Unify Regulation Of Financial Markets</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Senate Banking Committee Chairman William
Proxmire, berating the Reagan administration for inaction, is
proposing legislation to unify regulation of the nation's financial
markets in the wake of the October stock crash.
   Proxmire, D-Wis., has an influential ally in former New Jersey
Sen. Nicholas Brady, who headed a presidential task force that
called for more coordination of the markets.
   But, even before the bill was introduced on Thursday, three top
federal regulators said they opposed it and one of its co-sponsors,
Sen. Donald Riegle, D-Mich., said he had reservations.
   The bill creates an Intermarket Coordination Committee composed
of the chairmen of the Federal Reserve, Securities and Exchange
Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.
   The new panel is required to harmonize margin requirements
across the futures and stock markets, coordinate ``circuit breaker
mechanisms'' such as trading halts and establish a contingency plan
for market emergencies such as last Oct. 19 when the Dow Jones
industrial average fell a record 508 points.
   The chairman of the Federal Reserve would head the three-member
panel and a majority vote would be required for action. The bill
directs the regulatory agencies to ``implement actions so
determined by the committee.''
   Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan, SEC Chairman David S. Ruder and
CFTC Chairwoman Wendy Gramm all said they would oppose creation of
a panel with power over their agencies.
   Greenspan said the new panel could create legal problems if, for
instance, it overruled the Federal Reserve on a matter determined
by other law to be within the Fed's jurisdiction.
   After listening to Greenspan, Riegle, chairman of the securities
subcommittee, said he was concerned about the bill's implications
and was reconsidering his support.
   Ken McLean, staff director of the banking committee, said the
bill would not give the panel as much power as Greenspan feared
because there is no enforcement mechanism should one of the
agencies decide to defy it.
   ``It's sort of halfway between a debating society and a
superagency,'' he said.
   In proposing the legislation, Proxmire expressed frustration
with the pace of the Reagan administration's efforts at market
reform and with the regulators' unwillingness to recommend
legislation without first airing proposals through a working group
set up earlier this month by the White House and headed by Treasury
Undersecretary George Gould.
   The president ordered the working group to report on its
progress by mid-May, but Proxmire said, ``It is difficult not to
conclude that the administration is attempting to run out the clock
on these issues.''
   ``It would appear that the White House is ignoring its own
presidential commission report and wants no legislation
whatsoever,'' Proxmire said, referring to the Brady task force,
which issued its report in January.
   Noting that both Greenspan and Ruder had said they would make
proposals for legislation by March 4, Proxmire said, ``The Federal
Reserve and the SEC have compromised their independence by reneging
on their pledge.''
   In the House, Rep. Edward Markey, D-Mass., chairman of the
Energy and Commerce subcommittee on finance, has expressed similar
frustration and is also working with Brady to draft a bill.
   Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, R-N.Y., along with Sens. Alan Dixon,
D-Ill., and Phil Gramm, R-Texas, are backing a cautious approach.
   ``We seem more hell-bent on changing things and patting
ourselves on the back than waiting to see what the ramifications
are,'' D'Amato complained.

<DATELINE>COCONUT GROVE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Democratic presidential contender
Albert Gore Jr. called for the resignation or firing of Attorney
General Edwin Meese III, saying: ``It is time to remove the cloud
over the Department of Justice.''
   Gore, at a fundraiser here, used his criticism of Meese for an
indirect attack at George Bush, the nearly certain Republican
presidential nominee.
   ``How long will it take this administration to understand the
importance of integrity in government?'' the Tennessee senator
asked a crowd of about 100 supporters at the posh Grove Isle
resort. ``We cannot tolerate a situation where the nation's chief
law enforcement officer is constantly testifying as a suspect
before grand juries, constantly operating under a cloud of
suspicion.''
   Gore noted the resignations of two top Justice Department
officials this week, a move that department sources said was aimed
at pointing up the problems Meese is causing by staying on.
   ``President Reagan and Vice President Bush say ``Oh, it's no big
deal. There are resignations all the time,''' said Gore. ``What
insensitivity! What contempt for the American people!''
   The Tennessee senator was heading to Wisconsin today for
campaigning in advance of Tuesday's primary.
   ``I think we are going to exceed expectations in Wisconsin,'' he
said, but wouldn't predict where he would finish.
   About $108,000 was raised at Thursday's event, said Mitchell
Berger, a Fort Lauderdale attorney and co-chairperson.
   Gore told the crowd that despite a lack of success since Super
Tuesday, his candidacy is in a good position to gain momentum with
a win in a large Northern state like Pennsylvania or New York.
   During the fund-raiser, Gore told reporters he is not singling
Jesse Jackson out for unfair criticism.
   ``I am treating each of the candidates equally. I have strong
differences of opinion with Jesse Jackson and I have strong
differences of opinion with Mike Dukakis, and neither one of them
has a single day of experience in the national government. I think
that's relevant in the choice faced by the voters,'' he said.
   Gore, who turned 40 on Thursday, said it was a relief for him.
   ``All those people who thought 39 was too young to run for
president, I've solved their problem,'' he said with a smile.

   With political strength following population,
new 1990 Census projections give California, Texas and Florida a
rosy outlook.
   California would jump to 50 members of the House, a gain of
five, according to an analysis by the Library of Congress.
   David C. Huckabee of the Library's Congressional Research
Service recalculated the House distribution based on the new Census
Bureau projections of populations in 1990. The estimates were
released Thursday.
   Huckabee cautioned, however, that his calculation is based on
estimates, and a very small change in population can shift a House
seat from one state to another.
   In 1970, for example, a difference of fewer than 300 people gave
Oklahoma rather than Connecticut an additional House seat, he said.
   With House seats limited to 435, every gain by one state means a
loss for another.
   In addition to California, Huckabee calculated that Texas would
gain four new seats in the House and Florida would gain three.
   Adding two seats would be Arizona and Georgia, while North
Carolina and Virginia would each pick up one.
   On the other hand, New York and Pennsylvania would each drop
three seats, he calculated. Losing two apiece would be Illinois,
Michigan and Ohio. Expected to lose one would be Iowa, Kansas,
Massachusetts, Montana, West Virginia and Wisconsin.
   Huckabee's figures differ slightly from those of William O'Hare
at the private Population Reference Bureau, who used a different
set of 1990 estimates.
   Election Data Services, a private consulting firm, also issued
somewhat different reapportionment estimates earlier this year,
based on 1987 Census estimates.

   Land prices skyrocketed in Japan last year, with
the choicest piece of commercial real estate selling for more than
$6.7 billion per acre, the government reported today.
   Japanese newspapers bemoaned the record price jump in Tokyo,
where residential real estate land rose 68.9 percent last year,
nearly twice the previous high of 35.9 percent in 1973 and almost
triple the increase in 1986 of 23.8 percent.
   ``If the (Japanese) people work diligently all their lives and
find that they are unable to even purchase a house of their choice,
then we can expect them to question the signficance of economic
development,'' the nationally circulated daily Asahi Shimbun said
in an editorial today.
   It called on the government to convert more public land into
housing sites and on industry to build residential complexes near
workplaces.
   The National Land Agency released the 1987 statistics Thursday,
the last day of Japan's fiscal year. The agency said land prices
soared abnormally due to speculative buying, money surpluses and
lowered interest rates.
   The land agency said the highest land price was 34 million yen
per square meter, registered in the Chiyoda ward in central Tokyo's
main Marunouchi business district. At the exchange rate of one
dollar to 125 yen, that price translates to $272,000 dollars per
square meter or $6.72 billion per acre.

million price was ``reasonably correct.''
   Geller made local headlines in 1985, when he won an 11-year
battle against a group of New England radio station owners that
wanted to take over his frequency.
   The Federal Communications Commission ruled in his favor,
despite arguments by the group that the station's concentration of
classical music violated FCC requirements for news and public
affairs programming.

   Boris Karlov will return to the Soviet
Union a little wiser about the world's woes, a little more certain
that there are no simple answers to the issues that separate the
superpowers.
   Karlov is among 1,500 students taking part in the National Model
United Nations session, an annual forum for students to dabble in
diplomacy, play a little poltics and tackle the same dilemmas that
confront the real U.N.
   In a nifty bit of role reversal, however, Karlov is playing the
part of the U.S. ambassador.
   ``It is not easy to represent other views,'' he said, ``but it
is extremely important to help us understand each other; to help us
understand how the United States thinks, for the United States to
understand how the Soviets view the world.''
   He wasn't the only student thrust into an unfamiliar role.
   One of the most outspoken delegates this year has been Betsy
Snider of West Virginia's Bluefield State College, who was the
delegate from the Palestine Liberation Organization's observer
mission.
   Snider, who described her politics as ``Republican,'' said that
``at one time I felt that the United States was always right, but
when I started (attending model U.N. sessions) I started to have
pro-Arab sympathies.''
   The model U.N. was set up in the same structure of the real U.N.
The Security Council groped for a solution to the war between Iran
and Iraq. Meanwhile, delegates to the General Assembly launched
scathing denunciations of Israel's occupation of Palestine.
   The students _ from the United States, Soviet Union, West
Germany, Canada and Japan _ were asked to assume roles that
challenged their national perspectives.
   ``By the end of the week, you come to accept your role,'' said
Brian Hayden, an American acting as secretary-general this year.
   ``One of the better learning experiences is coming up against
the United States in a debate. I remember thinking, `Are we (the
United States) really that difficult to work with?'''
   The students are required to follow the national policies of the
countries they represent, so they soon learn the limits of the
United Nations system: bloc voting, lack of enforcement power,
vetoes by the permanent members of the Security Council _ the
United States, Soviet Union, China, Britain and France.
   ``What we simulate is frustration,'' said Thomas Becker of
Westport, Conn., who is playing the undersecretary-general for
economic and social affairs. ``Students come away exhilarated by
the experience but with understanding of the restraints and
frustrations under which delegates must operate.''
   The National Model United Nations Conference dates back to 1923,
when its predecessor organization simulated the League of Nations.
It changed its name in 1946 after the founding of the United
Nations.
   The organization is organized by a non-profit committee
affiliated with the U.N. Department of Public Information, and
funded by fees paid by students attending the sessions.
   But don't expect any simple answer to the world's ills this
week. The real U.N. doesn't operate that way, and neither does its
student model.
   ``There is room for creativity, and exciting things happen in
caucuses, but if there were a breakthough it would probably mean
the students hadn't done their homework,'' said Becker.

<HEAD>Prosecutor Says Nofziger Should Be Sentenced For Ridiculing Law</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES ROWLEY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former presidential aide Lyn Nofziger is still
worth more than $2.8 million despite his pleas of financial
hardship and should be imprisoned for illegally lobbying the White
House, a prosecutor says.
   Independent counsel James C. McKay said Nofziger deserves
imprisonment for flouting and belittling the Ethics in Government
Act.
   Nofziger also should be fined because he was ``unjustly
enriched'' by lobbying then-presidential counselor Edwin Meese III
and other White House aides on behalf of Wedtech Corp. and two
other clients, McKay said in a sentencing memo filed Thursday in
U.S. District Court.
   The former White House political director is scheduled to be
sentenced next Friday by U.S. District Judge Thomas Flannery.
   McKay, noting a probation office report that Nofziger's
``current net worth exceeds $2.8 million,'' rejected the
defendant's argument that the ``public humiliation and serious
financial reversals'' resulting from his indictment and trial
should spare him further punishment.
   Nofziger has said his legal bills total $1 million and friends
have started a defense fund to help pay his lawyers.
   McKay said ``virtually all'' of Nofziger's wealth was
accumulated after he left the White House.
   ``It cannot fairly be concluded that defendant Nofziger's
reduced financial situation supplants the justifications for
judicial punishment for his offenses,'' the prosecutor said.
   McKay noted that Nofziger's lobbying of Meese, now attorney
general, on behalf of Wedtech helped the Bronx, N.Y. company win a
$32 million Army no-bid contract.
   ``The transfer to defendant Nofziger of many thousands of
dollars worth of Welbilt stock would not have occurred if that
contract had not been awarded to Welbilt,'' McKay said, referring
to Wedtech by its previous name, Welbilt Electronic Die Corp.
   Nofziger and his partner, Mark A. Bragg, eventually sold their
Wedtech stock for more than $600,000, according to court records.
   Nofziger's remarks after his conviction showed ``a total lack of
remorse or contrition,'' McKay said.
   Minutes after he was convicted on Feb. 11, Nofziger told
reporters his crime was like ``running a stop sign.''
   He called the ethics statute ``a lousy law.''
   ``That intransigent attitude is a consideration arguing in favor
of a sentence that includes a period of incarceration,'' said
McKay, who did not specify the length of the prison term he sought.
   Nofziger could be sentenced to up to two years and fined as much
as $10,000 for each of three felony convictions for lobbying former
colleagues within a year of leaving President Reagan's staff in
early 1982.
   Defense attorney E. Lawrence Barcella said for McKay to
``request jail time for a 63-year-old man with a spotless record of
public service who did not intend to violate the law is ridiculous,
unnecessary and totally lacking in compassion.''
   But McKay argued in his brief that Nofziger ignored advice about
complying with the Ethics in Government Act from lawyers he
retained when he left Reagan's staff in early 1982.
   The prosecutor recalled an episode during which Nofziger uttered
a profanity when advised by one of his lawyers not to make any
White House contacts without first consulting his attorneys.
   The incident was described at a bench conference during the
trial by associate independent counsel Merrick Garland out of
hearing of the jury and spectators, according to the transcript.
   When Nofziger attorney Martin L. Artiano gave the advice,
Nofziger uttered the profanity and said ``these are my friends and
I am going back to them if I want to,'' Garland told the judge.
   ``Lyn doesn't recall having such a conversation,'' Barcella
said. Artiano only recalled such an incident after ``a lot of
prompting'' during ``repeated interviews with the independent
counsel and numerous sessions with the grand jury,'' the defense
lawyer said.
   ``Even Artiano said Lyn was joking when he said it and
thereafter Lyn came and asked for their advice about Ethics in
Government Act matters,'' Barcella said.

<HEAD>Unneeded Bypass Surgery May Be More Common Than Thought</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LEE SIEGEL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SANTA MONICA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Medical students should be taught to
avoid performing unnecessary coronary bypass surgery, says the
author of a study that found unneeded operations may be more common
than thought in the United States.
   The study, published today in the British medical journal
Lancet, also found British doctors may perform coronary bypass
surgeries too infrequently, said Dr. Robert H. Brook, a Rand Corp.
researcher and internist-geriatrician at the University of
California, Los Angeles.
   Brook said the findings suggest the United States could cut
health care costs without having to ration needed cardiac care,
while Britain already is rationing such care.
   Brook and American and British colleagues conducted their study
by organizing two panels of doctors, one with nine U.S. physicians
and the other with nine from Britain. Each panel then rated the
``appropriateness,'' or necessity, of two procedures for a series
of hypothetical heart patients.
   One procedure was coronary bypass, in which doctors try to
prevent heart attacks and heart pain by surgically attaching new
blood vessels to the heart to replace clogged arteries. The second
procedure was coronary angiography, in which doctors search for
blockages in coronary arteries by injecting dye into them and then
X-raying them.
   The panels' review of hypothetical patients produced criteria
for determining when bypass surgery and angiography are necessary
or unnecessary. The researchers defined a procedure as appropriate
if its benefit to health exceeeded its risks by a sufficiently wide
margin. Cost was not a factor.
   The researchers then applied those criteria to 386 coronary
bypass operations performed on real Medicare patients in Washington
state. The British doctors' criteria deemed 35 percent of the
operations were unnecessary, while the U.S. doctors' criteria
deemed only 13 percent unnecessary.
   More than 200,000 Americans undergo coronary bypass surgery each
year, and some American studies suggest at least 25,000 of them, or
about 13 percent, are unnecessary, the Journal of the American
Medical Association reported last year.
   Unnecessary bypass operations could be reduced if ``guidelines
such as the ones we developed are promulgated and become an
integral part of education in medical school,'' Brook said Thursday.
   Brook and his co-authors also found that Britain's 1985 rate of
210 coronary bypass operations per million residents was only half
what it should have been if British doctors followed the British
panel's criteria.
   The criteria developed by the British and U.S. doctors also were
applied to 1,677 coronary angiographies performed on Medicare
patients throughout the United States and 376 performed on Medicare
patients in Washington state.
   Under the British criteria, 42 percent of the angiographies
performed nationally and 60 percent in Washington state were deemed
unnecessary, while under the U.S. criteria, only 17 percent of
those performed nationally and 27 percent of those in Washington
state were considered unnecessary.
   About 680,000 coronary angiographies are performed annually in
the United States, according to the American Heart Association.
   The study said British doctors apparently require more
scientific evidence before determining if bypass surgery or
angiography is necessary.
   Brook said if American doctors followed their British colleagues
in emphasizing greater use of medicine and less bypass surgery to
treat blocked coronary arteries, U.S. health care costs could be
reduced without having to ration funds to provide bypass surgery
and angiography.
   On the other hand, ``the findings imply effective care already
is being rationed'' in Britain, he said, adding that if further
study confirms the results, Britain should seriously consider
making bypass surgery and angiography more widely available.
   Brook's co-authors were Dr. J.R. Hampton, a cardiologist at
Britain's University Hospital Nottingham; Jacqueline Kosecoff, a
private consultant to Rand; Rand economist R.E. Park; and Drs. Mark
Chassin and Constance Winslow, both of whom work at Rand and UCLA.

   Toni Morrison's novel ``Beloved'' sparked the
biggest literary controversy of the year, but the panelists who
nominated it for the Pulitzer Prize said they felt no pressure to
choose it over other works.
   ``None,'' said Michael Gartner, editor of the Ames (Iowa) Daily
Tribune. ``For us, it was just a case of sitting down and reading
three books and deciding which one was the best. ... `Beloved' was
clearly the superior book.''
   The controversy surrounding ``Beloved'' erupted after the novel,
a powerful story of a former slave who kills her daughter rather
than see her returned to bondage, failed to win the National Book
Award and the National Book Critics Circle Award.
   Larry Heinemann won the National Book Award for ``Paco's Story''
and Philip Roth won the National Book Critics Circle Award for
``The Counterlife.''
   In January, 48 black writers and critics signed a letter
denouncing the fact that Ms. Morrison, who is black, ``has yet to
receive the national recognition that her five major works of
fiction entirely deserve.''
   With the biggest prize of all, the Pulitzer, still to come, the
letter generated debate about the role _ and propriety _ of
lobbying in the selection of literary awards.
   But the jurors who nominated ``Beloved'' as one of three
Pulitzer finalists in fiction said they had made their decision
weeks before the letter was published, and that they chose it in an
atmosphere free of pressure.
   ``I want her to realize this wasn't the result of any
pressure,'' said the chairman of the three-member jury, Rutgers
University professor Julian Moynahan. ``I think her book is one of
the greatest American novels I've ever read in my life.''
   The jury was required to submit three choices to the Pulitzer
Board without stating a preference. Moynahan was far from
non-partisan as he spoke about it in retrospect.
   ``If she hadn't gotten it, I think I would have cut my throat,''
he said Thursday after the prizes, chosen by the 17-member board,
were announced.
   The other two nominated novels were ``Persian Nights'' by Diane
Johnson and ``That Night'' by Alice McDermott.
   ``They're all three wonderful books,'' said another juror, Los
Angeles Times book critic Richard Eder.
   Eder spoke passionately about ``Beloved,'' calling it ``an
incredible evocation ... of the incredible degradation that slavery
meant to the bodies and souls of slaves. ... I don't think it's
been better done.''
   One Pulitzer Board member, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said the board's decision about ``Beloved'' was unanimous. He
declined to talk about the discussion that led to the choice.
   One of the writers who signed the protest letter, John Edgar
Wideman, said the board's decision encouraged him. ``I'd only be
happier if I won it,'' he said.
   ``What was said about Toni Morrison (by black writers and
critics) was something symptomatic about the reception about black
literature in general,'' Wideman said.
   Wideman said the late James Baldwin was an even better example
of a black writer being ignored.
   ``That certainly does not get redressed by one award or one
person's triumph,'' Wideman said. ``It's a good sign. But let's
cross our fingers and hope it represents a trend, a symptom of a
larger understanding and appreciation of the work of black people
in all fields.''

   NASA says two areas in Mississippi and one
near Cape Canaveral in Florida are prime candidates for a $1
billion plant to build the next generation of space shuttle rocket
boosters, but that plans are being held up by the White House.
   Two officials of the National Aeronautics and Space Agency
indicated to Congress on Thursday that a requirement for the site
might be that it be accessible by rail and water. That would
eliminate the Morton Thiokol Inc. plant in Utah, the sole source
for current booster rockets.
   Adm. Richard Truly, head of the shuttle program for NASA, and
J.R. Thompson, director of the Marshall Space Flight Center in
Alabama, testified they expect to decide on a site before June when
requests are issued for proposals to build and operate the plant.
   They had been expected to present a comprehensive plant
acquisition plan to the space science subcommittee of the House
Committee on Science and Technology. But they said the plan was
being held up by the White House's Office of Management and Budget.
   The March 30 deadline was spelled out in legislation last year
that was signed by the president. The delay caused Rep. Bill
Nelson, D-Fla., the subcommittee chairman, to say that NASA was
``being hamstrung by the administration, specifically by OMB.''
   He called it ``another example of an administration that's got
such a mixed-up policy, a lack of direction, that it is going
several different ways and not holding itself accountable by
Congress.''
   But OMB, through a spokeswoman who said she didn't want to be
named, said that a technical report of the kind submitted by NASA
normally takes five days for review and that it had been received
only two days earlier. ``They knew that,'' she said. ``We are
taking the full five days.''
   The facility will cost $200 million to $300 million to build and
$1 billion to get into production, Truly said.
   Thompson said a number of sites had been looked at, mostly
around the Gulf coast and some in Florida. He said the Cape
Canaveral area, Bay St. Louis, Miss., and Yellow Creek, in
Mississippi near the Alabama-Tennessee border ``would be among the
three more attractive'' places.
   Thompson said five firms have expressed an interest in making
the Advanced Solid Rocket Motors, which are planned for flights
beginning in mid-1993 that need the extra lifting power the new
boosters will have. Morton Thiokol will continue to make the
current boosters, which gradually will be phased out by mid-1997.
   Thompson said four of the firms, United Technologies, Atlantic
Research, Aerojet and Hercules, are interested in operating a
government-owned plant, while Morton Thiokol wants to upgrade its
facilities in Utah.
   ``A new facility, in our opinion, is needed,'' Truly said. ``It
needs to include more automation, cleaner facilities.''
   The two officials would not commit themselves to whether the
NASA plan rules out a contractor-owned, contractor-operated
facility as is the case with Morton Thiokol.
   But Thompson said, ``We just do not want to get ourselves tied
to one contractor for the long haul.''

<HEAD>Government Apologizes For Kwangju Rebellion, Proposes Compensation</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The government of President Roh
Tae-woo formally apologized today for the bloody suppression of a
1980 rebellion in the southern city of Kwangju and proposed
financial compensation for the victims.
   The announcement by the 5-week-old government departed sharply
from how the previous administration of Chun Doo-hwan handled the
civilian uprising _ calling those involved ``rioters.''
   The government ``offers its sincere apology not only to the
victims of the turmoil but also all residents of Kwangju and the
general public,'' Culture and Information Minister Chung Han-mo
told a news conference.
   He said the administration ``thinks the Kwangju turmoil can be
considered a part of the democratization efforts of the students
and citizens'' in the provincial capital 200 miles south of Seoul.
   Many citizens in Kwangju and other critics of the former
president blame Chun for harshly suppressing the nine-day armed
uprising. By official count, 191 people were killed and more than
800 wounded. Dissident sources claim the casualty figure was much
higher.
   The excessive lengths to which the government allegedly went to
crush the uprising emerged as a major issue during the election
campaign that ended in Roh's election in December.
   Chung said that ``to promote national reconciliation,'' the
government decided ``the wounds of the tragic Kwangju turmoil of
May 1980 must be healed as quickly as possible.''
   Roh, who succeeded Chun Feb. 25, pledged during the campaign
that he would restore the honor of Kwangju citizens by making a
formal apology and offering compensation.
   Chung said proposed measures include financial support and
employment for the bereaved families and wounded victims, erection
of a memorial monument and conversion of the Mangwol-dong Cemetery
in Kwangju, where many of the victims are buried, into a park.
   To effectively carry out the measures, Chung said a national
commission chaired by the prime minister and a municipal commission
led by the Kwangju mayor will be formed.
   He said the government ``appeals to all concerned parties _ the
surviving victims, the citizens of Kwangju and the general Korean
public _ to understand and forgive each other and put the pain of
the turmoil behind them so that everyone can join hands to achieve
grand national harmony.''
   The governing Democratic Justice Party welcomed the government
announcement as ``proper measures for democratization and national
reconciliation.''
   But the main opposition Reunification Democratic Party charged
the government was attempting to evade the main issue of what
really happened during the Kwangju uprising.
   The political opposition, joined by families of the victims,
have demanded that an objective investigation be carried out and
that those responsible be punished.
   Government officials, however, maintain an investigation would
aggravate the situation in Kwangju, site of violent riots during
last year's campaign.
   The conciliatory announcement, following the arrest Thursday of
Chun's younger brother on corruption charges, is seen by some
observers here as a move by Roh to distance himself from the
authoritarian Chun at a time when the government party is gearing
up for the National Assembly elections at the end of April.
   Roh, a former general and schoolmate of Chun, helped the former
president gain power in 1980.

<TEXT>
   A plan to give illegal aliens an additional
seven months to apply for amnesty has won committee backing, and a
key supporter says the plan has a good chance of passage in the
House.
   After the House Judiciary Committee voted 22-12 Thursday to
extend the current May 4 deadline to Nov. 30, Rep. Charles Schumer,
D-N.Y., said the margin ``bodes well for passage in the House.''
   The legalization plan applies to aliens who came to the United
States illegally but have lived in the United States continuously
since before Jan. 1, 1982.
   Schumer said he was encouraged by support in committee from
three Republicans, including ranking GOP member Hamilton Fish of
New York and Dan Lungren of California, who was instrumental in
passage of the landmark 1986 immigration law that established the
amnesty program.
   Rep. Michael DeWine of Ohio was the third Republican to support
the extension, while Rep. Harley Staggers, D-W.Va., was the only
Democrat to oppose it. The remainder of the vote was along party
lines.
   ``The margin was higher than expected,'' Schumer said. ``While
we have a long way to go, I'm more optimistic than ever it will
reach the president's desk.''
   Schumer said he expected the bill to reach the House floor soon
after next week's congressional recess. The legislation still faces
heavy opposition in both the House and the Senate _ where it could
be subjected to a filibuster. In addition, the Reagan
administration opposes the bill.
   Legalization was a cornerstone of the landmark law signed in
November 1986 to slow massive illegal immigration. The program was
included as a balance to the legislation's enforcement provision:
financial penalties against employers who knowingly hire
undocumented workers.
   Alan C. Nelson, commissioner of the Immigration and
Naturalization Service, said this week that even talk of an
extension was ``a major threat to the program'' because aliens
would become confused and delay their applications.
   But the majority of committee members, while praising the INS'
current attempt to publicize legalization and the May 4 deadline,
contended the media campaign began too late to reach all those who
might apply.
   INS figures show that through March 29, some 1.1 million
applications have been received under the general amnesty program.
More than 300,000 have been received from a special program for
agricultural workers.
   The agricultural program already has a Nov. 30 deadline.
   Of applications that have reached the decision stage, only
12,700 have been rejected, a rate of 2 percent. Another 782,000
have been approved and the remainder are in the pipeline, the INS
says.
   Applicants receive a temporary work permit when they apply for
legalization, and therefore can stay in the country while awaiting
a decision. If the applicant gains temporary residency, he or she
is then on the road toward permanent residency and citizenship.
   INS figures show the number of applicants has been increasing as
the May 4 deadline approaches. For instance, 16,800 people applied
the week ending Jan. 22, while there were 30,620 applicants in the
week ending March 11. The total was 36,830 for the week ending
March 18.
   The leading committee opponent of the extension, Rep. Patrick L.
Swindall, R-Ga., told colleagues that the amnesty program was
barely approved by the House in 1986.
   ``Now we're going back and changing that delicate balance,'' he
said. ``Now we are coming through the back door and extending it.
It leaves the door wide open to come back again.''
   Rep. Romano L. Mazzoli, D-Ky., chief sponsor of the new
deadline, said the ``one-shot'' extension would continue to be
``self-sustaining,'' paid for by fees charged to applicants.
   He pointed out that some of the INS legalization offices would
stay open until Nov. 30 anyway to receive applications for the
agricultural program, which was established for 18 months.

   A passenger bus ran off a highway
and plummeted more than 160 feet into a river outside this central
Mexico town, killing at least 14 people and seriously injuring 26,
authorities said.
   Rescuers searched into the night for survivors of the Thursday
afternoon crash, but feared the death toll would rise, said
Wenceslao Garcia Martinez, a Mexican Red Cross spokesman.
   The bus, belonging to the Zanacatepec y Ramales line, split in
half when it plunged into the Rio Paraje el Salto, Garcia Martinez
said in a telephone interview, adding that the cause of the crash
was not immediately known.
   The bus had just departed Valle de Bravo, about 70 miles west of
Mexico City, for the Mexico state capital of Toluca. The trip had
originated in Ixtapa del Oro.
   Red Cross and other emergency personnel were taking the injured
to hospitals and emergency clinics in Toluca, Ixtapan and Valle de
Bravo.
   Hospital officials said they could provide no information about
the condition of the victims and the names of the dead and injured
were not immediately available.

<HEAD>Sources Hint Treasury Secretary Could Quit To Oversee Bush
Campaign</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Treasury Secretary James A. Baker III may
resign his post this summer to oversee Vice President George Bush's
general-election campaign, administration and Bush campaign sources
are hinting.
   But the officials, who spoke only on the condition of anonymity,
said that such a move is unlikely to occur before the August 15-18
Republican convention in New Orleans and could depend on the
condition of the U.S. economy.
   Meanwhile, President Reagan may actively campaign for Bush even
before the GOP convention, according to presidential spokesman
Marlin Fitzwater.
   Fitzwater told reporters on Thursday that the president is
reconsidering his original vow to remain neutral until after the
convention now that Bush's only remaining opposition is a token
challenge from former television evangelist Pat Robertson.
   ``We could see the president involved in some political
activities before the nominating convention _ activities that are
directly associated with the nominee,'' Fitzwater said.
   The withdrawal this week of distant rival Sen. Bob Dole gave
Bush a virtual lock on the GOP nomination.
   Bush strategists are now focusing their attention on the fall
elections, and Baker may play an important role in that campaign.
   If Baker does come aboard, it won't be until around the time of
the convention, even though Bush is now certain to be the party's
nominee, said administration officials who spoke on the condition
of anonymity.
   There long has been talk that the treasury secretary, who
managed Bush's 1980 presidential bid and was senior advisor to the
1980 Reagan-Bush campaign, might step aside to help run his
longtime friend's campaign.
   Peter Teeley, a Bush campaign spokesman, said a discussion of
what role Baker might play in the Bush campaign, if any, was only
speculative at this time.
   But, Teeley added, ``Jim is very close to the vice president and
has been for a quarter of a century. There's no secret what their
relationship has been.''
   In the past, Baker has discouraged talk of an early resignation,
saying he was happy with his job as treasury secretary, one he has
held since 1985.
   However, on Thursday a Treasury spokesman, who refused to be
identified by name, would only say that there was no truth to
reports that Baker would quit by Aug. 1.
   Baker intends to go ahead with plans to participate in the
seven-nation economic summit in Toronto in late June,
administration officials said.
   Baker, who has built an international reputation in his current
post, is an experienced political tactician. The former Houston
attorney served as Reagan's chief of staff for four years before
becoming treasury secretary and in 1976 was chairman of President
Ford's re-election effort.
   Baker's role in the Bush campaign, and the timing involved in
such a move, could depend on how the economy performs over the next
few months.
   A deterioration in the economy could persuade Baker to stay on
as treasury secretary to oversee policies designed to head off an
election-year recession, some administration sources involved in
economic policy-making suggest.
   However, recent economic data have shown an economy rebounding
strongly from last October's stock market plunge.
   Baker could probably have any job in a Bush presidency that he
wanted, and there have been rumors for some time that he would like
to be secretary of state.
   Bush on Wednesday told reporters he intended to ``have a new
Cabinet'' if elected. The answer responded specifically to a query
on embattled Attorney General Edwin Meese III but might also be
taken as a signal that there would be a new treasury secretary in a
Bush presidency.
   Bush, back in town for several days following a three-day swing
through Wisconsin, met with Reagan for their regular weekly working
luncheon. Fitzwater said he did not know if campaign plans were
discussed.
   The president's spokesman said a decision on any presidential
campaign activity by Reagan in Bush's behalf before the convention
``has not been finally made, although ... the vice president is
very close to having the nomination.''
   ``Pat Robertson is still a candidate, in a declared sense, but
he too recognizes the realities of the situation,'' Fitzwater said.
   Bush is continuing with plans for campaign appearances in states
that have upcoming primaries and that will also be important in the
general election _ including New York, New Jersey, Ohio and
Pennsylvania.
   He also is planning fund-raising trips late next week to Texas
and Florida, states where he has already won primaries.

<HEAD>Senators Urge Shultz Not to Meet with PLO</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RUTH SINAI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A group of 21 senators is writing Secretary of
State George Shultz asking him to refrain from meeting with members
of the Palestine Liberation Organization during his upcoming trip
to the Middle East.
   The bipartisan group, including presidential hopeful Albert Gore
Jr., D-Tenn., still was collecting signatures on the petition and
planned to send the letter today. A similar letter was planned by
House members.
   Shultz left Washington on Thursday for Rome, and will continue
Sunday to the Middle East to lobby for acceptance of a U.S. plan
for Arab-Israeli peace talks.
   The senators slammed Shultz's meeting last Saturday in
Washington with two American university professors who are members
of the Palestine National Council, the PLO's parliamentary arm.
   Defending the meeting, Shultz said he wanted to hear the views
of Edward Said and Ibrahim Abu Lughod about Palestinian
representation in Mideast talks. He denied his meeting violated
U.S. law, which forbids negotiating with the PLO, saying that not
all members of the council are also members of the PLO.
   ``We see no distinction between the PLO and the PNC,'' the
senators wrote. ``We believe your action sets a dangerous
precedent.''
   Congress passed a law in 1985 banning talks with the PLO until
that organization recognizes Israel's right to exist and renounces
acts of terror. The law was based on U.S. assurances to Israel in
1975 that the United States would not deal with the PLO.
   ``If U.S. agreements are breached now, how can we expect the
government of Israel to accept future U.S. assurances concerning an
international peace conference?'' the letter said.
   Shultz has proposed giving Israel written assurances that an
international conference would only serve as an advisory forum for
direct Israeli-Arab talks and would not have the power to impose
solutions.
   The senators who signed the letter were: Christopher Bond,
R-Mo.; Quentin Burdick, D-N.D.; Alfonse D'Amato, R-N.Y.; Alan
Dixon, D-Ill.; Dennis DeConcini, D-Ariz.; Gore; Bob Graham, D-Fla.;
Charles Grassley, R-Iowa; John Heinz, R-Penn.; Gordon Humphrey,
R-N.H.; Daniel Inouye, D-Hawaii; David Karnes, R-Neb.; Bob Kasten,
R-Wis.; Frank Lautenberg, D-N.J.; Howard Metzenbaum, D-Ohio; John
Melcher, D-Mont.; Larry Pressler, R-S.D.; Jay Rockefeller, D-W.Va.;
William Roth, R-Del.; Richard Shelby, D-Ala.; and Pete Wilson,
R-Calif.

   Stock prices fell moderately Friday and the dollar
lost ground against the Japanese yen in Tokyo trading.
   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the Nikkei Stock Average of 225
selected issues fell 156.04 points, or 0.59 percent, to close the
day at 26,104.22 points.
   The dollar closed Friday at 124.10 yen, down 0.40 yen from
yesterday`s close of 124.50 yen.
   ``Nothing is happening here,'' said a dealer at a major U.S.
securities firm, speaking on condition of anonymity. ``It's the
Easter holiday and people are not doing anything.''
   The dealer said the dollar rebounded slightly following moderate
intervention by the Bank of Japan to prop up the sagging currency.
The bank does not publicly comment on its market activities.
   A trader at a major commercial bank in Tokyo said local market
participants are anticipating a weak dollar in the new 1988 fiscal
year which began Friday. Major stock markets around the world are
closed Friday.

<HEAD>U.S.-Japan Talks On Removal of Orange and Beef Import Quotas Fail</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United States says it will pursue a formal
trade complaint against Japan after a four-year agreement covering
Japanese import quotas on beef, oranges and orange juice expired
and talks produced no new accord.
   ``I am deeply disappointed that the Japanese did not come
forward with their proposal to liberalize trade on beef and
citrus,'' U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter said after
three days of talks here with Takashi Sato, Japanese minister of
agriculture, forestry and fisheries.
   Thursday was the last day of the agreement. As a result of the
failure, the United States will challenge the quotas as illegal
under international trading rules, opening the way to possible
trade penalties or other sanctions against Japan, Yeutter said.
   The United States has requested an emergency meeting of the
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade council next Friday in
Geneva, where it will request ``an independent GATT panel to be
formed to review our complaint,'' Yeutter said.
   Sato told reporters he and his delegation explained the
difficulties of liberalizing beef and citrus imports and ``tried to
obtain the understanding of the U.S. side for a more realistic
position but our efforts were not successful.''
   Talks on the issue will continue but no time or place was set,
Japanese spokesman Toshiyuki Takano said, and Sato plans to leave
Saturday for Japan.
   Under the 1984 quota agreement, Japan agreed to admit 141,000
tons of American beef that year, rising to 177,000 tons this year,
and to a 1,100-ton annual increase in the 1984 quota on U.S. orange
imports of 82,000 tons.
   The quotas are demanded by citrus and beef farmers who are
influential in Japan's governing Liberal-Democratic Party. U.S.
officials argue that Japanese consumers would benefit greatly from
cheaper U.S. oranges and meat and that the domestic producers
should adjust to imports just as several U.S. industries have had
to cope with Japanese competition.
   Yeutter said he is confident the Japanese quotas will be found
in violation of international trading rules because an earlier GATT
panel recently ruled Japanese quotas on 12 processed foods were
GATT-illegal. Japan at first ignored the ruling but it was
announced during Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita's January visit to
Washington that the country would abide by the decision.
   Officials of Takeshita's governing Liberal-Democratic Party said
recently Japan could not agree to further liberalization of beef
and citrus imports because it would threaten producers' livelihood.
   Although Japan is the largest purchaser of U.S. farm products,
the United States has been arguing that the country's remaining
import barriers cost Japanese consumers unreasonably high prices,
with beefsteak four times the U.S. price and citrus fruit at least
double the American cost.

<HEAD>Union Sues Texas Air, Says Eastern Being Dismantled In Anti-Labor
Move</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The owners of Eastern Airlines are trying to
dismantle the financially troubled passenger carrier in an effort
to break its unions, the union representing 13,000 Eastern workers
alleges in a federal lawsuit.
   The International Association of Machinists and Aerospace
Workers, AFL-CIO, filed the lawsuit in U.S. District Court here
Thursday. The 81-page complaint alleges that Frank Lorenzo's Texas
Air Corp. was trying to undermine the union's legal right to
represent Eastern employees by transferring the airline's assets to
other subsidiaries of the parent.
   The complaint charged that the transfer of some Eastern air
routes, planes and airport gate rights to other subsidiaries such
as Continental was part of a scheme to weaken the IAM's power to
represent Eastern employees.
   Such transactions violated the terms of a 1984 agreement that
the old Eastern Airlines management made with the IAM under which
union members received 20 percent of the company's stock in return
for wage concessions, the union said.
   Texas Air took over Eastern in 1986, but the union contends that
the airline's new owner is bound by the collective bargaining
agreement that set up the stock ownership plan.
   The lawsuit also charges a campaign of harassment of IAM members
as well as ``widespread and blatant'' violations of the labor
contract.
   Eastern spokeswoman Karen Ceremsak said the company would not
comment on the lawsuit until officials had a chance to read the
complaint.
   The union last month obtained a contempt citation against
Eastern for taking steps to sell its Northeast shuttle operation to
another subsidiary of Texas Air.
   The new lawsuit was assigned to U.S. District Judge John H.
Pratt, who last month ruled that the attempt to transfer the
shuttle operations flouted an earlier injunction he had issued
directing Eastern to maintain the working conditions of its
unionized employees.
   The IAM and Eastern are negotiating changes in the union
contract before federal mediators.
   The company was also ordered this week by another judge here not
to lease its planes to an independent cargo carrier to train
non-union pilots in the event Eastern's unionized pilots honor a
possible IAM strike this spring.

<HEAD>Daylight Time Returns Sunday</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A lot of people will be sleeping late Sunday,
but not out of a desire for extra rest.
   It's the day that daylight-saving time returns, meaning that
clocks should be shifted an hour forward.
   The change occurs at 2 a.m. Sunday, meaning most people probably
will want to set their clocks ahead one hour before retiring
Saturday night.
   Although known as ``daylight-saving time,'' the annual change
doesn't really save any daylight, or time.
   It simply moves an hour of light from morning to evening by
delaying the timing of both sunrise and sunset by an hour.
   That means that some children wind up waiting for school buses
in the dark, for example, in exchange for more time after school to
play ball or join the family in backyard cookouts.
   The idea has been attributed to various people, including
Benjamin Franklin, but it was William Willett of England who
launched the eventually successful campaign for the idea in 1907.
   More time for evening recreation, less need for costly
artificial lights and a possible reduction of evening crime were
cited as major advantages.
   It was the potential for energy savings that prompted first use
of daylight-saving time, in Germany in 1916. Other countries
followed during World War I, returning to standard time afterward
and resuming daylight time during World War II.
   It was simple confusion that finally led to the adoption of the
U.S. uniform time system in 1966. Previously, the tradition of
allowing local communities to decide for or against daylight time
had resulted in a crazy-quilt pattern of time differences.
   Today, daylight time is in effect in all areas of the country
except Arizona, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, American Samoa and
the part of Indiana in the Eastern time zone.
   Surveys have found that daylight time is generally more popular
in urban areas, where the afternoon and evening leisure time is
appreciated.
   Rural areas seem to be the focus of opposition, largely because
of the loss of morning light for travel to work and school and
adjusting to the change in dealing with livestock, since animals
don't observe differences in clocks.

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Residents of a northwestern English town, suckered
by an April Fools' Day gag, deluged local officials with telephone
complaints after a newspaper reported they would be made to buy
their own streetlight bulbs.
   In other teasers, a wildlife park in southeastern England said
it had launched a campaign to stop fish drowning and a left-wing
weekly said Labor Party leaders had been advised to take
assertiveness training.
   The national circulation newspaper Today reported in its April
Fools' editions that the rail tunnel under construction between
Britain and France will open next week, a remarkable five years
ahead of schedule.
   A four-page pull-out supplement in the paper bore the headline:
``Chunnel Opens 5 Years Early _ Exclusive leak on Britain's dig to
tunnel glory.''
   In northwest England the Wirral Globe's Friday edition, issued
on Thursday before the long Easter holiday weekend, said the
borough council was planning to make residents buy their own
lightbulbs for streetlamps as part of a cost-cutting campaign.
   The spoof front-page story prompted a flood of calls from
worried residents, and a lot of time was wasted calming them, said
the council's secretary, John Goodacre.
   In retaliation, the council canceled its advertising with the
weekly freesheet, which is delivered to 140,000 homes in the area.
The amount of lost advertising revenue was not disclosed.
   Globe editor Martin Hovden said: ``If we have upset anyone and
caused distress obviously I apologize. But we have had at least an
equal number of calls from people saying they enjoyed it.''
   He said the paper had been running April Fools' Day gags for 10
years.
   Other cost-cutting measures listed in the Globe's spoof report
included a ``snatch squad'' to force its way into homes to recover
unreturned books from the council's lending library and the closure
of local schools Mondays and Fridays.
   The national circulation newspaper The Independent, normally
serious-minded, reported: ``An elusive creature which is new to
British mammal records was photographed last week for the first
time, our rural affairs correspondent writes.''
   ``The creature has been provisionally nicknamed the Bogart by a
small group of conservationists, who have formed a society for its
preservation,'' it said.
   The paper printed a photograph of a man with a long pole
approaching a creature with a badger's head and a fox's tail
against a backdrop of snowy peaks in the Cumbrian hills of
northwest England.
   The date, April 1, appeared directly above.
   The left-wing weekly magazine New Statesmen purported to have a
leaked memorandum from Peter Mandelson, Labor's director of
communications, to Charles Clarke, a member of the staff of party
leader Neil Kinnock.
   The spoof had Mandelson saying Labor should seek a more abrasive
image and push its trade and industry spokesman Brian Gould out of
the public spotlight because he was seen as ``soft and cuddly.''
   Gould, who masterminded Labor's sophisticated campaign strategy
in last year's general election, is anything but soft.
   The story said Labor should call in a psychologist who had
advised soccer teams how to brush up their image and an
anthropologist to give key party members assertiveness training.
   Mandelson, in a real-life comment, dismissed the gag as
``light-hearted, clever and amusing _ if a little too clever by
half.''
   In southeast England, Alan Breeze, curator of the Brambles
wildlife park in Kent, insisted his rescue campaign to stop fish
drowning is an absolutely serious conservation measure to boost the
toad population.
   He said breeding toads will try to mate with almost anything and
will often cling to the backs of expensive fish like imported Koi
carp from Japan in ornamental ponds.
   He said large fish with up to six toads clinging on were known
to become exhausted, sink to the bottom of the pond and ``drown.''
   He didn't explain how fish can drown but he said the cure was to
use a feather to tickle the backs of the clinging toads, which are
an endangered species in some parts of the country, to make them
release their amorous grip.
   Breeze said he was experiencing difficulty getting people to
take the campaign seriously.

<TEXT>
   A failed effort to reinstate the most
serious of three impeachment charges against Gov. Evan Mecham has
set the stage for a Senate vote next week on whether he should be
removed from office.
   Senate Democrats on Thursday refused to go along with a move by
Republicans to revive the charge that the first-term GOP governor
concealed a $350,000 campaign loan _ a decision one senator called
``political roulette.''
   ``If there are not the votes to convict, and Governor Mecham is
back on the ninth floor (the governor's office) on Wednesday ...
they have dealt themselves a losing hand,'' said Sen. Tony West, a
Democrat and Mecham critic.
   The Senate has heard five weeks of evidence on the remaining two
charges: that Mecham tried to thwart investigation of an alleged
death threat by a state official and misused $80,000 from the
governor's protocol fund by loaning it to his auto dealership.
   The article of impeachment was dismissed Wednesday in a 16-12
vote supported by all 11 Democratic senators and five staunch GOP
supporters of Mecham. Some of his sharpest critics have been state
Republican leaders.
   The Senate, in recess for the Easter weekend, is to hear closing
arguments Monday, then vote on the charges later that day or
Tuesday.
   Although many senators said they had not decided how to vote,
GOP Sen. Bill DeLong said he thought most had made up their minds.
   ``There's more than just the guilt or innocence on the
charges,'' DeLong said. He said he expected senators would also be
asked to act in the best interests of the state.
   Sen. Greg Lunn, also a Republican, said dismissing the third
charge increased the chance of Mecham being acquitted because the
charge involving the $350,000 loan ``was the most damning.''
   The charge was considered the most damaging partly because
Mecham signed a letter promising the loan would remain confidential.
   Democrats argued that a Senate trial on the charge could damage
Mecham's right to a fair trial in criminal court on similar charges
April 21. They also worried that hearing the charge would extend
the Senate trial past the May 17 date of Mecham's recall election.
   If the Senate votes to convict Mecham on either article, he
would be automatically removed from office. Senators also could
vote on whether to bar him from holding any future office.
   An acquittal would immediately return the governor to the office
he gave up Feb. 5 when he was impeached by the House. Secretary of
State Rose Mofford, a Democrat, has been acting governor since then.
   A two-thirds vote of the 30-member Senate is required to convict.
   Mecham, 63, is the first U.S. governor to be impeached in six
decades and the first ever in Arizona.
   A political outsider who took office in January 1987, Mecham has
insisted that he is innocent of all wrongdoing and that he is being
persecuted by the state GOP establishment and the media.
   Mecham sparked controversy by canceling a Martin Luther King
holiday for state workers, and has made comments that angered
blacks, homosexuals, women, Jews and Japanese.

   Police used water cannons and clubs to
scatter scores of dissidents protesting lack of progress in the
investigation of the killing three years ago of three communist
activists.
   Reporters and witnesses saw at least 30 protesters being
detained during the demonstration Thursday.
   The protesters gathered at a plaza across the street from the
government palace in downtown Santiago, carrying signs and chanting
anti-government slogans. The group included the widows of the three
slain communists.
   Jose Manuel Parada, Santiago Natino and Manuel Guerrero were
abducted on March 29, 1985. Their bodies were found with their
throats slit two days later near the Santiago airport.
   Four months later, a civilian judge indicted 12 members of the
national police, including two colonels, in the kidnappings but not
in the killings. The charges eventually were dropped by the Supreme
Court and the case remains open.

   Twenty gunmen attacked an Indian
reserve in an Amazon jungle area claimed by wealthy landowners,
killing at least three Indians, wounding 20 and leaving 15 missing,
the National Indian Foundation reported.
   The official report Thursday was disputed by the National
Indigenous Council, an Indian rights group associated with Brazil's
National Catholic Bishop's Conference, which set the number of dead
at 12, including some children, and 21 injured.
   The foundation said the attack took place Monday on the Tikuna
Indian reserve in Benjamin Constant, a town 3,700 miles northwest
of Rio de Janeiro near the border with Colombia.
   Foundation president Romero Juca told reporters Thursday that
the federal police had been called in to investigate the attack.
   The shootings appeared linked to a dispute between the
foundation and landowners for control of the region, which is rich
in mineral deposits and timber.
   According to Juca, the foundation marked off 298,870 acres as
Tikuna territory in 1984, but white landowners have not accepted
the compensation paid by the government and stayed in the area.
   The National Indigenous Council said about 20,000 Tikuna Indians
live in and around Benjamin Constant.
   There are about 220,000 Indians in Brazil, most of whom live in
the Amazon jungle.

   A former New York congressman says the
uncommitted delegate slate he's part of for the state's April 19
Democratic presidential primary hopes ``to persuade the (national)
convention to go for Mario Cuomo.''
   ``We think he would be, by far, the strongest, most inspiring
candidate that we could put up,'' Democrat Richard Ottinger said of
the New York governor during an interview Thursday with WVOX and
WRTN radio stations.
   The uncommitted slate of delegates was put together by a group
of upstate New York elected Democratic county clerks, many of whom
hoped Cuomo would join the race.

   Albert Gore Sr. says he almost got the
Democratic vice presidential nomination more than three decades ago
_ and he hopes his son won't settle for the No. 2 spot because it
is ``dead-end street.''
   Gore, 80, said he would not recommend that his son, Tennessee
Sen. Albert Gore Jr., flirt with the vice presidency even if he
fails to become the Democratic presidential nominee.
   ``It's a dead-end street,'' the elder Gore, who recalled
unsuccessfully seeking the 1956 vice presidential nomination, told
the Wausau Daily Herald in an interview Wednesday.
   ``And I have serious doubts that ... the other contestants for
the presidency can win, and who would want to be second on the
losing ticket?''
   The elder Gore also had doubts about the vice presidential job
for his son even if the Democrats win because it would be ``a
do-nothing position.''

<HEAD>Study: Married Voters Favor Republicans</HEAD>
<DATELINE>COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Married voters tend to vote for
Republicans in presidential elections, a study by an Ohio State
University political science professor concludes.
   The research by Herbert Weisberg showed that 10 percent to 15
percent more married people than unmarried ones favor Republicans,
partly because Republicans in recent years have emphasized family
issues.
   ``The Republicans have been holding the edge in the marriage gap
for some time,'' Weisberg said. ``The question will be whether
either party finds a way to exploit it.''
   Married people are in the majority and are more likely to vote
than unmarried people because more people vote once they have a
bigger stake in the community, Weisberg said.

<HEAD>21 Pulitzers Awarded For Achievement In Journalism And The Arts</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICK HAMPSON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Charlotte Observer's dogged coverage of the
PTL financial scandal, scorned by Jim and Tammy Bakker and many
readers, earned the Pulitzer Prize for public service, journalism's
highest honor.
   In the arts, Toni Morrison's novel of a former slave,
``Beloved,'' won the Pulitzer for fiction, a category closely
watched after the book failed to win two other prestigious awards
for which it was nominated.
   Alfred Uhry's first non-musical play, ``Driving Miss Daisy,''
won the drama prize and Richard Rhodes was awarded the non-fiction
prize for his book, ``The Making of the Atomic Bomb.''
   The Charlotte Observer, The Wall Street Journal and the Miami
Herald each won two awards.
   The Knight-Ridder newspaper group won six in all, with the
Observer's two, the Herald's two and one each for the Philadelphia
Inquirer and the St. Paul Pioneer Press Dispatch. A total of 21
Pulitzers were awarded Thursday for achievement in the arts and
journalism.
   The Observer revealed misuse of funds by the PTL ministry
``through persistent coverage conducted in the face of a massive
campaign by PTL to discredit the newspaper,'' the Pulitzer board
said.
   The Observer's Managing Editor Mark Ethridge III said the real
reward was winning over readers who had denounced the newspaper's
efforts.
   ``The thing that gratifies us the most of all about PTL are the
folks who have written us and said, `Two years ago, I wrote you and
said you all were going to hell. ... Now, I want to say I'm wrong
and keep up the reporting,''' Ethridge said.
   The paper won the public service award in 1981 for its coverage
of ``brown lung'' among textile workers.
   The Miami Herald's Michel duCille won the feature photography
prize for photographs of the decay and rehabilitation of a housing
project inundated by the drug crack. He also won a prize for spot
news photography two years ago.
   The Herald's humor columnist, Dave Barry, won the prize for
commentary for his ``consistently effective use of humor as a
device for presenting fresh insights into serious concerns.''
   ``It's fun to win a Pulitzer, everybody should do it,'' Barry
said.
   The Wall Street Journal's two prizes came in explanatory
journalism and specialized reporting.
   The paper's Daniel Hertzberg and James B. Stewart won for
stories about an investment banker charged with insider trading and
about the day after the October stock market crash. Walt Bogdanich
won the specialized reporting prize for a series on faulty testing
by medical laboratories.
   Winners generally sounded giddy.
   ``Several people in the newsroom just took a champagne bath,''
said Jacqui Banaszynski of the St. Paul Pioneer Press Dispatch, who
won the prize in feature writing for her series on an AIDS victim
in a farm community.
   ``There was a lot of dancing and yelling and singing when the
announcement came over the wire _ but that's not unusual for the
Journal newsroom,'' said Jim Tharpe, managing editor of the Alabama
Journal in Montgomery, which won in general news for its
investigation of the state's unusually high infant mortality rate.
   The Lawrence (Mass.) Eagle-Tribune also won in general news for
stories that showed flaws in the Massachusetts prison furlough
system.
   Tom Shales of the Washington Post won the criticism award for
his writings on television.
   Ms. Morrison acknowledged the controversy surrounding her book
after it failed to win the National Book Award and the National
Book Critics Circle Award last fall. In January, 48 black writers
and critics signed an open letter deploring the lack of national
recognition of her book.
   But the chairman of the Pulitzer fiction jury, Rutgers
University professor Julian Moynahan, said jurors made their
recommendations six weeks before the letter was published and felt
no pressure to recommend Ms. Morrison's book.
   ``I am glad that the merits of the book were allowed to surface
and be the only consideration of the Pulitzer Prize committee,''
Morrison said.
   Other awards in journalism:
   _ National reporting, to Tim Weiner of the Inquirer for a series
on a secret Pentagon budget used to sponsor defense research and an
arms buildup. He was part of a Kansas City Times and Kansas City
Star team that won a Pulitzer in 1982 for general news reporting.
   _ Investigative reporting, to the Chicago Tribune's Dean Baquet,
William Gaines and Ann Marie Lipinski for stories on ``the
self-interest and waste that plagued Chicago's City Council.''
   _ International reporting, to Thomas L. Friedman of The New York
Times for what the Pulitzer board termed ``balanced and informed
coverage of Israel.'' _ Editorial writing, to Jane Healy of The
Orlando Sentinel for editorials that protested overdevelopment of
Florida's Orange County.
   _ Editorial cartooning, to Doug Marlette of the Atlanta
Constitution and the Charlotte Observer.
   _ Spot news photography, to Scott Shaw of the Odessa (Texas)
American for his pictures of little Jessica McClure being rescued
from the well into which she had fallen.
   Other arts awards included:
   _ History, ``The Launching of Modern American Science
1846-1876,'' by Robert V. Bruce.
   _ Biography, ``Look Homeward: A Life of Thomas Wolfe,'' by David
Herbert Donald.
   _ Poetry, ``Partial Accounts: New and Selected Poems,'' by
William Meredith.
   _ Music, ``12 Etudes for Piano,'' by William Bolcom.
   Winners are selected by the Pulitzer board, which is guided by,
but not obligated to restrict itself to, a series of finalists
submitted by nominating juries in the various categories.
   Except for the award for public service, which brings with it a
gold medal, Pulitzers carry a cash prize of $3,000. The winners are
announced by the president of Columbia University, which
administers the competition.

<HEAD>CDC Recommends Measles Vaccine For All AIDS-Infected Kids</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BYRD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal health officials say children infected
with the virus that causes AIDS should receive measles vaccine,
since their risk of severe measles is worse than their risk of
complications from the vaccine.
   The Immunization Practices Advisory Committee of the U.S.
Centers for Disease Control said Thursday that children infected
with the virus that causes AIDS should receive the common
measles-mumps-rubella vaccine, whether or not they show signs of
the devastating symptoms of AIDS itself.
   Previously, the committee had recommended that children showing
AIDS symptoms should not be vaccinated, because their immune
systems might be too severely harmed to tolerate the live-virus
measles vaccine.
   The new CDC recommendation, consistent with recommendations by
the World Health Organization, is an ``approach to protect the
HIV-infected child,'' the Atlanta-based agency said in its weekly
report.
   Complication from measles vaccine in children infected with HIV
_ human immunodeficiency virus, the virus that causes AIDS _
``hasn't happened,'' said Dr. Lauri Markowitz, a CDC measles
specialist.
   However, she noted, ``We have had several cases of measles in
these children, and it's felt that the benefit of getting the
vaccine outweighs the risk.''
   In 1986 and '87, at least six cases of measles occurred in
children infected with AIDS virus, the CDC reported; two of those
children died, in the first U.S. measles deaths reported to CDC
since 1985. The other four measles cases were severe.
   None of the six measles cases was believed linked to measles
vaccine. Only one of the six children had received measles vaccine,
and that was five years before he became ill.
   It is hoped measles vaccinations will be effective in
HIV-infected children, although new studies seem to show that those
children, with their weakened immune systems, may not respond to
the vaccine as well as healthy children, Ms. Markowitz said.
   The CDC has reported 913 cases of AIDS itself in children under
13. Researchers believe that more are infected with the virus that
causes AIDS, but have not yet developed the disease _ and may never.
   AIDS, or acquired immune deficiency syndrome, cripples the boy's
immune system, leaving victims susceptible to a wide spectrum of
infections and cancers. The CDC has recorded 57,024 AIDS cases of
the disease since 1981.

   Residents of this quiet town, where
``everybody knows everybody,'' were stunned and scared after a
young woman said a group of men raped her repeatedly while
onlookers ignored her pleas.
   ``It's something horrible,'' said Jesse Castanon, owner of the
J.C. Windmill Restaurant on State Highway 44, the main road through
this South Texas county seat about 70 miles west of Corpus Christi.
   ``I don't know how to explain it to you because all of the
people are shocked because this never happened here,'' Castanon
said. He said he knew most of the 11 men arrested in the case.
   Four men were arrested and three surrendered to police Thursday,
said Duval County Assistant District Attorney Rodolfo Gutierrez.
Four others were arrested Wednesday. The suspects, 21 to 29 years
old, were charged with rape, kidnapping or rape and kidnapping.
Bonds were set at $20,000 to $50,000.
   ``Some of them we've brought in have admitted it. Some are not
talking,'' said Ricardo Carrillo, another assistant district
attorney.
   There may be more arrests, and the Texas Rangers will help local
authorities in the investigation, according to Jerry Galvan, an
investigator with the district attorney's office.
   San Diego, with a population of about 5,200 people, sits in
rolling hills covered with mesquite trees. Ranching, oil and
uranium mining are major industries in the area, but the biggest
employer is the county. Like many small South Texas towns, the
dominant buildings are the courthouse and the Roman Catholic church.
   ``You expect something like this to happen in Corpus (Christi)
or San Antonio or Dallas, but not in San Diego,'' said a woman, who
asked not to be identified because ``everybody knows everybody.''
   The 19-year-old victim told authorities she was walking home
Saturday night after visiting a relative when four men forced her
into a car and took her to a ranch north of town.
   She said the four and several others repeatedly raped her for
several hours in the back seat of a car while as many as 30 people
attending an illegal cockfight either ignored her pleas or joined
the attack.
   ``Some were holding her by the legs and by the arms, and some
were covering her eyes and mouth,'' Carrillo said.
   The mother of two said several of the men took her to another
remote location and raped her again before releasing her.
   Gutierrez said the woman knew some of her attackers and that
others were identified by witnesses, including a 12-year-old boy.
   ``The 12-year-old said (the victim) was screaming and crying and
told them to take her home,'' Gutierrez told the Corpus Christi
Caller-Times. ``They were just watching ... and she kept calling
for help.''
   The woman was treated at a Corpus Christi hospital and released
earlier this week.
   Carrillo said the woman's husband, who spent all night looking
for her after she disappeared, persuaded her to file charges Monday.
   Gutierrez said that people who stood by and did nothing may not
have been legally responsible for what happened, but said they were
morally obliged to help the woman.
   Schoolteacher Johnny Salinas said he wasn't surprised that
onlookers did nothing to help.
   ``These people feel a kinship with each other,'' he told the
Caller-Times. ``I would have tried to stop it, but then again you
might be afraid to try because you'd get beat up.''
   A 77-year-old woman told the newspaper she was appalled that no
one came forward to help.
   ``Poor girl, no one deserves anything like this,'' said
Esperanza Ibanez. ``What kind of barbarians would have done this to
her?''

<HEAD>Price Tag For Honduras Exercise To Top $5 Million</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The price tag for last month's deployment of
more than 3,100 American troops to Honduras is likely to be
somewhere between $5 million and $10 million, the Pentagon says.
   Spokesman Dan Howard gave the estimate Thursday but said final
figures won't be available for 30 to 60 days.
   Howard said the last soldiers from the 82nd Airborne Division
had returned home to Fort Bragg, N.C., Thursday morning and that
some ``logistical support people'' would be returning today.
   Soldiers from the 82nd Airborne and the 7th Light Infantry
Division at Fort Ord, Calif., were airlifted on March 17 and 18
after Nicaraguan troops crossed into Honduras to mount an attack on
U.S.-backed Contra guerrillas.

<HEAD>Hospitals Won't Get Higher Medicare Payments For Anti-Clotting
Drug</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hospitals won't be getting bigger Medicare
payments to help offset the costs to treat heart attack victims
with the expensive new anti-clotting drug called TPA.
   The decision was made public Thursday in a letter from Medicare
chief William L. Roper to the American Hospital Association.
   ``There is a question as to whether the circumstances involving
TPA are so unique as to justify some special accommodation,'' Roper
wrote. ``We have concluded that they are not.''
   Hospitals have been pressing the Health Care Financing
Administration to take into account the high cost of TPA _ which
runs about $2,000 a dose _ in paying for the treatment of heart
attack victims.
   Medicare pays hospitals a flat, predetermined amount for
treatment of various illnesses rather than reimbursing hospitals
for itemized expenses used on a particular patient.

   The remains of 27 Americans missing since the
end of the Vietnam War will be turned over to U.S. official in
Hanoi next week and then flown to an Army identification laboratory
in Hawaii, the Pentagon says.
   The planned return of American remains is largest repatriation
by the Vietnamese government since the end of the war. Previously,
the largest turnover of remains was 26 on Aug. 14, 1985.
   U.S. officials in Hanoi will receive the remains on Wednesday.
Then they will be moved to the Army's Central Identification
Laboratory in Honolulu, Hawaii, for identification, Pentagon
spokesman Dan Howard said Thursday.
   There are currently 2,404 Americans still listed as missing in
Indochina as a result of the Vietnam War, of whom 1,767 are listed
as missing in either North or South Vietnam. Up to now, the remains
of 152 Americans have been repatriated to the United States and

   A racial discrimination complaint filed by
more than 100 black Agriculture Department employees alleges bias
in promotions and merit awards and claims top agency officials
ignored earlier complaints.
   The complaint, filed Thursday with the department's Equal
Employment Officer, involved grievances in the Foreign Agricultural
Service, said John Franke Jr., assistant agriculture secretary for
administration.
   The complaint, signed by a large majority of the foreign
service's fulltime black professional and clerical staff, charged
top department officials with ignoring earlier complaints regarding
placement of whites over blacks in coveted positions. The employees
said blacks continue to be denied career advancement, choice
overseas assignments and to be underrepresented in merit awards.

<HEAD>Iran Claims More Iraqi Chemical Attacks, Launches Missile Attack</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ED BLANCHE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Iran launched a missile attack today on
Kirkuk, Iraq's northern oil capital, and said 75 people have been
killed and more than 100 wounded in new Iraqi chemical bomb attacks
on Kurdish villages.
   Iran's official Islamic Republic News Agency said Iraqi
warplanes dropped bombs containing mustard and nerve gases in the
Qara Dagh region of northeastern Iraq during the six days that
ended Saturday.
   It quoted Iranian-backed Kurdish guerrilla sources as saying the
villages of Susiyan, Doukan, Balakha, Jafaran and Oliyan were hit.
   There was no independent confirmation and no comment by Baghdad,
which has been fighting a brutal mountain war against the Kurdish
guerrillas, who seek an independent homeland.
   Qara Dagh is 15 miles west of the front in a two-week-old
Iranian offensive into the Kurdistan mountains, where Iran claims
Iraqi warplanes dropped cyanide and mustard gas bombs March 16-17
on three Kurdish towns ``liberated'' in the push. Iran claims 5,000
civilians were killed and 5,000 injured.
   Western correspondents who visited one of the towns, Halabja,
last week reported seeing hundreds of bodies unmarked by bullet or
shrapnel wounds. Hundreds more Iraqi Kurds with severe burns and
respiratory ailments consistent with exposure to poison gas have
been seen in Tehran hospitals.
   IRNA claimed Thursday that Iraqi warplanes also dropped chemical
bombs on Marivan in northwestern Iran, killing ``a number'' of
civilians.
   Meanwhile, Iranian Revolutionary Guards were reported advancing
westward through Kurdistan and said they bottled up 5,000 Iraqis
around a hydroelectric dam on Lake Darbandikhan, 80 miles east of
Iraq's big Kirkuk oilfields.
   The Iranian missile strike on Kirkuk was announced after Iraq
declared it would halt its missile attacks on Iranian cities for
three days beginning today as Prime Minister Turgut Ozal of Turkey
visits Baghdad.
   IRNA said two missiles were fired at a ``military target'' in
Kirkuk city early today ``in retaliation for Iraqi missile attacks
on Iran's residential areas.''
   The official Iraqi News Agency, also monitored in Nicosia, only
reported one missile hitting Kirkuk, saying it exploded in a
residential district, killing or wounding ``many civilians,
including women and children.''
   The missile struck only a half-hour after the time Iraqi said it
would stop missile attacks. Ozal was to arrive in Baghdad this
afternoon.
   Iraq sent three long-range missiles Thursday into the holy city
of Qom 100 miles south of Tehran and the central city of Isfahan.
   There was no official response from Tehran when Iraq announced
Thursday that it would halt its missile attacks at midnight Baghdad
time. But an Iranian embassy spokesman in Ankara, Turkey's capital,
said Thursday that his country's attacks on Iraqi cities would
``automatically come to an end'' if the Iraqis stopped their air
and missile strikes.
   Both sides have fired more than 250 missiles into each other's
cities since Feb. 29, killing hundreds of civilians.
   On that day that the ``war of the cities'' flared anew, Ozal was
visiting Tehran and several missiles exploded near the downtown
hotel where his delegation was staying.
   Iraq said the latest truce would last until Ozal's Baghdad visit
ends. Officials in Ankara said he would fly home Sunday.
   Turkey maintains good relations with both belligerents and has
in the past tried to mediate an end to their 7-year-old war.
   Associated Press photographer Greg English reported from
Kurdistan that Iran's Revolutionary Guards were pushing westward in
the offensive launched March 16.
   English, among a group of Western correspondents flown to the
battle zone Thursday, reported from the Kurdish town of Dojaila
that artillery rumbled to the west and it was clear ``the Iranians
have made significant gains.''
   The Iranians claim their forces occupy the eastern and southern
shores of Lake Darbandikhan and hills overlooking the strategic dam
and power station on the lake's southern tip, where they say they
have surrounded 5,000 Iraqis who apparently still hold the dam.

   A defiant Jimmy Swaggart probably will
leave the Assemblies of God rather than obey the church's one-year
banishment from his television ministry, says a member of the
denomination's Louisiana council.
   Swaggart cited the Louisiana District Council's recommendation
for a more lenient three-month ban when he said through his lawyer
Wednesday that he would defy the national leadership and return to
the pulpit on May 22.
   The 19-member district council was to meet today at Jimmy
Swaggart World Ministries to discuss the case, but Swaggart had not
been asked to attend and didn't plan to, said his lawyer, Bill
Treeby.
   One member of the Louisiana council said there was little it
could do to fight the presbytery's harsher penalty, which includes
two years of church-supervised counseling, and Swaggart probably
would leave the Assemblies.
   ``The executive presbytery may not have the right to discipline
him, but they have the power,'' the Rev. Ansley Orfila of Slidell
told the Springfield (Mo.) News-Leader. ``I don't think we'll meet
to defy them. Maybe it will be just to decide how to handle
things.''
   Assemblies General Superintendent G. Raymond Carlson said
Swaggart probably will be expelled from the denomination if he
ignores the national body's sterner penalty.
   The Rev. Forrest Hall, secretary-treasurer of the Louisiana
District Council, said the state body probably will support the
national recommendation.
   Swaggart left the pulpit Feb. 21 after tearfully confessing to
an undisclosed sin. A prostitute has said Swaggart paid her to pose
nude for him.
   Treeby said there was a conflict within the Assemblies, the
nation's largest Pentecostal denomination, over whether the
national presbytery or the Louisiana council has the right to
discipline Swaggart.
   ``He is willing to submit himself to the Louisiana District,''
Treeby said Wednesday. ``He will be considering an appeal to the
national presbytery.''
   State church officials decided on today's meeting, the
News-Leader reported, shortly after the church's national officials
announced Tuesday that they had rejected the three-month ban as too
lenient.

<HEAD>Rain Mainly on the Plains; Light Snow in Rockies</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   A storm that whipped up a tornado, hail and wind gusts up to 59
mph in Texas and New Mexico spread rain and snow today across the
Great Plains.
   A tornado touched down Thursday evening northwest of Hobbs,
N.M., damaging an unoccupied barn and house trailer.
   In northwest Texas, golfball-size hail fell near Woodrow,
Brownfield, Post and Denver City. Two inches of penny-size hail
covered the ground at Odonnell late Thursday. Lubbock recorded a
wind gust of 59 mph.
   The southerly flow of moist air from the Gulf of Mexico brought
heavy rain to some areas. More than 2.5 inches fell late Thursday
near Walnut and Cherryvale, Kan.
   Forecasters posted flash flood watches for much of southeast
Kansas, parts of Oklahoma and parts of Mississippi.
   The rainfall at Wichita Falls, Texas, brought the total rainfall
for March to 5.24 inches, its wettest month on record. The previous
record was 4.71 inches set in 1905.
   Omaha, Neb., however, had its driest March since 1910 with just
.07 inches of rain, but forecasters said substantial rainfall was
expected through Saturday.
   Snow continued this morning in parts of the southern Rockies.
Albuquerque, N.M., had 4 inches of snow on the ground by midnight
and Edgewood, N.M., had 7 inches.
   In Colorado, the storm began easing after dropping 20 inches of
snow at Rye, 15 inches at Buelah, 13 inches at Silver Cliff and 9
inches east of Salida. Seven inches fell on the Denver area.
Forecasters predicted another 1 to 4 inches of snow in Colorado
today.
   A snow advisory was posted for northwestern Kansas, and a freeze
warning was in effect in southeast Arizona above elevations of
4,000 feet.
   Today's forecast called for widespread rain and thunderstorms
across Kansas, Oklahoma, parts of Texas and the Mississippi and
Tennessee valleys; showers and a few thundershowers from the Ohio
Valley to the middle Atlantic Coast and across southern Michigan
and New York state; thunderstorms from Alabama into the western
Carolinas; snow across Colorado, northern New Mexico, parts of the
Texas and Oklahoma panhandles and northwest Kansas.
   Highs will be in the 50s or 60s in much of the nation; 30s and
40s from the central High Plains and the Texas panhandle across the
central Rockies to northern Arizona, and Michigan to northern
Minnesota; 70s and low 80s from California to the desert Southwest,
and from southern and eastern Texas across the lower Mississippi
and Tennessee valleys and the southern Appalachians to the south
Atlantic states.
   The high for the nation Thursday was 91 degrees at Presidio,
Texas.
   Temperatures around the nation at 2 a.m. EST ranged from 9
degrees at Yellowstone Park, Wyo., to 75 degrees at Key West, Fla.

<HEAD>Driscoll Farmer Asks FmHA For Farm Back</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The government foreclosed on his farm,
evicted him from the land and burned down his home, but Albert
Schumaker wants to buy back the place.
   ``There was just poor judgment on somebody's part'' to burn the
house down in January, Schumaker said Thursday as he asked the
Farmers Home Administration to rebuild his home and let him buy
back part of the 2,460-acre farm.
   The 58-year-old farmer, wearing a western hat and accompanied by
10 supporters, made his application at the FmHA's Burleigh County
office here.
   Schumaker said he could raise the $25,000 to $30,000 he
estimates he'll need to buy back his farmstead and 10 acres in
Driscoll, about 30 miles east of Bismarck.
   ``There (are) people pretty disgusted about the whole thing and
will put the money out,'' he said. In addition, a petition is
circulating calling for the ouster of some state and local FmHA
officials, Schumaker said.
   Schumaker, a farmer since 1959, said he hopes to eventually buy
back all the acerage he lost through foreclosure. ``I have two
boys, (ages) 32 and 36, and they were with the operation. My boys
might be eligible for a loan.''
   The FmHA acquired Schumaker's farm in March 1986 in a
foreclosure, said Burleigh County FmHA Supervisor Sterling Breuer.
Schumaker was evicted from his home in December.
   The home, a corn crib and a garage were burned Jan. 30, Breuer
said. Two barns and six steel grain bins were left standing. Breuer
said the house was destroyed because repairs to bring it in line
with agency standards would have cost too much.
   Schumaker said he didn't learn about the fire until three days
after it happened. ``That's about the last kick they can give you
after you lose a farm,'' he said.
   Schumaker said the kitchen had been remodeled, and new windows,
a furnace and water heater had been installed. ``All the neighbors
knew it was livable and a good house,'' he said.
   These days he lives in a mobile home near Driscoll, and works
for Farmers Livestock Exchange as a cattle consignor.
   Schumaker made his application under the Dwelling Retention
Program, part of the Agricultural Credit Act that Congress passed
in December calling on FmHA, the lender of last resort for farmers,
to go easier on growers behind in their payments.
   Schumaker claims the agency violated his rights to retain the
farmstead when it burned down his home.
   Bob Zimmerman, head of FmHA farmer programs in North Dakota,
said the agency would consider Schumaker's application, but said he
was unsure whether the agency was liable for rebuilding the home.
   At the time of the burning, one law was being phased out and
another was being phased in, Zimmerman said.
   FmHA had not received regulations for the dwelling retention
program, he said. The agency was told Jan. 7 to stop certain
foreclosures and liquidations, but received no instructions on
situations like Schumaker's, where land was already in FmHA hands,
Zimmerman said.
   However, Don Vig, vice chairman of the Dakota Resource Council,
an advocacy group for farmers and landowners, said FmHA should have
known about the new law when it burned Schumaker's buildings.
   ``How is it possible for employees of a federal agency to be
totally ignorant of the laws that they are supposed to be
implementing?'' asked Vig.

   Motorola Inc., fined $16.7 million for
allegedly overbilling the government on defense contracts, said it
is disciplining 59 employees involved in the incident.
   The company notified the employees last week when the $16.7
million settlement with the government was announced, spokesman
Mario Salvadori said Thursday.
   The company said 20 managers were dismissed or had their
salaries frozen or were denied promotions. The other 39 employees
were told that if they failed to follow company rules they would be
fired.
   The $16.7 million in civil and criminal penalties and
restitution stemmed from charges that the company's Government
Electronics Group in Scottsdale, Ariz., had mischarged the
government $2.5 million on three programs in 1983.
   All of the employees investigated in the case work in Arizona.
Salvadori said he did not know how many of the managers were
dismissed. The government has said that criminal charges against
individuals are still possible.

   In a strategic shift, Secretary of State George P.
Shultz said he is exploring with the Soviet Union arrangements for
continuing U.S. and Soviet military aid to rival forces in
Afghanistan.
   The proposed compromise on Afghan aid would remove the only
major roadblock to a negotiated settlement of that country's
8-year-old war and the withdrawal of the Red Army, which has been
propping up the Marxist government in Kabul.
   ``It would be better to have a moratorium,'' Shultz said.
   But, he added, ``to date the Soviets have not wanted to do
that.``
   Shultz also said that in meetings this weekend with Italian
officials he planned to discuss moving dozens of U.S. fighter
planes to Italy from Spain.
   He heads for the Middle East on Sunday to continue efforts to
spur Arab-Israeli negotiations.
   The issue of U.S. aid to Afghan guerrillas and Soviet aid to the
Kabul government has become an impediment to improved superpower
relations and one of the key regional disputes confronting planners
of the planned superpower summit in Moscow in late May.
   Shultz made it clear he preferred a suspension of Soviet aid to
the Kabul regime and a matching cut-off of U.S. support for the
resistance groups. American weapons have included Stinger missiles
that have been effective against Soviet planes and helicopters.
   But Shultz said the overall goal was ``a balanced outcome.'' He
said there was nothing in peace accords being drafted in Geneva
``that tells us we cannot support our friends.
   ``If the Soviets exercise restraint, we are prepared to exercise
restraint,'' he said.
   Shultz said he did not know whether the Soviets would go along
with the equal levels of aid to the two sides. But he stressed the
United States was prepared to guarantee a settlement even while
weapons keep flowing to the combatants.
   ``If we have signed the accords and see a need to support our
friends we will be able to do it,'' he said.
   Shultz said he discussed the idea on the telephone Wednesday
with Pakistani Foreign Minister Mohammad Khan Junejo and that
country's president, Mohammad Zia ul-Haq, then called President
Reagan.
   ``So these things are in place,'' Shultz said. ``Where we will
all come out remains to be seen.''
   The United States, the Soviet Union, their clients in
Afghanistan and the government of neighboring Pakistan, have been
involved for months in U.N.-sponsored efforts to bring about a
withdrawal of the estimated 115,000 Soviet troops fighting in
Afghanistan since the Kremlin intervened in December 1979.
   Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze said in an
interview released Thursday that he would not be surprised if
Afghanistan peace talks fail and he accused the United States and
Pakistan of blocking their success.
   Shevardnadze said that if U.N.-mediated talks in Geneva fail,
the Soviet Union will withdraw its troops ``in a way convenient for
the government of Afghanistan and ourselves.''
   He did not indicate whether the Soviet Union would stick to the
nine-month withdrawal timetable already agreed to in Geneva.
   Talks aimed at ending the war in Afghanistan recessed for the
Easter holiday. They are scheduled to resume Monday, but informal
contacts were expected over the weekend.
   Shultz said he would spend the weekend in Rome for Easter
observances and to confer with Italian officials. The main topic is
finding a new home for 72 U.S. F-16 jet fighter planes Spain is
evicting in 1991. Italy is a prime candidate to take them.
   Shultz did not predict how he would make out in the Middle East
next week, but he was cautiously upbeat, particularly about King
Hussein of Jordan. His trip last month failed to bring agreement.
   ``The Jordanians are quite intrigued with this,'' Shultz said,
``and I look forward to intensive discussions`` with King Hussein.
   ``I think we have a chance to see some motion,'' Shultz said of
his shuttling to Israel, Jordan, Syria, Egypt and Saudi Arabia.

   The last time foreign correspondent Thomas L.
Friedman won a Pulitzer Prize he said the moment was marred because
he received the news while covering the bombing of the American
Embassy in Beirut.
   On Thursday, though, the second Pulitzer for international
reporting for The New York Times writer was ``unalloyed, untinged
by any tragedy,'' Friedman said as he and others winners across the
country celebrated their honors.
   In 1983, Friedman, then the Beirut bureau chief for the Times,
was told of the award he received for his stories about the Israeli
invasion of Lebanon as he was covering the embassy disaster.
   ``It was a moment very much bittersweet for someone living in
Beirut, with friends in the embassy,'' he said.
   This time, he received a telephone call from Max Frankel, the
Times' executive editor, as he worked on a book at his home in
Jerusalem.
   Champagne corks popped in newsrooms across the land.
   ``If I can win the Pulitzer Prize, the Cleveland Indians can win
the pennant this summer,'' said the Wall Street Journal's Walt
Bogdanich, who won for specialized reporting. WSJ writers Daniel
Hertzberg and James B. Stewart also won for explanatory journalism.
   ``This place looks like a locker room after a World Series
victoy,'' said Jacqui Banaszynski of the St. Paul Pioneer Press
Dispatch newsroom after she won for feature writing for her series
on an AIDS victim in a farm community.
   Champagne also flowed at the Lawrence Eagle-Tribune, a 60,000
circulation daily in Massachusetts that won the general news
reporting prize for stories on a furloughed murderer who assaulted
a Maryland couple.
   ``This is pretty big for us. We're just a nice community
newspaper,'' said Susan Forrest, one of the Lawrence staffers who
worked on the story.
   Tom Shales of the Washington Post, the criticism winner for his
writing on television, said he was ``in a state of slack-jawed
dumbfoundness.''
   ``It's nice to be in the World Almanac permanently,'' said
Boston University historian Robert V. Bruce, who won the Pulitzer
in history for his book, ``The Launching of Modern Science
1846-1876.''
   Toni Morrison, winner of the fiction award for ``Beloved,'' said
joy was uppermost in her feelings because, ``I really was thinking
dark and difficult thoughts about what was available to this book
in terms of recognition.''
   The book sparked controversy when it did not win two other major
literary prizes. Ms. Morrison said she respected the Pulitzer
committee for ignoring ``outside matters of speculation and gossip
and some slander.''
   University of Michigan music professor William Bolcom said,
``It's better than a kick in the teeth,'' after he won the Pulitzer
for music for ``12 New Etudes for Piano,'' a tribute to the late
pianist Paul Jacobs.
   But Bolcom, who said he was disturbed by the ``prize mentality''
of the public, planned a subdued celebration.
   ``I put a bottle of champagne in the ice box,'' he said. ``The
local paper is coming over to take a picture of me sipping it.
We'll have dinner, take baths and go to bed.''
   At The Miami Herald, Pulitzers were taken home by humorist Dave
Barry and photographer Michel duCille, a second-time winner who
this time won for photos of apartments inundated by the drug crack,
a potent form of cocaine.
   ``I don't want to lessen the Pulitzers, but I feel more proud
that the photos ... made changes in the community,'' duCille said.
   Barry said he hopes winning the Pulitzer ``will make me taller.''
   He recalled he once wrote a column making fun of the Pulitzer
awards, saying that ``horrendously long, complicated''
Pulitzer-entry stories should have editor's notes warning readers
to avoid them.
   Charlotte Observer Managing Editor Mark Ethridge III said he
hoped the PTL story that brought the newspaper one of two Pulitzer
prizes was ``not a story that comes along just once in a lifetime.''
   The Observer's Doug Marlette also won a Pulitzer for his
editorial cartooning in Charlotte and at the Atlanta Constitution,
where he now works.
   Scott Shaw, a 24-year-old photographer for the Odessa (Texas)
American, said he was surprised to win the spot news award for his
coverage of the 58-hour operation that rescued little Jessica
McClure and fascinated a nation.
   ``I am pretty young. I am just pretty surprised,'' said Shaw.

   A bus filled with holiday
travelers plunged 200 yards down a mountainside early today,
killing 24 people and injuring 20, police said.
   The bus began its journey in Cape Town and was traveling between
the towns of Ladismith and Calitzdorp in southern Cape province
when it veered off a road through a mountain pass shortly after
midnight.
   Police Col. Herman Scheepers said those on board were people of
mixed race, except for one white man, believed to be the driver.
The white man was killed along with 17 other men, four women and
two children, Scheepers said.
   The cause of the accident was under investigation.
   South Africa observes a four-day holiday weekend each Easter,
and the rate of traffic fatalities during the period is often the
highest of the year.

<HEAD>U.N. Rejects Claims United States Planning Nuclear Attack</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BARRY RENFREW</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>PANMUNJOM, Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.N. Command rejected North Korean
claims today that the United States is preparing to launch a
nuclear attack from South Korea and accused the North of trying to
wreck the 1988 Olympic Games.
   United Nations representatives at a meeting of the Military
Armistice Commission ridiculed North Korean claims that U.S. forces
are using military exercises in South Korea to prepare for a
nuclear attack against the communist North.
   U.S. Navy Rear Admiral William Pendley, chief U.N. delegate,
said North Korea was trying to increase tension on the divided
Korean peninsula to undermine the Olympic Games in Seoul in
September.
   ``We can understand your need for tension _ it is part of your
effort to undermine the Olympics,'' said Pendley as the two sides
traded charges and taunts in Panmunjom, a village in the neutral
Demilitarized Zone separating the two Koreas.
   Chief North Korean delegate Maj. Gen. Li Tae Ho started the
meeting by demanding U.S. and South Korean forces halt annual
``Team Spirit'' exercises in the South involving about 200,000
troops.
   Li claimed the United States was using the exercise as a mask to
build up its forces to attack North Korea. He asserted U.S. forces
introduced a large number of nuclear weapons in recent weeks.
   ``Your wreckless war promotion has created a serious situation
on the Korean Peninsula and war could break out at any time,'' Li
said.
   North Korean military forces had been placed on alert to counter
a U.S. attack and were in ``a full combat mobilization posture .. .
to cope with the extremely dangerous situation created by your
reckless military provocations,'' Li said.
   North Korea announced the alert last week.
   Pendley said the United States had no intention of attacking
North Korea and that ``Team Spirit'' was a legal and reasonable
exercise to ensure the defense of South Korea. He repeated an offer
to let North Korean delegates observe the exercises and said the
North has always rejected the offer.
   North Korea routinely charges the United States is preparing to
launch an attack. It has also placed its forces on alert during the
``Team Spirit'' exercises in past years.
   The United States has about 40,000 troops in South Korea under a
mutual defense pact against the North. U.S. forces are reported to
have some nuclear weapons, but Washington will neither confirm nor
deny the reports.
   Pendley told reporters after the meeting that the U.N. Command
was making every effort to safeguard the Olympic Games. But he
warned the North may resort to terrorism to frighten other nations
into staying away from the Games.
   ``They may take actions to increase that tension,'' he said.
   The United States and South Korea charge North Korea was behind
the Nov. 29 bombing of a South Korean airliner in which all 115
people aboard were killed. A woman who confessed to being a North
Korean agent said she put a bomb on the plane to wreck the Olympics.
   North Korea, which denied it had anything to do with the plane
attack, is demanding to co-host the Olympics. The International
Olympic Committee and South Korea have rejected the demand, but
offered to let the north stage some events.
   The U.N. Command, consisting of the United States and 15 nations
that aided South Korea during the Korean War, meets with North
Korean and Chinese delegates to police the cease-fire signed in
Panmunjom that ended the war in 1953.

<HEAD>Wedtech Witness Says Company Plotted Problmes for Competitors</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN M. DOYLE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former Wedtech Corp. executive says he plotted
with a onetime aide to then-presidential counselor Edwin Meese III
to cause legal problems for the defense contractor's competitors.
   Under cross-examination by defense attorneys Thursday,
ex-Wedtech Vice Chairman Mario Moreno conceded that the now-defunct
company used Reagan administration connections to have the
government investigate rivals for no-bid contracts.
   However, Moreno denied getting Wedtech competitors indicted
through political connections.
   Moreno testified at the trial of Rep. Mario Biaggi, D-N.Y., and
six others charged with turning the Bronx defense contractor into a
racketeering enterprise that paid millions in bribes. The trial was
recessed until Monday.
   Moreno testified about James Jenkins, who was a top aide to
Attorney General Meese when Meese was counselor to President Reagan.
   When defense attorney Dominic Amorosa asked whether Jenkins had
told him a Wedtech competitor ``was also going to run into some
serious legal difficulties,'' Moreno said he had.
   ``In fact, you testified on prior examination here that you and
Jenkins sat down and agreed to come to limit the competitors to
two, to get a particular contract, and whoever the other one was,
was going to end up in serious investigative problems, correct?''
asked Amorosa.
   Moreno hesitated, then replied, ``Yes.''
   Jenkins, who became a Wedtech consultant after leaving the White
House, has not been charged with wrongdoing.
   Wedtech grew from a small machine shop into a
multimillion-dollar manufacturer through a federal program that set
aside non-competitive contracts for companies controlled by
minority group members.
   Prosecutors contend that Biaggi and others helped Wedtech
falsely portray itself as a minority concern eligible for the
program.
   Defense lawyers are trying to show that Wedtech officials
corrupted numerous administration officials, and didn't the help of
Biaggi, a Democratic congressman from the Bronx, to obtain
government contracts.
   Amorosa ticked off a list of politically connected people who
got jobs with Wedtech: E. Robert Wallach, Meese's former attorney;
Jenkins; former Reagan political adviser Lyn Nofziger and
Nofziger's business partner, Mark Bragg.
   ``These people,'' asked Amorosa, ``had the ability to get people
indicted, didn't they?''
   ``I believe so,'' Moreno replied.
   But he repeatedly denied asking Bragg to have Wedtech
competitors indicted.
   ``We asked to have them investigated _ for any skeletons in
their closet,'' insisted Moreno, one of four ex-Wedtech executives
who pleaded guilty to state and federal charges and agreed to
testify for the prosecution in exchange for leniency.
   Pressed by Amorosa, Moreno conceded that Bragg, while not a
member of the Justice Department, knew a Wedtech competitor would
be indicted before the indictment was made public.
   Moreno said only one competitor was indicted and that was for
matters unrelated to Wedtech.
   Nofziger was convicted in February in Washington of illegal
lobbying for Wedtech. Bragg was acquitted on related charges.
   Meese has not been charged with any wrongdoing, although a
special prosecutor in Washington continues to investigate his
dealings with Wedtech.

<HEAD>President Mengistu Says Troops Fighting ``Grim Battles'' With
Rebels</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rebels claimed they captured three
towns in northern Ethiopia and state-owned radio quoted President
Mengistu Haile Mariam as saying his troops were fighting ``grim
battles'' with the insurgents.
   It was believed to be the first time Mengistu has conceded
publicly that the secessionist rebels are in any way effective.
   Radio Ethiopia on Thursday quoted him as saying rebels had
launched a ``systematic and highly destructive campaign'' in the
Tigre and neighboring Eritrea provinces, disrupting transport and
communications networks.
   It was the first comment by the Marxist government on reports of
a new rebel offensive, which also resulted in the capture last week
of three Soviet military advisers to the Ethiopian army.
   The fighting has aggravated relief efforts in the north, the
worst-hit drought region of Ethiopia. Most of the 6 to 7 million
Ethiopians threatened with starvation this year live in the north.
   Because of rebel activities, the Soviet-backed government often
closes roads in the region, cutting off truck convoys.
   Assesa Mamo, North American representative of the Tigre People's
Liberation Front, claimed the rebels took the towns of Axum and
Adowa on Thursday after a three-day battle. He spoke from
Washington in a telephone interview with The Associated Press
bureau in Nairobi, Kenya.
   Axum is 110 miles south of Asmara, Eritrea's provincial capital,
and Adowa is 30 miles from Axum.
   Eritrean rebels said Sunday they captured the town of Afabet,
killing or capturing 18,000 Ethiopian troops. The rebels said one
Soviet officer was killed and three taken prisoner. Afabet is 100
miles north of Asmara.
   The rebels claimed to have wiped out three government divisions
and captured tanks, weapons and other military equipment worth
millions of dollars.
   There was no way to verify the rebels' claims. But Western
diplomats in Addis Ababa said the figure of 18,000 troops, a third
of troops stationed in the north, sounded preposterous.
   The Soviet Union confirmed three of its advisers were captured,
but said nothing of a fourth officer being killed.
   Mengistu made his comments about the rebels in a report to the
eighth regular meeting of the Central Committee of his Marxist
Workers' Party of Ethiopia.
   Western diplomats, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
Mengistu's statement indicated the fighting must be serious. They
said there were reports the Ethiopian leader is preparing a huge
counteroffensive against rebels of the Eritrea People's Liberation
Front and the Tigre rebel group.
   Mengistu inherited the insurgencies 13 years ago when, with a
group of army officers, he dethroned Emperor Haile Selassie and
helped set up a Marxist government.
   Eritrean rebels have been fighting for 27 years in Africa's
oldest civil war.
   The U.N. World Food Program reported Thursday that a relief
convoy reached the town of Wukro in Tigre province, bringing the
first major food delivery to the drought-stricken area since
January.
   The emergency shipment of 1,500 metric tons, enough to feed
100,000 people for a month, arrived March 24, said David Morton,
the U.N. representative in Ethiopia.

<HEAD>Doctors Urged to Take Up Defense Use of Animals in Research</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES LITKE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The American Medical Association today urged
doctors to take a more active role in their communities to ensure
fairness in the debate over the use of animals in research.
   In a commentary in the Journal of the AMA, the association
cautioned that erosion of public support for the use of research
animals poses as great a threat as pending legislation or
regulatory efforts.
   ``When people are given the entire picture, when they're
reminded that research animals played a crucial role in the
development of vaccines ... and heart transplants and antibiotics,
there is clearly backing for this position,'' said William Hendee,
AMA vice president for science and technology.
   ``But those opposed to the practice are starting now at the
local level, aiming programs at schoolchildren. It's in those
situations that we're appealing to doctors and scientists to come
forward, to make sure both sides of the debate are presented,''
said Hendee, who wrote the commentary with Stephen Smith, a senior
scientist with the association's Department of Drugs.
   The congressional Office of Technology Assessment estimates that
17 million to 22 million animals are used annually in biomedical
experiments, and that 75 percent to 90 percent of them are rodents:
rats, mice, hamsters, guinea pigs and rabbits.
   Dogs, cats and primates make up less than 5 percent of the
remainder.
   Primates are obtained from breeders or, in some cases, are bred
by research facilities. Dogs and cats are obtained from pounds or
from special breeders.
   Sixty percent of the experiments each year do not result in any
suffering by the animal, and animals receive painkilling drugs or
anesthesia in 32 percent of the cases, Smith said. Pain is
inflicted on the experimental animal in 8 percent of the
experiments, he added.
   Spokeswoman Jeanne Roush of People for Ethical Treatment of
Animals, a Washington-based animal-rights organization, said the
appeal shows ``the AMA is running scared.
   ``They simply realize animal-rights groups are gaining momentum
... that medical students and even doctors are less and less
inclined to take part in these experiments,'' Ms. Roush said.
   ``They should begin seriously looking at alternatives (to
animals) and phasing this practice out completely,'' she said.
``That's what people want.''
   The AMA authors said researchers are barred from using pound
animals in some places, and that such prohibitions are being
considered elsewhere.
   A complete ban would drive up research costs by $90 million
annually, they estimated.
   Most of the millions of animals consigned to pounds are
destroyed, he said. Less than 3 percent of those are research
animals, according to the commentary.

   A karate student beat, stomped on and threw a
man to the sidewalk after the victim questioned his knowledge of
the martial art, police said.
   William Roberts, 37, was in critical condition Thursday at the
University of Maryland Shock Trauma Center. A hospital worker who
refused to identify herself said she could not release Roberts'
condition today.
   The karate student, 28-year-old John McCloskey of suburban
Pasadena, was held on $250,000 bond, charged with assault with
intent to murder, aggravated assault and possession of a deadly
weapon.
   Witnesses told police Roberts was apparently intoxicated when he
staggered up the steps of the Order of Isshinryu Karate School and
knocked on the door Wednesday.
   Police found him unconscious in a pool of blood and a trail of
blood leading into the school.
   McCloskey told police he had felt threatened.

<TEXT>
   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (ap) _ A patron left a bomb in a poultry
shop near the Afghan border and it exploded, killing seven people
and injuring 18, the official government newspaper reported today.
   Also Thursday, two other people were killed and two were wounded
in another frontier village by incoming Afghan artillery rounds,
the English-language Pakistan Times said.
   The bombing occurred in the northwestern village of Sadda when a
man purchased a hen then asked the shop owner to keep the bird and
a parcel for him while he finished his shopping, the Times said.
   The man has not been apprehended and no group claimed
responsibility, the paper said. Pakistani officials have blamed a
series of terrorist bombings over the past two years on agents of
Afghanistan's Soviet-backed government.
   Pakistan supports the guerrillas fighting that government and
shelters about 3.5 million Afghan refugees.
   The shelling occurred in a village identified as Ghakh, the
Times said.
   Cross-border shellings and aerial bombings have been frequent in
the 10-year-old Afghan war.
   Both of Thursday's attacks occurred in semi-autonomous districts
ruled by Pashtun tribal clans that are normally off limits to
Pakistani police and military. They are also the main staging areas
for Afghan guerrillas.

   Smaller than normal crowds of Christian
pilgrims today carried wooden crosses and sang psalms in the Old
City's Via Dolorosa to commemorate Good Friday, the anniversary of
Jesus' crucifixion.
   Twenty yards away from the street, an Arab attacker stabbed an
Israeli police sergeant in the stomach. The officer was
hospitalized in fair condition. Police apprehended a suspect and
cordoned off the area.
   Arab unrest in the Israeli-occupied territories has prompted
many pilgrims to stay away this year.
   The Greek Orthodox Patriarch of Jerusalem canceled three
pre-Easter processions scheduled for today and Saturday out of
concern for the pilgrims' safety and due to an expected sharp drop
in the number of tourists.
   But the Old City was more alive than it has been for weeks and
many of the hundreds of tourists visiting the 12th century Church
of the Holy Sepulchre said the event was a special one. The church
marks the spot where Jesus was crucified and, as Christians
believe, resurrected.
   ``We planned to come here for a long time and nothing could stop
us, even friends who said we were crazy,'' said David Reid of
Mountain Lakes, N.J. ``There are lots of police around and we are
as safe here as we are in New York City.''
   Dozens of Israeli riot police stood guard along the route, some
munching the unleavened matzoh crackers Jews eat during the week of
Passover, which begins today.
   The Via Dolorosa, or Way of Sorrow, marks the path where Jesus,
wearing a crown of thorns, was forced to carry the cross on which
he was later crucified. The tradition of following the devotional
walk was started in the 14th century by the Franciscans, a Roman
Catholic order.
   Today, the via is a narrow cobblestone street crowded with shops
which passes by several Moslem mosques. Christians singing and
praying walked down the street, along with priests who carried
ornate silver and gold crosses and burned incense.
   The Church of the Holy Sepulchre was built on the site where
Jesus is believed to have been crucified and buried, and where he
is said to have risen from the dead two days later, an event
commemorated on Easter.
   The spot of the crucifixion is marked on the church's second
floor by an ornate gold table and a figure of Jesus, lit only by
candles.
   Downstairs, pilgrims kissed and threw water on the rock marking
the spot where Jesus's body was washed before burial. Sixteen choir
boys in long black robes sang prayers.
   Arab merchants opened their shops for the three hours permitted
by the Palestine Liberation Organization and did brisk business
selling solid olive-wood crosses.
   But Christian church officials were predicting the violence in
the occupied territories would trigger a sharp decline in tourism.
   The Rev. Timoteus Margaritis, a spokesman for the Greek Orthodox
Christian Church, said 1,500 pilgrims were expected to attend his
church's April 10 Easter Service, instead of the usual 10,000.
   Tourism figures, however, have also become part of the
Arab-Israeli conflict, with Israeli officials reluctant to
acknowledge an adverse impact of the conflict in the territories.
   Tourism Ministry officials said more visitors came to Israel in
January and February as compared with the previous year, but said
13 percent fewer tourists entered the country during the first week
in March.
   ``We are concerned about the coming months, April, May and June,
when we do expect a slight drop,'' said Micha Dedron, who added
that the most serious decline in tourism was among U.S. Jews.

   A high school football coach chose the
50-yard line of Capital Studium to marry a former cheerleader _ but
before the nuptials were over he was called offsides for making a
premature pass at the bride.
   When Steve Ash, 38, an assistant football coach at Rickards High
School, asked Lora Kyle to marry him on Valentine's Day, he had
more than one proposal to make.
   ``I'm a coach, she was a cheerleader, we both love sports, and
we both think that a marriage should be fun and make you laugh, so
why not have a wedding that does the same thing?'' Ash said.
   ``I never thought it would get this big,'' Ms. Kyle, 35, said
through clenched teeth moments before her wedding.
   ``Good evening ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to Capital
Stadium,'' Jeff Duke announced over the public address system.
After introducing all the second-stringers who helped, Duke gave
the starting lineup.
   ``Direct your attention to the south end zone, where standing
tall at 5-feet-9-inches and weighing in at 195, starting at groom
from Steer Creek, W.Va., Steve Ash.''
   Ash then burst through a paper banner with a pink tuxedo painted
on it and ran to the 50-yard line.
   ``And now, in the north end zone, a 5-3, 130-pound former
cheerleader from Smith Creek, Fla., starting at bride, Lora Kyle.''
   Ms. Kyle then jumped through a similar banner with a pink hat
painted on it.
   But as the knot was being tied an overzealous Ash tried to steal
a kiss from his bride and the Rev. Chuck Groover objected.
   ``That's offsides. You're supposed to wait,'' Groover said.
``You're not supposed to kiss her until I say so.''
   A five-second penalty followed after which the real kiss was
exchanged as hundreds of blue and white helium balloons were
released.

   Pssst, wanna buy a bridge? Grays Harbor
County has one for sale and it's a bargain. It's free.
   There's just one catch: the purchaser has to take the 120-foot
span apart, move it and repair it, according to county records.
   Among other things, the bridge on the Olympic Peninsula needs
new deck planks, the metal truss work needs paint and the new owner
should know the wooden stringers have a life expectancy of 10-15
years.
   The 14-foot-wide bridge, built in 1915, cannot support current
legal loads and is to be replaced next year by a two-lane bridge.
   The span was placed on the National Register of Historic Places
in 1980, preventing the county from simply tearing it down without
trying to find the bridge a new home.
   So far, there have been no takers.

   A farmer armed with a 10-inch
knife went berserk and killed four neighbors and wounded four
others before a crowd stoned him to death, the military said today.
   Philippine Constabulary operations chief Maj. German Doria
identified the man as Pablo Bingcoy, 33. He said the attack
occurred Thursday in the village of Mangangaon in Zamboanga del
Norte province, 450 miles south of Manila.
   Doria said Bingcoy had fasted and prayed for several days in
hopes of earning an amulet, which he believed would make him
invincible.
   Then Bingcoy took a 10-inch long knife, went out of the house
and attacked everyone he saw. Doria said Bingcoy first killed a
neighbor's pig. Then after a heated argument, Bingcoy killed the
owner, his wife and 6-year-old son.
   Afterwards, he stabbed five people, one of whom died later in a
hospital, Doria said. An angry mob then stoned Bingcoy to death,
the major said.

<TEXT>
   Ferrets are increasingly popular as pets, but the
weasel-like animals can be dangerous to young children, two doctors
say.
   In three unprovoked attacks, two babies had their ears bitten
off by ferrets and required constructive surgery and a third infant
suffered scratches and bites requiring 39 stitches, John W. Paisley
and Brian A. Lauer write in today's Journal of the American Medical
Association.
   ``Two of the children were asleep in their cribs when they were
bitten,'' the two University of Colorado School of Medicine doctors
said.
   ``Although ferrets are increasingly popular pets, we believe
that they are not suitable pets for families with small children,''
said the doctors, who claim Americans own more than a million
ferrets and are buying them at the rate of 50,000 a year.
   All the babies recovered, the doctors said, adding that reports
of severe injuries caused by ferrets are few.
   But ``a ferret may bite so tenaciously that it has to be pried
off or killed to loosen its hold,'' the doctors said. One of the
animals in the attacks described had to be killed before it would
release the child, they said.
   The incidence of ferret bites is unknown because most states do
not require bites to be reported to health officials, the doctors
said.
   During an 11-month period in Arizona, the ratio of reported
bites to the estimated pet population was 0.3 percent for ferrets,
compared with 0.4 percent for cats and 2.2 percent for dogs, they
said.
   Sale or ownership of pet ferrets is prohibited in California,
Georgia, New Hampshire, New York City and Washington, D.C., the
doctors said. A ban also has been proposed in North Carolina.

   The co-publisher of a small Bronx weekly
newspaper finished as a finalist for a Pulitzer Prize this year for
the second time and conceded it's getting ``a little frustrating.''
   ``I'd like to win it,'' said Bernard Stein after learning
Thursday he had been one of three finalists for the Pulitzer in
editorial writing for his work on The Riverdale Press, circulation
14,000.
   He credits some of his success to what he learns through daily
reporting, a necessity for even the bosses at a paper with a news
staff of six.
   When he's not solving problems faced by weekly newspaper
publishers, such as choosing what computers to buy or deciding how
to patch a hole in the roof, he might be found at the Wedtech
trial, where he was Thursday when Pulitzers were passed out.
   ``I report a lot, walking with my own feet, seeing with my own
eyes and talking to people. I think a good editorial writer has to
be a good reporter,'' he said.
   Last year, Stein entered the contest ``on a whim.''
   ``This year, I thought maybe there was some serious possibility.
It still feels wonderful,'' he said.
   Stein's editorials on a variety of issues earned him a spot as a
finalist along with Joe Dolman of the Atlanta Journal and
Constitution for his editorials on the rights of jailed Cuban
refugees.
   Jane Healy of The Orlando Sentinel won the prize for editorials
protesting overdevelopment in Orange County, Fla.
   Stein has a love-hate relationship with some of his neighbors
for controversial stands he has taken, including one that so irked
Mayor Edward I. Koch that Koch invited him to lunch to discuss the
subject of housing with him.
   In February, Stein criticized Israel's policies in the occupied
territory and drew plenty of hate mail from his readers, many of
whom are Jewish.
   ``I think you have to take a stand,'' said the 46-year-old
Riverdale community resident who was arrested along with more than
800 others on Dec. 3, 1964 during a free speech rally in the
administration building at the University of California at Berkeley.
   Tom Watson, the paper's deputy editor, said he is ``somewhat in
awe'' of Stein, who has helped train journalists who now work at
The New York Times, the Los Angeles Times, USA Today and the
Detroit News, among others.
   ``He basically is a great teacher,'' Watson said. ``He likes to
call this the best graduate journalism program in New York state.''
   Stein, who helped found Students for a Democratic Society at
Berkeley, said he fights for ``the principle that ordinary people
can make the decisions that affect their lives.
   ``I try to give them the information they need to do that. I
have an absolute commitment to free speech. That's why I published
every letter I get, including racist and sexist letters, as long as
they're not libelous,'' he said.
   And, he said, the readers showed their appreciation after he was
named a finalist last year.
   ``Neighbors, people I'd meet at the shopping center, would stop
me at the street to say they felt it was their prize too,'' he
recalled. ``Hundreds of people wrote me letters to say they felt
they had a share in it and they were immensely proud to live in
Riverdale because The Riverdale Press came so close to a Pulitzer.''

<HEAD>April 1 Story Says Baseball Stadium Sits on Burial Ground</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Japan's leading English-language newspaper reported
today that Tokyo's new baseball stadium would have to be moved
because it sits on an ancient Shinto burial ground. Failure to
relocate the 56,000-seat stadium would cause the Yomiuri Giants to
finish last this year, it warned.
   April Fool.
   But officials in the office of the just-opened Tokyo Dome,
Japan's first covered stadium, weren't laughing. They were busy
advising callers the story was an April Fool's Day joke.
   Callers weren't amused either. Japanese take baseball seriously.
And the Yomiuri Giants just don't expect to finish in last place.
   The story in the independent Japan Times said a Shinto priest
had discovered after the stadium opened in March that the
oval-shaped ``Big Egg'' was built partially on a Shinto burial
ground.
   The priest predicted the Giants, which share the stadium with
the Nippon Ham Fighters, would finish last in their division if the
stadium were not moved 40 yards to the north.
   Engineers had offered two solutions, the Times said. Some
preferred filling the domed stadium with helium gas and letting it
float the 40 yards. Others suggested that with the Japanese
tradition of hard work and with lots of and with lots of overtime,
the stadium could be dismantled and rebuilt on safe ground in time
for the April 8 season opener.
   A Times staffer told The Associated Press only that the
newspaper had received numerous inquiries, including a call from
the company that built the stadium, asking if the story were true.

   The supply of illegal drugs and the number of
suppliers are endless, but the arrest of more than 100 members of a
Sicilian Mafia drug ring strikes at a major part of the illegal
drug network, FBI Director William Sessions said today.
   ``This is not a drug bust,'' said Sessions in assessing the
arrests and charges announced by the FBI and Italian authorities on
Thursday. ``This is going into the major workings of a major
enterprise, and I suspect there will be a profound effect in that
part of the operations.''
   Sessions, interviewed on ``CBS This Morning,'' said he expects
the legal action which involved several U.S. and Italian law
enforcement agencies to eventually net or charge about 250 people.
   But he acknowledged there are many other organizations not
touched by the crackdown, and he made no prediction about its
impact on what he said is the tremendous supply of illegal drugs in
the United States.
   ``There are endless numbers of suppliers. There are endless
quantities of cocaine and heroine avialable,'' Sessions said in
another interview on ABC-TV's ``Good Morning America.''
   ``As to whether we have broken the Sicilian connection, that
remains to be seen,'' he said.
   Sessions said interdiction of drugs is very difficult and it has
become a major FBI goal to undertake long-range operations that hit
at organizations behind world drug traffic.
   Plentiful cocaine supplies in the United States led the major
Sicilian Mafia drug ring to export massive quantities of the drug
to Italy and trade it for heroin to sell to U.S. markets, FBI
officials said in announcing the operations Thursday.
   Attorney General Edwin Meese III said trading cocaine for heroin
was ``a simple matter of economics.'' Because of the plentiful
supply and leveled-off consumption in the United States, cocaine is
less expensive here, about $20,000 a kilogram, than in Europe where
it costs about $50,000 a kilogram, he said.
   Heroin, on the other hand, is more expensive and therefore more
profitable in the United States than in Italy. Two kilograms of
cocaine can be exchanged for one kilogram of heroin in Italy, FBI
spokesman Gregory Jones said. A kilogram equals about 2.2 pounds.
   Meese said the arrests will have a ``significant impact on
heroin imports into this country from Italy,'' but he said he could
not say what volume of drugs has been affected.
   By Thursday evening, 38 people had been arrested in the United
States and 64 in Italy, the FBI said. An additional 14 were already
in U.S. jails. A total of 69 arrest warrants were issued in the
United States and 164 were to be issued in Italy. Some people were
being charged in both countries, the FBI said.
   Throughout a news conference called to announce the arrests,
Meese was peppered with questions from reporters about defections
from his department because of his own mounting legal problems, and
about calls from members of Congress for him to resign.
   The attorney general repeatedly refused to answer any questions
other than those about the drug case.
   The 69 defendants in the United States include 38 charged in New
York City, six in Los Angeles and Boston, 10 in Charlotte, N.C.,
eight in San Juan, Puerto Rico, two in Cleveland and five in
Washington, D.C., the FBI said.
   U.S. authorities seized 6 kilograms of heroin and 4 kilograms of
cocaine along with cash, weapons, vehicles, fur coats, paintings
and jewelry during the course of the investigation, the FBI said.
Italian authorities said they seized 25 kilograms of heroin, 5
kilograms of cocaine, and arms, ammunition and counterfeit currency.
   Several of the defendants in the new case ran clothing stores,
and FBI Assistant Director of the New York Office James Fox said
the heroin brought into the United States was often referred to as
``suits'' or ``pants'' by the defendants. In other instances,
heroin was called ``white wine'' or ``red wine'' by defendants, Fox
said.
   The continuing investigation began two years ago and grew out of
a 1985 drug case that came to be called the ``Pizza Connection.''
Thirty-five members of the Sicilian Mafia were indicted in New York
in that case.
   The ``Pizza'' case ended with 18 convictions in March 1987. It
was mentioned repeatedly Thursday during a related news conference
in New York, although none of the Sicilian heroin in the new case
was distributed through pizzerias in the United States.
   According to a government affidavit filed in U.S. District Court
in Manhattan, two of the defendants in New York City and one of
those charged in Charlotte are fugitives from Italian drug
convictions. Some of the other defendants are illegal aliens,
according to the document.
   Among those arrested Thursday was Emanuele Adamita of Brooklyn,
N.Y., an unindicted co-conspirator in the ``Pizza Connection''
case, who was taken into custody at a Manhattan hotel after telling
an undercover agent, ``You're like family,'' said Robert Stutman, a
Drug Enforcement Administration special agent.
   The agent kissed Adamita, who was then arrested, Stutman said.
   Also charged in the case was Lorenzo Zorza of Manhattan, a
Catholic priest with a 1982 conviction for smuggling stolen art
into the United States from Italy, according to a 64-page complaint
filed before federal Judge Morris E. Lasker in New York.
   Suspects arrested Thursday have been charged with conspiracies
to import, possess and distribute drugs, the FBI said. The charges
carry possible life sentences.

   A bus careened off a road while
crossing a bridge and plunged into an icy river in the capital
today, killing at least 20 people and injuring 40, police said.
   Many of the victims were high school students returning home.
   Police said the accident occurred shortly after 5 p.m. in the
eastern part of the capital when the bus blew a front tire and the
driver lost control.
   The bus, carrying more than 60 passengers, fell 24 feet into the
Han River, police said.
   Policemen and passersby rescued about 10 people who broke
windows and climbed onto the top of the mangled bus, they said.
Divers pulled 20 bodies from the frigid waters and continued to
search for victims in the partly submerged vehicle.
   Police said the bus may have been speeding when the accident
occurred. They gave no other details.

<TEXT>
   A federal grand jury has indicted a former
Conrail engineer involved in an Amtrak crash that killed 16 people
on charges including lying to investigators about taking drugs the
day of the accident.
   Rick L. Gates, 33, of Essex, was charged Thursday with one count
of conspiracy, one count of obstruction of an agency investigation
and two counts of making false statements, U.S. Attorney
Breckinridge Willcox said.
   Gates missed a track signal while operating a string of three
Conrail locomotives and drove them into the path of a speeding
passenger train.
   The accident, the worst in Amtrak's history, also injured 175
people.
   The indictment alleges Gates lied under oath to National
Transportation Safety Board investigators on Jan. 7, 1987, three
days after the crash in suburban Baltimore County, when he said he
had not consumed any drugs that day.
   Gates, however, shared a marijuana cigarette with brakeman
Edward Cromwell that day, according to the statement of facts read
into the record when Gates pleaded guilty to a state charge in
Baltimore County Circuit Court Feb. 17.
   The new indictment also alleges Gates falsely testified about
the status of the signals in the locomotives and along the tracks
and about what pre-departure tests he conducted.
   The conspiracy count alleges he joined with Cromwell to
fabricate a story about what happened.
   Cromwell cooperated in the state investigation and is expected
to testify against Gates at the federal trial, Willcox said.
Cromwell was granted immunity from prosecution by state and federal
prosecutors, Willcox said.
   Gates was the only person named in the indictment. If convicted,
he faces a maximum of five years in prison and a $250,000 fine on
each count.
   On Tuesday, Gates was sentenced to five years in prison and
fined $1,000 on a state misdemeanor charge of manslaughter by
locomotive.
   The NTSB had no comment on the indictments, an agency
spokeswoman said.

   Pope John Paul II heard confessions from 11
pilgrims and tourists in St. Peter's Basilica today in keeping with
a Good Friday tradition he began in 1979.
   In the evening, the pope planned to carry a wooden cross in a
torch-lit procession at the Colosseum recalling Christ's walk to
his crucifixion on Calvary Hill in Jerusalem.
   Several hundred people were waiting when John Paul appeared
shortly after noon in St. Peter's Basilica and stepped into one of
the hand-carved mahogany confessional booths.
   Over the next 70 minutes, he heard confessions from a family of
three Italians, a 40-year-old Italian steelworker and his
53-year-old friend, a 13-year-old Italian boy studying for his
confirmation, a 59-year-old contractor from the Netherlands and his
27-year-old daughter, a 22-year-old American student from
California, a Nigerian man studying in England, and a Spanish
housewife.
   At the end of the confessions, the pope blessed the hundreds of
people present and asked them to join him in prayer.

<TEXT>
   A disc jockey's April Fools' Day joke about a
mysterious rumble and flash of light in a popular suburban park
resulted in a flurry of calls today from listeners claiming to have
witnessed the event.
   ``People are seeing it. But it ain't there,'' said Fred
Honsberger, news director for Pittsburgh's KDKA-AM.
   ``We just had a lady call who said she saw a bunch of gray
trucks go in led by a jeep. These people are claiming to have seen
that thing. But we started it all,'' Honsberger said, chuckling.
   Another caller, he said, wanted to know, ``Who's going to pay
for the military going out there? Who's going to pay for all this?'
''
   Morning disc jockey John Cigna jolted some of his sleepy
listeners when he said his house shook early today and dishes
rattled. He said he saw a flash of light in North Park, noticed a
lot of activity and wondered what was going on.
   ``The place is cordoned off. You can't get into the park,''
Cigna said in a calm voice, introducing a man on the telephone as
Colonel Charles Bradshaw.
   ``Is that a UFO? Is that a saucer that's down?'' Cigna asked.
   ``I can't divulge any information,'' the man replied, saying
only that it was an ``item.''
   Dozens of nervous listeners called the Pennsylvania Association
for the Study of the Unexplained in nearby Greensburg to learn
more. After an hour of checking, the association determined it was,
indeed, an April Fools' Day joke.
   ``Unfortunately, when things like this happen, it takes away
from the legitimacy of the callers who see things that are unusual
and can't be explained. It helps to bring back the ridicule
problem,'' said Stan Gordon, the association's director.
   Honsberger said none of the morning news reports included the
so-called emergency.
   ``That should be a clue to anybody,'' Honsberger said. ``If
anything was happening, it would be our lead story. We'd have
reporters there.''
   Despite the incongruity of it all, callers swamped the
switchboard at the radio station as well as its television
affiliate.
   ``It's all because of April Fools','' Tom Trukula, an intern at
KDKA-TV, explained as he fielded telephone calls.
   ``They are not really mad,'' he said.
   But Allegheny County police officers stationed at the park
weren't laughing. They, too, spent the morning responding to
queries, mostly from reporters wanting to know if anything really
was happening.
   ``There's nothing going on,'' assured Sgt. William Wolverton,
``so nobody should be frightened.''
   Last year on April Fools' Day, Cigna said on the air that an
alligator was lurking in Pittsburgh's sewer system. To solve the
pesky problem, he asked listeners to flush their toilets at the
same time.
   ``A lot of people did,'' Honsberger said.

   Israel reopened the occupied territories today,
a holy day for Jews, Christians and Moslems, after a three-day
closure. Arab reports said two Palestinians were killed in a clash
in the West Bank.
   Despite the tensions, hundreds of Christian pilgrims crowded the
narrow streets of Jerusalem's Old City, carrying wooden crosses and
singing psalms along the Via Dolorosa to commemorate Good Friday,
the anniversary of Jesus' crucifixion.
   Dozens of Israeli riot police stood guard along the route.
Authorities were concerned that violence could be timed to disrupt
Easter celebrations or the eight-day Jewish Passover holiday, which
starts this evening.
   Arab journalists said demonstrations erupted in Idna near the
West Bank town of Hebron after noon prayers on the Moslem Sabbath.
They said Jamal Tamiri, 20, died after he was hit in the head with
a tear gas canister and Ishak Nimr Salameh, 18, was killed when a
burst of five bullets hit him in the chest.
   Army spokesmen said they were checking the report.
   An Israeli police lieutenant in Jerusalem's Old City was stabbed
in the stomach and taken to a hospital, apparently by a Moslem
worshiper, police said.
   ``Suddenly, there was a scuffle, and police pulled someone aside
_ an Arab,'' said Heski Rohr, a television sound man who witnessed
the incident.
   The Greek Orthodox Patriarch of Jerusalem canceled three
pre-Easter processions scheduled for today and Saturday out of
concern for the pilgrims' safety and due to an expected sharp drop
in the number of tourists.
   Underground Palestinian leaders called in a leaflet for
Palestinians to stage demonstrations, including a general strike
Monday, to protest the latest peace mission of Secretary of State
George P. Shultz, who arrives Sunday.
   The PLO-signed leaflet appealed to ``all the Arab world to block
Shultz's plan and to stop him from killing the uprising.''
   It also demanded that Palestinian politicians avoid meeting with
Shultz during his visit.
   Extra troops continued to patrol the occupied West Bank and Gaza
Strip today. In recent months, violence regularly has broken out
after Friday Moslem prayers.
   At the Nasr Mosque in the West Bank town of El Bireh, about 35
women marched down a street, chanting ``by our blood we will redeem
Palestine.''
   The army fired tear gas canisters to break up the march, but
some drifted back onto the soldiers.
   The closure was lifted at 3:00 a.m. (8 p.m. EST Thursday),
allowing West Bank residents to travel out of their towns and
villages and lifting a curfew in the Gaza Strip, where five-hour
nightly curfews were to continue.
   Journalists could again travel freely in the occupied lands.
During the closure, they were only allowed in in organized pools
and under army escort.
   In Ramallah, stores and the central vegetable market opened for
the first time since the three-day closure was imposed Monday night.
   Soldiers have forced stores to shut during hours that PLO
leaflets say they should open. Curfews, road closures and financial
restrictions have also made it difficult for businessmen to operate.
   Abed Hamouri, co-owner of a fleet of 24 commuter buses, said
Israeli economic measures designed to pressure middle class
Palestinians failed to have any impact on underground activists.
   ``The Israelis are talking to the people who do not have the
solution in their hands. The solution is not in the hands of the
people who own shops,'' Hamouri said.
   The security measures were adopted in anticipation of major
riots Wednesday marking Land Day, an annual day of protest
commemorating the deaths of six Arabs in a 1976 clash over land
confiscation.
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, speaking to Jewish settlers
during a tour of the West Bank on Thursday, referred to the rioters
as ``grasshoppers.''
   ``We say to them from this hilltop, and from the perspective of
a 1,000-year past, that in our eyes they are like grasshopppers.
The Jewish people, thousands of years old, will overcome its
enemies, no longer needing men of the underground and fighters in
tunners,'' Shamir said, standing on the hilltop site of the
biblical King Herod's Palace at Herodion.
   Four Palestinians were killed Wednesday and dozens wounded, but
officials said the clampdown had made some gains in the struggle to
quell the four-month-old Arab uprising in the territories Israel
seized in the 1967 Middle East war.
   Before today's violence, 124 Palestinians had been killed and
hundreds more wounded in unrest that began Dec. 8.
   One Israeli soldier has died in rioting and three civilians were
killed by Palestinian guerrillas in a bus hijacking. Israel Radio
said 40 Israeli soldiers have been injured in riots since Dec. 8.
One was paralyzed and another was in a coma.
   Israel radio said 750 Palestinians had been jailed since the
uprising began under detention orders that allow up to six months'
imprisonment without trial.

   Joris Minne, the Belgian engraver and
sculptor credited with helping revive the art of engraving, has
died, his family announced today.
   Minne died Thursday at 91. The cause of death was not announced.
   Minne and four other Flemish graphic artists, Frans Masereel,
Henri Van Straten, Jan-Frans Cantre and Joseph Cantre, founded the
art magazine ``Lumiere'' in the 1920s. The magazine was a key force
in generating new interest and techniques in wood engraving.
   The five artists were credited with popularizing in the early
20th century the art of wood, copper and linoleum engraving.
   Minne was considered a pioneer of modern wood and copper
engraving. He was also a gifted drawer and painter.
   His sculpting career began in 1939, but he only won widespread
recognition in 1950 with an exhibition in Antwerp's Middelheimpark.
He mainly sculpted wood.

   Sikh militants lined up and executed
people in a courtyard near this Hindu village, police said today.
They were among 33 killed in the Punjab state's worst outbreak of
religious violence this year.
   Thursday's attacks came hours after an umbrella organization
spearheading the movement to establish a Sikh homeland in the
northern Punjab state called for an end to killings of moderate
Sikhs.
   It was the bloodiest single day of such violence this year and
brought the number of people killed in such attacks this week to
more than 80. Most of the killings have been near Amritsar, the
site of the Golden Temple, the Sikhs' holiest shrine and a center
for militants.
   Authorities blamed the latest spate of violence on differences
within militant groups and attempts to sabotage government moves to
reach an accord with militants.
   Authorities said 25 people died in three separate attacks near
Pangota, 25 miles north of Amritsar, and eight died elsewhere in
the Punjab violence.
   Eighteen people died in a hamlet outside Pangota, when 12
militants stormed the huts of a Hindu work commune, local police
officer S.S. Virk said. Most of the victims were dragged out of
their homes at gunpoint, lined up in a courtyard and shot, he said.
   The gunmen also killed a pregnant woman, her 6-month-old
daughter, and her 80-year-old mother-in-law at their home, Virk
said. The militants had wanted to drag the family away like the
others but found they could not walk, he said.
   Seven militants fired Chinese-made AK-47 rifles at a family
sleeping in the courtyard of their home, local Police
Superintendent Izhar Alam said.
   At least six other victims were women. The victims, migrants
from neighbouring Haryana state, were all related, Virk said.
   At Shaeed village, six miles west of Pangota, another group of
militants gunned down five Hindus, including three women and a
two-year-old boy. The militants entered the homes of the victims
and shot them in their beds, Virk said.
   The militants then shot and killed a Sikh couple in nearby
Verowal town, Virk said.
   Elsewhere in Punjab, three members of a Sikh family were killed
in the central Kapurthala district, said a police officer in the
state capital of Chandigarh, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
The United News of India news agency said the victims were
militants killed in factional rivalry.
   Two deaths each were reported from Gurdaspur and Bhatinda
districts and one person was shot and killed in Ropar district in
the east, the officer said.
   Earlier Thursday, the underground Council of Khalistan had
called on militant groups to cease random killings of Sikhs. At
least 330 of the 616 people killed this year in attacks blamed on
the Sikh extremists have been Sikhs who oppose the demand for a
separate state.
   Khalistan is the name militants give to the homeland they want.
   Sikhs form 2 percent of India's 800 million people but are in a
majority in Punjab state. The militants have been agitating for a
separate state since 1983, claiming discrimination by the Hindus,
who comprise 80 percent of India's 750 million people.
   The government last month released 12 Sikh leaders jailed for
sedition and dissolved the Punjab state assembly in what was seen
as an attempt to enroll the militants in political processes.
   But sources in the Golden Temple, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, said some militants opposed the peace plan since it
would not give the Sikhs total autonomy.

   Western officials helping refugees on
the Thai-Cambodian border will travel only with armed escort after
a British nurse was held hostage and a firefight killed two people,
an aid official said today.
   Officials of the U.N. Border Relief Operation and cooperating
voluntary agencies made the decision Thursday night, said Stephen
Goode, director of the aid agency Youth With A Mission.
   He said workers would travel to and from refugee camps with Thai
security escort until the measure was reviewed Saturday. Also, all
non-essential services to the camps were suspended until that
review, he said.
   During the attack Thursday, an assailant hijacked an UNBRO truck
and forced the driver to stop a pickup truck belonging to Youth
With a Mission, according to Goode and Western aid officials.
   The assailant held an automatic weapon to the head of Sally
Rymer, a 29-year-old midwife from Yorkshire who has been working
for Youth With a Mission on the border since 1985. Three defense
volunteers who had been alerted by other aid workers pursued the
pickup in a motorcycle, and a shootout followed.
   The attacker killed one Thai village defense volunteer and
injured two others before a Thai driver for the agency shot and
killed him.
   The assailant remained unidentified, but was thought to be
Cambodian since he didn't speak Thai well, Goode said. At one
point, the assailant asked for money, but the motive for the attack
remained unclear.
   Thai and Cambodian bandits roam the border, but few attacks have
involved Western aid workers. Unlike most previous incidents, this
one occurred in broad daylight, on the main road to Site Two camp.
   Site Two is the largest border refugee camp, housing 162,000
Cambodians who fled economic hardship and a guerrilla war against
occupying Vietnamese troops. It is in Thailand's Prachinburi
province and about 50 miles north of the key Thai border town of
Aranyaprathet.

   A sponsor's withdrawal following protests
by women students caused the cancellation of a fund-raising bikini
contest planned by a University of Massachusetts fraternity.
   The makers of Miller Lite beer withdrew their sponsorship hours
before the contest was to begin Thursday night, said Joe Giarusso,
assistant general manager of the off-campus Pink Cadillac bar.
   ``There are no prizes and the event has been canceled,'' said
Giarusso, who refused further comment.
   Thirty-four students had signed a petition denouncing the
contest, which protester Becky Lockwood called dehumanizing.
   But fraternity brothers at Delta Upsilon said they didn't
understand the furor.
   ``It's ridiculous,'' said fraternity President Paul Kearney.
``Why should they be upset if it's a fund-raiser? They do it
everywhere else. If they go to the beach, are they going to call
that sexist too?''
   Robert O'Brien, chairman of the fraternity's fund-raising
committee, said proceeds of the contest were to be used for the
fraternity's yearly beer keg roll, a charity event that raised
$3,000 for the Jimmy Fund last year.
   The Jimmy Fund, the official charity of the Boston Red Sox,
raises money to fight cancer in children.
   The fraternity circulated fliers last week announcing, ``Delta
Upsilon & The Jimmy Fund in association with the Amherst Police
Dept. present First Annual Bikini Contest.''
   But Jimmy Fund associate director Michael Rafferty said he knew
nothing of the contest and asked the fraternity not to use its name
for the event.
   Amherst police Chief Donald Maia had accepted an invitation to
be master of ceremonies at the contest but changed his mind over
the weekend, saying the contest was no longer a beauty pageant and
his presence would be inappropriate.

   More than 3,000 travelers, many embarking on their
Easter vacations, were stuck today in a long line of buses, cars
and trucks waiting to cross the English Channel at the strikebound
port of Dover.
   Vacationers bound for Calais, France, with ferry reservations
faced delays of up to 12 hours, and truck drivers could wait even
longer, said Paul Youden, a spokesman for the Dover Harbor Board.
   The ferry worker's dispute has halted all of P and O European
Ferries' ships in Dover, but other vessels were operating out of
the southeastern port.
   Other ports also said they were busy handling some of the
traffic from Dover.
   About 2,300 ferry workers have been on strike for eight weeks
over P and O's plan to cut 400 jobs and introduce new shifts.
   Port officials said 97 buses, 425 cars and 500 trucks were
caught in the backup.

<TEXT>
   A leading Soviet scholar said a fire at the
Academy of Sciences that burned 400,000 books and periodicals was a
national disaster, but that library officials played it down like
the Chernobyl nuclear accident.
   Historian Dmitri Likhachev, head of the Soviet Culture Fund,
demanded that top officials at the academy's library in Leningrad
be fired for lying about the size of the loss and ordering a
clean-up instead of a careful salvage operation.
   The Feb. 14 fire at the library, which stores publications
dating back to the 17th century, ``can rightly be called a national
diaster,'' Likhachev said. ``Our culture has suffered a huge loss.''
   His comments appeared in a page-long article published in the
March 18 edition of the weekly Book Review.
   The scholar said 400,000 books and periodicals had been
destroyed in the blaze and that 2.7 million more suffered water and
moisture damage.
   The library was founded by Peter the Great in 1714 and,
according to the weekly, contained about 12 million books,
periodicals and manuscripts.
   Likhachev, 81, charged the library administration and the
Leningrad scientific center of the Academy of Sciences ``both
acted, in the first days, according to the `model' programmed by
the mistakes of the Chernobyl catastrophe _ they tried to belittle
the cultural loss in the grossest manner.''
   He was referring to Soviet authorities' initial attempts to hush
up the world's worst nuclear disaster, an April 1986 explosion at
the Chernobyl nuclear power plant in which at least 31 people died
and millions were exposed to increased levels of radioactivity.
   Immediately after the fire, library administrator V.A. Filov
estimated the loss at about $4,800 and said the library would be
open again in a few days, Likhachev said.
   The March 8 edition of the Communist Party newspaper Pravda said
the cost of the damage was at least $480,000 and added that
estimate was probably low. It said the figure was based on 1956
values and that some of the lost material was priceless.
   ``A bulldozer was called, and huge piles of burned, dampened and
undamaged books were destroyed,'' Likhachev charged. ``Library
workers were prohibited from saving books from this heap of ruins.
All this in order to hide more quickly from the eyes of society the
size of the catastrophe.''
   The Academy of Sciences library began collecting books,
manuscripts and periodicals in 1714, and for more than 200 years
was located in a building on Leningrad's Vasiliyevsky Island. In
the 1920s it was moved to a new building built especially for it on
the island.
   Among the books destroyed was a library of foreign medical books
gathered by health officials beginning in the 17th century, and
libraries gathered by Baltic and Polish royalty of the 18th and
19th centuries, Likhachev said.
   The books damaged by moisture began to mold less than a week
after the fire, and the mold is a serious threat to cause long-term
damage, he said.
   Likhachev warned that the Institute of Russian literature, which
holds manuscripts of Pushkin, Dostoyevsky, Lermontov and other
famous Russian writers, was also in danger. That building has not
undergone capital repair in more than 150 years, he said.
   Likhachev's article was the most serious and alarming of several
that have appeared in the Soviet press since the fire, and was
particularly striking for its bitter tone.
   Filov was hospitalized after a series of official meetings, and
his assistant, V.P. Leonov, left for Switzerland, Likhachev said.
He called for replacement of library administrators, saying they
conducted themselves in an ``insufficiently civilized manner.''

<TEXT>
   Japan's leading English-language newspaper reported
today that Tokyo's new baseball stadium would have to be moved
because it sits on an ancient Shinto burial ground.
   Failure to relocate the 56,000-seat stadium would cause the
Yomiuri Giants to finish last this year, it warned.
   April Fool.
   But officials in the office of the just-opened Tokyo Dome,
Japan's first covered stadium, weren't laughing. They were busy
advising callers the story was an April Fools' Day joke.
   Callers weren't amused either. Japanese take baseball seriously.
And the Yomiuri Giants just don't expect to finish in last place.
   The story in the independent Japan Times said a Shinto priest
had discovered after the stadium opened in March that the
oval-shaped ``Big Egg'' was built partially on a Shinto burial
ground.
   The priest predicted the Giants, which share the stadium with
the Nippon Ham Fighters, would finish last in their division if the
stadium were not moved 40 yards to the north.
   Engineers had offered two solutions, the Times said. Some
preferred filling the domed stadium with helium gas and letting it
float the 40 yards. Others suggested that with the Japanese
tradition of hard work and with lots of and with lots of overtime,
the stadium could be dismantled and rebuilt on safe ground in time
for the April 8 season opener.
   A Times staffer told The Associated Press only that the
newspaper had received numerous inquiries, including a call from
the company that built the stadium, asking if the story were true.

   Defense Secretary Frank Carlucci said
today the United States would continue its close cooperation with
the moderate Arab government of Morocco.
   Carlucci began a three-day visit that was to include tours of
Moroccan military bases. On Sunday, he will fly to India and then
visit Pakistan and Tunisia before returning to Washington.
   On arrival, he praised ``the close links that have united our
two countries in the course of the past two centuries.''
   ``I am convinced that this cooperation with continue in the
future in the interest of our two countries and our two peoples,''
he said.
   American aid to Morocco in 1987 was $131 million, $35 million of
which was to help the government in its 13-year-long war against
Polisario guerrillas fighting for the independence of the former
Spanish Sahara.
   The defense secretary is to return to Washington on April 9.

<TEXT>
   A woman is suing the Bank of Boston for more than
$2 million, claiming the bank's refusal to honor her credit card
caused a hotel in the Philippines to seize her baby son until the
bill was paid.
   A judge earlier this week turned down the bank's motion to
dismiss the claims by Maria Luz Delulis, 39, of Lynn, said her
lawyer, Benjamin Glosband.
   Bank officials say Delulis had asked them to stop use of the
card.
   According to The Boston Herald, Delulis and her two children
were staying at the Royal Palm Hotel in Manila in December 1986.
   ``When it came time to check out, I presented my card from the
bank,'' she told the newspaper. ``After a delay, the clerk told me
it was invalid and refused to accept it.''
   She said hotel officials confiscated the card and took her to a
local police station.
   ``When I got back, the hotel manager told me my children could
not leave the hotel until the ($260) bill was paid,'' she said.
   Delulis said the manager later agreed to turn over her older
boy, but held onto her youngest son, William, then 7 months, as
collateral.
   She said she eventually got her children back after tourism
officials and the U.S. Embassy intervened.
   ``I became very traumatized and was unable to take care of my
business,'' Delulis said in the court papers. ``I was depressed and
am still under the treatment of a psychologist.''
   Bank spokesman Wayne Taylor said Thursday bank lawyers believe
Delulis' claims are groundless.

   First lady Nancy Reagan toured the $2.5
million home she and the president will share when the couple
leaves the White House.
   Mrs. Reagan, her press secretary, Elaine Crispen, and others in
her entourage didn't stop to meet with reporters when they visited
the mansion Thursday afternoon.
   Mrs. Reagan, who arrived in Los Angeles on Wednesday, checked
into the Beverly Wilshire Hotel. She was in town to see the house
and to take care of ``some business and tasks that she has to
perform,'' said Wendy Toler, the first lady's deputy press
secretary.
   Ms. Crispen said the first lady had seen the house before but
was taking another look while in town.
   The house has three bedrooms, six baths, guest room, living
room, family room, sun room, butler's pantry and three servants'
rooms. It's tucked away on a 1\-acre estate in exclusive Bel Air,
12 miles northwest of downtown Los Angeles.
   The Reagans' future home sits next door to the Kirkeby estate,
where the ``Beverly Hillbillies'' was filmed. Television producer
Jerry Perenchio recently bought Kirkeby for more than $13 million.
   The Reagans also will be neighbors to such entertainers as
Elizabeth Taylor, Joan Rivers, Zsa Zsa Gabor, Mac Davis and Burt
Bacharach.
   The president and his wife signed a three-year lease on the
ranch house within the last two weeks, Elaine Crispen, the first
lady's press secretary, said earlier this week. The house is owned
by Wall Management Services, a group of about 20 friends of the
Reagans who bought it with them in mind, she said.
   The three-year agreement gives the Reagans the option to renew
the lease or buy the property. The identity of the Wall Management
individuals and the amount of the lease payments were not disclosed.

   Communist rebels and soldiers fought
a four-hour battle that left four rebels and two soldiers dead, the
government-owned news agency reported today.
   The Philippine News Agency said three other rebels were wounded
and captured during the battle Thursday near the town of Guagua,
about 40 miles northeast of Manila. Two other soldiers were wounded.
   The encounter began around noon when some 30 New People's Army
guerrillas opened fire on a government patrol sent to verify
reports that rebels had been sighted in the area, the agency said.
   On Wednesday, security forces captured seven top communist
leaders in raids on two rebel hideouts in suburban Manila. Those
arrested included Romulo Kintanar, the alleged guerrilla commander;
Rafael Baylosis, secretary general of the Communist Party of the
Philippines; and Central Committee member Benjamin de Vera.
   President Corazon Aquino hailed the arrests as a major victory
and said it showed her government had turned the tide against the
rebels in their 19-year insurgency.

   President Reagan left today for a 10-day
Easter holiday after ordering new steps to force the ouster of
Panamanian strongman Manuel Antonio Noriega by tightening the
economic screws on his government.
   Shortly before departing for his California ranch, Reagan also
signed a $48 million humanitarian aid bill providing supplies to
Nicaragua's Contra rebels and medical care to war-injured children.
   The measure received final approval in the Senate on Thursday on
an 87-7 vote. Reagan signed the bill in his residence with no
fanfare. The signing was announced by a brief executive order
delegating responsibilities to various agencies to carry out
provisions of the law.
   Reagan, dogged in recent days about his embattled attorney
general, Edwin Meese III, and resignations at the Justice
Department, did not make any appearance in public Thursday and will
remain largely out of sight until April 10.
   His only appearance will be at a fund-raising event Monday in
Newport Beach, south of Los Angeles, for the Ronald Reagan library.
Construction on the library is expected to begin this summer at a
site in Ventura County.
   As part of the economic pressure against Noriega, the Internal
Revenue Service said today that American corporations' tax payments
to the government of Eric Arturo Delvalle, whom the United States
recognizes as president of Panama, will qualify for the U.S.
foreign tax credit.
   The announcement cleared the way for U.S. firms that operate in
Panama to pay taxes into a special account at the Federal Reserve
Bank of New York without jeopardizing the tax credit. The credit is
designed to avoid taxation of the same dollar of income by the
United States and a foreign country.
   The action cuts off a source of cash to the financially strapped
Noriega regime. The Reagan administration has expressed concern
that a recent infusion of cash, some of it from U.S. corporate tax
payments, may have temporarily strengthened Noriega's hold.
   Delvalle issued a decree on March 25 directing that income taxes
due the government of Panama be paid only to a New York Federal
Reserve Bank.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater, who outlined the series
of actions against Panama on Thursday, said he did know how much
money would be involved by the IRS step, but estimated it could
deprive Noriega of ``millions and millions.''
   The IRS announcement was one of a series of measures to deprive
Noriega's government of money from American companies and
individuals. Fitzwater said the administration would consider
making the measures mandatory if voluntary action proves
insufficient.
   The action follows the disclosure that some American firms _
including Texaco Inc. and Eastern Airlines _ paid taxes and fees
owed to Panama for doing business there, undercutting the economic
sanctions imposed by the United States on Panama.
   Announcing the new action, Fitzwater said, ``we are giving U.S.
companies and persons an incentive and opportunity not to provide
financial support to the Noriega regime.
   ``Should these measures prove insufficient, we will review
additional legal steps that may be necessary to deny transfer of
funds to the Noriega regime from U.S. companies and persons,''
Fitzwater said.
   Noriega is under indictment in the United States on drug
trafficking charges. As chief of the 15,000-member Defense Forces,
he is the power behind Panama's civilian government, although the
United States recognizes Eric Arturo Delvalle _ who is in hiding _
as the legitimate leader.
   Fitzwater said U.S. government payments owed the government of
Panama will be deposited in the Federal Reserve Bank in New York.
The United States already is withholding canal fees, toll payments
and other funds. Fitzwater said withholding taxes for U.S.
employees in Panama and rental payments also will go in the new
account.
   He also said the Justice Department will take part in legal
cases by private parties who owe debts to Panama, declaring
Delvalle the legitimate leader of the country. The U.S. Treasury
will help establish an account for payments in these cases.

<HEAD>Cease-fire Between Sandinistas and Contras Begins</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDS: LEADS throughout to ADD details. No pickup</NOTE>

<TEXT>
   The leftist Sandinista government and
the Contra rebels today began a formal 60-day cease-fire in their
6{-year war, but details remain to be negotiated next week.
   A spokesman for the Defense Ministry, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said there were no initial reports of violations of the
truce, which began at midnight.
   The cease-fire was worked out last week during peace talks
between the rebels and government negotiators in Sapoa, a post on
Nicaragua's southern border with Costa Rica.
   It was arranged to give both sides time to arrange a permanent
truce to bring an end to the fighting that has battered the country
since late 1981.
   The cease-fire is an extension of a temporary truce that began
March 21 during the peace talks.
   In technical discussions earlier this week at Sapoa, both sides
agreed in general terms on the size and location of five zones
where the rebels are to gather in the first 15 days of April.
   Two zones are in the northern part of the country, two on the
Caribbean coast and one in the south. Their exact locations have
not been disclosed.
   The two sides will resume talks next week, apparently to
determine details of the cease-fire, including what supplies the
rebels may receive and whether they must lay down their weapons.
   Technical discussions are to resume Tuesday in Sapoa, while
high-level negotiations between Sandinista and Contra leaders are
set for Wednesday in the capital of Managua.
   Under the peace agreement signed March 23, the Sandinistas will
grant freedom of expression and amnesty to political prisoners and
will allow rebel leaders to take part in national talks.
   The Contras, in turn, agreed to gather in the cease-fire zones
and accept only humanitarian aid from a neutral organization, such
as the International Red Cross.
   In Washington, President Reagan signed today a $48 million
non-lethal aid package for the Contras, but it probably will be at
least two weeks before the rebels begin receiving supplies under
the new legislation.
   ``There certainly is an urgent need among the (rebels) for
medical supplies, food, clothing, the basic commodities of life,''
said White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater. ``This bill is very
welcome in that regard and we support it.''
   U.S. aid to the Contras ended on Feb. 29.
   On Thursday, Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega expressed
concern that the measure called for the U.S. Agency for
International Development to deliver the aid to the rebels. He said
the Organization of American States should determine how the help
will be turned over to the Contras.
   Government offices and most stores were closed today to mark the
long Easter weekend. Many Nicaraguans went to the beaches on the
Pacific coastal for the holiday.

   The Internal Revenue Service has ordered its
agents to ignore more-restrictive court rulings in determining
whether certain stipends paid graduate students are subject to tax.
   The agency said it will rely instead on a 1975 revenue ruling
that allows some stipends to be excluded from taxation.
   The IRS announcement is aimed at clearing up confusion that
apparently has resulted in thousands of students being billed for
back taxes on their stipends because the district where they filed
returns decided the issue on the basis of court rulings.
   The announcement applies only to stipends earned before 1987. A
new law taxes most such post-1986 payments to the extent they
exceed the cost of tuition.
   Under the IRS announcement, pre-1987 stipend income is not taxed
if:
   _The student was a candidate for a degree,
   _The student performed research or other services for the collge
to satisfy requirements for the degree, and
   _Similar services were required of all degree candidates.
   Students who have been assessed additional taxes and who meet
those requirements should apply for a refund, if they have paid, or
an abatement, if they have not paid the extra amount, the IRS said.
Any such filing should note that it is being done for
reconsideration of whether the stipend is taxable.
   The agency promised to give quick attention to any such claims.

<HEAD>Attorney: IRS Wants to Revoke PTL's Tax-Exempt Status Regardless
of Effects</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SPARTANBURG, S.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An attorney for the Internal Revenue
Service told a federal appeals court the agency wants to revoke
PTL's tax-exempt status even if it means the end of the financially
troubled ministry.
   ``I don't understand why the IRS doesn't take a more practical
approach to this,'' Judge William Wilkins of the 4th U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals on Thursday told the lawyer, Francis Allegra.
   Allegra replied, ``The importance here is not just in this case,
but it will be felt in other cases.''
   Wilkins was part of a three-judge panel that heard an appeal
from the Fort Mill-based ministry to an earlier U.S. District Judge
ruling permitting the IRS to revoke the ministry's tax-exempt
status. Earlier this month, Wilkins granted a stay of that ruling
pending review by the appeals court, which is expected to make its
decision within two weeks.
   The IRS seeks to make the revocation retroactive to May 31,
1981. It contends that contributions funded the lavish lifestyles
of ministry founders Jim and Tammy Bakker, who resigned after a
scandal over a sexual encounter Bakker had with former church
secretary Jessica Hahn, and that much of PTL's Heritage Village USA
operations were commercial in nature.
   Allegra said failure to revoke PTL's tax-exempt status could
cost the federal government between $55 million and $82 million in
back taxes.
   PTL attorney R. Bradford Leggett told the judges that loss of
its tax-exempt status would jeopardize the ministry's ability to
reorganize itself under federal bankruptcy court protection by a
May 1 deadline.
   Wilkins suggested to Allegra that the IRS could jeopardize its
ability to collect back taxes if it succeeds in revoking PTL's
status before May 1.
   Allegra acknowleged the agency's action could jeopardize tax
payments, but he said to allow PTL a further stay is to invite
abuse, adding that the ministry could ask the court for additional
stays after May 1.
   PTL spokesman Dave West said the ministry is aware it will have
to settle with the IRS eventually.
   ``But if we do not continue under the protection of the
bankruptcy court, then the IRS can come in and supersede the work
of the bankruptcy court,'' West said.
   ``At the very minimum, the IRS' actions should be held in
abeyance,'' he said.
   PTL is in the midst of a ``March to Victory'' telethon that aims
to raise $4.2 million by May 1 to meet the bankruptcy court's
reorganization plan. The ministry has debts estimated at $60
million and so far has raised $2.2 million, West said.

   Independent counsel James McKay today was
preparing to issue a statement in the criminal investigation of
Attorney General Edwin Meese III that is somewhat favorable to the
attorney general, sources familiar with the probe said.
   However, McKay, who has been investigating Meese's involvement
through his longtime friend E. Robert Wallach with scandal-plagued
Wedtech Corp. and a $1 billion Iraqi oil pipeline, will continue
his criminal investigation, said the sources, who spoke on the
condition of anonymity.
   It wasn't immediately known what the independent counsel's
expected one-page statement would say, but one Justice Department
source said that ``on balance'' it is favorable to Meese.
   ``I'm not concerned about it,'' one of Meese's lawyers, James
Rocap, said when asked if the statement were favorable to Meese.
Rocap said the defense lawyers would have a statement of their own
later.
   Meanwhile, Justice Department sources said that later today
Meese was likely to announce the names of two, or possibly three,
nominees for now-vacant Justice Department posts.
   President Reagan, asked as he left the White House for an Easter
vacation in California, ``What about Meese. ... Should he quit?''
responded, ``I think you'll be hearing from him later today.''
   The department's top ranks were decimated Tuesday by the protest
resignations of Deputy Attorney General Arnold Burns and Assistant
Attorney General William Weld, head of the criminal division.
   In addition, the No. 3 Justice Department official, Stephen
Trott, is leaving to become a federal judge.
   Meese is expected to announce replacements for Trott and Weld,
and possibly Burns, said one Justice Department source, who
requested anonymity.
   The replacement for Weld is James I.K. Knapp, a deputy in the
Justice Department's tax division who previously worked in the
criminal division.
   The replacement for Trott is Francis A. Keating II, now the
assistant Treasury secretary for enforcement, a position that
involves overseeing criminal investigations of money laundering and
other crimes. Keating oversees the Customs Service, the Secret
Service and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms.
   The swift appointments by Meese are an attempt to quell mounting
calls for his resignation.
   Earlier in the day, the Justice Department's fourth-ranking
official, who reportedly tried but failed to get Meese to resign,
said he would stay on the job so long as he can work ``with
integrity and effectiveness.''
   The statement by Solicitor General Charles Fried was devoid of
any other expression of support for Meese other than to say that
the solicitor general would stay on for the time being.
   In a prepared statement, Fried said he had had a private
conversation with Meese on Wednesday ``to tell him clearly what
course of action I thought he should follow.''
   Fried refused to tell reporters what that recommended course
was. The New York Times, however, said that Fried had urged Meese
to quit but that Meese had rejected the suggestion.
   ``I have concluded that while I am able to lead the office of
the solicitor general with integrity and effectiveness in its
special responsibilities to the law, to the United States and to
the Supreme Court, I should continue to do so,'' Fried's statement
said.
   Fried said pointedly that ``I will not accept any other
positions in the Department of Justice,'' which was rocked Tuesday
by the resignations of Burns and Weld.
   Fried's statement referred to the special, almost autonomous
nature, of the solicitor general's office in connection with the
rest of the Justice Department. Fried's office is responsible for
arguing the government's positions before the U.S. Supreme Court.
His statement referred to ``the two departments'' _ his office and
the Justice Department.
   ``As course, I serve only at the pleasure of the president,''
said the solicitor general. ``As for the attorney general, I felt
it was my duty to him and to the two departments to tell him
clearly what course of action I thought he should follow.
   ``I did that Wednesday in a private conversation.''
   Retired Associate Justice of the Supreme Court Lewis F. Powell
Jr. said Fried had called him Monday evening, ``very upset and
concerned, and very perplexed about what he should do,'' according
to the Times.
   Monday was the day that Burns and Weld made their decision to
quit out of concern that Meese's continued tenure as attorney
general was hurting the operations of and undermining public
confidence in the Justice Department. The resignations were
announced the next day.
   Powell said that Fried had indicated to him that ``once he found
out what the facts were, he'd have to keep in mind that he had an
obligation to the Court,'' according to the Times.
   Meese has been under criminal investigation for nearly 11 months.
   Meanwhile, Meese is facing growing pressure from Republicans as
well as Democrats to resign.
   Meese met Thursday with Republican Sen. Strom Thurmond, who said
a number of people on Capitol Hill have expressed ``deep concern
about the problems at the Justice Department.''
   Thurmond is the ranking Republican on the Senate Judiciary
Committee and the discussion was the strongest sign to date of
growing bipartisan concern in Congress over whether the attorney
general's mounting legal problems are dragging down his department.
   Thurmond said he was not making any judgments, but that he would
not ``countenance any corruption in any way, shape or form in the
Justice Department or any other department.''
   Wallach, a San Francisco attorney who is now under indictment in
the Wedtech scandal, is at the heart of the criminal investigation
of Meese that began last May 11. The independent counsel has been
trying to determine whether Wallach or others paid off Meese in
exchange for his official acts on behalf of Wedtech or the pipeline
project.
   In an interview published Thursday in the San Jose (Calif.)
Mercury News, Wallach said he should have been more sensitive to
the appearance of impropriety in helping Meese set up a financial
partnership with investment manager W. Franklyn Chinn, who later
joined Wedtech's board. Both Chinn and Wallach have been indicted
on racketeering charges related to Wedtech.
   Wallach also said in the interview that Meese had ``nothing
absolutely'' to do with a $150,000 payment Wallach received from
Swiss financier Bruce Rappaport in connection with the Iraqi
pipeline plan.
   Rappaport, a partner in the pipeline project, had been scheduled
to give a deposition about the case to McKay last month but backed
out and has apparently decided not to cooperate with the
investigation, The Washington Post reported today.
   The newspaper, quoting unidentified sources in Washington and
abroad, said Rappaport changed his mind at the last minute because
he was afraid he might not remember everything accurately.
   Rappaport was to have been given immunity from prosecution in
the case.

   The grandson of former University of Texas
football coach Darrell Royal has been released after being charged
with stealing part of an Albert Einstein manuscript.
   Samuel Royal, 18, who is not a student at the university, was
released Thursday on his personal recognizance from the Travis
County Jail following his arrest Wednesday night.
   Investigators said a telephoned tip led them to the younger
Royal's apartment Tuesday where a page of the manuscript was found
in a photo album, along with photographs of his grandfather, the
University of Texas' football coach from 1957 through 1976.
   ``Sammy is my grandson, and I love him, but I will not attempt
to interfere with the normal process of justice,'' said Darrell
Royal, who now serves as special assistant to the university's
President William Cunningham.
   The felony theft charge carries a maximum punishment of 20 years
in prison.

   For about $3,000, Japanese tourists can see the
Great Wall, eat Peking duck and grow hair with Zhao Zhangguang's
mysterious, magical hair-restoring tonic.
   A tour bus arrived Friday carrying 98 bald and thin-haired
Japanese for their first treatment with 101 Hair Liniment, a liquid
made from a secret recipe of about 30 medicinal herbs.
   It is the second Japanese group, following 20 who arrived in
February, to come to China on a package tour that includes
treatment at Zhao's clinic at the Jinsong hospital in eastern
Beijing.
   Among the first 20, ``some have already started to grow hair,''
said Kenichi Morita, president of China-Japan Treatment
Headquarters, a private Tokyo medical firm sponsoring the tours.
   Most of the Japanese said they signed up for the trip after
reading in newspapers of the miraculous results of 101, which Zhao,
a former farmer with only six years of formal education, developed
after 10 years of private research.
   Dr. Liu Qirong, the chief of 12 dermatologists at Zhao's clinic,
said about 2,700 Chinese have been treated in the past year, with
92 percent showing some new growth of hair. For people who have
lost hair in patches, the success rate is 100 percent, she said.
   According to the official news agency Xinhua, more than 100,000
people have been treated with 101 since production began a year
ago, with an improvement rate of 97.5 percent and a cure rate of 84
percent.
   Zhao's results haven't been independently verified.
   By comparison, the anti-baldness drug minoxidil, recommended for
approval by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, had a success
rate of 26 percent of men in the 40-49 age group. For those under
30, the growth rate was 54 percent, and it was 41 percent to 45
percent in the 31-39 age group.
   Zhao's liniment, Liu said, works by stimulating circulation of
the blood and cleaning out hair follicles. A second medicine, 102,
is available to ensure that the new hair will not fall out.
   One slightly balding 40-year-old man from Osaka, Japan, said he
read about the cure in a magazine and decided to join the tour
because ``it's better to have hair than not to have hair.''
   For some, it is more serious. Yuji Matsuishi, a 6-year-old from
Fukuoka, lost all his hair 18 months ago, and Japanese doctors have
had no success in either identifying or solving the problem, said
his grandmother, Yoshie Kuga.
   ``We have high hopes. Nothing else has worked,'' she said.
   Doctors said the tonic works better on people whose hair loss is
fairly recent, and they were optimistic Yuji's hair could start
coming back after a month or two of treatment.
   They said treatment generally consists of dabbing the liquid
onto the scalp several times a day for about six months or as long
as it takes for hair to grow back.
   The only side-effect, Liu said, is that the scalp often turns a
brownish color before the hair returns.
   One bottle of 101, which lasts for about a month, sells for
about $12 in China, but Morita said the price will soon shoot up to
about $30. The Chinese government, which has not given official
approval to the medicine, has given Zhao the go-ahead to cash in on
his drug.
   The treatment is undergoing clinical tests in China and cannot
be sold in stores or hospitals here or in any other country. It
can, however, be purchased directly from Zhao's clinic for personal
use.
   Zhao, who once had to sell his only pig to obtain money needed
to continue his research, now operates two factories, one in
central China's Zhengzhou and the other in Beijing. The Beijing
plant earned profits of about $135,000 in its first year, the
official China Daily reported.
   Liu said people from Japan, West Germany, Hong Kong, Singapore,
the United States and other countries have written about the
treatment or come to the clinic, and they hope to begin exporting
it once the medicine is approved by various health agencies.
   ``We're not in this for profit,'' Liu said. ``We're trying to
cure people, and when people are cured, it makes us happy.''

   The official moment comes at 2 a.m., when clocks should be reset
to 3 a.m. Most people, however, will simply do the job before
retiring Saturday night.
   Standard time will return on Oct. 30.
   It is the second year that daylight-saving time will begin on

   Democratic presidential candidate Michael
Dukakis said today that corporate greed has left ``the average
working men and women of America holding the bag'' while the rich
get richer.
   Dukakis, injecting a note of populism into his campaign speech,
struck out at corporate greed he said was fostered by the Reagan
administration.
   ``Wall Street pirates and corporate hit teams aren't the model
for a new America,'' Dukakis said.
   ``If we're serious about winning the battle for our economic
future, we've got to get control of the merger and acquisition
binge that's gobbling up capital, tearing corporations apart like
erector sets, making millions of dollars for a few ... and leaving
the average working men and women of America holding the bag,'' he
said.
   On Thursday, Dukakis said his experience as Massachusetts
governor would make him a better president than Jesse Jackson, but
he refused to criticize the rival who is running neck-and-neck with
him in Wisconsin primary polls.
   ``I want to win this nomination and unite this party at the same
time,'' he said at a news conference.
   Dukakis also called for the resignation of Attorney General
Edwin Meese III, a call made earlier in the day by Jackson, who
also was campaigning in Wisconsin.
   ``The Justice Department is still in turmoil and I guess (that)
will continue until we have a new attorney general and it's about
time we did,'' Dukakis said. ``I would hope at long last the
attorney general would resign _ it's long overdue _ and the
president would appoint somebody as attorney general we could be
proud of.''
   Dukakis' remarks followed a speech at Serb Hall, a traditional
rallying point for presidential candidates in Wisconsin, where
Dukakis said the Reagan administration ``has walked away from the
American dream.''
   Asked why he considered himself more qualified than Jackson,
Dukakis said, ``I think I am going to be a better president because
I think I've got the strength, the experience and the values to
lead this country; because I'm somebody who not only believes in
good jobs and good wages for people, I've helped to create them.''
   Dukakis also cited his efforts in Massachusetts to combat
homelessness and drug abuse in schools.
   ``That's why I'm running. That's why I think I would be the best
nominee and the best president. I respect the other candidates.
They have their strengths and weaknesses as all of us do. We all
share a lot of common values and goals, but if there is one
strength I believe I bring to this campaign it is as a proven chief
executive and leader who has done these things.''
   Dukakis said he is the candidate ``who understands how you take
hopes and dreams and transform them into action.''
   Dukakis' speech, in which he accused the Reagan administration
of embracing programs for the rich and of excessive military
spending at the expense of working men and women, was new.
   He denied it was a response to criticism that he lacked passion
in his campaigning.
   ``I just thought it was time. You guys' eyes were glazing over a
little bit and I just thought it was time to give you something
new,'' Dukakis told reporters.

<TEXT>
   A town marshal who was believed to
have been kidnapped told his family today that he managed to escape
from four men who had held him captive in an abandoned house and in
a car trunk, officials said.
   Police had launched an intense manhunt for Gary Stokes after he
disappeared early Thursday while investigating an apparent burglary
in this tiny northeast Mississippi town.
   Stokes ``told his father that they let him out of the trunk
early today to go to the restoom and, as he walked over some
railroad tracks figuring he had a 50-50 chance to live, he ran into
the woods,'' said Mayor Robert P. Godwin.
   Stokes was unharmed and resting at his family home, state and
Tippah County authorities said.
   ``About all I can tell you is that he is back and we are
investigating,'' said Tippah County Sheriff Leroy Meeks said today.
   Officers ``are treating this as a kidnapping,'' said Deputy
Sheriff Carl Gillard. Meeks, however, declined to confirm that
Stokes had been abducted.
   Stokes disappeared early Thursday and authorities feared he may
have been taken captive by someone trying to break into a storage
room behind a store in Blue Mountain, a northern Mississippi town
of about 860 residents.
   City Clerk Billie Morgan said today her office was told that
Stokes, the town's only full-time policeman, had walked to a house
in the town of Myrtle in neighboring Union County ``and called in
about 3 a.m. I understand he told officers that he was abducted.''
   Police had used tracking dogs in the rain as they searched for
Stokes in rural areas around Blue Mountain all day Thursday and
well into the night. A helicopter search had been planned today.
   Meeks had said officers from surrounding counties, firemen and
civilians had helped deputies in the search.
   Meeks said Stokes, 35, radioed the nearby Ripley Police
Department for backup while investigating the possible burglary
early Thursday.
   ``When the units arrived, he was nowhere to be found,'' the
sheriff said.
   Morgan said officers found Stokes' car with the engine still
running, the lights on and his radio microphone hanging outside the
door.
   ``The officers reported they found his police pistol on the
ground, with one bullet fired, and his empty billfold nearby,''
Morgan said.
   However, Meeks said investigators were uncertain when the bullet
was fired. He said no evidence was found that anyone had been
wounded at the scene.
   Authorities issued a bulletin for a car with four occupants that
apparently was seen in the area about the time Stokes radioed in.
   ``We are checking every possibility and we don't know if those
men had anything to do with all this,'' the sheriff said.

   John Cremens isn't ready to leave this world. But
when the time comes, he hopes to settle his bones among famous
early Americans in one of the city's two 300-year-old cemeteries.
   During the nation's 1976 bicentennial, the 65-year-old trial
lawyer commanded the Ancient and Honorable Artillery Company, a
now-cermonial militia that marks its 350th anniversary June 1.
   He hopes to make his last stop with John Winthrop, the state's
first governor; William Dawes, who rode with Paul Revere; the first
woman to get off the Mayflower, and the woman some say was
Nathaniel Hawthorne's model for Hester Prynne, who wore the scarlet
letter.
   Cremens wants to be buried in the King's Chapel Burying Ground
tomb of Capt. Robert Keayne, the militia's first commander. Cremens
said Thursday he belongs there as the bicentennial commander.
   An ordinance the City Council passed last week permits Cremens'
burial in the tomb or across Tremont Street in the Granary Burying
Ground, where he would join Paul Revere, John Hancock, Samuel
Adams, and, some say, ``Mother Goose.''
   But the cemeteries are full.
   And some other militia members say it's not clear Cremens
belongs there.
   A real militia established to protect colonists, the Ancient and
Honorable lost its orgininal purpose before the Civil War. But it
was never disbanded and remains the world's third-oldest surviving
militia, exceeded by its English counterpart and the papal Swiss
Guards.
   Nowadays, the group mainly raises money for charity.
   Cremens's request is expected to be discussed Monday, at the
next militia meeting.
   Member Bert Caldwell said opening Keayne's tomb, already jammed
with 36 coffins, would undo two years and $7,500 of restoration.
   ``You effectively have to make an archaeological dig. I don't
know if it's worth it. ... It's best to let sleeping patriots lie.''
   Although the city's 16 historic cemeteries are full, title
holders to underground tombs can open them for more bodies with the
city's permission.
   Ellen Lipsey, preservation planner for the city parks
department, said a new body is buried every 20 years or so.
   If Cremens doesn't get into the Keayne tomb, he must find
another tomb and get the titleholders to let him in, then get the
park department's permission.
   Parks Commissioner William Coughlin said if the militia is
reluctant to open the tomb it's unlikely the department will
approve.
   Cremens said that whatever happens, he's pleased for the
opportunity to be buried among heroes of the past.
   ``It's a great honor. I'm very happy to be there in that great
company, to be part of the history of this country and to be
remembered in the prayers of people passing by ... I hope it
doesn't happen soon.''

   Jews celebrated the first night of Passover and
Christians carrying crosses marked Good Friday under heavy military
and police guard that was mobilized to prevent violence after four
months of Arab protests.
   Fewer tourists than usual filled Israel's hotels, normally
packed to capacity during Passover week. Tourism officials blamed
it on the fear among foreigners, mainly U.S. Jews, because of the
fatal riots.
   Police commissioner David Kraus told Israel army radio extra
units of officers patrolled cities and holiday sites.
   In Jerusalem's walled Old City, hundreds of Christian pilgrims
carrying crosses and singing psalms traced the route Jesus walked
to his crucifixion, but the crowd was thinner than usual.
   An Arab attacker stabbed an Israeli police lieutenant in the
stomach just 20 yards from the processional route. The soldier was
in fair condition.
   The Greek Orthodox Church canceled two pre-Easter processions
due to security concerns and an expected drop in tourism. Western
Christians celebrate Easter on Sunday, while Orthodox Christians
observe it this year on April 10.
   The original Good Friday occurred during Passover, but the
holidays don't usually coincide because the two religions use
different calendars.
   Friday also was the Moslem Sabbath, which in recent months has
been a catalyst for violent demonstrations.
   In Jewish west Jerusalem, few signs of recent tensions were
evident as Israeli shoppers jammed stores buying flowers and candy
to give relatives, a Passover tradition. Children, on a two-week
school holiday, filled the streets eating ice cream and candy.
   Passover, which commemorates the liberation of Jews from slavery
in Egypt, derives its name from the biblical Book of Exodus. The
book recounts that God ``passed over'' the homes of the Israelites
when meeting out the worst of 10 plagues, killing the first-born of
every Egyptian.
   The plagues finally forced the Egyptian Pharoah to let the Jews
leave Egypt.
   The story of the exodus is recounted every year in the seder,
the traditional holiday meal. Participants take turns reading
excerpts from the Hagadah, a book of stories, rabbinical sayings
and lively songs of thanksgiving.
   Symbolic foods are eaten, including bitter herbs to remind Jews
of the harshness of their enslavement and haroset, a brick-colored
mixture of apples, nuts and wine to recall the bricks laid by
Jewish slaves.
   But the best-known symbol is matzo, the unleavened bread eaten
during Passover week. Matzo reminds Jews that when they departed
Egypt, they had no time to let their bread rise and so had to take
unleavened bread into the desert.
   In Israel, stores are forbidden to sell leavened bread during
Passover. But many secular Jerusalemites circumvent the
restrictions and buy pita, the pocket-shaped Middle Eastern bread,
from Arab merchants in east Jerusalem.
   The practice was expected to be more difficult this year with
virtually every Arab merchant there on a partial strike.
   Life returned to the Old City on Friday when hundreds of
Christian pilgrims crowded the Via Dolorosa, or Way of Sorrow,
tracing Jesus' steps to his crucifixion. Priests carried ornate
silver and gold crosses and burned incense.
   ``We planned to come here for a long time and nothing could stop
us, even friends who said we were crazy,'' said David Reid of
Mountain Lakes, N.J. ``There are lots of police around and we are
as safe here as we are in New York City.''
   The procession ended at the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, built
in the 12th century on the site where the faithful believe Jesus
was crucified, buried and raised from the dead on Easter Sunday.
   Pilgrims kissed and threw water on the rock marking the spot
where Jesus' body was washed before burial, while 16 choir boys in
black robes sang prayers.
   Arab merchants opened their shops for the three hours permitted
by the Palestine Liberation Organization to sell olive-wood
crosses, doing brisk business.
   Tourism officials said more visitors came to Israel in January
and February as compared with the previous year, but 13 percent
fewer tourists entered the country during the first week in March.
   The Rev. Timoteus Margaritis, a spokesman for the Greek Orthodox
Christian Church, said 1,500 pilgrims were expected to attend his
church's April 10 Easter service, instead of the usual 10,000.

   A former banker who went on a spending spree with
funds from his thrift after learning he had AIDS has pleaded guilty
to misappropriating more than $1 million.
   William Patrick Debenport, 27, said he gave some of the money to
gay charities after being told he had acquired immune deficiency
syndrome.
   Debenport pleaded guilty Thursday to three counts of
misappropriation, admitting he illegally used his position as
manager of First Texas Savings and Loan's Oak Cliff branch to
misappropriate $1.1 million from it.
   Documents filed with Debenport's plea show he established fake
accounts, transferring money to them and then removing the funds by
writing cashier's checks.
   He faces up to 15 years in prison and $3,000 in fines at
sentencing May 5.
   His lawyer, Steven Cooper, said earlier that Debenport used most
of the money to buy luxuries for himself and gifts for friends, but
also donated some to charities, including $175,000 to a Dallas home
for AIDS sufferers.

   Jesse Jackson the politician often becomes
Jesse Jackson the history teacher these days, taking his
presidential campaign to high schools as often as to union halls or
churches.
   From the inner city school in Inkster, Mich., to Pulaski High in
the heart of southside Milwaukee, the Democratic presidential
candidate delivers his sermon of self-respect, a drug-free and
violence-free life and the need to achieve.
   ``I go to four or five high schools a week in the course of
every week, because I love our children, because I care, because
their lives are at stake,'' Jackson told students in Inkster, near
Detroit. ``You are our energy.''
   In the high school speeches there is always a political message
_ ``Come alive, April 5'' was the chant he taught at Pulaski, in
advance of the Wisconsin primary on Tuesday.
   But Jackson has other goals as well, for in 1988 he emphasizes
the course of the fight for equal rights for a generation that
looks at the 1950s and 1960s as ancient history.
   Jackson tells the story of Rosa Parks, whose refusal to go to
the back of the bus in Montgomery, Ala., sparked demonstrations
that pushed Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. to prominence in 1955.
   Jackson, a King protege, talks of the role young people played
in the civil rights struggle, saying that King was only 26 when the
Montgomery bus boycott began and that college students led the
lunch counter sit-ins in Greensboro, N.C. that inaugurated a new
tactic in the fight for desegregated public accommodations.
   ``In 1960, four student in Greemsboro, N.C. sat at a lunch
counter to get hamburgers. They got handcuffs,'' Jackson said at
Pulaski High School. ``They were threatened with expulsion from
school. They chose dignity over degrees. They kept fighting to make
America better.''
   Some Pulaski students may have had family members who had
personal experience with the civil rights movement. It is in the
heart of Southside Milwaukee, an all-white neighborhood that was
the scene of ugly, sometimes violent confrontations during open
housing marches of the 1960s.
   Jackson also talks in sometimes brutal terms of the price that
was paid in the civil rights movement, reading down the list of
those who were killed in the fight. Often his images are harsh, as
in his description of one civil rights marcher's death.
   ``Her brains were blown out at point-blank range by a shotgun,''
he told students at Stevenson High School in Sterling Heights, Mich.
   After recounting how far the nation has come, Jackson turns to
the problems of today.
   ``Each generation must face the challenges of its own time,'' he
told Pulaski students.
   At Inkster, the message was more direct to an audience of about
1,500 mostly black students.
   ``After years of struggle, we have obtained equal protection
under the law. You have opportunity. When I went to school, we did
not have equal opportunity,'' said Jackson, who grew up poor in
South Carolina.
   ``Obviously opportunity is not enough. ... What does it matter
if you have equal opportunity if your players are drunk on the
court? What does it matter if you have a new book or an old book if
you never open either?''
   This theme Jackson uses to launch into his crusade against drugs.
   ``The No. 1 threat in your lifetime is not lack of opportunity _
it is concession to the No. 1 killer in the country today _
drugs,'' he said at Inkster.
   Then Jackson repeats a litany to bring home the pervasiveness of
the problems he is attacking. He asks how many students know
someone who has died from drugs. Usually, a scattering stand up.
   Then he asks how many know someone who is in jail because of
drugs. More stand. Then the question is, how many know someone who
uses drugs. In most schools, everyone stands.
   He repeats the question and response pattern about knowledge of
young people who have brought guns to school and knowledge of
contemporaries who contemplated suicide. In each case, a remarkable
number of students stand.
   The preacher-turned-politician is quick to issue a reminder that
this is not a limited problem.
   ``Lest you forget, members of the press, whether we are in the
heart of rural Iowa or in Inkster, Mich., or Seattle, Wash., or
Pasadena, Calif., this is the scene all over America every day,''
he said in the Detroit suburb. ``So I reach out to young America
today to provide positive and creative energy to keep America
strong and to make America better.''

   A fugitive arrested recently in Florida could
shed light on the celebrated but still unsolved ``French
Connection'' drug theft case, a federal prosecutor says.
   Anthony Dominick Passero, 53, was arrested Feb. 10 in Florida on
an outstanding money laundering indictment filed in New York in
1984 that named one of his many aliases, Anthony Paris, U.S.
Attorney Andrew Maloney said Thursday.
   It was not until Tuesday, when authorities received a report on
a fingerprint check, that they realized Paris was Passero.
   He ``may be the last living guy who could solve the French
Connection thefts,'' Maloney said.
   Passero was identified by Maloney as an alleged partner of the
late Vincent Papa, who was suspected of being the mastermind of the
theft of $70 million worth of heroin and cocaine from the property
clerk's office in city Police Headquarters from 1968 to 1972.
   Much of the heroin had been seized in the ``French Connection''
drug case, the basis for the movie of the same name starring Gene
Hackman and Roy Scheider.
   Papa, who had alleged ties to the Luchese organized crime
family, was stabbed to death in 1977 while in an Atlanta prison on
other drug charges.
   Maloney said no one had ever been arrested for the drug thefts,
allegedly committed by a group of police detectives.
   In addition to the money laundering charges, Passero faces
charges from a 1975 heroin trafficking indictment. He also was
charged in 1975 with perjury and criminal contempt in connection
with the investigation into the French Connection thefts,
authorities said.
   Passero, focus of an Internal Revenue Service investigation for
many years, had been living in a $475,000 home at Pompano, Fla.,
under the alias of Anthony Caruso. Five IRS agent and two Pompano
police officers arrested Passero and his common-law wife, Marie
Barbieri, 45, at their home Feb. 10.
   Both waived extradition.
   Both were named in the money laundering indictment, which
alleges they laundered about $750,000 from January 1980 to March
1981. Passero told authorities he was a retired truck driver and
scrap metal dealer, Maloney said.

   A fraternity organized by homosexual men has
been approved by the University of California, which last month
approved a lesbian sorority.
   The 11-member Delta Lambda Phi fraternity was recognized
Thursday.
   ``Gay people need a lot of support in their college years,''
said senior Jason Howe, the group's president. ``They are trying to
come to grips with growing up, getting through college and getting
a career. But they also have to come to grips with their
sexuality.''
   The fraternity is a spinoff of a Washington-based organization
trying to form chapters at campuses around the country.
   ``We are trying to encourage socializing outside of the bar
environment and its negative emphasis on alcohol and drugs,'' said
fraternity adviser Chris Williamson.
   Official recognition means Delta Lambda Phi can use the school's
name, meet on campus and apply for student activities funds, said
Chris Fishburn, UCLA's director of fraternity and sorority
relations.
   The fraternity cannot discriminate against heterosexuals, if any
apply.

<HEAD>Insulation Problem With Space Shuttle Booster Rocket Is Minor</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>

   Technicians will be able to repair a
minor insulation problem on a booster rocket without delaying the
space shuttle flight planned for August, NASA said Friday.
   During an inspection Wednesday, workers found four small areas
where insulation had separated from the rocket casing on the bottom
edge of one of four segments that make up the right solid fuel
rocket. The largest was 1.4 inches.
   There was concern that if the separation extended deeper into
the insulation, the segment would have to be replaced, which could
cause a launch delay of several weeks.
   Ultrasound devices were used overnight Thursday to thoroughly
inspect the segment and no additional separation or ``debonding''
was discovered.
   ``There was no evidence the debonding extended beyond the
edge,'' said NASA spokeswoman Lisa Malone. ``It can be repaired
here with no impact on the schedule.''
   Malone said similar debondings had been found on other rocket
segments in the past and they were repaired here in parallel with
other work. Severe debonding could lead to the breakup of a rocket
in flight and destroy the shuttle.
   Various technical problems have caused two lengthy delays from
the original February 1988 launch date. The target date now is Aug.
4.
   The shuttle fleet has been grounded since Challenger exploded
Jan. 28, 1986, killing the seven crew members. That accident was
caused by another booster rocket problem _ a faulty joint between
segments that allowed flames to escape and ignite the external fuel
tank for the main liquid fuel engines.
   The joint has been redesigned and has successfully passed
several test firings.
   On the first post-Challenger mission, Discovery is to carry five
crew members who will deploy a communications satellite and conduct
experiments during a four-day mission.

<HEAD>Reagan Signs Contra Aid Bill, Begins Vacation</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDs: Reagan scheduled to arrive in California at 3:40 p.m. EST</NOTE>

   President Reagan signed a $48 million aid for
Nicaraguan Contras and war victims Friday and then headed to
California for a 10-day Easter vacation.
   Reagan signed the legislation in his White House residence,
forgoing the ceremonial fanfare that attends some bill-signings.
   Only $17.7 million of the $48 million will go to the Nicaraguan
rebels, and the aid package contains no provision for weapons and
ammunition. The bill could be the last of its kind that Reagan
signs, given the truce agreement the Contras signed March 23 in
Sapoa, Nicaragua, with the ruling Sandinista regime.
   The aid package, which also contains $17.7 million to finance
rehabilitation and treatment of children injured on both sides of
the 7-year-old conflict, was passed overwhelmingly by both the
House and Senate earlier this week.
   Besides the money for Contra rebels and Nicaraguan children,
roughly $10 million will be sent to a verification commission to
monitor compliance with the cease-fire.
   Presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater told reporters aboard
Air Force One en route to California that the president had said
the aid was ``urgently needed, that he wanted to sign it as soon as
possible.''
   The president also hoped ``the cease-fire talks on April 5 are
productive in getting the Sandinistas to bring about democratic
reforms.''
   Fitzwater also noted that a United Nations investigative team
has returned from Central America where it looked into the recent
fighting along the Nicaraguan-Honduran border and the temporary
deployment some 3,100 U.S. troops in Honduras.
   Although the White House has not yet seen the team's report,
Fitzwater said press reports have said the U.N. panel's findings
``confirm the Nicaraguan invasion of Honduras, that they have
photographic evidence of the fighting, and that the U.S. exercises
were a success. If those reports are right, why, we're very
gratified and satisfied.''
   Reagan's signing of the bill was his last major chore before
leaving on the 10-day vacation at his beloved Rancho del Cielo in
the Santa Ynez Mountains near Santa Barbara.
   Reagan's adopted son, Michael Reagan, accompanied the president
aboard Air Force One, but remained in private quarters aboard the
aircraft and did not speak with reporters.
   The younger Reagan's book detailing his early life, including
being a victim of child molestation by a camp counselor, was
published recently.
   The president was to be reunited in California with first lady
Nancy Reagan, who flew to Los Angeles on Wednesday. She paid a
visit to the $2.5 million, ranch-style mansion the couple plans to
lease when Reagan's term ends next January.
   That wasn't the only looking-ahead note to the couple's spring
vacation. The president's only appearance in California will be at
a fund-raising event Monday in Newport Beach, south of Los Angeles,
for the Ronald Reagan library. Construction on the library is
expected to begin this summer at a site in Ventura County.
   Fitzwater also said Reagan will address the National Association
of Broadcasters meeting April 10 in Las Vegas, Nev. The spokesman
indicated the president's general subject would be foreign affairs
and the theme before an expected audience of about 4,000
broadcasters would be ``Broadcasting and Democracy: a Winning
Ticket.''
   Financial support to the Contras has been shut off since Feb.
29, and the House twice last month voted down assistance packages.
   A State Department official said it probably will be be at least
two weeks before the Contras begin receiving supplies under the new
legislation because of the time required to gear up for a new
delivery effort.
   Approximately $2.5 million of the $48 million aid package will
be given to the department's Agency for International Development,
which will administer the aid program.

<HEAD>Mandatory Tests for Kindergarteners To Start in Georgia</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SONYA ROSS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Georgia's 93,000 kindergarten pupils begin taking
mandatory tests next week that will partially determine whether
they will enter first grade in the fall.
   Some parents and educators oppose the tests.
   Last week, the National Association for the Education of Young
Children and the National Association of Early Childhood
Specialists in State Departments of Education issued policy
statements opposed to such mass standardized testing of
kindergartners.
   Such indiscriminate testing, the groups said, means ``many
kindergartens are now highly structured, `watered down' first
grades, emphasizing workbooks and other paper-and-pencil activities
that are developmentally inappropriate for 5-year-olds.''
   Georgia is the first state to make such testing mandatory,
although individual school districts such as Minneapolis have
similar programs.
   Georgia education officials say those who are outraged over
standardized tests of 5-year-olds to measure their ability to
recognize sounds, letters and basic math concepts are making
mountains out of molehills.
   ``I think it's more important to focus on the entire process,
because there's much more to it than testing,'' said Sharon
Meinhardt, coordinator of the Georgia Department of Education's
early childhood education program.
   Ms. Meinhardt said if a child does not achieve the required
score, education officials will use both the test and the
recommendation of the child's teacher in deciding whether the child
is ready for first grade.
   ``There are a lot of scared parents out there _ I've talked to
them,'' Ms. Meinhardt said. ``When I have had a chance to talk to a
lot of the parents and tell them we are going to look at more than
the test, there's not a parent who left the conversation without
saying `I feel better.'''
   The testing policy, approved by the state Board of Education in
February, is mandated by the Quality Basic Education Act to
identify children in need of special help, and students who are
held back will be placed in an alternative kindergarten program.
   But some educators say assurances from state officials will not
make them feel better about testing such young children.
   ``Our state legislators feel that this test will reduce our
relatively high first-grade failure rate by weeding out those
children who are not yet ready to attend first grade,'' said
Marilyn B. Gootman, assistant professor of elementary education at
the University of Georgia. ``Instead, the test wastes precious
learning time and places unnecessary stress on our children.''
   ``We are very supportive of testing and assessing young
children, but we are against one 90-minute assessment in a child's
kindergarten year to predict readiness,'' said Judy Jefferson,
Gwinnett County's coordinator of primary programs and an official
of the Metro Council for Early Childhood.
   Atlanta child psychologist Asa Hilliard said the tests have ``a
disproportionate impact on those children who need school the most,
the minority children.''
   Stan Berknopf, director of the education department's assessment
program, said parental distress over testing kindergarteners will
not prompt the state to change the law.
   ``Their anxiety for the most part is probably misplaced,''
Berknopf said. ``We expect over 90 percent of the students to do
very well.''
   Ms. Meinhardt said education officials recommend that parents
treat the test as they would any other school activity and not
pressure their children.
   ``There should be no great production made of it,'' she said.
``Teachers are feeling a considerable amount of pressure, either
from their own minds or from other people in their school system.
There is no way some of that pressure is not being transferred to
the children.''
   The Department of Education's assessment department estimates
that about 90 of the state's 186 school systems will begin testing
next week, and the rest will start the following week.

   Beginning Friday, drug dealers operating
in Utah must visit the State Tax Commission and buy an official
drug tax stamp created just for them, or else they'll face
additional charges when they're arrested.
   ``This is not the case of a state agency or the state
Legislature condoning the use of illicit drugs,'' said Tax
Commission spokesman Lee Shaw. ``The drug stamp program is actually
a law enforcement tool, not a Tax Commission initiative. The drug
stamps are just another means of applying legal pressure in the
prosecution of drug dealers.''
   When a dealer is arrested, law enforcement officers will check
to see if his drugs have the stamp. If they do not, the dealer
faces a third-degree felony in addition to any other charges, Shaw
said.
   That could prove helpful in punishing dealers who evade a
distribution conviction because of some technicality, said the
law's sponsor, state Sen. Ivan Matheson.
   The law stipulates that if stamps are not attached permanently
to drug packages, a dealer could be required to pay the full cost
of the tax plus a fine of not more than $10,000.
   The stamps cost $3.50 for each gram, or portion of a gram, of
marijuana; $200 for each gram of a controlled substance sold by
weight; and $2,000 for each 50 ``dosage units,'' such as pills, of
a controlled substance not sold by weight.
   ``I cannot see a major drug dealer going in there to buy a
stamp,'' said attorney Gilbert D. Athay, who has defended a number
of alleged drug dealers.
   But that doesn't mean there won't be a market for the stamps.
   ``Stamp collectors will buy them. They'll probably be the only
people in town who will own them,'' Athay said.
   Anyone can buy the stamps. Purchasers do not have to identify
themselves, Shaw said, but must pay with cash or a cashier's check.
   The Tax Commission ordered 4,000 stamps from the state printing
office.
   All three stamps are plain. The marijuana stamp doesn't have a
picture of a leaf, just the title ``Marijuana'' at the top, and
several lines printed over the state seal where commission
employees can fill in the quantity and their initials.

   The Rev. Brice Riordan sensed a bargain in
the air one day recently while he prepared to celebrate Mass.
   ``Dear friends, it's encouraging to see such a great number of
you,'' Riordan said, looking out over his congregation. ``There
must be a sale at Stern's or something.''
   The 18-yea-old Carmelite chapel in the Bergen Mall is one of the
few in the country to be located in a shopping center. It is billed
as The Chapel on the Mall, devoted to St. Therese.
   The Rev. Ferdinand Schaefer, the chapel's pastor, said the idea
for a place to worship amid the materialism of a mall comes from
the age-old directive to ``get Christ in the marketplace.''
   ``You have to go where the people are, and the people are in the
malls,'' Schaefer said.
   The chapel is run by four priests of the Carmelite Order of the
Roman Catholic Church, which helped set up the first known mall
chapel more than 25 years ago in Peabody, Mass.
   The reason the Bergen Mall was chosen for a chapel site was a
link to the Peabody chapel _ Allied Stores, which in 1970 owned
both shopping malls, Schaefer said.
   Attendance was poor in the early years but it has gained
steadily, and today, especially during Lent and on Saturdays, it is
standing room only in the 150-seat chapel, Schaefer said.
   Year round, the chapel attracts about 200 people a day for three
Masses daily on weekdays and four on Saturday, he said. The chapel
doesn't offer Sunday Masses, because the mall is closed.
   Schaefer and steady chapelgoers credit the solid turnout to
convenience and the strong sermons of the four Carmelite priests.
   ``We just love these priests,'' said Kathleen Tappen of Maywood.
   Mrs. Tappen and her husband, Frank, have been chapel worshipers
for eight years.
   ``It's like a family,'' added Marge Wohlrab of Rochelle Park, a
10-year chapel-goer. ``Each (priest) gives a different perspective.
We always get another reason for carrying on.''
   The priests, ranging in age from 66 to 71 years old, have drawn
their wisdom from experience, said Schaefer.
   ``These guys have 40 to 45 years of priesthood behind them,''
Schaefer said. ``They have sort of mellowed. They are not out to do
anything except minister the sacraments and be kind to people. That
makes a difference.''
   The chapel is a no-frills religious experience. There are no
baptisms, funerals or weddings. Priests hear confessions, celebrate
daily mass and provide counseling when needed.
   Schaefer believes its success will continue as long as there are
shoppers.
   ``You see an awful lot of people going by and stopping and
looking and they are amazed,'' Schaefer said. ``Then, what do you
know, another day or two and they will be in.''

   The Stanford University faculty has
voted to replace a Western culture requirement, branded racist by
black students, with one that includes the study of women and
minorities.
   ``We're fighting against the white male estabishment that's been
here for years,'' said David Brown, a member of Students United for
Democratic Education.
   ``The change is a substantial improvement,'' university
President Donald Kennedy said when the Faculty Senate voted 39-4
for the change Thursday.
   ``We feel philosophically that the vote in favor of this was a
vote in favor of moving forward and progression,'' Black Student
Union Chairman Bill King said. ``They voted for moving toward
ethnic studies, not teaching freshmen lies.''
   U.S. Secretary of Education William Bennett charged earlier this
year that Stanford was bowing to ``curriculum by intimidation,''
and that higher education in general was losing credibility because
courses on the classics are being displaced. He is scheduled to
speak at Stanford on April 18.
   Beginning next fall, freshmen will take classes on ``Cultures,
Ideas and Values,'' replacing the Western culture program, dubbed
racist two years ago by the Black Student Union.
   Students will still be required to study the likes of Homer,
Plato and Shakespeare but they also will be exposed to works from
at least one non-European culture each quarter.
   According to a draft of the new course, its objective is to
``provide students with the common intellectual experience of
broadening their understanding of ideas and values drawn from
different strands of our own culture, and to increase their
understanding of cultural diversity and the process of cultural
interaction.''

   American corporations that owe taxes to Panama
will be allowed the U.S. foreign tax credit if payments are made to
the government of ousted President Eric Arturo Delvalle, the
Internal Revenue Service said Friday.
   The announcement was aimed at discouraging U.S. businesses from
sending tax payments to the Panamanian government controlled by
military strongman Manuel Antonio Noriega, which Washington does
not recognize.
   Some large U.S.-based multinational firms recently made
quarterly tax payments just in time to give that government a
desperately needed infusion of cash.
   The foreign tax credit is designed to prevent two national
governments from taxing the same dollar of income. In general, the
United States will not tax income that an American corporation
earns in and pays taxes on to a foreign country.
   The IRS announcement is the latest move in the U.S. effort to
squeeze Noriega, who has been indicted in the United States on
drug-trafficking charges.
   Delvalle, who is in hiding, has directed that all tax payments
due his country be paid through the Panamanian Embassy in
Washington into a special account at the Federal Reserve Bank of
New York.
   ``This notice confirms that income taxes due to the government
of Panama which are paid into such account will be considered paid
to the government of Panama, and will therefore be creditable
foreign taxes if all other requirements'' of the law are met, an
IRS statement said.
   The White House, in declaring Thursday that such an announcement
would be forthcoming, cautioned that U.S. businesses might expect
some sanctions if they continue turning over money to Noriega.
   A spokesman for Eastern Airlines said the company had recently
paid the Noriega government $178,000 in monthly rentals and landing
fees.
   Texaco, Inc., routinely paid income, sales and excise taxes for
March, said spokesman Peter Maneri, and sees no conflict with the
position of the U.S. government.
   ``We do not become involved in any political activity in a host
nation; we're just doing business down there,'' Maneri said.

   President Reagan today signed a $48 million
aid package for Nicaragua's Contras, but it probably will be at
least two weeks before the rebels begin receiving supplies under
the new legislation.
   The Senate on Thursday gave lopsided approval to the bill,
sending it to the president on a vote of 87-7. The House had
approved the measure 345-70 a day earlier.
   Reagan signed the bill with no fanfare in his residence before
departing for a flight to California and a 10-day vacation. The
signing was announced in a one-sentence White House statement,
which was accompanied by a brief executive order delegating
responsibilities to various agencies to carry out provisions of the
law.
   ``There certainly is an urgent need among the resistance for
medical supplies, food, clothing, the basic commodities of life,''
White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said. ``This bill is very
welcome in that regard and we support it.''
   Fitzwater said the president ``just indicated that it's urgently
needed ... and that he hopes the cease-fire talks on April 5 are
productive in getting the Sandinistas to bring about democratic
reforms.''
   The Contras have been shut off from U.S. aid since Feb. 29.
   The State Department official, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said he ``would be very surprised if any aid is
delivered within the next two weeks'' because of the time required
by the bureaucracy to gear up for a new delivery effort.
   But the official said even with the delay, delivery will begin
more quickly than normal because some of the responsibility for
moving supplies will be given to the department's Office of Foreign
Disaster Assistance, which has experience with such programs.
   The aid aims at sustaining the rebels as a fighting force while
they wait in cease-fire zones for their political leaders and the
Sandinista government to work out a long-term settlement to their
nearly seven-year civil war.
   Aid to the rebels under the bill would total $17.7 over the next
six months, including $1.5 million for communications gear if such
equipment is deemed to be in accord with a March 23 cease-fire
accord between the two sides.
   Another $17.7 million would be spent on a new program of medical
and rehabilitation help for war-injured children on both sides of
the conflict. The bill offers $10 million to a verification
commission that will monitor compliance with the cease-fire, and
$2.5 million to pay the State Department's Agency for International
Development to administer the aid.
   The overwhelming and relatively quiet approval of the bill in
both houses of Congress was an abrupt change in the tenor of a U.S.
debate that began with the civil war seven years ago. Votes on
Nicaragua policy have typically been decided by thin margins and
with sharp and partisan argument.
   Congress had rejected similar aid packages twice earlier this
year, but the March 23 truce reached in Sapoa, Nicaragua, changed
the political climate in Congress.
   ``One can always hope we may have learned this partisanship is
unhealthy,'' said Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., after Thursday's vote.
   ``But let's have no illusions,'' he added. ``Future events (in
Central America) will dictate whether there's maintenance of this
bipartisanship.''
   Sen. Christopher Dodd, D-Conn., noted that the aid bill fell
short of the desires of Contra supporters, who would have preferred
to send weapons to the rebels, and also bothered rebel opponents
who oppose sending any aid.
   ``This package strikes a balance, and is for the sole purpose of
supporting that agreement in Sapoa,'' Dodd said during a harmonious
floor debate on the measure. ``If not for that agreement, we
wouldn't be doing this today.''
   A Contra proponent, Sen. David Boren, D-Okla., said the action
would ``send a strong signal that the Contras are not being
abandoned.''
   But Boren also said the failure of Congress to agree on military
support for the rebels would prove to be ``one of the gravest
mistakes in American foreign policy ever made.''
   The seven senators who voted against the aid package were Sens.
Brock Adams, D-Wash.; Alan Cranston, D-Calif.; Mark Hatfield,
R-Ore.; Spark Matsunaga, D-Hawaii; John Melcher, D-Mont.; William
Proxmire, D-Wis.; and Robert Stafford, R-Vt.
   Not voting were Sens. Joseph Biden, D-Del.; Albert Gore,
D-Tenn.; Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass.; John Kerry, D-Mass.; Warren
Rudman, R-N.H. and Paul Simon, D-Ill.

   Law enforcement agencies in Florida
seized more than $4.5 million in property and cash from suspected
criminals in the last three months of 1987, according to a state
report.
   State law lets police seize property when authorities believe it
was used in a felony. The law has sparked criticism because some
agencies confiscate property without making an arrest.
   While they must return the property to innocent owners,
authorities often charge fees to do so. Legislation is expected
this session to prohibit the fees.
   Metro-Dade police seized $1.04 million in cash and $34,000 in
property _ mainly older cars _ and earned $55,000 in interest.
   ``This is home base on the U.S. side to the major traffickers
... people who will have bags and boxes of money,'' said George
Aylesworth, commander of the Metro-Dade legal unit. ``We just bump
into them most often.''

   A surgeon who died of AIDS may have contracted the
disease while performing surgery in Africa and didn't know he had
been infected until six days before his death, his superior said
Friday.
   The doctor, David Collings, performed 338 operations in Britain
after returning last year from five years in his native Zimbabwe.
Health officials are trying to find the patients to offer them
counseling and, if necessary, a free blood test. Officials are
warning them not to panic.
   Collings, 30, thought he had a bad dose of flu when he became
ill on March 16, but his condition dramatically worsened. A blood
test on March 21 showed he had AIDS, and he died six days later at
Royal Devon and Exeter Hospital in Exeter.
   ``He just shrugged his shoulders and said, `That is one of the
risks of doing surgery in Africa,''' said his superior, consultant
surgeon Bruce Campbell.
   Collings, who was trained in Edinburgh, Scotland, was married
and had an 18-month-old child. He worked in Mpilo and Marondera,
Zimbabwe, for five years before returning to Britain last year, the
Exeter Health Authority said.
   He worked at the Alexandra Hospital at Redditch for a few months

such as appendicitis, hernias or varicose veins.

them reassurance, not because they believe there is any real risk
of infection.

   Construction spending fell for a third
consecutive month in February, a 0.3 percent decline which
reflected weakness in the housing sector, the government reported
Friday.
   The Commerce Department said that construction spending declined
to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $391.5 billion in February
following a 2.8 percent drop in January. In addition, the
department revised the December figure to show a small decline of
$100 million instead of a 0.4 percent increase.
   The February decline pushed construction spending 2.5 percent
below where it was a year earlier. Analysts are forecasting further
cutbacks in 1988 because of high vacancy rates in apartments and
office buildings.
   Michael Sumichrast, an economist and editor of a construction
newsletter, said that he was predicting a 7 percent decline in
private non-residential construction this year following a drop of
8.1 percent in 1987.
   ``Much of the strength in the past few years was in
over-building driven by tax breaks rather than building for the
existing market,'' he said. ``As a result, we don't have much
strength anywhere.''
   Residential construction fell by 1.1 percent in February to an
annual rate of $188.1 billion. This included declines of 1 percent
in construction of single-family homes and a drop of 4.3 percent in
construction of multi-family units.
   Non-residential construction posted a 1.2 percent increase to an
annual rate of $92 billion. The biggest source of strength came
from an 18.8 percent surge in hospital construction which offset
drops in office, hotel and shopping center construction.
   Sumichrast said that construction of hospitals and private
schools would show increases this year although both sectors
represent only a small fraction of the total industry.
   Public construction edged up 0.4 percent in February to an
annual rate of $74.7 billion with the biggest category, highway
building, posting a 0.4 percent increase.

   An AP correspondent entered Ramallah hours
before the Israeli army set up roadblocks Tuesday and left Friday
morning, after the curfew was lifted. Here is his report:

<DATELINE>RAMALLAH, Occupied West Bank (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   ``Please! Please! A kilo of
bread!'' shouted women outside a bakery off Ramallah's main square.
   The flustered bakery owner held out empty hands. ``That's all! I
can't sell anymore!'' the stocky man shouted back, locking his shop
door to obey the demands of gun-toting Israeli soldiers who had
confiscated his identity papers.
   The shop shutters that crashed shut at gunpoint throughout
Ramallah on Tuesday began three days of what residents called a
siege by Israeli troops determined to crush a 4-month-old Arab
uprising.
   But Palestinians are hoarding food and launching a grassroots
campaign to endure tougher measures some say they expect to come.
   Israeli troops closed off the occupied territories for three
days this week, hoping to prevent massive demonstrations on
Wednesday, a Palestinian commemoration of efforts to fight Israeli
land confiscations. The military ordered all 650,000 Arabs in the
Gaza Strip to stay in their homes for three days, and severed
telephone links.
   On the West Bank, Israel blocked the 850,000 Arabs from leaving
their towns.
   Journalists were forbidden to enter or travel without military
escorts. An Associated Press reporter entered Ramallah, eight miles
north of Jerusalem, hours before the army set up roadblocks, and he
left Friday morning, after the curfew was lifted.
   On the first day, troops in riot gear moved through the hilly
streets of Ramallah and neighboring El Bireh, forcing shops to
close. It was punishment for the merchants' nearly universal
acceptance of a Palestine Liberation Organization demand they open
in mornings and close in afternoons.
   The shutdowns left the twin cities, home to about 55,000
Palestinians, still. Men unable to reach jobs hoed their gardens.
Women chatted while shelling almonds in front of their limestone
houses.
   Shrieking children scampered around vacant lots kicking soccer
balls or hurling rocks at one another. It was a game they called
``Jews and Arabs.''
   ``If I see the soldiers, I run,'' said a pushcart vender named
Bassam, who glanced nervously up a street near Ramallah's main
business district while cutting off bananas for customers.
   The conflicting demands of Israel and underground Arab leaders
have imposed similar, longer closures in Bethlehem, Nablus, Jericho
and Jenin.
   Abded Hamouri, co-owner of a fleet of commuter buses, said the
Israelis ``are talking to the people who do not have the solution
in their hands. The solution is not in the hands of the people who
own shops.''
   ``I'm not afraid of the military governor. I'm afraid of the guy
I don't know who he is or what he is going to do,'' he said,
referring to masked young men who tell shopowners when to open or
close.
   Israel has tried to mop up those youths since December by
arresting more than 4,000 Arabs, by government count. Palestinian
lawyers insist the toll is much higher.
   Yet protests continue, and walls throughout the town carry
spray-painted slogans: ``Long live the uprising!'' ``Up With the
PLO!''
   Arabs said Jewish settlers were responsible for a grim reply
stenciled on a few walls: a hand holding a club over a broken bone,
reference to Israel's use of beatings to quell disturbances.
   The three-day closure was Israel's broadest effort yet to stifle
protests against military occupation. But most Palestinians
interviewed in Ramallah's streets said it was little worse than
existing restrictions.
   ``To the boys here, it doesn't matter,'' said a young man named
Suleiman, trying to evade the soldiers who had imposed a curfew on
the crowded El Amiri refugee camp. He said most young men sleep
outside the camp to escape the army's midnight raids.
   Israel earlier severed international telephone connections to
the West Bank and Gaza, blocked deliveries of gasoline and fuel oil
to Arab dealers, and imposed a tight limit on the West Bank's
crucial foreign currency imports.
   It now demands proof of tax payment to obtain a driver's license
or exit visa.
   Despite the scramble for bread, Arabs throughout the area
insisted they were ready for tougher Israeli pressure.
   Reporters saw huge bags of flour and stacks of powdered milk
cans in two houses. Many people said they had stockpiled essentials.
   ``We are ready for anything,'' said Ramallah Chamber of Commerce
President Khader Kasis. ``We can exist just on bread and zatar,''
he added, referring to a popular green spice.
   An El Bireh shopowner who spoke on condition he not be
identified said his neighborhood this week formed a self-reliance
committee.
   He pointed out vacant land the group planned to fill with crops,
and said it had arranged for merchants to sell goods when stores
are closed.
   ``I think that's happening a lot, especially for security and
self-sufficiency,'' said attorney Raja Shehadeh, a human rights
activist. ``People are experiencing a siege.''

   The United States ambassador to Saudi Arabia,
Hume Horan, is leaving his post after only six months because of a
personality conflict with King Fahd, a State Department official
said today.
   Horan is expected to be replaced by career diplomat Walter
Cutler, a former ambassador to Saudi Arabia who was succeeded by
Horan last September, the official said.
   The official, who asked not to be identified, denied a published
report that Horan was being withdrawn at Saudi request and that his
recall was related to U.S. complaints over the Saudi purchase of
Chinese missiles.
   State Department deputy spokeswoman Phyllis Oakley confirmed
that Horan was being reassigned but she gave no further details.
   Meanwhile, a group of 32 senators urged the administration in a
letter to pressure the Saudis to withdraw the missiles.
   The letter from the senators says the administration should
reconsider a $450 million support package of training and
maintenance for AWACS radar surveillance planes. The administration
has not yet asked officially for congressional approval of the
package.
   ``We strongly believe that our current policy toward arms sales
to Saudi Arabia must be re-examined,'' the letter said.
   The Saudi deployment of the CSS-2 intermediate-range missiles
came to light two weeks ago in news reports and was confirmed by
the State Department, which said the rockets are not yet
operational.
   Shultz will be meeting with Saudi leaders in Riyadh next week
during his shuttle mission to the Mideast. He will be lobbying for
Israeli-Arab peace talks, but also is expected to bring up the
Chinese missiles.
   Shultz already expressed U.S. concern about the sale of the
missiles, which have a range of 1,850 miles, when he met in
Washington earlier this month with Chinese Foreign Minister Wu
Xueqian.
   Saudi Arabia, an ally of Iraq, says it needed the missiles to
protect itself in case of a further escalation in the Iran-Iraq
war, especially in view of Iranian threats.
   But U.S. officials say the Saudis bought the missiles in
frustration over repeated attempts by Congress to block American
arms sales.
   The kingdom began negotiating the deal with the Chinese in 1985,
after Congress blocked the sale of 48 F-15 jet fighters to Saudi
Arabia. Congress late last year agreed to sell the Saudis 24 F-15s
in order to maintain Saudi air strength at its current levels.
   The CSS-2 rockets also have a nuclear capability, but both China
and Saudi Arabia have assured the United States they do not intend
to arm the rockets with nuclear warheads.
   In another letter, Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., called for a
hearing by the Senate Foreign Relations Committee to discuss the
implications of the new Saudi missiles and the reported failure by
U.S. intelligence to detect the purchase from China for some two
years.
   ``We are also deeply concerned that the Saudis hid the fact that
they possess these weapons,'' the letter said.

<HEAD>Consumer Group Supports Plan To Tag Pork To Trace Chemical
Residues</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A national consumer group has lent support to
an Agriculture Department plan for requiring the identification of
hogs so that illegally high traces of drugs in their meat can be
traced back to the farm.
   Ellen Haas, executive director of Public Voice for Food and
Health Policy, said in comments filed with USDA this week that the
proposal is in the best interests of consumers.
   ``Improved methods to control and monitor dangerous chemical
residues in the swine supply are sorely needed, and this measure
will help meet this demand,'' she said.
   The proposal was announced a month ago as part of a program to
strengthen USDA's inspection and monitoring of pork for illegally
high traces of drugs, particularly sulfamethazine used to treat or
prevent swine disease. The drug also has been used as a feed
additive for many years in subtherapeutic doses to boost weight
gains.
   A stricter monitoring program already has been put into effect,
and the identification proposal is said by USDA officials to be on
a fast track for approval.
   The proposed rule would require all swine in interstate commerce
to be individually identified by a tag or other approved means, and
producers would have to maintain appropriate identification records
on each animal for two years.
   Ms. Haas cited USDA records for 1987 showing that levels of
sulfonamides as a group _ which include sulfamethazine _ exceeded
Food and Drug Administration maximum levels in 4 percent of the
total samples.
   ``But in certain states, the problem was dramatically worse: in
North Carolina, the violation rate was 10.2 percent; in Alabama, 8
percent; and in Georgia, 7.8 percent,'' she said.
   According to USDA figures cited by Ms. Haas, violative
percentage rates for sulfonamide residues in pork tested in 1987,
included these states of origin:

   Hume Horan, the U.S. ambassador to Saudi
Arabia, is being reassigned after only six months on the job
because of personality differences with King Fahd, a State
Department official said Friday.
   Horan is expected to be succeeded by the man he replaced last
September, career diplomat Walter Cutler, the official said.
   Horan, who is fluent in Arabic, has been in Washington on
consultations and will return to Saudi Arabia shortly for a brief
stay to tend to personal matters, according to the official,
insisting on anonymity.
   State Department spokeswoman Phyllis Oakley confirmed that Horan
is being reassigned but provided no further details except to say
that he is being considered for a new post.
   Secretary of State George P. Shultz will stop in Saudi Arabia
next week as part of his effort to win acceptance for his Middle
East peace proposal.
   Both Saudi and American officials denied a Washington Post
report that the Saudi government had asked that Horan be replaced.
A U.S. official also denied that Horan's reassignment was related
to a U.S.-Saudi dispute over that country's acquisition of missiles
from China.
   Horan had a ``personality conflict'' with King Fahd, the
official said. ``The decision to recall him was made here, not in
Saudi Arabia. They did not specifically ask us to withdraw him,''
he said.
   This is the second abrupt departure by an American ambassador to
Saudi Arabia during the Reagan administration.
   Former ambassador Robert G. Neumann was forced out in 1981 by
Secretary of State Alexander M. Haig after only two months on the
job.
   Cutler, since leaving Riyadh last year, has served as
diplomat-in-residence at Georgetown University here.
   Saudi Arabia's purchase of Chinese missiles, which have a range
of more than 1,000 miles, has been a contentious issue in
U.S.-Saudi relations.
   Israel is within easy reach of the missiles, which are capable
of carrying nuclear warheads. The Saudis have said the missiles
won't be fitted with such warheads.
   A group of 32 senators has written a letter to Shultz asking
that the United States reconsider further arms sales to Saudi
Arabia until the missiles are withdrawn. The administration has
been expected notify Congress shortly that it intends to sell $450
million worth of support equipment for surveillance aircraft the
Saudis acquired recently.

   Israel reopened the occupied territories Friday
at the start of a holy weekend for Christians and Jews, and
soldiers killed two Arabs and wounded 13 others hurling firebombs
after Moslem prayers in the West Bank, the army said.
   A Palestinian emerged from a mosque and stabbed a Jerusalem
policeman in the stomach as he stood guard near the route where
Good Friday pilgrims traced the steps of Christ as he carried his
cross.
   Police and soldiers were out in force to guard Christians as
they remembered Christ's death and Jews celebrated the start of the
week-long Passover festival.
   Hundreds of pilgrims carried wooden crosses along the Via
Dolorosa _ the route Jesus walked to his crucifixion _ in the
walled Old City, but the crowd was smaller than usual. The Greek
Orthodox church canceled three processions planned before its
observance of Easter on April 10.
   An Israeli police lieutenant was stabbed in the stomach about 20
yards from the Good Friday procession, apparently by a worshiper
emerging from prayers at the sacred Al Aqsa Mosque. The policeman
was reported in fair condition, and a Palestinian was arrested.
   The government lifted an order under which the occupied lands
were sealed off for three days, and it ended a round-the-clock
curfew in Gaza.
   In addition to the two deaths reported Friday, a third
Palestinian died overnight of a gunshot wound to the head inflicted
Wednesday. The Arab death toll stands at 127 since violence began
Dec. 8 in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip, according to U.N.
figures, and an Israeli soldier also has been killed.
   Army and Arab reports differed on what happened in the
confrontation between soldiers and Palestinians at Idna, a village
seven miles west of Hebron in the West Bank.
   Officials at Hebron's Alia Hospital and Arab journalists said
soldiers stormed the village mosque to subdue Palestinians hurling
rocks and bottles after prayers.
   They said Jamal Tamizi, 20, died after being hit in the head
with a tear gas canister and five bullets struck Ishak Nimr
Salameh, 18, in the chest and head. The reports said 25 people were
wounded.
   According to the army, soldiers opened fire when they were
surrounded by dozens of Arab rioters, some flinging bottles filled
with flaming gasoline.
   Last week, Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin authorized troops to
fire on Arabs who throw firebombs.
   In Jerusalem, officials at Mukassad Hospital said an Arab youth
from the Old City's Moslem quarter was wounded in the leg.
   Hundreds of Arabs have been wounded since riots began among the
1.5 million Palestinians of the West Bank and Gaza, which Israel
has occupied since capturing them from Jordan and Egypt in the 1967
Middle East war.
   Israel radio said 40 soldiers have been injured, including one
who is paralyzed and another in a coma.
   About 35 women, many of them elderly, emerged from the Nasr
mosque in the West Bank town of El Bireh on Friday shaking their
fists and chanting: ``By our blood and spirit we will redeem
Palestine!'' Soldiers fired tear gas to disperse them.
   In Ramallah, stores and the central vegetable market opened for
the first time since the territories were shut down Monday night.
During the three days, soldiers forced shopkeepers to close during
the only hours PLO leaflets said they could open.
   Abed Hamouri said Israeli economic measures, intended to turn
middle-class Palestinians against the rebellion, had no impact on
underground activists. He is co-owner of 24 commuter buses.
   ``The solution is not in the hands of the people who own
shops,'' Hamouri said. ``I'm not afraid of the military governor.
I'm afraid of the underground leaders I don't know.''
   His reference was to masked men who order shopowners when to
open or close and threaten those who do not comply.
   Shmuel Goren, government adviser on the occupied territories,
contended that Israel's methods were working.
   ``We have to divide the population,'' he said on Israel radio.
``We see a great number of people who certainly feel tired and want
very much to stop these things.''
   In the Gaza Strip, the army reimposed 24-hour curfews on the
Nusseirat and Beach refugee camps and on the villages Abassan, Beit
Hanoun and Bani Suheila. A five-hour nightly curfew was restored in
the rest of the 6-mile-long coastal strip.
   Army spokesmen said 300 Palestinians were arrested while Gaza
was closed.

   Ten thousand Iranians shook their fists
while chanting of death to Iraq and the ``Great Satan'' America at
Friday prayers, glancing nervously skyward now and then for the
vapor trails of incoming missiles.
   A Western diplomat described the weekly ritual at Tehran
University, where unarmed students defied the imperial army when
the late Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi was deposed in February 1979,
as ``the beating heart of the Islamic revolution.''
   Iraq said it would stop firing missiles into Tehran and other
Iranian cities during a three-day visit to Baghdad of the Turkish
prime minister, Turgut Ozal, beginning at midnight Thursday.
   Iran said it launched seven rockets Friday into Kirkuk, the oil
center in northern Iraq, and the southern port of Basra, but did
not report firing any at the Iraqi capital. The last report of a
missile explosion in Baghdad was March 27.
   Turkey maintains good relations with both Iran and Iraq, which
have been at war since September 1980, and has tried to act as
mediator.
   Despite the apparent lull in the month-long ``war of the
cities,'' in which hundreds of civilians have been killed on both
sides, no one in Tehran was taking anything for granted on this
Moslem sabbath.
   Two long-range Iraqi missiles landed in the capital during
Friday prayers in mid-March.
   ``We saw the vapor trails, but nobody at the prayers moved,''
said a translator from the Islamic Guidance Ministry who
accompanied visiting Western correspondents to the university.
``Everyone stayed seated when the missiles exploded some distance
away.''
   Weekly prayers on the campus and elsewhere in Iran, to Western
eyes a cross between a revival meeting and political rally, are the
main platforms for mobilizing mass opinion and stoking fervor for
the war.
   Shiite Moslem fundamentalists beat their chests with fists in
unison, chant slogans and listen to leaders exhort them to victory,
condemn the ``Great Satan'' America and preach Ayatollah Ruhollah
Khomeini's revolution.
   Hashemi Rafsanjani, the parliament speaker, is a regular prayer
leader at the university but this week it was President Ali
Khamenei.
   He urged Iranians to vote in parliamentary elections April 8
``even if there are missiles and bombs falling,'' echoing remarks
the revolutionary partriarch had made the day before.
   Khamenei praised the current thrust by Revolutionary Guards into
northeastern Iraq and said Western media had not given enough
coverage to alleged chemical warfare in the region.
   Iran claims the Iraqis dropped chemical bombs March 16-17 on
three Kurdish towns in Iraq that had been captured by Iranian
troops, killing 5,000 civilians and wounding an equal number.
   At prayers, the pattern is the same each week: calls for
sacrifice interrupted by such chants from the crowd of ``War, war,
until victory!'' and ``Death to America!''
   ``Death to Russia!'' has joined the lexicon since missiles began
demolishing homes, schools and hospitals Feb. 29. Iraq is believed
to be using Soviet-designed Scud-B missiles fitted with boosters so
they can reach Tehran, which is nearly 300 miles from the border.
   Among the estimated 10,000 people at the campus prayer meeting
were about 60 Iraqi prisoners of war Iranian officials said had
volunteered to fight on Iran's side.
   They squatted in an enclosure in front of the covered podium,
which bore photographs of Khomeini and other religious leaders. All
wore white T-shirts emblazoned with the image of Imam Bakr Sadr, a
Shiite cleric executed by Iraq as a subversive in 1980.
   The imam was a cousin of Mohammad Bakr al-Hakim, leader of the
Supreme Islamic Revolutionary Council of Iraq, a group of dissident
Iraqi factions supported by Iran.
   Another enclosure held men wounded in the war _ without limbs,
in wheelchairs _ not far from ranks of teen-aged volunteers for the
front wearing red headbands with Islamic slogans.
   Security was tight and foreign correspondents were frisked twice
before being allowed onto the campus from the surrounding streets,
where thousands more people had gathered to hear the sermons
through loudspeakers.
   A bomb exploded on the campus two weeks ago, but no casualty
report was given.
   Iranian women, shrouded in the black head-to-toe robes called
chadors, were not allowed onto the campus because strict Islamic
law requires them to be segregated. They sat in an enclosure some
distance away.
   Outside the campus, cartoon-like posters explained what to do in
case of an Iraqi poison gas attack.
   Beside the entrance was a transparent plastic ``war fund'' box
into which worshipers stuffed banknotes. Officials said one slipped
in a check for 400,000 rials, about $5,600.

   Sikh gunmen stormed into huts and houses
across Punjab state on Friday and killed 37 people, including seven
children, in the bloodiest one-day murder spree this year, police
and witnesses said.
   Police in Amritsar imposed a night curfew in parts of the
region. In New Delhi, Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi met government
officials and ordered stringent steps to check Sikh violence,
United News of India reported.
   Gandhi also ordered new police alerts in five states that adjoin
Punjab.
   In Amritsar, two Hindu organizations called for a daylong strike
in the district on Saturday to protest the killings, UNI said. Most
of the victims were Hindus.
   The attacks began Thursday night, hours after an umbrella
organization heading the Sikh separatist movement called for a halt
to the killings of moderate Sikhs.
   The worst attack occured at a hamlet near Pangota, 25 miles
north of Amritsar. Twelve gunmen raided the mud huts of a Hindu
laborer commune and murdered 18 people, said S.S. Virk, deputy
inspector general of the paramilitary Central Reserve Police Force.
   ``I heard the killers ordering us to get out of our huts, I hid
myself ... and moments later I heard sound of gunfire and
screams,'' said Tara Singh, 45.
   Fifteen people were lined up and shot, and a 23-year-old
pregnant woman, a 6-month-old baby girl and an 80-year-old woman
were shot and killed in their hut when the killers saw they could
not walk, Virk said.
   He said all the victims were related.
   At Shaeed village, six miles west of Pangota, another group of
militants shot and killed six people, Virk said. The victims, all
Hindus, included a 2-year-old boy. The assailants broke into the
homes and shot the victims in their beds.
   The killers murdered a Sikh couple in nearby Verowal town after
leaving Shaeed, the officer said.
   UNI said suspected Sikh radicals shot and killed two people in
Gurdaspur district Friday.
   An officer at the state police control in Chandigarh said
elsewhere in Punjab, nine other people were killed by suspected
Sikhs late Thursday and early Friday.
   An underground organization formed to achieve an independent
Sikh nation called on militant groups to cease random killings of
moderate Sikhs.
   At least 330 of the 618 people killed this year in Sikh attacks
have been moderates who do not support the militants' demand for an
independent homeland in Sikh-dominated Punjab.
   Sikhs are a religous minority in India, comprising only 2
percent of the total population, and claim they are discriminated
against by Hindus. Militants hae been fighting for a Sikh state
since 1983.
   The Council of Khalistan issued the statement from Amritsar's
Golden Temple, the holiest Sikh shrine and the center of militant
activity. Khalistan is the name the militants give to their
envisioned homeland.
   The attacks brought the number of people killed in random
attacks this week to more than 80. Most of the killings have been
near Amritsar.
   The spurt in violence is blamed on differences within militant
groups and an attempt to sabotage government moves to reach an
accord with the militants.
   The government last month released 12 Sikh leaders jailed for
sedition and dissolved the Punjab state assembly in what was seen
as an attempt to enroll the militants in politics.
   But sources in the Golden Temple, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, said some militants opposed the plan since it would not
give the Sikhs total autonomy.
   Punjab Gov. S.S. Ray said in a recent interview, ``I have seen
that whenever a good thing is proposed to be done about Punjab ...
anti-national terrorists indulge in an orgy of violence thereby
trying to prevent anything from being done.''

   After 24 years as the disc jockey,
technician and owner of WVCA-FM, Simon Geller has sold his one-man
radio station for $1 million, saying that at age 68 he's ready for
a new life.
   When in a few months he hangs up the earphones for the last time
in his two-room apartment-studio, Geller plans to walk away from
this sleepy fishing community 25 miles north of Boston. Then he'll
finally pop the question to his sweetheart of 32 years.
   ``I've had 46 years in this miserable business and it's time to
get out,'' he said, when asked about his decision.
   His 3,000-watt classical music radio station has been on the air
every day, except when he shut down to run errands.
   It's an institution built on the single-minded dedication of a
man who won an 11-year battle against the Federal Communications
Commission and a powerful business group bent on takeover.
   It's also a focal point of 90,000 loyal listeners in a 35-mile
radius extending into Boston and New Hampshire, who have
contributed more than 90 percent of the money Geller needed since
WVCA-FM went on the air in 1964 as the Voice of Cape Ann.
   It took a bit of probing before Geller, a diabetic with
high-blood pressure, talked about his decision to sell.
   An insulin reaction in 1986 caused him to fall while walking
from one room to another in his apartment. He remained conscious,
but it took friends five hours to find and help him, while a
long-playing tape was unwinding on air.
   ``I'm 68 years old, and I don't know how much longer I'll live,
so I want to get things straightened out in case I should drop dead
next week,'' he said. ``The life expectancy is only 70 in this
country.''
   Also taking its toll is mental fatigue from his battle for
license renewal.
   The challenge was mounted in 1964 by Grandbanke Corp., a group
of New England station owners that wanted to take over his
frequency for a folk rock station.
   While only a few local businesses advertise on WVCA-FM, its
listening area is considered lucrative. Grandbanke argued that the
station's format violated FCC requirements that community interest,
news and public affairs be a part of programming.
   An FCC decision against Geller was reconsidered in 1984 on
orders of a federal appeals court, which pointed out that the
station had the support of Gloucester community leaders and
listeners. His license was renewed a year later.
   ``My license was safe until 1991, but I was afraid someone would
challenge me in 1991 and I would be in the same mess I was with
Grandbanke,'' Geller said.
   Geller's two cluttered rooms above a coin laundry are crowded
with a mixture of antiquated and new equipment, with a maze of
extension cords competing for space with unopened mail and
cardboard boxes. Order is imposed by neat rows of records and tapes
on shelves lining the walls.
   While he said new owner Doug Tanger, a Boston businessman, will
likely expand operations, Geller declined to discuss details of the
sale beyond disclosing that an application was filed with the FCC
this week.
   He said it will probably take three months for the FCC to
approve Tanger's application, allowing him to take over and
allowing Geller to walk out the door.
   Tanger owns stations WCLZ-AM and -FM in Portland, Maine, and
with his family has WQRS-FM in Detroit.
   Geller said a promise that the station will remain classical
permits him to look forward to the future with Carol Hill.
   He has publicly talked about proposing to his former bookkeeper
for years. But he remains coy about a date.
   ``I haven't discussed this with her and until I'm clear here I
cannot discuss it,'' he said. ``Let's wait until FCC approval.''

<HEAD>South Facing Fourth Serious Drought In Eight Years, Experts Say</HEAD>

<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Georgia, Alabama and South Carolina are facing
their fourth serious drought in eight years, experts said Friday.
   ``If we don't get a dramatic increase in rainfall, we'll be
looking at water restrictions this summer,'' said David Word, chief
of water resource management for the Georgia Department of Natural
Resources.
   Lake Lanier in north Georgia and Lakes Hartwell and Thurmond on
the Georgia-South Carolina border are at lower levels than they
were at this point in the drought years of 1981, 1986 and 1987,
officials told reporters Friday in Atlanta.
   Likely effects of the drought include timber loss, reduced water
quality, stress on fish and ``water restrictions, if this continues
through the summer,'' said Pat Davis, chief of the Technical
Engineering Branch for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers' Mobile
District.
   ``We're in the third (consecutive) year of greatly reduced
rainfall,'' Davis said. ``It's been persistently below normal
through the decade.''
   For the 1980s, much of the area is 12 percent below normal
rainfall _ the equivalent of an entire year without rain, he said.
Some parts of Georgia are 70 inches below normal for the decade.
   The area remains under a ``water shortage alert'' issued by the
corps last fall, and that could become a ``drought alert'' later
this month, officials said.
   Lake Lanier, which supplies water to metro Atlanta and is the
most visited lake in the Corps of Engineers system, stood Friday at
nine feet below its normal level.
   ``We have only about a 10 percent chance to fill the lake by
June 1,'' said Ed Burkett, chief of water management for the corps'
Mobile District. Corps officials in November reduced the amount of
water flowing from Lanier downstream into the Chattahoochee River,
in an attempt to conserve water in the lake.
   Despite a forecast for above-average rain for April to June,
Burkett said, the customary summer and fall drops in lake levels
would likely leave area lakes below normal levels.

<HEAD>US Cuts Duty-Free Imports From Third World</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United States announced Friday that
beginning July 1 it will eliminate duty-free imports on products
worth $1.1 billion in 1987, shipped here from 140 Third World
countries.
   A U.S. official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the
decision would add $50 million to $100 million a year to the
tariffs collected by the United States. It will also provide
additional business to some U.S. producers by discouraging imports.
   Total U.S. imports under this system of ``generalized special
preferences,'' the biggest of its kind in the world, reached a
record $16.3 billion last year. It is designed to help poor
countries improve their production in about 3,000 different
products.
   ``As developing countries become increasingly competitive, we
are removing tariff preferences... for those products where
duty-free treatment is no longer warranted,'' said U.S. Trade
Representative Clayton Yeutter.
   Another $114 million worth of goods, previously cut from the
list, was reinstated.
   And $40 million worth of new products was added, from $17
million worth of fireworks to $3,911 worth of pickled beans. Hong
Kong will be the biggest beneficiary, but only until mid-1988, when
it is due to lose its duty-free privilege entirely.
   None of the exporting countries was removed from the list in
this annual review.
   Yeutter said five countries whose labor and human rights
situations had been challenged by labor unions and others will
remain eligible because of ``improvements in their practices.''
They are Taiwan, South Korea, Indonesia, Thailand and Turkey.
   The Central African Republic is still being reviewed.
   The trade bill approved Thursday by conferees of the Senate and
House would increase pressure on Third World countries on labor
issues. It grants the president power to retaliate against exports
of countries where the government refuses to give workers
internationally recognized rights, such as the right to form unions.
   Supporters of the bill argue that denying such rights gives
those countries an unfair trade advantage because it enables them
to keep wages down.
   The Reagan administration opposed the provision but Rep. Donald
J. Pease D-Ohio, its chief sponsor, said in an interview today it
has not threatened a presidential veto on that ground.
   Pease said such provisions are intended not to deprive poor
countries of trade but to give them an incentive to change their
labor laws.
   ``It's already happening in country after country,'' he added.
   Yeutter's office gave Thailand until Dec. 15 to comply with U.S.
conditions for protecting patents and copyrights. He has been asked
by business groups here to deny duty-free privileges to Thailand on
this ground.

   A dog that had been adopted by a convalescent
hospital the day it was to have been destroyed was honored for
helping a seizure victim by barking to alert others.
   Tori, a 5-year-old Sheltie, on Thursday was awarded a silver
medal in a ceremony attended by actor Earl Holliman, a member of
Actors and Others for Animals, at the Astoria Convalescent Home in
Sylmar.
   Nancy Sue Merritt, 50, had been unhappy about the adoption and
threatened to move when the dog arrived in January. Her opinion
changed Feb. 7.
   Ms. Merritt suffered a seizure, fell and hit her head when no
other people were around.
   But Tori barked so loud ``you would have thought there was a
pack of dogs,'' said Lita Joy Parker, the director of activities.
   When she came to, ``I tried to wiggle around,'' Ms. Merritt
said, ``but Tori placed a paw on me and wouldn't let me up until
help arrived.''

   Investigators are trying to determine

helicopters within three days, a spokeswoman said Friday.
   Neither the instructor pilot, Marine Capt. Steven Andrews, nor
his student, Navy Ensign Scott Jackson, were hurt when their TH-57
helicopter crashed Thursday, said Airman Audry Anderson.
   Two days earlier, Marine Capt. Thomas Lindblad, an instructor,
was slightly injured and his student, Marine 2nd Lt. Bradley Eid,
was unhurt when another TH-57 went down.
   The helicopters crashed at two outlying practice fields, but
photos show each wound up on its left side and with its two-bladed
main rotor ripped from the aircraft.
   The helicopters were assigned to two squadrons in Whiting's
Training Air Wing 5.

<HEAD>Cultural Leader Deplores Cover-up in Library Fire</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARK J. PORUBCANSKY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A leading cultural figure accused Communist Party
officials of ``upside-down glasnost'' for trying to cover up the
truth about a fire that destroyed or damaged millions of literary
treasures at a Leningrad library.
   State Cultural Fund chairman Dmitri Likhachev said party
officials ignored the plight of Soviet literature and failed to
preserve rare books that their elders managed to protect even from
the siege of Leningrad during World War II.
   The Feb. 14-15 blaze struck the Library of the U.S.S.R. Academy
of Sciences in Leningrad and destroyed or damaged more than 3
million books and periodicals, Likhachev said in an interview with
the weekly Moscow News and in an article he wrote in the weekly
publication Book Review.
   He said the fire, which raged for 19 hours, was a national
disaster made worse by official attempts to conceal it and
``became, truly, a Chernobyl of our culture.''
   The historian, writer and cultural activist said 400,000 books
were destroyed by fire and 2.7 million books and periodicals
damaged by water and moisture. A quarter of the library's unique
newspaper fund was destroyed, and many of the lost issues were the
last in existence, he said.
   The library, located in a 1920s building on Leningrad's
Vasiliyevsky Island, contained about 12 million books, manuscripts
and periodicals. Its collection was started in 1714, about a decade
after Peter the Great founded the city.
   ``It pains me to recall how books were saved during the blockade
of Leningrad,'' said Likhachev, 81, referring to the World War II
occupation when citizens spirited away rare books and other art
treasures to protect them from the Nazis. ``Now, in these peaceful
and happy times, books are dying. Incredible.''
   Likhachev said the fire could have been prevented if party and
government officials had heeded warnings about the dilapidated
condition of the nation's most prestigious book collections.
   Warnings of impending disaster had been published in the
state-run press, and party officials responded with promises that
crumbling libraries and museums will be taken care of.
   ``There grew up splendid buildings of district party committees
and regional executive committees ... in which those who had signed
those official replies discussed the problems of leisure,
deliberated on the declining thirst for books and the crisis of
moral integrity,'' Likhachev said.
   ``This upside-down glasnost is worse than keeping silent, for it
creates the illusion that things are being done and enables people
to make believe that the train is picking up speed when in fact it
is standing stock-still,'' he said, referring to Soviet leader
Mikhail S. Gorbachev's policy of openness.
   The losses could have been minimized, he claimed, if the fire
had been properly extinguished instead of by the ``antediluvian
method'' of having 25 fire engines flood the building for 19 hours.
   He accused library management of trying to hide the extent of
the damage and the mishandling of the fire and said administrator
V.A. Filov and his assistant, V.P. Leonov, should be fired.
   Filov originally estimated damage at about $4,800, and promised
the library would reopen within a few days.
   The March 8 edition of the party newspaper Pravda said damage
was at least $480,000, but added that the figure was based on 1956
values and that some of the lost material was priceless.
   Filov and Leonov ``both acted, in the first days, according to
the `model' programmed by the mistakes of the Chernobyl catastrophe
_ they tried to belittle the cultural loss in the grossest
manner,'' Likhachev claimed.
   He was referring to Soviet authorities' initial attempts to hush
up the world's worst nuclear disaster, an April 1986 explosion at
the Chernobyl nuclear plant in which at least 31 people died and
millions were exposed to increased levels of radioactivity.
   ``A bulldozer was called, and huge piles of burned, dampened and
undamaged books were destroyed,'' Likhachev wrote. ``Library
workers were prohibited from saving books from this heap of ruins.
All this was in order to hide more quickly from the eyes of society
the size of the catastrophe.''
   Mold started growing on the water-damaged books within a week,
and only through the efforts of literature students and other
volunteers has serious work begun to salvage the water-logged
books, he said.
   Special driers have been brought in, absorbent paper has been
painstakingly applied between the pages of soaked books and great
stores of other damaged materials that rescuers could not get to
immediately have been frozen to preserve them during the interim.
   He criticized officials for failing to seek foreign help in
salvaging damaged books.

   The United States won a gold and silver
medal at the 19th World Irish Dancing Championships, which drew
more than 4,000 participants from nine countries.
   John Jennings, from The Golden School of Irish dancing in New
York, won the world title in the competition for 17- to 19-year-old
boys on Thursday night.
   Second place went to another New Yorker, Neill Reagan, of the
Inish Free dance school in Miller Place, according to official
results released by the Irish Dancing Commission.
   There were 19 teen-agers in the competition from Australia,
Scotland, Ireland, England, Wales, Canada and the United States.
   Canadian Ryan Carroll of the Butler School in Oakville, Ontario,
won second place in the competition for 15- to 17-year-old boys.
   The championships, which started March 26 and end Easter Sunday,
are being held in Galway for the third time.
   Several other Americans missed out on the top rankings but were
named overseas winners for achieving the best scores among foreign
participants.
   Jean Butler of The Golden School in New York was the overseas
winner in the competition for 16- and 17-year-old girls, getting a
special distinction for placing sixth among 82 entries.
   Julie Showaher of the Dennehy School in Oaklawn, Ill., was
overseas winner in the competition for 15- to 16-year-old girls,
and Collette Cremins from the same school was overseas winner in

<TEXT>
   After arrests for art smuggling and ticket
scalping, the Rev. Lorenzo Zorza claimed he was only trying to help
his friends. These days the ex-Vatican diplomat has new friends,
federal officials say _ and they operate an international drug ring.
   Zorza, 46, was identified Thursday as one of 39 people in the
New York area involved in swapping cocaine for heroin with the
Sicilian Mafia in what U.S. authorities described as the biggest
international drug bust ever. For the Italian-born fugitive priest,
it was just another twist in what was apparently a strange double
life.
   Known to his friends as Father Lorenzo, Zorza handled an
assortment of church duties since arriving here in 1969: at the
Consolata Fathers home for runaway girls, as fourth ranking Vatican
diplomat to the United Nations, as assistant pastor at a Manhattan
church.
   Authorities provided a different resume: art smuggler, ticket
scalper (although charges were eventually dropped), heroin smuggler.
   ``Among other criminal activities, Zorza carries money derived
from illegal sources back and forth between the U.S. and Italy,''
the heroin complaint against the priest charged. The priest also is
heard in several wiretapped conversations allegedly talking about
the ring.
   Zorza remained at large Friday after failing to get off a flight
from Italy at Kennedy International Airport on Thursday, as
authorities expected.
   His first encounter with federal authorities came in 1982, when
Zorza was arrested for using his clerical garb and diplomatic
status to smuggle two 16th- century oil paintings worth more than
$100,000 from Italy into the United States for an $8,000 fee.
   Zorza, who was at the United Nations at the time, was placed on
probation for three years after pleading guilty to charges in the
case.
   ``I did it sincerely to help somebody,'' Zorza told the judge,
asserting he did not know the paintings were stolen. ``I'm terribly
sorry.''
   And after charges of scalping $40,000 worth of tickets to
Broadway's ``Les Miserables'' were dropped in August 1987, Zorza
said he was ``just trying to help out two friends.''
   Zorza was ordained in 1966, moved to the United States three
years later and became an American citizen in 1976.
   Authorities said Zorza remained a member of the Consolata
Fathers of Somerset, N.J., but a priest there said the order ended
its association with him more than a decade ago by mutual agreement.
   ``We just know what we heard last night,'' said the priest, who
declined to give his name. ``We don't know what he's doing, or
where he's doing it.''
   The Archdiocese of New York also doesn't know where Zorza is, a
spokesman said Friday. Zorza was assistant pastor at St. Agnes
church in 1983, but officials at the church hung up the phone when
called for comment.
   Zorza is charged with conspiracy to distribute and possess with
intent to distribute heroin, cocaine and marijuana. The conspiracy
charge carries a maximum penalty of life imprisonment.

<TEXT>
   Italy's defense minister assured Secretary of State
George P. Shultz on Friday that the government is considering
seriously the possible transfer to Italy of F-16 jets being evicted
from Spain.
   But Defense Minister Valerio Zanone did not commit Italy to
accepting the fighters. He said the entire NATO alliance should be
involved in the decision.
   Shultz took up the issue of the F-16s with Zanone during a stop
in Rome before heading for the Middle East on Sunday to continue
efforts to spur Arab-Israeli peace talks.
   Italy is considered the prime candidate to take the 72
fighter-bombers of the U.S. 401st Tactical Fighter Wing, based in
Torrejon, Spain. In January, Washington bowed to a Spanish demand
to remove the planes within three years.
   In a communique issued after the talks, the Defense Ministry
said Zanone ``stressed the satisfactory progress of the study under
way to identify all elements necessary to a carefully pondered
decision, which will have to be made in concert with Parliament.''
   Asked at a news conference whether an accord in principle had
been reached on the F-16s, Zanone replied, ``I wouldn't say an
accord in principle. There is serious attention by the Italian
government to the problem.''
   His statements did not go far beyond those made in February
following talks in Rome with Defense Secretary Frank Carlucci.
   Zanone reiterated Italy's position that the F-16s must remain in
Europe to protect NATO's southern flank, but that a decision on
where they should be relocated and how to finance the move must be
decided by the entire Western alliance.
   ``There is a predisposition by Italy to study the possibility''
of accepting the F-16s, the minister told reporters.
   Shultz did not meet with reporters after the meeting with Zanone.
   State Department spokesman Charles Redman said the meeting with
Zanone was ``not in any sense an effort to make commitments'' on
the F-16s.
   Zanone said he and Shultz discussed the ``various possible''
sites in Italy where the F-16s could be based, but he declined to
identify them. Italian media have identified possible sites as the
bases of Gioia del Colle in southern Puglia, Decimomannu in
Sardinia, the present cruise missile base in Comiso, Sicily, and
the U.S. base in Aviana in northeastern Italy.
   Zanone, the lone Cabinet minister from the tiny Liberal Party,
noted that the issue will have to be faced by Italy's new
government. Premier Giovanni Goria resigned three weeks ago, and
fellow Christian Democrat Ciriaco de Mita is trying to form a new
five-party coalition.
   Some Italian politicians, including former premier Bettino
Craxi, a Socialist, have voiced concerns about the possible
relocation. The Communists and other opposition groups are firmly
opposed.
   Shultz met earlier Friday with President Francesco Cossiga and
Foreign Minister Giulio Andreotti.
   Speaking with reporters earlier on the plane taking him to Rome,
Shultz was cautiously upbeat about his new Middle East peace
mission. His trip last month failed to bring an agreement.
   ``I think we have a chance to see some motion,'' he said of his
shuttling to Israel, Jordan, Syria, Egypt and Saudi Arabia.
   Shultz said he felt especially positive about the role of
Jordan's King Hussein, describing him as a ``key player'' in the
peace process.
   ``I hope we can make some headway,'' he said.
   So far only Eygpt has endorsed the plan to have talks on
Palestinian self-rule begin on May 1.
   On Saturday, Shultz is to have a private audience with Pope John
Paul II. He also plans to attend the pope's Easter Mass on Sunday
before leaving for Jerusalem.

   When it came to the crunch, Eric
Erickson says he's proud to be a ``Chocolate City Man.''
   Erickson, 31, wrote a song to defend his birthplace in the
``Chocolate Wars'' between Burlington, the home of Nestle Food
Corp., and Hershey Foods Corp. of Hershey, Pa.
   The battle began when Burlington adopted the name ``Chocolate
City USA'' during the debut of a chocolate festival in May 1987.
   Nestle, the city's largest employer, embraced the idea. But
Hershey Foods protested when Burlington officials filed for
trademark protection of the adopted name and a logo bearing a
chocolate morsel. Hershey Foods claimed they bore too close a
resemblance to its trademarks, including the name ``Chocolate Town
USA'' and the Hershey kiss.
   ``A word of warning, Hershey _ and it's more than just a hunch.
Try and scare us with your `kiss of death' and you'll get the
Nestle's Crunch,'' Erickson sings.
   He also advises Hershey: ``Forget about the lawsuit _ you'll
never make it stick. You'd be better off to get a glass of milk and
have some Nestle's Quick.''
   ``The song really makes you feel proud of this city,'' said Jack
Berry, chocolate festival coordinator.
   Hershey Foods was closed Friday and officials could not be
reached for comment.

   A group of University of Massachusetts
professors has embraced ``squash power'' to help the land-grant
university celebrate its 125th anniversary.
   The professors have stuffed a young Hubbard squash into a
foot-square Plexiglass chamber so the fruit can expand only in a
downward direction. Now, the giant squash is growing ever larger in
a campus greenhouse, compressing a set of springs connected to a
set of load cells connected to a balance beam.
   And on Charter Day, April 29, the contraption will be wheeled
out to the campus pond to demonstrate the power of the fruit by
hoisting a tractor.
   The Hubbard hijinks have historical precedent, said John W.
Denison, professor emeritus in the College of Food and Natural
Resources. The experiment was first performed at the institution in
1874 by its third president, Col. William S. Clark, a ``somewhat
flamboyant botanist,'' according to Denison.
   Before it expired, Clark's squash hoisted about 5,000 pounds
worth of anvils, anchors, drainpipes, barrels of sand and
``whatever else he found lying around,'' Denison said.
   ``We figure to do a bit better, maybe 30,000 pounds'' Denison
said Wednesday. ``They've been really babying that vine over in the
greenhouse. They even come in on weekends to feed it.''

   Elementary school Principal Gail Thompson
may think twice before betting with her pupils again.
   Thompson challenged her Doniphan Elementary School pupils to
read 10,000 books from October through March as part of the ``Book
It!'' national reading program. If she lost, she promised to spend
four hours in a tub of oatmeal.
   The 200 youngsters met the goal, so the principal headed for the
porridge Thursday, clad in a 1920s style bathing outfit, checked
hat and goggles.
   ``Ohhh, this is awful,'' she said as she stuck her foot in the
cereal.
   One of the youngsters was worried about the principal's ordeal.
   ``It's OK, honey,'' Thompson told a pre-schooler. ``You don't
have to feel sorry for me. It's just fun. I asked for it.''
   The pupils also were given a special breakfast treat in honor of
Thompson's adventure. You guessed it, oatmeal.

   The Reagan administation threatened a
presidential veto of the newly minted congressional trade
compromise Friday unless major changes are made when lawmakers come
back from their spring break.
   The administration says the president's hands would be tied
unreasonably by provisions in the legislation calling for import
curbs to retaliate for trade agreement violations.
   The compromise worked out by House and Senate negotiators
Thursday night would transfer authority to retaliate from the
president to the U.S. trade representative. But it would leave
waiver authority if the president thought the costs of import curbs
would outweigh the benefits.
   The measure also would impose restricitions on imports to punish
Toshiba Corp. of Japan and its Toshiba Machine Co. subsidiary for
the latter's role in the sale to the Soviets of computerized
equipment that helps make Soviet submarines more difficult to
detect.
   ``We still have grave reservations about several of the
provisions, including plant closings, Toshiba, presidential
authority and some of the mandatory retaliatory provisions,''
spokesman Marlin Fitzwater told reporters traveling with Reagan to
California for a 10-day vacation.
   The plant closing provision would require employers to provide
their employees with 60-day notice of plant closings and
large-scale layoffs.
   Lawmakers who drew up the compromise wrapped up most of their
work before heading for the airports to start their spring break.
But they left enough loose ends to cloud the picture.
   Farm lawmakers were still wrangling over details, and a
House-passed plan to require registration of foreign property
ownership in the United States still had lawmakers deadlocked. They
planned to tackle the issue again later.
   Renewed White House veto threats should put the spotlight on
Senate Finance Committee Chairman Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas, who is
empowered under the rules to start action that could lead to a
so-called superconference meeting of lawmakers to perform radical
surgery.
   Fitzwater said such a meeting already was in the works.
   ``The superconference will meet after recess, and if substantial
changes aren't made by the superconference, the president's senior
advisers will recommend a veto,'' Fitzwater said.
   Earlier, U.S Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter said Congress
``jettisoned a lot of undesirable things'' in negotiations this
week.
   ``The question is whether they jettisoned enough,'' he said.
``And we need a couple of days to assess that.'' He said there
``certainly are some provisions in there of dubious merit.''
   Some lawmakers already were indicating they saw room for
revision.
   ``The bill is good strong market opening legislation,'' said
Sen. John C. Danforth, R-Mo., one of the conferees.
   ``I am convinced that the trade provisions which are the heart
of the bill could be signed into law if they were standing alone,''
he said. ``But they are not standing alone. Congress will have an
opportunity in mid-April to consider any changes needed to meet
remaining objections from the administration.''

<TEXT>
   The inventors of a flying machine to be
used in an attempt to break the world distance record for
human-powered flight said Friday that strong winds may delay the
endeavor for another three days.
   ``I think it's virtually impossible at this point to fly
tomorrow ... but Monday, Tuesday it should be feasible,'' said
Steve K. Bussulari, a Massachusetts Institute of Technology
aerospace expert heading the Daedalus project.
   Gale winds up to 45 mph are preventing the 70-pound plane from
attempting the 74-mile flight from Crete to the island of
Santorini, also known as Thira.
   ``Essentially, the airplane is ready to go anytime, and the
pilot's ready to go. We're in a pattern waiting on the weather,''
John S. Langford, the project director, told reporters.
   The flight will also update the 3,500-year-old legend of the
inventor Daedalus, who escaped from Crete with his son, Icarus, on
wings he made from feathers and wax. Icarus crashed into the sea
and drowned after soaring so close to the sun that his wings
melted, but Daedalus flew safely across the Aegean.
   The Daedalus 88 aircraft will be pedaled in a five-hour flight
that requires dead calm or a light southerly tailwind.
   Five pilots _ four Americans and a Greek _ are taking turns on
standby for 48 hours at a stretch and cycling up to 90 miles daily
to stay in shape. There are four backup pilots in case something
goes wrong.
   ``I feel a little disappointed I won't be going but I've been
watching the weather and saw this delay coming,'' said Greg Zack,
26, a professional cyclist who was ready to fly Friday or Saturday.
   The three-year MIT project already has produced one world record
distance for human-powered flight of 37.2 miles. It was set by
Glenn Tremml, piloting a Daedalus prototype plane in circles around
Edwards Air Force Base in California in January 1987.
   But the straight-line world record still stands at 22 miles set
by Bryan Allen in 1979 flying across the English Channel.
   ``With the right wind, Daedalus 88 could probably go 100 miles,
but we'll be satisfied with a touchdown on Santorini,'' Langford
said.
   Langford said the 36-member team will wait until mid-May if
necessary to make the record flight.
   ``We've got funds for another six weeks and two backup planes
that we'd also be willing to lose in the attempt,'' he said.
   The graphite epoxy and plastic aircraft with a wingspan of 112
feet could break up if the pilot crashes into the sea.
   Greek navy vessels and a flotilla of inflatable crafts will
escort the Daedalus plane, which would fly just 15 feet above the
waves.

   The government on Friday apologized
and offered compensation for hundreds of people killed and wounded
when its troops scoured the city of Kwangju to put down a 1980
civil revolt.
   It was the first official government apology for its handling of
the citizens' uprising, the worst in modern South Korean history.
   President Roh Tae-woo, who took office Feb. 25 with promises of
reform, pledged during his campaign to change the government's
official account of the violence and offer financial compensation
for victims.
   ``The government offers its sincere apology, not only to the
victims of the turmoil, but also to all residents of Kwangju and
the general public,'' Culture and Information Minister Chung Han-mo
said in a statement Friday.
   Chung, the official government spokesman, also said the
resistance was ``part of the democratization efforts of the
students and citizens in Kwangju'' in a concession demanded by city
residents.
   His description sharply departed from the stand taken by the
government of former President Chun Doo-hwan, which used the terms
``rebellion'' and ``rioters'' to describe what happened in Kwangju.
   The city, 200 miles south of Seoul, is the capital of opposition
leader Kim Dae-jung's home province, South Cholla.
   He was arrested in a government crackdown on opposition leaders
May 17, 1980, when the former military-controlled government
expanded martial law and moved to suppress political dissent.
   Most pro-democracy demonstrations elsewhere in the country were
quashed, but the struggle in Kwangju led the government to move
martial law troops into the city.
   Kwangju citizens, armed with rifles and machine guns taken from
government arsenals, drove out troops. However, reinforcements
retook the city nine days later.
   By official count, 191 people were killed and more than 800
hurt. Dissident sources put the casualty figure much higher.
   The government spokesman said Friday that Roh believed a
satisfactory resolution of the Kwangju issue was essential to
promoting national reconciliation. Others have said Roh is trying
to distance himself from the authoritarian Chun government to
prepare for National Assembly elections at the end of the month.
   Roh, a former general and schoolmate of Chun, helped the former
president gain power in 1980.
   The government spokesman said the administration would offer
financial support and employment to bereaved families and wounded
victims. The government also vowed to beautify a cemetery where
many of the Kwangju victims are buried.
   Civic leaders in Kwangju welcomed the government's offer of
financial aid.
   But they have insisted that the government investigate the cause
of the deaths and punish those responsible. The main opposition
political group, the Reunification Democratic Party, called the
government measures a sham.
   Government officials, however, have said an inquiry would only
aggravate old wounds.

look at the $2.5 million Bel Air quarters she and the president
will move to after their lease is up at the White House.
   No one was talking either about how much the first couple is
paying in rent, but the house was purchased for them by Wall
Management Services, a group of about 20 friends of the Reagans.
The group, whose members were not identified, gave the Reagans a
three-year lease with an option to buy, Mrs. Reagan's press
secretary, Elaine Crispen, said earlier this week.
   Mrs. Reagan toured the ranch-style house Thursday.
   It has three bedrooms, six baths, guest room, living room,
family room, sun room, butler's pantry and three servants' rooms.
It is tucked away on a 1\-acre estate in exclusive Bel Air, 12
miles northwest of downtown Los Angeles.
   The Reagans' new neighbors will include Elizabeth Taylor, Joan
Rivers, Zsa Zsa Gabor, Mac Davis and Burt Bacharach.

   Gallagher is the fifth person charged in the incident.
   Two men have been charged with murder, a third was charged with

<HEAD>IRS Promises Quick Refunds for Wrongly Taxed Student Incomes</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM LUTHER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Tax Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Internal Revenue Service is promising
quick relief for students who are due refunds because they were
wrongly taxed on teaching or research stipends earned during
graduate school.
   In general, any pre-1987 stipend that meets three tests spelled
out by the agency in a 1975 ruling will be considered non-taxable,
the IRS said Friday. Students who apply for refunds of any
additional tax will get prompt attention, the agency said.
   The IRS announcement was aimed at clearing up confusion
resulting from the fact that courts have issued conflicting
decisions on the question. Some court rulings have been
considerably more stringent than the 1975 IRS policy, and some IRS
district offices have chosen to use the court decisions as a guide.
   As a result, thousands of students have been billed for back
taxes on their stipends. The IRS says there is no concerted drive
to audit the returns of graduate students, and says much of the
blame for the students' problem is because many colleges reported
their stipends as taxable income.
   A student who has paid additional taxes because a district IRS
office wrongly considered a stipend taxable should file an amended
return (Form 1040X) and ask for a refund, the IRS said. Those who
have received a bill but have not yet paid the tax should file for
an abatement.
   ``Taxpayers should clearly indicate on the form that the claim
is being filed for reconsideration of the teaching or research
stipend issue under Revenue Ruling 75-280,'' the IRS said.
   That ruling states that a stipend is non-taxable if:
   _The student was a degree candidate at the time the stipend was
earned.
   _The student performed research, teaching or other services that
were required for a degree.
   _Similar services were required of all candidates for the degree.
   If those tests are met, the IRS said, the stipend will be
considered non-taxable under the presumption that its primary
purpose was to further the student's education or training.
   The rule applies only to stipends paid before 1987. A new law
that took effect in 1987 specifically taxes such income.

<HEAD>Woman Sues Bank over Credit Card Hassle in Philippines</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A woman says her sick infant and 6-year-old
daughter were held as collateral in the Philippines until her hotel
bill was paid, and has turned her anger on the Boston bank she says
caused the trouble.
   Maria Luz DeIulis, who failed in her bid to sue the hotel, has
sued the Bank of Boston for $2 million, saying her anguish was
caused by someone at the bank who bungled her credit card account.
   A Suffolk Superior Court judge this week refused a request by
the bank to dismiss the suit she filed last year. The bank says the
suit is groundless and that DeIulis brought all the trouble on
herself by using a card she had asked be restricted so her
boyfriend could not use it.
   DeIulis, 39, of Lynn, a Filipino native, said her ordeal began
when she returned to Manila in November 1986 with two of her three
children to see her ailing father.
   DeIulis, her 6-month-old son and daughter checked into the Royal
Palm Hotel in Manila for a week. She presented her Bank of Boston
credit card and thought little of her $260 tab until shortly before
she was to leave.
   ``They called my room at 11 o'clock at night and said the bank
had voided my credit card,'' said DeIulis.
   DeIulis said she asked the hotel to check again but that the
hotel responded by confiscating her credit card and calling police,
who seized the family's passports.
   Because it was the start of a three-day holiday in the
Philippines, DeIulis said she was unable to go to a bank. As a
result, the police ordered a security guard to watch them during
the holiday.
   After the weekend, DeIulis was escorted to a bank by police. She
says police and hotel management said the children could not leave
the hotel until the bill was paid and that it took most of the day
to arrange to get the money.
   ``My baby son was sick, he had a fever and diarrhea,'' DeIulis
said. ``I was nervous all the time. I was horrified. I thought they
might take the kids away from me forever, I thought they might take
them away.''
   DeIulis said hotel officials released the children after she
paid her bill and after she complained to the American Embassy and
Ministry of Tourism in Manila.
   ``This is the craziest story,'' Bank of Boston spokesman Wayne
Taylor said Friday. ``It's absolutely crazy. It's the most
groundless, frivolous suit. It's the most ridiculous thing in the
world.''
   Taylor said DeIulis contacted the bank before she left for the
Philippines and asked that her boyfriend's name be taken off the
account. Taylor said the bank gave her a choice of either notifying
them in writing, or canceling the account and getting a new card.
Taylor said DeIulis was unsure what to do and agreed to have the
card ``restricted,'' meaning no one could use it.
   But DeIulis said she had paid her credit card bill in full at
the time and understood that she could continue to use it.
   DeIulis said her attempt to sue the hotel was dismissed in the
Philippines.
   Arman Mamangon, an operator at the Royal Palm Hotel for eight
years, said in a telephone interview Friday that he was unaware of
the DeIulis case. But he said that when customers fail to pay their
bills, the hotel ``sometimes takes collateral like a passport, or
maybe jewelry.''
   Mamangon laughed when asked if children were held as collateral.
``No, I never heard of that,'' he said.

   The Wednesday Night Ladies House
League says their bowling alley manager cares more about how many
beers they knock down than pins.
   The league has been ousted from its 6 p.m. time slot in favor of
a men's league _ who put more of a dent in a keg than the ladies.
   ``The women are out, the men are in because they can drink more
than us, ... that's the bottom line,'' league official Mary-Lou
Allen said Thursday. ``Drinking should not be a prerequisite for
bowling.''
   Jimmy Walker, manager of Fern Hill Golf and Country Club lanes
in this Detroit suburb, said he asked the 60 league members
Wednesday to switch to another time slot for their 30-week season
beginning next fall strictly for business reasons.
   ``Women's leagues water you do death,'' he said, bemoaning what
he says is their preference for water over more costly beverages.
``That's why most places don't cater to women on the first
(evening) shift. The bowling business is not strictly bowling.''
   He said the men's league taking the women's place next fall will
bring in $100 to $150 per night in addition to regular bowling
costs. The women sometimes spent as little as $40 a night, he said.
   And some leagues are worth still more.
   ``What would you do if you owned the business?'' he asked.
``We've got an AMVETS league in here that does $250 to $275 a
night, and they're all great guys.''
   The league isn't sure what it will do, but Carol Blossey,
outgoing president and a member of Mothers Against Drunk Driving,
said she plans to file a complaint with her organization.
   ``I have a beer once in a while, but I can't bowl well if I'm
drunk,'' said Blossey, who carries a 167 average. ``I feel we're
being discriminated against.''

   The Woodland Park Zoo says it no longer has a
problem with people abandoning their rabbits after Easter since
word spread that zookeepers feed some of the unwanted pets to the
lions.
   Zoo spokesman Hank Klein said Friday that in years past the zoo
was overrun with rabbits. After Easter passed, some people found
that bunnies aren't as much fun in May as they were in March or
April.
   Abandoned rabbits damaged the zoo grounds and created other
problems, Klein said. Domestic rabbits can't survive on their own
and end up starving, getting run over by cars or eaten by owls and
hawks.
   The zoo now has a pest control officer who traps and kills
rabbits, adding them to the daily feed for lions, wolves and
cougars.
   ``There are not too many people that want cute little Thumper to
end up in the jaws of a lion,'' Klein said.
   ``It's not a good idea to surprise someone with a bunny,'' he
said. ``We encourage people to think very carefully before giving
any animal, especially as a surprise.''

<HEAD>Town's Only Marshal Says He Was Held Captive But Escaped</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BLUE MOUNTAIN, Miss. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A town marshal missing for a day
after disappearing on a burglary call said Friday he escaped after
being held in a closet and car trunk by four men he thought were
about to kill him.
   ``I knew I was done for anyway and I had nothing to lose,'' Gary
Stokes said of his early Friday escape in rural northeast
Mississippi. ``When they let me out of the trunk, I hit the ground
running and I didn't look back.''
   Stokes, 35, disappeared about 12:55 a.m. Thursday after calling
for back-up units while investigating a possible attempted burglary
at a store in this town of about 860 residents.
   Police arriving at the store found his car with the engine still
running, the lights on and his radio microphone hanging outside the
door. His revolver and billfold were found nearby.
   ``About all I can tell you is that he is back and we are
investigating.'' said Tippah County Sheriff Leroy Meeks said Friday.
   Sammy Pickens, a Highway Patrol investigator, said the case was
being treated ``as a felony ... an abduction, but we can't release
any more information at this time.''
   Stokes, the town's only full-time policeman, said he was ``still
nervous and kind of shook up. They had said several times they were
going to kill me, and I believed them.''
   He said he managed to escape when the men stopped their car near
Myrtle in adjacent Union County ``because one of them had to go to
the bathroom. I asked them if I could use the bathroom, too, and
they agreed.''
   Stokes said he immediately ran down railroad tracks beside the
highway and ducked into a wooded area before making his way to a
house and calling police in nearby New Albany.
   ``I had just about given up hope,'' he said. ``They were talking
about robbing another store around Holly Springs and said before
they got there, they would kill me.''
   Lawmen had used dogs as they searched for Stokes in rural areas
surrounding Blue Mountain all day Thursday and well into the night.
   Stokes said that while investigating what he believed was an
attempted break-in at the store he confronted two men, drew his
weapon and ordered them to stop.
   ``While I was chasing them, two others came up from behind and
one of them hit me,'' he said. ``That caused my gun to discharge
above their heads.''
   He said the men drove him to a highway rest area about five
miles away.
   ``One wanted to kill me right then,'' Stokes said, but the
others talked him out of it. ``They then put me in the trunk. I
spent several hours in the trunk and all day in the closet of an
abandoned house.''
   He said the four put him back in the car trunk Thursday night
and drove to the Myrtle area, where he escaped sometime before 3
a.m.
   Stokes said he had seen the four men earlier in the week in
another car. He said they were not from the Blue Mountain area.
   Mary Stokes, the officer's step-mother, said Stokes appeared
tired and shaken when he arrived home Friday morning, and ``he's
got a bad place on his face where they hit him.
   ``But I asked him if he would ever put the uniform on again and
he told me he was going right back to work because he is needed.''

<HEAD>Naming Of Plastic Surgery Expert For Miss San Diego Pageant Causes
Flap</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN DIEGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The naming of a plastic surgery consultant to
the Miss San Diego Pageant is drawing grimaces from state and
national pageant officials, but Stephen Grifka doesn't understand
what all the fuss is about.
   The Culver City doctor said cosmetic surgery is a legitimate
option for today's beauty queens.
   ``This is a competition,'' Grifka said. ``And in order to get
the competitive edge, they want to enhance themselves to the
maximum amount. I can't change a couch into a chair. But I can
certainly fluff up a pillow.''
   Dayna Waitley, executive director of the Miss San Diego Pageant,
appointed Grifka to the unpaid consulting position at the
recommendation of a mutal friend.
   In a Jan. 5 letter to Grifka, Waitley wrote that the expertise
of the doctor, who specializes in nose jobs, scar removal and
facelifts, could help contestants realize their full potential.
   The appointment brought a storm of criticism from other beauty
pageant officials.
   ``That's the last kind of person who would ever be involved with
the Miss America Pageant,'' Leonard C. Horn, chief executive
officer of the Miss America Pageant, said in an interview in
Friday's Los Angeles Times San Diego edition.
   ``We have consultants on hair and evening gowns, but to have a
consultant on plastic surgery seems a little strange,'' Horn said.
   Though Horn branded the idea as ``laughable,'' plastic surgery
is permitted under pageant rules. Indeed, there were reports
shortly after the 1982 contest that titlist Debra Sue Maffett had
undergone extensive cosmetic work.
   ``There is no chance in the world he would ever be associated
with us,'' said Robert Arnhym, chief executive officer of the Miss
California Pageant, which oversees the San Diego pageant and 41
other contests throughout the state.
   ``No one in the state of California has ever encouraged our
winners to have plastic surgery _ ever,'' Arnhym said.
   Grifka had no involvement in this year's pageant, which was held
March 19, Waitley said. She said she will ask the pageant's board
of directors to review the arrangement because of the protest.
   For his part, Grifka said he accepted the appointment with the
best of intentions and has no desire to bring negative publicity to
the pageant.
   ``These contests are not strictly a show of beauty,'' he said.
``If you attended a pageant you would be amazed at how talented
these girls are.''

<HEAD>Joe Collins, Theatrical Agent and Father of Joan Collins, Dies</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Theatrical agent Joe Collins, the father of
``Dynasty'' actress Joan Collins and novelist Jackie Collins, died
Friday at his home. He was 85.
   Collins, who helped launch the careers of Peter Sellers, Tom
Jones and Roger Moore and convinced Joan Collins to take her famous
role as Alexis in the popular TV series, suffered from a kidney
infection, according to Press Association, Britain's domestic news
agency.
   Although he came from a family of stage performers, Collins said
he did not consider show business a suitable profession for his
daughters. ``Too many pitfalls,'' he once said.
   He later came to feel differently: ``My children are healthy and
have made their mark on the world. I think I can claim that almost
every person in every land has had some form of entertainment, some
pleasure brought their way by one member or another of my family.''
   Collins was born in South Africa, where his parents, both from
London, entertained. They returned to Britain when Collins was a
year old and he was educated there.
   He began his show business career as office boy with Moss
Empires theaters in London and later worked as an assistant theater
manager in Sheffield and Liverpool.
   In 1931, he became a theatrical agent. The first artist he
signed was dancer Lew Grade, now television producer Lord Grade,
who became his partner. When Grade left the Collins and Grade
agency, Collins continued alone.
   Collins married his first wife, Elsa, in 1932, and she gave
birth to their daughter, Joan, the next year. Elsa died in 1962.
   Collins did not encourage his daughter's early acting ambitions,
but once she won a place at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art, he
supported her. He even set up a repertory company in southeastern
England to help her career.
   He later persuaded her to take the role of Alexis in ``Dynasty''
even though a theatrical company was trying to hold her to a
previous contract.
   Collins said he was proud of his daughter Jackie's success as an
author but never read her books, which included ``Hollywood Wives''
and ``Lucky.'' He declared the sexy novels were ``not my cup of
tea.''
   His own biography was titled ``A Touch of Collins.''
   Besides Joan and Jackie, Collins is survived by his second wife,
Irene, and their daughter, Natasha. Services were scheduled for
Tuesday in London.

   Rumors that a satanic cult planned to
sacrifice a virgin reached a peak this week, leading people to keep
hundreds of children home from school and inundate police with
calls.
   Despite the hysteria, police and school officials said extensive
investigations didn't produce any evidence to support the rumors.
   Pike County residents locked their doors and kept children home
from school by the hundreds Thursday, the day the rumors said was
the intended date of human sacrifice.
   ``We have a 30 percent absenteeism in the district,'' McComb
Assistant School Superintendent Leslie Daniels said Thursday.
``Some of that is due to the weather; some of it is because it's
the day before a holiday. But from the calls we've had, I believe
much of it's from the rumors.''
   There are about 3,700 students in the district.
   Sheriff Robert Lawson has said in the past that there are 22
members of a satanic cult in Pike County and that the group has
probably sacrificed dogs, cats, goats and other animals in secluded
areas.
   Officials said the latest rumors led them to fear the public
might act irrationally if someone was identified _ even erroneously
_ as one of the cult members.
   ``As paranoid as this public is, some innocent person could get
hurt,'' said Lee Barkdull, McComb's acting director of public
safety. ``I'm worried about mischief _ someone spray-painting
something crazy and getting caught by others.''
   Since about March 24, Barkdull's office has fielded dozens of
calls from residents worried by reports that a cult planned human
sacrifices and that several McComb schoolchildren were on a list of
potential victims.
   Police believe the story spread quickly in schools, reaching a
crisis level when parents got wind of it.
   Students at Gibson High School said teachers canceled tests
Thursday when classes began with small numbers of students. They
also said rumors persisted that Satan worshipers planned a midnight
march through town, with a later sacrifice of a baby and a
13-year-old.
   ``The story is that Good Friday is their Black Sabbath, and they
need a sacrifice,'' said 16-year-old Tammy Perry, a 10th-grader at
Gibson High School.
   ``I figure it's a bunch of kids playing practical jokes,'' said
Terry Butrick of Summit.
   ``I believe people worship Satan. Why not? People worship their
car, why not Satan?'' said Butrick, who has two children in
elementary school. ``But as far as me running around getting out
the garlic and the silver bullets, nah.''

<TEXT>
   Soviet TV reported Friday that strikes have
paralyzed most industry in Stepanakert, the main city in a Caucasus
region that is at the center of an ethnic dispute.
   The nightly news program, ``Vremya,'' said construction was at a
standstill and delivery of goods to and from the city had been
disrupted.
   ``Public transport is virtually at a halt and many enterprises
are idle on account of the failure to turn out to work,'' it said.
   Reports by ``Vremya'' and the official news agency Tass appeared
aimed at convincing Armenians it is futile to press demands for
annexation of the Nagorno-Karabakh region, which was made part of
Azerbaijan in 1923.
   About 75 percent of the 157,000 residents are ethnic Armenians,
most of whom are Christian. Azeris, the indigenous population of
Azerbaijan, are predominantly Shiite Moslem.
   Farmers in Nagorno-Karabakh were shown on television hard at
work with spring planting. The news reader said the Akhtanak
collective farm had appealed for a return to normal in Stepanakert.
   Cameras panned deserted building sites and quiet streets in the
city while the narrator explained that most workers were staying
home.
   Stepanakert's industries have run up debts of ``several million
rubles,'' the report said. No more specific figure was provided.
   Most industrial activity stopped March 24 in protest of the
Communist Party leadership's refusal to attach Nagorno-Karabakh to
Soviet Armenia.
   Activists in Armenia and Nagorno-Karabakh began demonstrations
in mid-February demanding that Nagorno-Karabakh, slightly smaller
than Delaware, be made part of Armenia even though there is no
common border. The Kremlin refused and said protests were
``intolerable,'' although it announced a development program.
   The Armenian claims incited riots Feb. 28 in the Azerbaijan city
of Sumgait. Official reports said 32 people were killed and nearly
200 injured, and that about 400 were arrested for murder, rape,
looting and other crimes.
   Communist Party officials said the Nagorno-Karabakh development
plan would involve spending 400 million rubles _ $640 million at
the official exchange rate _ to improve housing, education,
Armenian-language literature and broadcasts, and other elements of
life in the region.
   Complaints that Nagorno-Karabakh was losing its traditional
Armenian character were among points cited by activists in their
demand for annexation.
   ``Vremya'' said the development plan will not be carried out if
the strike continues.
   ``The people of Stepanakert have long been renowned for their
good sense, their love of work, their skill,'' the news reader
said. ``Let them show all these qualities now in the present
difficult situation.''
   Security forces were deployed in Yerevan, the Armenian capital,
earlier in the week to guard against more disorder there, but it
was not clear from the Vremya footage whether similar measures were
being taken in Stepanakert.
   Telephone calls to the region were not answered Friday, even at
such facilities as railroad stations and newspaper offices.
   In its only dispatch on the matter Friday, Tass outlined legal
problems involved in addressing Armenian demands for annexation. It
said the legislatures of both republics would have to approve any
change in status and the national Supreme Soviet would have the
final say.

<HEAD>Unemployment Rate Falls To Decade-Low 5.6 Percent</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MATT YANCEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Labor Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   WASHINGTON _ (AP) _ The nation's unemployment rate fell to a new
decade-low 5.6 percent in March even though there were 306,000
fewer Americans at work than a month earlier, the government said
Friday.
   The drop from February's 5.7 percent rate was credited entirely
to a 455,000 decrease in the number of people in the labor force _
those either holding jobs or seeking work _ raising inflationary
alarms among some economists.
   ``It's just one month, but it indicates that wages are not high
enough to coax second earners out of the home any more,'' said
Roger Brinner, an analyst for Data Resources Inc., an economic
consulting firm in Lexington, Mass.
   ``If the labor force has stopped growing, then wage inflation
may be right around the corner, not now but possibly in early
1989,'' Brinner said. ``Higher wages might coax more people out of
the woodwork, but any increase in the standard of living will be
temporary because prices will soon catch up.''
   The number of Americans in the labor force dropped from
approximately 123.1 million to 122.6 million between February and
March, as the percentage of the population age 16 and over holding
or seeking jobs declined from an all-time record 66.3 percent to 66
percent.
   The government has been warning about a reduced rate of labor
force expansion for several years, based on declining birth rates
in the 1960s and early 1970s.
   And a big part of the full percentage point drop in a jobless
rate that stood at 6.6 percent in March 1987 was the fact that the
number of new jobs last year climbed by 3 million while the labor
force grew by only 2 million.
   ``Although women are continuing to enter the labor force in
large numbers, the rate of their increase has slowed,'' Labor
Statistics Commissioner Janet L. Norwood told the Joint Economic
Committee of Congress on Friday. ``The dramatic surge of women in
the labor force took place in the 1960s and 1970s.''
   While the lower unemployment rates are raising fears of renewed
inflation among some economists, there certainly was no evidence of
it on the wage front last month.
   Average wages in private industry rose just 2 cents an hour in
March to $9.20, just 3 percent above what they were a year earlier.
Consumer prices, meanwhile, have risen 3.9 percent in the same
period.
   ``The experience in the 1980s clearly shows that full employment
and a falling inflation rate are not incompatible,'' said Richard
Rahn, chief economist for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. ``We have
reached the lowest unemployment rate in a decade without stoking
the fires of inflation.''
   Except for May 1979, when joblessness also was 5.6 percent,
March's rate is actually the lowest it has been since August 1974.
   Reagan administration officials were quick to pounce on the
figures to bolster their opposition to union-sought provisions in a
trade bill that would require companies to give workers 60 days
advance notice of layoffs.
   ``Sixty-four straight months of job creation and nearly 16
million new jobs is the product of a vibrant, innovative and
entrepreneurial economy,'' said Labor Secretary Ann McLaughlin.
``Now is not the time to put on the brakes with anti-competitive,
anti-growth federal mandates on business.''
   Despite the fewer number of Americans at work, employer payrolls
showed an increase f 262,000 new jobs in March, according to a
separate survey by the department.
   Ms. Norwood explained that the payroll survey and the household
survey from which the unemployment rate is calculated have moved in
opposite directions before.
   ``Over the long run, however, the two surveys generally show
similar trends,'' she said, adding that the payroll survey is
probably a better indicator of what actually occured in March.
   But the news on the payroll survey wasn't entirely good either.
Factory jobs, after rising an average 40,000 each month since last
summer, fell by 1,000 in March, with small declines spread over 11
major industries.
   Of the new payroll jobs, 85,000 were in business and health care
services with another 80,000 in construction.

   In happier times, she planted flowers for
the anniversary and directed tours of the small motel where Martin
Luther King Jr. died.
   But now, in the 20th year after his death, Jacqueline Smith
huddles on a sidewalk, wraps herself in plastic to keep off the
rain and tells anyone who'll listen how the slain civil rights
leader would not like plans to make The Lorraine Motel a museum.
   Miss Smith, 37, lived and worked at The Lorraine for 11 years
and helped organize annual gatherings there on the anniversary of
King's death.
   ``We would clean up and plant flowers, and how the crowd was
handled was up to me,'' she said.
   But Miss Smith was evicted March 2 and has no official role in
ceremonies set Monday for the 20th anniversary of King's death.
   ``I feel sad,'' she said. ``I'll miss talking with the people as
they go in the room.''
   Participants in memorial programs for the King anniversary plan
a march through town, ending at The Lorraine. After a wreath-laying
ceremony there, a combination march and motorcade billed as a
``poor peoples' pilgrimage'' will be launched from the motel for a
trek through Mississippi, Alabama and Georgia.
   The Lorraine, where King was staying while helping lead a
Memphis sanitation workers' strike, is to become a civil rights
museum.
   For past anniversaries, visitors could go to the room where King
stayed. Over the years, motel employees built a makeshift shrine in
the room.
   State officials closed The Lorraine in January and put a
chain-link fence around it, saying it was unsafe for habitation.
Miss Smith stayed on.
   After her forced eviction, she set up housekeeping on the
sidewalk.
   The motel is in a downtown district of warehouses and low-rent
apartments, but developers have begun in recent years to upgrade
property in the area in hopes of attracting middle-income renters.
   Miss Smith claims the $8.8 million museum will speed the
gentrification of the neighborhood.
   ``Dr. King would not want the poor people displaced,'' she said.
   The project for The Lorraine museum, financed by the state and
local governments, is largely due to the work of a citizens' group
which raised $140,000 to buy the motel at a foreclosure auction.
The museum is scheduled to open in 1991.
   D'Army Bailey, a Memphis lawyer and a prime mover behind the
project, said museum visitors will be surrounded by pictures and
sounds of civil rights marches of the 1960s.
   ``The museum will take you back to those times and do all we can
to recreate those feelings, the tensions of the moment,'' he said.
``When people come in and spend an hour or two and then walk out, I
think and hope that what walks out is going to be affected and
changed.''
   Bailey said it has taken almost 20 years for local government to
realize that The Lorraine should be preserved as an integral though
painful part of Memphis history.

<HEAD>Democratic Chorus: Meese Should Resign</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JILL LAWRENCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis adopted a new populist stand
Friday in a drive to win blue collar support in Wisconsin's primary
while the Democratic presidential candidates in a chorus called on
Attorney General Edwin Meese III to resign.
   The four Democrats kept up hectic schedules despite the Passover
and Easter observances this weekend, mindful of the 81 delegates at
stake Tuesday in Wisconsin.
   Dukakis and Jesse Jackson each held farm rallies. Jackson
attracted more than 2,500 farmers and their families to his event
on Bud and Faye Lee's farm near Amery, in northern Wisconsin.
Jackson told the farmers they deserve fair prices for their
products ``and workers deserve fair wages and the rich must pay
fair taxes.'' He said people could afford to pay a little more for
milk, bread and ice cream to make sure farmers got their due.
   Sens. Albert Gore Jr. of Tennessee and Paul Simon of Illinois
joined Dukakis and Jackson in demanding that Meese resign.
   ``As a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, today we are
asking Ed Meese to resign,'' Simon said at a breakfast speech in
Superior.
   ``It's time in this nation to restore respect for government, to
establish rule of law,'' Gore said in the same town.
   Dukakis blamed Meese's Justice Department for allowing the
``merger mania'' he said has cost a half million jobs.
   ``We've got an attorney general who couldn't tell the difference
between antitrust and antifreeze, an antitrust division that hasn't
been heard from in years,'' Dukakis told a labor audience in
Racine. ``The Japanese must be laughing at us all the way to the
bank.''
   The furor over Meese's troubles erupted again Friday when
independent counsel James C. McKay announced there was no evidence
``developed to date'' to warrant a criminal indictment against the
attorney general in connection with an Iraq-Jordan pipeline plan or
his investment in telephone company stock. McKay said the probe was
continuing.
   Dukakis' speeches and a new television ad that started airing
Friday demonstrated the governor's shift to a more emotional
approach drawing on the economic populism theme developed by Rep.
Richard Gephardt, who dropped out of the race Monday.
   ``The human cost of seven years of Republican indifference is
staggering,'' Dukakis says in the ad as laid-off workers, homeless
people, unemployment lines and ``factory closed'' signs roll by the
screen. ``Who in this administration could look right into the eyes
of the laid-off factory worker or the homeless family and say
they've kept the promise of America? I say they've broken that
promise.''
   Gephardt said on syndicated television program ``One on One''
that he didn't mind the heavy borrowing from his campaign.
``Everybody has stolen it,'' he said. ``I willed it everybody when
I pulled out and I hope they will use it. It is the issue of this
campaign.''
   Gore, who has been outspoken in criticism of Jackson this week,
said again that Jackson's race doesn't entitle him to kid-glove
treatment.
   ``An end to bigotry does not mean some candidates are game for
criticism and some are immune,'' Gore said.
   In Washington, House Democratic Leader Tom Foley said Jackson
will be subjected to increased scrutiny now that he is a
front-runner. ``I think he would welcome that,'' Foley said. ``The
question that remains for the Jackson campaign is whether he is
electable in the fall.''
   Foley said decisions by himself and others to withhold an
endorsement at this point should not be interpreted as a
stop-Jackson signal.
   ``There is a little bit of a sense that if you are neutral, you
are getting in the way of Jesse Jackson,'' he said. ``That's
unfair.''
   Colorado, with caucuses on Monday night, was drawing some
politcal attention this weekend, including on the dormant
Republican side.
   Pat Robertson, who has all but conceded the nomination to George
Bush, scheduled three days of activities in Colorado including
talks at four Easter Sunday services. He has said he is determined
to go to the GOP convention in August with a block of delegates to
influence the party platform and Bush's choice of a running mate.
   Jackson and Dukakis also planned some activities this weekend in
Colorado. But the Democrats were focused mainly on Wisconsin and
the two industrial-state primaries that follow later this month:
New York and Pennsylvania.
   Gore spokesman Mark Armour said the campaign has had
fund-raising surge that will allow Gore to conduct a $1
million-plus campaign for New York's April 19 primary without
taking out any new loans.

   A prosecutor running for judge in racially
troubled Robeson County on Friday asked the governor not to call a
special legislative session to let a minority candidate enter the
race after the slaying of a Lumbee Indian contender.
   District Attorney Joe Freeman Britt declared himself the
Democratic nominee for Superior Court judge. Britt, who is white
and would have faced Julian Pierce in the May 3 Democratic primary,
would automatically win the judgeship in November because there is
no Republican candidate.
   Britt met privately for an hour with Gov. Jim Martin a day after
supporters of Pierce asked the Republican governor for the special
session. Britt had no comment afterward except to say, ``You will
have to get your information from the governor's office.''
   Martin's chief of staff, Phil Kirk, said Britt had met with the
governor at Martin's request and had spoken ``very firmly'' against
a special session.
   ``He considers himself to be the nominee of the Democratic Party
for the ... judgeship,'' Kirk told reporters.
   Martin said he remained undecided and would discuss the matter
with advisers and legislators over the weekend. He said he hoped to
make a decision early next week.
   Pierce was shot to death last week in what authorities described
at first as a probable assassination. On Tuesday, they arrested a
young man and said a second suspect committed suicide, and
attributed Pierce's murder to a domestic dispute.
   Under state law, if a candidate dies more than 30 days after
filing for a primary has closed, his opponent wins. Pierce's
supporters want the law amended to allow a replacement candidate.
   The judgeship is one of nine created last year in districts
designed to enhance minorities' prospects for winning.
   Britt's supporters suggested that Britt was a minority candidate
since blacks and Indians make up 58 percent of the registered
voters in Robeson County, Kirk said. But he said that argument
``doesn't hold water'' because the Legislature intended for whites
to be outnumbered in the new districts.
   ``That's why they were created that way, to give minorities an
excellent chance to be elected,'' Kirk said.

<TEXT>
   The support price for 1988-crop honey will
average 59.1 cents per pound, down 6 percent from last year's
level, Agriculture Secretary Richard E. Lyng announced Friday.
   Actual honey support prices will vary between about 48 cents to
62 cents per pound, depending on the color or class of honey
offered by producers, Lyng said. The price supports will be carried
out through loans on honey stored on or off the farm.
   Under the 1985 farm law, honey supports are being gradually
reduced. Last year's average loan rate was 63 cents per pound and
the 1986 rate was 64 cents.
   Lyng also said the 1988 program will retain the ``marketing
loan'' provision to help reduce inventories held as surplus by the
department's Commodity Credit Corp.
   In earlier years, producers could redeem their honey only by
paying off the full amount of the CCC loan, plus interest. They had
the option of not repaying the loan at all, allowing CCC to assume
ownership of the honey which had been offered as collateral.
   Consequently, because of large supplies and low market prices,
CCC inventories of forfeited honey increased rapidly.
   But since the 1985 law, a honey producer can take out a loan and
then repay it at the prevailing market rate. In effect, this allows
the beekeeper to sell honey to the government at a specified price
and then buy it back at a lower price.
   Currently, producers who obtained price support loans averaging
63 cents per pound for 1987 honey can pay off the loans at 34 to 40
cents per pound, depending on quality.
   Lyng said the lower buy-back rates ``will be established at
levels that will minimize loan forfeitures, reduce honey stocks and
storage costs, and maintain the competitiveness of domestic honey
in U.S. and export markets.''

   The seventh National Conference on
Humor opened on April Fool's Day without so much as a gag,
practical joke or even a hint of buffoonery.
   The 70-odd scholars gathered Friday at Purdue University to
dissect the fragile body of humor. These humor anatomists
specialize in the brain more than the funnybone.
   ``This is serious business,'' said Purdue linguist Victor
Raskin, the conference chairman.
   How serious? Well, have you heard the one about, ``The Effects
of a Silent or Laughing Confederate and the Amplification or
Inhibition of Facial Reactions on Cartoon Funniness Evaluation?''
   Ball State University researchers Lambert Deckers and Daniel
Moore planned to deliver a paper on that topic during the three-day
conference.
   ``You don't have to be funny while you're presenting a paper,''
Raskin said.
   He knows the public is puzzled by the paradox of
``excrutiatingly boring'' research on a topic that is mirth itself.
   He learned that lesson the hard way, ducking ripe tomatoes and
rotten eggs hurled by the media after the first conference in the
1970s at Arizona State University.
   ``The media decided that the humor conference was supposed to be
hilarious,'' he said ruefully. ``So there was a full page report in
Time magazine on how boring it was, complete with a couple of
pictures of back-benchers dozing off during presentations.
   ``Well, we learned our lesson,'' he said.
   At the five conferences that followed at Arizona State,
reporters were invited to cover sessions featuring humorists and
dynamic public speakers, while the real work was carried out in
back rooms, he said.
   ``The media on the whole have been very happy with those
conferences ever since,'' he said.
   There is something funny going on here, though. The meeting is
called the WHIM conference, that's for Western Humor and Irony
Membership.
   And, for those not celebrating Passover on Friday night, the
program guide promised seating for ``an indefinite number of
people'' at a beer and pizza place down the block. On Sunday night,
a three-hour joke-telling contest was scheduled.
   But why do these academics _ linguists, psychologists,
anthropologists and sociologists _ do it?
   Raskin's answer is basically, ``Why not?''
   ``It's an important natural phenomenon,'' he said. ``It's a
human faculty, and we study all the other faculties. We study the
mind, we study emotions, we study our health and behavior. And
humor is part of all that.''
   While a comedian knows which material works, the professors want
to know why.
   ``You don't expect a gymnast or a figure skater to come up with
a scientific explanation on their failures or successes,'' said
Raskin. ``That's what we are for. We're trying to figure out what
makes humor work.
   ``I know of no reseachers who have any ambition to become
stand-up comedians,'' he said. ``Most of us are professors, and we
use a lot of humor in the classroom. But that's a matter of
survival. If you don't, the students doze off on you and this is
reflected in your teacher evaluations and salary raises.''

<HEAD>Government Sues Meatpacker on Overtime Pay</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MATT YANCEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Labor Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government sued the nation's second
largest meatpacker Friday on a claim that it cheated tens of
thousands of workers out of millions of dollars in overtime pay at
10 packinghouses in Kansas, Iowa, Nebraska, Minnesota and Idaho.
   In a suit filed in Kansas City, Kan., the Labor Department
accused IBP Corp. of ``repeatedly and willfully'' violating laws
requiring employers to pay hourly workers one and one-half times
the normal wage for work beyond 40 hours a week.
   The suit seeks what the government claims is unpaid overtime
plus interest stretching back to April 1985 for between 20,000 and
70,000 current and former employees of the company.
   Government officials refused to specify how much the sought
damages might total, but one acknowledged that it will likely be in
the tens of millions of dollars.
   Attorneys for the United Food and Commercial Workers Union,
which is trying to organize some of the plants and initiated the
Labor Department's action, calculated the possible back pay awards
at between $20 million and $43 million.
   The suit is based on allegations that IBP workers were required
by the company to spend up to two hours a week putting on, taking
off and cleaning safety equipment and maintaining knives without
being paid for their labor.
   Based on hourly wages in the industry averaging $6 an hour, and
assuming each worker was denied about two hours of overtime a week,
the union calculated that each worker may be owed as much as $3,744
in back pay.
   Full-time employment at the 10 plants is slightly less than
9,000 according to company officials. However, meatpacking has one
of the highest job turnover rates of any industry in the country _
estimated by some at as much as 80 percent annually.
   Gary Mickelson, an IBP spokesman, said the company is
``confident the courts will find our policies entirely acceptable
and lawful.''
   He said IBP follows the same wage practices with regard to
maintaining safety equipment at its three unionized plants and its
11 non-union packinghouses. None of the unionized plants was
mentioned in the suit.
   ``It's the same procedure industrywide,'' Mickelson said. ``The
unions have negotiated away what the Labor Department thinks we
should be paying.''
   ``We find this action ironic,'' he added. ``On one hand our
company has been widely criticized as not doing enough to ensure
the safety of our employees. Now we're being sued for making sure
our employees take the time to wear the equipment necessary to
protect them on the job.''
   Last summer the Labor Department fined IBP $2.6 million for
alleged job safety and record violations at its flagship
packinghouse at Dakota City, Neb.
   The investigation leading up to that fine, which has been
appealed by the company, was prompted by another complaint that the
union filed with the government while engaged in a strike at the
Dakota City plant.
   The suit Friday alleged the wage law violations occurred at IBP
plants in Emporia and Holcomb, Kan.; Madison and West Point, Neb.;
Luverne, Minn.; Denison, Storm Lake, Council Bluffs and Columbus
Junction, Iowa; and Boise, Idaho.

<HEAD>Orchestra Cancels Season, Ballet Troupe Collapses In Chicago</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRENDA C. COLEMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The city's No. 2 symphony orchestra is canceling
the rest of its 1988 concert season because of money troubles, only
months after Chicago's ballet company disintegrated.
   The Orchestra of Illinois, a highly praised group observing its
10th anniversary this season, announced Thursday it is canceling
its remaining seven performances because of a $410,000 deficit in
its $650,000 budget.
   ``The situation is very serious,'' Linda G. Moore, the
orchestra's executive director, said in a Chicago Tribune
interview. ``Our cash-flow position has been bad for some time, and
it has gotten to the point where we literally don't have enough
money to pay our musicians.''
   Just four months earlier, the Chicago City Ballet, the city's
only classical ballet troupe, collapsed following an internal
dispute over artistic directorship that alienated its chief
financial supporter.
   But the two groups' failures do not necessarily cast a pall over
the performing arts in general, observers say.
   ``One organization's problems do not necessarily reflect the
community,'' said Matthew Raphaelson, director of the Chicago Music
Alliance, a service organization comprising 15 orchestras and
dozens of other music groups such as operas and chamber music
companies.
   ``We have 86 member organizations ... and many of them are doing
quite well,'' said Raphaelson. ``Many are having their best years.''
   The city also has been supporting 28 performing companies,
including the now-defunct Chicago City Ballet, said Lisa Tylke,
executive director of the Chicago Dance Arts Coalition, another
service organization.
   Dancers who lost jobs at Chicago City Ballet have followed its
former artistic director, Daniel Duell, in an attempt ``to rise
from the ashes'' with a new classical troupe called Ballet Chicago,
Ms. Tylke said.
   The troupe has given one fundraising performance in its own
behalf and is practicing for another in May.
   Gregory Mansfield, spokesman for the Illinois Arts Council, a
state agency that poured $2.2 million into performing arts last
year, said the failures of the orchestra and the ballet are the
only ones he is aware of in the state this year.
   Those failures may end up as springboards to healthier
organizations, he said.
   The Orchestra of Illinois has a record of artistic excellence
and could resolve its problems, he said. The orchestra's board has
ordered outside experts to analyze its financial affairs to see
what can be done, he said.
   ``The arts council feels that by stopping to re-evaluate, an
arts organization can often emerge actually better,'' Mansfield
said. ``And there are hundreds of arts organizations in Chicago
that are doing quite well, and I'm speaking of performing arts.''
   Raphaelson said setbacks for performing groups seem to generate
more fear than problems with business organizations.
   ``When it happens in the arts community, people seem to get more
nervous than if it were soft drinks or crackers,'' he said.
   He speculated that the reason is that arts groups depend more on
fund raising and benefactors, who may be unduly frightened by
negative signs.
   ``The solution, obviously, (for arts advocates) is to be ever
more outspoken in their support for the arts,'' he said. ``If that
fear is the reality, the problem is not so much a problem in the
industry as a problem of perception.''

   The United States and Spanish governments have
agreed to eliminate duplicate coverage and taxation under the two
countries' Social Security systems, Social Security Commissioner
Dorcas R. Hardy announced Friday.
   Many U.S. citizens working in Spain for U.S employers now pay
Social Security contributions to both countries for the same work,
and the same applies to many Spanish nationals working in the
United States.
   Elimination of the overlapping requirements was effective Friday.
   Similar agreements were already in effect with Belgium, Canada,
Italy, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, the United Kingdom and West
Germany. Agreements have been signed with France and the
Netherlands and are expected to become effective later this year.

   Fifty-five percent of those questioned said
Attorney General Edwin Meese III should resign his post, according
to a U.S. News & World Report poll released Friday.
   Only 21 percent of the respondents said Meese should stay in
office, the magazine said.
   Fifty percent of those who considered themselves politically
conservative said Meese should quit, while only 27 percent of all
conservatives believed he should stay, the magazine said.
   Forty-six percent of Republicans said Meese should go, compared
with only 28 percent who said he should continue. Sixty-one percent
of all Democrats and 54 percent of all independents should Meese
should quit.
   Meese, who has been under criminal investigation for 11 months,
has been under pressure in Congress this week to quit since two top
aides left the Justice Department. The aides said Meese's
continuing legal problems were hurting the department's operations
and image.
   The nationwide telephone poll of 1,004 adults, conducted by The
Roper Organization on Wednesday and Thursday, has a margin of error
of plus or minus four percentage points.

<HEAD>Air Force Rewrites Contracts, Cutting Almost $1 Billion</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Air Force on Friday rewrote its contracts
covering development of the new Midgetman mobile nuclear missile,
canceling almost $1 billion worth of work planned by six
contractors.
   The service, in a brief statement, stressed it could not speak
for the six contractors involved but estimated the cutbacks could
affect the jobs of as many as 2,300 private-sector employees.
   The Air Force action became inevitable several months ago when
Defense Secretary Frank C. Carlucci decided the Pentagon could not
afford to develop and deploy the single-warhead Midgetman within
the budget levels set by the White House and Congress.
   The Air Force had recommended Carlucci kill the program
outright, but the defense secretary decided to request $200 million
in fiscal 1989 to keep the program alive pending a final decision
by the next president.
   The House Armed Services Committee, a major proponent of the new
weapon, has already voted to increase that figure to $500 million
in fiscal 1989. Even if that figure is approved, however, the Air
Force said it would not have enough money to sustain the program on
its original schedule, leaving no choice but to rewrite the seven
major development contracts held by the six firms.
   In order for the program to adhere to its original schedule, the
Air Force would have needed about $2.2 billion this year and
another $2.2 billion in fiscal 1989. Congress provided $700 million
for the Midgetman this fiscal year.
   The biggest loser as a result of Friday's action was the
Rockwell International Corp. Its Autonetics Division had a $484.2
million prime development contract for the missile's guidance and
control system that was slashed by $374 million to $110.2 million.
   The other losers included:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   _Boeing Aerospace Co., under contract to develop the missile's
mobile launcher, cut $278 million to a new total of $313.6 million.
   _Martin Marietta Corp. It had two contracts, one to provide
support and assembly services and the other to develop the
warhead's ``post-boost vehicle and shroud.'' The first contract was
cut $47 million to a new total of $76.9 million, while the second
was cut $100 million to a new total of $244.5 million.
   _Aerojet Nevada Rocket Operations, developer of the Stage 2
booster for the missile, cut $77 million to a new total of $103.7.
   _Hercules Inc., developer of the Stage 3 booster, cut $72
million to a new total of $97.7 million.
   _Morton Thiokol, developer of the Stage 1 booster, cut $51
million to a new total of $74.9 million.
   When all the reductions are added, they total $999 million, the
Air Force said.

<TEXT>
   Republican presidential candidate Pat Robertson is
spending Easter weekend in Colorado trying to drum up support for
his dormant campaign.
   ``He will be making an appearance, encouraging people to go
vote'' in Colorado's caucuses on Monday night, Robertson state
campaign coordinator David Nelson said Friday.
   Robertson has conceded that he has virtually no chance of
winning the Republican nomination. But he plans to stay in the race
in hopes he can influence the GOP platform that will be drawn up at
the national convention.
   ``He wants to represent conservatives and Christians in the
formation of the platform so we can have a voice,'' Nelson said.
   In Colorado, Nelson hopes Robertson can win one-third to
one-half of the state's 36 GOP delegates.
   He said up to 10 phone bank operators are trying to persuade at
least 10,000 people to show up for the caucuses. ``Our goal would
be to have 15,000,'' he said.
   The former television evangelist's only strong showings have
come in caucus states, where organization and depth of support
count.
   Robertson's three-day schedule here includes talks to an
estimated 5,000 people in four Denver-area congregations on Easter
Sunday.
   Robertson summed up his version of the Easter message this way
during a rally in a Virginia Beach, Va., church last weekend:
``...Some of the press have been saying that in terms of my
candidacy that it is dead. What they don't know about is the
resurrection.''
   Nelson said Robertson wouldn't mix church and politics in his
talks, although Robertson's support has been derived primarily from
fundamentalist Christians.
   ``I don't think it's proper to go into a church and say, `Vote
for me.' I believe Pat respects the rules and regulations involving
churches and politics. He will just talk about how important it is
to be involved in the political process,'' he said.

<HEAD>Marion Inmates Ask Appeals Panel To End 4-Year-Old Lockdown</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Attorneys for inmates of the U.S. Penitentiary at
Marion asked an appeals court Friday to end the prison's 4{-year
lockdown, arguing that inmates are suffering physical and
psychological brutality.
   ``Prisoners are chained to their beds, spread-eagle, sometimes
for days at a time,'' attorney Nancy Horgan argued before a
three-judge panel of the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.
   U.S. District Judge James Foreman, who heard the original
class-action lawsuit filed on behalf of Marion inmates, refused
last February to grant an injunction ending the lockdown.
   Foreman's ruling followed a 1985 decision by U.S. Magistrate
Kenneth Meyers that tight security at the prison dubbed the ``new
Alcatraz'' did not constitute cruel and unusual punishment and was
necessary to protect inmates and staff.
   The lockdown was imposed in October 1983, following a bloody
week in which two guards and an inmate were killed in separate
incidents.
   Since then, virtually all 350 inmates at the maximum-security
penitentiary remain locked in 7-by-8-foot cells for 23 hours a day,
although prisoners in certain tiers are given an additional four
hours outside their cell each week.
   Family contact visits aren't allowed. Meals are delivered
through a slot and are eaten by prisoners while sitting on the
floor or on a bed because cells have no chairs or tables.
   Attorneys for the inmates argued Friday that the lockdown has
become a permanent condition of imprisonment, and that Marion
officials use a capricious, arbitrary system in assigning prisoners
to tiers and doling out limited privileges.
   Prison officials counter that the lockdown is necessary because
the prison houses the most unmanageable inmates in the federal
prison system.
   ``Most of them come from the segregation units at other federal
prisons,'' Assistant U.S. Attorney Ralph Friederich told the
judges. ``It is a place for inmates who have demonstrated an
inability to control their conduct at other institutions.''
   Marion was built in 1963. In 1979, it was designated by the
federal Bureau of Prisons as the first Level 6 prison _ the
system's most secure. It remains the only Level 6 institution.
   The roster of high-profile inmates who have been imprisoned
there and several spectacular escape attempts have led to its
comparison to Alcatraz, the fortress island prison in San Francisco
Bay that was closed 25 years ago.
   Before Friday's hearing, about 50 demonstrators marched outside
the federal building in support of the inmates, carrying signs
reading ``Prison System Built on Lies.''
   Stephen Wittman, a spokesman for the Committee to End the Marion
Lockdown, which helped organize the demonstration and has provided
legal and financial support to the legal case, contended the
penitentiary was being used to silence political prisoners.
   ``They keep them as long as (they) can and each time we draw
attention to an individual, they transfer them,'' he said.
   ``Equally important, they hold Marion over the head of all
prisoners in the system,'' Wittman contended. ``They use the
prospect of going to Marion to intimidate them into behaving the
way they want them to.''

<HEAD>Woman Charged In 5-Year-Old's Death Took In 14 Kids Over Years</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TAMPA, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A 5-year-old who had a fractured skull when
he died in January had complained in November of being hit with a
flat board as punishment and asked to leave his foster home,
according to state records.
   Rosa Lee Jones, 40, was charged Wednesday with second-degree
murder and aggravated child abuse in the Jan. 8 death of Albert
Smith. She has not yet been arraigned and was jailed in lieu of
$50,000 bond.
   Police say the boy's skull was fractured when he was struck with
a board for refusing to kneel to say his prayers.
   Over an eight-year period Mrs. Jones was a foster mother to 14
children. In 1986 and 1987 she asked the state for a break, saying
at one point she was ``stressed out,'' records of the state
Department of Health and Rehabilitative Services show.
   Before licensing Mrs. Jones, a state worker had only one
reservation, about the woman's membership in the fundamentalist
Holiness faith.
   ``Mrs. Jones' religion is obviously very important to her and
she might border on being somewhat fanatical,'' licensing analyst
Salley Caro wrote in her study, The Tampa Tribune reported Friday.
   ``She may tend to be a little rigid in some areas because she is
a devout member of a fundamentalist religion. However, I do not
feel that she will be unreasonable in her expectations of the
children.''
   The first placement in February 1980, a 13-year-old girl, left
seven months later after she complained of being whipped with a
belt.
   After a warning about corporal punishment, which is against HRS
rules, Mrs. Jones took 13 more children over the next seven years.
   Mrs. Jones nursed the sores of a neglected boy, adopted three
foster children, and accepted as many as seven children in her home
at once, including mentally impaired children.
   HRS workers reported no problems in annual reviews of her home,
called ``the cleanest home that has ever been seen'' by one worker.
   By January 1986, Mrs. Jones told state workers she needed a
break from foster parenting and asked that no more children be
placed in her home, HRS records show. She had three adopted
children and was caring for two foster children.
   Two more were placed but by June 1987 the home was returned to
its scheduled capacity of five.
   Three months later, a caller reportedly said Mrs. Jones was
abusing Albert Smith.
   The boy tearfully told social workers he had been spanked with a
board or a belt. But no marks were found, making it more a
discipline problem than abuse, said Joseph Tagliarini, HRS
administrator for Hillsborough County.
   Albert's school bus driver told HRS workers the child had
started crying when he got close to Jones' home.
   Mrs. Jones denied she hit Albert, but admitted she was
``stressed out'' and asked to have her foster home closed.
   Social workers were working hard to keep Albert and his little
brother together. They had no other foster homes available when
Albert asked to leave in November, records show.
   Mrs. Jones agreed to care for the children a little longer.
   ``We try to preserve a (foster care) placement,'' said
Tagliarini. ``Maybe sometimes we try to preserve too much.''

<HEAD>Army Orders Resumption Of Random Drug Testing Of Civilian
Employees</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NORMAN BLACK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Military Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Taking advantage of an appeals court ruling
earlier this week, the Army on Friday ordered a resumption of
random drug testing of civilian employees in certain critical jobs.
   ``The directive went out today,'' said Paige Eversole, an Army
spokeswoman at the Pentagon. ``It orders resumption of the program
effective immediately.''
   The move had been expected since Tuesday, when a federal appeals
court struck down a preliminary injunction that had stopped the
drug-testing program a month ago.
   A three-judge panel of the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said it
was staying the injunction granted to employee unions while it
considered the legal merits of the case.
   The employee unions filed suit to stop a program under which any
civilian worker in a so-called ``critical'' job can be tested at
random for evidence of drug use. About 9,400 Army civilians are
currently subject to the testing because they work in such fields
as security, aviation and law enforcement.
   Men and women on active military duty have long been subject to
random drug testing. The extension of that testing to civilian
workers, however, began only last year.
   On March 1, U.S. District Judge Thomas F. Hogan ruled against
the Army and issued a preliminary injunction to stop the random
testing of civilians, concluding that the practice amounted to an
``excessively intrusive'' search prohibited by the Constitution.
   Hogan said that random checks of employees in sensitive
positions could not be justified by safety concerns, because the
urine test used by the Army did not indicate whether an employee
was using drugs on the job.
   The suit challenging the Army was brought by public employee
unions representing civilian Army employees at Fort Stewart, Fla.;
Aberdeen Proving Ground, Md.; and the Sharp Army Depot in Lathrop,
Calif.
   The unions have vowed to pursue their challenge. No date has
been set as yet for the appeals court to hear arguments in the case.

<TEXT>
   Television reporters, angered by the live telecast
of a soccer match during a journalists' strike, staged a
retaliatory walkout Friday that halted all newscasts by the
state-controlled RAI network.
   The National Journalists Union backed the 24-hour blackout of
televised news, calling RAI's behavior ``a severe attack against
the right to strike.''
   RAI telecast the exhibition soccer match between the national
teams of Italy and Yugoslavia on Thursday night, reportedly bowing
to pressure from sponsors who had invested about $300,000 in
advertising at the Yugoslav stadium.
   The telecast was without comment and viewers could hear only the
crowd noise.
   ``Ninety minutes of mute soccer on television,'' wrote the Milan
newspaper Corriere della Sera in a front-page story critical of
RAI's decision.
   Italian press and television journalists have been striking on
and off for weeks to protest a breakdown in negotiations for a new
labor contract.
   Italy's major newspapers will not print Saturday because of the
continuing strikes.

<HEAD>Fed Policymakers Voted to Push Down Interest Rates Two Months Ago</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARTIN CRUTSINGER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Top policymakers at the Federal Reserve, faced
with a weakening economy, decided to push interest rates slightly
lower in late January and early February, according to minutes
released Friday.
   The minutes of the February meeting of the Federal Open Market
Committee confirmed comments Federal Reserve Chairman Alan
Greenspan made to Congress on Feb. 23 that the Fed had eased its
grip on credit in an effort to stimulate economic growth at the
beginning of the year.
   Partly in response to that easing move, a variety of interest
rates, including mortgage rates, fell by more than one-half
percentage point. Major banks lowered their prime lending rate on
Feb. 2 to 8.5 percent, the lowest level for this benchmark interest
rate since mid-1986.
   The minutes of the Feb. 9-10 meeting said the slight easing move
was taken because of concerns at the time about a slowdown in
business activity.
   The Fed had moved immediately following the Oct. 19 collapse of
the stock market to push interest rates lower in an effort to keep
the economy out of a recession. But then in December had begun
tightening slightly out of fears that too much money in the economy
would threaten higher inflation later in 1988.
   The Fed minutes said the central bank believed it had room to
lower interest rates further because the dollar's value had
stabilized on foreign exchange markets after falling sharply at the
end of 1987.
   The minutes said the slight easing occurred in late January and
early February, prior to the February meeting. At that meeting, Fed
officials decided to leave policy unchanged.
   The Open Market Committee met again Tuesday and officials said
they believed that the central bank once again decided to make no
changes to monetary policy in light of the fact that the economy
has been showing surprising strength in recent months.
   The Labor Department reported Friday that the civilian
unemployment rate fell to an eight-year low of 5.6 percent in
March, down from 5.7 percent in February.
   Greenspan, in recent comments, has said he doubts the jobless
rate can fall much farther without threatening a round of renewed
inflation.
   Because of these statements, many economists believe the Fed
will not ease further for the rest of the year unless the economy
takes an unexpected turn for the worse.
   The committee minutes said that for the period before the March
meeting, the central bank would seek to ``maintain the slightly
reduced degree of pressure on (bank) reserve positions sought in
recent days.''
   The Fed influences interest rates through its control over how
much money banks have on hand. By increasing bank reserves, the Fed
increases the amount of money banks have to lend and thus drives
down the cost of that money.
   ``The members were in broad agreement that any substantial
change in policy, in either direction, was not warranted under
prevailing economic and financial conditions,'' the minutes said.
   The Fed decision was approved on an 11-0 vote. There is one
vacancy on the Fed board.
   The February meeting also sets monetary targets for the year and
the committee voted unanimously for growth targets of 4 percent to
8 percent for two broader measures of the money supply known as M-2
and M-3. These targets were revealed by Greenspan during his
congressional testimony.
   M-2 actually grew only 4 percent in 1987, substantially below
the low point of the Fed's target of 5.5 percent growth for last
year. That event had spurred some Reagan administration officials
to complain that the central bank was not doing enough to keep the
5-year-old economic recovery alive.
   However, after Greenspan publicly complained about pressure from
the administration, the critics, including Beryl Sprinkel, chairman
of the president's Council of Economic Advisers have been silent in
recent weeks.

   NASA flight medals honoring the seven astronauts
who died in the Challenger explosion more than two years ago were
given Friday to their families.
   The presentations were made during a ceremony a day after
hundreds of people gathered at a celebrity-packed tribute and
fund-raiser for the Challenger Center for Space Education.
   June Scobee, widow of Challenger commander Dick Scobee, said it
would have been a ``tremendous moment'' for the astronauts if they
had lived to receive the flight medals, along with framed
certificates acknowledging work in the space program.
   ``Their proudest moment was to be known as one of you (NASA),''
Mrs. Scobee said, choking back tears.
   ``We want to thank you,'' she added.
   ``The dream is alive,'' Mrs. Scobee said, apparently in
reference to the challenger center project. ``And it's becoming not
only a dream, but a reality.''
   Conceived and developed by family members of the crew, the
educational center will offer teachers and students the opportunity
to learn about space by participating in simulated space flights
and missions at the flagship center in Washington, D.C., and at
satellite learning centers around the country.
   Some $2.5 million has been raised for the center since the
Challenger explosion Jan. 28, 1986, when all seven astronauts died.
   Daniel C. Brandenstein, chief of the astronaut office at NASA's
Johnson Space Center, said the medals are given to those who have
``made significant contributions to the manned space program.''
   Those appearing Thursday night were The Fabulous Thunderbirds,
Melba Moore, Pia Zadora, Brooke Shields, actor Michael York, The
Houston Pops, and Michael Maguire and Brandy Brown, who are
starring on Broadway's ``Les Miserables.''

   American adults are expected to reduce their
cigarette consumption again this year after a 2 percent drop in
1987, the Agriculture Department said Friday.
   ``Domestic cigarette consumption is likely to decline this year
because of further price hikes, continued anti-smoking activity and
increased restrictions on where people can smoke,'' the
department's Economic Research Service said in a report.
   American adults consumed an average 3,201 cigarettes last year,
down from 3,274 in 1986, according to the preliminary figures. That
was the lowest since World War II. The peak was 4,345 cigarettes
per person in 1963.
   Officials caution that the per capita figures measure the
average ``disappearance'' of cigarettes among those 18 years and
older, including smokers and non-smokers alike. It is used to show
changes from one year to another and does not indicate actual use
among the smoking population.

   A military school student was hunted down
and held at gunpoint by neighbors convinced he had kidnapped a
4-year-old girl, officials said.
   Kenneth Widel Jr., 21, was jailed on a kidnapping charge and
released Friday on $2,500 bail. He said the child was going to show
him where an old girlfriend of his lived in a subdivision near
Orlando.
   Widel, a senior at The Citadel in South Carolina, was tracked
down Wednesday night by neighbors who were alerted by a 5-year-old
friend of the little girl. Widel's car was spotted, and a neighbor
stopped it and forced Widel to step out. The girl ran home.
   ``If words could kill, that guy would be dead,'' said the girl's
mother, Carolyn John-Nurse. ``When I was cussing him out, he said,
`I'm sorry, ma'm. I'm sorry, ma'm. I was just getting ready to
bring her back.'''
   Widel's attorney, Dan Perry, said Widel told his mother he had
six beers when he drove to Hunter's Creek to look for a woman he
knew only as Samantha. Widel stopped to ask whether the little girl
or her friend, Rachel Anne Newhart, 5, knew Samantha.
   The lawyer said the little girl told Widel she knew where
Samantha lived and volunteered to show him. She got into Widel's
car, and the other girl ran off, Perry said.
   After a while, according to Widel, the little girl decided she
wanted to go home. Widel took her back, and a band of neighbors
confronted him at gunpoint and accused him of being a child
molester, Perry said.
   ``It was a simple misunderstanding that I can understand,'' the
lawyer said. ``He obviously exercised poor judgment. He's a good
kid.''
   Deputies believed Rachel, a youngster with ``exceptional''
presence of mind, sheriff's spokesman Randy Means said Thursday.
She told her mother Widel yanked the little girl into the car.
   ``There is no reason to doubt the 5-year-old's story. It is
pretty much corroborated by the other little girl and neighbors who
were around,'' sheriff's spokesman Jim Solomons said. ``She
apparently didn't get in the car willingly.''
   Widel told police he didn't know Samantha's last name. Solomons
said no one named Samantha has come forward to substantiate Widel's
story.
   Widel, who is 45 days from receiving a degree in electrical
engineering, was on full scholarship until recently, said officials
at The Citadel, who refused to give out any other information.
   Widel's mother, Carol Widel of Kissimmee, said her son lost his
scholarship when his grades dropped.
   Of his arrest, she said, ``This is so far out of the ordinary
that I don't know what to think. ... I'm utterly dismayed. He has a
lot to contribute to society.''
   Solomons said no neighbors would be charged. ``You can't condone
it, but you can't condemn'' what they did, he said. ``It apparently
was the right thing to do in this case. It's not illegal to have a
firearm, and this guy stopped a first-degree felony.''

   Iran said Friday a new Iraqi chemical
bomb attack on Kurdish villages killed 75 people and wounded more
than 100. It also said it accepted a U.N. call for a halt in the
deadly ``war of the cities.''
   The Iranians claim 5,000 civilians were killed and the same
number wounded in gas attacks two weeks ago.
   The official Islamic Republic News Agency, monitored in Cyprus,
reported that Iran earlier fired fired seven missiles into Kirkuk,
Iraq's northern oil capital and Basra, a southern port city. Iraq
said many civilians were killed or wounded in Kirkuk.
   No Iraqi missile firings were reported. Iraq said Thursday it
would suspend attacks on Iranian cities for three days, beginning
at midnight, while Prime Minister Turgut Ozal of Turkey is visiting
Baghdad.
   Turkey has good relations with both Iran and Iraq, which have
been at war since September 1980, and Ozal has tried to mediate.
   Tehran radio said Friday that U.N. Secretary-General Javier
Perez de Cuellar asked Iran to stop attacking residential areas in
Iraq. The request came in a meeting in New York with Iran's acting
U.N. ambassador, Mohammad Ja'afar Mahallati, said the radio,
monitored by the British Broadcasting Corp.
   It quoted Mahallati as saying: ``In line with our usual policy,
Iran accepts this request. However, true to its usual ways, Iraq
will renew these attacks. Therefore, the U.N. secretary-general
must not confine himself to a mere request.''
   The statement appeared to represent a call for U.N. action to
force Iraq to end its attacks.
   Associated Press photographer Greg English reported from
Kurdistan that Iran's Revolutionary Guards were pushing westward
into the strategic region of Iraq as part of an offensive begun
March 16.
   A dispatch from Iran's Islamic Republic News Agency said Iranian
jet fighters flew seven sorties against Iraqi troop concentrations
in the region Friday, inflicting ``substantial casualties and
losses.''
   IRNA said Iraqi warplanes dropped bombs containing nerve and
mustard gases in the Qara Dagh region of northeast Iraq on March
21-26.
   It quoted sources among Iranian-backed Kurdish guerrillas as
identifying the villages affected as Susiyan, Doukan, Balakha,
Jafaran and Oliyan.
   There was no independent confirmation or comment from Iraq.
   Qara Dagh is 15 miles west of the front in the Kurdistan
mountains.
   Iran claims the thousands of casualties from chemical attacks
were caused March 16-17 in three towns captured by Iranian forces.
   Western correspondents who visited one of the towns, Halabja,
last week reported seeing hundreds of bodies unmarked by bullet or
shrapnel wounds. Hundreds more Iraqi Kurds with severe burns and
respiratory ailments, consistent with exposure to poison gas, have
been seen in Tehran hospitals.
   On Thursday, Iran claimed Iraqi warplanes dropped chemical bombs
on Marivan in northwest Iran, killing civilians.
   IRNA said missiles were fired Friday at Basra and at a
``military target'' in Kirkuk ``in retaliation for Iraqi missile
attacks on Iran's residential areas.''
   Iraq reported only one missile hitting Kirkuk, 80 miles west of
the battle zone in the Kurdistan mountains. The official Iraqi News
Agency said it exploded in a residential district, killing or
wounding ``many civilians, including women and children.''
   More than 250 missiles have been fired by both sides since the
latest ``war of the cities'' began Feb. 29, killing hundreds of
civilians.
   In the Kurdistan campaign, officers of Iranian Revolutionary
Guards said their forces had bottled up 5,000 Iraqi soldiers around
a hydroelectric dam on Lake Darbandikhan, 80 miles east of the
Kirkuk oil fields. The dam and power station provide most of the
region's electricity and some power to Baghdad.
   English, who was with Western correspondents flown to the battle
zone Thursday, quoted Revolutionary Guards commander Asgar Ahmadi
as saying his men were within five miles of the highway between the
provincial capital of Sulaymaniyah and Baghdad, 160 miles to the
southwest.
   Ahmadi claimed Sulaymaniyah was within range of Iranian
artillery.
   Sulaymaniyah, which has a population of 100,000, is northwest of
the Darbandikhan region, where the Iranians said several days ago
they had captured 540 square miles of territory.
   The Iranians claim to have killed or wounded 12,000 Iraqis,
captured more than 4,500 and destroyed more than 200 tanks and
armored vehicles.
   English reported from the Kurdish town of Dojaila, captured on
the second day of the offensive that he could hear artillery fire
to the west and it was clear ``the Iranians have made significant
gains.''

   Here is a transcript of Attorney General Edwin
Meese III's news conference Friday.
   Good afternoon.
   I indicated yesterday, when we were at the FBI, that I would
meet with you in due course.
   And although my time is limited, I know that some of you,
perhaps all of you, are on deadline.
   I did want to make myself available before the end of the week
to take a few questions.
   Before doing so, I would like to announce that early next week,
we will be holding a press conference.
   Terry Eastland will let you know as to the details of that
conference.
   And at that time, I will have with me certain individuals who
will be filling key positions here in the department.
   Now, let me also say that I have been gratified by the action
and the statement issued earlier today by independent counsel James
McKay.
   In addition to that, my attorney, Nathan Lewin, has also
commented on it, and I would refer any questions you might have on
that subject to those two statements and to Mr. Lewin.
   As I have said on many occasions, the purpose of an independent
counsel is to review all allegations that may be outstanding and
that all of us should await the determinations of the independent
counsel.
   For that reason, I would certainly urge that there be no rush to
judgment, but I am gratified by the statement that has been issued
today.
   With that, I'll be glad to answer any questions. Yes?
   Q. Mr. Attorney General, people in and out of the department
have commented that the appearance of propriety is important as
propriety itself. And therefore, that a law enforcement officer who
is under investigation ought to step aside while that investigation
is under way. Can you tell us why you have not stepped aside, and
what message that sends to other law enforcement officers who may
find themselves in a similar position?
   A. Well, the purpose of the independent counsel process is to
enable people to go on about their duties and, at the same time, to
have an independent and fair evaluation of whatever allegations may
be pending.
   That's the process, that is the way it should work, and that's
the way it is working in this case.
   And therefore, there is no reason _ as a matter of fact, if a
person has to step aside merely on the basis of some allegation,
however false, then it would be easy for unscrupulous persons to
make allegations and therefore literally cause people to step aside
and move out of their offices.
   Q. Are Mr. Burns and Mr. Weld unscrupulous persons?
   A. I beg your pardon?
   Q. Are Mr. Burns and Mr. Weld unscrupulous persons?
   A. Are they unscrupulous persons? No.
   Q. Why did Mr. Burns and Mr. Weld resign?
   A. Well, they've already indicated that they are resigning to go
back into private practice.
   Let me say that there were some basic differences as to the
effect that recent events have had on the department.
   And beyond that, I think their resignations are going to have to
speak for themselves.
   Q. Were those recent events the investigations, sir?
   A. I beg your pardon?
   Q. Could you elaborate _
   A. I say, there was a difference as to the impact that recent
events had on the department.
   In part, they were the fact that there is an independent counsel
investigation, yes.

<HEAD>Lebanese Businessman Held Captive Outside London</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Police charged a 31-year-old builder Friday with
conspiracy in the kidnapping of a Lebanese businessman, who escaped
unharmed two days earlier from a rural bungalow where he was held
for 24 hours.
   The kidnappers demanded 5 million Swiss francs ($3.7 million) as
ransom for Ramzi Ata Dalloul, Scotland Yard said. Dalloul, 52, is
head of RAD Projects and Developments, a management consulting firm.
   Dalloul's captors apparently did not know he had escaped and
made ransom calls to the man's home after he was gone, police said.
   Anti-terrorist detectives arrested a man who accompanied Dalloul
to his home in London's fashionable Kensington district Wednesday
night. Derek Stanley Bumbridge, 31, was charged Friday with
conspiring ``with persons unknown'' to kidnap Dalloul and was to
appear in court on Saturday.
   Scotland Yard would not comment on media reports that the man
was Dalloul's only guard and helped in the escape.
   Police said Dalloul believed at least five men were involved,
four Britons and one who spoke Arabic.
   He was seized Tuesday night after his car was rammed on the way
home from his office in London's West End, and driven for about 15
minutes before being bundled into the back of a white van and bound.
   Dalloul was taken to a bungalow in Tenterden, Kent, about 40
miles southeast of London, where he was handcuffed while one man
stood guard.
   The kidnappers telephoned Dalloul's wife, Saeda, late Tuesday
night demanding the ransom and she told Scotland Yard shortly
afterward.
   On Wednesday evening, the kidnappers again contacted Mrs.
Dalloul, repeating their demand and explaining the method of
payment, police said.
   Forty-five minutes later, Dalloul telephoned his wife to say he
had escaped and was on his way home, police said. He turned up
about two hours later.

<TEXT>
   Pope John Paul II, carrying a black wooden cross,
led a torchlight procession at the Colosseum Friday night that
symbolically retraced Christ's walk to his crucifixion.
   Tens of thousands of people gathered to watch the Via Crucis,
the Way of the Cross ritual that ends the saddest day of the Roman
Catholic year.
   John Paul began the walk inside the great arena, where tradition
says ancient Romans threw Christians to the lions. He proceeded up
cobblestone steps and ended on the edge of the Roman Forum, once
the meeting place of Rome's leaders.
   Thousands of people followed the service from behind barricades
marking the pope's path, reading from prayer booklets illuminated
by candlelight. Many added their voices to the chorus that chanted
the service.
   During the walk, John Paul pressed the 5-foot cross, which
weighed only a pound, to his forehead as he marked the 14 Stations
of the Cross that represent the physical torment and mockery Jesus
endured as he walked to his death.
   The stations include the three times Christ fell under the
weight of the cross, the placing of the crown of thorns and
whipping by jailers.
   John Paul, wearing a white skullcap and gold-trimmed cape over a
white cassock, was illuminated at the beginning of the procession
by torches placed in the Colosseum's arches.
   Descriptions of the various stations were read in Italian,
French, English, German, Spanish and Portuguese and in the pope's
native language, Polish.
   Vatican Radio and Italian state-run television carried the event
live. The television said it was transmitted to 27 countries on
five continents.
   Earlier Friday, the pontiff heard confessions from 11 pilgrims
and tourists in St. Peter's Basilica in keeping with a Good Friday
tradition he began in 1979, during his first Easter Week as pope.
   Several hundred people were waiting when he appeared in the
basilica shortly after noon and stepped into one of the hand-carved
mahogany confessional booths.
   For 70 minutes, he heard confessions from, among others, an
Italian family of three, a 59-year-old contractor from the
Netherlands and his daughter, and a 22-year-old student from
California.

   Two small planes collided Friday and
crashed, killing one person and critically injuring another,
authorities said. One plane landed safely with four people aboard.
   ``We were climbing out toward the ocean. ... Then all of a
sudden there was a tremendous explosion. The windshield blew out,''
said Bob Bruce, 38, of Camarillo, pilot of plane that landed
safely. ``I looked over and there was another airplane that looked
like it was descending; on its way down.''
   Bruce's rented plane, a Cessna Sky Hawk, was damaged but landed
at Camarillo Airport. He suffered facial cuts when the windshield
shattered, said Ventura County Sheriff's Lt. Lou McCombs.
   A Cessna 172 crashed in a rural area 65 miles west of Los
Angeles, said Nona Makinson, operations manager at Camarillo
Airport. One man aboard that plane died and another was in
extremely critical condition, said spokeswoman Millie Schofield of
Ventura County Medical Center.
   Bruce, who has eight years of flying experience, said he was on
a sightseeing flight over the ocean when the collision occurred.
His passengers, including boys ages 4 and 5, were not hurt.
   The National Transportation and Safety Board was investigating
the crash.

<TEXT>
   Q. Do you feel vindicated? Do you feel vindicated as a result of
Mr. McKay's _
   A. I think Mr. McKay's statement today is very helpful, but I
think it has to be taken as to what it is.
   It's an interim statement, and it just shows again that people
should not be rushing to judgment until all the conclusions are in.
   But in that regard, I think it's very helpful to point to that
particular aspect of it. Yes?
   Q. Did Mr. _
   Q. How do you respond then, Mr. Meese, to those who say in
Congress that you have become a liability for the administration
and a disgrace for the country?
   A. Well, I would respond that for me to step aside or to do
things that are incompatible with the actual state of affairs, for
reasons I mentioned earlier, would be much more of a liability.
   And frankly, I've been tremendously appreciative of the broad
support from law enforcement people, from people in Congress on
both sides of the aisle and elsewhere.
   And so I think there's no basis to step aside.
   Q. Is there any circumstance, sir, under which you would resign?
   A. Well, I'm not going into hypothetical questions. Yes?
   Q. Mr. Attorney General, could you clarify (inaudible) Weld told
you when he said he was resigning?
   A. No. I don't think it's appropriate to discuss what was meant
to be a private conversation.
   Q. Why not?
   Q. Sir _
   Q. Could you clarify for us what he did tell you?
   A. No. I'm not going into the private conversations or any other
of the aspects, because in order to do so, I'd have to comment on a
lot of things related to the matter that's under inquiry.
   Yes, right down here?
   Q. Did Mr. Fried suggest that he resign?
   A. Well again, I'm not going into any of the private
conversations.
   I've talked with all of our management team, a management team
that I am convinced is supportive of the way in which the
department is going, and I'll leave it at that. Yes?
   Q. Mr. Meese, on the question of Mr. Fried, he said that he
would continue in his job as long as he could work with integrity
and effectiveness. That's not exactly an ringing endorsement of
your leadership, sir.
   A. Well, I'm confident that Mr. Fried will always act with
integrity and effectiveness. Yes?
   Q. You used the term unscrupulous persons who might abuse the
process, but _
   A. Yes. I was using it not in regard to anybody in the current
situation, but in the hypothetical situation that if people wanted
to get rid of someone in office, all they would have to do is make
accusations.
   Q. There has been the more general case that there's a growing
trend toward the abuse of the criminal justice system for political
ends, such as to the point when even an investigation is launched,
this serves some people as an opportunity to begin a drum beat to
get others out of office? Isn't this what's happening really in
your case and how can the system be rectified so that the mere
introduction of an investigation or even indictment, anything short
of conviction, brings with it the assumption of guilt?
   A. Well, I think there are some real problems along that line,
and I will be happy to address those when this independent counsel
matter is totally completed.
   Now, any other questions? Mr. Archibald.
   Q. Attorney general, in interviews with attorneys throughout
this department, both appointed people and career civil servants,
the expressed view of many of these people is that whether or not
you are indicted or indictable is really not the issue. The issue
is that because of the prolonged investigation and the revelations
that have come out in the press, that your credibility has been so
tarnished that your effectiveness as attorney general has been so
undermined that really, for the good of the Department of Justice,
the administration and the country, (inaudible) people who are your
professional colleagues are expressing their opinion that they
think that really you should step aside and that this was the view
that was apparently expresssed to you by Mr. Burns, Mr. Weld and
Mr. Fried. Sir, would you give us a definitive statement, if you
are in disagreement with that opinion, as to why you disagreed with
this opinion which seems to be very widely held in this department?

   Sandinista soldiers and Contra rebels
on Friday began observing a 60-day cease-fire designed to give both
sides time to arrange a permanent peace in their 6{-year-old war.
   A spokesman for the Defense Ministry said there were no reports
of violations of the truce, which began after midnight Thursday.
   The cease-fire provision was contained in a peace agreement
signed March 23 in the border outpost of Sapoa, but details
remained to be worked out.
   Soldiers for both the leftist government and the U.S.-backed
rebels had been observing a temporary truce since March 21 while
negotiators hammered out the peace agreement.
   An Associated Press reporter in northern Nicaragua reported no
signs of battle Friday.
   ``We want a truce,'' said a rebel leader known as Comandante
Ernesto, one of a group of Contra leaders huddled in front of a
wooden shack in the village of La Vigia. ``This cease-fire is the
first step toward peace.''
   Nearby, Sandinista troops meandered down winding dirt roads.
   The heaviest fighting of the war has been around La Vigia, 120
miles northeast of Managua, and other parts of the mountainous
north.
   In Washington, President Reagan signed a $48 million non-lethal
aid package for the Contras, but it probably will be at least two
weeks before the rebels begin receiving supplies under the new
legislation.
   ``There certainly is an urgent need among the (rebels) for
medical supplies, food, clothing, the basic commodities of life,''
said White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater. ``This bill is very
welcome in that regard.''
   U.S. aid to the Contras ran out on Feb. 29.
   There was no immediate comment from the Sandinista government on
the bill. Most offices were closed for Good Friday observances in
the predominantly Roman Catholic country.
   Many Nicaraguans marked the long Easter weekend by taking
vacations at beaches on the Pacific coast. Banks, government
offices, stores and most restaurants were closed until Monday.
   Managua's three newspapers stopped publishing for the weekend.
   Ortega charged Thursday that the United States will try to
undermine the Nicaraguan peace process because negotiations
``debilitate the politics'' of the Reagan administration.
   ``The (Reagan) administration maintains in its thinking the
decision to destroy ... the Nicaraguan revolution and not to
normalize relations with Nicaragua,'' Ortega said.
   On Tuesday, Ortega urged the United States to hold talks to
normalize relations with his government.
   The peace agreement calls for Contra rebels to gather in
cease-fire zones during the first 15 days of April but left the
conditions to be arranged in later talks.
   Earlier this week, both sides held discussions on the cease-fire
and agreed to set up two zones in the northern part of the country,
two on the Caribbean coast and one in the south.
   Contra leader Aristides Sanchez said both sides had agreed not
to pinpoint the exact locations.
   Negotiations between the technical committees are set to begin
at Sapoa again Tuesday to determine the size of the zones and
operating rules for Contras within the areas. Still to be decided
is how the Contras will lay down their arms.
   Under the peace agreement signed March 23, the Sandinistas will
grant freedom of expression and amnesty to political prisoners and
will allow rebel leaders to take part in national talks.
   The Contras, in turn, agreed to go to the cease-fire zones and
accept only humanitarian aid from a neutral organization, such as
the International Red Cross.
   On Sunday, the Sandinista government released 100 political
prisoners from Managua's Zona Franca prison as part of a
three-stage amnesty agreement for the estimated 3,300 political
prisoners.
   The Sandinistas came to power in a revolution that ousted the
pro-American, rightist regime of the late President Anastasio
Somoza in July 1979. The United States supported the Sandinistas
initially, but in 1981 began financing the Contras.

   Protestants and Roman Catholics marched together
through London, Dublin and Belfast on Good Friday and prayed for an
end to sectarian violence.
   Cardinal Basil Hume asked London marchers to pray for political
leaders of Britain, Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic who
seek an end to the strife.
   ``Today, as never before, healing is needed not only in
grief-stricken Ireland but here in the heart of London, since we
are sadly but inevitably part of the problem,'' he said.
   ``The violence has always been the work of the few at the
expense of the many who want nothing better than to live at peace
with their neighbors.''
   Referring to the latest killings in Northern Ireland, Hume said:
``For the sake of the future of our countries, there must be a
renewed attempt to build a better society. This is no time to match
violence with violence even in the face of real or perceived
injustice.''
   Thirteen people have been killed in the province since March 6,
when British soldiers killed three Irish Republican Army guerrillas
in Gibraltar.
   The mainly Catholic IRA is fighting to drive the British out of
Northern Ireland, where Protestants are a majority, and unite the
province with the Irish Republic.
   Archbishop of Canterbury Robert Runcie, spiritual leader of the
Church of England, sent a message of peace to the 200 people who
marched silently from the Catholic Westminster Cathedral to
Westminster Abbey.
   ``I pray that the people of Ireland and England will forgive
each other for the hurts and wrongs done in the past and find in
today's common action a deeper unity of spirit,'' he said.
   About 400 people marched through Belfast and 1,000 in the center
of Dublin.
   Northern Ireland police said three people were arrested in
Belfast after stones and eggs were thrown at people marching from
Falls Road, a Catholic district, to Shankill Road, a Protestant
stronghold.
   ``The incident was over very quickly,'' a spokesman said.

   A. Well, I doubt that it's very widely held, and I have had so
many expressions to me personally to the contrary so that I think
that the action I'm taking is in the best interests of the
department, and I'm satisfied with that. Yes?
   Q. Most of us who cover this beat were under the impression that
you had at least two people who had accepted jobs and a third on
the griddle. How come you can't announce at least two of them
today? Is there a hitch?
   A. No, as I've said before, when I'm ready to announce the
people I will announce, and up until that time, I will not comment
on the various steps in the process, and I also mentioned earlier
that when I do announce the people who will be holding these
particular positions, I want to have them available here.
   Q. General Meese?
   A. Yes?
   Q. It has _ Senator Levin has said that one of the indications
showing your support and confidence within the agency would be the
_ how rapidly you were able to get someone to step in to fill the
vacancies. Now it's been put off until next week. Is that an
indication of a lack of support?
   A. Not at all.
   We have excellent people who are being considered for all of the
positions in the department, and I have no problem whatsoever as to
that. Yes?
   Q. Why do you think you've been in constant difficulty?
   A. Well, I don't know that I've been in constant difficulty.
   I think one of the things that you have, whenever there's an
independent counsel investigation, is it is an exhaustive process.
   That's been true not only in my case, but in all of the cases.
   And I think that's proper, because when that _ when that
particular process is completed, I think there will be no doubt in
anybody's mind what the facts are, and at that time, I will rest on
that judgment. Yes?
   Q. What's your opinion of how your problems are affecting the
administration? What are your personal feelings about this?
   A. I don't know.
   It's always hard to ask an individual, but all I can say is that
I have had tremendous support from within the administration at the
highest levels, and throughout the administration from other
departments, from other Cabinet members, and I'm confident that the
action which I'm taking at the present time is the right one.
   Q. General Meese?
   A. Yes.
   Q. Majority Leader Byrd called you the jeweled crown of the
sleaze factor of this administration. Could you comment on that?
   A. No, I'm not going to comment on that. All right. Yes?
   Q. Sir, in regard to the remarks on exhaustive investigation, a
number of witnesses, including Mr. Wallach and (inaudible) Mr.
Chinn, are not cooperating with that investigation. How can you say
that the investigation is totally exhaustive when key witnesses are
not cooperating with the case?
   A. I'm not going to comment on any aspect of, or details of the
inquiry. That's something that will have to be determined by the
independent counsel.

   Jesse Jackson has maintained a slight advantage
over Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis among Texas Democratic
Convention delegates, who will pick 64 delegates to the party's
national convention.
   Presidential candidates have to compete twice for delegates from
Texas, once in the state's March 8 primary and again in a series of
caucuses and conventions which begin that day. While the primary
results governed allocation of 119 national delegates, another 64
were at stake through the caucuses.
   Dukakis, who won the primary, was lagging behind Jackson in
state convention delegates in a nearly complete count issued by the
party on Thursday.
   Of the 5,037 state delegates counted so far, Jackson led with
1,722, Dukakis had 1,666 and Tennessee Sen. Albert Gore Jr. had
915. Another 251 state convention delegates remain to be counted.

<HEAD>Houston May Hold First 1988 Presidential Debate</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Houston may host the first of four scheduled
debates between the 1988 presidential nominees this fall, but Vice
President George Bush's campaign has not committed to participate
in it.
   Bush spokesman Pete Teeley said the vice president, the expected
GOP nominee, intends to debate the Democratic nominee, but only on
his terms and at a site chosen by the candidates, not the parties.
But he said Thursday it would be premature to discuss which cities
Bush, who calls Houston home, would consider.
   Since last July the Democratic and Republican national parties
have heavily promoted the series of debates and are scouting
potential sites.
   But Donald Ward, coordinator of the city's bid, said further
delay in an announcement of debate sites may force Houston to drop
its effort to host the event. This includes the release of 2,500
local hotel rooms and the third floor of the George R. Brown
Convention Center which have been held since October in
anticipation of the debate, he said.

<HEAD>Democrats Vow Big Push Against Larouche Backers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Iowa Democratic Party leaders vowed
Friday to crush an attempt by political extremist Lyndon LaRouche's
supporters to use the party's mantle in the June primary, even if
it means urging voters to go Republican in some cases.
   ``To us, these people are political poison and we are going to
beat them,'' said party spokesman Phil Roeder.
   ``They apparently feel this is fertile ground, but we are going
to teach them a major lesson,'' said Joe Shanahan, who runs
legislative elections for the party.
   Their alarm grew out of the number of LaRouche supporters filing
nomination papers to run in the June 8 primary for legislative and
congressional seats. The party leaders said they identified 16
LaRouche backers who met Friday's filing deadline.
   LaRouche supporters could win the Democratic nomination in some
legislative districts because no other democrats are running.
   If that happens, Roeder said, ``we will encourage people to vote
against them.''

<HEAD>Campaign Spending Up, Negative Advertising Down, FEC says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Groups and individuals are spending more money
overall on independent campaigns for congressional candidates, but
are spending less on negative ads, the Federal Election Commission
has found.
   A survey of 1985-86 election spending patterns revealed that
independent expenditures for House and Senate candidates was $9.3
million, up from $5.9 million in 1983-84.
   Independent expenditures, in which a person or group buys
advertising or otherwise campaigns for the candidate, are legal as
long as the person making the expenditure does not coordinate with
the candidate's campaign.
   In the 1986 congressional elections, independent expenditures
against congressional candidates totalled $1.3 million, compared to
$2.6 million in 1984.
   Independent expenditures in favor of candidates totalled $8
million, up from $3.3 million spent in the last election.

   Meese received other good news Friday when Solicitor General
Charles Fried said he would remain at the Justice Department, even
though Fried reportedly urged Meese to resign earlier in the week.
   ``I have concluded that while I am able to lead'' the solicitor
general's office ``I should continue to do so,'' Fried said. The
New York Times reported that Fried had urged Meese to quit
Wednesday but that Meese had rejected the suggestion. Fried's
statement did not endorse Meese.
   The independent counsel said that if at the end of his
investigation there remains ``insufficient evidence to warrant a
prosecution as to these or any other matters'' he will issue a
report covering all the matters which have been under investigation.
   ``Based on the evidence developed to date, he (McKay) does not
intend to recommend that the grand jury return an indictment
against Meese as to the `Aqaba pipeline' matter or as to matters
relating to Mr. Meese's investments, including the so-called `Baby
Bells' matter,'' McKay's statement said.
   If he issues a report without obtaining an indictment, McKay
said he would ``refer all of those matters for review and action by
the appropriate administrative authorities,'' an apparent reference
to Office of Government Ethics procedures.
   The ethics office has put its investigation on hold of Meese's
initial failure to disclose investments in the ``Baby Bell''
companies pending McKay's probe, said deputy director Donald
Campbell.
   If that proceeding is revived, the office could move to have
Meese make a complete disclosure of those holdings, Campbell said.
   Nathan Lewin, one of Meese's lawyers representing him in the
criminal investigation, criticized what he called ``speculation and
uninformed judgments by others that have appeared in the media.''
   ``Today's announcement by the independent counsel should
encourage everyone to continue abiding by the process,'' Justice
Department spokesman Terry Eastland said. ``It is very important
for the rule of law that we allow the process that the Congress has
ordained by enacting the independent counsel statute to continue to
run its course.''
   McKay has been investigating whether Meese conspired with
Wallach and others to violate the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act in
connection with an alleged scheme to pay the Israeli government and
the country's Labor Party to protect a proposed $1 billion oil
pipeline from military attack by Israel.
   Four months after enlisting Meese's assistance on a $1 billion
Iraqi pipeline project, Wallach wrote the attorney general a memo
saying that a portion of up to $700 million from the pipeline would
be paid to the Israeli Labor Party of then-Israeli Prime Minister
Shimon Peres. The pipeline was never built.
   Wallach at the time was legal counsel to Swiss oilman Bruce
Rappaport, a partner in the project and a longtime close friend of
Peres.
   Meese has contended he never read the portion of Wallach's memo
referring to Labor Party payments, Rappaport says he never
suggested any such plan and Peres says he was never offered any
money.
   McKay also has been investigating Meese's ownership of stock in
companies created by the breakup of AT&T when he was in a position
to make policy affecting the telecommunications industry.
   Meese as attorney general met with executives of four of the
regional Bell Telephone companies at a time when he owned $14,000
worth of stock in the Baby Bells, raising conflict-of-interest
questions.
   At the time, the Bell companies were seeking a reversal of the
Justice Department's position opposing the Bells' expansion into
new areas of business. Meese ended up approving a reversal of the
department's position early in 1987 in accordance with the
companies' wishes.
   Meese says he had intended to sell the stock in 1985 but was
unable to do so because he had lost the stock certificates. On his
financial disclosure forms for 1985 and 1986, Meese listed the Bell
stocks as having been sold. The fact that he still owned them
wasn't uncovered until last summer, when pressure from Congress
forced the attorney general to disclose the details of his
financial holdings.
   In December, McKay's office issued a similar annnouncement
stating there was insufficient evidence at that time to bring
criminal charges against Meese in connection with his efforts to
help the scandal-plagued Wedtech Corp. get defense contracts.

<HEAD>April Rain Turns To Snow Over The Southern Plains</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   A storm spread snow up to 10 inches of snow from the southern
Rockies to the southern Plains on Friday, and heavy rain ahead of
the storm raised a threat of flooding.
   Snow fell over the southeastern third of Colorado, the
northeastern half of New Mexico, the Texas Panhandle, the Oklahoma
Panhandle and western Kansas.
   There were reports of 10 inches of snow over sections of the
Texas Panhandle and 6 inches of snow at Ulysses, Kan., the National
Weather Service said.
   In Oklahoma, the range was from 5 inches near Boise City to 10
inches near Guymon. Amounts in Colorado were mostly around 3 inches
or less.
   The snow closed some highways in the Texas and Oklahoma
panhandles.
   Ahead of the snow, rain and thunderstorms extended from the
remainder of Kansas and Oklahoma into eastern Texas, producing
marble-size hail in Oklahoma. Ground in the southern half of the
Plains was already saturated and flash flood watches were posted
over northeastern and central Oklahoma and the southeastern quarter
of Kansas.
   The Caney River was expected to crest during the night at
Bartlesville, Okla., at about 3 feet above flood stage. The Neosho
River was expected to crest about 4 feet above flood stage Sunday
evening at Commerce, Okla., and Oswego, Kan.
   Showers extended across northeastern Texas, the lower two-thirds
of the Mississippi Valley, the Ohio Valley, the Tennessee Valley,
eastern Mississippi, Alabama, western Georgia, northern
Pennsylvania and southern New York state.
   Elsewhere, rain continued over the northern Oregon coast.
   Temperatures around the nation at 2 p.m. EST ranged from 26
degrees at Yellowstone National Park, Wyo., to 85 degrees at
Kingsville, Texas. The early morning low for the nation was zero at
Yellowstone National Park.
   For Saturday, rain and occasional thunderstorms were forecast
from New Jersey across Pennsylvania, the Ohio Valley and the
Tennessee Valley, from the northwestern half of Georgia across the
Florida Panhandle, Alabama, Mississippi and southeastern Louisiana,
and from Iowa across Missouri, northern Arkansas, the east-central
Plains, Illinois, southern Wisconsin and Lower Michigan. Scattered
rain was forecast over the northern Pacific Coast.
   Highs in the 40s and 50s were predicted over New England, the
Great Lakes, the upper Mississippi Valley, the central Plains,
Oklahoma, the Texas Panhandle and the southern Rockies, as well as
the Pacific Northwest; in the 80s over the Florida Peninsula,
southern Texas, central California and the desert Southwest, and in
the 60s and 70s over the remainder of the nation.

<HEAD>FAA Orders $632,200 Civil Fine Against Orion Air</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By H. JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Federal Aviation Administration on Friday
ordered a $632,200 civil fine for numerous safety violations
against Orion Air, the cargo airline that is being sought out to
fly passengers in case of a strike at Eastern Airlines.
   The civil penalty stemmed from violations of federal aviation
regulations uncovered during an inspection of Orion Air's
operations a year ago. The FAA said the violations have since been
corrected, although the agency is still reviewing whether to allow
the airline to fly passengers.
   The North Carolina-based cargo airline became the object of
controversy in recent months after it entered into an agreement to
fly passengers on Eastern Airlines' routes if Eastern becomes the
target of a strike by machinists and pilots.
   Eastern's unions have charged that the tactic is a violation of
labor law. Earlier this week a federal judge ordered Eastern to
halt the training of non-union Orion pilots under the contract with
Eastern, putting the future of Eastern's plans with Orion Air into
doubt.
   The FAA said its fine stemmed from practices by Orion Air that
involved operating some aircraft that did not meet federal
airworthiness requirements and allowing pilots to fly too many
hours in violation of federal duty-time limits.
   For example, the agency said, an Orion Air Boeing 727 was found
to have flown 1,193 flights while violating an airworthiness
requirement involving the plane's mechanism that adjusts wing
slats. Slat position is critical in an aircraft's takeoff because
it affects lift.
   In another example cited by the FAA, some pilots of Orion Air
were found to have flown slightly more than 100 hours during a
single month. The FAA requires that no pilot fly more than 100
hours during a 30-day period and most commercial passenger airlines
schedule their pilots to no more than 70 to 75 hours per month.
   The FAA said in a statement that Orion Air, which has its
headquarters in Raleigh, N.C., ``moved quickly to correct the
deficiencies (discovered during the inspection) and is now in
compliance with the (federal) regulations.''
   A request that Orion Air be given a certificate to fly
passengers is still pending before the agency, said FAA spokesman
Fred Farrar.
   Few travelers likely have heard of Orion Air, which has 55 jet
aircraft and serves such air freight companies as United Parcel
Service, Emery Air Freight and Purolator.
   In an attempt to blunt the effects of a strike, Eastern earlier
this year disclosed that it was leasing 26 of its jets to Orion
Air. Eastern officials called the move ``insurance'' that would
allow the cargo airline to fly passengers on Eastern routes if
pilots honor a possible strike by Eastern's machinists.
   The FAA acknowledged during congressional hearings in February
that it found numerous safety violations at Orion Air during its
inspection in April and March, 1987.
   At the time, Orion officials acknowledged the violations, but
said that the problems had been corrected.
   Orion officials could not immediately be reached for comment on
the civil penalties announced by the FAA Friday.

<HEAD>Senators Prepare For Votes in Impeachment Trial</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Gov. Evan Mecham stayed at his suburban
``government in exile'' Friday as state senators prepared for the
weighty decision of whether to remove the impeached governor from
office.
   Mecham, who has been giving speeches and making campaign trips,
stepped out of the spotlight Friday as his Senate impeachment trial
approached final arguments, and possibly a vote, on Monday.
   ``There will be nothing over the weekend,'' said a secretary at
Mecham's office in suburban Glendale. ``He is in the office just
working on things here.''
   At the Senate building, which was officially closed for Good
Friday, Republican Majority Leader Robert Usdane was at his desk,
poring over legal instructions and a trial memorandum from the
prosecution.
   He insisted he has not made up his mind whether Mecham is guilty
or innocent.
   The first-term Republican is charged with attempting to obstruct
an investigation of an alleged death threat by one of his staffers
and misusing $80,000 from a protocol fund by loaning it to his car
dealership.
   ``I have to go back and look at the evidence again,'' Usdane
said. ``Nothing hit me between the eyes, so I'm going to have to go
back and see what's there.''
   Usdane said he found the second charge regarding the $80,000
loan ``heavier.''
   ``There's more involvement by the governor. More people
testified,'' he said, adding that testimony by Mecham's former
chief of staff, Jim Colter, contradicted the governor's.
   Usdane said his greatest concern was that his Senate colleagues
not be swayed by phone calls from constituents urging them to vote
one way or the other or face retribution at the ballot box.
   ``When it comes down to the bottom line, people will make a
decision and not let what is going to happen to them politically
change that decision,'' Usdane said. ``At least that's what I
hope.''
   Politics was evident this week when the 11 Democratic senators
voted as a bloc Wednesday to dismiss the third impeachment count
against Mecham. Democrats said they wanted to get the trial over in
advance of the May 17 gubernatorial recall election. If he is
removed from office, Mecham will not be able to run.
   Five Republicans who have consistently voted on the governor's
side joined the Democrats to dismiss the count, which accused him
of concealing a $350,000 campaign loan.
   Mecham also faces an April 21 criminal trial on felony charges
of concealing the campaign loan.
   A two-thirds vote of the 30-member Senate would be required to
convict Mecham, the first U.S. governor impeached in six decades.
Another two-thirds vote could bar him for life from holding
elective office in Arizona.

<HEAD>Hundreds Join March To Protest Crackdown</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DURBAN, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Clergyman carrying crosses led
hundreds of people on a silent march through downtown Durban Friday
to protest the white-led government's new restrictions on
anti-apartheid groups.
   In a separate development, police reported that a white
constable was fatally stabbed overnight by a group of blacks while
on foot patrol in Pinetown West, on the outskirts of Durban. No
details about the attack were released.
   Nearly 1,000 people participated in the march at dawn. Nineteen
people wore gags to symbolize restrictions that banned the
opposition newspaper New Nation and major organizations opposed to
apartheid, under which the black majority has no voice in national
affairs.
   ``Many voices which stand for justice are being silenced in our
country, and we commit ourselves to ensure that those voices may be
heard once again,'' said Miriam Cele of the Dependents' Conference,
which assists the families of detainees.
   Among those addressing the protesters at church services before
and after the march was Archie Gumede, co-president of the United
Democratic Front, South Africa's largest anti-apartheid coalition
and one of the groups banned from all activity in February.
   Gumede was issued an individual restriction order limiting his
political activities.
   Other speakers at the services were Roman Catholic Archbishop
Denis Hurley and the Rev. Stanley Mogoba, general secretary of the
Methodist Church.
   After the march, women from the Black Sash civil rights
organization planted crosses on the beach opposite regional army
headquarters to protest Monday's commando raid in Botswana in which
four people were killed.
   South Africa said the victims were guerrillas of the outlawed
African National Congress, the main guerrilla group fighting
apartheid. Botswana says three of those killed were Botswanan
citizens.
   By law and custom, apartheid establishes a racially segregated
society in which the 26 million blacks have no vote in national
affairs. The 5 million whites control the economy and maintain
separate districts, schools and health services.

<HEAD>WASHN: independent counsel.</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Q. There are reports that first lady Nancy Reagan would like to
see you go. What can you tell us about your relations with Mrs.
Reagan?
   A. I have always had a very good relationship with Mrs. Reagan
and that still continues.
   Q. You say you've had strong support in Congress and yet
everything we've heard in the public record except for maybe one or
two senators who have supported you has been quite critical,
especially among Republicans who say that you are hurting the party
and you are doing a disservice to the president. Do you not feel
that in a political election year, perhaps you should step, if not
down, aside?
   A. I can only tell you what people have told me, and as I say,
they come from both sides of the aisle.
   Q. Are you troubled by what Senator Thurmond told you yesterday?
   A. No, Senator Thurmond was very helpful and I'm very
appreciative with my conversations with him.
   Q. Have any of these problems been caused by any mistakes of
your own? And if so, what is wrong?
   A. Well, again, I will be happy to talk about my own conduct in
detail, when the independent counsel inquiry is over.
   As a matter of fact, I'll be meeting with all of you at that
time and that's when I can answer those questions more fully.
   Q. Mr. Meese, in the general sense, you promised the Senate
Judiciary Committee _
   A. I'm sorry, I can't hear you _
   Q. You promised the Senate Judiciary Commmittee during your
confirmation hearings that you had learned a lesson from the Stein
inquiry and that you would be more sensitive to ethical questions
in the future. Do you feel in general without going into the
details of the investigation that you can't talk about, that you've
lived up to that promise?
   A. Yes. OK?
   Q. Some officials have said this week that you've been so
distracted by your problems that you spend only 10 minutes a week
on the war on drugs, that you haven't been available for meetings
to try to decide what to do about the McNally decision. Could you
comment on those perceptions?
   A. Yes, that's totally untrue.
   I would say that I devote a good portion of my time.
   First of all, virtually all my time during the work week and a
good portion of weekends is devoted to the business of the
department and the attention that I've given to the matters of
leading the Drug Policy Board occupies a good portion of my time,
probably somewhere between 30 and 50 percent of my time.
   Q. That's during the week.
   A. During the week, yes. Not on Sundays.
   Q. Sir, why isn't the public entitled to know why Mr. Burns and
Weld, who are public officials who quit for reasons which involve
public policy, why aren't they entitled to know what they told you
and what their concerns were?
   A. Because _ as has been my practice in all personnel matters, I
leave that up to the individuals themselves, and I do not go into
detail as to what they've told me in confidential conversations.
Yes?
   Q. Attorney general, would you tell us why Judge Adams is
reluctant to take the deputy's job?
   A. I don't know what you're talking about.
   I never comment on anything or anybody affirmatively,
negatively, affirm or deny as to any person unless and until we're
ready to make an announcement.
   Q. You said _
   A. Yes.
   Q. _ you said you were talking to people of quality. He is a
person of quality. Why is he saying no?
   A. I'm talking to a lot of people of quality.
   Hello?
   Q. Is it your intention to stay on the job until the end of the
administration?
   A. Well, again, I've told you before. I've never set either a
limit or a deadline, but it is certainly my intent to carry on my
duties as long as the president wants me to.
   I think that just about exhausts the questions.
   Thank you.

   Here is the text of the statement issued
Friday by the office of independent counsel James C. McKay
regarding the investigation of Attorney General Edwin Meese III:
   
   James C. McKay, the independent counsel investigating Attorney
General Edwin Meese III, in order to clarify the current status of
this criminal investigation, announced today that, based on the
evidence developed to date, he does not intend to recommend that
the grand jury return an indictment against Mr. Meese as to the
`Aqaba pipeline'' matter or as to the matters relating to Mr.
Meese's investments including the so-called ``Baby Bells'' matter.
   This announcement is being made because of recent media reports
that an indictment is imminent.
   Mr. McKay has previously made a similar announcement with
respect to the Wedtech matter.
   Mr. McKay emphasized, however, that the grand jury's
investigation is not yet complete as to these and other matters,
and will continue at least through the end of April.
   If at the end of that period of time there remains insufficient
evidence to warrant a prosecution as to these or any other matters,
and if the grand jury and the Office of Independent Counsel concur
that further investigation is not warranted, the Office of
Independent Counsel will issue a report covering all the matters
which have been under investigation.
   Also, in that event, Mr. McKay will refer all of those matters
for review and action by the appropriate admnistrative authorities.

<HEAD>NASA Scientist Finds Evidence Earth Hit By Millions Of Tiny Comets
Annually</HEAD>

<DATELINE>PASADENA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A NASA scientist said Friday he found
new evidence supporting a controversial theory that millions of
small, dark, water-bearing comets strike Earth's atmosphere every
year.
   Other scientists remained skeptical, but physicist Clayne
Yeates, of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, said: ``I'm very
convinced that what I'm seeing is real. ... These objects would not
have been seen inadvertently during other searches. They're small,
they're dark and they're moving fast.''
   The theory was first proposed in 1986 by University of Iowa
physicist Louis Frank, who said Friday he was met with ``total
disbelief'' and ``lost a lot of friends'' because of it.
   ``I'm happy (about Yeates' observations), but it's been a long
two years,'' Frank said by telephone from Iowa City.
   A NASA news release called Frank's hypothesis ``one of the
decade's most controversial astronomical theories.''
   Frank proposed the theory after ultraviolet photographs of Earth
taken by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's
Dynamics Explorer 1 spacecraft in 1981-86 revealed countless dark
spots that appeared to be tiny holes in Earth's atmosphere.
   Frank theorized that about 10 million comets, essentially
30-foot-diameter fluffy snowballs with a dark coating, plunge into
the atmosphere each year, forming holes then breaking up and
vaporizing.
   He hypothesized that during Earth's early history, billions of
the tiny comets would have provided enough water to fill all the
oceans.
   Yeates said his observations on the 36-inch Spacewatch Telescope
at Kitt Peak National Observatory in Arizona make him believe that
at least a million such comets hit the atmosphere annually at a
speed of 22,000 mph.
   The comets appeared as white streaks on enhanced telescope
images, said Yeates, who is deputy project scientist for the
planned 1989 launch of the Galileo space probe to Jupiter.
   ``I'm a little skeptical,'' said astronomer Anita Cochran, of
the University of Texas at Austin. ``He (Yeates) may be seeing
something, but to leap to 10-meter comets is a fairly large leap of
imagination.''
   Frank said a soon-to-be-published study, in which atmospheric
holes were recently observed by Sweden's Viking spacecraft, also
supports his theory.
   University of Michigan physicist and planetary scientist Thomas
Donahue said: ``I'm not going to say this sounds like confirmation
of Frank's comets or not. But it certainly is exciting.''
   About a year ago, Donahue used 1977 data from the Voyager 2
space probe to show that Earth's atmosphere contained an excess of
hydrogen atoms released from water vapor. He said the discovery
could be consistent with Frank's theory, but also could be
explained if the hydrogen was freed from 10 million times fewer
comets that were smaller, faster but much more active than those
postulated by Frank.
   The less abundant comets wouldn't provide enough water to fill
the oceans, Donahue said.
   ``I really am a bit skeptical'' of Yeates' observations, said
Brian Marsden, associate director for planetary sciences at the
Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics in Cambridge, Mass.
   ``If they (comets) are as numerous as he's talking about, then
some of these should show up when the telescope is in more normal
operation, and they haven','' Marsden said.
   Frank replied that only two specialized telescopes in the
country, including Spacewatch, are capable of observing the comets.
   Cochran voiced the most common objection to Frank's theory: If
so many icy comets hit Earth's atmosphere, they also should strike
the moon, creating a lot of water vapor. Yet the moon has very
little water vapor.
   Yeates said his observations are consistent with Frank's theory
that the comets orbit the sun in the same direction as Earth, and
that they are very dark, reflecting only 2 percent of the sunlight
that hits them.
   Despite the large number of such comets, there is so much space
around Earth that they would strike any single spacecraft only once
every 100 million years, he said.

   A group of Hungarian students has
established an independent youth group intended as an alternative
to the Communist youth organization KISZ, one of the students
reported Friday.
   ``The objective ... is to create a new autonomous and
independent youth organization for the politically active ...
reform-minded youth groups,'' said a statement issued by the group,
according to Miklos Andrasi.
   Andrasi, 25, a recent university graduate in economics, said by
telephone from Budapest that the group was formally established
Wednesday. He said it has 37 members so far and that it wants to
work for a ``new Hungary.''
   Andrasi said KISZ has been losing influence among the country's
youth. He said the new group, Fidesz _ the Alliance of Young
Democrats _ would accept Communist Party members.
   The group hoped to talk to representatives of KISZ soon about
the possibility of cooperating, he said, but it rejects the idea of
membership in both organizations.
   There have been increased calls in Hungary for more pluralism
and political reforms to accompany a strict austerity program that
Parliament adopted last September to help the country's stagnating
economy.
   The group's statement said Fidesz wanted Hungary to have a mixed
economy and democracy.

<TEXT>
   S-CHARL, Switzerland (AP) _ An avalanche engulfed a Dutch skiing
party on San Lorenzo mountain Friday, killing five people and
injuring a sixth in the deadliest snowslide in the Swiss Alps in
three years, police said.
   The deaths brought the skiing season's avalanche toll in
Switzerland to 19.
   The snowslide occurred at noontime and swept seven Dutch skiers
and a local mountain guide down the slope. The guide and one
tourist freed themselves and alerted rescue helicopters by a
walkie-talkie radio, police reported.
   Search teams assisted by dogs recovered five bodies and rescued
an injured woman who was flown to a Zurich hospital.
   The skiers were at the 8,600-foot level of the nearly
10,000-foot mountain when they were struck by the avalanche. The
Swiss Avalanche Research Institute on Friday had warned of moderate
snowslide danger above 6,600 feet.
   Police did not release the names of the victims, but said the
Dutch group came to S-charl on Sunday for a week of ski touring.
   It was the deadliest avalanche in Switzerland since 11 people
were killed near Zermatt in March 1985.

most consumers can afford to ``pay a few more pennies for a glass
of milk or for a cone of ice cream or for a loaf of bread.''
   A crowd nearly the size of the entire population of this town
gathered on Bud and Faye Lee's farm to hear Jackson call for fair
farm prices, a move designed to capture the votes of the 2,500-plus
farmers who attended the rally.
   ``The fact is farmers deserve fair prices and workers deserve
fair wages and the rich must pay fair taxes,'' Jackson said on the
dairy farm outside of Amery, a town of 2,800. ``The reality is if
urban people are working, they can pay a few more pennies for a
glass of milk or for a cone of ice cream or for a loaf of bread.''
   The preacher-turned-politician campaigned for another full day
across Wisconsin in preparation for Tuesday's primary. Jackson is
locked in a tight race with Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis
here, according to pre-primary polls.
   From the Lee farm, he headed to an Indian reservation near Green
Bay and to meet with union workers he stood with in a strike last
year.
   Farmers are a key part of the coalition that Jackson hopes will
give him another big-state victory, and the almost all-white crowd
in Amery suggested he is making some progress.
   ``He's great,'' said David Dittman, a farmer from St. Croix
County, Wis. ``He's the only one who has been standing up for the
family farm.''
   ``We don't have to invent a 30-second TV spot showing Jesse
Jackson with the people: he's been with the people over the
years,'' said Texas Agriculture Commissioner Jim Hightower, on hand
for the event.
   Jackson, standing on a hay wagon in front of dark blue grain
silos on the 600-acre dairy farm, returned to his religious roots
in his first event on Good Friday.
   ``While so many farmers have been driven under in Polk County,
and though there is so much pain all around us representing the
crucifixion ... there is a sense that the crucifixion is not going
to last much longer, somehow we are going to roll the stone away
and there is going to be renewal, resurrection, new hope ... as we
the people come together,'' he said.
   Jackson, saying he has stood with farmers for years, repeated
his support for the liberal Harkin-Gephardt family farm legislation
and said he backs higher milk price supports. He did not specify
what increase he would support.
   Jackson blamed middlemen in the food business and the government
for the farm problems and for increasing food prices.
   ``The farmer did not take advantage of the consumer, it was
ConAgra, Cargill and the barracudas that ate up the farmers,'' he
said, mentioning several large grain companies.
   ``The system has collapsed because you had good farmers and a
poor president,'' Jackson added.
   He accused the Reagan administration of misrepresenting the
situation with the dairy industry in order to cut spending on price
supports _ as it did in January. At the same time, he said the
administration was shutting down a free-cheese distribution program
_ a major outlet for surplus milk products.
   Jackson refered again to criticism of his lack of governmental
experience.
   ``There is a lot of talk now days about experience. Mine is in
leadership. ... Some officeholders are not leaders. And some
leaders are not officeholders,'' he said.

   Masked gunmen opened fire Friday in a

two, Italian news reports said.
   The news agency AGI said the gunmen belonged to a Neopolitan

   Reports said the dead included two ex-convicts and a waitress
who was serving lunch at their table when three or four men began
shooting inside the the Little Rabbit restaurant.
   Two other people described as ex-convicts were wounded, one
seriously, in the attack in the Torre Del Greco suburb, the

<TEXT>
   An 80-year-old, three-masted square rigger that
sank Jan. 15 was raised from the murky Boston Harbor on Friday by
three giant cranes.
   The Danish-built Regina Maris, believed to be the nation's last
working square rigger of is size, had gone down in 30 feet of water
at dockside, leaving only its masts protruding from the water.
   The deck broke the surface Friday afternoon, eliciting a sigh of
relief from salvagers who had slung cables around the hull of the
historic, 114-foot barkentine.
   ``With a ship this age and it being a wooden ship, we were
concerned that if it wasn't lifted uniformly ... we would pull one
of the lifting cables through the ship, so it was important that we
lifted it evenly,'' said Jim Frye, managing director of Marina Bay
of Quincy, owner of the vessel. ``It was a little dramatic, to say
the least.''
   Debris cluttered the deck and hung from the rigging, but the
Regina Maris did not appear damaged.
   The ship had been docked at Marina Bay for two years. It had
been taken to Boston Marine Workers for routine maintenance when it
sank without explanation.
   The vessel will be put in dry dock, where an effort will be made
to determine the cause of the sinking.
   Frye said the proprietors planned to turn the vessel into a
floating restaurant.
   He said the $50,000 operation to refloat the ship took six weeks
of planning. One of the giant cranes had to be brought in from New
Jersey.
   Field superintendent David Kenny of Cashman Co., which raised
the ship, said the Regina Maris weighed more than 100 tons and the
cranes had a total lift capacity of 515 tons.
   ``The knot left everybody's stomach'' as the ship came up, he
said.

   An Israeli Cabinet minister said his country had no
intention of attacking medium-range missiles recently acquired by
Saudi Arabia.
   In an interview to be broadcast Saturday by the Arabic service
of Radio France International, Yitzhak Navon said:
   ``As a vice prime minister, I can state that Israel has no
intention of striking Saudi Arabia or any other country. And if it
is confirmed that these missiles threaten Israel, there are
diplomatic means to counter such a threat. Countries like Syria,
Iraq and Libya have missiles. Israel has not threatened them or
done anything else.''
   A French script of the interview was obtained by the Associated
Press.
   The Washington Post reported last month that the Israeli air
force had been conducting unusually intensive low-level bombing
practice runs. It quoted U.S. intelligence officials as saying the
runs could be in preparation for a pre-emptive strike at the
missiles.
   President Reagan warned Israel a week ago against attacking the
CSS-2 missiles the Saudis purchased from China.
   It is believed the missiles have a range of 1,000 miles _
capable of reaching Israel.
   Navon is minister of education and culture and a member of
Foreign Minister Shimon Peres' Labor Party. Peres is deputy prime
minister and Navon is one of several vice prime ministers in the
Cabinet.

   A delegation from Amnesty International, the

fact-finding mission and has met with prison inmates, according to
Cuba's Prensa Latina news agency. In a dispatch monitored in Mexico
City, the agency said Amnesty representatives arrived in Cuba on
March 24 and on Thursday inspected the Boniato prison in Santiago
de Cuba, 430 miles southeast of Havana. It said the visitors spoke
with inmates.
   Prensa Latina said Ian Martin, director of the organization's
department for the Americas, heads the Amnesty team. It quoted
Martin as saying the prison visit was ``very special, directly
related to our work.'' The agency said the Amnesty group also met
convicts in other Cuban prisons, but gave no details.
   The group also met with members of the government's judicial
tribunals and officials of the federal prosecutor's office, Prensa
Latina reported.
   It said the Amnesty visit came at the invitation of Vice
President Carlos Gonzalez Perez. The dispatch did not say how many
people were in the Amnesty group or give other details.

   Hundreds of Christmas stockings stuffed with
cocaine paraphernalia were among $5 million worth of merchandise
seized from a company, authorities said Friday.
   Company owner Stephan Pesce, 31, of Massapequa was charged under
a 1987 federal law making it illegal to sell or transport drug
items across state lines and to foreign countries, said U.S.
Attorney Andrew J. Maloney of Brooklyn.
   Customs agents searched Main Street Distributors Inc. in
Hauppauge on Thursday and carted off two truckloads of merchandise,
Maloney said. Much of the drug paraphernalia was imported from
Taiwan or Japan, he said.
   The Christmas stockings, sealed with a picture of a smiling
Santa Claus and a ``Merry Christmas'' greeting, contained a mirror,
razor blade, a metal tube, a small glass container and a cocaine
spoon, authorities said.
   Pesce could receive up to three years in jail and up to $1
million in fines if convicted.

   Twenty suspected Kurdish guerrillas were
killed in a shootout Friday with security forces in southeastern
Turkey, the state radio said.
   It was the highest number of rebels slain in a single battle
since the Kurdish insurgency began in August 1984, it said.
   The radio said the guerrillas opened fire after they were
surrounded by security forces and told to surrender. Two soldiers
were also killed in the fight, which took place near the village of
Kadirli in Nusaybin township, the radio said.
   The report quoted the the regional governor's office as saying
two other soldiers were wounded.
   In addition to the battle casualties, a major was killed and
five soldiers were injured when the helicopter taking them to the
zone crashed, according to the report. It did not say what might
have caused the crash.
   Most of the rebels in the area belong to an organization that
seeks to establish a Marxist Kurdish state in southeastern and
eastern Turkey.
   More than 700 civilians and military personnel and 700 Kurdish
insurgents have been killed in violence related to the revolt since
1984.
   Ethnic Kurds make up about one-fifth of Turkey's population of
52 million.

   Douglas Edwards, who was the nation's first
nightly TV anchorman, preceding Walter Cronkite in the job at CBS,
had his last day at the network on Friday after 46 years.
   Friday's midday ``CBS Newsbreak'' was his last television
appearance for CBS.
   He concluded it with a personal statement: ``And so ends the
chapter of almost 46 years as this reporter moves on along the
journey. A deep bow of gratitude, love and respect to the men and
women of CBS News and to the company for which they stand. To you
out there, thank you for honoring me with your presence in my
audience, and most of all for your voices, your most sweet voices.
Douglas Edwards, CBS News New York.''
   Edwards' last radio broadcast was Friday night. At its close,
CBS News vice president Joe Dembo wished Edwards ``goodbye and
Godspeed,'' and CBS Evening News anchorman Dan Rather saluted him
as ``one of the founding fathers'' of broadcast journalism.
   President Reagan sent a congratulatory letter calling Edwards a
``consummate professional.''
   ``Over the years, countless men and women have turned to you for
the news, especially in time of crisis, and have felt reassured
that they are `getting it straight' when they hear the the voice of
Douglas Edwards. I can't think of any greater tribute to a
journalist than that,'' said Reagan's letter.
   Edwards joined CBS Radio in 1942, joining Edward R. Murrow's
staff in London towards the end of World War II. Later, he served
as Paris bureau chief.
   When CBS launched its evening news show in 1948, then-CBS
President Frank Stanton tapped Edwards to anchor it and called it
``Douglas Edwards with the News.''
   NBC followed with ``Camel News Caravan,'' and ABC later launched
a nightly news show with John Daly.
   Edwards stayed in the job for 14 years, until the show became
the ``CBS Evening News'' and Cronkite took over as anchor.
   Edwards, 70, plans to move to Sarasota, Fla. He will continue
lecturing on broadcast journalism and start work on a book.

   Talks between striking seamen and P and O European
Ferries broke down on Good Friday, the first day of the Easter
weekend, and no further talks were scheduled, government mediator
Dennis Boyd said.
   P and O is one of the main ferry services across the English
Channel. At Dover, where the line's seamen have been off the job
for two months, about 3,800 frustrated tourists were stuck in a
line of more than 100 buses, an equal number of cars and 500 trucks.
   P and O chairman Peter Ford issued a statement to those waiting
at Dover: ``I have nothing but apologies and regret for the people
who have been disrupted. I remain convinced we will achieve a
solution to this dispute, which I believe is being prolonged
unnecessarily by people who are not trying to solve it.''
   Tourists who had ferry reservatons for Calais faced delays of up
to 12 hours and truck drivers could be waiting even longer, said
Paul Youden of the Dover Harbor Board. Buses at the end of the line
were given estimates of 24 hours.
   The strike has halted all P and O ferries in Dover but other
vessels were operating from the port. About 2,300 seamen are
striking over the line's plans to cut 400 jobs and introduce new
shifts.

   A Ugandan rebel leader and voodoo
priestess who anointed her troops with oils to protect them from
bullets was turned over to United Nations authorities after three
months in prison, a Kenyan government official said Friday.
   Alice Lakwena, who fled to Kenya after Ugandan troops
slaughtered her army, was turned over to the U.N. high commissioner
for refugees, according to a high-ranking Kenyan government
official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   New Vision, the Ugandan government newspaper, reported Friday
that Ms. Lakwena was seeking political asylum through the United
Nations.
   The Kenya government jailed Ms. Lakwena and seven of her Holy
Spirit Movement followers in December on charges of entering the
country illegally. Kenya had said it would turn the rebel leader
over to the Ugandan government after she completed her a four-month
sentence.
   But Ms. Lakwena appealed and the Kenyan High Court ruled Feb. 11
that the minister in charge of immigration should decide on whether
to return her to Uganda. New Vision said Kenya had decided not to
extradite Ms. Lakwena but did not give a source for its report.
   Ms. Lakwena, believed to be 28, was born to an Anglican
clergyman and his wife in northern Uganda.
   She began her crusade against the government of President Yoweri
Museveni in early 1987, claiming she was guided by a spirit
demanding his ouster. She was known to followers as ``Mama Alice.''
   She raised a battalion of followers numbering as many as 15,000
and told them she had magical powers to protect them. But
government troops crushed her army, which fought with sticks and
stones, late last year.
   There was no word on her jailed followers Friday and no official
Kenyan statement on her release. The U.N. refugee office in Nairobi
was closed for Good Friday and calls to representatives' homes went
unanswered.

   Joe Collins, a theatrical agent and the father of
``Dynasty'' actress Joan Collins and novelist Jackie Collins, died
Friday. He was 85.
   Collins began his show business career as office boy with Moss
Empires theaters in London and later worked as an assistant theater
manager in Sheffield and Liverpool.
   In 1931, he became a theatrical agent. The first artist he
signed was dancer Lew Grade, now television producer Lord Grade,
who became his partner. When Grade left the Collins and Grade
agency, Collins continued alone.
   He helped launch the careers of Peter Sellers, Tom Jones and
Roger Moore. Collins also persuaded his daughter to take the role
of Alexis in ``Dynasty'' even though a theatrical company was
trying to hold her to a previous contract.
   His own biography was titled ``A Touch of Collins.''

   Police shut down an expressway
outside Philadelphia on Friday in a search for a man who stabbed to
death two women and wounded a couple working on an archeological
dig at a construction site.
   Police said they knew of no motive for the stabbings, which
occurred in or near a house close to the Schuylkill Expressway, the
state's most congested road and the major east-west thoroughfare
through Philadelphia.
   Authorities withheld information on the dead women but
identified the injured as Glenn Sheehan, 39, and his wife, Ann
Jensen, 31, both hospitalized with multiple stab wounds.
   The shutdown of the expressway for nearly an hour forced a
detour in which a tractor-trailer rammed into two cars and flipped
over a barrier, injuring two people.
   Police said they were looking for a man witnesses described as
driving a pickup truck with Massachusetts license plates.

   The top women officials of labor federations in
seven cities issued a statement Friday complaining that women on
the job received unequal treatment and demanding a public debate on
the issue.
   ``We call upon the media, economic and theoretical communities,
leaders at all levels of the (Communist) party and government ...
and all men and women workers to air their own views and actively
join in a discussion,'' the seven women said in the statement,
published on the front page of the newspaper Workers' Daily.
   Their statement, drafted at a meeting in Beijing, was especially
critical of what they said was a growing tendency to fire women
once they have children.
   Many enterprises also have done away with maternity leave and
other ``women's benefits'' in order to cut costs now that companies
are being held responsible for their own profits and losses.
   ``Some people believe that when a woman becomes pregnant and has
a child it is a private matter and becomes a burden for the
enterprise,'' the statement said. ``But others believe women carry
two heavy loads, of helping produce material goods for society and
perpetutating the human race, and this contribution deserves social
recognition and special protection.''
   Women were regarded as inferior in traditional China's rigid
social hierarchy but are promised equal treatment in Communist
China's constitution.
   In reality, they hold few high government or party posts and
have little social influence. Most still bear the full burden of
household chores and child-rearing while also working full-time in
the fields or in factories.
   Political and economic reforms, including decentralization of
authority and emphasis on profit-and-loss, have eroded the few
guarantees of access to higher education, jobs and political
representation for women.
   Official media have carried dozens of reports in the past year
of women being denied jobs or fired because of their sex. A recent
All-China Federation of Trade Unions survey found that 64 percent
of all workers being laid off in factory reorganizations were women.
   The statement by the seven labor leaders blamed the lingering
influence of ``old thinking'' and the failure of enterprises to
find practical solutions to problems faced by women workers with
children.
   ``If these problems are not solved, not only will it harm the
enthusiasm of women workers, but it will have impact on the
progress of (economic) reform,'' said the seven, who head the
women's sections of Beijing, Luoyang, Wuhan, Chongqing, Nantong,
Handan and Liuzhou municipal labor federations.

<HEAD>Dukakis Says Reagan Administration Permits a Corporate Mania</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDs: ADD 7grafs to UPDATE with Dukakis' comments on Meese</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By WILLIAM M. WELCH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>RACINE, Wis. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Democrat Michael Dukakis, looking for
support among union voters, said Friday the Reagan administration
has permitted a corporate ``merger mania'' that has cost a
half-million workers their jobs and weakened America.
   Dukakis injected a strain of populism into his presidential
campaign as he spoke to labor audiences in Wisconsin, where he is
locked in what polls suggest is a close race with rival Democrat
Jesse Jackson.
   ``Wall Street pirates and corporate hit teams aren't the model
for a new America,'' Dukakis said.
   The Massachusetts governor spoke to about 500 people crowded
into the Racine Labor Center, a meeting place for various union
locals, where he criticized Attorney General Edwin Meese III and
blamed the administration for what he described as a ``takeover
epidemic'' among giant companies that enrich the corporate raiders
and put workers out of their jobs.
   ``If we're serious about winning the battle for our economic
future, we've got to get control of the merger and acquisition
binge that's gobbling up capital, tearing corporations apart like
erector sets, making millions of dollars for a few ... and leaving
the average working men and women of America holding the bag,'' he
said.
   Dukakis' audience was mostly retired and active union members in
Racine, from auto, tractor and other manufacturing plants in a area
where unemployment is reported to be more than 8 percent. Later he
was speaking to displaced workers in Green Bay and visiting a farm
near Wausau in northern Wisconsin.
   Dukakis' populist-tinged speech came as his campaign began a new
television ad in Wisconsin attacking the Reagan administration and
depicting farm foreclosures and homeless families.
   He is battling Jackson _ whose own populist appeal has made him
a close second to Dukakis in the delegate race _ in next Tuesday's
Wisconsin primary. After his loss to Jackson in Michigan, Dukakis
needs a victory in Wisconsin. Also running are Sens. Albert Gore
Jr. of Tennessee, who has been attacking big corporations in
television ads in this state, and Paul Simon of Illinois.
   Under criticism from some Democrats for a bland style, Dukakis
has unveiled new campaign speeches in an effort to sharpen his
message, even as aides maintain he is not changing his style or
approach in reaction to opponents.
   Dukakis cited figures showing more than 12,000 corporations have
changed hands in the last five years and that 15 takeover bids of
$1 billion or more have been made in the past 12 weeks.
   ``And what have we got to show for it?'' he asked ``Massive
corporate debt. Lower quality products. Workers thrown into the
streets. A less competitive America. And the profits these people
make are unbelievable.
   ``Altogether we've seen a half-million workers lose their jobs
as a result of merger mania in recent years,'' he said, citing
layoffs and plant closings in Eau Claire, La Crosse, Cudahy and
Milwaukee, Wis.
   He blamed the administration's Labor Department and National
Labor Relations Board, saying they ``won't stand up for the
American worker.'' And, he said, ``We've got an attorney general
who couldn't tell the difference between antitrust and antifreeze,
an antitrus division (of the Justice Department) that hasn't been
heard from in years.''
   Dukakis said that because the administration has permitted
``this takeover epidemic ... the Japanese must be laughing at us
all the way to the bank.''
   At a union hall in Green Bay, Dukakis criticized Meese, who has
been under criminal investigation for 11 months.
   ``This guy in the Justice Department is spending so much time
defending himself he can't do his job.''
   Suggesting Reagan should fire Meese, Dukakis said: ``One of the
jobs of a chief executive ... is not only you hire people but
occasionally you fire them.''
   Meese came under heavy fire in Congress this week after two of
his top aides quit the Justice Department, saying Meese's
continuing legal problems were hurting department function and its
image.
   But Meese got a boost Friday in Washington when independent
counsel James McKay announced he had found insufficient evidence to
date to warrant indicting Meese in connection with a $1 billion
Iraqi pipeline plan or a possible conflict of interest involving
his telephone company stock.
   Dukakis avoided mention of his Democratic rivals but, taking
questions from the audience at the Green Bay Labor Temple, said he
viewed Bush's claim to aspire to be ``the education president''
this way: ``With a large laugh.''
   ``Cutting and slashing student loans, destroying our commitment
to education, I don't see it,'' Dukakis said. ``What's he for? ...
It'll be quite a conversion.''
   He took a swipe at Education Secretary William J. Bennett,
saying: ``He's the exception to the rule that an education is good
for you.''
   Dukakis met with leaders of the National Farmers' Union, a group
representing family farmers, at a dairy farm near Wausau. Standing
with farmers in front of a dairy barn after their meeting, Dukakis
said he backed ``reasonable price supports'' for milk as well as
``reasonable'' controls on supply _ but did not say what those
levels would be.
   Union president Lee Swenson said Dukakis offered ``a very
receptive ear'' to farm concerns.

<HEAD>President Reduces Prison Terms Of Two Jewish Underground Members</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two Jewish men imprisoned for armed attacks on
Arabs in the occupied land West Bank were ordered freed Friday in a
Passover holiday gesture by President Chaim Herzog.
   Ira Rappaport was pardoned with four months remaining on his
sentence and Yitzhak Geniram still had 2{ months on his term, said
Ami Gluska, a spokesman for Herzog.
   ``This is really a holiday present,'' Rappaport's wife, Orit,
told Israel radio. ``We are very happy and every day Ira spends
with us is a present.''
   Gluska said the two had been pardoned in part because they
expressed regret for their actions. ``There is a general trend to
reduce sentences in the framework of the 40th year of the state,''
he said on Israel radio. Israel was founded in 1948.
   Rappaport and Geniram were convicted of belonging to a Jewish
terror ring that carried out attacks on Arabs in the occupied West
Bank of the Jordan River earlier in the 1980s. Members of the
group, called ``The Jewish Underground,'' were apprehended between
April 1984 and December 1986.
   The New York-born Rappaport was convicted of attaching a bomb in
June 1980 to the car of a former mayor of Nablus, Bassam Shakaa,
who lost his legs in the explosion.
   Rappaport was sentenced to four years in jail, but the court
suspended 1{ years of the sentence, taking into account ``personal
circumstances.''
   Rappaport came to Israel in the 1970s and was a founder of
Shiloh, a Jewish settlement in the West Bank.
   Geniram, a founder of the right-wing Gush Emunim settlement
movement, was sentenced to four years in jail and three years on
probation after being convicted of manslaughter and attempted
manslaughter.
   The court ruled he loaned his car to attackers who killed three
Arab students at the Hebron Islamic College and wounded 30 in a
July 1983 attack.
   He also was convicted of helping gather explosives for a June
1980 attack on Arab mayors in the West Bank and was involved in a
plot to blow up Moslem mosques on the holy Temple Mount in
Jerusalem.

   After nearly two decades in prison for the
assassination of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., James Earl Ray
says he would trade places with the hostages in Lebanon.
   ``I'm primarily interested in getting out of jail. I'll take my
chances over there,'' the 60-year-old Alton native told the Alton
Telegraph in a recent telephone interview.
   Ray is being held in Tennessee's Brushy Mountain State Prison on
a 99-year sentence for the April 4, 1968, slaying of King. Ray
pleaded guilty but maintains he did so only under pressure and is
innocent.
   Ray said he does not think about how he will be remembered.
   ``It's been a long time. After a while you get to think about
other things,'' he said. ``I work in the laundry now. You don't get
up and think about it everyday.''

   The right-wing Nationalist
Republican Alliance won exactly half of the 60 legislative assembly
seats in elections held on March 20, election officials announced
Friday.
   The Central Elections Council said the alliance, known by its
Spanish acronym Arena, won 30 seats but fell short of an absolute
majority.f the elections council and a director
of the governing Christian Democratic Party, said the Christian
Democrats won 23 seats and the conservative National Conciliation
Party seven.
   Arena earlier claimed the party won up to 35 seats. Local media
had projected the party would win 33-34 seats.
   In the new assembly, National Conciliation legislators could
form a voting bloc with the centrist Christian Democrats and make
passage of legislation by either Arena or the Christian Democrats
difficult.
   Samayoa said the results present an ``interesting situation
because no party will predominate and will have to have
negotiations.''
   President Jose Napoleon Duarte's Christian Democrats held 33
seats in the previous assembly and Arena 13.
   Arena founder Roberto d'Aubuisson said his party would petition
the council to have the election results annulled. If that was
rejected, Arena would take its case to the Supreme Court,
d'Aubuisson said.
   Alfredo Cristiani, Arena's president, had said on March 23 that
the Christian Demcorats were manipulating the vote count to deprive
his party of a parliamentary majority. ``We cannot let these
shameless individuals steal our legislators,'' he said.
   In an interview on local television Wednesday, Cristiani said
``The people are being defrauded. This could explode at any moment,
something difficult to stop (could) occur.''
   D'Aubuisson had said three days after the balloting, ``We don't
want to promote violence. But we want to play clean and they won't
let us.''
   The National Association for Private Enterprise had declared
earlier it would call a general strike if the elections council did
not report an Arena victory.
   Samayoa said Friday Arena would have to accept the final results
and ``re-evaluate its positions.''
   Arena leaders withdrew from the vote-counting process Tuesday
night and removed their representative from the elections council.
   One representative from each of the three major political
parties is allowed to sit on the elections panel. Two votes are
enough to approve any decision.
   Francisco Merino, the Arena representative, withdrew Tuesday and
claimed the other panel members were trying to make a ``game of the
vote tallies in order to change the results of the elections.''
   In a recent interview with The Associated Press, Samayoa
rejected the allegations of fraud and said it ``only exists in the
mind of those who have manipulated information about the results in
their favor.''
   While a computer count of votes for mayors in 262 municipalities
was incomplete, Samayoa said Friday Arena had won 178 of the races.

<TEXT>
   Japanese officials said Friday they intend to
continue seeking a compromise over U.S. demands for an end to their
country's import quotas on U.S. beef and oranges.
   Agriculture Minister Takashi Sato said despite the breakdown of
negotiations, his government would continue to discuss the issue
through diplomatic channels. He also told reporters he was ready to
return to Washington when necessary. The minister was scheduled to
leave Saturday for Tokyo.
   Sato met briefly Friday with Allen Wallis, U.S. undersecretary
of state for economic affairs. Their talk was described, however,
as a courtesy call rather than resumption of the foodstuff
negotiations with the office of the U.S. trade representative that
ended in deadlock Thursday night.
   U.S. officials said the next step will be next Friday in Geneva,
where the United States will urge the council of GATT, the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, to convene a panel to declare the
Japanese quotas illegal under international trading rules.
   U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter, who negotiated with
Sato, declared after the talks he was ``deeply disappointed that
the Japanese did not come forward with their proposal to liberalize
trade on beef and citrus.'' Japanese officials termed the U.S.
demand for total elimination of the quotas covered by an expired
four-year agreement unrealistic but declined to say whether they
had offered a timetable for the elimination.

   A spring blizzard hit the Texas and
Oklahoma panhandles on Friday, stranding motorists and knocking out
power in areas.
   As much as 6 inches of snow blanketed some areas and up to 20
inches were expected from the strong storm system that moved out of
the southern Rockies across northeastern New Mexico, the National
Weather Service said.
   ``They're going to have a white Easter there,'' said weather
service forecaster Larry Mooney in Norman, Okla., referring to a
blizzard warning posted for the Oklahoma Panhandle.
   Mary Anne Burdo, a Highway Patrol dispatcher at Guymon, Okla.,
where a foot of snow had fallen by late Friday afternoon, said
westernmost Cimmaron County ``is completely shut down.''
   ``We have a lot of stranded motorists in town and on the
highways,'' said police dispatcher Susie Simmons in Dalhart, in
northwest Texas. She said a lot of the travelers were on their way
to ski resorts.
   ``I guess they can cross-country ski here,'' she said.
   At least two major highways were closed, U.S. 87 through Dalhart
and U.S. 287 north of Stratford, because of blowing snow, the
Department of Public Safety said.
   Winds of up to 30 mph caused power outages from West Amarillo to
Dumas, authorities said.
   Thunderstorms, some producing hail, also rumbled across Texas
and Oklahoma Friday.
   The weather service issued a flood and flash flood watch for
much of southeast Texas, including metropolitan Houston, Galveston,
Beaumont and Port Arthur.

<TEXT>
   The defense minister on Friday said a
missing nuclear scientist, who allegedly gatherered information for
the CIA about purported plans by Taiwan to make nuclear weapons, is
in the United States.
   Defense Minister Cheng Wei-yuan said Col. Chang Hsien-yi, former
deputy director of the state-run Nuclear Energy Research Center,
may have gone to America for a better job or because of ``his lack
of confidence.'' He did not elaborate.
   ``We are not sure of the motive,'' Cheng told the legislature.
   He said Chang had telephoned and written friends in Taiwan from
the United States but he did not know where the scientist was
staying.
   Chang vanished in January and the government issued a warrant
for his arrest. Local newspapers claimed Chang worked for the CIA
and left the country with information about a government nuclear
weapons development program. They did not cite sources.
   Taiwan's Nationalist Chinese government has said it does not
have nuclear arms. The issue is sensitive because communist China
has said production of atomic weapons in Taiwan would be a
justified cause for invading the island, which the communist
leaders view as a renegade province.
   China has exploded its own nuclear devices.
   The American Institute in Taiwan, which handles diplomatic
matters in the absence of official U.S.-Taiwan relations, has said
it does not know Chang's whereabouts.
   A poll published Friday indicated Taiwanese are about evenly
divided over whether the government should make nuclear bombs.
   The United Evening News survey also indicated that most people
in Taiwan believe the country has the capability to make such
weapons.
   It reported 35 percent of 767 people polled by telephone said
Taiwan should make nuclear weapons and 34 percent were opposed,
with the rest undecided.
   About 58 percent believed Taiwan has the ability to develop such
weapons, it said.
   The poll was conducted last month and had a margin of error of
3.5 percentage points, according to United Evening News.

<TEXT>
   If Jesse Jackson is elected president and ``did
everything he said he wanted to do,'' the nation would be bankrupt
in three weeks ``based on all the social programs we would be
putting into effect,'' Mayor Edward I. Koch said Friday.
   However, because of party loyalty and because ``he'd be better''
than the likely GOP nominee George Bush, the Democratic mayor said
he would vote for Jackson if the Democrats nominate him at their
convention in Atlanta.
   ``I have said I would be stuck with whoever comes out of that
convention,'' Koch said.
   Reacting to Koch's remarks, Jerry Austin, manager of Jackson's
campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination, said the mayor
has ``solidified his position in the national exaggeration hall of
fame.''
   Koch told reporters that ``I think this country would be
ill-served to have Jesse Jackson'' in the White House.
   ``I think that in three weeks, based on all the social programs
we would be putting into effect (under Jackson), if you did
everything he said he wanted to do, we'd be in bankruptcy. People
know that's pie in the sky,'' Koch said.
   Koch added that ``he wants to disarm us'' and is ``on the wrong
side of every issue I know of with two exceptions: drugs _ he's
great in opposition to drugs _ and he's great in talking about the
need for family responsibility and particularly as it relates to
education.''
   The mayor also said that Jackson's standards are ``not my
standards. So I have said that it's very bad to contemplate having
Jackson being president.''
   Stanley Hill, co-chairman of Jackson's New York campaign, said:
``It's obvious that Mayor Koch is being very divisive in the city.
Once again, it is not helping the city.''
   While he termed the mayor's remarks unfortunate, Hill added:
``I'm not going to even try to reach his level of negative
campaigning.''
   Koch also said some people claim that criticism of Jackson might
be based on race, but he maintained that the black candidate's
positions on the issues are just as open to comment as those of
white candidates.
   ``He should be held accountable like any white candidate. Not
different. Exactly the same,'' he said.
   But, the mayor said, if Jackson is nominated, Jackson would win
Koch's vote in the presidential election ``for two reasons: party
loyalty _ and I have said I would be stuck with whoever comes out
of that convention. And the other is: he'd be better than Bush,''
the vice president, who is far ahead in this year's GOP
presidential race.

   Britain and the Soviet Union have agreed to
exchange information on nuclear safety, including the disclosure of
nuclear accidents, the government's Health and Safety Executive
announced late Friday.
   The agreement was initialed Thursday by British officials and
top Soviet nuclear safety experts.
   A government spokeswoman, speaking anonymously in keeping with
British government custom, said the agreement was wide-ranging and
covered the exchange of information on operating, building,
commissioning and decommissioning nuclear installations.
   The two countries agreed to exchange information on nuclear
accidents and any major release of radioactive material, she said.
The Soviet Union was criticized for its delay in reporting the
April 1986 explosion and fire at the Chernobyl nuclear plant, which
killed 31 Soviets and spread a cloud of radioactivity around the
world.
   The four Soviet officials met top officials at the Energy
Department and toured the Hinkley Point Magnox nuclear plant in
southwest England during a four-day visit to Britain. They have
returned to Moscow.

   Veterans of Britain's first ``Ban the Bomb''
movement 30 years ago, including former Labor Party leader Michael
Foot, marched Friday in front of thousands of demonstrators walking
toward a nuclear facility.
   Organizers said about 5,000 people participated in an
anti-nuclear rally Friday at Hyde Park in London. Thousands of
other protesters were expected to join the demonstrators on their
52-mile march that is to end Monday with another rally at the
Aldermaston nuclear base in Berkshire.
   The base houses the government's atomic weapons research center.
   Organizers said some protestors at the Hyde Park rally were
children of the demonstrators 30 years ago.
   Foot said Friday's protest was aimed at current problems. ``This
has nothing to do with nostalgia,'' he said. ``This march is a sign
that the campaign will go on until nuclear weapons are wiped off
the face of the galaxy.''

<TEXT>
   A minister hired three men to kill his
wife for $1,000 each, then shot himself to death as suspicion
focused on him, authorities said Friday in announcing the arrests
of the alleged killers.
   The Rev. Charles Sennett, 45, apparently borrowed the $3,000
from his girlfriend for the March 18 stabbing of Elizabeth Sennett,
45, at the couple's ransacked rural home, said Colbert County
Sheriff Buddy Aldridge.
   Kenneth Eugene Smith, 22, and John Forrest Parker, 19, both of
Florence, were charged with capital murder Thursday, and Billy Gray
Williams, 21, also of Florence, was charged with conspiracy to
commit murder, Aldridge said.
   They were being held without bail.
   Sennett killed himself in front of his son's home March 25.
   ``We had interrogated him earlier in the day and ... told him he
was a suspect and informed his family he was,'' said Aldridge. ``We
had set up a polygraph test for the following Tuesday.''
   The sheriff said Sennett approached Williams ``about hurting
someone,'' and Williams hired Smith and Parker to carry out the
slaying.
   Smith and Parker ransacked the Sennett home and took a videotape
player and other items to make the crime look like a burglary, the
sheriff said.
   The minister of the Sheffield Church of Christ had told police
he returned home to find his wife stabbed and unconscious on the
floor, investigators said. She never regained consciousness and
died that night in surgery.
   Aldridge said Sennett, in shooting himself to death, left a note
saying ``he had never hurt his wife and that he had gotten in with
some bad guys.''
   The sheriff said that police have not pinpointed a motive in the

   The woman told police Sennett borrowed $3,000 to ``pay on a

had done with the money.'' The woman, whom authorities declined to
identify, was not charged.
   The suspects told officers they threw the weapons used in the
slaying _ a hunting knife, a fireplace poker and a cane _ into a
pond outside the Sennett home, Aldridge said.

   Jim Jordan, who delighted radio audiences for
decades as the well-meaning but bumbling Fibber McGee in the
classic show ``Fibber McGee and Molly,'' died Friday. He was 91.
   Jordan had been hospitalized for about a week after a fall at
his home, said a family friend who declined to be identified.
   ``Fibber McGee and Molly'' was on the air for the NBC radio
network from 1935 to 1960 and was the top-rated show in the country
for seven of those years.
   It was the source of such familiar routines as McGee's
overstuffed closet, which always unloaded mercilessly on Jordan's
character whenever it was opened. Even McGee's address, 79 Wistful
Vista, became a place on the American cultural roadmap.
   ``Even though he had become very frail, his mind and his humor
were as fresh as ever,'' said Lenore Kingston, a vice president for
Pacific Pioneer Broadcasters. ``We all adored him.''
   Like the couple in the ``Fibber McGee and Molly'' scripts, the
stars of the show were married. Jim and Marian Jordan came to radio
out of vaudeville to formulate the comedy with writer Don Quinn.
   Mrs. Jordan died of cancer in 1961.

<TEXT>
   U.N. mediator Diego Cordovez on Friday held
separate meetings with Soviet special envoy Nikolay Kozyrev and
U.S. diplomat Robert Peck in his efforts to secure an Afghanistan
peace settlement.
   The superpowers could sign as guarantors if an accord is reached.
   Peck, a deputy assistant secretary of state, and Kozyrev have
been following the U.N.-sponsored indirect negotiations between
Afghanistan and Pakistan since the latest round began March 2 and
have routinely met with Cordovez.
   Pakistan acts on behalf of Afghanistan's Moslem guerrillas, who
have fought to topple the pro-Soviet government in Kabul for more
than eight years.
   Peck declined to say what impact, if any, a proposal by
Secretary of State George P. Shultz had on the talks.
   ``I'm not really able to talk about the details of the diplomacy
at the present time,'' he told reporters at the Geneva U.N. office
where the talks are being held.
   Shultz suggested Thursday that Moscow could keep arming Marxist
forces in Afghanistan after an estimated 115,000 Soviet troops
withdraw, provided the United States can maintain supplies to the
Afghan guerrillas.
   Washington said in the past it would not guarantee a settlement
unless the Soviet Union agreed to stop supporting the Afghan
governmewnt at the same time the United States ended aid to the
guerrillas.
   Soviet officials rejected that as attempted interference in
Soviet-Afghan relations and claimed America had raised a
last-minute obstacle at the U.N. talks.
   But Peck said: ``We're continuing to work very hard and we'll
stay here until we get an agreement. We should be able to put
something together.''
   Formal negotations are to resume Monday, but U.N. officials have
left open the possibility of continuing diplomatic contacts over
the weekend.
   The Soviets sent troops into Afghanistan in December 1979 to
help the government battle the rebels who were gaining control of
many areas.

   Zimbabwean forces joined Mozambican
soldiers in attacks that destroyed three major guerrilla bases in
southern Mozambique this month, the army announced Friday.
   The national news agency, AIM, said it was the first
confirmation of Zimbabwean participation in the 12-year-old civil
war between Marxist government forces and the Mozambique National
Resistance, which the government says is South African-backed.
   Zimbabwean forces have been in neighboring Mozambique for
several years, helping to guard the Limpopo Railway line which runs
for over 300 miles from the border to the port of Maputo.
   Zimbabwean and Mozambican railway workers are repairing the
track, which will give Zimbabwe a second outlet to the sea. The
other line, to the port of Beira, functions well, said AIM. It also
is guarded by Zimbabweans.
   AIM quoted a spokesman for the general staff of the Mozambican
armed forces as saying the joint force attacked the bases of
Chiconjo, Maginge and Nhahombe in Gaza province during the second
half of March, killing 260 bandits.
   There have been several reports of Mozambican guerrillas raiding
villages in Zimbabwe since that country sent troops into Mozambique.

   If Jesse Jackson is elected president and ``did
everything he said he wanted to do,'' the nation would be bankrupt
in three weeks ``based on all the social programs we would be
putting into effect,'' Mayor Edward I. Koch said Friday.
   However, because of party loyalty and because ``he'd be better''
than the likely GOP nominee George Bush, the Democratic mayor said
he would vote for Jackson if the Democrats nominate him at their
convention in Atlanta.
   ``I have said I would be stuck with whoever comes out of that
convention,'' Koch said.
   In Green Bay, Wis., Jackson told reporters he had not heard of
Koch's remarks. But when they were described to him he said,
``That's unfortunate. I should not dignify that statement.''
   Reacting to Koch's remarks, Jerry Austin, manager of Jackson's
campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination, said the mayor
has ``solidified his position in the national exaggeration hall of
fame.''
   Koch told reporters that ``I think this country would be
ill-served to have Jesse Jackson'' in the White House.
   ``I think that in three weeks, based on all the social programs
we would be putting into effect (under Jackson), if you did
everything he said he wanted to do, we'd be in bankruptcy. People
know that's pie in the sky,'' Koch said.
   Koch added that ``he wants to disarm us'' and is ``on the wrong
side of every issue I know of with two exceptions: drugs _ he's
great in opposition to drugs _ and he's great in talking about the
need for family responsibility and particularly as it relates to
education.''
   The mayor also said that Jackson's standards are ``not my
standards. So I have said that it's very bad to contemplate having
Jackson being president.''
   Stanley Hill, co-chairman of Jackson's New York campaign, said:
``It's obvious that Mayor Koch is being very divisive in the city.
Once again, it is not helping the city.''
   While he termed the mayor's remarks unfortunate, Hill added:
``I'm not going to even try to reach his level of negative
campaigning.''
   Koch also said some people claim that criticism of Jackson might
be based on race, but he maintained that the black candidate's
positions on the issues are just as open to comment as those of
white candidates.
   ``He should be held accountable like any white candidate. Not
different. Exactly the same,'' he said.
   But, the mayor said, if Jackson is nominated, Jackson would win
Koch's vote in the presidential election ``for two reasons: party
loyalty _ and I have said I would be stuck with whoever comes out
of that convention. And the other is: he'd be better than Bush,''
the vice president, who is far ahead in this year's GOP
presidential race.

<DATELINE>PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Police replaced Gen. Manuel Antonio
Noriega's heavily armed soldiers on the streets Friday for the
first time since last month's attempted coup against the Panamanian
strongman.
   The U.S. Defense Department announced it will send 1,300
additional military personnel to Panama, bringing the number of
American troops there to nearly 12,000.
   Panamanians took time out from political activity on Good Friday
to prepare for the Easter weekend. But for many that meant only
another day of hunger and shortages as a 12-day-old general strike
and bank closures made even basic necessities scarce.
   Opposition leaders said they would accept, with some conditions,
Monsignor Marcos Antonio McGrath, the Catholic archbishop of Panama
City, as a mediator in talks to resolve the political crisis.
   The conditions included guarantees that Noriega, head of the
nation's 15,000-member Defense Forces and the power behind the
civilian government, would indicate a willingness to resign and to
leave the country.
   Police foot patrols replaced soldiers who have filled the
capital since a coup attempt failed March 16. The change was an
indication of how the city has quieted for the holiday weekend,
after weeks of protest.
   The Pentagon said the 1,300 extra military personnel would
improve security for American bases and U.S. residents in Panama.
   Many of those to be dispatched beginning next week are military
police, but army helicopter units will be included, the Pentagon
said.
   The U.S. Southern Command, which is based in Panama, had about
600 security personnel among its 10,000 troopers before Washington
intensified its campaign for Noriega's removal.
   Over a 10-day period that ended March 24, the Pentagon
dispatched another 670 security personnel to Panama for the stated
purpose of protecting military facilities.
   Col. Ronald Sconyers, spokesman for the Southern Command, said
the latest troop increase was prompted by ``a longstanding look at
what has been going on down here.''
   He said it was not made in anticipation of an imminent departure
of Noriega and any instability that might follow.
   No evacuation plans have been discussed with Americans in
Panama, Sconyers said during a news conference at Southern Command
headquarters.
   While most troops and their 13,000 dependents in Panama are
assigned to live on bases, about 6,000 military personnel,
dependents and Defense Department employees live in civilian
areas.There are about 45,000 Americans living in Panama.
   Limitations on movement for the Southern Command troops were
decreased Friday to ``alpha'' level, the least severe of four
restrictions.
   The designation, in use for the first time since the crisis
began Feb. 26, permits free movement but advises military personnel
to avoid crowds and demonstrations.
   Virtually all businesses were closed for Good Friday. A general
strike called by opposition leaders eased earlier in the week, with
groceries and pharmacies reopening, reportedly under government
pressure.
   Banks have been closed since March 3, and Panamanians who had
cash appeared to be using it only for essentials.
   Roberto Aleman, an attorney for the opposition National Civic
Crusade, said the National Council of Private Enterprise, an
umbrella group of several business organizations, had decided to
continue the strike.
   Other opposition leaders said some business executives felt the
shutdown had made its point and could be ended.
   In a letter made public Friday, three leading Noriega opponents
said they would accept McGrath as a mediator in talks aimed at
settling the situation only if Noriega indicated, before the
negotiations, that he was willing to resign and leave the country.
   The letter was signed by Alberto Boyd, coordinator of the
National Civic Crusade; Ricardo Arias Calderon, president of
Panama's Christian Democratic Party; and Alfredo Ramirez, president
of the Liberal Republican Nationalist Movement.
   Any agreements reached during mediation would have to be
guaranteed by the church, four government officials to be named
later, and the presidents of Costa Rica and Panama, the letter said.
   It also demanded the release of all political prisoners before
talks started and total press freedom. Panama's opposition press
has been shut down for weeks.
   The church has called for the removal of Noriega, whose
supporters in the National Legislature ousted civilian President
Eric Arturo Delvalle on Feb. 26 after Delvalle tried to fire
Noriega.
   The United States subsequently froze Panamanian government
deposits in U.S. banks in an effort to drive out Noriega. The
shortage of money and a run on banks forced Panama's banks to shut
down.
   Noriega was indicted in Florida in February on drug-trafficking
charges, which he denies.

   China's first SOS Center, part of an
international network of facilities to provide medical services for
foreign tourists and residents, opened in Beijing Friday.
   Claude Giroux, founder and chairman of International SOS Co.,
and officials from the Public Health Ministry attended opening
ceremonies at the Beijing Emergency Medical Center, the official
Xinhua News Agency said.
   The center will provide medical service to foreigners in the
Chinese capital and, when necessary, will help them return to their
countries for further medical attention.
   International SOS Co. covers all medical and travel expenses for
members. Others can pay for SOS services with individual medical
insurance programs.
   The report said the company also plans to set up centers in
Canton, Shanghai, Chengdu and Xian to form a medical and transfer
network in the country.
   The company is to provide the Beijing Emergency Medical Center
with $32,000 in telecommunications and medical equipment and train
40 Chinese doctors in China and abroad.
   International SOS Co., founded in 1974, has 22 regional service
centers and more than 10 million members, the report said.

   Jim Jordan, who delighted radio audiences for
decades as the well-meaning but bumbling Fibber McGee in the
classic show ``Fibber McGee and Molly,'' died Friday. He was 91.
   Jordan had been hospitalized for about a week after a fall at
his home, said a family friend who declined to be identified.
   ``Fibber McGee and Molly'' was on the air for the NBC radio
network from 1935 to 1960 and was the top-rated show in the country
for seven of those years.
   It was the source of such familiar routines as McGee's
overstuffed closet, which always unloaded mercilessly on Jordan's
character whenever it was opened. Even McGee's address, 79 Wistful
Vista, became a place on the American cultural roadmap.
   ``Even though he had become very frail, his mind and his humor
were as fresh as ever,'' said Lenore Kingston, a vice president for
Pacific Pioneer Broadcasters. ``We all adored him.''
   Like the couple in the ``Fibber McGee and Molly'' scripts, the
stars of the show were married. Jim and Marian Jordan came to radio
out of vaudeville to formulate the comedy with writer Don Quinn.
   Mrs. Jordan died of cancer in 1961.
   Jordan met Marian Driscoll at choir practice when both were in
their teens in Peoria, Ill. They married in 1918
   Jordan began a singing career while serving with the Army in
Europe toward the end of World War I. After the war, he and his
wife took their act on the road, with Mrs. Jordan playing piano.
   The Jordans began appearing on radio in 1925 but still worked
vaudeville because the medium paid so little. During 10 years of
skits, they developed the Fibber McGee and Molly characters.
   ``It is typically American humor, neither the Broadway type nor
Hollywood influenced,'' wrote The AP's Hubbard Keavy in 1940.
   ``They get their humor from simple things, like fixing the
brakes or playing checkers. They never just tell jokes. They never
step out of character.''
   The situations in the show turned on such simple items as Fibber
deciding, against Molly's advice, to tune the piano. His bumbling
effort invariably was interrupted by the ``bong-bong'' of the door
chimes at 79 Wistful Vista.
   Their neighbors were a classic set of American humor characters.
   Hal Peary was the rumbling, pompous Great Gildersleeve; Cliff
Arquette was the cantankerous old-timer whose line was ``That ain't
the way I heard it, Johnny''; Bill Thompson was hen-pecked Wallace
Wimple, and Gale Gordon was Mayor Latrivia, whose rage against
Jordan's character ended with a sputtering ``McGee!?''
   ``Fibbert McGee and Molly'' ran on television in 1959-60 but the
Jordans were not in the NBC series.
   Jordan married again in 1962 to Gretchen Stewart, who survives
him. He is also survived by a son and daughter and several
grandchildren.
   Funeral arrangements were incomplete.

   More than 100 demonstrators were arrested in outside a
Philadelphia clinic in a Good Friday anti-abortion protest, while
dozens of peace activists were arrested in a Manhattan research
institute and at Texas and California weapons centers.
   ``We are calling on Christians to demonstrate the courage and a
willingness to sacrifice by not allowing children to be killed
before birth in our community on the day which Christians
commemorate Christ's Passion and Death,'' said Patricia O'Brien, a
spokeswoman for the Philadelphia demonstrators.
   In New York, more than 2,000 anti-arms race marchers walked for
peace at an annual Good Friday rally that ended with actor Martin
Sheen, the Rev. Daniel Berrigan and dozens of others arrested for
civil disobedience.
   The Sixth Good Friday Peace March began at the United Nations
and ended at the Riverside Research Institute, where the protest
organizers, Pax Christi Metro New York, said research is conducted
on President Reagan's proposed ``Star Wars'' anti-missile program.
   Pax Christi spokesman Jim O'Grady estimated that 90 to 100
protesters were arrested after walking inside the institute and
blocking the door in a non-violent protest. Police Officer Jim
Coleman confirmed the arrests, but did not have exact figures.
   Philadelphia police charged 116 people with disorderly conduct
and blocking the street in front of a clinic that performs
abortions, said Cpl. Robert Ward. The two offenses carry fines of
$25 to $100 each, he said.
   After police carried the demonstrators away, the clinic opened.
Abortion opponents said they would continue a prayer vigil outside,
but would not block the entrance.
   Three peace activists in the Texas Panhandle near Amarillo stood
in blowing snow and momentarily blocked traffic to the Pantex
nuclear weapons plant before being arrested, Carson County Sheriff
Connie Reed said.
   They were charged with obstructing a state highway, and were
jailed under $2,000 bond each, said Ms. Reed.
   A protest against nuclear weapons by about 350 people at
Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California resulted in 58
arrests on charges of blocking a road, officials reported.
   In Chicago, more than 400 people prayed and sang hymns during
the eighth annual Good Friday Walk for Justice to protest the U.S.
military presence in Central America, apartheid in South Africa and
racism in the United States.
   ``We are really targeting the American public. We're trying to
say we are a nation of faith, and therefore our faith should
impinge on our public policy, at least in terms of the voting
public,'' said Jean Hughes, an organizer.
   Demonstrators calling attention to homelessness set up tents in
Chicago and broke into a federally owned vacant house in
Minneapolis.

   The American Red Cross said Friday it had
begun a nationwide effort to reduce the chances that Red Cross
blood centers could accidentally distribute contaminated blood or
blood products.
   Last month, the Red Cross acknowledged it had distributed 24
pints of blood that had failed procedures against AIDS
contamination or carried hepatitis B antigens, but said that none
of the blood was used and none actually carried the deadly AIDS
virus.
   The Food and Drug Administration said the questionable blood was
shipped to hospitals and laboratories by Red Cross centers in
Washington and Nashville, Tenn.
   Five of the units tested positive for hepatitis B antigens.
Initial tests also showed that 10 of the units contained HIV
antibodies, which signaled an AIDS danger, but those units
underwent a process that breaks down the blood into components for
specific uses and eliminates the virus, the Red Cross said. The
remaining units were from donors who were unacceptable because they
previously tested ``false positive'' for the AIDS virus, but all
the actual units were tested as safe, officials said.
   Investigations into the failure of blood center workers to
follow standard operating procedures are being conducted by the Red
Cross and the FDA.
   The Red Cross said it had begun a five-part program to reduce
the chances of human error in the distribution process. The program
includes staff re-education sessions, formal reviews of procedures
to insure consistency with agency regulations, assessment of
potential for future errors and the strengthening of current
safeguards to prevent the release of unacceptable blood.
   ``Red Cross cannot rest until we have taken every possible step
to avoid errors in the future,'' said Victor W. Schmitt, vice
president of Red Cross Blood Services.

   The leader of the August coup attempt
that almost toppled the government of President Corazon Aquino
escaped from his prison ship, military sources said Saturday.
   Military spokesmen could not be reached for comment because of
the Easter holiday.
   But sources with ties to leaders of the Aug. 28 attempt said
Col. Gregorio ``Gringo'' Honasan escaped late Friday or early
Saturday. There were no further details.
   Honasan had been detained on a navy ship since his arrest last
December in a Manila suburb.
   One source said officers close to Honasan had been ordered to
report to military Chief of Staff Gen. Renato de Villa to discuss
the case.
   ``Definitely, there is going to be a news blackout,'' the source
said, speaking on condition of anonymity. ``But an officer who
picked up a navy captain and a colonel early this morning said they
were invited for questioning with regards to the escape of Col.
Honasan.''

   Campeau Corp. won its 2-month-old battle for
Federated Department Stores Inc. on Friday, but rival retailer R.
H. Macy & Co. Inc. will end up with two of Federated's divisions in
the Southwest.
   Campeau will acquire Federated, the nation's fifth-largest
retailer and parent of up-scale Bloomingdale's, for $73.50 a share,
or $6.58 billion, Campeau and Federated said in a statement.
   The acquisition would be the fifth largest corporate takeover in
U.S. history, and the largest deal not involving oil companies.
   Macy came away with the Bullock's and Bullock's-Wilshire
division and the I. Magnin chain, for which it will pay $1.1
billion, the statement said.
   Macy agreed to terminate a merger agreement it reached with
Federated last month, the statement said.
   A definitive agreement signed by the three companies also calls
for Macy to be paid $60 million for its expenses in the takeover
fight, the statement said.
   Maureen Milano, a spokeswoman for Macy, said the company was
pleased with the outcome.
   ``They felt that this is the most prudent decision for them,''
she said.
   Campeau, a Toronto-based real estate developer that also owns
Allied Stores Corp. in the United States, won Federated following
two meetings of the retailer's board this week.
   The deal ran along the lines of an agreement between Macy and
Federated last month which gave Macy the right to buy Bullock's and
Magnin if the two companies' merger agreement fell through. The
merger agreement was reached March 2 but Federated reopened the
bidding after Campeau raised its offer last week.
   The purchase of the two divisions gives Macy an expanded
presence in California and the Southwest. Most of Macy's nearly 100
department and specialty stores are in the eastern half of the
country.
   Allied president Robert H. Morosky, who would head the combined
Allied-Federated operations, said Campeau planned to sell off
Federated's supermarket, discount store and specialty store chains,
as well as some of its department store chains. That would leave
the company with the ``crown jewels'': Rich's, Lazarus,
Goldsmith's, Burdines, Bloomingdale's and Abraham & Straus, he said.
   The Canadian company previously agreed to sell the Foley's and
Filene's department stores to May Department Stores Co. if it won
the fight for Federated.
   After Campeau bought Allied in 1986, it sold off most of
Allied's store divisions to pay off debt, and ever since Campeau
launched its bid on Jan. 25, analysts had predicted the same fate
would befall Federated.
   ``I'm sad about the fact that a fine department store like
Federated is being split up and decimated,'' said Walter Loeb, a
retail industry analyst with the investment firm Morgan Stanley &
Co.
   Before Friday's announcement, Macy had offered to buy Federated
for $6.73 billion, while Campeau bid $6.62 billion.
   Campeau had offered Wednesday to pay $74 a share in cash for
Federated's stock.
   Macy offered Thursday to pay $78.92 a share in cash for 80
percent of Federated's 89.5 million outstanding shares. It offered
to pay $60 in cash or exchange five shares in the merged company,
Macy's-Federated Inc., for each remaining Federated share. That
would have produced a deal with an aggregate value of $75.14 a
share.
   Federated stock closed at $72.87{ a share Thursday on the New
York Stock Exchange. The stock market was closed for Good Friday.
   The fight for Federated began Jan. 25, when Campeau offered $4.2
billion to buy the retailer, which rejected the offer as inadequate.
   Campeau raised its bid, but Federated spurned its advances until
the end of February, when the retailer agreed to negotiate with
Campeau.
   But when the Federated board was to meet to review that
proposal, Macy entered with its own bid.
   Court battles ensued, and both suitors continued to raise their
offers until the Federated board called for ``final bids'' to be
presented Wednesday.

   The leader of the August coup attempt
that almost toppled the government of President Corazon Aquino
escaped from his prison ship, the military announced Saturday.
   A statement said Col. Gregorio ``Gringo'' Honasan escaped about
2:30 a.m. aboard two rubber boats along with 13 other people,
including some of his guards.
   Chief of Staff Gen. Renato de Villa ordered a massive search for
the 39-year-old Honasan and alerted subordinate commands nationwide
to be on the lookout for him.
   Honasan had been detained on a navy ship in Manila Bay since his
arrest last December in a Manila suburb.
   One military source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
officers close to Honasan had been ordered to report to military
Chief of Staff Gen. Renato de Villa to discuss the case.
   The breakout followed rumors in the capital that Honasan would
attempt to escape.
   Honasan, former chief of security at the Defense Ministry,
played a key role in the Feb. 22, 1986, mutiny which triggered the
popular uprising that toppled President Ferdinand Marcos.
   But Honasan became disillusioned with Marcos' successor,
President Corazon Aquino.
   On Aug. 28, Honasan led a force of 2,000 men who attacked the
presidential palace and seized several media and military
installations in the capital before they were driven off by
pro-Aquino forces.
   The coup attempt left 53 people dead and wounded hundreds, and
Mrs. Aquino said it was aimed at killing her and her family.
   Honasan's effort was the most serious of several major plots to
unseat Mrs. Aquino's government.
   Honasan has accused Mrs. Aquino of ``weak and inept'' leadership
and says he tried to save the country from communism.

   The start of daylight-saving time this
weekend has an effect so strange in Indiana that many residents
could use the extra hour to explain it to outsiders.
   While most Indiana counties remain on Eastern Standard Time,
residents of 16 counties move their clocks forward an hour.
   Eleven of those counties are in the Central time zone, and move
their clocks to be even with Chicago's Central Daylight Time and
Indianapolis' EST.
   The five other counties are in the Eastern zone and move their
clocks up to Eastern Daylight Time to keep pace with nearby
Louisville, Ky., and Cincinnati.
   The result is that some people in the same time zone have
different times on their clocks, while people in different zones
have the same time. This occurs among neighbors in a state less
than 150 miles wide.
   Indiana residents just call the two times ``fast'' and ``slow.''
   ``It creates confusion for us until October,'' said Barbara
Schuler, office manager at WSCH radio in Lawrenceburg. ``We make it
a point to tell listeners if an event is on fast or slow time.''
   She said the confusion hits hardest when family members are
operating on different clocks, such as when a parent working in
Cincinnati has a child in a school using standard time.
   ``It's an absolute mess,'' said Donna Benning, a bookkeeper at
an auto dealership in Milan. ``The kids tell me to pick them up at
3 p.m. and I always show up an hour early.''
   Daylight-saving time was standardized by Congress in 1966, but
in 1972, Indiana joined Hawaii and Arizona in exercising an option
to exempt themselves.
   However, the Legislature left some border counties near Illinois
and Kentucky to go daylight-saving time.

   Independent counsel James McKay said Friday he
has found insufficient evidence to date to warrant indicting
Attorney General Edwin Meese III in connection with a $1 billion
Iraqi pipeline plan or a possible conflict of interest involving
his telephone company stock.
   Meese said he was ``gratified by the action and the statement''
of the independent counsel and that he would not step aside.
   ``It is certainly my intent to carry on my duties as long as the
president wants me to,'' the embattled attorney general told a news
conference.
   McKay said his report was an interim one and that his
investigation was continuing.
   ``The grand jury's investigation is not yet complete as to'' the
pipeline probe, the telephone stocks and ``other matters, and will
continue at least through the end of April,'' McKay's statement
said. A source close to McKay's investigation would not provide
details of these matters, but said they were all felony cases.
   The grand jury is expected this month to hear testimony from
Meese, his wife, Ursula, and U.S. Circuit Judge Douglas H.
Ginsburg, former head of the Justice Department's anti-trust
division that handled the breakup of American Telephone & Telegraph
Co. while Meese held telephone stock.
   Even though McKay's announcement was an interim report, it was
an enormous boost to Meese, who has been reeling from bipartisan
calls in Congress for him to quit in the wake of the resignations
Tuesday of two of his top aides.
   McKay told a news conference that he decided to issue his
statement on Friday ``without any outside consultation.'' But he
acknowledged that Meese's attorney has asked several times for such
a public statement, including ``quite recently.''
   A source close to McKay said Meese's attorneys ``have known of
this decision for a period of time.'' The source said they argued
McKay should tell the public as well because ``we know it and you
know it.''
   This source said of McKay, ``He's concerned about the fairness
factor. ... He didn't want people speculating about what he would
or would not do with respect to these matters.''
   The source said McKay could be reappointed or retain his
appointment to deal with any evidence that might surface after the
grand jury is dismissed. McKay's staff is debating whether to say
in his public report that he might have obtained an indictment but
did not do so because he was uncertain of winning a conviction, the
source said.
   Several key figures in the criminal investigation of Meese,
including his longtime friend, E. Robert Wallach and Meese's former
financial manager, W. Franklyn Chinn, have refused to cooperate
with McKay's inquiry. Wallach and Chinn are under indictment in the
Wedtech scandal.
   The aides who stepped down Tuesday were concerned that Meese's
legal problems _ he has been under criminal investigation for
nearly 11 months _ are hurting the Justice Department's operations
and image.
   Among those who resigned was Assistant Attorney General William
Weld, who oversaw all federal criminal investigations, and Deputy
Attorney General Arnold Burns.
   Meese had planned to announce replacements for Burns, Weld and
departing Associate Attorney General Stephen Trott, but the
announcement was called off at the last minute without explanation.
   The replacement for Burns was expected to be Arlin Adams, a
former U.S. Circuit judge in Philadelphia, department sources said.
The replacement for Wells is to be James Knapp, a deputy in the
Justice Department's tax division who formerly worked in the
criminal division. The replacement for Trott is to be Francis
Keating, an assistant treasury secretary for enforcement.
   Meese would not discuss in detail the reasons why the two top
aides left, claiming his conversations with them were confidential.
   But he did say that ``there were some basic differences''
between Burns, Weld and the attorney general ``as to the effect
that recent events had on the department ... in part they were the
fact that there was an independent counsel investigation.''
   Meese told reporters that for him to resign would be
``incompatible with the actual state of affairs'' and he cited
``broad support'' from law enforcement officials, from within the
administration ``at the highest level'' and from members of
Congress.
   The White House declined comment on McKay and Meese's
statements. And after President Reagan arrived at his mountaintop
ranch near Santa Barbara, Deputy Press Secretary Leslye Arsht said
only that ``the president was notified by phone in the air. We have
no reaction. He has always said he has confidence in Meese.''
   In an interview taped for broadcast Friday night on ABC-TV's
``20@20'' program, Meese said he did not feel he was hurting the
president, but that if he thought he was, he would resign.
   ``If at any point, I felt that it was an embarrassment to the
president, or an embarrassment to the department, I would not
rigidly stand and stay here just for the purpose of staying here,''
Meese told interviewer Barbara Walters.
   ``I've had people from literally all over the country calling me
to say, `You owe it to the Justice Department, to the president, to
hang in there. ... You owe it to stay, and not give in to the lynch
mob.'''
   Asked who the lynch mob was, he said, ``Certainly some aspects
of the press.''
   He said the Justice Department's problems were ``all of the
false statements and false accusations on the outside. And I think
it would be wrong if I, in effect, capitulated to what the
president has called a lynch mob. I think that would be far worse.
I think it's very important if we're gonna make government safe for
public officials, that no person should be able to be hounded out
of office by false accusations, by incessant media barrages, many
of them based on distortions and falsehoods, or by political
attacks.''

<HEAD>Young Irish Woman Recoving from Critical Injuries in St. Pat's Day
Accident</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A 22-year-old Irishwoman, critically injured in a
St. Patrick's Day traffic accident during a trip here, is awake
after 10 days in a coma and is exchanging smiles with visitors,
officials and friends say.
   Margaret Hanley was listed in fair condition Thursday, said
Anita Robins, a spokeswoman at Weiss Memorial Hospital.
   ``They're saying very little, except the doctor is saying she's
becoming a little more alert,'' Ms. Robins said.
   Gerry Archbold, a director of the Irish-American Heritage
Center, said that when he visited Miss Hanley on Tuesday, ``she was
conscious and a smile came to her face. She recognizes voices, but
she has a long way to go after this.''
   An aspiring actress in Dublin, Miss Hanley came to the United
States in February to visit her jailed boyfriend and had planned to
return home March 18. She was on her way to buy a bottle of milk
March 17 when she was hit by a car.
   She was conscious in the ambulance and joked with attendants
about not being able to dance for a while, but then lapsed into a
coma.
   A broken leg created a blockage in blood vessels carrying oxygen
to her brain, said Miss DeWitt. Doctors didn't know how long the
woman had a diminished supply of oxygen from the blood clot.
   ``There's hope she will recover fully, but it's too early to
say,'' nursing supervisor Dorothy DeWitt said Wednesday. ``The fact
that she has been up and talking is a very, very good sign.''
   Another nursing supervisor, Nancy Durbin, said Miss Hanley
attempts to talk, mouthing her words.
   The nurse said she does not know if the young woman has
mentioned Daniel Stokes, an Irish immigrant to America whom she met
last year when he was back in Ireland for a visit.
   Stokes, 21, now is in Cook County Jail, charged with
first-degree murder, residential burglary, armed robbery, home
invasion and possession of a stolen vehicle. He is accused of
killing his landlord and has pleaded innocent.
   Archbold said the Irish-American center helped ease the way for
the woman's parents, Stephen and Ann Hanley, who flew to this
country when they learned of the accident. He attributed her
improvement to the prayers of sympathizers.
   ``We prayed hard for her. There were special prayers during the
Palm Sunday Mass at the center,'' Archbold said. ``Just shortly
after the Mass was over, she started to regain consciousness.''
   Miss Hanley's room has assumed a more cheerful atmosphere,
filled with stuffed animals sent by well-wishers.

<HEAD>NOAA Team Helps Save Indian Satellite</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A team of federal experts at an Alaskan space
communications center helped to rescue an ailing Indian satellite
that was out of control earlier this month, a U.S. official said
Thursday.
   Larry Heacock, director of satellite operations for the National
Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration, said the Indian
satellite, called IRS1A, was launched by a Soviet rocket on March
17 and placed into an orbit of about 560 miles.
   Satellite controllers in Germany, he said, discovered that the
IRS1A was unable to focus a guidance sensor on the Earth, a
sighting it was to use for an accurate orientation. As a result,
the craft was unstable and could not be controlled properly.
   Heacock said the satellite passed over the NOAA satellite
communications station in Fairbanks, Alaska six times every 24
hours.
   The German Space Agency, which was operating the satellite for
India, asked the NOAA station to take and send data to IRS1A.
   ``Each time it went by, NOAA took data and sent it to the German
space agency,'' said Heacock.
   Using this data, the Germans were able to properly orient IRS1A.
   ``The satellite is now normal,'' said Heacock.
   The IRS1A is to be used by the Indians to gather remote sensing
data. It was placed in a near-polar orbit which enables it to scan
the whole Earth once every 22 days.
   Heacock said the normal operation of the Fairbanks NOAA station
is to collect signals from the NOAA 9 and 10 weather satellites.
   For the Indian satellite, the NOAA engineers used a spare
antenna, and India paid the agency about $200,000 for the work,
Heacock said.
   The NOAA station earlier performed data collection for a French
remote sensing satellite called SPOT.

<HEAD>Mint To Buy Coin Materials From Foreign Countries As Needed</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Reagan directed Treasury Secretary
James A. Baker III on Thursday to buy materials for U.S. coins from
foreign countries when required by international agreement, despite
a ``Buy America'' provision enacted by Congress.
   In a statement issued as he signed a reauthorization bill for
the Bureau of the Mint, Reagan noted that the legislation requires
preference for U.S. producers and suppliers over those in any
country that has its own protectionist measures governing
procurement for coinage.
   ``This requirement, standing alone, conflicts with certain of
our nation's international obligations,'' he said.
   Under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, for example,
the United States agreed to require the Mint to give equal
treatment to the products and supplies of other countries that are
signatories of the agreement.
   Some countries did not designate their mints as covered by this
agreement, but may have designated other agencies that the United
States elected not to have covered, the president said.
   Thus, he said, the preference provided in the bill ``could be
viewed by our trading partners as violating our obligations.''
   Canada did not designate its mint as covered by the agreement,
but Canada and the United States recently signed a free trade
agreement which is now being considered by Congress. The president
said following the preference provided in the bill ``could also
bring into question our obligations'' under the U.S.-Canadian trade
agreement.
   The president said it was fortunate that the bill would permit
the secretary of the treasury to waive the Buy America provision
when he found that it would be inconsistent with the public
interest or the cost would be unreasonable.
   ``The public interest of the United States includes adhering to
our international obligations, and these obligations should be
taken into account by the secretary of the treasury in making
procurements'' affected by the bill, the president said.

   House advocates of granting banks broad new
securities powers said Thursday their efforts have been given a big
boost by overwhelming passage of legislation in the Senate.
   ``We're on the move,'' said Rep. Stephen Neal, D-N.C., who plans
to offer a bill mirroring the Senate measure when the House Banking
Committee meets next month to consider the issue.
   The Senate voted 94-2 late Wednesday to allow bank holding
companies to underwrite and sell mortgage-backed securities,
commercial paper and municipal revenue bonds.
   It would permit underwriting of corporate bonds and mutual funds
six months after enactment by both houses of Congress and signature
by President Reagan, who favors the bill.
   ``I think ... the vote in the Senate shows a very broad-based,
liberal-conservative, bipartisan base for this kind of change,''
Neal said.
   But those pushing a more cautious approach say the Senate action
may have little effect, pointing out that a Senate deregulation
effort in 1984 died in the House for lack of support.
   ``Four years ago the Senate voted 89-4 for a bill that never
came out of the House. I'm not sure what influence it has now,''
said Rep. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y. He said he believes provisions in
the Senate bill safeguarding federally insured deposits from the
risk of securities activities are too weak.
   Schumer is backing a bill drafted by House Banking Committee
Chairman Fernand J. St Germain, D-R.I. It would grant banks only a
few securities powers _ commercial paper, mortgage revenue bonds
and asset-backed securities _ and place more restrictions on banks.
   The Senate bill substantially lifts limits on banks in place
since 1933 when the Glass-Steagall Act separated commercial from
investment banking in the belief that bank involvement in
securities helped fuel the speculative binge that ended in the 1929
stock market crash and the bank failures of the 1930s.
   Proponents of change say developments in the financial system,
particularly in the last decade, threaten the ability of banks to
compete. Securities firms, for instance, offer bank-like services
such as commercial paper and money market mutual funds. They argue
that sufficient safeguards can be put in place to prevent the
abuses of the 1920s.
   The Senate measure requires a separate vote in 1991 before bank
holding companies could underwrite corporate stock, the most
lucrative securities activity.
   Rep. Edward J. Markey, D-Mass., whose Energy and Commerce
subcommittee on finance has partial jurisdiction over the issue,
called passage of the Senate bill a positive step, but said the
House will devote its attention to ``developing strong and
resilient firewalls'' between banking and securities activities.
   Consumer groups on Thursday praised provisions in the bill _
unrelated to securities _ aimed at benefiting bank customers.
   ``We're very excited,'' said Peggy Miller of the Consumer
Federation of America
   One section prohibits lenders from unilaterally changing the
pay-back and other terms of home equity loans. It requires lenders
to warn borrowers that they could lose their house if they fail to
pay and imposes other disclosure requirements.
   Another provision bars misleading savings and checking account
advertisements and requires banks to disclose the interest rate,
fees and other information.
   The bill would also require banks to prove they are meeting the
needs of poor citizens and neighborhoods before getting permission
to exercise the new powers.
   And, it directs banks to cooperate if state laws require them to
mail material to customers inviting them to join state financial
consumer organizations.

<HEAD>Sandinistas File Damage Claim At World Court</HEAD>
<DATELINE>THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nicaragua has given the World
Court an estimate of damage caused by the Contra war as a first
step in claiming reparations from the United States, a court
spokesman said Thursday.
   The spokesman, who spoke on condition he was not identified, did
not give the number. Sources at both the court and Nicaraguan
Embassy cited World Court rules that forbid disclosure of written
material before hearings have been held in a case.
   During 1985 hearings on a complaint about U.S. aid for the
Nicaraguan rebels, known as Contras, Sandinista officials speaking
privately put the damage at $250-$300 million.
   A 1986 ruling by the court, a U.N. agency formally named the
International Court of Justice, ordered the United States to halt
all support to the Contras. The rebels began fighting in 1981, and
last week reached a preliminary cease-fire agreement with the
Sandinistas.
   In the ruling, the 15-judge court also directed the parties to
settle the issue of reparations for damage caused by the rebels.
The decision came after more than two years of proceedings on the
Nicaraguan complaint.
   The Reagan administration boycotted the final 17 months of
proceedings, contending the court had no jurisdiction, and refused
to discuss the issue with the Sandinistas. The court began the
award procedure this year at Nicaragua's request.
   It is expected to take several years. The next step is the
filing of written arguments by the United States, for which the
court has set a July 28 deadline.
   Sources familiar with the dispute said it was unlikely the U.S.
government would be willing to enter the reparations argument after
having rejected the court's jurisdiction in 1984. The court has no
enforcement powers and depends on voluntary adherence to its
rulings.
   In a related development, Nicaragua withdrew a request for an
emergency ruling on its case accusing Honduras of allowing the
Contras to have bases on Honduran territory.
   That request was filed March 21, after the United States sent
3,200 troops to Honduras in response to an alleged incursion by
Nicaraguan soldiers in pursuit of rebels.
   In it, Nicaragua had asked the court to investigate alleged
border crossings by Honduran armed forces and requested that an
international observer force monitor the border.
   Nicaragua filed its action against Honduras last year. It had
been suspended on by request of both parties after five Central
American presidents signed a regional peace plan Aug. 7.

<HEAD>Two Officers Sentenced To Hang For Killing Drug Dealers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two police officers were
sentenced Thursday to hang for the killing of two reputed drug
dealers.
   One of the officers, Sgt. Robert van der Merwe, had testified
that he carried out the slayings because his co-defendant, Capt.
Jack La Grange, told him the victims were helping the African
National Congress, the main anti-apartheid guerrilla movement.
   According to evidence presented during the three-week trial, La
Grange was hired by alleged drug dealer Peter Pillay to arrange the
killing of two men said to be his rivals, Bennie Ogle and Ernest
Molokoane.
   Van der Merwe testified that on Sept. 28, 1987, while he was
with La Grange, he shot Ogle and Molokoane. Ogle died and Molokoane
suffered five gunshot wounds but survived.
   Van Der Merwe said that on Oct. 4 he killed Pillay, again at La
Grange's instructions.
   Supreme Court Justice Irving Steyn, who presided over the
non-jury trial, said it was possible van der Merwe had been duped
by La Grange into killing Ogle but ruled that the sergeant had no
excuse for Pillay's slaying.
   An execution date is pending. Steyn said the two police officers
could appeal their murder convictions for the death of Ogle, but
not for the killing of Pillay.
   La Grange, 40, had claimed he was being framed by superiors,
while van der Merwe, 30, contended that he thought he was taking
part in an approved clandestine operation.
   Van der Merwe told the court that he knew of previous
``clandestine operations'' in which security police carried out
missions to kill suspected ANC operatives.
   By law and custom, apartheid establishes a racially segregated
society in which the 26 million blacks have no vote in national
affairs. The 5 million whites control the economy and maintain
separate districts, schools and health services.

<TEXT>
   A special police detail is using an obscure
ordinance against walking in the bushes to arrest suspected
homosexuals in a city park.
   An official of the American Civil Liberties Union said Thursday
the tactic is discriminatory and probably illegal.
   Police said they see it as a way to clear Langford Park of
homosexuals who meet there. A city study concluded that the
boardwalks that wind through the forested park have become a
hangout for homosexuals and male prostitutes.
   Plainclothes officers on the special detail walk the wooden
boardwalks and wait for men to walk into the bushes and sheltered
spots.
   The law against walking in the bushes is part of a catch-all
loitering ordinance. It is not posted in the park.
   One 35-year-old man who did not want to be identified said he
was sitting in an open area of the park listening to a radio when
two uniformed officers demanded to see his identification and asked
if he had ever been arrested.
   They wanted to know why he was in a city park 10 minutes from
his home and if he was married, he said. ``They asked me if I was a
homosexual. Twice,'' the man said.
   He said the officers threatened to arrest him if they saw him
``walking aimlessly'' or spending more time there than they
believed was proper.
   ``How do you walk with purpose in a park?'' Ron Ross, president
of the local chapter of the ACLU, asked Thursday. ``Police are
using unposted laws and are creating their own criteria for arrest,
like `walking aimlessly.'''
   ``The innocent person doesn't have a chance,'' Ross said,
arguing that police have created a situation in which no single men
are innocent.
   Officers arrest suspected homosexuals on whatever charge they
can when they are unable to prove the men are prostitutes, said
police Capt. Duane McGray.
   The tactic has been used for more than a year because it is
difficult to make prostitution arrests, he said.
   Robert Stabile, 37, was picked up while strolling through the
foliage last week. He was jailed on a charge of prohibited
activity, although police could simply have issued him a notice to
appear in court and let him go home.
   ``I wasn't doing anything. I was just walking,'' Stabile
complained. ``They said I was out there too long.''
   The arrest report said a plainclothes officer on the special
detail saw Stabile ``walk into the bushes off of the park path. The
subject walked throughout the wooded area. I then arrested him for
prohibited activity in the park.''
   Stabile could serve 60 days in jail and pay up to a $500 fine if
convicted.
   Ross said the police practice is ``discriminatory, definitely
discriminatory, especially in a city park that is supposed to be
for the benefit of all citizens.
   ``It is outrageous to discriminate against a certain class of
people _ rather, who they suspect to be members of a certain class
of people,'' Ross said.
   Police attorney John Ross, who is not related to the ACLU
president, said anyone who claims that the law is being selectively
enforced has to prove it.
   ``The burden is on them to actually show that there are names
and addresses of people we have not arrested,'' he said.

<HEAD>Communist Party Takes Blame For Hungary's Woes, Calls For Reform</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Communist Party said Thursday it
was to blame for Hungary's economic woes and proposed reforms in
party elections including secret ballots and multi-candidate slates.
   A draft policy statement published Thursday by Nepszabadsag, the
Hungarian Communist Party daily newspaper, said the party had
failed to assess ``the impact of world economic changes on the
Hungarian economy,'' causing an economic crisis.
   The statement, a rare public admission of a mistake by a
governing communist party, added: ``The Central Committee and its
executive organs, the government and its institutions are
responsible for all this.''
   The draft is to serve as an outline of discussions at a national
party conference opening May 20 to review the Communists' role in
the changing society.
   The party draft said Hungarian leaders recognized ``belatedly''
that economic growth could not come without more economic and
political changes.
   The statement advocated a new system of party elections to be
implemented before the next congress in 1990.
   ``The practice of nominating more candidates should widen and
secret elections be held at all levels,'' the draft said.
   A 1986 party resolution setting a two-term limit on some lesser
party posts should be extended to cover regional party secretaries
as well, the draft said.
   The document also noted the party ``should not assume the scope
of tasks of the state and social organizations'' and pull back from
daily administration.
   The policy statement did not say whether the conference would
include a discussion on replacing Janos Kadar, the 75-year-old
Communist Party leader who has held power since 1956.
   But an unsigned editorial in the economics weekly Figyeloe said
Thursday that ``important decisions'' on personnel questions were
expected at the conference.
   The party meeting must create a new political system capable of
forging consensus among Hungarians of different opinions and
interests, Figyeloe said.
   Hungary borrowed heavily in the 1970s to build up heavy
industry. Now, its 10.6 million people are burdened with a gross
hard-currency debt of $16 billion, the highest per capita in the
Soviet bloc.
   As part of a government austerity program that took effect Jan.
1, Hungary became the first East bloc country to impose personal
income taxes. The government also said prices are to rise at least
15 percent this year.
   The austerity program is the work of Prime Minister Karoly
Grosz, 57, who took over the government in July and is seen as a
possible successor to Kadar.
   The last party congress was held in March 1985.

   A woman who concealed her husband's death
for eight years and tended the corpse as if he were alive pleaded
guilty Thursday to two felony forgery charges related to the death.
   A former Chicago-area dentist accused of assisting her in the
forgery pleaded innocent.
   Carole Stevens, 42, of Knoxville entered the plea in Knox County
Circuit Court. Judge Harry Bulkeley placed her on two years'
probation and sentenced her to 12 days in jail, for which she
received credit for 12 days served.
   Bulkeley also ordered Mrs. Stevens to undergo psychiatric
treatment. She could have received up to five years in prison and a
$10,000 fine.
   Mrs. Stevens was charged with fabricating a power of attorney
for her dead husband in 1984 and using it to refinance a home
mortgage.
   Her alleged accomplice, Richard G. Kunce, 56, a former Aurora
dentist who was a guest in the Stevens house, was charged with
signing his name as a witness.
   In February, Mrs. Stevens and Kunce pleaded guilty to
misdemeanor charges of failing to report the 1979 death of Carl L.
Stevens, a diabetic who authorities say died shortly after he
joined a holistic health cult and stopped taking his daily insulin
shots.
   Mrs. Stevens was placed on a year's probation on the misdemeanor
charge. Kunce has asked a judge to withdraw his guilty plea.
   Stevens' withered corpse was found Jan. 29 on a bed in the home,
where officials said his widow, a registered nurse, had cared for
the body daily for the past eight years, changing its clothes and
moving it from room to room.
   Mrs. Stevens' children, ages 17 and 14, are in foster care
receiving psychiatric treatment.
   In a separate case, Mrs. Stevenson on Thursday admitted to child
neglect for allowing her children to live with their father's
mummified remains for eight years.
   She was granted permission to continue seeing her children under
supervision pending a decision on whether she will retain custody.
   Kunce also awaits a court appearance on a felony charge of
cruelty to children for allegedly teaching the Stevens children
``black magic and suicide'' and for allowing them to live in the
same house with the corpse.
   If convicted on the cruelty charge, he could receive up to three
years in prison and a $10,000 fine.

   Two American balloonists on Thursday
called off their plans to circle the Earth non-stop in two weeks or
less, saying $100,000 worth of helium leaked out of one of their
balloons.
   They said they hoped to try again next year.
   Col. Rowland Smith, 50, said a patch in one balloon ripped
Wednesday as the two 360-foot-high balloons were being inflated at
El Plumerillo Air Base outside Mendoza, 660 miles west of Buenos
Aires.
   Smith and project organizer John Petrehn, of Topeka, Kan., said
about $2.5 million had been spent in transportation, materials and
personnel for the double-decker balloon flight.
   ``Technically it's impossible to attempt to fly around the
world'' this year, a disappointed Smith said at a brief news
conference. He said they hoped to try next year.
   Petrehn, 52, is a businessman, while Smith is a former Vietnam
War pilot and a Kansas-based pilot for Trans World Airlines. The
balloonists had hoped to do what no one else has: circle the Earth
around the 45-degree parallel in the Southern Hemisphere.
   They planned to follow the 45th parallel for about 17,545 miles,
traveling southeast from Mendoza, crossing the Atlantic and Indian
Oceans and New Zealand's Campbell Island, then cross the Pacific
until Chile, dropping over the Andes to return to Mendoza in nine
to 14 days.
   They hoped to travel at speeds up to 60 knots an hour, following
the prevailing eastern winds at altitudes of up to 30,000 feet in a
pressurized radar-equipped polyethlene gondola three yards by two
yards wide.
   The longest manned balloon flight was in 1981, when the Double
Eagle V crossed the Pacific for about 5,000 miles.

<HEAD>Government Bans All Outdoor Political Gatherings For Year</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government on Thursday
banned all outdoor meetings for a year, except those involving
sporting events or funerals.
   Justice Minister Kobie Coetsee announced the order under terms
of the Internal Security Act, which prohibits a wide range of
activities. It takes effect Friday and will be in force through
March 31, 1989.
   Under national emergency regulations already in effect, outdoor
rallies are illegal unless approved by a magistrate or Law and
Order Minister Adriaan Vlok.
   It was not immediately clear if the latest order expanded
government authority to restrict rallies.
   Magistrates still will have the power to consider exceptions to
the ban.
   The order appears aimed at nationwide municipal elections
scheduled for all race groups in October. By restricting rallies to
indoors, the government apparantly seeks to limit the size of
crowds and reduce the potential for violence.
   It is the latest move in recent government crackdowns aimed at
limiting political activity.
   Last week, a judge, acting on a government request, banned an
outdoor rally by the Afrikaner Resistance Movement, a
white-supremacist paramilitary organization. The group eventually
met indoors.
   On Feb. 24, the government banned 18 leading black
anti-apartheid groups from participating in political activity.
   By law and custom, apartheid establishes a racially segregated
society in which the 26 million blacks have no vote in national
affairs. The 5 million whites control the economy and maintain
separate districts, schools and health services.
   Also Thursday, Minister of Constitutional Development Chris
Heunis said residents of the small black township of Oukasie,
outside the northeastern city of Brits, must be resettled in
keeping with government policy.
   Heunis said Monday in Parliament the government would not try to
relocate the remaining 8,000 residents.
   He said Thursday his statement was misinterpreted. He reiterated
government policy that Oukasie remained officially abolished and
residents would be moved to Lethlabile, a newly established
township 15 miles away. But he said it would not be done by
``force.''
   Heunis abolished Oukasie by decree in October 1986, but only
about 5,000 residents moved to Lethlabile. Oukasie residents
repeatedly have said they prefer their old homes and have no
intention of moving.
   The government says the cost of upgrading Oukasie would be
``astronomical.'' Oukasie residents say the government wants them
out because the township has expanded to within 250 yards of a
white suburb in Brits.

<HEAD>House Panel Wants More OSHA Inspectors At Meatpacking Plants</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Occupational Safety and Health
Administration should switch more inspectors to meatpacking plants
because job injury rates there are the highest of any industry in
the country, a House committee said Thursday.
   The House Government Operations Committee also called on OSHA to
establish minimum training standards for packinghouse workers and
consider setting standards on work loads and chain speeds in
packinghouses.
   The committee concluded in a 45-page report that tens of
thousands of meatpacking workers are being injured each year
because they are ``regarded by some as disposable, someone who is
used and then discarded.''
   Citing Upton Sinclair's 1906 novel ``The Jungle'' on labor toil
in Chicago packinghouses, the committee said ``more than 80 years
later ... meatpacking employees still work'' under the same
conditions of slick floors and dangerous chain speeds that cause
them to accidentally slash themselves and one another.
   Terry Mikelson, an OSHA spokesman, said the agency will take the
committee's recommendations ``under consideration.''
   ``We already devote special resources to meatpacking,'' he said,
explaining that packinghouses are inspected three times more often
than plants in other manufacturing industries. ``Everybody
recognizes that its a high-hazard industry and that employers need
to do a better job.''
   The report was based on three days of hearings conducted last
year by the House panel's employment and housing subcommittee
focusing on OSHA and IBP Inc.'s flagship packinghouse at Dakota
City, Neb.
   At the time of the first hearing, IBP and the United Food and
Commercial Workers Union were engaged in a bitter lockout that
turned into a strike involving 2,900 workers.
   The strike has since been settled, but not before the union
succeeded in focusing both congressional and OSHA attention on
safety conditions in the plant and the industry.
   Last July, OSHA fined IBP $2.6 million _ then the biggest
penalty ever levied by the agency _ for safety and record
violations at the Dakota City plant. The company has appealed the
fine.
   Part of the fine resulted from OSHA's determination that the
company kept two sets of injury records at the plant, one for
internal use and the other for the purview of OSHA inspectors when
they visited.
   In testifying before the subcommittee, IBP Chairman Robert
Peterson denied that two sets of books were kept. Later, Peterson
recanted that testimony, saying it was based on misunderstandings
within the company.
   The committee concluded last week that Peterson's explanation
``strained credibility'' but added that the panel lacked sufficient
evidence to seek a perjury indictment of him.
   OSHA, meanwhile, announced last week that it would quit relying
only on company-maintained injury records in deciding whether a
plant should be inspected further.
   Beginning this past Monday, the agency's inspectors are to
``walk through'' the high-hazard areas of each plant after
reviewing their safety logs.
   The committee, like officials in some other government agencies,
concluded that exempting companies from inspections based on
employer-maintained records encouraged companies to under-report
injuries and illnesses.

<HEAD>New Study Discounts Advantages Of Joint Custody For Children</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ANTHONY MARQUEZ</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Judges shouldn't be so quick to order
couples in bitter divorces to share custody of their children,
because the arrangement can do more harm than good to the
youngsters, a researcher said Thursday.
   Far too often, said psychologist Judith Wallerstein, the courts
are ``putting children in the middle of the battlefield.''
   Wallerstein, head of the Center for the Family in Transition,
helped conduct a study of joint custody arrangements, which have
become increasingly popular in recent years.
   Findings from the study were presented here Wednesday at the
annual meeting of the American Orthopsychiatric Association.
   Researchers at the non-profit research and counseling center,
located in Corte Madera, studied the children of 100 couples who
went through bitter divorces and had custody arrangements decided
by the courts. In about one-third of those cases, joint custody was
ordered.
   Researchers assessed the psychological health of the children by
testing, interviews and talks with their parents, and found that
children were psychologically worse off _ more depressed, withdrawn
and uncommunicative _ if joint custody was imposed.
   The researchers also studied 93 children whose parents parted
amicably and chose their own custody arrangements. Again, about
one-third of the cases involved joint custody.
   Children in that group were not affected by custody
arrangements, the study found.
   In all, 33 states have enacted legislation that permits courts
to order joint custody, evidence of the growing trend in its favor,
Wallerstein said.
   ``It's very important for children of divorces to maintain a
continuous relationship with both parents, but that doesn't have to
be with the child going back and forth,'' Wallerstein said Thursday
in an interview.
   ``What's important is the relationship'' between parent and
child, she said. ``It is quality of relationship sustained over
time.''
   Jeremy Fogel, supervising judge for Family Court in Santa Clara
County, said the study confirmed his observations. ``An equal time
share will not solve the problems of a very conflicted relationship
between parents,'' Fogel said.
   A family law attorney in Oakland, Carole H. Rochlin, said he
fears some people may use the findings to argue against joint
custody.
   ``We'd get back to the days where either one parent or the other
has custody _ where we had these destructive custody fights,'' said
Rochlin. He heads a group called Equal Rights for Fathers, which
favors joint custody.

<HEAD>District School Board Votes To Furlough All Employees For Up To
One Week</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD KEIL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The District of Columbia school board,
claiming budget shortfalls, voted Thursday to furlough all
employees for one to seven days.
   The board also voted to cut some summer school sessions, reduce
purchases, and institute a hiring freeze because of a $15 million
gap in the fiscal year 1988 supplemental budget, according to
acting school superintendent Alfred Jenkins.
   Furloughing all city school employees for up to seven days could
save the school district $8.1 million in pay and other costs,
Jenkins said.
   ``I don't feel very good about it at all,'' Jenkins said. ``I
only know the reality is we just don't have the money. We have to
make plans for any eventuality.''
   Jenkins said the school board did not decide whether the
furloughs would take place on consecutive days, or whether they
would be spread out between now and Sept. 30, the end of the 1988
budget year.
   City council member Hilda Mason, who chairs the council's
education and libraries panel, said she did not know whether the
school district would run into accreditation problems if schools
were closed.
   One possibility is that the furloughs would come during the
summer, when most students aren't in school, while another scenario
is that the temporary layoffs could be staggered in order to keep
schools open, Mason said.
   Council chairman David Clarke called the school board's decision
``the height of irresponsibility,'' and said that the council has
approved a total of $37.7 million in additional school spending for
fiscal years 1988 and 1989.
   The school board requested an additional $25.1 million in the
1988 budget supplement, but the council approved only $10 million
of that request.
   Including the supplemental increases, the 22,000-pupil school
system will receive $579.5 million in the 1988 budget year.

<HEAD>Students, Teacher to be Tested For AIDS After Pupil Jabbed Them</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WESTERLY, R.I. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   About 25 high school students and a
teacher are being tested for AIDS after a 16-year-old jabbed them
with a surgical instrument taken from a biology classroom, the
principal said Thursday.
   ``There is no indication that anyone was sick with anything, but
it's better to be safe than sorry,'' said Albert Ferraro Jr.,
principal at Westerly High School.
   Ferraro said the student, who was not identified, jabbed a
teacher in the side and drew blood Monday with a lancet, a
two-edged, pointed device used to prick the skin for blood samples.
   About 25 students reported Monday and Tuesday that they had been
poked as well, and a police officer who frisked the boy in the
school office Monday came in contact with the lancet in the
teen-ager's pocket, Ferraro said.
   The student was suspended for 10 days Monday after the teacher,
whom Ferraro would not identify, filed assault charges.
   The teacher, police officer and students were given tetanus and
hepatitis shots at Westerly Hospital on Monday and Tuesday, Ferraro
said.
   On Wednesday, he said, the students began returning to the
hospital, where their blood was being drawn and sent to the state
Department of Health for the AIDS test. The results can take up to
two weeks, a hospital spokeswoman said.
   Ferraro said he recommended the testing after talking to the
school doctor.

   However, the report by Federal Home Loan Bank Board Inspector
General Paul Gibbons did reveal ``ineffective business practices''
by the Federal Asset Disposition Association.
   The investigation was requested in September by Rep. James
Florio, D-N.J., after a critic of FADA complained that he was being
investigated by a private detective.
   William T. Juliano, a Mount Laurel, N.J., developer who was
threatening a lawsuit against FADA, charged that the agency,
through its law firm, hired a detective agency to probe his
financial affairs.
   Juliano, according to Florio, reported that his office was
broken into on Sept. 14 and that eavesdropping equipment was found
in the ceiling.
   Gibbons, however, said New Jersey State Police had found no
evidence of wiretapping at Juliano's office and local police had
closed their break-in investigation for lack of evidence.
   Jon Shure, a spokesman for Florio, said the congressman had just
received the report and had not had a chance to review it.
   But, he added, ``We are still pursuing our own look into FADA.
It is still very much a live issue. Nothing would be in that report
that would make us say, `OK we're not interested in FADA anymore.'''
   Shure said there has been no result reported from a parallel
investigation of the charges by the Justice Department. He said
Florio has asked Congress' investigative arm, the General
Accounting Office, to review the bank board report.
   Karl Hoyle, a bank board spokesman, said the report made no
judgment about the propriety of hiring a private detective agency,
whose investigators in questioning Juliano identified themselves as
representing a firm selling credit card.
   Hoyle said the detective agency was hired without the knowledge
of bank board officials and that the board subsequently directed
that no investigators be hired without its permission.
   The bank board report also found no evidence to support
allegations leveled by two others: Pasquale Verona, a Fort Myers,
Fla., real estate investor, and Joe R. Dobson, a Austin, Texas,
developer.
   Verona charged that FADA officials offered him a bribe, in the
form of a consulting fee, if he would back off from complaints he
made to members of Congress about the agency.
   Dobson, according to Florio, said his office was broken into and
ransacked after he told FADA officials he had secretly taped his
conversations with them.
   Members of Congress, real estate investors and others have
criticized FADA for being too sluggish in selling property from
bankrupt S&Ls, thus depriving the cash-short federal fund that
insures S&L deposits of money. They have said the agency is riddled
with conflicts of interest and wastes money.
   Among the poor business practices acknowledged by the bank board
report were failure to return telephone calls to investors
interested in buying property managed by FADA and poor
dissemination of bidding information.
   The House Banking Committee, meanwhile, has been preparing its
own, broader report on FADA, which according to an industry
newsletter is being held up by the committee chairman, Rep. Fernand
G. St Germain, D-R.I.
   Rick Maurano, an aide to St Germain, said the congressman was
unavailable Thursday evening to comment on the FADA investigation.
House Banking Committee aides did not return telephone calls on the
subject.

   Eleven men were charged after a
19-year-old woman told police she was raped repeatedly by a group
of men who urged onlookers at a ranch to join in, authorities said
Thursday.
   Some of the men watching illegal cockfights in a shed nearby
heard the women's cries for help but did nothing; others joined in
the assault Saturday night, said Ricardo Carrillo, Duval County
assistant district attorney.
   ``Some were holding her by the legs and by the arms, and some
were covering her eyes and mouth,'' Carrillo said.
   The woman told authorities that a group of men abducted her half
a block from home and took her to a ranch north of town.
   Authorities believe the woman, who has two children, was
stripped naked and raped repeatedly for several hours in the back
seat of a car, said Carrillo.
   ``Everybody's a little shocked and outraged by it,'' said
assistant district attorney Rodolfo V. Gutierrez.
   Seven men have been charged with sexual assault, three have been
charged with sexual assault and kidnapping and one has been charged
with kidnapping.
   Officials say 20 to 30 men were at the ranch.
   ``A lot of people were present that did not participate, didn't
assault her, but at the same time they didn't do anything to help
her or do anything to stop the other people from assaulting her,''
Gutierrez said.
   ``Even though legally they may not be responsible, morally they
didn't do anything to try and prevent this from happening or to
stop it once it started.''
   He said the woman knew some of her assailants but said some
covered their faces while attacking her.
   ``Some of them we've brought in have admitted it,'' Carrillo
said. ``Some are not talking.''
   Carrillo said the woman was walking home from her uncle's house
when several men abducted her and took her to the ranch.
   The woman reported four men later took her to another location,
raped her again and dropped her off near her home early Sunday,
Carrillo said.
   She was treated at Humana Hospital in Corpus Christi and
released earlier this week, authorities said.
   People in the remote town of about 5,000 are frightened by the
incident, said a 44-year-old woman who asked not to be identified
because in the town ``everybody knows everybody.''
   ``You expect something like this to happen in Corpus or San
Antonio or Dallas, but not in San Diego,'' said the woman.
   All of the men charged are from San Diego, officials said.
   Ten suspects were arrested Wednesday and Thursday or turned
themselves in. At least four were released on bail of $20,000 each.
   One man was not in custody Thursday evening but was expected to
turn himself in, Gutierrez said, adding that there may be more
arrests.

<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An American attorney for Gen. Manuel Antonio
Noriega said Thursday he has advised the Panamanian leader to be
wary of possible attempts to kidnap him and bring him to trial on
drug charges in the United States.
   Neal Sonnett of Miami said he based his advice on history _
citing previous U.S. kidnappings of fugitives _ and the refusal
recently of Elliott Abrams, assistant secretary of state, to rule
out any option for removing Noriega.
   The lawyer said a kidnapping attempt would not necessarily come
while Noriega is in Panama. It could come as the general sought
refuge in another country, he said.
   ``I don't know that the United States would send marshals, armed
guards or troops to snatch him from Panama,'' Sonnett said.
   He said he would ``insist not just on a (U.S.) promise not to
extradite but also on a guarantee of safe passage'' if Noriega
leaves Panama.
   Noriega, the military power behind the civilian government, has
been indicted on drug and racketeering charges in Miami and Tampa.
   U.S. State Department spokesman Rudy Boone on Thursday refused
to comment on Sonnett's suggestion that kidnapping was a U.S.
option.
   Sonnett cited the U.S. decision in 1985 to force down a plane in
Sicily that was transporting four accused Palestinian hijackers as
``an indication of the length to which the United States will go to
secure a fugitive.''

   A horse trainer Thursday admitted taking part
in a scheme to collect $81,000 in insurance by sending eight horses
to their death over a cliff.
   Bobby Griffin, 45, of Lufkin, Texas, pleaded guilty along with
Leonard Keith Autterson, 48, of Lakeside, Calif., to conspiracy to
defraud an insurance company.
   Each faces up to five years in prison at sentencing May 23, but
Assistant U.S. Attorney Patrick Coughlin said he will recommend
probation. Both men have agreed to testify at the trial of four
co-defendants, Coughlin said.
   The staged truck accident occurred in 1983 off Interstate 8 near
Jacumba, about 70 miles east of San Diego. Seven horses died at the
scene; the eighth horse was destroyed.
   Coughlin said Griffin was listed as the buyer of the horses
because the alleged conspirators needed the name of someone in the
horse business to make the accident look legitimate.
   ``I was supposed to get $10,000 to use my name as the
contractor,'' Griffin told U.S. District Judge Gordon Thompson Jr.
   ``They were supposed to be selling them to me and ship them to
Texas. I didn't put it together; I just agreed to it,'' said
Griffin. He said he did not get any of the money.
   Autterson told Thompson he was offered $7,500 by another
co-defendant to drive the horses off a cliff.
   ``Did you cause the accident?'' asked Thompson.
   ``I drove the truck up to the cliff and made sure the horses
were in it,'' he answered.

   Political extremist Lyndon LaRouche said Thursday
the defense at his conspiracy trial would show that Vice President
George Bush condoned infiltration and harassment of LaRouche groups.
   ``Vice President George Bush is going to be dropped into this
trial,'' LaRouche said without offering evidence to support this
allegations. ``This is no longer a credit card case. This is the
George Bush-Oliver North case.''
   LaRouche is on trial on federal charges he conspired to obstruct
a grand jury investigation into alleged credit card fraud by his
1984 presidential campaign.
   His remarks Thursday were his first since defense lawyers gained
access to government documents discussing alleged infiltration of
LaRouche groups by FBI and CIA operatives.
   According to trial testimony, the documents do not mention Bush,
but LaRouche said the vice president had to be aware of the alleged
infiltration because he presided over an interagency panel that
discussed intelligence matters.
   Prosecutors contend intelligence operatives quoted in the
documents lied in claiming to have been asked by the FBI and CIA to
infiltrate LaRouche groups.
   But LaRouche said the documents proved his contention that the
Reagan administration plotted to ruin him because he refused to
support the president's Contra-aid program.
   LaRouche said the defense also would prove that Bush, contrary
to his public statements, had a central role in the shipment of
arms to Iran and the diversion of the profits to the Contra rebels
in Nicaragua.
   ``The people who are running the operations are accountable to
him,'' said LaRouche, who espouses theories of world conspiracies
and has accused prominent world leaders of being Soviet agents.
   The vice president's office did not return telephone calls from
The Associated Press.
   Testimony in the trial of LaRouche, six aides and five LaRouche
political organizations has been halted while a judge holds
hearings on defense allegations that prosecutors withheld evidence
of infiltration of LaRouche groups.
   The hearings are expected to continue at least through next week.
   Bush's office and numerous federal agencies have been ordered to
search their files for references to LaRouche, a candidate for the
Democratic presidential nomination.

Off-Broadway</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Sandra Bernhard is a pouty priestess of pop
culture, wickedly dissecting life and what passes for art and
artifice at the end of the 1980s.
   In her show, ``Without You I'm Nothing,'' which opened Thursday
at off-Broadway's Orpheum Theater, Bernhard slouches and scowls
through 90 minutes of brash comedy and rock music that is not only
off-the-wall but occasionally beyond it.
   This outrageous woman, all lips, legs and long arms, is best
known to late- night TV watchers for harassing David Letterman.
She's also remembered as the actress who stole ``King of Comedy,''
Martin Scorsese's movie about a TV talk show host, from Robert
DeNiro and Jerry Lewis.
   With her new theater performance piece, Bernard offers a string
of unconventional, often very funny, observations about show
business and the people who are consumed by it.
   It's a peculiar subculture which she celebrates and puts down at
the same time. But then, as Bernhard explains to the audience, her
father was a proctologist and her mother an abstract artist, so
that's just how she views the world.
   She seems to rap about anything that comes into her head, and
the evening wanders from monologue to monologue. The performer,
dressed in black pants and a denim jacket, is surrounded on stage
by a small rock band. Between conversations, Bernhard breaks into
song, much of it surprisingly effective. Her repertoire ranges from
such golden oldies as ``The Lion Sleeps Tonight'' to material she
wrote herself.
   Bernard's targets in this show, which she co-authored with
director John Boskovich, range from Broadway to cabaret to rock 'n'
roll icons to fashion to her own childhood back in Flint, Mich.,
and later Scottsdale, Ariz.
   She tweaks the noses of many show biz personalities, some more
famous than others. Not many comedians would open their show with a
parody of Andrea Marcovicci, a cabaret artist who is certainly not
a household name in Middle America.
   Bernard also takes on more familiar performers _ Joni Mitchell
comes in for a hilarious drubbing, for example _ and kayoes such
diverse cultural phenomenon as Esprit, the selling of fashion as
affectation, and Vanity Fair, ``the least pretentious magazine in
America.''
   The material grows more serious, too. There's a wonderful
sequence where Bernhard fantasizes about being friends with Stevie
Nicks of Fleetwood Mac and celebrates the women of rock 'n' roll.
   The actress is not on everybody's wavelength. Bernhard doesn't
travel in a straight line. She swoons, swerves, backtracks and then
races ahead at 100 mph. But it's fun trying to keep up with her
with her more fanciful observations. ``Without You I'm Nothing''
makes for a wild night ride of off-beat humor.

<HEAD>Britain To Investigate If Files Involving Waldheim Are Missing</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Britain said it would investigate Thursday after a
British newspaper said that Kurt Waldheim may have cooperated with
U.S. and British intelligence in return for having incriminating
evidence erased from his war record.
   John Wakeham, a Cabinet member and leader of the House of
Commons, told Parliament the Home Office will conduct an inquiry
into official military files that The Times of London reported are
missing from the Public Records Office.
   The paper said the files may relate to the World War II record
of Waldheim, a lieutenant in the German army who later became
secretary-general of the United Nations and now is president of
Austria.
   The Times said that in one file on military activities in
Yugoslavia between May 1944 and the end of the war, an entire
section listed in the index as ``allegations of murder of British
prisoners of war'' was missing.
   Waldheim served as an intelligence officer in the Balkans and
was posted at Dubrovnik, Yugoslavia, during that period.
   The Times quoted Robert Herzstein, history professor at the
University of South Carolina, as saying several records of the
British contribution to the U.N. War Crimes Commission also
appeared to be missing from government records.
   Britain ordered an inquiry earlier this year into the cases of
six captured British commandos executed in 1944 after being handed
over for interrogation to the German army unit in which Waldheim
served.
   The newspaper said it also has evidence that British wartime
documents and Foreign Office papers which probably related to
Waldheim's wartime role had been suppressed.
   It said this suppression raised suspicions that Waldheim may
have collaborated with the Americans and the British after the war
ended in 1945 in return for having his German army record purged of
incriminating evidence.
   The newspaper quoted Herzstein as saying he believes Waldheim
passed on large amounts of information after the war to Allied
intelligence agents based at Bad Tolz, West Germany, especially on
the communist partisans in Yugoslavia and guerrillas in Greece.
   Herzstein is due to publish a book next week that suggests
Waldheim worked for the Americans after the war.
   A panel of historians has concluded Waldheim was ``in close
proximity'' to Nazi atrocities in the Balkans, knew they were going
on and made no attempt to prevent them. It said Waldheim concealed
his wartime past and tried to make it seem harmless once he could
no longer hide it.
   The panel left open the question of whether he was guilty of any
crime. Waldheim has denied any wrongdoing.

   A judge said Thursday he had no alternative
when he sent a 4{-year-old boy to a state mental hospital.
   Authorities said the child is apparently the youngest ever
committed in Maryland.
   ``There was a lack of any other resources under the
circumstances,'' Montgomery County Juvenile Court Judge Douglas
Moore said in a telephone interview from Rockville. He said the boy
was committed Tuesday evening.
   The child was receiving individual attention at the Springfield
Hospital Center in Sykesville, said Mike Golden, spokesman for the
Department of Health and Mental Hygiene.
   The action stemmed from an investigation by the county
Department of Social Services into charges that the boy had been
neglected, said J.C. Shay, spokesman for the state Department of
Human Resources.
   ``This is an emergency placement, until we can find something
better,'' Shay said. ``The boy needs in-patient psychiatric care.''
   Officials could not remember any child that young ever before
being committed in Maryland, said Dr. Henry Harbin, director of the
state Mental Hygiene Administration.
   Winifred DePalma, an attorney with the Maryland Disability Law
Center, called the move ``mind-boggling.''
   ``I have never heard of them committing a child that young,''
she said. ``They have no facilities for a child that age. There are
some very emotionally disturbed youths in the adolescent unit. In
no case should a 4-year-old child ever be committed there.''

   Plentiful cocaine supplies in the United
States helped a major Sicilian Mafia drug ring that exported
massive quantities of the drug to Italy and traded it for heroin to
sell to U.S. markets, the FBI says.
   The FBI and Italian authorities said they cracked the ring on
Thursday, arresting more than 100 people in both countries and
charging dozens more.
   Attorney General Edwin Meese III said trading cocaine for heroin
was ``a simple matter of economics.'' Because of the plentiful
supply and leveled-off consumption in the United States, cocaine is
less expensive here, about $20,000 a kilogram, than in Europe where
it costs about $50,000 a kilogram, he said.

   The nation's unemployment rate fell to a new
decade-low 5.6 percent in March even though there were 306,000
fewer Americans at work than a month earlier, the government said
Friday.
   The drop from February's 5.7 percent rate was credited entirely
to a 455,000 decrease in the number of people in the labor force _
those either holding jobs or seeking work _ raising inflationary
alarms among some economists.
   ``It's just one month, but it indicates that wages are not high
enough to coax second earners out of the home any more,'' said
Roger Brinner, an analyst for Data Resources Inc., an economic

<HEAD>`Thy Kingdom Come' _ PBS's Period Piece on Televangelists</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BARR</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   ``Thy Kingdom Come,'' an earnest documentary
about television evangelists, is so out of date it's hard to
understand why public television is airing it now.
   The film, which will be broadcast Wednesday night on most PBS
affiliates, is more dated now than it was last year, when
``Frontline'' decided not to air it because parts were obsolete.
   At the time Briton Antony Thomas made the film, Jim and Tammy
Bakker ran the fastest-growing television ministry. At the time,
Jessica Hahn was not yet a national celebrity.
   ``Thy Kingdom Come'' has been updated to mention the utter
collapse of Bakker's empire, but it does not reflect the scandal
that recently hit TV evangelist Jimmy Swaggart.
   The version of ``The Kingdom Come'' made available for review
will have to be updated again to amend Thomas' comment that Pat
Robertson, the former evangelist turned presidential candidate,
``seems to be going from strength to strength.''
   That was well before the South Carolina primary which Robertson
promised to win.
   After all the developments of the past year, it's also old news
that TV evangelism is a fund-raising treadmill, begging for money
to buy television time in order to beg for more money.
   The film concentrates on the alliance between various
fundamentalist and pentecostal Christians and the political right,
but mostly from the perspective of 1980. Included is a clip of
candidate Ronald Reagan's ``I endorse you'' speech to a gathering
in Dallas organized by TV evangelist James Robison.
   It's now the end of the Reagan era, and Thomas does not address
the pertinent question: What were the fruits of this alliance
between a president and the religious right?
   Thomas also notes that the religious right supported Republican
Bob Martinez in his candidacy for governor in Florida, but doesn't
try to assess how important that support was in his victory. It
leaves the impression that it was decisive.
   The film slights a point that became evident as the PTL story
unfolded: the religious right is not a monolithic movement. The
Rev. Jerry Falwell was rejected by many of Bakker's followers,
Bakker feuded with Swaggart, and Swaggart traded insults with Oral
Roberts.
   ``Thy Kingdom Come'' avoids total obsolescence through Thomas'
sympathetic interviews with a few grass-roots believers: one a
former alcoholic, another a victim of child abuse and rape, a woman
who says she was addicted to drugs for 20 years, and a man who felt
empty despite material success.
   ``Before I met Jesus I felt empty, I felt hurt and lost,'' says
the rape victim. ``He's healed me of hatred and bitterness I've
carried for 35 years.''
   ``Thy Kingdom Come'' is paired with ``Thy Will Be Done,'' a film
about the First Baptist Church of Dallas and its minister, the Rev.
W.A. Criswell, a leader of the dominant fundamentalist wing in the
Southern Baptist Convention.
   Here, Thomas takes on the issue of the relationship between
religion and wealth. He is candid about his own belief that the
gospels are on the side of the poor, and that Jesus meant what he
said when he talked of the unlikelihood of the rich getting to
heaven.

   MOST PLEDGES _ PBS stations are celebrating their best month of
fundraising. In March, 683,003 public television viewers pledged
$37.8 million to stations across the country. In March 1987,
pledges totaled $35.5 million. Membership drives are also held by
some stations in August and December, but March is the main
fundraising period. The previous high pledge month was March 1986
when viewers called in $37.1 million in memberships.
   SATURDAY NIGHT HIGH _ ``Saturday Night Live,'' now in reruns
because of the Writers Guild strike, scored its highest quarter of
ratings since 1982 the first three months of this year with shows
featuring such names as Robin Williams and James Taylor, Judge
Reinhold and 10,000 Maniacs, Justine Bateman and Terence Trent
D'Arby, Tom Hanks and Randy Travis. For the period from Dec. 27
through March 20, the show had an average rating of 8.4 and a 24
share, the highest quarter since the first quarter of 1982 when it
averaged an 8.4 and 24.
   The rating is a percentage of the 88.6 million U.S. households
with televisions. The share is the percentage of sets in use.

<HEAD>Tim Matheson Stars in New Comedy About Relationships</HEAD>
<NOTE>With LaserPhoto</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By JERRY BUCK</BYLINE>

   Tim Matheson hopes his new ABC comedy, ``Just
in Time,'' will disprove the network belief that once a couple gets
together, the relationship is no longer interesting.
   ``Just in Time'' brings Matheson and co-star Patricia Kalember
together not only in a personal involvement but in a professional
relationship that often has them at swords' point.
   ``They think the steam goes out of the relationship once they
get together,'' said Matheson, whose romantic comedy _ he's
co-executive producer with Fred Barron _ premieres Wednesday.
   There's an element of truth in that network belief.
   When Diane Chambers and Sam Malone got together on NBC's
``Cheers,'' the producers had to keep pulling them apart to keep
the story going. ABC's ``Moonlighting'' has suffered since David
and Maddie went to bed, although the show's problems are more
complicated than that.
   ``Fred Barron, who had worked on `Kate & Allie,' created the
show and he wanted to set up a contemporary relationship,'' said
Matheson. ``Fred thinks that things don't start to get interesting
until the couple gets together. Having been married 2{ years, I can
say that's certainly so.''
   The show is set in a Los Angeles magazine publishing company.
   ``I play a hot shot Chicago editor who's brought in to take
what's basically a conservative, staid monthly and turn it into a
hip, contemporary weekly,'' Matheson said.
   ``Patricia's the star columnist and their professional
relationship soon evolves into a romantic liaison. It's difficult
because we work together. And she has a long-distance relationship.
She's playing it safe, and he's just come out of a divorce and
tends to be a little more reckless.''
   The relationship between the two will change in the course of
the series' spring run. ``In the beginning, she's resistant and has
a million reasons why they shouldn't,'' he said. ``He says let's go
for it.''
   Matheson is best-known to movie audiences from his role as a
womanizing fraternity brother in the hit movie ``National Lampoon's
Animal House.'' He later starred in ``A Little Sex.''
   Matheson has a long line of TV credits dating back to 1961 when
he was a child and starred in ``Window on Main Street,'' with
Robert Young. He did guest shots on ``Leave It to Beaver'' and was
a regular on ``The Virginian,'' ``Bonanza,'' ``The Quest'' and
``Tucker's Witch.''
   ``A series is so grueling,'' he said, ``especially an hour show.
A half-hour show's much better. We rehearse one day and then shoot
it one-camera with no laugh track. It's not an audience show,
because when you do that you need two laughs a page. With that kind
of structure you can't deal with the emotions or any depth of
character.
   ``We let the humor come out of the situations, rather than do a
set-up, then a joke, then another set-up.''
   Matheson has also begun producing movies. He recently went to
Australia to check out movie locations for ``Blind Fury,'' an
action-adventure that he will produce but not appear in. It's based
on a series of films from Japan called ``Zatoichi'' _ ``the blind
one.''
   ``As an actor you get a creative catharsis,'' Matheson said.
``You prepare, then you do it and leave it behind. As a producer
you must have some creative satisfaction.
   ``You're juggling balls. It's problem-solving and
people-matching. It's getting to the point where I now trust my
first instinct. I've found from experience if I don't like somebody
going in, it's going to be a problem.''
   Matheson and his wife, former ballerina Megan Murphy, recently
became parents for the second time. Their new daughter is Emma. The
have another daughter, Mollie.

<HEAD>Is a Recession Inevitable?</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Also on financial wires.</NOTE>

   As the economic expansion grows in years,
exceeding almost any other ``peacetime'' expansion in U.S. history,
it is producing an odd by-product, a sense of foreboding about the
next recession.
   Will there be a recession? It's a sure thing; bet all your money
on it.
   If anything is certain in economics it is that expansion and
contraction follow and precede each other, each a parent and child
of the other, each a cause and effect at one and the same time.
   But will there be a recession within the year? The answer is
that nobody knows, no matter how much they talk about the the
growing age of the expansion and insist that it must soon shrivel
and totter from old age.
   The message is an important one: While traditional economics is
wedded to the notion that long expansions are doomed to fade
because of their age, there is growing evidence that this is not
necessarily the case.
   The message is contained in a study of recessions by Byron
Higgins, vice president and economist of the Federal Reserve Bank
of Kansas City, and published in the bank's ``Economic Review.''
   Higgins notes that business cycles, or expansions and
contractions, were fairly predictable before World War II, but have
been less predictable since then.
   To wit: The 20 U.S. economic expansions from 1854 to 1933 lasted
an average of 25 months, and the corresponding recessions lasted an
average of 22 months.
   This experience gave rise to the belief that an internal dynamic
dictated the business cycle. There was, it was felt, a regular _
even periodic _ cycle: A recession of a bit less than two years,
followed by a two-year expansion.
   The most popular explanation was that as expansions lengthened
they bred excesses and imbalances, such as falling productivity and
rising wages and prices, that led to a downfall. In turn, the
recession corrected things.
   But, says Higgins, postwar evidence is not consistent with the
traditional business cycle theory. Recessions have averaged just
one year, half as long, and expansions have averaged almost four
years, about twice as long as before.
   It leads him to conclude that an economic expansion lasting more
than five years ``is no longer so unusual that a recession should
be considered imminent merely because the expansion has continued
for a long time.''
   But nobody needs to be told that traditions die hard. With each
passing month the talk about recession has grown more insistent.
And the stock market crash of last October puncutated those fears
with an exclamation point.
   In November, Blue Chip Economic Forecasts, published by
economist Robert Eggert, found 35 percent of the forecasters it
surveyed felt a recession was under way or would begin in 1988, a
jump from 8 percent in September.
   But is the stock market a good forecaster of recessions? Higgins
found that since 1900 the market successfully predicted recessions
only 41 percent of the time.
   But, many will be inclined to wonder _ as did Higgins _ if an
especially sharp decline in the market is a more accurate
forecaster. He checked. No, he found, the market's predictive power
actually deteriorates instead.
   Nevertheless, he regards the Oct. 19 crash as unique, explaining
that it was ``so distinctive that it is outside the bounds of
historical experience.''
   But the evidence he amasses does carry two reassuring messages:
   1. Just because an expansion is statistically old doesn't mean
it is doomed because of its own internal dynamics.
   2. The stock market's record as a forecaster is so weak that it
``provides a cautionary note to any confident prediction that the
stock market decline last year makes a recession in 1988
inevitable.''

<HEAD>60th Academy Awards: The Year of the Actress</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BOB THOMAS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>HOLLYWOOD (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The National Academy of Motion Picture Arts &
Sciences' 60th awards might well be termed the Year of the Actress,
so impressive are the candidates for best performance by an actress
in 1987.
   After being overshadowed for a few decades by macho stars, film
actresses are now having powerful roles fashioned for them. This
year's nominees afford proof: Cher, the perplexed widow of
``Moonstruck''; Glenn Close, the vengeful spurned lover in ``Fatal
Attraction''; Holly Hunter, the dynamic news producer of
``Broadcast News''; Sally Kirkland, the faded Czech actress,
``Anna''; and Meryl Streep, the down-and-out ex-singer in
``Ironweed.''
   Adding to their impressive number are performances that many
felt warranted Academy consideration: Lillian Gish and Bette Davis,
``The Whales of August''; Sarah Miles, ``Hope and Glory''; Maggie
Smith, ``The Lonely Passion of Judith Hearn''; Christine Lahti,
``Housekeeping''; Faye Dunaway, ``Barfly''; Barbra Streisand,
``Nuts''; Joanne Woodward, ``The Glass Menagerie.''
   Cher has been drawing the most attention among the nominees,
attracting a media broadside of amazing proportions. The one-time
member of the Sonny and Cher singing team is justifiably proud of
her performance in ``Moonstruck'' and has been willing to talk
about it.
   ```Moonstruck' is the first movie of mine that I ever watched
without wanting to throw up,'' she says. ``I was in love with the
story; it's my best work since `Mask.'
   ``Usually everyone's first choice is Meryl (Streep) and then
so-and-so and then so-and-so. It's something to start being
someone's first choice. ... Jack Nicholson has clout, you know.
Barbra Streisand has clout. Jane Fonda has clout. I think relative
to them, I'm a newcomer. ... I'm not working my way toward power.
I'm working my way toward the best roles I can get.''
   Equally voluble is Sally Kirkland, who won the Golden Globe as
best dramatic actress for ``Anna.'' She has been enjoying her
success after years of trying: ``I have tested for the leading role
in 25 movies, and each time the choice has narrowed to another
actress and myself. Each time the other actress won.''
   The actress campaigned for the role in the low-budget film,
studying the Czech accent and absorbing the atmosphere of the
emigre community in New York. She even added 15 pounds and taped
her face to create wrinkles.
   Does she want the Oscar?
   ``I cannot tell a lie; my fantasy ever since I was 5 years old
has been to hold that (statue) and say, `Thank-you, thank-you,
thank-you.'''
   Holly Hunter, hailed as a bright new star because of ``Broadcast
News,'' has been as silent as Kirkland and Cher have been vocal.
She declined most interviews, arguing that she was too involved
with the Sam Shepard play, ``A Lie of the Mind,'' at Los Angeles'
Mark Taper Theater.
   Director James Brooks predicts the Georgia-born actress ``will
be around for decades.'' Of his script she commented: ``I loved it;
I thought it was remarkably three-dimensional.''
   She also talked about the differences between herself and the
news producer she portrays: ``Holly Hunter is certainly less driven
than Jane Craig. I think that my priorities are quite a bit
different, in that I'm probably pretty obsessed myself, but not to
such a manic degree.''
   After three supporting-actress nominations in six film roles,
Glenn Close broke through in the starring category with ``Fatal
Attraction.'' She terms the demonic Alix the first woman she's
played ``who is out of control, who emotionally runs the gamut _
the first real, full-blooded role I've had.''
   Her comment on the huge reaction to ``Fatal Attraction'': ``The
whole male-female thing in this country is very volatile right now.
I think many women are feeling used by men. They invest a lot in a
relationship, in nurturing a man emotionally and in his career, but
they have their own careers and emotions, and they don't get that
nurturing in return.''
   After playing a number of glamorous roles, two-time Oscar winner
Meryl Streep found her role as the derelict in ``Ironweed'' had its
advantages: ``In this world of purgatory of the soul, there are
very few markers to go by. I liked that about her. I liked not
having to worry about how I looked and being able to strip away,
strip away everying, except what counts.''
   Streep has created a series of indelible performances, including
Oscar winners in ``Kramer vs. Kramer'' and ``Sophie's Choice,'' as
well as ``The Deer Hunter'' and ``Out of Africa.''
   She remains ambitious: ``There's so much I'd like to do. When
the public is used to you in heavy drama, it's hard to make them
take you seriously. But I want to play comedy.
   ``I can't stand it that stage fright inhibits me. At some point
I'm going to face up and do a play. But for now I just go day to
day.''

<HEAD>Supporting Actor Nominees Are Diverse and None Has Won Before</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BOB THOMAS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>

   The race for best supporting actor of 1987
provides Academy voters a choice among a perspiring TV reporter, a
steely Chicago cop, a philandering Brooklyn husband, a wily New
York City pimp and a South African martyr.
   The nominees are a diverse lot, ranging from the first James
Bond to a stand-up comedian. None has ever won an Oscar.
   Sean Connery is generally considered the quintessential 007, a
role that seemed impossible for him to escape. But after 30 years
in films, he has finally been recognized for his performance as
another enforcer, the Irish beat cop Jimmy Malone in ``The
Untouchables.''
   ``I thought it was a very clever concept to take the old cop and
use him as a kind of old dog who teaches a new dog tricks,'' says
Connery of his role as mentor to the young federal agent, Kevin
Costner.
   Yet Connery is maintaining a classic Bond cool over the
possibility of winning his first Oscar. ``To be honest, I've never
really spent much time thinking about it before,'' he said in a
recent interview. ``I just go on with my work.''
   Neither is he bitter that it has taken the Academy some 40 films
to even nominate him. ``It's all a matter of timing and how your
films and image are presented,'' Connery told the Hollywood
Reporter. ``There are a lot of my films which I'm very proud of,
which I think were artistic successes, but weren't huge box office
successes like the Bond pictures.''
   There's no chance, though, that Connery will snub the Academy if
he wins. ``It'd be important to me, and I'd definitely turn up to
collect it. I'm not one of those actors who'd send along the
cleaning lady instead.''
   Morgan Freeman accomplished the near-impossible: winning a
nomination in a film released early in the year to scant notice.
His role as vicious ``Fast Black'' in ``Street Smart'' was dynamic
enough to remain in Academy voters' minds.
   Born in Memphis and raised in Greenwood, Miss., before moving to
Chicago, Freeman built up an impressive number of stage credits
before appearing in such films as ``Brubaker,'' ``Teachers'' and
``Marie.'' His performance in ``Street Smart'' prompted this
outburst from the New Yorker's Pauline Kael: ``Is Morgan Freeman
the greatest actor in America today?''
   Freeman admits to a rough life while growing up in Chicago's
South Side: ``I stole, I conned, I passed the tests. But I was
scared. I'm not the violent type.'' This contrasts the brutal role
he plays in ``Street Smart.''
   Instead of sliding into delinquency, the young Freeman found
himself attracted to acting, and sold bottles so he would have
money to go to the movies.
   Vincent Gardenia, Cher's excitable father in ``Moonstruck,'' has
been in the New York theater since 1954 and films since 1958. He
also was a member of the ``All in the Family'' cast on television.
   Gardenia was ideal casting as the Italian plumber; his family
emigrated from Naples, and he began acting in New York's Italian
theater. He was delighted with the ``Moonstruck'' script: ``It was
the first about an Italian family in a long time that you don't see
shooting, killings, bombings. It's about love, about family.''
   Denzel Washington was cast in ``Cry Freedom'' after a worldwide
search for an actor to play the vital role of Steven Biko, the
black leader who was beaten to death by South African police while
in their custody.
   Washington admits that his nomination was ``both a letdown and a
great honor.'' The letdown came because Universal Pictures had been
promoting him for best actor, and he had been nominated for a
Golden Globe in that category. He adds that his reaction wasn't the
result of an actor's ego.
   ``It has more to do with my own feelings about Steven Biko,'' he
says. ``I would like to see him in (a starring) light, and I think
most people do. He was not a supporting player.''
   Washington faced an imposing challenge: portraying a
much-admired, even revered figure while making him a believable
human being.
   ``I don't know how to play a saint,'' he says. ``I couldn't get
any advice from anyone on how to play a saint. So that was no
problem.'' Under Richard Attenborough's direction, he created a
portrait of the martyr that was both human and convincing.
   Washington said the effect of ``Cry Freedom'' on the apartheid
issue will be on a personal level.
   ``Most of the comments I've gotten from people were that they
didn't know what goes on in South Africa,'' he said. ``That's where
it will have its most important effect. I don't think it's going to
make a change in the government's attitude or the attitude of the
black people there. It's just a movie, commenting on something from
the outside.''
   Albert Brooks, the astute reporter and failed anchorman of
``Broadcast News,'' is noted for directing himself in films: ``Real
Life,'' ``Modern Romance,'' ``Lost in America.''
   Brooks, a stand-up comedian before making films, says that the
role of Aaron Altman was different from his own life: ``I don't
work in the news business. I don't have a 9 to 5 or even a 9 to 9
job. I don't wear suits. I don't have friends. ... Over a period of
four months I hung out with a dozen reporters. I think what happens
is you sort of compile little things from everybody.''

   A flop London play that became a surprise New York
hit is having its second shot at local success as a result of its
long off-Broadway run.
   ``Whatever happens to it now, it's a much better piece,''
playwright Simon Gray said of his play ``The Common Pursuit,''
which opens a commercial London engagement April 7 at the Phoenix
Theater.
   The play, which looks at the lapsed ideals of six graduates of
Cambridge University over a 15-year-period, bowed to mixed reviews
and disappointing houses four years ago at West London's
not-for-profit Lyric, Hammersmith Theater.
   Hopes of transferring that production to the West End, London's
Broadway, were never realized. It took the play's subsequent
success off-Broadway, where it began an acclaimed 10-month run at
the Promenade Theater in October 1986, to secure its present West
End engagement.
   Co-producer John McQuiggan said the play has been transformed
from its original London run. ``I don't think anyone wants to dwell
on 1984,'' he said. ``My feeling is this is a brand-new
production.''
   McQuiggan produced the play on his own in New York and is
co-producing it in London with Howard Panter's Independent
Theatrical Productions.
   Capitalized at $295,000, roughly the same as its off-Broadway
cost, the play will break even in the West End at 40 percent
capacity, McQuiggan said, meaning it could recoup its investment
after five weeks if business is good. In New York, it broke even at
52 percent of capacity and recouped after 13 weeks, he said.
   Playwright Harold Pinter directed the initial London production,
which local critics found too narrowly focused a look at the
well-educated elite of Britain's publishing and academic
communities.
   New York critics, however, responded warmly to the literacy of
the play and its rueful, compelling plot. In addition, Gray said
they didn't bother to speculate on the real-life prototypes for his
on-stage characters.
   ``People realized there wasn't anything to know except what was
on the stage,'' Gray, a Cambridge graduate, said of the New York
audience. ``It's part of the general imbecility of theater critics
in England that they thought the real-life parallels were worth
discussing.''
   Gray said three separate American productions of the play _ in
Los Angeles, New Haven, Conn., and New York _ enabled him to do the
necessary rewrites.
   ``I had always felt dissatisfied with the text,'' said the
playwright. ``Now, it's the same skeleton but with, I hope, more
flesh.''
   Gray's previous New York and London hits include ``Butley,''
``Otherwise Engaged'' and ``Quartermaine's Terms.''
   The West End production uses the same revolving oak set by David
Jenkins that won acclaim off-Broadway. But its cast is younger than
in previous productions and heavily weighted with such British
comics as Rik Mayall, Stephen Fry and John Sessions.
   ``I'm now absolutely certain that the cast has to be young,''
said Gray, whose play requires the actors to age from their early
20s to mid-30s.
   But he said the present line-up did not represent a bid for
increased commercialism.
   ``The comics aren't doing stand-up routines; they are acting,''
he said. ``The audience comes to see people who've made them laugh
on TV, and they stay to grasp the whole experience.''
   Gray's previous experiences with this play have already produced
two memoirs: ``An Unnatural Pursuit, and Other Pieces'' and ``How's
That for Telling Them, Fat Lady?,'' which is to be published in
Britain next month.
   Has Gray now closed the book on his play at last?
   ``Oh God, yes,'' he said. ``I think I've done all I can humanly
do to make the play work, and if it doesn't, it doesn't.''

<HEAD>U.S. Experts Say Rising Narcotics Production is Scourge of World</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A deluge of illegal narcotics has
cascaded across the world in the late 1980s in a scourge that
threatens to sap the energy and resources of nations, corrupt their
officials and disrupt national policies, U.S. experts say.
   They estimate that this year producers mainly in Latin America
and Asia will grow 213,700 metric tons _ 471.1 million pounds _ of
illicit opium, coca (the source of cocaine), marijuana and hashish.
And with increased production, street prices of processed narcotics
are coming down in many areas, resulting in a sharp rise in
addiction in poor countries.
   While the United States remains the No. 1 gross consumer of
illicit drugs, the poorer nations are finding themselves afflicted
with even higher addiction rates. The trend is forcing Asian and
Latin American countries to divert scarce resources from
development to the fight against drug use and addiction.
   The U.S. experts, who were in Malaysia for a recent world
narcotics conference, also said that criminal drug syndicates
appear to be prospering as never before, using their staggering
profits to buy off law enforcers, to arm their followers and in
some cases to influence national policies.
   New trafficking connections resemble a map of global airline
routes.
   ``There is now a realization almost everywhere that the drug
problem, no matter how it manifests itself in individual countries,
is an international problem,'' said U.S. State Department
consultant Manuel Gallardo. ``It's the litany, the gospel.''
   Senior officials of the White House, U.S. Drug Enforcement
Administration (DEA) and State Department, interviewed in Kuala
Lumpur by The Associated Press, gave this picture of the magnitude
and global reach of narcotics:
   _Worldwide illicit production in 1988 of opium, from which
heroin is derived, may be as high as 3,000 metric tons and will
originate mainly in Asia's Golden Triangle, where the borders of
Thailand, Burma and Laos converge, and in the so-called Golden
Crescent _ Pakistan, Afghanistan and Iran. About 200,000 tons of
coca will probably be produced, almost all of it in Latin America,
along with 9,500 tons of marijuana and 1,200 tons of hashish in
various parts of the world.
   While these figures are roughly comparable to production in
1987, they represent substantial increases over the mid-1980s.
Meanwhile, drug prices are reported at low levels in many markets.
   _New trafficking routes are sprouting as authorities make
headway in blocking old ones.
   Recently uncovered connections include the passage of cocaine
through Brazil across the Atlantic Ocean to Senegal and the Ivory
Coast in Africa, then on to Western Europe. Heroin from Pakistan
and India is secreted through Kenya, Ethiopia, Nigeria and Senegal,
also in Africa, from where it is variously moved to the United
States, Europe and the Persian Gulf states. War-torn Lebanon,
thousands of miles from the coca fields of South America, has
become a major refining and transshipment center.
   ``What is becoming more evident is the flexibility of
trafficking organizations,'' said DEA chief John C. Lawn.
   _Pakistan, which was virtually drug-free in 1980, now has
600,000 or more heroin addicts, a far higher percentage of the
population than in the United States. Countries in Latin America,
which once shrugged off cocaine as an exclusively ``Yankee vice,''
are finding more of the drug is diverted for domestic abuse.
   Cocaine is also spreading to Western Europe, and some say it is
only a matter of time before it penetrates Asia where heroin is
still the dominant hard drug.
   ``A number of countries have moved from zero to large addict
populations within a few years,'' said U.S. Deputy Assistant
Secretary of State Mark Dion. ``It's a heavy anchor around the
necks of governments trying to bring development. The costs are
tremendous.''
   _The United States is the globe's top drug market, with 38
million Americans having consumed illicit drugs last year,
according to White House estimates. These included 12 million
cocaine users and 18 million who regularly used marijuana. An
estimated half million are heroin addicts.
   About $54 billion, three times the gross national product of
impoverished Bangladesh, was spent in the United States last year
on health care, job absenteeism and other consequences of drug
abuse.

   While not drawing any direct, apocalyptic parallels between the
drug situation today and that of the Manchu Dynasty in China at the
turn of the century, the experts noted that opium addiction there
affected foreign policy and led to the collapse of the Manchu
imperial rule. Some 15 million Chinese, from coolies to mandarins,
may have been addicted to opium at the time, they said.
   Despite the grim statistics, a few hopeful signs are appearing.
   With some exceptions, international cooperation is growing in
fighting traffickers, funding projects and exchanging views on
addiction, rehabilitation and anti-drug education.
   ``We're talking the same language,'' said White House official
Donald Ian Macdonald of increasing U.S.-Soviet cooperation on
drugs. China is also becoming more active, while regional
organizations in several parts of the world have been formed to
tackle the problem.
   The United States, widely viewed as both the key anti-drug
fighter and a major source of the problem, has taken a tougher drug
stance abroad and may follow suit domestically.
   ``What came through in the case of Panama is that the United
States will not do business with a drug country,'' said the State
Department's Dion, referring to pressure Washington put on Gen.
Manuel Antonio Noriega, the Panamanian strongman under indictment
in the United States on narcotics trafficking charges.
   Macdonald, who is the White House special assistant for drug
abuse policy, predicted a U.S. hardline on narcotics might include
greater focus on and tougher action against American drug users, a
move many nations would probably welcome.
   ``For a lot of politicians it's easier to talk about nasty
foreigners than their own constituents,'' Macdonald said. ``I don't
deny most drugs come from abroad, but we have to look at our own
demand and consumption.''
   Seen as a ``drug market leader,'' the United States also has
become the proliferator of new drugs _ including synthetic
``designer'' varieties _ and the social problems they spawn will
almost certainly spread to other parts of the world, the officials
say.
   ``One reason we're in a sort of panic is that we're not sure
what's going on with the new stuff,'' Macdonald said.
   Lawn, whose agency's current $525 million budget has jumped 140
percent since 1981, said each new drug that surfaces requires a
fresh set of strategies and more commitment of resources.
   U.S. drug syndicates have been hit by an apparently effective
legal blitz in the United States, but their drug-running activities
are being taken over by Asian groups.
   Arrests of drug criminals worldwide have probably never been
greater, but denser transport links and more movement of people
globally present traffickers with what the U.S. Customs Department
calls new ``windows of opportunity.''
   Governments in some Asian countries are making sizable efforts
to fight traffickers and take casualties while trying to eradicate
illict crops. But syndicates have penetrated to the core of
political power in nations like Colombia in South America.
   ``It's going to take a long effort,'' Lawn said. ``This is not a
battle for the faint of heart or the short-distance runner. It's a
marathon.''

   John Moores has amassed a fortune from other
people's pennies.
   The bricklayer's son who started out at 14 as a Post Office
messenger is reckoned by some to be the richest person in Britain
after Queen Elizabeth II, who knighted him in 1980.
   He did it by offering the soccer pools _ football pools, they're
called here _ to a public dreaming of escape from the 1930s
depression. Today, having expanded into mail-order shopping and
chain stores, he is personally worth about $3 billion, according to
the British journal, Money Magazine, and the Guinness Book of
Records.
   Now 92 years old, he lives quietly in Formby outside Liverpool,
not far from his birthplace, and has not spoken to reporters for
two years. The last time Moores was heard from, in an interview
with The Guardian newspaper, he said: ``I don't pretend to be very
clever. I don't seem to have any outstanding quality. I count
myself enormously lucky.''
   At 82, he told the British Broadcasting Corp. he didn't know how
much money he had, never carried any and often went weeks without
buying anything.
   ``A rich man doesn't sit on bags of gold,'' he said. ``I'm often
overdrawn at the bank because I don't leave my money there. I can
earn much more than the 8 or 9 percent the bank pays by investing
elsewhere.''
   His success story began in 1924 at his kitchen table, where he
devised a lottery based on the results of soccer games. His family
and two of his workmates at the Commercial Cable Co. invested a
total of 150 pounds, then worth $720.
   They called their business Littlewoods, after an aunt of that
name, to avoid being fired from their jobs for moonlighting.
   Littlewoods Pools earned just 8 pounds ($38.40) its first year,
and the partners opted out. So Moores roped in relatives to help
check coupons on Sunday mornings.
   Bettors had to guess at a penny a try which eight games would
result in ties in national league soccer matches. Moores didn't
invent soccer pools, but he elaborated them and offered the biggest
prizes. By 1932, when one-seventh of the British work force was
jobless, he was a millionaire.
   The chances of winning even a small prize are 80-1, but some 8
million people today fill in a weekly coupon, and hundreds win
something.
   Littlewoods cagily says the odds against winning a big prize
cannot be calculated because there are too many imponderables. But
the Guinness Book of Records says the odds for selecting eight ties
from 55 games in one line are 1,217,566,350 to 1.
   In 1950, Moores set a prize limit of 75,000 pounds (then
$210,000), saying that was ``ample money to fulfill all the dreams
and ambitions of ordinary people.''
   But rivals and inflation later forced him to scrap the limit,
and this past July truck driver Jimmy Anderson collected the
British record pools win of 1,339,358 pounds (then $2.14 million)
for a stake of 40 pence (64 cents).
   He picked the 8 scoreless games from a list of 58.
   ``I didn't know what to do with it,'' Anderson said three months
later. ``All I bought in the first two weeks was a box of frozen
prawns.'' He got bored not having to get out of bed for work at 3
a.m., and bought a delivery truck to go into business for himself.
   The three big pools companies, Littlewoods, Vernons and Zetters,
pulled in the equivalent of $956 million last year, Littlewoods
taking 75 percent. The companies paid out $262 million to winners
and $406 million in taxes. Expenses totaled $286 million.
   Winners are not required to pay taxes on the sum they receive,
but they must pay them on such things as interest on bank accounts
or dividends earned from stocks purchased with the prize money.
   After making his first million, Moores expanded into mail-order
shopping in 1932 and launched his Littlewoods Stores chain in 1936.
He now employs 41,000 people and owns 108 stores.
   Moores recalled to The Guardian that he started his mail order
business with ``no buyers, no catalogue, no anything.'' He cut
illustrations out of magazines, assembled a menswear range and
again called on his family for help. Then he went to see Montgomery
Ward and Sears Roebuck in the United States.
   ``I found that if I said thank you and praised them, they would
give me almost anything,'' he said. ``I got a lot of new ideas from
them. I learned a lot from America and I admire the Americans.''
   His mother, he said, taught him the value of money by adding a
halfpenny (2 cents) for every 3 pennies (12 cents) he saved in
pocket money.
   Short and white-haired, he lives in the seclusion of an
Italianate villa and drives a Rolls-Royce. He and brother Cecil,
82, who runs the pools, are known in Liverpool as ``the uncles.''
   He married Ruby Knowles, a cafe waitress, in 1923, and their
four children have followed him into the business. His wife died in
1965.
   He is president for life of Littlewoods Organization PLC, and
lists sports and travel among his pastimes. He loves to paint, and
in 1957 he founded the John Moores Liverpool Exhibition, a biennial
contest to promote young painters. His knighthood was for services
to art, not business.
   Moores gives about a half million pounds (nearly $1 million) a
year to charity.
   ``It's for me to help the weak and poor,'' he said in his BBC
interview.
   ``A man in a swamp can only be helped by a man with his feet on
dry ground. I'm strong enough to pull him out.''

<HEAD>Consumed for 1,000 Years, Whale Meat Now Rare and Costly in Japan</HEAD>

   At Kujira-ya, one of Tokyo's few remaining whale
meat restaurants, about 350 customers a day fill its two floors,
ordering raw whale at $24 a serving or deep-fried at $8.40 a plate.
   Eaten by Japanese for 1,000 years and once one of the country's
cheapest meats, dark red, chewy whale has become increasingly
costly and rare.
   That's because of a worldwide commercial whaling ban, imposed at
the behest of the United States and other countries on grounds that
the mammal of the seas has become an endangered species.
   Japanese lovers of whale meat and whaling industry officials
don't agree.
   ``Americans hunted whales for their oil, so it's probably hard
for them to imagine whales as a source of food,'' said Makiko Takai
over a plate of grilled whale at Kujira-ya (Whale Shop). ``I'd stop
eating whale if all types were endangered, but I've heard some are
still plentiful.''
   Although whale has been consumed for a millenium and 16th
century documents show Japan's samurai society being served whale
on formal occasions, the Japanese didn't regularly eat whale until
the lean years after World War II. It then became frequent fare at
school and company cafeterias and steak on the table at home often
meant whale steak.
   When Japanese whaling was at its peak in the early 1960s, whales
provided 23 percent of all meat consumed in the country. In 1962
Japanese ate a record 226,000 tons, but last year only 25,000 tons
were consumed, including imports from Iceland, according to the
Japan Whaling Association.
   ``At this rate, we'll probably only be able to stay in business
for two or three more years,'' said an employee at Kujira-ya. ``But
so far, whale meat is still obtainable.''
   That continuing availability of whale meat in Japan, the world's
biggest whale consumer, has rankled overseas environmentalists, who
charge it is using a loophole in the charter of the International
Whaling Commission (IWC) to continue whale hunts, despite the
commission's ban on commercial whaling.
   The ban, overwhelmingly passed by the 42-member commission in
1982 to allow scientists to study whale populations, went into
effect in 1986 and is to be re-evaluated in 1990 on the basis of
research results.
   Japan officially ended its commercial whaling in the Antarctic
at the end of the 1986-87 season, when it caught 1,941 whales, and
is to end whaling along its own coasts soon.
   But this season, three Japanese ships are back in the Antarctic,
catching minke whales under a clause in the international
convention that allows nations to kill a limited number of whales
for scientific research.
   Nevertheless, the moratorium has dealt Japan's whaling industry
a devastating blow. This season, only 400 to 500 Japanese are
directly employed in whaling, down from about 900 last year, and
the number is likely to decrease by 200 more when Japan halts its
coastal whaling. Last season's catch was valued at less than $100
million, small by Japanese fishery standards, officials say.
   Unlike the past, when almost all parts of whales were used _ for
food, fertilizer, cosmetics, shoe horns, tennis racket string,
fishing rods, crafts or medicines _ the limited supply now makes
most non-food uses economically impractical, Kunio Arai, chief of
the whaling association, said in an interview.
   But as the economic importance of whaling in Japan has declined,
the country's resistance to anti-whaling pressure has grown and
toughened.
   ``It's not a question of the size of the economic impact, but
rather a matter of national pride,'' said Junichiro Okamoto,
assistant director of the Fishery Agency's Deep Sea Fishery
Division. ``Why must Japanese listen to Americans saying that we
must stop eating whales just because they want us to? That's like
telling us to stop eating rice.''
   If Japan doesn't stick to its principles, he added, ``the United
States will have the misunderstanding that Japan always succumbs to
U.S. pressure. That won't lead to mature mutual relations.''
   Deepening the gulf between Japan and anti-whaling groups is a
profound difference in their perceptions of the whale, the world's
largest animal. While environmental groups stress the uniqueness of
whales, including their large, highly developed brains and
communication ability, many Japanese see their meat as a normal
source of protein.
   At one time, Japanese Buddhism forbade the eating of animal
meat, but made an exception for whales, which were officially
categorized then as fish.
   ``When meat dishes were first widely introduced to Japan from
the West in the 19th century, many Japanese probably felt the same
way toward beef as Westerners now feel toward the eating of
whales,'' said Junko Miyamoto, a school secretary.
   ``How can someone judge that it's okay to eat cows and pigs but
not whales?'' she asked, referring to current U.S. pressure on
Japan to increase its imports of foreign beef. ``The United States
is trying to impose its own values on others.''
   It was partly the U.S. whaling industry's pursuit of new whaling
grounds after the depletion of the northern Atlantic that brought
Commodore Matthew Perry's ``black ships'' to Japan in 1853,
demanding access to Japanese ports for provisions and care for
shipwrecked sailors.
   ``The United States killed whales because of economic demand,''
said the Japan Whaling Association's Arai. ``At that time nobody
said anything about whales being cute and intelligent. But now,
after Americans have ended whaling, they're using those reasons to
tell us to stop.''
   In February, the U.S. government declared that Japan's continued
whaling was harming international whaling agreements. Under two
U.S. anti-whaling laws, it imposed a symbolic cut of 50 percent in
Japan's fishing quota in U.S. waters _ already set at zero for this
year _ and now must decide whether to ban the import of Japanese
seafood.
   Meanwhile, the Japanese whalers in the Antarctic are hoping to
prove that sufficient stocks exist to allow the resumption of
limited whaling in 1990. The vessels are supposed to sail along
fixed routes and kill only one minke whale in each group sighted,
up to a total of 300, to study their health, age and diet.
   ``Conservation groups project a single image of whales, even
though there are many kinds, some of which are endangered and
others of which are not,'' Arai said. ``The IWC estimates there are
about 430,000 minke whales in the Antarctic, and the number is
growing.''
   Japanese whaling officials contend that the commission, now
dominated by non-whaling countries, hasn't shown it is serious
about carrying out a thorough research program.
   ``If by 1990 there's no sign of a comprehensive survey, then
there's little reason for Japan to stay in the IWC,'' Okamoto said.

   Robeson County, a house divided against
itself, shudders and heaves with the tremors of a power struggle
150 years in the making.
   The week-old murder of Julian Pierce, lawyer, judicial candidate
and Indian activist, has shaken this troubled tri-racial county,
where minorities are in the majority but whites are in control.
   Amid anger and grief, amid rumors of official corruption and
public paranoia, amid the blooming forsythia and the early spring
heat, residents of Robeson County _ black, white and Indian _ bury
the dead and wonder when there will be peace for the living.
   ``We're either going to pull ourselves apart, or we're going to
pull ourselves together,'' said Eric Prevatte, a local businessman,
his eyes red-rimmed after delivering a eulogy for Pierce. ``And we
all have a common interest in pulling ourselves together. The
alternative is just unthinkable.''
   The unthinkable has become almost inevitable in Robeson, 944
square miles of tall trees, hot summers and a history of
unhappiness.
   It is one of the state's largest counties, and one of its
poorest. On a spring day, Lumberton, the county seat, is deceptive;
beneath the serene facade of stately brick homes and wide verandas,
the quiet streets named for the trees that shade them, a stew of
racial suspicion and fear simmers and sometimes bubbles to the
surface.
   On Feb. 1, Eddie Hatcher, 30, and Timothy Jacobs, 19, two
Tuscarora Indians, charged into The Robesonian newspaper office
with shotguns and took at least 17 people hostage. No one was hurt.
The pair apologized to their captives, many of whom sympathized
with their grievances.
   ``It wasn't right,'' said Tanya Dial, a Lumbee Indian and one of
the hostages. ``But it was something they had to do.''
   They surrendered 10 hours later after Gov. Jim Martin agreed to
send a task force to investigate allegations of corruption in local
law enforcement.
   Sheriff Hubert Stone has said he is resented for his zealous
pursuit of criminals. But local leaders say Robeson has a huge drug
problem, with cocaine flowing in from the coast and up Interstate
95, a critical artery in the nation's drug network. The air is
thick with rumors of official complicity, but there is no proof,
and plenty of denial.
   ``It's a county that has allegations going on, mainly just wild
allegations,'' said Bob Horne, editor of The Robesonian.
   ``People don't trust the sheriff's department,'' said Jo Ann
Tyner, a legal secretary and life-long county resident. ``I think
people have the evidence _ they're just scared. They want their
families protected before they'll come forward.''
   Hatcher and Jacobs also demanded an investigation into the Jan.
13 death of Billy McKellar, 27, a black inmate in the county jail,
whom authorities said died of an ``asthmatic cardiac arrest.'' Some
people do not believe the whole truth has surfaced in that death,
or in Julian Pierce's murder, or in up to 17 other mysterious or
unsolved deaths in the county in the last five years.
   On a moonless, drizzly night in November 1986, Deputy Kevin
Stone, the sheriff's son, stopped a 1980 Pinto driven by Jimmy Earl
Cummings, a Lumbee Indian known to police as a drug dealer. Within
minutes, the unarmed Cummings was lying at the bottom of a ditch
along the road, a bullet from Stone's gun in his face.
   The deputy said the gun discharged accidentally. At the
coroner's inquest, a six-member jury agreed.
   Cummings' family, given less than two hours' notice of the
hearing, were denied time to find an attorney. Reporters were never
notified. At the time of the inquest, the autopsy results were not
available.
   Not long before Cummings' death, drugs were stolen from the
sheriff's evidence room. A former deputy was tried and acquitted in
connection with the theft.
   ``There are people who say that Jimmy Earl Cummings had told
people before then that he feared for his life, that he was selling
drugs that had disappeared out of the courthouse,'' Horne said.
``Nobody really knows what happened that night, except Kevin
Stone.''
   Outraged members of the Concerned Citizens for Better
Government, a group founded by Indian activist John Godwin after
Cummings' death, bought four pages in The Robesonian and printed
the transcript of the two-hour hearing.
   Four months later, Godwin, 72, was dead of injuries sustained in
a head-on car collision.
   Julian Pierce, 42, an attorney revered in the Lumbee community
and widely respected outside it, had gone to a wake for Godwin the
night of March 25, and later registered voters at a club in
Lumberton.
   Pierce was the favored candidate for a newly created Superior
Court judgeship designed by the Legislature to give minorities
better representation. Even though the county's Indians and blacks
count 8,000 more registered voters than do the whites, he went out
to register 20 more. Every vote counted in this election, something
he had worked nine years to achieve.

   Sometime after midnight, Pierce heard a noise at his back door.
When he investigated, he was shot three times with a 12-gauge
shotgun by John Anderson Goins, 24, of Pembroke, according to
Sheriff Stone.
   Three days later, Goins was found dead in a closet at home,
killed by a blast from a different shotgun than that which killed
Pierce. Stone said it was a suicide.
   An alleged accomplice, Sandy Chavis, 24, was charged with
first-degree murder. Investigators speculated that Goins held
Pierce responsible for disrupting his relationship with Shannon
Bullard, 16, the daughter of Pierce's girlfriend, Ruth Locklear.
   At first some people, including Sheriff Stone, seemed to assume
that Pierce's death was politically motivated. State law says that
if a candidate dies more than 30 days after a primary filing date,
his opponent wins the nomination.
   In this case, because no Republicans were running, winning the
nomination means winning the race, and the winner would be a white
man, Joe Freeman Britt, the county's district attorney, listed in
the 1985 Guinness Book of World Records as the ``deadliest
prosecutor'' for sending 23 convicts to Death Row in 28 months.
   While many people accept the official explanation of Pierce's
death, others remain unconvinced.
   ``The perception is that, yes, it might have been a domestic
affair, but was it that alone?'' said the Rev. Joy Johnson of
Concerned Citizens for Better Government. ``Could it not have been
influenced by some other influence that caused it to trigger off?
As long as that perception is out there, there is unrest.''
   Leaders asked the governor to call a special legislative session
to change the law so they could field another candidate. Martin has
yet to make a decision.
   The election of an Indian judge would be another sign that what
not so long ago was unthinkable has become inevitable.
   The Lumbees, who believe they are descended from Sir Walter
Raleigh's ``lost colony,'' have been fighting for 100 years to gain
federal recognition as a tribe. They often are so fair-skinned that
outsiders would never guess their ancestry; in Robeson County,
people know who the Lumbees are by family names, like Lowry, Godwin
and Locklear.
   They were free people until 1835, when the state Constitution
denied them the right to vote, to carry weapons or to attend any
but black schools.
   Until 40 years ago, the mayor and commissioners of the mostly
Indian town of Pembroke, west of Lumberton, were always white; they
were appointed by the governor. As recently as 25 years ago, there
were separate public restrooms and drinking fountains for whites,
for blacks and for Indians. Whites sat downstairs at the two movie
theaters, the Carolina and the Riverside. Blacks and Indians sat
upstairs.
   Horace Locklear, a Lumbee Indian and attorney, vividly remembers
the day more than 30 years ago when he and a friend dared to sit
downstairs for an entire Whip Wilson western.
   ``That was one of the most frightening times of my life,'' said
Locklear, who is no stranger to fear. That's why he's beefed up
security at his home, and why he's taken to toting a .38-caliber
police special in a leather holster.
   ``For the first time, the people in power here have realized
that they're losing the power,'' said Locklear, who might run in
Pierce's place. ``Now, for the first time, we've got 37 percent
Indian and 37 percent white. We're equal. And our numbers are going
up, while theirs are going down.
   ``They'll go to any lengths, and I'm convinced of it, to keep us
from getting the elected positions we're entitled to.''
   But the change will come; there have been signs that people are
coming together. Black, white and Indian have formed a Committee of
100 to plan strategies to attract industry, and last month, voters
approved a plan to unify the county's five school districts.
   The emotional referendum passed by less than 400 votes out of
more than 22,000 and is still being fought by a group called Save
Our Schools, which wants a recount. But proponents believe the
merger will prevail, and that the county is headed for calmer,
happier days.
   ``If there was ever a time we needed togetherness and healing in
this county, it's now,'' Prevatte said. ``Sometimes, it's just like
getting caught in a thunderstorm: You have to let it rain on you,
and keep on going.''

   The producer of the 60th annual
Academy Awards show hopes big box office translates into better
Nielsen ratings for the show, which has lost viewers in recent
years.
   Last year's show, produced by Samuel Goldwyn Jr. and directed by
Marty Passetta, stemmed Oscar's long-term Nielsen ratings
hemorrhaging, albeit by a fraction of a rating point.
   The 1987 show earned a 27.5 rating, just above the 1986 rating
of 27.3, the worst in the history of the Academy Awards show and
the bottom of a slide that began early in the decade. The A.C.
Nielson Co. rating is a percentage of total U.S. homes with
televisions.
   Goldwyn, who is producing Monday's awards show as well, is
banking on the box-office popularity of this year's nominees.
   Goldwyn says he studied more than 20 years of televised Academy
Awards shows, and ``the thing I noticed is that when the movies are
popular, the show does well.''
   The Academy's nominees in recent years have performed in
critically acclaimed but not widely seen movies, such as four of
the 1986 best-picture nominees, ``Hannah and Her Sisters,'' ``The
Mission,'' ``A Room With A View'' and ``Children of a Lesser God.''
The big winner was ``Platoon.''
   This year, covering films from 1987, the nominees come from
movies that got wide attention and sold millions of tickets:
``Fatal Attraction,'' with more than $100 million in ticket sales,
has six nominations; ``Moonstruck'' also has six nominations, and
``Broadcast News'' has seven.
   Nominees for acting awards this year include Robin Williams for
best actor in ``Good Morning, Vietnam,'' Cher for best actress in
``Moonstruck,'' Sean Connery for best supporting actor in ``The
Untouchables,'' and Anne Archer as best supporting actress for
``Fatal Attraction.''
   And the Academy has something to celebrate this year _ itself.
   Douglass M. Stewart Jr. is editing film sequences to review 60
years of Oscar presentations.
   ``The `Oscar Memories' film, with Richard Dreyfuss narrating,
has a lot of pieces of film many haven't seen for many years,''
Goldwyn said. ``It shows the evolution from a small dinner party to
an event watched by a billion people.''
   There will also be a parade of performers from each of the 59
previous best-picture films, from Buddy Rogers of ``Wings,'' the
1927-28 winner, to Charlie Sheen for ``Platoon.''
   A review of the career of writer-director Billy Wilder also is
scheduled, with clips from his films including ``Sunset
Boulevard,'' ``Some Like It Hot'' and ``The Apartment.'' The
six-time Oscar winner will receive the Academy's Irving Thalberg
Award for lifetime achievement.
   There is the usual impressive list of stellar presenters,
including Connery making his first appearance at the ceremony, as
well as two-time Oscar winner Olivia de Havilland.
   Other presenters will include Cher, Daryl Hannah, Steve Martin,
Chevy Chase, Robin Williams, Glenn Close, Audrey Hepburn, Paul
Newman, Gregory Peck and Michael Douglas.
   Goldwyn said he hopes to improve on his record by keeping the
show focused. Running overtime is a perennial problem for the
broadcast.
   ``The biggest thing was dropping the musical numbers not generic
to film, and the vague tributes,'' he said in an interview. ``If
you keep the show generic to film and what the evening is about ...
the audience will stay with it.''
   Like last year, a blinking red light will warn winners to wind
it up after 45 seconds of acceptance patter.
   Although some Oscar shows haven't looked like it, they do go by
a script. The presenters don't make it up as they go along. But
they may have to this year.
   The Writers Guild of America went on strike March 7 and rejected
an appeal from the Motion Picture of Academy Arts and Sciences to
grant an exemption, so work on the almost completed script stopped.
   However, the Academy wrote to the Guild at the end of March
seeking to negotiate a separate contract that would allow
scriptwriters Mel Shavelson, Jack Rose and Ernest Lehman to finish.

<HEAD>Lynn Moody Developing New Character on `Knots Landing'</HEAD>

   Lynn Moody says the thing that excited her
about joining CBS' ``Knots Landing'' was not the racial
breakthrough but the opportunity to develop a character.
   ``This is the first role I've had that I can develop and work
on,'' she said of her role as Patricia Williams on the hit
prime-time soap opera. She previously has starred in sitcoms and
was in ``Roots'' and its sequel.
   Though they are the only black regular characters on a
prime-time soap, little is made of the fact that Moody and Larry
Riley, who plays her husband, are black. The producers believe that
makes a better statement than having race as an issue in the
stories.
   ``It's exciting, and it's a role that suits me so well,'' Moody
said. ``I like the soap opera formula. I like the idea of building
a character who's exciting and challenging. She's a bright lady,
but she has a lot of problems. She has problems with her family,
with her career and with her neighbors. But she has no problems
because she's black. They're all human problems.
   ``When they first talked about bringing in a new family, I don't
know if they were to be white or black,'' she said. ``I don't know
what the talk was before they decided on us. I know they were
losing some important characters and there was a house available in
the cul-de-sac.''
   The vacancy in the Lorimar show came when Laura Avery, played by
Constance McCashin, died in the 200th episode. Her bequest to Karen
(Michele Lee) asked that her house be rented to a family ``she'd
love to have next door.''
   The new family, who joined the show in January, also underwent a
transformation of sorts. They were rather mysterious, at times even
obsessive, until it was revealed last month they were in a witness
protection program living under assumed names.
   Moody's character had been the witness to a major crime and is
actually a neurologist, not a bank teller. Her husband had been a
police detective and was bitter at having to give up his career.
That, of course, created a lot of tension between them.
   ``I found out my name was really Nela Stewart Sollars,'' Moody
said. ``I told the writers I hated the name Williams. They put it
in the script, which made it more personal. But now it makes sense
they would pick a common name to hide under.''
   Moody said that despite her problems, the character is not angry
nor hostile. ``She's warm and sensuous. I love playing a role with
all these dimensions. Usually you don't get all these sides
exposed. I can't wait to find out what problems I'll have next
year. I've never been an independent woman who has all these
layers. It's great to be able to slam doors and be dramatic.''
   On ``Roots'' and ``Roots: The Next Generations,'' Moody played
Irene Harvey, the great-grandmother of author Alex Haley. She was
married to Tom Harvey, played by Georg Stanford Brown.
   ``Irene was very colorful,'' she said. ``She collected flowers
and dyed clothing. She had a lot of Indian blood in her. The slaves
sometimes ran away and lived with the Indians.''
   One of the first roles she ever played was that of a slave in an
eighth-grade school play in Evanston, Ill. ``The times were
different then,'' she recalled. ``There were no roles for black
girls. Then I played a slave and I got teased by my friends. In
high school there were no roles for me. The schools were integrated
but there were a lot of restrictions.''
   She was on ``Soap'' for two seasons as the love interest to Ted
Wass. ``We had a lot of bi-racial jokes,'' she said. ``It wasn't
daring but it was fun and I got to work with a lot of brilliant
people.''
   Her other series were ``E-R,'' which lasted only briefly, and
``That's My Mama.''
   Moody, who is single, spends much of her time working for Save
the Whales International. She's on the advisory board, which is
based in Lahaina, Hawaii.
   ``I helped rescue a pink dolphin in the Amazon,'' she said. ``I
helped organize the effort. They were endangered by the
construction of a dam. We're trying to convince people in Brazil to
encourage people to come see the dolphins, not to kill them. In
Hawaii, whale watching alone brings in $10 million a year.''
   Moody has been a guest on many network episodic shows and
starred in such movies as ``Lost in London,'' ``Wait Till Your
Mother Gets Home,'' ``Goldie and the Boxer,'' ``Some Kind of
Hero,'' ``White Dog'' and ``Las Vegas Lady.''

<HEAD>Presidential Veto on Foreign Takeovers Draws Critics</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Also on financial wires.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By MARIANN CAPRINO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Giving the president authority to stop a foreign
company from acquiring an American concern if national security is
in jeopardy may be a case of protectionism in sheep's clothing,
some experts say.
   The measure, a small part of the sweeping trade legislation that
lawmakers reached tentative agreement on this past week, is
supported by American businesses. But critics argue that the
government already has the ability to throw road blocks in the path
of foreigners and that further power might prevent combinations
that make sense.
   The administration has threatened to veto the trade bill unless
major changes are made, but it has no objections to the foreign
takeover provision.
   To protect the overseas transfer of vital technology, the
provision would allow the White House to call for an investigation
and, ultimately, to use an executive order to block a takeover that
threatened national security.
   ``In the hands of a president ideologically predisposed to
keeping foreigners out, this could be a mischievous weapon,'' said
Robert Reich, a professor of political economics at Harvard
University's John F. Kennedy School of Government.
   A depressed dollar coupled with stock prices still discounted
from October's market crash have made U.S. companies relatively
cheap buys for foreigners. ``It's as if America is having a fire
sale, and there's no reason to think that the trend will stop any
time soon,'' Reich said.
   Yet even in the face of a stepped-up number of foreign
acquisitions, ``no one has made a credible case that the current
protections are not enough,'' said Gregg Jarrell, former chief
economist at the Securities and Exchange Commission.
   Indeed, the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United
States, comprised of officials from a number of government
agencies, is one stop-gap group that can recommend against a
foreign takeover, said Stephen Cooney, director of international
investment and finance for the National Association of
Manufacturers.
   He noted the committee raised objections to Allegheny Ludlum
Corp.'s plan to sell a division to Japan's Nippon Steel a few years
ago, and the offer eventually was dropped.
   In addition, it is almost impossible for a foreign company to
buy an American firm involved in classified research and
development because foreigners can be denied security clearances,
Reich noted. The government also could cancel existing contracts if
a defense company were acquired in an undesireable takeover.
   On a more subtle level, the fear of bad relations with the
United States may be enough to deter at least some foreign
companies whose overtures have been frowned upon.
   Last year, for example, Fujitsu Ltd. of Japan dropped an
agreement to buy 80 percent of Fairchild Semiconductor Corp.
because of a political uproar in Washington.
   While the Japanese are particularly sensitive to government and
corporate resistance, others may be more headstrong.
   Sen. J. James Exon, the Nebraska Democrat who co-sponsored the
provision, said he became concerned about foreign takeovers of U.S.
defense industries two years ago when British financier Sir James
Goldsmith tried to buy out Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co.
   It took a major restructuring on the part of the nation's
largest tire maker _ including the repurchase of half its shares
and the sale of several units _ to successfully thwarted the
takeover.
   Exon said the administration initially was against his proposal,
fearing it would have a chilling effect on foreign investment in
the United States.
   But he countered that that is precisely what it should do. ``We
should have a law that has a chilling effect on foreigners trying
to buy our defense technology,'' he said.
   The position at the National Association of Manufacturers is one
of support, but Cooney noted that ``if the trade bill didn't have
the provision, we wouldn't be demanding it.''
   Under terms of the proposal, which would amend the Defense
Production Act of 1950, the president would have to call for an
investigation of a foreign takeover offer before he could block the
bid. The probe would have to be completed in 45 days.
   ``That's a very typical anti-takeover barrier,'' inasmuch as it
results in a delay that can be harmful to the acquisition process,
said Jarrell, a director of research at Chicago-based Alcar Group.

   Because the call for an investigation would be discretionary,
the potential exists that the administration would be the target of
intense lobbying. ``Since when does the administration want to be
dragged into every heated tender offer battle?'' Jarrell asked.
   Many critics also fear that ``national security'' could be
defined as too broad an umbrella.
   ``This is a nebulous area, but people are wandering off the
reservation on this,'' Cooney said. ``The definitions make it quite
clear the proposal can only relate national security as it relates
to defense production and defense preparedness.''
   Exon said it would be ``pretty difficult'' to broaden the
measure to cover oil and steel companies, although he noted that it
would be ``a decision of how broad the president of the United
States wanted to interpret it.''
   Critics have labeled the proposal blatant protectionism.
Harvard's Reich argues that the problem the nation faces is not one
of foreigners snapping up domestic corporations.
   ``Stopping foreign investment in the United States is no way to
cure the fundamental problem, which is that we are spending too
much and producing too litte,'' he said. ``Americans are not nearly
as productive as they need to be.''
   In other news, the government reported this past week:
   _The civilan unemployment rate fell to a decade low of 5.6
percent during February.
   _Construction spending, held back by weakness in the residential
sector, fell 0.3 percent in February for the third consecutive
monthly decline.
   _The Index of Leading Indocators rose 0.9 percent in February in
a performance that analysts said should allay recession worries.
   _New home sales broke a three-month slide by jumping 20.3
percent in February.
   _Orders to U.S. factories for manufactured goods fell 0.8
percent, the second consecutive monthly decline.
   _Prices farmers got for raw products at mid-March were unchanged
from February and up 7.4 percent from a year earlier.
   _Federal spending averaged nearly $3,433 per American in 1987,
about $41 more than the year before.
   In other business news:
   _American builders will be allowed to bid on Japanese
construction projects under a new agreement aimed at ending a trade
dispute that has soured relations between the United States and
Japan.
   _A study commissioned by U.S. automakers claimed five Japanese
automakers have been dumping small trucks on the U.S. market,
costing U.S. workers jobs and the U.S. auto industry $500 million
in lost wages, sales and profits.
   _The Internal Revenue Service said it will waive penalties for
underpayments of estimated tax on most types of retirement income
for 1987.
   _The federal fund that insures deposits in commercial banks
could suffer a loss in 1988 for the first time in its 54-year
history, Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. Chairman L. William
Seidman warned.
   _An appeals court ruled Congress unconstitutionally singled out
publisher Rupert Murdoch by prohibiting his continued ownership of

   Oil trading has turned slow and lackluster with
the approach of the holiday weekend.
   Oil prices were mixed Thursday in dull trading on the New York
Mercantile Exchange. Futures contracts for crude oil were unchanged
to marginally higher, while heating oil contracts declined and
gasoline was mixed.
   Contracts for May delivery of West Texas Intermediate, the
benchmark U.S. crude, settled on the exchange at $17.08 per
42-gallon barrel, unchanged from Wednesday's close.
   Among refined products, the April contract for wholesale heating
oil fell 0.45 cent a gallon to 48.15 cents. Unleaded gasoline for
April delivery edged up by 0.02 cent a gallon to 48.67 cents.
   ``There was no action; it was just dead,'' said Chris McCormack,
a futures broker for investment firm Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.
   The Mercantile Exchange is closed Friday in observance of the
Good Friday holiday. McCormack noted that the bulk of the limited
activity stemmed from traders balancing out their positions in
advance of the weekend.
   Market participants are looking ahead to an upcoming meeting of
the pricing committee of the 13-nation Organization of Petroleum

   Magdalena Barut didn't need the money, but she
was bored; tired of ``just chasing the chickens around the yard''
of the Maui home she has lived in since 1954.
   So, on a whim, the 67-year-old Barut applied for a job at
McDonald's, figuring she would be rejected because of her age.
   But not only has McDonald's hired Barut and other senior
citizens like her, the nationwide hamburger chain also lets them
pick their own shifts, gives them 20 hours of training for just one
task _ Barut learned to make french fries _ and in some cases
drives them to and from work.
   ``I don't know I was worried about getting turned down,'' said
Barut, who has been promoted to running a cash register. ``I guess
we just didn't figure how desperate they are for workers around
here.''
   McDonalds _ which traditionally hires high school students for
part-time, minimum-wage jobs _ is only one of the many companies
facing a labor crunch in Hawaii.
   Businesses on the islands of Oahu, Kauai and Maui and Hawaii,
especially those dependent on the ever-burgeoning tourist industry,
are scrambling for workers as the state's unemployment rate falls
to record lows and soon-to-open luxury resorts compete for the
existing work force.
   The state department of Labor and Industrial Relations reported
a statewide unemployment rate of just 3.3 percent for February, the
most recent data available.
   ``Basically, everybody's got a job who wants one,'' according to
a spokeswoman from the Hawaii Visitors Bureau, who said the state's
reputation could suffer if hotels, restaurants and other
tourist-related businesses could not hire enough people to serve
their guests.
   ``The aloha spirit is one of the prime attractions of Hawaii,''
said the spokeswoman, who asked not to be named. ``If that begins
to change because there are not enough people to fill all the jobs,
we could have a serious problem.''
   A report by the labor department's Tourism and Training Council
projected an average of 6,400 workers would be needed each year to
meet job openings forecast for Hawaii, Kauai and Maui counties
through 1995. But the study found that after this year, only about
1,600 people _ or one-fourth the demand _ would enter the job
market each year until then.
   Those dim projections helped convince McDonalds to turn to
senior citizens to fill its employee gaps. Other companies have
taken more drastic measures.
   The Westin Maui Hotel in Kaanapali, in a joint venture with the
state, helps ferry workers from the nearby island of Molokai, where
a declining pineapple industry led to a 5.8 percent unemployment
rate in February. Other businesses followed suit.
   ``Maui had a low unemployment rate and Molokai had a high one,
so we decided to work together,'' said Lindsey Geyer, the director
of human resources at the Westin Maui.
   Although many are basking in the glow of the state's ``full
employment,'' others say the prevalence of tourist-related jobs _
which account for about one third of the employment in the state _
means many residents earn less than they would in other industries.
Since Hawaii's cost of living is about 26 percent higher than the
national average, many people struggle to make ends meet.
   ``The islands may be paradise, but there also very expensive,''
said Geyer. Educators in the state are also concerned; they say
that because of the proliferation of jobs, young people who would
otherwise go to college are lured away to the work world.
   And economists say that full employment could trigger higher
inflation, because when businesses compete for employees _ offering
more pay and better fringe benefits _ the cost is ultimately passed
on to the consumer.
   Then, of course, there are the tourists.
   1987 was a record year for tourism in the state, with about 5.7
million people visiting the islands, 3.3 percent more than the year
before, according to the visitors bureau.
   ``Today's traveler and tomorrow's traveler want more service,
and that's labor intensive,'' said Dorothy Bremner, employment
analyst for the labor department's Tourism and Training Council.
   An obvious cure _ enticing more people to work and live here _
could be painful.
   ``Bringing people in presents plenty of other problems, and our
infrastruture is already overloaded,'' Bremner said. ``You'll find
very few people interested in making it any more crowded here.''
   A better solution, she says, is to upgrade the skills of the
people who already live here, and make jobs in the tourist industry
career opportunities rather than just average-wage occupations.

   The Southeast economy continues to benefit from a
depressed dollar, especially the region's manufacturing and
agriculture sectors, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of
Atlanta.
   ``Regional manufacturing continues to expand, especially for
textiles and paper,'' the Atlanta Fed said in a periodic report
prepared for the latest meeting of the Federal Open Market
Committee.
   ``The petroleum and coal extraction industries are reviving,''
the report said. ``Although retailers' sales are not increasing
much when compared to last year, inventories are not excessive and
auto sales are improving'' in the Atlanta district, which covers
all or parts of six Southeastern states.
   ``Loan demand has turned up at commercial banks and tourism has
posted healthy gains. The outlook for agriculture is positive
thanks in part to government programs. Although commercial
construction continues at a low ebb, residential building is
improving in some areas.''
   The analysis was prepared for the ``beige book'' used by the
FOMC for its meeting Tuesday. The committee meets about every six
weeks to set the nation's monetary policy.
   Nationally, the analysis said, ``reports confirm a moderate
expansion. ... Strength in the manufacturing sector and continued
moderate growth in employment are sustaining the current
expansion.''
   The Atlanta district covers all of Georgia, Florida and Alabama,
the eastern half of Tennessee and the southern halves of
Mississippi and Louisiana.

<TEXT>
   The merger between the photofinishing
operations of Eastman Kodak Co. and Fuqua Industries Inc. has had a
rocky trip through the court system and the journey is not over yet.
   U.S. Supreme Court Justice Byron White on Thursday set aside a
lower court's decision to allow the merger to go through.
   It was unclear what effect this temporary ruling would have,
since the merger was completed before White's ruling.
   Fuqua President Lawrence Klamon said he didn't think it would
change anything and Kodak asked White to reconsider.
   ``This has no practical effect on the merger,'' Klamon said from
Fuqua's headquarters in Atlanta. ``It's a done deal. This is a moot
point.''
   The legal wrestling over the merger comes as a result of a
lawsuit filed by a small wholesale photofinishing competitor,
Phototron Corp. of San Bernardino, Calif., which claims the merger
violates antitrust laws.
   In court documents, Phototron claims that together Kodak and
Fuqua's subsidiary, Colorcraft Corp., would control between 65
percent to 88 percent of the wholesale photofinishing market.
   ``This merger would require us to get into a closet with a
gorilla,'' said Joseph Alioto, the San Francisco attorney who is
representing Phototron.
   The company's lawsuit was filed in Fort Worth, Texas, and a
judge there on Feb. 22 blocked the merger until he could hear the
case and issue a ruling.
   Kodak and Fuqua, however, appealed that decision to the U.S.
Court of Appeals in New Orleans, where a three-judge panel on
Monday reversed that decision.
   Those judges said Phototron had no right to stop the merger and
gave Kodak and Fuqua permission to merge.
   The two companies immediately combined operations the next day,
forming a new company called Qualex Inc., which has 94 processing
labs around the country and is based in Durham, N.C., which had
been the home of Colorcraft.
   Wholesale photofinishers primarily process film and print
photographs for supermarkets, discount store chains and drug stores.
   White's decision to set aside the Court of Appeals ruling until
Tuesday when additional arguments on the case can be heard further
muddles the situtation.
   Alioto said the ruling means the merger will have to be
dismantled.
   ``They acted too fast and now they have to face the
consequences,'' he said. ``Whatever was done has to be undone.''
   But Klamon, who is an attorney, said White's decision will have
no practical effect on the merger. He explained it using an analogy
of a car approaching a stop light.
   He said the federal judge in Fort Worth turned the light red as
the Kodak-Colorcraft merger approached. The Court of Appeals turned
the light green and the merger went on its way, Klamon said.
   Now, Phototron has convinced the Supreme Court to turn the light
red again, but it no longer matters because the merger has already
passed through the intersection.
   Klamon said he expects the high court to dismiss White's order
on Tuesday once it finds out that the merger has already proceeded.
   Kodak spokesman Paul Allen said the company's attorneys are
still reviewing the decision.
   Regardless of the outcome of the Supreme Court fight,
Phototron's original lawsuit against Kodak will continue in U.S.
District Court in Fort Worth and a decision there could still force
the merger to unravel, Alioto said.

<HEAD>Tisch Says Neither Loews' Stake in CBS Nor CBS Network For Sale</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SKIP WOLLENBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The head of CBS Inc. says he has had no
discussions about selling either the CBS television network or
Loews Corp.'s stake in CBS and says neither one is for sale.
   Laurence A. Tisch, chief executive of CBS, told CBS employees in
an unusual memorandum on Thursday that he is committed to the
long-term prospects of CBS and wants its television network to
reclaim first place in the ratings.
   But he added, ``We know it will take several years _ not a few
months _ to get there.''
   In recent weeks, rumors have spread that Tisch might be
interested in selling the CBS television network while keeping the
CBS radio and television stations.
   Alternatively, there were rumors that Tisch planned to engineer
the sale of the 24.9 percent stake in CBS held by Loews, a New
York-based holding company with interests in tobacco, real estate
and financial services that Tisch also heads.
   Tisch addressed both issues in the memo, saying neither the
block of CBS stock held by Loews nor the CBS network is for sale.
   ``Let me go further. I have met with no one, had no conversation
and have received no offer for the sale of Loews' CBS stock or the
CBS network. If you hear or read anything to the contrary, it is
absolutely, totally and categorically untrue,'' he said.
   On Wall Street, CBS fell 62.5 cents a share to $156.37{ in
trading on the New York Stock Exchange.
   Speculation about Tisch's plans has been fueled by the CBS
network's steady decline in prime-time audience ratings. CBS is
expected to finish in last place among the three major networks
this season, and some analysts have questioned whether Tisch has
the patience to wait for a revival.
   But Tisch said Loews bought its stake in CBS because it felt
``this is a good investment in a premier company in a special
business _ broadcasting.''
   ``Nothing has changed that belief. Loews was not looking for a
quick turnaround. That has never been the Loews style,'' he said.
   Since he became chief executive of CBS in the fall of 1986, CBS
has sold its records, books and magazine divisions, amassing about
$3 billion in cash.
   Tisch said the sales have allowed CBS to focus on its basic
business.
   He conceded he has offered ``some gloomy comments'' about the
economic outlook and its potential effect of the broadcasting
business.
   But he said those views have ``nothing to do with my deep
personal interest in and my commitment to the long-term prospects
of CBS.''
   ``We are committed to build a schedule that makes us first
again. With our eye on that long-term goal, we shouldn't be overly
concerned about small setbacks,'' he wrote.

<TEXT>
   British industrialist Brian Beazer says
Koppers Co. is trying to confuse its employees and Pittsburgh
supporters over his $1.7 billion takeover offer. Koppers says
Beazer is the one confused.
   ``Koppers management has diverted attention to irrelevant
subjects such as the role of our financial advisers ... but they
have never responded to the key questions,'' Beazer PLC, the
construction and building materials company, said Thursday in
newspaper advertisements.
   ``We have asked Koppers management again and again to sit down
and discuss our proposal,'' the ad said. ``Instead, they have
mounted a massive campaign of disinformation, creating panic and
confusion among Koppers employees and the Pittsburgh community.''
   Koppers Vice President J. Roger Beidler, responding to the ad at
a news conference, said Beazer has misconstrued Koppers' profit
margins and employment trends.
   Koppers again criticized Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. for being
an equity partner with Beazer in BNS Inc., the company formed to
launch the $60-per-share takeover.
   The investment bank overstepped the traditional role to become a
corporate raider, Beidler said.
   Shearson has said it is merely helping finance the tender offer.
   U.S. Sen. John Heinz, meanwhile, failed Wednesday to amend a
banking bill with language to bar another Beazer backer, National
Westminster Bank PLC, from its role as an equity partner in BNS,
said Richard Bryers, an aide to Heinz. But the senator won a
promise from Banking Committee Chairman William Proxmire to hold
hearings in April on the Heinz measure as separate legislation, the
aide said.
   At a news conference called by U.S. Rep. Doug Walgren, D-Pa.,
Robert A. Papariella, 38, said he resigned his job as a vice
president of investments in Shearson's Pittsburgh office in protest
of the firm's role in the Koppers takeover attempt.
   Papariella, repeating claims made by Koppers and its allies,
including Heinz, said Shearson stands to make $150 million or more
in fees on the takeover.
   Shearson spokesman Michael O'Neill said the figure is
inaccurate, but he declined to offer a specific figure.
   Beidler, meanwhile, said Beazer was mistaken when he claimed
recently he could improve Koppers' profit margins in construction
materials from 10 percent to the industry average of 20 percent.
   Beidler said Beazer misconstrued companywide margins for those
of one segment. Koppers' margins in sand and gravel exceed 20
percent, and margins in crushed stone are near 20 percent, he said.
   ``He's going to find very little room ... to achieve that kind
of improvement,'' Beidler said at a news conference. ``Koppers has
been running the business as well or better than most companies.''
   Beazer's ad tried to dispel fears expressed by Koppers and its
allies that a takeover could elmininate 1,100 Pittsburgh-area jobs
and sap the local economy of an estimated $232 million per year.
   ``All Beazer companies have retained their local offices,'' the
ad said. mentioning Gifford-Hill in Dallas, Squires in Charlotte,
N.C.; Cohn Communities in Atlanta; Phillips Builders in Nashville,
Tenn.; Tidewater Construction Co. in Norfolk, Va.; and FK Co. in
Farmington, N.M.
   The ad said employment at Koppers has declined from 18,000 to
1,000, while employment at Beazer has grown from 4,000 to 18,000 in
the past five years.
   Beidler said Koppers eliminated about 9,700 jobs through asset
sales and attrition but added about 6,000 through growth in its
businesses. Employment declined from 14,500 in 1983 to 10,700 in
1987, he said.
   Beazer said Koppers' efforts to find a white knight could lead
to consequences worse that Beazer's plan to sell the chemical
businesses if it gains control.
   ``Remember, it was `white knight' Chevron that emptied the Gulf
Building,'' Beazer said.
   Opponents of the Beazer bid, including federal, state and local
elected officials, say they don't want the landmark Koppers
Building in Pittsburgh to be emptied as Gulf Corp.'s headquarters
were after T. Boone Pickens drove the oil company into a merger
with Chevron.
   ``Every company we've acquired has improved its performance and
profitability, with corresponding growth in opportunities and
benefits for employees,'' Beazer said.

   The dollar was virtually motionless in foreign
exchange trading in Europe today as activity wound down to a bare
minimum ahead of the Easter weekend. The U.S. currency remained at
a 6-year low against the pound.
   With most Asian and European markets closed for Good Friday and
with corporate clients standing on the sidelines, foreign exchange
rooms that were open were mostly idle, traders said.
   The only European foreign exchange markets open today were those
in Luxembourg, France and Italy, ``but they are all lying low,''
one trader in Milan said. ``There is absolutely no direction at all.
   Gold markets in London, Zurich and Hong Kong were closed.
   In Tokyo, where the business day ends as Europe's begins, the
dollar closed at 124.10 yen, down 0.40 yen from Thursday despite
some light intervention by the Bank of Japan, dealers said. Later
in Europe, the dollar was quoted at 124.05 yen.
   Other dollar rates in Europe at midmorning, compared with late
Thursday's rates, included: 1.6558 West German marks, up from
1.6555; 1.3613 Swiss francs, down from 1.3635; 5.6250 French

1,228.00 Italian lire, down from 1,229.50; and 1.2347 Canadian

   The British pound was quoted at $1.8885 _ a six-year high for
the second day in a row _ compared with $1.8878 Thursday.

   The dollar and stock prices fell on Tokyo markets
today as trading decreased with the approach of the Easter holidays
in the United States and Europe.
   The U.S. currency opened at 124.30 yen and traded between a
narrow range of 124.05-124.50 yen. It finished the week at 124.10
yen, down 0.40 yen from Thursday's close of 124.50 yen.
   ``There is not much happening,'' said Peter Tasker, head of
research at Kleinwort Benson. ``The dollar is weak and unpopular,''
he said, and a ``poor supply and demand'' contributed to the
currency's fall.
   The Bank of Japan intervened immediately after the foreign
exchange opened for dealing to prop up the sagging currency, but
Tasker said the amount of dollars the central bank bought was very
small.
   The intervention was a ritual, he added. The bank does not
publicly comment on its activities.
   ``It's the Easter holiday and people are not doing anything,''
added a dealer at a major American securities firm, speaking on
condition of anonymity.
   Traders said they are anticipating a weak dollar in the new 1988
fiscal year that began today. ``The dollar will be wobbly,'' Tasker
said, ``but it probably will not fall below 120 yen.''
   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, meanwhile, the Nikkei Stock Average
of 225 selected issues fell for a second consecutive day and lost
156.04 points, or 0.59 percent. It closed at 26,104.22 points.
   The loss was in ``reaction to an incredibly strong rise over the
past week,'' Tasker said, referring to the 1,000-point gain the
Nikkei averaged Monday through Wednesday. On Thursday, the main
market barometer lost 59.81 points.
   Traders predicted the market would be quiet and show little
direction during its half-day session Saturday because of the
Easter weekend.

Measure</HEAD>

   Government leaders and Toshiba Corp. executives
today condemned a U.S. congressional move to punish the electronics
giant for a subsidiary's sale of militarily sensitive machines to
the Soviet Union.
   Officials charged the United States was overstepping its
boundaries by adding its own penalties to those already taken by
Japan.
   The government hinted it might bring the matter before the
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade if the measure becomes law.
   ``The United States is seeking to unilaterally impose its own
penalties in disregard of the independence of other countries,''
Trade Minister Hajime Tamura said in a statement to reporters.
``This is extremely regrettable.''
   Toshiba Corp. President Joichi Aoi expressed regret, saying his
company had been unaware of Toshiba Machine Co.'s illegal sale to
the Soviets. He urged U.S. lawmakers to reconsider.
   Congressional negotiators reached tentative agreement Thursday
night on a sweeping trade bill designed to open foreign markets.
The measure would ban U.S. government purchases of Toshiba
equipment for three years and bar the import Toshiba Machine Co.
products for the same period.
   Kyodo News Service said Toshiba Corp. escaped the worst possible
scenario in which it stood to lose its entire U.S. export market
worth $2 billion a year. It said Toshiba Machine Co. faces the loss
of $136 million a year.
   The Reagan administration has threatened to veto the bill
because of the Toshiba provisions and other measures.
   The Japanese government determined last spring that Toshiba
Machine Co. sold to the Soviets sophisticated machinery capable of
silencing submarine propellers. The sales violated Japan's own
export laws and those of COCOM, the Western body that monitors such
sales to Communist nations.
   The U.S. congressional agreement ``runs counter to a basic
principle of COCOM that effective enforcement of export controls is
entrusted to each participating country's autonomous
responsibility,'' Foreign Minister Sosuke Uno said in a separate
statement.
   He said the bill would, ``if adopted and implemented, violate
the GATT provisions, which the Government of Japan cannot
overlook.''

   The Columbia Record, the capital city's
afternoon newspaper for 91 years, ceases publication with today's
edition.
   ``We will add 10,000 papers to the press run,'' Acting Managing
Editor Bunny Richardson said Thursday. ``Employees want them,
people in the street want them and we've had people calling us who
are not subscribers asking us where they can get a copy.
   ``There will be a lot of reminiscing in it from old Record
staffers. They have the same feeling that we have here now: the
camaraderie, the feeling of family, the feistiness of a small
newspaper.''
   The demise of the Record was announced Jan. 20 by Publisher Ben
R. Morris, who said the readers and advertisers of the area can be
served better by concentrating resources in a single daily
newspaper, The State.
   ``There will be other news in the Record other than its ceasing
publication,'' Ms. Richardson said. ``We still have to put out a
newspaper and that will keep us from feeling sad.''
   The Record staff will be merged with that of The State. Both
newspapers are owned by the Knight-Ridder newspaper group.

<HEAD>GE To Proceed Unopposed With Offer For Roper</HEAD>
<DATELINE>AUGUSTA, Ga. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The battle to acquire Roper Corp. appeared
to be over with the announcement that Whirlpool Corp. was ending
its bid, allowing General Electric Co. to proceed unopposed with a
$507.6 million offer.
   A spokesman for GE said the Fairfield, Conn.-based company would
extend its offer until 5 p.m. Monday. But Robert Cook, chairman of
Augusta-based Roper, indicated he expected the deal to go through
quickly and smoothly.
   ``I'd say it's over,'' Cook said. ``We had alrady told our
stockholders to tender to GE two days ago.''
   GE and Whirlpool said early Thursday that negotiations were
continuing over their rival bids for Roper, a manufacturer of
appliances and lawn equipment.
   But the companies announced Thursday night that Whirlpool was
terminating its $50-per-share offer for Roper.
   GE is offering Roper $54 per share.
   According to the GE announcement, GE will be free to acquire
Roper and its manufacturing capacity for kitchen ranges and lawn
equipment. Whirlpool obtains rights to the Roper name for major
appliances.
   GE will supply Whirlpool with electric and gas ranges for the
Roper brand for at least two years under the agreement.
   Also, Whirlpool will relinquish its $37.50 per share option on
1.6 million Roper shares upon the completion of GE's tender offer.
And the companies agreed to various commercial relationships in
which GE will sell to Whirlpool certain industrial components and
materials.
   The battle to acquire Roper began last November, and led to a
series of lawsuits charging, among other things, that Roper and
Whirlpool engaged in activities designed to hinder GE's ability to
bid competitively for the Augusta company.
   Thursday's agreement called for the withdrawal of all lawsuits
upon the completion of GE's tender offer.
   ``For GE, the Roper factories and Roper's strong Sears
relationship makes this an important niche acquisition that will
significantly strengthen our appliance business in an increasingly
competitive global market,'' said Roger W. Schipke, GE senior vice
president in charge of the company's appliance business.
   ``Gaining the Roper brand name was one of Whirlpool's key
strategic objectives in pursuing this acquisition,'' said David R.
Whitwam, chairman, president and chief executive officer of Benton
Harbor, Mich.-based Whirlpool.
   ``With our complementary KitchenAid, Whirlpool and Roper brands,
Whirlpool plans to compete vigorously in all segments of the major
home appliance market,'' Whitwam said.
   ``The amicable settlement is beneficial to both parties, and is
the foundation for a strong, expanded supplier relationship with
Whirlpool,'' GE's Schipke said.

<HEAD>Japanese Feel Anger, Regret On Breakdown Of Beef, Citrus Talks</HEAD>
<HEAD>With PM-US-Japan Foodstuffs</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Officials reacted with regret and anger today after
talks between Agriculture Minister Takashi Sato and U.S. officials
failed to produce an agreement on Japan's restricted imports of
beef and citrus fruits.
   Sato began three days of talks in Washington on Tuesday in hopes
of renegotiating a four-year bilateral agreement setting quotas on
U.S. beef and citrus exports to Japan. No progress was made, and
the accord expired Thursday.
   Shintaro Abe, secretary-general of the governing Liberal
Democratic Party, told reporters, ``I am disappointed the talks
ended with differences between the positions of the two countries
still too great, but Sato did his best.''
   Sato's delegation ``made efforts to explain the situation in
Japan, but could not regrettably come to an agreement,'' said a
Foreign Ministry spokesman.
   In Washington, U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter said
the United States requested an emergency meeting next week of the
General Agreement on Tarrifs and Trade, where it will ask that a
panel be formed to review U.S. complaints. GATT is an international
body for settling trade disputes.
   Sato is scheduled to return Sunday to Japan, according to an
Agriculture Ministry official who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Mitsugu Horiuchi, chairman of the powerful Central Union of
Agricultural Cooperatives, issued a strong statement accusing the
United States of refusing to hear out Japan.
   ``Though the situation making it impossible for Japan to
liberalize its market for imported beef and citrus fruits was
repeatedly expressed during the talks, the United States government
refused to listen and continued to one-sidedly push for total
liberalization or a decision by GATT,'' the statement said.
   Horuchi said his organization would continue to urge the
government to maintain beef and citrus quotas, saying ``this is the
concensus of Japan's 5.5 million farmers.''
   Japan has insisted in past talks with the United States that a
liberalized market for beef and citrus imports would have a
detrimental effect on domestic producers and lead to unemployment.
   But the United States has demanded Japan remove its quotas and
has refused to negotiate unless Japan proposed a timetable for
liberalization, something Japan has yet to do.

<HEAD>Northwest Airlines Hires TWA Veteran To Head Operations</HEAD>
<DATELINE>EAGAN, Minn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   William D. Slattery, a 16-year veteran of
TWA, has been hired by Northwest Airlines to head the
Minnesota-based carrier's flight, maintenance, cargo and ground
handling operations.
   Slattery, 45, replaces Benjamin Griggs Jr., who was promoted
earlier this week to executive vice president of NWA Inc., the
parent company of Northwest, the carrier announced Thursday.
   Slattery, who will carry the title of vice president of
operations, also will handle the duties of Tom Koors, the executive
vice president of customer services who resigned last week, the
company said.
   Slattery's most immediate challenge is to reconcile the policies
and practices of former Northwest and Republic Airlines flight and
maintenance operations.
   Northwest merged with Republic in August 1986. The combined
airline has continued to operate internally as two airlines,
although marketing, financial and accounting functions have been
merged.
   Slattery's appointment is the latest in a series of changes
designed to bring the airline's operating functions under a single
responsibility, said Steven Rothmeier, Northwest chairman and chief
executive officer.
   Slattery also will be faced with helping to reach contracts with
pilots and the International Association of Machinists, the union
that represents 20,000 mechanics, baggage handlers, reservations
agents and transportation agents.
   Slattery is perhaps best know for getting Braniff Inc. off the
ground again in March 1984 after its bankruptcy and reorganization
in 1982. Slattery was president of Braniff for less than a year
when he resigned amid speculation that Braniff Chairman Jay
Pritzker was undermining his authority.
   Slattery, who began his airline career as a sales representative
for Trans World Airlines Inc., became vice president of TWA's
international division before leaving for Braniff.

<HEAD>Hutton To Plead Guilty To Felony Counts For Money Laundering</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   E.F. Hutton & Co. says it will plead
guilty to up to three felony counts and pay a fine for money
laundering _ some which was conducted for organized crime figures _
at its Providence branch.
   The company revealed details of a pending agreement with the
U.S. Justice Department and the U.S. Attorney's office in Rhode
Island in a mandatory quarterly report to the Securities and
Exchange Commission.
   Federal authorities have been investigating allegations that
Hutton, which was acquired last year by Shearson Lehman Brothers
Inc., failed to report cash transactions over $10,000 conducted by
its Providence branch as required by law.
   U.S. Attorney Lincoln C. Almond said some of the $1.2 million in
transactions involved were for organized crime figures, while
others were for ``legitimate'' businessmen trying to hide income
from the IRS.
   Almond revealed a week ago his office and the Justice
Department's New England Organized Crime Strike Force were
negotiating a guilty plea in the case.
   Almond and John Voorhees, attorney in charge of the strike
force's Providence office, declined to comment on the SEC report,
which was filed on Wednesday.
   Companies are required to report to the SEC any activities that
could affect their status as licensed investment dealers.
   Under SEC rules, a felony conviction could result in the total
suspension of business. But a spokesman for Shearson Lehman Hutton
Inc. in New York said Thursday the company expects to receive
waivers from the SEC that will allow it to continue operating.
   In its SEC report, Hutton said the investigation will result in
criminal charges, as opposed to civil penalties that could be
imposed under federal law.
   The company said it will plead guilty to ``no more than three''
felony counts'' and that the allegations ``will result in a fine
being imposed in an amount yet to be determined.''
   Most of the illegal transactions involved Stephen Fusco, a
Hutton broker who died of cancer in December 1985. Fusco allegedly
helped customers break large sums of money into amounts less than
$10,000 that were then deposited into their accounts. The scheme is
known as structuring.
   Most of the abuses ``took place during 1982 and 1983, and none
occurred later than August 1984,'' the company told the SEC.
   Michael O'Neill, a spokesman for Shearson Lehman Hutton, said
Thursday that the company does not expect any ``adverse impact on
the business.''
   Last October, the SEC found that Hutton had violated provisions
of the SEC law and rules relating to financial record keeeping and
reporting of currency transactions.
   As a result of the findings, Hutton was censured and directed to
report to the SEC on policies and procedures regarding the receipt
of cash deposits and to adopt surveillance procedures to monitor
deposits of multiple bank checks.

Election</HEAD>

<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A dissident movement within the United Auto
Workers will have another chance to elect one of its members to the
UAW's powerful executive board in a new regional election ordered
by a federal judge.
   Candidate Jerry Tucker lost a June 1986, election against
incumbent Region 5 Director Kenneth Worley by two-tenths of a vote
and protested that the election was tainted by discrepancies.
   On Wednesday, U.S. District Judge Richard Suhrheinrich in
Detroit ordered a new election in the eight-state region, which
covers 80,000 active and laid-off workers in 68 local unions in
Missouri, Kansas, Oklahoma, Arkansas, Louisiana, Texas, Colorado
and New Mexico.
   Tucker and Worley again will compete in the election, which
could be held in 60 to 90 days. A third candidate also reportedly
may enter the race.
   As director of Region 5, the winner will sit with other regional
directors and top union officers on the UAW's core decision-making
body.
   The dissident faction, which calls itself New Directions, seeks
more participation by the rank-and-file in decisions affecting the
1 million-member union and want more open debate about the UAW's
general direction and philosophy.
   Tucker said he is most disturbed by the reluctance of union
leaders, including UAW President Owen Bieber, to allow the
democratic participation by the rank-and-file as provided under the
union's constitution.
   Suhrheinrich also ordered new elections for the region's
approximately 300 convention delegates. The UAW can appeal the
order, but it cannot by law halt the election, set up by the
Department of Labor, which had brought the case.
   UAW officials who asked not to be identified said the union
would appeal if it believed the decision set a precedent that was
harmful to the UAW.
   The Labor Department brought three suits against the UAW,
charging 27 illegal delegates voted in the election, Worley
illegally used union money for his campaign and Tucker was fired
illegally in May 1986 after announcing his candidacy.
   Worley did not return phone calls from The Associated Press on
Thursday.

<HEAD>Chrysler: Eagle Premier; GM: Buick, Olds Extend Program</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JANET BRAUNSTEIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Auto Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Chrysler Corp. says it will offer a $750 rebate
or discount loan financing on its slow-selling new Eagle Premier,
while General Motors Corp. said it was extending its buyer
incentive program on certain Buick and Oldsmobile models.
   Chrysler's new rebate program takes effect today and will
continue indefinitely. The rebate or annual rates of 8.8 percent on
loans of up to 72 months may be applied to purchases or leases of
the Canadian-built car.
   ``Eagle is a brand-new nameplate and customers are still unsure
what it stands for,'' Chris Cedergren, analyst with J.D. Power and
Associates in suburban Los Angeles, said Thursday.
   ``New models, when they are introduced in a market full of
incentives, need incentives on them now to draw attention,'' he
added. Otherwise, buyers ignore the new cars and look for models
bearing sale tags, he said.
   ``Premier needed a level playing field. It has a chance to
compete now because it has incentives on it,'' Cedergren said.
   William Hoglund, a GM vice president and executive in charge of
its Buick-Oldsmobile-Cadillac group, made similar comments earlier
this week about GM's new Buick Regal.
   Despite pricing that GM considered low for a new model, Regal's
sales were disappointing until early March, when GM offered
option-package discounts of up to $900 on the car, Hoglund said.
   On Thursday, Buick and Oldsmobile extended incentives scheduled
to expire April 15 until May 11, following a similar step by
Chevrolet earlier this week.
   Buick extended rebates ranging from $400 to $750 on four models
and option-package discounts on six models including Regal.
Oldsmobile extended similar rebates on four models and option
discounts on six models.
   As of March 20, Chrysler had sold only 5,086 Premier models
since the car's introduction late last year, including 4,894 during
1988. Cedergren said Chrysler had expected Premier to take off
slowly.
   However, he said, the car is reaching its target audience of
well-to-do young buyers who otherwise wouldn't buy Chrysler
products, most of which are aimed at buyers interested in prices
that are usually lower than GM and Ford Motor Co.
   ``It's not pirating sales away from other Chrysler models,''
Cedergren said.
   On the GM products, Buick rebates include $400 on Skylark and
$750 on Century, LeSabre and Electra-Park Avenue. Cars must be
delivered by May 11. Rebates may be used as down payments or taken
in cash.
   Oldsmobile rebates include $400 on Calais and Cutlass Calais and
$750 on Cutlass Ciera, Delta 88 and Ninety-Eight.
   Option-package discounts are available on all rebate models as
well as Buick Regal and Skyhawk and Oldsmobile Cutlass Supreme and
Toronado.

<HEAD>Tropicana Goes To Court to Ensure Top Foe Doesn't Get Juice
Secrets</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BRADENTON, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Tropicana Products Inc. has obtained a
court order in an attempt to ensure that Minute Maid, its top
citrus-juice competitor, doesn't learn trade secrets from an
engineer who switched companies.
   In court documents Tropicana claims Richard A. Hamilton left
last week after 3{-years employment, expressing an ``intense
dislike of Tropicana'' and vowing to ``get'' the company.
   Hamilton began work Monday with Minute Maid, a subsidary of
Coca-Cola Foods, Alice Brink, a spokeswoman at Coca-Cola Foods in
Houston, said Thursday. A judge on Tuesday granted Tropicana's
request to bar Hamilton from divulging ``trade secrets or secret
processes.''
   ``We take this matter very seriously ... It was intended to make
sure (Coca-Cola) cannot get our proprietary secrets,'' said Steven
B. Gold, Tropicana vice president and general counsel.
   Tropicana is considered top in the rapidly growing market for
ready-to-serve citrus juices, with Minute Maid second.
   It would cause ``last and irreparable harm to Tropicana,'' if
Hamilton were to disclose what he knows to Minute Maid _ ``which is
attempting to develop a commercial pasteurized orange juice
product,'' Tropicana said in its court papers.
   Tropicana officials maintain Hamilton told them he was joining
Ardmore Farms, a small, non-competitive juice processor in DeLand.
   Tropicana said its concern was ``heightened when shortly after
leaving Tropicana, (it) discovered that, contrary to his earlier
representations, Hamilton had in fact accepted a position with
Coca-Cola.''
   Before he quit Tropicana, Hamilton told company officials that
Minute Maid representatives had contacted him by telephone at home
and at work ``in an attempt to obtain confidential information
concerning Tropicana's processes,'' court documents contend.
   But Ms. Brink said any attempt to get proprietary information
are ``definitely against our policy.''
   The company told Hamilton in writing not to divulge ``anything
which would breach the confidentiality agreement he signed with
Tropicana. We ask our employees to sign a similar agreement,'' she
said.
   Last month, Seagram Co. Ltd. agreed to buy Tropicana from its
parent, Beatrice U.S. Food Corp. for $1.2 billion.

   General Motors Corp. has decided its high-tech
Teamwork and Technology exhibit was such a hit in New York in
January that it is taking the show on the road.
   The exhibit is scheduled to stop in April 26-27 in Chicago, May
9-10 in Los Angeles, May 23-24 in Dallas, June 6-7 in Atlanta, and
June 13-17 in Warren, Mich.
   At the exhibit, autoworkers, executives and engineers
demonstrated new products, technology and production techniques,
including a working design studio.
   ``We made the point with the New York show that we do have new
products and new technology, and we are making great strides,''
said Jim Crellin, GM's chief spokesman.
   The show also featured concept cars, offering glimpses of the
automotive future, including the Cadillac Voyage. The sleek Voyage
is a four-wheel-drive luxury car with a keyless infrared entry
system and rear-view television.
   The Teamwork and Technology exhibit was held for three days at
New York's Waldorf-Astoria Hotel. Parts of the show have been
displayed in various cities, but most or all of the display will be
reassembled for the new tour.

<TEXT>
   A sharp decline in the size of the American labor force last
month sent the civilian unemployment rate to 5.6 percent, its
lowest level since 1979, the government said today.
   Construction spending fell 0.3 percent in February, held back by
weakness in the residential sector, the Commerce Department said in
another report.
   The third consecutive monthly decline in construction spending
reflected the adverse effects of the new tax law and high vacancy
rates for apartments and office buildings.
   While the number of people at work in March dropped by 306,000,
those either holding jobs or looking for them fell by 445,000, the
Labor Department reported.
   The 0.1 percentage point drop from February's 5.7 percent
jobless rate reflected a decrease of 137,000 _ to 6.8 million _ in
the number of workers listed as unemployed.
   Janet L. Norwood, the commissioner of labor statistics, said a
slowdown in the expansion of the labor force is beginning to be
reflected in unemployment rates, which had, until last month, been
dropping more on the basis of job growth.
   On Thursday, the financial markets gave a mixed performance in
quiet pre-holiday trading, with stock prices modestly higher, the
dollar losing some ground and interest rates holding steady.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 9.94 to 1,988.06,
finishing the week with a gain of 9.11 points. Six issues increased
in value for every five that fell on the New York Stock Exchange.
   In foreign exchange, the dollar headed narrowly lower against
all key currencies while the rising pound continued to take center
stage in trading.
   The dollar hit its lowest level against the pound since January
1982 in London. It cost $1.8878 to buy one pound, more expensive
than $1.8790 late Wednesday. Later, in New York, one pound cost
$1.8874, up from $1.8780.
   In the credit markets, bond prices and interest rates were
narrowly mixed, although the Treausury's bellwether 30-year issue
managed to end the week with a gain of [ point, or $1.25 per $1,000
face amount. The bond's yield, which moves inversely to its price,
slipped to 8.74 percent from 8.76 percent.
   Analysts said traders were reluctant to carry big positions
Thursday ahead of the Easter and Passover holiday weekend,
especially with the unemployment report due.
   Both the stock and bond markets will be closed today. Many
currency dealers did not plan to trade today, while others said
they would work only half a day.

Credit</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The Internal Revenue Service said today that
American corporations' tax payments to the Delvalle government of
Panama will qualify for the U.S. foreign tax credit.
   The announcement cleared the way for U.S. firms that operate in
Panama to pay taxes into a special account at the Federal Reserve
Bank of New York without jeopardizing the tax credit. The credit is
designed to avoid taxation of the same dollar of income by the
United States and a foreign country.
   The action cuts off a source of cash to the financially strapped
regime of Manuel Antonio Noriega in Panama. The Reagan
administration has expressed concern that a recent infusion of
cash, some of it from U.S. corporate tax payments, may have
temporarily strengthened the hold of Noriega.
   The United States recognizes Eric Arturo Delvalle as president.
Delvalle issued a decree on March 25 directing that income taxes
due the government of Panama be paid only to a New York Federal
Reserve Bank.

   French publisher Hachette S.A. said it is
increasing its tender offer for Grolier Inc. to $24 a share, or
$444 million.
   Paris-based Hachette's original offer of $21 a share was
rejected by Grolier, a publisher of encyclopedias headquartered in
Danbury, Conn.
   Grolier had no comment on the increased bid, which as announced
after the market closed on Thursday. Hachette's latest offer is due

   In New York Stock Exchange trading Thursday, Grolier closed at
$24.37{ a share, down 62{ cents.
   Andrew J. Reinhart, Grolier's president and chief operating
officer, said the company will consult with its investment adviser,
First Boston Corp., according to today's editions of The Wall

   Grolier has said it would pursue talks with other interested
parties to negotiate a sale for a ``satisfactory'' price.
   Separately, Hachette said in a statement that the Federal Trade
Commission and the Justice Department terminated the waiting period
under federal antitrust law for Hachette's initial offer.

   The board of Federated Department Stores Inc.
resumed its deliberations today on whether to continue the
retailer's alliance with R.H. Macy & Co. or agree to a buyout by
Campeau Corp.
   The board was meeting in New York, but Federated spokesman Jim
Sluzewski said he had no details about the talks or when an
announcement would be made.
   Sluzewski said the board would meet ``as late as they need to.''
   The board was believed to be considering a $6.73 billion
takeover offer from Macy and a $6.62 billion bid from Campeau.
However, it was possible that higher offers also were on the table.
   The directors had been expected to reach a decision on which
offer to back following an all-day meeting Wednesday. However, they
agreed to continue their talks after Macy submitted a higher bid on
Thursday.
   Wall Street analysts said that even if a decision were announced
today, they did not expect the 2-month-old battle for the nation's
fifth-largest retailer to end soon.
   ``Macy's has a slight edge, but I don't think that it's over,''
Walter Loeb, a retail industry analyst with Morgan Stanley & Co.,
said Thursday. ``There'll be more discussions and more legal
wrangling.''
   For the first time since it announced its cash-and-stock bid a
month ago, Macy placed a value on the stock end of its bid and also
offered shareholders the option of taking all cash for their
shares, Federated said in a statement.
   Macy offered $78.92 a share in cash for 80 percent of
Federated's 89.5 million outstanding shares, and said it would pay
$60 in cash or exchange five shares in the merged company,
Macy's-Federated Inc., for each remaining Federated share. That
would give the deal an aggregate value of $75.14 a share.
   Macy's latest offer superseded a $6.61 billion bid presented at
Wednesday's meeting.
   In its latest bid, Campeau said it would pay $74 a share for
approximately 80 percent of Federated's shares, and the same amount
for the remaining 20 percent after a merger, Federated said.
   Wall Street analysts had said Macy would be forced to put a
value on the securities portion of its offer to compete with
Campeau. Many investors, including arbitragers who hold a sizable
portion of Federated stock, had been leaning toward the certainty
of Campeau's all-cash offer.
   Federated had reached a merger agreement with Macy on March 2
but reopened the bidding after Campeau raised its offer last week.
   Investors pushed up the price of Federated stock Thursday, but
it held below either of the latest offers, rising $2.62{ a share to
$72.87{ on the New York Stock Exchange.
   Before the meeting, Campeau had taken its bid directly to
Federated's stockholders, in a two-step, all-cash tender offer
totaling $6.53 billion.
   Macy was offering $5.4 billion in cash plus stock in the new
company. Analysts valued that offer at $6.3 billion overall.
   The fight for Federated began Jan. 25, when Campeau offered $4.2
billion to buy the retailer, which rejected the offer as inadequate.
   Campeau raised its bid, but Federated spurned the Canadian
company's advances until the end of February, when the retailer
agreed to negotiate with Campeau.
   But as the Federated board was to meet to review that proposal,
the Macy bid surfaced, and on March 2, Federated and Macy announced
they had reached a merger agreement.
   Court battles over Federated's ``poison pill'' takeover defense
ensued, and both suitors continued to raise their offers until the
Federated board called for ``final bids'' to be presented Wednesday.
   If Federated's board endorses the latest Macy bid, the battle
will return to court, where the poison pill would again be an issue.
   The pill would make a takeover attempt more expensive by
allowing the retailer's shareholders to buy more company stock at a
discount, unless Federated's management supported the bid.
   Federated's divisions include Bloomingdale's, Burdine's,
Filene's, Foley's, Lazarus and Rich's department stores.
   Macy owns nearly 100 department and specialty stores.
   Campeau, which started in real estate development in Canada,
moved into the U.S. retail market at the end of 1986 by acquiring
Allied Stores Corp.

   Texas Railroad Commissioner Kent Hance says he
will meet the president of the OPEC cartel in London Monday to
discuss the world energy situation and need for stable petroleum
prices.
   Hance said he also will urge that the Railroad Commission gain
observer status at OPEC meetings and that crude oil prices be
stabilized in the range of $18 to $24 per barrel.
   The president of OPEC, Minister Rilwanu Lukman of Nigeria, will
participate in the meeting to discuss ``the world energy situation
and options for the stabilization of oil prices,'' Hance said.
   He said he has been working through diplomatic channels since
last fall to achieve observer status for the commission at meetings
of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries.
   ``A line of communication with OPEC is of importance to Texas
and the nation,'' Hance said Thursday. ``At the present time, the
OPEC cartel sets the price, and we have no input.''
   The designation means that non-OPEC members can attend meetings
but can't vote. OPEC ministers can exclude observers from their
meetings as they choose.
   Oil cartel founders used the railroad commission as their model
when OPEC was formed in 1960 because ``Texas is one of the largest
non-OPEC producers in the world,'' Hance said.
   Lukman scheduled a meeting of OPEC`s pricing committee for April
9 in Vienna.
   Texas Railroad Commission was established in 1891 to prevent
abuses and discrimination in freight and passenger tariffs on
railroads, but its powers were later broadened to include
regulation of oil and gas production.

   A sharp decline in the size of the American
labor force last month sent the civilian unemployment rate to a
decade-low 5.6 percent, the government said today.
   While the number of people at work in March dropped by 306,000,
those either holding jobs or looking for them fell by 445,000. The
0.1 percentage point drop from February's 5.7 percent jobless rate
reflected a decrease of 137,000 _ to 6.8 million _ in the number of
workers listed as unemployed.
   The 5.6 percent, seasonally-adjusted, rate is the lowest since
May 1979 and has not been lower since 1974, the Labor Department
reported.
   Janet L. Norwood, the commissioner of labor statistics, said a
slowdown in the expansion of the labor force is beginning to be
reflected in unemployment rates, which had, until last month, been
dropping more on the basis of job growth.
   ``The birthrate decline in the 1960s and the early 1970s has
resulted in fewer young people reaching labor force-age in the
1980s,'' she said.
   While the number of Americans at work has grown by 3 million
over the last year, ``the labor force has increased by less than 2
million,'' she told the the congressional Joint Economic Committee.
   Even though the unemployment rate has fallen a full percentage
point from March 1987, the latest government data indicate that the
job boom may be coming to an end.
   The number of so-called ``discouraged workers'' _ people who
have given up the search for a job out of the belief they cannot
find one and are not included in the labor force or jobless rate
calculations _ rose by 115,000 in the first three months of 1988 to
1,027,000 after falling by more than 200,000 last year.
   Two-thirds of the increase in discouraged workers was adult men,
historically the primary family breadwinners.
   Factory employment, which had soared through the last half of
1987, was stagnant for the second month in a row.
   At 19,417,000 people, manufacturers actually had 1,000 fewer
people on their payrolls than in February. Factory employment,
however, is still more than 420,000 above where it was a year ago.
   Job increases in machinery and printing and publishing were
offset by small declines in 11 other manufacturing industries, Ms.
Norwood said.
   Despite what appears to be an end to the manufacturing rebound,
total payroll employment grew by 260,000 last month, according to a
Labor Department employer survey.
   The unemployment rate calculations are based on a sampling of
the nation's households.
   Presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater hailed the report,
saying, ``We are very pleased. Jobs are still the best barometer of
the economy.''
   Health care and business services provided 85,000 of the new
jobs, with construction adding 80,000 more. The growth in
construction jobs plus a jump of 10,000 people on real-estate
agency payrolls affirm earlier indications of a resurging housing
market.
   Things are not so well in banking and on Wall Street, however,
with employment dropping by 5,000 last month. It was the second
straight monthly decline.
   Retail trworkers in January and February.
   The jobless rate for whites fell from 4.8 percent to 4.7 percent
while rising from 12.6 percent to 12.8 percent for blacks. The rate
for Hispanics dropped from 8.3 percent to 8.2 percent.
   Joblessness among men was unchanged at 4.9 percent but dropped
among women from 5.2 percent to 4.8 percent.
   The rate for teenagers rose from 15.4 percent to 16.5 percent.
Black teens saw their rate drop from 38.3 percent to 36.9 percent.
   An alternate unemployment calculation, including the 1.7 million
members of the Armed Services stationed in the United States, also
fell 0.1 percentage point to 5.5 percent.

<HEAD>Soybean Futures Set To Rally, Analysts Say</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Market watchers expect soybean futures to open
with a bang Monday, following a pair of government reports that
indicate supplies could become extremely tight later this year.
   And they says a quick, strong rally is the only thing that could
encourage more soybean planting and perhaps lessen the crunch.
   Corn-and-soybean growers have until April 15 to decide whether
to opt for the security of corn price-support payments _ and the
accompanying requirement that they idle 20 percent of their land _
or take their chances on the open market.
   Higher futures prices for new-crop soybeans would induce more
farmers to choose the latter course and grow soybeans on those
acres that would otherwise lie idle, analysts said.
   Market-watchers were predicting three months ago that prices for
1988 soybeans could climb as high as $7 a bushel, the highest level
in four years.
   Thursday's Agriculture Department reports on spring planting
intentions and U.S. grain stocks reaffirmed that view.
   ``The general mentality of the market has been an expectation of
over $7 beans on November futures, probably $7.20, which would
result in $7 cash in most parts of the country,'' said David
Bartholomew, an assistant vice president of Merrill Lynch Futures
Inc.
   But after Thursday's reports ``$7 almost sounds conservative,''
he said. ``I think they're going to set prices higher after seeing
these figures.''
   Cathy Leow, assistant vice president of Thomson McKinnon
Securities Inc., predicted a sharp rise in soybean futures prices
on Monday and said the November contract could reach $7.30 a bushel
by April 15. November beans settled Thursday at $6.71 a bushel on
the Chicago Board of Trade, which closed out a work week shortened
by the observance of Good Friday.
   ``We may go 30 to 60 cents higher from these levels, with 60
being the upper limit,'' she said.
   But, she added, ``I don't think you need to get quite as high as
$7.30 basis November'' to encourage more soybean planting.
   The planting intentions report, based on surveys conducted in
March, said farmers planned to plant 58 million acres of soybeans,
up 1 percent from last year but still the second lowest acreage
since 1976 and below the average pre-report estimate of about 59
million acres.
   ``The market has been rallying all year in an effort to get
additional supplies for next year and boost farmer plantings,'' Ms.
Leow said. ``This report shows the market hasn't done its job and
prices have to move higher.''
   The soybean stocks report was even more surprising. The USDA
reported soybean stocks at 1.15 billion bushels, down 14 percent
from March 1, 1987. The market had expected the number to be about
30 million bushels higher.
   The relatively low number suggests soybean stocks on Aug. 31,
the end of the current marketing year, will also be lower than had
been expected, Ms. Leow said.
   ``When you combine the less-than-expected acreage with a
smaller-than-expected carryout, you're looking at a very, very
tight supply situation for next year,'' she said.
   ``If weather is even marginally below average, supplies are
going to be extremely tight. I think the market will want to do
something about that.''
   Thursday's reports on corn and cotton planting intentions also
were seen as bullish for futures prices. The wheat numbers were
construed as neutral for futures prices.
   Here are some commodity price trends during the past week:
   Grain and soybean futures turned in a mixed performance on the
Chicago Board of Trade.
   Wheat for delivery in May settled Thursday at $2.99\ a bushel,
down from $3.05 the previous Friday; May corn was unchanged at
$2.09} a bushel; May oats fell to $1.61{ a bushel from $1.68}; and
March soybeans advanced to $6.53{ a bushel from $6.48{.
   Livestock and meat futures were mixed on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange.
   Live cattle for delivery in April settled Thursday at 74.90
cents a pound, down from 74.92 cents; March feeder cattle advanced
to 82.77 cents a pound from 82.72 cents; April hogs fell to 45.52
cents a pound from 46.25 cents; and May pork bellies retreated to
56.12 cents a pound from 57.37 cents.
   Precious metals moved higher on the Commodity Exchange in New
York.
   Gold for delivery in April settled at $454.40 a troy ounce,
compared with $453.30; and May silver advanced to $6.785 a troy
ounce from $6.715.
   Energy futures were higher on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil for delivery in May settled at
$17.08 a barrel, compared with $17.03; April heating oil advanced
to 48.15 cents a gallon from 47.78 cents; and April unleaded
gasoline rose to 48.67 cents a gallon from 47.94 cents.

   Major changes must be made in the compromise
trade bill drafted by Congress or senior White House advisers will
recommend a veto, presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said
today.
   ``We still have grave reservations about several of the
provisions, including plant closings, Toshiba, presidential
authority and some of the mandatory retaliatory provisions,''
Fitzwater told reporters traveling with Reagan to California for a
10-day vacation.
   Among other things, the tentative compromise reached Thursday
night calls for retaliation against foreign trade barriers but
leaves the president some latitude to waive action if he believed
that would be wiser.
   ``The superconference will meet after recess and if substantial
changes aren't made by the superconference, the president's senior
advisers will recommend a veto,'' Fitzwater said, referring to
final negotiations by House and Senate members to get overall
agreement on the legislation.
   Earlier, U.S Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter said the bill
has been cleansed of ``a lot of undesirable things'' but that
``there certainly are some provisions in there of dubious merit.''
   In working through the package, House and Senate negotiators
scrapped Rep. Richard Gephardt's controversial trade retaliation
amendment while opting for repeal of the windfall oil profits tax,
tough sanctions on Japan's Toshiba Corp. and a $1 billion boost in
U.S. grain export subsidies.
   The compromise trade bill completed late Thursday night also
would require employers to give 60 days' notice of plant closings
and would increase government aid to those left jobless as a result
of competition from imports.
   Yeutter, interviewed on NBC-TV's ``Today'' show, said the plant
closing requirement ``is probably a killer provision'' that could
justify a veto if not removed before the trade package receives
final congressional approval.
   ``The Congress jettisoned a lot of undesirable things this last
week,'' Yeutter said. ``The question is whether they jettisoned
enough. And we need a couple of days to assess that.''
   The tentative agreement was produced by 17 separate subgroups of
a House-Senate conference committee.
   At the heart of the measure are direct trade provisions designed
to tightened the machinery under which the United States imposes
import curbs.
   Authority to impose restraints in retaliation for foreign trade
practices that violate international trade rules would be
transferred from the president to the U.S. trade representative.
But the president would still be empowered to waive action under
some circumstances.
   The president also would retain his current authority to decide
what type of restraints to impose to aid U.S. industries threatened
by surges in imports. But the machinery for arriving at a decision
would be streamlined.
   Even as the massive bill moved ahead in Congress, concerns about
a possible presidential veto were growing.
   Sen. John C. Danforth, R-Mo., said the plant-closing provision
and several others ``clearly would sink the legislation unless they
were removed.'' The Senate Finance Committee chairman, Sen. Lloyd
Bentsen, D-Texas, also expressed uncertainty about whether the
president would sign the overall package.
   Rep. Dan Rostenkowski, D-Ill., chairman of the House-Senate
conference committee that produced the package, said there was
bound to be some grumbling, but he was upbeat about the final
product.
   ``We worked long and hard and I think evidence that it's a good
product is that nobody's happy about it,'' he said.
   At the heart of the measure are streamlined procedures for
imposing import restrictions to aid U.S. industries hard hit by
imports and retaliate against barriers that trading partners put in
the way of American exports.
   Erased in last-minute, one-on-one bargaining between
Rostenkowski and Bentsen was the provision that erstwhile
Democratic presidential contender Gephardt had made the centerpiece
of his campaign. It would have required 10 percent annual rollbacks
in ``excess and unwarranted'' surpluses that other countries run in
trade with the United States.
   In its place, Rostenkowski and Bentsen settled on a modified
Senate alternative that calls on the U.S. trade representative to
list foreign trade barriers and, if necessary, use import curbs to
force their removal.
   The bill would transfer from the president to the U.S. trade
representative authority to impose import restrictions in
retaliation for unfair foreign trade practices. But it still would
leave room to waive the curbs if the cost ``would be substantially
out of proportion to the benefits of action.''
   The president would retain the authority to decide what import
relief to grant to U.S. industries hit hard by surges in imports.
   The bill would repeal the windfall profits tax on oil companies,
a measure approved by Congress in 1979 when petroleum prices were
surging.
   The collapse of OPEC sent prices plummeting in 1985, hammering
the Texas economy and rendering the tax useless as a revenue
raiser, at least for the time being. Its repeal is a goal dear to
Bentsen, who is running for re-election this year.
   Also approved was a plan to ban U.S. government purchases of
Toshiba goods for three years. It also would bar import of products
of the company's Toshiba Machine Corp. subsidiary for three years.
In the future, such violations would be punishable by import bans
of two to five years.
   The measure was designed to retaliate for Toshiba Machine's part
in selling sophisticated computerized milling equipment to the
Soviet Union to produce submarine propellers that are harder for
U.S. listening equipment to detect. Export of the equipment to
communist countries is barred under an agreement between Japan and
Western nations.
   Farm-state negotiators, meanwhile, agreed on increasing the
Export Enhancement Program by $1 billion. The program furnishes
grain companies and others with surplus government crops to induce
them to ship American grain overseas.

<HEAD>Dollar Falls in Shortened Domestic Trading</HEAD>
<HEAD>Precede: LONDON</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar fell in domestic trading Friday after
steadying in Europe as traders quit early to get a head start on
the holiday weekend.
   Gold markets were closed.
   Activity was lackluster, with market participants reluctant to
take on positions ahead of the Passover and Easter weekend. Trading
virtually halted in New York at around noon.
   Dealers said the central banks continue to monitor market
activity. Should the banks come into the market in support of the
dollar next week, ``there is the potential for a technical
rebound,'' said Stephen Flanagan, an assistant vice president at
Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co.
   Many market participants are anticipating dollar-selling by the
Japanese as their new fiscal year gets under way.
   Most European and Asian centers were closed for Good Friday. But
the dollar managed to hold fairly steady in what little dealings
took place.
   Markets in Italy, France and Luxembourg, but dealers were idle
most of the day, traders said.
   ``They are all lying low,'' said one trader in Milan. ``There is
absolutely no direction at all.
   Gold markets in New York, London, Zurich and Hong Kong were
closed.
   In Tokyo, where the business day ends as Europe's begins, the
dollar closed at 124.10 yen, down 0.40 yen from Thursday despite
some light intervention by the Bank of Japan, dealers said.
   Later in Europe, the dollar was quoted at 124.20 yen. In New
York the dollar finished at 123.90 yen, down from 124.35 yen on
Thursday.
   The British pound was quoted at $1.8895 _ a six-year high for
the second day in a row _ compared with $1.8878 Thursday. In New
York it cost $1.8905 to buy one pound, more expensive than
Thursday's 1.8874.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late
Thursday, included: 1.6555 West German marks, down from 1.6575;
1.36425 Swiss francs, down from 1.3650; 5.6155 French francs, down
from 5.6170, and 1.23455 Canadian dollars, down from 1.2354.
   Other dollar rates in Europe late afternoon Friday, compared
with late Thursday, were: 1.6565 West German marks, up from 1.6555;
1.3650 Swiss francs, up from 1.3635; 5.6270 French francs, up from
5.6130; 1.8595 Dutch guilders, up from 1.8575; 1,228.75 Italian
lire, down from 1,229.50 and 1.2335 Canadian dollars, down from
1.2339.

<HEAD>Ralston-Purina Puts Adult Incentive in Kids' Cereals</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SKIP WOLLENBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ralston Purina Co. is giving away $29,000 sports
cars in a promotion designed to sell more cereal, but it steered
away from high-fiber ``adult'' products in selecting vehicles for
the giveaway.
   The St. Louis-based food marketer chose six children's cereals
with names like Freakies, Fruit Islands and Ghostbusters for the
promotion.
   Ralston isn't the first to recognize the potential in marketing
children's cereals to adults.
   The leader in the $5 billion ready-to-eat cereal market, Kellogg
Co., has been doing it for years in advertising its Frosted Flakes
and Frosted Mini-Wheats brands, among others. Frosted Flakes
commercials have shown adults ``confessing'' to a powerful
attraction for the taste of the cereal and drawing the window
shades while they indulge.
   General Mills Inc. advertises the ``unsinkability'' and low
sugar content of its Cheerios brand in advertising aimed at adults
and spins stories about the latest adventures of the Cheerios kid
in commercials aimed at children.
   Quaker Oats Co. found a few years ago that its Cap'n Crunch
cereal was so popular at campus cafeterias that it devised a
special version of a ``Find the Captain'' promotion for college
students.
   Ronald Strauss, who follows the cereal business for the
investment firm William Blair & Co. in Chicago, said cereal makers
have increasingly tried to market their products as something for
all the family.
   ``The demographics are changing. The average age of the
population is getting older and there are simply not as many
teenyboppers out there anymore,'' he said.
   Celeste Clark, a spokeswoman for Kellogg, which is based in
Battle Creek, Mich., said advertising pre-sweetened cereals to
adults reminds them of the good tastes they enjoyed while they were
growing up.
   Frosted Flakes, for example, has been available for more than 35
years and was initially marketed to children, she said.
   But many of those who ate it years ago may now have children of
their own and may be receptive to trying it again, she said.
   Kellogg began advertising Frosted Flakes to adults five years
ago with the light-hearted approach that aims at reassuring them it
is appropriate for adults to eat it, and Ms. Clark said the cereal
now leads the category.
   Strauss said his figures confirm that, with Frosted Flakes
capturing about 6 percent of the retail value of the ready-to-eat
cereal market in 1986.
   Ms. Clark said Kellogg has also fouind that while health
concerns are driving some adults toward cereals with fruits, nuts
and grains, a key factor in determining what cereal people buy is
still its taste.
   Kathryn Newton, a spokeswoman for General Mills in Minneapolis,
said advertising children's cereal to adults makes sense because
adults make the purchases for all of them.
   That was the principle motivation behind the Ralston sports car
promotion, said spokeswoman Sandra Harrington.
   Ralston Purina began offering tiny sports car models in about 11
million boxes of six of its children's cereals in February. Ten
boxes of cereal contain a scale-model red Corvette, and those who
find the models can turn them in for the real thing, a 1988
Chevrolet Corvette valued at about $29,000.
   The promotion has been advertised nationally in newspapers and
network television commercials, the company said. Sales results are
not yet available.
   ``We were looking for something that would appeal to parents as
well as kids,'' Ms. Harrington said.
   She said the company doesn't know if the promotion will prompt
adults to try the cereals, but hopes that it will at least get them
to buy it for their children. ``Maybe this will be the difference
between having them pick up pour cereal or buying something else,''
she said.

<TEXT>
   The Chicago, Missouri & Western Railway Co. filed
for federal bankruptcy-court protection Friday, citing a burdensome
debt despite recent improvement in operations.
   There will be no disruption of service while the railroad awaits
court appointment of a trustee to oversee operations and determine
the company's best course, said Dave Barr, acting chief executive
officer of Venango River Corp., the CM&W's Chicago-based holding
company.
   The CM&W listed debts of $131.8 million and assets of $103.5
million in its filing for Chapter 11 protection from creditors.
   ``It's our intention to continue to operate in the normal course
of business while we seek to reorganize and emerge a viable
operation,'' Barr said.
   He said operating expenses and revenues were close to the
``break-even level in the last few months.''
   But servicing the debt incurred by the railroad was an
increasing financial burden, Barr said.
   CM&W operates freight service on the 632-mile line between
Kansas City, Mo., and Joliet, with trackage rights extending the
final 40 miles into Chicago. It also operates the Amtrak passenger
line between Joliet and St. Louis.
   A second Venango railroad, the Chicago South Shore and South
Bend railway, is not affected by the filing, Barr said.
   In February, CM&W and Venango filed a federal lawsuit accusing
the Illinois Central Gulf Railroad, the CM&W line's previous owner,
and its parent company, IC Industries. The lawsuit contends traffic
on the railroad failed to reach levels anticipated when the line
was purchased in April 1987.

<HEAD>`Takeover Fever' Gives Bondholders A Huge Headache</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By VIVIAN MARINO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Almost every day for the past two months,
stockholders of Federated Department Stores Inc. _ the target in a
bitter takeover war _ got a special treat just by scanning the
newspaper headlines:
   ``Federated Looks To Macy To Counter Campeau Offer''
   ``Macy Said To Raise Final Bid''
   ``Both Sides Raise Bids For Federated'' And so on.
   Each time rivals R.H. Macy & Co. and Campeau Corp. upped the
ante for the giant retailer, which owns popular department stores
like Bloomingdale's and Filene's, Federated's stock soared.
   But while stockholders were singing ``we're in the money'' as
they watched share prices jump by 50 percent since bidding began
late January, owners of Federated's bonds were just plain singing
the blues. The prospect of saddling Federated with new debt once a
deal was forged has depressed bond prices by about 20 percent and
brought trading to a virtual standstill.
   Interest also has waned in debt issued by companies like
American Standard Inc., another takeover target, and Stop & Shop
Cos., which recently agreed to a friendly leveraged buyout to avoid
a hostile acquistion, although their stock doubled in price.
   In fact, the recent resurgence in takeovers has hurt the entire
industrial bond market, regardless of whether the securities are
vulnerable to what Wall Street dubbs ``event-risks,'' such as
recapitalizations and leveraged buyouts. In an LBO, a company is
acquired largely through borrowed money repaid through the target
company's profits or asset sales.
   ``It's been a disaster for bondholders,'' said James L. Kochan,
chief fixed-income strategist at Merrill Lynch Capital Markets.
``There is a considerable number of investors who have chosen to
avoid the entire (industrial) industry.
   ``We feel much more comfortable in recommending utility bond
issues and bonds of telephones or banks.''
   Investment advisors suggest that industrial bondholders sell
securities considered vulnerable and retain the rest. Bonds that
already have been depressed, such as those issued by Federated,
eventually could bounce back and shouldn't be sold for now, they
say.
   ``If they (the winning bidder) run it like a first-class
operation, then there's no reason why these things can't pop back
to where they were,'' said Anthony Naylor, senior vice president of
fixed-income securities for Rodman & Renshaw Inc.
   Analysts attribute the increased takeover activity partly to the
fact that October's stock market crash made share prices attractive
and to an improving economy.
   Naylor said his firm recently has been paying more attention to
trying to predict which companies could become takeover targets.
One possible giveaway is a high cash flow, which ironically is what
attracts bondholders to a company to begin with, he said.
   Having lots of cash on hand means companies will be able to pay
off the interest and principal on their outstanding debt, but their
creditworthiness diminishes when that's diluted.
   ``As you leverage out the balance sheet and have more debt
burden ... cash flow is diverted to servicing that debt, and it
makes a very tight situation in some cases,'' said Kenneth Pfeil, a
senior vice president at Standard & Poor's Corp., a major
debt-rating service. ``Sometimes cash flow is not enough, and the
company has to sell off assets.''
   Consequently, takeover targets and suitors often are placed on
credit watch for possible downgrading as soon as bidding begins.
The lower the debt rating, the more expensive it is for a company
to borrow money.
   Among those currently on S&P's credit watch are American
Standard and its former hostile bidder, Black & Decker Corp.; and
Stop & Shop and its former unwanted suitor, Dart Group Corp.
   Moody's Investors Service, another debt rater, said that 32
percent of its downgradings in the industrial bond sector during
the first quarter were due to so-called event risks. It suggests
more might be forthcoming.
   Part of a bondholder's risk lies in being a passive investor.
While suitors have to win stockholder approval before acquiring a
company, bondholders have little say in the matter.
   Analysts say new protections should be adopted to give
bondholders more security. Kerr-McGee Corp. and a handful of other
issuers already have introduced ``poison puts,'' which force
companies to buy back their debt securities at par in case of a
hostile takeover.
   ``It's an attractive thing for the bondholder. I think it could
be a new enticement to minimize the risk,'' said Eric Friedlander,
a corporate bond trader for Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.

<HEAD>Supreme Court Justice Steps Out of Kodak-Fuqua Deal Dispute</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD CARELLI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Supreme Court justice Friday stepped out of
a legal dispute over the merger of the photofinishing operations of
Eastman Kodak Co. and Fuqua Industries Inc. _ one he had entered a
day before.
   Justice Byron R. White set aside an emergency order he had
issued Thursday on the request of Phototron Corp., ruling that the
request apparently was made too late.
   White on Thursday had set aside a federal appeals court decision
that cleared the way for the merger despite a pending antitrust
challenge by Phototron.
   But in Friday's superseding, one-paragraph order, White said,
``It appearing that the transaction ... was actually closed before
(my) temporary stay was issued, the temporary stay is vacated.''
   White's order noted that he was ``not advised of the closing''
when he issued Thursday's order.
   The deal between Kodak and Fuqua created the nation's largest
wholesale photofinishing operation.
   Kodak and the Atlanta-based Fuqua wasted no time in completing
the deal Tuesday after the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals on
Monday reversed a federal trial judge's injunction against the
merger. The injunction had been issued Feb. 22.
   The appeals court ruled that Phototron had no right to try to
block the merger, although it said the San Bernadino, Calif.,
corporation may continue pursuing its related antitrust lawsuit
against Kodak.
   The new merged operation, Qualex Inc., combines Colorcraft
Corp., a Fuqua subsidiary, with Kodak-owned laboratories. It has 94
processing labs around the country.
   The new company is to be based in Durham, N.C., the home of
Colorcraft, and Colorcraft's former chairman, D. Carl Hamill, will
serve as chief executive officer.
   Phototron's suit, pending in federal court in Fort Worth, Texas,
contends that the merger violates federal antitrust law by forcing
non-Kodak processing labs out of business.
   Phototron is seeking $250 million in damages.
   After White's action Thursday purportedly postponing the merger,
lawyers for Kodak and Fuqua informed him that the merger occurred
Tuesday.
   Any court action now, White was told, ``would amount to nothing
more than a mere declaration in the air.''
   The Kodak and Fuqua lawyers said that they informed Phototron on
Wednesday of the merger, before Phototron sought emergency help
from White.

<HEAD>Economic Growth Continued In March, Purchasing Managers Say</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The economy continued to grow in March on the
strength of exporters, although at a slower pace than the previous
month, the nation's purchasing managers said in a survey released
Sunday.
   The National Association of Purchasing Management said that its
economic growth index fell to 53.3 percent last month from 54.9
percent in February, the lowest since a reading of 54.7 percent in
April 1987.
   A reading above 50 percent indicates the economy generally is
expanding; a reading below that indicates it generally is
declining. March was the 20th consecutive month above the
break-even mark.
   ``The economy completed the first quarter with moderate, if not
substantial, growth,'' Robert J. Bretz, chairman of the group's
business survey committee, said in a statement.
   ``The healthy increase in new orders, particularly export
orders, along with the anticipated slowing of price increases,
signals continued improvement in the economy in the second
quarter.''
   March represented the 15th consecutive month of growth in new
orders, according to the survey. Thirty-two percent of the
purchasing mangers polled reported higher levels of new orders,
compared with 31 percent in February and 35 percent in January.
   Of those whose companies export, 41 percent said their export
orders were higher in March, while 3 percent said they were lower.
That was up from 33 percent in February and 39 percent in January.
   The monthly report is based on a survey of more than 250
industrial purchasing managers who belong to the national
organization.
   Among other findings of the survey:
   _Production growth slowed from February, although it was at a
level still considered very healthy. Members who reported stronger
production outweighed those reporting weaker, 32 percent to 8
percent.
   _Deliveries from vendors slowed for the 18th consecutive month,
a reflection of the slowdown in deliveries. Twenty-three percent
said they had slower deliveries, compared with 5 percent reporting
faster.
   _Inventories declined sharply after growing modestly in the past
two months. Twenty-three percent said they had lower inventories,
vs. 10 percent who had higher.
   _Fifty-five percent reported higher prices, compared with 64
percent in February, indicating a decline in inflation. Three
percent reported lower prices, up from 1 percent in February.
   _Employment grew for an eighth straight month, although the
results could be viewed as a slight decline considering normal
seasonal increases expected in March.
   _Prices rose for a wide variety of raw materials and fell for
only a few, including fuel oil, natural gas, diesel fuel and
chlorine.
   _Products in short supply included aluminum, steel and other
metals and a variety of chemicals.

<TEXT>
   The hunt for the blue crab, the
Chesapeake Bay's most valuable and abundant seafood, opened Friday
with predictions by watermen and scientists for a strong harvest
this year.
   Last year's catch was average, said William Sieling, chief of
seafood marketing for the Maryland Department of Agriculture. The
1985 and 1986 seasons were better.
   But this year, people on Smith Island, where the crabs show up
first, say the crop of small crabs on the bottom was good last
fall, said L. Eugene Cronin, blue crab researcher and consultant
for the state Department of Natural Resources.
   Those crabs mature through the winter and migrate up the bay.
``That's the most promising sign I've heard,'' Cronin said Friday.
   However, predicting the size of the catch is harder than
predicting where the crabs are during any given week, he said.
   This early in the season, crabs run in the lower bay. By May or
June they should be running farther north in the Annapolis area.
   Maryland watermen, anxious to make up for the poor oyster
season, are setting crab pots in the lower Chesapeake and at
Seaside, near Ocean City.
   Crabs are also more expensive this time of year. Packers are
paying watermen $60 to $65 a bushel and selling crabs by the dozen.
   Bert Kappel of Annapolis Seafood Market said he has been selling
North Carolina crabs all winter for $15 a dozen. By summer, crab
feasts likely will be more affordable at $30 to $40 a bushel.
   The demand for crabs traditionally runs from Memorial Day
weekend to Labor Day weekend.
   The crab harvest season usually creates jobs for about 19,000
people and generates $80 million to $90 million for the area
economy, Cronin said.
   State officials laid the groundwork to keep the blue crab from
going the way of the oyster at a crab workshop last fall, Cronin
said.
   Workshop participants compiled a report listing problems that
needed to be addressed to protect the blue crab, which seems less
vulnerable to pollution because it spawns at the mouth of the bay,
he said.
   The report recommended ways to:
   _Minimize crab waste.
   _Distribute the catch between commercial and recreational
interests and between Maryland and Virginia.
   _Better measure the crab population.
   The report is part of a state plan to develop a baywide crab
management plan to be completed by July 1989 as part of the
Chesapeake Bay Agreement between the states.

<HEAD>Northwest Airlines Hires Former Braniff Head</HEAD>
<DATELINE>EAGAN, Minn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   William D. Slattery, former head of Braniff
and a 16-year employee with TWA, has been hired by Northwest
Airlines to head flight, maintenance, cargo and ground handling
operations.
   Slattery, whose hiring was announced Thursday, is perhaps best
known for getting Braniff Inc. off the ground again in March 1984
after its bankruptcy court reorganization in 1982. He was president
of Braniff for less than a year when he resigned amid speculation
that Braniff Chairman Jay Pritzker was undermining his authority.
   At Northwest, Slattery will face an immediate challenge to
reconcile policies and practices of former Northwest and Republic
Airlines flight and maintenance operations.
   Northwest merged with Republic in August 1986 and the combined
airline has continued to operate internally as two airlines,
although marketing, financial and accounting functions have been
merged.
   Slattery's appointment is the latest in a series of changes
designed to bring the airline's operating functions under a single
responsibility, said Steven Rothmeier, Northwest chairman and chief
executive officer.
   Slattery also will be faced with helping to reach contracts with
pilots and the International Association of Machinists, the union
that represents 20,000 mechanics, baggage handlers, reservations
agents and transportation agents.
   The 45-year-old Slattery, whose title will be vice president of
operations, replaces Benjamin Griggs Jr., who was promoted earlier
this week to executive vice president of NWA Inc., the parent
company of Northwest. Slattery will handle the duties of Tom Koors,
the executive vice president of customer services who resigned last
week, the company said.

   The Veterans Administration said Friday it was
raising its maximum interest rate for federally backed VA home
mortgages by one-half percentage point to 10 percent.
   The VA said it was making the change, which will take effect
Sunday, to reflect recent increases in interest rates in financial
markets.
   In the past 12 months, the VA rate has been changed seven times,
fluctuating between 9.5 percent and 11 percent. The last change was
Feb. 1, when the rate was lowered a full percentage point from 10.5
percent to 9.5 percent.
   The Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. said Friday that the
national average for 30-year conventional mortgages, those without
government guarantees, rose above 10 percent for the first time
since late January. The national average rate was 10.05 percent, up
from 9.99 percent the previous week.
   The VA said that effective Sunday a variety of other mortgage
rates will also rise by one-half percentage point. Graduated
payment mortgages will increase to 10.25 percent, home improvement
loans will rise to 11.5 percent and loans for mobile homes will
increase to 12.5 percent.
   The VA rates apply to new loans, not existing ones. VA mortgages
peaked at 17.5 percent in September 1981 before beginning a decline
whih reached a low for this decade of 8.5 percent in early 1987.

<HEAD>Raw Log Export Bill Picks Up Support</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LES BLUMENTHAL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A bill to let states regulate exports of raw
logs cut on state lands gained key support Friday from several
Northwest lawmakers, including the chairman of the House panel with
jurisdiction over the measure.
   ``Log exports are creating a crisis for Northwest mills,'' said
Rep. Peter DeFazio, D-Ore., who introduced the measure almost a
year ago.
   DeFazio said the new support, especially that of Washington
Democratic Rep. Don Bonker, ``shows a growing determination in the
Northwest to get serious about log exports.''
   The measure is pending before the House Foreign Affairs
Committee's subcommittee on international economic policy and
trade, which Bonker chairs.
   ``Log exports benefit certain parts of the industry, but
processing those logs at home would provide thousands of jobs and a
stronger domestic economy,'' Bonker said in endorsing the bill. ``I
think we're foolish if we don't maximize the economic benefits
which come from our natural resources.''
   Other new co-sponsors of the bill include Democrats Al Swift of
Washington and Les AuCoin of Oregon and Republican Rod Chandler of
Washington.
   DeFazio said he was ``confident'' action would be taken on his
measure as soon as Congress deal with the omnibus trade bill.
Congress is expected to vote on the trade bill shortly after it
returns from its Easter break.
   Oregon, Alaska and Califfrnia had restricted exports of
unprocessed logs harvested on state lands until a 1984 U.S. Supreme
Court decision struck down the Alaska ban.
   The court ruled that Congress had not specifically delegated
such authority to the states.
   DeFazio's bill would grant the states such authority, strictly
limiting it to logs harvested from state owned or administered land.
   About 80 percent of the logs cut on Washington state lands and
about half of those harvested on Oregon lands in 1987 were shipped
without being processed.
   Raw log exports from the Northwest totaled roughly 3 billion
board feet in 1987.
   DeFazio said that the U.S. Forest Service estimated that 27,000
jobs are created from every 1 billion board feet of timber milled.
   ``Last year, that translated into 81,000 jobs _ unfortunately,
those jobs are all oversees,'' said DeFazio.
   In addition, some Northwest mill owners earlier this year blamed
a layoffs at their facilities on a shortage of logs resulting from
exports to Japan, South Korea and other Asian countries.
   Northwest timber industry groups are generally split over the
measure depending on whether their members are log exporters or
they have milling and processing operations.
   Among those who support the measure are the Western Forest
Industries Association of Portland, the Northwest Timber
Association of Eugene and Northwest Independent Forest
Manufacturers headquartered in Tacoma.
   Opponents include the Pacific Rim Traders Association, whose
members include Weyerhaeuser, Georgia Pacific Corp., International
Paper and publicly-owned ports in Portland, Astoria, Newport and
Coos Bay.
   The measure has also drawn support from several Northwest and
national environmental groups, including the National Audubon
Society and the Washington Environmental Council.

<HEAD>Low Price Keeps Shrimpers at Dock</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHARLESTON, Ore. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   West Coast shrimpers staged an informal
strike on the first day of their season Friday to protest low
prices resulting from abundant supplies of last year's catch.
   ``The boats are not out right now and this is opening day, so it
appears we have a strike situation until they get the price worked
out,'' said Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife shrimp biologist
Neil Richmond. ``It's real interesting, because there is not an
organized association, but you're not real popular if you got out
now. You'd be a strike breaker.''
   Richmond said shrimp fishermen were staying in port up and down
the West Coast while they haggle with packers over a price.
   Shrimpers were asking for at least 50 cents a pound, while
processors were offering only 40 cents, said Scott Adams, plant
manager at Hallmark Fisheries, the largest processor on the Oregon
Coast.
   Last year's price averaged 68 cents a pound, with a high of 80
cents in May brought on by strong demand.
   Adams said a huge inventory of last year's catch was driving
down wholesale prices from $4.75 a pound last summer to a current
level of $3.60 a pound.
   ``Just about every processor on the coast has shrimp left from
last year,'' he said.
   Between 1 million and 2 million pounds remained in cold storage
from last year's Oregon catch of 45 million pounds, the third
highest on record, according to the Oregon Department of Fish and
Wildlife.
   Processors may begin selling their stocks at $2.99 a pound to
clear current inventories and any dockside price higher than 40
cents a pound would make inventory reductions difficult, Adams said.
   ``You can't afford to buy a product if you can't make any
money,'' Adams said. ``I understand the fishermen and I'd like to
see them get what they got last year, but we can't afford it.''
   Adams said processors probably would sit back and wait to see
what happens with the market value and shrimping conditions.
   In Astoria, Point Adams Packing Co. General Manager Tom Libby
said the current price of 40 cents a pound wasn't enough to entice
fishermen to sea.
   ``I don't know of anyone who is holding out at that price
locally,'' he said.
   In Newport, state biologist Marc Saelens said it wasn't unusual
for the shrimp fleet to stay in port the first few days of the
season as the price was negotiated. The season runs through October.
   Richmond said shrimp should be at least as abundant as last
year, resulting in an increased effort by shrimpers, once the price
is worked out.

   The Food and Drug Administration warned
consumers Friday not to use Nutrien and Vitalite powdered drink
mixes because they may be contaminated with Salmonella bacteria.
   Both products are nutritional supplements marketed as powdered
drink mixes by Sunrider International of Torrance, Calif.
   The FDA reported there have been at least seven cases of illness
associated with the products.
   It said Sunrider has agreed to begin a nationwide recall, but
has not supplied the agency with specific distribution information.
   The warning applies to all sizes and flavors of Vitalite diet
drink mixes and all flavors of Nutrien drink mixes.
   The FDA said Sunrider markets its products nationally through
more than 37,000 independent distributors _ generally individuals
who sell them door-to-door or among friends.
   The full product name for Nutrien is ``Nutrien Whole Food
Concentrate.'' It is sold in flavors such as Pina Colada, Mandarin
Orange, Ambrosial Almond, Brisky Lemon and Positively Plain, the
FDA said. The Vitalite Weight Management product is marketed as a
meal substituting for a conventional breakfast, lunch or dinner.
   Salmonella bacteria ca cause nausea, fever, headache, diarrhea
and vomiting in healthy adults. It can be fatal to infants and to
elderly or debilitated individuals, the FDA said.
   The agency said tests detected Salmonella in a soybean powder
extract used in the Sunrider products and in some samples of
finished products.

<HEAD>McDonald's, General Motors and Sears Launch Huge Giveaway
Promotion</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   McDonald's Corp., General Motors Corp. and Sears,
Roebuck & Co., the largest U.S. companies in their respective
fields, linked hands Friday not in monopoly, but in Monopoly.
   In what has been called one of the biggest giveaway promotions
ever, the three corporate giants are offering Oldsmobiles,
children's clothing, cash and food to winners in a game based on
Monopoly.
   Business analysts said the campaign, based on McDonald's
successful 1986 Monopoly promotion, will allow GM to pitch the 1988
Oldsmobile Cutlass Supreme to young adult customers of McDonald's.
It also will help Sears promote a line of children's clothing
developed last year in conjunction with McDonald's.
   Company officials declined to say how much the promotion would
be worth, but a report in an automotive trade magazine several
months ago said it would be a joint venture of at least $100
million. The copyright story in the Jan. 25 issue of Automative
News described the McDonald's-GM link, but did not mention Sears.
   ``I can confirm that we're part of it,'' a spokesman for
Chicago-based Sears said when advance word of the promotion leaked
out.
   McDonald's is based in Oak Brook, a Chicago suburb.
   McDonald's customers who play the game will be given paper
facsimiles of the Monopoly game board, and can collect cards
representing various Monopoly properties at any McDonald's
restaurant.
   Automotive News reported that Detroit-based GM would contribute
500 Oldmobile Cutlass Supremes as prizes in the game, as well as
cash prizes.
   The New York Times reported that Sears was expected to
contribute prizes from its Sears McKids children clothing, a line
decorated with pictures of McDonald's cartoon characters.
   The joint effort ``is not suprising in the sense that we think
of those three as large mass-marketing organizations,'' said Sidney
J. Levy, chairman of the marketing department at Northwestern
University's J.L. Kellogg School of Management.
   ``They are all-American names sharing an interest in a very
large public,'' Levy said. ``McDonald's, nevertheless, seems to
represent a little more working-class, a little more teen-age, a
little more casual idea than I would associate with Oldsmobile or
even Sears, because I had the impression that Sears was trying to
upgrade.''
   The game began Friday at McDonald's restaurants nationwide.

<TEXT>
   A year old on Saturday, IBM's new line of
personal computers will soon have some unwelcome company. Big
Blue's rivals are about to send in the clones.
   The imminent arrival of compatible computers has given the
world's largest computer company the difficult choice of whether to
fight them all the way or give them room to grow.
   The question penetrates to the heart of International Business
Machines Corp., and many observers believe it has sparked a debate
within the company.
   Being the only company making a Personal System-2 for the past
year has allowed IBM to run up healthy profit margins, recoup some
of its investment and reassert control over corporate accounts.
   But some customers have been reluctant to buy a Personal
System-2 until they know whether it will catch on as a standard.
And it may not catch on as a standard if IBM is the only company
making it.
   Some big corporate customers, wanting a second source for the
PS-2, have been urging IBM to license other companies to make
compatible machines.
   There seems to be confusion even with IBM on its willingness to
issue patent licenses to potential PS-2 clone makers.
   One spokesman said Friday, ``I don't see why we would ever want
to do that. ... That would be just the same as giving them the
store.'' Later, another said that in fact, IBM makes licenses
available to anyone under reasonable terms and conditions. But
clone makers still have to avoid infringing on IBM's copyrights on
the PS-2.
   Clone makers forced down prices and stole market share when they
knocked off IBM's first line of personal computers. But they also
helped IBM by expanding the overall market, of which IBM got a
healthy chunk.
   In any case, the moment of truth is approaching quickly.
   Tandy Corp. has called an April 21 meeting for ``the unveiling
of a revolutionary invention of major significance.'' A
well-traveled rumor is that it will be a PS-2 clone.
   Chips and Technologies Inc. and Adaptec Inc. have created sets
of chips that will allow clone makers to build PS-2 look-alikes.
They demonstrated a working model this past week.
   Even Compaq Computer Corp. of Houston, which makes premium PCs
based on the old standard, admitted last year it is hedging its
bets by working in the back shop on a PS-2 compatible.
   Alone in the market, IBM shipped 1.5 million of its new computer
line through the end of January.
   The sales boosted IBM's share of the worldwide personal computer
market to 13 percent last year in terms of units sold, up from 12.2
percent in 1986 and not far from the peak of 13.9 percent in 1985,
estimates Dataquest Inc. of San Jose, Calif.
   The PS-2 has gotten some negative press lately, including an
article in the Wall Street Journal that compared its mysterious
Micro Channel Architecture to the overblown secret ingredient in a
can of cleanser.
   Most computer analysts say the Micro Channel Architecture is
more than an audacious marketing gambit. It only seems that way now
because software developers have not had time to develop any
important programs that take advantage of its power, said Dataquest
analyst Peter Teige.
   ``By 1990 or 1991, I personally believe the old PC bus (data
pathway) will be considered very archaic,'' said John Xenakis, a
consultant and writer based in Framingham, Mass.
   The emergence of PS-2 clones does not entirely depend on IBM.
Theoretically, computers developed independently could be
compatible with the PS-2 without infringing on any IBM copyrights
or patents, the company says.
   But without IBM's blessing, many customers would be reluctant to
buy clones for fear that they would not be fully compatible or
would be at risk of a legal challenge.
   In short, IBM can squelch the clones if it chooses to do so.
Even if the compatibles turn out to be perfectly legal, the costs
of a protracted lawsuit by IBM could wipe out some small companies.
   IBM could simultaneously stimulate and control the PS-2 market
by selectively selling sets of chips or issuing licenses to clone
makers, said John McCarthy, a director at Forrester Research Inc.
in Cambridge, Mass. But he doubts IBM will do so.
   ``It's kind of a circling-the-wagons mentality,'' McCarthy said.
   Other observers are more willing to believe that IBM will take
it easy on the cloners. Chips and Technologies, in San Jose,
Calif., says its own discussions with IBM about licensing have been
``positive and non-adversarial.''
   Dataquest's Teige said IBM could recoup its investment in the
PS-2 through royalties and license fees from clones, while
continuing to introduce new models that would keep it a step ahead
of the compatibles.
   ``I don't think they want to monopolize the market,'' Teige said.
   Customers' desire for PS-2 clones is partly psychological, said
John Xenakis, a consultant and writer in Framingham, Mass.
   ``What would kind of give me personally a green light to buy the
IBM is if everybody's cloning it and it'll become an industry
standard and I won't become stuck with a lemon,'' he said. ``I do
believe that IBM understands that strategy.''
   IBM will issue licenses selectively, predicted Bill Langenes, an
analyst with Creative Strategies International in Santa Clara,
Calif.
   Ironically, IBM's original personal computer in 1981 helped
legitimize computing on the desktop, a revolution in the office
that is eating into IBM's traditional mainframe and minicomputer
business.
   IBM contends there is still plenty for big machines to do, but
clearly they are a shrinking portion of the total market.
   ``The PC may ultimately be IBM's undoing. They've created the
monster that's going to eat the parent,'' McCarthy said.

<HEAD>Corning Drops Bid For ICL</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Corning Glass Works, which had previously
reached an agreement to buy a Tennessee clinical testing firm,
bowed out of a bidding war Friday with SmithKline Beckman for the
company.
   The pharmaceutical giant SmithKline's latest offer for
International Clinical Laboratories Inc. was $37 per share, or
nearly $400 million, for all the outstanding shares. Corning's last
offer had been $35 a share.
   Corning said it had purchased 3 million shares of the
approximately 10 million outstanding shares of ICL stock at their
original offer of $26 per share. Corning has agreed to sell those
shares to SmithKline at $37 per share.
   ``ICL is a fine company, but our management and board made a
firm and final decision about ICL's potential value to Corning,''
James R. Houghton, Corning's chairman and chief executive officer,
said in a prepared statement.
   SmithKline's $37 per share offer expires at midnight EDT on
April 20.
   ``Our offer to acquire ICL is in concert with our corporate
strategy of leadership in health care and life sciences. Clinical
laboratory services is one of our key businesses, growing fast in
both sales and earnings,'' Henry Wendt, SmithKline chairman and
chief executive officer, said in a press release.
   ICL, based in Nashville, runs 13 major clinical testing
laboratories mainly in the South and West. ICL had sales of $205.5
million for the fiscal year ending Aug. 31, 1987, compared with
$168.7 million a year earlier.
   Through a subsidiary, King of Prussia-based SmithKline
BioScience Laboratories Inc., SmithKline is the country's largest
provider of clinical testing services.
   On March 8, ICL agreed to be acquired by Corning for about $260
million or $26 a share. Before the deal could be consumated,
however, SmithKline offered $32 a share.
   Corning challenged the offer with a $35 per share bid on Monday
and SmithKline countered hours later with the $37 offer.
   The agreement announced Friday between SmithKline and Corning
also resolves possible claims between the two parties, Corning said.

<HEAD>Construction Spending, Unemployment Rate Down</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: For Saturday PMs</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   In a pair of new economic reports, the government says the
nation's unemployment rate fell in March and construction spending
slipped in February.
   The financial markets' reaction to the reports won't be apparent
for a few days, however, because the U.S. stock and bond markets
were closed Friday to mark the start of the Easter and Passover
holidays.
   Some light trading was reported in the foreign exchange markets,
where the dollar fell in the United States after steadying in
Europe.
   The unemployment rate fell to 5.6 percent from 5.7 percent in
February even though there were 360,000 fewer Americans at work
than a month earlier, the Labor Department said.
   The unemployment rate is at the lowest level since it was 5.6
percent in May 1979.
   The rate decline was credited entirely to a 455,000 decrease in
those in the labor force _ which includes those either holding jobs
or seeking work.
   Employer payrolls rose by 262,000 new jobs in March, according
to a separate government survey.
   Factory jobs, which have risen an average 40,000 each month
since last summer, fell by 1,000 in March. Of the new payroll jobs,
85,000 were in business and health care services with another
80,000 in construction.
   The 0.3 percent decline in construction spending in February
reflected weakness in the housing sector.
   The Commerce Department said that construction spending declined
to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $391.5 billion in February
following a 2.8 percent drop in January.
   In addition, the department revised the December figure to show
a small decline of $100 million instead of a 0.4 percent increase.
   The February decline pushed construction spending 2.5 percent
below where it was a year earlier. Analysts are forecasting further
cutbacks in 1988 because of high vacancy rates in apartments and
office buildings.
   Residential construction fell by 1.1 percent in February to an
annual rate of $188.1 billion, while non-residential construction
posted a 1.2 percent increase to an annual rate of $92 billion.
   Public construction edged up 0.4 percent in February to an
annual rate of $74.7 billion.

<HEAD>Italian Government Says It Will Consider Joining Project</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Italian government has agreed to explore
possible collaboration in building the ``super collider'' atom
smasher planned by the Energy Department, Energy Secretary John
Herrington said Thursday.
   The agreement does not represent a commitment to contribute to
the cost of the $4.4 billion installation, but department officials
said collaborative projects could lead to concrete cost savings
even if no cash were given.
   The United States and Italy already collaborate in some energy
research. A joint statement issued Thursday by Herrington and
Gianni Ravaglia, deputy minister of industry, commerce and
handicrafts, at the conclusion of the annual review of the work
said the two men had ``endorsed the need to explore ways of
achieving joint undertakings'' to support the super collider.
   The administration is asking Congress for $363 million to begin
construction in the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1., but there is
considerable resistance to the high overall cost. Some members have
asked Herrington to produce evidence that other countries will
contribute, or committments by them, to back up his assertions that
a quarter to a half the project cost could come from other
countries.
   A site for the machine, a 53-miles (85 km) around underground
tunnel, is expected to be chosen in November. Sites in North
Carolina, Texas, Arizona, Michigan, Illinois, Colorado and
Tennessee are being considered.
   George J. Bradley, principal deputy assistant secretary for
international affairs and energy emergencies, told reporters that
smaller sums being mentioned in Congress would not convince
potential foreign contributors that the United States was committed
to the collider.
   Asked specifically about discussions about allocating $200
million for the project, he said, ``It's not enough.''
   If other countries are convinced the United States is going
ahead, they will undertake ``complementary program'' that might
include other types of less expensive high-energy accelerators. But
without a U.S. super collider, they might decide that they need to
collaborate on building one themselves _ and they need to make such
decisions in the coming year or so, Bradley said.
   Thus, he said, $200 million is not enough because ``the key here
is schedule slippage'' _ such a sum would delay the U.S. project
somewhat, and foreign countries would be forced to make decisions
without knowledge of U.S. intentions.
   He declined to specify a particular sum other than the $363
million as ``enough.''
   To explore the secrets of matter and energy, the super collider
would whirl beams of protons into each other at collision energies
20 times higher than the most powerful machines today.
   Italy's help might be particularly welcome, Bradley said,
because that country is the only one so far to build
superconducting magnets with a field strength anywhere near the
strength the super collider beam-bending magnets would use, about
6.6 Tesla or roughly 66,000 times the strength of the earth's
magnetic field. The Italian magnets are used at an accelerator near
Hamburg, West Germany.
   The most powerful U.S. magnets are about 4.4 Tesla. Scientists
have said they see no reason they can't build more powerful ones,
but the $363 million budget request includes about $32 million for
magnet research.
   ``If the Italians are willing to transfer that technology, you
don't have to spend'' that money, Bradley said.
   Italy's manufacturing capacity is only 500 magnets every three
years, while the super collider will require 10,000 magents
estimated to cost $100,000 each _ a $1 billion expenditure.
   If a magnet agreement were reached with Italy, U.S. firms, and
Italian firm or a joint venture might build a manufacturing plant
in the United States, Bradley said. Similar collaborations are
being discussed with several countries, he said.
   ``I can assure you it's not pie in the sky,'' Bradley said.
   Italy has a long tradition in advanced physics research, going
back to nuclear pioneer Enrico Fermi in the 1930s and extending
today to Carlo Rubbia, professor of physics at Harvard University
in Cambridge, Mass. and director-general of CERN (Centre d'Etudes
de Recherches Nucleaires), the multi-national European high-energy
physics reserach center near Geneva, Switzerland.

<HEAD>Stock Market Grade for First Quarter: Not Bad</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHET CURRIER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The stock market spent the first three months of
1988 healing some of the wounds it suffered last fall.
   But as the end of the quarter arrived on Thursday, it was still
suffering from the after-effects of the crunch that culminated on
Black Monday Oct. 19.
   By maintaining a moderate but steady pace of growth, the economy
has done its part so far to reassure investors that the crash
wasn't an immediate harbinger of a recession or something worse.
   Yet many frightened analysts and investors seem reluctant to put
much credence in the favorable news, reasoning that the market last
fall foresaw something that hasn't yet become visible to the naked
eye.
   If the economy isn't going to slide immediately into a
recession, the pessimists argue, then it might be heating up so
much that the Federal Reserve will be forced to tighten credit,
inducing a business slump later on.
   The confusion that reigns in the marketplace is illustrated by
the two worst-performing stock groups in the first quarter through
March 23, as calculated by Standard & Poor's Corp.
   Gold mining stocks suffered the biggest decline, falling 8.9
percent, presumably reflecting a drop in inflationary expectations.
   But savings and loan holding companies, down 7.5 percent, seemed
to be signaling expectations of rising interest rates prompted by
increased inflationary pressures.
   Still, analysts at some of Wall Street's biggest brokerage firms
describe the touchy, cautious mood of investors as a significant
plus for the market outlook over the next few months at least.
   ``We doubt if a medium-term top in the market will be made amid
alternating worries about a too strong or too weak economy,''
maintains Phil Roth, a technical analyst at Shearson Lehman Hutton
Inc.
   ``These worries keep buying power on the sidelines and enhance
the market's technical position. It is more likely that a real top
will be made when investors are actively buying stock despite real
fundamental worries.''
   At Merrill Lynch, chief market analyst Robert Farrell contends,
``We think the market has shown unusual underlying strength in
light of the trauma of last October.
   ``Most of the flaws and concern seem to be part of the wall of
worry that strong advances need to keep going.''
   The market made some grudging progress in the past week, which
was cut to four sessions by the Good Friday holiday. The Dow Jones
average of 30 industrials rose 9.11 to 1,988.06, closing out the
first quarter with a net gain of 49.23 points.
   Other readings for the week showed the NYSE's composite index up
0.02 at 146.60; the NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter
market up 2.10 at 374.64, and the American Stock Exchange market
value index up 1.77 at 296.43.
   Volume on the Big Board averaged 146.80 million shares a day,
against 157.26 million the week before.
   Edward Yardeni, economist Prudential-Bache Securities, has been
a vocal optimist lately, arguing that steady growth is possible for
the next several years.
   He contends that the markets, in particular the bond market, now
exert a powerful degree of discipline over economic conditions.
   ``Economywide recessions are unlikely to occur in the future,''
he argues. ``Rolling recessions that are limited to certain
industries and sectors of the country are more likely to occur.
   ``Market forces will keep the economy from booming. So it won't
develop the excesses which typically set the stage for an
economywide recession.
   ``Global competitive pressures are intense and will keep a lid
on wage and price inflation. Such a scenario should be bullish for
both stocks and bonds.''

<HEAD>US Sugar Planting to Expand, Threatening Imports</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CARL HARTMAN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. sugar beet growers plan to increase their
plantings, a move the Sweetener Users Association said on Thursday
may reduce imports again.
   The U.S. Department of Agriculture reports that a survey in
March indicated that sugar beet growers intend to plant 1.29
million acres, an increase of 1.6 percent.
   ``If sugarcane growers in Florida, Hawaii, Louisiana and Texas
follow suit, higher domestic sugar production would force the fifth
consecutive reduction in U.S. sugar import quotas,'' the
association said in a statement.
   Calculation of quotas is mandated by existing U.S. law.
   Tom Hammer, the president of the association, added:
   ``This is bad news for many of our Caribbean, Latin American,
Asian and African trading partners who have seen their sugar sales
drop from from 2.2 billion dollars to just under 400 million since
1981.''
   The Dominican Republic has the biggest import quota, followed by
the Philippines.
   Last December President Ronald Reagan's administration reduced
the quota to 750,000 tons, compared with 5 million tons in 1981.
The action was the fifth reduction in a row and brought imports to
the lowest point in 113 years. There were strong protests from the
governments of sugar-exporting countries.
   ``Unless the legislation is changed, the trends will continue,''
U.S. Agriculture Secretary Richard E. Lyng predicted then.
   Lyng said in January that the administration would like to kill
the sugar program as enacted by Congress. It keeps prices high in
the United States for the benefit of domestic farmers, at the
expense of countries which traditionally export it to the United
States.
   Legislators from urban areas have put forward a plan to cut the
U.S. price and increase imports, saying price support for U.S.
sugar benefits only 10,000 growers and costs U.S. consumers $3
billion a year. They have had little response from other membes of
Congress sympathetic to farm interests.
   Last month the Agriculture Department raised its estimate of
world production for the 1987-8 season by 1 percent to 101.9
million metric tons, 900,000 tons less than than last season's crop.
   The Sweetener Users Association said U.S. sugar beet farmers
last year indicated that they planned a 1.3 percent increase in
acreage but actually planted 3.1 percent more, resulting in a
record U.S. output of nearly 4 million tons.
   Partly because of the high price of beet and cane sugar,
sweeteners made from corn and other products have been taking a
larger share of the U.S. market. Consumption of sugar has been
declimning.

<HEAD>World Bank Lends $400 Million to Argentina</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The World Bank approved a $400 million loan
package Thursday to financially troubled Argentina and its banks.
   Funds from the 15-year low interest loan will be released in two
stages. The first half will become available immediately, with the
release of the final $200 million contingent on the success of
Argentina's economic recovery.
   The World Bank said it made the loan to encourage deposits and
confidence in the Argentine banking system, improve the
distribution of credit and reduce its cost.
   This action comes after a $317 million loan from the
International Monetary Fund two weeks ago. The IMF loan, which was
also conditional on reductions in the government deficit, was
designed to trigger a release of funds by private banks.
   Argentina is the Third World's third largest debtor, after
Brazil and Mexico, with a total debt estimated at $50 billion, of
which $3.5 billion is owed to the IMF.
   Argentina's situation is complicated by inflation that reached
175 percent last year and appears headed in the same direction for
1988.

<HEAD>Talks With Westinghouse Halted</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Dravo Corp. says negotiations to sell its
waste-to-energy business to Westinghouse Electric Corp. have been
halted.
   The move will ``enable both companies to explore alternative
options to achieving their respective objectives,'' said Thomas J.
Ward, Dravo's acting chief executive officer.
   The business ultimately could go to Westinghouse, Ward said, but
the sale ``is now more likely to involve one of the potential
buyers who expressed interest prior to the reaching of the
preliminary agreement with Westinghouse.''
   Dravo officials also said the company has executed a letter of
intent to sell its interests in geothermal energy production in
California to a joint venture organization formed by Bonneville
Pacific Corp. of San Jose, Calif., and Calpine Corp. of Salt Lake
City.
   Included in the planned sale are Dravo's geothermal power
generation facility and a contract for the future supply of power
from a planned second unit, the company said Thursday.
   Terms of the sale were not disclosed.
   ``The sale of our stake in geothermal operations complements the
divestiture actions now under way involving Dravo's other
engineering and construction businesses,'' Ward said.

   Donald Kingsborough, chairman and founder
of Worlds of Wonder Inc., agreed to leave the debt-saddled toy
maker as part of its bankruptcy terms, the company announced
Thursday.
   The agreement involves banks and unsecured creditors and has
bankruptcy court approval, WOW said.
   The new management team includes president and chief operating
officer Angelo Pezzani and Stephen J. Hopkins as chief executive
officer. Hopkins is executive vice president of Nightingale &
Associates Inc., a New Canaan, Conn.-based management consulting
company.
   Kingsborough, who said earlier in March that he had no intention
of stepping down, has not disclosed his plans. The company said he
would be available to assist the new chief executive officer.
   ``With the bank's support and toy specialists on the management
team, I believe that Worlds of Wonder Inc. is entering a new era
which will inspire retailer and vendor confidence and active
participation,'' he said in a press release.
   ``Now the company can get on with what it does best _ creating
and marketing innovative toys with exceptional play value,'' he
said.
   WOW said the new arrangements call for a business and operating
plan to be presented to the banks and unsecured creditors for
approval, with financing then being negotiated.
   The high-tech toy manufacturer owes creditors about $260 million
and has missed $3.6 million in interest payments to bondholders. It
lost $186.9 million in the quarter ending Dec. 31, and the stock
has plunged from $29 a share after it went public in June 1986 to
$1.31\, up 12{ cents Thursday in over-the-counter trading.
   Kingsborough, 41, a former executive with Atari Corp., founded
WOW in March 1985 and turned it into one of the fastest-growing
startup companies ever on the strength of enormous success with the
Teddy Ruxpin talking bear and the game Lazer Tag. It fell victim to
overexpansion and slumping sales and filed for Chapter 11
bankruptcy protection last December.
