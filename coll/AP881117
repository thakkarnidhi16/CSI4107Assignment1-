   Forty youths wielding iron pipes and
clubs hurled firebombs on Thursday at a housing complex for families
of U.S. troops, U.S. authorities said. Two servicemen were wounded.
   The assailants, believed to be radical students, escaped after
damaging or destroying nine military vehicles and passenger cars,
the officials said.
   Attackers yelled ``Yankee go home!'' during the evening assault
about one mile from the U.S. 8th Army headquarters near central
Seoul, authorities said.
   Ten firebombs exploded and caused at least $15,000 in damage,
said a military spokesman.
   Gen. Louis C. Menetrey, who commands U.S. forces in Korea, issued
a statement Friday calling the attackers ``cowardly criminals.''
U.S. officials said security was increased at the housing complex.
   A U.S. Army spokesman said the youths attacked the back gate of
the Hannam Village complex, which houses about 2,500 military
dependents. At least 15 youths got inside, he said, speaking on
condition of anonymity.
   The spokesman said the back gate is used for road traffic and was
open, with two guards on duty. He said additional help was called,
but the attackers fled.
   An Army news release said a U.S. military policeman was hurt when
the youths hit him with iron pipes. A U.S. officer was injured when
a pipe was thrown through the windshield of his car.
   The soldiers' identities were withheld.
   Hannam Village is leased from the Korean National Housing Corp.
for use by U.S. military dependents. It faces Dankook University.
Radical students attacked the housing area front gate twice in
October with no reports of injury.
   In central Seoul on Thursday, riot police battled thousands of
farmers chanting ``Drive out the Yankees!'' and trying to march on
the U.S. Embassy to protest American farm imports.
   About 2,000 riot police blocked an estimated 7,000 farmers and
other protesters.
   Hundreds of protesters hurled rocks and bricks at police and
attacked troopers with clubs after the march was blocked a few
hundred yards from the embassy. Students joined the march and threw
a few firebombs at police.
   The United States has been pressuring South Korea to open its
markets to American imports, especially agricultural products, to
help ease Washington's $10 billion annual trade deficit with Seoul.

   The U.S. Supreme Court refused late
Thursday to lift a stay of execution for man who killed an inmate in
a dispute over a diamond ring, marking the second time the man's
execution has been blocked against his wishes.
   In a ruling handed down shortly after 9 p.m. CST, the Supreme
Court denied the state's motion to vacate a stay that had been
issued to Gerald Smith earlier Thursday by the 8th U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals in St. Louis.
   In a 7-3 ruling handed down about 5 p.m. in St. Louis, the court
said it needed more time to review Smith's case, including the issue
of whether he is competent to abandon his appeals. Smith had been
scheduled to die at 12:01 a.m. Friday.
   The execution would have been the first in Missouri since 1965,
the first under the state's 11-year-old reinstated capital
punishment law and the first use of lethal injection, a change from
the former gas chamber.
   Smith, 30, has said he wants to die now rather than spend years
on death row awaiting ``the inevitable.''
   Smith's wife, Lynn, filed a petition with the court earlier
Thursday, seeking to stop the execution, contending Smith is not
competent to abandon his appeals. The Missouri Public Defenders
Commission had asked the U.S. Supreme Court for a stay.
   Smith was sentenced to die for the 1985 stabbing death of inmate
Robert Baker. He also had been scheduled to die Oct. 4 for the 1980
beating death of Karen Roberts, a former girlfriend, but the 8th
Circuit stayed that execution, saying it needed more time to
determine if Smith was competent to abandon his appeals.
   Authorities said Baker was killed in a dispute over a diamond
ring, although Smith said he committed the murder so he could be
executed. Smith has said he killed Ms. Roberts because she gave him
a venereal disease and caused him to lose his fiancee.
   Last month, Mrs. Smith stood by her husband in his decision to
abandon his appeals, but recently decided to challenge his
competency and try to get the latest execution halted. Mrs. Smith, a
registered nurse from California, got to know Smith through letters
and married him last year in the prison.
   ``Gerald Smith is a very sick and emotionally disturbed young man
who is not competent to decide whether to abandon his appeals and
acquiesce in his execution,'' said Mrs. Smith's motion for a stay.
   The state's response contended Smith's competency has already
been established and criticized Mrs. Smith for her ``eleventh hour''
request for a stay.
   In a telephone interview from the prison Wednesday, Smith said
his wife had joined forces with those trying to save him because she
had been ``brainwashed.''
   ``Apparently they told her it would come off and she is their
only chance to stop it,'' Smith said. ``They told her that with her
there is a 90 percent chance of stopping it.''
   Smith has vowed to start a hunger strike and threatened to commit
violence against others if his execution is halted by the courts.

   Major central banks came to the dollar's rescue
Thursday in a united buying spree that stabilized the weakening
currency. But analysts warned the recovery might be short-lived
because of continued concerns about the U.S. trade and budget
deficits.
   The coordinated worldwide buying of dollars by central banks
appeared to be the heaviest since the spring, and it lent some
support to the slumping stock market, which has been keeping a keen
eye on dollar activity.
   On Wall Street, the Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks
closed up 13.87 points at 2,052.45. But the rebound still left the
market's best known measure down about 75 points over seven sessions.
   Bond prices slipped, pushing interest rates higher. The yield on
the Treasury's bellwether 30-year bond rose to 9.15 percent from
9.11 percent, although some analysts blamed the decline on the
Treasury's auction of long-term bonds Thursday rather than the
action in the currency markets.
   Investors in the financial markets worry that a weak dollar could
drive up interest rates and spark higher inflation, since it would
raise prices of imports and some domestic commodities.
   Currency traders said the central-bank intervention began without
much success in Tokyo, as heavy buying of the dollar by the Bank of
Japan did not keep the U.S. currency from dropping to a near 40-year
low of 121.5 yen.
   The Federal Reserve Bank began selling yen for dollars in New
York, and the West German Bundesbank also bought up dollars to
reduce the supply of the U.S. currency on the market, traders said.
The central banks of Britain, Switzerland, France, Italy, Austria
and other nations then joined in.
   The dollar rebounded to about 122.6 yen in Europe before slipping
to 122.2 in New York. The dollar gained ground against all other
major currencies.
   On Friday morning in Japan, the dollar opened at 122.15 yen, and
by midmorning was trading at about 122.23 yen.

   The remains of four U.S. servicemen
reported missing in action in Indochina during the Vietnam War
arrived in the United States on Thursday.
   The bodies will be transferred to Tri Services Mortuary at the
Oakland Army Depot, where final arrangements will be made by their
families, said Master Sgt. Richard Castillo at Travis Air Force
Base, about 45 miles northeast of San Francisco.
   A brief ceremony was held to honor the men whose remains were
returned to U.S. officials by the Vietnamese government earlier this
year. They earlier were cleared for entrance by federal officials in
Hawaii.
   Three of the men were identified as Army Maj. Kenneth J. Yonan,
of Chicago, reported lost on April 24, 1972; Navy Lt. j.g. M.D.
McMican, of Topenish, Wash., lost June 2, 1965; and Navy Lt. j.g.
Gerald M. Romano, of New York, lost June 2, 1965.
   One soldier's name was withheld at the request of his family.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher said
Thursday the recent Palestine Liberation Organization policy
statement offers ``signs of hope'' that should be explored through a
revived Middle East peace effort.
   At a news conference, Mrs. Thatcher said acceptance by the PLO
parliament in exile of two key United Nations resolutions on the
Middle East represents a ``modest step forward'' on which progress
toward peace could be made.
   And in a separate interview with reporters and editors of The
Washington Post and Newsweek magazine, the prime minister declared
that the policies of Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev have ended
the Cold War between the East and the West.
   At a news conference shortly before ending her two-day visit
here, Mrs. Thatcher offered a slightly more upbeat appraisal of the
declaration by the Palestine National Council than the Reagan
administration.
   The State Department said Wednesday ``more movement on key
issues'' will be required by the PLO before the United States
regards it as ready to participate in the Middle East peace process.
   But Mrs. Thatcher said the indications of PLO flexibility should
be encouraged, otherwise ``you won't get further moves.''
   She called for a ``strenuous effort,'' including heavy pressure
on both Israel and the Arabs, to get peace negotiations started.
   On the specifics of the declaration, Mrs. Thatcher indicated that
she shares the administration's views.
   While offering restrained praise for the PNC stand on U.N.
Security Council resolutions 242 and 338, Mrs. Thatcher said she
opposes the PNC proclamation establishing an independent state and
added the declaration did not go far enough in repudiating terrorism.
   ``Obviously there are a lot of things in it that none of us
like,'' she said.
   The two U.N. resolutions call for Israeli withdrawal from
occupied territories and asserts the right of all countries in the
area to live within secure borders.
   The administration has said the PLO declaration on the
resolutions was ``an advance'' compared with previous statements.
But it said the council declaration as a whole falls short of U.S.
requirements for opening a dialogue with the PLO.
   During the hour-long interview with The Washington Post and
Newsweek, Mrs. Thatcher said, ``We're not in a Cold War now'' but in
a ``new relationship much wider than the Cold War ever was,''
according to a story in the Post's Friday editions.
   Gorbachev's policies have affected East-West relations
profoundly, Mrs. Thatcher said, adding that the previous ``minimal
relationship'' with Moscow that focused on arms control has expanded
to include trade, culture and other major issues.
   ``I expect Mr. Gorbachev to do everything he can to continue his
reforms,'' she said. ``We will support it.''
   At the news conference, Mrs. Thatcher reaffirmed her high regard
for President-elect George Bush, citing his extensive experience in
government as a major asset.
   ``You will have a president who doesn't have to be briefed,'' she
said.
   She said Bush has carried out his many missions to Europe as vice
president ``superbly,'' including his effort to ensure U.S.
intermediate-range missiles were installed in allied countries on
time in 1983.
   Before a breakfast meeting with Bush on Thursday, Mrs. Thatcher
said she had ``not the slightest shadow of a doubt'' that Bush will
deal responsibly with the budget deficit.
   She offered similar expressions of confidence in Bush and the
U.S. economy in network television interviews she had at her
temporary residence in the Blair House, across the street from the
White House.

<TEXT>
   A prosecutor told jurors Wednesday that
reputed mob boss Nicodemo ``Little Nicky'' Scarfo and 16 associates
should be convicted of racketeering based on their own recorded
words.
   Defense lawyers, in their final arguments, said the government
relied on liars and hearsay to form its case.
   ``According to the defendants, all the witnesses lied. And the
defendants tell you that the Mafia is a figment of the imagination
of (informants) DelGiorna and Caramandi,'' Assistant U.S. Attorney
Arnold Gordon said. ``Now that is not true. There is a mob. The
evidence has proven it.''
   Gordon's statements came after the jury heard from the last of
the defense lawyers, Robert Simone, who represents Scarfo.
   The 59-year-old Scarfo, who authorities say heads the Mafia in
the Philadelphia-southern New Jersey area, and his 16 associates are
standing trial on federal racketeering charges, which include
allegations of nine murders, extortion and loan sharking.
   The jurors, sequestered since the two-month trial began, are
scheduled to receive instructions from U.S. District Judge Franklin
VanAntwerpen Thursday morning before beginning deliberations.
   Simone suggested the government was trying to prove his client
guilty through newspaper stories identifying Scarfo as a mob boss,
not by evidence.
   ``That's how they want to prove the Mafia exists and that's how
they want to prove his guilt,'' Simone said.
   Simone, like the other defense lawyers, hammered hard at the two
star government witnesses, Thomas DelGiorno and Nicholas Caramandi.
Both accepted government plea bargains and are under government
protection.
   ``Is it possible for you to remove from your notes or remove from
your minds the testimony of Caramandi and DelGiorno and other
government witnesses?'' Simone asked. ``If you do, you will find
that the government case will collapse like a house of cards.''
   But Gordon noted that, besides the testimony, the government
presented 15 to 20 hours of secretly recorded conversations.
   ``You heard Scarfo on the tape, and what he was talking about
with others,'' Gordon said. ``They were talking about the Mafia.
Their words.
   ``It is on the basis of those words that the government wants you
to find these defendants guilty, not on newspaper articles.''
   Gordon acknowledged that a good deal of the evidence came from
the two informants.
   ``The defense would like you to believe that DelGiorno and
Caramandi told you lies, and that there is no case, but that is not
true,`` Gordon said.
   Gordon acknowledged that the two witnesses were criminals, but
said they were government witnesses ``because that's how you
prosecute mob members.''
   ``(Law-abiding citizens) don't associate with the kind of people
the evidence shows these defendants are. The only people who can
tell you about the mob and how it works are people inside the mob.
   ``People like Caramandi and DelGiorno are not found among honest
citizens. They are found in the sewers of the underworld.''
   On the basis of testimony from DelGiorno and Caramandi a year
ago, Scarfo and former City Councilman Leland Beloff were convicted
of trying to extort $1 million from a developer.

   Teddy Corbett-Winder has organized his own
funeral to avoid bothering anyone with a mortician's bill.
   The 72-year-old retired businessman is ready to meet his maker
for a bargain price of less than $180.
   A carpenter made a chipboard box coffin for less than $125, and a
friend will take him to his final resting place in a station wagon.
   Corbett-Winder keeps dirty laundry in the coffin under his bed at
his home in Exeter, southwest England, until it is needed.
   ``All they will have to do is roll me out of my bed and straight
into the box,'' he said.
   He has also written his epitaph: ``Edmund Frederick
Corbett-Winder, 1916-? No Rip Off.''
   ``I'm deadly serious. Funerals can cost more than 1,000 pounds
($1,800) and I'm not leaving any cash to the funeral directors,'' he
said. ``Once I've slipped a few quid (pounds) to my mates to carry
the coffin and paid the cremation fee it will be very cheap.''
   He has already had a trial run for his cremation. ``It was
beautiful, but a bit hard on the backside. I'll have to put in a
cushion and pillow,'' he said.
   Corbett-Winder, a grandfather, said he will leave all his money
to the Exeter Hospice, where he works as a volunteer.

   A man charged with burglarizing three

authorities said.
   Harry Dowell, 58, was listed in good condition at Mercy Hospital,

Inc., authorities said.
   Police arrested Dowell at the elevator after he telephoned
authorities early Wednesday, identified himself as a burglar and
said he had hurt his left leg, Police Capt. Steve Molinari said.
   Dowell told police he had broken into two other elevators,
Molinari said, and he was charged with three counts of felony
burglary.
   Dowell, who was released from the South Dakota State Penitentiary
earlier this month after serving almost seven years for burglary,
fell and hurt his ankle as he was trying to close a sliding door at
City Elevator, Molinari said. He told police he had decided to spend
the night there.
   Dowell crawled to the office area, where he made himself coffee
and enjoyed a few lollipops before the pain prompted him to call
police.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Eight pilots in Colorado and Utah were indicted
Wednesday for allegedly failing to disclose drug and alcohol-related
convictions when they applied for medical certification from the
federal government, the Transportation Department said.
   The eight indictments ``involve false statements made to the FAA
(Federal Aviation Administration) by pilot applicants for medical
certification,'' Transportation Secretary Jim Burnley said in a
statement.
   The maximum penalties faced by the pilots if convicted are five
years in prison and a $5,000 fine. The statement did not indicate
whether the pilots worked for commercial air lines.
   Burnley said there are likely to be more indictments as part of a
special national effort by the departments of transportation and
justice to achieve a drug-free transportation system.
   ``Our inspector general is pursuing similar investigations in all
50 states, and further criminal charges are expected,'' said Burnley.
   Twenty-seven airline pilots, flight instructors and private
pilots were indicted on Sept. 30 in the first such actions by the
Transportation Department.
   ``These indictments reflect the serious problem of drug and
alcohol abuse that affects all parts of our society. ... That is why
I issued this week drug testing regulations covering 4 million
employees in sensitive safety and security positions in commercial
aviation, railroads, mass-transit, interstate trucking and in the
maritime and pipeline industries...,'' Burnley added.

<HEAD>Old Arguments Pop Up In State Southern Baptist Conventions</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Southern Baptists convening in 11 states decided Wednesday to
give a little less to charity, interpret the Bible for themselves
and work seriously toward uniting moderate and conservative factions
in the nation's largest Protestant denomination.
   Southern Baptists from Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky,
Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, Oklahoma, South Carolina,
Tennessee and Virginia have been meeting most of this week to elect
new officers and define bylaws tht govern the Southern Baptist
Convention.
   Always present during the proceedings is a power struggle between
moderate Baptists, who believe the Bible is authoritative but open
to scholarly interpretation, and fundamentalists, who take a literal
interpretation of the Bible and have controlled the 14.7
million-member denomination for the past decade.
   In Florida, Southern Baptists voted to cut back the
denomination's donation to national and international causes.
   Some 2,200 Baptists, gathered at 127th annual Florida State
Baptist Convention in Lakeland, Tuesday approved giving to charity
47.65 percent, or $10.3 million of their $21.6 million budget next
year, down from 50 percent.
   The Rev. Jack Snell, chairman of the budget-allocations
committee, said budget requests are up $500,000 from last year, most
of it due to debt payments, salary adjustments, program increases
and such expenses as insurance.
   Florida Baptists elected as their president the Rev. Bill
Billingsley, a 54-year-old pastor from Hollywood. Al Townsend Jr., a
layman from Niceville, was elected first vice president.
   In Georgia, Baptists closed their three-day convention with a
vote that reaffirmed Baptists' right to interpret the Bible as they
see it. During Wednesday's final session, a resolution that says
pastors can encourage members to ``exercise the traditional
privileges and rights of believers as priests'' passed on a 791-629
vote.
   The moderate-backed resolution challenged a measure passed by the
national convention that gave pastors more authority for running
their churches and interpreting scriptures for their congregations.
   Convention delegates also voted on six resolutions that could
affect policies at more than 3,000 affiliated churches. Among the
resolutions were official statements opposing pornography, abortion
and legalized gambling. The gambling resolution warned Baptists that
the state legislature will soon consider establishing a lottery.
   The Alabama Baptist State Convention ended Wednesday with a new
president being selected by acclamation for the first time in
decades.
   The Rev. Charles Carter, a conservative Birmingham pastor, was
the only candidate nominated to succeed layman Steve Tondera, who
served the customary two years as convention president.
   ``I would describe my posture as bridge building or centrist,''
Carter said. ``By concentrating on that on which we agree, we can
continue to defuse that on which we disagree. I put that as a
priority.''
   Tennessee Baptists agreed Wednesday to open several group homes
for retarded adults in Tennessee, approved a $25.8 million budget,
selected Calvin Metcalf of Knoxville as the group's president and
decided to support a three-year missions partnership with the
Philippines.
   The Mississippi Baptist Convention on Wednesday denounced
criticism leveled at slain civil rights leader Martin Luther King
Jr. by a state denomination leader earlier this year. The convention
adopted a resolution condemning remarks made by Curtis Caine of
Jackson that praised South African apartheid and labeled King as a
fraud.
   The convention's 1,961 delegates also voted unanimously to elect
the Rev. Jim Futral, pastor of a Jackson church, to a second
one-year term as president.
   In Virginia, Baptists said they may reconsider their funding of
convention ministries. About 2,500 messengers, or delegates, from
congregations across the state approved moderate-backed statements
saying they would do so unless the convention provides ``more direct
communication, accountability and flexibility regarding matters of
conscience.''

   Japanese wine lovers plunged into the first batch of
France's 1988 Beaujolais Nouveau early today, marking the start of
what industry officials predict will be a record year in sales of
the wine in Japan.
   A fleet of more than 400 trucks loaded to the brim with cases of
new Beaujolais spread out across Tokyo to deliver the red burgundy
to restaurants and distributors following its release by customs.
   Because the distribution embargo on the wine was lifted at
midnight local time around the world, Tokyoites received their
Beaujolais Nouveau eight hours ahead of Parisians.
   Corks popped and wine glasses brimmed over at one of the first
Beaujolais Nouveau parties of the year at Le Maestro, a French
restaurant in Tokyo.
   Shigeta Saito, a well-known psychiatrist and one of some 30
guests at the restaurant, led the toast by announcing: ``The
Beaujolais Nouveau of 1988 has arrived ... Bravo.''
   The 72-year-old Saito, who says he indulges in all types of
alcoholic beverages, said he came to the early-morning gathering
``just out of curiosity.''
   Participants, who paid $40 a head, all said they were pleased
with the newest batch of wine, released every fall following the
grape harvest.
   Hiroshi Yamamoto, lawyer and organizer of the wine-tasting, said
Beaujolais Nouveau, a newly fermented wine, appeals to Japanese wine
drinkers because it contains less tannin than wine fermented for
longer periods of time.
   ``And traditionally, Japanese have fun drinking and consuming the
fresh food items of each season,'' he added.
   Industry officials are already predicting a record year in sales
for the wine, which is produced in France's Beaujolais region.
   Officials of Suntory Ltd., a major Japanese distiller and leading
importer of Beaujolais, said overall imports of the new wine will
total 153,000 cases in 1988, an increase of over 70 percent compared
to last year.
   Suntory alone will import 23,000 cases of the 1988 Beaujolais
Nouveau wine, up from 12,000 cases last year, to meet the growing
thirst of Japanese wine drinkers, said Kiyoshi Inoue, a spokesman
for Suntory.
   Japanese consumers, who already pay the world's highest food and
beverage prices, will be expected to put up with hefty price tags on
the new Beaujolais.
   Suntory's Inoue estimated that airfreighted Beaujolais will be
sell in the range of $14 to $30 a bottle, while wine arriving one
month later by ship will for $6.50 to $15.

   NASA pronounced the space shuttle
Atlantis ``ready to fly'' and set Dec. 1 as its launch date, but the
space agency isn't divulging the liftoff time or length of the
secret Defense Department mission.
   Rear Adm. Richard Truly, NASA's associate administrator for space
flight, made the announcement Wednesday following a two-day flight
readiness review of the mission, which will carry five military
astronauts and a spy satellite.
   The launch will be the second for the shuttle program since the
Challenger explosion that killed seven astronauts in January 1986.
Following a 32-month period of major modifications, the program
resumed Sept. 29 with the successful launch of Discovery and a
five-man crew.
   ``I am pleased to report that the space shuttle Atlantis is as
ready to fly as Discovery was at this same point before its flight
last September,'' Truly said.
   The publicity that heralded Discovery's flight will be missing
for Atlantis, with NASA and the Pentagon cloaking most information
in secrecy because of the military payload.
   The exact launch time and length of the mission will not be
disclosed in advance, and once Atlantis is in orbit, there will be a
news blackout until the landing. Defense officials said the secrecy
would make it more difficult for Soviet ground and space systems to
monitor the launch and the deployment of the payload.
   Sources said they expect a liftoff about 7 a.m. EST and report
the astronauts will deploy an intelligence-gathering satellite whose
assignments include helping American intelligence officials verify
that the Soviets are complying with arms control treaties.
   The sources also reported the five crew members will conduct
several experiments aimed at defining man's role as a military
observer in space.
   The all-military crew is commanded by Navy Cmdr. Robert L.
Gibson. The pilot is Air Force Lt. Col. Guy S. Gardner and the
mission specialists are Air Force Col. Richard M. Mullane, Air Force
Lt. Col. Jerry L. Ross and Navy Cmdr. William M. Shepherd.

<HEAD>Cincinnati Approves Handgun Law</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CINCINNATI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The City Council on Wednesday overrode intense
opposition by the National Rifle Association and enacted a law
requiring prospective handgun owners to wait 15 days before picking
up their weapons.
   The ordinance, approved 7-2, takes effect Dec. 16.
   Mayor Charles J. Luken, a council member who proposed the
ordinance, praised the council for passing the law over the NRA's
pressure. The pressure included a deluge of letters and telephone
calls to council members, and booing and heckling to drown out
people who spoke in favor of the proposal at the council's public
hearing Tuesday.
   Richard Gardiner, an NRA assistant general counsel in Washington,
said Cincinnati's law appears to be broader than that of some other
cities in that it applies to handgun sales by individuals as well as
dealers. Gardiner said that without seeing a copy of Cincinnati's
law, he could not say whether the NRA would try to challenge it in
the courts.
   Some other cities and states, including California, also require
waiting periods before allowing purchase of handguns.
   The U.S. House on Sept. 15 rejected a proposed seven-day waiting
period.

<HEAD>Arms Could Have Been Used Against Republic, King Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Authorities arrested 10 people
and seized a rocket-powered grenade launcher, rifles, warheads and
other weapons believed to belong to Protestant loyalist guerrillas.
   Northern Ireland Secretary Tom King said the huge arms cache
found in British-ruled Northern Ireland on Wednesday could have been
used against targets in the Irish Republic.
   The Royal Ulster Constabulary, the province's police force, said
it arrested 10 people after seizing the arms in a predominantly
Protestant public housing project 30 miles southwest of Belfast.
   It said the weapons included a rocket-propelled grenade launcher
and five warheads, rifles, hand grenades, more than 12,000 rounds of
ammunition and inoperative scrap parts for a missile launcher.
   ``Here we have an apprehension by the police of what appear to be
loyalist weapons which, no doubt, could have been used against
targets in the republic,'' King told reporters at Stormont Castle,
the seat of government in Northern Ireland.
   ``I think it clearly indicates the importance and the effect of
increased cooperation on security,'' he said.
   Loyalist is the term used for the province's Protestant majority,
who want to remain under the British flag as part of the United
Kingdom and not merge with the overwhelmingly Roman Catholic Irish
Republic.
   Northern Ireland police said earlier that so far this year they
recovered from Catholic and Protestant guerrilla groups 438 guns,
90,000 rounds of ammunition, 9,600 pounds of explosives, 111 rockets
and mortars and 200 pounds of plastic explosive.
   Another 8,300 pounds of explosive was recovered from defused
bombs.
   The mainly Catholic and outlawed Irish Republican Army is
fighting to end British rule in Northern Ireland and unite it with
the republic.

<HEAD>Exotic Vegetables Catching On In American Supermarkets</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bok choy and escarole aren't crops for every
farmer, but an Agriculture Department economist says such exotic
food items are catching the eye of supermarket shoppers.
   Increasingly, produce counters are also including fruits that are
a bit off the trodden path of consumers: pomegranates, guava,
kumquats, and melons named Santa Clause, Casaba and Crenshaw.
   ``Specialty fruit and vegetable displays form a fundamental part
of the new up-scale image of many produce sections,'' said Catherine
Greene of the department's Economic Research Service.
   Rising demand for specialty produce is in line with a general
increase in fruit and vegetable consumption, she said. The average
American consumed 427 pounds of fruits and vegetables last year, up
12 percent since 1972. That is a farm weight equivalent before
trimming, processing and after-harvest losses, she said Wednesday.
   Greene said the per capita trend is expected to continue upward,
although there could be some year-to-year variations. For example,
she said, this year's drought probably will cause some decline from
the 1987 average.
   In any case, specialty fruits and vegetables are the rage among
many consumers, and there is no sign the demand will taper off soon.
Greene, writing in the agency's National Food Review, said there are
a number of reasons.
   ``Americans have become more health conscious, eating lots of
fruits and vegetables as part of a well-balanced diet,'' she said.
``Consequently, we want a huge selection of produce.''
   Further, Americans travel more frequently than they used to, and
many want ``foreign'' foods when they return home.
   ``Unusual fruits and vegetables are appearing on restaurant
menus,'' Greene said. ``Also influencing our diets are recent
immigrants from the Caribbean, Central America and Southeast Asia
who have brought their native foods with them.''
   A recent survey by the industry's Food Marketing Institute showed
that the number of items sold in supermarket produce departments
more than doubled to 150 between the mid-1970s and the early 1980s.
Today, more than 250 items is the norm, including new packs and
sizes of traditional fruits and vegetables, along with exotic and
specialty produce.
   Another survey conducted for a trade journal, The Packer, showed
the most frequently tried specialty fresh vegetables were alfalfa
and bean sprouts, followed by snow peas, pearl onions, parsnips,
leeks, baby vegetables, Chinese cabbage and shallots.
   Moreover, about a third of those surveyed also had seen or heard
of less widely known specialty vegetables such as Belgian endive,
bok choy, celeriac, daikon, kohlrabi, parsley root and Jerusalem
artichoke.
   The most frequently tried specialty fresh fruits, in order, were
pomegranates, persimmons, kumquats, quince and guavas.
   Additionally, at least a third of those surveyed had seen or
heard of breadfuit, passion fruit, plantains, prickly pear and red
bananas. But some fruits were nearly unkown: Asian pears,
carambolas, cherimoyas, sapotes, radiccho and rappini.
   Greene said the survey showed that consumers in the western
United States are more likely to try specialty produce and fresh
herbs, another group of growth items. One factor is the West's large
Asian and Hispanic populations, with their interests in exotic
produce.
   Also, it was shown that consumers in the upper income brackets
eat more of the speciality fruits and vegetables.
   ``They may be better informed about the variety of produce
available and better able to afford the premium prices that
specialities sometimes command,'' Greene said.

   The Agriculture Department says the value of
U.S. agricultural exports jumped 26 percent to a four-year high of
$35.2 billion in the fiscal year that ended on Sept. 30.
   Actual quantities of grain and other commodities totaled 147.5
million metric tons, up 14 percent from 129.2 million tons shipped
in 1986-87 when the value was $27.9 billion.
   The new figures released Wednesday were up from the previous
forecast issued on Aug. 25, when the value was projected at $34
billion and the volume at 146 million tons.
   Despite the sharp gains, the year's totals were still far below
the record levels of $43.8 billion and 162.3 million tons in 1980-81
before world economic conditions, high interest rates, foreign
competition and other economic factors triggered annual declines.
   Deputy Secretary Peter C. Myers credited the 1985 farm law's
lower price support mechanisms with making U.S. commodities more
competitive in world trade.
   Myers said a decline in food prices last month ``proves that
export increases did not occur at the expense of U.S. consumers,
despite this summer's damaging drought.''
   The USDA says higher commodity prices point to another increase
in the value of exports in the fiscal year that began on Oct. 1. But
it says the actual volume may decline.
   A forecast of 1989 farm exports is scheduled for release on Nov.
29.
   Wheat accounted for two-thirds of the volume increase last fiscal
year, and ``significant increases'' were reported for corn,
livestock feed and fodder, and vegetable oils.
   Overall, exports of grains and feeds accounted for more than
$12.7 billion of the total, up 37 percent.
   Other categories included: oilseeds and products, $7.7 billion,
up 19 percent; livestock products, $4.9 billion, up 24 percent;
horticultural products, $3.8 billion, up 21 percent; cotton, $2.15
billion, up 50 percent; and tobacco, $1.3 billion, up 8 percent.

   This year's drought-reduced grain and soybean
harvests will mean sharply higher feed costs for livestock producers
in the coming year, with some items costing almost half again as
much, says the Agriculture Department.
   Drought and hot weather reduced total feed grain production by 34
percent this year to the smallest total since 1983.
   Prices of feed grains, mostly corn, are expected to average 25
percent to 45 percent above last year's weighted average of $76.70
per ton, the department's Economic Research Service said Wednesday.
Soybean meal prices may average $235 to $275 per ton, compared with
$222 in 1987-88.

<HEAD>Deportation Of At Least 12 Mariel Detainees Appears Imminent</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   At least 12 Mariel prisoners have apparently
exhausted their administrative appeals and could be deported within
days, but plans are in the works by prisoner advocates to block any
deportations, a newspaper reported Thursday.
   Gary Leshaw, director of the non-profit Atlanta legal aid
organization representing Mariel detainees, said he was informed by
the Justice Department that there would be an announcement Thursday
on the prisoners.
   Meanwhile, prisoner advocate groups in Miami and Atlanta plan to
ask federal judges to stop the deportations, which if carried out
would mark the first time Cubans have been deported to their
communist homeland since May 1985, The Miami Herald reported.
   ``There is a chance if we all speak with one united voice here
and explain the merits of our case,'' said Rafael Penalver, chairman
of the Task Force of Cuban American Citizen Organizations.
   Penalver is a lawyer who helped negotiate the settlement to end
riots by 3,800 Mariel detainees in Oakdale, La., and at an Atlanta
prison last November. ``We will appeal to President Reagan. He can
block the deportations, even if the people are sitting in an
airplane at the airport.''
   A special three-member Justice Department panel was created in
the aftermath of the riots to review the cases of 113 Mariel
detainees in federal prison in Talladega, Ala. In the past two
months, the panel has looked at prison records, immigration history,
written statements from the prisoners and other materials, but there
have been no personal appearances by the prisoners or their lawyers.
   Deportations to Cuba were reinstated as part of a renewed
immigration pact between the United States and Cuba that allows up
to 20,000 Cubans and 3,000 political prisoners and their families to
emigrate and, in return, the Cuban government will take back 2,500
prisoners.
   The Justice Department contends that these prisoners are
criminals the Cuban regime injected into a boatlift of refugees from
the port of Mariel.
   Prisoners selected for deportation are being taken from a list of
Mariel inmates who were imprisoned at the time of the 1984
immigration pact.
   Jorge Mas Canosa, chairman of the Cuban-American National
Foundation, acknowledges there is much division over the
deporations, even in Dade County's Cuban exile community.
   He said the foundation favors letting Cubans apply for visas to
immigrate to the United States but opposes the deportations to Cuba.
   ``I cannot in one hand denounce the human rights situation in
Cuba and then support sending them back,'' Mas said.

   Justice Department officials have postponed
initial indictments in the massive Pentagon purchasing fraud scandal
while they debate whom to charge first.
   ``We expect action in the very near future but not this week and
probably not next week,'' said Sharon Dibbley, spokeswoman for U.S.
Attorney Henry Hudson in suburban Alexandria, Va., where the more
than 2-year-old investigation is headquartered.
   Last month, Hudson and Justice sources predicted that the first
indictments would be brought by mid-November, but now the best
estimates are that the grand jury will vote on charges either very
late in November or in early December.
   A source at Justice Department headquarters said Wednesday,
``It's still being reviewed here, over legal issues.''
   Another government source added, ``It was anticipated that
something would happen tomorrow and it will not happen tomorrow.''
   Justice Department spokesman John Russell said Assistant Attorney
General Edward Dennis, head of the criminal division, ``has never
set a timetable. He's told them to take their time and go when the
case is in shape.''
   Prosecutors say they have evidence that consultants _ including
some former high-level Reagan administration officials and former
high-ranking military men who work for the nation's largest defense
contractors _ bribed Pentagon officials for information vital to
winning contracts worth billions of dollars.
   Two corporations and three individuals were identified this week
by government and defense sources as among the potential targets of
the first charges.
   These sources said consultants William Parkin and Fred Lackner
had been offered plea bargains by prosecutors, but the pair had
declined to plead guilty to the charges offered. Those charges
included conspiracy and bribery, the sources said.
   The sources also said prosecutors were weighing charges against
Teledyne, Inc., and Hazeltine Corp., both of which were searched in
FBI raids last June.
   The sources also suggested that charges were being contemplated
against Stuart Berlin, a procurement specialist with the Naval Air
Systems Command. Berlin and four other Pentagon employees have been
transferred away from contract work.
   Other sources, however, had said earlier that no government
employee would be among the first group charged.
   Parkin has said he paid Lackner $15,000 to $18,000 in late 1986
for information on a pending Navy contract for equipment to
distinguish hostile and friendly aircraft. Parkin said he then
turned the information over to Hazeltine on Long Island, N.Y.
   Parkin said he concluded the information came from Berlin but
that it was not secret.
   Parkin also has said he split fees with Lackner from Teledyne
Electronics of Newbury Park, Calif., which was seeking an Air Force
contract. But Parkin said they did not have to do any work in that
case.
   Lackner's attorney, William Dougherty, said his client ``never
gave anybody a nickel.''
   Berkley Baker, a Teledyne spokesman, said, ``We were told this
week by the Justice Department that they have made no decision yet.
We are not going to respond to unofficial statements from the
government. When the government has an official statement, we will
respond.''
   Jim Orso, a spokesman for Hazeltine, said, ``We are not
commenting on the investigation in any form.''
   Berlin could not be reached for comment.
   Some observers have questioned whether Hazeltine and Teledyne
should be included in the same indictment because they did not
compete for the same contracts even though they employed the same
consultants.
   One Justice source said there were legal arguments on both sides
of that question, and the arguments and theories were changing
regularly in the complex case.
   ``These things tend to change almost daily as you sift the
evidence,'' this source said. ``But we don't want to end up with 30
trials.''
   Hudson has said charges could be brought over a period of up to a
year.
   At the Justice Department, William Hendricks, chief of the fraud
section, said, ``The department is simply interested in ensuring
that any actions taken are done diligently and aggressively but with
care and to insure propriety.''

   Dave O'Brien needed help and he got plenty of
it from some big names in the Democratic Party: Paul Simon, Bill
Bradley, Joe Biden. They all were eager to help O'Brien in his
campaign to unseat Republican Rep. Tom Tauke.
   Their appearances weren't enough. O'Brien got only 36 percent of
the vote on Election Day.
   But for Sens. Simon, Bradley and Biden, the effort wasn't wasted.
For them, a chance to campaign in Iowa, to make a few friends in the
state that holds the nation's first presidential caucuses every four
years, is no waste of time.
   Other familiar Democratic faces who campaigned in Iowa in 1988
were Jesse Jackson, Rep. Richard Gephardt of Missouri, the winner of
the 1988 Iowa caucuses, and former Gov. Bruce Babbitt of Arizona.
   Sen. Albert Gore Jr. of Tennessee bypassed Iowa during the caucus
campaign and later as well, but he was on the road elsewhere.
   With the exception of Bradley, those are all leftover names from
1988.
   Jackson, Gephardt and Gore are considered likely contenders for
the 1992 Democratic nomination.
   Michael Dukakis, the defeated 1988 Democratic nominee, was ``back
at a job I love,'' being governor of Massachusetts. At his
appearances immediately after his defeat, supporters chanted ``'92,
'92, '92,'' but Dukakis refused to discuss the possibility of
another presidential campaign.
   Texas Sen. Lloyd Bentsen became something of a folk figure as the
Democratic vice presidential candidate and presumably will receive a
lot of early attention as a prospect for the top spot on the ticket
in four years. But Bentsen will be 71 years old in 1992.
   Another familiar name that comes up every four years is Gov.
Mario Cuomo of New York. Twice he's been mentioned and twice he's
declined to run.
   Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas decided against running n 1988, but
is certain to take another look.
   ``He doesn't know what he'll be doing in four years,'' said
spokesman Mike Gauldin.
   Sen. Sam Nunn of Georgia, a favorite of Southern conservatives,
also considered a 1988 run and opted out.
   ``It's premature to be talking about personalities in '92, me or
anybody else,'' said Nunn.
   ``It's much too early, premature and downright immature to be
talking about 1992 politics,'' said Jackson, when it became clear on
Election Night that Dukakis was going down to defeat.
   But while two-time presidential candidate Jackson brushed off
talk about 1992, he already has formed a political action committee,
Keep Hope Alive, and declared his intention to be involved in
municipal elections in 1989. He's certain to be involved in the
high-profile battle for mayor of New York where incumbent Ed Koch
will face a strong challenge fueled in part by his bitter clash with
Jackson during the 1988 New York presidential primary.
   Democratic Party chairman Paul G. Kirk Jr. hopes the potential
1992 candidates are serious when they say it's premature to start
the next presidential campaign.
   ``Our focus ought to be on 1990,'' said Kirk, who called that the
key year for determining which party has the edge when congressional
and legislative redistricting takes place after the 1990 Census.
   That process, occurring once every 10 years, is certain to shift
more House seats from the Rust Belt to the Sun Belt and force a
redrawing of lines that could change the political makeup of scores
of House districts.
   Maybe Kirk can keep Democrats focused on redistricting.
   But as he is well aware, the first poll assessing the potential
1992 field is almost certain to be taken before Christmas 1988.

<HEAD>Bush's Role In Gorbachev Meeting Will Be As VP</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   George Bush's role in next month's meeting
between President Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev will
be as vice president, and any discussions about Bush's future
dealings with the Kremlin leader will be ``fairly brief,'' a
spokesman said.
   Bush, the president-elect, will be attending the talks in New
York with Reagan when the Soviet leader is in town to address the
United Nations.
   ``It should not be expected that the meeting is being designed as
a summit or designed with a set of objectives in mind that would be
the kinds of things that we would hope for in a future meeting,''
Craig Fuller, a co-director of Bush's transition team, said
Wednesday.
   He said Bush would be prepared to take stock of U.S.-Soviet
developments over the past eight years.
   ``He will particpate in the meeting as vice president,'' Fuller
said.
   ``We're not certain exactly what the scenario is going to be for
those discussions but any discussion they have about the future I
think will be fairly brief and will be designed merely to set the
stage for each other's approach with regard to meetings in the
months ahead,'' Fuller added.
   Fuller commented at a news conference where the Bush team also
announced that all people involved in his transition are being asked
to sign a code of conduct pledging they will not leak any news about
assignments in the new administration and will avoid any conflict of
interest.
   After talks today with British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher
and a separate meeting with Reagan, Bush returns to the job of
assembling a Cabinet.
   Robert Teeter, another transition co-director, said Bush would
review candidates today for two or three Cabinet posts, which he did
not identify.

<HEAD>Study Finds No Solution To Fix Discrepancies In Benefits</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JILL LAWRENCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Social Security benefits to people born before
1917 are higher than Congress intended, but there's no practical way
to fix the inequity, a study concludes.
   Congress should neither reduce benefits to those getting the
unintended windfall nor raise them for everyone else, said the study
released Wednesday by the non-partisan National Academy of Social
Insurance.
   ``I would strongly hope that this issue can be put to rest'' as a
result of the report, said Suzanne Dilk, a former senior analyst
with the Social Security Administration and one of four experts on
the study panel.
   In a related development, lawmakers and lobbyists reacted angrily
to a draft government proposal that would make it harder for the
elderly, disabled and poor to appeal government decisions denying
them welfare or Social Security benefits.
   The proposed rule, still under review, would require people to
submit all evidence at least seven days in advance of a hearing
before an administrative law judge. Current regulations permit new
evidence to be introduced during or after the hearing.
   The benefits report focused on a category of Social Security
recipients known as ``notch babies,'' _ those born between 1917 and
1921. It said their benefits in some cases are as much as $200 a
month less than those of people born earlier. But the notch babies
are receiving the level of benefits Congress intended and in fact
are at an advantage compared to people born after them, the report
concluded.
   The inequity, the report said, lies in the fact that those born
before 1917 are getting higher benefits than Congress intended _ not
that others are receiving too little.
   The notch, or discrepancy in benefits, arose when Congress
adopted a new formula meant to keep rising Social Security benefits
at a constant percentage of a person's average pre-retirement
earnings.
   However, people born before 1917 were allowed to use the old,
over-generous method of calculation. The result: a benefit rate that
peaked in 1981 at 56 percent of average earnings, about 15
percentage points higher than what Congress had intended.
   Robert Myers, chairman of the study panel and formerly executive
director of the National Commission on Social Security Reform, said
there are probably about 1 million notch babies feeling
``substantial impact'' from the situation.
   He estimated it would cost up to $300 billion to equalize
everyone's benefits _ and that would create new notches affecting
those born in later years. He said it would be difficult and
expensive to find the individuals who got windfalls, not to mention
politically impossible to cut their benefits.
   ``We are not in favor of keeping a discrepancy in the law,'' said
panel member James Kelley, former staff director to the House Ways
and Means Committee's Social Security subcommittee. But he added:
``You find a member of Congress who wants to lower benefits. ...
Good luck.''
   Many on Capitol Hill, meanwhile, reacted angrily Wednesday to the
draft proposal making it more difficult for the elderly, disabled
and poor to appeal government decisions to deny welfare or Social
Security benefits.
   ``There they go again,'' said Rep. Claude Pepper, D-Fla., 88, the
oldest member of the House and its foremost champion of the elderly.
He challenged President-elect George Bush to kill the plan and said
if it goes forward, Congress will ``stop this thing in its tracks.''
   The draft rules on Social Security appeals were designed to
reduce a staggering load of appeals hearings. Last year, the agency
received 5.5 million claims and 250,000 requests for appeals
hearings.
   Chuck Kline, a spokesman for Health and Human Services Secretary
Otis Bowen, said the Social Security and Medicare appeals processes
must become more efficient. ``The solution they are suggesting (in
the Social Security Administration) may not be workable or doable,
and until it's reviewed, you don't know that,'' he said.
   But critics were quick to attack the draft proposals. Several
charged they would violate the spirit of the 1935 Social Security
Act as well as a 1971 Supreme Court ruling supporting an informal
and liberal appeals process easily accessible to the elderly, poor
and disabled who often do not have lawyers.
   Horace Deets, executive director of the American Association of
Retired Persons, called the proposals ``misguided and unjustified.''
   Ken Hoagland, a spokesman for the private National Committee to
Preserve Social Security and Medicare, accused the administration of
``trying to stack the deck against disability appeal claimants.''

<HEAD>Surge For Leftist Mayors Indicates Displeasure With President's
Party</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRUCE HANDLER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Brazilians expressed frustration
with President Jose Sarney's center-right government, economic chaos
and corruption by giving massive support to leftists in muncipal
elections around the nation.
   ``At least now the voters can't blame us for everything that goes
wrong with Brazil,'' said Gov. Pedro Simon of Rio Grande do Sul
state, a member of Sarney's Brazilian Democratic Movement Party.
   Early returns from Tuesday's balloting showed that the dominant
party since 1964 was taking a beating from both the right and the
left, but that leftists were surging ahead for control of major
cities.
   Final results were not expected until Sunday.
   Analysts said voters were dissatisfied with a record 1,000
percent annual inflation rate, the falling value of the cruzado,
political corruption and nearly constant strikes.
   ``The voters didn't send us just a message. A message is short.
This was a telex,'' said Gov. Wellington Moreira Franco of Rio de
Janeiro state, a member of Sarney's party.
   In the biggest upset, Luiza Erundina, a 53-year-old social worker
and a Marxist from the Workers Party, was expected to win as mayor
of Sao Paulo, the country's largest city.
   With 15 percent of the city's more than 5 million votes counted,
Ms. Erundina led Paulo Maluf, a wealthy industrialist and former
military-backed presidential candidate, by 4 percent.
   Ms. Erundina told reporters she would concentrate municipal
funding on public health, transportation and abandoned children,
areas in which ``hardly anything ever was invested before.''
   In Rio, the No. 2 city, the winner was Marcello Alencar, a
63-year-old lawyer from the leftist Democratic Labor Party. He is a
close ally of Leonel Brizola, the expected candidate of the left in
next year's presidential elections.
   With 28 percent of the ballots counted, Alencar had one-third
more votes than his closest opponent.
   The projected winner in Belo Horizonte, the third-largest city,
was Joao Pimenta da Veiga Filho, 41, of the left-center Brazilian
Social Democracy Party. This group recently broke away from Sarney's
party.
   The Democratic Movement, which swept mayoral elections in 1985
and captured 22 of 23 state governorships in 1986, appeared headed
for mayoralty wins in just four capitals.
   Leftists seemed assured of victory in at least seven important
state capitals. Candidates from various groups to the right of
Sarney's were headed toward wins in seven other capitals.
   The biggest prize for the rightists was the large northeastern
city of Recife, where Joaquim Francisco Cavalcanti, 40, of the
Liberal Front Party, was far ahead. He resigned this year from
Sarney's Cabinet.
   Races in the remaining capitals were too close to call or the
results were not yet in because of the cities' remoteness.
   The Democratic Movement and Sarney have controlled Brazilian
politics since the nation of 144 million returned in 1985 to
civilian rule after a 21-year military dictatorship.
   Brazil is in the throes of its worst strike by petroleum workers.
The state-owned oil monopoly Petrobras said Wednesday that Brazil
has nearly run out of diesel oil and cooking gas because of the
six-day nationwide strike.
   Twenty-nine parties participated in the election for mayors and
city councils of more than 4,000 cities and towns.
   The races were based largely on local issues, but analysts said
they indicate general feelings about presidential elections
scheduled for Nov. 15, 1989. It will be the first presidential
election in Brazil in 29 years.
   The 58-year-old Sarney is a civilian, but he gained office
indirectly through an electoral college system imposed by the
departing military regime. He was the vice presidential candidate on
a ticket headed by Tancredo Neves, a popular centrist political
figure. Neves died before he could assume office, and Sarney moved
into the top spot.

<TEXT>
   Problems among foreign coal producers and the
lower dollar abroad contributed to a 247 percent increase in the
amount of U.S. coal shipped through the St. Lawrence Seaway,
officials say.
   The increase, to 569,000 metric tons, was recorded during the
period from April to October, as compared to the same period last
year.
   Spurring the demand for American-mined coal were the lower value
of the dollar; competitive worldwide ocean freight rates; a tight
supply due to a series of industrial disputes last summer in
Australia; sanctions against using South African coal; and
production problems and rising production costs in Poland.
   U.S. coal exports through the seaway in April-October of 1987
totaled 234,000 metric tons. In 1985 and 1986, the biggest coal
years since 1982, coal exports just exceeded 600,000 tons each year.
   James L. Emery, administrator of the Saint Lawrence Seaway
Development Corp., which operates the U.S. portion of the
American-Canadian channel, said the majority of U.S. export coal
through the system so far this year has been transported to Denmark
for power production.
   Nationally, 1988 U.S. coal exports as of Aug. 31 totaled 52.2
million metric tons, up 15 percent from the same period last year,
according to the National Coal Association.
   The seaway begins at the mouth of the St. Lawrence River and runs
through the Great Lakes, ending 2,342 miles later at Duluth, Minn.

<HEAD>Nation's Median Age Heading Upward</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Thirty-nine, that magic age teetering between
youth and maturity, will be the most typical age for Americans early
in the next century, according to Census Bureau projections.
   Historically a nation of youthful orientation, the United States
is now thirty-something, heading upward, the Bureau reports.
   Combining to increase the median age of the population are the
maturing of the massive post World War II Baby Boom and that
generation's relatively low birth rates, which reduce the number of
babies to pull down the numbers.
   So if present trends continue, census officials expect that half
of all Americans will be over the age of 39 by the year 2010, and
half younger. The agency's most recent estimate of median age was
31.7, as of 1986.
   Whether America will plateau at 39 _ as did the late comedian
Jack Benny _ remains to be seen.
   The median age of the country touched 30 for the first time in
1950, then slipped back as the Baby Boom produced a bouncing crop of
youngsters to lower the numbers.
   It took until the 1980 census to hit 30 again, edged up to 31.7
as of 1986 and is expected to climb to 33 by 1990, 36.5 by 2000 and
39 by the year 2010, according to the new projections from the
Census Bureau.
   Despite the aging of the population, however, the report
anticipates that the so-called dependency ratio will decline.
   That ratio is the number of people under 18 and over 65 compared
to the number of people of working age in between. The younger and
older groups are most likely to ``depend'' on those working.
   The 1986 ratio of 62.2 dependents per 100 workers is expected to
slip to 56.7 by the year 2010, with the low birth rate reducing the
number of young dependents to a greater extent than aging adds to
the older group.
   While there have been reports of increases in the total number of
births in the last few years, that is because the giant Baby Boom
generation is largely in its prime childbearing years. The rate of
births per 1,000 remains well below that of the post-World War II
period.
   The new census study also estimates that the nation's black
population will increase to 13.7 percent by 2010. Blacks made up
11.8 percent of the population in the 1980 census.
   Nearly one in five Southerners will be black in 2010, 19.7
percent of the population. That will be up from 18.7 percent in 1980.
   In the Northeast, blacks will increase from 10.1 percent to 13.2
percent. They will go from 9.1 percent to 11.9 percent in the
Midwest and from 5.3 percent to 6.3 percent in the West.
   The projections show the Northeast remaining the oldest section
of the country, with the median age for that region increasing from
33.6 in 1986 to 40.3 in 2010.
   The South will be second in 2010 at a median age of 38.4, up from
31.4 in 1986. The Midwest will mature from 31.6 to 38.8 and the West
will go from 31.0 to 37.4.
   Florida will remain the state with the highest median age and
Utah will still be the youngest state, according to the projections.
   Florida, with a median age of 36.0 in 1986, will age to 45.3.
Utah's median will rise from 25.5 to 27.6, leaving it the only state
with a median age below 30 years, thanks largely to a continuing
high birth rate.
   In the 1986 estimates no state had a median over 40 but several
were under 30, including _ besides Utah _ Alaska, Idaho, Louisiana,
Mississippi, New Mexico, Texas and Wyoming.
   In 2010 not only Florida will have topped 40. Other states with
median ages above that milestone will include Arkansas, Connecticut,
Iowa, Maine, Nevada, New Jersey, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island,
Tennessee, Washington and West Virginia.

<HEAD>Conservatives Urge More US Covert Actions</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A conservative group contends that
President-elect George Bush should make covert action a routine
technique in the American spy arsenal.
   A study sponsored by the National Strategic Information Center
says covert action _ unacknowledged financial, political or military
action to influence events in foreign countries _ should be restored
as a common tool of U.S. foreign policy.
   ``American intelligence, as it is presently constituted, will not
be up to the challenges of the '90s,'' said Roy Godson of Georgetown
University, who edited the study. The report was released Wednesday
at a news conference.
   The report says covert action tactics have been tainted in the
eyes of the U.S. public by the Iran-Contra scandal.
   While covert actions have proliferated under the Reagan
administration, they still are viewed by the public and many within
the CIA as stepchildren, the study concluded.
   It also said U.S. intelligence analysts should do more to spot
the vulnerabilities of foreign governments and leaders and point out
opportunities for U.S. leverage and influence.
   The report said ``there will be major opportunities for the
United States to advance its interests in the 1990s through a broad
array of (covert action) techniques.''
   Kenneth E. deGraffenreid, former intelligence director at the
Reagan administration's National Security Council, said covert
action ``should be perceived as a useful, limited adjunct, and a
normal one, to statecraft.''

<HEAD>Advisory Panel Told Quick Action Needed To Cut Budget Gap</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A parade of witnesses before a
deficit-reduction commission agreed the nation is spending too much
and saving too little, but panel members said they were far from
reaching a consensus on how to resolve the problem.
   The National Economic Commission members listened to almost eight
hours of testimony Wednesday from a variety of experts, many of whom
warned of dire consequences for the United States if quick action is
not taken to cut the federal budget deficit.
   ``Simply put, we are spending too much, investing too little and
saving virtually nothing,'' said former Labor Secretary William
Brock. ``This country is imperiled and it is going to take a whole
lot of guts to face this fact and deal with it.''
   Later, commission members said they were still watching for the
first signal from President-elect George Bush on what his intentions
are for using the panel, which was created to advise President
Reagan's successor on a deficit solution.
   Both Republican Drew Lewis and Democrat Robert Strauss, who serve
as co-chairmen of the panel, said they hoped the president-elect
would soon name his two appointees to the commission so the panel
could begin serious deliberations.
   The commission already has set aside its earlier hopes of having
a deficit-cutting blueprint finished by Dec. 21. Strauss said he was
not sure the panel would be able to meet a March 1 deadline and
might have to delay the report even further.
   ``The key to the commission's role is going to be up to the
president-elect,'' said Rep. Bill Gray, D-Pa., a member of the panel
and chairman of the House Budget Committee. ``Who does he appoint,
how credible are they, do they have his ear and what are his
instructions to them.''
   Gray said the financial markets might force Bush's hand,
especially if markets continue falling because of investor concerns
over whether the president-elect and Congress will be able to come
up with a credible budget solution.
   The stock market on Wednesday tumbled to a 2{-month low in a
broad-based decline that analysts said was linked to fresh declines
in the value of the dollar. The dollar's recent slide has led stock
market investors to worry that U.S. policymakers might force up
interest rates _ threatening a further slowdown in the economy _ to
make the American currency more attractive to foreigners.
   Economists testifying before the National Economic Commission
said the $700 billion in new foreign investment which has flowed
into the country since 1982 means that the U.S. economy is more
vulnerable to foreigners' economic decisions.
   ``The rest of the world may well give up on the dollar if it
foresees four more years of towering twin (budget and trade)
deficits,'' said C. Fred Bergsten, head of the Institute for
International Economics.
   Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan told the panel that it
should not listen to those who say that bduget deficits don't matter
since the economy has managed to survive for six years without an
economic downturn in the midst of high deficits.
   ``The deficit already has begun to eat away at the foundations of
our economic strength,'' he said. ``And the need to deal with it is
becoming ever more urgent.''
   Alice Rivlin, former head of the Congressional Budget Office,
told the commission that it was facing no easy choices.
   ``The budget cannot be cut in sufficient amounts to eliminate the
deficit, except by reducing programs and benefits that some people
feel they want and need _ or by raising revenues,'' she said. ``It
is not possible to eliminate the deficit if defense, Social Security
and taxes are all ruled out simultaneously.''
   Comments of this kind were not often heard during the
presidential campaign, when both candidates sidestepped questions
concerning the deficit because they did not want to offer detailed
solutions.
   But since winning the election, Bush has been forced to address
the budget situation, pledging to work with Congress early on to
come up with a solution.
   But Bush has not indicated any willingness to abandon his
``flexible freeze'' proposal by which overall spending increases,
excluding Social Security and interest on the national debt, would
be held to the rise of inflation each year.

<HEAD>FBI Seizes Tapes and Legal Pads at Cornell in Computer Virus Probe</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Items seized in the FBI's computer virus
investigation include magnetic tapes from the computer account of a
Cornell University graduate student implicated in the contamination
of 6,000 computers nationwide.
   Documents released late Wednesday by the FBI said the magnetic
tapes were from the account of Robert T. Morris Jr., 23, a Cornell
graduate student in computer science who has told friends he created
the virus program.
   The program spread earlier this month throughout a number of
university and military computer networks, disrupting their
operation. Morris has said that he did not intend for it to invade
computer systems around the nation.
   According to the documents released Wednesday, U.S. District
Judge Gustave J. DiBianco in the northern district of New York in
Syracuse issued two warrants on Nov. 10 for the Cornell searches.
   The searches were conducted that same afternoon, the documents
indicate.
   The government had said earlier that it might try to obtain
documents from the university before interviewing Morris, and
Cornell's vice president for information technologies, M. Stuart
Lynn, had said the university would cooperate fully with the
investigation.
   No charges have been filed in the case.
   According to the FBI documents, investigators seized ``two
magnetic tapes labeled `files from Morris account including backups'
and hard copy related thereto'' from Dean Krafft, a research
associate in computer science at Cornell.
   Federal agents also obtained ``two yellow legal pads with
calculus and assorted notes.'' An associate university counsel,
Thomas Santoro, had taken the legal pads from an office in Upson
Hall, a campus building that contains computer science classrooms
and offices.
   The FBI is conducting a criminal investigation to determine
whether statutes concerning wire fraud, malicious mischief or
unlawful access to stored communications may have been broken with
the introduction of the virus into military and university computer
systems.
   A computer virus works by duplicating itself, spreading into
other programs in the computer and infecting one computer after
another as users share floppy disks or link up over telephone lines.
   Mild viruses may do nothing more than flash a provocative message
on a user's screen; ``deadly'' forms can destroy data or cripple a
computer. Some are ``time bombs'' designed to wreak havoc on a
pre-programmed date.
   The virus that infected 6,000 university and military computers
nationwide this month apparently did its damage by rapidly
duplicating itself, thereby slowing computers' processing speed and
taking up their memory space.

<HEAD>Justice Finds No Evidence To Support Pot-Smoking Allegation</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The Justice Department says it found ``no
evidence whatsoever'' to support an allegation that a former
assistant attorney general had smoked marijuana.
   The U.S. Attorney in Boston, Frank McNamara, had told
investigators he had witnessed his predecessor, William Weld,
smoking marijuana at a 1982 party in Virginia.
   A 17-page document filed Wednesday in federal appeals court by
Attorney General Dick Thornburgh said that ``whatever picture
McNamara has in his mind of three people (including Weld and his
wife) smoking marijuana together ... the overwhelming evidence is
that it was not'' the case.
   An internal memo released at the Justice Department on which
Thornburgh's court filing was based said McNamara told the FBI that
he himself had used marijuana as recently as four years ago, though
not while U.S. attorney in Boston. The internal memo, written by
criminal division chief Edward Dennis, also outlines what it says
was apparent conflict between Weld and some other Justice Department
officials.
   The memo concluded there is ``a serious doubt'' as to whether
Weld and his wife even attended the 1982 party. It said ``there is
no evidence whatsoever'' to support McNamara's story that he saw
Weld, his wife and another man ``smoking a joint together.''
   Neither of the Welds even recalls attending the party and neither
do a number of other people who know the Welds well, said the memo.
   The memo provides the basis on which Thornburgh decided not to
call on a three-member federal appeals court panel to appoint an
independent counsel to investigate Weld for possibly making a false
statement during a 1987 probe by the department's Office of
Professional Responsibility in which he denied smoking marijuana.
The court directed that Thornburgh's court filing be publicly
released.
   The memo said James Byrnes, a deputy assistant attorney general
in the Justice Department, told investigators he had been asked to
call McNamara to ``dig up some dirt'' on Weld. He said the request
was made by then-Deputy Attorney General Arnold Burns.
   McNamara then reported to Byrnes that he had witnessed Weld
smoking marijuana at the 1982 party.
   At the time, McNamara was under consideration to succeed Weld in
the Boston post. The memo said McNamara believed Weld was trying to
scuttle his nomination, but that he bore no ill will toward Weld
because holding a grudge was against his religion.
   In an interview Wednesday night, Burns denied telling Byrnes to
dig up dirt on Weld. He called Byrnes's comments ``complete and
total fabrication'' and said they bear ``no semblance with reality.''
   Burns called his relations with Weld ``excellent.''

   Everyone supposedly seeks a better mousetrap;
Fortune magazine likes the idea of a better mouse.
   For the first time, the business magazine has named an animal to
its annual list of the nation's hottest products. That fits well
with an overall trend for this year's list to the small and
technologically advanced.
   Fortune's report, contained in the Dec. 5 issue, names 12 top
items:
   _Genetic mouse. Last April, Harvard University received the first
patent for an artificially engineered higher form of life. The
mouse, being sold to researchers at $50 apiece under the trademark
OncoMouse, was created by injecting genes suspected of causing
cancer into fertilized mouse eggs. The offspring carry the implanted
gene.
   _Video Walkman. For $1,300, video junkies no longer have to leave
their favorite tape at home.
   _``E.T.'' on video. Six years after the movie made its debut, MCA
has brought out a videotape of ``E.T. _ The Extra-Terrestrial'' and
already has received orders for more than 11 million copies at
$24.95 each.
   _NEC Ultralite laptop computer. Small enough to fit into an
interoffice envelope, NEC's computer is powerful enough to run the
Lotus 1-2-3 program and four times faster than IBM's XT personal
computers. It lists for $2,999.
   _Rogaine. The first prescription hair-growth medication approved
by the Food and Drug Administration, Upjohn Co.'s product sells for
about $50 for a month's supply. The minoxidil preparation must be
used constantly or its effects stop, and only about 39 percent of
the men in clinical tests experienced even moderate hair growth.
   _Ricoh Mirai. The $795 camera has a short, adjustable handgrip
that allows the user to adjust exposure settings, the zoom lens and
shutter release with one finger.
   _No-Color mascara. Max Factor brought this out in July, and the
idea of not getting smudged circles under their eyes proved a hit
with women. The cosmetic sold out within a week, and the Revlon
subsidiary is estimated to have sold 5 million of the tubes for $12
million.
   _Personal fax machines. They took off this year, zooming to a 30
percent share of the $1.9 billion fax market, offering features once
contained in office versions.
   _Erasable optical disk. The disks allow the electronic storage of
data equivalent to 300,000 pages of type. Analysts predict sales
will grow to $1 billion a year within a few years.
   _Wilson Profile tennis racket. The extra-thick racket is changing
tennis much as the first oversize Prince racket did a dozen years
ago. The frame of a conventional racket bends back when hit by a
ball, recovering after the ball already is headed back toward the
opponent. The $225 Profile rebounds along with the ball, giving a
player's shot much more power.
   _Debt swap. By exchanging some of its bank debt for special U.S.
Treasury-backed bonds, Mexico was able to reduce its $60 billion
debt load by more than $1 billion. In the ground-breaking plan it
undertook with J.P. Morgan & Co., Mexico gave the banks the
opportunity to swap existing loans at a discount for the special,
new bonds, which carry a higher interest rate than the old debt.
   _Ergon 2 chair. The latest version of a body-conscious chair that
first appeared in 1976, it features a knob that controls back angle
and customizes the seat cushion to adjust for derrieres of all
proportions. Its maker, Herman Miller, charges $350 to $600 per
share.

   Environmentalists, public officials and
scientists are urging states to take the initiative to reduce their
emissions of carbon gases from fossil fuel use, not wait for
international action on the global warming trend.
   ``It can be done on a state-by-state basis _ the individual
counts,'' says George Woodwell of the Woods Hole Research Center in
Massachusetts. ``There are steps that should be taken by good
government pursuing the public interest.''
   Texas Agriculture Commissioner Jim Hightower says warnings by
scientists about the so-called greenhouse effect requires ``state
leadership to think globally and act locally. Turning the corner on
greenhouse gases is too big to leave to the federal government.''
   They and Tina Hobson, executive director of Renew America, cited
a variety of steps for cutting the use of oil, coal and natural gas,
the main sources of the carbon gases that experts say are
contributing to global warming.
   Among the state-level actions they recommended at a news
conference Wednesday are encouraging greater use of mass
transportation, planting trees to absorb carbon and using tax
incentives and building codes to spur more efficient energy
consumption.
   Hobson unveiled a study by Renew America, an environmental
research and advocacy organization, showing that Hightower's state
of Texas was the clearcut leader among U.S. states in carbon gas
production in 1986.
   Its 154.87 million metric tons amounted to about 12 percent of
the 1.275 billion metric tons of carbons pumped into the atmosphere
that year by the United States, the world's largest producer of
carbons and other greenhouse gases.
   Renew America said this country is responsible for about 25
percent of the world's carbon emissions, coal and natural gas,
meaning Texas is the source of about 3 percent of global carbon
loadings to the atmosphere.
   Carbons represent about half of the greenhouse gases that many
scientists say are accumulating in the atmosphere, trapping the
sun's heat and threatening the planet with rising ocean levels and
major climate changes.
   In what was billed as the first state-by-state breakdown of
carbon emissions, Renew America said that largely rural Vermont was
the nation's lowest contributor to carbon emissions, with 1.31
million metric tons in 1986.
   Renew America said it compiled its figures from fuel-use data
collected by the Department of Energy and had its report reviewed by
officials from the Environmental Protection Agency and
private-sector researchers, including Woodwell.
   The overall findings were not startling. They showed a general
correlation between a state's population and industrial activity and
its production of carbon gases.
   Texas, with a large concentration of oil refineries and chemical
plants, was No. 1 in carbon emissions from oil and natural gas _ the
cleanest burning fossil fuel _ and No. 3 in emissions from coal.
   California was second overall in 1986, producing 85.23 million
metric tons of carbons. Three out of every four tons came from use
of oil, reflecting the state's huge number of vehicles.
   Other heavy producers of carbon emissions were Ohio, 67.21
million metric tons; Pennsylvania, 65.57; Illinois, 55.04;
Louisiana, 51.73; New York, 49.57; Indiana, 49.13; Michigan, 47.12;
and Florida, 43.55.
   Renew America also calculated how many tons of carbon a state
released in relation to its economy. West Virginia, a depressed area
dominated by coal use and chemical plants, had the worst showing:
1,179 tons for each $1 million in gross state product.
   Texas, Indiana and Louisiana were the only states among the top
10 carbon producers and the bottom 10 in the ratio of tonnage to
gross state product.
   New York had the best economic-ratio showing, producing 137 tons
for every $1 million of gross state product. California's tonnage
was 160 per $1 million, compared to a national average of 306 tons
for each $1 million.

   Ivan Boesky's mansion in this exclusive
community has 10 bedrooms and Boesky himself is in prison for
insider trading, but his wife has upset neighbors by insisting she
needs more room.
   Eleven neighbors have hired a lawyer to argue that Seema Boesky
should not be granted a variance to the zoning law that says no
residential building may have more than 2{ stories.
   Mrs. Boesky has requested the variance to add a half-story to the
Georgian-style brick mansion because she needs the extra space to
accommodate her family, lawyer Henry Hocherman said Tuesday.
   But lawyer Michael Vartabedian said the neighbors, some of whom
can see the house, fear that the renovations would hurt the value of
their property.

the band members.
   ``People are trying to make us into stars, and we're not,'' Bono,
whose real name is Paul Hewson, said Tuesday. ``We're musicians.''
   The group stars in a new movie ``U2 Rattle and Hum.''
   Hewson and U2 bassist Adam Clayton are spending a few days in
Nashville during a drive across the country. ``We just got tired of
L.A.,'' Bono said. ``We just rented a car and are driving around the

   Cicciolina, Italy's porno diva parliamentarian, has
applied for a visa to visit the United States, but the American
Embassy has asked for more information on the purpose of her trip, a
spokesman says.
   The hardcore film and stage performer, whose real name is Ilona
Staller, angrily complained in the corridors of Parliament that
``the nation that has the Statue of Liberty as its symbol'' had
denied the visa.
   ``Ms. Staller was not denied a visa,'' an embassy statement said.
``Her application is pending submission of information regarding the
purpose of the trip.''
   Embassy spokesman Mark Dillen said Wednesday that Ms. Staller,
who was elected to the Chamber of Deputies in June 1987, had applied
for a tourist visa.``Someone going as a performing artist with the
intention to perform would not qualify for a tourist visa,'' he
said. ``That would require another category of visa.''
   Ms. Staller said she wanted to make a ``visit of culture and
tourism'' to the United States.

   Actor Sean Connery gets his day in court for
barroom brawling _ in the movie ``Family Business.''
   The actor, who has portrayed the debonair spy James Bond, an
aging but still-dashing Robin Hood and a street-smart Chicago cop
who takes Eliot Ness in hand, gets into trouble this time as the
patriarch of an Irish-American family.
   The movie, which also stars Dustin Hoffman and Matthew Broderick,
is about three generations of a family living in the Hell's Kitchen
section of Manhattan.
   In the scene being filmed today at State Supreme Court in
Brooklyn, Connery is brought before a judge because of a barroom
brawl, said publicist Bruce Bahrenburg. During the proceeding, the
judge elicits information about the character's long history of
arrests.

   Soul singer James Brown will make a public
apology at a wrestling match-rock concert next month as part of his
sentence on drug and related charges, officials say.
   In July, an Aiken County, S.C., judge sentenced Brown on charges
of resisting arrest, carrying a pistol and drug possession for a May
18 incident near his Beech Island, S.C., home. As part of the
sentence, Brown was ordered to perform a concert to benefit the
Aiken chapter of the Fraternal Order of Police and Helping Hands
Inc., a local organization aiding abused children.
   On Dec. 4, Brown will appear at the event at the Augusta-Richmond
County Civic Center, Brown's lawyer, A.H. ``Buddy'' Dallas, said
Wednesday.
   The show will include performance by rock artists as well as
wrestling matches, but Brown may not perform.
   Civic Center Manager Larry Rogers said he was told Brown would
merely ``make a public apology after the wrestling.''

   The brother of Beach Boys singer Mike Love has
been sentenced to five years' probation and ordered to pay $86,000
restitution for embezzling more than $400,000 from the band, which
he once managed.
   Stephen Milton Love, 40, was sentenced Wednesday by Superior
Court Judge Gordon Ringer. Love pleaded no contest last month to one
count of grand theft.
   He issued a four-page letter to the court and to reporters
criticizing his brother and the band. He said the money was taken in
``an act of economic self- defense'' because the band had defrauded
and ``stiffed'' him on other matters.
   He said members of the band launched a vendetta against him
because of his stance as ``fierce protector of the wholesome public
image of the Beach Boys ... against the use of hard drugs, namely
cocaine and heroin, by my cousins Dennis, Carl and Brian Wilson.''
   The Love brothers are related to Beach Boys band members Carl
Wilson, Brian Wilson and the late Dennis Wilson.
   A message seeking comment was left with a secretary for Beach
Boys attorney John Branca.

<HEAD>Prosecutors Say North Trying To Intimidate Justice Department</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Iran-Contra prosecutors say Oliver L. North
wants to scare the Justice Department into dropping charges against
him by seeking disclosure of ``some of our nation's most valuable
secrets.''
   Independent counsel Lawrence E. Walsh is seeking a court order to
bar North from revealing any classified information during his
defense of charges he illegally conspired to divert U.S.-Iran
arms-sale proceeds to the Nicaraguan Contra rebels.
   North showed his intention of trying to subvert the case ``by not
presenting a good-faith listing of the classified documents that he
reasonably deems necessary to defend against the indictment,'' Walsh
said in court papers filed Wednesday.
   The list of 40,000 pages of secret documents North proposed as
defense exhibits includes items that ``are simple efforts at
graymail and have no conceivable bearing on the charges in the
indictment,'' Walsh said.
   It includes documents ``which are far afield from any logical
defense,'' including ``large swatches of CIA cables concerning
Nicaragua that bear only the most tangential relation to the subject
matter in the case,'' Walsh said of the defense list filed under
court seal.
   The independent counsel asked U.S. District Judge Gerhard A.
Gesell to issue an order under the Classified Information Procedures
Act (CIPA) barring North from disclosing any government secrets
during his trial.
   ``Otherwise, North will have exposed this prosecution to
precisely the type of outcome that the drafters of CIPA worked to
avoid: a decision by the attorney general _ based purely on fear
that the price, in terms of threat to national security, is too high
_ that compels the court not to proceed with the criminal case,''
Walsh said.
   North's ``filing demonstrates once against his expectation that
intransigence will encumber the processes of law, threaten some of
our nation's most valuable secrets and provoke dismissal of the
case,'' Walsh said.
   The attorney general _ not Walsh _ has the final say about
whether to drop the charges if disclosure of secrets would threaten
national security.
   The so-called ``graymail statute'' enacted in 1980 by Congress
set up procedures to regulate the use of classified information in
court proceedings.
   Walsh argued the law is ``a critical, time-tested shield of the
government's necessary secrets and, at the same time, a device that
prevents high officeholders from escaping criminal prosecution'' by
threatening indiscriminate disclosure of secrets.
   But North ``from the outset of this litigation, has been
determined to force a failure of CIPA's procedures,'' Walsh said.
``The present notice is so grossly overblown that it invites
dismissal for lack of good faith.''
   Under CIPA,, the defense is required to submit a notice listing
the classified documents it proposes to disclose at trial. The judge
then convenes secret proceedings to determine if the documents are
relevant to the case and if they can be presented in public form.
   Walsh described the notice as ``calculated to overwhelm the
court's and the government's abilities to conduct proceedings''
under the law.
   Gesell rejected North's first list _ filed Aug. 1 _ as ``wholly
insufficient,'' later saying it ``blatantly lacked any attempt at
particularization.''
   The judge denied a similar request by Walsh to bar defense
disclosure of any secrets and gave North until Nov. 14 to file his
notice.
   On Wednesday, Walsh said the defense should be barred from using
any classified documents because ``North arrogantly disregarded the
court's repeated orders defining his obligations under CIPA.''
   North's attorneys, who have a policy of not commenting on the
case, did not return a reporter's telephone call.
   But in court papers made public Wednesday, the defense rejected
Gesell's criticism of their Aug. 1 filings as unjustified. The
lawyers disputed Gesell's holding that they were required to show
how the documents were relevant to the case.
   North, a former National Security Council aide and retired Marine
lieutenant colonel, is charged with conspiring to defraud the
government by illegally diverting to the Contras more than $12
million in profits from the arms-for-hostage sales to Iran.
   No date has been set for North's trial.
   His three co-defendants, former national security adviser John M.
Poindexter and arms dealers Albert Hakim and retired Air Force Maj.
Gen. Richard V. Secord, each have been granted separate trials.

<HEAD>`Fathers' of Soviet, American A-Bombs Disagree on Star Wars</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LAWRENCE L. KNUTSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An unprecedented joint appearance by two men
frequently described as the respective ``fathers'' of the Soviet and
American hydrogen bombs featured sharp disagreement on whether
space-based defenses would bring world harmony or nuclear war.
   Andrei Sakharov, the Soviet scientist who has become his nation's
foremost human rights activist, said deploying such a defense system
would ``destabilize the world'' and could trigger nuclear war
between the superpowers.
   Edward Teller, one of the principal American advocates of
deploying the Star Wars defense system, said it could lead to a
``world neighborhood'' of cooperation and peace.
   The two scientists aired their views Wednesday evening at a
banquet honoring Teller as a pioneer in the field of nuclear physics
and for his advocacy of the Strategic Defense Initiative, SDI. It
was sponsored by the Ethics and Public Policy Center, a conservative
research group.
   Sakharov, 67, winner of the Nobel and Albert Einstein peace
prizes, attended the dinner as part of his first trip outside his
native land. He and Teller held a private 20-minute conversation,
the first time the two had met.
   In a speech at the beginning of the banquet, Sakharov praised
Teller as a man of principle and conviction but said deploying the
Strategic Defense Initiative, as the Star Wars plan is formally
known, would be ``a great error.''
   ``I feel it would destabilize the world,'' Sakharov said.
   He cited the ``enormous cost'' involved in paying for the
deployment of a defense system by the United States and for the
Soviet Union to field new offensive weapons to defeat it.
   ``If such systems are deployed ... there would be a temptation to
destroy them'' before they were armed, Sakharov said. ``And this in
itself could trigger a nuclear war.''
   Short of actual war, Sakharov said, SDI is an obstacle to better
relations between the two superpowers.
   ``SDI is one of the problems that stands in the way of achieving
really deep and profound arms control,'' he said.
   Soviet objections to SDI have been a central obstacle to
superpower negotiations in Geneva on cutting long-range nuclear arms
by up to 50 percent.
   Teller, responding at the banquet's end and after Sakharov had
departed, called Sakharov ``a great man'' who shares with the world
a desire for peace.
   ``Andrei Sakharov argued for the rights of individuals, argued
for freedom in an incredibly courageous manner, and he won,'' Teller
said of Sakharov's long human rights battle against the Soviet
system.
   But he said that as a physicist, Sakharov is out of touch with
the technological advances of recent decades, including advances in
the Soviet Union which Teller said is closer to deploying a
space-based defense system than is the United States.
   ``My argument has been that we must know what can be known, we
must find out'' whether a defense system will work, he said,
including ``lasers that move with the speed of light.''
   ``I have enjoyed the possibility to work on all these things,''
he said. ``Andrei Sakharov has not.''
   ``Technology has made out of the world a small neighborhood,'' he
said. ``Self defense is of interest to everybody.''
   Both men noted that their early careers in nuclear physics had
followed parallel paths.
   Sakharov said that at the time he was working on the Soviet
hydrogen bomb he and his colleagues believed that it was ``necessary
for the peace of the world to do such terrible things.''
   ``The world has now entered a new era and I am convinced a new
approach is necessary,'' he said.
   While he and Teller disagree, Sakharov said that through such
dialogues their countries ``will at least understand each other's
point of view and be able to talk instead of creating a situation of
confrontation.''

<HEAD>Study Finds Young Adults at Highest Risk of Weight Gain</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DANIEL Q. HANEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Americans face the highest risk of weight gain
during their 20s and 30s, when they put on an average of seven
pounds a decade, a study shows.
   However, by age 55, people tend to stop putting on weight and
begin losing it.
   Researchers said their study, based on a nationwide survey of
almost 10,000 adults, is the first to calculate the risk of getting
fat.
   ``Younger adults are at greatest risk of gaining substantial
amounts of weight during adulthood,'' said Dr. David F. Williamson.
``A greater effort has to be applied to preventing obesity early in
adulthood, possibly before age 25.''
   The study found that men and women between ages 25 and 34 are
likely to gain an average of seven pounds over the next 10 years.
However, about 6 percent of the people in this age group will gain
nearly 30 pounds in the next decade.
   The tendency to gain weight does not affect the sexes equally. An
average American man puts on an extra six pounds between his 25th
and 35th birthdays, but a woman gains almost eight pounds.
   The figures, analyzed by experts at the U.S. Centers for Disease
Control, were released Wednesday at the annual meeting of the
American Heart Association.
   Among other findings:
   _On average, people under age 55 tend to gain weight over time,
while those over 55 tend to lose it.
   _Up to the age of 55, women gain more weight then men, while
after 55 women lost more.
   _At all ages, women are twice as likely as men to have very large
weight gains.
   _Among people who were not overweight when the study began, those
aged 35 to 44 had the greatest risk of becoming overweight, while
those 65 and above had the lowest risk.
   Williamson said it is not clear from the results whether
Americans' risk of gaining weight is actually increasing.
   ``As a nation, we are still too fat,'' he said. ``But I don't
know if we are getting fatter or leaner.''
   The study was based on an initial survey of 14,407 U.S. adults
between 1971 and 1975. Researchers contacted 9,897 of these people a
decade later and weighed them again.
   Too much weight is clearly a health hazard. Other research shows
that men may double their risk of heart disease if they are 30
percent above the weights recommended in the 1959 Metropolitan Life
Insurance weight tables. This much excess weight for women increases
risk by 22 percent.
   Williamson said weight gain is often so gradual that people fail
to realize what's happening until they are already significantly
overweight.
   He, like many diet experts, recommends keeping weight off rather
than trying to lose it once the extra pounds have been gained.
   ``Walking 45 minutes a day, as well as reducing the amount of fat
in the diet, are effective ways of keeping weight under control,''
he said.

   Here, at a glance, are the main developments in
President-elect George Bush's preparations for taking over as chief
executive:
   _A team of 13 people, mostly campaign workers with experience in
the Reagan adminstration, has been assembled to direct Bush's
transition office. The task at hand is to chose people for about
5,000 political jobs open in 1989 as well as developing policies for
Bush. The team is co-directed by Craig Fuller and Robert Teeter, who
were appointed by Bush the day after his election Nov. 8.
   _Teeter said the president-elect would review candidates today
for two or three Cabinet positions. He did not say which ones and
would not discuss any names.
   _Bush meets British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher today over
breakfast. The two held private talks on Wednesday, and Bush also
met with Soviet dissident Andrei Sakharov.
   _The president-elect said ``no final decision'' had been made on
chosing a White House chief of staff, but sources close to Bush said
he had picked retiring New Hampshire Gov. John Sununu. At a news
conference in Concord, Sununu said he had discussed the job with
Bush but would not confirm his selection.
   _The New York office of the Anti-Defamation League of B'nai
B'rith said it was concerned about Sununu getting the White House
job because he was the only governor who refused to endorse a
proclamation attacking a 1975 U.N. resolution that equated zionism
with racism.
   Sununu, who is Arab-American, told reporters he did not endorse
the proclamation because it would have been ``inappropriate for a
governor to try to issue something that would have as its focus an
attempt to influence foreign policy.''
   _All of the staff and volunteers involved in Bush's takeover of

   A committee of The Society of Professional
Journalists, Sigma Delta Chi's national convention on Wednesday
nominated three distinguished journalists as fellows of the society
_ its highest form of recognition.
   Delegates to the national convention were to vote Thursday on
approving the nominees: John Quinn, senior vice president-news for
Gannett Co. Inc. and editor-in-chief of the company's USA Today
national newspaper; Ellen Goodman, columnist and associate editor of
The Boston Globe, and Louis D. Boccardi, president and general
manager of The Associated Press.
   The recognition is given for professional performance and for
contributions to public understanding of major social and political
issues.
   Quinn, also a director of Gannett, is responsible for working
with editors and publishers of Gannett's 90 daily newspapers and
with executives of its eight television and 16 radio stations to
develop news talent, resources and enterprise necessary for
comprehensive news coverage.
   Quinn's leadership positions in the news industry include service
as president of the Associated Press Managing Editors in 1972-73 and
as president of the American Society of Newspaper Editors in
1982-83. He has also been a Pulitzer Prize juror and is a past
president of the New England chapter of SPJ,SDX.
   Ms. Goodman has been with The Boston Globe since 1967. Her
syndicated column, for which she won a Pulitzer Prize in 1980,
appears in more than 400 newspapers. The column first appeared in
1971 in the Globe's Living section and was syndicated by the
Washington Post Writers Group in 1976.
   In May, Ms. Goodman was awarded the Hubert H. Humphrey Civil
Rights Award by the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights for
dedication to the cause of equality. She became associate editor of
the Globe in 1987.
   Boccardi was honored for playing a leading role in the journalism
industry's efforts to deal with First Amendment issues and problems
of readership and credibility. He has been with the AP since 1967,
after eight years of service on New York City newspapers, and became
chief executive of the worldwide news cooperative in 1985.
   Boccardi has served twice as a Pulitzer Prize juror and as a
member of the readership project and research and marketing
committee of the American Newspaper Publishers Association. He is a
member of advisory boards of the Media and Society seminars, the
Gannett Center for Media Studies, the Center for International
Journalism at the University of Southern California and the Center
for Communications.

<HEAD>Reckless Drivers, Bad Roads Push Traffic Deaths Toward U.S. Figure</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KAREN GILMOUR</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soviet drivers are so reckless and roads are so bad
that the annual Soviet traffic death toll is almost as high as in
the United States, which has 10 times as many cars, the Communist
Party daily said.
   About 40,000 people are killed in traffic accidents each year in
the Soviet Union, Pravda said Wednesday.
   ``There is a lack of elementary ethics on the road, with drivers
behaving rudely and without any respect towards each other,'' the
paper. ``The Soviet road and high speed are not compatible.''
   The 1986 traffic death toll in the United States was 47,900,
according to the 1988 World Almanac.
   Pravda said in an article Oct. 30 that the Soviet Union has about
50 cars per 1,000 people, compared to 560 per 1,000 in the United
States.
   Pedestrians account for about 13,000 of the annual Soviet traffic
deaths, more than the combined total of the United States, Britain,
France and West Germany, the paper said.
   It said 13 out of every 100 people injured in Soviet car
accidents die, compared to 1.3 percent in the United States.
   Driving can be notoriously challenging in Moscow, whose main
roads are clogged with trucks that spew clouds of black smoke and
often break down in the middle of the streets.
   Foreign visitors complain that Muscovites pay no attention to
normal traffic guidelines, such as painted lane lines.
   ``You can expect to have your car kissed,'' said one British
driver. He said Soviet drivers seem to consider it a point of honor
to nearly sideswipe automobiles they pass.
   Soviet drivers rarely use the turn signal and seem to regard it
as a tip-off to other drivers who may try to foil their maneuver.
   Pravda said rudeness was the motivation for drivers ``overtaking
slower moving cars or simply refusing to give up the particular lane
their cars occupy.''
   Traffic police, who stand at intersections and in the middle of
major streets rain or shine, are disrespectful to drivers and don't
help matters, Pravda said.
   Drivers cannot get a license without a six-month course, but once
they receive it, it's theirs for life unless it is revoked for
repeated traffic regulation violations. There is no program for
license renewal or periodic testing.
   Roads also are under severe climatic stress from severe cold in
winter to relative warm in winter.
   The temperature extremes, combined with the weight of thousands
of military and government trucks that rumble over the roads daily,
often cause huge potholes.
   ``Urgent measures, including a special national program, should
be taken to combat accidents on Soviet roads,'' Pravda said.
   ``It's time that programs for teaching driving should be changed
and instead of studying parts of the car and spending considerable
time on it, it could be more useful if the actual driving and
traffic rules are studied more thoroughly,'' it said.

<TEXT>
   The dollar plunged against the yen Thursday, and
share prices rose on the Tokyo Stock Exchange.
   Despited the reported dollar-buying intervention by the Bank of
Japan, the dollar closed lower at 121.52 yen, down 2.02 yen from
Wednesday's close of 123.54 yen. Opening at 122.40 yen, the currency
kept declining while moving in a range of 121.30-122.40 yen.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues, which gained
166.71 points the previous day, gained 80.69 more points, or 0.28
percent, to finish at 29,076.81, a record high.
   The dollar's bearishness is due partly to insufficient monetary
action by the U.S. Federal Reserve Board to back the currency, said
Sumitomo Bank's Sumio Fukushima. He said the dollar fell sharply
when speculative investors began selling dollars all at once.
   Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa said Thursday morning that the
dollar should recover because the U.S. trade deficit for September
narrowed. He also called for joint action by monetary authorities to
prop up the sagging dollar, a Finance Ministry official said on
condition of anonymity.
   On Wednesday, U.S. Commerce Department reported the nation's
trade deficit for September dropped to $10.5 billion from the
previous month's $12.3 billion.

   Benazir Bhutto claimed victory
Thursday after partial returns showed her populist party leading in
Pakistan's first open National Assembly elections in more than a
decade.
   With 165 of 205 districts reporting, Ms. Bhutto's Pakistan
People's Party had 76 seats in the National Assembly; its main
rival, the right-wing Islamic Democratic Alliance, had 39; and the
remaining 46 went to independent and minor parties.
   The nine-party Islamic Democratic Alliance includes loyalists of
President Mohammed Zia ul-Haq, the military president who died in a
plane crash three months ago.
   If her party wins a majority in the Assembly, Ms. Bhutto would
likely be named prime minister, becoming the first woman to lead
this Islamic nation. Without a majority, the party will be forced to
forge a governing coalition.
   ``The victory the PPP achieved is because of the selfless
sacrifices, the struggle by people of the PPP,'' Ms. Bhutto told the
news conference after a rally of about 8,000 people on the lawn of
her family home in the southern city of Larkana.
   The crowd chanted ``Long Live Benazir!'' and ``Benazir, prime
minister!''
   Former Prime Minister Mohammad Khan Junejo, one of Bhutto's main
rivals from the Islamic Alliance, conceded defeat late Wednesday in
his bid for an assembly seat.
   ``We're on the losing side,'' he said of his defeat by a Pakistan
People's Party candidate in his hometown of Sindhri. He said the
Bhutto party had ``succeeded very well'' nationally.
   The chairman of the Alliance, Ghulam Mustafa Jatoi, lost in both
districts he contested to Pakistan People's Party candidates.
   Under Pakistani rules, candidates may contest more than one seat
to improve their chance of election but must forfeit all but one.
The vacant seats are contested later in by-elections.
   The other main rival of Ms. Bhutto, chief minister Nawaz Sharif
of Punjab state, claimed victory in the race for an assembly seat in
Lahore, his hometown, but lost to a Pakistan People's Party member
in another district.
   Ms. Bhutto's father, Prime Minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, won the
last open election in 1977 by a landslide and prompted a coup by
Gen. Zia. Bhutto was convicted of complicity in a murder conspiracy
and hanged in 1979.
   About 48 million of Pakistan's 107 million people were eligible
to vote and unofficial estimates said slightly more than half voted.
Illiterate millions chose their candidates by symbol _ an arrow for
the Bhutto party, a bicycle for the Islamic Democratic Alliance and
other symbols such as a ladder, flower or ink pot for nearly 30
smaller parties.
   Men and women voted separately, in keeping with strict Moslem
practice.
   At stake were 205 of the 207 Moslem seats and 10 for non-Moslems
in the 237-member National Assembly. The remaining 20 seats are
reserved for women and will be filled later by vote of the assembly.
   Voting for two Moslem seats was postponed because of the death of
an elderly candidate in each district.
   On Saturday, Pakistanis vote to fill the 483 seats in Pakistan's
four provincial assemblies.
   Both major parties have said they would maintain the
long-standing friendship with the United States and continue support
for Moslem guerrillas fighting the communist government in
neighboring Afghanistan.
   Of more than 5 million Afghans who have fled during 10 years of
civil war, at least 3 million live in Pakistani border cities and
refugee camps that serve as bases and supply points for the
insurgents.
   Police and soldiers in armored vehicles patrolled several cities
Wednesday, especially in Sind, a southern province noted for ethnic
violence.
   Pakistan's constitution requires the president to choose the
person who will form the next government, presumably the leader of
the strongest party in the National Assembly.
   Ghulam Ishaq Khan, the interim president, will have no deadline
for the choice but the constitution the new assembly must convene
within 30 days and a new government must pass a confidence vote
within 60 days after that.
   Asked late Wednesday whether he would be reluctant to designate a
woman as head of government, Ishaq Khan replied: ``I think a woman
prime minister might be a good change.''
   Both the Pakistan People's Party, which Zulfikar Ali Bhutto
founded, and the Alliance have pledged to continue Zia's policy of
increasing the influence of Islam in the nation's life.
   Ms. Bhutto has said, however, that she would not allow the
religious policy to work against the rights of women or minorities.
   Zia ruled for eight years under martial law after the coup, then
held national elections in 1985 in which political parties were not
allowed to compete. Major opposition groups boycotted the elections,
including Ms. Bhutto and her supporters.
   In May, Zia dismissed Junejo's government and dissolved the
National Assembly, alleging corruption, incompetence and delay in
applying Islamic law.
   He called this election before the Aug. 17 plane crash that
killed him, the U.S. ambassador and 28 other people.

   Warning that Latin American drug lords pose a
more ``immediate and effective'' national security threat than
communism, the head of a Senate narcotics panel says the Bush
administration must make military aid available to drug-fighting
nations.
   Sen. John F. Kerry, D-Mass., also recommended sweeping economic
aid to help Latin countries, similar to the Marshall Plan used to
help Western Europe following World War II.
   ```Just Say No' is just not enough. It just hasn't worked.''
Kerry said Wednesday night. ``The drug cartels do represent a
national security threat to the United States and our friends and
allies abroad. The sooner we understand this fact of life, the
sooner we can begin waging a serious war on drugs,''
   Kerry, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations subcommittee on
narcotics, terrorism and international operations, said the new
administration must focus its national security initiatives on the
narcotics trade.

   The Reagan administration's refusal to protect
U.S. auto parts makers from ``unfair and illegal'' Canadian trading
policies will skew that economic sector to Canada's benefit,
Michigan Gov. James Blanchard says.
   U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter on Wednesday rejected
the Michigan governor's petition to declare a Canadian duty-rebate
program to be an unfair trading practice.
   Blanchard said that decision will allow ``illegal practices to
fully develop, distorting employment, trade and investment to the
benefit of Canada.''
   Canada gives duty rebates on autos to foreign manufacturers in
return for the use of Canadian parts in their cars, which Yeutter
said is permitted in a massive free-trade agreement between Canada
and the U.S. that has already been approved by the Congress.

   For the final state dinner of their eight-year
White House reign, President Reagan and his wife Nancy hosted a
glittering night of nostalgic song and dance to honor their
conservative friend, British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher.
   Breaking protocol, the Thatchers dallied Wednesday after the
evening's entertainment and took a turn with the Reagans about the
marbled Grand Foyer to the tune of ``Shall We Dance?''
   Usually, the honored guests depart posthaste, but the Thatchers
and the Reagans even switched partners as they smiled for the
cameras.
   ``I wanted this to be special _ it's very sentimental,'' said
Mrs. Reagan, who said she got ``a little teary'' during the effusive
round of toasts that the president and prime minister offered each
other earlier in the evening.
   The president, asked about his ``last dance'' with his first
lady, quipped, ``You don't mean that Nancy and I are breaking up, do
you?''
   With their 55th state dinner, the Reagans closed the book on one
of their favorite White House events. Their elaborate celebrations
recalled a tradition of glitz and glamour dating to the first White
House social event, when John Adams greeted New Years Day revelers
in 1801.
   Although many presidents made the White House a stage for some of
the nation's most elaborate and exclusive entertainment, the Reagans
brought a Hollywood party style to an executive mansion shorn of
hard liquor and dancing during the Carter years.
   And so it was Wednesday evening, when pianist Michael Feinstein
entertained with tunes ranging from Mrs. Reagan's favorite, ``Our
Love Is Here to Stay,'' to ``I'll Be Seeing You,'' a tune played at
the first state dinner honoring Mrs. Thatcher on Feb. 26, 1981, a
month after Reagan took office.
   The black-tie tribute to Mrs. Thatcher and her husband Denis was
an apt finale to a glittering series in which Reagan, now 77, never
seemed to tire.
   As he has on every such evening, the president regaled his guests
with anecdotes, both at the dinner table and among the
demitasse-sipping guests in the Blue Room.
   Even Mrs. Thatcher was caught up in the wave of nostalgia. Her
parting gift to the Reagans was a leather photograph album
containing nine black and white photographs from the president's
1949 movie ``The Hasty Heart,'' which he filmed in Britain.
   In the toasts, superlatives were the order of the night.
   ``She is a leader with the vision and the courage to stay the
course until the battles are won,'' Reagan said of his guest. Even
though his voice was raspy, the president pressed on to say, ``The
impact of Mrs. Thatcher's leadership at home and abroad secures her
place in history.
   ``As I prepare to depart this office in January, I take
considerable satisfaction in the knowledge that Margaret Thatcher
will still reside at No. 10 Downing Street.''
   The prime minister praised Reagan as ``more than a staunch ally
and counselor. You have also been a wonderful friend to me and our
country.''
   Mrs. Thatcher saluted as well the first lady, whose ``charm,
dignity and quiet but sure courage have won the hearts of millions.''
   She also said she wanted to ``warmly congratulate'' Vice
President Bush and his wife Barbara on his recent election, adding
that she looked forward ``to working with you as a true and trusted
friend.''
   Noticeably absent was Vice President-elect Dan Quayle, who wasn't
invited. When his absence from the guest list was noted earlier this
week, White House aides said he had been to a state dinner in 1982
as a senator.
   Members of Congress on the guest list included Reps. Trent Lott,
R-Miss., Dick Cheney, R-Wyo., and Tom Foley, D-Wash., as well as
Sens. Mark Hatfield, R-Ore., and Ted Stevens, R-Ala.
   Also present were American Ballet Theatre artistic director
Mikhail Baryshnikov, Discovery space shuttle commander Frederick
Hauck, Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher Orel Hershiser, actor Tom
Selleck, New York City Opera general director Beverley Sills, and
author Tom Wolfe.
   For the evening, the State Dining Room was turned into a garden
of peach roses, with a topiary tree composed of more than 100
full-bloomed flowers perched atop each of the 13 tables. More roses
were scattered in bouquets about the candlelit room.
   Some 120 guests dined on the famed $200,000 ivory, red and gold
Reagan china, using vermeil flatware and unadorned crystal goblets.
They sat at tables covered in peach linen and dabbed their spills
with white damask napkins adorned with the presidential seal.
   According to the first lady's press office, the guests were
served: baby lobster bellevue, caviar yogurt sauce and curried
croissant; roasted saddle of veal perigourdine; jardiniere of
vegetables; asparagus with hazel nut butter; autumn mixed salad and
a selection of cheeses; and chestnut marquise with pistachio sauce,
orange tuiles and ginger twigs.
   That was washed down with a Saintsbury Chardonnay Reserve 1987;
Stag's Leap Cabernet Sauvignon 1978 and Schramsberg Crement Demi Sec
1984.

   She appeared to be a grandmotherly
landlady who took in the homeless, but court records show the woman
arrested in the deaths of seven tenants was a dangerous eccentric
who preyed on the ill and elderly for years.
   The records indicate that 59-year-old Dorothea Montalvo Puente,
who was arrested late Wednesday in downtown Los Angeles after a
five-day search, could be kind and generous one moment and cunning
and cruel the next.
   Puente had not been seen since Saturday, when police allowed her
to walk away from her Victorian rooming house after the first of
seven bodies was unearthed in the yard.
   Her estranged daughter, Linda Bloom of South Pasadena, described
her as ``shy, withdrawn and reserved'' with ``no real personality.''
Doctors discovered she may have a penchant for poisoning as far back
as 1980, according to a probation report.
   Police believe Puente killed tenants to collect their Social
Security benefits. They have a list of two dozen people who are
missing and who might have lived at Puente's eight-bedroom house at
one time or another.
   One former tenant, Homer Myers, told reporters Wednesday that he
and other tenants unknowingly helped Puente dispose of the bodies by
digging the makeshift graves.
   Myers, 74, said Puente first asked him to dig a hole in the back
yard for an apricot tree.
   ``She said she had contacted a nursery and they told her she
needed a hole that was 4 feet by 4 feet and 5 feet deep. I thought
that was a little deep. Now I know why.''
   Court documents, including a record of her first conviction for
forging checks in 1948, paint the picture of a conniving,
manipulative woman who can concoct a story for any occasion.
   Puente herself, in letters to a judge preparing to sentence her
on unrelated charges in 1982, described her life as plagued with
hardship, four failed marriages, abuse and the responsibility of
supporting some of her numerous brothers and sisters.
   In the court documents, most of which were filed in connection
with search or arrest warrants, Puente claimed to be of Mexican
descent, the youngest of 18 children. However, San Bernardino County
recorded her birth as Dorothea Helen Gray, on Jan. 19, 1929, in
Redlands, to Jessie Gray, an ex-serviceman, and Trudy Yates, a
housewife.
   The first complaints that Puente may have been involved in
poisoning came in early 1980, when doctors at University Medical
Center in Sacramento conducted a toxicology test on an emergency
room patient, 79-year-old Esther Busby.
   Busby's physician, Dr. Jerome Lackner, recalled that he first
suspected Puente, his patient's live-in companion, of poisoning
Busby with overdoses of a heart medication he had prescribed.
   Lackner notified officials of the county Adult Protective
Services agency ``that Puente was poisoning or making Busby sick by
overmedicating her, and that I suspected that she was ripping Mrs.
Busby off.''
   ``They were able to check, and found out that Mrs. Busby's
(Social Security) check had been cashed and that the endorsement was
a forgery,'' he said. ``I told Esther what was going on, and she got
rid of Puente.''
   That occurrence and a similar one led to a warning to all
Sacramento hospitals about Puente, a criminal investigation by
county authorities, and Puente's 1982 arrest on charges of forgery,
grand theft and ``administering stupefying drugs.''
   While in custody, Puente claimed that all her surviving brothers
and sisters in Mexico depended on her for financial support.
   ``When I was 3 years old, I had to start picking cotton,
potatoes, cucumbers, chilies, then fruits,'' Puente wrote in one of
two letters to Sacramento Superior Court Judge Roger Warren. ``I
finally married when I was 13, he died after a few days.''
   Puente told the judge in one of the letters that she remarried
after her first husband died. That marriage ended in divorce after
18 years, and she later married ``a Mr. Montalvo,'' who she claimed
beat her and stabbed her between the eyes.
   ``It was (during) this time I started writing checks,'' she said.
``I just wanted you to know I'm not a street bum. All my problems
started when I married Mr. Montalvo.''

<TEXT>
   Benazir Bhutto of Pakistan is following
the traditional route to power by women politicians in the Asian
subcontinent.
   She capitalized on family ties and played on the emotions of
crowds who remembered her executed father, Prime Minister Zulfikar
Ali Bhutto.
   But an iron will behind the tears served her well in her foray
into the male-dominated political arena in a region where most women
have yet to achieve economic, educational and professional parity.
   Like the daughters and widows of fallen leaders in India,
Bangladesh and Sri Lanka, she is a savvy, charismatic, intelligent
student of politics who graduated into leadership ranks in her own
right.
   The most famous _ and the one who left the deepest mark on her
own nation and on the world _ was Indira Gandhi of India.
   Mrs. Gandhi was considered a pliable young lady and the ideal
compromise candidate when the squabbling cronies of her late father,
Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru, had to anoint a new leader of
India's dominant Congress Party.
   She proved to be anything but pliable.
   Mrs. Gandhi governed India as prime minister from 1966 to 1977,
turning a country where bullock carts and bicycles are major means
of transportation into a nuclear power and a mighty military force.
   Her increasingly authoritarian measures handed her a crushing
election defeat after her first 11 years in power, but she bounced
back into office in 1980 with a resounding comeback victory.
   She governed another four years until she was assassinated by her
Sikh bodyguards in revenge for the army raid she had ordered to
flush out gunmen holed up the Sikh faith's holiest shrine, the
Golden Temple in Amritsar.
   The first woman political leader in the Asian subcontinent was
Sirimavo Bandaranaike of Sri Lanka. Her husband, Prime Minister
S.W.R.D. Bandaranaike, was assassinated by a Buddhist monk in 1959.
   The following year, with his Sri Lanka Freedom Party in a
shambles, the male politicians turned to his widow as the person
most capable of restoring unity.
   Mrs. Bandaranaike governed from 1960 to 1965 and again from 1970
to 1977, when voters rebelled against her stringent economic
controls. But she has rebounded again and is now the leading
opposition candidate in the presidential election set for Dec. 19.
   In Bangladesh, women have not captured the top office. But the
two strongest opposition leaders are women: Sheik Hasina of the
Awami League and Khaleda Zia of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party.
   Hasina is the daughter of Sheik Mujibur Rahman, the prime
minister who was assassinated in a coup in 1975. Mrs. Zia is the
widow of another assassinated prime minister, Ziaur Rahman, who died
in a 1981 coup.
   All the women leaders have invoked the memories and the
popularity, as they perceive it, of their fathers and husbands. But
none has done it as eloquently as Benazir Bhutto.
   In the opening chapter of her recently published autobiography,
``Daughter of the East,'' she recounts the moment of her father's
execution, which was sanctioned by the man who overthrew him,
Mohammed Zia ul-Haq:
   ``They killed my father in the early morning hours of April 4,
1979, inside Rawalpindi Central Jail. Imprisoned with my mother a
few miles away in a deserted police training camp at Sihala, I felt
the moment of my father's death.
   ``I suddenly sat bolt-upright in bed at 2 a.m. `No!' the scream
burst through the knots in my throat. `No!' I couldn't breathe,
didn't want to breathe. `Papa, Papa!' I felt so cold.''
   And then she resolved to avenge his death, in her oft-repeated
campaign words, by ``restoring democracy in Pakistan.''

   Benazir Bhutto once recalled a day
nearly a decade ago when she visited her father in jail as he
awaited execution by the military regime that had toppled his
civilian government.
   ``I told him on my oath in his death cell, I would carry on his
work,'' Ms. Bhutto said.
   Her father, former Prime Minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, was hanged
in a Rawalpindi prison in 1979, two years after being convicted in a
murder conspiracy. Gen. Mohammad Zia ul-Haq, who led the coup that
unseated Bhutto, turned down international pleas for sparing him.
   Today, three months after Zia died in a plane crash, Ms. Bhutto
claimed victory in national elections and is likely to become the
first woman prime minister of a modern Moslem nation.
   She is the undisputed star of Pakistani politics as head of the
populist Pakistan People's Party founded by her father.
   The charismatic 35-year-old Ms. Bhutto inherited the grass-roots
following that brought her father to power in the 1970s. In speech
after speech to adoring crowds, she has promised a better life to
the poor rural masses that form the core of this Islamic nation.
   Ms. Bhutto was groomed for politics, studying by the side of her
father, then focusing on politics and government while at Harvard
and Oxford.
   Her first taste of political success came at the British
university, where she was elected president of the Oxford Union
Society in 1976.
   Ms. Bhutto returned to Pakistan in early 1977 to take up a job in
the foreign office. The job was short-lived, however, as Zia toppled
Bhutto's government a few months later.
   Her father was accused of conspiring to murder a political
opponent and was sentenced to death. Ms. Bhutto turned to denouncing
Zia after her struggle to have her father reprieved failed. She
wound up in jail or under house arrest for five years.
   Not until a serious ear infection required treatment did Zia
allow her release in 1984 to go to England in self-exile.
   Ms. Bhutto returned triumphantly to Pakistan in April 1986, four
months after Zia announced an end to eight years of military rule.
She drew huge crowds as she toured the nation demanding democracy.
   Ecstatic crowds numbering in the hundreds of thousands would
chant her name and wait for hours for a glimpse of her.
   The stunning comeback led to inevitable comparisons with Corazon
Aquino of the Philippines, who became president after a popular and
military uprising against Ferdinand Marcos.
   But Zia steadfastly refused to allow elections contested by
political parties. In the meantime, Ms. Bhutto surprised many
observers by agreeing to an arranged marriage last December with
Karachi businessman Asif Ali Zardari that followed strict Islamic
tradition.
   Six months later, Zia fired his civilian government. In July, he
set Nov. 16 as the date for new elections.
   There was considerable speculation that Zia, who died in an Aug.
17 plane crash, chose the date because he knew Ms. Bhutto was
pregnant with her first child and hoped to keep her off the campaign
trail.
   But the elections came two months after Ms. Bhutto gave birth to
a son, Bilawal, giving her time to make whirlwind campaign tours
throughout the country after a brief bout with a kidney infection.
   In public, Ms. Bhutto is mindful of local custom and Islamic
morality, appearing with her head covered and wearing the baggy
Shalwar Kameez favored by most Pakistani women. But she is clearly
Westernized and is as comfortable speaking English as Urdu.
   Poised and articulate, she has captivated massive crowds almost
everywhere she travels in Pakistan. In early November, she mounted a
38-hour, 31-stop railway tour aboard the green-and-yellow ``Khyber
Mail'' train that wound its way 1,000 miles through the country's
hinterland.
   Her voice deteriorated into a barely audible rasp as she preached
the Bhutto message handed down by her late father: democracy and
prosperity to the poor masses.

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Severe textbook shortages are undercutting
education in urban school districts nationwide because of higher
book prices, budgetary constraints and a tendency to cut books
before people, educators complain.
   ``One of the things about textbooks is they don't vote and they
don't go out on strike. If you cut personnel, you get screams of
anguish,'' said Harriet Tyson-Bernstein, author of ``A Conspiracy of
Good Intentions: America's Textbook Fiasco,'' a new book highly
critical of the textbook industry.
   A study of 31 schools in five urban districts by the
Washington-based Institute for Educational Leadership, released in
September, found an across-the-board lack of instructional
materials, including textbooks.
   ``In general, the resource situation is pretty bleak. The lack of
supplies in the school systems is pretty obvious,'' said Lisa
Walker, policy resource director for the private, non-profit think
tank. ``This is often an area of the budget where funding is cut.''
   But the textbook shortage compromises educational quality, some
principals contend. ``One of the teachers said it was like building
a house without any nails,'' said Walker.
   At Mather elementary school in a working-class Boston
neighborhood, the second grade doesn't have enough math textbooks,
the fourth grade needs social studies books and the sixth grade
lacks language texts. Health books are missing entirely in the
school of 550 students.
   Forced to pare its budget, the Boston School Department last
spring eliminated $1.3 million in funding for instructional
supplies, leaving $3.7 million for textbooks, paper, pencils and
other materials.
   ``It's one of the few variable costs you have in the School
Department,'' said Peter Rowe, deputy superintendent for planning
and business affairs for the 58,000-student system. Higher book
costs also have hurt.
   ``It was a choice when we came to it between things like
textbooks or librarians or nurses or athletic programs or field
trips,'' he said Wednesday.
   In the September study of schools in Detroit, Denver, New
Orleans, Indianapolis and Rochester, N.Y., 20 of the 31 schools
surveyed said they had ``serious problems'' with instructional
materials, and 19 said the level of resources was inadequate.
   ``We know that every kid can't have every book because that's
just not feasible,'' said James H. Daniels, an assistant
superintendent in Denver's 58,000-student district.
   ``It's always a problem. Resources change, books change and you
want to keep up to date and the money is not always there. What a
school has to do is some prioritizing.''
   In Boston, setting priorities has forced some schools to use more
photocopied material than usual _ 60,000 copies a month at Mather.
Many students aren't allowed to take textbooks home for fear they
will be lost or damaged. Teachers often spend money out of their own
paychecks for materials. Others go without and work at the
blackboard more.
   School officials also said some of the city's 7,000 bilingual
program students only have new reading textbooks in Spanish because
the city failed to order enough books in English. Students in the
Agassiz elementary school _ where textbooks never go home _ are
sharing readers, Principal Alfredo Nunez said.
   The textbook shortage in Boston comes despite a city survey of
parents three years ago that found instructional materials were the
No. 1 priority among 25 educational issues. Officials increased
funding for materials in response to the finding before the budget
constraints forced the cutbacks this year.
   National education lobbyists said cities should find other areas
to cut before slashing resources used directly by students.
   ``If we see education as an investment, then we will provide
those funds and won't have to make those cuts,'' said Gary Marx,
associate executive director of the American Association of School
Administrators in Arlington, Va.

<HEAD>Sudanese Rebels and Khartoum Political Party Sign Agreement</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sudanese rebels and a political
party in the country's coalition government have signed an agreement
calling for a constitutional conference next month to end the civil
war in Sudan's south.
   The agreement, signed Wednesday night in Addis Ababa, also calls
for a cease-fire in the 5{-year conflict, cancellation of Sudan's
defense pacts with other countries, suspension of harsh Islamic laws
and lifting the state of emergency.
   ``It is time for reason to prevail, high time to end the
fratricidal war,'' said Mohammed Osman El-Mirghani,
secretary-general of the Democratic Unionist Party, the second
largest in Prime Minister Sadiq el-Mahdi's coalition government.
   He said the agreement was backed by el-Mahdi and his Umma party,
Sudan's biggest. ``The Prime Minister telephoned last night and
fully expressed his support to the meeting,'' El-Mirghani said.
   But the National Islamic Party, the third coalition partner, has
expressed reservations, especially to suspending Islamic law and
lifting the state of emergency.
   The rebels took up arms against the Moslem-dominated Khartoum
government in 1983 to press for autonomy and social reform in the
predominantly Christian and animist south. The rebels claim to
control 95 percent of the southern countryside and small towns.
   Because of the war, a third of southern Sudan's 6 million
civilians have fled in search of a haven in northern Sudan and
neighboring Ethiopia.
   EL-Mirghani and John Garang, leader of the rebel Sudan People's
Liberation Army, spoke to reporters after three days' talks led to
Wednesday's agreement.
   Garang said that El-Mirghani's party and his movement ``have
broken the ice and the next step should be taken by the government.''
   In a joint communique, the two parties in Addis Ababa also urged
the international commmunity to provide relief to the war-torn
southern Sudan.
   Garang denied the SPLA has stopped relief organizations sending
humanitarian aid to the south. He said the rebels only insist that
relief officials work with the rebels' relief organization to ensure
no arms were disguised as humanitarian aid.

   The undersea exploration of a Roman
shipwreck will be witnessed by thousands of students via
``telepresence,'' an on-the-spot TV broadcast brought to them by the
discoverers of the wreck of the Titanic.
   Plans for the unprecedented educational project were unveiled
Wednesday by Robert Ballard, who led the team that found the sunken
Titanic in 1985.
   Students linked by satellite to at least nine science museums in
the United States and Canada will be able to communicate with
explorers directing an unmanned mobile camera as it combs the floor
of the Mediterranean Sea, Ballard said.
   While the $6 million, privately funded project involves several
advances in technology, Ballard said its main purpose is to excite
students about science, a field that he said has suffered dwindling
influence in America.
   ``We really have a crisis of education in the United States,''
Ballard said at a news conference at the Woods Hole Oceanographic
Institution. In recent years, he said, science has failed to provide
young people with attractive role models.
   The role models they have instead are ``that scientists are
nerds, or as my kids would say, dweebs, and dweebs sit at terminals
and are dropouts from society.''
   In the project, the underwater robot named Jason that helped
explore the Titanic will send high-quality television pictures via
cable to a ship thousands of feet above on the sea surface. For 14
days next May, the ship and its 50-member crew _ including six high
school students _ will control the movements of the robot and send
back satellite images from two underwater locations.
   The broadcasts will be transmitted via the Turner Broadcasting
System and Electronic Data Systems Corp. to science museums in
Boston, Chicago, Memphis, Tenn., Washington, D.C., Dallas,
Philadelphia, Rochester, N.Y., Charlotte, N.C., and Victoria,
British Columbia.
   In addition, the National Geographic Society plans to produce a
TV special on the expedition.
   The ship's crew will broadcast six programs a day, or a total of
84 40-minute programs, that will be seen by about 200,000 students.
   Instead of simply watching the programs, the students will have
before them a multiscreen ``control room'' that replicates the
control center on the mother ship above Jason. Students will be able
to ask questions of the crew, see images on a number of television
screens and, in some cases, even take over the controls of Jason,
Ballard said.
   Ballard called the concept ``telepresence.''
   The plan is for Jason to explore an undersea volcano field off
the west coast of Italy where minor eruptions, emissions of molten
minerals and an abundance of wildlife should be visible. At another
Mediterranean site, which Ballard declined to disclose, Jason will
photograph a vast debris field believed to be the remains of several
Roman shipwrecks from the second century.
   Ballard said the goals of the program, which he calls the ``Jason
Project,'' are both ambitious and basic. ``One of the major focuses
of the program is to teach people where the Mediterranean is,''
Ballard said.
   ``It's a tremendous interest-generator,'' said Frank Ireton of
the National Science Teachers Association, which is helping science
teachers who will take their classes to the programs.
   ``If we have 200,000 students and we interest 10 percent of them
in science, my gosh, that's a tremendous benefit,'' he said.

   Michael Dukakis basked in a warm
homecoming after his failed presidential bid, returning to the place
where he launched his career in public service 29 years ago:
Brookline High School.
   The occasion was the biannual Town Meeting Wednesday night in

grew up and still resides. Dukakis had been invited there to address
the meeting after his loss to Vice President George Bush.
   ``My commitment to the people, my commitment to democracy, my
commitment to communities, my commitment to this country began right
here in this auditorium as a Town Meeting member,'' said Dukakis
from the stage of the room where he served from 1959 to 1970 as a
member.
   About 250 people, including the 240 elected Town Meeting members,
gave him standing ovations at the start and finish of his 10-minute
speech.
   ``While I'm disappointed, and many of you share that
disappointment, I have to say it's good to be home,'' he said.

<HEAD>CIA Director Says Glasnost Doesn't Reduce Soviet Threat</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Mikhail Gorbachev's efforts to reform his
country have not fundamentally altered the relationship between the
Soviet Union and the United States, which is likely to remain
``essentially adversarial,'' says CIA director William H. Webster.
   But Gorbachev's policy of glasnost, or openness, has presented
the intelligence community with some very formidable challenges,
Webster told the Yale Political Union on Wednesday.
   While the CIA chief said the information explosion in the Soviet
Union is ``very welcome and very healthy,'' it also requires the
agency to determine ``what is real versus what Moscow wants us to
hear.''
   The Soviet Union's ``military capability, its efforts to increase
global influence and its aggressive intelligence activities are
still serious threats to United States interests. Gorbachev's
efforts to reform his country have not fundamentally altered these
truths,'' Webster said, adding that they arguably may make the
Soviets an even greater threat.
   Webster fielded questions from students after his speech and held
a news conference _ rare for a CIA chief.
   When asked by reporters if Soviet spying had decreased as a
result of Gorbachev's policy of openness, Webster answered, ``No.''
When asked if Soviet spying had increased, he responded,
``Possibly,'' adding that there is ``very intensive intelligence
work.'' He did not elaborate.
   Whatever arms control agreements the United States reaches with
the Soviet Union, he said in his speech, ``I believe that our
relationship is likely to remain essentially adversarial.''
   Webster said that while Gorbachev is an impressive leader, ``when
we watch the leadership, we also have to see what actual reforms are
being made in terms of military activity, aggressive intelligence
against the United States, improvements in civil rights and all the
things that are important to us. Here we are still waiting for
progress.''
   On the subject of the war on drugs, Webster said the role of
intelligence gathering in the battle has not been well-defined, but
that President-elect Bush is expected to change that.
   He said he believes drug interdiction is the most expensive and
least effective way to deal with the problem. The only real
solution, he said, lies in ``reduced demand coupled with a real
reduction in supply.''
   Asked by a student about his future as CIA chief under the Bush
administration, Webster said he had not yet been contacted by the
president-elect's transition team.
   Webster said the president-elect, a former chief of the agency,
had asked that he receive daily briefings from the CIA.
   Defending the use of covert action in furthering U.S. foreign
policy, Webster said that as an an alternative to military action,
``I think it is very important.''
   Covert action went awry in the Iran-Contra affair because trading
arms for hostages was not consistent with the country's overt
policy, Webster said.
   The CIA was not seen to be institutionally involved in the
Iran-Contra affair, Webster said, adding that the individuals who
violated agency rules were carrying out instructions from the
National Security Council.

<HEAD>Opposition Party Recognizes Salinas Presidency</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MEXICO CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The conservative National Action Party says it
has ended efforts to annul results of the July 6 election and will
now adopt the role of responsible democratic opposition to
President-elect Carlos Salinas de Gortari.
   The party said Wednesday that it still maintains Salinas, of the
governing Institutional Revolutionary Party, won in a fraudulent
election.
   Abel Vicencio Tovar, National Action's secretary general, called
on Salinas to begin his term Dec. 1 with ``a transition to a real
democracy.''
   In a statement, he said Salinas could ``legitimize himself'' by
``respecting the popular mandate of democratization, pluralism,
social justice and national sovereignty.''
   It was the first public acceptance of Salinas' victory by a major
Mexican opposition party.
   Manuel J. Clouthier, National Action's presidential candidate,
previously had called upon President Miguel de la Madrid to annul
the election results and appoint an interim president until a new
ballot could be held.
   Salinas won with slightly more than 50 percent of the vote, the
slimmest margin of victory in the governing party's 59-year history.
The party has not lost a presidential election since its founding in
1929.
   Cuauhtemoc Cardenas of the leftist National Democratic Front
coalition came in second with 31 percent and Clouthier finished
third with 17 percent, according to the Federal Election Commission.
   The National Action statement said the party had adopted a
position as ``a responsible democratic opposition.'' The statement
also called for a revision of Mexico's election code to ensure
fraud-free elections.

<HEAD>Tobacco-Chewing, 114-Year-Old Woman World's Oldest</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Retransmitting to fix paragraphing</NOTE>
<DATELINE>PALATKA, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Carrie White, a tobacco-chewing woman who
has been been institionalized since 1909, will be certified by the
Guinness Book of World Records as the world's oldest living person
on her 114th birthday Friday.
   Mrs. White, who was born in 1874 during the second term of
President Ulysses S. Grant and two years before Custer's last stand
at Little Big Horn, will celebrate her birthday with a cake
decorated with 114 candles and receive her formal world record
certificate from Guinness.
   Officials at the Putnam Memorial Nursing Center, where Mrs. White
lives, know very little about her. She has no living relatives and
has been under hospital care for 79 years.
   Marjorie Allen, Mrs. White's guardian since 1984, said she
learned four years ago that Mrs. White was at Florida State Hospital
in Chattahoochee and had been there since Nov. 19, 1909, the day
after her 35th birthday.
   Mrs. White was diagnosed when she was admitted to the hospital as
suffering from post-typhoid psychosis, though Mrs. Allen has no
clear record of an outbreak of typhoid fever at that time.
   Mrs. Allen learned the name of Mrs. White's mother, Sally Joiner,
from the commitment records at Florida State Hospital. Her father's
name was John.
   Her guardian arranged to have the woman moved to the Community
Convalescence Center in Gainesville, and she was transferred in 1986
to the nursing home in Palatka where Mrs. Allen's husband Paul is
administrator.
   Mrs. Allen said Mrs. White refuses to discuss the past.
   ``She will not go back. With Carrie, it is the now. I don't delve
into that very much. It's like she put up a steel wall,'' she said.
   Records show Mrs. White taught piano in Tallahassee and married
John White, who did some blacksmithing.
   Her daily routine at the nursing home is to have breakfast in bed
and then spend the day caring for her possessions, including dolls
and stuffed animals.
   She also likes to chew tobacco, preferring Red Man.
   ``You don't need teeth to chew tobacco, I guess,'' Mrs. Allen
said.
   Guinness based its decision to declare Mrs. White the oldest
living person on evidence from extensive medical and state records,
according to William Ihle, a spokesman for Beverly Enterprises,
which operates the nursing home.
   The 1989 Guinness Book of World Records, already published, lists
112-year-old Birdie May Vogt of Miami as the oldest living person.
Others have claimed the title, but Guinness said it requires
``adequate authentication.''

<HEAD>Storm Dumps Snow, Rain in the Northwest</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Snow and rain fell across the Pacific Northwest to the Rockies,
dropping up to a foot of snow on mountain peaks in Washington and
Oregon. High winds accompanying the storm knocked over trees in some
areas.
   In the East, there was also stormy weather, with showers and a
few thunderstorms scattered along a cold front from the Appalachians
to the Atlantic coast. Light snow was reported in the Dakotas and
upper Michigan.
   Winter storm warnings or snow advisories were posted for a wide
area of the West: the mountains of Washington and Oregon, where snow
fell heavily overnight; northeast California and the Sierra Nevadas
along with northwest and west-central Nevada; Sun Valley and the
southern mountains of Idaho, where up to 6 inches of snow was
expected; southwest and south-central Montana; western Wyoming; and
parts of Utah and Colorado.
   As of late Wednesday, a foot of snow had fallen at Crater Lake,
Ore.
   Strong winds accompanying the storm gusted between 60 and 80 mph
in the Reno-Carson City, Nev., area. Wind measuring up to 75 mph at
Verdi, Nev., blew down a poplar tree, and wind advisories were in
effect for southern Nevada and the mountains and deserts of southern
California.
   But there was no reported recurrence of tornadoes that struck
five Midwestern states Tuesday, killing seven people and damaging
scores of homes, cars and businesses.
   Temperatures around the nation at 2 a.m. EST ranged from one
below zero at Glasgow, Mont., to 79 degrees at Key West, Fla.
   Today's forecast called for widespread rain, turning to snow at
higher elevations, for much of California, the northern Pacific
coast and the northern and central parts of the inland West. In the
East, rain was expected in eastern New York and New England, while
in the Midwest, snowshowers were forecast for upper Michigan.
   High temperatures were forecast in the 30s and 40s over the Ohio
Valley, the Great Lakes, the northern Mississippi Valley, the
northern half of the Plains, the upper Missouri valley and the
Rockies to the northern Pacific coast. Florida expected highs in the
80s, with temperatures in the 70s across the Georgia and South
Carolina coasts, the central Gulf coast and the desert Southwest.
Other areas expected highs in the 50s and 60s.
   Other reports:
   _East: Atlanta 53 cloudy; Boston 60 foggy; Buffalo 43 windy;

<HEAD>Riot Police Battle Protesters Marching On U.S. Embassy</HEAD>

   Riot police fired volleys of tear gas
today to drive back thousands of farmers chanting ``Drive out the
Yankees'' as they tried to march on the U.S. Embassy to demand a
halt to American farm imports.
   Some 2,000 riot police in green combat fatigues and black,
visored helmets blocked 7,000 farmers and other protesters who tried
to get to the embassy in central Seoul.
   ``Drive out U.S. imperialists,'' and ``Oppose U.S. agricultural
products,'' protesters shouted as they marched to the beat of drums
and carried hundreds of red, white and yellow flags and placards
denouncing the United States.
   Hundreds of protesters hurled rocks and bricks at riot police and
attacked troopers with clubs after they were blocked a few hundred
yards from the embassy.
   Radical students who joined the march hurled a few firebombs at
police.
   Police fired tear gas and hurled back rocks tossed by protesters.
Some officers and protesters were seen being taken away with
injuries, but police had no figures on injuries or arrests.
   No protesters got close to the embassy. Marchers dispersed after
about 90 minutes of clashes confined mainly to one main street.
   Protesters claimed their farms were threatened by cheap food
imports, such as those from the United States. Many protesters wore
headbands saying, ``No U.S. wine and beef.''
   The United States has been pressuring South Korea to open its
markets to American imports, especially agricultural products, to
help correct Washington's $10 billion annual trade debt with Seoul.
   South Korea has made some concessions on American beef, wine and
other food imports. Angry farmers repeatedly have protested against
any import concessions, but the protest today was the most violent.
   The farmers' march turned violent when police stopped it just
before it passed the Seoul headquarters of Citibank, a U.S. bank.
Police repeatedly charged the rock-throwing protesters to drive them
back.
   Several thousand more riot police ringed the embassy and guarded
streets leading to the building. Police also protected nearby
residences of U.S. diplomats.
   The protesters also denounced former President Chun Doo-hwan and
demanded he be arrested for corruption and human rights abuses.
``Kill Chun Doo-hwan,'' some people in the crowd yelled.
   The farmers had rallied near the National Assembly building and
then marched peacefully the six miles to the embassy, shepherded by
columns of riot police. Many people watching cheered the protesters
and shouted encouragement. Large numbers of Koreans oppose imports.
   The rally became as much a protest against Chun as the United
States. Many Koreans are demanding the former president be punished
for alleged corruption and human rights abuses.
   Several of Chun's relatives and former associates have been
convicted or charged with corruption. The government is trying to
defuse the controversy by having Chun apologize to the nation and
return his personal wealth.
   Chun, a former general, who took power with military backing in
1980, is resisting demands he accept exile to the countryside in
disgrace. He insists he did nothing wrong personally during his
seven-year term that ended in February.

<HEAD>Researchers Chosen For Award That Often Foreshadows Nobel</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Two researchers who helped explain the chemical
origins of life, a doctor who developed methadone treatment for
heroin addicts and a U.S. senator have received the 1988 Albert
Lasker Awards.
   The Lasker Awards, announced Wednesday, have been given for 43
years and have often foreshadowed the awarding of Nobel Prizes.
Forty-six Lasker award winners have gone on to win Nobels.
   Thomas R. Cech of the University of Colorado, Boulder, and
Phillip A. Sharp, director of the Cancer Research Center at the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology, were awarded the Lasker Basic
Medical Research Award for their separate discoveries concerning the
workings of RNA, one of the genetic building blocks on which life
depends.
   The Lasker Clinical Medical Research Award went to Dr. Vincent P.
Dole of Rockefeller University in New York City for discoveries
concerning the physiological basis of drug addiction and the
development of methadone as an effective treatment.
   U.S. Sen. Lowell P. Weicker Jr., R-Conn., who was defeated in his
bid for re-election Nov. 8, was awarded the Lasker Public Service
Award for his defense of health care programs faced by crippling
budget cuts and for establishing new programs.
   Each Lasker award winner receives or shares a $15,000 honorarium.
   One of this year's winners of the Nobel Prize in medicine, Dr.
James W. Black, won a Lasker award in 1976.
   Cech, a biochemist, was cited for his discovery that RNA _ once
thought to be merely a kind of genetic messenger inside cells _
could rearrange itself to change the message.
   He also found that the RNA, or ribonucleic acid, has a
rudimentary ability to reproduce itself, suggesting that the first
living things might have arisen ultimately from RNA.
   Earlier, Sharp had reported that only part of RNA carried genetic
instructions to govern the operation of cells. Certain segments of
RNA, called introns, are deleted from RNA as it is processed, and
the remaining segments, called exons, contain the instructions.
   Dole began his studies of addiction in the 1960s. After obtaining
permission to study heroin addicts outside of prison, he examined
the symptoms of withdrawal and the nature of addiction.
   Ultimately, he found that methadone, a synthetic opiate developed
in Germany during World War II, could eliminate an addict's craving
for heroin without making the addict ``high.'' That allowed addicts
to hold jobs and resume normal lives.
   Weicker was cited, in part, ``for his compassion and dedication
in the fight to eradicate disease and disability through federal
funding of medical research and public health programs.''
   Among the beneficiaries of his legislative actions were disabled
children, the mentally ill, the elderly and people suffering from
cancer, Alzheimer's disease, arthritis and AIDS, the Lasker
Foundation said.

<DATELINE>MADRID, Spain (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. jazz trumpeter Miles Davis canceled six
concerts in Italy and the rest of his European tour after collapsing
at the end of a concert in Madrid, a newspaper reported today.
   Spain's leading daily El Pais quoted concert promoter Tito
Ramoneda as saying the 62-year-old Davis fainted and fell offstage
after his Tuesday performance at the Madrid Jazz Festival.
   A doctor who examined him in the Madrid sports palace said the
noted composer and bandleader suffered from arrhythmia, or irregular
heartbeat, the paper said.
   Davis, who has diabetes, received an injection of insulin and was
ordered to remain in bed in his hotel room in the Spanish capital,
the paper said.
   On Wednesday, Davis canceled a concert in Barcelona and a
six-date tour in Italy that was to begin in Reggio Emilia today, the
paper said.
   Romaneda told the paper Davis had told his promoters that he
wanted to end his months of almost daily concerts in different
European cities and return to the United States.
   Davis has been a major influence in jazz since the late 1940s.
The bands he led have been credited with developing the West Coast
``cool'' style of the 1950s, the modal approaches of the 1960s and
the jazz-rock fusion of the 1970s.
   His better known recordings include ``Birth of the Cool'' (1949),
``Kind of Blue'' (1959) and ``Bitches Brew'' (1969).
   In recent years, his records have been influenced by pop music.

<HEAD>Judge Orders Fan To Stay Away From Actress Sharon Gless</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A psychiatric patient who threatened to shoot
herself in front of actress Sharon Gless was ordered by a judge to
stay away from the co-star of the ``Cagney and Lacey'' television
series.
   Superior Court Judge Kurt Lewin issued a permanent restraining
order Wednesday that said Joni Leigh Penn must remain 200 yards away
from Miss Gless' family members and stay 1,000 yards away from the
actress' home and residences of her family members, said her
attorney and brother, Michael Gless.
   ``She's being treated for fan obsession,'' he said of Ms. Penn.
``Before, all the police could do was ask her not to trespass. Now
they can arrest her for violation of a court order.''
   Neither Miss Gless or Ms. Penn appeared in court.
   Miss Gless, who won two Emmy awards for her portrayal of
dedicated police officer Christine Cagney on the now-canceled CBS-TV
series, has received 20 letters from Ms. Penn, a self-described fan,
since Jan. 19.
   Ms. Penn threatened to shoot herself in front of the actress,
according to a letter submitted to the court by Ms. Penn's
psychiatrist, Hubert Nestor.
   Gless said Ms. Penn was a frequent fixture near the ``Cagney and
Lacey'' set, hovering outside studio doors at dawn to await Miss
Gless' arrival, then following the sound truck to the filming
location.
   On Oct. 25, Ms. Penn went to Miss Gless' home and told her
secretary she had a gun, attorneys said. Police were called, but Ms.
Penn left before they arrived.
   She later underwent psychiatric observation at an Orange County
facility, Gless said.

   If you're a Scrooge about Christmas you might want
to head for Denver, where it seems there's a Santa shortage.
   Ken Galey, director of the non-profit Rent-A-Santa program, says
that for the first time in the program's six-year history it is
short on recruits for the ho-ho-ho role.
   ``We have 10 and need 40,'' he said.
   The recruits undergo a week-long training program for duty
beginning right after Thanksgiving, Galey said. The program is part
of the the Mile High Child Care unit of United Way.
   The job pays $10 the first hour and $5 per hour after that, he
said. Costumes are supplied.
   ``Last year we did 375 assignments between Thanksgiving and
Christmas Eve and that was with about 28 Santas. This year we need
40 already,'' Galey said.
   ``I'm just thinking off the top of my head that because our
economy has been a bit in the doldrums, people aren't looking
forward to the Christmas holidays as early this year as they have in
past years,'' he said to explain the shortage of Santas in training.
   The program's Santas, which have ranged from truck drivers to
attorneys, see duty at private parties in homes, office parties,
shopping centers, day care centers and anywhere else that Christmas
parties are held for children.
   ``They are generally people who look forward to the holidays and
love playing the part of Santa and have a good time doing it. It
wouldn't be Christmas for them if they didn't have a chance to play
Santa Claus,'' he said.

   A name game has the residents of a Virginia
county and this Georgia city all in a stew.
   Both Brunswick County, Va., and Brunswick, Ga., claim to be the
home of Brunswick stew, a tasty concoction of smoked meat, chicken,
corn, baby lima beans, tomatoes, onions, secret ingredients and
assorted seasonings.
   Georgian's traditionally cook their Brunswick stew in black iron
wash pots over an open fire, which gives the stew a distinctive,
smoky flavor.
   Virginians cook theirs in large stainless-steel kettles similar
to those used in military mess kitchens.
   In February, the Georgia Legislature and Virginia's House of
Representatives each passed resolutions declaring its state the
stew's ``official'' birthplace. On Saturday, there will be a second
attempt to settle the issue with a cook-off, this time in Georgia.
   Virginians won a similar competition in Virginia last year that
featured judges from that state, according to Phyllis Taunton, one
of the sponsors. She said Georgians will claim the title this year,
which is being judged by locals.
   ``Naturally, Georgia lost that competition,'' Mrs. Taunton said.
``But I'm confident we'll regain the national Brunswick stew title
this Saturday at high noon, when the judges announce their
decision.''
   Nonetheless, more than 50 Virginians are expected. They say they
are bringing a new, $5,000 stainless-steel stew kettle to compete in
the contest.

<HEAD>Study Shows Cocaine Users Now Abusing Tranquilizers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JENNIFER McNULTY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A dramatic increase in tranquilizer use by
cocaine abusers is worrying counselors nationwide, who fear the
double dangers of dual addictions.
   Tranquilizers like Valium, used to ease the ``crash'' of a
cocaine high by calming nerves and relieving paranoia, are becoming
a second drug of choice among cocaine users, according to a study
released Wednesday by the city's Haight Ashbury Free Clinic.
   But cocaine users, particularly those who smoke the potent form
known as crack, take tranquilizers in such quantity that the effects
are reversed and users often become more agitated, unpredictable and
violent, said David Smith, the clinic's founder and medical director.
   The ``dual-drug'' phenomenon parallels the ``speedballing''
habits of heroin addicts 20 years ago, who supplemented their
barbiturates with amphetamines, he said.
   Valium and the tranquilizer Xanax, which overtook Valium last
year as the most-prescribed benzodiazepine tranquilizer in the
country, are long-acting drugs that can produce seizures when taken
at high doses. They also can lead to severe addictions that are hard
to kick, Smith said.
   ``We believe we have identified a valid trend nationwide, and
other independent sources support it,'' said Smith.
   The study surveyed 3,000 workers in 339 chemical dependency
treatment programs across the nation on a variety of questions. It
found that many reported a growing dual-drug problem.
   Data on hospital emergency room drug overdoses, addiction
treatment admissions and law enforcement seizure statistics support
the study results, Smith said. In San Francisco, emergency room
overdoses have increased 77 percent this year compared to 1987.
   ``The emergency room data suggest not only were we correct, but
it's worse than we thought,'' said Smith. ``It's clearly a trend and
we've not peaked out yet.''
   Smith said the widespread dual-drug phenomenon warrants expanded
treatment centers, supply-reduction efforts and education programs
for drug users and physicians.
   Although cocaine users also use alcohol to take the edge off,
Smith said researchers are particularly fearful of the
cocaine-tranquilizer combination.
   ``When you combine two drugs ... it multiplies. Instead of one
plus one equalling two, it's three, four, five or six,'' said Hal
Linebarger, a chemical dependency therapist at a center south of San
Francisco. ``They cancel each other out, but it ends up being much
more poisonous to the system.''
   Tranquilizers can ease the emotional and physical depression that
follows a cocaine ``high,'' Linebarger explained.
   A secondary dependence on tranquilizers can go unnoticed by a
cocaine addict, Smith said. Physicians may prescribe tranquilizers
for patients who complain of feeling anxious and paranoid, not
realizing the symptoms are a result of cocaine use, he said.
   Prescription tranquilizers also are available on the street
through wholesale diversions and international smuggling, he said.
   Although the cocaine epidemic appeared to be leveling off in
1983, the introduction of crack cocaine in 1984 produced record
levels of dual-drug dependence, Smith said.
   ``Any time you see an increase in an upper, you'll see an
increase in downers, and any time you see an increase in downers,
you'll see an increase in uppers,'' he said. ``Smokable forms of
cocaine are really the fuel for this.''
   The study was conducted by the Training and Education Section of
the Haight Ashbury Free Clinic in conjunction with the Research
Division of the Merritt-Peralta Chemical Dependency Recovery
Hospital in Oakland.

   Israeli troops shot and wounded 10 Palestinians
in clashes in the occupied lands today, and the army eased a six-day
curfew aimed at blocking violence fueled by the Palestinian
declaration of independence.
   Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin dismissed the declaration of a
Palestinian state in the Israeli-occupied territories as a ``PLO
deception attempt,'' and Israel launched a diplomatic offensive on
Wednesday to counter it.
   Hospital officials said 10 Palestinians were shot and wounded
when soldiers opened fire on rioting youths near Nablus in the West
Bank and several areas of the Gaza Strip. Among the wounded were a
15-year-old girl shot in the back and a 34-year-old woman hit in the
left thigh, they said.
   The army said it was checking the reports.
   In Arab east Jersualem today, two Israeli policemen were injured
by rocks at an Arab boys' school, police spokesman Rafi Levy said.
He said riot police then entered Rashadiye School and arrested eight
students.
   A teacher said trouble started when police arrived to quiet
students singing Palestinian patriotic songs in the school's
courtyard. The teacher would not give his name.
   The army lifted curfews from several towns in the Gaza Strip,
home to 650,000 Palestinians, but kept curfews in effect for the
250,000 who live in refugee camps. A curfew also was maintained on
the Nur Shams refugee camp near Tulkarem in the West Bank.
   Telephone lines remained cut off to homes and businesses for a
seventh day in the West Bank cities of Hebron, Nablus, Ramallah and
Jenin, but the army said they would be restored during the day.
   The lines were severed to prevent Palestinians from coordinating
anti-Israeli activities during the meeting in Algiers of the PLO's
parliament-in-exile, which ended Tuesday with the declaration of
independence.
   The government, meanwhile, confirmed that Defense Minister
Yitzhak Rabin ordered Israel Television not to show scenes of
jubilation at the Palestine National Council meeting in order not to
incite Palestinians in the territories.
   Rabin, who has been defense minister in charge of quelling
violence during the 11-month Palestinian uprising, told Israel
television Wednesday night that quiet could be restored in three to
six months.
   ``I believe that the events of the last several days can become a
turning point leading to a significant decrease in violence,'' he
said.
   He expressed hope that many Palestinians would be content with
``achieving their aim and allowing the political process'' but said
Israel ``should continue to supress violence and block the PLO
deception attempt by political action.''
   In Jerusalem on Wednesday, Foreign Ministry officials announced a
diplomatic campaign against the Palestine Liberation Organization's
drive for recognition of its self-proclaimed state.
   The effort will focus on the PLO's failure to renounce terrorism,
to accept U.N. Resolution 242 unconditionally or to clearly
recognize Israel, one official said. He said Israel will argue that
the resolution, which implicitly recognizes the the Jewish state's
right to exist, cannot be amended.
   The PLO said it was accepting the resolution on condition the
Palestinian right to self-determination is also recognized.
   Palestinian hardliners said they opposed the declaration, and the
fundamentalist Moslem Hamas (Zeal) movement called a three-day
general strike to protest the declaration's implicit recognition of
Israel.
   Foreign Minister Shimon Peres complained that recognition of the
would-be Palestinian state would interfere with any peace process.
   He told reporters that recognition, now by more than 20 mostly
Arab countries, ``further complicates the situation by supporting
something that shouldn't be supported.''
   On Wednesday, Palestinians kept up their nightly revelry
celebrating the Algiers independence statement. Youths danced in the
streets in the West Bank city of Bethlehem, and firecrackers rounded
through Gaza City.
   A 25-year-old man wounded in the head three days ago in the Gaza
Strip town of Rafah died Wednesday, raising to 313 the number of
Palestinians killed in the nearly year-long uprising against 21
years of Israeli occupation. Eleven Israelis also have died.
   Also in Gaza, military appeals court rejected appeals of eight
Arab activists slated for deportation but upheld two other appeals
conditional on approval of military officials, Israel television
said. It said the eight planned to appeal to Israel's Supreme Court.
   Since the uprising started, Israel has deported 33 Palestinians.

<HEAD>Prosecution Changes Charge Against Woman Accused In Newborn's
Abduction</HEAD>

   The state dropped a kidnapping charge
against a woman who now stands accused of ``permanent detention or
restraint'' in the abduction of a newborn boy from his mother's
hospital room.
   After the change in the charge Wednesday, Acqunetta Rushon Smith,
32, entered two pleas: innocent and innocent by reason of insanity.
   Chief Deputy Prosecutor Lloyd King said he decided to alter the
charge against Ms. Smith because of the alleged purpose of the crime.
   Kidnapping is an abduction for the purpose of holding someone for
a ransom, as a hostage, or to hurt the victim. Permanent detention
is holding or concealing a person ``without ever releasing him,
without ever returning him to the person or institution from whose
lawful custody he was taken.''
   King contended Ms. Smith wanted to raise the infant she is
accused of abducting.
   Kidnapping and permanent detention carry the same penalty: five
to 20 years in prison and a fine of up to $15,000. No bond was set.
   The innocent plea, according to public defender Bill Simpson, is
standard in criminal cases. He said the plea of innocent by reason
of mental disease or defect was made so that Ms. Smith could be
evaluated by psychiatrists.
   Among the issues to be settled is whether Ms. Smith is mentally
capable of standing trial.
   She was denied bond Tuesday after she entered an innocent plea on
the kidnapping charge in Little Rock Municipal Court.
   Ms. Smith was arrested at her Hot Springs home Monday after
police received a tip from an anonymous caller that she had taken
the baby, Christopher Michael Jones. The child was taken Nov. 1 from
his mother's hospital room, three days after he was born six weeks
premature, by a woman disguised as a nurse.
   The boy was returned to his parents, Annette Thomas-Jones and
Willie Jones, in good health. Authorities said the infant was well
taken care of during the two weeks he was missing.
   Ms. Smith and her boyfriend wanted to have a baby boy, said Capt.
Bob H. Moore of the Little Rock Police Department.
   A registered nurse at the University of Arkansas medical school
hospital recalled during a Wednesday interview that Ms. Smith was a
caring person who tended to her terminally ill sister for two years
before she died.
   Lisa Rutherford, the assistant head nurse of the hospital's
clinic, said Ms. Smith's sister died early this year. Mrs.
Rutherford would not reveal the woman's illness.
   ``She could have deserted her sister,'' Mrs. Rutherford said. ``A
lot of patients that come in here that have a very bad illness,
their families just totally turn on them. She could have done that
easily but she didn't.''
   Ms. Smith, divorced with four children of her own, cares for her
sister's child.

<HEAD>Protesters Say Fast Forced Officials To Agree To Rehire Strikers</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   About 50 people claimed victory today and
ended a five-day fast aimed at forcing officials to rehire the last
of about 100 workers dismissed for roles in Poland's worst labor
unrest in seven years.
   Agreement was reached through the mediation of the Roman Catholic
bishop in Katowice, said Adam Slomka, a spokesman for the fasters
protesting since Saturday in the Christ the King Cathedral in the
southern city.
   ``We managed to achieve in five days what hadn't been achieved in
several months,'' said Slomka, speaking by telephone from the
cathedral.
   The nation's bishops and Lech Walesa, leader of the banned
Solidarity independent labor movement, had appealed for the miners'
reinstatement. The opposition said rehiring them was a condition for
participating in talks with the government.
   Slomka said agreement was reached late Wednesday with the
national coal federation to reinstate the workers today. The strikes
were in August.
   Bishop Damian Zimon led a delegation that met with provincial
officials on Tuesday, Slomka said, adding that two more negotiating
sessions Wednesday led to the agreement.
   He said the workers won job reinstatements for all the dismissed
workers except two workers at the Stalowa Wola steel mill in the
southeast. The church will continue to mediate in that case, he said.
   Tadeusz Napieracz, a deputy director at the coal federation, the
body that oversees the mines, said, ``The miners are returning to
their old posts as of tomorrow.'' He denied they ever had been fired
and said officials had wanted to to give them new positions, while
the miners insisted on their old jobs.
   Solidarity national spokesman Janusz Onyszkiewicz said in Warsaw
that the the decision ``should have been mede several months ago.
Let us hope other positive signs will follow.''
   The hunger protest began early Saturday after a pro-independence
march Friday night turned violent. Organizers say about 250 people
took shelter from police inside the cathedral in Katowice, about 170
miles southeast of Warsaw.
   At the urging of one miner, about 80 of the people began a hunger
strike, originally aimed at winning freedom for detained fellow
demonstrators.
   But after those demonstrators were freed, the fasters decided to
adopt the cause of the fired miners.
   Andrzej Polmanski, whom authorities have said is a ringleader of
the August strike at the Andaluzja coal mine, said the fasters
included 16 dismissed miners. Students and various opposition
activists comprised the rest.
   The opposition originally counted 103 workers as fired or drafted
into the army for joining the August strikes for higher pay and
legalization of Solidarity, he said. The number of those still not
rehired had fallen to 49 miners and the two steelworkers by this
week, he said.
   Polmanski said the issue was broader than individual jobs. If
authorities succeeded in firing strike leaders, it would make
workers less willing to fight for their rights in the future, he
said.
   The question also became a stumbling block to talks between the
opposition and authorities on Poland's future and the legalization
of Solidarity, which was crushed in a 1981 military crackdown.
Walesa agreed to end the August strikes after the government agreed
to the talks.
   Walesa has said he will not come to the table until officials
honor a promise by Interior Minister Gen. Czeslaw Kiszczak at the
end of August that strikers would not be fired.
   Also blocking the talks is the government's objection to two
longtime Solidarity activists Walesa has refused to remove from the
opposition delegation _ Jacek Kuron and Adam Michnik.
   Solidarity also has insisted that the government reverse its
decision to close the Lenin Shipyard in Gdansk, where Solidarity was
born in an August 1980 strike wave.
   On Wednesday, the Episcopate Secretariat, which represents Roman
Catholic Bishops nationwide, criticized plans to close the shipyard
and said it was ``a political act not facilitating reconciliation.''

<HEAD>Police Say Milwaukee Man Shot State Trooper, Security Guard, Self</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Authorities in Illinois and Wisconsin are
trying to piece together the background of a man whose allegedly
shot his landlord, a state trooper and a security guard before
shooting himself.
   The suspect, Phuoc Tri Nguyen, 36, was listed in critical
condition Wednesday at Memorial Hospital in Woodstock, said a
spokeswoman.
   Trooper Jose Rangel, 33, twice was taken to surgery Wednesday at
St. Anthony Medical Center in Rockford, where he was in critical
condition with an abdominal wound, said hospital spokeswoman Betty
Cavers.
   Police in Milwaukee, where Nguyen lived eight years, know little
about the man suspected of the multiple shootings in that city and
in the Rockford area.
   Milwaukee police Capt. Albert Hentz said Nguyen came to the
United States from Vietnam in 1980, sponsored by a refugee program
of Milwaukee's Catholic Social Services. He became a naturalized
citizen in 1987.
   Nguyen shot security guard Michael T. Glee, 18, of Belvidere at
an auto dealership and robbed a Belvidere service station before a
police chase that ended with Nguyen shooting himself, police said.
   Glee was released from the hospital after treatment for a gunshot
wound to one arm.
   Police were unsure what caused Nguyen to open fire on Rangel in
the incident that began about 1 a.m. Wednesday at the Belvidere toll
plaza on Interstate 90, about 15 miles from the Wisconsin line.
   Rangel was shot after he stopped Nguyen's car because of Nguyen's
failure to pay the toll, state police Sgt. Tami Haukedahl said. The
trooper and his partner returned fire, but the suspect's car sped
off, Haukedahl said.
   The shooting at the auto dealership came next, followed by the
gasoline station robbery in Belvidere about 2:15 a.m., in which no
one was hurt, police said.
   After the robbery, Nguyen's car was pulled over in Belvidere by a
local officer, but after backup police arrived, the suspect led them
on a 20-mile chase, said Belvidere Police Chief Charles Burkhart.
   Police blocked Nguyen's car in a parking lot, and he fired one
shot at police before shooting himself in the head, Burkhart said.
   In Wisconsin, Nguyen was charged with attempted murder in the
Sunday shooting of his 74-year-old landlord, John Pietruscka, police
said. Nguyen also was charged with armed robbery for allegedly
taking $130 from a friend that night, they said.
   Nguyen also was the prime suspect in a robbery later Sunday at a
service station in suburban Milwaukee in which two others were shot,
police said.
   All three Wisconsin shooting victims remained hospitalized.

   This country isn't going to the dogs. In fact,
more Americans now consider a cat the ``purr-fect'' pet, and birds
are soaring in popularity.
   For the first time ever, cats are more popular with American pet
owners, apparently because of the advent of the yuppie, the American
Veterinary Medical Association said Wednesday.
   ``With more and more apartment living, a cat is just a better pet
to own. A dog needs a lot of attention. A person has to hurry from
work to walk a dog,'' Karen Gavzer, marketing director for the AVMA,
said in a telephone interview.
   The U.S. cat population reached an estimated 54.6 million at the
end of 1987, compared with 52.4 million dogs, according to a study
of 40,000 households by Charles Research Group of Overland Park, Kan.
   Birds are moving up in the rankings faster than any other
creature. The number of pet birds rose 24 percent, from 10.4 million
to 12.9 million, between 1983, when a previous survey was taken, and
the new study.
   ``A bird is even more of a yuppie pet,'' said Dr. Ann Clark, an
AVMA veterinarian. ``The big birds are not cheap. The more exotic
ones cost thousands of dollars.''
   The U.S. cat population increased 4.6 percent and the dog
population declined 5.8 percent between the two studies, said the
AVMA, based in suburban Schaumburg.
   ``People used to get a cat or bird until they could get a `real'
pet, but people are finding out that cats and birds are real pets,''
said Ms. Clark.
   ``Some of the big, exotic birds live 60 or 70 years, bringing
pleasure to two or three generations of one family,'' she said.
   The total number of cats, dogs, birds and horses kept by
Americans increased less than 1 percent to 126 million. When
hamsters, fish, turtles, snakes and rabbits are counted, the total
climbs to more than 200 million creatures _ closing in on the
nation's human population of 245 million as of last January.
   The typical pet owner, researchers said, is a large family with
children living outside a metropolitan area, with an above-average
income and more than one pet.
   They also found that people in Western and Southern states keep
more pets. The leading cat-owning states are Oregon, Maine, Idaho,
Vermont and Washington, the study indicated. Dogs are tops in
Nevada, Wyoming, Mississippi and New Mexico.

   Doctors pumped nearly two pounds of cocaine in tiny
rubber bags from the stomach of a pregnant woman arrested along with
three men trying to smuggle the drug in their bodies, Customs agents
said.
   ``This is a new low, when a pregnant woman will put cocaine in
her body and risk not only her own life but the life of her unborn
child,'' said Customs spokesman Cliff Stallings.
   The four Colombians were arrested at Miami International Airport
on Sunday, charged with smuggling 427 bags containing more than
eight pounds of cocaine, said Michael Sheehan, another Customs
spokesman. The practice of smuggling cocaine by swallowing it is not
uncommon.
   The men were allowed to pass the cocaine at Jackson Memorial
Hospital; doctors pumped the stomach of the woman, Iveth Rocha, 22,
Sheehan said.
   ``It is possible, and it has happened here in Miami, for a
persons' digestive juices to eat through the rubber and release the
cocaine into the stomach,'' said Van Capps, Customs chief of airport
operations in Miami. ``If that happens, that person is dead in a
matter of minutes.''
   ``A lot of time these people, `mules,' are peasants really, from
very low levels of society,'' Stallings added. ``In many cases they
may be ignorant of the dangers.''
   Customs officials took the group to the hospital after they gave
suspicious answers to routine questions, Stallings said. The woman,
her husband, Manuel Ramos, 35, brother Thomas Rocha, 26, and Jaime
Cujea, 41, were being held in jail.
   Ms. Rocha's sons, ages 3 and 4, were placed in state custody.

   A Cessna-441 crashed in heavy fog today in
lagoons west of Paris, killing at least seven people, some of them
journalists, officials said.
   Rescue workers went immediately to the site of the crash, the
Saclay lagoons on the edge of the Essonne and Yvelines districts
outside Paris.
   Local officials and rescue workers said the pilot and six
passengers, some of them reporters, were killed in the 10:30 a.m.
crash. The cause was not immediately known.
   The flight roster listed 10 people, according to the General
Direction for Civil Aviation.
   However, police and Essonne officials believed some scheduled
passengers failed to board the plane.
   They said there appeared to be no survivors in the debris
scattered 150 meters around the crash site.
   The plane took off in heavy fog from the Toussus-le-Noble airport
in the Yvelines and was headed for Montlucon, in central France,
authorities said.
   The Air and Frontier police said the aircraft apparently lost
radio contact with the control tower shortly after take-off.
   The flight was organized in part by Garages du Bac, a BMW
dealership in France, to take journalists to a factory and watch
test drives of a new model car.
   Jean-Charles Delesalle, a reporter with the newspaper Journal du
Dimanche said he was among those who missed the flight. He said
later he learned of the accident while in his car.
   ``I stopped the car. I had an intuition. I knew it was `my'
plane,'' he told French television. ``I just stayed there
trembling.''

<HEAD>Bush's Spokeswoman Brushes Off Greenspan's Warning</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL PAGE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The spokeswoman for George Bush's presidential
transition team today answered warnings from the chairman of the
Federal Reserve Board about the deficit by saying that ``economists
never agree on anything.''
   Sheila Tate also said in a television interview that
President-elect Bush's first appointments to his economic team have
sent a ``very clear signal'' to investors that ``by and large helped
calm the markets.''
   Bush aides have been scrambling to ease fears about the deficit,
and concerns about the vice president's pledge not to raise taxes,
which have sent stocks tumbling at home and put the already-weak
dollar into a further tailspin in international markets.
   The dollar fell today to a 15-year low against the Japanese yen
despite reported central bank intervention in Tokyo. The Dow fell
more than 38 points Wednesday and had dropped almost 90 points to a
2{-month low since last week's election.
   Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan added the strongest voice
yet to calls for action on the deficit, telling a national
commission Wednesday the red ink ``already has begun to eat away at
the foundations of our economic strength. And the need to deal with
it is becoming ever more urgent.''
   Greenspan, who was appointed to the Federal Reserve post by
President Reagan, addressed questions of a possible tax increase by
saying how the deficit is reduced ``is far less relevant than that
it is done.''
   Asked on ABC-TV's ``Good Morning America'' about his warning,
Tate said:
   ``Economists never agree on anything. For every economist you
cite we can trot out one who is diametrically in opposition.''
   Asked whether Bush as president would be at odds with Greenspan,
Tate said:
   ``It's traditional economists simply don't agree with each other.
And there's a lot of jockeying going on right now. We just have to
wait and see what President-elect Bush decides to do.''
   ``There's a lot of talk now swirling about the deficit,'' she
said. ``I think his appointment of (Treasury Secretary) Nicholas
Brady gave a very clear signal as to the kind of administration he's
going to have and I think by and large helped calm the markets.''
   Investors in the United States and abroad have attributed some of
the bad economic news to strong campaign statement of ``Read my lips
_ no new taxes.''
   ``I think it's that traditional nervousness with change,'' Tate
said of the market plunge.
   ``He (Bush) has said time and time again he wants to meet with
Congress. He's expressed conciliatory gestures. ... I think they'll
work together to deal with the issue,'' she said.
   Greenspan was one of several witnesses who told the National
Economic Commission, which is studying how to deal with the deficit,
that the problem has been too long ignored.
   ``This country is imperiled and it is going to take a whole lot
of guts to face this fact and deal with it,'' said William Brock,
who was Labor Secretary under Reagan.
   The Fed chief testified that the deficit is more likely to be cut
permanently through spending cuts rather than tax increases because
congressmen tend to spend new revenues from taxes. But he added that
any long-range plan would help lower interest rates ``regardless of
its components.''

<TEXT>
   Mike Tyson's fights continued to take place
outside the ring as Robin Givens, his estranged wife, filed a $125
million libel suit against the heavyweight champion.
   In the lawsuit filed Wednesday in federal court, the 23-year-old
actress, who appears in the TV show ``Head of the Class,'' accused
Tyson of holding her up ``to public contempt, ridicule,
embarrassment disgrace and prejudice'' for remarks he made that were
quoted by the New York Post.
   Last month, Givens had announced that she would not seek or
accept any money in her divorce from Tyson.
   Among Tyson's quotations in the Post article that angered Givens:
   _ ``She manipulated me. ... Now it turns out she was lying when
she said she didn't want anything from me.''
   _ ``The nature of those two women (Givens and her mother, Ruth
Roper) is to be mean and vindictive. She said she wants nothing, but
she refused to sign a release.''
   _ ``And she (Givens) stole money from me when we were together.''
   The Post was not named as a defendant in the lawsuit, which
described the article as ``false, defamatory, malicious and
libelous.'' The newspaper had no immediate comment.
   Tyson and Givens, married Feb. 7, have both filed for divorce and
he is also seeking an annulment. He is suing her in New Jersey and
she is suing him in California.
   ``I think it's funny,'' Tyson's manager, Bill Cayton, told The
Associated Press.
   ``The lawsuit is outrageous and ludicrous,'' Howard Weitzman,
Tyson's lawyer, said. ``This young lady once again is atempting to
shift blame from her conduct to someone else and blame them for any
problems she perceives she's having.''
   Givens has accused Tyson of mistreating her during their brief
marriage. He has also accused her of tricking him into marriage by
feigning pregnancy.

   A duck hunter has been charged with
shooting a low-flying research airplane along the Chesapeake Bay's
Eastern Shore.
   Steven James Zang, 31, was arraigned Tuesday on charges of
assault and malicious destruction of property.
   He was accused of firing on the four-seat private aircraft from a
duck blind Oct. 8, said Maryland Department of Natural Resources
police Capt. Fred Sherbert.
   Eight pellets hit the tail of the plane, causing an estimated
$1,500 damage, authorities said. The aircraft, which was carrying
two Virginia Tech researchers observing eagle nesting areas,
returned safely to the airport.
   The plane was flying at about 300 feet, said pilot Joe Kesser.
   Kesser said he had been shot at by Germans and Japanese during
World War II, but ``this was the first time by an Eastern Shoreman.''

<HEAD>Fiji Cabinet Suspends Internal Security Decree</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SUVA, Fiji (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government today lifted laws that had given
the military and police wide powers of arrest and limited press and
personal freedoms.
   The decree had been in effect since June, following the discovery
of illegally imported weapons, including automatic rifles from the
Soviet Union, hand grenades and ammunition.
   In a statement tonight, Information Minister Ratu Imoke Kubuaeola
said the Internal Security Decree was intended to close gaps in
existing laws to ensure security in this South Pacific nation, which
has experienced two coups in 1{ years.
   The decree limited freedom of movement and expression and allowed
searches and detentions without charges being filed.
   ``Now that most of the illegal arms have been recovered and
greater peace and stability exists in the country, it was the view
of Cabinet that the time was right for the ISD to be suspended,''
Kubuaeoloa said after a Cabinet meeting.
   At the same time, the government deployed troops outside
government buildings and the capital's two radio stations. It was
not clear if that was related to the lifting of the security decree.
   The soldiers were not carrying arms.
   Military Forces spokesman Capt. Eroni Volavola described the
deployment as ``a normal and regular security exercise.''
   About 30 soldiers were posted outside state-run Radio Fiji and
the private commercial radio station FM-96; a building housing the
offices of ministers of the interim government; and electricity and
water installations.
   Fiji has a population of about 715,000, of which native Fijians
comprise 47 percent. Indians, descendants of British imported sugar
plantation labor in the 19th century, make up 49 percent of the
population.
   On May 14, 1987, Sitiveni Rabuka led armed soldiers into
Parliament and arrested the month-old Indian-dominated government of
Prime Minister Timoci Bavadra. Rabuka led a second coup Sept. 25,
saying the rights of the minority ethnic Fijians remained threatened.
   He broke the nation's ties with the Commonwealth in October by
declaring Fiji a republic.
   Rabuka later handed power to an interim government, headed by
Ratu Sir Kamisese Mara, while a new constitution was drafted to
ensure Fijians have permanent and dominant control in Parliament.
Rabuka elevated himself to chief of the army and home affairs
minister.

<HEAD>Treasury Group Considering Plan to Rescue Savings and Loan System</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Treasury Department staff group is
considering a plan using taxpayer money to rescue the ailing savings
and loan system in return for direct administration supervision of
the bailout, an administration official says.
   The administration would prefer some sort of off-budget financing
for the S&L cleanup, but ``they're convinced one way or another that
the Treasury has to participate,'' the official, speaking on
condition of anonymity, said Wednesday.
   Kenneth Guenther, executive vice president of the Independent
Bankers Association of America, a trade group, said Vice President
George Bush's advisers are ``very seriously'' looking at creating a
presidential panel to control rescue expenditures.
   In thrift rescues to date, the Federal Home Loan Bank Board,
which regulates S&Ls, has been criticized for making open-ended
guarantees to private investors taking over failed institutions and
for not requiring the investors to risk more of their own money.
   Guenther said the structure of the new board would be similar to
the one created this year to oversee the bailout of the Farm Credit
System.
   The administration official confirmed that the option was being
considered by the Treasury staff, but said, ``I don't think they've
reached any conclusions yet.''
   ``Essentially it says, `We'll give you the money, but we want
some control','' the official said.
   In the rescue of the Farm Credit System, which provides loans to
farmers, Congress guaranteed the system's borrowing and provided a
line of credit to the Treasury. However, it required that a
three-member panel including the secretaries of the Treasury and
agriculture approve bailout expenditures.
   The official also confirmed a report published Wednesday in The
Washington Post, which said the administration plan would require
$20 billion to $30 billion a year for three years.
   An acknowledgment that taxpayer money is required would represent
a shift in policy. Bank board Chairman M. Danny Wall has maintained
that the savings industry could continue to pay for rescuing failed
institutions, although only if a special fee on healthy institutions
continued for 30 years.
   Treasury Undersecretary George Gould has said there is a limit to
what the industry can pay but he has not said yet if the problem
exceeds it.
   Gould did not return a telephone call seeking comment Wednesday.
Treasury Department spokesman Arthur Siddon declined to comment on
the task force's work. Karl Hoyle, a bank board spokesman, said Wall
was traveling and could not be reached immediately.
   The savings and loan crisis is shaping up as one of the chief
challenges facing Bush. The bank board estimates it will cost up to
$50 billion to close or merge failed institutions. Private analysts
put the cost as high as $100 billion.
   According to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., which insures
commercial banks, S&L losses are growing at a rate of $15 billion a
year.
   The need for potentially huge expenditures comes at a time when
foreign investors, who buy much of the U.S. government's debt, are
demanding that Bush, who pledged not to raise taxes, reduce the
budget deficit.
   The Treasury task force formulating the administration's position
is looking to complete its work next month.
   Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady, who will continue in his
position in the Bush administration, ordered the review shortly
after taking office in September.
   Robert R. Glauber, the Harvard business school professor who was
staff director for the stock market crash study that Brady conducted
last year for President Reagan, heads the task force.

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   About 2,000 gallons of radioactive water overflowed
a collection area during maintenance at the Pilgrim nuclear plant,
and some of it seeped outdoors into a parking lot, the plant's owner
said.
   One worker was slightly contaminated.
   Peter Agnes, Gov. Michael Dukakis' chief aide on nuclear power,
said elevated levels of radioactivity were detected as far away as
the perimeter fence. He gave no indication of whether the spill
posed a threat to the public.
   The spill occurred Wednesday at a low-level nuclear waste
processing area at the plant, which is awaiting word from the
Nuclear Regulatory Commission on whether it can begin low-level
power testing after a 2{-year shutdown.
   About 100 gallons seeped outside the processing facility and onto
an asphalt truck parking lot, Boston Edison Co. spokeswoman Elaine
Robinson said. The water inside and out was mopped up, she said.
   Karl Abraham, an NRC spokesman, said the commission may call in a
special inspector to investigate.
   ``The normal routine follow-up would be by the resident
inspectors,'' he said. ``But with all of the attention focusing on
Pilgrim, we can't rule out the possibility that something else will
happen (such as) sending a specialist to look at this.''
   The plant has been closed because of management and equipment
problems.
   Agnes, assistant secretary of public safety, said he sent a
Public Health Department team to report on the cleanup and get
information on what caused the spill.
   ``Since we are speaking about a substantial amount of waste water
and an exposure that at least resulted in elevated readings as far
out as the perimeter, it's a significant event,'' Agnes said.
   The accident happened in a waste processing area during
preparations for shipping a container of waste from the plant. The
water was being filtered through earth to remove radioactivity. The
earth was to be shipped to a storage facility in Barnwell, S.C.,
Robinson said.
   A plant operator making a tour of the plant discovered that the
water had overflowed and immediately cut off the water, she said.
   The worker's knee touched some water during the cleanup and was
washed with soap and water, Edison spokesman John Fidler said.
   ``The level of contamination on his knee was just barely above
the minimum level where we say something is contaminated instead of
clean,'' Fidler said.
   He said the plant has roped off and is testing the area around
the spill.

<HEAD>Italian Communists Call for Rehabilitation of Dubcek</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ROME (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Italy's Communist Party today called for the
political rehabilitation of Alexander Dubcek, the former
Czechoslovak Communist Party leader ousted after the 1968 Soviet-led
invasion of his country.
   ``Restore political honor to Alexander Dubcek,'' Italian party
leader Achille Occhetto said at a news conference following a
two-hour meeting with Dubcek, who is in Italy on his first trip
abroad in 18 years.
   Occheto called rehabilitation ``a necessary step if you want to
reclose the wound opened 20 years ago.''
   Occhetto said the Italian Communists would raise the matter with
the Czechoslovak and Soviet Communist parties, but did not say when.
   Dubcek introduced measures to liberalize Czechoslovakia's
politics and economy in the 1968 ``Prague Spring,'' which was
crushed by the Warsaw Pact invasion.
   Dubcek traveled to Italy to receive an honorary degree at the
University of Bologna last weekend.
   ``When I received the honorary degree, I could not forget all the
friends and comrades who, along with me, gave life to the political
season of '68,'' Dubcek told the news conference. ``Everything that
is taking place, here also, is a moral support for everything that
was done in those days.''
   Dubcek and Occhetto discussed the liberalizing policies of Soviet
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev during their meeting at a Communist
Party institute in Rome, Occhetto said.
   Italy's Communist Party, the largest in the West, condemned the
invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1968 and has broken with Moscow.

   A former insurance agent accused of
bilking policyholders of $590,000 disappeared after renting a small
plane, and officials failed to locate him after a two-week search of
a lake bottom.
   U.S. Aviation Underwriters called off its search at a
recreational lake for Blan Stewart and the single-engine plane he
was flying, said Marshall Dean, a claims manager with the company,
which had a policy on the plane.
   ``It's really difficult,'' Dean said of the hunt, which for three
days was aided by a $1,500-a-day sonar device. ``The terrain under
there is so rough. It's like finding a needle in a haystack.''
   Stewart, a 45-year-old former agent with Travelers Corp.,
disappeared Oct. 31 while en route from Vero Beach, Fla., to
Huntsville, flying into blustery weather to the north.
   Some of those involved in the search speculated that Stewart
ditched the Piper Cherokee or staged a crash and his death to escape
having to stand trial on charges of theft by deception that could
bring up to 100 years in prison.
   ``If he's not at the bottom of that lake, he's a fugitive from
justice,'' said Holly Wiseman, an assistant state attorney general
who built the case that led to Stewart's indictment in August.
   Others said he might have crashed intentionally to let his wife
and business collect on numerous life insurance policies that
prosecutors said totaled some $3 million.
   ``The whole circumstances are mighty unusual,'' said Bump Holman,
vice president of the Vero Beach, Fla., company that rented the
plane to Stewart.
   The pilot's brother, Gene Stewart of Columbia, S.C., said divers
and others would return to Lake Martin for a last time today, with
the family footing the bill. After that, a reward will be offered to
lure salvagers, he said.
   ``I'm convinced it's in the lake somewhere,'' he said.
   Gene Stewart, who was at the helm of a search boat Wednesday,
said his brother had acknowledged the thefts and repaid some
$400,000. He said his brother never would try to escape justice by
faking his death.
   Stewart surrendered his insurance license earlier this year.
   Dean said pieces of airplane wheels have been found in the search
area, and one resident reported hearing an airplane with engine
trouble and what sounded like an explosion the night Stewart
disappeared.
   ``We're convinced it's in the lake,'' Dean said. ``I think it hit
the water, tore off the gear and sank.''

   Police captured two escaped murderers today
after an officer became suspicious when a car bearing the seal of
the West Virginia corrections department drove through town about 2
a.m., authorities said.
   Freddie Rakes, 29, and Dickie Wimmer, 36, escaped from the West
Virginia Penitentiary at Moundsville on Wednesday by crashing a
maintenance truck and a prison car through a gate. The two worked in
the prison motor pool.
   They were captured without incident about 400 miles away.
   London Patrolman Billy Osborne radioed the prison car's license
number to a dispatcher this morning because the car seemed out of
place in this town.
   When the report came back that the vehicle was being sought in an
escape, Osborne called for backup and the town's two other officers
responded.
   A spokesman at the penitentiary said West Virginia authorities
were awaiting word on how the inmates will be returned.
   Moundsville Warden Jerry Hedrick said the escape occurred early
Wednesday when an inmate crashed a gate in a stolen maintenance
truck and was followed by the second pirsoner in the car. The truck
was abandoned a short distance away.
   The motor pool is outside the 122-year-old prison's stone walls
but surrounded by a chain-link fence, Hedrick said.
   Rakes is serving a life sentence without parole for the 1980
robbery-murder of a 74-year-old man. Wimmer is serving two life
sentences, one without parole, for the 1979 slayings of his
estranged wife and their two children.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A liquid diet like the one that shaved 67 pounds
off talk-show host Oprah Winfrey should be attempted only by certain
people, after conventional diets fail and under a physician's
supervision, dietitians say.
   After Winfrey discussed her four-month slimdown Tuesday on her
show, about 5,000 telephone calls an hour began to pour into Sandoz
Nutrition Corp., which sells the Optifast diet program she used,
said company spokesman Jim Parsons.
   The Optifast program is offered to the public only by hospitals
and physicians, Parsons said.
   But liquid diet programs ``were not made for the majority of
dieters who want to lose 10 or 15 pounds,'' said Mary Lee Chin, a
Denver consulting dietitian and spokesperson for the American
Dietetic Association.
   Such programs generally should be considered only by people who
exceed their ideal weight by at least 20 percent or who face a
medical risk because of their weight, Chin said. Liquid diets also
should be tried only if conventional diets fail, she said Wednesday.
   People also should avoid liquid diets if they are pregnant or
have kidney or liver diseases, cancer or a recent heart attack, she
said.
   Chin also listed diabetics who requires insulin, but Karen Miller
Kovach, assistant director of nutrition services at the Cleveland
Clinic, said she considered diabetics potentially eligible after a
thorough evaluation.
   Chin and Kovach warned against buying liquid diet products at
stores and using them without medical supervision.
   For one thing, liquid diets provide essentially a starvation diet
of 800 calories a day or fewer, and that can cause medical harm
unless the symptoms of excessive calorie deprivation are spotted
early, Chin said. For example, such a diet can cause muscle wasting
as well as mineral imbalances that can lead to heart malfunctioning,
she said.
   Medical supervision also helps in dealing with side effects of
the diets, which can include dizziness, constipation, dry skin, hair
loss and intolerance to cold temperatures, Chin said.
   In addition, Kovach said, people who follow a liquid diet without
supervision may not realize they have such conditions as kidney
disease that mean they should avoid such diets.
   And people who do the diets on their own tend to regain the
weight they lost once they return to solid food, Kovach said. They
miss a key component of supervised liquid diet programs: a
maintenance program that teaches how to keep the weight off, she
said.
   Maintenance programs stress the importance of exercise and
changing behavior that led to the excess weight, Chin said. Winfrey,
on her show, pointed out that ``the fact that she lost the weight
doesn't mean she can keep it off without exercise,'' Chin said.
   Apart from looking for medical supervision and a maintenance
program that will allow significant individual attention, Chin and
Kovach offered these tips for choosing a liquid diet program:
   _Make sure the diet provides high-quality protein, which includes
the eight essential amino acids, and that it fulfills the
recommended dietary allowances for vitamins, minerals and protein.
The protein will be high quality if it is from an animal source,
Chin said.
   _Besides a physician, the program should include a nutritionist,
an exercise physiologist and a behavioral counselor to help keep
weight off.
   _Ask about long-term success rates. One program says that after
2.5 years, 18 percent to 41 percent of dieters keep off the weight
they lost, which is a ``significant success rate,'' Chin said. If
the program offers no statistics, she said, ``I'd look at another
program.''
   _Look for an incentive to keep dieters in the program, such as
prizes or other rewards for weight loss.

<TEXT>
   Chicago's rough-and-tumble City Council has passed
a measure designed to curb sexual, racial or ethnic insults during
committee hearings.
   The measure passed 25-18 Wednesday despite objections from
several aldermen that it would restrict their rights in questioning
mayoral appointees or witnesses.
   The resolution was introduced by Alderwoman Kathy Osterman in
reaction to what she felt were irrelevant and inappropriate
questions of witnesses.
   The resolution says religious beliefs, gender and heritage
``shall be considered irrelevant and inappropriate considerations in
the decisions regarding appointment, confirmations or eligibility to
present testimony.''
   Alderman Robert Shaw insisted that the measure would infringe on
the council's ``right to be vigilant and protect the public
interest,'' in addition to barring questioning of membership in such
groups as the Ku Klux Klan.
   Shaw was accused last month by a Jewish organization of
``Jew-baiting'' during a committee hearing, a charge he denied.
   Osterman insisted the measure was not designed to stifle
responsible questioning.

<TEXT>
   A Gilbert Stuart portrait of George Washington
that sold in London for $497,000 was sold in New York five months
earlier for only $3,300 because of questions about its authenticity,
says a report published today.
   The painting of the president in a dark blue coat and white neck
cloth sold Wednesday for more than five times its top estimate.
   Both Sotheby's in London, which auctioned the painting Wednesday,
and Christie's East in New York, which auctioned it earlier this
year, said they had asked Marvin Sadik, an expert on Washington
portraits, about the painting's authenticity and had based their
descriptions on his opinion, The New York Times reported.
   Sadik, former director of the Smithsonian Institution's National
Portrait Gallery in Washington and now a consultant and art dealer
in Falmouth, Maine, told the Times he had seen only photographs of
the painting. He also said he was not paid for the opinions he had
given.
   A Christie's spokeswoman, Roberta Maneker, said the work had been
consigned in 1987 as a George Washington painting in the style of
Gilbert Stuart. She declined to identify the painting's owner.
   Debra Force, a Christie's specialist in American paintings, said
she showed the actual painting to Sadik in New York last November or
December because of doubts about its authenticty and Sadik said it
was not by Stuart, the Times said.
   But Sadik said he could not recall seeing the painting.
   James Miller, specialist in British paintings at Sotheby's in
London, told the Times that a Briton purchased the painting in New
York, brought it to London and ``recognized what the painting was.''
It was auctioned as a Stuart painting.
   The painting was purchased Wednesday by the Berry-Hill Gallery of
New York. Miller, who conducted the auction, said it had belonged to
President James Madison and had hung in Madison's Virginia home.
   Sotheby's had estimated its value at only $54,000 to $90,500
because it was one of more than 100 portraits of the president that
Stuart painted after Washington died in 1799, Miller said.

   The Kremlin today said it was calling Estonian
leaders to Moscow to discuss the tiny Baltic republic's challenge to
central Soviet control.
   The first official reaction to the vote of the Estonian Supreme
Soviet on Wednesday was announced by the official Tass news agency
while the parliament in a second Baltic republic, Lithuania, was
meeting to consider similar action.
   Estonian legislators passed an amendment to their own
constitution Wednesday requiring local ratification of new Soviet
laws.
   ``Taking into consideration that the amendment and a number of
other documents adopted by the Estonian parliament are at variance
with provisions of the current Constitution ... the Presidium of the
U.S.S.R. Supreme Soviet has decided to consider the above-mentioned
issue at its next meeting, with representatives of the Estonian
republic to be invited,'' Tass said.
   The tone of the Tass statement was measured and appeared to stop
short of an outright declaration that the Estonian parliament's
action was unconstitutional.
   It did not say when the meeting would take place, but presumably
it would be called before the next full meeting of the 1,500-member
national Supreme Soviet, which is scheduled for Nov. 29.
   Estonian officials were called to a meeting with President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev at the Presidium on Nov. 9. Kremlin officials
listened, but did not support their demands for greater autonomy.
Two days later Politburo members were sent to Estonia, Lithuania and
the third Baltic republic, Latvia, to preach restraint.
   Baltic residents are angry about proposed amendments to the
national constitution that they say takes away the republics' right
to secede and further strengthen central control rather than
encouraging the local control that Gorbachev stresses is necessary
for his reform movement to succeed.
   Tass announced that Lithuanian Supreme Soviet had begun its
meeting in the capital of Vilnius, where it was expected to take up
legislation similar to that passed in Tallinn, Estonia.
   The vote of 258-1, with five abstentions, on the declaration of
sovereignty in all areas except foreign and defense policy followed
a restrained, serious debate in the Estonian Supreme Soviet.
   The declaration calls for a treaty with Moscow that would
``determine the further status of Estonia in the composition of the
Soviet Union.''
   In 1940, the Soviet Union annexed the Baltic republics, which
have looked toward the West and rankled under Soviet control.
   Proponents of the Estonian action said it was consistent with
Gorbachev's calls for greater democratization and local control, and
with ritual declarations of autonomy for the republics contained in
the Soviet constitution.
   Marju Lauristen, a leader of the Estonian People's Front, a
nationalist mass movement, said Gorbachev might be angry at first.
   ``But when he thinks deeply, he'll think we've supported
perestroika more deeply than he expected. Moscow could have expected
worse,'' she said in an interview. Perestroika refers to Gorbachev's
plans for reforming the Soviet economy and society.
   The debate was televised from Tallinn's 18th century Toompea
Palace.
   Another approved amendments subjects new Soviet laws to local
control. If the Presidium, Estonia's top executive body, were to
reject a Soviet law that law would not take effect until the next
meeting of the republic's Supreme Soviet, said Igor Grazin, a law
professor who wrote the amemdment.
   If the parliament also rejects the law, it would be declared void
in Estonia, he said.
   The other four amendments add human and civil rights guarantees
and guarantee the right to hold private property.
   The passage of such measures by a government body is an
unprecedented act that defies central authorities in a country still
feeling its way through Gorbachev's policy of glasnost, or greater
openness.
   The Estonian parliament also called unanimously for changes in
proposed amendments to the Soviet constitution to lessen the shift
in power from the 15 Soviet republics to the Kremlin, and to retain
the republics' right to secede.
   The Soviet amendments, which would remove the republics' right to
secede, are scheduled for adoption Nov. 29.
   Estonian radio reported that 2.6 million people in the three
republics have signed petitions opposing the Soviet amendments. That
would represent nearly a third of the republics' combined population
a of 7.7 million.
   Estonian activists' strategy rests on the traditional claim of
the Soviet Union to be a federation of independent republics.

   A judge today acquitted three
people but said others in a trial involving leaders of the nation's
largest anti-apartheid group committed treason during township
uprisings, a crime punishable by death.
   The judgment by Supreme Court Justice Kees van Dijkhorst means
some of the 16 remaining defendants could face the death penalty.
The decision summed up a 3{-year trial involving members of the
United Democratic Front who were charged with treason, terrorism,
murder and subversion.
   Van Dijkhorst, in the third day of reading his 1,521-page
judgment, did not say which defendants were guilty of treason. The
verdicts against individual defendants might not be announced until
next week.
   All the defendants pleaded innocent to the charges, which related
to allegations the anti-apartheid front and its affiliates sought to
promote violence during unrest in black townships in 1984.
   The three most prominent defendants are senior front leaders who
were denied bail throughout the trial and have spent 40 months in
jail. They are Popo Molefe, 36, who was the group's national
secretary; Terror Lekota, 40, who was its publicity secretary; and
Moses Chikane, 40, who was secretary of its Transvaal Province
branch.
   Those acquitted today were the Rev. Geoff Motselane, 41; Oupa
Hlomuka, 35, and Patrick Baleka, 29. Unlike most of the defendants,
they were not closely linked in testimony to the front or to the
first wave of unrest in an area called the Vaal Triangle.
   The group was formed in 1983 to mobilize opposition to a new
constitution that created a three-chamber Parliament with
representation for every group except the black majority. The group
is now banned.
   Van Dijkhorst said that because violence was a necessary,
intended part of the uprising in the townships, the state had proved
the crime of treason.
   The charges of murder, which also carry a possible death penalty,
relate to the mob killings of black town council members during the
outbreak of the unrest in the townships south of Johannesburg.
   Van Dijkhorst noted that the violence began after President P.W.
Botha took the oath of office under the new constitution and the
tricameral Parliament was announced Sept. 2, 1984.
   He acknowledged that many people joined the anti-apartheid front
because they were disenchanted with the government, but said many
had ``closed their eyes,'' not wanting to know that their
aspirations for peaceful change could lead to revolt.
   Since the trial began, most of the front leaders who are not in
detention or in hiding have been restricted to their homes and
prohibited from making speeches, being quoted or participating in
any political activity.
   Before its banning in February, the front was the largest
opposition group in South Africa's history, encompassing more than
600 affiliated groups with about 2 million members.
   Van Dijkhorst said he agreed with prosecutors that the front was
supported and guided by the African National Congress, the biggest
guerrilla movement fighting South Africa's white-led government.
   The front has maintained that it endorsed the ANC's political
goals, such as a one-person, one-vote system, but did not approve of
violence.
   Originally, there were 22 defendants in the trial. Three other
men were acquitted in 1986.
   Van Dijkhorst has presided over the non-jury trial since its
start in June 1985 and has sole responsibility for the verdict and
sentencing.
   Under apartheid, the 26 million blacks have no vote in national
affairs. The 5 million whites control the economy and maintain
separate districts, schools and health services.

   The government today banned a
white supremacist group after a self-proclaimed white racist was
charged with shooting to death six blacks during a casual walk
through Pretoria.
   Barend Strydom, 23, was ordered to undergo treatment at a
psychiatric hospital after a court hearing, in which he appeared in
khaki clothes and leg irons.
   Strydom, a former policeman, smiled throughout the hearing before
Magistrate P. Johnson. He said he had no desire to cooperate with
the court.
   Later, the government banned the small White Liberation Movement,
the first time such action has been taken against a right-wing
group. Strydom has been linked to two extremist organizations,
including the large Afrikaner Resistance Movement, but not to the
White Liberation Movement.
   Both groups have swastika-type symbols and have expressed
sympathy for the Nazis.
   Law and Order Minister Adriaan Vlok imposed the ban under
national emergency regulations, which have also been used to ban 23
anti-apartheid organizations. He did not explain why the White
Liberation Movement in particular was outlawed.
   The Movement was formed in 1985 but did not come to public notice
until 1987. Its leader, Johan Schabort, said it has more than 1,000
members but many more sympathizers.
   He said the government's action reduced the ``outlet for
frustration of white South Africans. ... Now we cannot control
people who are worried about their race survival. Some of them could
organize underground.''
   Schabort, a biochemist, said his group supports banishment of all
Jewish and Indian South Africans to Israel or India and removal of
all blacks from white urban centers, including the ``clearing out''
of Soweto, home to 2.5 million blacks outside Johannesburg.
   He said the group does not support violence and added, ``I fully
blame the government for what happened in Pretoria on Tuesday.''
   ``Whites are living under tremendous pressure and are being
undermined by blacks,'' Schabort said.
   The shooting spree prompted government officials to promise a
broad crackdown on white extremists.
   Dr. Willem Pieterse, a court-appointed psychiatrist who examined
the suspect, said Strydom showed symptoms of being a psychopath and
had expressed pride in what he had done.
   Strydom was sent to Weskoppies Hospital for 30 days of
observation and ordered to reappear in court Dec. 19.
   He was charged with murdering six blacks and attempting to murder
17 as he walked, smiling and laughing, through downtown Pretoria
firing an automatic pistol.
   Speaking in Afrikaans, Strydom told the court, ``If communists
such as (Anglican Archbishop) Desmond Tutu and (former South African
ambassador to the United Kingdom) Dennis Worrall are arrested, then
I will cooperate.''
   Strydom frequently turned to wave at his family in the courtroom,
which was packed and guarded by policemen with shotguns. In an
unusual move, photographers were allowed inside.
   Nic Strydom, a retired policeman who is a member of the movement,
and another son were present, wearing business suits.
   Members of the movement frequently dress in khaki uniforms and
wear swastika-type emblems and weapons.
   Critics of the white minority government frequently have
questioned why right-wing white organizations which appear to
espouse violence are not banned while anti-apartheid organizations
are outlawed.
   A member of the governing National Party raised the question
again Wednesday. A government official said an investigation would
have to be conducted.
   Under apartheid, South Africa's 26 million blacks have not vote
in national affairs and the country's 5 million whites control the
economy and maintain separate residential districts, schools and
health services.

   Seals came off the barrels and corks popped all over
Paris today after the midnight embargo on consumption of this year's
Beaujolais nouveau expired.
   Thousands of Parisians braved the chill of the November night to
sip a glass of the wine whose annual export by jet, helicopter, boat
and truck to all corners of the world has boosted both image and
sales of the French viticulture industry.
   Outside Le Val d'Or wine bar near the Champs Elysees, two
220-liter barrels of the light red wine, specially chosen by owner
Geraud Rongier, were emptying fast.
   ``This year, it's good, very light, very perfumed,'' Rongier said.
   At other watering holes, waiters like Jean-Louis Ribolla said the
wine has the same aftertaste and aroma of banana as last year's
vintage.
   Le Figaro newspaper described this year's batch of Beaujolais as
``more nuanced, more subtle and more traditional than last year's.''
   Not all the French are seduced by what some maintain is media
hype of the annual uncorking meant to bluff foreigners. ``I never
drank the stuff before all this started and I still don't,'' growled
one seasoned customer.
   Beaujolais distributers work to perfect the near mythic annual
arrival of the wine, and some fretted Wednesday as a dock strike
held up 230 trucks with the precious cargo bound for Britain at
Calais. They were rerouted to Boulogne and Dunkirk.
   ``The paralysis of the port today (Wednesday) is a real disaster
for business and the image of the Beaujolais,'' said Henri Ravisse,
president of the Chamber of Commerce and Industry at Calais.
   Last year, 8 million bottles of Beaujolais crossed the Channel to
invade beer-based English pubs.
   One German driver bound for Dortmund in West Germany was
evidently convinced of the qualities of this year's harvest. He was
arrested as his truck laden with 20,000 bottles zigzaged down the
highway late Tuesday.
   The driver, who's name was not released, was banned from driving
in France for six months, police said.

   Populist leader Benazir Bhutto
defeated her right-wing opponents in Pakistan's first free national
elections in 11 years and today called on the president to let her
form the new government.
   In Wednesday's balloting, the voters gave ``a mandate for
democracy, dignity ... justice and technology,'' the 35-year-old
politician told reporters at her family villa in southern Sind
province.
   The U.S.-educated Ms. Bhutto would be the first woman to lead a
Moslem nation if she is chosen to form the government. Pakistan was
run by Gen. Mohammed Zia ul-Haq until his death Aug. 17 in a plane
crash.
   Ms. Bhutto's Pakistan People's Party captured 92 seats in the
237-member National Assembly, easily outpacing its main rival, the
right-wing Islamic Democratic Alliance, which won 55 seats.
   Independent candidates and minor parties captured 57 seats.
Results from 13 races were not available.
   The remaining 20 seats will be filled by women chosen by the
elected assembly members.
   Two of the Alliance's three major figures, including former Prime
Minister Mohammad Khan Junejo, were defeated by People's Party
candidates.
   About 30 political parties fielded candidates, but the campaign
boiled down to a race between the People's Party and the nine-party
Alliance, which includes loyalists of Zia.
   Ms. Bhutto said President Ghulam Ishaq Khan ``should now call
upon the PPP to form the government,'' which would allow her to
recapture the prime ministership her father lost in a 1977 coup.
   She said the People's Party had already started talking with
other left-leaning parties and said forming a governing coalition
would not be difficult.
   The country's Constitution requires Ishaq Khan to choose a prime
minister who will be ``most likely to command the confidence of the
majority of the National Assembly,'' but he is under no deadline to
act.
   Asked Wednesday whether he would be reluctant to designate a
woman as head of government of this male-dominated soceity, Ishaq
Khan replied: ``I think a woman prime minister might be a good
change.''
   The army pledged had not interfere in Wednesday's balloting and
thousands of soldiers and police were deployed for the election,
which was largely peaceful.
   Junejo, once the undisputed leader of the Alliance-dominating
Pakistan Muslim League, was defeated in his hometown of Sindhri by a
People's Party candidate.
   The chairman of the Alliance and leader of the center-right
National People's Party, Ghulam Mustafa Jatoi, lost to People's
Party candidates in both districts he contested.
   The Alliance's leading political strongman, Punjab chief minister
Nawaz Sharif, was assured a seat from Lahore.
   Ms. Bhutto, in a show of her personal popularity, won all three
seats she was contesting.
   Candidates could contest more than one seat to improve their
chance of election, but must forfeit all but one. The vacant seats
are contested later.
   While she monitored election results, about 5,000 supporters
gathered in the streets outside, dancing and chanting, ``Benazir,
prime minister.''
   Officials reported no major violence or fraud in the nationwide
balloting despite widespread fears of disruption. Newspapers today
reported three election-related deaths, but the incidents could not
be immediately confirmed.
   The election focused on political personalities.
   Ms. Bhutto's father was Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, whose government was
toppled by Zia in 1977. Zia had him hanged two years later.
   She proved a charismatic campaigner, drawing enthusiastic crowds
numbering in the tens of thousands throughout the country.
   Ms. Bhutto and the Alliance both pledged to continue close ties
with the United States, to support anti-communist guerrillas in
neighboring Afghanistan and to stick to Zia's program to make
Pakistan a more Islamic nation.
   But she said she would not allow the religious policy to harm
women's and minorities' rights. Considered very Westernized, she
studied at Harvard and Oxford.
   About 48 million of Pakistan's 107 million people were eligible
to vote and unofficial estimates said slightly more than half voted.
Illiterate millions chose their candidates by symbol, and men and
women voted separately, in keeping with strict Moslem practice.
   Zia ruled for eight years under martial law before holding
national elections in 1985. Ms. Bhutto's party and other opposition
groups boycotted those polls, allowing a sweep by candidates who
barely hid their ties to the Muslim League.
   The league formed a government under Junejo, but Zia abruptly
fired the Junejo Cabinet in May and dissolved the National Assembly,
accusing them of corruption, incompetence and dragging their feet on
Islamization.
   Several Muslim League members stayed on in a Zia-appointed
caretaker government.
   Zia called Wednesday's elections before he died in a plane crash
that also killed the U.S. ambassador and 28 other people. The cause
of the crash has not yet been determined.

   A Bonn court today aquitted a former
Nazi Gestapo chief accused in the deportation of 177 French Jews who
died in Auschwitz, a court official said.
   Several French spectators called out ``murder!'' and ``Nazi
court!'' after the verdict was read, said court spokeswoman Eva
Marie Zakosek-Ruehling.
   Count Modest Korff, 79, was a Nazi SS captain and served as
Gestapo chief in the Chalons-sur-Marne region in northeastern France
in 1942 and 1943.
   His trial started in September 1987 after an investigation into
the deportation and death of 220 Jews from the region under Korff's
control. A court spokesman, Freimold Gundlach, said the charges were
reduced to cover 177 cases, but he did not know the reason.
   Ms. Zakosek-Ruehling said the defendant was allowed to live at
his Bonn home during the trial, which was conducted before two
jurors and three judges.
   Korff worked as a ministerial adviser in the West German
Economics Ministry until his retirement in the early 1970s. He was
unmasked by French Nazi hunter Serge Klarsfeld.
   During the trial, Korff claimed he did not know about the
extermination of Jews when he was the Gestapo chief. An estimated 6
million Jews died in the Holocaust during the 1933-45 Nazi rule.
   The court based its acquittal on insufficient evidence, Ms.
Zakosek-Ruehling told The Associated Press by telephone.
   About 70 people crowded into the courtroom to hear the verdict,
Ms. Zakosek-Ruehling said.
   Ms. Zakosek-Ruehling said that Klarsfeld, who attended the
proceeding, walked out of the courtroom along with the protesters
and there were no arrests.

   A man who masqueraded as the Prince of
Morocco at a high school and once rented a limousine to carry him to
a school football game has been charged with receiving stolen
property _ the sporty red car he drove to class.
   Michael W. Taylor, who is actually 27 or 28, enrolled as
17-year-old Prince Sparkle Shannon on the third day of classes at
Meadowdale High School, affecting a foreign accent. He was polite,
punctual and shy, school officials said.
   ``He fit in well,'' Principal Ben Kirby said. ``He dressed like a
student, acted like a student. In terms of behavior, I could have
used a few hundred more Prince Sparkles.''
   Taylor was the subject of an article in the school newspaper and
recently told student leaders that he would inherit the Moroccan
throne when King Hassan II died. Taylor also said he had studied
with the KGB in the Soviet Union.
   Taylor, who was enrolled as a senior, dressed in the latest
fashions, with gold around his neck and a large diamond on his
finger, school officials said. He shunned school buses in favor of
his red 1988 Dodge Daytona.
   The Louisville, Ky., man was arrested Wednesday and jailed on
$7,500 bond. Kentucky authorities planned to go before a grand jury
today with more than 50 counts of fraud and related crimes,
investigators said.
   Police believe Taylor used another man's name when he bought the
car in Louisville, said Montgomery County sheriff's detective Bob
Weaver. Weaver said the theft was discovered when the other man
protested a bill received for the car.
   ``When we confronted him with the name Mike Taylor, he knew we
had him so he basically admitted that it was him,'' Weaver said.
``And that accent cleared up real fast.''

   President Reagan's final budget will propose
ending some government programs and switching to a two-year budget
cycle, the White House said today.
   Spokesman Marlin Fitzwater declined to say what ``low priority
programs'' are under consideration to be eliminated.
   He said the budget would call for no new taxes, would not
``tamper with Social Security'' and would include a defense spending
buildup that does more than just keep up with inflation.
   He said the proposal would meet the deficit reduction of the
Gramm-Rudman deficit-reduction act, which would mean reductions of
at least $32 billion to reduce the fiscal 1989 budget to $100
billion.
   Fitzwater said the budget is aimed at achieving a balanced budget
by fiscal 1993.
   He said the review of agency budgets by the Office of Management
and Budget would be completed this week and the OMB proposals would
then be submitted to the agencies, which will have a right of appeal
from the budget office decisions before the White House takes the
budget proposal to Congress, which has the final say in that it must
appropriate money to run the government.

   A 10-foot rocket bearing four
experiments made a five-minute flight today in what was touted as
the first truly private, commercial space flight.
   The rocket, dwarfed by larger space rockets launched here, burned
its motor for only 4.4 seconds as it pushed the payload container to
an altitude of about 14,000 feet, or less than three miles. The
launch took place at 7:30 a.m.
   The payload was later recovered from the Atlantic Ocean even
though the main parachute on the rocket failed to open.
   E'Prime Aerospace Co. of Titusville hopes the rocket, LOFT-1,
will lead to investor interest in the company so that it eventually
can buy bigger rockets and establish a commercial launch service.
   Stockholders and potential investors were among the 200 people
who watched the liftoff.
   Company officials admit they have a long way to go. They had to
delay the maiden launch a year to meet financial, safety, technical
and government requirements.
   The so-called ``commercialization of space,'' to bring the
private sector into the launching of satellites and other space
activity, has been a major goal of the Reagan admininstration.
   E'Prime paid the Air Force $24,000 for use of an old weather
rocket launch pad and some support services. The company also had to
buy $1 million in liability insurance to cover any damage to Air
Force property.
   It was the first time a privately owned rocket had been launched
from either Air Force or NASA facilities here.
   E'Prime operations director Jim Mizell said the experiments on
board the flight were from paying customers. He declined to say how
much they had paid except to say that it was not enough to make the
flight profitable. He estimated the total the fledgling company has
spent up to this point at $200,000.
   In trying to attract investors, E'Prime billed the flight as the
``first truly commercial space flight.'' But by E'Prime's own
definition, space starts 75 miles up. And Space Services Inc., a
commercial launch company in Houston, sent up a rocket six years
ago, although it did not carry commercial cargo.
   Though the main chute did not open during the flight, Mizell
reported that the smaller parachute broke the fall and divers
recovered the floating 30-pound package about two miles offshore.
They reported it appeared to be undamaged.
   LOFT-1, which stands for Launch Operations Flight Test, carried a
biology experiment from a Huntsville, Ala., high school; a thin-film
polymer experiment from Morton Thiokol Inc. and Utah State
University; a flight monitoring system for measuring acceleration
and temperature from QSI Corp. and Weber State College in Utah, and
a data collection and telemetry system from the University of
Alabama at Huntsville.

   Americans hoping to live tobacco-free were determined to butt out
of smoking today in the 12th annual Great American Smokeout as
celebrities stressed the message: You're a fool if you think smoking
is cool.
   ``I started smoking at 14 because I thought it was chic,'' said
actress Celeste Holm, who with other stars at New York City's
Lincoln Center on Wednesday urged participation in the smokeout.
   ``I didn't know it would kill you. Now we know better.''
   Anti-smokers around the country prepared for the big snuff-out,
which attempts to coax puffers to say, ``Enough!'' _ at least for a
day.
   In Nebraska, a sheriff said he wanted to ``arrest smoking,''
newborn babies in Seattle and Council Bluffs, Iowa, were adorned
with anti-smoking T-shirts and the operator of the trans-Alaska oil
pipeline tried to convince people that it's no joke to smoke.
   ``The Great American Smokout proves that you have freedom of
choice to start smoking but you don't have freedom of choice to stop
smoking and by people trying to quit for 24 hours, they realize that
they are addicted to a very dangerous drug,'' Surgeon General C.
Everett Koop said today on ``CBS This Morning.''
   ``They realize that they are addicted to a very dangerous drug
and they know it's not a dirty habit that they can kick and they
need some professional help.''
   New to the smokeout this year is the ``Back a Quitter'' program.
Backers act as buddies to the smokers for the day. By soliciting
pledges from co-workers for every hour they go without a cigarette,
the smokers also will raise funds for the American Cancer Society.
   The American Cancer Society, which sponsors the event, estimated
nearly 40 percent of the nation's 50 million smokers participated
last year.
   ``Here's our answer to a pack-a-day _ a pachyderm!'' shouted
ringmaster Paul Binder in New York as one of two cigarette-smashing
elephants stomped a Styrofoam butt to promote the smokeout at New
York's ``Big Apple Circus.''
   ``I bet if you could show people who don't smoke have a much
better sex life, most people would quit today,'' said Dr. Ruth
Westheimer, the sex therapist who managed a smile despite the
elephant trunks swinging over her. ``So let's pretend that's true.''
   In Nebraska, Sheriff Ron Tussing, who lost both of his parents to
smoking-related illnesses, said he wanted to put the cuffs on
smoking, while employees at Gibbon Packing Inc. were signing up as
quitters and as backers.
   At Swedish Hospital in Seattle, spokeswoman Abbi Kaplan said
newborns at the hospital were going to wear ``I'm a Born
Non-Smoker'' T-shirts today.
   In Jackson, Miss., a three-day lung testing workshop was under
way. On Wednesday, the first day of the testing, several hundred
people showed up.
   The operator of the trans-Alaska oil pipeline was putting Great
American Smokeout materials at the line's pump stations today,
urging people to nix nicotine.
   Alyeska Pipeline Service Co. also planned to provide a free lunch
for people participating in the stop-smoking event.
   In Massachusetts, state health officials unveiled a plan
Wednesday to counter the appeal of cigarettes to teen-agers and make
all state businesses smoke-free, except in designated areas, by 1995.
   Public Health Commissioner Deborah Prothrow-Stith said the
anti-smoking plan calls for expanded education to inform children
about the dangers of tobacco, a mass media campaign to counter more
than $50 million spent in Massachusetts each year on cigarette
advertising, a ban on free samples of tobacco products and
restrictions on smoking in schools, health facilities and businesses.
   The Tobacco Institute, meanwhile, officially announced its
``Great American Welcome'' program in newspaper advertisements
Tuesday, but a spokesman said that program was not planned as a
rebuttal to the smokeout.
   ``We're not really doing anything to counter the smokeout,'' said
Gary Miller, assistant to the president of the Tobacco Institute in
Washington.
   The institute's program is ``aimed at businesses that believe
that smokers and non-smokers are welcome valuable customers to
accommodate and who want make your experience with them enjoyable,''
he said.
   Tuesday's ad invites people to call a toll-free number to find
businesses nationwide that are a part of the program.
   Other celebrities at the New York event Wednesday included
composer Marvin Hamlisch, actress Sylvia Miles, actor Christopher
Plummer, and current Broadway stars Ellen Foley, Dean Butler and
Alison Fraser.
   Hamlisch urged smokers unconcerned about their health to think
about their friends and family, citing the recent death of his
friend and ``A Chorus Line'' collaborator Edward Kleban. The
lyricist, a heavy smoker, died of cancer last December.
   ``When you lose someone to cancer because of something they can
control, it really hurts a lot, because it didn't have to be that
way,'' said Hamlisch, who has never smoked.
   No large events were scheduled in Winston-Salem, N.C., in the
heart of the nation's largest tobacco-growing region. One year, the
Forsyth County official of the cancer society set up anti-smoking
booths.
   ``It was very traumatic for the volunteers. ... People came by
and blew smoke at them and let them know they weren't welcome,''
said a society spokeswoman who refused to be identified. ``I don't
want to ask them to go through that again.''

   The nation's Roman Catholic bishops concluded
their annual meeting today with formal pleas for religious liberty
in Eastern Europe and for the easing of a law covering legal status
for undocumented Hispanic workers in the United States.
   Archbishop Roger Mahony of Los Angeles said the bishops were
challenging Soviet leaders, whose policies have heavy influence
throughout Eastern Europe, ``to match their recent talk of reform
with concrete action.''
   Despite improvements in some countries, the church leaders said
in their statement, ``A general pattern of intolerance of religion
remains clearly evident.''
   As for Hispanic workers, the bishops said in a separate statement
that there is widespread discrimination in this country, partly
because employers don't understand immigration rules concerning whom
they can or can't hire.
   The bishops said they are compiling files of discrimination cases
in hopes of persuading lawmakers to rewrite the law.
   One day earlier, the bishops politely but firmly told the Vatican
to go back and start over on its document questioning the authority
of national bishops conferences such as theirs.
   And, far from expecting an angry reaction from Rome, one of the
bishops' leaders says he expects Vatican officials to do as the
American churchmen are asking.
   About 100 such conferences around the world were asked to comment
on the Vatican draft, and Bishop James Malone of Youngstown, Ohio,
said Wednesday that many of them seem to be ``expressing opinions
similar to ours.'' In response, the Vatican will likely work up a
new draft, he said, though the bishops are not predicting what it
might say.
   The U.S. bishops voted 205-59 earlier Wednesday _ barely meeting
the required two-thirds of the conference's 305 active members _ to
reject the Vatican draft.
   Before the vote, they softened the tone of their rejection notice
considerably. But they stood firm when Cardinal Bernard Law of
Boston and several other bishops tried to amend the response even
further, so it would merely ask for more work on the Vatican draft
rather than a new start.
   ``Half a loaf is better than none,'' Law said.
   Malone's committee of past conference presidents was first to
give ground, withdrawing the original version of the bishops'
response on Monday, the first day of the church leaders' annual
meeting.
   Suddenly gone from the bishops' proposed description of the
Vatican draft were such phrases as ``rigid and confusing'' and
``overly defensive and negative.''
   Then Wednesday, by voice vote, the bishops deleted these words:
``non placet _ the draft is not suitable.'' Several bishops had
argued that the phrase, especially the formal Latin, was too blunt,
perhaps even offensive to the Vatican.
   Still, the final version says elsewhere, ``We do not believe that
the working document is suitable as a basis for discussion.''
   The first version had received considerable news coverage, and
some bishops have criticized the accounts as too negative.
   However, Archbishop John Roach of St. Paul-Minneapolis, a member
of Malone's committee, said, ``They perceived a sharpness in the
tone of the document which I don't think we intended'' and helped
spur the bishops to write a better response to the Vatican.
   The American bishops' most controversial efforts _ their national
pastoral letters taking issue with Reagan administration policies on
nuclear weapons and on treatment of the poor _ have won public
praise from Pope John Paul II.
   However, the rising prominence of such conferences has also
brought criticism from Vatican officials, who note that such
organizations are not part of the Roman church's traditional
hierarchy.
   The Vatican draft declares that bishops conferences have little
real standing, that the church lodges authority in the individual
bishops under the pope, the bishop of Rome.
   The U.S. bishops, in their reply, do not lay out a case arguing
that the Vatican is wrong. Rather, they argue that the draft
distorts some evidence and generally gives only one side of the
matter.
   On another topic, the bishops also voted Wednesday to set
guidelines on preaching by lay men and women during Catholic masses.
   Several bishops said the guidelines could lead to more such
preaching. But others noted that they reiterated clear strictures
against anyone other than an ordained minister preaching the main
sermon interpreting the gospel during mass.
   Retired Bishop William McManus of Fort Wayne-South Bend, Ind.,
argued that the guidelines restating that implicit ban on some
preaching by women _ who cannot be ordained as Catholic ministers _
would be an unnecessary new ``source of irritation'' for the
denomination's women.
   He offered what he described as the ridiculous possibility that a
local church would have Mother Teresa as its guest but could allow
her to speak only early in the service or at the very end, leaving
the main sermon to a male deacon parroting ``Bible lessons he
learned in the second grade.''

   Chancellor Helmut Kohl today
indicated that Washington's demand that its NATO allies shoulder a
greater defense burden may run into widespread resentment in Western
Europe.
   Kohl, a staunch U.S. supporter, has in recent weeks been
emphasizing that the West Germans are not eager to take on greater
financial burdens within the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.
   In a speech to the North Atlantic Assembly, an independent body
of lawmakers from the 16 NATO nations, Kohl extended that message
somewhat to include other Alliance allies in Western Europe.
   ``We are all agreed it is not satisfactory to busy ourselves with
extensive account ledgers in order to prove our achievements to one
another,'' Kohl said in the keynote speech to the assembly's plenary
session.
   ``I only have to mention that besides the German army, more than
400,000 soldiers of our allies are stationed in this densely
populated land,'' Kohl said.
   But he added, ``We should also not overtax one another and
thereby conjure up the danger that acceptance of the alliance could
be damaged.''
   Many U.S. officials maintain that West European NATO members are
not shouldering their fair share of the expense.
   West Germans argue that other kinds of national contributions to
NATO besides financial considerations should also be taken into
account. They cite as an example putting up with the noise and
intrusiveness of military hardware and soldiers on their territory.
   In his address, Kohl referred to the ``heavy burden on our people
from low-level flights'' by NATO pilots based in West Germany.
   Kohl called for strengthening the ``European pillar,'' referring
to assembly proposals for an exclusively European division of troops.
   ``Europe cannot demand the presence of American troops if it
cannot provide its own substantial contribution,'' Kohl said.
   But he added that ``the security of Europe, also in the future,
depends decisively on the American counterbalance'' to the Soviet
Union's military strength.
   Kohl called on the Soviet Union to ``orient its military presence
(in Eastern Europe) on the needs for self-defense'' and for lower
conventional-force levels.
   He referred also to the Soviet bloc's ``drastic superiority ...
in the area of nuclear short-range weapons.''
   Kohl said the Warsaw Pact and NATO should include these weapons
in future disarmament negotiations.
   Kohl also said he rejects removing nuclear weapons completely
from Western Europe because of the continued numerical superiority
of Warsaw Pact forces.

<HEAD>Judge Says Embezzling Teller Played Robin Hood</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former bank employee who admitted
embezzling $14,000 said she gave part of the money to needy families
who were denied bank loans.
   Sharon Granstaff Morgan, 21, was placed on five years' probation
Wednesday for stealing in 1986-87 from Commerce Union Bank, where
she was in charge of issuing travelers checks and savings bonds. She
pleaded guilty to embezzlement Sept. 9.
   ``You just ran a private charity, Ms. Morgan,'' said U.S.
District JUdge Thomas A. Wiseman Jr. ``You took from the bank and
gave to these families, thinking you were Robin Hood.''
   Ms. Morgan told Wiseman she gave money to two needy families who
had been denied bank loans. Defense attorney Bill Farmer said the
gifts constituted a ``substantial'' portion of what she took and
that the families needed groceries and clothing.
   ``It's a commendable trait to want to help people,'' the judge
said, ``but you can't buy friendships.''
   Ms. Morgan claimed to have stolen about $14,000; bank officials
said she cost them $27,650. Wiseman ordered her to repay $19,500. He
also ordered her to perform fours hours a week of community service
work for a year.
   ``She took money from what people paid her to buy travelers'
checks and savings bonds, destroyed records, turned in falsified
amounts to American Express and the bank and simply kept the
money,'' said Assistant U.S. Attorney Wendy Goggin.

   A masked gunman in black terrorized a coin
dealer and his family and then shot and killed the man as he tried
to flee, authorities said.
   The gunman handcuffed and blindfolded Roy A. Edwards, his wife,
Irene, and two daughters Tuesday night, and assaulted all four, said
Lt. Jack Dempsey of the Morris County prosecutor's office. Dempsey
gave no other details on the assaults.
   One daughter was hospitalized.
   Officials said they believe the robber singled out the home,
where Edwards ran a part-time coin dealership, because he asked for
coins. Authorities said they have no suspects but believe the gunman
knew the family's daily routine.
   Edwards, 43, was shot in the neck and died instantly after he
bolted from the upstairs bedroom, where the family had been tied up,
and ran downstairs and into the back yard, Dempsey said. Mrs.
Edwards then began screaming for help.
   ``I heard a commotion,'' said Marv Vandenberg, who was walking
his dogs. ``I got down on the corner and heard heard `Help me!' I
proceeded up (the street). I could hear her scream again. She said,
`Somebody's attacking my husband!'''
   The robber got away with $700 from Mrs. Edwards' purse, Dempsey
said.
   The couple's 9-year-old daughter, Ilene, was listed in stable
condition today at Morristown Memorial Hospital. Mrs. Edwards and
the other daughter, Deidra, 7, were treated at the hospital and
released.

<HEAD>US Welcomes Hanoi Proposal To Open MIA Offices in Vietnam</HEAD>
<BYLINE>BY BARRY SCHWEID</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The State Department welcomed today a
suggestion by Hanoi for the opening of U.S. offices in Vietnam to
gather information about Americans missing in action in the
Indochina war.
   However, Nancy Beck, a press officer, said the senior Vietnamese
official who announced the proposal had not transmitted it formally
to the U.S. government during a recent private visit to the country.
   And the U.S. official said Vietnamese government adviser Nguyen
Xuan Oanh had not met with State Department officials.
   Even so, Ms. Beck said, ``the United States is prepared to
consider any formal proposals that the Vietnamese government may
have in resolving this pressing humanitarian problem.''
   Oanh told reporters Wednesday in Bangkok, Thailand, that ``we
need to get to the bottom of this matter, and I think this is the
only way. We let this go on too long for anyone's good.''
   He said he had conveyed the proposal from Vietnamese Foreign
Minister Nguyen Co Thach to the State Department and congressmen
during his recent trip to the United States and found an
``enthusiastic'' response.
   ``The ball is now in your (American) court. You play it,'' Oanh
said in response to whether the MIA offices would be opened.
   Oanh, an economic advisor to Vietnamese leader Nguyen Van Linh,
said the offices _ set up and manned by Americans _ would gather
information on the fates of U.S. servicemen still unaccounted-for
from the war. The number of offices and locations would be worked
out at a later date, he said.
   In recent months, stepped-up cooperation between Vietnam and the
United States on the MIA issue has included a joint search in
northern Vietnam and the hand-over by Hanoi Nov. 3 of 23 remains
believed to be those of American war dead.
   More than 2,300 Americans are still listed as MIAs from the wars
in Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia. Washington has cited this issue and
the Vietnamese military presence in Cambodia as key impediments to
normalized relations between the onetime foes.
   Hoping to broaden its international contacts and shore up its
devastated economy, Hanoi has been seeking diplomatic ties and the
lifting of a U.S. trade embargo.

   A landlady suspected in the deaths of
seven tenants whose bodies were unearthed in the yard of her
boardinghouse was returned here today, hours after her arrest in a
Los Angeles motel room.
   Dorothea Montalvo Puente, 59, accompanied by Sacramento
detectives, arrived in handcuffs at Executive Airport and was taken
to the Police Department for questioning. She ignored reporters'
questions as she crossed the tarmac.
   ``I have not killed anyone. I told you that. I have not killed
anyone. The checks I cashed, yes,'' she told KCRA-TV before landing
in Sacramento.
   It was not immediately known when she would be arraigned.
   Puente was taken into custody after a five-day hunt Wednesday
night by police who tracked her on a tip provided to a TV station.
   ``She was real cool, real calm. It looked like she almost
expected it,'' said Officer Paul Von Lutzow.
   Police believe Puente killed tenants of her Sacramento boarding
house for their Social Security benefits. They have a list of two
dozen people who are missing and who might have lived at the
eight-bedroom house at one time or another.
   Police tracked her to the Royal Viking Motel on the basis of a
tip provided to CBS by a disabled pensioner who met her in a bar and
took a liking to her, said CBS assignment editor Gene Silver.
   Von Lutzow, who said the woman identified herself using an alias,
Donna Johansen, told The Associated Press that the man who alerted
the news media had made a date to go shopping with her today.
   ``During a lengthy conversation, she told him she was from the
San Francisco area and he put two-and-two together and called,'' Von
Lutzow said.
   ``He wanted me to wait until the next day because he had a date
with her,'' Von Lutzow said.
   The man, Charles Willgues, 67, of Los Angeles, said today in an
interview that he became suspicious after Puente quizzed him about
his Social Security benefits.
   ``She seemed so nice and sincere. She really was very
believable,'' Willgues said, adding that she also had suggested that
they live together.
   ``I kept looking at the woman. Something just didn't seem right.
I felt like I had seen her before,'' he added, explaining why he
called the TV station.
   The white-haired Puente, clad in a red jacket and pink house
dress, bowed her head as officers walked her to a patrol car. She
declined to answer any reporters' questions, but appeared somewhat
dazed.
   Puente, who has a criminal record dating back to a 1948
conviction for forging checks, has been charged only with the murder
of Alvaro Montoya, 52, a mentally disabled transient who lived in
the house. His disappearance caused Volunteers of America counselor
Judy Moise to contact police, leading to the diggings.
   She had not been seen since Saturday, when police allowed her to
walk away from the house while they dug for bodies. State and
federal authorities had been searching for her in Mexico, where she
has relatives, and Las Vegas as well as California.
   One former tenant, Homer Myers, told reporters Wednesday that he
and other tenants unknowingly heled Puente dispose of the bodies by
digging the makeshift graves.
   Myers, 74, said Puente first asked him to dig a hole in the back
yard for an apricot tree.
   ``She said she had contacted a nursery and they told her she
needed a hole that was four feet by four feet and five feet deep. I
thought that was a little deep. Now I know why.''
   Digging was completed at the boarding house yard Tuesday and
police searched the inside of the blue house. Detectives removed
several items from the house, but would not say what evidence was
found other than the seven bodies.
   Kearns said there has been no decision whether to dig at any
other sites, including a house several blocks away where Puente
lived several years ago.
   The coroner's office, assisted by several forensic
anthropologists, is still in the process of identifying the bodies
and performing autopsies to determine cause of death.

   Negotiators were meeting here today to discuss
Israel's return of a sorely disputed strip of sand along its border
with Egypt.
   Legal experts from Israel, Egypt and the United States are
seeking to implement a Sept. 29 decision by an international
arbitration panel, which ruled that Israel must give back the
250-acre Taba enclave at the northern tip of the Red Sea.
   Israel captured the land when it took the Sinai Peninsula in the
1967 Middle East war. All of the desert peninsula was given back in
1982 in accordance with the U.S.-mediated peace agreement between
Israel and Egypt, but Israel laid claim to Taba and refused to cede.
   The United States has been mediating negotiations between the
sides which led to the dispute being submitted to the Geneva-based
arbitration panel in 1987.
   The five-member panel awarded Egypt some key border points but
said it was not authorized to determine the final demarcation line

   That issue, as well as the fate of a popular Israeli-owned beach
resort at Taba, are being discussed here. The talks began Wednesday

   One of the possibilities under discussion is for Egypt to pay
compensation to the owner of the Avia Sonesta Hotel, as it did for
several hotels left behind in other parts of the Sinai. Israeli
nationalists are demanding that Israel raze the hotel.
   Talks on implementing the ruling were supposed to start last
month, but the United States reportedly persuaded Egypt to hold off
until after the Nov. 1 Israeli elections to avoid stirring up
nationalist fervor. The elections gave a victory to right-wing Prime
Minister Yitzhak Shamir, who is expected to form a coalition
government with ultra-nationalist and orthodox parties.
   The United States is being represented by State Department legal
adviser Abraham Sofaer. Israel's representative is chief Foreign
Ministry legal adviser Robert Sable; Egypt is represented by

   The Associated Press and others reported Tuesday that Bush had
settled on Sununu, 49, a blunt-spoken three-term governor, to run
the White House, passing over transition co-chairman Craig L.
Fuller. Fuller has been chief of Bush's vice presidential staff for
the past four years.
   Bush told reporters today to ``stay tuned'' but refused to say
whether he would make Sununu's appointment official or make any
other announcements.
   ``I don't know,'' he said. ``Maybe so, but I'm not sure.
   For his part, Sununu refused to confirm at a new conference in
Concord on Wednesday that Bush has tapped him for White House chief
of staff.
   ``A request isn't a formal request until the tall thin guy
sings,'' Sununu said. ``And the tall thin guy hasn't sung publicly,
and therefore I'm not going to comment.''

<HEAD>Americans, Egyptians and Israelis Discussing Return Of Border Strip</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Negotiators were meeting here today to discuss
Israel's return of a sorely disputed strip of sand along its border
with Egypt.
   Legal experts from Israel, Egypt and the United States are
seeking to implement a Sept. 29 decision by an international
arbitration panel, which ruled that Israel must give back the
250-acre Taba enclave at the northern tip of the Red Sea.
   Israel captured the land when it took the Sinai Peninsula in the
1967 Middle East war. All of the desert peninsula was given back in
1982 in accordance with the U.S.-mediated peace agreement between
Israel and Egypt, but Israel laid claim to Taba and refused to cede.
   The United States has been mediating negotiations between the
sides which led to the dispute being submitted to the Geneva-based
arbitration panel in 1987.
   The five-member panel awarded Egypt some key border points but
said it was not authorized to determine the final demarcation line
between the two countries.
   That issue, as well as the fate of a popular Israeli-owned beach
resort at Taba, are being discussed here. The talks began Wednesday
and are not expected to conclude today.
   One of the possibilities under discussion is for Egypt to pay
compensation to the owner of the Avia Sonesta Hotel, as it did for

   Bush had shrugged off repeated questions about his reported
choice of Sununu, which cheered conservatives but worried some
others including Jewish lobbyists still upset with the New Hampshire
governor for being the only governor to refuse to endorse a
proclamation attacking a 1975 U.N. resolution that equated zionism
with racism.
   Sununu, who is Arab-American, told reporters in Concord Wednesday
he refused to sign the proclamation because he felt ``it was
inappropriate for a governor to try to ... influence foreign
policy.''
   Sununu has a reputation for being a quick study, highly
intelligent and assertive. Some regard him as as arrogant and
abrasive, traits that could hurt him in working with Congress. He
made light of that reputation Wednesday when asked to describe his
managerial skills.
   ``I am what I am _ a warm, charming effective manager who by the
skills of gentle encouragement of individuals ... has been able to
do a few good things for the state of New Hampshire,'' he said.
   Sununu had declined to run for a fourth term, citing a need to
return to ``the real world to get a real job.'' Sununu and his wife,
Nancy, have eight children. He is credited with helping revive
Bush's candidacy with a win in the New Hampshire primary last
February after the vice president finished a poor third in Iowa's
caucuses.
   Sources also said Atwater was a strong contender to take over
chairmanship of the RNC from Fahrenkopf, a 48-year-old Reno lawyer
whose seven years in the post make him the longest-serving GOP chief
in this century.
   Atwater, 37, was a chief architect of Bush's winning campaign. A
South Carolina native, Atwater was a White House aide to President
Reagan and also worked for Sen. Strom Thurmond of South Carolina.

<HEAD>Warning Label Would Note Danger of Bleeding</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Food and Drug Administration today proposed
new labeling requirements for aspirin that would caution pregnant
women against taking the popular pain reliever during the last three
months of pregnancy because of the threat of bleeding.
   It is similar to the warning already required for ibuprofen, a
pain reliever introduced in 1974 and marketed under such names as
Advil and Nuprin.
   The aspirin warning would say: ``IMPORTANT: Do not take this
product during the last three months of pregnancy unless directed by
a doctor. Aspirin taken near the time of delivery may cause bleeding
problems in both mother and child.''
   In a related move, the agency proposed to expand a warning on
acetaminophen products, such as Tylenol and Anacin-3, that alerts
consumers to the need for prompt medical attention in the case of
overdose even if there are no immediate symtoms.
   The proposal published in the Federal Register was the first
stage in a process that technically could drag out for about a year
before the new labeling would be formally required.
   As a practical matter, however, aspirin manufacturers are likely
to start using the labeling earlier because there is little
likelihood the requirement will not be made mandatory eventually.

   A boy who hailed a win by the hometown team and
another who spoke of the ``quest for knowledge'' were among the
first earthlings to try to reach out and touch extraterrestrial
beings today via ``space phones.''
   Using free phones set up through Saturday in the atrium of AT&T
headquarters, the public will have a chance to communicate with
someone who could hear their voice long after they're dead, said
AT&T spokesman Brian Monahan.
   About 30 hours of recorded audio-visual messages will be beamed
to outer space by the telephone company's satellite dishes from
Thanksgiving to New Year's during the early morning hours when they
aren't being used for business.
   Among the first to send messages were students from Manhattan's
Clinton School, whose pronouncements to the aliens ranged from the
poignant to the silly.
   ``I hope the quest for knowledge lasts forever,'' said Kiernan
Varas, 13, a member of the Young Astronauts of America. He explained
later that he was concerned about the damage that drugs are doing to
the world. ``I hope ... they don't get stupid like us.''
   Like most of the youngsters, Kiernan said he believed it's highly
probable that someone would see or hear his message.
   If so, the aliens will receive an up-to-date basketball report
from Moises Bermudez, 13. His message: ``I hope you saw the Knicks
versus the Bullets, because the Knicks won.''
   Moises said later: ``I don't think there are UFOs, but maybe
there is a life form out there. But it's probably used to its
environment, so how could it visit us here on earth?''
   Monahan said AT&T has 30-meter dishes across the country aimed at
communications satellites, and one or two would be realigned to beam
the radio waves.
   ``They're very powerful,'' he said. ``We're gonna crank these
up.''
   The messages will travel at the speed of light in a straight line
until they run into something, Monahan said.
   ``I think it appeals to the imagination _ the idea of hurtling
messages at the speed of light,'' he said. ``And, of course, it's
free, so if people don't get a call back they won't be upset.''
   The so-called ``space phones'' are not the first high-tech
attempt to communicate with possible extraterrestrials. When the
Voyager spacecraft was launched in 1977, it carried a digital record
of 118 photographs of Earth, 90 minutes of the world's greatest
music and greetings in almost 60 human languages and one whale
language.
   But what is new and exciting about this latest communication
effort is that it is the first time non-scientists will send
messages into space, Monahan said.
   The messages are recorded as callers speak for 30 seconds into a
microphone while being filmed by a television camera, he said.
   ``We thought it would be fascinating to find out what people
would say if they had a chance to leave a message long after they
were gone,'' said Monahan. ``We expect to get some very serious
thoughts on life, people's hopes, possibly for the coming year but
also for the future of the universe.''
   But more earthly concerns about boyfriends and girlfriends are
also expected to be popular topics, he said. ``We will send every
message we get. We'd only edit out something that might be extremely
vulgar.''
   The first day of AT&T's ``Call the Universe'' program coincided
with the opening of its newest phone center at the company's
headquarters and the 25th anniversary of its introduction of
push-button phones.
   As part of today's celebration, Michael Collins, a veteran of the
Gemini and Apollo space missions, Terry Hart, a mission specialist
on a flight of the space shuttle Challenger, and New York Mets
pitcher Ron Darling were invited to appear and talk to the
long-distance callers.

<HEAD>Albanians Stage Mass Protest Of Albanian Leaders' Replacement</HEAD>
<HEAD>RETRANSMITTING a0588 to ADD paragraph mark</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Thousands of Albanian miners put down
their tools and marched to the provincial capital of Kosovo today to
protest the resignations of the top two Albanian leaders in the
ethnically divided area.
   The flag-waving procession swept aside a cordon of about 20 riot
police on the outskirts of the capital, Pristina, and ignored pleas
by local Communist officials to return to Titova Mitrovica, 30 miles
away.
   Kacusa Jasari, the president of Kosovo's Communist Party,
announced her resignation during a meeting to discuss personnel
changes in the provincial leadership, the state-run Tanjug news
agency said. It must be approved by the party presidium.
   Jasari said Azem Vlasi will no longer be a member of Kosovo's
presidium because of a recent federal decision that prohibits
Central Committee members from membership in local party bodies,
Tanjug said.
   Vlasi, the former provincial party president, is a member of the
national party's Central Committee.
   The two Albanian leaders have been the main target of resignation
demands by Serbia's communist party chief, Slobodan Milosevic, in
his drive to bring Kosovo under tighter Serbian control.
   Although administratively part of Serbia, Kosovo enjoys wide
autonomy under the constitution adopted under the late Josip Broz
Tito. Serbs claim they are harassed by the Albanian majority.
   The marching miners carried pictures of Tito. The protest,
involving about 4,000, was believed to be the largest by ethnic
Albanians since ethnic riots in 1981 left at least nine people dead
in Pristina.
   The Pristina meeting, described as crucial by the Belgrade press,
was convened after severe criticism of Kosovo's mostly ethnic
Albanian leadership by Serbs.
   ``Despite having shown considerable initiative in her duties, she
has to bear objective responsibility for the situation'' in Kosovo,
said a statement by Kosovo's leadership, carried by Tanjug.
   Jasari replaced Vlasi as head of the provincial Communist Party
last year.
   Seven Kosovo leaders have stepped down in the past month.
   Milosevic, backed by mass rallies attended by hundreds of
thousands of Serbs in recent months, has blamed Kosovo's leadership
for ethnic tensions in the province.
   Jasari said in her opening speech that the provincial leadership
``had to insist with greater determination on preventing'' both
Albanian and Serbian nationalism in Kosovo, Tanjug reported.
   The demands for the replacement of the provincial leadership are
based on claims they have been unable to cope with Albanian
nationalism that has allegedly been simmering since 1981.

   Police chased an auto-theft suspect across
rooftops before he tied a rope around his neck and threatened to
hang himself from a rowhouse.
   Andrew Kane, 28, surrendered Wednesday after holding police at
bay 1{ hours, said State Police Lt. T.Y. Blocker.
   Kane, who had been accused of stealing an unmarked State Police
car filled with weapons, was charged with auto theft, receiving
stolen goods and weapons violations.
   Officer William Ervin, one of three officers who talked Kane into
surrendering, said the man had been smoking crack before the police
chase.
   Blocker said Kane took a rope that had been attached to a rooftop
antenna, wrapped it around his neck and waist and tied it to a pipe
on the second-story roof of a three-story rowhouse, threatening to
kill himself.
   The police car was stolen Nov. 8 while a trooper visited
relatives. In the trunk were a grenade launcher, tear gas grenades,
a submachine gun, a revolver, two shotguns, ammunition and
rappelling hooks and other equipment used to scale buildings.
   City police found the car about two hours after it was reported
missing. Its trunk had been forced open and the weapons were missing.

   A man whose teen-age son died after he
whipped him as punishment for stealing pleaded guilty to a charge of
culpable homicide, a newspaper reported Thursday.
   Amos Ndlovu told Bulawayo Magistrates' Court on Wednesday that
his 14-year-old son, Benedict, broke into a cabinet in their home
and stole about $26.50, The Chronicle reported.
   As punishment, he bound the boy's hands behind his back and
struck him repeatedly with a sjambok, a whip made of rhinocerus or
hippopotamus hide, the father said. His son died the following
morning from the injuries.
   Magistrate Phillip Drazdik fined Ndlovu the equivalent of about
$132, or three months' imprisonment. He also sentenced Ndlovu, 54,
to three months' imprisonment, but suspended it on condition he is
not convicted of similar violent acts for three years.
   The court found that Ndlovu's remorse at what he had done to his
own son was sufficient punishment.

   Police fought a gunbattle with elephant
poachers in a national park, killing two of them, a newspaper
reported Thursday.
   The poachers were killed Wednesday in Tsavo East National Park in
a gunbattle with paramilitary police, the Standard reported. Police
sought an undisclosed number of other poachers Thursday, it said.
   Police were sent to reinforce game rangers in Tsavo East and
neighboring Tsavo West national parks, 225 miles south of Nairobi,
in August after poachers killed a ranch foreman and a policeman.
Nine policemen and rangers were injured.
   The government has embarked on a campaign to stop the widespread
slaughter of its elephants. Newspapers say 160 elephants have been
killed by poachers since May.
   Kenya's elephant population has fallen by 15 percent in the past
15 years, according to a United Nations study. An aerial survey in
February of the Tsavo area found fewer than 5,500 elephants, down
from 35,000 in 1974.
   Experts blame the intensified slaughter on an all-time high ivory
price, which has climbed steadily since the early 1970s and averages
$82 per pound.

   A disease that caused 127 children in a Ukrainian
town to lose their hair has been traced to high doses of thallium, a
toxic metal probably carried by acid rain, a newspaper reported
Thursday.
   ``Since there are no sources of the discharge of thallium into
the environment in Chernovtsy and its environs, a conclusion was
drawn that the chemical was introduced to the area by acid rains in
July,'' the Communist Party daily Pravda said.
   Despite the conclusion, authorities are continuing to investigate
other possible causes for the disease, it reported.
   A criminal investigation has been initiated, Pravda said,
indicating that if individuals were found to be responsible for
thallium poisoning, they may face criminal charges.
   Ten industrial operations have been suspended near Chernovtsy, on
the Soviet border with Romania, Pravda said.
   ``However despite the measures being taken, it is reported that
the number of cases of the disease continues to grow,'' it said.
   The disease was first reported in the Soviet media Nov. 6. On
Wednesday, the weekly Literaturnaya Gazeta said the cause had been
traced to thallium, but did not name the source.
   Thallium is a poisonous mettalic element that resembles lead as
is used chiefly in compounds in photoelectric cells or in pesticides.
   Chernovtsy is far from the Chernobyl nuclear power plant and the
areas downwind of it that suffered from radiation contamination
after a 1986 accident.
   Medical experts called in for the investigation were studying the
``strange selectivity of the ailment which affected mainly weakened
children and adolescents with blue eyes and blond hair,'' Pravda
said.
   Pravda said the children not only lost their hair, but many
experienced mild neurological disorders ``resulting in irritability
and hallucinations.''
   The children affected ranged in age from 5{ months to 14 years.
Medical experts believe the disease has no lingering effects and the
children's hair will grow back, the reports said.
   Literaturnaya Gazeta said most of the afflicted children had been
taken to hospitals in major Soviet cities for special attention.
   ``However the optimistic forecast has not brought any peace of
mind because it is still not clear where the source of infection
is,'' Literaturnaya Gazetta said.
   Some of the possible sources, the weekly said, include a Romanian
chemical plant about 40 miles from Chernovtsy or fumes from gasoline
to which ``tricksters'' have added thallium. All the sick children's
families have cars, or live in the area of garages, Literaturnaya
Gazetta said.
   ``Whatever version will prevail, one thing is already clear: it
was the last drop which made the cup of ecological patience
overflow,'' the weekly said.

<HEAD>Orthodox Party Demanding Religious Radio Station</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The ultra-Orthodox Shas political party has
asked Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir to create a radio station with
exclusively religious programming, a spokesman for the party said
Thursday.
   ``We would like to bring some of the light the Torah gives to the
people,'' said Shas spokesman Moshe Peretz said. ``Many of our own
people do not know the ABCs of Judaism because they are denied by
the educational system.''
   Shamir's hardline Likud party has made many concessions to Shas
in order to gain the support of the religious party, which controls
six seats in the parliament, or Knesset. Chief among them was a
promise to amend a law narrowing the definition of who is a Jew.
   Shamir was asked to form the government by President Chaim Herzog
after his party got 40 seats, compared with 39 for the rival Labor
Party, in Nov. 1 elections for the 120-seat parliament. But
negotiations to form a coaltion still are continuing.
   The Shas party, which represents Sephardic Jews _ those of North
African and Arab origin _ also has requested the creation of a
third, separate school system to be devoted to educating Orthodox
Sephardic students.
   The financially strapped, state-financed school system already
supports both secular and religious school systems.
   Peretz said Likud has not received definite answers about the
radio station or the school system.
   The Hadashot newspaper said last week that Likud would transform
Israel's only classical music program into a religious station.
There are three state-run radio stations, and an additional station
run by the armed forces.
   The proposed radio station would broadcast courses on Judaism and
be used to counter attacks Peretz charged were made routinely by the
mainstream media.
   ``There are journalists in Israel who find it their goal in life
to attack Judaism,'' he said. ``We would like to bring to the people
the right face of Judaism.
   ``The real security of Israel will be in the moral fabric of the
people. We want to bring people back closer to the Jewish roots, to
see the strength of the people,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   President Reagan, seeking to give new impetus
to international trade negotiations, announced Thursday he is
dropping a demand that other countries join the United States in
phasing out agricultural subsidies by the year 2000.
   An eventual elimination of government interventions into farm
markets remains the American goal, Reagan said in a speech to the
U.S. Chamber of Commerce.
   But he acknowledged that talks under the auspices of the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade have beast in part,
because of the U.S. demand for a fixed deadline fogged down, at lor getting
governments out of the business of subsidizing their agricultural
economies.
   Reagan failed, at the seven-nation economic summit in Toronto at
the end of May, to persuade principal U.S. trade partners to endorse
such a timetable, which has been criticized heatedly by the European
Economic Community and Japan.
   On Tuesday, U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter announced a
new U.S. proposal to be taken up at the mid-term review of the
Uruguay Round of talks under GATT. The proposal called for a freeze
on all farm price supports, subsidies and trade barriers in the next
two years, but made no mention of an end-of-century deadline for
phasing subsidies out.
   Noting the coming mid-term review in t. It is a testament to the commitment
of our two
governments to the principles of the open market and to economic
cooperation.''
   The United States' government subsidized American agriculture in
the amount of more than $26 billion in the fiscal year that ended
Sept. 30, and there has been little enthusiasm in Congress for the
administration's push to lower the government's profile in the
farming business.
   Reagan said that instead of continuing to pursue agreement on a
phase-out deadline of the year 2000, the U.S. negotiators will ``be
ready to discuss flexible adjustment'' procedures to cushion the
shock of ending subsidies. He said the United States would be
``flexible about timetables so long as everyone agrees on nailing
down an adjustment plan with specific dates for ending
trade-distorting subsidies and market access barriers. The final
goal is what is important.''
   Reagan also said that the United States recognizes the concerns
of many nations among the 96 that are members of GATT, over the
question of ``food security'' _ or the worry on the part of some
nations that if trade barriers disappear, they would be left at the
mercy of others in the event of food shortages.
   ``Again, they may have a point,'' he said. ``And so, in Montreal,
we'll be ready to talk about government stockpiles, land purchases
and other ways of dealing with what has been called `food security.'
''
   On another matter, Reagan told his business audience that the
U.S. policy of seeking to open new markets for American products and
to remove trade barriers will continue intact under President-elect
George Bush.
   In fact, he said, ``President-elect Bush has been on board every
step of the way. Anyone who thinks that American policy in this area
might shift with the new administration or the new Congress is
deluding himself.''
   He said he and Bush would meet with Yeutter and Secretary of
Agriculture Richard Lyng to ``reiterate our mutual support'' before
the Montreal talks.
   Among other key objectives of U.S. GATT negotiators in Montreal,
Reagan said, are these:
   _Steps to improve intellectual property protections, particularly
to attack counterfeiting and piracy.
   _Establish rules which for the first time would cover trade in
services, as well as in goods and products.
   _Steps to bring about greater discipline over trade-related
investment.

<TEXT>
   The Willow Creek Dam above the Eastern
Oregon town of Heppner is reliable, according to a review panel
asked to look at the safety of the flood-control dam because of
worry about erosion.
   Criticism of the dam's design was without merit, the five-member
technical panel said in its report. The dam was the first in the
nation built entirely by the roller-compacting method rather than
the traditional method of pouring concrete.
   The review was ordered by Sen. Mark Hatfield, a ranking
Republican on the Senate energy and water subcommittee.
   In a statement issued after the panel's report was released
Wednesday, Hatfield said the allegations of safety problems were
`quite serious,'' but ``after a thorough study by Army experts and
an independent investigator, it appears reasonable to assert those
concerns were unfounded.''
   The 169-foot-high dam was completed in 1983 at a cost of $34.7
million to protect residents of Heppner. In 1903, one third of the
town's population died in a flash flood of Willow Creek.

<DATELINE>SIDON, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gunmen today kidnapped the Swiss head of
the International Committee of the Red Cross's mission in the
southern port of Sidon, authorities said.
   Lebanese police said Peter Winkler, 32, was grabbed by three
gunmen from his official car on Sidon's Hisbeh Square.
   There was no immediate claim of responsibility.
   A police spokesman said there were reports Winkler was taken to
the Palestinian refugee camp of Ein el-Hilweh on Sidon's southern
outskirts, ``but we haven't been able to verify this.''
   The kidnappers, driving a BMW, intercepted Winkler's white
Peugeot, grabbed him, pushed him into their car and sped away, the
police spokesman said on condition of anonymity.
   At Red Cross heaquarters in Geneva, officials confirmed the
abduction and said Winkler's Lebanese driver was released shortly
afterward.
   Winkler took up his duties in Sidon, 25 miles south of Beirut,
about a month ago, said the police spokesman.
   He said an emergency meeting was under way between Palestinian
guerrilla leaders and the command of the Popular Nasserite
Organization militia in Sidon to try to determine Winkler's
whereabouts.
   The organization is a leftist Sunni Moslem militia that has been
governing Sidon since the 1975 outbreak of Lebanon's civil war.
   In Geneva, spokesman Joerg Bischof said Red Cross delegates have
been abducted before in the region but all were released a few hours
later. ``Let's hope this will be again the case this time,'' he said.
   Issam Salem, a spokesman for PLO chief Yasser Arafat, said the
action was aimed against the recent declaration of the state of
Palestine and pledged to find the kidnappers.
   ``They (kidnappers) are not going to get away with it,'' he told
reporters.
   Arafat proclaimed the birth of the Palestinian state at an
extraordinary meeting of the Palestine National Council, the
Palestinian parliament-in-exile, in Algiers on Tueday. Hard-line
Palestinian groups backed by Syria oppose the declaration for its
tacit recognition of Israel.
   The Swiss ambassador to Lebanon, Dino Sciolli, said the embassy
was waiting for a claim of responsibility in Winkler's kidnapping.
   ``At this moment we do not know why he was taken,'' said Scilli,
based in Nicosia, Cyprus.
   Sciolli said about 30 Red Cross officials work in Lebanon and
that a few Swiss citizens remain in the Christian sector of the
country. All Swiss residents of the Moslem sector left, he said.
   Not including Winkler, 14 foreigners, nine of them Americans, are
missing in Lebanon and believed held hostage.
   The longest held is Terry Anderson, chief Middle East
correspondent for The Associated Press. He was kidnapped March 16,
1985 and is being held by a pro-Iranian Shiite Moslem faction
calling itself Islamic Jihad, or Holy War.
   The other hostages are eight Americans, three Britons, an Italian
and an Irishman.
   Belgian physician Jan Cools, 32, of the Norwegian aid committee
NORWAC, has been missing since he left the Palestinian refugee camp
of Rashidiyeh near the southern city of Tyre on May 21.
   No group has claimed his abduction.

<TEXT>
   The Justice Department announced today that it
has reviewed the cases of 28 Cuban detainees and has decided to send
15 of them back to their homeland ``in the near future.''
   The 15, who came to the United States in the boatlift of 125,000
people from Mariel, Cuba, have been convicted of crimes ranging from
burglary to first-degree murder, the Justice Department said in a
statement.
   The cases of the 28 were reviewed by three-member repatriation
review panels set up at the Justice Department in the wake of last
year's prison riots by Cuban detainees at Atlanta and Oakdale, La.,
which were triggered by an agreement with Cuban President Fidel
Castro to resume sending many of the detainees back to the island.
   The three-member panels will undertake further review of the
remaining 13 detainees of the group of 28 to determine whether they
should be returned to the island or released, Justice Department
aides Cary Copeland and George Calhoun told a news conference.
   The 28 are the first cases to be heard by the review panels and
are among hundreds of detainees who face repatriation reviews.
   The two Justice Department aides declined to speculate on when
the 15 might be sent back, noting they fully expect that lawyers for
them will file court suits.
   ``We expect to challenge negative decisions in court, arguing
that each detainee is entitled to an administrative review by a
federal court of the Justice Department decision,'' said Gary
Leshaw, director of the non-profit Atlanta legal aid organization
representing Mariel detainees.
   The Justice Department action on the 15 moves the government one
step closer to undertaking the first deportations of Mariel Cubans
to their communist homeland since May 1985.
   Separate Justice Department parole review panels were established
in the wake of last year's riots and those panels have reviewed 11
cases to date, Calhoun and Copeland said. The panels determined that
six detainees should remain in the custody of the Immigration and
Naturalization Service. The other five will receive further review
to determine if they are suitable for parole.
   An agreement between rioting prisoners and the government
provided that Cuban detainees who were incarcerated at the time of
the disturbances would receive a full, fair and thorough review by
the Justice Department of any INS decision denying them parole.
   Deportable Cuban detainees are being held in a strict
``lockdown'' in a penitentiary in Talladega, Ala., so another
disturbance is considered unlikely.
   ``I think it is ironic that the U.S. government ... chooses to
continue on the unfortunate path of deporting people to a country
that our own U.N. ambassador has characterized as `one of the
world's darkest dungeons,''' Leshaw said.
   Cuban groups in Miami were already planning protests.
   ``We will appeal to President Reagan. He can block the
deportations, even if the people are sitting in an airplane at the
airport,'' Rafael Penalver, chairman of the Task Force of Cuban
American Citizen Organizations, said Wednesday.
   Penalver is a lawyer who helped negotiate the settlement to end
the riots by 3,800 Mariel detainees last November.

   At least 250 students in the Enterprise
School District should receive preventive medication for
tuberculosis because of their contact with a senior who has the
respiratory disease, officials said.
   Dr. Margaret Morrison, state health officer for the east
Mississippi area, said the disease may have spread because the
unidentified student, who is hospitalized, had attended school for
some time before he sought medical treatment.
   Morrison said the faculty and all 800 students in the rural
district's two schools were tested for TB. She said the 16 people
who tested positive are on medication.
   She recommended that at least 250 additional students who may
have been exposed to the disease receive medication to prevent
future health problems. School officials say a note was sent home
with those children suggesting they see a doctor and get preventive
medication.
   The students will be retested in March, Morrison said.

   There's nobody home in Yturria, Texas, except
maybe a few prairie dogs and armadillos.
   But it's on the map, along with 51 other obscure sites that have
made the big time for the first time in the 1989 Rand McNally Road
Atlas, appearing this week in stores nationwide.
   Michael Dobson, director of cartographic services at Rand
McNally, based in nearby Skokie, says most of the towns were put on
the map in response to travelers' suggestions.
   Yturria, 50 miles north of Brownsville, has no human residents.
But it was added this year because it is the site of the Yturria
Ranch, recognized as a historic site by Texas.
   ``Yturria's on there more as a point of interest than as a
populated place,'' Dobson said. ``We really look at places and say,
`Do they have a travel-consumer related value?' In some cases they
might be the only point of significance in the area.''
   Dobson said he receives thousands of letters each year from
travelers who suggest changes.
   Vermillion, Kan., was added after he received a letter from a man
who said the 167 mostly elderly residents of Vermillion enjoyed
looking at the atlas and planning trips, both real and imaginary.
   Rohwer, Ark., was added after someone wrote to note that it was
the site of an internment camp for Japanese-Americans during World
War II, Dobson said.
   While Dobson says he likes to add new towns when he can, he is
limited to what he can fit on the map, especially in the densely
populated Northeast.
   ``You try to make it so there aren't so many things that you lose
legibility,'' he said.
   Dobson couldn't say how many towns were listed in the atlas, but
he said he doesn't often drop a town.
   ``Every once in a while, the Army Corps of Engineers will build a
dam and a town that was in existence will be under 30 or 40 feet of
water,'' he said. ``But very few people will write to say their town
no longer exists.''

   A bankruptcy judge today rejected offers
from two Canadian businessmen for the assets of PTL and ordered
bidding to ``start from scratch.''
   Judge Rufus Reyrby, have been under the bankruptcy
court's control pending its sale.
   Proceeds will go toward satisfying the ministry's debts,
estimated as high as $130 million, including about $55 million
claimed by the Internal Revenue Service.
   Bakker's own $172 million bid for the ministry fell through in
September when he was unable to raise a $3 million down payment. The
Bakkers now are trying to raise money for a new TV ministry.
   Mernick, a 34-year-old real estate developer who is an Orthodox
Jew, also owns a tire plant, a travel agency, a garbage collection
service and an import company, has said he is interested in PTL for
its real estate.
   Thomas, chairman of Samoth Capital Corp. of Vancouver, founded
Century 21 of Canada. He has said he would operate Heritage USA as a
resort and conference center that would stress ``traditional family
values.''
   Thomas said he would consider allowing the ministry to lease
facilities at Heritage USA. Mernick has not said whether he would
allow the ministry to stay.
   PTL filed for bankruptcy protection in 1987, three months after
Bakker stepped aside over a sexual encounter with Jessica Hahn, a
church secretary.
   Donations to the ministry dwindled amid ensuing revelations about
the luxurious lifestyle enjoyed by the Bakkers.

   Federal agencies probably will recommend 250 to
400 rivers for protection in the nation's Wild and Scenic River
System, according to a conservation group which said Thursday that
``things are looking up'' with the accession of a fisherman to the
White House.
   The Forest Service has identified 500 rivers in its 123 national
forests that are eligible for protection and expects ``that at a
miniumum 200 will be included,'' said Kevin Coyle of American
Rivers, who said he was also speaking for George Leonard, associate
chief of the Forest Service.
   Frank Snell, chief of the recreation, wilderness and cultural
resources division of the Bureau of Land Management, said his agency
was studying another 60 to 80 rivers on its lands. He did not say
how many were expected to be recommended for protection.
   Leonard's flight was delayed and he could not be at a news
conference sponsored by American Rivers, a conservation group
chiefly interested in preserving free-flowing rivers.
   The Wild and Scenic River System was established by Congress 20
years ago to preserve free-flowing rivers from damming, development
along their banks or other harm. So far only 119 segments totaling
9,200 miles have been protected, of which 44 rivers and 1,429 miles
in Oregon were mandated by a bill passed by Congress and signed by
President Reagan last month.
   The 9,200 miles are only 0.2 percent of the total U.S. river
system. W. Kent Olson, president of American Rivers, said the group
estimates that 17 percent of the total has been dammed. ``We are
quite hopeful that the Wild and Scenic System will quadruple over
the next 10 years,'' he said.
   In President-elect George Bush and Secretary of State-designate
James Baker, We have a fisherman as president and a fisherman as
secretary of state and things are looking up,'' Olson said.
   Stewart L. Udall, interior secretary for Presidents Kennedy and
Johnson, said he was preparing an open letter to Bush that would
say, among other things, ``If you are looking for things that don't
cost a lot of money, the wild rivers system is certainly a
candidate.''
   The letter will tell Bush he has the chance ``to preside over the
preservation of more miles of free-flowing rivers that all of your
predecessors combined,'' Udall said.
   In 1982 the National Park Service identified 1,524 river segments
totaling 62,000 miles as worthy of study to see if they met the
congressionallly criterion of having ``outstandingly remarkable''
features. Olson said it might take 50 years to bring that many under
protection.
   For some years the service has been studying the idea of a
``river park,'' protecting a river along its entire length. Deputy
Director Denis Galvin said the idea was still being considered for
``a handful _ two or three'' rivers, but the service had not been
able to ``put together the right factors to make the proposal
acceptable'' to all jurisdictions along the lengths of the
candidates.
   He identified only one candidate, the Buffalo River in Arkansas.
   While rivers are being studied, the Forest Service and the Bureau
of Land Management impose a quarter-mile buffer zone on each bank
where timbering, stock-watering and similar activities are banned.
   But they cannot prevent the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission
from granting licenses from small hydroelectric dams, favored by
1978 legislation aimed at diversifying energy supplies. The
commission grants about 200 licenses a year.
   Olson said many Westerners saw protection as a ``river grab,''
but ``rivers that are designated often act as an enhancer of local
property values.''

<HEAD>Walesa Reported to Accept Date for TV Debate with Official Union
Chief</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Solidarity leader Lech Walesa has aghat the date was
acceptable to Walesa, but the banned union considered the
arrangements tentative.
   In another development, 51 people ended a hunger strike in the
southern city of Katowice after winning the reinstatement of the
last of about 100 miners dismissed in August for striking. The
decision clears away one of the major obstacles blocking promised
talks between authorities and the opposition.
   Alfred Miodowicz, a member of the ruling Politburo in addition to
being leader of the official union alliance known by its Polish
initials OPZZ, had challenged Walesa to a debate Tuesday in the
Communist Party daily Trybuna Ludu.
   Polish radio announced the debate should take place after the
evening news Nov. 30. The state-run news agency PAP later carried an
identical report.
   Walesa on Tuesday agreed in principle for a televised debate on
union issues.
   It would be Walesa's first appearance on state TV since 1983,
when he challenged then-Deputy Prime Minister Mieczyslaw F. Rakowski
during a televised speech at the Lenin Shipyard in Gdansk. Rakowski
became Poland's prime minister in September.
   Attempts to reach Walesa for comment were not successful. His
wife said he was not at his Gdansk home.
   Solidarity spokesman Robert Kozak confirmed the date was
acceptable to Walesa, but said the union considered it to be
tentative. He did not elaborate.
   Walesa earlier authorized Solidarity adviser Adam Michnik and
Solidarity national spokesman Janusz Onyszkiewicz to make the
technical arrangements. But neither of them was at home late Tuesday
to answer questions.
   Walesa and Miodowicz will face the cameras alone without any
advisers for 45 to 60 minutes, the radio report said.
   Miodowicz indicated the debate might be a partial substitute for
the talks authorities promised during the August wave of strikes.
The talks were to consider the issue of union pluralism and broader
topics of economic and political reform.
   Besides the fate of the dismissed miners, the talks have been
delayed by government objections to the participation of Solidarity
advisers Jacek Kuron and Michnik.
   Miodowicz has headed the official unions since they were set up
by the government in 1982 after the authorities banned Solidarity,
the Soviet bloc's first independent trade union.
   Solidarity supporters, demanding their union be made legal again,
believe more than one union should be allowed in each workplace
because the OPZZ does not adequately represent workers.
   Miodowicz favors one union in one enterprise and says Solidarity
activists are welcome to join his unions and try to change them from
within.
   In Katowice, Adam Slomka, a spokesman for 51 people fasting since
Saturday in the Christ the King Cathedral, said the agreement to
rehire dismissed workers was reached through the mediation of Roman
Catholic Bishop Damian Zimon.
   ``We managed to achieve in five days what hadn't been achieved in
several months,'' said Slomka, speaking by telephone from the
cathedral. He said agreement was reached late Wednesday with the
national coal federation to reinstate the workers as of Thursday.
   Workers broke their fast Thursday morning, eating rolls with
butter and sweetened tea, Slomka said.
   Slomka said 49 miners who still had not been reinstated were to
be restored to their old jobs. He said only two workers at the
Stalowa Wola steel mill in southeast Poland, another region of the
country, have not gotten back their jobs since the August strikes.
   Tadeusz Napieracz, a deputy director at the coal federation, the
body that oversees the mines, confirmed the reinstatements, but he
denied they had been fired. He said officials wanted to reassign
them, while the miners insisted on their jobs back.

<TEXT>
   The operator of a mail-order pornography
business has agreed to disband his business and pay a $600,000 fine
under a plea agreement with the Justice Department's anti-obscenity
unit.
   The details of the government's plea agreement with Avram
Freedberg and his company were filed in federal court today as part
of a proposed settlement of Freedberg's civil suit to stop his
prosecution in more than one state.
   As part of the plea agreement, Freedberg's company, Consumer
Marketing Group Ltd. of Stamford, Conn., will be disbanded and
forfeit its $100,000 inventory of pictures and videotapes of sexual
acts, according to the court papers.
   The company agreed to enter guilty pleas to obscenity charges in
federal courts in Utah, Mississippi and Delaware and pay a $600,000
fine.
   In return, the government will drop 18 felony obscenity charges
against Freedberg in Utah, where he was indicted earlier this year
along with his company.
   Remaining criminal charges pending against the company in Utah
will also be dismissed in return for the firm's guilty plea to one
count of mailing or transporting obscene material, according to the
indictment.
   Freedberg also agreed to cooperate with the government's
continuing investigation of pornography distributors, including
giving grand jury testimony.
   Details of the plea agreement were filed in court as part of an
out-of-court settlement of Freedberg's lawsuit to prevent his
indictment in more than one state.
   On June 8, U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson issued a
preliminary injunction barring the Justice Department from bringing
criminal charges against Freedberg and his company in more than one
federal court jurisdiction.
   The department had planned to charge Freedberg in Utah,
Mississippi, Delaware and Indiana.
   But Jackson had ruled that the Justice Department's decision to
prosecute Freedberg in more than one jurisdiction raised
constitutional questions.
   Freedberg and his company had contended that the government's
strategy was ``unlawfully and unconstitutionally preventing
plaintiffs from engaging in a legal occupation.''
   As part of the proposed settlement, which Jackson is expected to
approve, the injunction will be dissolved and Freedberg's civil
lawsuit against the Justice Department will be dismissed.
   In the settlement document submitted to Jackson, the Justice
Department said it ``continues to deny its multi-district

   A car belonging to four young adults
missing since Saturday was found in a river today with four bodies
in it, police and witnesses said. Identities of the victims were not
immediately released.
   The car had approached a swing bridge open at the time and went
over a concrete barrier into the water, said Lt. James Forrentino,
police spokesman.
   Police divers at the scene said they had found four bodies in the
car. Forrentino refused to confirm that.
   The discovery came four days after three women and one man, ages
19 and 20, disappeared after drinking illegally at a bar near Yale
University and leaving together about 3 a.m. Sunday, said state
police Detective Andrew Trudelle.
   He said the information came from an employee of the bar, which
under state law can't serve anyone under 21.
   Police divers found the group's car submerged in about 15 feet of
water in the Mill River, in a little-traveled, old industrial part
of the city, police said. A crane was brought in to remove the car.
   Earlier today, Francis ``Bud'' Mullen, former head of the federal
Drug Enforcement Agency and a private investigator looking for the
four, said he believed the friends from East Lyme were being held
against their will by someone.
   The four were last seen by their parents at 7 p.m. Saturday, when
they left for an evening in New Haven. Mullen was hired by their
parents.
   ``I believe they're in New Haven and being held against their
wills,'' said Mullen, who also worked previously for the FBI. His
first major case with the FBI was as an agent assigned to the 1963
kidnapping of Frank Sinatra Jr.
   Family and friends described the four former high school buddies
as responsible adults unlikely to take off without telling anyone.
The parents distributed pictures of the missing and offered a
$25,000 reward, Mullen said.
   The missing adults were: Jill Sawyer, 19, a student at the
University of Rhode Island; Christy Stevens, 19, a student at
Mohegan Community College in Norwich; Michael Gallo, 20, a student
at Southern Connecticut; and Laura Lagrotteria, 19.

   The State Department today denounced as
``unjustified'' Iraqi's expulsion of an American diplomat and
retaliated by throwing out an Iraqi diplomat stationed here.
   Referring to the American diplomat, identified in Baghdad as
Haywood Rankin, head of the U.S. Embassy's political section, State
Department spokesman Charles E. Redman said, ``None of his
activities have been incompatible in any way with his diplomatic
status.''
   Assistant Secretary of State Richard W. Murphy informed the Iraqi
ambassador, Abdul-Amir Al-Anbari, that an Iraqi diplomat here had
been declared persona non grata, Redman said.
   He said ``this action was taken in response to the unjustified
expulsion of a U.S. diplomat in Baghdad by the Iraqi goverment.''
Redman declined to identify the Iraqi or his job.
   In Baghdad, speaking on condition of anonymity, diplomats said
Rankin was asked to leave Iraq after making an unauthorized trip to
the north, home of Iraq's estimated 3.5 million Kurds.
   Both the Iraqi Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the U.S. Embassy
refused to comment on Rankin's expulsion. Diplomats said he already
has left Iraq.
   About 60,000 Kurds fled across the northern border to Turkey and
thousands of others went into Iran in August, claiming Iraq dropped
chemical bombs on their villages.
   Militants among the 20 million Kurds living in a region extending
into Turkey, Iran and Iraq have fought for independence for a
century.
   Iraq pounded Kurdish settlements on its northwestern border
shortly after accepting an Aug. 20 cease-fire in its 8-year-old war
with Iran. Kurdish guerrillas received support from Iran during the
war.
   The Congress considered economic sanctions against Iraq, based on
State Department reports it was using chemical weapons against the
Kurds. Iraq denied the use and the legislation was dropped in the
rush to close Congress before the November presidential elections in
the United States.

   Local civil rights leaders have accused
Illinois Central College officials of racism in bypassing a black
Fulbright Scholar and selecting a white man with less experience as
its new president.
   Local NAACP officals said Wednesday they believe racial prejudice
influenced the appointment last week of Thomas K. Thomas, who has
been president of Red Rocks Community College in Lakewood, Colo.,
since March 1987.
   ``The black candidate is a Fulbright Scholar, studied at Harvard
and has 20 years' experience as a college president. The white
candidate has 20 months' experience as a college president,'' said
John Gwynn Jr., state and local president of the National
Association for the Advancement of Colored People. ``It was just so
obvious the black candidate was so much more qualified.''
   Trustees at the college voted 5-2 to appoint Thomas, 47, rather
than Abel B. Sykes Jr., 54, president at Kings River Community
College in Reedley, Calif., for 15 years.
   The Peoria NAACP called for the decision to be overturned and
filed complaints with the Illinois Board of Higher Education, the
Illinois Board of Education and the Illinois Department of Human
Rights. State officials said they would investigate.
   Some trustees defended the appointment.
   ``Racism was not an issue in the selection,'' said Douglas
Stewart, chairman of the college's board of trustees. ``I think we
had three qualified candidates provided by the search committee. We
chose one of them.''
   The lone black board member, Louis Owens, disagreed.
   ``If Sykes was white, there is no question that he would have
been chosen,'' Owens said. ``What's worse, had I not been on the
search committee, Dr. Sykes' name would have never come up. I'm
disappointed and devastated.''
   Owens was board chairman but was removed from that position after
the vote on Thomas. Owens said board members told him he was ousted
because they felt he could not support the new president.
   The two-year college serves 12,000 students in eight counties
surrounding Peoria.

   Housing construction in October posted the
biggest increase in eight months, the government said Thursday in a
report taken as evidence that the Federal Reserve hasn't yet curbed
excessive economic growth.
   The Commerce Department said construction began on new homes and
apartments at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.55 million
units last month, up 7.2 percent from September. It was the highest
level since April and the sharpest increase since February.
   ``This is yet one more sign that our economy is doing very
well,'' said Lyle Gramley, a former Federal Reserve governor, now
chief economist of the Mortgage Bankers Association of America.
   ``The consumer is very confident. There are a lot of jobs
available ... We've had some instability in the financial markets,
but nothing to worry the consumer excessively,'' he said.
   A month ago, most economists were saying the Federal Reserve's
program of pushing up interest rates since late March was beginning
to take hold, slowing economic growth to a pace considered
sustainable without inflation.
   But starting Nov. 4 with the release of the Labor Department's
report on October employment, most signs have pointed to renewed
vigor in the economy, suggesting the Federal Reserve may push
interest rates up another notch to dampen growth.
   The unemployment rate last month was at a 14-year low, retail
sales registered their sharpest increase in eight months, and the
operating rate at factories, mines and utilities hit an 8{-year
high. Exports in September climbed to a new record.
   However, excessive economic strength can be too much of a good
thing, straining manufacturers' ability to produce, leading to
shortages of goods and higher prices. The goal of the Federal
Reserve is to check the growth through higher interest rates without
choking it off completely.
   ``The Fed tightening since March hasn't taken a heck of a lot of
steam out of the economy,'' said David Seiders, chief economist of
the National Association of Home Builders and a former Federal
Reserve staff member.
   He predicted a hike in the discount rate, the interest the Fed
charges member banks for loans, by the end of the year.
   ``We know the Fed will do whatever it takes to slow the economy
down, and that means slowing the housing sector down. So we're a
little worried about the future,'' he said.
   The big gain in housing starts last month followed two declines:
0.8 percent in September and a 1.1 percent in August.
   Although the October number was strong, economists noted that the
biggest part of the increase was concentrated in the West, where the
California market is booming. They also said a temporary decline in
mortgage interest rates of more than half a percentage point between
mid-August and early November bolstered activity.
   ``What we're seeing is primarily a Western phenomenon,'' said
Mark Obrinsky, an economist with the U.S. League of Savings
Institutions. ``I think, in retrospect, we'll see this as a little
bit of a spike. We may see this pace for another month or so, but we
surely won't see it for another six months.''
   Excluding the West, where the robust economy and population
growth of California dominate the statistics, the overall increase
would have been a more moderate 3.9 percent.
   Housing starts shot up 15 percent in the West to 498,000 units,
the highest level since December 1986. Starts rose 7.6 percent in
the Midwest to 268,000 units, climbed 4.6 percent in the South to
586,000 units and fell 2.4 percent in the Northeast to 202,000.
   For the first 10 months of the year, housing starts were running
9.6 percent behind the same period of 1987. The peak year for
housing construction during the current economic expansion was 1986,
when 1.81 million units were started. Starts fell to 1.62 million
last year and are expected to hit 1.45 million this year.
   Michael Sumichrast, a private real estate economist in
Washington, said rising interest rates and high home prices likely
will push starts down even further to about 1.35 million units next
year.
   Single-family homes in October were built at an annual rate of
1.15 million units, up 10.0 percent, following a 3.3 percent decline
a month earlier.
   Apartment construction was up a scant 0.2 percent to 408,000
units in October after rising 6.3 percent in September.
   Building permits, a good indicator of future housing activity,
shot up 7.4 percent in October to an annual rate of 1.50 million
units, the highest since September 1987. Permits had fallen 4.8
percent a month earlier.

<TEXT>
   The wife of Israeli Premier Yitzhak Shamir
met Thursday with Bulgarian leader Todor Zhivkov, and another
Bulgarian official said diplomatic ties with Israel would be resumed
once unspecified hindrances are gone.
   Shulamit Shamir, who was born in Bulgaria but left at age 17 in
1941, held no substantive talks with Zhivkov, according to Bulgarian
officials at the meeting in Zhivkov's official residence.
   Western journalists were excluded from the meeting, which also
was attended by some participants in a two-day conference examining
Bulgaria's role in saving 50,000 Jews from the Nazis.
   When that conference ended Thursday, Bulgarian host Stefan
Petrov, head of the government news agency Sofia Press, was asked
whether the symposium _ the first of its kind in Communist
Bulgaria's history _ might help to restore ties with Israel.
   ``Diplomatic relations will be established after hindrances are
removed,'' Petrov told an Israeli journalist at a news conference.
He did not say what the hindrances were.
   Bulgaria and all Soviet bloc nations except Romania severed
diplomatic relations with Israel over the 1967 Middle East war.
   The symposium on Bulgaria's rescue of Jews brought together
Jewish leaders from Israel, the United States, France, Austria, East
Germany, and Hungary for the first time on Bulgarian soil.
   The Soviet Union, Poland, Hungary and East Germany recently have
moved to improve relations with international Jewish communities and
with Israel. Czechoslovakia has said it will hold a conference on
the Middle East that officials say will include former Israeli
Foreign Minister Abba Eban.
   Serge Kwajgenbaum, secretary general of the European Jewish
Congress said he met for 45 minutes with Zhivkov on Thursday and
detected Bulgarian willingness to improve ties to Jewish communities
around the world.
   Zhivkov invited the president of the World Jewish Congress, Edgar
Bronfman, to visit Bulgaria as soon as possible, Kwajgenbaum said.
   He indicated, however, that full diplomatic ties between Bulgaria
and Israel would not be restored before Moscow takes the same action.
   Bulgaria has a tiny Jewish community of about 3,000. In 1943,
when the Nazis allied to the Bulgarian government tried to deport
50,000 Jews to death camps in Poland, political and popular protests
and a turn against German fortunes in the war foiled the plan. Most
of the Jews eventually emigrated to Israel after the war.

   Authorities removed a first group of cruise
missiles from a base Thursday in compliance with the U.S.-Soviet
treaty to eliminate medium- and shorter-range nuclear weapons,
Italian officials reported.
   A Foreign Ministry spokesman said he didn't know the number but
the Italian news agency ANSA said 16 missiles were removed from the
base for eventual destruction in the Arizona desert.
   According to U.S. and Italian officials, 112 Tomahawk cruise
missiles are deployed in Comiso.
   ANSA said the missiles, covered by white canvas sheets, and the
mobile launching pads were transported on special trucks to the
Sigonella NATO air base near Catania.
   Earlier this week, a Soviet team conducted its second inspection
of the base.
   The inspections were made under terms of the 1987 treaty, which
requires the United States and the Soviet Union to eliminate within
three years medium and shorter-range land-based missiles with ranges
from 300 to 3,400 miles.

<TEXT>
   A former pro running back has been
charged with impersonating New York Giants athlete Joe Morris in a
check forgery, the latest in a string of cases in which he posed as
football stars, authorities said.
   Israel Lang, 46, a former reserve player for the Philadelphia
Eagles and Los Angeles Rams, was arrested Tuesday after persuading
United Jersey Bank to cash a check by passing himself off as Morris,
the Giants' all-time leading rusher, police said.
   He was charged with forgery and related counts and jailed on
$75,000 bail.
   Lang retired from pro football in 1969, and authorities said he
had been arrested 24 times since then.
   Lang, who has also been accused of impersonating Lawrence Taylor
and Leonard Marshall of the Giants, as well as other stars, has been
convicted at least eight times of charges including forgery and bank
fraud, authorities said.
   Two months ago, he was freed on $5,000 bail in Virginia on
charges he impersonated Doug Williams, quarterback of the Washington
Redskins, authorities said.
   ``He has been a nemesis to the National Football League,'' said
Warren Welsh, league director of security.
   Despite their name, the Giants play their home games at the
Meadowlands in northern New Jersey.
   ``You are in Giant territory here,'' said police Capt. Emil
Canestrino. ``If someone calls and says, `I'm Joe Morris,' you are
liable to bend the rules. He used the name to open up doors.''
   ``He seems to have some personal information about these
players,'' Welsh said. ``He seems to be the consummate con man.''
   Police said Lang knew Morris had an account at the bank and
called, saying he wanted to open an account for his father-in-law,
named Israel Lang. The imposter was arrested after a second attempt
to pass a $950 check, police said.
   A United Jersey spokeswoman refused to discuss the case.

   The dormitory was evacuated at 12:45 a.m., police Sgt. Carl

entertainment arena.
   Kinnison said students were lighting tissue paper and sliding it
under doors to surprise dorm mates. However, one room was unoccupied

posters and other items.
   The student arrested will probably be charged with reckless

   The West German government today paid $1.98 million
_ the highest price ever for a modern literary treasure _ for the
handwritten manuscript of Franz Kafka's novel ``The Trial.''
   The amount paid for the manuscript, which came from an
unidentified seller, eclipsed the $605,000 paid in New York last
year for Kafka's letters to his fiancee, Felice Bauer.
   The buyer was a West German antiquarian bookseller, Heribert
Tenschert, who said he was contacted by West German government
authorities to buy the manuscript for the Marbach Literary Institute
near Stuttgart.
   ``It was really surprising, the price,'' he said. ``I would have
bought it for myself''
   The bidding lasted only one minute, starting at $720,000 dollars
and rising in $90,000 increments against one other unidentified
bidder.
   The selling price was $1.8 million but Sotheby's, the auction
house, adds a 10 percent commission to the price.
   The 316-page German-language manuscript was finished in 1920 and
published in 1925, a year after Kafka, a German-speaking
Czechoslovak Jew, died of tuberculosis at age 41.
   The novel has become a symbol of the 20th century alienation,
totalitarianism and choking bureaucracy. The hero, Joseph K., who
has done nothing wrong, is arrested, tried and executed without ever
being informed of his charges.
   Kafka instructed his literary executor, Max Brod, to burn his
works, but Brod ignored the order.
   Kafka only wrote two other novels, ``The Castle,'' and the
unfinished ``Amerika.'' His short story, ``The Metamorphosis,'' is
another modern classic.
   The previous record for a purely literary work was $370,000 paid
in July 1985 for a notebook of poetry and prose by the Irish writer
William Butler Yeats.

   The closed-door meeting was intended to trade information about
the situation among the various agencies, Warner said.
   NASA and the Pentagon want Avtex to stay in business, because the
plant is the only supplier for a carbonizable rayon fiber which is a
key component of rocket nozzles for the space shuttle and some of
the Air Force's nuclear-tipped weapons.
   But the Environmental Protection Agency and the Virginia attorney
general's office want Avtex to clean up the plant that has a history
of environmental and worker safety problems.
   On Oct. 31, Avtex Chairman John Gregg announced he would close
the Front Royal plant because of environmental regulations and
foreign competition for other textile products made by Avtex. Gregg
stopped production Nov. 3, but recalled the work force one week
later as the government began a bailout of Avtex.
   Last week, NASA gave Avtex $7 million for the rights to the
fiber. The space agency said it will sign an $11 million contract
for the fiber, if Avtex can show by Friday it will generate enough
contracts to keep the plant in business.
   Warner noted that only three or four percent of the Avtex's
production involves the nozzle materials.
   But he said ``it would require as much as two years'' to develop
another source for this material. In the meantime, U.S. national
security could be harmed if missiles couldn't be launched, he said.
One example he gave was the use of Air Force missiles to launch
reconnaissance satellites.
   One major concern, Warner said, is to make sure that any federal
bailout money is not used to pay off any fines which could be levied
against Avtex.

   British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher said
today the acceptance by the PLO parliament-in-exile of two key
United Nations resolutions on the Middle East is a ``modest step
forward'' on which progress toward peace could be made.
   At a news conference shortly before ending her two-day visit
here, Mrs. Thatcher offered a slightly more upbeat assessment of the
declaration by the Palestine National Council, the legislative arm
of the Palestine Liberation Organization, than has the Reagan
administration.
   She criticized the PNC for proclaiming the establishment of a
Palestinian state and said the declaration did not go far enough in
repudiating terrorism.
   ``Obviously there are a lot of things in it that none of us
like,'' she said.
   But she said that approval of U.N. resolutions 242 and 338 ``is a
modest step forward and something on which you could build.'' The
resolutions call for Israeli withdrawal from occupied territories
and assert the right of all countries to live within secure borders.
   Mrs. Thatcher added that ``strenuous efforts'' should be made to
get peace negotiations going in the Middle East.
   Mrs. Thatcher reaffirmed her high regard for President-elect
George Bush, citing his extensive experience in government as a
major asset.
   ``You will have a president who doesn't have to be briefed,'' she
said.
   Earlier, she said she had ``not the slightest shadow of a doubt''
that Bush will deal responsibly with the U.S. deficit.
   Mrs. Thatcher repeated similar expressions of confidence in Bush
and the U.S. economy in three network television interviews prior to
meeting with the vice president for breakfast. The meeting followed
an evening of reminiscing at a state dinner with President Reagan,
whom she described as ``a marvelous president.''
   ``I have not the slightest shadow of doubt that in good time the
deficit will be considered in a responsible way,'' Mrs. Thatcher
said in an interview on ``CBS This Morning.''
   ``I don't share concerns about George Bush's ability to deal with
fundamental problems,'' she said on ABC-TV's ``Good Morning
America.'' ``I think he will deal with them in his own time and in
his own way and very responsibly indeed.''
   On NBC-TV's ``Today'' show, Mrs. Thatcher said Bush and his
advisers will need time to come up with policies for dealing with
the deficit. ``I don't think we should hurry them,'' she said.
   When Mrs. Thatcher arrived at the vice president's residence for
her meeting with Bush, he greeted her as ``the star of `Good Morning
America'.''
   The prime minister said in the interviews, all broadcast live
from Blair House, that she and Bush were talking about the world
economy, the Middle East and East-West ties.
   Mrs. Thatcher, who was ending her two-day state visit this
afternoon after a news conference, said Wednesday that the Western
alliance is ``very fortunate'' to have Bush as Reagan's successor.
   ``For the first time we will have continuity of policies,
stretching over a second presidency. And that brings enormous
stability and confidence to the feeling of the world,'' she told
reporters as she sat next to Reagan during an Oval Office photo
session.
   Mrs. Thatcher also has said of Bush, ``We know him as a friend,
we admire him as a man of unrivaled experience and we respect him
because he stands for all that is best in America.''
   After a private meeting between Reagan and Mrs. Thatcher, Bush
joined a subsequent meeting attended by top officials of both
governments. Like most others in the room, Bush said little,
deferring to the president and the prime minister, who met in their
respective capacities for the last time.
   Despite signs that Bush and Mrs. Thatcher will be able to work
well together, Bush will have a difficult time matching the
partnership Reagan forged with the British leader.
   The White House arrival ceremony for Mrs. Thatcher on Wednesday
was filled with expressions of mutual admiration.
   ``Together our nations have faced the challenges of our time, and
have not flinched. We forged ahead with strengthening the peace,
spreading prosperity and safeguarding liberty,'' Mrs. Thatcher said.
   Reagan lauded Mrs. Thatcher for her ``extraordinary role in the
revitalization of freedom,'' and said she has contributed to a
``remarkable change'' in her country through policies that encourage
individual creativity.
   Looking beyond his own term of office, Reagan added, ``It is
profoundly reassuring to me and to all who care about freedom that
you will continue to share with America your vision and your steady
hand.''

   Two diplomats who accompanied Afghanistan's
prime minister on his mission to the United Nations last week have
defected, U.S. officials said today.
   An official at the U.S. Mission to the United Nations said the
State Department confirmed two Afghan diplomats did not return to
the Afghan capital of Kabul, but would not say more about their
whereabouts. He spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Other U.S. officials, also speaking on condition of anonymity,
confirmed both diplomats had defected to the United States.
   No spokesmen were available at Afghanistan's Mission to the
United Nations. A receptionist said they were out of the office.
   Sources at the United Nations said the defectors were a deputy
foreign minister named Lanikwal, and a diplomat named Kamal.
   Afghan Prime Minister Mohammad Hassan Sharq was in New York last
week for talks with Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar and
other officials.
   In April, Pakistan and Afghanistan signed a U.N.-mediated accord
in Geneva, with the United States and Soviet Union signing as
guarantors.
   Under the accord, the Soviet army began withdrawing from
Afghanistan on May 15, with half of their about 100,000 troops out
in August.
   The Soviet Foreign Ministry said early this month that it has
``suspended'' the withdrawal because of attacks by U.S.- and
Pakistan-backed guerrillas, who have rejected the pact.
   Soviet troops intervened in Afghanistan in 1979.

<HEAD>Study Says America Shortchanging Half Its Youth</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NANCY BENAC</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   America is short-changing half its young adults
by treating those who don't attend college as failures and offering
them little help starting careers and families, according to a
report released Thursday.
   The study of 16- to-24-year-olds by the private Commission on
Youth and America's Future found that young people who lack college
training ``are far more constrained than were their peers of 15
years ago'' because of shrinking economic prospects.
   For those without a college degree, there are fewer ``jobs with a
future,'' real earnings are declining faster, unemployment is more
likely, and marriage is often postponed because of financial
pressures, it said.
   The study refers to the nation's 20 million non-college-bound
youth as the ``forgotten half'' of their generation, many of whom
never will overcome unemployment, part-time jobs with few benefits
and poverty-level wages.
   ``Too often, we think of the forgotten half as failures, as
second-rate, simply because they do not attend college,'' said
Harold Howe II, a former U.S. commissioner of education who headed
the 19-member commission. ``They must be viewed as our hope for the
future rather than as a generation of misfits.''
   Howe said at a news conference that the highest priority in
helping more young adults succeed should be to strengthen existing
programs to keep youngsters on the right track, such as Head Start
and the Job Corps. The commission recommended a $5 billion a year
increase in federal financing for such projects.
   The commission, established by the William T. Grant Foundation
and made up of people from business, labor, government, education
and health and human services, also recommended:
   _Creation of a five-year, $1.25 billion federally financed,
state-run national demonstration project to improve access to
education and training through financial aid, counseling and
academic support.
   _More community programs emphasizing service and leadership to
help young people get involved in civic activities, thereby building
self-respect and keeping them away from drugs and other trouble.
   _Expanded education, training and employment programs by
businesses and local governments that are targeted to young people.
   _Programs to strengthen adult-youth relationships in families,
including policies at schools and businesses that take into account
the demands placed on working parents.
   The report said the school reform movement of the 1980s has
focused too heavily on the college-bound and that financial support
for those students far outweighs what is available to those who
don't continue their education.
   College students typically can expect public-private subsidies of
$5,000 per school year through scholarships, grants and loans, while
only about 5 percent of eligible non-college-bound youth receive
federal job training assistance totaling $1,800-$2,300 over about
four months, it said.
   Daniel Yankelovich, a member of the commission and president of
The Yankelovich Group in New York City, said the relatively low
jobless rates of recent years mask the problem of high unemployment
and underemployment among young adults.
   ``Under those statistics is a festering problem that looks like
it's going to get worse and that merits the country's attention in a
way that is almost impossible to exaggerate,'' Yankelovich said.
``The 1990s, if something isn't done about this, will result in a
tremendous amount of social unrest.''
   Another commission member, Rev. Theodore M. Hesburgh, president
emeritus of Notre Dame, said the 208-page report was ``full of
hopelessness,'' but that its account of volunteers who haven't given
up on disadvantaged young people provides ``hope in what is
otherwise a dismal picture.''

   The government Thursday imposed
its first ban on a right-wing extremist group, and the ex-policeman
whose deadly shooting spree prompted the crackdown was sent to a
mental hospital for tests.
   Law and Order Minister Adriaan Vlok banned the White Liberation
Movement, a small white supremacist group, invoking the same
emergency regulations that have been used against black
anti-apartheid organizations.
   Barend Strydom, the 23-year-old gunman who killed six blacks in
Pretoria on Tuesday, has not been linked to the White Liberation
Movement but belongs to the neo-Nazi Afrikaner Resistance Movement,
a much larger, more influential group. Vlok, who promised a broad
crackdown on right-wing extremists because of the rampage, did not
explain why only the smaller group was banned.
   Strydom, who quit the national police force in February while
facing misconduct charges, was arraigned Thursday in Pretoria on
charges of murdering six blacks and wounding 17. Witnesses said he
laughed as he walked through the heart of the capital city Tuesday,
shooting his victims from close range with an automatic pistol.
   Dr. Willem Pieterse, a court-appointed psychiatrist, said Strydom
showed symptoms of being a psychopath and had expressed pride in
what he had done.
   Strydom, who smiled throughout the hearing, was sent to
Weskoppies Hospital for 30 days of observation and ordered to
reappear in court Dec. 19.
   Police said they were investigating the possibility Strydom was
involved in an incident Nov. 8 in which a black woman was shot to
death at a squatter camp south of Johannesburg.
   The White Liberation Movement was formed in 1985 but did not come
to public notice until 1987. Its leader, Johan Schabort, said it had
more than 1,000 members, but many more sympathizers.
   Aside from a few rallies and an attempt to march through a
multiracial area last year, little has been heard from the
organization.
   Schabort, a biochemist, was issued with restrictions Thursday
confining him to the area around his hometown of Brits and barring
him from addressing more than 10 people at a time.
   He said the government's action reduced the ``outlet for
frustration of white South Africans ... Now we cannot control people
who are worried about their race survival. Some of them could
organize underground.''
   Schabort's group has called for expulsion of all Jewish and
Indian South Africans and the removal of all blacks from white urban
centers, including the ``clearing out'' of Soweto, where 2.5 million
blacks live near Johannesburg.
   Schabort said he blamed the government for Tuesday's rampage.
   ``Whites are living under tremendous pressure and are being
undermined by blacks,'' he said. ``Many whites are also working
under tremendous pressure, especially in the police force.''
   Members of the national police force are prohibited from
belonging to the Afrikaner Resistance Movement, but observers
believe many officers have links or sympathies with the group.
   Members of the resistance movement frequently dress in khaki
uniforms and wear swastika-type emblems and weapons. The group's
leader, Eugene Terreblanche, says whites should fight any attempt by
the government to share political power with blacks.
   Strydom, who wore a khaki outfit at his arraignment, said he
rejected the court's authority.
   Speaking in Afrikaans, Strydom told the court, ``if communists
such as (Anglican Archbishop) Desmond Tutu and (former ambassador to
the United Kingdom) Denis Worrall are arrested, then I will
cooperate. I do not have any interest in appearing before this court
under the current state of government.''
   Strydom frequently turned to wave at his family in the courtroom,
which was packed and guarded by policemen with shotguns. In an
unusual move, photographers were allowed inside.
   Strydom's mother raised her fist and said, ``Strength,'' in
Afrikaans.
   Since Feb. 23, anti-apartheid organizations have been banned.
Government critics have asked why right-wing white organizations
that appear to espouse violence are not banned.

   A federal judge fined Orkin Exterminating Co.
$500,000 for a fumigation that killed a couple, and he said safety
practices at the nation's biggest pest-control service were
``scary'' in their laxity.
   Judge James Turk convicted Orkin in August of failing to monitor
the air before letting Hubert and Freida Watson back into their
Galax home in 1986.
   Turk on Wednesday imposed the maximum fine but said Orkin will
have to pay only $350,000 if it stays out of trouble during two
years of corporate probation.
   Turk also said officers of the company must perform 2,000 hours
of community service. The corporation was the only defendant in the
case.
   ``It's nothing short of scary the way the company was handling
its business,'' he said.
   Relatives of the victims declined comment as they left the
courtroom.
   Testimony indicated Orkin not only failed to monitor the air
after fumigating the Watsons' home, but also did not remove a
waterproof mattress cover on their bed.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Richard Pierce said poisonous gas seeped
into the mattress until the Watsons went to bed and their movements
released the gas.
   ``That was a tomb sealed up, waiting for the occupants to enter
and lay down and die,'' Pierce said.
   Watson, 73, and his 65-year-old wife died days later. Experts
said they were killed by Vikane, used to exterminate wood-boring
insects.
   Orkin President Bob Mercer took the stand and said he had
improved training since he took over the company in February. ``I
recognize there was a failure to carry out Orkin's policy and
procedures'' in the Watson case, Mercer said.
   Turk said he was appalled at testimony from past and present
Orkin employees who descibed a lack of compliance with safety
requirements and a lack of knowledge about them as well.
   ``It's almost a miracle that something like this didn't happen
before,'' Turk said.
   Ronald Dean Mullins, who supervised the Watson fumigation and
dozens of others, testified that he never bothered to read the fine
print on Vikane labels.
   Orkin's president and attorneys had no comment after sentencing.
Orkin spokeswoman Judy Donner said from the Atlanta headquarters
that Orkin was disappointed with the sentence but ``wants to express
sympathy to the Watson family for the loss.''
   Orkin reached an undisclosed settlement with the Watson estate
two months ago.

   A soldier was found guilty Thursday of
killing a farmer who tried to stop him from raping a 13-year-old
girl.
   Timothy Mhlanga was sentenced to death after being found guilty
of murder by Judge Ahmed Ebrahim and two civilian assessors in the
High Court. He also was sentenced to 10 years in prison for the rape
conviction.
   According to testimony, Mhlanga, one of 30 soldiers guarding a
bridge on the Mazoe River in northeastern Zimbabwe on Aug. 13, 1987,
was raping the girl when a man and his son walking nearby heard her
cries for help.
   Mhlanga opened fire at the two, killing Chakanetsa Zhogi. The son
escaped.
   Mhlanga, who pleaded innocent, testified he suspected the Zhogi
and his son were dissidents. He also said he had fought as a
guerrilla for President Robert Mugabe in the seven-year war that led
to Zimbabwe's independence from Britain in 1980.

   Folk singer Arlo Guthrie said he intends
to release what he calls a new and improved version of ``Alice's
Restaurant'' as soon as he finds ideal recording conditions.
   ``It's just a matter of getting the right recording of the right
timing of the right audience on the right night,'' Guthrie said.
   The anti-war ballad of the Vietnam era tells of the 41-year-old
songwriter's Thanksgiving Day arrest for littering.
   The song has been updated with Guthrie's comments on historical
events since the 1965 arrest that kept him out of the draft because
of his conviction on the littering charge, said Sharon Palma,
manager of Guthrie's label Rising Son Records.
   ``The funniest is that he hints at the coincidence that the only
things that are 18 minutes and 20 seconds long are the song and the
erased Nixon tapes,'' Palma said Thursday from the folk singer's
studio in this small Bershires Hills town.
   The song should be re-recorded soon, ``but with him you can never
tell,'' Palma said.

   A lawyer representing American actress Koo Stark, a
former girlfriend of Prince Andrew, said Thursday she plans to
proceed with a libel case against London's Daily Mirror.
   It will be the second legal action taken by Miss Stark, 32,
against publisher Robert Maxwell's newspapers.
   Earlier this month, Miss Stark was awarded $549,000 libel damages
in the High Court from the Sunday People newspaper over a story that
she had an affair with the prince after her marriage.
   ``So far as we are aware, an action will take place in the High
Court on Monday,'' said Miss Stark's lawyer, Keith Schilling.
   Miss Stark said the allegations about a continuing relationship
with the prince were published in December 1985 when she was having
marital problems, and dashed her hopes of reconciling with her
husband, Timothy Jeffries.

   A $765,000 lawsuit against rock singer
Billy Idol has been settled out of court for an undisclosed sum.
   Five people filed the circuit court lawsuit following a May 13,
1987, rock concert at Portland Memorial Coliseum during which fans
rushed the stage after Idol said, ``I feel lonely up here.''
   The remark prompted a disturbance as fans rushed a barricade and
knocked a number of people to the ground.
   The plaintiffs said they were sitting in seats in front when Idol
made his remark and the crowd behind them surged forward. As a
result, the plaintiffs alleged, they sustained various physical
injuries and emotional distress.
   The settlement involves all but one plaintiff, whose separate
lawsuit remains pending, said Elizabeth Sampson, a Portland lawyer
who represented Idol and a production company.
   ``The terms of the settlement are confidental,'' she said. ``The
defendants continue to deny any liability.''

   Joy Hall, a 10-year-old from Baltimore, was named
National Easter Seal Child for 1989 at the society's national
convention Thursday.
   Born with cerebral palsy, Joy lacks motor control in her legs and
arms. But with the help of leg braces, she hasn't allowed the
handicap to limit her activities.
   Joy participates in a gymnastics class geared to building
strength in children with disabilities. She also plays basketball
and bowls, and adds she isn't discouraged even when she throws a
gutter ball.
   ``Even if I do badly, I try,'' she says.
   Joy, a fifth-grader, attends a Baltimore public school. Her
mother, Janet, said her daughter established her independence at an
Easter Seal summer camp.
   As National Easter Seal Child, Joy will represent disabled people
who receive rehabilitation services from the nationwide network of
Easter Seal programs.
   Walter E. Shinault, 28 and a stock broker from Jackson, Miss.,
was named the National Easter Seal adult representative for 1989.

   Assailants hurled bombs at a public
meeting and into a video store Thursday, and police opened fire to
disperse anti-government protesters during ethnic unrest that killed
at least 17 people, officials said.
   One person was killed and 10 were injured when police opened fire
to break up an anti-government demonstration in the north-central
Kurunegala district, a government communique said.
   In Colombo, Sinhalese radicals threw bombs at a meeting being
addressed by Ossie Abeygoonasekara, one of the three candidates for
next month's presidential elections, police said.
   At least 40 people suffered minor injuries in the attack and an
ensuing stampede, said officials, who were not identified in
accordance with briefing rules.
   Military officials said three people were killed and one was
injured when a bomb was thrown at a video center just south of
Colombo.
   They said the video center was attacked because it stayed open
last week when the People's Liberation Front, a militant Sinhalese
group, called for an anti-government strike.
   The victims were shop employees.
   At least 13 people were killed by radical Sinhalese in the south
and center of the island, and three Sinhalese men were shot and
killed by Tamil rebels in the northeast, said police and military
officials.
   The attacks occurred Wednesday and Thursday. Officials said among
the victims were four government supporters, a bus driver, a school
principal, two employees of the Colombo port, a civilian clerk and
his nephew.
   The port employees were involved in compiling lists of employees'
names so police could escort them to work during a strike at the
port last week, sources said.
   The military officials gave no reasons for the other killings,
but the victims were believed to be Sinhalese who defied the strike.
   Sinhalese militants are agitating for the resignation of
President Junius R. Jayewardene, himself a Sinhalese. They are
opposed to an accord Jayewardene signed that is aimed at ending
Tamil rebels' five-year war for autonomy.
   Sinhalese radicals say the accord, signed July 29, 1987, makes
too many concessions to the minority Tamils, who comprise 18 percent
of the 16 million population.
   The main Tamil rebel group, the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam,
has refused to accept the accord, saying it does not go far enough.
   The People's Liberation Front stepped up its anti-government
campaign last week and called for a four-day strike in the south,
which crippled business in the Sinhalese heartland and caused food
and gasoline shortages.
   Jayewardene hit back by ordering troops to open fire at
anti-government demonstrations and decreeing the death penalty for
anyone convicted of instigating strikes.
   Jayewardene is to leave office in January and elections to choose
his successor are scheduled Dec. 19. The Front says he should resign
immediately.
   The group called for a boycott of the elections and has
threatened to kill all the candidates.

   James Earl Ray, serving 99 years in
prison for the 1968 assassination of civil rights leader Martin
Luther King Jr., has been granted a parole hearing in January.
   Ray, 60, pleaded guilty to shooting King with a high-powered
rifle in Memphis. He said he avoided a trial to escape a possible
death penalty but now wants the case heard by a jury.
   Ray became eligible for parole in November, said Gretchen
Faulstich, executive director of the Parole Board. The hearing was
continued until January pending a routine psychological evaluation
as well as his institutional record, Ms. Faulstich said.
   Ray is held at Brushy Mountain State Prison near Petros, from
which he escaped briefly in June 1977. He was tracked down in wooded
mountains nearby.
   Ray was a fugitive from a Missouri prison at the time King went
to Memphis to lend his support to a strike by sanitation workers
seeking higher pay. He was identified from fingerprints on a rifle,
found near the Lorraine Motel, where King was killed as he stood on
a balcony.
   On the day his trial was to begin, Ray entered a surprise guilty
plea. He began almost immediately to recant, claiming he was
pressured into entering the plea to escape the death penalty.
   He since has continuously proclaimed his innocence.

<HEAD>Six-Year Study Concludes Arts Need More Federal Support</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By W. DALE NELSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Government support of the arts is needed to
supplement private giving, a presidential committee told President
Reagan on Thursday after a six-year study.
   The committee, created by a presidential executive order in 1982,
presented its report to Reagan at a meeting in the Roosevelt Room of
the White House.
   The committee noted that during the 1980s there has been ``a
diminution of tax incentives for charitable giving'' and warned that
``reduced incentives can damage the vitality of American
philanthropy.''
   ``The main vehicle for support of the arts and humanities remains
private monies, a resource that must be encouraged and increased,''
the report said. ``We firmly believe government support is
necessary, however, for it seems clear that the culture of this
country cannot be sustained solely by private funding.''
   The federal government currently provides support for the arts
through the National Foundation on the Arts and the Humanities, and
the Institute of Museum Services, which have combined current
budgets of $330.1 million.
   The report called for the creation of a presidential commission
made up of both leading private citizens and government officials.
   ``There should be sufficient annual appropriations to sustain the
federal government's capacity as grantor; innovative leadership to
inspire its role as catalyst; and continued incentives through the
tax system to encourage private giving,'' the committee said.
   It said private giving to the arts and humanities has grown at a
greater rate than inflation since 1980 but the two major tax
revisions passed during the Reagan administration resulted in
reduced incentives for charitable contributions.
   The 35-member committee was made up of leaders of business,
government and the arts under the chairmanship of Andrew Heiskell,
retired chairman of Time Inc.
   It held meetings throughout the United States and made a
recommendation in 1984 that led to establishment of the National
Medal of Arts, presented annually by the president.
   Executive director Diane J. Paton said the committee operated on
an annual budget of about $300,000.

   Parents looking for ways to approach
their children on topics such as divorce, moving or even death may
soon turn to a greeting card.
   Hallmark Cards Inc. is launching a ``To Kids With Love'' line of
106 cards aimed at helping adults express their feelings to children.
   ``We see these cards as conversation starters, a way to initiate
face-to-face communication,'' said Tom Johnston, Hallmark brand
group vice president. ``They can also be used to boost a child's
self-esteem, to praise, show appreciation or help a child through a
difficult time.''
   The cards, under development for three years, will be shipped to
retailers in January, the company said. The cards are designed for
children ages 7 to 14 and will sell for 90 cents.
   ``They're not for birthdays or holidays. They're for all the
little moments and important events in every child's life,''
Johnston said.

<HEAD>Catholic Bishops Decry Religious Persecution in Soviet Bloc</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT FURLOW</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The nation's Roman Catholic bishops said
Thursday the U.S. government could help fight ``sustained and
comprehensive'' religious persecution in the Soviet bloc by linking
that issue to others the Soviets care about.
   In a lengthy document, the bishops detailed what they saw as
religious intolerance and discrimination in the nations of Eastern
Europe, but they also suggested the time may be right to win
improvement.
   They said Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev's stated policies of
openness and restructuring ``offer potentially significant changes
in thought and practice and deserve to be taken seriously and
encouraged ... as a potential basis for gradual expansion of
freedoms.''
   The U.S. government ``should consider the possibility of using
affirmative measures to influence human rights policies and
practices, including developing closer relations, extending credits
and encouraging cultural and educational exchanges and tourism,''
the bishops said.
   ``In all such initiatives U.S. diplomacy should make it clear
that continued improvement in relations will depend in part on
continued improvement with regard to religious liberty and human
rights.''
   The statement was approved on the last day of the annual meeting
of the National Conference of Catholic Bishops.
   Earlier Thursday, on a matter closer to home, the church leaders
called for changes in a 1986 federal law covering legalization of
illegal aliens, many of whom are Catholic Hispanics.
   They said more Hispanics should be allowed to stay in this
country legally, and they complained in particular that the law's
provisions on penalties for employers who hire undocumented workers
are poorly understood and lead to discrimination against Hispanic
workers in general.
   The two new statements backed up the declaration earlier this
week by the conference's president, Archbishop John L. May of St.
Louis, that the bishops would continue to speak out on controversial
public issues despite criticism.
   The bishops, leaders of the nation's largest religious
denomination with more than 53 million members, spent much of the
week concentrating on an intra-church dispute with the Vatican. They
rejected a Rome-prepared draft document that questioned the
authority of their conference and others like it.
   However, May continued to play down talk of any major
confrontation.
   ``I don't look on these discussions as a tug-of-war or an ongoing
fight or crisis or any of these words that are used,'' he said at a
news conference after the meeting ended Wednesday.
   ``We are in a most serene time,'' May said, adding that Pope John
Paul II had spoken favorably of the U.S. church during American
bishops' visits to Rome this year.
   The bishops appeared solidly united in loud voice votes favoring
the new statements on religion in Eastern Europe and on treatment of
Hispanic immigrants in the United States.
   Archbishop Roger Mahony of Los Angeles said the bishops were
challenging Soviet leaders, whose policies have heavy influence
throughout Eastern Europe, ``to match their recent talk of reform
with concrete action.''
   Despite improvements in some countries, the church leaders said
in their statement, ``The scale of persecution has been and remains
sustained and comprehensive, and its roster of victims all
inclusive: Catholics, Protestants, Orthodox, Jews, Muslims,
Jehovah's Witnesses and many others.''
   Although church attendance is sometimes allowed, religiously
active people are often subject to discrimination in other areas,
the bishops said.
   Concerning Hispanics, the church leaders said many employers
don't understand the immigration law's provisions and thus fire or
refuse to hire many eligible Hispanics out of fear of being raided
and fined by the government.
   The bishops called for action on three fronts: compiling detailed
records of discrimination to force Congress to change the law,
promoting legislation to provide legalization opportunities to more
recent immigrants and educating employers on provisions of the
current law.

<HEAD>Good Cheer Flows at Arrival of New Beaujolais</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SYDNEY RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Corner bistros overflowed with bon vivants and
parties sprouted in the most unlikely places as Parisians celebrated
the arrival of the new Beaujolais, joining other wine lovers
worldwide.
   Commuters rushing through the Gare de Lyon railway station at 7
a.m. were offered a Beaujolais breakfast, poured from a special
high-speed train that carried cases of the wine to the capital. A
huge crowd of happy commuters gathered around the railway car
flowing with Beaujolais ``primeur,'' the first wine produced from
the autumn harvest.
   Jean-Pierre Benoit, a grower pouring wine at the train, took a
few sips of the juicy Beaujolais nouveau himself before moving on to
the next official party, scheduled for 11 a.m.
   ``Wine drinking is a habit with people in Beaujolais,'' he said.
``I can go to 10 wine tastings and never get drunk ... at least I
hope so.''
   Benoit hurried from the station to a sound stage at Pathe Cinema
in Montmartre where a reconstructed Beaujolais village served as the
setting for an elaborate tasting attended by about 500 journalists
and friends of the Beaujolais wine growers association.
   ``This wine is completely different from last year's, much more
of a Gamay taste,'' said Michel Deflache, who produces wine on land
owned by his family since 1550 and also serves as spokesman for the
Beaujolais wine growers' association.
   Deflache poured glasses of wine under a plastic cherry tree on
the town's quaint main street, across from an old-fashioned pharmacy.
   ``This year's Beaujolais is generous in the mouth, more
full-bodied. It is a more masculine wine,'' Deflache said.
   Across town at Le Val d'Or wine bar off the Champs Elysees, owner
Geraud Rongier was quickly emptying two 220-liter barrels. ``This
year, it's good, very light, very perfumed,'' Rongier said.
   Le Figaro newspaper described this year's batch as ``more
nuanced, more subtle, more traditional than last year's'' which was
said to have an aftertaste of bananas.
   Wine growers say the 1988 vintage has had the advantage of being
one of the earliest harvests in a long while. The harvest Sept. 10,
compared with Sept. 22 last year, gave producers a longer time to
make the wine which is meant to be consumed quickly, but benefits
from a few weeks in the bottle.
   Not all Frenchmen are seduced by the hype and extravagant
tastings, and remind the unwary foreigner that the new Beaujolais
once was regarded as cheap table wine.
   ``I never drank the stuff before all this started and I still
don't,'' growled one seasoned customer in a bar Thursday morning.
   Two decades of clever marketing have paid off and more than half
of this year's estimated 50 million bottles of new Beaujolais will
be exported.
   Since Monday, jets, trucks and trains have been delivering the
wine to far-flung bon vivants, some of whom beat Parisians to the
first sip.
   Australians claimed they were the first, popping corks on the
simple, fruity wine 11 hours ahead of the French because of the
difference in time zones.
   Japanese wine lovers held parties at restaurants about 8 hours
before the French. Officials at Suntory Ltd., a major Japanese
distiller and importer, said overall Japanese imports will total
153,000 cases, an increase of 70 percent over last year.
   The wine, which sells for about $3.30 a bottle here, will cost
the equivalent of $42 a bottle in Tokyo restaurants, according to
wine officials in Beaujolais.
   Although Japan is the fastest growing market for the new wine,
which accounts for 55 percent of the total Beaujolais crop, it is
not the biggest market. West Germany, Britain and Switzerland
combined drink 60 percent of the exported Beaujolais nouveau.
   The U.S. market represents about 10 percent of the new Beaujolais
sales and celebrations were planned for Thursday in New York, San
Francisco, Los Angeles, Dallas, Atlanta and Pittsburgh.
   About 500 people were expected at a Beaujolais soiree sponsored
by the French Embassy in San Salvador, Deflache said.
   ``There are always new markets for this uncomplicated wine,'' he
said. ``And everyone likes an occasion to party.''

   Two Belgian air force F-16 jet fighters
crashed Thursday in separate incidents, and their pilots escaped
injury, the Defense Ministry said.
   The pilots ejected and parachuted to safety.
   The first plane had taken off from the nearby air force base of
Kleine Brogel and was on a training flight when it hit birds and
crashed in Kaulille, a ministry official said.
   Military investigators had gone to the scene near the Dutch
border, about 60 miles northeast of Brussels, the capital, said the
official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   The second plane crashed in Willbringen, 19 miles east of
Brussels. No reason was given for the crash.
   The crashes brought to 19 the number of F-16s lost by the Belgian
air force since it started using the planes in 1979.

   It's bearly believeable, but a 7-foot
stuffed grizzly swiped more than two years ago from its place of
honor at the University of California has written to say he may be
coming home.
   Stanford University's News and Publications office says it
received a letter Wednesday from the behemoth, which vanished Aug.
3, 1986, from his home in a display case on the Berkeley campus. No
charges were filed, but most folks at Berkeley believe the abduction
was master-minded by students at rival Stanford.
   The two schools meet Saturday for a football game that in the San
Francisco Bay area is called ``The Big Game.''
   In the letter, the missing bear said he had visited Disneyland,
Reno, Nev., and gone to the Olympics in Seoul. He also expressed
concern about Berkeley's decline in a U.S. News and World Report
survey of top-rated universities. The campus dropped from No. 7 to
No. 24 in the rankings.
   ``If I stay away any longer,'' the note said, ``it may become a
junior college.''
   The bear also appeared a bit miffed that his pals at Berkeley had
failed to follow up on a ransom note. ``It seems like everybody's
forgotten I've been on vacation with my friends at Stanford,'' he
groused.
   Yet the beast appeared ready to let bygones be bygones.
   ``I've had a great time on the farm (a nickname for the Stanford
campus),'' the letter read. ``But I think it's about time to go
back.''

   A 12-year-old lowland gorilla who made a
hit in her last home with unexpected trips outside her cage is on
loan in Columbus to become a mate and stepmother.
   Molly has been introduced to what Columbus Zoo officials hope
will be her new mate, Bongo, and Bongo's son, Fossey.
   Bongo has been raising Fossey for over a year since the young
gorilla's mother, Bridgette, died from peritonitis. Molly was
airlifted Oct. 4 from the Kansas City, Mo., Zoo to take over
mothering Fossey and perhaps _ in concert with Bongo _ raise a few
Fosseys of her own.
   The loan is part of a national endangered-species breeding
program. If Molly becomes a mother, the Kansas City Zoo gets her
first female child. Columbus gets her first son, and the zoos will
alternate taking later offspring.
   This is Molly's first trip away from Kansas City, but not her
first adventure. She gained notoriety for unscheduled jaunts outside
her cage at the Kansas City Zoo's Great Ape House.
   On her first trip out, Molly propped a stick against a wall and
used it to climb out. For her second outing, she climbed atop the
ape house roof and jumped onto a walkway, Kansas City Zoo
spokeswoman Jori Glazer said recently.
   Her keeper at Kansas City, Karen Kline, said Molly was a pleasure
to know.
   ``Molly knows a few sign words _ she can say she's hungry, can
say `I see you,' show people her teeth, can comb her hair,'' Ms.
Kline said. ``We didn't keep up with her teaching _ we wanted her to
relate to gorillas instead of people _ but she retained the
knowledge.''
   The gorilla's socialization is coming along just fine, said
Charlene Jendry, Molly's Columbus keeper.
   ``By day 10, she was having long playing sessions with Fossey,''
she said. ``She's now allowing him to reach through the mesh
(separating their cages) and take her food. The other day, Fossey
took one of the two halves of orange Molly gets in the afternoons,
and Molly didn't do a thing.''

   Two railroad mechanics whose negligence led to a
train wreck last year in which 106 people were killed have been
sentenced to 12 years each in prison, Tass said Thursday.
   The mechanics, who it identified only as Trusov and Puzanov, were
the last to check the brakes on a freight train that slammed into a
Moscow-bound night express at the Kamenskaya station near Rostov in
southern Russia, the official nes agency said.
   Brake failure on the freight train, pulling cars loaded with
grain, was found to be the cause of the accident that occurred Aug.
7, 1987.
   The engineer of the freight train, identified only as Batushkin,
still suffers from injuries caused by the accident and faces a later
trial, Tass said. It did not specify the charges against him.
   The report said 106 people had died in the crash, 24 people were
injured and damage was put at more than $2.4 million.
   Tass said the court sent a message to the Soviet Railway Ministry
complaining about frequent violations of rules at the Kamenskaya
station.

<TEXT>
   Burning of more than 450 Pershing 2 rocket
motors as part of the Treaty on Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces
will begin Dec. 5 at the Pueblo Army Depot Activity, the Army
announced Thursday.
   Similar motor burns have been going on at the Longhorn Army
Ammunition Plant near Marshall, Texas, since Sept. 8.
   Army spokesmen said the Pueblo burns would be witnessed by a team
from the Soviet Union, as called for in the treaty.
   The rocket motors will be static fired, restrained by a concrete
and steel structure. The burned-out motor cases then will be crushed
and buried at the depot, 16 miles east of Pueblo.
   The Colorado Department of Health gave permission Nov. 1 for the
Army to burn the motors. The permit requires emissions monitoring,
governs the frequency of burns and limits them to be fired only when
winds from the west are 4 mph or greater and only during daylight.
   Only one missile can be fired per hour and no more than six per
day. Emissions of any pollutant may not exceed 250 tons per year.
   The depot is scheduled to destroy 234 Pershing 2 Stage I motors,
each containing 7,940 pounds of propellant, and 233 Pershing 2 Stage
2 motors, each containing 4,940 pounds of propellant, state
authorities said.
   The rest of the Army's stockpile of 849 Pershing 2 missiles are
being destroyed at the Texas site, Army spokesmen said.
   The burn-date announcement caps an 11-month process that included
a test firing of one rocket motor last May at the depot. Public
meetings and hearings and analysis of environmental effects also
were part of the process.
   At the time the permit was issued, Gov. Roy Romer said he had
wanted Colorado to help destroy the motors ``so that this country
could fulfill its treaty obligations. However, I wanted it to be
done safely and we have worked that out with the U.S. Army.''

   Some 10,000 billboards proclaiming ``Erase
Illiteracy'' will appear along U.S. roads this year in a drive
launched Thursday by two government agencies and the nation's
printing and outdoor advertising industries.
   The billboards are painted to look like blackboards. The words
``Erase Illiteracy'' are printed in yellow on top of a book and the
word ``Read.''
   Education Secretary Lauro Cavazos said there are 27 million
functional illiterates in America and another 40 million to 50
million people who can't read above a 4th grade level.
   He called the billboard initiative ``a perfect example'' of the
type of public-private cooperation needed to reverse the trend
toward illiteracy. He said the number of illiterate adults is rising
by more than 1 million a year.
   ``Public awareness is a terribly important piece of licking the
problem,'' said Thelma Reese, head of Philadelphia's literacy
commission. ``It really does lessen the shame of coming forward.''
   Sponsors of the billboard effort are the Education Department,
the Government Printing Office, the Outdoor Advertising Association
of America and Printing Industries of America Inc.

   Pop star Elton John and his wife, Renate, announced
Thursday they have separated and plan to divorce because after four
years of marriage ``we are growing apart.''
   They said in a statement they were saddened, but were ``parting
on the most amicable terms and genuinely intend to remain best
friends.''
   The divorce, ``by mutual consent,'' will come into effect
automatically in two years, they said. They have no children.
   ``Both of us have been, and will be, so busy with our own work
commitments that we are seeing too little of each other _ and for
this reason it seems unavoidable that we are growing apart,'' they
said.
   The statement quoted John's 34-year-old wife as saying: ``We are
both confident that all personal matters will be resolved without
any animosity. I am obviously saddened to see our marriage end. I
wish Elton all the happiness in the world, and I know that he wishes
me the same.'''
   It added that no information about the financial terms of the
settlement would be released and no further statements would be
issued.
   John, 41, married Ms. Blauel, a German-born recording engineer,
in a show-business wedding in 1984 in Sydney, Australia, where he
was on a concert tour. He has sold more than 80 million records.

<HEAD>North, South Korea Make Progress at Talks</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Officials from South Korea and North
Korea made progress Thursday in efforts to hold parliamentary talks
on peace measures on the peninsula, including a declaration of
non-aggression.
   The progress raised hopes that the rival states would be able to
begin major political negotiations next year.
   ``There was big progress today and I myself was surprised (at
it),'' chief South Korean delegatge Park Joon-kyu said after the
meeting at this truce village of Panmunjom, 35 miles north of Seoul.
   Park's North Korean counterpart, Chon Kum Chol, also noted the
progress and said, ``The meeting achieved progress, and I hope we
would be able to come to a complete agreement before the end of this
year.''
   Park, heading the five-member South Korean team, said the two
sides could solve all pending issues, including an agenda, when they
meet for a seventh round of talks at this village Dec. 15.
   The progress came as a surprise because all past talks on the
subject ended in deadlock with neither side willing to make major
concessions. The last meeting here on Oct. 13 broke up over basic
and procedural matters.
   The meeting Thursday was the sixth session since mid-August on
trying to set the terms for full-scale talks between the two
nations' parliaments on non-aggression, economic and humanitarian
negotiations.
   The meeting made a headway when North Korea surprisingly accepted
most of earlier South Korean proposals on the format of reduced main
talks and other procedural matters.
   At the start of the meeting, the two sides quickly agreed the
full legislatures of each side would attend the start of the
negotiations in the North Korean capital of Pyongyang.
   North Korea proposed actual talks should be handled by 100
delegates from each side, while the south said 20 from each side
would be more pradctical.
   North Korea revised its figure to 50, which South Korea finally
accepted. The North Koreans also made some procedural changes,
prompting South Korean delegates to delcare that they would be able
to travel to the northern capital next spring to begin main
negotiations.
   ``I am very much hopeful that we can go to Pyongyang when the ice
on the Daedong River breaks,'' said Park, the senior South Korean
delegate, referring to the river that flows through Pyongyang.
   Park also expressed optimism that the two Koreas would be able to
agree on an agenda at the next meeting. A three-point agenda,
proposed by South Korea, called for multilateral personnel and
material exchanges, the declaration of non-aggression and summit
talks.
   South Korea originally had sought to sign a non-aggression pact,
but had to agree to a North Korean proposal for a non-aggression
declaration. Pyongyang maintains the two Koreas cannot conclude a
non-aggression pact, because they are one nation, not two separate
states.
   Despite Park's optimism, his North Korean counterpart told a news
conference after the meeting that the non-aggression declaration
should consider the removal of the 42,000 U.S. troops in South Korea
and nuclear weapons in their arsenal.
   South Korean officials suspect the communist north would try to
use full-scale talks to gain withdrawal of U.S. forces from the
south. South Korea sees U.S. troops as vital to its defense and the
issue would stalemate any non-aggression talks.
   The nations have hundreds of thousands of troops poised along
their 150-mile border. They have clashed repeatedly since the Korean
War ended in 1953, they have no formal ties and the border is sealed.
   Talks between South and North Korea have been on and off since
the early 1970s, but no significant progress has been made.

<HEAD>Children's Groups Launch Personal Safety Program for Youngsters</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two children's safety groups announced a
program Thursday to teach youngsters how to protect themselves
against abuse, exploitation and abduction without unduly alarming
them.
   The program, known as ``Kids and Company: Together for Safety,''
teaches youngsters about personal safety ``in a very upbeat way''
that bolsters their self-esteem, said John Walsh, whose 6-year-old
son, Adam, was abducted from a Florida shopping mall and killed in
1981.
   Walsh, who founded the Adam Walsh Child Resource Center and
serves on the board of the National Center for Missing and Exploited
Children, said the program teaches grade school-age youngsters how
to protect themselves without frightening them. The two centers
worked together to develop the program.
   It teaches youngsters to ``use your brain, train your body, trust
your feelings and remember your friends'' in uncomfortable
situations. The teaching materials include teachers' guides, a
teacher training video, an in-class video, student activity sheets
and a materials for parents.
   Walsh said that following his son's death, he and his wife, Reve,
wondered ``if we had told Adam appropriate things'' about how to
protect himself.
   ``We agonized on many occasions and said, `Maybe we shouldn't
have made him, or tried to make him, so polite, so much of a little
gentleman,''' Walsh said. ``Maybe he'd be here today if he had
better tools, if he knew he could have said no, or he could have
yelled, or run.''
   ``Our children have the right to have the skills and confidence
they need to play an active role in their personal safety,'' Walsh
said. ``Children have the right to know that they can say no.''
   The program is to be launched initially in school districts in
Rochester, N.Y.; Marlboro, Mass.; Fort Lauderdale, Fla.; Nashua,
N.H.; and Orange County, Calif.
   Digital Equipment Corp. contributed more than $300,000 toward its
development.

   Emperor Hirohito, bedridden for nearly two months
since he fell seriously ill, is becoming weaker and more anemic,
palace officials said Thursday.
   Hirohito's voice ``is so feeble these days his doctors and nurses
wouldn't hear him very well,'' said Kenji Maeda, spokesman for the
Imperial Household Agency.
   The 87-year-old monarch vomited blood Sept. 19 and has since
suffered from bleeding near his upper intestine, where doctors
performed a bypass operation last year.
   He has received 42 pints of blood in transfusions and gets about
600 calories intravenously each day.
   Although doctors have found no signs of internal bleeding during
the past week, the emperor is becoming anemic and weaker, Maeda told
reporters.
   ``More often there are moments when the doctors can't tell if the
emperor is awake or asleep,'' he said.
   There were no immediate plans for further blood transfusions, he
said, adding that doctors were concentrating on maintaining, rather
than improving, the emperor's condition.
   By late afternoon, Hirohito had a temperature of 99.9 degrees.
The emperor's normal temperature is about 95.9 degrees.
   Palace officials have not given details on Hirohito's illness,
and they would not comment on Japanese news reports that the emperor
has pancreatic cancer.

   A small plane carrying reporters on a press
trip crashed in heavy fog west of Paris shortly after takeoff
Thursday, killing all seven people aboard, authorities said.
   Rescue workers combed the wreckage of the Cessna-441 that crashed
about 10:30 a.m. in a field near the Saclay lagoons on the edge of
the Essonne and Yvelines districts outside Paris, for remains of the
victims.
   The flight roster listed 10 people, according to the General
Direction for Civil Aviation, but some of the reporters failed to
show up for the trip to central France for the test driving of a BMW
M3.
   The cause of the crash was not known.
   The plane took off in heavy fog from the Toussus-le-Noble airport
in the Yvelines and was headed first for a factory in Montlucon, in
central France, then on to a race circuit in Mas-du-Clos.
   The flight was organized in part by Garage du Bac, a major BMW
dealership in France.
   Killed were journalists Francois-Xavier Beaudet of the sports
daily l'Equipe; Denis Charpentier of Argus Automobile; Geoffroy Le
Maignan of the Journal de l'Automobile; and Ramond Boche of Sport
Automobile; photographer Marc Duick; Garage du Bac competition
director Jean-Claude Depince; and the pilot, Daniel Touzard.

<TEXT>
   Benazir Bhutto's populist party defeated
the right wing in the first free election since a coup ousted her
father 11 years ago, and she expressed confidence Thursday that she
can form a majority coalition.
   Ms. Bhutto said her Pakistan People's Party ``has emerged as the
largest single party'' in the National Assembly as a result of
Wednesday's parliamentary election.
   ``Given consultations with different groups and independent
people, we are confident that we can get a simple majority,'' the
35-year-old political leader declared after arriving in this
southern city for coalition talks. She would be the first woman to
lead a Moslem nation.
   Her party captured 92 seats in the 237-member assembly, compared
with 55 for the nine-party conservative Islamic Democratic Alliance.
The alliance includes supporters of Gen. Mohammed Zia ul-Haq, the
military president killed in a plane crash three months ago.
   Independents and minor parties got 57 seats. Results from 13
districts were not available and 20 seats reserved for women will be
filled later by vote of the assembly.
   The last free National Assembly election in 1977 was a landslide
for Prime Minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, who founded the Pakistan
People's Party, and Gen. Zia overthrew him soon afterward. Bhutto
was convicted of complicity in a political murder plot and hanged in
1979.
   In Washington, the State Department praised Pakistan, a U.S.
ally, for the elections. Spokesman Charles Redman said: ``We
congratulate the Pakistani people and their leaders for this
impressive and important step in strengthening democracy in
Pakistan.''
   At her family home in Larkana earlier Thursday, Ms. Bhutto urged
President Ghulam Ishaq Khan to give her party the mandate to form a
government.
   She said she wouild begin coalition talks Friday, but would not
name parties on the list. Likely candidates are some of her
left-leaning partners in the former opposition alliance called the
Movement for the Restoration of Democracy.
   Ms. Bhutto also is expected to consult a relatively new party of
Moslem immigrants from India called the MQM, which carried the
southern cities Karachi and Hyderabad.
   Her personal popularity was demonstrated by the fact that she ran
for three National Assembly seats and won them all. Two will have to
be filled through by-elections.
   The constitution requires the president to designate a person to
form a government who will be ``most likely to command the
confidence of the majority of the National Assembly,'' which usually
would mean the leader of the largest party.
   Ishaq Khan was asked Wednesday whether he would be reluctant to
choose a woman in this male-dominated society, and he replied: ``I
think a woman prime minister might be a good change.''
   Pakistan's official news agency said the president sent
congratulatory telegrams to election winners but it did not mention
deliberations on the choice of a prime minister.
   Before Ms. Bhutto left for Karachi, about 5,000 supporters
gathered outside the family villa in Karkana, dancing jubilantly and
chanting: ``Benazir, prime minister!''
   No major election-related violence or fraud was reported by
officials through Thursday but reports of three violent deaths
appeared in newspapers.
   Thousands policemen and soldiers patrolled Sind, a southern
province noted for ethnic violence, on election day.
   Both Ms. Bhutto and the conservative alliance have said they
would continue Pakistan's friendship with the United States and its
support of Moslem guerrillas fighting the communist government of
neighboring Afghanistan.
   Although Ms. Bhutto also said she would pursue Zia's program of
increasing the influence of Islam in the nation's life, she pledged
not to let the religious policy interfere with the rights women and
minorities.
   Mrs. Bhutto attended both Harvard and Oxford and is considered
Westernized. She lived in Europe for several years while Zia was in
power.
   Zia ruled by martial law for eight years after the coup, then
held national elections 1985 in which political parties were not
permitted to enter candidates. Mrs. Bhutto's party and others in the
opposition boycotted the elections.
   The general dismissed the government and National Assembly in May
on grounds of corruption, incompetence and delay in putting Pakistan
under Islamic law. Zia called Wednesday's election before the plane
crash Aug. 17 in which he, the U.S. ambassador and 28 other people
were killed.

   A judge ruled Thursday that some
leaders of the nation's biggest anti-apartheid group committed
treason by inciting violence during township unrest in 1984, a crime
punishable by death.
   The judge did not say which of the 16 defendants were guilty of
treason. He acquitted three other defendants in the case, South
Africa's longest-running political trial. It began in June 1985.
   Supreme Court Justice Kees van Dijkhorst's decision was contained
in a 1,521-page summary, which the judge began reading three days
ago. Verdicts against individuals may not be announced until next
week.
   The three best-known defendants are senior leaders of the United
Democratic Front who have been held 40 months without bail: Popo
Molefe, 36, who was the coalition's national secretary; Terror
Lekota, 40, who was its chief spokesman; and Moses Chikane, 40, a
leader of its Transvaal Province branch.
   Those acquitted Thursday were the Rev. Geoff Motselane, 41; Oupa
Hlomuka, 35, and Patrick Baleka, 29.
   The United Democratic Front, banned in February, was formed in
1983 to mobilize opposition to a new constitution that excluded the
black majority from representation in Parliament.
   All 19 defendants pleaded innocent to charges of treason,
terrorism, murder and subversion related to allegations the Front
and its affiliates incited violence when unrest broke out in black
townships in 1984.
   Van Dijkhorst said that because violence was an intended facet of
the uprising in the townships, the state had proved the crime of
treason.
   The charges of murder, which also carry a possible death penalty,
relate to the mob killings of black town councilors during the Vaal
Triangle rioting.
   Van Dijkhorst said one of the defendants, Thomas Manthatha, urged
residents in the area to kill councilors. He also said the Vaal
Civic Association, a Front affiliate to which several defendants
belonged, encouraged confrontational protests that sparked rioting.
   The Front grew into the largest opposition group in South Africa,
encompassing more than 600 affiliated groups with about 2 million
members. Most of its leaders are in detention, in hiding or barred
from political activity.
   Van Dijkhorst accepted the prosecutors' allegation that the group
was supported and guided by the African National Congress, the main
anti-government guerrilla movement. Front leaders maintained they
endorsed the ANC's political goals, such as a one-person, one-vote
system, but did not advocate the use of violence.
   Van Dijkhorst has presided over the non-jury trial since its
start and has sole responsibility for the verdict and sentencing.
   There originally were 22 defendants in the trial, conducted for
many months in the town of Delmas before being shifted to Pretoria.
Three men were acquitted in 1986.

   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev left Thursday for
India where he is expected to hold several meetings with Prime
Minister Rajiv Gandhi during a three-day visit, Tass said.
   The official Soviet news agency ran a one-paragraph annoucement
of his departure for New Delhi, and later said that Gorbachev had
arrived in Tashkent, the capital of the Uzbek Soviet republic.
   It did not say what Gorbachev's schedule would be in Tashkent,
but Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady I. Gerasimov said such a stop
was normal in the long trip from Moscow to New Delhi. The meetings
in New Dehli will begin Friday.
   The trip will be Gorbachev's second visit to India since assuming
leadership in 1985.
   Gorbachev and Gandhi are expected to focus on expanding trade,
sharing technology and changing relations between the United States
and the Soviet Union. An agreement to increase the value of
Soviet-Indian trade to $4.7 billion in 1989 was signed Wednesday, up
from an estimated $1.9 billion last year.
   Other agreements to be signed involve cooperation in the areas of
the economy, culture and energy.
   Next month, Gorbachev will travel to the United States, Cuba and
Britain.

<HEAD>U.S. Rice Official Assails `Evil Empire'' of Japanese Agriculture</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Japan's refusal to import U.S. rice is the work of
an ``evil empire'' of cooperatives manipulating its agricultural
scene, the head of the U.S. Rice Millers' Association said Thursday.
   ``(It) is a fantastic example of economic distortion and it
basically stinks,'' said Stephen Gabbert, president of the group of
rice producers in six U.S. states.
   He said Japan could start to ease much of what he sees as its
social problems by liberaling its strictly controlled rice market.
   In October, the U.S. government rejected a petition by the Rice
Millers' Association complaining about Japan's ban on rice imports.
But it noted Japan's policy contravened trade agreements.
   Gabbert reserved his sharpest attack for the network of
agricultural cooperatives that are powerful political lobbyists with
huge economic resources.
   Japan's rice policy, Gabbert said, ``is tied to a cooperative
framework which I would characterize as basically an evil empire.''
   The cooperative movement is supposed to help Japanese farmers and
consumers, but ``it exploits farmers and gouges consumers,'' he
claimed.
   He said the cooperatives had mounted an expensive lobbying effort
in the United States against U.S. rice exports, resulting in what he
saw as some ``jaw-droppers'' in American news reports and editorials
saying Washington should not press Japan to open its sacrosanct rice
market.
   After laborious negotiations earlier this year, Japan agreed to
accept more U.S. beef and oranges, but firmly rejected calls to open
its rice market. Rice is Japan's staple food and the government
policy is to keep self-sufficiency in rice, though it requires
massive subsidies to farmers and retail prices more than triple
those in the United States.
   ``We shouldn't have any sacred or cultural cows in trade
relationships,'' Gabbert said. ``These kinds of sensitivities should
not be reasons for avoiding confronting trade issues.''
   Rice in Japan costs $3.85 for 2.2 pounds, compared with $1 in the
United States.
   Japan's 122 million people consume about 10.3 million tons of
rice a year. The government subsidy last year, including some
payments to keep paddy fields idle, was $3.6 billion.
   Gabbert proposed a gradual opening of 2.5 percent a year of
Japan's rice market over a four-year period. Ten percent of Japan's
rice market would be as much as American growers could produce, he
said.
   Gabbert said he was aiming for $300 million worth of the Japanese
rice market. He said American farmers can deliver milled rice at 400
dollars a ton versus $2,500 a ton in Japan.
   If Japan liberalizes its market, he predicted that Japanese
farmers would become more efficient, that land and housing prices
would go down because some paddy land would be freed for housing,
and that Japanese consumers could spend less on agricultural
products and more on manufactured imports, thus further helping the
country reduce its huge trade surplus.

   A former Nazi was acquitted Thursday of
complicity in the murder of 177 French Jews sent to Auschwitz, a
verdict that drew shouts of ``Nazi murderer!'' from victims'
relatives and spectators.
   Count Modest Korff was accused of ordering the deportations of
Jews from the Chalons-sur-Marne region of northeastern France, where
he served as Gestapo chief in 1942 and 1943.
   State Court Judge Martin Lickfett said the five-member panel
decided there was insufficient evidence to tie Korff to the deaths
of 177 people he was accused of deporting.
   ``The proceedings were interrupted by shouts of `Nazi murderer!'
and `this is a Nazi court!''' said a court spokeswoman, Eva Marie
Zakosek-Ruehling.
   Korff, 79, left the courtroom after the verdict was read and
could not immediately be reached for comment. Phone calls to his
home in the Bonn suburb of Koenigswinter were not answered.
   During the trial, Korff claimed he did not know about the
extermination of Jews when he served as Gestapo chief in
Nazi-occupied France. The Nazis killed an estimated 6 million Jews
during their rule from 1933 to 1945.
   Ms. Zakosek-Ruehling said the defendant showed no emotion during
announcement of the verdict or the outbursts from spectators who
packed the small courtroom in central Bonn. The panel was composed
of two jurors and three judges.
   About 20 French relatives of Nazi victims were among the
spectators, as well as French Nazi hunter Serge Klarsfeld.
Spectators said the French spectators included relatives of those
whom Korff was accused of deporting.
   Klarsfeld led prosecutors to Korff.
   Klarsfeld and the others who had traveled from France stormed out
of the courtroom to show their disapproval of the verdict, Ms.
Zakosek-Ruehling said in an interview with The Associated Press.
   Until his retirement in the early 1970s, Korff served as a
ministerial adviser with the West German Economics Ministry. He was
free during the trial, which began in September 1987.
   The acquittal follows a period of extreme sensitivity over
Germany's Nazi past after last week's 50th anniversary of
Kristallnacht, when Nazi thugs destroyed Jewish homes and businesses
and beat up Jews.
   Jewish community leaders were outraged by a speech in which
Parliament President Philipp Jenninger referred to the early Nazi
years as ``glorious'' in an attempt to explain Hitler's initial
appeal to the German public.
   Jenninger, a member of Chancellor Helmut Kohl's Christian
Democrat party, was forced to resign the next day.
   There have also been a number of desecrations of Jewish monuments
and cemeteries reported after the Kristallnacht observances.

   Police on Thursday said they
arrested three Dominicans and a Puerto Rican for trying to smuggle
$10 million worth of cocaine from the Dominican Republic.
   Members of a special anti-narcotics squad, the Rapid Action
Force, seized a 36-foot luxury yacht containing 138 pounds of
cocaine Wednesday night two miles off the western coast of Puerto
Rico, said police spokesman Tony Santiago.
   ``The cocaine was well-packaged to hide its odor,'' Santiago said.
   Santiago estimated the cocaine was worth $10 million. He said the
yacht, which he valued at $125,000, was registered in the United
States but flew a Dominican Republic flag.
   Javier Vazquez, a customs agent in the western town of Mayaguez,
said police boarded the yacht at 10 p.m.
   The four suspects will be arraigned in San Juan Thursday.

   A man convicted last year of leading the

defraud the European Economic Community, the Italian news agency
ANSA reported.
   Convicted along with Michele Greco were his brother, Salvatore,
and four other men.
   Greco already is serving a life term for leading the Mafia's
executive commission, which ordered the 1982 execution of Gen. Carlo
Alberto Dalla Chiesa, chief of the government's fight against the

   The Greco brothers were partners with two other men, Giovanni di
Pace and Michelangelo Aiello, in a fruit company based in southern
Sicily, ANSA said.
   The men were convicted of falsifying figures submitted to the EEC
on the amount of fruit they destroyed instead of sending it to
market, in order to earn EEC agricultural subsidies, ANSA said.
   The four also were convicted of bribing two employees of Italy's
Institute of Foreign Trade to hide the fraud, ANSA said.

   President-elect George Bush today named New
Hampshire Gov. John Sununu as his White House chief of staff and
announced campaign manager Lee Atwater as his choice to head the
Republican National Committee.
   The selection of Sununu prompted a decision by long-time aide
Craig Fuller to leave Bush's service. Fuller had served as the vice
president's chief of staff and made it clear he wanted the powerful
White House post.
   ``John Sununu has the background and experience necessary to work
not only with his former colleagues in the nation's statehouses but
also to build a constructive relationship with the U.S. Congress,''
Bush said.
   He said the outgoing three-term governor's background as an
engineer, college professor, small businessman and governor ``will
bring a refreshing new perspective that in my view is critical. He
is the right man in the job.''
   ``I'm eager to take up the challenge. It is going to be a very
important few years,'' the new chief of staff told reporters.
   Sununu's selection appeared to fuel the departure of Fuller.
   In a telephone interview, Fuller said he told Bush in October
that ``I wanted to return to the private sector.'' But he said he
also told Bush during that conversation that ``obviously, I would be
eager'' to serve as chief of staff, often called the second most
powerful position in the White House.
   Fuller, who served as Bush's vice presidential chief of staff
since 1985, said he will resign when Bush's transition is completed
in January.
   Sununu, credited with engineering Bush's New Hampshire primary
win, brings to the job a reputation as an aggressive, hands-on
manager.
   His appointment cheered conservatives, but worried some on
Capitol Hill as well as Jewish leaders. He was the only one of 50
governors who refused to back a statement denouncing a United
Nations resolution that equated Zionism with racism.
   He said he would remain governor through his term, which ends
Jan. 5. But he said he would continue to consult with Bush's
transition team.
   As Bush's choice, Atwater was certain to be elected to succeed
Frank Fahrenkopf Jr. as chairman of the Republican Party. Fahrenkopf
is a 48-year-old Reno lawyer whose seven years in the post make him
the longest-serving GOP chief in this century.
   ``I expect the party to move forward and grow. I will strongly
recommend to members of the national committee Lee Atwater to become
the chairman,'' said Bush, describing Atwater as a master of
grassroots politics.
   ``He's a friend; I'm proud of his accomplishments,'' Bush said of
the man who helped orchestrate his presidential victory.
   Atwater, 37, is a South Carolina native who earlier served as an
aide to President Reagan and also worked for Sen. Strom Thurmond of
South Carolina. After the 1984 election, Atwater became a partner in
the lobbying firm of Black, Manafort & Stone.
   Sununu was asked whether he would have trouble in Washington,
given that he has never worked for the federal government and given
his blunt-spoken, aggressive nature.
   ``I'm a pussycat,'' Sununu said. ``Let me tell you about
Washington. Certainly I have a lot to learn in regard to the
details. I think I'm a quick learner. I consider a great number of
congressmen to be close friends, both Democratic and Republican.''
   As to the criticism by Jewish leaders for refusing to endorse the
governors' proclamation on the U.N. resolution, Sununu, who is
partly of Arab descent, said:
   ``I'm very sensitive to that issue. The problem I had as a
governor is that I felt it was inappropriate. In terms of the issue,
I have no problem saying it should be repudiated.''
   Sununu, 49, had declined to run for a fourth term, citing a need
to return to ``the real world to get a real job.'' Sununu and his
wife, Nancy, have eight children. He is credited with helping revive
Bush's candidacy with a win in the New Hampshire primary last
February after the vice president finished a poor third in Iowa's
caucuses.

<DATELINE>SIDON, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Swiss representative of the International
Red Cross was kidnapped Thursday in Sidon, and police said his
captors might intend to swap him for an aircaft hijacker held in
Switzerland.
   The PLO blamed the abduction on emenies trying to discredit its
newly proclaimed state of Palestine. No organization claimed
responsibility.
   In Geneva, the International Committee of the Red Cross appealed
for the immediate release of Peter Winkler, 32, and said: ``The ICRC
cannot accomplish its mission unless it remains sheltered from all
forms of pressure, wherever their origin.''
   Spokesman Joerg Bischof said other representatives had been
kidnapped in Lebanon but were released after a few hours.
   Fourteen other foreigners, including nine Americans, are missing
in Lebanon, most believed to be in the hands of Shiite Moslem
extremists loyal to Iran. Held longest is Terry A. Anderson, chief
Middle East correspondent of The Associated Press, who was abducted
March 16, 1985.
   Police said Winkler was taken from his car at 8:45 a.m. in Hisbeh
Square in Sidon, provincial capital of south Lebanon. They mentioned
unconfirmed reports that Winkler, who had been in Lebanon only a
month, was taken to the Palestinian refugee camp Ein el-Hilweh.
   They also theorized the motive might be to trade Winkler, head of
the Red Cross office in Sidon, for Hussein Hariri, the Lebanese
Shiite Moslem hijacker held in Switzerland.
   Hariri, 22, commandeered an Air Afrique jetliner on a flight from
Rome to Paris and forced it to land in Geneva on July 24, 1987. He
killed a French passenger before the crew overpowered him.
   Hariri's relatives in Lebanon said at the time he belonged to the
Shiite fundamentalist Hezbollah, or Party of God. Hezbollah is
believed to be an umbrella group for most of the kidnappers holding
foreigners.
   PLO and local militia officials said radical Palestinians may
have kidnapped Winkler to pressure Switzerland not to recognize the
independent state proclaimed in the Israeli-occupied territories by
the Palestine National Council, which acts as the PLO legislature.
   Hard-line groups backed by Syria opposed the declaration because
it involved acceptance of U.N. resolutions that implicitly recognize
Israel.
   Six hours after the Thursday's kidnapping, Israeli warplanes made
mock attacks on Palestinian refugee camps on the southern fringe of
Sidon.
   Israeli jets have buzzed the Sidon camps daily since Yasser
Arafat, chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organization, announced
the new state Tuesday at a council meeting in Algiers.
   Police said an olive-colored car without license plates, carrying
three men, passed and stopped Winkler's car at a main traffic circle.
   Two gunmen pulled Winkler from the front passenger seat, keeping
their weapons pointed at his head. They pushed him into the back
seat of their car and the third assailant drove it away.
   Winkler did not resist and was not beaten, said a police
spokesman. Naji Assaad, Winkler's Lebanese driver, was left behind
and reported the abduction.
   ``Panicky onlookers made no move to help,'' the spokesman said.
``The kidnapping was carried out in less than one minute. There was
no shooting.''
   Assaad said none of the kidnappers was masked and the only one
wearing a beard was blond, with curly hair, dressed in dark blue
trousers and a black leather jacket.
   ``The bearded one shouted `Out, out quickly!' Mr. Winkler obeyed.
It was a very rapid operation,'' he said.
   Christophe Girod, chief International Red Cross representative in
South Lebanon, held a 45-minute meeting in Sidon with a
representative of Fatah-Revolutionary Council, the guerrilla group
headed by Palestinian terrorist Abu Nidal.
   ``We discussed the abduction. We hope he will released quickly,''
Girod said, but would not elaborate.
   Representatives of the International Red Cross are assigned
abroad to monitor compliance with the Geneva conventions and help
organize humanitarian relief. Swiss Ambassador Dino Sciolli said 30
work in Lebanon.
   A spokesman for the Popular Nasserite Organization militia in
Sidon, who would not let his name be used, said: ``It appears the
abduction has been carried out by radical Palestinians who regard
the declaration of the state of Palestine a capitulation, a
renunciation of the armed struggle against Israel.''
   The militia, a leftist Sunni Moslem group, has controlled Sidon
since the outbreak of Lebanon's sectarian civil war in 1975.
   Arafat's representative in Lebanon, Issam Salem, said: ``This is
an action against the recent declaration of the state of Palestine.''
   Winkler is the fifth foreigner working for a humanitarian
organization either kidnapped or missing in south Lebanon in nine
months.
   A Swede and a Norwegian working for the U.N. Relief and Works
Agency were kidnapped Feb. 5 and freed 25 days later. A British
charity worker seized March 3 was held six days and a Belgian
physician working for an aid committee disappeared May 21, but no
group has claimed to have kidnapped him.

   When it comes to guessing who's going to be in
the new Cabinet, the word from George Bush is not ``read my lips''
but ``stay tuned.'' He's also sworn his transition staff to secrecy,
but that hasn't put a dent in the production of the rumor mills.
   They keep pouring forth endless lists of Cabinet possibilities,
fed by what seems like every Republican politician in America, plus
assorted Democrats, bureaucrats, pundits, self-promoters and other
Washington idlers.
   George Bush's all-purpose answer to the speculation is ``stay
tuned.'' That's what he said Thursday morning, just a few hours
before he introduced New Hampshire Gov. John Sununu as White House
chief of staff and announced that campaign manager Lee Atwater was
his choice to become chairman of the Republican National Committee.
   Two Cabinet seats already have been taken (State and Treasury) by
James A. Baker III and Nicholas Brady, leaving the president-elect
with a dozen other department heads to name.
   Here is a look at some of the names that have bubbled to the
surface of these rumor rivulets. The departments are listed in order
of seniority after the oldest, State and Treasury.

   Frank Carlucci is the incumbent. Unlike some of his Cabinet
brethren, he has not been lobbying to stay on. Expressing an
eagerness to return to the private sector, he is likely to get his
wish.
   Former Texas Sen. John Tower is at the top of most lists of
possible defense secretaries, unless Bush opts for a corporate
chieftain to straighten out the Pentagon procurement mess. Then the
talk turns to folks such as Paul H. O'Neill, chairman of the
Aluminum Co. of America or former Defense Secretary Donald H.
Rumsfeld. Former Rep. Jack Edwards, R-Ala., is a dark horse, along
with retired Air Force Lt. Gen. Brent Scowcroft, national security
adviser during the Ford administration.

   Attorney General Dick Thornburgh was one of the late additions to
the Reagan Cabinet, spelling the embattled Edwin Meese III three
months ago, and the former Pennsylvania governor is eager to stay on.
   Bush insiders have sent mixed signals on Thornburgh's Cabinet
life expectancy. Last week they went out of their way to discourage
reports that he was a shoo-in.
   Some names tossed about as possible replacements are William D.
Ruckelshaus, a former deputy attorney general and Environmental
Protection Agency administrator, and Illinois Gov. James R.
Thompson.

   Secretary Don Hodel, one of the few Reagan Cabinet members to

   Sen. Dan Evans, R-Wash., who decided not to seek re-election, is
a favorite in the rumor mills for Interior.
   Other possibilities include Nat Reed, a former assistant Interior
secretary, and Rep. Manuel Lujan, R-N.M. New Mexico Gov. Garrey
Carruthers informed Bush's transition team he does not want to be
considered.

   Secretary Richard E. Lyng will be packing his bags after 2{ years.
   U.S. Trade Representative Clayton K. Yeutter is on everybody's
list, although he has talked about hankering for the private sector.
Yeutter, regarded as having done ably in his current job, is a
former Nebraska feedlot operator and head of the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange.
   Others with a shot include Rep. Tom Coleman, R-Mo., former Iowa
Rep. Cooper Evans and Seymour Johnson, a Mississippi soybean farmer.
Peter Myers, currently holding down the No. 2 job at Agriculture,
has been beating his own drum, but it's not known whether the sounds
have reached Bush's ears.

   Secretary C. William Verity Jr., a retired steel executive and
one of several short-timers in Reagan's Cabinet, has taken himself
out of the picture.
   Heading the pack for this post is Robert Mossbacher, Houston
businessman, GOP fund-raiser and longtime Bush chum. A couple of
Bush's erstwhile rivals for the Republican nomination, ex-Delaware
Gov. Pete du Pont and lame duck Rep. Jack Kemp of New York, are
possibilities. Another lame duck, baseball commissioner Peter
Ueberroth, has an outside chance, as does former Transportation
Secretary Elizabeth Dole.
</TEXT>
<BYLINE>LABOR</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Secretary Ann Dore McLaughlin campaigned hard for Bush but is
unlikely to retain the job she got just 11 months ago.
   Rep. Thomas J. Ridge, R-Pa., a moderate from a blue-collar
district in western Pennsylvania who has tried to forge GOP ties to
organized labor, is considered a strong possibility. He is credited
with helping Bush carry the Keystone state.
   Constance J. Horner, Reagan's Office of Personnel Management
director, also is said to covet the Labor seat, although shaky
relations with government workers' unions could undermine her
chances.
   Rep. Matthew Rinaldo, R-N.J., is also thought to have a chance.
   The longshots include William Kilbert, a Washington labor lawyer
and onetime general counsel to the Federal Mediation and
Conciliation Service, and former Rep. John Ehrlenborn, R-Ill.

   The man whose tip led to the arrest of a woman
suspected in the deaths of seven boardinghouse residents says he's
not really glad to have put someone in jail but feels ``like I'm a
good citizen.''
   Charles Willgues says he was befriended by the pleasant,
gray-haired woman whom he met in a bar, but he became suspicious
because of her interest in his disability checks and her suggestion
that they live together.
   Dorothea Montalvo Puente was arrested late Wednesday and was
being held by police in Sacramento for investigation of murdering
seven tenants found buried in shallow graves outside the Victorian
boardinghouse she ran there.
   Police believe Puente killed the tenants for their Social
Security checks.
   It was Willgues, 67, who lives alone in a downtown apartment here
and draws Social Security and other disability checks, who tipped a
CBS editor and then police Wednesday to Puente's whereabouts in a
motel near a bar where they had met earlier in the day.
   He didn't immediately recognize her when he talked with her in
the bar, but he realized later that he had seen her face from a
morning newscast on CBS.
   ``I'm not really happy about putting somebody in jail,'' Willgues
said in a telephone interview. ``I am happy in a way, though. I
believe in justice. I feel like I'm a good citizen.''
   He said Puente seemed pleasant when they met at the bar, an
out-of-towner in need of a friend. She told Willgues she was from
San Francisco and was looking for a place to repair her shoes.
   ``I took her shoes across the street to a shoe repair place. And
that's how the whole thing got started,'' Willgues said.
   She told him she was an only child, that her husband died a month
ago, and that the cab driver who took her to her motel stole her
luggage, Willgues said.
   ``She seemed nice and sincere,'' he said.
   But he said she had a strange interest in his disability checks.
And after only one meeting she started talking about living together.
   ``I didn't exactly agree to that. I said we should talk about it
tomorrow. We were going to go shopping,'' he said.
   When he got home, the woman's face wouldn't leave him. ``I said
to myself that I know this woman. I've seen her before,'' he said.
   Then he remembered and called the local CBS bureau, and with the
help of assignment editor Gene Silver, Willgues found out who his
mystery woman was.
   ``I wasn't just going for the scoop,'' Silver said later. ``This
woman could have been trying to prey on him. He was disabled and
drawing a pension. It became more than just a story. It became a
concern for somebody's life.''
   Silver went to Willgues' apartment and the two of them looked at
a newspaper photo of the woman and watched a newscast of the story
about the buried bodies. They decided to call police, said Silver.
   Another elderly man who knew Puentes said Wednesday that he may
have unwittingly helped dig the graves in the boardinghouse lawn.
   ``I was just doing favors for Dorothea. She was always asking us
to do things for her,'' said Homer Myers, 74. He said she told him
the holes were for a tree or for garbage.
   Myers said he lived at Montalvo's boardinghouse for two years,
but moved out last week after refusing to sign over his checks to
her.
   ``I feel real lucky just to be here talking,'' he said. ``I guess
I could have ended up in one of those holes I dug.''
   Myers said boardinghouse tenants seldom exchanged more than a few
words and assembled together only for meals twice a day. Sometimes
boarders disappeared, ``but folks were always coming and going,'' he
said. ``Nothing unusual about that.''

   The State Department on Thursday announced the
expulsion of an Iraqi diplomat in retaliation for the
``unjustified'' ouster of an American diplomat in Baghdad.
   But spokesman Charles E. Redman stressed the United States wanted
to improve relations with the Arab country. ``There are mutual
interests,'' he said.
   U.S. relations with Iraq were restored by President Reagan in
1984 after a 17-year break. Some analysts detected a trend toward
moderation in the ruling Baath party.
   The ousted American was identified Thursday in Baghdad as Heywood
Rankin, head of the U.S. Embassy's political section who has since
left the country. Diplomats in the Iraqi capital said he had made an
unauthorized trip to the north, home of Iraq's estimated 3.5 million
Kurds.
   But a U.S. official here, who spoke on condition of anonymity,
said the trip had been approved by the Iraqis.
   The State Department earlier this year criticized Iraq's
treatment of the non-Arab minority and accused Iraq of using
chemical weapons against Iran in the Persian Gulf war.
   Without identifying Rankin, Redman said ``none of his activities
have been incompatible in any way with his diplomatic status.'' He
declined to say whether the American had met with the Kurds.
   However, Redman said he did not know of any restrictions on U.S.
contacts. The spokesman called the expulsion ``a serious matter''
and said in retaliation Assistant Secretary of State Richard W.
Murphy had informed the Iraqi ambassador, Abdul-Amir Al-Anbari, that
an Iraqi diplomat assigned to the embassy in Washington had been
declared ``persona non grata.''
   ``This action was taken in response to the unjustified expulsion
of a U.S. diplomat in Baghdad by the Iraqi government,'' the
spokesman said.
   Redman declined to identify the Iraqi or his job. Efforts to
reach the embassy by telephone were unsuccessful.
   About 60,000 Kurds fled across the northern border to Turkey and
thousands of others went into Iran in August, claiming Iraq dropped
chemical bombs on their villages. The State Department said it had
substantiated the accusations.
   Militants among the 20 million Kurds living in a region extending
into Turkey, Iran and Iraq have fought for independence for the past
century.
   Iraq attacked Kurdish settlements on its northwestern border
shortly after accepting an Aug. 20 cease-fire in its eight-year war
with Iran. Kurdish guerrillas received support from Iran during the
war.
   Congress considered imposing economic sanctions against Iraq,
based on State Department reports it was using chemical weapons
against its Kurdish minority. Iraq denied the use, and the
legislation was dropped in the rush to adjourn Congress before the
November U.S. presidential election.

   Earth to aliens, Earth to aliens, are you
listening?
   OK, get this. You're welcome to visit New York, maybe check out a
basketball game or two, but make sure you bring plenty of cash
(there are some great real estate deals you wouldn't want to miss).
   That, in part, is what earthlings had to say to their
extraterrestrial neighbors Thursday when AT&T gave people an
opportunity to direct dial the rest of the universe.
   The company set up a camera and microphone outside its Manhattan
headquarters and began recording about 30 hours of videotaped
messages that will be beamed via satellite into outer space sometime
between Thanksgiving and New Year's. Passers-by were encouraged to
step up and sound off, so long as they weren't obscene.
   The idea was to let those aliens _ if they're out there, if
they're intelligent and if they get good TV reception _ know we're
here.
   The extraterrestrials might want to know, for instance, the news
that 13-year-old Moises Bermudez was anxious to communicate to the
void: ``I hope you saw the Knicks versus the Bullets. Because the
Knicks won.''
   Or this message from 24-year-old Tom Franz, a Madison Avenue real
estate agent: ``I have this great real estate investment here, but I
need $25,000. If you're interested, give me a call.''
   Alistair Levy, a 9-year-old visitor from London, was friendly:
``Life on earth is great here. I hope you have a nice time invading
us.''
   Kiernan Varas, 13, an eighth-grade classmate of Moises Bermudez
at Manhattan's Clinton School, was thoughtful: ``I hope the quest
for knowledge lasts forever.''
   And another classmate, 13-year-old Lisette Lazu, was poignant:
``Hello, my name is Lisette. I'm deaf but I would like to hear from
you.''
   The search for extraterrestrial life is nothing new, as AT&T
officials are quick to admit. Scientists have sent messages for
aliens into space before, and the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration funds a project, the Search for Extraterrestrial
Intelligence, that is devoted to hunting for signals from beyond.
   Furthermore, normal radio and television signals are escaping
into space all the time, setting out on theoretically infinite
voyages that could someday bring reruns of ``Mr. Ed'' into living
rooms in another galaxy.
   Given all that, what's the point of adding to the intergalactic
information glut?
   Former astronaut Michael Collins, now a private consultant who
was hired by AT&T to appear at the space message promotion, had an
answer.
   ``I think the fundamental problem of trying to communicate with
other parts of the universe is that the universe is just so large
and covers such a time span ... that any effort to send a message
out is worthwhile,'' he said. ``Any time you add to the sum total of
information going out, I think that's a worthwhile effort.''
   Is there intelligent life out there?
   ``I think the prospects are good,'' Collins said. ``I think if
you look out there and count the number of stars and then begin
making the most pessimistic assumptions, you still have to conclude
that there are trillions and trillions of stars as suitable as our
own for sustaining life. I think it's a form of cosmic conceit to
think that we're the only planet in the entire vast universe which
has been successful in that regard.''
   In other words, as 12-year-old Luis Maldonado said, there's ``a
pretty good chance. We can't tell if there is something else out
there and we can't tell if there's not.''

<HEAD>City's Christmas Decorations Tainted By Asbestos Dust</HEAD>
<DATELINE>McALESTER, Okla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It could be a dark Christmas this year
because the city's holiday decorations have been contaminated in
storage by asbestos dust.
   The pole decorations normally hung along Carl Albert Parkway were
stored in the old Navy Reserve center, which the city's parks
departments has used for storage.
   An inspection this year revealed old insulation was releasing
potentially hazardous asbestos particles into the air. Asbestos has
been identified as a potential cancer-causing substance when inhaled.
   The building was closed and crews were able to remove and clean
street signs in the building. But Mel Priddy, head of the Parks and
Recreation Department, said cleaning the lights would require more
labor than they are worth.
   ``The City Council offered to pay half of the $5,000 replacement
costs for new decorations, but no one has offered to match the
city's expense for the project,'' Priddy said.
   ``I would say right now, the city is looking toward next year,
not this one,'' he said, adding that even with the money, there
might not be time to buy decorations for this year.
   Richard Francis, McAlester Schools director of maintenance, is
licensed to handle asbestos, but he said the decorations may be a
lost cause.
   ``We had to have special permission from the Department of Labor
to remove the other items and they have said no more,'' he said.

column</NOTE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When Attorney General Edwin Meese III heard
that Donald Regan had abruptly resigned as President Reagan's chief
of staff, he put in a quick telephone call to Howard Baker.
   ``Howard, I think you better get over to the White House,'' he
told the former Tennessee senator who was in line to succeed Regan.
``There's no one in charge.''
   The story, told by former Baker aide Jim Cannon, speaks volumes
about the key role played in the modern White House by an official
unheard of a few decades ago.
   Attention is focused on the job again by President-elect George
Bush's announcement Thursday that he is naming outgoing New
Hampshire Gov. John Sununu to the post.
   ``The job of chief of staff requires the ability to lead, to
motivate, to direct an important organization in the best interests
of the country,'' Bush said in making the announcement.
   Sununu said, ``My principal responsibilities will be to make sure
that the new president gets the information and the tools that he
needs to make the policies that dicate the programs that will go
forth from the White House. I am also very aware that once those
policies are made I have a responsibility to try and get them
implemented as effectively as they can.''
   Sununu said the key to how he operates as chief of staff will be
``the way the vice president, once he becomes president, wants the
White House run.''
   In dealing with domestic policy issues, he said, ``I have two
responsibilities. One is to be an honest broker and present the
views on the various sides of the issue, and after I fulfill that,
then I have the opportunity to indicate my recommendations.''
   Sununu will be the second former governor to hold the position.
Baker was a former Senate majority leader. Regan was a former
treasury secretary.
   Yet the post of chief of staff is not even mentioned in the
Constitution, and no president had one until Dwight Eisenhower, the
former Army general, came to the White House growling, ``Do I have
to be my own sergeant major?''
   Most people would think that even without Donald Regan or Howard
Baker, or for that matter John Sununu, there is somebody in charge
at the White House: the president.
   ``Of course, he is in charge,'' said Cannon, who has observed the
process both as an adviser to Baker and as a senior aide to
President Ford.
   However, he added, ``Given the size and complexity of problems in
Washington now, you can't run a good administration without a
first-rate chief of staff.''
   Does this make the staff chief a glorified clerk, or possibly the
second most powerful official in the government? Depends on how you
look at it, but closer to the second than the first.
   ``Constitutionally he is and has to be the president's mere
dogsbody, to borrow a British term,'' presidential scholar Richard
E. Neustadt of Harvard University wrote in a 1986 study of the chief
of staff.
   The Oxford English Dictionary defines ``dogsbody'' as ``a junior
person, especially one to whom a variety of menial tasks is given.''
   Don't kid yourself. The White House chief of staff is nobody's
dogsbody.
   ``The chief of staff is system manager _ the boss of none but the
quarterback of everything,'' former White House aide Bradley H.
Patterson Jr. writes in a new book on the White House staff, ``The
Ring of Power.''
   ``He is anything but a pencil pusher,'' said Cannon.
   If there is a tornado in Oklahoma or a crisis in Afghanistan,
word of it comes to the chief of staff, who is on call at all hours
of the day or night.
   ``A chief of staff's power thus derives from his ability to
schedule the president's time, allocate access to him, and shape his
agenda,'' Samuel L. Popkin of the University of California at San
Diego wrote in the 1986 study.
   After Regan's abrupt resignation, said Cannon, ``it would have
been awkward if something very serious had happened somewhere in the
country or the world, and there was no chief of staff in the White
House.''
   The role of the chief of staff varies, however, from
administration to administration.
   Presidents Kennedy and Johnson chose not to have such
functionaries, although other aides filled much the same role. Nixon
returned to having a chief of staff and Ford followed suit. Carter
first favored a ``spokes of the wheel'' approach, in which various
assistants reported directly to him, but abandoned it and made
Hamilton Jordan chief of staff.
   Discussing Bush's staff chief, Cannon said, ``I think probably he
will have less power relatively than the present chief of staff
because Ronald Reagan's style was to turn over more decisions to the
chief of staff. ... My feeling is that Bush will have more decisions
in his own hands and less in the hands of the chief of staff.''
   And what of Craig Fuller, the former White House aide who headed
Bush's staff through most of his second term as vice president?
   He was in the running for White House chief of staff, but was
passed over and reportedly was being considered for a Cabinet post
instead.
   He declined the consolation prize before it was offered,
announcing Thursday that he would have been happy to be chief of
staff but now plans to return to private life.

<TEXT>
   The collapse of one of the world's
largest radiotelescopes will hinder astronomy over the long term and
will even hamper an experiment planned for an upcoming space shuttle
mission, experts say.
   The dish-shaped radiotelescope at the National Radio Astronomy
Observatory at Green Bank, which crashed Tuesday night, was as wide
as a football field is long but built on a shoestring budget 26
years ago. It was capable of listening to objects 10 billion light
years away.
   ``It's a major blow. There's no way to deny that,'' said George
Seielstad, NRAO's assistant director at the Green Bank operations.
   Seielstad said the telescope's loss will affect a long list of
research proposals, including a future space shuttle project.
   ``The Gamma Ray Observatory is scheduled to be launched by NASA
in 1990 from the space shuttle, and one of the things they will look
for will be pulse signals,'' he said. ``We were going to use this
telescope to monitor 100 of the brightest pulsars in conjunction
with the Gamma Ray observations.''
   He said no other telescope can take over such work.
   ``We're shocked,'' said Donald Backer, a University of
California-Berkeley astronomer who is doing pulsar research at a
sister observatory in Arecibo, Puerto Rico. ``We'll miss it.
   ``I'm sure a lot of operators of big dishes elsewhere across the
world are going to go out next week or tomorrow morning and check
what they never checked before.''
   Backer, who used Green Bank's 300-foot radiotelescope last year
to search for pulsars, said it long ago exceeded its expected
lifespan. It was built for $850,000 in 1962.
   Engineers from the National Science Foundation, which funds Green
Bank for a consortium of nine universities, flew to the site
Wednesday in an attempt to discover what caused the dish to topple.
   Seielstad said the telescope's 600 tons of metal dropped to the
ground without warning Tuesday night. The twin steel towers upon
which the structure moved were twisted and snapped. White aluminum
mesh panels that once made up the dish blanketed the rubble like an
umbrella pushed inside-out.
   ``It looks so much like someone lifted a big bowl into the air
and let it drop,'' Seielstad said.
   The unidentified employee operating the radiotelescope said there
was no warning, Seielstad said.
   Workers said the structure routinely snapped and popped,
especially as it cooled at night, but that it had survived heavy
snows, thunderstorms and 75 mph winds. Weather was calm Tuesday
night when the scope tumbled to the ground, workers said.
   The radiotelescope was capable of intercepting naturally emitted
radio signals from celestial bodies billions of light years away.
   Its most celebrated contribution to science came in 1968, when
astronomers used it to discover a pulsar at the center of the Crab
Nebula. The find helped prove that pulsars are the dense remains of
supernovae, or exploded stars.
   The observatory, which opened in 1959, has eight smaller
telescopes, the smallest 40 feet in diameter. Green Bank is located
in the Monongahela National Forest about 10 miles from the Virginia
border.

<HEAD>Panel Says Reducing Demand Key To Curbing Drug Flows</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE GEDDA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A panel of leading Mexicans and Americans
recommended Thursday that the United States give top priority to
curbing U.S. demand for drugs as part of a more balanced policy in
dealing with that problem.
   The recommendation was contained in a lengthy study by the
Bilateral Commission on the Future of United States-Mexican
Relations on five areas of concern between the two countries.
   The commission was co-chaired by William D. Rogers, who held two
senior State Department posts during the Ford administration, and
Hugo B. Margain, a member of the Mexican Senate who is a former
ambassador to the United States.
   The 238-page study said the United States has placed excessive
emphasis on law enforcement to curb drug smuggling and that recent
increases in funding levels to reduce demand for drugs will prove
inadequate.
   ``The commission urges the U.S. to give top priority to learning
how to reduce demand and to allocate sufficient resources to move
rapidly in attacking this critical problem,'' the report said.
   ``A balanced strategy must also include a vigorous international
effort, in which drug control concerns are given high diplomatic
priority,'' it said.
   It suggested that the U.S. government subordinated the drug issue
in its relations with Panama and Honduras because priority was given
to security concerns.
   ``Such obviously selective application of its international
narcotics control policy undermines U.S. credibility with other
countries and with the multilateral institutions pledged to combat
drug abuse,'' the report said.
   Release of the report was timed to coincide with the advent of
new administrations in both Mexico and the United States. Mexican
President-elect Carlos Salinas de Gortari will be inaugurated on
Dec. 1, seven weeks before his U.S. counterpart, George Bush.
   Rogers told a news conference that Mexico ``stands second only to
the Soviet Union in its significance to the U.S.'' Copies of the
report were delivered to Secretary of State George P. Shultz and
national security adviser Colin Powell.
   The report also covered such issues as economics, migration,
foreign policy and education. Following are excerpts:
   Debt _ ``For Mexico ... debt service obligations in the future
should be designed subject to (its) capacity to pay under conditions
of growth. Without growth, adjustment will not be sustained; without
growth, resources for debt service will not be available.''
   Trade _ ``Both countries should continue to agree to generalized
trade concessions. They should move promptly to free-trade
agreements in all sectors where benefits from free trade may exist,
especially industrial sectors.''
   Migration _ ``Both governments ... should undertake to reach a
bilateral accord on migration, which should consider: a possible
increase in the legal quotas of Mexican migration to the U.S., an
agreement on the flow and treatment of `seasonal agricultural
workers,' the protection of migrants' human and labor rights and the
possibility of a long-run temporary worker program.''
   Foreign Policy _ ``A first step is to initiate a frank and open
dialogue on the concept of regional security. The commission
believes that regional security involves not only military-strategic
concerns but must also encompass questions of socio-economic
development.''
   Other commission members included former World Bank President
Robert McNamara, San Antonio Mayor Henry Cisneros, and Colegio de
Mexico President Mario Ojeda.

<HEAD>Federal Aid to Local, State Governments Lowest Since 1966</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   State and local government reliance on federal
aid last year sank to its lowest level in more than 20 years, the
Census Bureau said Thursday.
   From a high of 18.7 cents per dollar of state and local
government revenue in 1978, the federal contribution withered to
13.6 cents in 1987. It was the lowest since 1966, when Lyndon
Johnson was gearing up the Great Society programs and the federal
contribution was 13.5 cents per dollar.
   Total federal aid actually has risen throughout the period _ from
$70 billion in 1978, to $113 billion in 1986 to $115 billion in
1987. But it is increasing at a slower rate than other state and
local government revenues.
   While the federal contribution grew at an average of 5.7 percent
a year from 1978 to 1987, the amount raised by state and local taxes
grew an average of 8.5 percent a year.
   Last year, state and local taxes grew 8.6 percent to $405.1
billion, while federal aid increased only 1.7 percent. Revenue from
all sources totaled $842.6 billion.
   Henry Wulf, a Census Bureau analyst, said the federal share
likely will slip again in future years because state and local
governments will be increasing spending to upgrade
``infrastructure'' items such as sewers and roads.
   Randolph Arndt, a spokesman for the National League of Cities,
said the trend is disturbing because the bulk of state and local
taxes, based either on sales or real estate, are more regressive
than the federal sliding scale for income taxes.
   Also, he said, ``The significance of these reductions goes beyond
the numbers in that the results have been felt most severely in
those communities where needs are already the greatest.''
   ``The fact is when a region is distressed, whether it is the Oil
Patch now or the Great Lakes Rust Belt earlier in the decade, it has
much less capacity to generate revenues,'' he said.
   Arndt said federal assistance began declining in the Carter
administration as part of an effort to fight inflation. It continued
to decline in administration of President Reagan, first as part of
Reagan's ``new federalism'' shifting many government functions to
the local level and second as part of the effort to reduce the
federal budget deficit.
   According to the Census Bureau, state and local government
spending grew 8.1 percent last year to $775.3 billion, up $57.9
billion, compared with a 9.1 percent rise a year earlier. Average
growth in spending since 1978 has been 11 percent.
   Topping the spending list were education, $227 billion (29.3
cents per dollar spent); public welfare, $83 billion (10.7 cents);
publicly owned utilities, $66 billion (8.5 cents); and highways, $52
billion (6.7 cents).
   Salaries and wages accounted for 35.4 percent of state and local
government spending, but increased at a slightly slower rate, 6.9
percent, than overall spending.
   Outstanding state debt also increased, up 9.1 percent to $718.7
billion.

<HEAD>Nearly $2 Million Paid For Kafka's `Trial'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GRAHAM HEATHCOTE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The handwritten manuscript of Franz Kafka's ``The
Trial,'' which was smuggled to safety during World War II despite
the author's dying wish that it be burned, sold for a record $1.98
million Thursday.
   The 316-page text of the novel, which came to symbolize
20th-century totalitarianism, was bought at auction by the German
state government of Baden-Wuerttemberg for 1.1 million pounds.
   Kafka, a Czechoslovak Jew, completed the novel in 1920 and it was
published in 1925, a year after he died from tuberculosis at age 41.
The novel's hero, Joseph K., who has done nothing wrong, is
arrested, tried and executed without ever being told of what he is
accused.
   The novel's terrifying account of K.'s entrapment in judicial
bureaucracy gave the word ``Kafkaesque'' to the language.
   Kafka gave his manuscripts in 1924 to Max Brod, who ignored the
writer's orders to burn them and fled with the works to Palestine
the night the German army entered Prague in 1938. Brod, Kafka's
literary executor, died in 1968.
   A spokesman for the state government in Stuttgart said the
manuscript would probably go to the German Literature Archives in
Marbach.
   ``We want it in Germany because Kafka wrote it in German, and
because it is the most important novel of our century,'' said the
successful bidder, antiquarian bookseller Heribert Tenschert from
Rotthalmunster, near Munich.
   ``I would have bought it for myself and paid double what I did,
but our authorities contacted me to buy it. I would have gone to 2
or 3 million pounds,'' Tenschert told reporters outside Sotheby's
saleroom.
   The 40-year-old bookseller, a previous buyer of medieval
manuscripts in London, added: ``It is definitely a very good deal, a
bargain. For such a work, one has to be prepared to pay.
   ``I hope there will be a lot of happiness in Germany about this
purchase, especially at this price.''
   The seller was not identified.
   Brod left his papers to his secretary and companion, Ester Hoffe.
When Tenschert was asked if Ms. Hoffe was the seller, he hesitated
and then said he couldn't discuss that.
   Auctioneer Roy Davids started the bidding at 400,000 pounds, or
$720,000, and ended it one minute later, with Tenschert and another
person bidding in $90,000 increments.
   Asked if he knew who the other bidder was, Tenschert said: ``I
wasn't interested in underbidders _ I was determined to get it. I
knew I would get it.''
   The final bid was exactly 1 million pounds, but the auctioneers
add a 10 percent commission.
   The price was an auction record for any modern literary
transcript. Auctioneers define ``modern'' as anything written since
the Middle Ages, a historians' loose term for the 5th to 15th
centuries.
   The price eclipsed the $605,000 paid in New York last year for
Kafka's letters to his fiancee, Felice Bauer, and the previous
record for a purely literary work, the 275,000 pounds, about
$370,000, paid in July 1985 for a notebook of poetry and prose by
Irish writer William Butler Yeats.
   ``What makes `The Trial' even more valuable is that Brod left his
own manuscripts in Prague to put Kafka's in his suitcase,''
Tenschert said.
   Tenschert said he will pay for the manuscript when he returns to
London on Dec. 6, the two-week delay needed for British authorities
to issue an export license.
   ``Poor old Kafka, he died broke,'' commented a reporter.
   ``Yes,'' said Tenschert, ``and my wife said if I bought `The
Trial' I should burn it because Kafka wanted that.
   ``Well, if it was my money buying it I would consider that, but I
can't because someone else is paying.''

<HEAD>Experiments, Envelopes Carried On Small Research Rocket</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A 30-pound package carrying four
experiments and 52 envelopes rocketed 14,000 feet high and was
recovered despite parachute failure Thursday in what was touted as
the first private commercial space flight.
   A 10-foot rocket not much bigger than those launched by weekend
hobbyists burned for 4.4 seconds as it propelled the payload over a
five-minute course, dropping it into the Atlantic Ocean two miles
offshore.
   Officials of E'Prime Aerospace Co. reported the main parachute
did not open but that a smaller pilot chute did work and was
sufficient to land the payload safely. Divers recovered it in good
condition.
   Jim Mizell, E'Prime operations director, said a flight monitoring
experiment to measure acceleration and temperatures failed to
operate during the flight but that the other experiments went well.
He reported slight water seepage into the payload section.
   Ken Havekotte, a space stamp enthusiast, said some of the
envelopes, bearing covers commemorating the flight, got damp, but
they were dried out and most were mailed to collectors.
   E'Prime, of nearby Titusville, hopes the success will lead to
investor interest in the company so it eventually can buy bigger
rockets capable to orbiting commercial space payloads. Stockholders
and potential investors were among the 200 people who watched the
liftoff from the beach, half a mile from the launch pad.
   In trying to attract investors, E'Prime billed the flight as the
``first truly commercial space flight.'' But by the company's own
definition, space starts 75 miles up. And NASA has launched several
commercial payloads for paying customers over the years.
   However, it was the first time a privately owned rocket had been
launched from either Air Force or NASA facilities here.
   The company paid the Air Force $24,000 for use of of an old
weather rocket launch pad and some support services. It also had to
buy $1 million in liability insurance to cover any damage to Air
Force property.
   Mizell, a former NASA engineer, said the experiments on board the
rocket were from paying customers. He declined to say how much they
had paid except that it was not enough to make the flight
profitable. A high school teacher whose class developed one of the
experiments said they paid $5.
   He estimated the total the fledgling company has spent so far at
$200,000.
   The so-called ``commercialization of space,'' to bring the
private sector into the launching of satellites and other space
activity, has been a major goal of the Reagan administration.
   Mizell said his company has a long way to go before it can become
a viable provider of commercial launch services for space payloads.
He noted that Thursday's flight had been delayed a year while the
company met the government's financial, safety and techncial
requirements.
   He said E'Prime hopes to launch a second rocket of the same size
early next year.
   The flight Thursday was called LOFT-1, for Launch Operations
Flight Test. The rocket carried a biology experiment from a
Huntsville, Ala., high school; a thin-film polymer experiment from
Morton Thiokol Inc. and Utah State University; the flight monitoring
system for measuring acceleration and temperature from QSI Corp. and
Weber State College in Utah; and a data collection and telemetry
system from the University of Alabama at Huntsville.
   Jayne Russell, a teacher at J.O. Johnson High School in
Huntsville, said the biology experiment involved sending plant seeds
into space. They will be planted and their growth rates compared
with those of other seeds.

their first 28 cases and plan to send at least 15 of the prisoners
back to their native Cuba ``in the near future,'' officials said
Thursday.
   The announcement aroused the anger of many in the Cuban community
in Miami, and attorneys representing the prisoners flew to Alabama
seeking to halt the repatriation process.
   The 15 Cuban detainees are being held in a strict ``lockdown'' in
a penitentiary in Talladega, Ala. No detainee will be scheduled for
return to Cuba earlier than 72 hours after the government officially
notifies each of the 15 detainees, the Justice Department said.
   The 15 the department said should be repatriated have convictions
ranging from petty larceny to second-degree murder. Most of them
have more than one conviction.
   The three-member panels will undertake further consideration of
the remaining 13 detainees in the initial review group to determine
whether they should also be returned to Cuba or be released.
   The panels were set up at the Justice Department in the wake of
last year's prison riots by Cuban detainees at Atlanta and Oakdale,
La. The rioting occurred after a U.S. agreement with Cuban President
Fidel Castro to resume sending many of the detainees back to the
island. Deportations of Mariel detainees from the United States to
Cuba were suspended by Castro in May 1985.
   The detainees are among 125,000 people who came to the United
States in 1980 in a boatlift from Mariel, Cuba, and the vast
majority of them have become law-abiding U.S. residents.
   ``The reviews conducted by these panels go beyond anything that's
required by law or by court order,'' Cary Copeland, a deputy
associate attorney general, told a news conference. ``They're
designed to give the detainee and his representative every
opportunity to tell the panels anything they feel appropriate in
reaching their decisions.''
   Two attorneys went to Birmingham, Ala., to challenge the Justice
Department's action in federal court.
   One of the attorneys, Leo Ochoa, said the expulsions violate the
basic U.S. guarantee of due process under the law.
   In many cases, Ochoa said, the prisoners were not permitted to
meet with their attorneys to submit documents for the administrative
appeals the government agreed to after last November's riots.
   ``We're saying that many of these people are rehabilitated, many
of these people are not dangerous,'' Ochoa said. ``But they're going
to be deported nevertheless because they couldn't `meet their burden
of proof.'''
   Copeland said ``right now, I think we've got about 500'' Mariel
detainees who will undergo Justice Department reviews to determine
whether they would be repatriated to Cuba. Copeland said there are
``another several hundred'' serving sentences in state and local
jails who eventually will receive repatriation reviews.
   According to information released by the Justice Department, most
of the 15 detainees have various relatives living in the United
States, but only a few have wives.
   George Calhoun, the Justice Department official overseeing the
Mariel Cuban review process, said the panels ``decided that on
balance ... they could not subject the society to the greater harm''
of releasing the detainee.
   ``I think it is ironic that the U.S. government ... chooses to
continue on the unfortunate path of deporting people to a country
that our own U.N. ambassador has characterized as `one of the
world's darkest dungeons,''' said Gary Leshaw, director of the
non-profit Atlanta legal aid organization representing Mariel
detainees.
   Separate Justice Department parole review panels were also
established in the wake of last year's riots and those panels have
reviewed 11 cases to date, Calhoun and Copeland said. The panels
determined that six detainees should remain in the custody of the
Immigration and Naturalization Service. The other five will receive
further review to determine if they are suitable for parole.
   The Justice Department reviews are in addition to reviews
conducted by the Immigration and Naturalization Service.
   Since June 1987, the INS has approved more than 2,400 Cuban
detainees for parole. Another 400 detainees have been recommended
for release.

<HEAD>Union of Concerned Scientists Criticize Stealth Bomber</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TIM AHERN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The new Stealth bomber is unlikely to be able
to carry out its wartime job of destroying mobile Soviet
nuclear-tipped missiles, according to a report issued Thursday.
   The Soviets probably will be able to counter the bomber, meaning
``prospects for success in holding a significant fraction of Soviet
mobile targets at risk are very poor,'' said the report by the Union
of Concerned Scientists.
   The 19-year-old private organization has been critical of other
Reagan administration national security policies, particularly
President Reagan's Star Wars anti-missile research program.
   The report was issued less than a week before the Air Force
publicly unveils the bomber for the first time. The plane, known as
the B-2, uses composite materials and an unusual ``flying wing''
shape to hide it from Soviet radars.
   The Air Force is planning to buy 132 B-2s at a cost of $68.8
billion, making it one of the most expensive weapons ever built.
   The Stealth would be one of the components _ along with the new
B-1 and older B-52 _ of the bomber leg of America's three-pronged
nuclear force. Other components of that deterrent are land-based and
submarine-based nuclear missiles.
   According to the Union of Concerned Scientists' study, the main
mission of the Stealth bomber would be to ``hunt down and destroy
Soviet mobile nuclear targets during a protracted nuclear conflict.''
   But that could cause arms control problems, the study noted. With
both nations aiming to cut their arsenals of long-range atomic
weapons by 50 percent through START negotiations under way in
Geneva, ``the survivability of their remaining forces will be
critical to stability,'' it said.
   ``For the land-based forces of both superpowers, mobility will be
a key means of satisfying this requirement,'' the report said. ``The
B-2 bomber is thus out of phase with the trend of arms control.''
   ``At a time when the United States should be tailoring its
procurement of strategic forces to the post-START world _ and to the
realities of a constant or declining defenses budget _ the B-2 is a
step in the wrong direction,'' the report noted.
   But Capt. Jay DeFrank, an Air Force spokesman, said, ``The B-2
may be at the heart of solving the mobile ICBM (intercontinental
ballistic missile) problem, but the mobile missile issue is not the
heart of the B-2 requirement.''
   ``The B-2's primary mission is deterrence across the spectrum of
conflict,'' DeFrank said. ``The B-2 will have the capability to
penetrate the most sophisticated enemy defenses and threaten their
most valued targets whatever they may be.''
   But there are other problems, the study said. For example, the
B-2 would be vulnerable to future Soviet defenses, such as
space-based radar systems that could ``look down'' and spot the
plane.
   In addition, the aerial refueling planes and necessary airfields
needed to support B-2 flights wouldn't survive a prolonged nuclear
war, the study contended.

   Jason Epstein, the editorial director at Random
House, was named the winner Thursday of the National Book Awards
Medal, a new honor ``for distinguished contribution to American
letters.''
   Epstein has been an editor at Random House for 30 years, working
with such authors as W.H Auden, Vladimir Nabokov, Norman Mailer,
Gore Vidal and E.L. Doctorow.
   The award was conceived to honor ``someone long connected with
books who has had an extraordinary and permanent impact on American
letters,'' said Roger Stevens, chairman of the board of the National
Book Awards Inc.
   Epstein, 60, founded Anchor Books, the first American quality
paperback line, when he was a 24-year-old editor at Doubleday.
During a 1963 newspaper strike, he founded the New York Review of
Books, which now has a circulation of 150,000.
   In 1982, he started The Library of America _ a series of uniform
editions of books by America's greatest writers.
   Epstein was chosen by the board of directors of the National Book
Awards Inc. The award, which carries a $10,000 cash prize, will be
presented at the Nov. 29 National Book Awards dinner, when winners
of the fiction and non-fiction awards will be announced.

<HEAD>Farmers Could Live With Budget Freeze, Farm Bureau Chief Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE ROBINSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Farmers could live with a spending freeze
designed to erase red budget ink without new taxes if they were not
singled out for sacrifice, the leader of the nation's largest farm
group said Thursday.
   ``I'm not talking about eliminating federal programs or cutting
current outlays,'' Dean Kleckner, president of the American Farm
Bureau Federation, told a news conference.
   ``I'm only suggesting a moratorium on spending increases,''
Kleckner said. ``Stop the increases, just the increases, and the
budget would balance itself.''
   Kleckner, an Iowa hog, corn and soybean producer, is a member of
the National Economic Commission, which is seeking ways to reduce
the deficit. He has been mentioned as a possible Bush selection for
secretary of agriculture.
   Kleckner said even a partial freeze with $30 billion to $40
billion in new spending could reduce the deficit quickly because of
projected increases in revenue over the next five years of $80
billion to $90 billion annually.
   Bush has urged a ``flexible freeze'' to reduce the deficit while
vowing not to attempt to balance the budget with a tax increase.
   It remains unclear how a flexible freeze might effect politically
popular farm payments programs, which totaled $17.5 billion last
year.
   Rebellion would not erupt in the Farm Belt over a freeze provided
the agricultural sector did not come in for disproportionate cuts,
Kleckner said.
   ``I'm convinced that farmers won't object to a freeze ... as long
as they understand that they are not alone,'' he said.
   But claimed that the idea behind the National Economic Commission
was to recommend a politically unpalatable tax increase and in so
doing allow politicians to shift the blame from their own shoulders.
   ``Let's be honest,'' Kleckner said. ``The commission was created
to provide cover for a tax increase.''
   Kleckner said there has been a campaign in the news media and
elsewhere to convince voters that there is no alternative to a tax
increase.
   ``The common conventional Washington wisdom is that unless you
people know that we need a tax increase to balance the budget you
have your head in the sand and you're from Sticksville,'' Kleckner
said.
   He said the Bush victory was evidence that the bulk of American
voters take exactly the opposite view of a tax hike.
   ``I will make the case that the election was a referendum on that
issue because the other issues weren't that clear,'' he said.

<HEAD>FCC Authorizes Construction, Launch of Satellites</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Federal Communications Commission on
Thursday authorized construction of 13 domestic communications
satellites and the launch of nine. It also authorized construction
and launch of 10 replacement satellites.
   The action brings to 42 the number of authorized domestic
satellites providing a variety of telecommunications services,
including video and data services.
   The FCC said the newly authorized satellites, set to be launched
through 1994, will provide domestic satellite capacity through the
end of the century.
   The last group of satellites was authorized in 1985. Of the 20
spacecraft in the group, only four are being constructed. The
remaining 16 were casualties for various reasons, notably a slump in
the satellite industry following the explosion of the space shuttle
Challenger in January 1986, which grounded the U.S. space program
and severely limited commercial satellite launch options, said Fern
Jarmulnek, an FCC satellite official.
   The commission said it granted all of the applications it
received for the orbital slots 22,300 miles above the equator. The
authorizations leave nine slots unassigned, Jarmulnek said.
   In making assignments, the FCC also changed the position of
certain slots in the orbit as required by a recent agreement with
Canada and Mexico expanding the orbital space assigned to those two
countries. In reassigning U.S. satellites, however, the United
States retains the same number of orbital slots for its satellites.
   As a result of the agreement, three U.S. satellites that are in
orbit will have to relocate. This will be accomplished by firing
small thruster rockets on the satellites that are used to fine-tune
the spacecraft's position in orbit.

<HEAD>Reagan Signs Bills Preventing Dams on Idaho Rivers, Georgia Lake</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Reagan signed legislation Thursday
prohibiting the construction of hydroelectric dams on stretches of
the Snake and Salmon Rivers in Idaho.
   The measure also was designed to prohibit the Federal Energy
Regulatory Commission from granting a license for a hydroelectric
facility on Lake Tobesofkee in Georgia without approval of the
governing body of Bibb County.
   The president said part of the bill was unconstitutional because
it would have given local authorities power to perform ``significant
authority'' pursuant to federal laws. As a result, he said, he was
signing the bill with the understanding that it simply forbids the
licensing of hydroelectric dams on the lake.
   Sponsors of the bill said it was designed to prevent interference
with the use of the manmade lake, which has 345 private homes and a
number of county beaches on its shores and to avoid interference
with county revenues.
   In Idaho, the bill will affect 33 miles of the Snake River north
of Hells Canyon and 112 miles of the Salmon River upstream from its
confluence with the Snake.
   Some stretches of the two rivers already are protected from
dam-building because they are part of the Wild and Scenic Rivers
System, and sponsors of the bill sought to extend this protection to
the additional stretches even though they had not been designated
part of the system.

   Israeli soldiers wounded at least 27
Palestinians during street battles in the occupied lands Thursday,
including a 9-year-old boy and 14-year-old girl who were in critical
condition, hospital officials reported.
   The army eased curfews and other restrictions imposed in an
effort to curtail violence and celebration connected with Tuesday's
proclamation by the PLO of an independent Palestinian state.
   More than 7,000 Palestinians have been wounded since the uprising
against Israeli occupation began nearly a year ago in the West Bank
and Gaza Strip, which Israel captured from Jordan and Egypt in 1967.
Eleven Israelis and at least 313 Palestinians have been killed.
   Hospital officials reported at least four people seriously
wounded in confrontations in Tamoun, a West Bank village, and
several areas of Gaza, including the Shati and Deir al-Balagh
refugee camps.
   The wounded included the 9-year-old from the Shati camp, who was
shot in the head, and a 14-year-old girl from Tamoun, who was hit in
the spinal cord by a bullet, the Palestinian doctors said.
   In Arab east Jerusalem, a bomb exploded Thursday as a police
vehicle passed nearby, Israel television said. No injuries were
reported.
   The attack followed a day of scattered clashes in Jerusalem,
which Israel considers its capital. Three policemen were injured by
rocks, and at least ten Palestinians were detained.
   Islamic extremists circulated a new leaflet Thursday urging
residents of the territories to reject the declaration of an
independent state by the Palestine National Council, which acts as
the legislature of the Palestine Liberation Organization.
   A fundamentalist group named Hamas (Zeal) called for a three-day
strike beginning Friday to protest the declaration, which includes
acceptance of U.N. resolutions that implicitly recognize Israel.
   ``Palestine extends from the Jordan River to the (Mediterranean)
sea,'' it said. ``This independence is imaginary and does not exist
in the world of reality.''
   ``The PNC's acceptance of (U.N. resolutions) 242 and 338 means
putting the armed struggle aside and giving Israel the right to
Palestine,'' it said.
   An army spokesman said troops raided Tamoun village, 15 miles
northeast of Nablus, and soldiers opened fire on young Palestinians
who hurled rocks.
   Officials at Al Ittihad Hospital in Nablus said 13 Palestinians
were wounded, three seriously. The army confirmed four wounded and
said it was checking the other reports.
   Residents said health officials had announced they would give
polio vaccinations Thursday and many of the 50 people wanted by the
Israeli authorities returned to Tamoun from hideouts in the area.
   Soldiers arrived in nine vehicles and ordered the health
officials to leave, the residents said.
   They reported three hours of street battles in the hilltop
village, which was decorated with five outlawed Palestinian flags
and pictures of PLO chairman Yasser Arafat.
   Windows in five houses were smashed. Izat Bisharat, 38, showed a
reporter his damaged car, which he said soldiers commandeered to
chase stone-throwers.
   ``It was like a war,'' said Feisal Jaballah, 20. ``Every time
somebody got wounded, people escalated their resistance.''
   Slogans painted on the walls reflected the rift in Palestinian
ranks.
   ``No to 181 partition plan. Don't accept council that accepts
compromises,'' said one signed by the pro-Syrian Salvation Front.
Another painted by the pro-Iraq Arab Liberation Front said: ``Syria
has no right to interfere in our affairs.''
   Syria opposes Arafat's leadership of the PLO and the independence
declaration, and supported Iran in its war with Iraq.
   The ``181 partition plan'' refers to U.N. General Assembly
Resolution 181 of 1947, which called for both Jewish and Arab states
in what then was Palestine.
   During the uprising, Israeli soldiers have carried out several
raids in the West Bank to make Palestinians obliterate anti-Israeli
slogans and take down the black, green and red Palestinian flags.
   In the occupied Gaza Strip, the army lifted a 6-day-old curfew in
most towns and cities but kept it in place for the 250,000
Palestinians in the coastal territory's eight refugee camps. A
curfew also was kept on the Nur Shams refugee camp near Tulkarem in
the West Bank.
   Troops confronted Palestinian rioters in the Gaza towns of Rafah,
Khan Yunis and Gaza City and two refugee camps, wounding 14
Palestinians, hospital officials said. The army said it was checking
the reports.
   Telephone lines remained cut to homes and businesses for a
seventh day in the West Bank cities of Hebron, Nablus, Ramallah and
Jenin. Service was halted to prevent Palestinians from coordinating
anti-Israeli activities during the Palestine National Council
meeting in Algiers.

   Stung by an earlier failure to cope with the
threat of tiny parasitic honey bee mites, the Agriculture Department
said Thursday it plans to hold a special buzz session to design a
more effective plan.
   An advisory committee will try in two weeks to draft new federal
regulations for preventing further spread of the destructive mites,
which have been reported in 18 states.
   Beekeeping is credited by USDA with the pollination of many
agricultural crops having an estimated annual value of around $20
billion. Those include many fruits, vegetables and hay crops.
   James W. Glosser, administrator of the department's Animal and
Plant Health Inspection Service, said the 15-member panel will
include representatives of state departments of agriculture,
beekeeping organizations and related groups.
   The committee's first meeting will be held in Washington Nov. 30
through Dec. 2, he said.
   Although not known to be harmful to other creatures, the mites _
Varroa Jacobsoni _ were first discovered in the United States in
September 1987 in a Wisconsin apiary.
   The USDA agency imposed a federal quarantine last April to
restrict movement of bees and bee equipment from infested states but
canceled it a month later ``when the regulations proved too complex
to administer successfully.''
   Glosser said the committee will employ ``negotiated rulemaking''
to form federal regulations acceptable to the various parts of the
bee industry.
   The Varroa mite is an external parasite of adult bees and their
developing larvae, or brood. Department experts have described the
female as about one-twentieth of an inch in diameter, with the male
somewhat smaller.
   Infestations can cause decreased brood numbers, deformed bees and
weakening of the colony's ability to pollinate plants and produce
honey. The mites can infest a colony so gradually that it may be
unnoticed until serious damage has occurred.
   Besides Wisconsin, state where the mites have been found are:
Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Maine, Massachusetts, Michigan,
Minnesota, Mississippi, Nebraska, New York, North Dakota, Ohio,
Pennsylvania, South Carolina, South Dakota and Washington.
   Glosser said the public can submit written statements at the
meeting or send them in advance to: Helene Wright, APHIS, USDA, Room
1143-S, P.O. Box 96464, Washington, D.C. 20090-6464.

   A 9-year-old girl who moved into an
adults-only condominium complex after her mother died of cancer now
lives under the threat of eviction.
   Jamie Swartz moved in with her father, Lynn Swartz, and
stepmother, Jill, last spring after her mother began chemotherapy
treatment. Her mother died in September, and Friday Jill Swartz
received a letter saying the Viewpoint Condominium association would
seek a court order to remove Jamie from the complex in this town
north of Miami.
   ``I felt like, `My God, they really hate children, they really
hate children,''' said Jill Swartz, who added the turmoil could be
tough on the youngster. ``With the trauma of having already lost her
mother, she doesn't need this.''
   The association this week gave the family a one-month reprieve.
Jill Swartz asked the condo board Wednesday to allow Jamie to remain
with the Swartzes until they sell the condominium, and association
attorney Douglas Neway said the board would consider the request.
   ``No litigation is going to be instituted at this point,'' said
Neway.
   ``I'm grateful. I regret that it took this for them to be
considerate of our feelings and our circumstances,'' Mrs. Swartz
said.
   The couple said they notified the association last spring that
Jamie would stay with them periodically while her mother, Maye
Swartz, was hospitalized. They also promised to find a new place to
live if the problem became long-term.
   The board agreed to suspend its rule for three months, but last
Friday threatened the family with the court order.
   Neway said board members were unaware of Maye Swartz's death when
they asked him to notify the family of the possibility of a court
order.

   A man accused of stealing hundreds of
thousands of dollars from telephone coin boxes across the nation
pleaded guilty Thursday to theft and tampering charges, a court
official reported.
   James Clark, 48, dubbed the ``Coin Box Bandit'' by a phone
company, was sentenced by Judge James Murphy to three years in
prison on his guilty pleas to five counts each of grand theft and
tampering with coin machines, said Robert Coombs, a clerk in the
Summit County Common Pleas Court.
   Ohio Bell officials said Clark, formerly of Boston Heights, near
Akron, took between $300,000 and $600,000 from pay telephones in 32
states from Florida to California before he was arrested by FBI
agents in a Los Angeles suburb.
   The charges Clark pleaded guilty to involved $500 in coins from
five phones in Summit County, local officials said.

   Tornadoes and waterspouts roared through
three eastern counties Thursday, ripping roofs off houses,
destroying some mobile homes and slightly injuring one person,
authorities said.
   Twisters were spotted in Currituck, Tyrrell and Washington
counties. A tornado warning was issued for Dare County, although no
damage was reported there.
   Randy Spear of Creswell said he heard wind, then saw branches and
small trees fly through the air just before he spotted the tornado.
   ``I grabbed my dog and ran toward the center bathroom in the
house, and as I left the den, the back window just caved in,'' Spear
said. He said he and his Labrador retriever, Fanci, were unhurt.
   Spear said the twister blew out the windows in the back of his
home and tossed four trees onto his roof.
   The twister blew the roofs of two other houses, destroyed four
mobile homes and damaged three others in the Creswell area, said
Linda Spruill, a sheriff's deputy. She said 75 to 80 trees were
blown onto U.S. 64, and many of them knocked down power lines.
   More than 1,000 customers were without electricity, an official
of North Carolina power said. North Carolina Power hoped to restore
power to the area by the end of the day, said C.B. Davis, operations
supervisor. '
   A woman was treated at Chowan Hospital in Edenton for minor
injuries after her mobile home was destroyed by a tornado, the
hospital said.
   Some small tornadoes and waterspouts were reported over the
northern beaches of the Outer Banks and the Currituck Sound, the
National Weather Service said.
   A waterspout raged ashore at Point Harbor in Currituck County,
throwing a construction trailer into a bulldozer and ripping the
roof off a warehouse.
   A tornado blew over a mobile home and tore the roofs off some
other buildings in Point Harbor, but no injuries were reported, the
weather service said.
   In Tyrrell County, three mobile homes and a house were destroyed
by tornado-like wind, said Buddy Swain, an emergency management
coordinator in Columbia. About 200 trees and a number of power lines
were knocked down in the storm, but no injuries were reported.
   The wind was spawned by thunderstorms moving through eastern
North Carolina, the weather service said.

   The Federal Communications Commission took a
major step Thursday toward making advanced telephone services such
as voice mail and computer gateways available on a wide scale to
average consumers.
   The FCC also, however, reopened a thorny issue that earlier met
vigorous opposition from the providers of these electronic
information services who resisted an agency proposal to add hefty
charges to their bills.
   The commission's action moves toward opening the phone networks
so that connections and circuits will be available on an equal basis
to competing companies that want to provide advanced phone services.
   Competition, the commission says, will result in lower prices and
more choices for consumers, as long as the Bell companies are not
allowed to use their control of the local phone networks to
disadvantage competitors.
   Open Network Architecture, as the plan is called, ``will pass
along to average residential consumers the ability to patronize the
fruits of the information age,'' said FCC Chairman Dennis R. Patrick.
   The three sitting commissioners voted unanimously to approve the
Bell companies' plans in substantial part but to require revisions
in specified areas, in part to ensure greater uniformity among their
separate plans. The FCC also approved American Telephone & Telegraph
Co.'s plan in total.
   Many of the enhanced services dealt with in the plans are already
available on a limited scale from the phone companies. Open Network
Architecture is expected to result in more competition, which would
bring the services to more consumers at lower prices, the FCC said.
   The FCC pointed to voice mail as an example of a service that it
expects to become more widely available and attractive to average
consumers. This service permits callers to send and receive recorded
messages in a manner similar to that now available with telephone
answering machines.
   However, instead of having to buy an answering machine, callers
would need only a touch-tone phone. The messaging capabilities would
be provided out of a centralized computer.
   Computer gateways allows easier access to electronic data bases.
Computer users would have access to many different information
services by dialing just one number.
   Most of the Bell companies applauded the action, but BellSouth
said the FCC should have allowed its plan to charge information
service providers based on their usage of the network, instead of a
flat rate as they are now.
   Attorney Stephen Bell, who represents Tymnet and has been a
leading spokesman for the information providers, said that while
there was ``a lot of good news'' in the FCC's action, he was
concerned about the issue of how these providers will be charged by
phone companies.
   The commission specifically noted that an existing exemption from
network access charges would continue for information service
providers, although the FCC agreed to begin proceedings that could
consider removing the exemption under certain circumstances.
   ``This could have a dramatic and serious effect on the
information services industry,'' Bell said, promising to fight
vigorously against removal of the exemption.
   Earlier this year, after an outcry from the industry, the FCC
retreated from a proposal to lift the exemption. Without the
exemption, costs could more than double, in some cases, for computer
users dialing into information data bases.

   Political candidates who found themselves
opposed by Lee Atwater would often wind up wishing they could hire
him _ or else blaming him for alleged dirty tricks that damaged
their campaigns.
   Now President-elect George Bush has handpicked the 37-year-old
Atwater to work on behalf of all Republicans who run for office.
   Bush selected his former campaign manager Thursday to become
chairman of the Republican National Committee, a choice sure to be
ratified, probably unanimously, when the committee meets Jan. 18,
two days before Bush's inauguration.
   ``He's a friend; I'm proud of his accomplishments,'' Bush said of
the man who helped orchestrate his victory Nov. 8.
   Atwater will succeed Frank Fahrenkopf Jr., a 48-year-old Reno,
Nev. lawyer whose seven years in the post make him the
longest-serving GOP chief in this century.
   Atwater's friends say that while he likes having a ``tough-guy''
image, his reputation for stepping beyond the bounds of political
propriety is undeserved.
   Atwater, who described himself as a ``nuts and bolts
politician,'' will take control of a party that has been successful
in electing five of the last six presidents but has not been able to
gain control of Congress. Politics has been his life; he's been
active since his college days.
   ``I will be extremely campaign-oriented,'' Atwater told
reporters, adding that he hoped to help Republicans win elections
from the courthouse to the state house to the White House. He said
he would launch special efforts to lure black and Hispanic voters
into Republican ranks.
   ``Every political reporter in the country worth his salt has
scoured Lee's background and haven't found one dirty trick,'' said
Christopher Simpson, press secretary to Sen. Strom Thurmond, R-S.C.
Atwater, a South Carolina native, worked for Thurmond as an intern
in 1978.
   ``I would say he's tough as nails,'' Simpson said. ``I think
people probably do confuse tough with dirty.''
   Thurmond praised Atwater as a ``superb choice'' for the RNC post.
   ``He's got a tough-guy image,'' said South Carolina GOP Chairman
Van Hipp. ``I think Lee enjoys it, to be honest with you.''
   At times in the 1988 race for the White House, the image of
Atwater pulling strings seemed to drive some of Bush's Republican
opponents to distraction.
   Early this year Sen. Bob Dole, R-Kan., accused Atwater of being
behind a series of disclosures about his wife's finances.
   Atwater's answer was to call Dole ``a typical schoolyard bully _
he can dish it out but if someone hits him back, he starts
whining.'' He also sent Dole a 10-page letter listing negative
tactics that he said Dole had used.
   Asked about that, Dole said, ``I don't respond to Lee Atwater.''
   But he already had.
   A day earlier, Dole confronted Bush on the floor of the Senate
and demanded an apology.
   Simpson used ``brilliant'' to describe Atwater's ability of
drawing an opponent's fire to himself and away from the candidate he
serves.
   That's what happened in the Dole-Bush confrontation when Dole
complained, ``Here's the Bush campaign, maybe not the vice president
himself, but Lee Atwater and others out distributing things that
they think might reflect on Elizabeth Dole for some reason.''
   Television evangelist Pat Robertson, at the time also a candidate
for the GOP presidential nomination, accused Atwater of being
personally responsible for setting the date of the South Carolina
primary to give Bush a boost just before the crucial one-day round
of Southern primaries in March.
   Robertson could not bring himself to utter Atwater's name, but
his meaning was unmistakable: ``I understand a campaign manager of
an unnamed vice president is from South Carolina, and he has
determined he would like to have his man have a bit of an edge by a
big win here ... that would propel him to a better showing
throughout the South.''
   Hipp denied that Atwater had anything to do with the timing of
the South Carolina primary.
   New York Rep. Jack Kemp, another of this year's unsuccessful
Republican presidential candidates, wanted to hire Atwater to manage
his campaign.
   ``I've always been a fan of Atwater's; I think he's a sharp
guy,'' Kemp said Thursday. ``I knew I couldn't hire him.''
   ``Is he going to have enemies? You bet,'' Kemp said. ``I think
people should let bygones be bygones. What good is it to hold
grudges in politics?''
   Atwater signed on with Bush, whom he had helped defeat for the
presidential nomination in 1980. At the time Atwater was the manager
of Ronald Reagan's campaign in South Carolina and was credited with
unleashing a series of radio commercials attacking Bush on gun
control.
   In 1984 Atwater was the deputy manager of Reagan's re-election
campaign and later he became a partner in the lobbying firm of
Black, Manafort & Stone, whose $800,000 contract to represent the
Bahamian government briefly became a campaign issue this year.
   Atwater became politically active when he went to college and
became national director of the College Republicans when Bush was
RNC chairman in 1973-74.
   Before that, he was a professional musician, playing the guitar
for rock 'n' roll singer Percy Sledge.

<HEAD>First British Arts Minister Jennie Lee, 85</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Jennie Lee, Britain's first arts minister and the
widow of Labor Party politician Aneurin Bevan, has died, her friend
Lord Goodman said Thursday. She was 85.
   Goodman said Ms. Lee died Wednesday at her London home. The cause
of death was not immediately available.
   Ms. Lee's major achievement was to take politics ``clean out of
the arts,'' said Goodman, who was chairman of the state-appointed
Arts Council when Ms. Lee was made arts minister in 1965-1970 by
Labor Prime Minister, Harold Wilson.
   As minister she had a leading role in establishing the Open
University, which offered higher education through evening classes,
radio and television and correspondence to thousands who had never
been to college.
   Labor Party leader Neil Kinnock in a tribute called her a ``woman
of brilliance and vision, a great socialist, who inspired so many
and was loved by all who knew her warmth and passion for justice.''
   Ms. Lee received a life peerage as Baroness Lee of Asheridge with
a seat in the House of Lords after losing her House of Commons seat
in the 1970 general election. In 1972 she promoted legislation
allowing theaters to open on Sundays.
   Jennie Lee, a Scottish miner's daughter, won a scholarship to
Edinburgh University, where she majored in law and then qualified as
a schoolteacher.
   Bevan, a Welsh miner's son whom she married in 1934, established
the state-run National Health Service in 1948 against opposition
from the medical profession. He died in 1960. The couple had no
children.

<HEAD>Judge Rejects North Charge Of Prosecutor Abuse</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The judge in the Iran-Contra conspiracy case on
Thursday rejected Oliver L. North's charges of prosecutorial abuse
by independent counsel Lawrence E. Walsh, saying the defense had
indulged ``misinformation and hyperbole'' in a motion to dismiss the
case.
   ``North finds it appropriate to assert prosecutorial misdconduct
in the harshest terms based solely on his self-serving suspicions,''
U.S. District Judge Gerhard A. Gesell said in turning back the
motion.
   ``This is not the mark of responsible advocacy,'' Gesell said,
chastising the former presidential aide's defense lawyers.
   ``This is a motion which, by caption and text, appears
significant, but which, in substance, is, to a considerable extent,
based on misinformation and hyperbole,'' the judge wrote in a
five-page opinion.
   The defense contended that prosecutors had given grand jurors
``patently erroneous'' legal instructions and ``systematically
excluded'' evidence that would show the retired Marine lieutenant
colonel's innocence.
   But Gesell, who has reviewed the grand jury transcript, said
``these exaggerated statements are made in total disregard of the
careful instructions and monitoring of the grand jury throughout its
proceedings by the chief judge of this court.''
   ``Moreover, the statements concerning what occurred before the
grand jury are largely based on inferences reached by counsel
without any knowledge of what actually took place'' during the
secret proceedings, the judge said
   North, a former National Security Council aide, is charged with
conspiring with former national security adviser John M. Poindexter
and arms dealers Albert Hakim and Richard V. Secord, to illegally
divert profits from U.S.-Iran arms-sales to the Nicaraguan rebels.
   No date has been set for North's trial, the first of four ordered
by Gesell.
   The judge dismissed North's suggestion that prosecutors failed to
tell the grand jury about whether the so-called Boland Amendments
prohibiting direct U.S. military aid to the Contras applied to the
National Security Council staff.
   ``There is no requirement that the grand jury be instructed on
every aspect of the law, as North appears to suggest,'' Gesell said.
   ``Never have prosecutors had to present all possible legal
defenses to a grand jury, much less did the independent counsel have
to introduce the ones suggested by North, many of which are based on
the most speculative of legal theories, as this court has so ruled
in dismissing several of his motions.''

   Two diplomats who accompanied Afghanistan's
prime minister on his mission to the United Nations last week have
defected, U.S. officials said Thursday.
   The State Department confirmed the diplomats did not return to
Kabul but would not say more about their whereabouts, according to
an official at the U.S. Mission to the United Nations who spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   Other U.S. officials confirmed the diplomats had defected to the
United States.
   Sources at the United Nations and other U.S. officials said the
defectors were a deputy foreign minister and another senior diplomat.
   Abdul Ghaffar Lakanwal serves as deputy foreign minister for
Afghanistan, according to Rosanne Klass, a former New York Times
reporter who wrote ``Afghanistan: The Great Game Revisited.''
   U.N. and State Department sources said earlier Thursday that one
of the defectors was a deputy foreign minister named Lanikwal. The
U.N. sources said the other defector was named Kamal.
   Lakanwal's career had been in decline, Klass said. He was
minister for Agriculture and Land Reform from 1981 to March 1987,
when he was dropped from the Cabinet.
   No spokesmen were available for comment at Afghanistan's Mission
to the United Nations. Government offices were closed in Pakistan
and Afghanistan when the U.S. officials confirmed the defection.
   Afghan Prime Minister Mohammad Hassan Sharq was in New York last
week for talks with Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar and
other officials.

<HEAD>EPA Proposes Rules Giving States, Polluters More Say Over Toxic
Waste Sites</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GUY DARST</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Environmental Protection Agency on Thursday
unveiled, 19 months late, a massive draft revision of regulations
that could give states and polluters more say in whether toxic waste
sites are put into the ``superfund'' cleanup program.
   The agency said it ``got what we wanted'' in a long battle with
the Office of Management and Budget over cleanup standards.
   Superfund provides money for cleanups only for sites that the
program has placed on a ``national priority list,'' currently
containing 1,175 sites out of 30,013 possible. Such a listing also
qualifies communities for federal health studies and grants to
community groups and local governments to pay for their
participation in site discussions.
   States contribute 10 percent to cleanup costs, direct many
cleanups under EPA oversight, and sometimes clean up sites that
never make the federal program at all. Companies responsible for
disposal of the waste in the first place also are handling many
cleanups.
   EPA's proposed regulations would permit the agency not to list
sites if a state petitions to handle the cleanup on its own.
   ``EPA recognizes that many more sites need to be addressed than
present (superfund) resources can accommodate; by deferring some
problem sites to the states, EPA believes more overall response
actions can be accomplished more quickly, and EPA can direct its
resources to sites that would otherwise not be addressed,'' the
draft regulation said.
   Agreements with polluting companies to clean up sites and not put
them on the priority list ``may facilitate EPA efforts to
expeditiously obtain such enforcement agreements,'' it said.
   EPA still would specify the details of the cleanup if the agency
agreed with a polluter to keep the site off the list, it said.
   A state might want to keep a site off the Superfund priority list
in the belief that it could get a cleanup finished much more quickly
than EPA's cumbersome procedures would allow. It wouldn't lose
federal funds if the company responsible had agreed to pay for the
cleanup.
   A company has an obvious incentive to keep sites off the list _
avoidance of publicity.
   J. Winston Porter, EPA's assistant administrator for solid waste
and emergency response, said he believed it would be difficult for a
state to get full responsibility for a site if its cleanup standards
were not as strict as EPA's.
   In New York, David Strait, superfund specialist for the Natural
Resources Defense Council, said ``It's just outrageous'' for EPA to
propose ways to give polluters more control over cleanups and leave
local communities without financial assistance by keeping sites off
the priority list.
   The document also proposes extensive revisions to the numerical
system by which EPA assesses the seriousness of toxic waste sites.
The changes would permit threats to the environment, chronic health
threats and potential threats such as accumulation of a contaminant
in the food chain to be considered.
   EPA was required by 1986 amendments to the superfund law to
publish new final regulations by April 1988, which would have meant
publishing a draft in April 1987, Porter said.
   The statutory requirement for ``having (the draft) out in six
months made interesting reading but it just couldn't be done,''
Porter said.
   The 769-page, four-pound document will attract ``tons of
comment,'' and will be adopted in about a year, Porter said. The
last revision took almost three years from publication to adoption,
from 1982 to 1985.
   If there are no other applicable regulations on cancer-causing
chemicals at the site, EPA proposes to aim at cleanups that will
leave nearby residents with no more than a one in 10 million to one
in 10,000 chance of getting cancer.
   OMB had sought to limit the lower end of this range to one in a
million instead of one in 10 million. Some court decisions and other
programs in EPA and other agencies have used one in a million as the
cutoff below which risks may be ignored.
   Porter said OMB had a ``legitimate question'' but EPA believed
``it would send a terrible message'' to adopt OMB's position because
the agency already was using the standard.
   OMB's dispute with EPA lasted four months, and Rep. John Dingell,
D-Mich., chairman of the investigations subcommittee of the House
Energy and Commerce Committee, said in a statement that
President-elect George Bush could show his commitment to
environmental protection by ``preventing OMB from interfering in the
future.''
   An aide in OMB's press office said she would ask if any officials
wanted to reply to Dingell, but no one had responded by Thursday
evening.

   A U.S. Bankruptcy judge on Thursday
rejected two offers for the PTL ministry, ordered bidding to ``start
from scratch'' and said he'd liquidate the evangelical empire if the
sale is not completed by Dec. 13.
   ``It's either then or nothing,'' Judge Rufus Reynolds said.
   The judge directed PTL bankruptcy trustee M.C. ``Red'' Benton to
draft guidelines for prospective buyers that incorporate certain
conditions he previously set forth.
   The auction Thursday between two Canadian businessmen was
expected to close the books on the ministry that Jim and Tammy
Bakker built before a sex-and-money scandal forced it to seek
Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection from its creditors.
   The judge, however, said he had decided to ``turn all of them
down and to start from scratch.''
   Bidding in the December auction will begin at $50 million to $60
million, Benton said, adding he expected one or two more bidders to
appear.
   Reynolds scheduled another auction for Dec. 12 and said he would
approve a buyer the next day, warning that if the case is not
concluded by then, ``I will not put up with this case any longer
under (Chapter) 11. I will move it to Chapter 7.''
   Under Chapter 7, the doors would be closed and the court would
proceed to a straight liquidation.
   In either case the sale proceeds would be applied to the
ministry's debts, which could reach $130 million.
   Reynolds said he preferred Chapter 11 because Chapter 7 ``doesn't
bring the most money to the most people.''
   Some creditors have pushed for immediate liquidation, citing the
costs of keeping the facility running. Reynolds said PTL is losing
$300,000 to $400,000 a month.
   Vancouver real estate magnate Peter Thomas, 50, opened the
bidding Thursday with a $70 million cash offer that allowed him to
back out of the deal within a certain time after closing _ a
provision Reynolds objected to.
   Canadian businessman Stephen Mernick, a 34-year-old real estate
developer who is an Orthodox Jew, then bid $115 million with a $50
million initial payment, but Reynolds objected that there were
inadequate assurances that Mernick would pay the remaining $65
million.
   Both Mernick and Thomas said they would consider their
alternatives before deciding whether to continue bidding.
   PTL has been operating since last summer as a non-profit
corporation known as Heritage Ministries, Inc.
   The remaining for-profit organization, including the theme park,
hotel and shopping mall at the Heritage USA complex at Fort Mill and
1,700 undeveloped acres nearby, have been under the bankruptcy
court's control pending its sale.
   With the proposed sale of assets, PTL as an entity would cease to
exist, leaving behind only Heritage Ministries, Inc.
   Australian businessman Gavin Morehu; Charlotte, N.C., businessman
George Shinn; and Bakker all have said they wanted to buy the site,
then faded from view. Bakker fell from the bidding earlier this fall
when he was unable to raise a $3 million down payment. The Bakkers
now are trying to raise money for a new TV ministry.
   The effort to sell PTL has dragged on since Reynolds withdrew an
earlier deadline of Oct. 1 at Benton's request for more time.
   PTL filed for bankruptcy protection in 1987, three months after
Bakker stepped aside over a sexual encounter with Jessica Hahn, a
church secretary.
   Donations to the ministry dwindled amid ensuing revelations about
the luxurious lifestyle enjoyed by the Bakkers.

   The Kremlin summoned Estonian leaders to Moscow on
Thursday and expressed serious doubt about the constitutionality of
the tiny Baltic republic's unprecedented challenge to its authority.
   In Lithuania meanwhile residents gathered outside their
parliament building with banners and flags, watching on live
television as their legislators convened a session at which they
will debate a similar challenge to Moscow's authority.
   In Latvia _ the third of the restive Baltic republics _ residents
prepared for demonstrations and rallies Friday on the 70th
anniversary of the birth after World War I of their short-lived
independent nation.
   State Department spokesman Charles Redman said in Washington:
``The United States does not recognize the forcible incorporation of
the Baltic states. ... The people of the Baltic states have been
denied their basic human rights.''
   The Estonian Supreme Soviet, or parliament, overwhelmingly passed
a constitutional amendment Wednesday requiring Estonian approval of
any new Soviet law.
   The parliament also approved a ``declaration of sovereignty''
asserting Estonia's independence in all areas except defense and
foreign affairs.
   On their way to Moscow, Estonian leaders expressed satisfaction
with a constitutional amendment reserving the right to review all
new Soviet laws, and said they were prepared to argue the issue with
the Kremlin.
   ``Perestroika is a hope and democracy is a hope, and every hope
has a moment of unease,'' the newly elected Estonian premier, Indrek
Toome, said during a flight from Tallinn to Moscow.
   ``The dialogue has begun,'' said Igor Grazin, the Estonian lawyer
who wrote the amendment and will defend it before the federal
Supreme Soviet's Presidium, the highest executive body in the Soviet
Union.
   The Estonian parliament made its challenge under the banner of
the reform effort President Mikhail S. Gorbachev calls perestroika.
The challenge illustrates Gorbachev's continuing serious problems
with rising ethnic feelings that, if successful, could spread to
other areas.
   Moscow's first reaction Thursday was measured, but deeply
skeptical.
   ``Taking into consideration that the amendment and a number of
other documents adopted by the Estonian parliament are at variance
with the provisions of the current Constitution of the U.S.S.R., the
Presidium of the U.S.S.R. Supreme Soviet has decided to consider the
above-mentioned issue at its next meeting, with representatives of
the Estonian republic to be invited,'' the Tass news agency reported.
   The Presidium is the Soviet government's highest executive
authority and Gorbachev serves as its chairman.
   Tass said committees of the national Supreme Soviet were ordered
to prepare an analysis of the issue, which it said ``affects the
initial principles of the building and unity of the Soviet socialist
federation.''
   It did not say when the meeting would take place, but presumably
it would be before the national parliament goes into session again
Nov. 29.
   Residents of the westward-looking Baltic republics have been
pushing for greater economic and cultural freedom from Moscow under
Gorbachev's reform policy. Thousands of people in Lithuania, Estonia
and Latvia have joined the grassroots People's Front organization.
Some members say privately their ultimate goal is secession from the
Soviet Union.
   The Baltics have been angered by amendments to the national
constitution proposed by Gorbachev, saying they would shift the
little power they have to Moscow and eliminate their constitutional
right to secede.
   The three republics were independent countries between the world
wars and were annexed by the Soviet Union in 1940 following a 1939
pact between the Soviets and the Nazis.
   There have been signs of Kremlin impatience with the Baltics.
Politburo member Alexander N. Yakovlev, believed to be Gorbachev's
closest adviser, said in an interview last month that they will not
be allowed to take any major steps toward independence.
   In another sign of the Kremlin's concern, three Politburo members
were sent to the Baltics last week to urge them to tone down their
nationalism. Former KGB chief Viktor M. Chebrikov criticized the
Estonian Communist Party for encouraging nationalism.
   The Lithuanian parliament met Thursday in a session that will
take up a declaration of Lithuanian as the republic's official
language, and other legislation following Estonia's example.
   But Alexander Gelbaf, deputy editor of the official newspaper
Sovietskaya Litva, said in a telephone interview that the parliament
took up only budgetary matters.
   He said the constitutional questions would be debated in a
session beginning Friday.
   As in Estonia, the session was televised from start to finish.
   Thousands of Lithuanians rallied Wednesday night outside the
Supreme Soviet building in Vilnius, the capital, and hundreds more
waited outside the parliament building throughout the day Thursday,
said Veleya Terleckiene.
   Ms. Terleckiene, daughter of Anastas Terleckas a leader of the
separatist Lithuanian Liberty League, said they carried flags of
formerly independent Lithuania and banners supporting Lithuanian
autonomy.
   She said the entire republic, including members of the Communist
Party, supported the intiatives of Sajudis, the Lithuanian People's
Front, to be debated Friday by the parliament.

   Riot police fired tear gas Thursday to
drive back thousands of angry farmers who were marching on the U.S.
Embassy to protest imports of American farm products.
   Fighting began when police barred the path of about 7,000
farmers. Hundreds of protesters armed with rocks and clubs charged
about 2,000 policemen, who formed a human barricade behind their
shields a few hundred yards from the embassy.
   Scores of radical students joined the farmers and hurled
firebombs.
   About a dozen protesters and police were seen bleeding or being
carried away but police did not provide figures on injuries or
arrests. Suh Kyong-won, an opposition legislator, was injured when
he tried to stop police who charged protesters.
   Some citizens booed police when elderly farmers hurled their
bodies against shields. Officers refrained from firing tear gas at
that point and some moved away.
   The protesters dispersed after about 90 minutes, but thousands of
police ringed the embassy and guarded adjacent streets and nearby
residences of U.S. diplomats.
   Farmers had marched peacefully for about six miles after a rally
near the National Assembly building, shouting ``Drive out Yankees!''
and ``Oppose U.S. agricultural imports!''
   It was the most violent demonstration in Seoul by farmers, who
have protested U.S. pressure on South Korea to open its markets to
beef, wine and other agricultural products. Many wore headbands
saying, ``No U.S. wine and beef'' and ``Down with U.S.
imperialists.''
   South Korean farmers believe cheap agricultural imports threaten
their livelihoods and have urged the government to resist U.S.
pressure.
   Trade conflicts between the allies have fanned anti-American
sentiment. Thursday's protesters chanted ``Drive out Yankees, who
force the market-opening pressure!''

<HEAD>Army Introduces `Manny' The Robot For Chemical Testing</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By VERN ANDERSON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>DUGWAY PROVING GROUND, Utah (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A robot named Manny joined the
U.S. Army on Thursday to test soldiers' clothing against agents used
in chemical warfare.
   The $2.8 million man-sized mannequin, capable of walking,
crouching, breathing and perspiring, is fitted with sensors to
immediately detect penetration of up to one-billionth of an ounce of
chemical agent through the clothing it wears.
   ``This is the kind of information it has been extremely difficult
to obtain in the past,'' said Dr. Lothar Salomon, scientific
director at this sprawling Army post in the western Utah desert.
   Salomon, who came up with the idea of using a robot in 1985, said
such tests had been conducted primarily with simulants until now.
   ``The answers from these tests are not the same as the answers
you get from real chemical agents,'' he said. ``(Manny) was
definitely something we felt we had to have.''
   The 5-foot-11 robot was developed by Battelle's Pacific Northwest
Laboratories in Richland, Wash., which provided robotics for the
Department of Energy for handling of radioactive materials.
   Salomon said the cost of the robot would likely ensure it will be
one of a kind, at least for the testing of protective clothing worn
by all branches of the military, which is performed at Dugway.
   The design is government-owned, but he said government approval
of commercial sales would be ``a mere formality.''
   Unable to balance itself, the robot hangs from a mechanical arm
located in the small of its back. The robot's work is performed
within a hermetically sealed environment and is controlled by
computers.
   Reporters were given a demonstration in which Manny performed
toe-touches, crouched, walked, duck-walked and kicked a ball dropped
from his hand.
   ``I hope you enjoyed my demonstration,'' Manny said with a
farewell wave.
   During tests, he would perform similar exercises while wearing
protective gear in an environment contaminated with chemical agents.
   Manny can walk at 3 mph. Movement is provided by rotary and
linear hydraulic actuators placed at each of his 38 joints.
   A clear plastic covers the skeleton, giving the robot a human
shape. The plastic will be covered by a thick skin of butyl rubber,
which will carry the chemical agent detectors.
   Perspiration is simulated by injecting water through capillary
tubes to the surface of the rubber skin. Breathing is simulated by
the expansion and contraction of the chest at variable rates.
   Moist air is injected at the nose and mouth to simulate
exhalation.
   Manny can be decontaminated after a test without anyone entering
the controlled environment.
   Battelle borrowed ideas for Manny's arm from the robotic Michael
Jackson performing at Disney World, said David W. Bennett, a
Battelle technical group leader for mechanical systems and robotics.
   ``Manny is the result of a general realization that chemical
warfare is a continuing concern,'' Salomon said. ``What we issue to
the troops we have to have a high degree of confidence is the best
available.''

   President-elect George Bush on Thursday named
New Hampshire Gov. John Sununu as White House chief of staff and
tapped wily campaign strategist Lee Atwater as chairman of the
Republican National Committee.
   Bush's selection of Sununu as his top White House adviser
prompted Craig L. Fuller to reveal that he would quit working for
Bush after the transition ends in January.
   Fuller said he informed Bush last month he would accept no post
other than chief of staff. Fuller told The Associated Press that
Bush had let him know on Election Day that he was giving that job to
Sununu.
   Bush said he would like Fuller, co-chairman of the transition
team and his chief of staff since 1985, to consider a role in his
administration but that he chose Sununu because he was the ``right
man for the job.''
   ``John Sununu has the background and experience necessary to work
not only with his former colleagues in the nation's statehouses but
also to build a constructive relationship with the U.S. Congress,''
he said.
   Sununu, the first Washington outsider to be named by Bush, will
bring ``a refreshing new perspective'' to the job, the
president-elect said.
   Atwater will succeed Frank Fahrenkopf Jr., who announced months
ago that he would relinquish the GOP chairmanship at the end of
President Reagan's term and return to Nevada to practice law.
   Bush said Atwater's function will be ``winning elections.'' While
Republicans have won the presidency in five of the last six
elections, they have been less successful at the congressional
level, where Democrats hold comfortable majorities.
   ``I'm a nuts-and-bolts politician,'' Atwater said. ``I will be
extremely campaign oriented.''
   The Republican National Committee will formally act on Bush's
choice in January.
   Bush made the announcements after meeting over breakfast with
British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and his customary weekly
lunch with Reagan. Also on his schedule Thursday was an evening
centennial banquet of the National Geographic Society.
   Both Sununu and Atwater share reputations as adept players of
political hardball.
   Atwater is considered a master of negative campaigning, and was
an architect of the strategy that helped Bush wipe out a 17-point
poll lead by Democrat Michael Dukakis and romp to a 40-state victory
in the presidential race.
   Sununu, 49, an engineer by training and a former Tufts University
professor, has no previous experience in Washington. He has a
reputation for being a quick study, highly intelligent and
assertive. Some also regard him as arrogant and abrasive, traits
that could hurt him in working with Congress.
   Sununu made light of that reputation Thursday.
   ``I'm a pussycat,'' Sununu said. ``Let me tell you about
Washington. Certainly I have a lot to learn in regard to the
details. I think I'm a quick learner. I consider a great number of
congressmen to be close friends, both Democratic and Republican.''
   Jewish lobbyists have criticized the New Hampshire governor for
being the only governor to refuse to endorse a proclamation
attacking a 1975 U.N. resolution that equated zionism with racism.
   ``I'm very sensitive to that issue,'' said Sununu, who is partly
of Arab descent.
   ``The problem I had as a governor is that I felt it was
inappropriate. In terms of the issue, I have no problem saying it
should be repudiated.''
   He acknowledged that he was a considered a conservative
Republican governor and had no intention of changing his political
philosophy. But he promised to be a ``honest broker'' and consider
both sides of an issue.
   Sununu had declined to run for a fourth term as governor, citing
a need to return to ``the real world to get a real job.'' He and his
wife, Nancy, have eight children.
   He is credited with helping revive Bush's candidacy with a
victory in the New Hampshire primary last February after the vice
president finished a poor third in Iowa's caucuses.
   Atwater, 37, was a chief architect of Bush's winning campaign. A
native of South Carolina, Atwater was a White House aide to
President Reagan and also worked for Sen. Strom Thurmond of South
Carolina.
   On other matters:
   _Bush was asked about a report that he would meet with Mexico's
president-elect, Carlos Salinas. ``If I were to have a meeting with
the incoming president of Mexico ... it would be to symbolize the
importance I place on the relationship with Mexico.''
   _He said the CIA would be an ``intelligence agency'' and would
not be making policy.
   After her meeting with Bush, Mrs. Thatcher described him as a
leader with a ``very, very wide knowledge'' who needs no
introduction to foreign affairs. But she said she told him ``a fresh
approach'' was needed in the Middle East.''
   Bush was scheduled to make a quick trip Friday morning to
Charlottesville, Va., for a private meeting with the executive
committee of the National Governors' Association. Sununu, a past
chairman of the association, also will attend.
   The president-elect was then flying back immediately to
Washington, reportedly for a luncheon date with House Speaker Jim
Wright.
   Bush has already named two longtime friends, James A. Baker III
and Nicholas F. Brady as the cornerstone members of his Cabinet, as
secretaries of State and Treasury, respectively. Brady replaced
Baker at Treasury after Baker quit in August to become Bush's
campaign chairman.

<HEAD>Peres Spearheads Israeli Damage Control Over Palestinian Meeting</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KARIN LAUB</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Foreign Minister Shimon Peres, spearheading an
Israeli damage control drive, accused the PLO on Thursday of
deceiving the world by claiming it moderated its positions at the
Palestine National Council meeting.
   ``We feel very strongly that under the headline of moderation,
what really happened is a more extreme position taken by the PNC,''
he told foreign reporters at a news conference.
   The council, which acts as the legislature of Yasser Arafat's
Palestine Liberation Organization, declared an independent
Palestinian state Tuesday at the end of a four-day session in
Algiers, capital of Algeria.
   As of Thursday, 25 nations had recognized the Palestinian state.
President Corazon Aquino said in Manila that the Philippines was
considering recognition.
   Delegates at Algiers also implictly recognized Israel and said
the council would limit guerrilla operations to military targets in
Israeli-occupied territories.
   Peres, head of the left-leaning Labor Party, said the council's
declaration of a Palestinian state further sabotaged the Middle East
peace process.
   ``I see an attempt to throw a stone into a structure of glass
(the peace process), so delicate, so breakable,'' Peres said. He
said the final status of the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip must
be negotiated in peace talks.
   Israeli ambassadors sought meetings with foreign ministers in
various host countries to explain Israel's position and prevent
recognition of the new state.
   ``We are trying to have some damage control,'' he said.
   Israel is also working out a joint strategy with the United
States to keep the Palestinian state from being accredited as an
observer nation in the United Nations, Peres said.
   He said the outgoing Israeli government, deeply divided on peace
issues, stood united in its rejection of the PLO positions. ``Isn't
it your impression that we have the same position for a change?''
Peres said when asked if he was stating government policy.
   He argued that the Palestinians at Algiers rejected the three
conditions posed by America for talks with the PLO: recognition of
Israel, renunciation of terror and acceptance of U.N. Security
Council resolutions 242 and 338.
   Resolution 338, in one major provision, calls for negotiations
between the parties for ``a just and durable peace in the Middle
East.''
   Resolution 242, adopted earlier after the 1967 Mideast war, asks
Israel to withdraw from captured territory and declares the right of
all states in the region to exist within secure borders.
   In accepting 242, the Algiers meeting coupled it with the right
of the Palestinian people to self-determination.
   Peres argued that by adding phrases, the council perverted the
meaning of the resolution.
   He also discounted interpretations that the PLO implicitly
recognized Israel by declaring a Palestinian state based on the 1947
U.N. partition plan which calls for a Jewish and an Arab state side
by side in Palestine.
   ``Israel is not an implicit state. You either recognize it, or
you don't,'' Peres said.
   State Department spokesman Charles Redman had said in Washington
Wednesday that implicit recognition was insufficient. ``Recognition
must be clear and unambiguous,'' he said.
   Peres also claimed the PLO had not renounced terrorism.
   In a statement in reply to written questions submitted by
reporters, Mrs. Aquino hailed a political declaration by the council
on the U.N. resolutions as ``a positive development not only for the
Philippines but for the whole world.''
   The Philippines depends on the Middle East for most of its oil
needs and sends thousands of workers to Arab countries each year.
   Nations which recognized the Palestinian state are: Afghanistan,
Algeria, Bahrain, Bangladesh, India, Indonesia, Iraq, Jordan,
Kuwait, Libya, Madagascar, Malaysia, Mauritania, Morocco, Nicaragua,
North Yemen, South Yemen, Qatar, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Sudan,
Tunisia, Turkey, the United Arab Emirates and Yugoslavia.
   The Egyptian daily Al-Ahram said Cuba, Zambia and Somalia also
recognized the Palestinian state, but cited no source.

<HEAD>Immigrations Board Says IRA Member Can Pursue Efforts to Avoid
Deportation</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Immigration Appeals Board has ruled that
Joseph Doherty of the Irish Republican Army, wanted for the killing
of a British soldier, should be allowed to proceed with legal
efforts to avoid deportation from the United States.
   Doherty's attorney, Mary Pike, received a copy of the opinion
Thursday. The board had made its decision Monday.
   Under the 3-2 ruling, Doherty is entitled to a hearing before an
immigration judge where he could present claims for political asylum
and withholding of deportation. Doherty would have to show a
well-founded fear of persecution to substantiate an asylum claim.
   ``Federal courts which have considered asylum claims by the
Dohertys of the world have consistently ruled in their favor,''
board member Michael J. Heilman stated in an opinion concurring with
the majority in the ruling.
   On June 14, then-Attorney General Edwin Meese III refused a
request by Doherty to be deported to Ireland instead of to Britain.
That order was appealed.
   The government may appeal the latest ruling to Attorney General
Dick Thornburgh.
   Doherty has been held in a federal jail _ the Metropolitan
Correctional Center in lower Manhattan _ for five years while courts
weighed whether the slaying was a political act, for which he could
not be extradited to Britain.
   Doherty was convicted in 1981 of killing a British Army captain
in an ambush on a British convoy in Belfast. In the closing days of
his trial, Mr. Doherty escaped from a prison in Northern Ireland and
fled to the United States, where he was arrested in 1983.

   An 18-year-old bodybuilder from Iceland won the
38th Miss World beauty contest Thursday.
   Linda Petursdottir, a 5-foot-7 blonde hotel receptionist,
received the $54,000 prize after a panel of judges selected her from
among 84 contestants.
   The first runner-up was Miss Republic of Korea, 22-year-old
Yeon-He Choi from Seoul, South Korea. She received a $3,600 prize.
   Miss United Kingdom, 17-year-old Kirsty Roper, was third and
received $1,800.
   The new Miss World, who also holds the Miss Iceland title, is a
bodybuilder who swims and plays the organ. She said traveling is her
life's ambition.
   The title involves world travel, modeling and sponsorship.
   Miss World 1988 succeeds last year's winner, 21-year-old Ulla
Weigerstorfer of Austria.
   The 90-minute spectacle at London's Royal Albert Hall, showed
contestants in national costumes, swimwear and evening gowns.
   It was broadcast live by the Thames Television commercial
network. However, Thames said it won't broadcast Miss World again
because of declining viewership.

<TEXT>
   The General Assembly passed its annual
resolution Thursday urging Britain and Argentina to open
negotiations on the sovereignty of the Falkland Islands, over which
they fought a 74-day war in 1982.
   The vote in the 159-member assembly was 109-5 with 37
abstentions. Last year it was 114-5 with 36 abstentions.
   Britain, which won the war by driving an Argentine invasion force
out of the South Atlantic archipelago, cast its customary vote
against the resolution but the United States voted in favor.
   Sir Crispen Tickell, the British ambassador, declared during
debate: ``We are not ready to enter into negotiations on all aspects
of the future of the Falkland Islands. That would mean the beginning
of negotiations which would represent the method by which Argentina
would recover sovereignty.''
   ``The British government will continue to uphold the right of the
Falkland Islanders to self determination,'' he said, but ``that does
not mean there is nothing else to talk about.''
   Tickell cited fishing as a possible area of agreement with
Argentina, which calls the islands the Malvinas and claims to have
inherited the archipelago from Spain in 1810. Britain has ruled the
islands since 1833.
   About 1,000 men were lost on both sides in the war, most of them
when the British sank the Argentine cruise General Belgrano.
Argentina has not yet declared a formal end to hostilities and
diplomatic relations have not been restored.
   About 2,000 people live on the islands. Most are fishermen or
raise sheep.

   Lion tamer Gunther Gebel-Williams said Thursday
he plans to retire from the Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey
Circus, where he has been riding elephants and subduing Bengals for
the past two decades.
   Dressed in blue sequined tights and jacket, the trim, blond
Gebel-Williams, 54, said he wanted to retire ``while I'm still on
top.''
   He said he would tour with ``The Greatest Show on Earth'' for two
more years before retiring at the end of the 1990 season.
   ``Tiger training is like race car driving, like boxing. You have
to be really on top all the time. It's not possible to feel not so
good one day. ... There has to be the time to say, that's it,''
Gebel-Williams said in a thick, German accent flanked by a
40-year-old elephant, Nellie.
   Ringling Bros. President Kenneth Feld said he plans to replace
Gebel-Williams with eight to 10 people doing various parts of the
many animal acts Gebel-Williams now performs alone.
   ``It's the most difficult thing I've ever had to deal with,''
Feld said. ``Once in a lifetime there's a Gunther Gebel-Williams.''
   Gebel-Williams was born in the German town of Schweidnitz, which
is now a part of Poland, and was 12 years old when his widowed
mother was hired by Circus Williams as a wardrobe seamstress.
   He soon began working with animals and became a master showman at
age 16. He took over the business after owner Harry Williams died
and, in 1968, caught the eye of Feld's father, circus producer Irvin
Feld.
   Irvin Feld wanted to hire Gebel-Williams to create a second
touring unit of his circus. He bought the entire German troupe for
$2 million when Gebel-Williams refused to leave it.
   Gebel-Williams has remained in the center ring since, becoming
famous for his flashy showmanship, his flowing gold hair and his
taming of tigers, elephants, horses, giraffes and other animals.
   His body is covered with scars _ bearing more than 500 stitches
at last count. When asked about them at a news conference,
Gebel-Williams quickly flung off his jacket, unbuttoned his shirt
and rolled up his sleeves to show evidence of several near-fatal
scrapes.
   True danger lurks with the elephants, not lions and tigers,
because they are not housed in cages and they can easily snap most
chains, he said.
   ``A tiger's in a cage, a horse is on a chain. It's much easier to
deal with them. But elephants are loose all the time,'' he said.
``And they have strong personalities. They get jealous. My wife can
never come close to one of them.''

<TEXT>
   A Chilean envoy on Thursday
attacked a human rights report that accuses his country's military
of burning two civilians with gasoline and questions Chile's
progress toward democracy.
   The report by the Inter-American Human Rights Commission focuses
on human rights abuses in Latin America and also singles out Cuba,
El Salvador, Guatemala, Nicaragua and Paraguay.
   Delegates of 31 nations in the Organization of American States
received the report during their meeting Wednesday in San Salvador.
   The commission declared the Chilean government of Gen. Augusto
Pinochet ``responsible for the death of Rodrigo Rojas and grave
injuries of Carmen Gloria Quintana when they were burned by a
military patrol in July 1986.''
   According to the report, the soldiers doused the pair with
gasoline, set them on fire, and left them at the roadside.
   The military said the two were throwing firebombs. But human
rights groups and relatives of Ms. Quintana and Rojas said they were
innocent bystanders. The case has attracted international attention.
   The report also said Pinochet's defeat in a yes-or-no
presidential referendum on Oct. 5 represented ``a positive fact.''
However, it said the loss ``does not imply the installment of an
authentic democratic system.''
   Pinochet, who came to power in a September 1973 coup, lost his
bid to extend his presidency until 1997. The opposition is calling
for early elections to end military rule.
   Chile's OAS Ambassador, Javier Illanes, said the commission had
not given Chile credit for trying to end abuses.
   ``It seems to us the commission was only interested in negative
aspects and didn't give importance to the progress of democracy,''
he said.
   The report also criticized communist-ruled Cuba, where it said
political prisoners received long sentences under harsh prison
conditions. There was no immediate reaction from Cuban officials.
   In El Salvador, the report found ``an increase in the activities
of the so-called death squads'' that stalk victims for political
ends.
   However, Benjamin Cestoni, president of the Salvadoran
government's human rights commission, said Thursday the report was
unfair because it failed to reflect ``the damage from terrorist
groups.''
   El Salvador has been using U.S. support to fight a nine-year
civil war against leftist guerrillas.
   In Nicaragua, the commission reported ``advances, although
precarious'' stemming from a March cease-fire pact between the
leftist Sandinista government and U.S.-backed rebels who fought for
seven years.
   But the commission criticized the Sandinistas for repression of
an opposition demonstration in July and ``serious violations of the
rights'' of several opposition activists.
   Deputy Foreign Minister Victor Hugo Tinoco of Nicaragua said his
government was satisfied because the report reflected the
difficulties imposed by the civil war.
   The OAS General Assembly will vote Saturday on whether to accept
the report.
   Sonia Sgambatti, president of the group's Inter-American
Commission for the Control of Drug Abuse, also told delegates to the
conference Thursday that drugs are the biggest criminal problem in
the history of the Western Hemisphere.
   She credited several nations, including the United States,
Colombia, Bolivia and Mexico, for their anti-drug efforts during the
past year.
   Sgambatti also called for quicker extradition of drug suspects
among member nations.

   Prime Minister Brian Mulroney desperately needs
to sweep his native province of Quebec to win a majority government
Monday and preserve the free trade agreement he signed with
President Reagan.
   Pressed hard by opposition allegations that he sold Canada out,
Mulroney has promoted the deal as the ``passport to prosperity,'' an
``instrument of economic expansion.''
   He tells crowds the choice is a simple one between ``John the
Ripper'' _ Liberal Party leader John Turner _ and ``Brian the
Builder.''
   Mulroney strives to portray Turner as an anti-American who
opposes progress, and points to the prosperity of his four years in
office.
   ``The cause of my life is to build a nation,'' he says.
   Ed Broadbent, leader of the socialist New Democratic Party, said
Reagan's remarks Thursday about the free trade agreement will hurt
Mulroney.
   ``It will remind every Canadian how close Brian Mulroney is to
Ronald Reagan,'' said Broadbent, whose party is expected to finish
third. ``It will remind every Canadian the Americans got virtually
everything they wanted in this deal.''
   Reagan said in a speech to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce in
Washington: ``As far as the United States is concerned, the Free
Trade Agreement is an example of cooperation at its best. It is a
testament to the commitment of our two governments to the principles
of the open market and to economic cooperation.''
   Opponents of the agreement had said the Reagan speech could be
interpreted as interference in Canadian affairs.
   Mulroney's Progressive Conservative Party must win 148 of the 295
seats to ensure the agreement takes effect Jan. 1, eliminating
tariffs between the world's two largest trading partners over a
10-year period.
   It has been approved by Congress but has yet to be considered by
Parliament.
   Quebec has 75 seats in the House of Commons, second only as a
bloc to the 99 seats of Ontario, where opposition is stronger.
   The free trade debate has dominated the campaign since Mulroney
dissolved Parliament on Oct. 1.
   At the time, he appeared headed for an easy victory. The
Liberals, long a dominant force in Canadian politics, had sagged to
what seemed to be a battle with the New Democrats for runner-up
status.
   But in a matter of weeks, Turner's persistent attacks on the free
trade agreement as a threat to Canadian sovereignty and identity
have revived his chances. Polls indicate that more Canadians oppose
the agreement than support it.
   The polls also put the Liberals and Progressive Conservatives in
a dead heat.
   Support for free trade has been strongest in French-speaking
Quebec, secure in its cultural identity, but Turner has by no means
conceded the province.
   The opposition leader was in Montreal on Wednesday night and
charged the prime minister is willing to sacrifice textile workers,
garment workers, food workers and farmers ``on the altar of free
trade.''
   At Mulroney's major campaign rally Wednesday night in a working
class district of East Montreal, protesters' signs read: ``Mulroney
for Governor of the 51st State'' and ``Canada for the Canadians.''
   The prime minister responded with the shout that the pact ``is
good for Quebec, and it is good for Canada!''
   Mulroney is expected to do well throughout rural Quebec. Because
of its strong cultural identity, there is little reason to fear the
pact could bring in an overwhelming U.S. presence.
   The province also has a strong entrepreneurial bent that has
helped fuel prosperity in the 1980s. Quebec's prime minister, Robert
Bourassa, is a leading supporter of the free trade agreement even
though he is a Liberal.
   But polls indicate Montreal will be more hotly contested that the
rest of the province.
   During his campaign, Mulroney has spoken of the 175,000 new jobs
in Montreal since his landslide victory in 1984, 345,000 new jobs in
the province, and 1.3 million new jobs across Canada.
   Mulroney comes from a working class background in Baie-Comeau on
Quebec's north shore. He is the first French-speaking Quebecer to
lead the Conservative Party and is greeted here with shouts of
``Brian, Brian!''
   Turner scored points in the French-language debate with his
unexpectedly strong attack on the free trade agreement, but Mulroney
speaks French with a fluency his rivals can't match.
   He jokes with the crowds and moves about with ease, and he
dismisses as ``scare mongering'' anti-free trade people who say the
agreement will cost Canada too much.
   Mulroney and other supporters maintain Canada is mature enough to
compete efficiently with its powerful southern neighbor.
   The prime minister will spend the weekend on a final campaign
swing through Quebec, ending up in Baie-Comeaue for election day.

   The Justice Department announced Thursday that
two people have been indicted and 10 others accused of illegally
importing and distributing unapproved drugs for animals.
   As part of the investigation, which began in 1984, the government
also seized more than 30 tons of allegedly adulterated and
misbranded animal drugs valued at more than $600,000. The seizures
occurred in Rushville, Ill., and Omaha, Neb.
   The drugs were for distribution to veterinarians, farm supply
outlets and farmers throughout the country.
   A 25-count indictment against Heinz G. Dall of Ossining, N.Y.,
and Robert M. Clack of Pittsfield, Ill., accuses them of illegally
importing and distributing animal drugs and drug products in
violation of the animal drug provisions of the federal Food, Drug
and Cosmetic Act. A federal grand jury in Cedar Rapids, Iowa,
returned the indictment Wednesday.
   The indictment alleges that from May 1983 to October 1988, Dall,
Clack and others conspired to illegally import drugs intended for
animal use into the United States from Canada in violation of
customs laws and the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act.
   The indictment alleges that neither Clack nor Dall were
authorized to receive or to distribute the drugs because neither
they nor wholesalers who bought their drugs held government-approved
new animal drug applications as required by federal law.
   The Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act requires that all drugs intended
for use in animals have an approved new animal drug application
prior to U.S. marketing.
   On Thursday, the government filed a three-count felony
information against Jeffrey A. Engel of Omaha, Neb., the former
president and general manager of the now-defunct Custom Feed
Blenders of Fort Dodge, Iowa.
   Engel is charged with conspiring to violate customs laws and the
Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, using false statements and practices to
import merchandise and failing to register a drug manufacturing
facility.
   The government this week also filed misdemeanor informations in
Omaha, Neb., against Dana Wolf, Timothy Hoffman and International
Manufacturing and Sales, all of Omaha; ZetaPharm Corp. of New York,
N.Y.; Ronald Nissen and Rex Blunk, both of Fort Dodge, Iowa; and Wes
Thoreson of Jewel, Iowa. In Cedar Rapids, Iowa, the government filed
charges against Lawrence Tipton and James Rhodes, both of Fort
Dodge, Iowa, and against Gregory and Bradley Langmo, both of
Litchfield, Minn.

   Diabetics who are able to control their
blood-sugar levels well are much more likely to keep their eyesight
than those whose levels are poorly controlled, a study to be
published Friday suggests.
   Thousands of people with diabetes go blind each year because of a
condition linked to the disease called retinopathy, in which tiny
blood vessels at the back of the eye break and bleed, usually
painlessly and over a period of years.
   The condition afflicts both people who get diabetes as adults and
those who get it at younger ages, say researchers at the University
of Wisconsin, who studied both groups over a four-year interval.
More than 1,800 diabetics participated in the study.
   The researchers used blood sugar-levels to divide subjects into
four categories and found that those in the highest-level category
developed signs of retinopathy almost twice as often as subjects in
the lowest category.
   This was true of all subjects taking insulin, whether they got
the disease before or after age 30, the researchers reported in
Friday's Journal of the American Medical Association.
   Insulin, usually administered by injection, helps the body use
sugar and other carbohydrates.
   Older-onset diabetics _ those developing the disease at or over
age 30 _ who were not taking insulin showed an even greater
disparity, with retinopathy appearing four times as often among the
highest blood-sugar category compared with the lowest, the
researchers found.
   Dr. Barbara E.K. Klein, professor of ophthalmology and a
co-author of the study, said Thursday, ``It suggests that ...
(non-hospitalized) people with higher levels are at higher risk.''
   But the study is too preliminary to use as a basis for changing
the way people manage blood-sugar levels, because tighter controls
can lead to serious medical complications, she said.
   Still, the findings suggest that even a modest improvement of
blood sugar control ``may reduce the incidence of proliferative
(advancing) retinopathy signficantly,'' they said.
   For example, the four-year risk of developing advancing
retinopathy among people with an 11 percent reading for glycosylated
hemoglobin, a blood-sugar test, was estimated to be roughly double
that of people with a reading of 9 percent, they said.
   Regardless of blood-sugar levels, 59 percent of the younger-onset
diabetics developed some signs of retinopathy over the four-year
period, the researchers said. In the older-onset group taking
insulin, the rate was 47.4 percent. In the older-onset group not
taking insulin, the rate was 34.4 percent, the researchers said.
   In an editorial accompanying the study, Drs. Michael P. Stern and
Steven M. Haffner of the University of Texas Health Science Center
at San Antonio, said the new findings provide persuasive evidence
that blood-sugar control is positively associated with the risk of
developing initial or advancing retinopathy.

   A landlady suspected of killing seven
elderly tenants at her boardinghouse to collect their Social
Security money said Thursday she had cashed some checks but was no
killer.
   Dorothea Montalvo Puente, who vanished Saturday after police
unearthed the first body buried in her yard, was arraigned Thursday
but did not enter a plea.
   Clad in an orange jail jumpsuit, Puente listened quietly as the
charge of one murder count was read and nodded her head to indicate
she wanted a public defender to represent her.
   Assistant District Attorney Dan Kinter said additional murder
charges and special circumstances would be filed. Special
circumstances mean the penalty upon conviction could be death or
life in prison without possibility of parole.
   The case was continued until Dec. 15 and she was ordered held in
jail without bail.
   Puente, 59, was arrested at a downtown Los Angeles motel late
Wednesday after a pensioner she had approached in a bar became
suspicious.
   Assistant public defenders Kevin Clymo and Peter Vlautin,
surrounded by dozens of reporters outside the courtroom, questioned
the propriety of an interview Puente gave KCRA-TV while the jet
leased by the station was taking her and police back to Sacramento
early Thursday.
   ``I have not killed anyone. I told you that. I have not killed
anyone. The checks I cashed, yes,'' Puente told KCRA-TV reporter
Mike Boyd.
   Boyd said he didn't ask specific questions about the murders, but
only talked with Puente about general subjects. She also told Boyd,
``I used to be a very good person at one time.''
   ``It's unheard of that a law enforcement agency would team up
with a news organization to transport a person to jail,'' Vlautin
said.
   Puente was put on the jet with detectives and the television crew
with ``no opportunity to talk to anybody who had her interests in
mind,'' Clymo said. ``...At this time, I do not believe she was
given an opportunity to talk to a lawyer (before the flight).''
   ``Our client denies killing anybody. The true facts will come out
in the courtroom,'' said Vlautin. ``The Sacramento Police Department
has enlisted the aid of the media to create a circus atmosphere.''
   Police Chief John Kearns said he did not learn about the jet
arrangements until Thursday morning.
   The matronly ex-convict walked away from her boarding house
Saturday morning, after the first body was unearthed by officers.
   At that time, police said they didn't have enough evidence to
detain her. But after the other bodies were discovered, a murder
warrant was issued for Puente and a search launched in California,
Nevada and Mexico.
   Police Chief John Kearns said she apparently went to West
Sacramento on Saturday, then took a cab to Stockton, where she
boarded a bus for Los Angeles ``and has probably been there since
that time.''
   Puente was arrested after CBS television told Los Angeles police
that a viewer called to report meeting her in a downtown bar. She
had given the man the name and room number of the motel where she
was staying, and police arrested her there a few minutes later.
   ``The suspect had struck up a conversation with a male subject in
a bar. They had been talking about Social Security,'' Kearns said.
The two went to her nearby motel room and ``during the time he was
talking to her, he realized it was the murder suspect he had seen on
television.''
   ``She was real cool, real calm. It looked like she almost
expected it,'' Sgt. Paul Von Lutzow said.
   The man, Charles Willgues, 67, said he became suspicious after
Puente, who called herself Donna Johanson, quizzed him about his
Social Security benefits.
   ``She seemed so nice and sincere. She really was very
believable,'' Willgues said. ``She told me she needed her shoe
fixed, and if I knew where I could get that done. That's how our
conversation got started.''
   Willgues, who receives Social Security and other disability
benefits because of two strokes and other ailments, said Puente
asked him where he got his money and then suggested that they share
an apartment.
   ``She made a whole lot of talk about those checks,'' Willgues
said.
   ``I kept looking at the woman. Something just didn't seem right.
I felt like I had seen her before,'' Willgues added, explaining why
he called the television network.
   Los Angeles police searched the motel room but found only three
dresses, said Detective Jim Turner.
   The arrest warrant charges Puente only with the murder of Alvaro
Montoya, 52, a tenant missing from her boardinghouse, but police
Sgt. Bob Burns earlier called Puente a suspect in the killing of all
seven people buried in her yard. None of the seven have been
positively identified.
   The disappearance of Montoya, a mentally disabled transient, led
a counselor with Volunteers of America to contact police, leading to
the diggings.
   Police believe Puente killed tenants of her eight-bedroom
boardinghouse for their Social Security benefits. They have a list
of two dozen people who are missing and who might have lived there
at one time or another.
   Puente has a criminal record dating to a 1948 conviction for
forging checks. She served 2{ years in state prison in the 1980s for
drugging and robbing three men she met in a Sacramento bar, and she
is still on parole for a separate federal forgery conviction.

   Snow hit Utah hard Thursday as another in a series of storms to
cross the western United States dumped up to 9 inches in some
regions.
   Snow warnings and advisories were in effect in portions of
Wyoming, Colorado, Idaho, Montana, Nevada and Oregon.
   The storm that brought heavy snow to parts of the West earlier in
the week was producing rain along the Atlantic Coast on Thursday.
Showers and isolated thunderstorms extended from New England to
coastal North Carolina.
   There were numerous reports of small tornadoes and waterspouts
over the northern beaches and Currituck Sound of North Carolina. A
small tornado was reported at Point Harbor. A trailer was blown over
and several buildings were unroofed.
   Sunny skies prevailed across much of the rest of the nation east
of the Mississippi River.
   Low pressure centered over southern James Bay in Canada continued
to produce strong and gusty winds in the Great Lakes region. Gale
warnings were in effect in the afternoon for Lakes Huron, Erie and
Ontario.
   Unseasonably warm weather prevailed ahead of the cold front
crossing the Atlantic Coast region. Temperatures were in the 80s
over the Florida peninsula and in the 70s from northeast Florida to
coastal North Carolina.
   Unseasonably cold temperatures extended across the north central
United States with readings in the teens from northern Montana to
western Minnesota.
   Temperatures around the nation at 2 p.m. EST ranged from 11
degrees at Williston, N.D., to 90 degrees in Fort Myers, Fla.
   The nation's low Thursday morning was -7 at Glasgow, Mont.
   Friday's forecast called for a storm system crossing the central
United States to spread snow from the plateau region across the
northern and central high Plains into Minnesota with heavy snow
expected in the mountains. Rain showers and thunderstorms were to
scatter from the Gulf Coast region to the middle Mississippi Valley
and the central Plains. Fair to partly sunny skies were forecast for
the rest of the nation. Windy conditions were expected over the
southern Rockies.
   Temperatures were expected to remain below 40 degrees from
northern Arizona and the northern and central plateau region to
Upper Michigan and across northern Maine with subfreezing
temperatures over Montana, Wyoming and North Dakota. Warmer
temperatures were expected into the 60s in Southern California and
into the 60s and 70s from the Rio Grande Valley of Texas through the
lower Mississippi Valley to the southern Atlantic Coast with highs
in the 80s over extreme southern Texas and the Florida peninsula.

   President-elect George Bush said Thursday he
will hold a pre-inaugural visit with Mexico's incoming president and
promised not to take unilateral actions on issues affecting that
country's well-being.
   Bush made the pledge in a letter he sent to the Bilateral
Commission on the Future of United States-Mexican Relations, which
issued a report containing a series of recommendations on solving
cross-border problems.
   Bush's deputy national security adviser, Col. Sam Watson,
presented the letter to commission members on receiving a copy of
the 238-page report. The commission, comprised of prominent Mexican
and U.S. citizens, spent two years preparing the report.
   Among other recommendations, the report said unilateral measures
must be avoided on issues affecting the two countries.
   ``I fully agree that two new administrations taking office at
about the same time gives us tremendous opportunities to work
together,'' Bush said in the letter.
   ``One hallmark of my administration will be close consultations
and a bilateral approach to problem-solving. Your report will be of
great use in the future _ the effort was well worth it.''
   At a news conference earlier, Bush appeared taken aback when
asked about reports he will hold a get-acquainted meeting Tuesday in
Houston with his Mexican counterpart, Carlos Salinas de Gortari, who
will take office Dec. 1.
   He stopped short of confirming the encounter would take place but
said that any such meeting ``would symbolize the importance he
places on relations with ``our front yard ... neighbors.''
   But Bush then quickly launched into an explanation of what he
hopes to accomplish from such an early get-together.
   ``When and if such a meeting is announced, I will address myself
to the question,'' Bush told reporters. ``But, if I were to have a
meeting with the incoming president of Mexico before he is sworn in
on Dec. 1 while I am still in transition, it would be to symbolize
the importance I place on the relationship with Mexico.''
   Bush added, ``I know something about that relationship and I have
met with his two predecessors.''
   ``If such a meeting takes place it will symbolize ... the
importance of our front yard, our neighbors,'' he said.
   The vice president's office late Thursday night confirmed that
Bush and Salinas would meet and have lunch at the Johnson Space
Center in Houston next week.
   ``Their meeting symbolizes the close relationship of our two
countries and the vice president's high respect for Mexico. It is
intended to further develop a close consultative relationship and a
bilateral approach to problem solving,'' said Bush spokesman Steve
Hart.
   Salinas' victory in the July 6 election was clouded. Only on
Wednesday did the main opposition party, the conservative National
Action Party, end its fight to overturn the results.
   The opposition still maintained that Salinas' party, the ruling
Institutional Revolutionary Party, won as a result of fraud. The
ruling party has not lost a presidential election since its founding
in 1929.
   Bush made the comment during a meeting with reporters to announce
his selection of John Sununu as chief of staff. He such a meeting
with Salinas would not be official.
   ``I am not going to try to act like a president before Jan. 20th
and take over the foreign affairs responsibilities from this
president,'' he said. ``I don't want to do that.''
   But he added it would ``a simpler thing'' to work out such a
meeting now ``before we are both sworn in.'' Salinas is to be begin
his term Dec. 1.
   Bush will reportedly stop in Point Clear, Ark., to speak at a
Republican governors' meeting Tuesday before heading to Houston. He
is planning to depart from Washington Wednesday for a Thanksgiving
holiday stay at his oceanfront home in Kennebunkport, Maine.

   A Foreign Office spokesman said Thursday night that
Britain expelled three members of the Iraqi Embassy in London for
activities incompatible with their status, a diplomatic expression
for spying.
   Iraq retaliated by expelling three member of the British Embassy
in Baghdad and the three Britons have returned home, he said.
   The spokesman, who in accordance with British practice refused to
let his name be used, said the Iraqis were told on Oct. 18 they must
leave and were given two weeks to do so. ``I believe they have
left,'' he said.
   No immediate explanation was offered as to why the announcement
of the expulsions was delayed until Thursday night, 16 days after
the Nov. 1 expiration of the time limit set for the departure of the
three Iraqis.
   The spokesman identified the three expelled Iraqis as Abdul
Hassain S. Jbara, an assistant press counselor; Ghassan Mohammed
Shagir, a third secretary; and Samir Karim Hussain Mahdi, the
chauffeur of Ambassador Mohammed Sadiq Al-Mashat.
   He identified the three Britons expelled from Iraq as Charles
Hollis, a second secretary; Simon Elvy, a visa officer; and John
Barton, a security officer. He said all three had been exactly what
they purported to be, namely diplomats.
   There was no immediate reaction from Iraqi authorities to the
Foreign Office announcement.
   Relations between the two governments have been unmarked by any
recent upsets. Earlier this year, Iraqi President Saddam Hussein
thanked Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher for Britain's support for a
plan sponsored by the United Nations that resulted in the present
cease-fire in the war between Iraq and Iran.

<HEAD>Bush Pledges To Use Leadership to Leave Earth a Better Place</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Vice President George Bush pledged Thursday
night that his new administration will seek to leave a planet Earth
``in better shape than we found it.''
   The president-elect, in a toast at the centennial banquet of the
National Geographic Society, said, ``The only path to a cleaner,
safer planet is global cooperation on the environment.''
   ``The plain fact is many of the problems we face in the
environment _ global warming, ocean pollution, acid rain _ are
international in nature,'' Bush told 1500 people at the black tie
banquet.
   ``I plan to use America's leadership in the world as a force for
leaving the planet in better shape than we found it.''
   The society, publisher of National Geographic magazine, producer
of television specials and sponsor of far-flung explorations,
presented centennial awards to 15 famous honorees, including
astronaut and senator John Glenn of Ohio, mountain climber Sir
Edmund Hilliary, underwater explorer Jacques-Yves Cousteau and
anthropologists Mary and Richard Leakey. Each honoree also received
$10,000.
   The award winners issued a joint plea to do more to ``save this
fragile Earth.''
   Bush said he shares the society's concerns about education and
the environment.
   ``Other cultures don't always see the world as we do and their
needs and their attitudes are differnt...,'' he said.
   ``I support wholeheartedly the National Geographic's efforts to
teach America about the world around us.''
   He said the society has brought ``to armchair explorers the
wonders of distant discoveries, exotic customs, breathtaking natural
sights.''
   ``The Geographic's love of the planet Earth just leaps from every
page. That little yellow-bordered magazine is truly a window on our
world.''

   More than 10,000 people marched in
sub-freezing weather to protest the resignations Thursday of the
Kosovo Communist Party president and another top official in this
restive province.
   It was believed to be the biggest protest in Kosovo since bloody
riots in 1981.
   Some estimates put the crowd at 20,000.
   Kacusa Jasari, president of the Kosovo Communist party, and Azem
Vlasi, her predecessor and a member of the powerful party presidium,
announced their resignations at a meeting of the provincial
Communist leadership Thursday.
   The presidium approved both resignations, the state Tanjug news
agency reported. It said Remzi Koljgeci, also an ethnic Albanian,
would act as president until the next session. No date was given.
   The two ethnic Albanian leaders were the main target of
resignation demands by Slobodan Milosevic, Communist Party chief of
the Serbian republic, in his drive to bring Kosovo under tighter
Serbian control.
   Protesters marched through Pristina, Kosovo's capital, chanting
support for Jasari and Vlasi and bearing portraits of the late
President Jozip Broz Tito.
   They chanted ``Unity! Fraternity!,'' ``Long live Kacusa
Jasari!,'' ``We shall not yield Azem Vlasi!'' and slogans against
Milosevic.
   Jasari and Vlasi addressed protesters packed into a sports hall,
reassuring them the two would stay in the top leadership and
appealing for peace.
   Jasari said she would step down as head of the 13-member Kosovo
presidium, but would remain a member of the body, Tanjug reported.
   Vlasi announced his resignation from the Kosovo presidium in
compliance with a recent decision of the federal party presidium
prohibiting its Central Committee members from simultaneously
holding membership in local party bodies, Tanjug said. Vlasi is on
the national party Central Committee.
   The resignations brought to seven the number of top Kosovo party
leaders who said they were stepping down after Serbian and
provincial Communist leaders clashed at a meeting this month over
Serbian demands for a purge of Kosovo's ruling elite.
   Milosevic has been backed by rallies attended by hundreds of
thousands of Serbs in recent months.
   Slavs in Kosovo claim they are being harassed and forced to
emigrate by the ethnic Albanian majority.
   Although administratively part of Serbia, Kosovo enjoys wide
autonomy under Yugoslavia's 1974 constitution, which was adopted
under Tito and created a loose confederation of six republics and
two provinces.
   The constitution is seen by many as a main cause of Yugoslavia's
present ethnic and economic woes, since it leaves central power weak.
   The march and a demonstration Thursday by about 4,000 miners
indicated the Kosovo party leadership enjoys wide support among
ethnic Albanians who make up about 90 percent of Kosovo's
population. The miners marched to Pristina from the Titova Mitrovica
lead mines, 31 miles away, to protest the resignations.
   Milosevic's supporters have repeatedly claimed the Kosovo party
leadership lacks majority support.
   They said the provincial leadership could not cope with Albanian
nationalism left simmering since 1981, when ethnic clashes left at
least nine people dead.
   According to Tanjug, windows were shattered at the offices of the
Belgrade-based daily Vecernje Novosti, but no other incidents were
reported.
   By about 10 p.m., most of the crowd had dispersed.
   In another development Thursday, workers of the country's major
cotton yarn manufacturer Djuro Salaj of Mostar, in western
Yugoslavia, walked out demanding a 60 percent pay increase, Tanjug
reported.
   The plant employs about 6,000 workers. Average monthly salary for
a worker is about $61.

<TEXT>
   Students at Meadowdale High School thought a
classmate was the Crown Prince of Morocco until police learned that
the sporty red car he drove was stolen and he didn't have his royal
father's telephone number to call for help.
   Michael W. Taylor, 28, of Louisville, Ky., was in
Dayton-Montgomery County Jail after being charged Wednesday in Ohio
with receiving stolen property. A Kentucky grand jury on Thursday
indicted him on two counts of theft by deception.
   Students say the flashy foreign-exchange student they knew as
17-year-old Prince Sparkle Shannon dressed in the latest fashions
and wore gold jewelry around his neck and a diamond ring. He spurned
school buses in favor of a red 1988 Dodge Daytona car and reportedly
once rented a chauffeured limousine to take him to a Meadowdale
football game.
   ``I can't believe it,'' said freshman Shamika Bohanon. ``He could
dress. It seemed like he had on a different pair of shoes every
day.''
   Taylor was the subject of an article in the school newspaper, and
during a recent lecture for the student leadership club told
students he would inherit the Moroccan throne when King Hassan II
died. He also told students he had studied with the KGB in the
Soviet Union last year, school officials said.
   But the royal act began to unravel Monday when Madison Township
police detective Rick Wright spotted Taylor's car, which was bearing
Kentucky license plates, in the school parking lot. He ran a check
and learned it had been stolen.
   Wright said he and other police officers waited until Taylor got
into the car with a female companion and then stopped the vehicle.
   ``Do you know who that is?'' Wright said the girl told the
officers. ``That's the prince of Morocco.''
   Wright said at that point school officials and security guards
confronted them.
   ``That kid is the prince of Morocco,'' Wright quoted one school
official as saying. ``What are you going to do to him? You're going
to start an international incident right here in our parking lot.''
   Wright said he took Taylor into the school and found that he knew
the capital of Morocco, the name of the prime minister and even the
date of the country's independence day. But the officer said Taylor
had no passport or immigration card.
   ``He was talking in a very Middle Eastern accent,'' Wright
recalled. He quoted Taylor as telling school officials: ``You mean
to tell me you let murderers go free in this country, and you're
going to let them lock me up for this?''
   Wright said he then asked Taylor to call his father on the
telephone.
   ``The king?'' Taylor asked.
   Wright said he took Taylor into custody after he said he left his
father's phone number at home.
   Montgomery County sheriff's detective Bob Weaver said Taylor, who
stands about 5 feet, 6 inches and weighs about 110 pounds, told
police his name was Monlay Rashid.
   But Weaver said everything changed when Taylor discovered police
knew his real identity.
   ``He was confronted with that, and basically he finally admitted
to being Michael Taylor,'' Weaver said. ``When we said, more or
less, `the game's over,' that's when he finally lost his Moroccan
accent.''
   Meadowdale Principal Ben Kirby said Taylor asked to enroll at the
high school in September, just days after classes had started.
Taylor told school officials his father wanted him to go to school
in Ohio and that he liked Dayton. He was enrolled as a senior.
   Kirby said he became suspicious when the student's high school
transcripts never arrived. The principal said Taylor had said he had
been staying with a host family by the name of Flagg, but he had no
additional information.
   Louisville police detective Ron Schultz said he arrested Taylor
last May on charges of obtaining a car under false pretenses.
Schultz said at that time Taylor gave his name as Nakita Vandiest
Shepard.
   ``He's nothing but a con artist; all indication is that he is,''
Schultz said. He expects Taylor to face numerous additional charges
in Kentucky.
   The charges Taylor faces in Dayton stem from the theft of a Dodge
Daytona from a Louisville car dealership last spring.
   Taylor could be sentenced to one to two years in prison and fined
up to $5,000 if convicted in Vandalia Municipal Court on the charge
of receiving stolen property. He was being held in the Dayton jail
in lieu of $7,500 cash bond.
   He also could be sentenced to one to five years on each count of
theft by deception.

<HEAD>General Assembly Calls For Namibia's Independence</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER JAMES SPIELMANN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>UNITED NATIONS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The General Assembly on Thursday
overwhelmingly demanded that South Africa grant independence to
South-West Africa regardless of the presence of 50,000 Cuban troops
in neighboring Angola.
   The demand was part of a package of five resolutions that ask for
sanctions to punish South Africa for ruling South-West Africa, also
known as Namibia, and a program to implement the sanctions and press
for independence.
   A procession of 71 speakers came to the podium in debate that ran
from Monday through Thursday to castigate South Africa for occupying
South-West Africa in defiance of U.N. resolutions.
   Not one nation voted against any of the proposals, although the
United States, Western Europe, Japan, Israel, Australia and New
Zealand abstained on some. South Africa was stripped of its voting
rights in the United Nations in 1974.
   U.S. Ambassador Vernon A. Walters said the United States
abstained to maintain its neutrality while mediating peace talks
among South Africa, Cuba and Angola.
   South African, Cuban and Angolan negotiators tentatively agreed
this week during talks in Geneva that the Cubans will leave Angola
and South Africa will allow the United Nations to begin a one-year
independence plan for South-West Africa.
   If their governments ratify the accord, the Namibian idependence
process could begin early in 1989.
   Cuban troops have been in Angola since 1975 to defend that
country's Marxist government from raids by the UNITA rebel movement
_ the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola _ and its
ally, South Africa.
   South Africa has ruled Namibia for 73 years since Germany lost
the former colony during World War I. The League of Nations, the
United Nations' predecessor, subsequently granted South Africa a
mandate to administer Namibia.
   In 1966, the United Nations revoked the mandate. In 1978, the
Security Council passed Resolution 435, a one-year plan to set up a
constituent assembly to adopt a constitution and organize an
independent goverment.
   The resolutions passed Thursday call South Africa's occupation an
``act of aggression'' and demand prisoner-of-war treatment for
captured members of the South-West African People's Organization
(SWAPO), the guerrilla group fighting for independence.
   SWAPO is designated in the resolutions as the ``sole and
authentic representative of the Namibian people.'' For years SWAPO
has held non-voting observer status in the United Nations.
   Walters told the assembly that America objects to that
characterization, and said ``only free and democratic elections .. .
will provide the Namibian people themselves the opportunity to
choose whom they want as their representative.''
   The resolutions also call for mandantory economic sanctions
against South Africa, a step that Britain and the United States have
blocked before in the Security Council by using their veto power.

<DATELINE>HAMBURG, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Chancellor Helmut Kohl said Thursday
that opposition to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization could grow
in Western Europe unless Washington rethinks its plans for
cost-sharing among members.
   Hours after he spoke at Hamburg's City Hall, about 8,000
opponents of NATO marched, fired flares and battled riot police to
bolster their demand that West Germany pull out of the military
alliance.
   Kohl made his comments before an independent 16-nation body of
lawmakers called the North Atlantic Assembly, which has been holding
its annual congress since Sunday. Protesters later fired flares at
the building and clashed with riot police nearby, but the delegates
had already ended the day's session.
   Several people were injured, and at least two demonstrators were
arrested, police said. No reports emerged of fire or damage.
   The marchers, mostly young, carried banners reading ``North
Atlantic Terror Organization,'' ``Get Out of NATO,'' and other
slogans.
   Some demonstrators threw stones at police as they moved in to
make arrests, said a police spokesman, speaking on condition of
anonymity.
   Most demonstrators dispersed, but some remained and clashed with
riot police who were carrying shields and truncheons, witnesses
said. The remaining protesters later fled.
   Kohl told the North Atlantic Assembly that West Germany acts as
host to more than 400,000 allied soldiers on its soil and will
continue to fulfill its NATO obligations.
   But he added, ``We should also not overtax one another and
thereby conjure up the danger that acceptance of the alliance could
be damaged.''
   Kohl, a staunch supporter of the United States, has recently been
emphasizing that West Germans hesitate to accept greater financial
burdens within NATO.
   On Thursday, he broadened that message to include other nations
in the Western European alliance.
   His speech came amid growing sentiment in Washington that NATO
allies in Western Europe should shoulder a greater defense burden.
   West Germans, however, argue that other kinds of national
contributions to NATO should be taken into account. They say they
should get credit for putting up with military hardware and soldiers
on their territory.
   The chancellor ruled out removing NATO short-range nuclear
weapons deployed in West Germany. U.S. officials worry pressure to
scrap the weapons could mount among West Germans who view the Soviet
Union as a decreasing military threat.

   Ray Cave has resigned as editorial director of
Time Inc. after 30 years with the magazine publishing company, Time
editor-in-chief Jason McManus announced Thursday.
   The resignation is effective at year's end.
   Cave has been editorial director, second highest editorial
position in the company, since April 1987.
   Cave, 59, resigned because he did not get assurances from McManus
as to what his role would be over the next six years, a Time Inc.
spokesman Louis J. Slovinsky said.
   Cave was a reporter and editor on the Baltimore Evening Sun
before coming to Time's Sports Illustrated as a reporter in 1959. He
rose to executive editor of the magazine, then transferred to Time
magazine, where he was managing editor from 1977 to September 1985.
His next post was corporate editor of Time Inc., then editorial
director.
   McManus lauded Cave as a striver for excellence who ``shaped our
magazines to be the best.''

   Riot police swung clubs and fired tear gas
Thursday at hundreds of anarchists who hurled sticks and stones at
them outside the U.S. Embassy, witnesses said.
   Police said they made at least 10 arrests. No injuries were
reported.
   The anarchists arrived at the embassy at the conclusion of a
march by 20,000 demonstrators who were marking the 15th anniversary
of a student uprising against the 1967-74 military dictatorship in
Greece.
   The peaceful march started at Polytechnic University, site of the
Nov. 17, 1973 rebellion which was crushed by troops and tanks. It
ended at the fenced embassy compound on Vasillis Sophias Avenue, a
main boulevard, where protesters shouted, ``Americans, murderers of
the people, get out now!''
   After march participants left the embassy area, the anarchists
began to battle police.
   More than 20 young people were killed in the 1973 student
uprising, which is credited with triggering the military regime's
collapse.
   The annual march to the U.S. Embassy reflects a widely held
belief that U.S. support enabled the colonels to remain in power.
   The demonstrators chanted slogans urging Premier Andreas
Papandreou's socialist government to remove four U.S. military bases
that have operated in Greece since the early 1950s.
   The Polytechnic uprising anniversary is generally treated as a
national holiday, with politicans from all parties laying wreaths
beside a sculpture dedicated to the slain youths.
   But this year leading politicians, including Papandreou and
Constantinos Mitsotakis, leader of the main opposition New Democracy
party, did not attend the commemorations.

   A former Navy communications specialist
pleaded innocent Thursday to charges he violated federal espionage
laws by possessing classified documents, authorities said.
   Henry Otto Spade, 24, of Mountain Home, likely did not disclose
information from the two classified documents. The documents, if
released, would pose ``a grave danger to United States security,''
U.S. Attorney Mike Fitzhugh said.
   One document is a cryptographic key card, which gives a list of
codes needed to decipher scrambled communications; no information
was released concerning the second document. Spade was arrested
following a tip to police.
   Spade entered his plea before U.S. District Court Judge H.
Franklin Waters and was released on $25,000 bond.
   Spade could be sentenced to up to 10 years in prison and fined up
to $250,000.
   Spade, who is unemployed, had served as a radioman and a
communications specialist in the U.S. Navy. He was honorably
discharged in April after four years and seven months of service.

   A car containing what authorities
believed were the bodies of four young people missing since last
weekend was found Thursday on the bottom of a murky river, police
said.
   A detour sign on the road incorrectly directs traffic to the dead
end where the accident occurred. A second sign warns of danger ahead.
   The three women and one man, ages 19 and 20, were last seen by
their parents about 7 p.m. Saturday, when they left their hometown
of East Lyme for an evening in New Haven.
   Autopsy reports were pending, but police Lt. James Sorrentino
said it was likely the four victims were the missing young people.
   The car approached an open swing bridge and went into the water
over a barrier blocking the roadway, Sorrentino said. Others said
the bridge, which swings from side to side, had been in an open
position for several years.
   Several news reports, quoting unnamed sources, said no barriers
were in place blocking the road on the night of the accident. A
service station owner said that a wooden barrier normally blocks the
roadway, which was cordoned off by police Thursday.
   ``I have no information either way,'' Sorrentino said. ``I've
been led to believe the barriers were always there.''
   A crane was used to pull the car from the water, while some
family members waited in a police van.
   Police have determined the four spent at least part of Saturday
night drinking illegally at a bar near Yale University, said state
police Detective Andre Trudelle. An employee of the bar told
authorities they left together about 3 a.m. Sunday, Trudelle said.
   The legal drinking age in Connecticut is 21.
   ``They were good kids. I can't picture them being drunk and
driving,'' said Michelle Funaioli, who said she was at a New Haven
bar last Thursday with Michael Gallo, one of the missing.
   The missing women were identified as Jill Sawyer, 19, a student
at the University of Rhode Island; Christy Stevens, 19, a student at
Mohegan Community College in Norwich; and Laura Lagrotteria, 19.
   ``It's horrible. It's the most horrible thing I've ever seen
happen,'' Ms. Funaioli said.
   Police divers found the car submerged in about 15 feet of water
in the Mill River, in a little-traveled, old and industrial part of
the city, just north of the New Haven harbor, police said.
   The bridge has been closed for several years because of roadwork
in the area, business owners said.
   There were no skid marks at the scene, and police said an
investigation would determine if the car was speeding.
   Family and friends described the four former high school buddies
as responsible adults unlikely to take off without telling anyone.
   They were last seen by their parents Saturday evening, when they
left for an evening in New Haven.
   The parents had distributed pictures of the missing and offered a
$25,000 reward.
   Thursday night, about 200 friends and relatives of the victims
packed a Niantic church for a prayer service.
   ``There are no words to take away your pain,'' said Assistant
Pastor Laurie Whinnem Etter. ``The only way to respond is to
celebrate the love and the joy that these friends shared.''

<HEAD>Pinochet Rejects Changes Urged For Transition To Democracy</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Military President Augusto Pinochet firmly
rejected on Thursday opposition calls for constitutional changes
before Chile's return to elected civilian rule in 1990.
   He said the reforms urged by dissidents would ``undermine the
basic structure'' of the constitution .
   Pinochet's lame-duck government had hinted this week at talks
with the opposition that beat him in an Oct. 5 referendum on
extending his rule until 1997.
   In a speech at a luncheon with supporters in Punta Arenas, 1,550
miles south of Santiago, Pinochet said his right-wing government is
prepared for a ``constructive exchange of ideas'' with the
opposition, ``but within the present legislation.''
   ``The opposition, under the pretext of improving the
constitution, aims at the destruction of the new institutionality,''
Pinochet said, referring to the 1980 military-written constitution.
   The text of the speech was carried by the state-run news agency
Orbe.
   Under the constitution, Pinochet's referendum defeat makes an
open presidential election mandatory in December 1989, with Pinochet
handing power over to the winner in March 1990.
   Pinochet has rejected demands for his earlier departure from
power.
   He has ruled since leading a 1973 military coup toppled the
elected government of Marxist President Salvador Allende, who died
during the overthrow.
   After their referendum victory, opposition parties listed
constitutional changes they said were needed for a fast, smooth
transitition to democracy.
   The list included eliminating one article that bans Marxist
parties; changing another that makes one third of the future
36-member senate appointed instead of elected, and reforming the
composition of a military-dominated National Security Council. The
opposition sees this council as a permanent threat to future
civilian government.
   The opposition also wants easier rules and lower quorums for
changing the constitution in the future.
   Pinochet rejected all the demands, one by one.
   ``Opening a space to Communists in the political system means
giving them the faculty to use democracy to destroy democracy,''
Pinochet said.
   He warned he will be ``adamant'' in rejecting that, ``because the
freedom of Chileans cannot be the subject of negotiations or
compromise.''
   He said he cannot accept easing the procedures for future
constitutional amendments, because ``the fundamental charter, which
is the basis of democracy, cannot be left exposed to occasional
political majorities or temporary electoral pacts.''
   Pinochet said that reducing the military presence in the security
council would mean ``again isolating the armed forces'' from the
rest of society.
   ``The armed forces have a professional role, but within the
national reality, not outside it,'' Pinochet said.

<HEAD>Health Official Says Accidental Radioactive Spill Won't Harm Public</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Some 2,000 gallons of radioactive water spilled at
the Pilgrim nuclear power plant, slightly contaminating one worker,
officials said.
   The water overflowed a collection area during a cleanup at the
plant on Wednesday, said plant owner Boston Edison Co.
   The spill occurred at a low-level nuclear waste processing area
at the plant, which is awaiting word from the Nuclear Regulatory
Commission on whether it can begin low-level power testing after a
two-and-a-half-year shutdown.
   ``The Department (of Public Health) found no evidence that any
radioactivity was released beyond the plant fence,'' said a
statement issued Thursday by Dr. Van Dunn, deputy public health
commissioner.
   ``The level of radioactivity spilled was below the levels that
would require notification of the Department of Public Health or the
Nuclear Regulatory Commission,'' the statement said.
   Boston Edison said some of the water seeped from the processing
facility and onto an asphalt lot in the open air.
   Boston Edison said it notified the NRC about the spill.
   Pilgram spokesman John Fidler said the worker's knee touched some
water during the spill cleanup and was washed with soap and water.

<HEAD>Court Says Chop Suey's First U.S. Arrival In SF</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A judge who heard almost as many versions of
the U.S. origins of chop suey as there are characters in the Chinese
alphabet, sampled a a plate piled high with the stuff and on
Thursday issued his ruling.
   San Francisco, of course.
   Municipal Court Judge George T. Choppelas, presiding over a mock
Court of Historical Review and Appeals, ruled the vegetable, meat
and noodle dish described as ``Chinese soul food'' and first made
with ``anything that crawled or moved'' appeared on a Gold Rush-era
San Francisco table about 1850. That was 30 years before it found
its way to New York's Chinatown menus.
   The tongue-in-cheek court has decided other questions such as who
invented spaghetti, where the first martini was mixed and whether
the panic instilled by Orson Welles' 1938 broadcast about a Martian
invasion could happen today.
   Choppelas said his finding was supported by both oral history
handed down through generations of Chinese-American families in
Northern California and a story of its origins with elements of
life-or-death necessity and cunning business wiles.
   The story came from witness Annie Soo, secretary of the San
Francisco-based Chinese Historical Society of America. She testified
that according to family legend, her husband's grandfather was
working at a San Francisco Chinese boardinghouse around 1848 when a
band of drunken, hungry miners unable to find any restaurants open
stormed the rooming house.
   When the house owner said he didn't have any food left, Soo said
one of the miners aimed a gun at his head and threatened him. His
imagination ignited, the owner returned to the kitchen and hastily
assembled a dish of vegetables and discarded meat entrails. Heaped
on a bed of steaming rice, the slap-dash dish was served to an
appreciative group.
   ``That whole group enjoyed it very much,'' Soo said. One of the
miners asked what the dish was called, ``The boardinghouse owner
said, `Oh, chop suey.'''
   Choppelas said the quick-thinking owner not only saved his own
life, but gained some loyal customers.
   Soo's story was supported by Alon Yu of Berkeley, owner and
partner in the China Station restaurant and Imperial Palace and
Tommy Toy's in San Francisco.
   A fourth-generation Californian, Yu said his family came to
Northern California from China during the Gold Rush. Yu said many
frugal Chinese people working in mining towns survived on leftovers
from mine owners and were forced to eat ``whatever crawled or
moved.''
   Chop suey, what Yu called ``Chinese soul food,'' is likely to
have originated from these humble beginnings in California and not
in New York, where large numbers of Chinese later immigrated, he
said.
   Disputing that theory was former New Yorker and publicist Ivan
Cutler, who admitted that he and lawyer Jeff Brown had difficulty
deciding if Cutler was the ``su-or or the suey'' in this culinary
case.
   Chop suey came to New York in the 1850s, Cutler said, when a
visiting Chinese dignitary dined with President Grover Cleveland at
the Waldorf Astoria. Because of a sensitive stomach, the dignitary
declined the American-style feast and instead had his own chefs whip
something up for him _ chop suey.
   Choppelas quipped that New Yorkers like to claim everything good,
but noted, ``They don't call it Waldorf suey.''

<HEAD>U.N. Report Says Afghan Human Rights Situation Improves</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By VICTORIA GRAHAM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   UNITED NATIONS _ A U.N. report said Thursday that the human
rights situation in Afghanstan improved somewhat in
government-controlled areas, but it said acts of terrorism by rebels
increased in the past year.
   The 37-page annual human rights report on Afghanistan said that
while the Geneva Agreements, signed April 14, ``give grounds for
hope, the special rapporteur (the person assigned to prepare the
report) has still not been able to report any improvement in the
human rights situation within the country.
   ``Acts of war are continuing, violations of human rights are at
least as frequent as in the past, affecting particularly the
civilian population and endangering the lives and security of
innocent men, women and children.''
   The rapporteur, Felix Ermacora of Austria, is the special
investigator of the Afghan human rights situation for the U.N. Human
Rights Commission, based in Geneva.
   A similar report last year said the main problem in realizating
human rights there was the presence of more than 100,000 Soviet
troops. Half of them have been withdrawn under U.N.-mediated
agreements signed in Geneva.
   The rest are to be pulled out by Feb. 15, although Moscow has
suspended its withdrawal because of increasing attacks by
U.S.-backed and Pakistan-based rebels.
   The report said, ``In general, there is greater improvement in
the human rights situation in government-controlled areas. However,
allegations of torture and ill-treatment of prisoners on remand
(awaiting trial) and political prisoners are still being received,''
he said. Afghan authorities reject the allegations.
   Ermacora said the number of political prisoners has fallen
sharply as a result of anmnesty decress and other measures under the
Afghan government policy of national reconciliation. Conditions of
detention in Pol-i-Charkhi prison, a major center, have improved, it
said.
   But the investigator also said that after the signing of the
Geneva Agreements, which Afghan rebels rejected, ``acts of terrorism
... have caused many deaths among innocent civilians.''
   ``Terrorism in Afghanistan and Pakistan has multipled,'' since
his report last year, he said.
   The report cited government reports of rebel violence from April
to last August. It said heavy artillery and ground-to-ground
missiles were used against towns and villages, charitable
institutions and mosques. The report cited 4,154 cases of missile
firings and 24 explosions, killing 945 civilians and wounding 1,895,
including 187 children and 98 women.
   It said a rocket attack on Kabul Airport killed nine civilians on
Sept. 1 and wounded 20. On Sept.27, a rocket attack on a Kabul
neighborhood reportedly killed 35 civilians.
   Afghan refugees in Pakistan, it said, still are afraid to return
home, largely because of rebel-planted mines.
   The report said withdrawing Soviet troops had committed human
rights violations and it cited reports of Soviet bombing and
bombardment of civilian areas.
   On March 7, it said, Soviet artillery bombarded residential areas
in the suburbs of Herat, at the end of April migrating nomads were
attacked by Soviet and Afghan troops and houses, schools and mosques
were damaged and destroyed in other Soviet attacks.
   ``Many Afghan villages and houses have been destroyed in the
course of the Soviet troop withdrawal and many civilians have been
killed due to the fighting tactics of the oppostion movements and
acts of retaliation,'' the report said.
   The U.N. report said treatment of prisoners of war violates the
1949 Geneva Conventions. Prisoners are used as a means of barganing
and exchange, it said.
   The whereabouts of at least 313 Soviet soldiers missing in action
is still unknown, it said. The Afghan government considers rebels to
be terrorists and not combatants to be treated in accordance with
international humanitarian law, it said.
   The report said the International Committee of the Red Cross
should be given full access to all prisons and detention centers.

   Millions of smokers on Thursday swapped their cigarettes for
apples and gum, went cold turkey for free turkey sandwiches and
tossed their tobacco into bonfires as part of the 12th annual Great
American Smokeout.
   Newborns in several hospitals wore ``I'm a Born Non-Smoker'' city
workers in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, sported pins and stickers that said,
``Kiss Me, I Don't Smoke; and non-smokers joined ``adopt-a-smoker''
programs to help smokers through a smokeless day.
   The American Cancer Society estimates nearly 40 percent of the
nation's 50 million smokers tried to quit for the day. About
one-tenth, or 2 million people, will kick the habit permanently,
said Paul Rosenberg, a cancer society spokesman in New York.
   ``My grandkids keep telling me it's time to quit smoking,'' said
Pat Zielke, mayor of La Crosse, Wis., and a pack-a-day smoker for 40
years. He quit smoking for the day and was ``adopted'' by a cancer
society volunteer.
   Actor and former smoker Larry Hagman, star of the television show
``Dallas,'' said the smokeout was the day to just quit lighting up.
   ``The key to quitting for good is just quitting. There's no
tapering off, you just have to go cold-turkey,'' said Hagman, who is
honorary chairman of the observance.
   In New York, the cast and crew of Off-Broadway's ``Steel
Magnolias'' went cold turkey.
   ``It's going to curl some of their hair,'' teased non-smoker
Bobby Grayson, hair designer for the play, which is set in a beauty
parlor.
   Smokers traded their cigarettes for apples in several cities,
including New York, Norwalk, Conn., and Philadelphia. Non-smokers
got apples, too, along with a ``good for you.''
   Some hard-core New Yorkers eyed the apples suspiciously. Others
took them to wives, boyfriend or co-workers who smoke. Some, like
Sino Perratore, threw their cigarettes into a waste basket at
Rockefeller Plaza.
   In Hammond, La., pharmacist Don Fellows Jr. burned four cartons
of cigarettes, four boxes of cigars and several boxes of chewing
tobacco in a hibachi outside his store.
   The burning tobacco was all he had left after deciding several
months ago to stop ordering the products and to burn what was left.
   ``I thought I would make a statement; maybe someone would stop
and think and stop smoking cigarettes before it was too late,''
Fellows said.
   A chain of three pharmacies planned a similar tobacco bonfire in
Austin, Texas.
   In Indianapolis and Fort Wayne, Ind., 10-feet-tall cigarettes
were erected downtown, complete with smoke-generating machines. Fire
crews doused the smoldering cigarettes and chopped them into small
pieces.
   In Little Rock, Ark., a 5-foot-tall smoking cigarette was put out
with fire extinguishers by workers at the Baptist Medical System
building. One employee, Lana Campbell, said this is about the third
time she's used the smokeout to try to quit.
   ``You know what they say, if at first you don't succeed,'' said
Ms. Campbell, 27, of North Little Rock.
   The grandson of tobacco magnate R.J. Reynolds joined with
Pleasanton, Calif.-based publisher SyberVision to launch a $20
million television advertising campaign accusing the tobacco
industry of addicting millions of Americans.
   ``My grandfather, R.J. Reynolds, helped get America hooked on
cigarettes through clever advertising. Now, I'm going to use the
power of advertising to get America unhooked,'' Patrick Reynolds
said.
   Thousands of Californians rode aboard the ``Smokeout Express,'' a
train coach on Amtrak's San Diegan, which took a whistlestop
no-smoking journey through Southern California. A pipeless Mr.
Potato Head, the popular toy spud, joined them.
   One California crusader against smoking tried to stuff 143
cigarettes in his mouth at one time to show that smoking is ugly and
hazardous to your health.
   ``I'm showing how ridiculous it looks. Some people smoke this
much in a day or week,'' said Jim Mouth as he prepared to shove the
more than seven packs in his mouth at John's Pipe Shop in Hollywood.
   Businesses and schools in Concord and Bedford, Mass., received
visits from a 6-foot-tall turkey clad in winter garb.
   ``Our turkey is wearing a scarf and a vest and encouraging people
to quit cold turkey,'' said Deb Beatty, a cancer society spokeswoman.
   They were also talking turkey near the Texas Capitol in Austin,
where a sandwich shop gave free 6-inch turkey sandwiches to people
who turned in a half-pack of cigarettes.
   The anti-smoking demonstrations persauded many to try to kick the
habit. Others finally heeded the warnings that smoking causes lung
cancer, heart disease and respiratory disease. The surgeon general
has warned of the potentially fatal risks of smoking and the
addictive properties of nicotine, the drug in cigarettes.
   Eileen Ham, a smoker for 35 years, got the message.
   ``I've been cutting down slowly. I've gone a whole day without
smoking in the last two weeks, and I've cut down to five or six
cigarettes a night,'' she said in Austin. ``I want to quit because
it will make me feel better and it will give me more energy.''
   Still, there's one in every crowd.
   Alan Farnham, a reporter for Fortune magazine in New York,
gathered 40 ``like-minded people'' for a tongue-in-cheek
``smoke-in'' at a Manhattan restaurant.
   ``By reducing stress, tobacco adds years to life,'' Farnham said.
``Galen, the Greek physician, believed tobacco adds years to life.''

<HEAD>Convicted Spy Pollard Calls His Life Sentence Unfair</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Convicted spy Jonathan Pollard says he deserved
to be punished for giving U.S. secrets to Israel, but claims in a
television interview that his life sentence is unfair.
   In an interview to be broadcast on CBS' ``60 Minutes'' Sunday,
Pollard said there was ``no excuse'' for his passing classified
information to Israeli agents in 1985 when he was a civilian
intelligence analyst for the Navy.
   But he said there was ``an explanation.''
   Pollard said he acted for ``soft reasons having to do with a
family that was destroyed in the holocaust. Having to do with the
realization that this government in the 40s had abandoned the Jewish
people to its fate in Europe.''
   ``The hard reason why I did what I did ... (was that U.S. policy)
was fundamentally to place Israel in a position where she would be
forced to make an unenviable choice between a ruinous war or
shameful peace,'' he said.
   The interview took place at the U.S. Bureau of Prison's maximum
security penitentiary in Marion, Ill. in the presence of two U.S.
Naval Intelligence officials.
   Pollard was sentenced to life imprisonment in March 1987 after
pleading guilty to conspiracy to commit espionage.
   His wife, Anne Henderson-Pollard, pleaded guilty to conspiracy to
receive embezzled government property and being an accessory after
the fact to the possession of national defense secrets. She was
sentenced to five years in prison.
   Pollard said he considered his sentence unfair because Israel is
an ally and he did not give it information damaging to U.S.
interests.
   ``My sentence did not reflect proportional justice, it reflected
political vengeance, plain and simple,'' Pollard said.

<HEAD>Women's Abilities Vary with Hormone Levels</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Last graf may be offensive to some readers.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>TORONTO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The ability of women to perform certain tasks
varies with the level of their sex hormones, a study has found.
   The research is believed to be the first linking human
performance to sex hormones.
   The study by Dr. Doreen Kimura of the University of Western
Ontario in London, Ontario, shows women perform significantly better
in verbal fluency and fine-motor muscular control when their
estrogen and progesterone levels are high.
   Kimura's study also showed that women's ability to understand
spatial concepts is enhanced by lower hormone levels.
   The researcher said similar patterns probably occur in men, whose
sex hormone testosterone fluctuates daily.
   Kimura, who spoke Wednesday at a news briefing during the annual
meeting of the Society for Neuroscience, tested 200 women during
their menstrual cycle and post-menopausal women on
estrogen-replacement therapy.
   She compared their spatial cognition and verbal and motor
abilities during times of peak and low hormone levels.
   The levels rise and fall during the course of a woman's menstrual
cycle. The peak estrogen phase begins just before ovulation and
extends until a week to 10 days before menstruation. A drop in
hormone levels occurs during menstruation.
   Spatial tasks which Kimura tested involved identifying a shape in
a complex pattern. Tongue-twisters tested verbal skills, and
fine-motor tasks included rapid changing of hand postures.
   Men generally do better on such spatial problems, but women on
average score better on the verbal and fine-motor tasks.
   In the low-hormone phase, it might take a woman three seconds
longer to repeat a tongue-twister correctly than during her peak
level, the researcher said.
   ``With motor-tasks, women say, `Gosh, I'm really clumsy this
week,''' said Kimura.
   She said her study supports the idea that male-female cognitive
differences are influenced by sex hormones acting on the brain. She
said she is now studying how men's abilities might vary according to
the level of testosterone.
   ``It's easier to identify these things in women, but my guess is
they can happen also in males,'' said Kimura.
   She acknowledged that the study suggests there may be optimal
times for women to perform certain tasks, such as taking
standardized academic examinations.
   ``We really don't know enough yet,'' she said. ``It may be in a
couple of years we'll know enough about it to say there are
significant enough effects that these can be factors in test scores
and performance.''
   Kimura stressed that abilities vary greatly among individual men
and women, with some women better at tasks in which men generally
excel.
   ``There's an enormous overlap in the ability patterns between men
and women,'' she said.
   ``You don't have to look at a person's genitals to decide whether
they're going to be a good air traffic controller. You can give them
a test of spatial ability.''

   An American TV news camerawoman has
died of hepatitis while traveling in Afghanistan to cover the war,
the U.S. Embassy said Thursday.
   Her name was being withheld pending notification of her family,
said a duty officer.
   In New York, CBS spokesman Tom Goodman said the woman was a
free-lancer on assignment for CBS News.
   He said it was not determined immediately whether she worked as a
camera operator, sound person or in some other capacity, ``but she
was obviously a member of a news crew.''
   Afghan guerrilla sources, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said the woman died Tuesday near Jalalabad in eastern Afghanistan as
the rebels tried to get her to Pakistan for medical treatment. Her
body was delivered to the Americans on Thursday in Peshawar,
Pakistan, for shipment home.
   Official Radio Kabul reported that a foreign journalist was
robbed and killed by guerrillas near the same city and on the same
day as the woman.
   There was no confirmation of that report. It was unclear whether
it was the Marxist government's version of the same death.
   Radio Kabul has reported several Americans and other foreigners
killed recently in Afghanistan, allegedly while helping the rebels.
   U.S. officials have described the claims as fabrications. They
deny that any non-embassy U.S. personnel are in Afghanistan.
   The United States and Pakistan support the insurgents in their
struggle to oust the Kabul government and drive out the Soviet
forces who bolster it.
   Moscow has pledged to remove all its troops from Afghanistan by
Feb. 15.

<TEXT>
   The Justice Department is investigating whether
U.S. Attorney Frank L. McNamara Jr. made false statements about his
predecessor when he accused him of smoking marijuana, sources said
Thursday.
   The allegations were rejected by a federal inquiry.
   McNamara had told investigators he saw his predecessor, William
F. Weld, smoking marijuana at a 1982 party in Virginia. But the
report of a 1987 Justice Department probe released Wednesday found
``no evidence whatsoever'' to support the claim.
   Weld later headed the Justice Department's criminal division.
   McNamara issued a two-sentence statement responding to the
report, which was filed in federal appeals court in Washington by
Attorney General Richard Thornburgh.
   ``Upon receiving the report released by the court, I immediately
requested that the Department of Justice conduct a prompt and
thorough investigation to resolve any suggestion of impropriety by
me raised in the report,'' McNamara said.
   ``I will continue to cooperate with the Department of Justice in
every way in order to resolve this matter as quickly as possible,''
he said.
   McNamara's secretary said he was out of his office and
unavailable for comment.
   Justice Department spokesman John Russell declined to comment on
whether McNamara was under investigation.
   But federal law enforcement sources in Washington, speaking on
condition of anonymity, said the Justice Department's Office of
Professional Responsibility was investigating whether McNamara made
false statements about Weld.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney John Markham, who was appointed by Weld
in Boston in April 1985, said McNamara's allegation about Weld was
``just not possible.''
   ``Everybody who has worked with him knows him to be completely
apolitical as a prosecutor and a straight-arrow,'' Markham said in
an interview Thursday.
   President Reagan nominated McNamara to succeed Weld in April
1987, a few months after Weld was appointed to head the Justice
Department's criminal division in Washington.
   An internal Justice Department memo on which Thornburgh's court
filing was based said that after he went to Washington, conflict
developed between Weld and the office of then-Deputy Attorney
General Arnold Burns.
   James Byrnes, a deputy assistant attorney general who was helping
to shepherd McNamara's nomination as U.S. attorney in Boston through
the Senate, told investigators that Burns requested him to call
McNamara to ``dig up some dirt'' on Weld.
   McNamara, who told investigators Weld opposed his nomination and
believed Weld was trying to scuttle it, then told Byrnes that he had
seen Weld drunk on a couple of occasions and had seen him smoking a
``joint'' at a party after a wedding in Virginia in 1982.
   The memo said it is unclear whether Byrnes, who said he had no
specific recollection of briefing Burns, reported back what McNamara
had said.
   Burns and Weld resigned from the Justice Department on March 29
to protest former Attorney General Edwin Meese III's continued
tenure.
   Asked whether he believed Burns had requested officials to ``dig
up dirt,'' Weld said Thursday: ``I've spoken to Arnie and there's no
misunderstanding between us as to the events at the Justice
Department.''
   Weld said his relations with Burns are good. He declined further
comment.
   Burns on Wednesday labeled as ``categorically untrue'' the
allegation that he told Byrnes to call McNamara about Weld.
   The Justice Department memo also said McNamara told the FBI that
he had smoked marijuana as recently as four years ago.

   The government said Thursday that
U.S.-backed rebels kidnapped 11 government officials who were
inspecting hurricane damage in an eastern province.
   A statement from the president's office said rebels abducted the
health, agriculture and finance officials Saturday near Rio Coco
town, about 220 miles northeast of Managua.
   It said the officials were evaluating damage caused by Hurricane
Joan, which struck Nicaragua on Oct. 22.
   The leftist Sandinista government appealed to Honduras for the
safety of the captives. Neighboring Honduras is used as a base by
rebel troops.
   The rebels, known as Contras, made no immediate response to the
government claim.
   The government and rebels signed a cease-fire agreement in March,
but talks on ending the 7-year-old civil war collapsed in September.
Each side accuses the other of truce violations.

   Benazir Bhutto claimed victory today
in Pakistan's first free national elections in more than a decade,
and the 35-year-old U.S.-educated politician was poised to become
the first woman to lead a Moslem nation.
   Ms. Bhutto's populist Pakistan People's Party held a commanding
lead in Wednesday's balloting, and thousands of her supporters
danced in the streets outside her family villa.
   With 190 of 205 districts reporting, Ms. Bhutto's party had a
plurality of 85 seats, and its main rival, the right-wing Islamic
Democratic Alliance, had 50. The rest went to independents and minor
parties that will likely emerge a critical factor in forming a new
government.
   About 30 political parties fielded candidates, but the campaign
boiled down to a race between the People's Party and the nine-party
Alliance, which includes loyalists of the late military strongman
Gen. Mohammad Zia ul-Haq.

was arrested, five days after she disappeared while police searched
her property, officials said today.
   Dorothea Montalvo Puente, 59, was taken into custody Wednesday
night by Los Angeles police who tracked her to a downtown hotel on

   Police believe Puente killed tenants who lived in her Sacramento

   Estonia's parliament struck an
unprecedented blow for independence for the Baltic republics by
declaring sovereignty and the right to veto Soviet laws. Lithuanians
prepared to debate similar action.
   The Kremlin had no immediate reaction to Wednesday's move by
Estonia's Supreme Soviet.
   Estonia's Supreme Soviet passed the declaration of sovereignty by
a 258-1 vote with five abstentions after a day of restrained debate.
Legislators argued that too much Soviet control has ruined the
economy and environment and that Estonia must control its own land,
factories and laws.
   The declaration stopped short of complete independence. But it
called for a treaty with Moscow that would ``determine the further
status of Estonia in the composition of the Soviet Union.'' About
two-thirds of the republic's 1.6 million people are ethnic Estonians.

   For the final state dinner of their eight-year
White House reign, President Reagan and his wife, Nancy, were hosts
of a nostalgic night of song and dance to honor their conservative
friend, British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher.
   Breaking protocol, Mrs. Thatcher and her husband, Denis, dallied
Wednesday after the evening's entertainment and took a turn with the
Reagans about the marbled Grand Foyer to the tune of ``Shall We
Dance?''
   Usually, the honored guests depart posthaste, but the Thatchers
and the Reagans even switched partners as they smiled for the
cameras. ``I wanted this to be special _ it's very sentimental,''
said Mrs. Reagan, who said she got ``a little teary'' during the
effusive round of toasts that the president and prime minister
offered each other earlier in the evening.
   With their 55th state dinner, the Reagans closed the book on one
of their favorite White House events.

   An unprecedented joint appearance by two men
frequently described as the respective ``fathers'' of the Soviet and
American hydrogen bombs featured sharp disagreement on whether
space-based defenses would bring world harmony or nuclear war.
   Andrei Sakharov, the Soviet scientist who has become his nation's
foremost human rights activist, said deploying such a defense system
would ``destabilize the world'' and could trigger nuclear war
between the superpowers.
   Edward Teller, one of the principal American advocates of
deploying the Star Wars defense system, said it could lead to a
``world neighborhood'' of cooperation and peace.
   The two scientists aired their views Wednesday evening at a
banquet honoring Teller as a pioneer in the field of nuclear physics
and for his advocacy of the Strategic Defense Initiative, SDI. It
was sponsored by the Ethics and Public Policy Center, a conservative
research group.

   Justice Department officials have postponed
initial indictments in the massive Pentagon purchasing fraud scandal
while they debate whom to charge first.
   ``We expect action in the very near future but not this week and
probably not next week,'' said Sharon Dibbley, spokeswoman for U.S.
Attorney Henry Hudson in suburban Alexandria, Va., where the more
than 2-year-old investigation is headquartered.
   Last month, Hudson and Justice sources predicted that the first
indictments would be brought by mid-November, but now the best
estimates are that the grand jury will vote on charges either very
late in November or in early December.
   A source at Justice Department headquarters said Wednesday,
``It's still being reviewed here, over legal issues.''

   Social Security benefits to people born before
1917 are higher than Congress intended, but there's no practical way
to fix the inequity, a study concludes.
   Congress should neither reduce benefits to those getting the
unintended windfall nor raise them for everyone else, said the study
released Wednesday by the non-partisan National Academy of Social
Insurance.
   ``I would strongly hope that this issue can be put to rest'' as a
result of the report, said Suzanne Dilk, a former senior analyst
with the Social Security Administration and one of four experts on
the study panel.
   In a related development, lawmakers and lobbyists reacted angrily
to a draft government proposal that would make it harder for the
elderly, disabled and poor to appeal government decisions denying
them welfare or Social Security benefits.

   Severe textbook shortages are undercutting
education in urban school districts nationwide because of higher
book prices, budgetary constraints and a tendency to cut books
before people, educators complain.
   ``One of the things about textbooks is they don't vote and they
don't go out on strike. If you cut personnel, you get screams of
anguish,'' said Harriet Tyson-Bernstein, author of ``A Conspiracy of
Good Intentions: America's Textbook Fiasco,'' a new book highly
critical of the textbook industry.
   A study of 31 schools in five urban districts by the
Washington-based Institute for Educational Leadership, released in
September, found an across-the-board lack of instructional
materials, including textbooks.
   ``In general, the resource situation is pretty bleak. The lack of
supplies in the school systems is pretty obvious,'' said Lisa
Walker, policy resource director for the private, non-profit think
tank. ``This is often an area of the budget where funding is cut.''

<HEAD>A Novel's Glimpse at Miami's Cuban Community</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JACKIE HALLIFAX</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The author of one of the first novels to
give Americans a look into Miami's Cuban community laughs about the
critical success of his work.
   ``I think what's caught the attention probably (is) it's the
first book about Cuban-Americans, the first novel in English that
takes place in Miami,'' Roberto G. Fernandez said in a recent
interview in his office at Florida State University, where he
teaches Latin American literature.
   Fernandez, 37, has three books to his credit _ the first in a
mixture of Spanish and English called ``Spanglish,'' the second in
Spanish, and the third, ``Raining Backwards,'' in English.
   ``One day I was writing and everything was coming out more or
less in English,'' he said. ``And I said, `Let's give it a try and
see what happens.'''
   What happened was a novel that reviewers have compared to the
works of James Joyce, William Burroughs and Jorge Borges.
   ``Sometimes you want to believe it and sometimes you say, `Well,
is it true or what?''' the author said.
   He described ``Raining Backwards'' as a work that looks at how
immigrants cope with their new reality. ``And there's a lot of
fantasy _ not fantasy _ myth-creation.''
   The title comes from a prediction made by one of the novel's
characters, an elderly woman who wants to travel from South Florida
to Cuba in a canoe so she can be buried in her homeland. Once she
lands, she plans to wave a white flag and grab a cab to the
cemetery. Then, she thinks, it will begin to rain backwards.
   ``You create myths to justify yourself in this new environment.
And the myths suddenly become _ I mean you start with a myth and
then you don't know where reality is and where the myth is. So life
has become sort of chaotic. And in a way, I guess, out of that chaos
you make more myths to make ... sense,'' Fernandez said.
   He thinks the themes of ``Raining Backwards'' are universal.
   ``I think everybody fantasizes when you move from one place to
another. It doesn't have to be Cuba. It could be China. It could be
here from to, I don't know, to Nebraska or something.''
   Fernandez, who came to Florida when he was about 10 with his
parents and older brother, spends his summer vacations and holidays
in South Florida, where many of his relatives live. The bulk of
``Raining Backwards'' was written in Miami last summer, but the
ideas came to him in Tallahassee.
   The book has a certain vitality to it, the author said.
   ``I think the book is alive, has spark in it,'' he said. ``Lately
U.S. literature has been a little dry. I mean it's perfect
technically but there's something _ no spark there.''
   Writing ``Raining Backwards'' was fun, according to Fernandez,
who writes in long-hand on legal pads and later transfers his work
to a word processor.
   ``I was laughing,'' he said. ``As a matter of fact, I was living
in that world. I wouldn't go out. They'd say `You like to go out?'
No, I want to go home and write.''
   Fernandez, who thinks he expresses himself better in writing, can
remember writing in school when he first came to the United States
and he couldn't understand what the teacher was saying. Those early
days were sad and bewildering ones for his family.
   ``At the beginning we thought that it was going to be like we
were going to be here for a couple of months and then it would be
for a couple of years and then it's been now like 26 years or
something like that,'' he said.
   ``So at the beginning I mean we just _ I mean you didn't know
what to expect, it was sort of like, more or less scared. You know,
trying to keep a low profile kind of thing,'' he recalled.
   His books, however, are not autobiographical, Fernandez said.
   ``They are a composite of different people that I have seen in
different experiences. And those characters are out there, you know,
if you pay a little attention,'' he said. ``If you pay a little
attention, you hear a lot of outrageous things.''
   And Fernandez doesn't consider himself an exile writer.
   ``Maybe you can say I'm an American writer of Cuban extraction,
writing about the things he knows.''

<TEXT>
   A cultural gap almost kept Maruschka Detmers from
playing a part for which she thought she was destined.
   The Dutch-born actress had read the script for ``Hanna's War,'' a
film based on the true story of a young Hungarian who stood up to
the Nazis, and considered herself perfect for the lead.
   ``I recognized something that was meant for me,'' Detmers said.
``I knew that I was going to do that. I came there totally calm, I
didn't feel I had to convince anybody.''
   Except the director, Menaham Golan (``Over the Top,'' ``The Delta
Force''), who insisted that Detmers test for the part.
   ``I could see his point,'' the actress said. ``Nobody knows me in
the United States. This project is something he wanted to do for a
long, long time. In Europe, it's not very usual for people to have a
screen test unless you're just beginning. Here, it's very normal to
ask for one.''
   But Detmers didn't feel that way at the time. She told Golan
there was no reason to audition and walked off the set.
   ``It was not a tactic at all. I went back to the hotel not even
thinking about the consequences of what I had done. I was already
arranging for my ticket back to Paris,'' the actress said with a
laugh.
   And then, in true Hollywood fashion, Detmers got another chance.
Golan called her and asked if he could stop by. The director arrived
with a script under his arm.
   ``He said, `Let me read for you,''' Detmers recalled. ``He's a
big man. If you saw Menaham, you could imagine how touching it was
from him to read a poem of Hannah's when she was 16 years old. He
started reading and I said, `OK, I'll read the poem.'
   ``I read two lines and he said, `OK, OK. You don't have to go on,
it's you! it's you!'''
   It wasn't the first time that the 24-year-old Detmers had taken a
chance. At 18, she went to Paris to pursue a career in theater. Two
problems: She couldn't speak French and had no acting experience.
   ``It wasn't much of a risk,'' she shrugged. ``They chose me as
the first one of 750 people in some kind of selection thing. An
agent signed me up when I didn't even know what an agent was. I knew
that it was logical. I was never surprised.''
   Detmers wasn't so nonchalant about her debut film, ``Prenom:
Carmen,'' directed by Jean Luc Godard (``Breathless,'' ``Band of
Outsiders''), who helped lead the French ``New Wave'' explosion in
the late 1950s.
   ``I can either talk about him for three days without interruption
or just say it was extremely confusing and difficult. He was not
nice at all. After two weeks he was telling everybody how bad they
were.''
   But she felt she understood what made Godard so difficult to work
with.
   ``He is extremely sensitive to absolute things in life. Absolute
whenever they happen, nobody talks, nobody writes, nobody speaks,
nobody films. As soon as you film something or write something, you
start the betrayal of the idea that something is absolute.''
   While Detmers enjoyed an easier relationship with Golan on the
set of ``Hanna's War,'' she still found the film an overwhelming
experience.
   ``I was just walking with this bubble around me. Sometimes people
didn't dare approach me. I just couldn't keep my mind on anything
else. Wherever Hanna went she had this incredible impact on people.
She was converted into some kind of spiritual center.
   ``I'm sorry if I use pompous words, but it's the only way I can
talk about her.''
   Hanna Senesh was born in Budapest in 1921 and grew up in a
well-to-do family. She showed an early talent for writing and hoped
to study at the University of Budapest.
   But with the rise of Hitler, she fled to Palestine when she was
17 and became passionate about furthering the cause of a Jewish
homeland. Senesh returned to Budapest in 1944 and joined the fight
to defend Jews against the Nazis, who now occupied the country.
   ``I understood what was pushing her,'' Detmers said. ``The force
behind everything she did was neither a religious ideal nor a
political conviction nor some kind of an opinion about something, it
was a life force itself.''
   ``People use the word `courage' when they talk about her. I don't
think courage ever came into her mind. She was just doing what she
had to do.''
   Senesh was eventually convicted for treason by a military court
in Budapest and executed. In her closing statement to the court, she
delivered a powerful denunciation of the Nazis and their
collaborators.
   Detmers took great pride in the filming of the courtroom scene.
   ``It was so well constructed, that speech,'' she said. ``It was
exactly what she was about. In filming, I hardly ever feel anything
joyous. Everything in the film seems to be made to keep the actors
from doing what they have to accomplish, but that speech was really
nice to do.''

<HEAD>Thailand Seeks Business Links with Indochina</HEAD>
<BYLINE>BY MOLLY YONG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Thailand has begun looking to its
communist-governed neighbors as trading partners after shunning them
since the Indochina war years.
   Calling for increased commerce with Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia,
Thai businessmen voice fear they are being outdone by counterparts
from Japan and Singapore, which are drawing $200 million to $300
million a year in a low profile but brisk trade.
   As Vietnam liberalizes its underdeveloped economy, Thai
businessmen and some legislators worry that if they act too slowly
Japan and Singapore along with Hong Kong, Taiwan or France will
corner a market that Thailand is in a favorable geographic position
to penetrate.
   Prime Minister Chatichai Choonhavan, himself a businessman,
started talking about improving general relations with Indochina as
well as exploring economic opportunities shortly after taking office
in August.
   Already Thai businessmen are angling for fishing licenses in
bountiful Vietnamese waters and sending agricultural experts to Laos
to supervise an experimental farm while importing Laotian timber.
   Laotians shop at a Thai-run department store in Vientiane, the
Laotian capital, and a Thai company recently entered into the first
major joint venture project in Laos, the construction of a garment
factory.
   But officially Thailand has thus far had no
government-to-government economic transactions with Vietnam since
its troops invaded neighboring Cambodia, and Thai policy has been
one of putting pressure on the Vietnamese in all fields. The Thai
government also offers no help to private entrepreneurs doing
business with Indochina, but it generally turns a blind eye to the
vast black market trade across its borders with Cambodia and Laos as
well as Burma.
   ``We have lost time and lost out to countries that actively
traded with Indochina regardless of their government's strong
opposition to Vietnamese troops in Cambodia,'' said Wongse
Polnikorn, a former deputy foreign minister and currently chairman
of a Thai company that will import timber from Laos and set up a
cash-crop farm in Vientiane.
   Prime Minister Chatichai has instructed that the number of goods
officially banned for export to Laos be halved to 30, according to
government spokesman Suvit Yodmani.
   Since the 1975 communist victories in Indochina, periodic
skirmishes _ as well as two major confrontations _ have erupted
along the Thai-Laotian border. Similar clashes have occurred between
Thais and Vietnamese along the Thai-Cambodian frontier.
   Last year, two-way trade between Laos and Thailand topped $48
million, although the black market, or ``unofficial,'' trade is
known to be far higher. Two-way trade with Vietnam rose to $7.5
million last year from $4.8 million in 1986 while Thai exports to
Cambodia were $400,000 in 1986.
   But some in Thailand, which has traditionally been suspicious of
Vietnam's longterm intentions in the region, view a prosperous
Vietnam as potentially dangerous and expansionist.
   ``If we can make Vietnam prosperous, ourselves prosperous, that's
great, but what is there to guarantee that Vietnam won't move into
Thailand's northeast,'' spokesman Suvit said in an interview. ``Once
it's prosperous, then it can afford to keep troops in Cambodia.''
   Surin Pitsuwan, a leading member of Parliament, suggested that
Thailand at first proceed cautiously in trading with Laos, a country
with which it shares ethnic and cultural bonds and which poses no
major security threat. He also suggested more economic dealings with
Burma, with which official, two-way trade totaled $544 million in
1987.
   ``There are a lot of trade opportunities and untapped resources
next door,'' Surin said. ``If we don't hurry now, the degree of
their dependence on us will be reduced.''
   Although Thailand will be hard pressed to compete with Japanese
technology and funding, businessmen say the Thais could carve out a
profitable Indochina niche in such areas as agro-industry, fishing,
forestry and smaller-scale construction.
   Thailand, where the economy is booming and consumer spending on
an upward curve, could also serve as a market for Indochinese goods.
While war has largely wrecked economic infrastructure in Indochina,
the three countries possess large untapped natural resources and an
abundance of cheap labor.
   ``We must go and explore ways we can do more and benefit from one
another,'' said Kangwan Tantiponganant, a businessmen involved in
Laos. Given the political sensitivities, other Thai businessmen
prefer to make low-keyed trips to Vietnam and Laos, emphasizing that
their interests are in ``long-term business planning.''

<HEAD>Surplus-Agency Chief Deals in Federal Bargains, From Bolts To
Bulldozers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ARLENE LEVINSON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>TAUNTON, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>

   In his pursuit of a bargain for taxpayers,
Edward Aleixo has flown into the mountains of Virginia to retrieve
an old pickup truck with bad tires and no rear lights, driving it
home to Massachusetts.
   He has wangled his way into government vaults and come out with
an Oriental rug Henry Kissinger couldn't use, and procured shelving
and two office cubicles discarded by the White House.
   Aleixo, a retired Air Force colonel, former narcotics agent and
one-time school superintendent, makes big deals, too.
   As director of the Massachusetts State Agency for Surplus
Property, Aleixo is trying at the moment to get his hands on 12 used
helicopters no longer wanted by the Army in Fort Rucker, Ala., so he
can give them to state police and a flight school in Boston.
   Note the word ``give.''
   Alexio insists he doesn't sell a thing he brokers. But for a
relatively small price that covers the cost of his operation, Aleixo
obtains surplus federal property and passes it on to state and
municipal governments, schools and non-profit organizations such as
nursing homes and halfway houses.
   A relatively small price?
   How does $150 sound for a $1,840.56 medical centrifuge (like new)?
   Or $2,500 for a used $200,000 road grader?
   The 9-by-12-foot Kissinger rug was a gift from Algeria that the
then-secretary of state couldn't accept. It now warms the toes of
some Massachusetts government official, a bargain at $150.
   Every state has a surplus agency, under a law Congress enacted
after World War II to make sure the states shared in the federal
leftovers. Customers are restricted to government entities,
educational institutions and non-profit health agencies. There are
1,800 certified customers around the country.
   In Massachusetts, there's a twice-yearly junkyard sale, but
otherwise Aleixo's warehouses are closed to the public. His
customers say access to the surplus stuff helps.
   ``It's tremendous,'' said Brian Broderick, who for 15 years has
been buying surplus goods for the Metropolitan District Commission,
an agency that oversees highways, sewers and other projects that
cross juridictions in the Boston area.
   Government surplus kept the commission rolling a decade ago while
waiting for a bond issue to buy new vehicles. For instance,
tractor-trailers were supplied for a song: $5,000 apiece for a set
of four that would have cost $65,000 each new.
   The Metro Police command bus, a headquarters on wheels, was once
a NASA mobile tracking station. ``We paid no more than $1,000 for
it. A nice piece of equipment that would have cost us $55,000 to
$60,000.''
   ``This is the cheapest way the government has of getting rid of
its property,'' Aleixo said. ``Most of the money goes back to the
taxpayer.''
   Customers pay about 3 cents on the original dollar cost to the
government. Even so, Aleixo's self-supporting operation is in the
red trying to cover its $450,000 annual operating costs, including a
staff of 12. Since the late 1970s, federal agencies have become more
economy minded.
   ``That is good, but there's a point where it's more
cost-effective to buy something new,'' rather than fix the old,
Aleixo said.
   He reckons the state government saves $1 million a year picking
through his warehouse. The assorted other customers save $5 million
to $6 million.
   Rotund and low to the ground, Aleixo is an intense man with a
sense of purpose and a one-liner to describe his work: ``We get all
the bang that's left in the buck.''
   Even the warehouses storing the goods are hand-me-downs. A pair
of long gray metal-clad buildings at the back of an industrial park,
they were erected in 1942 as an assembly point for soldiers shipping
off to fight World War II.
   Inside, every truck, electron microscope and box of bolts, gets a
number.
   Items that cost the government more than $5,000 when new must be
used by the receiver within a year. If not, the new owner doesn't
get title to the object and it is considered stolen property. Items
costing more than $10,000 must be used within 36 months.
   What's in the inventory?
   Dental file cabinets, an oboe and half a piccolo, tons of bolts
for building bridges, metal and wood desks in various stages of
decrepitude from the Internal Revenue Service, a brass bedstead once
belonging to a naval computer testing equipment, computer circuit
boards, air conditioner filters.
   Also: leftover pipe from a submarine, ice skates, map file
drawers, machine tool drills, typewriters and calculators, chairs,
an aircraft camera, tool boxes, an offset press, and Army-green gas
tanks among the takings when a government supplier came under
criminal scrutiny and the relationship ended.
   So what can agencies or schools do with, say, a jet engine
container or 2,000 feet of 2-inch plastic tubing?
   ``I advise them to send a creative person, a person with a spirit
of innovation who can see a new way to use something,'' Aleixo said.
   ``The kids from MIT. They're probably our biggest customers.''

<HEAD>Election Not Over on `Designing Women'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KATHRYN BAKER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When a character on NBC's ``Empty Nest'' was
asked what to wear to an opera and replied, ``How should I know? I'm
from Arkansas,'' at least one viewer wasn't laughing.
   Arkansas native Linda Bloodworth-Thomason, creator of CBS'
``Designing Women,'' says she's tired of television making fun of
Southerners.
   ``Designing Women'' is about four smart Southern women _ emphasis
on smart _who run a design store. Next season, Bloodworth-Thomason
gets another show to make her point. Tentatively titled
``Arkansas,'' the CBS show will tentatively star Hal Holbrook,
husband of ``Designing Women'' star Dixie Carter.
   ``I sort of want to do that town that's in `It's a Wonderful
Life.' You know, where everybody knows everybody and everybody's
still real good?'' she said. ``There's going to be people who talk
like hicks and rednecks talking about glasnost and perestroika, and
they know what's going on in the world. I think we'll make some
points for our side with it.
   ``I don't want to be humorless about it, but I feel that negative
stereotype is very damaging to children,'' she said. ``I think they
are definitely affected. I think they grow up thinking they have to
move to New York to validate themselves. I think Susan (Harris,
creator of ``Golden Girls'' and ``Empty Nest'') is a beautiful
writer. But I found some of the jokes in the (``Empty Nest'') pilot
objectionable.''
   She said she especially objected when Laverne (Park Overall), a
receptionist, was asked what Arkansans do on Saturday night. She
replied, ``You wash your hair until you're 14, then you marry your
cousin.''
   Bloodworth-Thomason and her producer-director husband, Harry
Thomason, call their production company Mozark, since he's from
neighboring Missouri.
   An NBC publicist for ``Empty Nest'' said that show's producers
did not care to comment on Bloodworth-Thomason's remarks. It is
worth noting that on Harris' ``Golden Girls,'' Betty White's
character pokes fun of Minnesotans as boring and unsophisticated.
   ``When other regions of the country are depicted, their
eccentricities are always sort of delightful,'' said
Bloodworth-Thomason. ``Like if they're New Englanders, they're
stubborn and thrifty. I mean, excuse me for being overly sensitive
(but) I would rather be called stubborn and thrifty than ignorant
and incestuous.
   ``It seems like a small thing, and it seems like you're
nit-picking, but the truth is it's gone on so long, and it permeates
the media to such an extent, I think it's a stereotype that hasn't
begun to die.''

   Elsewhere in television:
   FROM THE FILES OF `WHAT WAS THAT ALL ABOUT?' _ A publicist for
ABC's adventure series ``MacGyver'' calls and says the producers and
star Richard Dean Anderson want to be interviewed about Monday's
episode in which they pitch better handgun control because of the
effect on youngsters. It seems ABC insists on deleting a line of
dialogue _ ``When are they going to do something about kids and
guns?'' _ and a message at the end saying 10 U.S. youngsters are
killed each day with handguns. Telephone interviews are set up _ the
show is shot in Vancouver, British Columbia _ then canceled, because
of pressure from ABC, the publicist says. ABC denies pressure
regarding the interviews, but explains its objection to the
dialogue. ``ABC will not allow any of its entertainment programs to
be used for advocacy purposes,'' said ABC spokewoman Janice
Gretemeyer. Finally, according to Paramount spokesman John
Wentworth, ABC allows the dialogue to remain. He says everybody is
happy and no interviews are necessary. ``I don't think there's
anything more to say about it,'' he says. ...
   OH, IS THAT ALL _ ``The Greatest Television News Stories of All
Time'' can be yours on 12 one-hour videocassettes to be available
soon from ABC. Produced by ABC News, the videos will likely include
such events as the assassination of President Kennedy, the first
moon landing and the Iran hostage taking. ...
   FROST THIS WINTER _ David Frost will be the host of King World's
planned newsmagazine show, ``Inside Edition.'' Frost most recently
has been busy with his ``The Next President'' series of interviews
with all the presidential candidates. ``Inside Edition'' will
premiere in syndication in January.

   Every day is Thanksgiving Day at the
Rainbow Kitchen, one of hundreds of American soup kitchens where
hunger never takes a holiday.
   ``These people need help year-round, not just during the
holidays,'' Kevin Amos said as he stocked the Rainbow Kitchen's
pantry with canned goods.
   ``This is one of those thousand points of light (President-elect
George) Bush talks about,'' said Bob Anderson, a former steel
worker. ``But there's no reason this kind of charity should have to
exist. We just keep going because we don't want to see people turned
away.''
   Anderson opened the Rainbow Kitchen in 1984 after the sharp
decline of steel and heavy manufacturing left thousands jobless in
Homestead, a historic steel town adjacent to Pittsburgh.
   The Rainbow Kitchen is one cog amid all the soup lines, food
banks, churches and senior citizen centers nationwide that make up
an ever-growing, mostly volunteer and imperfect machine that
distributes millions of pounds of free food every year.
   ``We never thought we'd be in operation this long,'' Anderson
said. ``The number of people we serve just keeps growing and
growing.''
   Homestead's Eighth Avenue bustled when U.S. Steel's sprawling
Homestead Works was turning out giant steel slabs into the early
1980s. But the mill is cold and shuttered now, and business on the
avenue is slower.
   At noon each day, a quiet line forms outside the Rainbow Kitchen,
where hot lunches are served to an average of 185 people.
   ``We get a mixture of people,'' Anderson said. ``It used to be a
lot more unemployed people. I think now it's more underemployed
people. I see more children than I'd like to see here. We get whole
families.''
   One recent chilly afternoon, Sharon Fischer, 25, expressed
gratitude as she and two of her three young children munched on
hamburger patties, pasta and potato salad served on plastic plates.
   ``I'm not ashamed. I'm not rich,'' she said. ``This is decent.
They make sure you're full when you leave.''
   Ms. Fischer, single and unemployed, said she has looked for work,
but ``they aren't hiring.'' She said she can't get by on food
stamps, so she eats at the kitchen several times a week.
   Anderson operates the Rainbow Kitchen on $125,000 a year. Most of
the money comes from small donations, although rock star Bruce
Springstein donated $10,000 in 1985.
   ``Sometimes we run out of food and just hold up the line,''
Anderson said. ``We open up some big cans of beans or something and
just start making sandwiches like crazy.''
   Every Thursday, the Rainbow Kitchen opens its pantry to about 700
families who are given a bag or two of groceries.
   Since 1980, changes by Congress and the Reagan administration
have narrowed eligibility for food stamps and therefore reduced the
amount going out. Last year, the federal government spent $10.59
billion for food stamps, compared with $11.98 billion in 1980,
according to Census Bureau figures adjusted for inflation. In that
time, the number of people receiving food stamps declined by about
900,000, the Census Bureau said.
   In roughly the same period, from 1979 to the present, the number
of people living below the poverty line of $11,600 annual income for
a family of four has grown by 6 million, the government reports.
   Many people eligible for food stamps either don't apply or are
wrongly rejected, according to Robert Fersh, executive director of
the non-profit Food Research and Action Center in Washington, D.C.
   On average, food stamp recipients each month get stamps worth
about 54 cents per meal, although Fersh said some elderly
individuals get as little as $10 a month. It's therefore no surprise
many run out of money at month's end and turn to pantries and soup
kitchens for help, he said.
   ``The number of people needing food by the end of the month has
risen,'' Fersh said. ``The people who rely on the safety net not
only have had food assistance cut but have to pay more for medical
care and utilities.''
   Annual surveys by the U.S. Conference of Mayors reveal a steady
increase in the need for emergency food, said Laura Waxman,
assistant executive director of the group.
   A survey of 26 cities found two-thirds of those who needed food
in 1987 were families with children, she said.
   ``You think of the traditional soup kitchen user as the single
man or the single woman, but we know there are more and more
families,'' Ms. Waxman said.
   The heart of the nation's grassroots food distribution is the
Second Harvest National Food Bank Network, which began in 1979 in
Phoenix.
   Last year, Second Harvest, now based in Chicago, distributed
about 387 million pounds of food. Its 205 affiliated food banks
served 38,000 local charities, including pantries, soup kitchens,
shelters, and day-care and senior citizen centers.
   Yet the need for more food is constant.
   ``What I generally hear are stories of a food pantry that is so
strapped for food and money that it is only able to supply three
days' supply of food per family per month regardless of the depth of
the family's need,'' said John Arnold, public policy manager for
Second Harvest.
   Many of the nation's food banks started in church basements with
one vehicle to haul food, but the average food bank today has
several trucks and handles 3 million to 6 million pounds of food a
year, Arnold said.
   The Greater Pittsburgh Community Food Bank boasts a
160,000-square-foot warehouse in nearby McKeesport that was bought
after a fund-raising drive led by two local banks. In 1987, the food
bank distributed about 7.3 million pounds of food to about 300
affiliates, including the Rainbow Kitchen, said Executive Director
Joyce Rothermal.
   More than half the food bank's supplies are donated by Second
Harvest, grocery stores and individuals. Some are bought with state
money, a small portion with federal money and the remainder with
food bank money.
   ``There's a group of people who are really bad off,'' Ms.
Rothermal said. ``It's falling to the private sector to help them.''
   Harry and MariAn Halt of Homestead, who have a teen-age son and
daughter, were among those crowded into the Rainbow Kitchen on a
recent Thursday waiting with paper bags and carts to pick up a slab
of butter, a carton of eggs and other groceries.
   ``We usually make the food stretch, but we sometimes get a little
close,'' said Halt, 47. He said heart problems forced him in 1986 to
quit his job as a caseworker for the state Department of Welfare.
   ``I don't know what we'd do without these food banks,'' Halt said.

   The U.S. trade deficit narrowed by 17 percent
to $10.5 billion in September, the government has reported.
   Exports rose by $700 million to a record high $28.2 billion, the
Commerce Department said Wednesday. Imports declined by 2.5 percent
or $1.1 billion to $38.7 billion from a record high in August.
   The $10.5 billion trade gap for September was down by $1.8
billion from the revised August trade deficit figure of $12.3
billion.
   But the government said the improvement was not enough to stem
inflation worries.

   The operating rate at U.S. factories, mines and
utilities rose in October to the highest level in 8{ years,
according to the Federal Reserve.
   The Fed said Wednesday that American industry used 84.0 percent
of its capacity last month, up from 83.8 percent in September. It
was the largest increase since July and the highest level since
February 1980.
   Capacity use has grown or held steady for eight consecutive
months, creeping ever closer to the 85 percent threshold that
economists believe signals a pickup in inflation.

   Business inventories rose sharply relative to
sales in September, the government reports.
   But analysts discounted the economic significance of Wednesday's
government report, noting that sales have picked up since then.
   The Commerce Department said inventories held on shelves and
backlots rose 0.7 percent to a seasonally adjusted $749.4 billion,
while sales remained virtually unchanged at $495.4 billion.

   But spokesmen for American Airlines and Delta Air Lines said
those carriers still were studying Continental's move.
   United said Wednesday it was matching Continental's action
throughout its route system with the average increase on the

already has begun to eat away at the foundations of our economic
strength, and the need to deal with it is becoming ever more
urgent.''
   Greenspan joined other witnesses in saying that Congress and
President-elect George Bush must reach agreement quickly on ways to
slash the deficit or run the risk that foreigners will stop
financing America's borrowing needs.

   A British securities fraud probe that suggests
Ivan Boesky duped Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. could give the
troubled firm a potent new attack on the credibility of the
imprisoned insider trader.
   Boesky has implicated Drexel in illegal acts and is expected to
be a star witness against the investment house.
   Legal experts said Wednesday that the British investigation also
may mean new trouble for Boesky if he did not disclose the alleged
fraud against Drexel when he negotiated a plea-bargain agreement two

   More than $70 million worth of Douglas and
noble firs are being cut and bundled as Oregon growers ready
themselves for the Christmas season.
   With an expected harvest of 7.2 million trees this year, Oregon
remains the nation's single largest supplier of Christmas trees.
   Prices remain about the same as last year for premium trees, with
6-foot to 7-foot Douglas firs bringing growers around $11, said
Bryan Ostlund, spokesman for the Northwest Christmas Tree
Association in Salem. Slower-growing noble firs bring a higher
price, he said, while retail prices are at least double what growers

   Oil futures prices have turned mixed as traders
keep their attention on the OPEC meetings scheduled for this week.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the December contract for
West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark grade of U.S. crude oil, fell
23 cents Wednesday to settle at $13.67 a barrel, after falling 37
cents on Tuesday. Other contract months also lost ground.
   Among refined petroleum products traded on the exchange
Wednesday, the December contract for unleaded gasoline settled at
46.50 cents a gallon, down 0.46 cent. The contract had fallen 1.20
cents Tuesday.
   The December contract for wholesale home heating oil, which fell
0.23 cent in the previous session, rose 0.07 cent to settle at 44.47
cents a gallon.
   Ministers from eight OPEC nations were gathering today for
pricing and strategy committee meetings in Vienna, Austria, wich
were to be followed by a full meeting of all 13 ministers on Monday.
   Analysts said reports that daily OPEC crude production has
reached 22.5 million barrels depressed some prices Wednesday, but
they said traders were optimistic cartel members would work at
upcoming meetings toward eliminating the worldwide oil glut.
   The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries has a
self-imposed daily production limit of about 15 million barrels.
However, a number of members are believed to be ignoring their
individual limits.
   Overproduction has added to an already glutted world market and
pushed crude prices well below OPEC's benchmark of $18 a barrel.

   Facing the prospect of fresh declines in
world oil prices, OPEC chiefs gathering today in Vienna are under
pressure to fashion a new agreement that will control the cartel's
surging production and help bolster crude prices.
   Ministers from eight of the 13 nations that make up the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries were meeting for talks
on bringing order to the chaotic oil market.
   ``There is a feeling they have to come up with a new (production)
agreement,'' said one OPEC official, who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
   ``They will work very hard at it because of the consequence of
failure...a collapse in prices,'' he said.
   The eight ministers are meeting in a joint session of two OPEC
committees, in talks that could run into the weekend. On Monday, all
13 ministers are to meet for the cartel's winter meeting.
   At issue is the thorny problem of how to address the cartel's
recently skyrocketing output, which has added to an already glutted
world market. Analysts say most OPEC members have exceeded their
production quotas, partly to press for position in advance of the
Vienna meetings.
   As a result, prices have slipped $4 or more below OPEC's
benchmark price of $18 a barrel. A barrel is equivalent to 42
gallons.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the December contract for
West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark grade of U.S. crude oil, fell
23 cents Wednesday to settle at $13.67 a barrel, after falling 37
cents on Tuesday.
   The recent declines reflect how dramatically OPEC production has
risen.
   The International Energy Agency estimated in its Monthly Oil
Market Report that OPEC production was nearly 21.1 million barrels a
day in October, the highest monthly output in more than five years.
   OPEC's official total production quota under a December 1986
arrangement is about 15 million barrels a day. That excludes Iraq,
which has ignored its limit.
   Nick Antill, oil analyst at the London brokerage County NatWest,
estimated next year's demand for OPEC oil at 18.7 million barrels a
day.
   Joseph Stanislaw, managing director of Cambridge Energy Research
Associates in Paris, speculated that a new accord might set total
output at 19 million to 19.5 million barrels a day.
   A key to a new quota agreement is bringing Iraq back into the
system.
   Saudi Arabia _ the world's largest oil exporter and OPEC's most
influential member _ and Kuwait have insisted that a fresh accord
must include all members.
   Saudi Arabia recently increased its production to more than 6
million barrels a day, well above its ceiling of 4.3 million
barrels, in an attempt to pressure other cartel members to obey
their quotas.
   Iraq has refused to obey its daily ceiling of 1.5 million barrels
because it wanted parity with war rival Iran, which has a quota of
2.4 million barrels.
   The two countries agreed to an August cease-fire in their
8-year-old war, and both want to earn more oil revenue to pay for
rebuilding their war-ravaged economies.
   Analysts estimated Iraq has been producing at least 2.6 million
barrels a day, and could boost production to 3.7 million barrels
next year with completion of a new pipeline through Saudi Arabia to
the Red Sea.
   Under a new system, Iran and Iraq might each get a quota of 2.6
million barrels, analysts predicted.
   OPEC ministers also must deal with the United Arab Emirates'
refusal to stick to its quota of 948,000 million barrels a day. It
independently has boosted its limit to 1.5 million barrels.
   OPEC's price evolution committee, meeting Thursday with the
long-term strategy panel, is made up of Algeria, Saudi Arabia,
Nigeria, Indonesia and Venezuela. The strategy committee's members
are Iraq, Iran, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Algeria and Venezuela.
   Other OPEC members are Ecuador, Gabon, Libya, Qatar and the
United Arab Emirates.

<HEAD>Grand Met Seeking To Block Burger King Spinoff; Pillsbury Won't
Meet</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TONY KENNEDY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MINNEAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Grand Metropolitan PLC says it is going to
court to try and block Pillsbury Co.'s plan to spin off its Burger
King fast-food chain, the key element in Pillsbury's attempt to
thwart Grand Met's hostile $5.23 billion takeover bid.
   The spinoff, set for Dec. 2, is part of a defensive restructuring
the food and restaurant company announced after rejecting Grand
Met's $60 a share tender offer as inadequate on Oct. 17.
   Pillsbury contends its shareholders would be better off with the
restructuring, in which they would receive a special dividend and
stock in the newly separate Burger King, which accounts for a huge
chunk of Pillsbury's revenues but is slumping.
   But Grand Met claims it would have to lower its buyout offer
should the spinoff occur, because the restructured company would
present a huge tax liability for Grand Met.
   Grand Met said Wednesday it planned to ask for a temporary
restraining order in Delaware Chancery Court, where Chancellor
William Allen has said he would hold a hearing Nov. 28.
   According to Grand Met, Allen also said he would set a hearing
for Dec. 12 on Grand Met's renewed motion to invalidate Pillsbury's
``poison pill'' takeover defense. The tender offer, which has been
extended three times, is conditioned on the removal of the pill,
which would make a takeover prohibitively expensive.
   Dissident shareholders also have sued to have the pill
invalidated, but courts in Delaware and Minnesota have left it
intact.
   Pillsbury stock closed at $56 Wednesday, down $2 a share in
composite New York Stock Exchange trading.
   In another matter, documents from both companies filed with the
Securities and Exchange Commission indicate Pillsbury Chairman
Philip Smith on Tuesday rejected a telephone request from Grand Met
Chairman Allen Sheppard to meet in New York to discuss the tender
offer.
   Sheppard on Wednesday renewed his criticism of Pillsbury's stance.
   ``We are amazed at the negative response to our overture, given
that almost 80 percent of the Pillsbury shares had been tendered to
Grand Met as of Nov. 14,'' Sheppard said in a statement.
   Pillsbury had no comment. In its SEC filing, Pillsbury said Smith
told Sheppard in their phone discussion that he saw no purpose in
meeting.
   ``Mr. Smith noted...that if Mr. Sheppard had anything additional
for the board to consider, he would report it to the board,''
Pillsbury's SEC document said.
   In Grand Met's account of the telephone conversation, Smith said
he was led to believe from media reports and company statements that
Grand Met was firm on the price of its tender offer.
   ``Mr. Sheppard indicated that while he presently saw no reason to
increase the offer price, he had heard that Mr. Smith was a very
good salesman and was prepared to listen to any argument that Mr.
Smith might have regarding why Grand Met ought to pay more than $60
a share,'' Grand Met stated.

<TEXT>
   Prime Computer Inc. is asking its stockholders to
wait two weeks before deciding whether to sell their shares under a
$970 million takeover offer made by a small California computer
maker.
   On Wednesday, one day after the unsolicited offer by MAI Basic
Four Inc., which is controlled by New York investor Bennett S.
LeBow, Prime also announced that its president, Joe M. Henson, was
stepping down six weeks earlier than planned.
   Henson said in a statement that the takeover bid ``makes it
desirable to complete the transition now so Prime can be represented
by the man who will have responsibility for leading it in the
future.''
   Anthony Craig was named on Oct. 3 to succeed Henson but was not
due to take over until the end of the year.
   MAI Basic, which already owns 4.1 percent of Prime's 48.5 million
shares outstanding, is offering $20 a share for the remaining stock.
   Prime closed Wednesday at $17 a share, down 75 cents in
consolidated New York Stock Exchange trading. MAI Basic fell 37{
cents to $11 a share.
   Natick-based Prime in February acquired Computervision Inc. for
$435 million to become the second-leading supplier behind
International Business Machines Corp. in the field of computer-aided
design and manufacturing systems.
   Prime last month bolstered its position by acquiring General
Electric Corp.'s Calma business, which also makes CAD-CAM systems.
MAI Basic, which is about one-quarter the size of Prime, makes
business computers and information processing systems.
   In a statement Wednesday, Prime said its board of directors would
meet ``in due course'' to discuss the MAI Basic bid, which is being
made by a wholly owned subsidiary set up specifically for the
takeover, Choice Corp.
   The company said it will notify shareholders of its decision by
Nov. 29.
   Choice Corp. has conditioned the bid on at least 67 percent of
shares being tendered by the offer's Dec. 13 expiration.
   MAI Basic said it filed suit in Delaware Chancery Court seeking
to block Prime's new poison-pill takeover defense from taking
effect. The company also has begun litigation against Prime in U.S.
District Court in Boston seeking to overturn a Massachusetts law
that limits takeover attempts.

<HEAD>U.S. Rice Group Head Assails ``Evil Empire'' In Japanese
Agriculture</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Japan's refusal to import U.S. rice is the work of
an ``evil empire'' that manipulates the Japanese agricultural
business, according to the head of the U.S. Rice Millers'
Association.
   Stephen Gabbert, president of the association that groups rice
producers in six U.S. states, said Thursday that Japan could start
easing some of its social problems _ such as high land, housing and
food prices _ by liberalizing its heavily-controlled rice market.
   The U.S. government in late October rejected a petition by the
Rice Millers' Association to proceed with a complaint against
Japan's ban on rice imports, but also said Japan's policy
contravened trade agreements and the millers' complaint could be
reintroduced if there is no progress in easing the ban.
   After laborious negotiations earlier this year, Japan agreed to
accept more U.S. beef and oranges. But it firmly has rejected calls
to open its rice market.
   Rice is Japan's staple food and the government's policy of
self-sufficiency in rice it requires massive subsidies to farmers.
Retail rice prices are at least triple U.S. prices.
   Gabbert told a news conference with foreign journalists that
Japan's rice policy ``is a fantastic example of economic distortion,
and it basically stinks.''
   He said bureaucrats in the Agriculture Ministry have no
understanding of economic reality, and sharply criticized the
nation's network of agricultural cooperatives, which are powerful
political lobbyists with huge economic resources.
   Japan's rice policy, Gabbert said, ``is tied to a cooperative
framework which I would characterize as basically an evil empire.''
The cooperative movement is supposed to help Japanese farmers and
consumers, he said, but ``it exploits farmers and gouges consumers.''
   Gabbert proposed a 2.5 percent a year opening of Japan's rice
market over a four-year period. Ten percent of the rice market would
be as much as American growers could produce, he said, noting that
25 percent of U.S. rice fields now are out of production.
   If Japan liberalizes its market, he predicted Japanese farmers
would become more efficient, that land and housing prices would go
down because some paddy land would be freed for housing, and that
Japanese consumers could spend less on agricultural products and
more on manufactured imports, thus further helping the country
reduce its huge trade surplus.
   Gabbert was in Japan, which he said he had visited 20 times in
the past 15 years, to study his association's options as it decides
what to do next in its drive to penetrate Japan's rice market.

<TEXT>
   The dollar fell in European trading today, reaching
its lowest level against major foreign currencies in more than five
months. Gold prices also fell.
   The slight improvement in the U.S. trade deficit in September,
announced on Wednesday, was not enough to reverse the downward
pressure on the dollar, foreign currency dealers said.
   The U.S. trade deficit narrowed to $10.46 billion from $12.18
billion in August.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day begins,
the dollar fell to a 15-year low against the Japanese yen, closing
at 121.52 yen, despite reported central bank intervention.
   Later, in London, it was quoted at 122.00 yen.
   The Bank of Japan reportedly intervened in the market on a
``pretty big'' scale to prevent the dollar's further decline, said
one dealer in Tokyo.
   The bank refused to comment on its activities. But Japanese
Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa called for joint action by monetary
authorities to prop up the sagging dollar, a Finance Ministry
official said on condition of anonymity.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning, compared with late Wednesday's
prices, included: 1.7190 West German marks, down from 1.7230; 1.4425
Swiss francs, down from 1.4465; 5.8745 French francs, down from
5.8975; 1.9399 Dutch guilders, down from 1.9575; 1,280.10 Italian
lire, down from 1,291.00; and 1.2323 Canadian dollars, up from
1.2305.
   In London, one British pound cost $1.8325, 1 cent more expensive
for buyers than late Wednesday's $1.8225, and the pound's highest
level against the dollar since May 31.
   London's five major bullion dealers fixed a recommended price for
gold of $423.30 a troy ounce at midmorning today, unchanged from the
opening bid, but down from $425.50 bid late Wednesday.
   In Zurich, the bid price was also $423.30, down from $425.40 bid
late Wednesday.
   Bullion dealers in London said gold is languishing in narrow
ranges despite the dollar's weakness, because the precious metal
didn't have enough momentum to break through a strong resistance
level at $426 on Wednesday.
   ``People just became frustrated and took some profits on long
positions Wednesday, and there's not enough business in the European
market today to warrant a good move in either direction,'' one
dealer said.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold rose 65 cents to close at a bid
$424.34.
   Silver was quoted in London at a bid price of $6.32 a troy ounce,
down from Wednesday's $6.39.

   The dollar plummeted to a 15-year low against the
Japanese yen today, despite the Bank of Japan's reported
intervention. But share prices rose on the Tokyo Stock Exchange.
   The dollar closed at 121.52 yen, down 2.02 yen from Wednesday's
close of 123.54 yen. Opening at 122.40 yen, the currency ranged
between 121.30 and 122.40 yen.
   Today's close was the lowest since the Tokyo market began
floating the exchange rate when the Bretton-Woods system was
abandoned in February 1973. Before then, one dollar was fixed at 360
yen.
   The Bretton-Woods agreement at the end of World War II
established the international currency exchange system in which the
dollar's value was fixed at that of one ounce of gold, and all other
currency rates were pegged to the dollar.
   Dealers attributed the dollar's dive today largely to investors'
pessimism over Washington's ability to reduce its trade deficit and
the central bank's failure to prop up the currency.
   Market sources said the central bank bought dollars
intermittently throughout the day but failed to reverse the
currency's decline because it bought ``only a small amount of dollar
compared to the amount (of) money in the market,'' said Mitsuhiko
Kinugasa of Daiwa Bank.
   The Bank of Japan does not comment on its activities.
   On Wednesday, the U.S. Commerce Department said the nation's
September trade deficit was $10.5 billion, down from $12.27 billion
in August.
   ``But the dollar will keep falling as long as the market
sentiment for the weaker dollar continues,'' said Sumio Fukushima of
Sumitomo Bank.
   Despite the improved U.S. trade deficit, ``it is still large, and
the United States has not shown any signs to attempting to reduce
its deficit further,'' Fukushima said.
   A dealer with the Bank of Tokyo said neither central bank
intervention nor dollar-buying by speculators could stop the
currency's decline.
   ``There are still so many people who want to get rid of the
currency,'' he said, adding he doubted if the dollar ever could
return to the 122-yen level. He also spoke anonymously.
   Meanwhile, the 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average, which closed
Wednesday at 28,996.12, added 80.69 points, or 0.28 percent, to
close above the 29,000 level for the first time. Its finish at
29,076.81 was its fifth straight record high.
   Share prices opened lower in Tokyo following declines in overseas
markets and the dollar's plunge in New York, but gradually rose
toward the end of trading as dealers became interested in a wide
varieties of issues, said Nikko Securities' Yoshio Shimoyama.
   ``But many investors, especially speculative ones, were sitting
on the sidelines to see what happens to the currency market,'' he
said.
   In moderate trading with 850 shares traded on the first section,
electrical issues attracted participants.

<TEXT>
   WILLIAM BROCK, former Republican senator from Tennessee, former
U.S. trade representative and former secretary of labor:
   In 1927, my grandfather sent a moving letter to all his employees
and friends, warning that they should prepare for difficult times,
save their money and avoid any debt. He talked about how the nation
had gone on a binge of speculation, consuming to excess and
borrowing to finance that consumption....
   My grandfather was no more graced with the ability to forecast
the future than I am, yet I know just how he felt in writing that
letter.
   This nation is living beyond its means, borrowing long-term in
order to satisfy short-term demands for immediate consumption, and
imposing as a consequence, huge new obligations each week, each
month, each year on our own children.
   Like some confused Robin Hood, we rob from those who have no

   ALAN GREENSPAN, chairman of the Federal Reserve:
   It is beguiling to contemplate the strong economy of recent years
in the context of very large deficits and to conclude that the
concerns about the adverse effects of the deficit have been
misplaced.
   But this argument is fanciful.
   The deficit already has begun to eat away at the foundations of
our economic strength. And the need to deal with it is becoming ever
more urgent. To the extent that some of the negative effects of
deficits have not as yet been felt, they have been merely postponed,
not avoided. Moreover, the scope for further such avoidance is
shrinking.

   Day in and day out, the American public is subjected to another
newspaper column or television news story stating as if it were
fact, that the federal budget deficit is so large and spending has
been cut so much that no matter what the president-elect might say,
taxes will have to go up, or the economy will founder.
   Vice President Bush never succumbed to this herd psychology and
neither did voters. Throughout the presidential campaign, the vice
president spoke of a fair and flexible freeze to balance the budget
without raising taxes.
   Many opinion leaders ridiculed this idea as void of substance and
impractical. In fact, a fair and flexible freeze is imminently
doable and goes right to the heart of the federal budget deficit
problem. The deficit persists not because revenues are growing too
slowly but because federal spending has been increasing much too
rapidly.

<HEAD>`New Sources of Revenue Will Have to Be Sought'</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   CHARLS E. WALKER, chairman, American Council for Capital
Formation, former deputy Treasury secretary:
   While spending restraint should be accorded first priority in
deficit reduction, it is an inescapable fact that a swing of $180
billion per year in the federal budget is all but impossible without
a significant tax increase.
   The only alternatives are either decimation of the defense
budget, or sharp (and politically undoable) cuts in Social Security
and Medicare.
   From a political standpoint, a workable approach might be a
five-year budget plan that would split the deficit reduction task
evenly between spending restraint and tax increases, or $90 billion
per year for each.
   Spending goals would be met by slowing the rate of increase in
federal spending relative to potential GNP (gross national product).
On the tax side, it is clear that new sources of revenue will have
to be sought....
   A broad-based consumption tax, such as a value added tax (VAT)
has several advantages over other types of tax increases. It is a
powerful revenue raiser, providing more than $10 billion per point
per year if broadly applied. Surveys show that it is the ``least
unpopular'' tax, the tax people prefer to pay if they must pay more.

<HEAD>`All the Possible Solutions Are Painful Ones'</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   ALICE M. RIVLIN, senior fellow at Brookings Institution, former
head of the Congressional Budget Office:
   Solution to the deficit problem must be bipartisan, not only
because the voters have elected a Republican president and a
Democratic majority in the Congress, but because all the possible
solutions are painful ones.
   Would that it were possible to cut some large item in the budget
labeled, ``Waste, Fraud and Unnecessary Spending.'' Some such
dollars doubtless exist, but they are buried in items that have
strong support for good reasons.
   The budget cannot be cut in sufficient amounts to eliminate the
deficit, except by reducing programs and benefits that some people
feel they want and need _ or by raising revenues.
   Hence, a strong bipartisan effort is needed to divide the pain,
to explain why it is necessary and to build a national willingness
to accept some short run hardships in the interest of a healthier
economy in the longer run.

<HEAD>Rales Brothers Abandon Effort To Buy Interco</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An investment group seeking to buy Interco Inc.
for $2.7 billion has abandoned its tender offer after the St.
Louis-based retailer and manufacturer failed to meet the group's
deadline to begin takeover negotiations.
   Cardinal Acquisition Corp., the Washington-based group controlled
by Mitchell and Steven Rales, had said it would drop its
$74-per-share cash offer at midnight Wednesday and return all
tendered shares if Interco did not agree to give Cardinal
confidential corporate information or enter into buyout talks.
   The Raleses' offer had attracted tenders for 92 percent of
Interco's 35.56 million outstanding shares.
   Interco's stock price fell $1.87{ a share to $63.37{ in composite
New York Stock Exchange trading on Wednesday as traders anticipated
an end to the Raleses' bid.
   An Interco spokesman said the company would proceed with its
plans for a $2.8 billion restructuring that was valued at $76 a
share, including a $30.80, one-time cash and securities dividend to
shareholders.
   However, the legal maneuvering resulting from the bid was not
over.
   The Delaware Supreme Court is scheduled to consider on Nov. 30 an
appeal of a lower court ruling that declared Interco's ``poison
pill'' takeover defense illegal.
   Interco shareholders also have filed suits against the company
charging they were denied the full value of their stock by
management's refusal to accept the Raleses' bid.
   A spokesman for the Raleses declined comment on their future
plans.
   However, the Wall Street Journal reported today there were
indications the brothers might increase their holdings in Interco.
Lawyers for Interco told the Journal they had been notified the
Raleses were seeking federal clearance to acquire more shares in the
company.
   The Raleses currently own 3.2 million _ or 8.7 percent _ of
Interco's stock.
   Interco has rebuffed the brothers' overtures since their initial
$64-a-share offer in July.
   The restructuring plan, which would put Interco deeply into debt,
would result in the sale of its Ethan Allen furniture division and
other assets.
   Other Interco lines include Florsheim shoes, Converse sneakers
and London Fog outerwear.
   Interco employs about 54,000 people nationwide and had sales of
$3.34 billion last year.

   The stock market rallied today, attracting some
buyers at its lowest level since late summer.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which had fallen nearly
89 points over the previous six sessions, rose 11.56 to 2,050.14 in
the first half hour today.
   Gainers outnumbered losers by about 5 to 3 in nationwide trading
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 618 up, 370 down and
461 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 20.97 million shares as of 10
a.m. on Wall Street.
   Analysts said buying was encouraged by word that many central
banks around the world were moving to support the dollar in foreign
exchange.
   The dollar, which has fallen sharply in recent days, hovered
early today near post-World War II lows against the Japanese yen.
   Brokers also said some traders were ``bargain hunting'' among
stocks whose prices have fallen from their 1988 highs reached last
month.
   However, they added, enthusiasm for stocks continued to be
restrained by high yields available on short-term interest-bearing
investments such as Treasury bills.
   Gainers among the blue chips included General Electric, up { at
43; General Motors, up } at 80; American Express, up | at 26~, and
International Business Machines, up ] at 115~.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks rose
.63 to 149.59. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was down .07 at 286.23.
   On Wednesday the Dow Jones industrial average dropped 38.59 to
2,038.58, its lowest close since it stood at 2,002.31 on Sept. 1.
   Declining issues outnumbered advances by more than 4 to 1 on the
NYSE, with 296 up, 1,216 down and 443 unchanged.
   Big Board volume totaled 161.71 million shares, against 115.17
million in the previous session.

<HEAD>Pernod Apparently Wins Battle For Irish Distillers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pernod Ricard SA apparently won Thursday a
months-long takeover battle for Irish Distillers Group PLC,
Ireland's biggest whiskey maker, when Britain's Panel on Takeovers
and Mergers said the bidder had not breached any takeover rules.
   That means Pernod's offer of 285 million Irish punts, or 450
Irish pence a share, apparently prevails over Grand Metropolitan
PLC's higher offer of 322 million punts, or 525 Irish pence a share.
   Pernod's bid is the equivalent of $442 million.
   Irish Distillers shares fell 46 British pence to 378 pence on
London's Stock Exchange following the announcement.
   Pernod ``is obviously pleased that the ruling has gone its way
and looks forward to completing the offer,'' said a Pernod spokesman
in London, adding that the French liquor company currently holds
more than 53 percent of Irish Distillers' shares.
   The spokesman, who was not identified in accordance with British
practice, said he was confident Pernod would obtain clearance from
the Irish Ministry of Industry and Commerce, which is investigating
the offer on competitive, public interest, regional employment and
other grounds.
   The British takeover panel was ruling on whether Pernod
improperly obtained binding agreements from some Irish Distillers'
shareholders.
   Pernod has previously said it would release shareholders from
these commitments if the panel ruled against the French company. But
the panel, in a lengthy statement, said Pernod wouldn't be obliged
to do so.
   Grand Met spokesman Tim Halford said the British company had no
intention of disposing of its 25.1 percent holding in Irish
Distillers.
   ``We're actively buying shares at the moment to reaffirm our
interest in Irish Distillers,'' Halford said.
   Analysts said Grand Met's next move as a minority shareholder
likely would be an attempt to negotiate the purchase of one of Irish
Distillers' whiskey brands, or even a joint venture agreement with
Pernod.
   Irish Distillers' brands include Jameson's and Paddy whiskeys.
   ``Grand Met have said all along that they were interested in an
internationally known whiskey brand,'' said Ron Littleboy, an
analyst with Nomura Research Institute in London.

<HEAD>Housing Construction Soared 7.2 Percent in October</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Housing construction soared 7.2 percent in
October, the sharpest increase in eight months, with all regions of
the nation posting gains except the Northeast, the government said
today.
   The Commerce Department said new homes and apartments were built
at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.55 million units last
month, up from a 1.45 million rate in September.
   The big gain followed a revised 0.8 percent decline in September
and a 1.1 percent drop in August. Previously, the department said
housing starts increased 1.5 percent in September and fell 3.1
percent in August.
   The October jump, the biggest since a 9.9 percent increase in
February, suprised analysts who were expecting a decline of about 1
percent.
   ``Housing starts have been subject to a relatively large
fluctuation in recent months,'' White House spokesman Marlin
Fitzwater said, adding that the rebound last month ``puts the level
of housing starts at 6.3 percent above the third quarter average.
Starts in October still remain approximately 5 percent below last
year's average. So, on the whole, it's good news.''
   The housing start statistic is historically very volatile and
early estimates are often sharply revised as the government collects
more data.
   The increase last month can be explained, at least in part, by
mortgage interest rates, which fell steadily from mid-August through
early November, but have since started to creep higher.
   The Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. said 30-year fixed rate
mortgages averaged 10.24 percent last week, excluding special add-on
fees known as points. That was down from a peak this year of 10.71
percent in August.
   Single-family homes in October were built at an annual rate of
1.15 million units, up 10.0 percent, following a 3.3 percent decline
a month earlier.
   Apartment construction was up a scant 0.2 percent to 408,000
units in October after rising 6.3 percent in September.
   Building permits, a good indicator of future housing activity,
shot up 7.4 percent in October to an annual rate of 1.50 million
units, the highest since September 1987. Permits had fallen 4.8
percent a month earlier.
   By region, housing starts shot up 15 percent in the West to
498,000 units, rose 7.6 percent in the Midwest to 268,000 units,
climbed 4.6 percent in the South to 586,000 units and fell 2.4
percent in the Northeast to 202,000.
   For the first 10 months of the year, housing starts were running
9.6 percent behind the same period of 1987. The peak year for
housing construction during the current economic expansion was 1986,
when 1.81 million units were started. Starts fell to 1.62 million
last year, are expected to hit 1.45 million this year and decline
further next year.

   Hewlett-Packard Co. reported Thursday
its fourth-quarter earnings rose 11 percent while the computer

was strong ``on a broad mix of products.''
   For its full fiscal year, Hewlett-Packard said its earnings rose
27 percent to $816 million, or $3.36 a share, from $644 million, or
$2.50 a share, in fiscal 1987.
   Revenue rose to $9.83 billion from 1987's $8.09 billion.
   The company's orders exceeded $10 billion for the first time in
its history and were up 20 percent from a year ago.
   ``Order growth was robust across the globe, but particularly in
the Asia-Pacific region and Europe,'' Young said. ``In Japan, orders
rose approximately 40 percent over fiscal 1987.''

<TEXT>
   Holly Farms Corp., which has been fending off a
hostile takeover bid by a rival poultry producer, said today it
agreed to be acquired by agriculture conglomerate ConAgra Inc. in a
stock-swap deal worth around $1 billion.
   The merger was unanimously approved by the boards of directors of
both companies and is now subject to stockholders' agreement.
   Under the definitive pact, each of Holly Farm's 18.1 million
common shares outstanding would be exchanged for between 1.875
shares and 2 shares of ConAgra shares, depending on market
fluctuations, Lee Taylor, president of Memphis, Tenn.-based Holly
Farms, said in a brief interview.
   Based on ConAgra's close of $28.87{ a share on the New York Stock
Exchange on Wednesday, the deal would be valued at around $1.04
billion. By late morning the stock had fallen to $28.
   Holly Farms slipped 12{ cents a share to $52.62{ in early trading.
   Earlier this month, Holly Farms rejected as inadequate a hostile
$940 million bid, or $52 a share, from rival Tyson Foods Inc., the
nation's largest poultry producer.
   Springdale, Ark.-based Tyson has been trying since mid-October to
take over Holly Farms, but directors of the Memphis-based company
have spurned those advances.
   A secretary at Tyson's headquarters said no executvies were
available for immediate comment.
   Executives of Holly Farms and Tyson had met earlier this week,
but there was no comment from either side on what was discussed.
   In a statement, Taylor said the ConAgra deal ``provides our
stockholders with significantly higher value than any other
available alternative.''
   ``Our stockholders will not only receive a significant premium
for their stock but will continue to participate in Holly Farms'
future economic success as ConAgra stockholders,'' Taylor said.
   ConAgra, based in Omaha, Neb., said it expected to issue between
33.9 million and 36.2 million shares in the merger transaction. It
currently has 80.1 million common shares outstanding.
   The company said it expected shareholders of both companies to
vote on the agreement before the end of January.
   The terms of the agreement also gave ConAgra an option to
purchase certain Holly Farm assets. In addition, Holly Farms agreed
to pay a fee and expenses if the merger was not completed under
certain conditions.
   Two Holy Farms directors would join ConAgra's board.
   ConAgra Chairman Charles M. Harper said the deal was ``an
excellent strategic fit in terms of our businesses and our people.''
   Holly Farms is a diversified foods company with about half of its
sales in chicken. The company had total sales of $1.6 billion last
year. Tyson's 1987 sales totaled $1.8 billion.
   ConAgra operates in many segments of the food industry. Its
products include crop protection chemicals, animal health care
products as well as flour and grains and seafood and poultry
products.

<HEAD>Grain, Soybean Futures Open Lower On Slack Demand</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Grain and soybean futures opened lower today on
the Chicago Board of Trade in continued selling that analysts said
was linked to disappointment over the slow pace of grain sales for
export.
   Prices of grain and soybean futures have been in a downtrend
since last Thursday, one day after the Agriculture Department
revised upward its 1988 production estimates for corn and soybeans.
   The USDA report signaled that prices would have to drop to
encourage more foreign buying, said Cathy Leow, assistant vice
president of grain futures trading with Thomson McKinnon Securities
Inc. in New York.
   ``It basically told anyone still friendly to the market: `No way,
buddy, at least not in the short term. Demand has got to get a lot
larger.'
   ``I think people are just basically giving up on a lot of
positions they've held for quite a while,'' she said.
   In early trading, wheat was 2{ cents lower to { cent higher with
the contract for delivery in December at $4.08\ a bushel; corn was
1{ cents to 2{ cents lower with December at $2.61} a bushel; oats
were 1 cent to 2{ cents lower with December at $2.03 a bushel;
soybeans were 4\ cents to 6 cents lower with November at $7.39 a
bushel.
   Livestock futures were lower in early trading on the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange but pork-belly futures were mostly higher.
   Live cattle were .03 ent to .37 cent lower with December at 73.22
cents a pound; feeder cattle were .02 cent to .37 cent lower with
November at 81.67 cents a pound; hogs were .15 cent to .45 cent
lower with December at 40.90 cents a pound; and frozen pork bellies
were .02 cent lower to .28 cent higher with February at 44.60 cents
a pound.
   Livestock and meat futures settled mostly lower on Wednesday.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The epic takeover battle for RJR Nabisco Inc. has
been muddled further by Forstmann Little & Co.'s announcement that
it will not submit a bid for the food and tobacco giant.
   Forstmann Little, a corporate buyout specialist, stated Wednesday
that the investor group it led had decided that ``consistent with
its investment criteria, it will not submit a proposal.''
   The group's decision left two major known suitors for RJR
Nabisco, which is accepting sealed bids from prospective buyers
until Friday, and caused Nabisco's stock to tumble on speculation
that the bidding war may go no higher.
   At the same time, a possible new bid may emerge from a group
consisting of First Boston Corp. and Resource Holdings Ltd., a New
York investment banking concern backed by the wealthy Pritzker
family of Chicago and billionaire investor Philip Anschutz of
Denver, the Wall Street Journal reported today.
   Quoting unidentified sources, the newspaper said the First Boston
group had advanced a vague proposal that called for payment at least
partly in securities instead of cash. No amount was disclosed and
the proposal was given a dim chance of success, the Journal said.
   Officials at Resource Holdings declined comment. First Boston
officials did not immediately return phone calls this morning.
   ``There are 20 different scenarios on how this could shape up,''
said Mary English, a food industry analyst with the investment firm
of Furman, Selz after Forstmann Little's announcement Wednesday.
   The takeover maneuvering was further complicated by a major
lawsuit filed against RJR Nabisco management today in New York by
Metropolitan Life Insurance Co., a big holder of the company's bonds.
   The suit claims the buyout strategies pursued by management have
devastated the value of those bonds because they raise the prospect
of nearly quadrupling RJR Nabisco's debt.
   It was the second such court action filed in two days and
reflected a growing rebellion of bondholders against debt-financed
takeovers. On Tuesday, ITT Corp., another big holder of RJR Nabisco
bonds, sued the company on grounds its portfolio has been hurt. RJR
has declined comment on the suits.
   Before RJR Nabisco's special committee of outside directors
implemented bidding procedures on Nov. 7, two offers had been made
public _ a $20.3 billion, or $90-a-share, bid from the investment
firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts Inc., and a $20.7 billion, or
$92-a-share, offer by an investment group led by RJR Nabisco's top
managers.
   Although there are prospects that the two bidders could make a
joint offer for the company, previous attempts to do so have broken
down.
   And Wednesday's announcement came as a disappointment to
investors, because ``that knocks out one of three that could have
afforded something of this magnitude,'' Ms. English said.
   Forstmann Little had said any proposal it made would top the
management and Kohlberg Kravis offers.
   RJR Nabisco stock dropped $4.50 a share to $84 in New York Stock
Exchange composite trading Wednesday.
   Forstmann Little's announcement came three weeks after it held
talks with the RJR Nabisco management group and considered joining
that bid for the company. It then assembled a rival group consisting
of Procter & Gamble Co., Ralston Purina Co., Castle & Cooke Inc. and
Goldman, Sachs & Co.
   RJR Nabisco's president, F. Ross Johnson, who leads the managers
trying to buy the company, has the backing of the investment firms
Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. and Salomon Brothers Inc.
   When the RJR Nabisco board committee announced it would take
sealed bids for the company, it also said it was considering the
possible sale of the firm's food businesses in advance of any
takeover.
   The proceeds of any sale would be paid to shareholders before any
acquisition of RJR Nabisco, the committee said.
   The food businesses accounted for about 60 percent of the
company's $15.8 billion in 1987 net sales. Industry analysts have
estimated the businesses would bring a sale price ranging from $12.5
billion to $15.5 billion.
   Atlanta-based RJR Nabisco makes such well-known brands as Winston
and Camel cigarettes, Oreo cookies and Del Monte vegetables.
   If any bidder succeeded in buying the entire company, it would be
the biggest corporate acquisition ever. The RJR Nabisco management
and Kohlberg Kravis bids already dwarf the $13.4 billion spent in
the 1984 acquisition of Gulf Oil Corp. by what is now Chevron Corp.

<HEAD>Takeover Target Plessey Posts 6 Percent Profit Gain</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Plessey Co. PLC, a giant electronics company which
became the target of a hostile takeover bid on Wednesday, reported
Thursday its first-half earnings rose 6 percent, constrained by
recent acquisitions of its own.
   General Electric Co. PLC and Siemens AG launched a joint 1.7
billion-pound, or $3.1 billion, bid Wednesday for Plessey, which
``emphatically rejected'' the offer.
   Separately, in Brussels Thursday, the European Commission said
European Economic Community antitrust officials would look into the
proposed merger between the three European electronics giants.
   A commission spokesman said the combination would be ``an
operation of a European dimension'' and therefore of interest to the
EEC antitrust officials. Under the EEC treaty, the commission is
empowered to probe whether mergers satisfy competition rules.
   In its earnings statement, which made no mention of the bid,
Plessey said its earnings for the six months ended Sept. 30 came to
47.3 million pounds, compared with 44.6 million pounds in the same
period a year earlier.
   Revenue climbed 14.8 percent to 692.6 million pounds from 603.4
million pounds.
   The results were at the bottom end of a range of analysts'
forecasts.
   ``The important steps of the period under review give me
encouragement to confirm my belief that we are back on the growth
path,'' said Plessey Chairman Sir John Clark.
   ``I must emphasize, however, that much remains to be done in
integrating our acquisitions,'' he said.
   ``A priority within the company is to accelerate the benefits of
the acquisition program while at the same time reducing debt service
cost.''
   Recent Plessey acquisitions have included U.S.-based Electronic
Systems Division, purchased from Singer Co. for $310 million, and
Hoskyns Group PLC, a British computer services concern, bought for
164 million pounds.
   These purchases have raised Plessey's interest payments, cutting
into the company's profit, it said.

   The stock market was mixed today in a session
marked by some spotty buying of blue chips.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 big-name industrials, which had
fallen nearly 89 points over the previous six sessions, rose 7.47 to
2,046.05 by noontime on Wall Street.
   But losers outnumbered gainers by about 8 to 7 in nationwide
trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 586 up, 662

   Analysts said buying was encouraged by word that many central
banks around the world were moving to support the dollar in foreign
exchange.
   The dollar, which has fallen sharply in recent days, hovered
early today near post-World War II lows against the Japanese yen.
   Brokers also said some traders were ``bargain hunting'' among
stocks whose prices have fallen from their 1988 highs reached last
month.
   However, they added, enthusiasm for stocks continued to be
restrained by high yields available on short-term interest-bearing

   Do regulatory and judicial limitations on insider
trading include the activities of corporate officers who plot to
take over the company for their own benefit rather than that of
investors?
   Apparently not. The lack of attention to such activities suggests
to some critics that corporate insiders may have found the best deal
for themselves since at least the early 1930s and maybe since the
turn of the century.
   Executives are the ultimate insiders. Not only do they have
access to secrets _ sales expectations, new products, long-term
prospects _ they have the power to do things with those secrets.
   In contrast, most of those recently prosecuted as insiders have
been relatively passive, making money by investing and then waiting
for others to put into motion the corporate changes that would make
prices rise.
   Executive insiders have both the information and the means to
make things happen, and those two factors are involved in almost
every instance when they make a leveraged buyout offer to their own
shareholders.
   The situation seems to be stirring more anger among bedazzled
shareholders than among regulators, and that stirring _ in letters
to newspapers, among investment groups, in shareholder conversations
_ may erupt in legal action.
   Among questions commonly being discussed:
   _Were corporate officers, managers paid by the shareholders,
looking after their own or the shareholders' interests?
   _Did they maneuver the company's activities for their own or
shareholder interest?
   _Were they direct in their communications with investors,
employees and their own boards of directors _ who are committed by
law to the shareholders' interests _ or did they purposely withold
information on their intentions?
   At the extreme is the question of whether managements have
actively plotted to maintain corporate operations at a depressed
level in order to obtain a low buyout price, knowing they could
improve operations at a later date.
   Individual shareholders have been weak in dealing with such
matters over the years, but in the past decade or so they have
become better organized into effective forces.
   More significant, however, has been the growth of institutions,
which now do most of the stock trading on organized exchanges and
constitute enormous concentrations of funds for credit markets.
   Some of these institutions, such as pension funds and college
endowments, have seen the value of their bond investments plumment
after the management of companies in which they invested announced
leveraged buyout plans.
   The demoralizing impact on bond prices generally has not received
the same publicity afforded the run-up in stock prices. But the bond
market impact has been severe; new debt needed to accomplish a
leveraged buyout causes the value of existing bonds to decline,
badly affecting the bond portfolios of investors.
   One such bondholder, ITT Corp., filed suit this week against RJR
Nabisco Inc., claiming RJR management failed to disclose it was
considering a leveraged buyout when it sold RJR bonds to ITT last
April. ITT lost heavily.
   While some buyouts and unfriendly takeovers can have beneficial
effects for the company, its shareholders, employees and community,
a large percentage of them lead to fractured feelings, portfolios
and even the companies themselves.
   While it might seem that laws and regulations on insider
activities would apply, events suggest it is a no-man's land.
   It might take a series of these events, such as ITT's suit, to
clarify matters and provide rules and guidance where they seem not
to exist.

   The battered dollar rebounded in early trading today, bolstered
by a wave of coordinated dollar purchases by central banks, while
the stock market struggled to its feet after a sharp drop on
Wednesday.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which has fallen nearly
89 points over the previous six sessions, was up 7.47 points at
2,046.05 at noon on Wall Street.
   The dollar was quoted at around 122.68 Japanese yen in New York
trading, up from 122.24 yen late Wednesday. That had been the U.S.
currency's lowest close against the yen in New York trading since
modern exchange rates were established in the late 1940s.
   The government reported today that housing construction jumped
7.2 percent in October, the biggest increase in eight months.
   The Commerce Department said new homes and apartments were built
at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.55 million units last
month, up from a 1.45 million rate in September. All regions of the
nation, except the Northeast, had posted gains, it said.
   The huge increase followed a revised 0.8 percent decline in
September and a 1.1 percent drop in August. Previously, the
department said housing starts increased 1.5 percent in September
and fell 3.1 percent in August.
   The October jump was the biggest since a 9.9 percent increase in
February. Analysts had been expecting a decline of about 1 percent.
   In another report Wednesday, the Commerce Department said the
U.S. trade deficit narrowed by 17 percent in September, to $10.5
billion. But the figures refused to calm jittery financial markets.
   The dollar plunged Wednesday, bond prices slid and the stock
market tumbled to a 2{-month low in response to the report, which
indicated a smaller decline in the deficit than was expected by many
market participants and analysts.
   The dollar registered its lowest close against the Japanese yen
in New York trading since modern exchange rates were established in
the late 1940s, falling nearly 1 percent to 122.24 yen.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks dropped 38.59
points to 2,038.58, its lowest close since it stood at 2,002.31 on
Sept. 1.
   Overall exports rose in September by $700 million to a record
high $28.2 billion, the Commerce Department said. Imports declined
by 2.5 percent or $1.1 billion to $38.7 billion from a record high
in August.
   The $10.5 billion trade gap for September was down by $1.8
billion from the revised August trade deficit figure of $12.3
billion.
   But neither change was big enough to stem a new selling wave of
dollars by traders who were worried about inflation from an
overheating economy and skeptical of President-elect George Bush's
promise to reduce the federal budget deficit without any tax
increases.
   Many analysts had expected the trade deficit to drop below $10
billion in September, as it did in May and July.
   When it did not, ``more general concerns'' over the federal
budget deficit and the willingness of foreigners to keep financing
U.S. consumer habits triggered Wednesday's selling spree on
financial markets, said David Wyss, chief financial economist for
Data Resources Inc. of Lexington, Mass.
   ``Exports were up, imports were down. The reaction should have
been positive,'' Wyss said. ``Although the trade deficit has
improved, the improvement seems to have stalled out at about $11
billion (deficit) a month. Add to that figures on growth that we've
seen in the past couple of weeks and the market has good reason to
be pessimistic.''
   In other economic developments Wednesday:
   _The Federal Reserve Board reported that the operating rate at
U.S. factories, mines and utilities in October rose to the highest
level in 8{ years.
   _The Commerce Department said business inventories rose sharply
relative to sales in September, a sign of economic weakness.
Analysts discounted the significance of the report, noting that
sales have picked up since then.
   _The value of U.S. agricultural exports jumped 26 percent to a
four-year high of $35.2 billion in the fiscal year that ended Sept.
30, the Agriculture Department reported.

<HEAD>Miller Changes Ad Agency For Sagging High Life</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MILWAUKEE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Miller Brewing Co. is changing advertising
agencies for its flagship Miller High Life brand, whose sales have
been falling since the early part of the decade.
   Charles Schmid, senior vice president of marketing for Miller,
said Wednesday that Leo Burnett USA in Chicago would take over the
advertising of High Life from J. Walter Thompson, which has had the
account since 1985.
   Thompson has been given an undisclosed new product assignment and
will continue working on the Lowenbrau and Matilda Bay Cooler
accounts, Miller officials said.
   Schmid said Thompson's advertising campaign featuring the slogan,
``Stop and Taste the High Life,'' has done a good job strengthening
the product.
   ``It will now be Leo Burnett's challenge to create advertising
that builds strong sales momentum for the brand,'' he said.
   High Life's sales peaked in the early 1980s above 20 million
barrels, but fell below 10 million last year.
   Beer Marketer's Insights, an industry newsletter, said Miller
spent $15.7 million on the advertising account for the first six
months of this year. For all of 1987, Miller spent $25.3 million on
High Life, less than half the $67.7 million spent in 1986.

   MasterCard International on Thursday announced
the appointment of Los Angeles banker Alex W. ``Pete'' Hart as
president and chief executive officer of the giant credit-card
company.
   Hart, a former executive vice president at First Interstate
Bancorp and a MasterCard board member, replaces eight-year veteran
Russell E. Hogg, whose resignation takes effect Friday.
   MasterCard said Hart was elected by the board of the bankcard
association.
   Hart, 48, has an extensive bankground in the credit card business
and with MasterCard.
   He has been a MasterCard director since 1983 and a member of the
executive committee. He also was vice chairman of the board and
would have been chairman in 1989, the company said.
   At First Interstate, Hart ran the consumer banking operation in
Los Angeles. He served, among other things, as chairman of First
Interstate System Inc., the bank franchising subsidiary and First
Interstate Bancard Co. He also is vice chairman at Cirrus, an
international network of automated teller machines.
   MasterCard operates one of the world's largest credit-card
businesses in the world, with more than 150 million cardholders.

<HEAD>Dollar Ends Higher In Europe After Reported Intervention</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: An AMs version planned by 5:30 p.m. EDT</NOTE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. dollar ended slightly higher in hectic
European trading Thursday, pushed up by reported intervention by
U.S. and European central banks.
   Gold prices fell.
   The Bank of Japan intervened heavily during the Tokyo trading
day, but the intervention was largely shrugged off by the market,
dealers said.
   The U.S. Federal Reserve began to buy dollars for yen in the New
York morning, and the dollar-buying spree was quickly bolstered by
the entry of the Deutsche Bundesbank, and then the British, Swiss,
French, Italian, Austrian and other central banks, dealers said.
   The Bundesbank's participation added a lot of weight to the round
of intervention, since this is the first time the West German
central bank has intervened in the dollar's latest downward move,
dealers said.
   The intervention appeared to be moderate, but was spread widely
among banks in order to have the biggest impact possible for the
amount of money spent, they said.
   Dealers said they had expected concerted intervention to
materialize, especially after so many warnings in recent days by top
monetary officials, who either reiterated their desire for exchange
rate stability, or said they weren't in favor of a lower dollar.
   But although the intervention was expected to keep the dollar
steady for a while, dealers say they will soon be looking for a
chance to sell dollars again.
   In London, the dollar fell against the British pound. It cost
$1.8227 to buy one pound, lower than late Wednesday's $1.8225.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Wednesday:
1.7298 West German marks, up from 1.7230; 1.4518 Swiss francs, up
from 1.4465; 5.9075 French francs, up from 5.8975; 1.9560 Dutch
guilders, down from 1.9575; 1,291.75 Italian lire, up from 1,291.00;
and 1.2335 Canadian dollars, up from 1.2305.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day begins,
the dollar fell to 121.52 yen. Later, in London, it was quoted at
122.65 yen.
   Gold fell in London to a late bid price of $422.00 a troy ounce,
from $425.50 bid late Wednesday.
   In Zurich, gold fell to close at a bid $421.00 an ounce, compared
with $425.40 bid late Wednesday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold rose 65 cents to close at a bid
$424.34 an ounce.
   Silver bullion prices fell in London to a late bid price of $6.29
a troy ounce, compared with Wednesday's $6.39.

<HEAD>County Borrowing $100 Million From Japan</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In a unique 10-year deal, Los Angeles County
is borrowing $100 million from two Japanese lenders in what
officials described as a first between a foreign nation and a local
government entity.
   The county will borrow $100 million in yen under the arrangement
with the Nippon Life Insurance Co. and the Long Term Credit Bank of
Japan Ltd.
   ``This is our first borrowing in a foreign market and the first
state or local government borrowing of this nature,'' county Chief
Administrative Officer Richard B. Dixon said from Tokyo on Wednesday.
   ``We have been shopping for opportunities in the taxable market,
and this is the first and best opportunity we have found,'' said
Dixon.
   The county will invest the funds in ``high-grade debt
securities'' and use the profits to help reduce the unfunded
liability in the employees' retirement system, Dixon said.
   Dixon said a currency swap agreement will also allow the county
to repay the loan in dollars rather than yen as a hedge against any
risks if the foreign currency fluctuates.
   Because of the 1986 Tax Reform Act, the county has been seeking
alternatives to the domestic market. The law eliminated local
government's ability to issue tax-exempt pension bonds.
   Additionally, interest rates are lower. Dixon said the loan will
be repaid in dollars at the 10-year U.S. Treasury note rate, now
9.01 percent, plus .58 percent. At today's rates, these percentages
are lower than the U.S. prime rate of 10 percent.

   The decision by Continental Airlines and other
U.S. carriers to boost most of their lowest discount fares reflects
current strength in passenger traffic, analysts say.
   Several major airlines said Wednesday and today that they were
following Continental's revamping of the popular fares, used by most
vacation travelers. United Airlines, the nation's largest carrier,
is matching Continental's action throughout its route system, said
spokeswoman Sara Dornacker in Chicago. She said the average increase
on the so-called MaxSavers to be hiked would be around $15 each way.
   Other airlines matching the MaxSaver changes through their entire
systems include American Airlines, Delta Air Lines and Trans World
Airlines Inc.
   Northwest Airlines partially followed the action, changing around
30,000 MaxSaver fares between different cities, said Northwest
spokesman Red Tyler in Eagan, Minn. He said the Continental changes
involve more than 100,000 such fares.
   ``We continue to review the others,'' Tyler said. ``There is
still indecision in the industry.''
   Houston-based Continental notified travel agents on Tuesday night
and Wednesday that it would revamp its MaxSaver program to base
fares on the length of a flight. Competition on individual routes,
not mileage, had determined the fares in the past.
   Under the new formula, due to take effect next Wednesday,
MaxSaver fares for longer flights generally would be raised while
those for shorter hauls would mostly be reduced.
   The changes apparently raised about roughly two-thirds of
Continental's MaxSaver fares and cut the remaining MaxSavers.
   They followed by a few days plans initiated by Continental and
matched by other big airlines to drop another category of discount
air fares, the ``junk fares'' available four to seven days before a
flight and used mainly by business travelers.
   Like Continental, most of Northwest's fare changes were
increases, Tyler said. He said Northwest so far has only matched
Continental in the markets where the two airlines compete directly.
In other markets, Northwest will wait to see whether the other
carriers follow Continental's lead, Tyler said.
   The hikes in both advance-purchase MaxSavers and last-minute junk
fares reflect the recent trend toward higher air fares propelled by
increasing passenger traffic.
   ``Consumers definitely are paying higher prices,'' said Andrew
Geller, an airline analyst at Provident National Bank in
Philadelphia.
   Airline fares are up an average 8 percent from a year ago, he
said.
   Continental, which customarily has been a pacesetter in cutting
fares, has started to enjoy stronger traffic _ allowing it to switch
directions.
   The airline used to slash fares to attract more passengers, and
its moves quickly were mimicked by the other big carriers in an
effort to remain competitive. Now, Continental's improving traffic
has made it a leader in fare hikes rather than cuts, at least for
the moment.
   That has allowed Continental to switch its emphasis from filling
seats with cheap fares to offering better service, said Ned Walker,
a spokesman for the airline.
   ``Service has the utmost attention at Continental,'' he said.
``After safety, the focus is on service.''
   Walker cited monthly statistics compiled by the Department of
Transportation showing recent improvements in Continental's on-time
performance and other aspects of its service.
   Continental may be ``trying to position itself in the
price-service array'' by getting closer to full fares, suggested
John Pincavage, who follows the industry for PaineWebber Inc.
   He said the big test of the airlines' strength will come in
January and February, when passenger traffic is seasonally weak.

<HEAD>Soybeans Futures Plunge To 6-Month Low; Grains Follow</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soybean futures plunged to their lowest prices in
more than six months Thursday after cracking an important technical
resistance point.
   The grain markets followed soybeans lower with corn futures also
posting steep losses.
   Soybean prices had opened modestly lower in a continuation of the
downward trend that had characterized the market since late last
week. Analysts linked the early selling to heavy showers overnight
in soybean-producing areas of South America and to the relatively
slow pace of soybean sales for export.
   But analysts said selling accelerated as soybeans for delivery in
November approached $7.40 a bushel, the low of the market's last
significant bottom on July 28, and speculators pushed the price
through that important barrier.
   At the close, wheat was 1\ cents to 6{ cents lower with December
at $4.09 a bushel; corn was 2{ cents to 4} cents lower with December
at $2.59{ a bushel; oats were 2\ cents lower to 1{ cents higher with
December at $2.03 a bushel; and soybeans were 17\ cents to 25\ cents
lower with November at $7.19 a bushel.

   The stock market was mixed today after an early
rally faltered.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which had fallen nearly
89 points over the previous six sessions, rose 2.32 to 2,048.90 by 3
p.m. on Wall Street.
   But losers outnumbered gainers by about 3 to 2 in nationwide
trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 567 up, 842
down and 529 unchanged.
   Analysts said buying was encouraged by word that many central
banks around the world were moving to support the dollar in foreign
exchange.
   The dollar, which has fallen sharply in recent days, hovered
early today near post-World War II lows against the Japanese yen.
   Brokers also said some traders were ``bargain hunting'' among
stocks whose prices have fallen from their 1988 highs reached last
month.
   However, they added, enthusiasm for stocks continued to be
restrained by high yields available on short-term interest-bearing
investments such as Treasury bills.
   RJR Nabisco fell 3{ to 80{ as the most active Big Board issue
amid rumors and uneasiness about the prospective outcome of the
bidding for control of the company.
   Japanese stocks were strong as the Tokyo market hit new peaks.
Matsushita Electric, which projected a 28 percent increase in
consolidated net income for its current fiscal year, climbed 7{ to
192}.
   Honda Motor gained 5 to 157, and Kyocera 4\ to 79.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks lost
.16 to 148.80. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was down .95 at 285.35.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 118.37 million shares with an

<TEXT>
   Campbell Soup. Co. said Thursday its
first-quarter earnings fell 26.9 percent from results a year ago
which were swelled by a one-time accounting adjustment.
   The food company said excluding the accounting change, its
results were up 11.1 percent compared with a year ago.
   Net earnings for the three months ended Oct. 30 fell to $69.4
million, or 54 cents per share, compared with $94.9 million, or 73
cents a share, a year ago. The 1987 results included an accounting
change for income taxes that added $32.5 million, or 25 cents a
share, to net income for the quarter.
   Without the change, the company would have reported a profit of
$62.4 million, or 48 cents a share, in the first three months of
1987.
   Revenue for the quarter rose 13 percent to $1.33 billion from
$1.18 billion a year earlier.
   The company said operating earninbgs rose 21 percent at Campbell
U.S.A., the Camden-based firm's largest division.
   It said its V8 vegetable juice had a 50 percent increase in
volume, while Prego spaghetti sauce increased 27 percent and
Franco-American pasta 12 percent.
   ``Increased soup marketing efforts to consumers are expected to
increase per capita consumption this year, although first-quarter
soup sales were flat because of promotional timing differences,''
Campbell President R. Gordon McGovern said.
   McGovern said several acquisitions last year helped boost sales.
Marie's salad dressing sparked a 39 percent in the company's fresh
product unit, while the volume of Vlasic Foods increased by 36
percent.
   Reflecting the acquisition of Freshbake, a United Kingdom-based
frozen foods business, Campbell International had a 30 percent
increase in sales and operating earnings increased 13 percent.

<HEAD>Payment To Continental Angers Eastern Labor Leader</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A union leader was angered to learn that Eastern
Airlines, which must request rescheduling of $300 million in loans,
has made multimillion-dollar payments to its non-union sister
carrier, Continental Airlines.
   ``We're talking about $50 million more that is being upstreamed,
and yet they continue going out and telling the world this horror
story about their financial problems,'' Charles E. Bryan told a
meeting of labor leaders Wednesday.
   Bryan is president of the Machinists local at Eastern, the
airline's largest union. Eastern and Continental are both
subsidiaries of Texas Air Corp., the nation's biggest airline
company.
   Eastern's latest quarterly filing with the Securities and
Exchange Commission showed it paid Continental $17.5 million in
September for frequent flier redemptions. It also paid $19 million
to Houston-based Continental for strike contingency services.
   Bryan also was critical of a $21.1 million loan from Eastern to
Bar Harbour Airlines, a commuter carrier that is another Texas Air
subsidiary.
   Eastern spokesman Robin Matell called the $17.5 million frequent
flier payment to Continental ``a perfectly legitimate transaction''
under the two airlines' joint frequent flier program, because more
Eastern frequent fliers were redeeming their award certificates with
Continental than the other way around.
   Texas Air announced recently that the strike contingency program
is being discontinued because management doesn't consider an Eastern
strike likely. Eastern's Machinists and management have been in
federal mediation over the union's contract since January.
   Bryan and other union leaders at Eastern say Texas Air Chairman
Frank Lorenzo has been bleeding away Eastern's assets since he took
control two years ago. Eastern has paid Texas Air tens of millions
of dollars in management fees, along with fees for use of the
computerized reservations system that formerly belonged to Eastern
and is a separate Texas Air subsidiary.
   Bryan has urged Lorenzo to sell Eastern to an employee-backed
group. Financier Carl Icahn, the owner and chairman of Trans World
Airlines Inc., recently expressed interest in buying Eastern and met
with representatives of the Machinists and other Eastern unions.
   Eastern's SEC report also said Texas Air paid $16 million in
expenses to Eastern left over from its 1986 takeover.
   Eastern, awaiting government approval of a $365 million sale of
its northeastern shuttle to New York developer Donald Trump, said it
must make such asset sales to stay alive, unless it can reduce labor
costs. Eastern has reported $233 million in net losses in the first
three quarters of this year.
   Eastern officials plan to meet Friday with French, British and
West German lenders to renegotiate the airline's debt payments to
avoid a technical default that could result in lenders demanding
quicker payments of the loans.
   ``This situation has happened in the past,'' said Eastern
spokeswoman Karen Ceremsak. ``We don't expect it to be a problem.''

<HEAD>Reuters To Sell Visnews Stake to NBC</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Reuters Holdings PLC, the British news and
information services company, is selling a 37.75 percent stake in
its Visnews television news agency to the National Broadcasting Co.
for about $10 million, the companies said Thursday.
   Reuters will issue new Visnews shares to NBC, which is owned by
General Electric Co. of Fairfield, Conn., and operates the NBC
television network, the companies said.
   That will reduce Reuters' stake in Visnews from 88.75 percent to
51 percent while British Broadcasting Co. will continue to hold the
remaining 11.25 percent, they said.
   Under the agreement, NBC will supply Visnews with all its news
programming for broadcasting worldwide for a 10-year period, they
said.
   At the same time, Visnews will supply its news programming to NBC
for broadcasting in the United States, they said.
   NBC and Visnews camera crews are to work closely together
throughout the world, they said.
   Michael Nelson, chairman of Visnews and general manager of
Reuters, said in a statement, ``This alliance of NBC, the leading
U.S. TV network, the BBC and Reuters, the world's largest electronic
publisher, is a major new force in international TV news.''
   Robert C. Wright, president of NBC, said, ``We look forward to
working with our partners, Reuters and the BBC, in what will clearly
be the world's premier global news gathering agency.'
   In New York, NBC spokesman Joe Rutledge said the deal would allow
NBC to cut back on its hiring of free-lancers for foreign news
coverage and give it more flexibility in deploying its own crews. He
said it could ultimately affect fewer than 20 NBC news jobs overseas.
   Separately, Visnews said it has signed a five-year contract with
Rupert Murdoch's Sky Television to provide news programming for its
24-hour Sky News channel in Britain. The contract is valued at about
$55 million.
   Visnews, which was formed in 1957, provides over 400 broadcasting
organizations in 84 countries a daily service seen on an estimated
470 million television sets.

   Ray Cave is resigning as editorial director of
Time Inc. after 30 years with the magazine publishing company, Time
editor-in-chief Jason McManus announced Thursday.
   Cave has been editorial director, second highest editorial
position in the company, since April 1987. The resignation is
effective at year's end.
   Louis J. Slovinsky, a Time Inc. spokesman, said Cave, 59,
resigned after he told McManus that he wanted to work vigorously
until at least age 65. Cave asked McManus what sort of role he could
expect over the next six years and when McManus could not answer in
a way that was reassuring to Cave, Cave's resignation was accepted,
Slovinsky said.
   Cave was a reporter and editor on the Baltimore Evening Sun
before coming to Time's Sports Illustrated as a reporter in 1959. He
rose to executive editor of the magazine, then transferred to Time
magazine, where he was managing editor from 1977 to September 1985.
His next post was corporate editor of Time Inc., then editorial
director.
   McManus lauded Cave as a striver for excellence who ``shape our
magazines to be the best.''

<TEXT>
   Presidential Airways announced Thursday that it
is buying 16 turboprop aircraft from Boeing Co.'s Canada deHavilland
Division for $180 million.
   The first of the 50-seat Boeing deHavilland Dash 8-300 planes is
scheduled to be delivered to the commuter airline next summer and
the remainder in l990 and l991, Presidential said.
   Presidential Chairman Harold ``Hap'' Pareti said the new aircraft
will allow it to carry more passengers on some of Presidential's
current flights, where it now flies a 19-seat aircraft, and allow it
to open new markets.
   The airline announced earlier this week a profit for the second
consecutive quarter after losing $88 million since l985 when it
began operating.
   Presidential's operations are concentrated through its hub at
Dulles International Airport outside of Washington, where it serves
as a feeder for United Airlines, which also has its major East Coast
hub at Dulles. Presidential flies under the name United Express.
   The addition of the Dash 8-300 aircraft will give Presidential
added flexibility in matching its aircraft with market size. It
already owns eight 90-seat British Aerospace BAe-146s as well as 14
smaller planes capable of carrying l9 passengers.
   Pareti said the new Dash 8-300s will be used on flights within
300 miles of Dulles airport, probably into North and South Carolina,
the Ohio Valley and Connecticut.

   Assets of the nation's 454 money market mutual
funds rose $4.53 billion to a near-record level in the latest week,
the Investment Company Institute said Thursday.
   The rise, to $279.22 billion in the seven-day period ended
Wednesday, followed a revised $2.67 billion increase in the funds'
assets the previous week, according to the Washington-based mutual
fund trade group.
   The funds' assets hit a record high $280.02 billion in the week
ended Feb. 24.
   The Investment Company Institute said that in the latest week,
assets of 223 general purpose funds rose $1.82 billion to $89.04
billion, assets of 100 broker-dealer funds increased $1.2 billion to
$117.31 billion, and assets of 131 institutional funds rose $1.5
billion to $72.87 billion.
   The seven-day average yield on money market mutual funds rose in
the week ended Tuesday to 7.60 percent from 7.56 percent the
previous week, according to Donoghue's Money Fund Report, a trade
journal based in Holliston, Mass.
   The 30-day average yield rose to 7.57 percent from 7.53 percent,
Donoghue's said.
   The average maturity of the portfolios held by money funds was 37
days, down from 38 days, Donoghue's said.
   Separately, the newsletter Bank Rate Monitor said its survey of
100 leading commercial banks, savings and loan assocations and
savings banks in the nation's 10 largest markets showed the
effective annual yield available on money market accounts was
unchanged for the second week at 6.08 percent as of Wednesday.
   The North Palm Beach, Fla.-based newsletter said the effective
annual yield available on special savings accounts, called Super NOW
accounts, also was unchanged from a week earlier at 5.12 percent.
   Bank Rate Monitor said the effective annual yield was 7.88
percent on six-month certificates of deposit, up from 7.84 the
previous week. Yields were 8.17 percent on 1-year CDs, up from 8.14
percent; 8.35 percent on 2{-year CDs, up from 8.32 percent; and 8.55
percent on 5-year CDs, unchanged from the previous week.

bullion was bid at $419.75 an ounce at 4 p.m. EST, down from $423.60
late Wednesday.
   Traders said the central banks stepped into the foreign exchange
markets in force to buy up dollars a day after the U.S. currency had
sunk to near historic lows.
   In Tokyo, where the trading day begins, the dollar fell to 121.52
yen, nearly a 40-year low, despite heavy intervention by the Bank of
Japan.
   Later, in London, the dollar moved to 122.65 yen, and then in New
York it settled at 122.155 yen, off slightly from late Wednesday's
122.24.
   The dollar's lack of response against the yen was attributed to
the frequency of the Bank of Japan's recent intervention in the
market. Buying by European central banks, which intensified through
the day, was more unusual and helped the U.S. currency move higher
against most other major currencies in late New York trading.
   The participation of the Bundesbank was particularly important
since it was the first time West Germany's central bank had
intervened in the dollar's recent decline, traders noted.
   It was the most widespread intervention in the market since a big
sell-off of dollars last April in reaction to a bad monthly trade
report.
   Although the trade deficit showed modest improvement in the
latest report issued Wednesday, the dollar sustained heavy losses
nonetheless. Wednesday's slide convinced some traders that
intervention by the central banks was inevitable.
   ``The market had been expecting it for some time,'' said Stephen
Leach, currency analyst for Chemical Bank in New York. ``The
question was when.''
   Leach noted the timing of the intervention also coincided with
the Treasury's auction of $9 billion in new 30-year bonds Thursday.
Some analysts who follow the credit markets had feared that the
dollar's recent weakness would scare foreign investors away from the
auction.
   But analysts said more intervention would be necessary to
stabilize the dollar. The market is also looking for clear policy
statements from President-elect George Bush on what his
administration will do to cut the trade and budget deficits.
   Worries about the twin deficits have kept pressure on the dollar
since the election was decided last week.
   The dollar fell against the British pound in London, where it
cost $1.8227 to buy one pound, more than late Wednesday's $1.8225.
But the pound fetched $1.82875 in late New York trading, less than
$1.83375 late Wednesday.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Wednesday
were 1.7230 West German marks, up from 1.7164; 1.4470 Swiss francs,
up from 1.4422; 1.23075 Canadian dollars, up from 1.2296; 5.8915
French francs, up from 5.8770; and 1,283.75 Italian lire, up from
1,277.75.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Wednesday:
1.7298 West German marks, up from 1.7230; 1.4518 Swiss francs, up
from 1.4465; 5.9075 French francs, up from 5.8975; 1.9560 Dutch
guilders, down from 1.9575; 1,291.75 Italian lire, up from 1,291.00;
and 1.2335 Canadian dollars, up from 1.2305.
   Among precious metals prices on the New York Commodity Exchange,
gold bullion for current delivery slipped to $420.10 an ounce,
compared with $424.50 late Wednesday.
   Gold fell in London to a late bid price of $422.00 a troy ounce,
from $425.50 bid late Wednesday. In Zurich, gold fell to $421.00 an
ounce, compared with $425.40 bid late Wednesday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold rose 65 cents to $424.34 an ounce.
   Silver bullion for current delivery was quoted at the Comex at
$6.170 an ounce, down from $6.277 late Wednesday. Silver prices fell
in London to a late bid price of $6.29 a troy ounce, compared with
Wednesday's $6.39.

   OPEC oil ministers gathered Thursday to
start a series of meetings considered crucial to capping the
cartel's runaway production and bolstering world crude prices.
   But analysts and industry experts have expressed skepticism that
the meetings would produce a substantive accord leading to immediate
or long-lasting output restraints.
   Doubts grew when ministers adjourned after an hour saying they
would hold separate talks on Friday and possibly reconvene again on
Saturday.
   Eight ministers from OPEC's price and strategy committees were
faced with the tough problem of designing a new production agreement
that would allot quotas under a formula acceptable to all members.
   The committees' recommendations are to be presented to a full
meeting of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries when
oil ministers from all 13 nations gather on Monday.
   Indonesian Energy Minister Ginandjar Kartasasmita told reporters
he was optimistic the ministers would succeed in their task.
   Ginandjar, who recently visited some of the other cartel
countries, said, ``Everybody ... expressed their concern for the
level of prices,'' which have hurt their economies.
   He said he was hopeful that ``all parties will do their best to
reach a solution,'' adding: ``There is ground for negotiation and
for eventual agreement.''
   But he acknowledged the going would not be easy. ``We have to
work very hard,'' he said.
   Industry experts, however, have said they doubt the meetings will
produce results this time around.
   ``OPEC remains in disarray and the likelihood of market stability
at reasonable oil price levels appears less promising today than it
did a year ago,'' Richard M. Morrow, chairman of the American
Petroleum Institute, told a gathering of analyts and experts this
week.
   Morrow said that even if OPEC reaches an agreement on new quotas,
the industry is skeptical it ``will last for more than a few months
_ if that long.''
   Adding to the skepticism were reports this week that some senior
OPEC officials were already looking beyond the current talks to
possible meetings next year to resolve the quota dispute between
Iran and Iraq, which is considered the main stumbling block to an
accord.
   A key problem facing the ministers is bringing Iraq back into the
quota system.
   OPEC set production ceilings based on a December 1986 arrangement
limiting total output at about 15 million barrels a day. That
excludes Iraq, which has ignored its quota because it was not given
parity with Iran, its foe in an eight-year war that ended with a
cease-fire in August.
   Analysts say most of the cartel members have exceeded their
quotas in recent months, adding to the glut in the world market.
   Prices have fallen to $4 or more below the cartel's benchmark
price of $18 per 42-gallon barrel.
   The International Energy Agency estimated in its Monthly Oil
Market Report that the cartel's production jumped to almost 21.1
million barrels a day in October, the highest monthly output in more
than five years.
   Analysts differ on the amount that OPEC would have to reduce its
output to eliminate the excess and boost oil prices, with opinions
ranging from 2 million to 4 million barrels a day.
   Iraq, in refusing its quota of 1.5 million barrels a day, said it
wanted to have the same ceiling of 2.4 million barrels as Iran.
Since the cease-fire went into effect, negotiations have been under
way to bring Iraq back into the quota system.
   Iraqi Oil Minister Issam Abdul Raheem al-Chalabi told reporters
before the closed-door meeting began Thursday: ``It's very clear our
position hasn't changed.''
   Iran had proposed that its quota reflect a higher domestic demand
of some 1 million barrels a day. Iraqi internal demand is estimated
at 300,000 barrels a day, the source said.
   Analysts estimate Iraq has been producing at least 2.6 million
barrels a day, an amount that could hit 3.7 million barrels next
year with completion of a new pipeline through Saudi Arabia to the
Red Sea.

<HEAD>Business Week Survey Ranks Northwestern's Business School As Tops</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Northwestern University's J.L. Kellogg Graduate
School of Management has the country's best MBA program, beating out
such powerhouses as Harvard and Wharton, Business Week magazine said
in a survey released Thursday.
   The survey, which appears in the Nov. 28 issue of the news
weekly, also said that among other surprises, the graduate business
schools of Cornell and Dartmouth made its top five, while Stanford
and the University of Chicago, usually near the top of other
rankings, finished lower.
   Business Week said its survey was based on random polling of
about 3,000 1988 graduates of 23 schools that often comprise
conventional top-20 lists, which usually put Harvard and Wharton
first.
   The magazine said it received 1,245 replies to a 35-item
questionnaire, about 42 percent of those sampled and about 15
percent of all full-time MBA graduates of those schools in 1988.
   It said questions concerned quality of teaching, curriculum,
environment and job-placement efforts on a scale of 1 to 10.
   A separate poll of corporate recruiters also was factored into
the rankings, the magazine said.
   Northwestern's Kellogg School, based in Evanston, Ill., emerged
as the favorite of corporate recruiters and garnered some of the
highest grades from graduates, earning it the No. 1 spot.
   Here in order are the top 20 schools in the Business Week list
with the names of the business schools in parentheses:
   1. Northwestern
   2. Harvard
   3. Dartmouth
   4. Pennsylvania (Wharton)
   5. Cornell
   6. Michigan
   7. Virginia
   8. North Carolina
   9. Stanford
   10. Duke

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The two broadest measures of the nation's money
supply rose in the week ended Nov. 7, the Federal Reserve Board
reported Thursday.
   The Fed said the measure known as M2 rose to a seasonally
adjusted $3,046.2 billion in the week ended Nov. 7 from $3,039.5
billion the previous week.
   An even broader measure, M3, increased to a seasonally adjusted
$3,878.1 billion from $3,870.0 billion.
   The narrowest measure of the money supply, M1, fell to a
seasonally adjusted $781.6 billion from a revised $784.6 billion.
   M1 includes cash in circulation, deposits in checking accounts
and non-bank travelers checks. M2 is M1 plus accounts like savings
deposits and money-market mutual funds. M3 is M2 plus less-liquid
accounts, such as certificates of deposit in minimum denominations
of $100,000.
   In judging its monetary policy, the Fed has indicated it is
monitoring the value of the dollar, commodity prices and the
difference between short- and long-term interest rates. It also has
shifted its attention from M1 to the two broader money supply
measures
   For the latest 13 weeks, M1 averaged $782.9 billion, a 2.9
percent seasonally adjusted annual rate of gain from the previous 13
weeks.
   The Fed said in mid-1988 that it reaffirmed its target for annual
growth in M2 and M3 at between 4 percent and 8 percent, which is
slightly lower than the 1987 target of 5.5 percent to 8.5 percent.
The Fed has not set a specific target range for M1 since early 1987.
   In other reports:
   _The Federal Reserve Bank of New York reported commercial and
industrial loans at major New York City banks fell $59 million,
compared with a gain of $1.18 billion a week earlier.
   _The Federal Reserve said bank borrowings from the Federal
Reserve System at the discount window averaged $540 million, up from
$251 million a week earlier.
   _The Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis reported that the monetary
base, the seasonally adjusted total of member bank reserves held at
Federal Reserve banks and cash in bank vaults and in circulation,
was $284.4 billion in the two-week period ended Wednesday, up from
$283.5 billion two weeks earlier.

<HEAD>Soybean Market Collapses To 6-Month Low</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Soybean futures prices plunged to their lowest levels in more
than six months Thursday after cracking an important resistance
point.
   On other markets, grain, cotton, precious metals, energy,
livestock, meat and stock-index futures all were lower while copper
futures advanced.
   Soybeans for delivery in November settled at $7.19{ a bushel on
the Chicago Board of Trade, a loss of 25} cents from Wednesday's
final price. It was the lowest settlement price for a near-month
soybean contract since May 13, when the May contract finished at
$7.19{.
   Soybean prices had opened modestly lower in a continuation of the
downward trend that has characterized the market since late last
week. Analysts linked the early selling to heavy showers overnight
in soybean-producing areas of South America and to the relatively
slow pace of soybean sales for export.
   But selling accelerated as November soybeans approached $7.40 a
bushel, a price not seen since July 28, and speculators pushed the
price through that important barrier.
   ``When you hit that level, you started seeing a lot of
liquidation in the market,'' said Cathy Leow, an assistant vice
president of Thomson McKinnon Securities Inc. in New York.
   Wheat settled 1{ cents to 6{ cents lower with the contract for
delivery in December at $4.09\ a bushel; corn was 3\ cents to 5
cents lower with December at $2.59\ a bushel; oats were } cents to
1\ cents lower with December at $2.04 a bushel; and soybeans were
17} cents to 25} cents lower with November at $7.19{ a bushel.
   Cotton futures finished sharply lower on the New York Cotton
Exchange in a technically inspired sell-off.
   Analyst Ernest Simon of Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. said the
cotton market was due for a correction.
   ``The fundamentals have been bearish for a long time,'' he said.
``We've got large crops throughout the world and we have a slower
offtake (from existing stocks) than we had last season. In spite of
that, the market has gone up and stayed up. Now it's finally coming
down,'' he said.
   Cotton settled 1.5 cents to 1.75 cents lower with December at
53.20 cents a pound.
   Copper futures rebounded strongly on New York's Commodity
Exchange after falling for four of the five previous sessions.
   Analysts attributed the rise to renewed supply concerns prompted
by reports of production problems at a state-owned mine in Chile and
the terrorist bombing of the Peruvian Mine Owners Association
offices in Lima, Peru.
   Copper settled 1.5 cents to 5.3 cents higher with December at
$1.333 a pound.
   Silver futures prices fell sharply for the third straight day on
New York's Commodity Exchange as the market adjusted to recent
losses in the gold market and to its own bearish fundamentals, said
James Steel, an analyst with Refco Inc. in New York.
   Silver settled 11 cents to 11.8 cents lower with December at
$6.19 a troy ounce; gold was $4 to $4.50 lower with December at
$421.10 a troy ounce.
   Energy futures weakened substantially on growing pessimism about
OPEC's ability to reach an agreement to limit crude-oil output and
force prices higher, analysts said.
   Oil ministers of the 13 members of the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries gathered Thursday in Vienna to start a series of
meetings on capping their runaway production.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 38 cents to 91 cents
lower with December at $13.29 a barrel; heating oil was 1.50 cents
to 1.86 cents lower with December at 42.97 cents a gallon; unleaded
gasoline was .85 cent to 1.99 cents lower with December at 45.65
cents a gallon.
   Cattle futures fell sharply late in the session on the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange, pressured by aggressive speculative selling on
bearish technical signals, analysts said.
   Expectations of a seasonal decline in demand for beef also
contributed to the sell-off.
   A surge of last-minute selling drove hog futures to a sharply
lower close while weakening cash markets weighed on both the hogs
and the pork bellies, analysts said.
   Live cattle settled .50 cent to 1.17 cents lower with December at
72.67 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .02 cent to .75 cent lower
with November at 81.67 cents a pound; live hogs were .38 cent to
1.10 cents lower with December at 40.70 cents a pound; frozen pork
bellies were .78 cent to .90 cent lower with February at 43.65 cents
a pound.
   Stock-index futures retreated slightly on the Chicago Merc, where
the contract for December delivery of the Standard & Poor's 500
settled .40 point lower at 264.65.

   MCI Communications Corp. said Thursday it is
launching a major campaign to claim a piece of the $2 billion-a-year
market in long-distance calls from pay telephones.
   The marketing drive is an effort to capitalize on a recent
federal court ruling that ordered the local Bell operating companies
to stop discriminating in favor of American Telephone & Telegraph
Co. on collect, third-party and coin-paid long-distance calls placed
from public phones and calls charged to Bell company credit cards.
   The court ordered the Bell companies by Jan. 1 to let owners and
managers of public pay phones choose a long-distance carrier.
   MCI, the nation's second-largest long-distance company after
AT&T, said it will offer a full range of basic operator services to
pay phone users beginning next year. Also, non-MCI customers using
pay phones pre-subscribed to MCI would be able to use Bell calling
cards.
   The company said it will target its campaign at owners and
managers of pay phones at airports, hotels, universities, government
agencies, convention centers and other facilities with large amounts
of pay phone use.

<BYLINE>By MARTIN CRUTSINGER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United States and its major economic allies
successfully intervened Thursday to halt a slide in the value of the
dollar, but economists predicted that the Federal Reserve will be
forced to boost U.S. interest rates in a further defense of the
beleaguered U.S. greenback.
   The coordinated intervention in the currency markets by the
United States, Japan, West Germany, England, France, Italy and
Canada was the most widespread dollar rescue effort since last April
when the markets were stampeded into a dollar sell-off following a
bad monthly trade report.
   Despite the success of Thursday's rescue effort, many traders
foresaw renewed selling pressure in the months ahead because of
fears that President-elect George Bush and the new Congress will be
unable to reach agreement on ways to trim the budget deficit.
   Investors are concerned that the enlarged Democratic majorities
in Congress and Bush's tough no-tax stance guarantee further
budgetary gridlock.
   For this reason, many economists predicted the Federal Reserve
will be forced in coming weeks to begin pushing interest rates
higher in the United States. Some analysts said they would not rule
out an increase in the discount rate, the interest the Fed charges
to make loans to member banks.
   A boost in the discount rate is the most dramatic signal the Fed
can send of its intention of driving interest rates higher.
   Higher interest rates make dollar-denominated investments more
attractive to foreigners and help relieve the pressure to sell off
such assets. Higher interest rates also dampen inflationary
pressures brought on by a weaker currency.
   Intervention is the process by which the Federal Reserve or other
countries' central banks buy and sell currencies in an attempt to
influence the market price.
   The intervention Thursday was begun by the Bank of Japan, which
started buying dollars after the U.S. currency fell to near 40-year
lows in trading in Tokyo.
   After the initial purchases by the Bank of Japan, currency
traders reported that the central banks of the major European allies
of the United States bought dollars, followed by buying by the U.S.
central bank.
   The concerted dollar-buying helped to push the U.S. currency up
to 122.155 yen at the close of trading in New York, off slightly
from Wednesday's close of 123.54 yen. It had closed at 121.52 yen in
Tokyo, after having dropped as low as 121.30 during the Tokyo
trading day.
   But traders said they doubted the joint intervention effort would
have more than a temporary restaining effect on the downward
pressure on the dollar.
   ``This will only provide temporary relief,'' said William Hand, a
trader at First Pennsylvania Bank in Philadelphia. ``The market
wants to see some concrete kind of plan on how the budget deficit is
going to be solved.''
   Robert Hormats, an economist with Goldman, Sachs, predicted that
the currency markets and the stock and bond markets would continue
to be in turmoil between now and Bush's inauguration on Jan. 20.
   ``I think the market has confidence in the economic team Bush is
putting together, but the market is impatient because the budget and
trade imbalances are so big,'' he said.
   Market unrest already has prompted Bush and Treasury Secretary
Nicholas Brady, who will stay on in the Bush administration, to
issue reassuring statements that the new administration considers
cutting the budget deficit to be a top priority.
   On Wednesday, Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan added the
strongest voice yet to calls for urgent action on the deficit,
telling the National Economic Commission that the deficit, which
climbed to $155.1 billion in the last fiscal year, ``already has
begun to eat away at the foundations of our economic strength.''
   However, Bush spokeswoman Sheila Tate, asked about Greenspan's
warning, said, ``Economists never agree on anything. For every
economist you cite we can trot out one who is diametrically in
opposition.''
   David Wyss, chief financial economist for Data Resources Inc.,
called Tate's remarks on ABC-TV's ``Good Morning America''
surprising, given the need for the new administration to present a
united front with the central bank to reassure jittery markets.
   ``The market right now is looking for some reassurance that
something is going to be done about the federal budget deficit and
about the trade deficit,'' Wyss said. ``They are afraid that the
Bush administration is more willing to solve the deficit by letting
the dollar fall than by cutting the budget deficit.''
   While a weaker dollar makes U.S. goods less expensive on overseas
markets and imports more expensive for Americans, Bush has insisted
that he does not plan to abandon the two-year Reagan effort to
stabilize the dollar's value.
   Wyss said that with the uncertainty in currency markets, the Fed
soon will start pushing interest rates higher.
   ``I think the Fed will have to let interest rates edge upward,''
he said, predicting that tighter monetary policy could trigger an
increase in banks' prime lending rate by next month.
   Lyle Gramley, a former member of the Fed board and now chief
economist of the Mortgage Bankers Association, said the central bank
was likely to make behind-the-scenes moves to nudge rates higher in
coming weeks but would wait until January for something as dramatic
as a boost in the discount rate, unless the dollar threatened to
tumble into a free-fall.
   ``They would like to wait before tightening further, but the
exchange markets may force the Fed's hand,'' he said.

<HEAD>Bond Prices Fall</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bond prices fell Thursday, pressured by the
weaker dollar and growing concerns about inflation.
   The Treasury's closely watched 30-year bond declined 21-32 point,
or about $6.50 for every $1,000 of face value.
   Its yield, which moves inversely to its price and is a key
indicator of interest rate trends, rose to 9.17 percent from 9.11
percent late Wednesday.
   Analysts said bond prices continued to weaken in the face of a
declining U.S. currency.
   ``The bond market took its cue from the dollar,'' said Irwin L.
Kellner, chief economist at Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co.
   Also contributing to weaker bond prices was a government report
that housing construction in October posted the biggest increase in
eight months. The Commerce Department said new construction rose 7.2
percent last month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.55
million units from its September level.
   Both a weaker dollar and stronger housing statistics suggest
stronger inflationary pressures. Inflation erodes the value of bonds.
   Meanwhile, the Treasury sold $9 billion in 30-year bonds at an
average yield of 9.10 percent, down from 9.17 percent at the last
30-year auction on May 12. It was the lowest rate since 30-year
bonds averaged 8.51 percent at the Feb. 4 auction.
   The 30-year bond auction was postponed for a week because the
Treasury previously had sold nearly as many of the bonds as Congress
had authorized.
   But, tax legislation signed by President Reagan on Nov. 11 lifted
the limits, paving the way for Thursday's auction.
   In the secondary market for Treasury bonds, prices of short-term
government issues were 3-32 to 7-32 point lower, intermediate
maturities slipped between \ point and 15-32 point and 20-year
issues lost | point, according to figures provided by Telerate Inc.,
a financial information service.
   The movement of a point is equivalent to a change of $10 in the
price of a bond with a $1,000 face value.
   The Shearson Lehman Daily Treasury Bond Index, which measures
price movements on all outstanding Treasury issues with maturities
of a year or longer, declined 3.47 to 1,134.25.
   Corporate bonds fell. Moody's Investment Grade Corporate Bond
Index, which measures price movements on 80 corporate bonds with
maturities of five years or longer, had edged down 0.64 to 293.60.
   Municipal bonds held steady. The Bond Buyers Municipal Bond
Index, which measures the prices on 40 long-term bonds, was

   Shareholders of Amfac Inc., Hawaii's largest
private landowner, on Thursday approved a $49 a share cash buyout
valued at $920 million by Chicago-based JMB Realty.
   The acquistion by JMB, America's largest real estate syndicator
and a manager of $20 billion in U.S. and Canadian properties, will
be consummated Friday in Hawaii, Amfac announced.
   Amfac common stock trading on the New York and Pacific Stock
exchanges will be suspended as of the opening of business Monday.
   The acquisition was approved by 86.6 percent of shareholders.
   Amfac chief officer and president Richard L. Griffith said, ``We
are delighted with the outcome of (Thursday's) meeting, which
demonstrates the support of our shareholders for our efforts to
maximize their investment in Amfac. We now look forward to a new,
rewarding association with JMB.''
   Neil G. Bluhm, president of JMB, said, ``...We're delighted to
become associated with a premier Hawaii-based land, retail and
resort company. Amfac has a long and proud history...this
acquisition marks JMB's first venture in Hawaii, the hub of
burgeoning Pacific rim economy.''
   The Hawaiian conglomerate owns or leases 151,000 acres, much of
it used to grow sugar cane, and also has interests in retailing,
resorts, agriculture, property management and electrical
distribution. Amfac's Hawaii-based Liberty House department store
alone has been valued at around $250 million.
   JMB has invested nearly $4.5 billion for several major real
estate businesses in recent years. With the acquisition of Amfac,
JMB now handles 2,000 acres of land for development in Hawaii.
   Amfac began as a Hawaiian sugar company more than a century ago.
Deals leading to Thursday's acquisition by JMB included an
unsuccessful management-led proposal for an $800 million leveraged
buy-out.

   Allegheny International Inc.'s board has agreed
to a buyout proposal from the investment firm Donaldson Lufkin &
Jenrette Securities Corp., Allegheny chairman Oliver S. Travers said
Thursday.
   The agreement, which is subject to bankruptcy court approval,
would keep intact Allegheny International's flagship Sunbeam-Oster
division.
   Under the agreement, the Pittsburgh-based appliance and consumer
products maker will be merged with a corporation formed by Donaldson
Lufkin & Jenrette which will invest $55 million for a 60 percent
stake in the new entity.
   The proposal would give Allegheny shareholders 40 percent of the
stock in the new company as well as $20 million in preferred stock.
   The plan also called for distribution to claimants of about
$744.7 million, including about $695 million in cash and $49.6
million in securities.
   Allegheny International has been operating under protection of
the federal bankruptcy laws, and Bankruptcy Judge Joseph Cosetti had
given the board until Thursday to select between DLJ's proposal and
one from a New York merchant bank.
   Last week, the merchant banker Gilliam Joseph Littlejohn and Levy
proposed a leveraged buyout that included selling the Sunbeam-Oster
division. The move would have reduced Allegheny International's size
in half, leaving it as a maker of lawn furniture, barbecue grills,
electric blankets, weather instruments and bathroom scales.
   The bank offered $662 million in cash and $41 million in notes
and securities. The bank would contribute $50 million in cash for 65
percent of the stock of the reorganized company.
   The merger will take place according to a reorganization plan
that will permit Allegheny International to settle claims against it
and emerge from bankruptcy protection.

<HEAD>Small Production Company Bids for Movie Maker in Chapter 11</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A new TV production company, Ventura
Entertainment Group, entered the bidding Thursday for De Laurentiis
Entertainment Group Inc., a movie-maker operating under the
protection of federal bankruptcy court.
   Ventura Entertainment announced it had offered $35 million in
cash and equity for De Laurentiis, which was founded by Italian
filmmaker Dino De Laurentiis.
   Ventura Entertainment Chairman Harvey Bibicoff refused to
disclose how much of the offer was in cash.
   At least three other entertainment companies have expressed
interest in buying the assets of De Laurentiis, whose productions
have included a remake of ``King Kong.''
   A De Laurentiis spokesman referred questions about the bid to the
company's investment banker, Oppenheimer & Co., whose Los Angeles
office did not respond to requests for comment Thursday afternoon.
   Any transaction would require the approval of De Laurentiis
creditors and the U.S. Bankruptcy Court. De Laurentiis, which lost
$478,000 in the second quarter, filed for protection from its
creditors under Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy Code in
mid-August.
   Ventura, an Encino-based public company, was formed six months
ago by producer Irwin Meyer, former Columbia Pictures executive
Stephen Girard and Bibicoff. Its only finished project is
``International Celebration of the Piano,'' a concert film for
television.
   De Laurentiis' assets include North Carolina Film Studios in
Wilmington, N.C., which is rented out for various productions; Onyx
Entertainment, which holds the rights to various scripts, and United
States rights to show the studio's library of 350 movies, including
``The Graduate'' and ``Carnal Knowledge.''
   Other bidders divulged by the company are troubled moviemaker
Cannon Group Inc., videodisk producer Image Entertainment Inc. and
Atlantic Entertainment Group.

<HEAD>Magazine: Record Number of Mergers and Acquisitions Expected in
1988</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PHILDELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   There were 28 mergers and acquisitions worth
$1 billion or more through the first three quarters of the year,
indicating 1988 will see a record number of such ``megadeals,''
according figures released Thursday by Mergers & Acquisitions
magazine.
   The annual record of 31 deals of $1 billion or more was set in
1986, the magazine stated.
   Martin Sikora, editor of the Philadelphia-based bimonthly
journal, said the increasing number and magnitude of the deals makes
it likely they also will beat the annual dollar record of $206.4
billion set two years ago.
   The $6.5 billion acquisition of Federated Department Stores by
Campeau Corp. was the largest deal completed so far this year.
   But with such transactions as the $13.1 billion acquisition of
Kraft Inc. by Philip Morris Cos. Inc. and the proposed sale of RJR
Nabisco Inc. for more than $20 billion in the works, the
Campeau-Federated deal may not be the largest completed by year's
end.
   In the third quarter of this year, M&A recorded 791 completed
mergers, acquisitions and divestitures. The worth of the 402 deals
with reported prices totaled $44 billion.
   Last year during the same period, M&A recorded 904 completions
with a value of $47 billion. In the second quarter this year, 775
transactions were recorded with a value of $55.4 billion.
   For the first nine months of this year, completed deals totaled
2,493, with a value of $137.8 billion for 1,225 transactions
revealing price. For the same span of 1987, there were 2,797
transactions and a recorded value of $125.8 billion.
   ``One reason for the reduction in the number of transactions is
that the market is extremely competitive with attractive businesses
drawing multiple bids,'' Sikora said.
   ``This condition has driven up prices, forcing some buyers
temporarily to the sidelines and also has consumed time that active
buyers may have devoted to more acquisitions,'' he said.
   ``However, acquisition interest among all potential buyers
remains strong, and the growth in megadeals points up the abundance
of financing available to acquirers,'' he said.
   Foreign acquisitions in the United States totaled 91 with a value
of $12 billion in the third quarter against 95 worth $11.9 billion
in the second quarter and 84 worth $12.8 billion in the third
quarter of 1987.
   The leveraged buyout market posted 65 third-quarter completions
with known value of $7.6 billion against 61 with a $15.7 billion
value in the second quarter. Leveraged buyouts totaled 62 with a
$9.7 billion value in the third quarter of 1987.
