   Snow and sleet blanketed much of Southern
California Thursday and dozens of cars crashed on an icy mountain
interstate, killing two people. The snow also blocked thousands of
motorists on a coastal highway.
   Snow flurries appeared in the southern San Joaquin Valley and
sleet and rain fell around Los Angeles, including hills that were
dry and ablaze only a week ago, as the storm swept from Nevada
across California's midsection.
   As temperatures headed down to the 40s for the night, Los Angeles
gave hotel vouchers to homeless people and opened shelters in a
recreation center and an armory. Two armories opened as shelters in
Orange County.
   Ten crashes involving dozens of vehicles and two deaths occurred
on Interstate 15 in Cajon Pass, said Highway Patrol spokesman John
Savage. No information was immediately available on the deaths.
   At midmorning police began slowly escorting groups of cars
through the pass behind snowplows rather than require use of chains,
which causes miles of backup and hours of delay.
   ``It's just like a winter wonderland up there,'' said Officer Jim
Roden.
   Thousands of motorists were stuck when snow closed Highway 101
north of San Luis Obispo, which is about 150 miles north of Los
Angeles, police said.
   ``One of the problems is here we don't have the snow equipment to
take care of this _ it doesn't happen here,'' said CHP Officer Frank
Stricker.
   Cuesta Summit is only 1,500 feet above sea level, and Stricker
noted, snow fell not only at the top but at the bottom of the grade
as well.
   A college basketball game between San Francisco State and Cal
Poly-San Luis Obispo was canceled because the San Francisco team was
stranded at Atascadero on the north side of the grade, said Cal Poly
official Lisa Boyer.
   Motel rooms filled up fast in Atascadero and Paso Robles as the
highway traffic ground to a halt, said Frances Davis, who works at
the Paso Robles Inn. It was the first snowfall Ms. Davis had seen
there in 22 years.
   Interstate 5 over the Tejon Pass north of Los Angeles was snowy
and slick but the major north-south route through the San Gabriels
remained open.
   The storm was generated by a cold, upper-level low over Nevada
that moved through central California, the National Weather Service
said. The low was expected to drift west on Friday.
   Downtown Los Angeles warmed only to 56 degrees Thursday, compared
to a normal of 68. Rainfall totaled .77 inch by 6 p.m., bringing the
season total to 1.56 inches compared to a normal 3.29 inches by Dec.
15.
   Elsewhere, rainfall totaled 1.69 inches at Mount Wilson, 1.68
inches at Newhall, .95 inch at Pasadena, and 1.14 inch at Point Mugu
by evening.
   Just a week earlier the Los Angeles Basin was swept by warm and
fierce Santa Ana winds. Dozens of homes were burned by wind-blown
fires in two suburbs on Dec. 8, and the next day more burned in a
3,000-acre brush fire in the Santa Susana Mountains above the
northern San Fernando Valley.
   Snow flurries were reported on the floor of the southern San
Joaquin Valley at Bakersfield, Taft and McFarland, the weather
service said.
   Snowfall ranged from 2 to 6 inches in northern San Luis Obispo
County and some schools were closed, said sheriff's Lt. Jerry Dooley.
   ``Of course, people in this area aren't prepared for snow,'' he
said.

   A woman charged Thursday that
heavyweight champion Mike Tyson sexually molested her in a Manhattan
disco last week, the second woman to make such a charge.
   The woman, Lori Davis, 29, of Bay Shore on Long Island said she
planned to sue Tyson for mental anguish and trauma.
   Davis said she was dancing with a male partner at Bentley's Disco
Lounge around 2 a.m. Sunday when ``Someone grabbed my behind under
my dress.
   ``I turned around and screamed, `try that again and I'll slap the
---- out of you,''' she said.
   ``Then it dawned on me that I was screaming at the heavyweight
champion of the world,'' she said.
   Tyson, in Los Angeles to announce his upcoming fight with Frank
Bruno, said, ``I don't even know this person, I don't know what
happened.''
   Davis said Tyson was standing on the dance floor with two male
companions when the incident occurred. ``He put his hands up in the
air and said ``Whoa, whoa, we have a live one here,''' Davis said.
   Tyson and his friends then moved away to another area of the
disco. Asked if her male partner confronted Tyson on the dance
floor, she replied: ``No, the man had common sense.''
   She said she was willing to put aside the incident but when she
read two days ago that another woman had charged Tyson with sexually
molesting her at Bentley's on the same night she decided to come
forward.
   Her attorney, Stuart Berg, said the lawsuit will seek $1 million
in damages for ``trauma, shock and mental anguish.''
   Berg said Davis is scheduled to be interviewed by detectives in
Manhattan to determine if any criminal complaints should be filed.
   ``I am really angry and embarrassed at the whole thing,'' said
Davis.

   President Reagan on Thursday defended opening a
dialogue with the PLO, calling it ``just another step'' in the
Middle East peace process and saying Israel shouldn't worry about
America's commitment to its security.
   But Reagan also said he would not hesitate to ``break off
communications'' if Yasser Arafat's Palestine Liberation
Organization reneged on its acceptance of Israel's sovereignty or
its renunciation of terrorism as an instrument to achieve policy
objectives.
   During separate Oval Office picture-taking sessions with Turkish
Prime Minister Turgut Ozal and Italian Prime Minister Ciriaco de
Mita, the president said he decided to reverse his longstanding
opposition to contacts with the PLO on the basis of statements that
Arafat made in Geneva on Wednesday.
   When asked if he thought that Israel was justified in being upset
with his administration's move, Reagan replied: ``Well, I don't
think so, in the sense that we have made it very plain that we have
not retreated one inch from our position of guaranteeing the safety
of Israel.''
   Acting on the instructions of Secretary of State George P.
Shultz, the U.S. ambassador to Tunisia, Robert H. Pelletreau Jr.,
called the director general of the political section at the PLO's
Tunis headquarters to try to make arrangements for the talks, U.S.
officials said.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater told reporters that ``at
this point, there has been no substantive response in terms of time,
place or location.''
   State Department officials later said that talks with the PLO
probably would begin in Tunis on Friday afternoon.
   On Capitol Hill, leading members of Congress gave the new opening
a wary welcome, and they joined Reagan in seeking to reassure Israel
that U.S. officials will be alert to any PLO tricks.
   ``This is good news and the right path to follow,'' said Sen.
Claiborne Pell, D-R.I., chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations
Committee. ``I think we would best be very careful that the PLO
continue to show real seriousness and be wary of any decepion.''
   Sen. George Mitchell, D-Maine, the newly elected Senate majority
leader, welcomed the U.S. move and called it a ``significant step
toward advancing the peace process.''
   Reagan said the administration agreed to open a substantive
dialogue with the PLO after it became satisfied that Arafat had
complied with the U.S. conditions for such direct contacts.
   Asked to explain the policy reversal, the president said: ``Well,
because the words have been spoken, and the words were the words
that we have been stating were necessary.'' But he said, ``Of
course, ... the words must be matched by performance, and if they're
not, why, we're back where we started.''
   Questioned about what he would do if the PLO failed to live up to
its commitments, Reagan said, ``Well, we'd certainly break off
communications.'' He stressed that the ultimate solution in the
Middle East ``does not depend on outsiders _ or us.''
   ``Peace must be brought about by the involved nations meeting
with each other and settling their differences,'' he said.
   Asked why the United States does not recognize a Palestinian
state, Reagan said, ``... Because there is no such thing as of now.
There isn't a Palestinian state. And if you recognize someone ... as
that, it would be us declaring who was in charge there.''
   Reagan said commencing exploratory talks with the PLO was ``just
another step in what we've been trying for eight years _ to bring
about peace in the Middle East.''
   President-elect Bush told reporters he supported Reagan's
decision.
   ``I haven't spelled out any hopes about it,'' he added. ``Arafat
met the conditions of the United States and we will go forward with
a dialogue, not negotiations, but a dialogue. ... Let's see how
things evolve.''
   As for the discussions, Bush said, ``There's no game plan;
there's no five-point program.''
   Asked if he would prefer that the talks wait until his
administration starts next month, Bush replied, ``I am vice
president of the United States. I become president on Jan. 20. On
Jan. 21, I'll tell you what I want to do.''
   The U.S. announcement late Wednesday left Israel in diplomatic
isolation and came just a few hours after Bush had taken a tough
line against the PLO, declaring it failed to meet the U.S.
conditions.
   But Reagan and Shultz said that Arafat, in statements made in
Geneva about the same time that Bush was speaking, had met the U.S.
conditions for a ``substantive dialogue'' _ a form of diplomatic
acceptance long sought by the Palestinian group.
   Only a day earlier, the State Department had said Arafat failed
to meet the U.S. conditions. And less than three weeks ago, Shultz
had accused the PLO of terrorism, said Arafat was ``an accessory to
such terrorism'' and denied the PLO leader an entry visa to address
the U.N. General Assembly in New York.
   The United States long has insisted that the PLO accept U.N.
resolutions, adopted in 1967 and 1973, affirming the right of all
states in the Middle East to live in peace. Israel is not
specifically mentioned. The United States also has demanded that
Arafat's organization renounce terrorism and accept Israel's right
to exist.
   White House spokesman Fitzwater said U.S. officials would move
``cautiously into the dialogue'' with PLO representatives and that
the talks would ``establish a foundation'' for the organization ``to
prove that they have changed their ways.''
   ``It's too early to speculate on how these things might take
place,'' he said. ``This is a first step ... and how the follow-on
steps will evolve, we really don't want to draw parameters at this
point.''
   ``We did have strong feelings about the PLO and we still have
strong feelings,'' Fitzwater said. But he said the administration
decided to permit contacts because there has been ``evidence of
change.''

   There's a moment in Clint Eastwood's movie,
``Bird,'' when the great jazzman Charlie Parker stands on a
blackened Paris stage after finishing a concert, consuming massive
doses of applause and sniffing a long-stemmed red rose.
   He was something of a god to jazz zealots, but perhaps the
tortured musical genius never really got a chance to wake up and
smell the roses. He mutilated his life with drugs and alcohol, and
died at the age of 34 in 1955.
   Eastwood, who has loved jazz since his childhood and who always
wanted to film a portrait of Parker, attempts to harness the Bird's
creative spirit and all the creative juices of that time _ a time
when bebop came to the fore and brought jazz into the modern age. At
the same time, it pokes into the underbelly of the jazz world with
its stark portrayal of drugs, alcohol, debauchery.
   ``His life was obviously filled with many excesses _ sort of a
dichotomy,'' Eastwood says. ``How a person who can be so brilliant
and who spent hours and hours to become as great as he did and have
that kind of discipline could not in any other part of his life.
That was always a wonder to me.
   ``But I wanted a movie where you root for him. ... I just wanted
to explore the fact that he was brilliant and innovative, and the
other just became a part of his life.''
   Eastwood even films ``Bird'' in a dark, brownish hue.
   ``Most of the jazz world is nocturnal,'' he says. ``TV
unfortunately has shown a whole generation that flat light is the
only way. I don't like flat light. I like the feel of the movie; I
like to look into a film instead of having it look out at you. I
approached the color of it in terms of black and white.''
   Forest Whitaker (``Good Morning, Vietnam,'' ``Platoon'') is
gentle yet fierce, playful yet obsessed in his role as Parker, for
which he was awarded the best actor prize at the Cannes Film
Festival. It was well deserved for a stunning performance that even
captures the hunched body stances once assumed by the musician as he
performed. As Chan Parker, Diane Venora (``Ironweed,'' ``F-X'')
finds the right balance between free spirit and strong, loving wife
who battles her husband's philandering and personal demons and at
the same time champions his work and well-being.
   ``Bird'' followed the success of last year's ``Round Midnight,''
the story of an expatriate sax player in Paris. Tenor saxophone
great Dexter Gordon, who once worked with Parker, received an
Academy Award nomination for his role as the tragic Dale Turner.
Though based loosely on the late jazz musician Bud Powell, Bertrand
Tavernier's movie is a universal story of jazz artists who fled
bigotry and rough times in America for the allure of Paris and
Amsterdam during the 1940s, '50s and '60s.
   ``Paris Blues,'' Martin Ritt's 1961 jazz movie starring Paul
Newman and Sidney Poitier, takes a more romantic, Hollywood
approach. The late Duke Ellington received an Oscar nomination for
his score.
   In ``Bird,'' Lenny Niehaus did the score, which isolates Parker's
original playing of ``Laura,'' ``April in Paris,'' ``Ornithology,''
``Parker's Mood'' and other jazz tunes and remixes his recorded
solos with contemporary musicians including bassist Ron Carter,
trumpeter John Faddis, pianists Walter Davis Jr. and Barry Harris.
Jazz purists have been rankled by the soundtrack, which they say is
technically excellent but misses the interplay between Parker and
his sidemen.
   But Eastwood defends his decision: ``If you're going to do a film
and have stereophonic sound, you need to record well. Charlie never
had the opportunity to do stereophonic sound.''
   Charlie Parker was born in Kansas City, and took up first
baritone and then alto sax while still in high school, which he left
at the age of 14 so he could study such greats as Lester Young and
Count Basie in the local clubs. He soon found himself in New York
where a young trumpet player named Dizzy Gillespie was all the rage.
   With Thelonious Monk and Bud Powell on piano, Kenny Clarke on
drums and later a young Miles Davis on trumpet, Parker and Gillespie
helped define and create a new musical venture in jazz _ bebop.
   Parker, whose nickname was Yardbird and shortened to Bird,
stumbled into the lost world of night life. But even with the
debiliation of drugs and alcohol, he never failed to solve musical
problems and invent new directions.
   ``There have been no great harmonic changes in jazz since Charlie
and Dizzy,'' Eastwood says.
   And then he muses, what musical levels would Parker have reached
today had he lived? ``It would be interesting,'' the actor-filmmaker
says.

<TEXT>
   The rage of Hong Kong these days is easy to
spot. Just look for the tiny antennas, the telltale sign of the
portable telephones so many people are carrying wherever they go.
   Despite price tags of $2,000 or more, the hand-held telephones
have become a huge hit in this British colony, where doing business
is a 24-hour preoccupation and new status symbols are always in
demand.
   Downtown streets are filled with professionals ready for business
with the cellular phones tucked under their arms or stuffed,
antenna-up, into briefcases.
   Away from the financial district, people can be seen barking into
the phones while eating in restaurants, riding public buses and
ferries, or sitting in darkened movie theaters. Everyone from
executives to proprietors of produce stalls can be seen chatting
away.
   The Hong Kong Standard newspaper spotted a telephone in a recent
100-kilometer (62-mile) charity walk along a rural trail.
   ``In driving rain and a lashing wind, a young man was spotted
eagerly and conspicuously talking into his mobile telephone,'' it
said.
   ``In a more normal society one would expect (him) to hand the
phone over to one of his seconds before starting the race. (But) a
few kilometers down the track, the young man was spotted merrily
informing the financial markets at large of his continued
existence.''
   The government estimates about 60,000 portable cellular
telephones _ roughly six times earlier projections _ will be in use
by the end of the year in this territory of 5.7 million people, said
Deputy Postmaster General Henry Wise, whose department is in charge
of telecommunications.
   While most cellular telephones sold in other countries are for
use in cars, roughly three-fourths of the units sold in Hong Kong
since the market opened three years ago have been the more expensive
handheld models.
   ``We were amazed when the whole thing really took off in a great
way,'' Wise said.
   Hutchison Telephone Co, which has sold about 26,000 cellular
telephones, recently stopped sales for six weeks because demand was
outpacing the company's capacity to handle all the calls.
   ``The market just caught everybody by surprise,'' said Peter
Grant, president of China Telephone Co. Ltd., a rival firm. ``We're
all frantically rebuilding networks.''
   Harry Hui, a psychology lecturer at the University of Hong Kong,
attributed the popularity of the telephones here in part to ``the
importance of face. It's a status symbol.''
   Wise believes the Hong Kong work ethic of doing business whenever
and wherever possible is largely responsible for the tremendous
sales.
   ``Virtually the whole day is part of the working day,'' he said.
   Although industry officials see no end in sight to demand for the
telephones, their indiscriminate use in public places already is
viewed as an irritation by some.
   ``People are becoming aware of the annoyance factor,''
acknowledged Grant.
   Several exclusive clubs demand that their patrons and guests
check their telephones at the door.

<DATELINE>DUBLIN, Ireland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pub conversations in Dublin, where people
are fond of their drink and free with their opinions, are likely to
be spiced with some regret these days.
   Ireland's whiskey industry, the world's original, is now owned by
the French.
   Losing its treasures to outsiders _ principally the conquering
Vikings and English _ is no new experience for this small island
nation.
   Today, with liquor industries around the world tending to
consolidate, and with Ireland a member of the European Economic
Community, losing a major industry to an EEC partner is perhaps
inevitable.
   But it hurts all the same.
   Irish Distillers Group PLC, which makes all the world's Irish
whiskey and calls itself ``the spirit of Ireland,'' was won on Nov.
24 by the French liquor company Pernod Ricard SA after a six-month
battle with a hostile bidder, the Grand Metropolitan PLC, liquor
company of Britain.
   The news is by no means all bad: analysts say a fair price is
being paid for Irish Distillers' shares; its 1,100 employees' jobs
are assured; and the future looks brighter for its brands, which
include Jameson, Paddy and Bushmills.
   But over a neat measure of Irish whiskey or a pint of dark,
frothy Guinness at O'Donoghue's _ arguably Dublin's most famous pub
_ it's the losses, not the gains, that come to mind.
   ``I would obviously be disappointed when a company based in
Ireland becomes owned by someone other than Irish people,'' said
Mary McEvoy, echoing the sentiments of several customers, shouted
over lively Irish music.
   Ms. McEvoy, a mental health worker, is reticent about her age,
but not about her preferred whiskey: Bushmills.
   ``Irish whiskey is one of the most traditional products that this
country exports,'' said Frank Fell, chief executive of the Licensed
Vintners' Association. ``We were anxious to maintain the integrity
of Irish spirits. The main problem we were concerned with was that
the company would be broken up.''
   The issue was important enough for the government to step in and
ensure that Pernod Ricard did not alter the Irish whiskey industry,
which is a monopoly, or sell off brands without official approval.
   Irish Distillers sought out Pernod Ricard as a friendly bidder to
fend off Grand Met, which offered $499 million. Pernod Ricard's
offer was lower, at $442 million, but it promised to safeguard jobs
and develop brands, while Grand Met said it intended to dispose of
at least one brand.
   Grand Met threw in the towel after several regulatory and court
rulings in Pernod Ricard's favor, but retains a stake in Irish
Distillers limited by the government to 30 percent.
   The battle for Irish Distillers has been a headline-making event,
and very stressful for the company's workers.
   ``Certainly everybody had views about it. But the overwhelming
feeling we got was of support,'' said Irish Distillers' managing
director, Richard Burrows.
   So, is Irish whiskey still Irish?
   ``I don't think people will feel any different,'' Burrows said.
``With Pernod Ricard's support, we'll be able to go on with the
development of our brands. I think it's a good thing for the Irish
industry.''
   But Burrows, in an interview at the company's Dublin
headquarters, conceded: ``I do have a twinge of regret that Irish
Distillers is not remaining an independent Irish company. There is a
lot of heredity and tradition.''
   The secret of perfume distillation reached Ireland in the 6th
century and monks soon figured out how to use it for making whiskey.
   Irish Distillers' origins date to 1608 when Old Bushmills, which
claims to be the world's oldest distillery, was licensed in northern
County Antrim.
   In 1966, John Power and Son merged with John Jameson and Cork
Distillers. Bushmills joined the group in the 1970s, creating the
monopoly.
   Irish Distillers suffered in the 1980s from the abstinence trend,
and profits have been hurt by attempts to expand sales abroad.
   But sales now are growing here and overseas, Burrows said. In the
six months ended March 31, the company produced a 40 percent
year-to-year gain in net profit to $9.8 million, or 15 cents a
share, on an 8 percent gain in revenue to $197 million.
   With 1.635 million standard cases in the year ended Sept. 30,
1987, Irish whiskey captured 36 percent of the spirits market in
Ireland, and imported whiskeys accounted for 12 percent. Irish
whiskey sales outside Ireland came to nearly 1 million cases.
   The Scotch whisky industry shipped 75 million cases in 1987.
   Regrets aside, the overwhelming emotion at the company is relief
that the suspense is over and that the friendly bidder prevailed.
   ``I just feel the best people won,'' said Rachel O'Donnell, 25, a
receptionist at Irish Distillers' largest bottling plant, in
Clondalkin, outside Dublin.
   Said Burrows: ``There will be continuity, but certainly there
will be certain changes.''
   In the meantime, nothing is going to interfere with Irishman
Willie Doyle's plans.
   ``I'll still have my Paddy,'' Doyle said as he stepped off to his
favorite pub. Yes, O'Donoghue's. And yes, his eyes were smiling.

   The city was hit with a $60 million lawsuit
Wednesday alleging negligence on the part of Fire Department
paramedics who did not treat a 9-year-old boy who eventually died
from an asthma attack.
   Fire department spokesmen claim the ambulance was pelted with
eggs and rocks and paramedics were forced to retreat when they
arrived at a housing project Monday.
   ``All the evidence we have says there was nothing being thrown at
the paramedics,'' attorney Michael Bledsoe said. ``They just flatly
refused to go up'' to the apartment.
   Bledsoe filed a lawsuit on behalf of Sharon Jarnagin, whose son,
Carl, died. The lawsuit asks for $10 million in actual damages and
$50 million in punitive damages.
   A city attorney, Michael Lyons, said he was aware of the lawsuit
but had no comment.
   The paramedics, summoned by an emergency call at 4:16 p.m.
Monday, were not aware of the seriousness of the asthma attack when
they first arrived at the housing project, the Fire Department says.
   They left the scene and returned 24 minutes later when police
arrived, according to the Fire Department.
   Police officers said they found the boy in a bedroom in the
family's fifth-floor apartment. He was taken to a hospital, where he
was pronounced dead.
   Fire Department employees Tuesday washed the ambulance used by
the paramedics, removing any trace of egg that may have been on it,
Bledsoe said.
   ``When we heard about it we got a protective order barring anyone
from doing anything to the ambulance until we could inspect it,'' he
said
   The order was issued Wednesday by Cook County Judge Lester
Foreman.
   Fire Department spokesman Tom Sheppard said tapes of
communications between the paramedics and dispatchers show proof
that the ambulance was hit by flying objects.
   ``At all times paramedics and emergency medical technicians
should avoid placing themselves in danger,'' Sheppard said, reading
a city policy.
   The boy's mother and neighbors insist there was no danger to the
paramedics.

   Amateur astronomers using home computers and
high-powered binoculars were able to track the U.S. space shuttle
Atlantis as it deployed a secret spy satellite.
   ``If we could figure it out, you could bet that the Russians
figured it out too,'' says Ted Molczan, a self-described ``space
enthusiast'' who helped organize the tracking.
   Although he said the information gathered had little practical
use, the project showed secrecy is a rare commodity in the sky.
   In Washington, David Garrett of the National Aeronautics and
Space Administration said, ``We don't comment on secret satellite
launches.''
   Molczan, 35, said in a recent interview that the satellite
watchers are hobbyists who work together informally, trading
information through telephone calls, letters and electronic mail.
   The secrecy of the Atlantis' early December mission made their
research challenging and intriguing ``detective work,'' Molczan said.
   ``As space enthusiasts, for us to see the space shuttle is a very
exciting thing,'' he said, adding that he was thrilled by the rare
prospect the shuttle would be visible over Canadian skies.
   Shuttle orbits generally are farther south.
   Molczan is an engineering technologist who specializes in energy
conservation. His interest in space is visible in his sparsely
furnished 23rd floor apartment; a computer and charts lie on his
desk, books on the subject cram a bookcase and high-power binoculars
sit on a stand near the door.
   The binoculars, said Molczan, are more useful than telescopes for
satellite watching because they are easier to point and have a wider
field of view.
   Molczan had been in contact with about 150 other satellite
watchers from as far away as Australia about the Atlantis' probable
orbit. He circulated information including a ``test yourself'' page
to make sure all participants could handle the necessary
calculations.
   The Toronto skies were cloudy on Dec. 2, the day of the Atlantis'
launch, and Molczan was unable to see it passing over. Others did,
and the calls started coming in while the craft was on its sixth
orbit in the late afternoon.
   There were two sightings from the Toronto region and one from
Ashtabula, Ohio.
   ``To get three confirmations like that in the space of half an
hour was very exciting,'' Molczan said. ``We had more than a dozen
people in this area looking for it.''
   Knowing the times of the sightings allowed him to calculate the
height of the orbit and, with the computer, he quickly was able to
determine where the shuttle could be seen for the rest of the
mission.
   Molczan said the watchers sighted only the Atlantis on the sixth
revolution, and the satellite was sighted by the seventh revolution
three miles ahead of it. Continued sightings showed that for two
days the shuttle stayed close to the satellite, which was observed
to have a reddish color.
   He said it was very satisfying to determine that the satellite,
known as Lacrosse, was deployed on the shuttle's first day in orbit.
The news media was speculating that it would be released on the
second day.
   ``The mission went the way we hypothesized it would,'' Molczan
said.
   The industry magazine Aviation Week and Space Technology reported
last week, citing Defense Department sources, that the $500 million
radar-imaging satellite's deployment took place on the shuttle's
fifth orbit, or about seven hours after it was launched at 9:30 a.m.
EST.
   Molzcan suspects the reddish color was from the thermal coverings
of the satellite, because gold coverings in the past have been seen
as reddish.
   ``It's sort of fun to speculate,'' he said. ``We'll probably
never know, but it added to the whole fun of the exercise.''
   His own glimpse did not come until the 37th revolution, about
halfway through the four-day mission.

<HEAD>Last Five Italian Warships Leave Persian Gulf</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The last five Italian warships have left
the Persian Gulf in the latest and largest cutback of foreign naval
forces following the Iran-Iraq cease-fire, Italian officials say.
   The frigate Euro, flagship of the Italian flotilla, and the
minehunters Castagno and Loto sailed through the Strait of Hormuz at
the mouth of the gulf last week, the Defense Ministry in Rome said
Wednesday.
   They were bound for home.
   The frigate Sagittario and the supply tanker Stromboli left Nov.
24 and reached their home port at the Taranto naval base in Italy on
Monday, the ministry said.
   Italian officials announced the withdrawal in early November,
saying the Aug. 20 cease-fire, which halted fighting in the
8-year-old war, had brought a ``consolidation of stability'' to the
strategic waterway.
   Italy deployed warships in the gulf after the Italian container
ship Jolly Rubino was attacked by Iranian gunboats while sailing to
Kuwait on Sept. 2, 1987. Italy kept up to eight ships in the gulf at
once.
   The Jolly Rubino was the only Italian-flag vessel among more than
500 ships attacked by both sides during the four-year ``tanker
war.'' Iran regularly intercepted ships suspected of carrying
war-related cargoes for Iraq during the war.
   The Italian departure reduced the number of foreign warships in
or near the gulf to about 50, with half belonging to the United
States. At its peak late last year, the foreign naval force
comprised more than 70 ships from seven countries.

<TEXT>
   Two derailed railroad cars leaking highly
explosive liquid propane Wednesday forced the evacuation of about
100 residents and closed an interstate highway and rail routes in
northern Arizona.
   A total of 26 cars derailed early Wednesday about 10 miles east
of Flagstaff after 84 Santa Fe Railroad Co. cars somehow became
uncoupled during a stop, said a company official.
   Residents near the derailment were told at about 11 a.m. to plan
to spend at least 24 hours away from their homes while authorities
tried to defuse the cars leaking liquid propane.
   ``This has the potential to become a very dangerous situation,''
said Coconino County Sheriff Joe Richards.
   He said hazardous-materials teams from the Santa Fe Railroad Co.
and the state Department of Public Safety hoped to siphon off the
propane through a makeshift rigging of pipes and valves and ignite
it in a controlled burn.
   ``They can't offload it, because that would be too dangerous,''
Richards said. ``It's too dangerous to move heavy equipment in there
because of the potential for an explosion.''
   But later in the day, Santa Fe spokesman Mike Martin said that
hazardous materials experts were considering an alternate strategy,
an intricate process of pumping the propane out of the leaking
propane cars with special equipment.
   The process would take up to 36 hours, he said. If it is used,
the propane would be taken by truck and would be reloaded on
different tank cars later, Martin said. The experts hoped to decide
on a stragegy by early Thursday, he said.
   The residents evacuated earlier Wednesday would not be allowed to
return to their homes until the propane was completely removed.
   Authorities sealed off both the railroad right-of-way and
Interstate 40 over the 58-mile stretch between Flagstaff and
Winslow. By late evening Wednesday, the road and railroad remained
closed.
   State police helicopters also closed off the airspace over the
wreckage, chasing away aircraft carrying photographers.
   An Amtrak spokesman said the derailment held up two trains.
   Two other cars carrying propane, one with a hazardous-cargo
label, and 21 others derailed, but they were not leaking. The car
with the hazardous-cargo label was believed to be carrying an
industrial solvent, and was not considered explosive, officials said.
   Santa Fe spokesman Mike Martin said the train was parked at the
Ralston Purina pet-food plant in East Flagstaff to drop off one car
when the cars became uncoupled and began rolling east down a slight
grade.
   The runaway reached an estimated 40 mph before the cars derailed
on a curve. No one was injured, he said.
   Investigators began a probe to determine why the train sections
became separated, but the cause was not immediately determined,
Martin said. The westbound train originated in Kansas City, Mo.

<HEAD>Biggest Pricetag Estimate Yet for Failing S&Ls: $112 Billion</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A congressional study places the largest
government estimate yet on the price of bailing out the nation's
failing savings and loans, and says the cost could soar even higher
unless action is taken quickly.
   The General Accounting Office says the government should spend
$112 billion to close failed institutions and abandon its current
strategy of trying to keep the institutions alive through assisted
mergers.
   GAO said the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp., or FSLIC,
will need $85 billion over and above the $27 billion it expects to
collect in fees from S&Ls through 1998.
   However, the congressional auditing and investigative agency
warned that the pricetag will be even higher if interest rates rise.
Most economists expect rates to climb through the middle of next
year, but offer no firm predictions beyond that.
   The investigative agency, in a draft of a report to the House
Banking Committee, sharply criticized the Federal Home Loan Bank
Board, regulator of the nation's 3,000 S&Ls, for attempting to
rescue failed S&Ls by providing money to private merger partners.
   The report noted that the insurance fund spends on mergers about
90 percent of what it would cost to simply close insolvent
institutions and pay off depositors. However, mergers do not always
resolve the problem and, counting tax losses to the government, may
well be more costly, it said.
   ``Regulators and Congress have resisted massive closings of
insolvent savings and loans in the hope that the fortunes of these
institutions would reverse themselves,'' it said. ``This hope has
proven both futile and costly.''
   It noted that industry losses totaled $9.4 billion in the first
nine months of this year.
   The GAO said failed S&Ls should be placed into receivership in
the next year and most of the $112 billion should be spent in the
next three years.
   The bank board has avoided that approach, arguing that massive
closings could leave some areas of the nation without service from
an S&L and that a flood of repossessed real estate from failed
institutions could deepen the regional recession in the Southwest.
   Breaking down the $112 billion, the GAO said $77 billion will be
required to close insolvent _ but still open _ S&Ls, which numbered
434 at the end of September. Previously, GAO and the bank board had
estimated that closing insolvent S&Ls would require about $50
billion.
   The new report also cites additional expenses, including $10
billion needed to finance borrowing by the FSLIC, which guarantees
S&L deposits up to $100,000, and $5 billion likely to be required
for losses that have occurred but haven't been discovered yet. An
additional $20 billion should be set aside as a reserve against
future losses, GAO said.
   The thrift industry can contribute $5 billion to $10 billion, but
the rest ``may have to come from the federal government unless
others, such as (commercial) banks and depositors, are required to
share the cost,'' the GAO said.
   The report did not specifically recommend a taxpayer bailout,
saying only that ``Congress must make difficult choices.'' However,
it warned that continuing an extra fee charged S&Ls for deposit
insurance, over and above what competing commercial banks pay,
``could weaken healthy thrifts and thereby prove self-defeating.''
   Separately, the Treasury Department is working on its own
recommendation to the incoming Bush administration and Congress.
Reagan administration sources have said the Treasury is considering
a plan to borrow the money through a newly created agency, keeping
most of the spending out of the federal budget deficit.
   The GAO recommended ``at this time'' against merging FSLIC with
the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., which backs deposits in
commercial banks.
   ``GAO strongly advises against further weakening the deposit
insurance system through a merger in which FDIC's reserves and
premium income, both of which are needed for bank problems, are
simply diverted to cover some of FSLIC's losses,'' it said.
   However, the report said healthy S&Ls that want to change
themselves to commercial banks and join the FDIC should be allowed
provided they pay the appropriate fees to the FSLIC.
   The GAO is circulating its draft report for comments and hopes to
issue the final version in January or February.
   Charles J. Koch, chairman of the National Council of Savings
Institutions, an industry trade group, called the GAO
recommendations ``provocative'' and ``refreshing.'' His group
represents many savings institutions which are already members of
the FDIC and others which would be healthy enough to transfer.

   Aerospace employment declined by 21,000 jobs in
1988 as the industry recorded its first annual sales drop in 17
years, according to the Aerospace Industries Association.
   ``The reason is a substantial decrease in sales to the Department
of Defense, hardly a surprise in view of the zero-to-negative-growth
defense budgets of the last four fiscal years,'' the association's
president, Don Fuqua, said Wednesday.
   Overall sales volume was projected to reach $111 billion for
1988, a reduction of slightly more than $1 billion from last year.
   ``An analysis of orders on hand indicates a defense sales rebound
in 1989 but we look for further substantial declines as we move into
the early years of the 1990s,'' Fuqua said. The sales projection for
next year is for $129 billion but ``our real, inflation-adjusted
sales curve for the next few years will be relatively flat,''
according to Fuqua.
   Statistics released by the association said the number of jobs in
the aerospace industry will drop to 1,307,000 for the year and that
there will be 14,000 fewer jobs still in 1989.
   ``We did not set a new record for sales ... for the first time in
17 years,'' Fuqua said.
   Still, industry profits were expected to improve to $5.1 billion,
and the backlog of unfilled orders to reach an all-time high of
$170.3 billion, the association said.
   An increase in civil aerospace business, Fuqua said, will offset
the military decline.
   ``We must face this fact,'' Fuqua said at the joint AIA and
Aviation-Space Writers Association luncheon. ``The Bush
administration and the new Congress must continue to accord top
priority to further reduction in the national budget deficit.
   ``So, barring an unexpected change in the international climate,
we must realistically anticipate lower levels of defense
appropriations and therefore reduced industry sales of defense
equipment.''
   Fuqua said American industry is severely handicapped in
international competition by trade restrictions imposed by its own
government. He called the government's role ``purely administrative
and often obstructive'' when it should be an active supporter of
U.S. exports.
   He announced creation of a foundation to be called the National
Center for Advanced Technology, which will pull together everything
being done in technology and create a data base for companies and
agencies taking part.

   PTL founder Jim Bakker expressed concern
Wednesday that his former evangelistic empire would vanish, but
officials of PTL's successor group continued negotiating with their
new landlord to salvage some part of the ministry.
   The fate of the television ministry and church at Fort Mill,
S.C., was left up in the air Tuesday when Stephen Mernick, a
34-year-old Orthodox Jew, purchased the PTL assets for $65 million.
Since last year, the facilities have been leased to Heritage
Ministries, a non-profit religious group created by the bankruptcy
court.
   In a statement Wednesday, Bakker, accused in a federal indictment
with misusing millions of dollars of his followers' money, said he
was concerned that Mernick would ignore the rights of PTL's
so-called lifetime partners who contributed $1,000 or more to the
ministry in exchange for free lodging at Heritage USA, PTL's lavish
religious theme park at Fort Mill.
   ``Our hearts are broken over the fighting over Heritage USA that
was built to bring people together in God's love,'' Bakker said.
``Tammy and I still have as our goal to restore Heritage USA and all
lifetime benefits to the partners who built it.''
   But Heritage Ministries President Sam Johnson, who has met with
Mernick three times since Monday, said Wednesday that he expects no
immediate changes.
   ``He (Mernick) was very conciliatory in his tone,'' said Johnson,
who also is pastor of the church.
   ``The ministry is the heart and soul of Heritage USA,'' he said.
``When you take out the heart, all you have is a cadaver.''
   Heritage Ministries officials told viewers of Wednesday's
broadcast of ``Heritage Today,'' the successor to the ``PTL Club,''
they would continue in their effort to buy all the assets of PTL.
   ``We want to be prepared in any event,'' said Johnson, explaining
that a number of developments could occur before the deal was final.
``Some assets he (Mernick) may not be interested in.''
   Meanwhile Wednesday, an attorney for one of the unsuccessful
bidders for PTL, Charlotte broadcasting executive Cy Bahakel, said
his client will fight the sale in court.
   ``We are going to contest irregularities in these proceedings,
and we are very firm in our intention to do that,'' said the lawyer,
Faison Barnes.
   Tuesday, in bankruptcy court in Columbia, Mernick raised his
offer to $65 million, after being the high bidder at $36.25 million
at an auction the previous day. Reynolds then accepted the offer.
   When Bahakel, who showed up about 25 minutes late, asked to be
allowed to bid $70 million, Reynolds turned him down. Bahakel's
lawyer said Wednesday that Mernick should not have been allowed to
raise his bid.
   Johnson indicated that the money the group raised in an
unsuccessful telethon effort to buy PTL _ reportedly about $5
million _ may be used to buy the assets it needs to maintain the
ministry.
   Mernick would not answer questions Tuesday about the future of
Heritage Ministries, but said he would unveil plans in the next two
weeks for PTL's assets, which include the satellite network carried
on 800 cable systems, 1,700 acres of undeveloped land, a 500-room
hotel, a water park, and the 2,000-seat church.
   When he entered the PTL bidding in October, Mernick said he was
interested in the assets ``purely as a real estate deal.''
   The Charlotte Observer, quoting sources close to Mernick, said he
intends to hold onto the undeveloped land for 10 years as its value
rises.
   Johnson said Mernick told officials of Heritage Ministries he is
interested in maintaining the retreat's atmosphere.
   ``He's extremely sensitive to the people who have invested,''
Johnson said.
   Meanwhile, Bakker faces a bond hearing Thursday on the indictment
issued last week.
   Jim Toms, one of the PTL founder's attorneys, said he does not
expect his client to enter a plea until next month. Toms has said
previously that Bakker would plead innocent to all charges.
   A federal grand jury on Dec. 5 indicted Bakker and his former top
deputy at PTL, Richard Dortch, on 24 counts of wire and mail fraud
and conspiracy. The panel has accused Bakker and Dortch of diverting
more than $4 million in PTL money to support their own ``lavish and
extravagant'' lifestyles.
   Two other former aides, brothers David and James Taggart, each
were indicted on six tax charges.
   Bakker, 48, resigned as PTL president in March 1987 after it was
revealed he had a sexual tryst in 1980 with New York church
secretary Jessica Hahn and paid her to keep quiet about it.

   President-elect Bush, who ran for the White

just what you'd expect: Washington insiders.
   Bush's announcement Wednesday that he is tapping Reagan
administration Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter to be his

   He is retaining Richard Thornburgh as attorney general, Nicholas
F. Brady as secretary of the treasury, Lauro Cavazos as secretary of
education, William Webster as CIA director and Marlin Fitzwater as
the White House spokesman.
   James A. Baker III, a longtime Bush associate who served Reagan
as White House chief of staff and secretary of the treasury, will be
secretary of state in the new administration.
   Richard Darman, an aide to Baker at both the White House and the
Treasury Department, will head the Office of Management and Budget.
   The national security adviser will be Brent Scowcroft, who had
the same job in the Ford administration.
   It is not unheard of for newly elected presidents to pick people
with Washington experience to do Washington jobs.
   But no administration in recent memory has had so many retreads
as the one now shaping up.
   ``I think they are his kind of people,'' said Austin Ranney,
chairman of the Department of Political Science at the University of
California. ``George Bush is an old Washington hand and these are
the people he feels comfortable with.''
   ``Bush's whole argument this fall was `I'm the insider, I
understand how government works, I can handle things,''' said David
Caputo, professor of political science and dean of humanities at
Purdue University.
   That campaign contrasted sharply with those of his two
predecessors.
   Ronald Reagan ran as the ultimate Washington outsider, often
telling audiences that government, far from being the solution to
their problems, was part of the problem.
   Even Reagan picked some veterans of the Washington scene. His
first secretary of defense, for instance, was fellow Californian
Caspar Weinberger, who had been budget director and secretary of
health, education and welfare in the Nixon administration. Most of
his initial choices, however, were people like Donald T. Regan,
picked to be treasury secretary after a career on Wall Street, and
William Clark, who jumped from a seat on the California Supreme
Court to the No. 2 job in the State Department.
   Jimmy Carter, the former Georgia governor and peanut farmer, also
took pride in his status as a stranger to the Washington scene.
   Carter aide Hamilton Jordan said before the election:
   ``If, after the inauguration, you find a Cy Vance as secretary of
state and Zbigniew Brzezinski as head of national security, then I
would say we failed. And I'd quit. But that's not going to happen.''
   It did happen, and he didn't quit.
   But Vance, a former secretary of the Army and deputy secretary of
defense, and Brzezinski, an academic with strong ties to the
Washington foreign policy establishment, were also exceptions.
   More typical of Carter's choices was Bert Lance, the Georgia
banker he chose to head the Office of Management and Budget.
   Regan, Clark and Lance all had their troubles in Washington.
   Regan, the former Wall Street executive, was fired as Reagan's
chief of staff after a presidential board blamed him for many of the
White House's troubles in the Iran-Contra affair.
   Clark, the former California judge, was ridiculed after he was
unable, in his Senate confirmation hearings, to name the prime
minister of South Africa or express a view on nuclear
nonproliferation, foreign aid or U.S. relations with Third World
countries. He was confirmed anyway and satisfied Reagan well enough
that the president later made him national security adviser and then
secretary of the interior.
   Lance left the Carter administration under a cloud of alleged
past banking irregularities, then was acquitted of those charges by
a federal grand jury.
   Clark and Lance were past associates in state government of the
former governors who appointed them _ people they knew and trusted.
   Bush's background for the past 20 years has been in the
Washington orbit, as a member of Congress, ambassador to the United
Nations, Republican national chairman, U.S. representative in
Peking, director of the Central Intelligence Agency and vice
president.
   He, too, however, apparently wants some familiar faces around him.
   ``Many of the people he knows well personally and he probably
implicitly trusts them,'' said political scientist Caputo.
   ``He doesn't want high risk.''

   The sudden U.S. decision to deal with the
Palestine Liberation Organization raises tough political problems
for Israel and suggests disarray within the Reagan administration in
its final weeks.
   Even while Secretary of State George P. Shultz and other senior
officials were making preparations at the White House for
Wednesday's historic announcement, President-elect George Bush was
criticizing the PLO for failing to meet U.S. conditions for a
dialogue.
   Speaking at the Executive Office Building just across the street,
Bush vowed to continue the Reagan administration's tough stand
against Yasser Arafat's organization. He demanded ``a clear and
unambiguous statement'' explicitly recognizing Israel, renouncing
terrorism and accepting two major U.N. Security Council resolutions
on the right of all states to live within secure boundaries.
   ``Before we have a dialogue with the PLO the signals have to be
clear, unmistakable, unambiguous,'' Bush said, biting off each word
with decisive crispness.
   Simultaneously, however, Arafat was giving a news conference in
Geneva that Shultz seized on as evidence that the PLO chairman had
come around to accepting the U.S. conditions.
   The result was announcements by President Reagan and by Shultz
that there would be a ``substantive dialogue'' with the PLO in Tunis
_ leaving Bush looking like the odd man out.
   Shultz, meanwhile, did not explain later at a State Department
news conference how what Arafat said on Wednesday had differed from
what the PLO leader had said a day earlier. The day-earlier comments
had been declared unacceptable.
   Having denied Arafat a visa less than three weeks earlier, Shultz
suddenly was approving direct dealings with a man he had denounced
as an ``accessory'' in acts of terrorism against Israelis and
Americans.
   Asked what was different about Arafat's most recent statement,
Shultz said cryptically: ``It was clear. It was not encumbered.''
   The decision was in a long State Department tradition of policy
shifts that always are defended as not policy shifts at all.
   It clearly backs Israel into a corner, now standing alone in
shunning the PLO. Shultz said he would not presume to advise another
country what it ought to do.
   ``It's totally for Israel to make its own decisions about what it
wants to do, and there's nothing to be inferred judgmentally about
what they should do,'' he said.
   The choice Israel faces is to watch the United States, its
closest friend, make arrangements for Mideast negotiations with the
PLO and not participate, or to agree to attend a peace conference
with the participation of the Palestine Liberation Organization now
a virtual certainty.
   The PLO could come under pressure, too _ from the United States
to make good on Arafat's declaration renouncing terrorism in all
forms.
   Bush, undoubtedly, will be asked by reporters in the next few
days why he seemed so out of step with what was brewing within the
White House. In a way, though, he may benefit from the decision
taken by the outgoing Reagan administration.
   Any political storm caused by embracing the PLO will not fall on
him. It's a decision that may have been inevitable, and one he now
will not have to make.
   But he may have to make one just as tough _ whether to support a
Palestinian state.
   Shultz said he was not endorsing statehood for the Palestinians
by approving the dialogue. And yet, the PLO's demand for a state
carved out of Israeli-held territory will be bolstered by its entry
into America's diplomatic community.

   Commercial filming has been banned during
the winter season in this exclusive community after some residents
complained that filming might encourage ``some kook'' to commit a
``dastardly act.''
   But the Town Council made an exception for Burt Reynolds, a
Florida native who married actress Loni Anderson here and lives in
nearby Jupiter.
   The actor has been filming a detective series for ABC-TV called
``B.L. Stryker'' since early last month.
   His filming application for the next three months was approved
Tuesday.
   Later, the council approved an ordinance that bans filming
between Nov. 15 and April 15. At other times, it will prohibit
filming near the police station or any other government building and
restrict filming to streets wider than 30 feet.
   Some residents had asked the council for a complete ban.
   Robert Grace, who served on the council from 1970-84, said
filming in Palm Beach might encourage ``some kook or criminal to
come over here and do some dastardly act.''
   ``I don't think this town should be a movie set for Burt Reynolds
or anyone else,'' Warren Woodward told the council. ``It's going to
attract the kind of people we don't want here, people who are not
going to spend any money here because, number one, they probably
don't have any money. We're going to get a lot of Budweisers,
cutoffs and yobbos (hoodlums).''

Salvador Dali back home after 16 days of hospital treatment for
heart and respiratory problems, Spanish National Television reported.
   Quiron Clinic spokeswoman Cristina Bas said Dali's release
Wednesday was authorized by doctors that cared for him after he was
taken to the Barcelona clinic Nov. 28. He was stricken by what
doctors described as heart failure aggravated by blood clots in his
lungs.
   The 84-year-old artist had been admitted to a hospital in his
hometown of Figueras, 60 miles north of Barcelona, the day before
for treatment for pneumonia.
   After several days in critical condition, Dali was moved from the
clinic's intensive care unit Dec. 5. On Friday, doctors said his
vital signs had stabilized at the same levels as before he was
stricken.

   Ma Anand Sheela, former secretary
of Indian guru Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh, said she arrived here with no
money after leaving the United States owing more than $269,000.
   The Indian-born Sheela, 39, flew into Frankfurt from Los Angeles
after serving 2{ years of a 4{-year sentence for attempted murder,
wiretapping and other convictions. She won early release from prison
Tuesday and was deported after pledging not to return to the United
States for five years.
   ``I have no money,'' Sheela told reporters after arriving with no
luggage Wednesday.
   Sheela said she will go back to India but didn't think she would
see the guru, who is at a commune there. She then left for the
southern West German spa town of Baden-Baden, accompanied by her
German lawyer.
   Sheela was a prime force in the Bhagwan's commune in Oregon that
was started in 1981 but collapsed after he was convicted of
immigration fraud and deported in 1985.
   Authorities in Oregon complained she left behind more than
$269,000 in unpaid fines and restitution.
   ``It's a heck of a lot harder to collect money from someone in
Germany or India or wherever she is than if she's in prison in the
United States,'' said Marla Rae, spokeswoman for state Attorney
General Dave Frohnmayer.

<HEAD>Text of Shultz Statement on PLO</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Here is the text of the statement by Secretary
of State George P. Shultz on Wednesday in which he announced the
United States will establish a dialogue with the Palestine
Liberation Organization:
   SHULTZ: The Palestinian Liberation Organization today issued a
statement in which it accepted UN Security Council Resolutions 242
and 338; recognized Israel's right to exist in peace and security;
and renounced terrorism. As a result, the United States is prepared
for a substantive dialogue with PLO representatives. I am
designating our Ambassador to Tunisia as the only authorized channel
for that dialogue. The objective of the United States remains as
always, a comprehensive peace in the Middle East. In that light, I
view this development as one more step toward the beginning of
direct negotiations between the parties, which alone can lead to
such a peace.
   Nothing here may be taken to imply an acceptance or recognition
by the United States of an independent Palestinian state. The
position of the U.S. is that the status of the West Bank and Gaza
cannot be determined by unilateral acts of either side, but only
through a process of negotiations. The United States does not
recognize the declaration of an independent Palestinian state. It is
also important to emphasize that the United States' commitment to
the security of Israel remains unflinching.
   Q: Mr. Secretary, what was it today that changed your mind?
   SHULTZ: I didn't change my mind, they changed their _ they made
their statement clear so that it doesn't have the ambiguities in it
that earlier statements had, which tended to allow various people to
give different interpretations of what was meant.
   Q: Well, what was different, what was different about it today?
   SHULTZ: It was clear. It was not encumbered.
   Q: Mr. Secretary, what about the PLO's record, which only two
weeks ago you described as a terrorism record. You called Arafat an
accomplice or an accessory to terrorism. You denied him a visa. Are
you expunging the PLO record and saying ``let bygones be bygone''?
   SHULTZ: No. When we have our dialogue, you can be sure that the
first item of business on our agenda in that dialogue will be the
subject of terrorism, and we'll make it clear that our position
about the importance of the renunciation of terrorism is central.
   Q: But what can a dialogue do about people who are already dead?
And what does your statement have _ how does your statement bear on
the promise Kissinger made the Israelis?
   SHULTZ: The promise that Kissinger made the Israelis, which had
to do with 242 and 338, and with the recognition of Israel's right
to exist. Since that time, we have added our insistence on a
renunciation of terrorism. Those conditions have been US conditions
for a dialogue with the PLO going back to 1975. Our position has not
changed. We have stayed with that position consistently. And now,
today, we have an acceptance of those conditions in a clear-cut way.
   Q: Mr. Secretary, have you told the State of Israel of your
intentions? And can you tell us what their response was?
   SHULTZ: Everybody has been put on notice repeatedly for _ since
1975, in effect, that if the PLO meets our conditions, then we're
prepared for a substantive dialogue. That is well-known.
   Of course, we have had communications with Israel as we have with
other states and we have been engaged in the last hour or so of
trying to call people to tell them explicitly what we are prepared
to do, now that there is this statement, but I don't want to try to
speak for others. I'm only speaking for the United States.
   Q: Do you have any reason to believe that the Israelis would be
willing to sit down with the PLO?
   SHULTZ: No, I don't have any reason to believe that. But all I'm
telling you is what the U.S. policies are and this policy has been
in place for _ since 1975, and it has been consistently adhered to
and now that we see a change in the posture of the PLO, all we're
doing is following through on that policy. Our policy remains
unchanged.

   Q: Mr. Secretary, do you see this as a single meeting or as the
beginning of a process in which there will be a series of meetings
and aimed at what result? If it is going to be a series of meetings,
where do you want it to go?
   SHULTZ: The meetings are not an end in themselves. Our object is
a comprehensive peace and so our object in any dialogue that we have
with the PLO will emphasize our desire for that and our views of
what it takes to get there. I made a speech last September on behalf
of the United States and set our views as a supplement to the views
contained in the initiative that we worked on earlier this year.
   So our object is not a dialogue. Our object is peace and we will
be talking to the PLO as to others in an effort to move things along
toward that objective.
   Q: Mr. Secretary, Kissinger was at the White House this morning.
Was that why he was there? To _
   SHULTZ: No, it wasn't.
   Q: Mr. Secretary _
   SHULTZ: However, I did talk to Secretary Kissinger since we got
word of this development.
   Q: Mr. Secretary, your statement at the American Colony was
addressed specifically to Palestinian residents in the West Bank and
Gaza and not _ specifically not to the PLO. Does this dialogue with
the PLO now mean that the United States is prepared to address that
sort of statement to the PLO leadership as well as to other
Palestinians?
   SHULTZ: That was a statement to Palestinians that I made in
Jerusalem last Spring, as I remember. Do you have the date of it in
mind? I forget. It's been a while ago. Anyway, I sought a meeting
with Palestinians and I went to their turf, so to speak and they
would not meet and, of course, the word we got was that they were
afraid to meet because they were afraid to meet because they were
afraid they would be killed if they did. So I went and I made a
statement that you referred to, saying, ``Here is what I would have
told you if you had come,'' and we issued that statement as a
statement of our efforts toward peace and of our recognition, which
has been consistent and it's obviously so, that if you're going to
get to a peaceful settlement in the Middle East, you have to include
Palestinians in the process from the beginning and at the end. That
is clear enough, and that was basically what I said.
   Q: As a result of this, Mr. Secretary, are you going to be
willing to talk with Mr. Arafat, before you leave office?
   SHULTZ: What I am doing is authorizing our ambassador in Tunisia
to make himself available for a direct dialogue, and we are making
it clear that this is the only authorized channel of communication.
So anybody else who is representing themselves as a channel is not a
channel. This is the authoritative channel representing the United
States government.
   Now, what may evolve from this remains to be seen, but I think
that when it comes to any genuine, substantive discussion, we are in
a transition phase and it is basically for the next administration
to decide what they do.
   Q: When will the first meeting be held?
   SHULTZ: I don't _ we have seen this PLO statement; I'm making
this response on behalf of the president. I might say, the
president, the vice president agree with this. And I'm authorizing
now the ambassador in Tunis to undertake this dialogue, but when
there will be a meeting, I don't know.
   Q: (Off mike) _ the United States has recognized the PLO as the
legitimate partner for negotiations, do you feel that there's any
reason for Israel not to negotiate with the PLO?
   SHULTZ: What we are doing as a result of the PLO's meeting our
conditions, is establishing a substantive dialogue with them. We
hope that that dialogue may help bring about direct negotiations
that will lead to peace. How those negotiations are structured, who
is there to speak on behalf of the Palestinians is a subject that's
a difficult one. We've worked on it a long time.
   And I imagine it'll continue to be difficult. But, at any rate,
we'll have a dialogue with the PLO, and that dialogue will be
designed to find the answers to those questions.
   Q: Now that the PLO has recognized Israel's right to exist and
the UN Resolutions, and renounced terrorism, do you feel there's any
reason that Israel should not now talk to the PLO?
   SHULTZ: I _ Israel has its own views and own policies, and Israel
has always made it clear that these conditions that are U.S.
conditions are not necessarily theirs. So, I am not in any way
speaking for Israel. It's totally for Israel to make its own
decisions about what it wants to do and there's nothing to be
inferred judgmentally about what they should do. I'm only saying
that for the period since 1975, the U.S. has had a position, in
effect, that if the PLO meets these conditions, we will have a
substantive dialogue and since they have met the conditions, we are
carrying through on our policy and that's the sum and substance of
it.
   Q: Have you conferred with the incoming administration, since you
have insisted that you are in a transitional state, and would you be
able to tell us what's their stand on it?
   SHULTZ: The president and the vice president both have followed
these developments very closely and they have reviewed each of them
_ this most recent development and they both agree that under these
circumstances, the conditions for a substantive dialogue which we
have had in place since 1975 have been met and so we should state
that we are ready to undertake that dialogue. Now as far as what
will be the efforts of the administration of president-elect, that
is for them to determine and that remains to be seen.
   Q: Thank you.
   Q: Sir, is this a condition of the PLO _
   SHULTZ: I have been dismissed.
   MR. REDMAN (Charles Redman, State Department spokesman): Thank
you, all.

   The International Wheat Council is forecasting
that world wheat production could rise to a record level in the
1989-90 season and start a modest rebuilding of depleted grain
stockpiles.
   But an official of the U.S. National Association of Wheat Growers
says the council's assertion is premature and that i's too early to
make such projections.
   The council said Wednesday that wheat production could reach a
record 550 million metric tons in the 1989-90 season. That would be
5 million tons more than is expected to be consumed and would allow
world stocks to rebuild, said the council.
   A decline in stocks after the estimated fall of 37 million tons
this season would leave an ``uncomfortably narrow margin of security
between world supply and demand,'' the council said.
   If the council is correct about 1989-90 wheat production
exceeding use once again and starting another buildup in surpluses,
it could mean downward pressure on wheat prices.
   The Agriculture Department has not made any such projections yet.
   ``Our tendency over time is to have more faith in the USDA
projections,'' said Carl Schwensen, the association's executive vice
president here. ``The wheat council projections have a constituency
of developing countries that they inform through their various
forecasts.''
   Schwensen added in a telephone interview: ``Whether it exceeds
(consumption) or not, I think it's heroic to make any predictions
about that at this point.''
   Stockpiles built up during the wheat glut of the mid-1980s are
being depleted this season because of the sharp drop in 1988-89
wheat production caused by droughts in the United States and Canada.
   World wheat production for 1988-89 now is forecast by the council
at 500 million tons, 13 million tons below the previous season's
figure and 37 million down on the 1986-87 record.
   Tighter supplies this season have led to higher world prices
which are encouraging growers to increase plantings for 1989-90, the
council said.
   The USDA has forecast global wheat production this season at
502.5 million tons, about in line with the council's estimate for
1988-89. But USDA has not yet projected world wheat output for
1989-90.
   But department officials have been saying that the recent higher
prices and draw-down of wheat stocks are expected to boost plantings
for next season.

   An Agriculture Department report says that even
if depleted soil moisture is replenished, the effects of the 1988
drought will continue to be ``very much in evidence'' next year
because of the disruptions is has caused.
   Net cash income, the difference between cash expenses and cash
gross receipts, is expected to be down somewhat from this year's
near-record $57 billion to between $48 billion and $52 billion.
   But the department's Economic Research Service said that would
still put 1989 net cash income at the fourth-highest level on record.
   Economists say net cash income was high in 1988 despite the
drought because so many farmers sold off commodities harvested in
earlier years, and because of large federal payments.
   Total crop and livestock receipts in 1989 are expected to rise
slightly from this year's record level, the report said.
   As a result of the drought and the draining of stored
inventories, farmers may boost crop plantings by as much as 30
million acres, but that will increase production costs. Government
payments are expected to decline 20 percent to 25 percent.

   It is unclear whether Myers, a Missouri farmer, will remain as
deputy. One name that surfaced hours after Yeutter was announced is
that of Jack Parnell, California state agriculture commissioner, who
reportedly is being pushed by strong California interests for Myers'
job.

   Here is the text of President Reagan's
statement on the Palestine Liberation Organization as issued
Wednesday by the White House:
   The Palestine Liberation Organization today issued a statement in
which it accepted United Nations Security Council Resolutions 242
and 338, recognized Israel's right to exist, and renounced terrorism.
   These have long been our conditions for a substantive dialogue.
They have been met. Therefore, I have authorized the State
Department to enter into a substantive dialogue with PLO
representatives.
   The Palestine Liberation Organization must live up to its
statements. In particular, it must demonstrate that its renunciation
of terrorism is pervasive and permanent.
   The initiation of a dialogue between the United States and the
PLO representatives is an important step in the peace process, the
more so because it represents the serious evolution of Palestinian
thinking toward realistic and pragmatic positions on key issues.
   But the objective of the United States remains, as always, a
comprehensive peace in the Middle East. In that light, we view this
development as one more step toward the beginning of direct
negotiations between the two parties, which alone can lead to such a
peace.
   The United States' special commitment to Israel's security and
well being remains unshakeable. Indeed, a major reason for our entry
into this dialogue is to help Israel achieve the recognition and
security it deserves.

   A taxi cab passenger watched in horror as a gunman
forced his way into the car and shot the driver to death, police
said.
   The passenger, a Chicago man who was being driven Wednesday from
Miami International Airport to the downtown Hyatt Regency Hotel,
told police the gunman jumped into the cab when driver Rubert
Fleurimon slowed down in the Liberty City section. The gunman then
fatally shot the 37-year-old Fleurimon and jumped out while the cab
was still rolling.
   The gunman's motive was not known.
   ``Apparently he didn't stop fast enough and was shot in the back
of the head,'' said Detective Mike Gonzalez. ``We don't know what he
was doing in Liberty City. The passenger doesn't know either. He
isn't familiar with Miami.''
   Robert Emery, a Yellow Cab operations manager, said the normal
route from the airport to the hotel does not go through Liberty
City, a high crime area.
   The cab swerved out of control and crashed as Fleurimon sat dying
in the driver's seat. When the passenger tried to pull his briefcase
out of the cab, someone in a gathering crowd stole it, Gonzalez said.
   Other people escorted the man for four or five blocks to a phone
where he called another cab, Gonzalez said. Then the passenger,
whose name was not released, called police from the hotel.

<HEAD>Government Rules Out Further Probe Of Eastern's Financial Health</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By H. JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Transportation Department says it has no
plans to investigate further the financial fitness of Eastern
Airlines, denying a request from the airline's unions who claim the
company is being stripped of its assets.
   The department said Wednesday that Eastern ``has demonstrated
that it has the financial strength to operate safely and without due
risk to consumers'' and no formal fitness investigation is needed.
   The DOT also chastised the unions representing Eastern pilots and
machinists for bringing the petition. It accused the unions of
engaging in ``a transparent attempt to put pressure'' on management
by raising false safety concerns.
   ``Based on our earlier preliminary investigation of Eastern and
our review of publicly available current information, we believe
that Eastern remains fit to operate,'' said the department.
   There was no immediate comment from the unions.
   Eastern spokesman Robin Matell said in Miami that the DOT
decision was ``recognition that the pilots' claims are absolute
nonsense'' and ``reaffirms what was decided conclusively months
ago'' in another federal investigation of Eastern and its parent
company, Texas Air Corp.
   The DOT earlier this year conducted an in-depth look at the
fitness of Texas Air Corp., including an examination of various
financial transactions involving Eastern that had been put into
question by the unions. Last June the department said it found Texas
Air Corp., to be fit to operate, although it raised concerns about
the ongoing labor disputes at Eastern.
   On Wednesday, the department in a sharply worded order denying
the unions' petition said the ``only cause for concern with respect
to safety issues has been created by the irresponsible conduct'' of
the pilot and machinist unions in withdrawing from a joint
labor-management safety committee that the two sides had established
last July.
   After Eastern announced in October that it planned to sell its
Northeast shuttle operation to billionaire Donald Trump for $365
million, Eastern's unions withdrew from the safety committees, the
department said.
   On Dec. 7, the Air Line Pilots Association, which represents
Eastern pilots, filed its petition requesting that the department
reopen its investigation of Eastern's fitness because of the
proposed sale of the shuttle, the only profitable part of the
airline.
   The pilots union later was joined by the Machinists union in
making the request.
   The petition argued that the proposed sale of the Eastern Shuttle
to Trump amounts to ``downsizing'' Eastern and ``undermining the
airline's financial condition ... to the point that it may not
survive.''

<HEAD>Trial To Offer Rare Inside Look At Roman Catholic Church</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES ROWLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The trial of a Roman Catholic priest's claim
that Catholic University violated his academic freedom will provide
an unusual look at the church's inner workings.
   The suit was brought by the Rev. Charles E. Curran after the
university revoked his right to teach theology on grounds that his
writings were at odds with the faith.
   The suit pits Curran's claims of academic freedom against the
church's contention it has the power to discipline clergy who stray
from the orthodox teachings of the faith.
   Cardinal James A. Hickey, archbishop of Washington and chancellor
of the university, was the first witness as the trial got under way
Wednesday in Superior Court.
   Cardinal Joseph Bernardin, archbishop of Chicago who chaired the
university's board of trustees when action was first taken against
Curran, is also set to testify.
   Hickey defended the university's decision to revoke Curran's
``canonical mission'' to teach Roman Catholic theology after Vatican
authorities determined his writings were at odds with the faith.
   Curran, 54, refused an offer to teach ethics outside the
university's religious department.
   The university contends that it was merely enforcing the highest
authority of the Vatican, which had revoked Curran's right to teach
Roman Catholic theology.
   As an ordained priest, the university contends, Curran has an
obligation to obey the revocation of his mission to teach Catholic
theology.
   Curran contends he was never conferred such authority and his
contract to teach was no different than any other university
professor with tenure.
   Hickey defended the decision to discipline Curran, saying: ``the
case of Father Curran had become a widely known matter. It has
caused, in my opinion, a great deal of harm to the church.''
   The church has the power to declare that a theologian no longer
speaks for the faith ``when it believes a theologian has seriously
departed from the Catholic teaching,'' Hickey said.
   An investigation of Curran's writings, which, among other things,
disputed the church's stance on birth control and homosexuality,
determined he was ``unfaithful to the role as professor of
theology,'' Hickey said.
   Because of the case's notoriety, it was important that he be
removed from the theology, particularly because of the university's
``unique relationship both with the Holy See and the Catholic Church
in this country,'' Hickey said.
   Founded in 1885 by Pope Leo XIII, Catholic University functions
as one of few ``pontifical universities'' in the country that is
governed directly by the church.
   The action was taken because ``it seemed inconceivable to the
board of trustees of the university that we could simply join in
defiance on the part of Father Curran,'' Hickey testified.
   Curran's attorney, Paul Saunders, said the decision to remove
Curran from the ecclesiastical faculty violated academic freedoms
specifically conferred on the faculty following a strike over the
issue in 1967.
   Moreover, Saunders said Curran's dissenting views, summarized in
his work ``Faithful Dissent,'' were well known to the church long
before his dismissal earlier this year.
   ``The actions that have been taken against him are not because of
some brand-new heretical position,'' Saunders said.
   ``If the notion of academic freedom in the specific context of
the present case means anything, it means the university guaranteed
a freedom in the face of public dissent from certain church
teachings,'' Saunders said in pre-trial arguments.
   But Kevin T. Baine, who represents the university, said the court
had no right to question the church's application of canon law,
which governed the relationship between Curran and the university.
   ``Father Curran thinks he hasn't an obligation to his church to
abide by this declaration,'' Bain said.
   Curran was trying to change the university into something that he
``wants it to be,'' Baine argued.
   Judge Frederick H. Weisberg agreed that the court has no power to
second-guess application of church law, but ruled that the issue in
the case is whether these canons formed the basis of Curran's
contract.
   Hickey said that Curran was implicitly conferred a ``canonical
mission'' when he was hired.
   Following his suspension from Catholic University in 1987, Curran
was a visiting professor at Cornell. He currently has a one-year
appointment at the University of Southern California.

   A pioneering private effort to help
underprivileged students get college scholarships has achieved a
graduation rate sharply above the national average, a study
concluded.
   The 21-year-old, privately financed Cleveland Scholarship
Programs released a study of its first two decades Wednesday showing
80 percent of those who got grants from the program and enrolled in
four-year colleges graduated.
   Nationally, about 50 percent of students who start college
receive their degrees, the program said.
   CSP has assisted more than 57,000 students, most from Cleveland
public high schools, since its founding. Last year 3,700 students
received specialized help applying for college admission and
scholarships, and 540 underprivileged students received grants
averaging $375.
   Under the program, counseling is available to all students but
only students from underprivileged economic backgrounds can qualify
for its direct grants.
   ``They really helped me a lot,'' said Dwight W. Newsom, 34, who
graduated from Bowling Green State University in 1976 and is now a
sales executive with a concrete supply company.
   Newsom, the first member of his family to attend college, said
CSP provided him with crucial help meeting an array of unfamiliar
college admission and scholarship requirements and deadlines.
   ``As far as filling out paperwork, it was totally new for me,''
Newsom said.
   Christina R. Milano, the program's executive director, said the
result of the survey showed that ``a private partnership can have a
major impact on assisting economically disadvantaged students. ...
They can go on to college and be very successful.''
   CSP has 21 part-time counselers who visit high schools and meet
with students to help them apply to college and seek financial
assistance from various sources. Follow-up counseling continues
through the campus years.
   The alumni study was conducted by Eugene S. Uyeki of Case Western
Reserve University among a random sample of 633 students out of the
8,205 who received direct CSP grants from 1967 to 1983.
   Eighty-five percent of those surveyed had average family incomes
of less than $25,000 and more than half were the first family member
to attend college.
   CSP calls itself the nation's oldest non-profit, privately
supported college financial aid counseling service. It has been used
as a model for similar programs in New York, Miami and other cities.

   Five-year-old Jamie Clouse believes in Santa
Claus. Kriss Kringle, after all, saved his life.
   The boy's mother, Robin Clouse, had stopped at a traffic light
Tuesday when Jamie began choking on the food he was eating.
   ``I was Christmas shopping and I was in the middle lane of
traffic,'' said Ms. Clouse, 29. ``My little boy was choking and I
didn't know what to do.''
   Ms. Clouse jumped from the car and pulled Jamie out of the
passenger side.
   ``He couldn't breathe and I was ready to turn him upside down,''
she said.
   Suddenly a man dressed in a Santa suit got of the van stopped in
the next lane and took the child from her arms.
   ``He performed the Heimlich maneuver,'' Ms. Clouse said.
   The food caught in Jamie's throat dislodged and he was able to
breath again. But traffic was backed up, and Santa Claus ambled back
in his van and drove away.
   ``I didn't get a chance to thank him and I don't even know who he
was,'' Ms. Clouse said.
   Jamie does. It was Santa Claus, who was in the van ``on his way
to the North Pole to get his reindeer for Christmas Eve,'' Jamie
said. ``He saved my life.''

   The Son Of Heaven exhibit, a display of priceless
artifacts of the emperors of China, was inspected by a woman who
knew them.
   Fun Ai Chao Lum, a 104-year-old Seattle resident born in China
during the Qing Dynasty, took in the exhibition Wednesday at the
Seattle Center, along with other seniors citizens from the Sunshine
Garden, a day-care center for elderly Chinese.
   The exhibit includes items more than 2,600 years old. Mrs. Lum's
62-year-old son, James, said she was especially interested in the
clothing and possessions of the Qing Dynasty, who ruled China from
1644 to 1911.
   Escorted by Liu Shishu, the chief curator from the Chinese team
accompanying the exhibition, Mrs. Lum appeared engrossed by much of
the artwork and regalia of the imperial Chinese court, listening
intently as Liu's Mandarin was translated into her native Cantonese.
   ``She remembers the last three emperors very well,'' her son
said. ``Anything before that's a little fuzzy.''

   Yes, Virginia, there really is a Santa
Claus, a judge decided after hearing from a jolly, old man who
bellowed the familiar ``Ho, Ho, Ho!''
   In a grave tone, Municipal Judge George T. Choppelas said he was
drawing partly on legal precedent set in the movie, ``Miracle on
34th Street,'' in which a New York court found for the defendant _
Santa Claus.
   ``As long as there is love and generosity and gift-giving, this
court is going to find that there really, really is a Santa Claus,''
Choppelas said Wednesday in the city's Court of Historical Review
and Appeals, a just-for-fun tradition with a real judge and lawyers.
   Choppelas made his ruling after a rollicking, 90-minute ``trial''
to consider the question.
   After rounds of argument, the event came to a standstill with the
appearance of a large man in a red suit and white beard who laughed
a hearty ``Ho, ho, ho!'' as he entered the courtroom, toting a sack
with toys and a golf club.
   Anti-Claus lawyer Frank Winston attacked him but got nowhere.
   An irate Claus reminded Winston that ``I got a letter from you
when you were 6 years old.'' Testimony from 5-year-old Dave Wharton
helped the Santa cause, despite browbeating by Winston, who escorted
the child off the stand.
   ``Shame on you,'' admonished the judge, before he made his ruling.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It was 44 years ago, but to those who were
there the horrible but largely unknown atrocity at Palawan in the
Philippines remains a vivid memory.
   ``Today we speak for those who endured the unendurable,'' said
Dan Crowley, 67, of Simsbury, Conn., who organized a memorial
service Wednesday in honor of 140 American prisoners of war
massacred by Japanese forces on Dec. 14, 1944. ``It's a cleansing
process, that these men possibly will be remembered by their fellow
Americans.''
   Glenn McDole, 67, a deputy sheriff in Polk County, Iowa, was one
of 11 men to escape the Palawan massacre, during which Japanese
troops lured the Americans into air raid holes, doused them with
gasoline and burned them to death.
   McDole was among the first of the POWs to arrive at the
sliver-shaped island in the Philippines. Japanese forces used the
prisoners to carve an air strip out of the jungle.
   Prisoners were beaten daily. Captured escapees were beheaded.
Tiny rations of rice left them emaciated, many weighing less than
100 pounds. Their beards grew down to their exposed ribs.
   ``I remember every bit of it,'' said McDole, who underwent an
appendectomy without any anesthesia during his captivity.
   The morning of the 14th, McDole remembers overhearing Japanese
soldiers talking. He said the Japanese believed an American convoy
was headed toward Palawan. After two years of hell, the POWs spirits
were finally lifted.
   ```Get to your air raid trenches, the Americans are coming,'''
McDole recalled his captors ordering. ``Without a doubt, we thought
we were going to be liberated,'' he said.
   The air raid siren was sounded. The men crammed into the trenches.
   The next thing McDole recalled seeing was a platoon of Japanese
troops entering the camp compound, some carrying buckets, others
torches.
   ``I couldn't believe what was going to happen. They threw
gasoline in the trenches, then the torches came in and it was just
an explosion,'' he said.
   ```My God, they're killing everybody','' the prisoners shouted as
McDole watched some of his comrades, knowing they were about to die,
run out of the trenches and grab on to Japanese soldiers to take
them to death.
   Some of the Americans had dug a tunnel, thinking they could
escape if U.S. troops bombed the island.
   McDole and about a handful of others made it out of the trenches,
rolled down a 60-foot bank and tried to run to the channel to swim
away. Many were shot down. McDole, pinned down by machine gun fire,
crawled under a garbage pile and stayed there through the night.
   The next day, he made it to a nearby cave and stayed there until
nightfall, when he swam five miles to another island. The next day,
trying to swim across an inlet, he became entangled in a fish trap,
eventually saved by a passing boat.
   Crowley, McDole and others lament the fact that the massacre of
Palawan is known by few Americans, but they said the simple memorial
service will help heal the wounds of the living and remember the
victims.
   ``We didn't come here with hatred in our hearts,'' Crowley told
about 40 people who attended the service in the shadow of the
Washington Monument. ``We want to remember those who paid the
ultimate price.''

<HEAD>Bush's Choice For Ag Secretary: Affable But Hard Bargainer</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RUTH SINAI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Friends say Clayton Yeutter, the designated
Agriculture Secretary in the Bush administration, is an able and
tough negotiator. Adversaries put the emphasis on ``tough'' but
acknowledge his ability to strike a bargain.
   Yeutter has been the nation's No. 1 negotiator on agricultural
and other international trade issues for the past 3{ years. He is
widely respected at home and abroad for his aggressive push to make
foreign markets more open to U.S. products and for his ability to
soften harsh protectionist legislation in Congress.
   A man who needs very little sleep, runs on a treadmill three
times a week and always appears affable and reasonable, Yeutter has
been an effective ambassador for U.S. producers and manufacturers.
   Cajoling and threatening, he managed to talk the Japanese into
opening their market to American beef exporters, and he persuaded
the Europeans to import more U.S. citrus fruits. He also spearheaded
a U.S. drive to stop Japan from dumping semiconductors, or selling
them abroad at prices below the cost of production.
   In naming him to his new post, Bush said Yeutter is ``so widely
respected'' that he would have a ``running start'' on plans to open
foreign markets even further to U.S. farm produce.
   Yeutter will have a chance to see through a contentious fight
with the European Economic Community over U.S. demands for the
elimination of agricultural subsidies. The next meeting on that is
scheduled for April in Geneva.
   His main opponent in that fight, chief EEC negotiator Willy De
Clercq, is also a fan. ``He is very good, very skillful, also very
stubborn,'' De Clercq said last week as he confronted Yeutter at
international trade talks in Montreal.
   Another participant at that meeting, Sen. Bob Packwood, R-Ore.,
had profuse praise for the 58-year-old Yeutter. ``He's dynamite,''
was the evaluation of the ranking minority member of the Finance
Committee. ``He's the guy you want to have back-to-back with you in
a knife fight.''
   Yeutter was considered for the top Agriculture Department job in
1980 by President-elect Reagan but was passed over because of
objections from some members of Congress.
   In the Nixon and Ford administrations he served as Assistant
Secretary of Agriculture, running regulatory programs such as meat
inspection and animal health, and overseeing a dramatic increase in
farm exports.
   The push for further increasing farm exports has been paramount
on his agenda as Trade Representative. Critics say he focused on
this to the detriment of other important trade issues.
   His main emphasis has been on attempts to get an international
commitment to eliminate farm subsidies, which the U.S. government
contends distort world trade and work to the detriment of American
farmers and exporters of farm products.
   ``Agriculture is too important to nibble at the edges of
reform,'' he repeatedly argued during the Montreal trade meeting
earlier this month. ``It must be changed radically.''
   Yeutter agreed to take the top agriculture post despite an often
stated desire to return to the private sector. In his last private
sector job he headed the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, the world's
second largest futures market.
   Yeutter, who has four children, grew up on a Nebraska farm and
still manages a 2,500 property in the town of Cozad.

   More than 150 mourners looked on as a
19-year-old Marine who was left behind on a desert training mission
was buried with full military honors at Fort Snelling National
Cemetery.
   ``We've brought our boy home,'' the Rev. Janice Bornhoft of
Victory Lutheran Church said at Wednesday's service for Jason
Rother, 19, of Minneapolis.
   ``Jason lived a full life,'' Bornhoft said. ``It was a short
life, but a full life. And I believe that is one of the gifts he
left us.''
   Rother's skeletal remains were found Dec. 4 about two miles north
of the Marine Corps' base in Twentynine Palms, Calif., and less than
a mile from a highway. Rother had last been seen on a training
exercise Aug. 31, 17 miles from where his remains were found.
   Three officers are facing courts-martial in connection with the
case and two others have been relieved of their commands.
   ``It was human error. It's as simple as that,'' said Maj. Gen.
Gene Deegan, commanding general of the Marine Corps Air Ground
Combat Center at Twentynine Palms, who attended the service.
   ``He was progressing well, progressing normally _ clearly a good
Marine,'' said Maj. John Coleman, operations officer at Camp
Lejeune, N.C., where Rother was based.
   Six Marines from Fort Snelling acted as pallbearers, and seven
participated in a 21-gun salute during Rother's burial. A lone
bugler played taps.
   ``It's going to be really hard. I don't think a day will go by
that I will not think of him,'' said Rother's mother, Cecelia King
of Minneapolis. ``I just hope some day I can think of him without
crying and just remember the good times.''
   Officers presented Mrs. King and Rother's father, Jeff Rother of
Cleveland, with American flags. Jeff Rother, who divorced his wife
in 1974, said he had lost contact with his three sons until recently.
   ``Jason and I were just starting to build a new relationship, to
open the lines of communication. We were just starting to get
reacquainted,'' Rother said.
   Jason's death has brought him closer to his other sons,
18-year-old Stephen and 17-year-old Robert, Rother said.
   ``I may have lost one son, but I'm kind of getting two back,'' he
said.

   A survey on home equity loans found most
borrowers aware they could face foreclosure if the money isn't
repaid, but a consumer group said many people still don't know what
they're getting into when they borrow against their homes.
   The Survey Research Center at the University of Michigan reported
Wednesday that 58 percent of homeowners had a first mortgage, and 11
percent had other loans secured by their equity, or the value of the
home beyond what is owed on it.
   The July-November survey of 2,510 households found that
traditional second mortgages _ loans for a fixed amount to be repaid
on a fixed schedule _ were held by 5 percent of the homeowners. The
newer home equity lines of credit, which allow people to borrow
money at their discretion up to an approved credit limit, were held
by 6 percent.
   Eighty-four percent of the homeowners with loans secured by their
equity listed foreclosure as a risk should they be unable to repay
the money, and another 6 percent to 7 percent mentioned other legal
actions as a possibility, said Richard T. Curtin, director of the
university's Surveys of Consumers.
   ``Their caution in using their home equity line of credit ...
comes out of this understanding of the consequences of missing
payments,'' he said.
   Among families with approved lines of credit, 31 percent had not
borrowed any money, either because the planned need for the money
had not arisen or because the credit line was meant to serve as a
cash reserve in case of emergency, according to the survey.
   Among those who had borrowed against their lines of credit, the
median outstanding debt was just 10 percent of net home equity,
although the median amount the families had authorization to borrow
was 32 percent of net equity.
   ``They're well aware that they're betting their home and they're
very cautious about it,'' Curtin said.
   Some consumer groups have criticized banks for advertising low
rates on home equity loans that are available only for a short
period and for failing to disclose important information about
conditions and fees on the loans.
   Michelle Meier of the private Consumers Union said ``the
suggestion that consumers generally know the risks they are assuming
is not justified'' by the survey's findings.
   ``We think there are a lot of problems,'' she said. Even
consumers who are aware of the risk of foreclosure may be surprised
by changing repayment plans, rising interest rates and other
conditions that could make it more difficult to repay their loans,
she said.
   The University of Michigan survey was supported by 35
corporations, financial institutions and trade associations with an
interest in home equity loans. Curtin discussed the results at a
news conference sponsored by the American Financial Services
Association and the U.S. League of Savings Institutions, two of the
groups that helped finance the survey.

   The U.S. decision to start a dialogue with
Yasser Arafat's PLO could increase political divisions in Israel at
a time when sensitive talks are under way to form a new government.
   It could also put Israel on a collision course with its main
benefactor for the first time since the Lebanon war in 1982.
   Initial reactions indicated both major political parties, Prime
Minister Yitzhak Shamir's Likud bloc and Foreign Minister Shimon
Peres' Labor Party, opposed the U.S. move and would stand together
in rejecting the Palestine Liberation Organization as a partner for
negotiations.
   But if the U.S.-PLO talks go well, it will put pressure on Israel
to join the process. This could deepen the Labor-Likud split on the
peace issue and thwart talks on a power-sharing coalition.
   Shamir has said Arafat's new moderation was a ``mirage'' and
Israel would never accept the PLO as a negotiating partner. He has
argued the PLO's true aim remains the destruction of Israel.
   Moshe Arens, a candidate for foreign minister in the next
government and a close ally of Shamir, said the only possibility for
a change in Israel's view was if the PLO made good on its pledge to
abstain from terror.
   ``Let's say that if a year or two goes by and there are no acts
of terrorism, maybe some people in Israel will look at him in a
different light,'' Arens said on the NBC-TV Today show.
   Peres criticized the PLO for failing to renounce the violence
associated with the Palestinian uprising, such as throwing firebombs
at Israeli vehicles, but he praised Arafat for having ``learned to
say peace.'' The yearloing uprising has claimed the lives of at
least 323 Palestinians and 13 Israelis.
   Peres favors an international peace conference proposed by the
Arabs and is willing to trade some occupied land for a peace
agreement.
   Both ideas are vehemently opposed by Shamir, who says a
U.N.-sponsored forum would be biased against Israel and that Israel
would become weak and vulnerable if it gave up the West Bank and
Gaza Strip, home to about 1.7 million Palestinians and 70,000 Jewish
settlers.
   Peres is under pressure from dovish Labor members and liberals
allied with the party to encourage the peace process, even with the
PLO. If he does so, he will come into conflict with Shamir and the
possibility of another coalition government may evaporate.
   ``If the government stands by its position (opposing talks with
the PLO), I believe the Palestinian uprising and the prospects for
war will both grow,'' warned Ran Cohen, a parliament member of the
liberal Citizens Rights Movement, which was allied with Labor in the
Nov. 1 parliament elections.
   ``We are at a crossroads between war and peace. The government
must decide now,'' said Cohen.
   Yossi Beilin, a leading Labor Party dove and former Peres aide,
said it was ``too early to say'' if the U.S. move would have an
impact on coalition talks that had appeared to be making headway
after six weeks of on-again, off-again negotiations. Likud won 40
seats and Labor 39 in 120-member parliament.
   Shamir, who has until Dec. 26 to present a new government to
President Chaim Herzog, has said he could form a government without
Labor. It would be made up of small religious and right-wing
factions that favor annexation of the occupied territories and more
Jewish settlements.
   But such a government would be weak and isolated internationally,
especially if the new U.S. administration exerts pressure on Israel
to join the dialogue.
   The United States has been Israel's main military, economic and
political supporter. Israel receives $3 billion a year in U.S. aid,
more than any other country, and the U.S. veto in the U.N. Security
Council has staved off economic sanctions and other anti-Israeli
measures.
   U.S. administrations have rarely brought pressure on Israel, but
in 1982 President Reagan temporarily halted delivery of F-16 fighter
planes during Israel's 1982 invasion of Lebanon, which the U.S.
opposed.
   The United States also held out the possibility of increased aid
as an inducement to Israel and Egypt during peace negotiations that
resulted in Israel's only peace treaty with an Arab state in 1979.
   To withstand such pressure, Likud parliament member Benny Begin,
the son of former Prime Minister Menachem Begin, said Labor and
Likud should present a united front.
   ``This development highlights the necessity of establishing a
national unity government that would withstand this very grave
threat,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   President Reagan's decision to open direct
talks with the Palestine Liberation Organization capped a month of
intense debate over recent PLO overtures, a period in which the
United States stood virtually alone in the court of world opinion.
   The historic decision announced Wednesday came 18 days after
Secretary of State George P. Shultz refused to allow PLO chairman
Yasser Arafat to enter the United States to address the U.N. General
Assembly. Shultz said Arafat was kept out because his organization
``engaged in terrorism against Americans and others.''
   Shultz made clear Wednesday that he was not forgiving the PLO for
its past but said Arafat's statements earlier in the day recognizing
the existence of Israel and renouncing terrorism had met standards
set in 1975 for U.S. dialogue with the PLO.
   Many nations attacked Shultz's Nov. 26 decision not to allow
Arafat to come to New York. Shultz made the decision just 11 days
after the Palestine National Council, the PLO's governing body, had
accepted U.N. Resolutions 242 and 338 as the basis for peace talks
and world leaders were eager for Arafat to elaborate.
   The criticism of Shultz came from all quarters and included
assertions the United States was violating the agreement under which
New York serves as the organization's headquarters. Even Pope John
Paul II, without specifically referring to the decision, said
``every obstacle'' to the peace process should be removed.
   U.N. delegates passed a resolution denouncing the decision, and
only the United States and Israel voted against it. Britain
abstained. President Reagan and President-elect Bush stood by Shultz.
   The U.N. then took the unprecedented step of moving its debate to
Geneva, where on Tuesday Arafat made his long-awaited speech and
declared, ``Come, let us make peace.'' He recognized Israel's right
to exist, condemned terrorism and said peace negotiations should be
based on Resolutions 242 and 338 _ the three U.S. conditions for
opening a dialogue with the PLO.
   Shultz had received advance word Arafat might meet the standards
and had, according to sources, informed Israel that he was prepared
to announce that the United States was ready to talk to the PLO.
   But, after a close examination of the speech, the State
Department said Arafat's language was ambiguous and ``did not meet
our conditions.''
   Arafat then called a Wednesday news conference in Geneva and,
carefully choosing his words as advisers whispered to him, read a
statement that called for a Palestinian state to co-exist alongside
Israel, said resolutions 242 and 338 should serve as the framework
for peace talks and that ``we totally and absolutely renounce all
forms of terrorism, including individual terrorism, group and state
terrorism.''
   At virtually the same time Arafat spoke, Bush was applauding the
PLO leader's Tuesday speech but repeating the standard Reagan
administration line that it had not gone far enough.
   ``I want it clear, I want it unambiguous, I want is so nobody can
argue with what's been said,'' said the president-elect, apparently
unaware of the clearer statements just made by Arafat.
   But at the White House and the State Department, where again
advance word had been received that Arafat was ready to meet the
U.S. conditions, the day was spent determining whether he had.
   At 9:30 a.m. Reagan was briefed by Lt. Gen. Colin Powell, his
national security adviser, and told Arafat planned a news conference
at which he might use the ``right language.''
   Four hours later Reagan met with Shultz, Powell and White House
chief of staff Kenneth Duberstein and reaffirmed that he was ready
to authorize dialogue provided Arafat met the conditions, according
to White House aides.
   At 4 p.m. Shultz and Powell spoke again: Shultz had a copy of
Arafat's statement and indicated Arafat had met the conditions.
   Less than a half-hour passed when Powell briefed Bush and gave
him a copy of Arafat's statement.
   At 5:12 p.m., according to the White House, Powell and Duberstein
called Reagan and told him they believed Arafat had met the
conditions. Reagan immediately authorized the dialogue. The
administration notified Israel and others of the decision.
   Even before Shultz made the formal announcement, Israel issued a
statement saying it regretted the move.
   Shultz made it official just after 6:30 p.m.
   ``I didn't change my mind,'' he said in response to the
inevitable question. ``They made their statements clear.''

<HEAD>Orphanage Pleased To Get Sugar From Moonshine Raid In Time For

   Chefs at an orphanage are cooking up visions
of dancing sugarplums after learning they will get two tons of sugar
seized in a federal moonshine raid.
   ``We'll go through this sugar rather quickly,'' said Bobby Cobbs
of Virginia Baptist Children's Home and Family Services, adding that
orphanage workers planned to pick up the 4,400 pounds of Dixie
Crystal sugar today.
   ``We've been doing a lot of dreaming, figuring out what we can do
with it.''
   The sugar, along with moonshining apparatus that included 576
plastic one-gallon jugs, was seized in September when agents broke
up an alleged Franklin County moonshine operation.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Karen Peters filed a motion in federal
court Monday asking that the government give the sugar to the
orphanage in Salem.
   Judge James C. Turk agreed in an order filed Wednesday. The order
also allows the government to use the sugar as evidence when
defendants William Gray Stanley, Ricky Lee Dent and Michael Keith
Crook stand trial Jan. 18 on charges they ran a still and possessed
mash and untaxed liquor.
   The sugar would have gone to waste had it been stored as the case
worked its way through the courts, said Jim Silvey, a Bureau of
Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms agent.
   ``What we've done in the past is dispose of it in the federal
penitentiaries, but the closest one is in West Virginia,'' Silvey
said. ``We figured if the moonshine was in Virginia, we could use it
here.''
   Moonshining has been a problem in Franklin County for years, and
federal and state agents hoped that by monitoring large sugar sales,
they would be able to take a larger dent out of the illegal industry.
   Cobbs said the orphanage, which receives funds from Baptist
churches, other private sources and the government, has 72 children.
About 10 or 20 of the children ranging from ages 5 to 18 will stay
at the center during the Christmas holidays while others visit
relatives once school is out.
   Orphanage chefs will use the sugar to make extra holiday sweets
for the kids, with plenty of sugar left over for day-to-day use,
Cobbs said. The sugar is valued at about $1,500 and will bolster to
the orphanage's annual food budget of $106,000, he said.

   President Reagan's decision allowing the State
Department to deal directly with the Palestine Liberation
Organization came after a day of intense consultations inside the
administration.
   The White House gave this chronology of Wednesday's events:
   _9:30 a.m. EST: Reagan's national security adviser, Lt. Gen.
Colin Powell, briefed the president and discussed PLO Chairman
Yasser Arafat's press conference and the possibility that the
``right language'' might be used, Fitzwater said.
   _1:30 p.m. EST: Secretary of State George Shultz met with Reagan,
his chief of staff Kenneth Duberstein, Powell and Duberstein's
deputy, M.B. Oglesby, and the president was told that Arafat was
definitely expected to make a statement. Reagan reaffirmed his
commitment to state he'd be willing to authorize a dialogue if
Arafat met the required U.S. conditions.
   _4:00 p.m. EST: Shultz called Powell to tell him that he had a
copy of Arafat's statement and that the State Department's initial
assessment was that the statement was acceptable.
   _4:25 p.m. EST: Powell briefed President-elect Bush and showed
him a copy of the Arafat statement.
   _5:12 p.m. EST: Powell and Duberstein called the president to say
that they had reviewed Arafat's statement, and that the assessment
of his top aides was that it met the U.S. conditions. They asked the
president for his final decision, and Reagan decided at that point
to authorize the dialogue.

   Here, at a glance, is background on the Palestinian people and
the Palestine Liberation Organization:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   HISTORY _ Under the U.N. partition plan of 1947 the West Bank was
to have been the nucleus of an independent Palestinian state, but in
the 1948 war Israel captured some of the area allotted to Palestine,
and Jordan annexed the rest. In 1967, Israel captured Jordan's share
of the West Bank and took the Gaza Strip from Egypt.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   THE PEOPLE _ About 850,000 Palestinians live in the West Bank,
including 400,000 refugees whose families fled the territory that
became Israel in 1948. Since Israeli occupation began in 1967,
62,000 Jewish settlers have established more than 100 settlements on
land expropriated by the government. More than two-thirds of Gaza's
650,000 Palestinian residents are refugees crowded into eight U.N.
camps, many living in single-room shacks built from scraps of wood
and corrugated iron. About 8,000 Jewish settlers also live in the
Gaza Strip.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   THE DISPUTED LANDS _ The West Bank is two bulges of land on the
west side of the Jordan River, with Jerusalem between them, totaling
2,323 square miles. The Gaza Strip is a coastal slip of land that
covers 141 square miles.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   THE PLO _ The Palestine Liberation Organization was established
in 1964 by the Arab League to press for a Palestinian homeland. Its
component groups field an estimated 5,500 full-time guerrillas, with
probably three times that number in irregular forces. The PLO also
operates representative offices worldwide, sponsors student
scholarships and conducts other government-like operations. Its
legislative body is the Palestine National Couuncil.
   The PLO's bureaucracy and fighting force, concentrated in Lebanon
before 1982, was scattered across the Middle East after Israel
invaded Lebanon in 1982. Chairman Yasser Arafat moved PLO
headquarters to Tunisia in 1982.
   The PLO is an umbrella group for at least eight factions. Arafat
heads the largest, the relatively moderate Fatah.
   Fatah and two other factions make up about 80 percent of the
PLO's strength. They are the Popular Front for the Liberation of
Palestine led by George Habash, which follows a Marxist-Leninist
ideology, and the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine
led by Nayef Hawatmeh.

   Many police once thought all the motivation people
needed to report crime was a sense of civic duty and a few words
from Officer McGruff, the cartoon bloodhound who barked ``take a
bite out of crime.''
   Not anymore. Police are increasingly turning to cash rewards and
morbid crime re-enactments on television to lure John Q. Public to
the phone.
   The police-sponsored ``Crime Stoppers'' genre, most familiar as
60-second spots on local TV, took a giant leap toward Hollywood last
week with broadcasts of ``Manhunt: A Chance to End the Nightmare.''
   With help from an independent film company, Seattle police
investigators created two hours of televised murder, mayhem and
mystery in a plea for clues to the country's worst unsolved serial
murder case: the ``Green River'' slayings of at least 40 women in
the Northwest.
   The syndicated program, distributed to 137 stations nationwide,
included a re-enacted murder attempt, real footage of police
unearthing a victim, and interviews with grieving relatives. Viewers
were urged to turn in a crook _ and maybe collect a $100,000 reward.
   ``The show was designed to push an emotional button in the
viewer,'' said producer Beth Broday.
   It apparently did. The program, broadcast Dec. 7 and repeated
during the past week, drew more than 7,600 calls to a toll-free
hotline.
   Investigators rejoiced at the flood of fresh tips and praised the
marriage of sleuthing and the media.
   ``It's the most effective tool in law enforcement,'' declared
Detective Myrle L. Carner, director of Seattle's Crime Stoppers
program.
   The popularity of such programs reflects a ``get tough on crime
revival,'' said Art Lurigio, assistant professor of psychology at
Northwestern University and co-author of a 1986 study on the
programs for the U.S. Justice Department.
   ``People are looking to have some impact on crime, alleviate
their fears, and regain some control,'' said Lurigio, although he
cautioned ``there may be some negative consequences.''
   Offering large cash rewards and anonymity may encourage false
accusations, and the nightly re-enactments could unnecessarily
increase fear of crime, Lurigio said.
   Crime Stoppers began 12 years ago in Albuquerque, N.M., when
police and civic leaders decided they needed a new weapon to fight
increasing crime. The premise: grab attention with a televised
``Crime of the Week'' re-enactment, then promise cash rewards and
anonymity to anyone reporting any serious crime.
   The concept took off. More than 600 U.S. communities now have
Crime Stoppers programs, said Tim Kline, a retired Albuquerque
police officer and president of Crime Stoppers International, which
helps set up local programs.
   Crime Stoppers tips have helped solve more than 210,000 felonies
and led to the recovery of $1.3 billion in narcotics and stolen
property, Kline said.
   In the last two TV seasons, networks and syndicates have created
dramatic variations on the Crime Stoppers theme. Not only are the
programs popular with viewers, they also are successful. Of 115
fugitives portrayed on Fox Broadcasting Co.'s ``America's Most
Wanted,'' 55 are in jail, Fox says. NBC says its ``Unsolved
Mysteries'' has broadcast 50 stories and helped solve 11 cases.
   On Wednesday, authorities in Nevada arrested a man suspected of
bilking investors of up to $3.5 million after they were tipped off
by a maid who found a note in his motel room saying, ``The Unsolved
Mysteries program was a bombshell.'' The show had featured his case
Nov. 30.
   The police behind last week's ``Manhunt'' program hope the
success rubs off on the maddening Green River case.
   More than $15 million has been spent hunting for the killer,
whose first victims were dragged from the Green River, south of
Seattle, in 1982. The murderer now is officially blamed for the
deaths of 40 women, most linked to prostitution and street life.
   The killings stopped in 1984, but investigators say the murderer
may have moved on. They're studying whether he might be responsible
for at least some of the slayings of more than 30 transients and
prostitutes since 1985 in San Diego. And the discovery of six female
bodies near New Bedford, Mass., since July, some of them believed to
have been prostitutes, prompted police speculation that the killer
had crossed the country.
   During ``Manhunt,'' viewers were urged to report clues not only
to the Green River case, but to any serious crime in the country.
   Calls came in from every state. At least two people said they
were the Green River killer. Several others said the killer had
confessed to them.
   Some calls were pranks, and many offered information too dated or
general to be helpful. Investigators said it will take weeks to sort
through the 3,000 tips that seem initiallly promising.
   One tip already has produced results, albeit unrelated to the
Green River case. Police said two murder suspects were arrested
Saturday in Seattle and taken to jail.
   Surprisingly, that's where many tipsters are, too.
   ``We get a lot of calls from jails,'' said Carner. ``The old
saying that there's no honor among thieves is true. They love to rat
on each other.''

   Color-coded registration stickers soon will
determine which day of the week private vehicles will be allowed to
circulate in this smog-plagued metropolis.
   The plan to issue stickers in five different colors was one of
several anti-contamination measures announced late Wednesday by the
federal government.
   Officials also said holiday school vacations that began Wednesday
would be extended until February in the city in a bid to cut down
childrens' exposure to health-threatening winter smog.
   In addition to the restrictions on private vehicles, Mexico City
also will try to battle its critical air pollution problem by
increasing vehicle inspections, prohibiting the burning of tires,
plastics and other contaminating wastes in open areas, and setting
hours for cargo loading and unloading in the city during the smog
season.
   The announcement did not mention sanctions against violators of
the new regulations. Generally, enforcement of most regulations in
Mexico is lax.
   It said that from Jan. 9 to March 21 vehicles observed to be
contaminating the air will be taken out of circulation.
   Beginning Jan. 16, smog checks will be obligatory for cargo
vehicles whether they have gas or diesel engines. The anti-burning
regulation will be in effect from Dec. 15 to March 21.
   Additional measures to reduce air pollution will be announced
before March 21, according to a bulletin issued by the president's
office Wednesday night.
   City spokesman Jose Luis Manjarrez said officials from the
federal health, education and ecology departments would sign an
agreement extending the Dec. 15-Jan. 2 holiday vacation until Feb. 1.
   He said schoolchildren would make up the lost month of classes
next summer. There are about 2.3 million students in Mexico City
public schools, according to federal government statistics.
   ``We have agreed to protect the children of Mexico City and part
of that is to change the school hours,'' Manjarrez said. ``We all
know that the thermal inversion layer levels will be worse during
the winter and that we have to take measures.''
   Last winter, authorities delayed the start of public school
classes by two hours to limit exposure. Children often found
themselves outdoors on the street in the early morning, waiting for
buses while traffic was at its worst and smog at its strongest.
   Homer Aridjis, president of the Group of 100, a leading
environmental organization, said the schedule change would do little
to restrict smog exposure. School-age children breathe foul Mexico
City air whether they're at school or at home, he said.
   ``The solution is not to change the school calendar,'' Aridjis
said. ``It is not going to change the pollution situation. More
drastic measures, such as less traffic, are necessary.''
   Mexico City's smog regularly worsens during winter when a layer
of warm air traps cold air bearing tons of pollutants near ground
level. The phenomenon is known as a thermal inversion. The condition
can last for hours, sometimes days.
   The mountains that ring the Valley of Mexico, where Mexico City
lies, prevent the dispersal of smog by winds; rains are scarce in
winter, permitting winds to lift tons of dust bearing particle
pollution and dried fecal matter off the dry Lake Texcoco lakebed.
   About 18 million people live in the Mexico City metropolitan area.

   Yasser Arafat has come a long way from a
guerrilla commando force leader to a statesman.
   He is the symbol of Palestinians' desire for a homeland, never
wavering in his dream of creating a Palestinian state.
   For nearly three decades the 59-year-old Arafat has been both
revolutionary chieftain and politician, ricocheting between touching
the dream and losing control of the movement to rivals backed by
other Arab governments.
   Each setback of the PLO _ chased from Jordan in 1970 and from
Lebanon in 1982 _ was trumpeted as the final demise of Arafat. Each
time, he returned.
   And this month he piloted the PLO through making the concessions
demanded by the United States before it would open a dialogue.
   Israel has denounced him for years as the archterrorist
masterminding attempts to destroy the Jewish state. Washington just
last month denied him a visa to address the United Nations, citing
his links to terrorism.
   But the base of his success has been widespread support among the
world's 5.5 million Palestinians. In the occupied West Bank and Gaza
Strip, his pictures sprout among demonstrators in the year-old
uprising against Israel's 21-year occupation.
   Arafat seems consumed by his mission for a homeland. He does not
smoke or drink, and is notorious for late-night meetings.
   Arafat, without wife, children or fixed address, says he married
the cause when he formed an underground Palestinian movement, Fatah,
in October 1959.
   His date and place of birth have never been confirmed, though the
PLO does not dispute the version that he was born Aug. 29, 1929, in
Jerusalem's Old City.
   Born Mohammed Abed Ar'ouf Arafat, his father came from a
prosperous merchant clan. On his mother's side he can trace his
ancestry back to Fatima, daughter of the Moslem prophet Mohammed.
   Arafat says he smuggled arms to Arab forces during the 1948
Arab-Israeli war, then went to Egypt to enroll in Cairo University.
In 1952, he was elected president of the Palestinian student union
in Egypt.
   Arafat left Egypt in 1957 after taking part in the Suez War as a
reserve officer in the Egyptian army. He worked in Kuwait as a
government engineer before forming his own successful contracting
firm.
   The PLO was created in 1964, and Arafat brought Fatah above
ground on Jan. 1, 1965 with its first military commando operation
against Israel.
   Arafat led commando operations against Israel before the 1967
Arab-Israeli war. Later, he traveled clandestinely through the West
Bank to organize Fatah military units. He was elected PLO chairman
in 1969.
   In 1970, he faced his first serious challenge from an Arab
government. Jordan's King Hussein, threatened by the growing power
of the Palestinians within his kingdom, moved his army against them.
   Arafat escaped one of two acknowledged assassination attempts
that year; the second came in October 1971 on an inspection tour in
Syria. He says he never sleeps in the same place for two nights
running.
   In 1974, the United Nations granted the PLO observer status. An
enduring image of Arafat is when he addressed the General Assembly
offering an olive branch of peace but wearing an empty holster.
   In the late 1970s, his guerrillas became embroiled in Lebanon's
civil war. Their strength in southern Lebanon led Israel to invade
in 1982. Palestinian guerrillas were scattered from Tunisia to Syria
after world governments intervened to lift an Israeli siege of the
PLO in Beirut.
   Guerrilla leaders, disgusted with Arafat's loyalty to commanders
who did not stand and fight the Israelis, got Syrian backing to try
to unseat him. Arafat was expelled from Damascus in June 1983.
Pro-Arafat forces were evacuated from Tripoli, Lebanon, that
December.
   But Arafat moved PLO headquarters to Tunis and gradually rebuilt
a consensus among Palestinian groups. That consensus _ glued
together with the uprising in the occupied territories _ led to this
month's announced change in the Palestinian position and the
projected dialogue with the United States.
   Arafat and the PLO made a political drive in the last month to
convince the world they are peaceful, moderate, and worthy of
representing Palestinians in the Middle East peace process.

<TEXT>
   In a rare show of unity, ruling and
opposition lawmakers today approved without debate legislation that
will raise their salaries by 85 percent on Jan. 1.
   The two-minute action raised a lawmaker's monthly salary from the
current $2,550 to $4,730, bringing their pay to the level of Cabinet
ministers.
   The bill was approved by the National Assembly's Budget
Settlement Committee. It's passage by the full assembly will be a
mere formality.
   Many South Koreans criticized the steep pay increase as
unethical, citing the meager incomes of most factory workers and
high inflation.
   According to industry figures, a footwear assembly line worker
with five years of job experience makes about $550 a month,
including allowances.

   A postal employee pulled a shotgun out at the
main post office Wednesday night, wounded three people and holed up
in the building with at least one hostage, authorities said.
   The gunman eluded police for about five hours before agents found
him in a room used for coffe breaks during a room-to-room search of
the block-wide building, said FBI spokesman Volney Hayes.
   The gunman, who Hayes said was holding at least one hostage,
fired two shots at agents, who then backed off.
   ``He was barricaded behind a door. As the agents approached he
fired,'' said Cesta Ayers, a post office spokesman.
   Negotiations with the gunman were being conducted by telephone,
Ayers said early Thursday.
   Earlier, Hayes said, the gunman got into an argument with a
co-worker and pulled a weapon out of a bag.
   Authorities identified the gunman as Warren Murphy, about 40, a
six-year postal worker. One of the people shot was the person Murphy
argued with, Hayes said. He did not identify the victim or elaborate.
   ``I was going to mail this box of stuff I have and the security
guard came down. He was real excited,'' said a witness, Pat
Wingerter of New Orleans. ``The guard was screaming, `There's a guy
with a gun!'''
   Four hours after the incident began at 8:30 p.m., authorities
said an undetermined number of postal employees were apparently
still inside the building but it was not known if they were being
held hostage.
   About midnight, a dozen postal employees who had been laying low
on the vast second floor escaped through a back door, Hayes said,
leaving about 20 to 30 or the 500 workers on the night shift
unaccounted for.
   ``We still think he's in there,'' he said. ``Some postal
inspectors have evacuated. ... They weren't really hostages.''
   Hayes said the workers who escaped had seen Murphy but hadn't had
any contact with him. The employees were hustled away by FBI after
they came out of the building.
   Ayers said Murphy may have had marital problems. ``The
information we have at this time ... is that his wife did leave him
and left the city. We have not talked to him, but that is the rumor
we have at this time,'' Ayers said.
   Two patients were at Tulane Medical Center where they were in
stable condition, a Tulane spokesman said. One person was hit in the
thigh and one in the arm. A third person was wounded in the eye and
was undergoing surgery late Wednesday at Charity Hospital, a
hospital spokeswoman said.
   ``I don't think anybody is hurt real bad at the present time,''
said Dr. Norman McSwain, police surgeon. ``I know nobody has any
life-threatening injuries.''
   Ayers said unidentified relatives were at the scene to assist
with negotiations. There was no word if Murphy was demanding
anything, said Hayes, whose agency was in charge of the situation
because the post office is federal property.
   Jerry Vale, a postal worker who was working on the ground floor,
said, ``I just saw some people come running from upstairs, saying
there was a man loose with a shotgun.''
   A security guard told police that the gunman might be hiding on
the second floor where letter-sorting machines and other large
equipment is located.
   ``There's plenty of places to hide up there,'' Vale said.
   Special police teams dressed in flak jackets surrounded the post
office on Loyola Avenue on the edge of the central business district.
   Wingerter said the security guard ran to the door to make sure
the half dozen or so postal workers and customers in the immediate
area escaped out the front safely.
   ``I heard one shot and then the people started coming out,'' he
said. ``Even after the shot, there were people driving up mailing
letters for about five minutes. It was crazy.''
   Adding to the confusion, holiday shoppers poured out the adjacent
Macy's department store to see what was going on.
   On Aug. 20, 1986, part-time mailman Patrick Henry Sherrill walked
into the post office in Edmond, Okla., with guns and ammunition
hidden in his mail bag and began shooting.
   He fatally wounded 14 postal workers and injured six others
before killing himself. Police, thinking Sherrill was holding
workers hostage, waited outside for an hour before entering the
building to aid the wounded and to free employees who had hidden
from the gunman. Witnesses said the final shots were heard about 40
minutes before police entered the building.

   Major U.S. Jewish groups warily supported the Reagan
administration's historic decision to sit down with the Palestine
Liberation Organization, while Arab-Americans said the policy
reversal rekindled hope for Middle East peace.
   Several American Jewish leaders said they trusted President
Reagan and Secretary of State George P. Shultz in their decision to
open a ``substantive dialogue'' with the PLO, but called on PLO
Chairman Yasser Arafat to back his words of peace with action.
   ``We understand that the United States, having set standards for
speaking with the PLO and the PLO having met those minimum
standards, that it is appropriate for us to live up to its
commitment,'' said Abraham H. Foxman, national director of the
Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith in New York.
   ``It is a first step. Now we must watch to see if the PLO will
match words with deeds.''
   James Zogby, executive director of the Arab-American Institute in
Washington, called the government's decision to end its longtime
rejection of the PLO as a party to Middle East peace efforts an
``important step forward.''
   ``The dialogue should throw into sharp relief the failure of
Israel to say yes to the very issues that the PLO has now acceded
to,'' Zogby said. ``Our hope is that the dialogue is productive and
that peace is now possible.''
   In Washington, legislators from both parties cautiously endorsed
the move.
   ``It may be a blind alley, but an alley worth treading with eyes
open,'' said Sen. Richard Lugar, R-Ind. ``This dialogue in no way
mitigates our steadfast support of Israel. But I hope Israel will at
least be willing to informally acknowledge this process as a worthy
attempt.''
   ``In the interest of peace and security for Israel and all
parties in the region, the U.S. has no sensible choice but to begin
a dialogue,'' said U.S. Rep. David Obey, D-Wis., chairman of the
House foreign operations appropriations subcommittee.
   But, he added, ``the proof will still lie in deeds and not
words.''
   Atlanta Mayor Andrew Young, who nearly a decade ago was forced by
then-President Carter to resign as the U.S. ambassador to the United
Nations for meeting with a PLO representative, applauded the
decision, saying, ``People were not ready for this before now.''
   Reagan said Wednesday he authorized the State Department to enter
into ``a substantive dialogue'' with the Palestinian group after
Arafat said he was renouncing ``all forms of terrorism.''
   Shultz, who only two weeks ago barred Arafat from entering the
United States and called him an ``accessory'' to terrorism, said the
PLO issued a statement in which it met all three U.S. conditions for
a dialogue. The conditions were acceptance of U.N. Security Council
resolutions affirming the right of all states to live in peace,
recognition of Israel and renunciation of terrorism.
   While the Israeli government swiftly criticized the move, many
U.S. Jewish groups were reluctant to do so, reflecting the
dissension that has marred relations between Israel and many
American Jews over Israel's hardline policies on the West Bank and
Gaza Strip.
   Morris B. Abram, chairman of the Conference of Presidents of
Major American Jewish Organizations in New York, said in a
statement: ``We neither approve nor disapprove. We accept it. We
trust the United States.''
   ``The first action the U.S. should take in its conversations with
the PLO should be to demand that the PLO repeal the Palestine
National Covenant, which calls for the destruction of the state of
Israel,'' he said.
   ``Unless and until the PLO translates its words into the deed of
repealing that covenant, there can be no progress toward peace in
the Middle East.''
   However, the Simon Wiesenthal Center in Los Angeles, dedicated to
the study of the Holocaust and promoting Israel in world affairs,
said it was disappointed with the decision.
   ``While both President Reagan and Secretary of State George
Shultz have proven themselves to be the staunchest friends of the
state of Israel, the road they have chosen to embark is fraught with
danger,'' said the statement read by a spokesman, Rabbi Abraham
Cooper.
   The response from Arab-American organizations, while generally
favorable, was in some cases tinged with bitterness. M.T. Mehdi,
president of the American Arab Relations Committee in New York, said
his organization was ``not impressed.''
   ``The State Department should talk to Israel and urge it not to
shoot at the Palestinian youth nor to use American airplanes to
attack Palestinian camps in Lebanon,'' he said.

   Jones, 26, called the emergency number early Tuesday and was on
the line with Officer Laurie Matthews for about 10 minutes before
giving birth to her full-term daughter. Paramedics arrived moments
later.
   ``I'm having my baby _ I'm at home,'' Jones told Matthews.
   Jones said she was alone, but that her parents were on their way

   An ambulance was dispatched, and Matthews told Jones to stay on

   The delivery went just fine, said a paramedic who took the mother

<TEXT>
   A snowstorm forced rescuers to leave two
men stranded on a glacier in southeast Alaska for a second day after
their small plane made an emergency landing on the remote river of
ice.
   Once visibility improved today, Coast Guard officials planned to
send a helicopter to pick up the men, who messaged by radio that
they were unhurt and wearing survival gear, said Coast Guard Lt.
Rick Ehret.
   ``They gave every indication that they're still in very good
shape, are nice and warm, have plenty of food and can stand another
night on the glacier,'' Ehret said Wednesday.
   The 1940s-vintage Grumman Widgeon amphibious plane landed about
100 miles northwest of Juneau on Grand Pacific Glacier on Tuesday
afternoon, Ehret said. The plane was not damaged and the men were
waiting inside it.
   The men contacted passing commercial and military jets by radio
late Tuesday and their distress calls were relayed to the Coast
Guard in Juneau, Ehret said.
   Pilot Mike Mills, 38, and passenger Charles ``Buddy'' Ferguson,
31, of Gustavus, were flying from Cordova to Gustavus when they were
forced to land about 45 miles from their destination for an unknown
reason, Ehret said.
   Mills' wife, Connie, said both men were professional pilots who
had recently restored the plane.
   The Coast Guard dispatched an H-3 helicopter Wednesday morning to
rescue the men, but the craft ran into a snowstorm and poor
visibility forced it to land at Gustavus, 50 miles northwest of
Juneau.
   Later attempts by two helicopters to reach the glacier were also
unsuccessful, Ehret said.
   ``They were making good headway and then they got up to that
Cross Sound area and the weather got real bad,'' Ehret said.
   A Coast Guard C-130 transport plane made several passes over the
glacier to communicate with the men. The last communication came
late Wednesday as the plane passed over the area on its way back to
Kodiak to refuel, Ehret said.
   Ehret said the cause of the two men's emergency landing probably
was not due to the weather, which was clear in the area Tuesday.

   Prosecutors' sorry attempts to prove their
divorce-fixing conspiracy charges involving Bess Myerson would have
gotten them hauled off ``The Gong Show,'' said a lawyer for the
former Miss America's lover.
   In a summation filled with sarcasm and punctuated by one-liners
that drew laughter from the judge, jurors and spectators, attorney
Jay Goldberg ridiculed the government's case Wednesday, calling many
of its 34 witnesses ``biased, disgruntled, disturbed people.''
   ``Never have so many days, so much time, energy and taxpayers'
money been spent on such trivial pursuits, such diversionary issues,
while bringing to you so little truth to support the government's
case,'' Goldberg told the jury.
   The defense was expected to continue that tack today as closing
arguments resumed in the U.S. District Court trial.
   Miss Myerson, Miss America 1945 and once the city's cultural
affairs commissioner, is accused of trying to influence a judge's
rulings in her lover's divorce by giving a city job to the judge's
daughter.
   Miss Myerson, 64, her lover, Carl ``Andy'' Capasso, 43, and
former state Supreme Court Justice Hortense Gabel, 75, who made
interim rulings in Capasso's bitter divorce, are charged with
conspiracy, fraud and bribe-related charges.
   Mrs. Gabel's lawyer, Michael Feldberg, said in his summation that
the government failed to prove ``beyond a reasonable doubt'' that
any conspiracy existed. ``There is no direct evidence of the secret
agreement at the heart of this case,'' he said.
   The prosecution, which summed up its case Tuesday, claims that
Mrs. Gabel cut Capasso's weekly payments to his estranged wife,
Nancy, by more than half in exchange for the $19,000-a-year city job
Miss Myerson gave to the judge's daughter, Sukhreet Gabel.
   Feldberg, who was to conclude his statement today and be followed
by Miss Myerson's lawyer, said Mrs. Gabel ``acted in the Capasso
case as a judge is supposed to act. She crafted a decision which, in
her mind, was fair and reasonable.''
   The defense maintains that Capasso's payments were cut because
they were too high to begin with and that when child support,
mortgage payments and other expenses were added on, the cut was
minuscule.
   Leading off for the defense, Goldberg, representing Capasso,
ridiculed the government's case, saying prosecution witnesses should
have been hauled off stage in mid-story like contestants on ``The
Gong Show.''
   Making faces, pacing, flailing his hands and jabbing his fingers
in the air, he described Sukhreet Gabel, who testified for the
prosecution, as ``sick and disturbed'' and said the government ``put
her up to taping her own parents.''
   ``There's got to be a level of decency below which even an
advocate will not sink in a quest to make a case,'' he said, adding
that prosecutors ``stooped so low that they scuffed their knuckles
on the pavement.''
   Ms. Gabel, 39, admitted that she has undergone electroshock
treatment for clinical depression and that she took documents from
her mother's home to prosecutors and taped two phone conversations
with her mother.
   Talking about the divorce that spawned the trial, Goldberg
quipped: ``That was a perfect case for Judge Wapner _ for `People's
Court.'''
   Goldberg scoffed at the credibility of Capasso's former
British-born housekeeper, Shirley Harrod, and likened her gossipy
testimony to the public television series ``Upstairs, Downstairs,''
about a wealthy British family and its servants.
   ``How important was it that you learn Bess Myerson didn't want
people to know she was sleeping _ this is the '80s, now _ that she
was sleeping with Andy Capasso?'' Goldberg asked rhetorically.
   He maintained that Capasso's ex-wife had instigated the case
because she was dissatisfied with the divorce settlement.
   ``What a tragedy that we're here because Nancy Capasso has sold
the government a bill of goods that won't hold up,'' said Goldberg.

<HEAD>State Orders Full Environmental Review for Walden Project</HEAD>

   Government is best that governs least, according to
Henry David Thoreau, but a state order for a full environmental
review of a proposed project near his beloved Walden Pond may keep
development of the area at bay.
   ``We are Walden Pond's caretakers,'' said John DeVillars, the
state's newly named secretary of the Environmental Affairs Agency,
which called for the lengthy review on Wednesday.
   ``Our responsibility is to ensure that we take every reasonable
measure to avoid or minimize damage to this historic area. Nothing
short of a full review will fulfill that responsibility,'' DeVillars
said.
   At issue is a proposed Concord Office Park by the developer
Boston Properties, which wants to build a 148,000-square-foot office
building and a 518-car parking area.
   The land is near where Thoreau worked on his masterpiece,
``Walden,'' while living there in solitude beginning in 1845 for two
years in a hut on land owned by Ralph Waldo Emerson. In the book,
Thoreau writes about the importance being close to nature.
   The land later was donated to Middlesex County and eventually to
the state, which maintains the heavily used recreation area around
the pond.
   Some preservation groups have urged the state to buy the land and
add it to the Walden State Reservation surrounding the pristine,
historic site in Concord. But despite passage of a record $500
million bond for land purchases, state officials say they cannot
afford to buy it.
   Edward Linde, president of Boston Properties, said the state's
``11th-hour'' decision had no basis in law or logic.
   ``The record proves that Boston Properties has complied fully
with every applicable state and local environmental and zoning law
and regulation,'' Linde said. ``We will review the state's request
carefully.''
   The site proposed for the development was cleared 25 years ago
and is now zoned for commercial development by Concord, whose
officials are eager to add the development to the town's tax base.
   In August, Boston Properties voluntarily agreed to an initial
evaluation of the project under the Massachusetts Environmental
Policy Act (MEPA). After the company filed a report, the state
decided to order a full MEPA review _ an often lengthy and expensive
process _ based on the developer's information, staff analysis and
public comment.
   The key issue cited by the state in ordering the review was
concern over traffic surrounding the area.
   Walden Pond is a 62-acre body of water in a 333-acre state-owned
reservation on the edge of Concord, an affluent town of 12,500 about
20 miles northwest of Boston.

   ARAFAT STATEMENT _ At a Geneva news conference, PLO Chairman
Yasser Arafat says his organization renounces terrorism.
   ``I repeat for the record that we totally and absolutely renounce
all forms of terrorism, including individual terrorism, group and
the state terrorism,'' Arafat says. He also reiterates statements
made the previous day in an address to the United Nations General
Assembly accepting the right of all parties in the Middle East,
including Israel, to exist in peace and security and accepting U.N.
resolutions 242 and 338, which recognize the right of all Middle
East nations to safe and secure borders.

<TEXT>
   U.S. AGREES TO TALKS _ President Ronald Reagan says Arafat's
statement fulfills long-standing U.S. conditions and authorizes the
State Department to ``enter into a substantive dialogue with PLO
representatives.''
   Secretary of State George Shultz designates the American
ambassador in Tunisia, Robert H. Pelletreau Jr., as ``the only
authorized channel'' for dialogue with the PLO. Shultz also says the
United States was not recognizing the Palestinian state declared by
the PLO last month, and he reiterates an ``unflinching'' American
commitment to Israel's security.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   ISRAELI REACTION _ Most leading officials express shock and
dismay at the decision.
   Avi Pazner, spokesman for Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, says,
``We believe that the United States will realize very soon what the
true policies of the PLO are and will then realize that its latest
step has not furthered the cause of peace in the Middle East.''
   Israel's ambassador to Washington, Moshe Arad, says his
government regrets the U.S. move and doesn't recognize the PLO as a
``viable partner for negotiations.'' An embassy statement says
Israel will continue to seek ``direct negotiations with Palestinian
Arabs and with Jordan.''
   Foreign Minister Shimon Peres calls the U.S. decision a ``sad day
for all of us'' but adds, ``We can't turn our heads away or put our
heads in the sand and say nothing happened.'' He also warns Shamir
indirectly that his Labor party would not join Shamir's Likud bloc
in a coalition government if that government fails to actively
pursue peace.

   AMERICAN REACTION _ Major U.S. Jewish groups warily support the
Reagan administration's historic decision to sit down with the
Palestine Liberation Organization, while Arab-Americans say the
policy reversal rekindled hope for Middle East peace.
   ``We understand that the United States, having set standards for
speaking with the PLO and the PLO having met those minimum
standards, that it is appropriate for us to live up to its
commitment,'' says Abraham H. Foxman, national director of the
Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith in New York.
   James Zogby, executive director of the Arab-American Institute in
Washington, says the decision was an ``important step forward'' and
expresses hope that ``the dialogue is productive and that peace is
now possible.''
   Congressional leaders from both parties endorse the move
cautiously. ``It may be a blind alley, but an alley worth treading
with eyes open,'' says Sen. Richard Lugar, R-Ind.

   The following is a summary of recent statements by Yasser Arafat,
chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organization:
   _In Algiers, Algeria, on Nov. 15, the Palestine National Council,
the PLO's parliament, declared a Palestinian state with Jerusalem as
its capital.
   ``The state of Palestine herewith declares that it believes in
the settlement of regional and international disputes by peaceful
means, in accordance with the U.N. Charter and resolutions,'' Arafat
said in reading the declaration. The council endorsed key U.N.
resolutions that implicitly call for recognition of Israel's right
to exist.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   _In Stockholm on Dec. 7, Arafat said he told a group of U.S. Jews
that his group accepted Israel's right to exist and condemned all
forms of terrorism.
   A written statement issued after the meeting said the PNC
``accepted the existence of Israel as a state in the region'' and
that the council ``declared its rejection and condemnation of
terrorism in all its forms, including state terrorism,'' an apparent
reference to Israeli actions in the occupied West Bank and Gaza
Strip.
   At a news conference after the meeting, Arafat said: ``The PNC
accepted two states _ a Palestinian state and a Jewish state, in
practice Israel. Is that clear?''
   But on terrorism, he seemed less straightforward than the
statement he endorsed.
   He said he remained committed to his 1985 Cairo declaration,
which called for ending terrorism outside Israel and the occupied
territories but not inside.
   Referring to the Palestinian rebellion against Israel's
occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip, he added: ``The uprising
will continue week after week until the end of the Israeli
occupation of our homeland.''
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   _In a speech before a special session of the U.N. General
Assembly on Tuesday, Arafat said:
   ``I, as chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organization, hereby
once more declare that I condemn terrorism in all its forms, and at
the same time salute those sitting before me in this hall who, in
the days when they fought to free their countries from the yoke of
colonialism, were accused of terrorism by their oppressors, and who
today are the faithful leaders of their peoples, stalwart champions
of the values of justice and freedom. ...
   ``The PLO will seek a comprehensive settlement among the parties
concerned in the Arab-Israeli conflict, including the state of
Palestine, Israel and other neighbors, within the framework of the
international conference for peace in the Middle East on the basis
of Resolutions 242 and 338 and so as to guarantee equality and the
balance of interests, especially our people's rights in freedom,
national independence, and respect the right to exist in peace and
security for all.''
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   _At a news conference in Geneva on Wednesday, Arafat said:
   ``Our desire for peace is a strategy and not an interim tactic.
We are bent to peace come what may. Our statehood provides salvation
to the Palestinians and peace to both Palestinians and Israelis.
Self-determination means survival for the Palestinians. And our
survival does not destroy the survival of the Israelis as their
rulers claim. ...
   ``As for terrorism,'' he said, ``I renounced it yesterday in no
uncertain terms and yet I repeat for the record that we totally and
absolutely renounce all forms of terrorism, including individual,
group and state terrorism. Between Geneva and Algiers we have made
our position crystal clear.''

   A discarded letter that aroused a maid's
suspicions led to the arrest of a fugitive from Oregon whose case
was featured last month on the television program ``Unsolved
Mysteries,'' authorities said.
   Steven Cox, wanted for allegedly bilking investors of up to $3.5
million in 1984, was arrested Wednesday by National Park Service
rangers after they were tipped by the maid, who had cleaned Cox's
motel room at Lake Mead, said chief ranger Newton Sikes.
   ``She found a discarded piece of paper, apparently a letter he
had written to someone and then thrown away, while cleaning the
room,'' Sikes said. ``She noticed it had a phrase in it saying, `The
Unsolved Mysteries program was a bombshell.'''
   Sikes said the maid notified rangers, who went to the room at the
Lake Mead Lodge and found the man gone. They went into nearby
Boulder City and spotted his car at a restaurant, where he was
apparently having breakfast, Sikes said.
   When Cox left, rangers followed and pulled his car over on a road
that leads around the lake. He was arrested and turned over to the
FBI in Las Vegas.
   Sikes said he didn't know if the maid, whom he didn't identify,
had watched the NBC-TV program.
   ``I'm impressed that she did something,'' he said. ``A lot of
people wouldn't have picked up on that.''
   Cox, 38, disappeared from Medford, Ore., in 1984 with the
contents of the safe of his S.D. Cox Investments Inc.
   Hundreds of investors claimed they lost a total of $3.5 million
through Cox, who offered eight to 24 percent returns on real estate
and accounts receivable, authorities said. A 1984 prospectus listed
assets of $2.8 million.
   Disappearing along with Cox was his former wife, Deborah Cox, and
partner, Bud Richmond, authorities said. Richmond later served
prison time for his part and Ms. Cox returned to Medford, but was
never charged, authorities said.
   After the TV show was broadcast Nov. 30, FBI agents tracked Cox
to Boise, Idaho, where he was living as Robert Bradley Davis, a coin
and baseball card dealer.
   FBI spokesman Tom Nicodemus said his agency had lost sight of Cox
three years ago before finding him again in Boise.
   ``We had earlier traced him to Hawaii and then to Palm Springs,''
said Nicodemus. ``Then, we kind of lost him and he was out of pocket
solid for three years.''
   Friends in Boise said Cox drove into town three years ago in an
old car with a few boxes of jewelry for sale. He went to work at the
Treasure Cove Coin Shop, and recently opened his own baseball card
store next door.
   He had married in Boise and the morning before the TV show aired,
told his wife that he had to fly to Hawaii due to a death in the
famil, authorities saidy. He later called and said some people were
after him about some money and he would never be able to come back,
authorities said.
   Nicodemus said Cox, charged in Oregon with sale of unregistered
securities, will most likely be returned to Oregon.

   The Yugoslav consul general here, indicted for
allegedly laundering $1.5 million, gave diplomatic cover to two men
involved in smuggling documents and computer information to
Yugoslavia, officials said.
   An affidavit by Louise Hodess, a U.S. Customs Service agent,
alleges that Bahrudin Bijedic, Chicago consul general, provided
cover for the men, both of whom are American citizens, the Chicago
Tribune reported today.
   According to the affidavit, one of the men, Yugoslav-born
Vjekoslov Spanjol, of Plano, Texas, was ``the second in command of
Yugoslavian Intelligence in the United States.''
   The other man was identified as Hubert F. Cole of Carrollton,
Texas.
   Bijedic, Spanjol, Cole and two other men were indicted Dec. 1 by
a federal grand jury in Philadelphia on charges they engaged in the
money-laundering scheme.
   Spanjol and Cole were able to get documents and computer
information from Department of Defense contractors in the
Dallas-Fort Worth area and smuggle the data to Belgrade via
diplomatic pouch, the newspaper said.
   Ms. Hodess' affidavit said all of the defense contractors
involved had contracts with an office-cleaning service operated by
Spanjol out of Richardson, Texas. It alleged that Spanjol's
employees obtained discarded documents and other information from
the contractors' trash.
   Federal law prohibits the delivery of information relating to the
national defense to any foreign government.
   The affidavit was filed as part of an ongoing investigation of
Bijedic and the others, the newspaper said.
   Earlier this month, Bijedic, Cole, Spanjol and two other men were
charged with funneling $1.5 million to bank accounts controlled by
an undercover U.S. Customs agent. LBS Bank of New York Inc., the
U.S. branch of a Yugoslavian bank, also was indicted.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney William Cook, at the request of the U.S.
attorney's office in Philadelphia, asked Wednesday that a seal on
the affidavit be lifted. U.S. Magistrate Elaine Bucklo granted the
motion, allowing the case file to be open to the public.
   Cook declined to comment on the contents of the affidavit.
   The affidavit disclosed that Cole held several meetings with an
undercover U.S. Customs agent, which were secretly tape-recorded,
and stated that he and Spanjol already were involved with laundering
money in Yugoslavia for a drug dealer in San Antonio.
   Before being conferred diplomatic cover by Bijedic, Cole said he
and Spanjol concealed the currency in their luggage, the affidavit
states.

<TEXT>
   The U.S. decision to talk to the PLO is a
major political triumph for Yasser Arafat that could breathe new
life into the comatose Middle East peace process _ or touch off a
violent backlash by Palestinian radicals.
   There is also the possibility that factions outside the PLO such
as the one led by terrorist mastermind Abu Nidal may simply unleash
a new wave of terror to wreck the PLO chairman's diplomatic
initiative.
   If the breakthrough fails to produce solid political gains,
particularly U.S. pressure on Israel to negotiate, it could trigger
attacks by radicals within the PLO who fear Arafat has made too many
concessions in the Palestinians' 40-year-old struggle for a homeland.
   The Marxist Popular Front for Liberation of Palestine, which
reconciled with Arafat last year after a four-year split, has
already accused him of ``capitulation'' by renouncing terrorism and
recognizing Israel's right to exist.
   Col. Saeed Mousa, who leads the Syrian-based breakaway
Fatah-Uprising faction, on Wednesday branded Arafat ``a traitor ...
for his surrenderist concessions to the United States and the
Israeli enemy.''
   Mousa, known by his nom de guerre of Abu Mousa, split from the
PLO in 1983 with other dissident factions in a Syrian-backed mutiny
launched to protest Arafat's moves toward moderation.
   After fierce fighting, Arafat and his loyalists, already forced
out of Beirut and south Lebanon by Israel's 1982 invasion, were
driven out of their last Lebanese stronghold.
   Capt. Ahmed Jibril, commander of the extremist Syrian-backed
Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General Command,
declared angrily in Damascus Wednesday night: ``Arafat has
recognized and offered four-fifths of the Palestinian land to
Israel.''
   The PLO leadership has accepted that Israel is there to stay and
seeks a Palestinian homeland only in the occupied West Bank and Gaza
Strip, abandoning the dream of regaining all of pre-1948 Palestine.
   ``By renouncing violence and terrorism, Arafat is condemning
anyone who uses the gun against the Israeli occupier,'' Jibril said.
``Arafat has offered Israel what he doesn't have. The land of
Palestine is not the property of any organization or any
individual.''
   West German authorities six weeks ago arrested 13 suspected
PFLP-GC members who they said were planning terrorist attacks. They
also seized explosives.
   Arafat and his top lieutenants would be targets along with
Israelis and American if the radicals go on the warpath again.
   For 15 years, since he first showed signs of moderation, Arafat
has had to battle not only the Israelis, but Palestinian extremists
and hard-line Arab states led by Syria, whose President Hafez Assad
has long sought to wrestle control of the Palestinian cause from
Arafat.
   Gunmen led by the renegade Abu Nidal, wanted by a dozen
countries, have assassinated a score of key Arafat aides over the
years in a campaign to silence the moderates.
   Others have been killed by Israel's secret service, Mossad. The
Israelis' latest victim was Arafat's right-hand man, Khalil
al-Wazir, who was slain in Tunis on April 16.
   The Reagan administration agreed Wednesday to open direct talks
with Arafat after he told a special U.N. General Assembly session in
Geneva that the PLO renounces ``all forms of terrorism'' and said it
explicitly recognizes Israel's right to exist.
   That was an abrupt turnaround by Washington, which only the day
before had said Arafat had not gone far enough to meet U.S.
conditions for a dialogue.
   Last month, Arafat steered the Palestine National Council, the
PLO's parliament-in-exile and highest decision-making body, to
implicitly recognize Israel's right to exist by accepting U.N.
Security Council Resolutions 242 and 338. It also declared an
independent Palestinian state in the West Bank and Gaza, where
Palestinians have been in revolt for a year.
   Radical PLO factions disagreed with Arafat's moderate strategy,
which was primarily aimed at persuading the Americans to deal
directly with the PLO and put pressure on Israel to negotiate.
   George Habash's Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine,
the prime mover behind the wave of airliner hijackings of the 1960s
and 1970s, and the Marxist Democratic Front for the Liberation of
Palestine nonethless reluctantly went along with the PNC declaration
``in the interest of unity.''
   But Habash warned Arafat last month: ``We're backing your efforts
because this is what the majority wants. But we don't believe
moderation will pay.
   ``We can't wait forever. If you fail, you have to come back to
this council to say so and we can then decide the future course.''

<HEAD>Study Finds Few Women Reach Top of Medical School Faculties</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DANIEL Q. HANEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Medical schools have done a good job of recruiting
women to their faculties but still rarely promote them to be deans,
department heads and tenured professors, a study published today
concludes.
   The report found that even though their numbers have grown
dramatically, women still hold only a small share of the best jobs
at medical schools. A decade ago, 8 percent of women faculty were
full professors. Now 9 percent are. By comparison, 32 percent of men
faculty are professors.
   This means there are few women role models for young doctors.
   ``Indeed,'' the report in the New England Journal of Medicine
concludes, ``there are few departments in any school in which a
student can readily find a woman physician in a senior position who
is happy with both her professional life and available to give the
student pointers and support.''
   However, just why women doctors don't make it to the top is still
unclear.
   ``We don't know if the women are choosing not to be on the tenure
track or whether it's a whole series of smaller decisions that are
made for them because there isn't a flexible schedule for taking
care of small children,'' said Janet Bickel, who directed the study
and is head of women's programs at the Association of American
Medical Colleges in Washington.
   Among the findings:
   _Even though women make up 19 percent of medical school
faculties, they hold 7 percent of the full professorships.
   _During the past 10 years, the number of women on medical school
faculties has grown from 6,249 to 10,840.
   _Two of the nation's 127 medical schools are headed by women,
compared with none a decade ago. The number of medical school
departments led by women has increased from 56 to 70.
   _One-third of medical school students are female, up from
one-quarter 10 years ago.
   The work is a followup to a study co-authored seven years ago by
Dr. Marilyn Heins of the University of Arizona College of Medicine.
   ``The numbers look better,'' Heins said. ``There are more women
students and residents. But in terms of women in top positions,
really nothing much has changed.''
   In an interview, Bickel said she doubts that women fail to reach
the top in academic medicine because of frank discrimination.
   ``Something tells me people would have found their way to my
telephone if there was outright discrimination based on gender,''
she said. ``I think we have gotten to the point in the faculty
review process where people seriously try to be fair.''
   Typically, junior faculty members are given seven or eight years
to earn tenure. If they fail to get it, they leave or take
non-tenure track jobs. But they rarely are given a second chance to
earn tenure, which is a crucial step toward high-level positions in
medical schools.
   Whether or not young doctors get tenure rests largely on how many
research papers they have published. Bickel said other studies have
shown that women faculty members do less research than men.
   Bickel said it's possible that a woman doctor with small children
``gives up her research interests because she is already working 60
hours a week teaching and taking care of patients. The research and
publishing that are necessary to present oneself for tenure are
lost.''
   She said medical schools could make tenure easier for women by
providing more flexible schedules, parenting leaves and
opportunities to work toward tenure later in their careers.

<HEAD>Study: AZT Reverses Mental Impairment of AIDS</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The AIDS drug AZT can improve memory and attention
and ease other mental problems that are frequent symptoms of AIDS, a
study published today shows.
   HIV, the AIDS virus, attacks the brain as well as the body's
immune system. Mental lapses can be the first signs of the disease.
   The latest study, published in the New England Journal of
Medicine, confirms earlier reports showing that AZT can relieve
these mental symptoms, at least in their first stages.
   The drug, also known as zidovudine and Retrovir, is the only
medicine approved for AIDS treatment. While it does not cure AIDS,
AZT relieves victims' physical symptoms and prolongs their lives.
   The latest work, directed by Dr. Frederick A. Schmitt of the
University of Kentucky Medical Center, was part of a larger study of
the drug's overall safety and effectiveness.
   Of 262 patients who participated, nearly half were found to have
some neurologic impairment when the study started. Sixty of these
people were randomly chosen to take AZT, while 69 got placebos.
   Two months after treatment started, those who got AZT scored
significantly better on tests of attention, memory, motor skills and
general mental speed.
   People with full-blown AIDS improved more than those who had the
pre-AIDS disease called AIDS-related complex, or ARC.
   ``These data are also important because they show that the
neurologic dysfunction caused by HIV infection may be reversible to
some extent,'' the researchers wrote.

<HEAD>Rodent Tests Poor Way to Evaluate Chemicals for Cancer Risk, Study
Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lengthy testing in rats and mice to predict
whether a chemical poses a cancer hazard in humans usually fails to
provide enough information to justify its cost, researchers asserted
today.
   Most chemicals should be classified instead on the basis of
short-term lab tests, says a cost-benefit analysis in the British
journal Nature.
   Concerns over rodent testing have been raised before, centering
on the uncertainty over how relevant they are for predicting how a
chemical will affect people.
   The researchers said 30 percent of chemicals tested for
cancer-causing potential in one program behaved differently in rats
than in mice. Rodent tests are probably no more predictive for
humans and could be much less, since people are more biologically
different from rodents than rats are from mice, researchers said.
   Before deciding on whether to use a long-term rodent test,
regulators should consider results of short-term testing and the
costs to society of misclassifying a chemical, researchers said. For
most chemicals, proceeding to the rodent tests would not be worth
the cost, they said.
   Social costs of misclassifying a chemical include additional
cancers if a dangerous chemical is wrongly labeled safe. If a safe
chemical is erroneously labeled cancer-causing, society loses access
to a potentially valuable compound or pays for needless precautions.
   The researchers are from Carnegie-Mellon University in
Pittsburgh, Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland and the
University of Washington in Seattle.

<TEXT>
   An unemployed truck driver is accused
of raping two women in separate assaults along the same densely
wooded stretch of highway where the bodies of six women have been
discovered since July, officials said.
   Neil Anderson, 35, of New Bedford, pleaded innocent Wednesday to
charges he abducted and raped a woman at knifepoint in August 1987.
He was held at the Bristol County jail on $20,000 bond.
   Afterward, a second woman who identified Anderson in a composite
photograph accused him of raping her in July, said Bristol County
District Attorney Ronald A. Pina.
   ``The two rape cases have come out as a legitimate result of this
investigation'' into the highway serial killings, said Pina,
although he declined to confirm news reports that Anderson is a
suspect in the slayings.
   ``There's a good list of suspects we have. They're all being
checked out,'' Pina said at a news conference Wednesday. ``I think
we are definitely closing in. The circle is becoming smaller and
smaller.''
   The partially clad skeletons of six women have been found since
July in a six- to eight-mile radius along Interstate 195 and Route
140 in Dartmouth and Freetown.
   Thomas Gibney, a spokesman for Pina, declined to say whether
Anderson, a divorced father of two who lives with his mother and
grandmother, had been among those questioned in the slayings.
   Pina has said he believes the six killings were likely the
victims of the same killer or killers and that the victims all had
ties to New Bedford's Weld Square neighborhood, known for
prostitution and drugs.
   Douglas Ubelaker, a forensic pathologist with the Smithsonian
Institution called in to examine the victims' remains, said all six
women apparently died in a similar manner, but he declined to detail
his findings.
   Anderson, who has also worked as a welder and lives about 10
blocks from the Weld Square area, was arrested at home Tuesday. He
was charged with aggravated rape, kidnapping, and assault and
battery with a dangerous weapon.
   James M. Quinn, the public defender representing Anderson, said
his client ``has been charged with only one crime. I think that to
try to link that to any other events is very unfair.''
   Gibney said an arraignment on the second rape charge would not be
held unless Anderson posted bail. ``At that time we would slap the
other warrant on him, but barring that he's just going to sit there
(in jail) until he goes before the grand jury on the other
charges,'' he said.
   Judge John A. Markey scheduled a pretrial hearing on Dec. 21 in
New Bedford District Court. Anderson also will appear at that time
on charges of assault and battery with a deadly weapon in an
unrelated fight, Quinn said.

Torture</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Amnesty International said today that torture cases
in the Philippines have increased as the government has escalated
its fight against communist insurgents.
   ``Military intelligence agents are reported to have subjected
detainees to severe beatings, electric shocks, stabbings, near
suffocation with plastic bags or water, and sexual abuse,'' said the
report by the London-based group.
   ``Similar abuses in police stations have been reported. Soldiers
on patrol have been accused of rape and other abuses in villages
suspected of sympathizing with rebel forces,'' it said.
   This ``pattern of torture'' has re-emerged even though President
Corazon Aquino's government enacted constitutional and legal
measures to outlaw brutality, Amnesty International said in the
report.
   ``Amnesty International believes that immediate action is still
needed to enforce legal safeguards against incommunicado detention,
to investigate fully all allegations of torture, and to bring those
responsible to justice,'' the report said.
   In Manila, Mrs. Aquino said today, ``I am in touch with the
progress of these cases. The final reports are not yet in as not all
witnesses have been heard.'' She urged human rights organizations to
submit reports of violations to a new committee she created this
week to investigate alleged abuses.
   Last Saturday, Mrs. Aquino acknowledged violations were
continuing but blamed most of them on the communist rebel New
People's Army. She said human rights abuse was not a policy of her
administration and that it was unfair to blame the problem
exclusively on the military.
   ``They have to give us a chance,'' said Mary Concepcion Bautista,
chairwoman of the Commission on Human Rights in Manila. ``We have to
investigate. We cannot be Amnesty International, which just
publishes reports. ... They are being unfair.''
   Amnesty said it knew of no instance of a military or police
officer being convicted of a serious human rights offense since Mrs.
Aquino came to power in February 1986 in the military-civilian
uprising that ousted President Ferdinand Marcos.
   Alleged members of the banned Communist Party of the Philippines
and its military wing, the New People's Army, are among those who
have said they were tortured, the report said.
   Amnesty said it is aware the rebel army has killed captives. It
said it ``condemns such abuses by opposition groups, but stresses
they can never justify human rights violations by government
forces.''
   The organization, which won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1977, said
it had received no official response from the Philippines to its
March report detailing allegations of murder by military and
paramilitary forces and instances of ``disappearances.''
   The organization did note that Mrs. Aquino has dissolved the
National Intelligence and Security Agency, Marcos' intelligence
agency, which was accused of torture.
   The Philippines' Commission on Human Rights issued guides on the
rights of prisoners in May, the report said, and those guides were
affirmed by leaders of the military and the national police force.
   ``Several consistent and apparently reliable reports of torture
show that extensive legal safeguards against incommunicado
detention, ill-treatment and torture are being ignored,'' today's
Amnesty report said.
   The report detailed allegations by 28 people, including Randolfo
Corteza, 30, an alleged Communist Party leader arrested in February,
who said he was beaten and given electric shocks to his genitals.
   He was released on bail in August.
   Elisa Lubi, 45, an alleged party finance officer, claimed she was
sexually molested while being questioned in June at the Philippine
Constabulary's Capital Region Command in Bicutan.

<HEAD>British Commander At Ill-Fated Battle Of Arnhem Dead At 87</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Maj. Gen. Robert Urquhart, the British commander at
the heroic but ill-fated Battle of Arnhem who tried to capture a
bridge over the Rhine River, has died, his family reported today. He
was 87.
   Urquhart died Tuesday at his home at Port of Menteith, near
Stirling in his native Scotland. No cause of death was stated.
   As commander of the First Airborne Division, Urquhart was at the
forefront of the battle in September 1944 to capture a bridge over
the Rhine at Arnhem, the Netherlands.
   He survived many narrow escapes, and was portrayed by Sean
Connery in the 1977 movie ``A Bridge Too Far,'' which was based on
the battle.
   The battle was the climax of a U.S.-British operation to exploit
German disorganization following their retreat from Normandy,
France, after the Allied invasion of Nazi-occupied Europe in the
D-Day landings three months earlier.
   The plan aimed at ending the war in Europe before the end of
1944, thereby avoiding the Allies' long, conventional offensive with
which the war eventually ended in 1945.
   The plan was to capture five river and canal bridges in the
Netherlands to open a way for an armored advance into the north
German plain before the onset of winter.
   It required the American 101st and 82nd Airborne Divisions to
capture bridges at Eindhoven and Nijmegen and the British First
Airborne Division to capture the one at Arnhem.
   Simultaneously with the parachute and glider landings, a ground
advance of 64 miles was planned by the British 30th Corps from the
Meuse-Escaut Canal along the same axis.
   The American operations succeeded. But the British, whose air
drops had to be staggered because of lack of sufficient aircraft,
encountered German forces and were able only to capture the north
end of the Arnhem bridge.
   The Germans, who had found plans of the entire operation on the
body of an American soldier shot down in a glider, heavily
out-gunned Urquhart's 10,000 troops.
   Bad weather and German assaults on the 30th Corps' advancing
armored column, meanwhile, denied relief for Urquhart's troops and
their airhead was steadily reduced.
   Urquhart and his men fought with heroic courage for nine days.
But with their ammunition and food virtually at an end, their
casualties rising rapidly and no hope of relief reaching them in
time, Urquhart ordered a break-out.
   There was no British surrender. A total of 2,163 of the 10,000
troops who landed at Arnhem fought their way to safety in the
American area, which the 30th Corps had consolidated. Another 1,350
were killed in the battle. The rest were taken prisoner.
   The failure to capture the Arnhem bridge was reported as ``a
bridge too short'' to bring victory.
   Urquhart narrowly escaped death when a German shell destroyed a
jeep he was about to use. On another occasion while he was in a
house, a German soldier appeared at a window. Before the German
could fire, Urquhart shot him dead.
   Later, while making a personal reconnaissance, Urquhart was cut
off from his own headquarters. He made his way back through enemy
fire so dense that at one stage he was given up for dead.
   A total of five Victoria Crosses, Britain's highest decoration
for bravery, were awarded after the battle among Urquhart's men.
   After the war, Urquhart became director general of the
Territorial Army, the British Army's part-time reserve, during its
reconstruction. He was later appointed commander of British forces
in British-ruled Malaya, which later became part of Malaysia, and
from 1952 until his retirement in 1955 was the commander of British
troops in Austria.
   He is survived by a wife, three daughters and a son. Their names
were not immediately available.

   Lt. Gen. Mikhail Moiseyev, commander of Soviet
forces in the Far East, has been named the Red Army's new chief of
staff, the official army newspaper Red Star reported today.
   Moiseyev succeeds Marshal Sergei F. Akhromeyev whose retirement
was announced Dec. 7 by Soviet officials in New York the same day
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev announced unilateral cuts in Soviet
conventional forces in a speech to the U.N. General Assembly.
   The brief announcement of Moiseyev's appointment, which showed
the commander in a uniform covered with medals, was published on the
front page of Red Star along with the first public reference to
Akhromeyev's retirement.
   ``Moiseyev succeeds Marshal Sergei Akhromeyev who has been
relieved of these duties in connection with his transfer to another
job.'' the newspaper said. It did not elaborate.
   Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady I. Gerasimov said in New York
last week that Akhromeyev was stepping down for unspecified health
reasons but would stay on as an advisor to Gorbachev.
   Akhromeyev had been on record as opposing unilateral Soviet troop
cuts.
   Moiseyev, who will also serve as first deputy minister of
defense, had commanded the forces of the Far Eastern Military
District since January 1987, Red Star said.
   Born into a working class family in 1939, Moiseyev joined the
Soviet army in 1958 and was graduated from the Frunze Military
Academy and the military academy of the armed forces' general staff.

   A 2{-year-old girl was taken to a hospital
suffering from hallucinations and seizures apparently caused by a
cocaine overdose, authorities said today.
   The child was taken to Cedars-Sinai Medical Center shortly after
9 p.m. Wednesday, said police Sgt. K. Davis.
   A urinalysis revealed the child had ingested cocaine, said
hospital spokeswoman Paula Correia. The toddler was listed in fair
condition in the medical center's pediatric intensive-care unit, Ms.
Correia said.
   Police and officials from the Department of Children's Services
were investigating, Davis said.
   ``The parents are saying they don't know how it all happened,''
he said. ``The mother said she dropped off the girl at her sister's,
who then dropped off the girl at a day care center.''
   The parents, who weren't identified, told police they noticed the
child acting strangely when they picked her up from the center,
Davis said.
   Sgt. Craig Crosby said the child was picked up by an ambulance at
a day care center after a caller reported the child was having a
seizure.
   He said he did not know the name of the day care center, which is
located in south-central Los Angeles, an area notorious for gangs
and drug dealing. The child's family also lives in the area.

<HEAD>Young Troublemaker Receives Harsh Sentence For Stolen Lottery
Tickets</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Eric Pezzuti was dreaming of riches
when he tried to redeem 47 stolen state lottery tickets last June.
He found out the tickets were worth 15 years in prison.
   In tears, the 18-year-old high school dropout with 32 juvenile
convictions was led from court after Palm Beach County Circuit Judge
Thomas Sholts balked at pleas for leniency and imposed the harshest
sentence possible.
   ``He's graduated to the major leagues,'' Sholts said.
   Pezzuti, scheduled for a February trial on other charges of
dealing in stolen goods, was convicted last month of trying to
receive a free ticket for each of the tickets stolen from a Juno
Beach beauty salon.
   Pezzuti's father, Jim Pezzuti, said his son planned to appeal the
sentence.
   ``It's sort of obvious the state attorneys are out to get him,''
he said. ``He's not really a hardened criminal.''
   Assistant State Attorney Jacqui Charbonneau recommended the
sentence based on Pezzuti's prior juvenile record.
   The elder Pezzuti said his son has been in jail since his
conviction, and ``that probably did more to straighten him up than
anything he did in the juvenile system.''
   Pezzuti went through the juvenile system without being punished
much for his crimes, mostly burglaries and automobile thefts, say
family members.
   ``He thought, `I'm never going to get in trouble. They're just
playing with me,''' said his sister, Debbie.

   Four businessman face up to 17 years in prison
if convicted on charges they tried to illegally aid Sen. Alan
Cranston's campaign by funneling money to an opponent of his chief
rival.
   The five-count federal indictment handed up Wednesday contends
that $120,000 was used for an advertising campaign in support of
American Independent Party candidate Ed Vallen, who ran against
Cranston, D-Calif., and Republican Rep. Ed Zschau in 1986.
   ``We were not involved in any way, even indirectly,'' Cranston
spokesman Murray Flanders said in a telephone interview from
Washington.
   According to acting U.S. Attorney Gary Feess, the defendants
solicited some 55 contributors to write checks to Green Stripe
Media, which produced a TV ad for Vallen.
   Feess told a news conference that the people who wrote checks
were reimbursed for amounts running from $1,000 to $4,000. He
declined to say whether the check writers knew they were violating
election laws.
   ``The individuals were told different things by different
people,'' Feess said.
   Feess stressed that Cranston knew nothing about the plan and had
no role in approving it. There was also no evidence that anyone on
Cranston's staff was involved.
   ``We have absolutely no evidence that Senator Cranston knew or
approved of this action,'' he said, adding there is no indication
that it had any influence on the outcome of the election. Cranston
narrowly defeated Zschau.
   Feess indicated that Michael R. Goland, 41, of Beverly Hills was
the moving force in the alleged scheme.
   Goland was charged with conspiring with Sandore Habalow, 45, of
Los Angeles and Lyle R. Weisman, 31, of Beverly Hills. Michael B.
Altman, 42, of Los Angeles was charged with aiding and abetting the
alleged contributions by acting as a conduit through which funds
were passed to the media company.
   If convicted, Goland could get up to 17 years in prison and fines
totaling $1 million. Weisman and Habalow each face up to 16 years
and $875,000 in fines if convicted; Altman could get a year and be
fined $125,000.
   According to the Federal Election Commission, Goland poured more
than $1 million into a campaign against former Sen. Charles Percy,
R-Ill., in 1984. Percy, who lost to Democrat Paul Simon, said Goland
wanted him defeated because the businessman didn't think he was
ardent enough in his support of Israel.
   ``Goland has one issue he is rabid on,'' Percy said after his
1984 defeat. ``He thinks I am not enough pro-Israel.''
   During the 1986 campaign, Zschau's credentials on support for
Israel were questioned. Like Percy, Zschau counted himself a
supporter of Israel.

<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   A large band of winter weather scattered snow from Nevada to New
England today, piling up foot-and-a-half accumulations in Upper
Michigan and combining with gusty winds in the mountains of Colorado
and Wyoming.
   Hurricane-force winds wreaked havoc in northern Utah and northern
California late Wednesday and early today.
   Winds felled trees, caused small power outages and blew at least
five trucks off Interstate 15 near Salt Lake City. An observer in
Centerville early today measured gusts of at least 104 mph _ the
maximum his equipment would register.
   Strong winds blew through northern Utah's canyons, with gusts of
82 mph reported at Centerville and Smithville. Numerous
semi-trailers were blown off Interstate 15 near Farmington. A high
wind warning was in effect for the western slopes of the Wasatch
Mountains.
   In northern California, winds toppled trees into homes and parked
cars, blew out windows and knocked out power to more than 100,000
customers of Pacific Gas & Electric Co., company officials said.
Gusts up to 80 mph were recorded at the top of Mount Diablo.
   Colorado received the heaviest snow in the West, with up to 7{
inches recorded near Boulder and 3-6 inches in Colorado Springs.
Gusty winds reduced visibility and hampered travel in the northeast
foothills of the Colorado Rockies, and a winter storm warning was in
effect for the area.
   A winter storm warning also was issued for the southern mountains
of Wyoming. Five inches of snow fell at Lander by late Wednesday and
gusts up to 45 mph occurred at Rock Springs.
   Western Kansas also had blowing snow, and snow advisories were
posted for the northwest Texas Panhandle and east central Nevada.
   Cold arctic winds produced lake-effect snow over the southern
shores of Lake Superior. Eighteen inches fell near Wakefield in
Upper Michigan. Snow and strong winds reduced visibilities in
northwest parts of Lower Michigan.
   Heavy snow warnings remained in effect for parts of Upper
Michigan.
   Light snow also fell in parts of New England and eastern New York
state. Eastern Texas and western Louisiana received light rain.
   Today's forecast called for snow in much of Nevada, the central
and southern Rockies, the western edge of the southern and central
Plains, with the heaviest snow on the eastern slopes of the Colorado
Rockies, Michigan, the lower Great Lakes, the central and northern
Appalachians and northern New England; rain from southeast Texas to
the Gulf Coast and the southern Applachians, with a few
thunderstorms over the central Gulf Coast; and rain along the
Southern California coast.
   Temperatures were expected to remain below zero in northern
Minnesota and northeastern North Dakota. Highs were expected to be
in the single digits and teens from the northern Great Lakes to the
northern Plains and central Rockies; the 20s and 30s in northern New
England, the lower Great Lakes, the Ohio and Mississippi valleys,
northwest Texas, and western Montana; in the 60s and 70s in the
south Atlantic Coast states, the Gulf Coast, and from southern
Arizona to the central and southern coasts of California; and in the
40s and 50s elsewhere.
   At 2 a.m. EST, temperatures ranged from 15 degrees below zero at
Devils Lake, N.D., to 73 degrees at Key West, Fla.
   Other reports:
   _East: Atlanta 49 cloudy; Boston 39 cloudy; Buffalo 39 windy;

   Stuart Symington might have become the nation's
36th president as successor to the slain John F. Kennedy, said a
longtime confidant of the late Missouri senator.
   Symington died Wednesday at his home in New Canaan, Conn. He was
87.
   Symington, who was the nation's first Secretary of the Air Force
and later built a reputation as a principled politician, died of
heart disease, said James Symington, one of his two sons.
   Longtime confidant Clark A. Clifford recalled the 1969 Democratic
convention, and events that could have made Symington vice president.
   ``I was carrying messages back and forth,'' Clifford said from
Washington. ``The day before the (nominating) decision was to be
made, Senator Kennedy said, `I'm now offering the No. 2 position to
Senator Symington. Take it to him, and get back to me.'''
   Clifford recalled that elements of the party pressing for a
Southerner on the ticket eventually persuaded Kennedy to select
Lyndon B. Johnson for the vice presidency.
   ``I took that (message) back to Senator Symington,'' Clifford
said. ``He seemed very relaxed about it. He didn't seem to be
hungering for it (the nomination) anyway.''
   Symington was praised by both Democrats and Republicans.
   ``He exuded integrity,'' said U.S. District Judge William L.
Hungate, who served as a House Democrat from Missouri from 1964 to
1977. ``There was no question of any improprieties. No shadows ever
fell on Stuart Symington.''
   ``He was one of those tall trees whose falling will leave a great
vacant spot'' said former State Treasurer, James Spainhower, a
Democrat.
   Symington made his mark not only as a senator from 1952 to 1976
but as the secretary of the Air Force and, before that, as a
trouble-shooting industrialist summoned to St. Louis from Baltimore
in 1937 to bring strike-plagued Emerson Electric Co. back to
financial prosperity.
   As Air Force secretary, Symington ``set down broad principles and
courses of action, and the decisions he made in those early days had
substantial impact on the manner in which the Air Force later
developed,'' said Clifford, a former Defense secretary.
   Sen. John C. Danforth, R-Mo., ran against Symington in 1970 and
lost, then won the seat after Symington decided not to seek
re-election in 1976.
   Despite the fact they were from different parties, Symington
resigned from office before the term ended so Danforth would have
the most seniority of the new senators elected that year.
   ``To consider that he did this for someone who had run against
him, for someone of the other party, says a lot about this man,
about the bigness of the man and about his concern for our state,''
Danforth said.
   Although he was best known as a champion of military air in his
more than 30 years of public service, Symington's popularity at home
was largely based on his battles for local projects.
   Symington was born in Amherst, Mass., in 1901. He graduated from
Yale University in 1923 and entered business.
   In 1978, Symington married Ann ``Nancy'' Hemingway Watson and
moved to New Caanan, a wealthy Connecticut community just north of
New York City. Symington's first wife, Evelyn Wadsworth Symington,
died in 1972.
   In addition to his son, James, Symington is survived by a second
son, Stuart Symington Jr., six grandchildren and six
great-grandchildren.

   A plainclothes policeman who became the fifth
Dallas officer killed this year may have been shot during an
undercover cocaine transaction ``for the fun of it,'' an
investigator says.
   Lawrence R. Cadena, who left his police desk job three years ago
to work undercover on drug raids, was killed during a shootout that
also left a suspected drug dealer dead and two others wounded,
authorities said.
   Sgt. James Chandler described the department's mood as somber in
what has become the deadliest year ever for the police force. ``Four
was unbelievable,'' he said. ``Five was just _ I don't know. You
don't know what to say.''
   Police said Wednesday that Cadena's killer apparently didn't know
the 17-year veteran was an officer when he delivered bogus drugs to
Cadena. Cadena's assailant threw the fake drugs inside the car in
which the officer was sitting, then shot him at close range with a
semiautomatic rifle Tuesday.
   ``The drug was bunk,'' said narcotics division Capt. Eddie Walt
said. ``Essentially, they killed him for the fun of it.''
   Cadena, 43, was shot in the chest, abdomen and both arms. He was
pronounced dead at Baylor University Medical Center in Dallas about
30 minutes later.
   The drug suspect, Hector Rodriguez Jocimino, 36, of Dallas was
shot in the chest and back by a backup police officer, authorities
said. He died later at Parkland Memorial Hospital, said an emergency
room supervisor.
   Javier Suarez Medina, 20, was in serious condition at Parkland
with wounds to the chest and abdomen, while Fernando Fernandez, 17,
was in serious condition with wounds to both legs, hospital
officials said.
   Police said both Medina and Fernandez have been charged with
capital murder. Fernandez also was charged with unlawful delivery of
a controlled substance.
   Police Chief Mack Vines, who called Cadena a ``model officer,''
said that all of the officers apparently followed the correct
procedure during the undercover operation and that the presence of
additional backup officers probably would not have prevented the
shooting.
   Dallas police have been under fire from some city council members
and community minority leaders, who have accused police of being too
trigger-happy.
   A memorial service was planned for Cadena today at St. Patrick's
Catholic Church in Dallas.

   A high school cheerleader left paralyzed from
the waist down when she fell on a concrete floor while attempting a
difficult stunt will receive $2.1 million from the school district,
a teacher and former principal.
   The settlement involving Angie McAll, 18, was announced
Wednesday. Miss McAll was injured in 1987.
   ``She was a super athlete before she was hurt,'' said her
attorney, Robert Cunningham. ``She would be glad to give the money
back to get back in the condition she was in.''
   The settlement requires the county Board of School Commissioners'
insurance company to pay $100,000, the maximum the school system can
pay in a personal injury case.
   Insurance companies for the teacher supervising the cheerleaders,
Cynthia Stanley, and the former principal at Murphy High School,
Paul Sousa, settled at $1 million apiece.
   Miss McAll was injured when two girls tossed her into the air and
she attempted to land on another cheerleader's shoulders after
performing a back flip, Cunningham said. It was the first time she
had attempted the stunt.
   Miss McAll suffered a broken back and injured her spinal cord.
   The lawsuit alleged that the board allowed cheerleaders to
perform difficult gymnastic maneuvers without protective mats or
spotters to guard against falls. It also claimed cheerleaders did
not receive adequate training or supervision.
   Cunningham said the school system's cheerleader rules did not
mention safety.
   ``They had things about gum chewing, lengths of the cheerleaders'
skirts and gyrating motions,'' he added.
   Robert C. Campbell III, the board's attorney, said Miss McAll
``assumed the risk and and knew the dangers and plus she signed
waiver of liability'' in case of injury.

   Robert H. Pelletreau Jr., the U.S. ambassador to
Tunisia assigned to open talks with the Palestine Liberation
Organization, is one of the most experienced and knowledgable
American diplomats on Arab affairs.
   Colleagues say he enjoys telling about the time he was held
hostage by Palestinian terrorists for several hours in 1970 as a
junior political officer in Amman, Jordan _ and walking away from
his captors.
   ``He loves to recount this story,'' a U.S. diplomat stationed in
Europe told The Associated Press, speaking on condition of
anonymity. ``He was standing there as the press conference was going
on and he just walked away. He bears them no ill-will. It was a
great adventure.''
   Pelletreau, 53, of Patchogue, N.Y., is fluent in Arabic and
French, has served in U.S. embassies in Algeria, Morocco,
Mauritania, Lebanon, Jordan and Syria, and is a former ambassador to
Bahrain.
   He was named Wednesday by Secretary of State George P. Shultz as
the ``only authorized channel'' for what Shultz said would be a
``substantive dialogue'' with PLO representatives.
   The PLO political headquarters is in Tunis, the capital of the
North African Arab nation of Tunisia.
   Pelletreau's office referred calls today to the embassy press
office. Information Officer Adnan Siddiqi said the ambassador made a
brief telephone call to PLO headquarters to make the first contact.
He said he did not know when the first direct meeting would take
place.
   PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat met East German officials in Berlin
today, and it was not known when he planned to return to Tunis.
   Between foreign postings, Pelletreau served in Washington as
director of Arabian peninsula affairs in the State Department and as
deputy assistant secretary of state for Middle East and South Asian
affairs.
   From 1985 until his assignment to Tunis in March 1987, Pelletreau
shifted over to the Pentagon to serve as deputy assistant secretary
of defense for Middle East and South Asian affairs.
   The anecdotal highlight of his career came in September 1970,
when guerrillas of George Habash's Popular Front for the Liberation
of Palestine _ a radical faction of the PLO _ diverted three
airliners to Amman and took the passengers and crews hostage.
   As Pelletreau has told the story to colleagues, he was kidnapped
on the streets of Amman by Popular Front guerrillas and taken with
other hostages to a large news conference at a downtown hotel.
   Noting his captors's attention was diverted, Pelletreau edged in
among the journalists, then slipped out and walked away, the
American diplomat said.
   When his absence was noticed, the guerrillas sent teams out
looking for him _ including one that passed him on the street _ but
he made it to safety in the U.S. Embassy.
   ``Those were in the innocent days,'' the diplomat recalled.
``It's almost hard to remember the days when you just didn't kill
diplomats.''

   The surprise U.S. decision to open talks with
the Palestine Liberation Organization produced shock today in
official Israeli circles and celebrations in Arab neighborhoods.
   A slogan sprayed on a wall in the West Bank city of Ramallah
read: ``The American position is a victory for the uprising and
Palestinian diplomacy.''
   Foreign Minister Shimon Peres said the American turnabout
represented a ``sad day for all of us'' and one firebomb in the
occupied territories would ``put to shame'' Arafat's commitment to
end terrorism.
   But Peres also said Israel should launch a new peace initiative
to counter the PLO's latest diplomatic achievements. He proposed
letting Palestinians in the occupied territories elect alternative
leaders to negotiate peace with Israel.
   ``We are facing a new situation,'' Peres told a news conference.
``I hope Israel will say to the Palestinians: `Stop shooting and go
voting, Give up your bullets and go to your ballots.'''
   The U.S. announcement sparked rejoicing among residents of the
occupied territories.
   ``Thanks to the uprising, the PLO and the United States are now
working together,'' said Hanna Siniora, a PLO supporter and editor
of the Al Fajr newspaper published in Arab east Jerusalem.
   In Ramallah, dozens of Palestinians celebrating the U.S. decision
marched through the streets chanting pro-PLO slogans and carrying
banners reading ``Yes to the PLO'' and ``Yes to the Palestinian
state.''
   ``For the first time, I feel the Americans are starting to listen
to the Palestinian voice, and the voice of peace,'' said a mosque
preacher in the West Bank city of Nablus.
   Siniora and others credited Palestinians' year-long revolt
against Israel's 21-year-occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip
with moderating PLO positions and paving the way for talks with
Washington.
   ``The uprising pressured the Palestinian leadership to take such
positions,'' said Saed Kanaan, a PLO supporter and businessman in
Nablus.
   Israel army radio called the decision a ``historic turning
point.''
   ``Israelis woke up today to a whole new political reality in the
Middle East,'' said army radio correspondent Oz Frankel.
   Avi Pazner, spokesman for Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, said in
a telephone interview, ``We believe that the United States will
realize very soon what the true policies of the PLO are and will
then realize that its latest step has not furthered the cause of
peace in the Middle East.''
   The U.S. move could further divide Israel's two major political
camps and upset sensitive negotiations to bring Peres's Labor Party
and Shamir's Likud bloc together in a unity government.
   One sign of new friction was Peres' renewed an attack on Likud
for thwarting his exploratory contacts with Jordan last year, which
he said would have prevented the PLO initiative. On July 31, King
Hussein of Jordan cut all administrative ties to the West Bank,
allowing the PLO to fill the vacuum.
   In the 1967 Middle East war, Israeli seized the West Bank from
Jordan and Gaza from Egypt.
   Peres also warned Shamir indirectly today that he would not join
a new government that failed to actively pursue peace.
   Likud politicians angrily denounced the U.S. move.
   Benjamin Netanyahu, a former U.N. ambassador and close associate
of Shamir, said, ``The United States has breached its policy (of not
talking to the PLO) and the credibility of the United States has
been compromised.
   ``The American government has been either duped or they are
deceiving themselves. The American government will regret what they
have done once they realize who they are dealing with,'' he said in
a telephone interview.
   The U.S. decision was welcomed, however, by a leading member of
the liberal Citizens Rights Movement, which was allied with the
Labor Party in the Nov. 1 parliament elections.
   ``It's a great victory for American policy,'' said Ran Cohen, a
parliament member of the small party. ``With this new success, we
are at the beginning of the peace process.''

<HEAD>2 Indicted, Suspended in Connection With Tompkins Square Park Riot</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two policemen accused of repeatedly kicking a man
during a riot have been indicted on assault charges, becoming the
first officers charged in the August melee in Tompkins Square Park.
   The indictments announced Wednesday were based largely on a
videotape shot during the Aug. 7 riot by an aspiring filmmaker, said
Manhattan District Attorney Robert Morgenthau. The tape will be
presented at their trial.
   So far, 120 brutality complaints relating to the melee have been
filed with the police Civilian Complaint Review Board. Seven
officers face department trials; this group does not include either
of the indicted officers.
   James Gatto, 26, and John Giglia, 25, were charged with kicking
Robert Arihood, who lives near the park on the city's Lower East
Side, Morgenthau said. The assault charge, a misdemeanor, is
punishable by up to a year in jail.
   Gatto and Giglia pleaded innocent and were released on their own
recognizance. The officers, who joined the force in 1985, were
suspended without pay.
   Their lawyer, Joseph Librie, called the charges ``outrageous''
and said they ``will be vindicated at trial if not before.''
   Arihood, a 42-year-old construction worker, was chased, beaten
and kicked during the confrontation between police and hundreds of
demonstrators protesting a 1 a.m. curfew for the park, the district
attorney said.
   At least 52 officers and 18 civilians required hospital treatment
for injuries suffered in the clash, which focused attention on
police crowd-control tactics and led to the grand jury investigation.
   Morgenthau said seven more officers would be charged in the riot.

   Some foreign rescue teams have given up
hope of finding more survivors in the rubble left by the Armenian
earthquake, and they are heading home, the top U.S. disaster relief
official said today.
   However, Soviet officials said the rescue effort would continue
and denied reports that stricken cities would be bulldozed to
prevent an epidemic.
   Voices and other signs of life in the ruins dropped sharply after
Monday night, when temperatures plummeted to below freezing, said
Julia Taft, director of the U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance office,
at a news briefing in Moscow.
   ``The hope of finding any more (survivors) is ended,'' she said.
   The official news agency Tass reported that rescuers were still
searching. On Wednesday, Soviet Health Minister Yevgeny Chazov vowed
to continue the effort because 60 survivors had been found in the
previous 24 hours.
   Soviet media reported looting of fur coats from the rubble, tents
from relief supplies at the Yerevan airport, and even jewelry from
corpses. Tass said cargo is now being shipped from the airport under
guard.
   Soviet officials say the Dec. 7 quake killed 55,000 people in
northwestern Armenia and left about 500,000 of the area's 700,000
people homeless.
   Tass said Wednesday that 48 villages had been destroyed, in
addition to the city of Spitak. The larger cities of Leninakan and
Kirovakan suffered major damage, and Ms. Taft said another 52
villages also were damaged. Tass reported Wednesday that 21,755
bodies have been counted and identified so far.
   Rescue teams with search dogs from Italy and West Germany told
Jeff Sallot of the Globe and Mail of Toronto that Soviet authorities
had ordered them home, saying they were ready to blast the ruins of
buildings in Spitak and bulldoze the rubble to prevent decomposing
bodies from starting an epidemic.
   The Soviet Embassy in France denied similar reports from French
media on Wednesday, Tass reported.
   Some foreign rescue workers said they planned to keep combing the
crumbled buildings for life, despite fog and rain that was turning
to snow.
   ``We continue to look for people, especially with dogs,'' said
Dr. Georges d'Allemagne of the relief organization Doctors Without
Borders. ``We think there are chances for about another week to find
a few people.''
   However, Ms. Taft said the dogs' sense of smell becomes
overwhelmed with the stench of death after several days, and they
can no longer find survivors.
   Michael Tamillow of Virginia said his team found two survivors
Tuesday but none on Wednesday, Tass reported. ``But the house where
we dug Tuesday also seemed hopeless, so we do not have the right to
leave,'' Tamillow said.
   Snarled supply lines also have hampered the relief effort, and
Pravda quoted Gen. Lt. V.C. Dubinyak today as saying some of the
medicine and other cargo pouring in from around the world was being
stolen from Zvarnots Airport in Yerevan, the Armenian capital.
Authorities have recovered more than $400,000 worth of stolen goods,
he said.
   Sergei Movsisyan, a Yerevan volunteer for the International Red
Cross, said today that 20,000 tents should have been delivered to
Leninakan but no one knows what happened to them.
   Police caught one man with four foreign tents and three boxes of
Bulgarian canned meat stolen from the airport, Tass reported today,
quoting Victor Eren, deputy interior minister of Armenia.
   Tass quoted Eren saying a man from the village of Abobyan was
caught stealing watches, jewelry and medicine from bodies in
Kirovakan.
   The International Red Cross, warning of the worsening weather,
appealed Wednesday for heavy-duty tents, blankets and stoves for at
least 20,000 Armenian families left homeless.
   ``It is freezing at night, and it is much colder in the
villages,'' d'Allemagne said. ``There are very few tents in
villages, and there is no heat.''
   Snowfall and hazardous road conditions in the mountainous region
also have hampered the relief efforts, and the next few days are
expected to bring more snow and strong winds of up to 45 mph.
   Fog delayed the arrival of flights from Moscow, and relief
workers arriving by plane couldn't find enough buses to take them to
their destinations. ``The airport in Yerevan is a total mess,''
d'Allemagne said. ``There are planes and people all over the place,
and nobody can find anybody else.''

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The original ``War of the Worlds'' radio script,
including ultimately failed efforts by CBS censors to tone down the
realism, fetched $143,000 at auction.
   The script, sold at Sotheby's auction house on Wednesday, had sat
in writer Howard Koch's file cabinet for years after the 1938 Orson
Welles production panicked millions of listeners convinced the world
was being invaded by Mars.
   ``I had a private offer of $60,000. They advised me to take the
gamble. I guess it was the right gamble,'' Koch said in a telephone
interview from California. Koch adapted the script from H.G. Wells'
book for the Mercury Theater.
   The 46-page script contains Welles' handwritten changes as well
as deletions and alterations by the censors. Welles made numerous
changes before air time to smooth the transitions between the music
and ``news flashes.''
   ``I thought it was a pretty good price for six days of work,''
Koch said after an anonymous buyer snapped up the broadcasting
relic. ``Of course, I was making $75 a week then for weekly radio
shows.''
   The broadcast boosted Koch's career. He went to Hollywood, where
his screenwriting credits included ``Casablanca'' with Humphrey
Bogart, for which he won an Oscar.
   ``It was resting in my file,'' he said. When friends came to
visit, he said, they ``wanted to see the Oscar _ they never asked me
about this.''
   Koch didn't know at first what a stir his realistic script had
caused. Tired from around-the-clock work, he went home to sleep
during the broadcast. The next morning, he heard people on the
street talking about ``invasion'' and ``war.''
   ``I rushed into a barber shop and said, `Are we at war?' The
barber held up the newspaper headline (about the panic.) It was very
strange,'' he said. Afterward, ``They raised me to the magnificent
sum of $125'' a week.

<HEAD>Oscar-Winning Epic Restored For Re-Release</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Twenty-six years after the premiere of ``Lawrence
of Arabia,'' the Oscar-winning epic will be re-released with scenes
that had been cut from the original and a new look and sound created
by a $600,000 restoration.
   The re-edited ``Lawrence'' will be just as its director, David
Lean, intended.
   ```Lawrence of Arabia' was the first film I saw that made me want
to be a moviemaker,'' said director Steven Spielberg, a co-chairman
of the American Film Institute's National Center for Film and Video
Preservation.
   The film institute and Columbia Pictures announced the re-release
on Wednesday.
   The center will receive proceeds from a series of benefits at
which the restored film will premiere: Feb. 4 in New York, Feb. 5 in
Washington and Feb. 12 in Los Angeles.
   The 2{ years of work done on ``Lawrence of Arabia'' were ``the
most expensive, extensive and difficult film restoration ever
attempted,'' said Robert A. Harris, an archivist who conducted the
restoration for the institute.
   ``Lawrence of Arabia'' won Academy Awards for best picture,
director, color cinematography, color art direction, sound, editing
and music, but Lean's original editing plan was not followed in the
rush to get the movie ready in 1962.
   Lean, 80, rerecorded lost parts of the original sound track with
Peter O'Toole, who starred as T.E. Lawrence, and Alec Guinness, who
played King Faisal. New lines were added. Missing ones were redubbed.
   ``All of their voices have mellowed,'' Harris said, ``and so we
had to change the harmonics by using computers.''
   Existing prints of the film were in terrible shape, said Dawn
Steel, president of Columbia Pictures. She and filmmaker Martin
Scorsese are chairmen of the institute's film-preservation fund.
   ``Parts of the film had been cut and lost, and the color was
appalling,'' Steel said. ``But now the film looks brand new. The
color is perfect, and it's the cut that David Lean wanted.''

<HEAD>Call to Postpone Elections, Tamils Threaten Boycott</HEAD>

   Professional, civic and religious
leaders today urged the government to postpone presidential
elections because of ethnic violence that has claimed at least 88
lives this week.
   Separatist Tamil rebels called for a boycott of Monday's
balloting, blaming two main candidates for assassinations and
fighting that wracked this Indian Ocean island for five years.
   Also, soldiers said they captured an underground hide-out of
Sinhalese extremists waging a campaign of terror and intimidation to
overthrow the government. Four rebels were killed and 23
surrendered, said a military spokesman who insisted on anonymity.
   Hours earlier, he said, the Sinhalese radicals raided a southern
village and killed eight people. They left notes warning, ``This is
the fate of government spies.''
   The United Organization for Peace and Democracy, an umbrella
group for 30 professional, social and religious societies, said
President Junius R. Jayewardene should call off the elections
because of escalating violence by the the Sinhalese extremist group
the People's Liberation Front.
   A five-member opposition group called the Democratic People's
Alliance met with Jayewardene, leader of the United National Party,
on Wednesday. ``We asked him to put off the election as already we
feel it will not only not be fair and free but held under tension,''
said a spokesman.
   Jayewardene has not commented, but called a special Cabinet
meeting for Saturday.
   The front said the government cannot conduct a fair election and
urged the 9.3 million voters to boycott polling.
   Opposition politicians, the powerful Buddhist clergy and labor
organizations repeatedly have urged Jayewardene to help defuse the
crisis by forming a caretaker government of all political parties
and suspending emergency regulations imposed May 1983.
   Jayewardene, a Sinhalese, is prohibited by law from seeking a
third six-year term.
   The 82-year-old leader has said he will dissolve Parliament and
step aside Tuesday. Opposition leaders say that will be too late.
   Sinhalese extremists say a government peace accord offering
limited autonomy makes too many concessions to minority Tamils who
are fighting for a separate homeland in the north and east. Nearly
10,000 people have died since the war started in 1983.
   Mainly Hindu Tamils, who are 18 percent of the island's 16
million people, contend they are denied jobs, education and
development by the majority Buddhist Sinhalese.
   The biggest Tamil group, the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam,
today called for an election boycott. They charged the two main
candidates _ Ramasinghe Premadasa of the United National Party and
Sirimavo Bandaranaike of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party _ were
``instrumental in creating the ethnic conflict and have been
responsible for the genocide of Tamils.''

   A man who was castrated by two
intruders while awaiting trial on rape charges has reached a
$100,000 settlement in a lawsuit against a former sheriff who
displayed the man's testicles in a jar.
   Wayne Dumond, 39, convicted of rape and kidnapping in 1985 and
serving a sentence of life plus 20 years, plans to use part of the
money to pay legal fees in his appeal, said his attorney, John
Wesley Hall Jr.
   Dumond won a federal lawsuit in August against St. Francis County
and former Sheriff Coolidge Conlee, who was accused of displaying
Dumond's testicles in a jar of formaldehyde on his desk.
   Dumond, who was castrated at home by two masked intruders using
fishing line, claimed he was humiliated by Conlee's display and said
it forced him and his family to go into hiding. The intruders were
never caught.
   A federal jury awarded umond $150,000 in damages, but Hall
accepted a check Monday from Imperial Casualty Insurance Co. of
Omaha, Neb.
   ``We settled because the amount we got was so close to what we
were entitled to,'' he said. ``We gave them a little discount to get
the money now instead of waiting another year while they filed more
appeals.''
   Conlee was sentenced on Dec. 7 to 20 years in federal prison for
racketeering, gambling and extortion.

<TEXT>
   Former heavyweight boxing champion Muhammad Ali
suddenly has taken responsibility for a flurry of recent phone calls
to politicians and journalists, following reports that an ``Ali
telephone impostor'' had made the calls.
   ``I've been making the calls,'' Ali told a news conference on the
steps of the Capitol on Wednesday.
   The Atlanta Journal and the Atlanta Constitution had reported
last week that Ali told sports columnist David Kindred he was not
responsible for the phone calls, which the newspaper said were aimed
at promoting projects for personal gain.
   At his Washington news conference, Ali acknowledged that he had
told the Atlanta newspaper he did not make the phone calls. But he
said he made the denial in order to escape questioning by Kindred,
who ``kept following me around.''
   ``I told him I didn't make the calls just to get him off my
back,'' Ali said.
   The Atlanta newspaper reported that an ``Ali voice'' this year
had called at least six U.S. senators, two administrative
assistants, 10 press secretaries, nine journalists, 14 senatorial
aides, then-Attorney General Edwin Meese III and Arthur B.
Culvahouse Jr., counsel to President Reagan.
   Glenn McCutchen, managing editor of the Atlanta Journal and the
Atlanta Constitution, said, ``We absolutely believe that everything
we published was dead on the money and nothing Mr. Ali has said
today changes my mind about that.''
   ``Muhammad Ali on more than one occasion has said he did not make
the phone calls to politicians,'' McCutchen said. ``He has said that
to David Kindred. He has said that to at least two other friends of
Ali's. On one occasion other than today, he has told us he did not
make the calls.''
   The newspapers' report suggested that many of the calls may have
been made by Ali's attorney, Richard M. Hirschfeld of
Charlottesville, Va., who, according to associates quoted by the
newspaper, does a convincing impersonation of the former champ.
   At his news conference, Ali said Hirschfeld told him that the
newspaper story ``was crazy.''
   ``How can somebody use my voice?'' Ali said.
   Ali told reporters that Hirschfeld had set up meetings last
spring with several politicians, including Sens. Orrin G. Hatch,
R-Utah, Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., Strom Thurmond, R-S.C., and John
Warner, R-Va., as well as with Meese.
   ``I did this because I had things I wanted to say,'' he said in a
hand-written statement.
   ``Now that I am not boxing, I want to fight poverty, world hunger
and etc.,'' the statement said. ``I also campaign for people I trust
and believe in, like George Bush, Steven Saltzburg (who became an
assistant attorney general) and others.
   ``My life is full of controversy,'' he said. ``So don't be
surprised, because I will be making more phone calls.''
   Asked how the original story had come about, Ali said Kindred
``kept following me around, asking me did I make phone calls to
senators. He followed me so much, I just said, `No. I haven't made
no calls.' So, he wasn't writing and didn't have no pen. I looked up
and a week or two later and read in the paper that Ali didn't make
the calls. I'm here to tell you, it was me. I did make the calls.''
   Ali denied that Hirschfeld had impersonated him. He described the
attorney as ``the best friend a man can have.''

   Vietnam said it would return today what could
be the largest single group of remains of American servicemen
missing from the Vietnam War, according to the Pentagon.
   The Defense Department said Wednesday that the repatriation had
been scheduled in Hanoi and would include what the Vietnamese
believe were the remains of 38 individuals.
   The largest previous repatriation, which occurred in April,
totaled the remains of 27 war dead.
   The Vietnamese government also claims it will have other,
unspecified ``information'' to share with the United States about
the status of 12 additional cases of missing Americans, said Lt.
Col. Keith Schneider, a Pentagon spokesman.

<TEXT>
   The Justice Department says employers whose
workers are killed or injured on the job can be prosecuted for
murder, manslaughter or assault under state laws and cannot seek
refuge under federal workplace safety laws.
   The department, in an opinion released Wednesday in response to a
request from a congressional committee, said criminal penalties in
the 1970 Occupational Safety and Health Act do not pre-empt state
and local criminal laws.
   ``We see nothing in the (act) or its legislative history which
indicates that Congress intended for the relatively limited criminal
penalties provided by the act to deprive employees of the protection
provided by state criminal laws of general applicability,'' the
department said.
   The opinion flies in the face of several recent state court
rulings throwing out criminal convictions against employers whose
workers were injured through violations of federal job safety
standards.

implementing tariff- and duty-cutting provisions that are required
under the U.S.-Canada Free Trade Agreement.
   The phase-in of cuts in tariffs and import duties on a wide range
of Canadian products already was scheduled to take place on Jan. 1,
so Reagan had to act by 12:01 a.m. EST today.
   The U.S. part of the agreement was consummated with Reagan's

   A congressional panel is calling for a longer
school year and says school buildings should be kept open during off
hours for community purposes such as alcohol and drug counseling.
   Schools should be viewed as ``capital investments in the
communities'' and used for many civic needs, including adult
literacy programs and job counseling, the subcommittee on education
and health of the Joint Economic Committee said in a report issued
Wednesday.
   In addition, subcommittee Chairman James Scheuer, D-N.Y., said
more students should have a chance to go to college so they can
prepare to compete in today's complex work environment.
   Scheuer said the traditional view of education has become
``simply obsolete in today's complex and sophisticated high-tech
environment.''

   A man was spared the electric chair and
sentenced to life in prison for murdering a state legislator with
blows from a hammer.
   Bernard Williams, 18, wiped away tears as he was taken in
shackles from the courthouse Wednesday after sentencing in the
robbery and slaying May 17 of Rep. William Telek, a 64-year-old
Republican from western Pennsylvania.
   Williams was convicted earlier Wednesday.
   The jury deadlocked on the death penalty, giving Judge John C.
Dowling no choice but to sentence Williams to life in prison without
chance of parole.
   Prosecutors said Williams beat Telek in the head, dumped his body
in a suburban street and stole about $100 and Telek's car after the
legislator left a late-night poker game. Williams was arrested later
that day, driving Telek's car.
   A hammer that witnesses said matched Telek's wounds was found in
Williams' bedroom.
   Williams testified that he he took the car from an acquaintance
and found the hammer in the car.
   The murder, believed to be the state's first involving a sitting
legislator, prompted a review of security at the Capitol. Telek was
last seen alive in the building's underground garage following the
card game.
   ``I'm innocent,'' Williams said. ``Why should I be happy to get
life for something I didn't do? If I'd have did it, I'd have pleaded
guilty to it.''
   Telek's widow, Leona Lee, said in a statement: ``In this case,
let's just say justice has prevailed.'

   The U.S. decision to open a dialogue with
the PLO was hailed today in the Arab world and beyond as a step that
would advance peace in the Middle East. Some Palestinian refugees
wept for joy at the news.
   The Soviet Union, Britain, Italy and Japan were among nations
joining Arab states in expressing pleasure at the U.S. move,
announced Wednesday by Secretary of State George P. Shultz.
   Israel expressed shock and sorrow over the decision, saying it
would not serve the cause of peace.
   ``This is a great step by a great nation,'' said Mohammed
Milhelm, the former mayor of Halhoul in the occupied West Bank who
was expelled by Israel.
   ``One of the major roadblocks has now been removed to convening
an international conference and the peaceful co-existence between
all peoples and all religions and all states,'' he said.
   In Cairo, a senior Foreign Ministry official said Egypt welcomed
the U.S. move and considered it ``an important step and a positive
development on the road to a comprehensive peace in the region.
   ``Egypt played a big role in the developments and contacts that
led to this step,'' added the official, who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
   Egypt's leading newspaper, the state-owned Al Ahram, hailed the
U.S. decision with an eight-column headline: ``Historic Development
Serving Peace Efforts in the Middle East.''
   The daily reported from Washington that the Shultz decision came
only hours after President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt phoned him ``to
urge him to take a positive attitude toward the constructive
decisions of the PLO.''
   In Geneva, Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Vladimir Petrovsky said
today the U.S. decision was ``a reasonable action going in the right
direction.''
   Britain welcomed the move in a statement by Foreign Office
Minister William Waldegrave, who said in Cairo: ``I welcome the fact
that the Americans share our analysis that the PLO has moved to
positions that represent real progress.''
   Italian Prime Minister Ciriaco de Mita, visiting Washington, said
``one cannot but express a positive attitude'' toward the
development, and Greek government spokesman Sotiris Kostopoulos said
it ``creates very hopeful prospects'' for progress in the Middle
East. Japan and Australia also issued statements praising the U.S.
move.
   In Oslo, Foreign Minister Thorvald Stoltenberg of Norway was
quoted by the national NTB news agency as saying ``Israel's rigid
attitude toward the Palestine Liberation Organization is not serving
Israeli interests.''
   ``I will not be surprised if the Americans are fed up with
Israel's rigid attitude in the Middle East issue,'' he said. ``The
American willingness to start such a dialogue is an important step
in the direction of a peace conference and a solution of the Middle
East conflict.''
   George Habash, leader of the hardline PLO faction Popular Front
for the Liberation of Palestine, said, ``Although the U.S.
administration says that initiating the dialogue does not entail
recognition of Palestinian rights to ... an independent state, we
still welcome the latest development.''
   He said the U.S. move was taken ``so Washington could end the
diplomatic isolation that followed its refusal to grant (PLO)
Chairman Yasser Arafat a visa to go to New York (last month to
address the United Nations).''
   Habash's statement referred to ``Israel'' instead of ``the
Zionist entity,'' a phrase the Popular Front and other factions have
traditionally used to describe the Jewish state.
   Kamel Abu Jaber, head of Jordan's World Affairs Council, said the
U.S. decision had improved its image in the Arab world.
   ``It has just pulled the United States from the mud it has
planted itself in for the last 40 years ... and appears it is
heading in the right direction, for the benefit of the Palestinains
and the benefit of the Israelis,'' he declared.
   ``It has created a new reality with which the Israelis will live
and have to live,'' he noted.
   Beirut's leftist An-Nidaa daily was headlined: ``American Retreat
Under Blows of Stone-throwing Heroes.'' It referred to the yearlong
Palestinian uprising in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   The official Saudi Arabian news agency announced the Shultz
decision with the headline, ``Finally, American-Palestinian
dialogue.''
   In the Hussein Palestinian refugee camp in Amman, accountant Said
Khalidy, 26, said, ``I never expected the United States would look
at us or care to find a solution to the Palestinian issue.
   ``At last the Reagan administration has done something worthwhile
... and it should be thanked for it.''

   Vietnam today gave a U.S. military team
38 sets of suspected remains of missing American servicemen in the
largest such repatriation since the Vietnam War ended, a U.S.
spokesman said.
   A U.S. military honor guard loaded the remains, each in metal
caskets topped with U.S. flags, onto an Air Force plane during a
solemn 50-minute ceremony at Hanoi airport, said Lt. Col. Thomas J.
Boyd of the U.S. Pacific Command.
   He said the plane took off for Honolulu, where the Army Central
Identification Laboratory will determine if the remains belong to
any of the 1,747 Americans listed as missing in action, or MIA, in
Vietnam.
   ``They presented possible names associated with some of the
remains,'' Boyd said. ``The remains are all associated with
incidents in the northern provinces. They said they were found in
lots of different circumstances and some of the remains were found
by local villagers.''
   Boyd said the Vietnamese also turned over information on 12 other
missing Americans.
   Xinhua, the official Chinese news agency, quoted unidentified
Vietnamese sources as saying Vietnam will step up the search for
American MIAs and has agreed to accept more U.S. teams to conduct
searches.
   The previous largest turnover of suspected MIA remains involved
27 sets handed over April 6.
   Boyd said a four-member team of U.S. forensic experts examined 45
boxes of other remains in Hanoi and found some they recommended be
analysed in the United States. Earlier reports had said 80 sets of
remains were examined.
   The other three teams searched Binh Tri Thien and Nghe Tinh
provinces in north-central Vietnam, looking at U.S. warplane crash
sites and interviewing villagers who witnessed the crashes, Boyd
said. Their 10-day project ended today.
   Investigators focus on 70 ``discrepancy cases'' where the United
States says Vietnamese authorities should have information,
including cases of captured airmen who were never returned.
   Boyd said Vietnamese and U.S. technical experts would meet in
Hanoi Monday to Wednesday to review work, decide on possible
repatriations and discuss future projects.
   Since the war ended, Vietnam has returned remains of 172
Americans which have been identified by the Army laboratory.
   Currently, 2,383 Americans are listed as MIA: 1,747 in Vietnam,
547 in Laos, 83 in Cambodia, and six in China.
   Today's repatriation will be the seventh since retired Gen. John
W. Vessey, acting as a special U.S. envoy, reached agreement in
August 1987 with Vietnam's Foreign Minister Nguyen Co Thach to end
months of deadlock on the MIA issue.
   The first American combat troops landed in then-South Vietnam in
March 1965. The Paris Peace Accords in January 1973 halted U.S.
fighting in the conflict, which claimed the lives of about 58,000
Americans and ended in the communist victory over the U.S.-backed
South Vietnamese government in April 1975.
   Bitter political bickering between Hanoi and Washington has often
blocked accounting for the U.S. missing. The U.S. government says it
will not consider normalizing relations with Vietnam until Hanoi
withdraws all its troops from Cambodia and resolves the MIA issue.
   In Laos, U.S. and Laotian officials were continuing a joint
excavation today in southern Savannakhet province to try to
determine the fate of a pilot shot down in 1968. The excavation, to
be completed in a few days, is the fourth such joint project in Laos.

   China said today that a Dutch woman broke the law
by being at the scene of a Tibetan demonstration during which
Chinese police shot her in the arm.
   Foreign Ministry spokesman Li Zhaoxing said Christa Meindersma of
Amsterdam violated a law that forbids foreigners to mingle with
Tibetans during riots. She was among at least 13 people injured
during the protest Saturday in Lhasa, the Tibetan capital, in which
Chinese officials said a Tibetan Buddhist monk was killed.
   Western witnesses said they saw two bodies, including that of a
small child, and that Tibetans told them seven people were killed.
   Li said Ms. Meindersma also violated customs regulations by
bringing into Lhasa a book by the Dalai Lama, Tibet's exiled former
leader. The book, ``My Land And My People,'' is banned in China
because it advocates Tibet's independence from China.
   Ms. Meindersma told The Associated Press in a telephone interview
from Lhasa that she was reading the book to learn Tibetan. She said
police confiscated the book and her passport.
   Earlier this week authorities barred Ms. Meindersma from leaving
Lhasa, but gave her permission to leave Wednesday at the request of
the Dutch government.
   Ms. Meindersma, Schwartz and other Western witnesses said
Saturday's protest began when about 30 Tibetans walked silently into
Lhasa's central market square behind a monk carrying the banned flag
of pre-Communist Tibet.
   The witnesses said police opened fire on the crowd without
warning. China's official media maintains the police gave a warning
first and then fired in the air.
   Ms. Meindersma told the AP she stood not among the demonstrators
but with a large crowd of curious onlookers. She said police
continued firing at her and others even as they ran from the scene
in panic.
   Li refused to say if any formal charges had been brought against
Ms. Meindersma. But Willem de Bruin, adminstrative and consular
attache at the Dutch Embassy, said today that authorities told him
no charges would be filed.
   Li did not acknowledge that Ms. Meindersma was shot by police,
and only spoke of her being ``slightly injured.'' She said a bullet
entered her left arm and exited through her shoulder.
   Tibetan activists seeking the return of the Dalai Lama and an end
to 38 years of Chinese Communist rule have demonstrated repeatedly
over the past 14 months. Saturday's confrontation was the third
protest to end in bloodshed.
   According to Western travelers, at least 38 people were killed in
violent clashes with police on Oct. 1, 1987 and March 5.
   The Dalai Lama headed Tibet's civil administration before
Communist Chinese troops entered in 1950. He fled to India in 1959
during an abortive anti-Chinese uprising.

   Former U.S. Sen. Stuart Symington, a champion
and watchdog of the nation's military who died at age 87, was
offered _ then denied _ the No. 2 spot on the 1960 presidential
ticket with John F. Kennedy, a friend says.
   The former Missouri senator, who died Wednesday at his home in
New Canaan, Conn., was the nation's first Air Force secretary and
built a reputation as a principled politician. He died of heart
disease, said son James Symington.
   He was at first a champion of military air power and big military
outlays, but opposed the Vietnam War, became increasingly critical
of defense spending and ``excessive secrecy'' and was an opponent of
the F-14 fighter.
   Washington lawyer and former Defense Secretary Clark A. Clifford
recalled the 1960 Democratic convention and events that could have
made Symington vice president.
   ``The day before the decision was to be made, Senator Kennedy
said, `I'm now offering the No. 2 position to Senator Symington.
Take it to him and get back to me,''' he said.
   Clifford said Symington accepted but Kennedy backed out under
strong pressure to select a Southerner and went with Lyndon B.
Johnson of Texas.
   ``I took that back to Senator Symington,'' Clifford said. ``He
seemed very relaxed about it. He didn't seem to be hungering for it
(the nomination) anyway.''
   Symington served as a senator from 1953 until his retirement in
1977 and held various posts in the Truman administration, including
Air Force secretary in 1947-50 and assistant secretary of war for
air in 1946-47.
   He was a favorite-son candidate for the Democatic presidential
nomination in 1956 and 1960.
   Before that, he was a trouble-shooting industrialist summoned to
St. Louis to bring strike-plagued Emerson Electric Co. back to
financial prosperity in 1937.
   ``He exuded integrity,'' said U.S. District Judge William L.
Hungate, who served as a House Democrat from Missouri from 1964 to
1977. ``There was no question of any improprieties. No shadows ever
fell on Stuart Symington.''
   ``He was one of those tall trees whose falling will leave a great
vacant spot'' said former state Treasurer James Spainhower, a
Democrat.
   Sen. John C. Danforth, R-Mo., won Symington's seat after he
decided not to seek re-election in 1976. Symington resigned before
his term ended so Danforth would have the most seniority of the new
senators elected that year.
   ``To consider that he did this for someone who had run against
him, for someone of the other party, says a lot about this man,
about the bigness of the man and about his concern for our state,''
Danforth said.
   Symington was born in Amherst, Mass., in 1901. He graduated from
Yale University in 1923 and entered business.
   In 1978, Symington married Ann ``Nancy'' Hemingway Watson and
moved to New Caanan, a wealthy Connecticut community just north of
New York City. Symington's first wife, Evelyn Wadsworth Symington,
died in 1972.
   In addition to his wife and son, Symington is survived by another
son, Stuart Symington Jr., six grandchildren and six
great-grandchildren.

   At least six bombs exploded today and late
Wednesday in Santiago and other cities, and police said 13 people
were injured. A leftist guerrilla group claimed responsibility.
   In the worst incident, a powerful bomb went off late Wednesday
night one block from the presidential palace, injuring five people.
   Military President Augusto Pinochet was not at the palace when
the explosion occurred.
   The Manuel Rodriguez Patriotic Front, a leftist urban guerrilla
group, said it planted the bombs to mark the fifth anniversary of
its founding Wednesday. A spokesman for the group telephoned several
news agencies, including The Associated Press.
   In Quilpue, a city 95 miles northwest of Santiago, a firebomb
planted at a public transportation depot totally destroyed a vehicle
Wednesday evening. Police said 8 people suffered minor burns.
   Several Santiago neighborhoods suffered blackouts which police
blamed on bombs.
   It was the second straight night of similar bomb attacks. At
least 10 bombs exploded Tuesday in Santiago and other cities,
causing property damage but no injuries.
   In another Wednesday night attack, a bomb partially destroyed a
small stretch of railroad track just south of Santiago, halting
traffic for several hours, according to police.
   Guerrillas also raided two small radio stations in Santiago and
the northern city of La Serena and briefly broadcast anti-government
slogans, police said.

   A Soviet emigre with close links to
Israeli politicians and army officers was convicted today of spying
for the Soviet Union and sentenced to nine years in prison, his
attorney said.
   Shabtai Kalmanovich, 43, was convicted in a closed Tel Aviv
district courtroom of espionage and having contacts with a foreign
agent, said attorney Amnon Zichroni. The charges carry a maximum
penalty of 30 years in prison.
   The three-judge panel dropped a third, more severe charge of
aggravated espionage which carried a life sentence, Zichroni said.
   He said Kalmanovich would be credited with the year he already
has spent in prison and would serve another eight years in jail.
   The trial was held behind closed doors since Sept. 5. No details
have been given of Kalmanovich's spying activities.
   The conviction came during a gradual thaw in relations between
Israel and the Soviet Union. Moscow severed ties with the Jewish
state after the 1967 Middle East war.
   Israel and the Soviet Union have exchanged consular delegations,
and relations were boosted earlier this month when Israel cooperated
with Soviet authorities in returning four armed Soviet hijackers who
landed in Israel.
   Kalmanovich was arrested last December.
   After emigrating from the Soviet Union in 1971, Kalmanovich
established himself as an international businessman, an activist in
the Labor Party and a socialite who mixed with leading politicians
and senior army officers, according to Israeli media reports.
   He also worked briefly as an aide to former Israeli legislator
Shmuel Flatto-Sharon.

<TEXT>
   A 41-year-old Swede was remanded in
custody today on suspicion of killing Prime Minister Olof Palme,
raising hopes for a solution to the mystery which has traumatized
Sweden for nearly three years.
   Chief Prosecutor Anders Helin filed the remand order in Stockholm
District Court a day after the arrest of the man, whose name was
withheld by authorities. Prosecutors said he denied killing Palme.
   The move means that authorities feel they have enough evidence to
make a case against the suspect and may hold him indefinitely for
further interrogation.
   He was arrested Wednesday and, after a full day of questioning,
was booked ``on suspicion of having committed the murder,'' Deputy
Prosecutor-General Axel Morath told reporters.
   Palme was shot as he walked home with his wife from a late-night
movie Feb. 28, 1986.
   ``There is reason to believe it will be a difficult case,'' said
Arne Liljefors, the lawyer assigned to defend the suspect.
   He is the first person arrested on suspicion of being the
mysterious gunman dubbed ``the Grand Man,'' who followed Palme for
several hundred feet after he left the Grand Theater and then shot
him.
   The national news agency TT said witnesses identified the suspect
in a lineup as the Grand Man, apparently a key factor in the
decision to arrest him formally.
   Investigators have been sharply criticized by several government
inquiry commissions for mishandling the manhunt and squabbling among
themselves. The chief detective in the case has been replaced twice.
   ``The police's inability to find the murderer has created a
national trauma in our country ... and undermined the citizens'
faith in the legal system,'' the Aftonbladet daily said today.
   ``If the murder of Olof Palme isn't cleared up it will remain
like a sickness in Swedish society ... That's why a lot of people
hope the suspect arrested Wednesday really is the killer,'' it said
in an editorial.
   Palme was a four-term prime minister of this neutral nation and a
leader of the world disarmament movement.
   Investigators refused to officially release information on the
suspect, but Swedish police reporters were given access to his
record. Reports said he has 63 convictions and has spent the last 22
years in and out of prisons or psychiatric wards for dangerous
criminals.
   The man was convicted of stabbing an alleged drug addict to death
with a bayonet in 1970 just a few yards from where Palme was shot 16
years later.
   Police offered no possible motive, but news reports said the
suspect has spoken in a hostile and threatening manner about Palme
in the past.
   The initial inquiry focused on a political motive. Ousted Iranian
President Abolhassan Bani-Sadr claimed Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini
ordered Palme's slaying when the prime minister discovered and
stopped a Swedish company's illegal arms shipments to Tehran.

   The U.S. Army today removed nine
more U.S.-built Pershing 2 nuclear missiles from a base, the third
batch to be withdrawn from West Germany under the superpower treaty
signed a year ago.
   The missiles, under the control of the U.S. Army's 56th Field
Artillery Brigade, were loaded onto army trucks that departed Wiley
Barracks in Neu Ulm, 180 miles southeast of Frankfurt, in two
convoys.
   U.S. Army spokesman Major Jerry Hart said one convoy, carrying
first- and second-stage rocket motors and radar and guidance
systems, was being shipped to the United States where the motors
will be destroyed.
   The missile components to be flown to the United States were
packed in large metal containers, he said.
   ``A second convoy consisting of missile erector launchers left
about 9 a.m. and are on the way to the U.S. Army's Missile
Maintenance Center in Hausen, where they will be scheduled for
destruction,'' Hart said. Hausen is a Frankfurt suburb about 180
miles north of Neu Ulm.
   It was the third removal of Pershing II missiles under the
Intermediate Nuclear Forces Treaty signed by Soviet President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev and President Reagan in Washington last
December.
   The first batch of nine Pershing IIs were removed Sept. 1, from
Heilbronn, 120 miles southeast of Frankfurt. Nine more of the
missiles were withdrawn from Mutlangen, 24 miles east of Stuttgart,
on Nov. 15.
   Of those deployed, 108 Pershing 2 and 96 cruise missiles were
stationed at four bases in West Germany. All are to be removed by
May 31, 1991 under the superpower accord.

   U.S. Ambassador Robert H. Pelletreau Jr.
made a brief telephone call to PLO headquarters this morning,
launching the dialogue authorized by Secretary of State George P.
Shultz, spokesmen for the two sides said.
   Adnan Siddiqi, information officer at the U.S. Embassy, said the
telephone call was made to start what Shultz said Wednesday will be
a ``substantive dialogue'' with the Palestine Liberation
Organization.
   In Washington, a U.S. official said Pelletreau had called the
director general of the political section at the PLO's Tunis
headquarters to try to make arrangements for talks.
   The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said no date
for the talks was set but ``we're sure the PLO will try hard to have
them take place as soon as possible.''
   Another U.S. official said the session could be held as early as
tomorrow and certainly within the next few days.
   Siddiqi, reached by telephone from Paris, said he did not know
who Pelletreau spoke to, what they discussed, or when the first
face-to-face talks might be arranged.
   Abu Yahia, director of the PLO political section, confirmed in a
telephone interview from Paris that the conversation took place but
declined to identify the PLO official who spoke with Pelletreau.

<DATELINE>SHIPPINGPORT, Pa. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lifting a 1,000-ton reactor vessel from
its underground site at the nation's first commercial nuclear plant
was the hard part, but officials still have to take the 41-foot
vessel 7,800 miles to the dump.
   The reactor pressure vessel and neutron-shield tank, packed with
concrete, were lifted from the ground Wednesday at the Shippingport
nuclear plant and placed on a specially made transporter to be taken
to a storage site to until spring.
   The vessel then will be put on a barge and shipped 7,800 miles
via several rivers and two oceans to a military dump in Washington
state.
   The plant is the largest nuclear unit and only commercial reactor
in the world to be dismantled. Several nuclear plants have been
mothballed or entombed.
   The raising of the reactor pressure vessel is the most dramatic
stage of the five-year dismantling of the plant, dedicated by
President Eisenhower in 1957 and retired in 1982 after generating
about 6.5 billion kilowatts.
   ``Everything worked just like we expected it to. It's been very
successful,'' said Karen Wheeless, spokeswoman for the Energy
Department, which owns the plant.
   Representatives of the two companies responsible for the $5
million operation expressed satisfaction about the job.
   ``This is not the biggest lift ever made, but it's one of the
most complicated,'' said Don Nolan Jr. of Williams Crane & Rigging
Inc. of Richmond, Va. ``It took about six months just to get ready
for this.''
   Wednesday's big move was also the federal government's attempt to
prove that reactors can be dismantled safely and affordably,
providing a model for utilities when their reactors have outlived
their usefulness.
   ``You've got to take reactors from the cradle to the grave. If
you can't handle the burial, there's some question of whether you
should be handling a reactor at all,'' Wheeless said.
   Even success for the Shippingport operation will not solve the
problem facing the commercial nuclear power industry of where to
dispose of high-level commercial waste.
   While waste from Shippingport is going to military dumps in Idaho
and at Hanford, Wash., a national repository for spent fuel that was
to open in 1998 probably won't be open until the next century,
Wheeless said.
   The Energy Department estimates 15 U.S. nuclear plants will reach
the end of their 30- to 40-year useful lives by the year 2000.
Almost all of the 12,000 metric tons of spent uranium from private
reactors is being stored in holding ponds.
   Low-level radiation is left in the Shippingport reactor, but
``unless you attach it to your body and wear it as an undergarment,
there is no danger,'' Wheeless said.
   Federal officials intend to remove all radioactive material so
the site 30 miles northwest of Pittsburgh can be returned to
unrestricted use. The decommissioning is expected to be completed by
1990 at a cost of $98 million.
   The cylindrical reactor will be rolled to the Ohio River and
placed on a 200-foot barge in the spring and shipped via the Ohio
and Mississippi rivers, the Gulf of Mexico, Panama Canal, Pacific
Ocean and Columbia River to Hanford.

<HEAD>Roman Catholic Order Expels Activist Priest in Haiti</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ROME (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Roman Catholic order said today it had expelled an
activist priest in Haiti it accused of instigating violence and
exalting class warfare. The priest was the apparent target of a
September attack that killed 13 people.
   The Rev. Jean Bertrand Aristide had been at odds with superiors
of his Salesian order in Rome for some time. He had been ordered to
leave his homeland and go to Canada by Oct. 17.
   But Aristide, 35, defied the order and a spokesman for the
Salesian order, the Rev. Giuseppe Costa, said he is still on the
island.
   A communique by the Salesian Society of St. John Bosco said
Aristide has rebuffed repeated attempts to correct his behavior,
which they described as ``in contrast with his Salesian and priestly
vocation.''
   ``The type of political commitment he has assumed is in serious
contrast with the clear will of the founder (of the order). In
addition, the incitement to hate and violence, the exaltation of
class struggle, go directly against that fidelity to the (teaching)
of the church that forms a living part of the Salesian spirit.''
   It called him a ``destabilizing'' element for Haitian Roman
Catholics.
   Aristide has led calls for an uprooting of the vestiges of the
former regime of Jean-Claude Duvalier, who was overthrown in 1986.
   In September, Aristide was the apparent object of a bloody attack
on his church in the Haitian capital of Port-au-Prince during a
Sunday Mass by thugs linked to the ousted regime.
   Thirteen people were killed and more than 70 were wounded.
Aristide escaped.
   The massacre provoked another military coup, in which
rank-and-file soldiers ousted Lt. Gen. Henri Namphy and replaced him
with Lt. Gen. Prosper Avril.
   The statement said the action by the order was ``painful'' but
that there was no way Aristide could remain a Salesian without
changing his ways.
   ``The Salesians continue to pray for Jean B. Aristide, still
nourishing the hope of a sincere fraternal embrace as soon as he
wants it,'' the statement said.
   The order's spokesman said the decree, which was ratified by the
Vatican last week, did not change Aristide's status as a priest.

<TEXT>
   Federal health officials today announced a
new AIDS study that will focus on heterosexual men and women at high
risk of contracting the fatal disease because of multiple sex
partners or other factors.
   ``The sexual transmission and progression of AIDS among
heterosexuals is virtually unexplored territory,'' said Dr. Stanley
H. Weiss, one of the nation's leading AIDS researchers who will head
the study in Newark.
   ``In effect, we will be helping to write the book on this
subject,'' said Weiss, head of the Department of Preventive Medicine
at the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey.
   The National Instituteof Allergy and Infectious Diseases in
Washington said the study is to be conducted among 2,000
heterosexuals in Newark, N.J., and Brooklyn, N.Y., over a five-year
period.
   Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, director of the institute, said the purpose
of the study is to develop more effective strategies for the
prevention and treatment of AIDS, or acquired immune deficiency
syndrome, in a population that is not homosexual or using
intravenous drugs.
   Only about 4 percent of the adult AIDS cases can be traced to
heterosexual contact, but such sexual conduct accounts for 30
percent of all AIDS cases among women, the NIAID said.
   The study will concentrate on heterosexuals with a history of
what is considered to be high-risk behavior for contracting AIDS.
   The factors include:
   _An average of 10 or more sex partners a year.
   _A history of sexually transmitted disease within the last five
years.
   _Sexual contact with persons, such as homosexuals or intravenous
drug users, who are considered to be at high risk for AIDS.
   _Those infected or exposed to fungal, viral, retroviral,
bacterial or parasitic infections that are thought to increase the
risk of acquiring AIDS.
   Intravenous drug users, a group with one of the highest rates of
AIDS infection, are excluded from the study.
   Newark and Brooklyn were selected for the study, the NIAID said,
``because they are located in inner-city areas populated by large
numbers of HIV-infected drug users, a potential reservoir of
infectivity for heterosexuals.''
   HIV, or human immunodeficiency virus, is the organism that causes
AIDS.
   A thousand heterosexual men and women will be recruited for the
New Jersey portion of the study. They will come from counseling and
test sites set up by the state in three health facilities in
northern New Jersey and from a Newark hospital.
   The New York study will concentrate on recruiting heterosexual
women, but a select group of men who are sexual partners of female
members of the study group also will be sought. The New York study
also will seek steady male sexual partners of women who test
positive for AIDS after first testing negative. The New York cohort
will be recruited from clinics in the Brooklyn area, and from the
sex partners of the AIDS population in the area.
   Drs. Sheldon H. Landesman and Jack A. DeHovitz of the State
University of New York-Health Science Center at Brooklyn will head
the second study. A data collection and coordination center in Ann
Arbor, Mich., will be headed by Richard Cornell of the University of
Michigan School of Public Health.
   Strict patient confidentiality is to be observed in both study
areas, the NIAID said.
   The NIAID said the goal of the studies is to determine the
natural history of AIDS infection among heterosexual men and women
who have no history of intravenous drug use; to examine sexual
behaviors associated with spread of HIV in such a group, and any
biological or environmental cofactors that affect the spread and
severity of the disease.
   The institute is awarding five-year contracts to conduct the
research. The cost for the first year is about $4 million, the
agency said.
   NIAID is one of the National Institutes of Health and is the
agency primarily responsible for directing the federal government's
scientific study of AIDS.
   AIDS is a contagious disease that attacks the body's immune
system, rendering the victim incapable of resisting other diseases
and infections. The virus most often is spread through close contact
with blood, blood products or semen from infected persons. It also
is spread from an infected mother to an infant during or just after
birth.
   As of Dec. 5, 1988, AIDS had been diagnosed in 79,823 Americans,
of whom more than half, or 44,826, have died since June 1, 1981,
according to federal statistics. No one is known to have recovered
from AIDS.

peace conference and for temporarily placing the Israeli-occupied
territories under U.N. supervision.
   The United States and Israel voted against the action.
   The vote on the resolution came after the new U.S. willingness to
talk to the PLO drew a widely positive response.
   The final tally was 138-2, with two abstentions, Canada and Costa
Rica. Iran did not participate in the vote, and Libya and Syria
voted yes with reservations, saying they did not recognize Israel,
which was mentioned in the resolution.
   The vote closed out a three-day debate on Palestine which was
held in Geneva after the United States refused to grant PLO Chairman
Yasser Arafat a visa to speak at the United Nations in New York.
   The main resolution passed by the General Assembly calls for the
convening of an international conference under U.N. auspices ``with
the participation of all parties to the conflict, including the
Palestine Liberation Organization, on an equal footing...''
   It requests the U.N. Security Council to establish a preparatory
committee for convening the conference.
   The resolution ``affirms'' principles for achieving comprehensive
peace, including ``the withdrawal of Israel from the Palestinian
territory occupied since 1967, including Jerusalem, and the other
occupied Arab territories.''
   The resolution also ``notes the expressed desire and endeavors to
place the Palestinian territory occupied since 1967, including
Jerusalem, under the supervision of the United Nations for a limited
period, as part of the peace process.''
   A separate resolution ``acknowledges the proclamation of the
State of Palestine by the Palestine National Council'' on Nov. 15.
   It says that effective Dec. 15, the designation ``Palestine''
will replace ``Palestine Liberation Organization'' in the U.N.
system, but the move did not amount to U.N. recognition of a
Palestinian state.
   That resolution passed 104-2, with the United States and Israel
again opposed. Thirty-six countries abstained.
   U.S. Ambassador to Geneva Joseph Petrone, in a statement
explaining his country's negative votes on the resolutions, said
they ``are unhelpful and inconsistent with the search for peace.''
   Referring to the call for U.N. supervision in the occupied
territories, Petrone said the proposal was ``impractical and
unrealistic,'' adding, ``we cannot support such a concept.''
   Petrone reiterated the announcement Wednesday by Secretary of
State George Shultz that the PLO had met the three conditions the
U.S. had set for direct U.S.-PLO contacts: explicitly announcing its
acceptance of Security Council resolutions 242 and 338 (calling for
Israeli withdrawal from land it occupied in 1967 and recognizing
safe and secure borders for all Middle East states); recognizing
Israel's right to exist; and renouncing terrorism.
   At least 323 Palestinians and 13 Israelis have died in a yearlong
Palestinian uprising in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza
Strip.

   James Brown failed to heed an officer's
flashing blue lights and siren, the lawman testified today at the
soul singer's assault trial.
   Sheriff's Deputy Donald Danner said he pulled alongside Brown's
truck several times Sept. 24 and the singer swerved as if trying to
run him off the road.
   Brown, known as the Godfather of Soul, also allegedly attempted
to run over two North Augusta Public Safety officers. He is charged
with assault with intent to kill and failure to stop for police.
   Brown ``had a total disregard for his surroundings,'' Danner said
in his report of that day's events.
   Brown, 55, testified Wednesday that he didn't pull over during
the chase through Augusta, Ga., and North Augusta, S.C., because,
``I was scared to death.''
   ``I went to Vietnam and I wasn't that frightened,'' he said.
   Brown said he initially wasn't aware of the first two officers
who attempted to pull him over. Brown seemed somewhat confused about
the sequence of events.
   The singer, wearing a gray suit and blue satin shirt, testified
that he didn't remember driving more than 80 mph. When he did stop,
he said, the officers scared him by shooting at his truck and
banging on the windows.
   Meanwhile, Judge Hubert Long rejected defense arguments that
authorities acted recklessly during the pursuit.
   ``Even if the officers made a mistake and endangered the public,
I don't see what that has to do with ... a man who failed to stop
for a blue light,'' the judge said.
   Brown could receive up to 30 years in prison if convicted.

   Michigan state Democratic chairman Richard
Wiener's campaign to become national party chairman suffered a blow
at the hands of his own governor just as the battle for the top
party job widened.
   Wiener has been regarded as one of the leading contenders to
succeed retiring Democratic national chairman Paul Kirk. But
Michigan Gov. James Blanchard's remark Wednesday that he lacks the
stature required for the post was widely viewed as damaging his
prospects.
   ``I like Rick. He did a great job here in Michigan and is a dear
friend,'' Blanchard told The Detroit News. ``But there is obviously
a strong feeling that the chairman ought to be a presidential type
of candidate, a party spokesman who can be on television responding
to George Bush, a person of existing national stature.''
   Blanchard, in an interview with the Associated Press later, said
he did not intend his remarks as criticism of Wiener and regarded
him as a good choice ``if we're looking for a nuts-and-bolts guy.''
   Blanchard said he was not yet endorsing any of the candidates
because as chairman of the Democratic Governors Association he wants
to consult with the other governors.
   The race for the Democratic chairmanship widened as two more
candidates, former Reps. James R. Jones of Oklahoma and Michael
Barnes of Maryland, formally announced.
   A third candidate, former top Jesse Jackson aide Ronald H. Brown,
rounded up the endorsement of former presidential candidate Bruce
Babbitt in his attempt to establish broader credentials in the party.
   Wiener sought to put the best face on Blanchard's comment, saying
it was candid and positive.
   ``What I have done throughout my professional career is put
together campaigns and later a state party that has elected a lot of
people,'' Wiener said.
   Jones, a longtime party insider, said he hoped to avoid a
divisive free-for-all that some are predicting would pit the Jackson
wing of the party against Southerners, conservatives and moderates.
   ``I think there is a myth that this is a blood-bath type of
election,'' Jones said.
   The nearly 400 voting members of the Democratic National
Committee will select a new chairman to replace Kirk when they meet
in Washington on Feb. 9 and 10.
   Babbitt endorsed Brown in a letter to committee members. He said
Brown would not be ``a stalking horse for Jesse Jackson'' but an
effective party builder.
   Jones, former chairman of the House Budget Committee, is a
moderate-to-conservative Democrat who said he would draw on a base
of support among Democrats in the South and West.
   ``My Southern and Western roots place me at the center of our
party's beliefs and ideals,'' he said in a statement.
   Also a factor, however, is a move by Alabama party chairman John
Baker and others to have a current member of Congress, such as Sen.
Lloyd Bentsen of Texas, serve as chairman. But that would require a
change of the party's charter to permit a part-time chairman, a
difficult maneuver needing a two-thirds vote of the committee.
   Jones said he believed he had more than 100 votes among the
committee members so far but acknowledged some were not firm
commitments. The race is expected to be expensive, and Jones said he
is prepared to spend as much as Brown _ perhaps $150,000.

   The owners of dogs sent to Soviet
Armenia to help rescue earthquake victims are angry because the
animals will be placed in quarantine for four months when they
return, news reports said Thursday.
   ``I have a dog at home. If the two dogs are apart for four
months, they won't be able to work as a team when they get back
together again,'' Nils Karlsson, who sent one dog to Armenia, told
the national news agency TT.
   ``Completely scandalous,'' Agneta Eriksson was quoted as saying
from Leninakan, U.S.S.R., where her dog Raffi was searching for
victims.
   The 16 animals, all volunteered for service by their owners, are
credited with finding 14 people so far in the rubble of the
devastated Soviet cities.
   Sweden's animal quarantine laws are among the strictest in
Europe, and they are credited with making the country rabies-free.
Stig Sjostedt, a director of the Rescue Office, said the quarantine
would be enforced, but planned to talk to each dog owner and explain
the necessity for the move.

   The lower house of Parliament on Thursday
approved a constitutional amendment to lower the voting age from 21
to 18.
   The measure, which must be approved by the upper house and
President Ramaswamy Venkataraman, would make as many as 50 million
largely educated, young people eligible to cast ballots in next
year's general elections.
   All 544 members of the Lok Sabha, or lower house, approved the
bill, which has the support of Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi, members
of his governing Congress Party and opposition politicians.
   ``We have full faith in the youth of the country. They have shown
their wisdom and maturity. They are now ready to take part in the
electoral process,'' Gandhi told legislators, who applauded.
   The amendment is part of a package of electoral reforms
introduced last month in Parliament. It says that ``lowering of the
voting age would provide to the unrepresented youth of the country
an opportunity to give vent to their feelings and help them become a
part of the political process.''

   Two youths on motorbikes blocked a Vatican

made off with a payroll of nearly $300,000 in cash and checks,
police reported.
   The car had just picked up the money at the Vatican bank inside
the walls of the tiny city-state and was delivering it to the
Congregation for the Eastern Church to pay salaries, police said.
   The robbery occurred near the entrance to the congregation's
headquarters on Via della Conciliazione, 100 yards from St. Peter's
Square.
   Police said the money was in an attache case on the rear seat of
the Fiat Ritmo. The youths escaped on their motorbikes, speeding
through the narrow streets near the Vatican.
   The driver of the car, Cristiano Codado, 40, was not harmed.
   The Eastern Church congregation supervises rites, discipline and
officials of Eastern rite churches around the world.

   The government will combat a sharp drop in egg
consumption caused by a salmonella poisoning scare by launching an
advertising campaign Friday telling consumers they face little risk
from cooked eggs.
   The $915,000 campaign in the nation's newspapers, called ``Eggs:
The Facts,'' will run through Sunday, said the Department of
Agriculture.
   Demand for eggs in Britain has dropped 30 percent to 60 percent
since Health Minister Edwina Currie said earlier this month that
most of the nation's eggs were tainted with salmonella, according to
the Egg Producers Association.
   The association immediately called for her resignation.
   The ads say the British eat 200 million eggs a week and that the
49 outbreaks of the salmonella this year have affected only about
1,000 people.
   In the ads, the government's chief medical officer, Sir Donald
Acheson, advises healthy people there is ``very little risk'' from
eating cooked eggs.

<TEXT>
   A lawyer for Jim Bakker today said
``electronic ministry'' itself is on trial after the TV evangelist's
first court appearance since his indictment on charges of defrauding
PTL contributors.
   U.S. Magistrate Paul Taylor set unsecured bond of $50,000 for
Bakker and three former aides, and scheduled a court appearance for
Bakker and Richard Dortch on Jan. 17, when they will enter pleas to
fraud and conspiracy charges.
   The defrocked PTL leader and one-time aides are accused of
diverting more than $5 million in contributions to the evangelical
empire in order to live in luxury. Bakker's wife, Tammy, did not
accompany him today; she was not indicted.
   ``I am not guilty of these charges and I'm looking forward to due
process taking place. If I get a fair trial, we can win this case,''
Bakker said after court.
   ``Bakker is not the only one on trial,'' his attorney George T.
Davis said. ``His wife is on trial and the whole ministry _ the
electronic ministry _ is on trial. ''
   Bakker, Dortch and David and James Taggart were indicted Dec. 5
after a 16-month federal grand jury investigation of PTL's finances
before Bakker left the evangelical empire in a sex and money scandal.
   Dortch is Bakker's former top deputy. David Taggart is Bakker's
former personal aide and James Taggart PTL's one-time interior
decorator.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Jerry Miller told Taylor today that no
additional charges were expected against Bakker and Dortch.
   The Taggarts pleaded innocent today to charges of tax evasion.
They are accused of using more than $1.1 million in PTL money for
personal expenditures. Taylor tentatively scheduled their trial for
the last week of January.
   Jim Toms, another Bakker attorney, said he does not expect his
client to enter a plea until next month. Toms said previously that
Bakker would plead innocent.
   Bakker, 48, resigned in 1987 amid revelations he had a sexual
encounter with former church secretary Jessica Hahn and paid her
hush money. Three months later, amid reports of financial
wrongdoing, PTL filed for bankruptcy protection.
   On Tuesday, Canadian real estate magnate Stephen Mernick bought
PTL's assets, including its Christian theme park, hotel and
broadcast studios in Fort Mill, S.C., for $65 million in U.S.
Bankruptcy Court.
   The fate of the PTL's religious operations, which were spun off
by the court into the non-profit Heritage Ministries, remained
unclear. Heritage Ministries uses facilities at the theme park.

   Giovanni Ferzini, described as the oldest

109.
   He died Wednesday in a village south of Parma, the family said.
   Ferzini, who was born July 23, 1879, left his village only once,
and that was when he was an infantryman in World War I.
   After the war he returned to the Lupazzano, married and fathered
13 sons. Seven of his sons surrvived him.
   Ferzini was a farmer and an avid hunter who continued to walk the
fields and shoot at game until age 93. He used to say that he missed
the old times, when the air was clean and there was plenty of game.
   A recent survey of Italian municipalities called him the oldest
Italian.
   Lupazzano is a tiny village of 200 inhabitants in a hilly area
renowned for the production and the seasoning of ham.

   Lawzi said the ministry and the army were combating the locusts

   PLO officials were delighted today with the U.S.
decision to begin diplomatic talks with the organization, and PLO
headquarters in Tunisia got its first call from the U.S. envoy
chosen to work with them on seeking peace with Israel.
   Later today, the U.N. General Assembly voted 138-2 for the
convening of an international Middle East peace conference and for
temporarily placing the Israeli-occupied territories under U.N.
supervision.
   Israel and the United States voted against the action.
   The vote closed out a three-day debate on Palestine which was
held in Geneva after the United States refused to grant PLO Chairman
Yasser Arafat a visa to speak at the United Nations in New York.
   The Palestinians credited their people's uprising in Israel's
occupied lands for gaining their cause worldwide sympathy and
leading to the end of U.S. isolation.
   Electrified by the U.S. announcement, they laughed and embraced
in the lobby of the Geneva hotel where their delegation was staying
as they discussed the long-awaited development with reporters.
   PLO spokesman Ahmed Abdel Rahman said the U.S. decision meant ``a
historic change in the struggle in the Middle East.''
   The White House's reversal came after Arafat told a news
conference in Geneva on Wednesday that he renounced ``all forms of
terrorism'' and recognized Israel's right to live in peace and
security.
   Hours later, President Reagan said the United States would begin
a dialogue with the PLO. Secretary of State George P. Shultz said
the PLO had finally met U.S. criteria for negotiations.
   Indeed, the envoy authorized with initiating contact with the PLO
made a brief phone call today to PLO headquarters in Tunisia. A
spokesman for the ambassador, Robert H. Pelletreau Jr., had no
further details.
   No date has been set for the talks, but a State Department
official in Washington, speaking on condition of anonymity, said:
``We're sure the PLO will try to have them take place as soon as
possible.''
   Arafat was in East Berlin today for what the state-run ADN news
agency said was a working visit, and met with East German Communist
leader Erich Honecker. He later left for Bucharest, Romania, the
agency said.
   ADN quoted Arafat as telling Honecker ``the PLO is striving for a
comprehensive settlement of the (Middle East) conflict that would
guarantee to all those involved a life in dignity, freedom and
peace.''
   Israeli officials were shocked.
   They said Arafat's remarks were insufficient because the PLO did
not rule out violence associated with the Palestinian uprising,
which began Dec. 8, 1987 in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip
and has claimed the lives of 323 Palestinians and 13 Israelis.
   On Tuesday, Arafat told the U.N. General Assembly in Geneva that
the PLO accepts ``the right of all parties concerned in the Middle
East conflict to exist in peace and security, and as I have
mentioned including the state of Palestine, Israel and other
neighbors.''
   He also said the PLO accepted U.N. Resolutions 242 and 338, which
recognize the right of all Middle East nations to safe and secure
borders.
   That acceptance was one of three conditions set by U.S. law for
dialogue with the PLO. The others were a clear recognition of Israel
and renunciation of terrorism by the PLO.
   In Jerusalem, Foreign Minister Shimon Peres said his country
should launch a peace initiative of its own to counter the PLO's
latest diplomatic achievements. He proposed letting Palestinians in
the occupied lands elect alternative leaders to negotiate peace with
Israel.
   Shultz said Wednesday night that the United States ``does not
recognize the declaration of an independent Palestinian state,''
made by the PLO in Algeria last month, but that it would be a
subject of discussion.
   In a speech before the world body on Wednesday, U.S. Ambassador
Vernon Walters had said the world should tell Israelis and Arabs it
is tired of their long conflict.
   Walters urged Israel to ``face up to the need for withdrawal from
occupied territories,'' which it seized in the 1967 Middle East war.
The lands are home to 1.7 million Palestinians and 70,000 Jewish
settlers.

   The Soviet Union will soon allow
Korea's national airline to send commercial jets through Soviet
airspace and make refueling stops in Moscow, a newspaper reported
Thursday.
   The newspaper, Hankook Ilbo, said Cho Chung-kun, president of
Korean Air, will visit Moscow later this month to work out details
of the agreement.
   KAL neither confirmed nor denied the report.
   The Soviet Union, which has no diplomatic relations with South
Korea, temporarily allowed KAL planes to fly over its territory to
transport European and African athletes to the 1988 Summer Olympics
in Seoul this fall.
   Officials of the two countries have been negotiating ever since
to extend the decision, but the Soviet Union _ which is closely
allied with Seoul's archrival, North Korea _ has been reluctant to
do so, the paper said.
   The proposed agreement would save KAL flights two to four hours
on routes to Paris and Frankfurt, the newspaper said.

<TEXT>
   The state treasurer has asked the
federal government to investigate an unexplained $200 million loss
in West Virginia's investment fund for local governments.
   The loss has sparked a run on the fund by the local governments,
which have withdrawn more than $100 million in the past three days.
   Three annual reports show that investments in the consolidated
investment fund's ``pool 100'' totaled $773.3 million in 1986. That
figure dropped to $574.1 million a year later, a decrease of $199.2
million.
   No one can say whether the loss represents reduced interest _
money the state thought it would earn but didn't _ or an actual loss
in funds invested.
   The fund was earning a high rate of interest _ up to 13 percent
or more _ during the period when the loss occurred, according to two
annual reports for the state Board of Investments and one from the
state treasurer's office.
   State, county and municipal governments put their money into the
pool, which the state then invests for them.
   Treasurer A. James Manchin on Tuesday urged a federal
investigation into why the fund, which his office manages, suffered
the loss.
   U.S. Attorney Michael Carey said he has passed on to the FBI
Manchin's request that officials determine whether an investigation
is warranted. The FBI has not said whether it will investigate.
   Manchin said he does not believe any criminal wrongdoing is
involved, just ``bad investments.''
   Other probes, including one by the accounting firm of Touche Ross
& Co., are under way.
   Over the past three days, local governments have withdrawn $108.9
million _ including $41.3 million Wednesday _ in reaction to reports
of the loss.
   Several key people involved in the $200 million loss refuse to
discuss it.
   Associate Treasurer Arnold T. Margolin, who was in charge of
investments, has said he alerted Manchin to the problem and is
awaiting the results of the Touche Ross probe.
   Manchin oversees all state investments but accused Margolin of
not handling the investments properly. He said staff members of the
investments office warned Margolin in 1987 that there was a problem,
but he said Margolin _ who has resigned to become an administrative
aide to Gov.-elect Gaston Caperton _ ignored them.
   Manchin has refused to accept Margolin's resignation until the
loss is cleared up.
   Former Assistant Treasurer Kathy Lester, who actually made the
investments for Margolin, disappeared after quitting the treasurer's
office in late 1987.
   Gov. Arch Moore, chairman of the Board of Investments, has
declined to comment.

<HEAD>Visa Waiver Program May Boost Japanese Travel To U.S.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LARRY THORSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Japanese and American tourists and businessmen can
travel to each other's countries without a visa beginning Thursday
under a pilot program that could boost the flow of free-spending
Japanese to America.
   Travel industry spokesmen were unanimous in welcoming the change
for, if nothing else, ending the hassle of spending time or money to
get a visa.
   The change will result in a bit more more paperwork for the
airlines and a lot less for the U.S. Embassy in Tokyo. Expectations
on both sides are that Japanese travel to the United States will
increase.
   Spending an average $1,000 each aside from airline tickets, 2.2
million Japanese travelers went to the United States in 1987, the
most from any country. The projection for 1988 is 2.6 million
U.S.-bound travelers, said Fritz M. Schmitz, regional director of
the U.S. Travel and Tourism Administration, an arm of the U.S.
Commerce Department.
   Only 430,000 American tourists and businessmen visited Japan in
1987, making tourism one of the few sectors where the United States
has a trade surplus with Japan _ about $1 billion last year.
   Schmitz said it wasn't clear how much effect the visa-waiver
program would have but that some estimates predicted a 10 percent
increase in U.S.-bound travel from Japan.
   ``Those of us in tourism promotion have been pushing for it for
years,'' Schmitz said in a telephone interview. ``Freedom to travel
is an important part of better international relations.''
   He acknowledged that the United States, still a magnet for
immigration, was more difficult for tourists to enter than some
other countries. Americans can enter most European countries without
a visa, but Europeans have to obtain visas to travel to America.
   In 1986, the U.S. Congress passed a law authorizing negotiations
with other countries to waive certain visa requirements. The first
agreement, with Britain, went into effect in July, and Japan is the
second to embark on a pilot program that will be reassessed in 1991.
   Robyn Bishop, chief of the visa branch at the U.S. Embassy,
cautioned that the waiver was voluntary and some travelers probably
still would want a visa stamped in their passports. The waiver
doesn't apply to people intending longer stays, such as students,
journalists, researchers, exchange visitors or people about to marry
and move to the United States, Ms. Bishop said.
   Travelers without visas will have to convince immigration
officers at U.S. entry points that they are a bona fide tourist or
businessman by producing a return ticket or one for another
destination, and there can be no extensions of the 90-day limit or
appeals if a traveler is turned back, she said.
   ``We think the Japanese are the right kind of traveler to take
advantage of the visa program,'' she said. ``They take short
vacations, often in tour groups, on fixed itineraries.''
   Ms. Bishop expected the new rule would shorten the lines outside
the Tokyo embassy, which peaked at 1,665 one day in February, a time
when many young Japanese travel after the school year ends and
before they start jobs in April.
   She said about 95 percent of the 930,000 visas issued in Tokyo
last year were for tourism and business visitors.
   At the Japan Travel Bureau, which sent almost 400,000 people to
the United States in 1987, spokesman Keiichi Tsujino said the change
would ease inconvenience and stimulate more travel.
   ``For example, if a client thinks of going to the United States,
he can go instantly,'' Tsujino said. ``This is a welcome change.''

<HEAD>Afrikaners To Celebrate 150th Anniversary of Pioneer Trek</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LAURINDA KEYS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Just before dawn Friday, a few
dozen bearded men in leather clothes will take cover behind ox-drawn
wagons and fight an imaginary battle against a long-ago defeated
Zulu army.
   The pageant by members of right-wing Afrikaner cultural and
political groups will celebrate the Battle of Blood River and the
150th anniversary of the Great Trek that brought the Dutch-descended
pioneers out of the British-ruled Cape Colony into the African
wilderness.
   It won't matter that the make-believe battle won't be seen by
very many people or that it is being staged 20 miles from the
government's main celebration at the Pioneer Monument overlooking
Pretoria.
   Most of the events and celebrations are symbolic, and in South
Africa there are many ways of interpreting them.
   Depending on the interpretation, the 1838 departure of the
pioneer families was undertaken to avoid Britain's abolition of
slavery, to set up a free republic in an unpopulated land, to bring
Christianity and civilization to African tribes, or to steal the
land of blacks and force them into subjugation.
   Stories about life on the trek, battles, and religious faith have
taken on mythical proportions in the folklore of Afrikaners, the
descendants of the pioneers who now dominate the government.
   The 100th anniversary commemoration in 1938 united Afrikaners,
gave impetus to their cultural and political organizations and
propelled them to power in the Nationalist Party parliamentary
victory 10 years later.
   The right-wingers regard the gradual and limited reforms of
apartheid now being made by today's Nationalist government as a
betrayal of white rights. They hope this year's celebration will be
a catalyst leading to the ouster of the Nationalists and victory for
the Conservative Party and its allies.
   A speech by President P.W. Botha to crowds of picnickers at the
Pioneer Monument will be broadcast live on national television.
   The celebrations are the culmination of a four-month re-enactment
of the Great Trek by wagons and oxen that converged on Pretoria this
week.
   Twenty miles away in Donkerhoek, the opposition Conservative
Party, its supporters and right-wing groups such as the Nazi-style
Afrikaner Reform Movement will be carrying on a more traditional
celebration.
   The right-wingers will dress in 19th-century clothes, listen to
poetry and history readings and hold square-dances and sing-a-longs.
   The Day of the Vow, Dec. 16, is considered a sacred national
holiday.
   It commemorates the 1838 battle at Blood River in Zululand when
one of the pioneer groups vowed to keep the day forever holy if they
won the battle against the Zulu King Dingaan the next morning. They
did.
   Most of South Africa's black majority of 26 million, who have no
vote in national affairs, do not celebrate the holiday, although
they don't work on the day because the country virtually closes down.
   A few blacks have participated in the government-sponsored
re-enactment as oxen drivers. But the right-wingers have no blacks
in their festivities.
   A coalition of anti-apartheid groups said it would celebrate the
day from the view of the losing side in the battle. Blacks,
celebrating what they call Heroes Day, will meet in the tribal
homeland of KaNgwane to pay homage to the chiefs who fought the
whites in the 18th and 19th centuries.

   Levetico Diwa, a 51-year-old
grandfather, crawled through the brush with his rifle, training to
fight communists because he believes they routinely kill old and
unproductive people.
   Diwa is one of 150,000 volunteers the military hopes to recruit
into a new militia it describes as essential to defeat communist
rebels. Critics fear a new paramilitary will increase human rights
abuses against civilians.
   Military plans call for the Citizens' Armed Forces Geographical
Unit to consolidate under one banner hundreds of paramilitary and
anti-communist vigilante groups to protect villages against the
communist New People's Army. This will help extend government
control and curb rights abuses, officials say.
   In a report today, the London-based group Amnesty International
said legal safeguards are being ignored and that it has documented
evidence of torture and illegal detentions by police, soldiers and
paramilitary forces.
   Human rights groups in the Philippines and political commentators
also question the wisdom of arming thousands more civilians.
   ``The trend toward militarization makes people think the only way
to contend with our problems is through a military solution,'' said
one prominent human rights activist, Mariss Diokno. ``We did not
expect that the vigilante groups would be dismantled and be replaced
by another group.''
   But officers training Diwa and more than 80 other volunteers on
the Bataan Peninsula, 30 miles west of Manila, claim the new unit is
different.
   Diwa and the other recruits are lectured on the human rights that
are guaranteed by the constitution. Regular and non-commissioned
officers will command the new units to ensure they follow
regulations, officials said.
   Like Diwa, most of the volunteers at the makeshift camp in Liang
were peasant farmers aged 18 to 55. Diwa said in an interview that
he joined because he believes that under communism, ``if you are old
and unproductive, then they will kill you.'' He said this notion has
been reinforced by military officers' lectures on the ``evils of
communism.''
   At the camp, trainees undergo a five-week crash course including
weapons training, basic infantry tactics, self-defense and first aid.
   After graduating, paramilitary troops move to villages where they
live with the people, defend them and gather information on rebels
for the army. They get 90 cents a day plus clothing, medical care,
housing and firearms.
   The army ``does not have sufficient manpower to ensure the
security of every village,'' Col. Ramsey Ocampo, constabulary
commander for Bataan, said in a recent interview. Regular troops
will clear areas of rebels and the paramilitary will follow to
maintain government control, he said.
   The government says rebels virtually control 7,800 of the
country's 40,832 villages. ``It just depends on who gets there
first,'' said a communist political officer who spoke on condition
of anonymity. He said the paramilitary would be most effective in
areas that have not been infiltrated.
   Fears about the new unit stem from the Civilian Home Defense
Force, a paramilitary force that was established by former President
Ferdinand Marcos and that became notorious for rights abuses.
   President Corazon Aquino, who replaced Marcos after a
military-civilian uprising, promised to disband that force during
her 1986 election campaign and now says it will be phased out as the
new paramilitary unit is deployed.
   But military officers admit privately that they often turn to
paramilitary veterans to find enough recruits for the new unit.
   Abelardo Torno, a trainee in Pampanga province, said he has
belonged to anti-communist militias since the 1960s, including 17
years in the Home Defense Force. ``All they did was change the
name,'' said an officer who stood nearby.

<HEAD>Quayle Was Bored In House, Feisty In Senate, Book Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Dan Quayle was so bored in the House of
Representatives that he missed committee meetings to play golf or
work out, earning the nickname of ``wet head'' because he was always
coming out of the gym, according to a new book on the vice
president-elect.
   However, the book, by political scientist Richard F. Fenno Jr.,
says Quayle quickly matured when he moved to the Senate in 1980 and
risked alienating the Republican administration to engineer passage
of an important bipartisan job training bill.
   The freshman Republican senator was so irritated at roadblocks to
the bill thrown up by Labor Department officials and then-Secretary
Raymond Donovan that he referred to them as ``the bastards,'' the
book says.
   ``The Making of a Senator: Dan Quayle'' is a six-year study by
Fenno of Quayle's political career and his chief legislative
accomplishment, the Job Training Partnership Act of 1982. It is
published by Congressional Quarterly.
   Quayle's office said Wednesday there would be no comment on the
book.
   The senator told the author he was ``very bored in the House,''
where he served from 1976 to 1980. He missed meetings and votes and
would ``sneak off to play golf'' or work out, one unidentified
associate is quoted as saying.
   ``People called him `wet head' because he was always coming out
of the (House) gym,'' the associate said.
   ``It's an awful job _ especially being a Republican there. You
can't get anything done,'' Quayle said.
   But when he was elected to the Senate in 1980, as Republicans
captured the majority there, Quayle was able to get a Labor and
Human Resources subcommittee chairmanship and drew the task of
drafting legislation to replace the Comprehensive Employment and
Training Act.
   His work on the bill with Edward Kennedy of Massachusetts, the
ranking Democrat on the committee, angered the administration, which
wanted to frame its own proposal. Although the Quayle-Kennedy bill
eventually prevailed, tension between Quayle and the Labor
Department was such that the senator told the author: ``They ought
to be hung _ the bastards.''
   Contrary to custom, no members of Congress were invited to the
bill-signing ceremony. And when Quayle later asked to have his
picture taken with the president and to have his wife and children
accompany him, he was told that the senator could come to the White
House unannounced, through the side gate and with no family members.

<HEAD>US Starts Talking To PLO</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BARRY SCHWEID</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Reagan said today he would not
hesitate to ``break off communications'' with the Palestine
Liberation Organization if it reneged on its declarations to
renounce terrorism and accept Israel's right to exist.
   Reagan defended his decision to permit a dialogue between U.S.
officials and Yasser Arafat's PLO, reversing a 12-year U.S.
government policy, telling reporters that ``words have been spoken''
that spelled out the PLO's acceptance of U.S. conditions for direct
talks.
   The president also said that he didn't think Israel had any
reason to be upset by the U.S. decision because ``we have made it
very plain that we have not retreated one inch from our position of
guaranteeing the safety'' of the Jewish state.
   The president talked to reporters twice, during picture-taking
sessions in the Oval Office with Turkish Prime Minister Turgut Ozal
and later with Italian Prime Minister Ciriaco de Mita. He spoke
after U.S. officials quickly followed through on the reversal of the
longstanding policy against talks with the PLO, seeking an early
meeting.
   A senior State Department official said he hoped that would lead
to direct Arab-Israeli peace talks.
   President-elect George Bush said today he supported the
president's decision. He added:
   ``I haven't spelled out any hopes about it. Arafat met the
conditions of the United States and we will go forward with a
dialogue, not negotiations, but a dialogue. ... Let's see how things
evolve.''
   As for the discussions, he said, ``There's no game plan; there's
no five-point program.''
   Asked if he would prefer that the talks wait until his
administration starts next month, Bush replied, ``I am vice
president of the United States. I become president on Jan. 20. On
Jan. 21, I'll tell you what I want to do.''
   Reagan said the administration made its move after it became
satisfied that PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat, in a news conference in
Geneva Wednesday, had complied with the American conditions for a
dialogue with his organization.
   Asked today to explain the policy reversal, Reagan replied,
``Well, because the words have been spoken, and the words were the
words that we have been stating were necessary.''
   But he quickly added that ``of course, ... the words must be
matched by performance, and if they're not, why, we're back where we
started.'' Asked a short time later what he would do if the PLO
failed to live up to its statements, the president replied, ``Well,
we'd certainly break off communications.''
   Asked if such direct U.S.-PLO contacts could achieve anything in
view of opposition by the Israeli government, he said ``the ultimate
solution does not depend on outsiders or us. Peace must be brought
about by the involved nations meeting with each other and settling
their differences.''
   Asked why the United States does not recognize a Palestinian
state, Reagan said, ``Well, because there is no such thing as of
now. There isn't a Palestinian state. And if you recognize someone
... as that, it would be us declaring who was in charge there.''
   Reagan said the move was ``just another step in what we've been
trying for eight years _ to bring about peace in the Middle East.''
   The U.S. ambassador to Tunisia, Robert H. Pelletreau Jr., who was
assigned to open the historic ``substantive dialogue'' with the PLO,
called the director general of the political section at the PLO's
Tunis headquarters to try to make arrangements for the talks, a U.S.
official said.
   While no date was set, ``we're sure the PLO will try hard to have
them take place as soon as possible, '' said the official, who spoke
on condition of anonymity.
   ``But right now, the time, the place and the level have not been
set,'' he said.
   Another U.S. official said the session could be held as early as
tomorrow, and certainly within the next few days.
   He said Tunis was the logical site and he doubted that a senior
PLO official would participate at this stage.
   So far as the topics, the official, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, said ``we have our agenda of things to talk to the PLO
about. First among them is the issue of terrorism. And how you get
to peace negotiations.''
   On Capitol Hill:
   _Sen. George Mitchell, the newly elected Senate majority leader,
welcomed the U.S. move as a ``significant step toward advancing the
peace process.''
   The Maine senator said that Arafat's acceptance of Israel's right
to exist and renouncement of terrorism were ``important statements''
but that ``in light of the PLO's record ... must be viewed with
caution.''
   _The current majority leader, Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., praised the
decision to open a dialogue with the PLO, calling the organization's
new position ``an opportunity that must be pushed forward despite
the risks.''
   ``Our commitment to Israel is firm and unswerving,'' he said in a
written statement. ``But it must be tempered by the realization that
there are times when we must take those first tenuous steps toward
peace.''
   _House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Dante Fascell, D-Fla.,
sought to reassure Israel, saying that continued aid to Israel, the
top recipient of U.S. assistance, is necessary both to calm Israeli
fears and ``as a clear signal to the PLO and other parties that the
United States is committed firmly to the independence of Israel
within secure borders.''
   The announcement Wednesday night left Israel in diplomatic
isolation and came just a few hours after Bush had taken a tough
line against the PLO, declaring that it had not met U.S. conditions
for direct dealings.
   But Reagan and Secretary of State George P. Shultz said that
Arafat, in statements made in Geneva about the same time that Bush
was speaking, had met the U.S. conditions for a ``substantive
dialogue'' _ a form of diplomatic acceptance long sought by the
Palestinian group.
   Only a day earlier, the State Department had said Arafat failed
to meet the U.S. conditions. And less than three weeks ago, Shultz
had accused the PLO of terrorism and said Arafat was ``an accessory
to such terrorism.''
   Shultz, asked Wednesday if he had changed his mind on that
subject, said the PLO had issued a statement Wednesday that ``was
clear; it was not encumbered.''
   He said Arafat's group had accepted U.N. Security Council
resolutions 242 and 338, recognized Israel's right to exist in peace
and security, and renounced terrorism.
   ``As a result,'' Shultz said, ``the United States is prepared for
a substantive dialogue with PLO representatives.''
   Bush just a few hours earlier had demanded that the PLO satisfy
U.S. demands.
   ``I want a clear statement on renunciation of terror,'' Bush
said. ``I want a very clear, unambiguous statement on the right of
Israel to exist as a state, and I want a clear endorsement of
Security Council resolution 242.''
   The U.N. resolutions, adopted in 1967 and 1973, affirm the right
of all states in the Middle East to live in peace. Israel is not
specifically mentioned.

   Lyndon LaRouche's fraud conspiracy trial
went to the jury today for a verdict on whether he schemed to cheat
tax collectors and lenders who supported his controversial causes.
   After final closing arguments by defense lawyers and a rebuttal
by government prosecutors, Chief U.S. District Judge Albert V. Bryan
Jr. sent the case to the jury of eight women and four men who heard
testimony during the 15-day trial.
   Bryan said the jurors will deliberate Saturday if necessary to
reach a verdict.
   LaRouche, the 66-year-old political maverick and perennial
minor-party presidential candidate, did not testify in his own
defense.
   Defense lawyer Michael Reilly said LaRouche fund-raisers
solicited loans with good faith assurances that they would be
repaid, but Assistant U.S. Attorney Kent Robinson said all the
defendants knew the terms of the loans could not be honored.
   Robinson told the jurors in the government's rebuttal that
supporters who loaned money to the LaRouche movement ``weren't the
lifeblood of this organization, these supporters were bled dry.''
   ``The organization treated these people with cynicism and
disregard'' because everyone knew that the LaRouche organization was
``a bankruptcy waiting to happen,'' he said.
   The result, Robinson said, was ``an enormous crime _ a $30
million crime.''
   Bryan cautioned the jurors in his instructions that LaRouche's
political goals were irrelevant to the case, and Robinson insisted
that the government was not trying to ``get at Lyndon LaRouche or
quiet a political movement.''
   LaRouche's political movement embraces a number of unorthodox
positions and relies heavily on conspiracy theories to explain world
events. It has alleged that figures such as Henry Kissinger and
Queen Elizabeth participate in those conspiracies. Larouche backers
also have advocated a quarantine for AIDS victims.
   A half-dozen defense attorneys heaped abuse on the government's
case against LaRouche and six associates as ``garbage'' and a
``rotting carcass'' during closing arguments Tuesday.
   But prosecutors said they had proved that the defendants had
conspired to defraud LaRouche supporters by raising more than $30
million in loans without any intention of repaying them.
   In addition, LaRouche is charged with conspiring to defraud the
Internal Revenue Service by having all his personal expenses paid by
various corporations he controls and pretending he had no taxable
income.
   If convicted on all 13 counts against him, LaRouche faces a
maximum penalty of 65 years in prison and fines totaling $3.25
million. LaRouche and his aides deny any wrongdoing.
   Prosecutor John Markham said the government's case had nothing to
do with LaRouche's political beliefs but focused on allegedly
deceptive fund-raising practices.
   ``The ends, however noble they may be ... do not justify lying to
people to get their money,'' Markham declared.
   He said LaRouche's lenders were ``burned by a group of people who
think they are better, and can use the money better, than anyone
else.''
   But LaRouche attorney Odin Anderson of Boston said the
government's case was based on ``voodoo conspiracy'' charges that
were vague and unfounded.
   ``They don't want you to decide straightforward facts,'' Anderson
told the jurors. ``They want you to decide garbage.''
   Anderson said the ``bad smell'' that sometimes wafted through the
courtroom ``came from the rotting carcass of the government's case.''
   At one point, the judge admonished defense lawyer Brian Gettings
for shouting at the jury during an especially impassioned closing
argument.
   Hunched over, his arms flailing and his fingers waggling,
Gettings branded as ``liars'' two crucial government witnesses _
both former employees of the LaRouche organization _ who he said
were ``openly, vehemently hostile to every defendant in this case.''
   Gettings said the defendants had simply borrowed too much money
and were unable to repay loans because of government harassment and
media attacks that shrank their revenues.
   LaRouche and his fund-raisers weren't trying to line their
pockets like classic fraud defendants, Gettings said. ``If you don't
find greed, it's impossible to find fraud,'' he said.
   Defense lawyer James Clark said the LaRouche case wasn't about
money but ``about a political movement with dedicated followers who
want it to succeed and powerful enemies who want it to fail.''
   Anderson claimed the FBI actually wrote the letter that an
elderly Connecticut woman sent to LaRouche demanding the return of
her loan money. Anderson said the letter was an FBI ``entrapment''
attempt against LaRouche.

   Millionaire Victor Posner has ordered up a free
snowstorm to whip up some traditional Christmas spirit among Miami's
palm trees and balmy winds.
   The Miami Beach industrialist on Wednesday volunteered to cover
the $2,500 cost of creating a 35-ton pile of snow for Miami's annual
Snow Day on Dec. 20.
   Posner said he learned that Royal Palm City Ice was charging the
city for use of a blower and ice to make the blizzard.
   ``Give them the ice, give them the machine. Who cares?'' said
Posner, who is estimated to be worth more than $100 million. ``I
give away millions of dollars a year. This is picayune, pennies.
They are not getting a bill.''
   Last February, Posner paid a $7 million fine, including $3
million to aid Miami's homeless, in a tax evasion case.

   President-elect George Bush said today he
supports President Reagan's decision to begin talks with the
Palestine Liberation Organization, but he cautioned, ``Let's see how
things evolve ... there's no game plan.''
   Bush said Wednesday that PLO leader Yasser Arafat had made ``some
movement'' in a speech Tuesday but not enough to warrant direct
dealings with the PLO by the United States. Later, however, after
administration officials went over new Arafat comments on Israel and
the Middle East, Reagan said the United States would enter into ``a
substantive dialogue'' with the PLO.
   ``The conditions that the American government set out have been
consistent, steadfast and now Mr. Arafat says that those conditions
are met,'' Bush said today. ``So we will observe, we will watch and
our ambassador in Tunisia will begin a dialogue. There's no game
plan, there's no five-point program.''
   Asked if he preferred that the talks wait until he takes office
next month, Bush replied, ``I am vice president of the United
States. I become president on Jan. 20. On Jan. 21 I'll tell you what
I want to do.''
   ``I support the president's decision. Let's see how things
evolve. My position remains the same. I want to see direct talks
between, for example, between King Hussein of Jordan and the
Israelis,'' Bush said.
   One day earlier, Bush took another step in forming his new
administration, naming his choice for agriculture secretary. He also
said John Tower could be an outstanding secretary of defense and he
doubted that an FBI check had turned up anything to disqualify the
former Texas senator.
   Bush said he has not yet decided who will run the Pentagon,
although sources said Tower remained the leading candidate.
   With eight more appointments to go, Bush hopes to complete naming
his Cabinet before Christmas.
   Bush tapped Clayton Yeutter on Wednesday as the sixth member of
his Cabinet. Yeutter, the U.S. trade representative for President
Reagan, will be secretary of agriculture.
   After three years in government, Yeutter had wanted to return to
private business. Standing alongside Bush at a news conference,
Yeutter said there were ``only a few people in the world who could
convince me to carry forward in another stint in government, but
you're one of those few.''
   Bush also said he would name a black to his Cabinet. He has been
urged by some black supporters to name Louis W. Sullivan, a black
who is president of Morehouse School of Medicine, as secretary of
Health and Human Services.
   In addition, The Washington Post reported in today's editions
that another black, Julius W. Becton Jr., a retired three-star Army
general who heads the Federal Emergency Management Agency, is the
top contender to head the Veterans Administration, and that a
Hispanic member of the Federal Communications Commission, Patricia
Diaz Dennis, is a candidate to head the Labor Department.
   Also, an aide to Sen. Lowell P. Weicker Jr., who lost his
re-election bid last month, confirmed that the senator has met with
Bush about possibly taking over the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration.
   Covering a wide range of topics at the news conference, Bush also:
   _Hinted his administration will seek a delay in February's
resumption of arms control talks with the Soviet Union. ``There is
no way that we are going to have by Feb. 15 or 16 a detailed
point-by-point program on arms talks,'' Bush said.
   _Said Vice President-elect Dan Quayle's role would be ``very much
like the Reagan-Bush relationship.'' He said Quayle would be a ``key
player'' in national security affairs if he wants to be and that
there may be specific assignments in other areas.
   _Said he would not seek substantial cuts in existing farm
programs but didn't say what he meant by substantial. ``I do not
believe we will balance the budget eventually on the backs of
farmers,'' he said.
   Yeutter, 58, a onetime Nebraska farmer, was the fifth veteran of
the Reagan administration to join Bush's incoming Cabinet.
   Asked how Yeutter's selection squared with his promise to bring a
new team of people to Washington, Bush said, ``Well, his face is
familiar, but the job is very different than being trade
representative.''
   He promised anew to bring in some unfamiliar faces.
   However, Tower is a familiar figure, a onetime senator from Texas
who was an arms negotiator in Geneva for Reagan. Even before the end
of the presidential campaign, Tower was at the top of Bush's list to
run the Pentagon, but his appointment has been delayed by an
extensive background check of his dealings with defense contractors
and aspects of his personal life.

   The national peanut marketing quota for 1989
will be 1.44 million tons, up 37,800 tons from last year's quota,
the Agriculture Department said Thursday.
   Officials said the quota for 1989 was unchanged from the level
proposed last month. By law, USDA is required to announce a final
decision on the proposed quota by Dec. 15.
   The national quota is required by law to be equal to the
estimated quantity of peanuts that will be needed for domestic
edible, seed and related uses in the 1989-90 marketing year, which
will begin Aug. 1, 1989. The quota cannot be less than 1.1 million
tons.
   Officials said the 1989 poundage quota will be allocated to each
producing state based on the state's share of the 1988 quota.
Increases in a state's quota will be allocated among qualifying
peanut farms.
   Peanut farmers voted in a referendum in January 1986 to continue
the quota for crops through 1990.

<DATELINE>OTTAWA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today ruled against a Quebec law
forbidding languages other than French on commercial signs.
   The court's unanimous 5-0 ruling allows Quebec to order French on
signs but cannot prevent other languages from being used as well.
   Quebec's premier, Robert Bourassa, is expected to announce his
decision Sunday on how the provincial government will comply with
the ruling.
   The language law was passed in 1977 when the separatist Parti
Quebecois held power. Bourassa's Liberal Party platform has
supported multilingual signs.
   The court found that the law requiring commercial signs only in
French violated the guarantees of freedom of expression provided in
the Quebec charter.
   Constitutional lawyers interpreted the ruling as meaning that
Bourassa should be able to find some kind of compromise on the issue.
   ``The judgment makes it consistent with civil liberties,'' lawyer
Julius Grey said in a live interview with the Canadian Broadcasting
Corp.
   A majority of Quebec residents speak French as a first language.
Two separate cases by English-speaking residents challenged the law.

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A black alderman dropped out of the race for mayor
Thursday, warning of a return to ``machine politics'' unless blacks
can agree upon a candidate to oppose the son of the late Mayor
Richard J. Daley.
   In announcing his withdrawal, Alderman Danny Davis predicted Cook
County State's Attorney Richard M. Daley, son of the legendary
political boss, would ``without a doubt'' win the April 4 mayor's
race unless either Alderman Timothy Evans or Mayor Eugene Sawyer,
both of whom are black, drop out of the race.
   Davis gave his support to Evans, who was the leading black
candidate in a recent newspaper poll.
   Daley is considered the front-runner, based on recent polls.
Sawyer, Evans and Daley square off in a Feb. 28 Democratic primary.
   A Daley administration, according to Davis, would be a
``reinstitution of what we call plantation politics in many areas of
Chicago. Feudal system politics ... where clout becomes the passport
to city services, clout becomes the passport to jobs, clout becomes
the passport to benefits.''
   David Wilhelm, Daley's campaign manager, called Davis' comments
``unfortunate,'' and said, ``they're talking about the past. Our
campaign is focused on the future.''
   Sawyer, elected mayor by the City Council after the death last
November of Harold Washington, has raised more than $2 million for
his campaign. But Davis said he never considered endorsing Sawyer.
   ``The Evans support comes from the progressive, the activist base
group of the coalition that generated and sustained the Washington
era,'' Davis said. ``So I would have a much greater feeling that
machine influence would not play nearly as much of a role in an
Evans administration as it would in a Sawyer administration.''
   A Chicago Tribune poll taken Dec. 2-5 of 1,038 registered voters
indicated that of 12 declared or potential candidates, Daley was the
choice of 29 percent. Evans had 17 percent, Sawyer had 10 percent
and Jesse Jackson, who is not a candidate, had 10 percent.
   In that poll, which had an error range of 3 percentage points,
Davis received 3 percent of the votes.
   Winning the Democratic primary generally has been tantamount to
winning the general election in Chicago's recent history. That
changed somewhat in 1983 when Republican Bernard Epton made a strong
showing in a losing effort against Washington.

<TEXT>
   Police found the naked body of a 4-year-old girl in
a campground near Tokyo on Thursday, the first confirmed death in a
series of crimes against children that have traumatized the city's
suburbs.
   A 7-year-old girl and another 4-year-old remain missing in
Saitama prefecture west of Tokyo in a series of disappearances that
began in August.
   Six times since October, children at play have been stabbed by
strangers in Saitama and in Chiba prefecture, east of the capital.
None of the stabbing victims, ranging in age from 2 to 4, was
fatally injured.
   Police said they are treating the incidents as cases of sexual
perversion.
   The stabbings and abductions of toddlers by unidentified stalkers
have caused panic in the normally placid suburbs. In a country that
prides itself on a low crime rate, the crimes also have attracted
the nation's attention.
   ``I never thought a thing like this could happen here,'' a
housewife told the Japan Broadcasting Corp. the night before Erika
Namba's naked body was found in a campground 20 miles from her home.
``We moved here because we thought this would be a good place to
raise children.''
   Police searched the campground after officials there reported
finding articles of clothing with Erika's name on them.
   In the middle-class developments where the missing girls lived,
hundreds of office workers and high school students have joined
police in fruitless searches of playgrounds and nearby scrubland.
   Housewives have posted fliers bearing likenesses of the girls,
all of whom disappeared in the bustling neighborhoods in the
afternoon hours after school let out and before darkness fell.
   Police helicopters and patrol cars have broadcast warnings urging
children to get home before dark, and school principals have
admonished pupils to avoid strangers and see each other home.
   But despite a combined turnout of almost 6,000 police officers in
Chiba and a similar number in Saitama, police report no arrests and
few leads.
   On Wednesday, they released a drawing _ based on another child's
description _ of a man seen with Erika shortly before she
disappeared. It showed a face covered by sunglasses and a gauze mask.
   ``Little children don't have large vocabularies,'' said Koji
Tateishi, an assistant inspector with the Chiba Prefectural Police.
In the stabbings, ``what happens to them happens in a flash. They
can't really tell us about it.''
   ``We're treating these as cases of sexual perversion,'' he said.
   Since Erika was reported missing on Friday and 3-year-old Sachiyo
Abe was stabbed in the stomach on a quiet street in Chiba a day
later, coverage on nightly news programs and in nationwide
newspapers has intensified to a level unseen since the kidnap-murder
of a small boy in September 1987.
   The country followed nightly news reports on the ordeal of
5-year-old Yoshiaki Ogiwara. The reports described his abduction
near his home, anonymous calls demanding a 20 million yen ransom
(then $140,000) from his fireman father, and the discovery of the
boy's body in a ravine two days later.
   Outraged media commentators then spoke of the unraveling of
Japanese society and waning confidence in a formidable police force
that boasted a 1987 record of arrests in 62.6 percent of all
reported non-traffic crimes, compared with 20.7 percent in the
United States.
   Despite a perceived increase in crimes against children, overall
crime in Japan actually declined 0.2 percent in 1987.
   But in the Chiba section where Sachiyo Abe was stabbed, fear has
curtailed late-afternoon activity at the neighborhood park,
housewife Chisato Shiba said.
   She continues to take her 15-month-old son outside to play, but
``even more than before, I make it a point to watch him very
closely,'' she said. ``The thing is, there's really no way to
prevent these things.''

   A man convicted of murdering his wife 33
years ago will not get a pardon hearing even though another man
confessed to the slaying before his death last summer, the Nebraska
Board of Pardons ruled today.
   Attorney General Robert Spire, one of three members of the board,
said Darrel Parker can explore other avenues, but he declined to
elaborate. The ruling was unanimous.
   Spire said the board can consider Parker's request for a pardon
only if there is a ``clear miscarriage of justice.'' The board,
Spire said, ``is not a court, not a super appeals board.''
   Parker, 57, former parks supervisor in Moline, Ill., served 13
years in prison for the 1955 murder of his wife, Nancy. An appeals
court overturned his conviction on the ground that police had
coerced a confession, but prosecutors did not retry him, and he was
paroled in 1969.
   Another convicted murderer, Wesley Peery, had meanwhile told his
lawyers that he killed Mrs. Parker, giving them intimate details of
the killing, but made them promise not to reveal his confession
until after his death.
   The lawyers, Stanley Cohen and Toney Redman, came forward after
Peery, 63, died of a heart attack on death row in July.
   Parker's lawyer, Richard Bruckner, said Parker told him all he
wanted ``is a piece of paper _ a complete pardon finally clearing my
name.'' Bruckner did not attend today's board hearing and had no
immediate comment on the ruling.
   Secretary of State Allen Beermann, another member of the pardon
board, said Parker could seek a new trial.
   The pardon board, which also includes Gov. Kay Orr, was given a
sealed transcript of Peery's admission and considered Parker's
request for a pardon hearing a day after the 33rd anniversary of
Mrs. Parker's death.
   Peery's confession was among two years of taped and written
interviews he gave to Cohen and Redman in the hope a book would be
written about his exploits. He boasted of killing 12 people over
four decades.

   Hurricane-force winds wreaked havoc across
northern California today, overturning trucks, toppling trees onto
homes, tearing boats from their moorings and cutting power to more
than 300,000 customers.
   No serious injuries were reported.
   The arrival of the aircraft carrier USS Carl Vinson at the
Alameda Naval Air Station after a six-month tour of duty was delayed
until late afternoon for fear that the morning gusts might push the
huge warship off course, officials said.
   Several big-rig trucks that had stopped along the 10-mile
Altamont Pass 40 miles southeast of here were blown over, said a
Highway Patrol spokesman.
   The winds, clocked at up to 102 mph in areas, left boats adrift
along Richardson Bay and San Francisco Bay, said the Coast Guard.
Winds howled through the waterfront, leaving heaps of debris, signs
and odd hunks of metal in the streets.
   Homes throughout northern California were plunged into the dark
early today. Pacific Gas & Electric Co. said about 302,000 customers
lost power for varying amounts of time. The number without power by
mid-morning was not immediately known.
   The winds tilted a barge near the Richmond-San Rafael Bridge and
it dumped its load of rocks near one of the span's towers, the Coast
Guard said. The bridge was not damaged.
   Winds were clocked at 102 mph atop Mount Diablo 40 miles east of
San Francisco, said meteorologist Mike Pechner. Hurricane-force
winds are 74 mph or greater.

<HEAD>Random Drug Tests Of Secrets Handlers Argued</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The government does not need evidence of drug
abuse to justify random tests of federal officials with access to
classified information, the Justice Department told an appeals court
Thursday.
   Deterrence of drug use among officials in a position to
compromise secrets is justification enough to randomly test them,
Assistant Attorney General John H. Bolton said.
   ``The United States is permitted as an employer to make
reasonable steps to prevent something from becoming a problem,''
Bolton said, challenging a lower court's ban on random testing of
4,700 Justice Department officials.
   ``There are enormous national security interests at stake here,''
Bolton told a three-judge panel of the U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals. The lower court's ruling stopped the drug-testing program
from being implemented last summer.
   ``This is a case about protecting the integrity of those who
represent the United States in court,'' Bolton said. ``It's a case
about protecting national security, safeguarding grand jury secrecy
and preserving the efficacy of criminal prosecution.''
   ``The context is a fitness-for-duty test by a public employer,''
Bolton said of the program that is being challenged by employees who
obtained a permanent injunction barring the tests from U.S. District
Judge George Revercomb.
   Former Maryland attorney general Stephen H. Sachs urged the panel
to uphold Revercomb's finding that testing without any suspicion of
drug use by the individual is an unconstitutional invasion of
privacy.
   Sachs said the appeals court was ``mandated to weigh and to
balance'' the government's interest in testing with the individual
employee's constitutional rights to privacy.
   In doing so, the court must ask: ``Is there a demonstrable
existence of a problem?'' he said.
   The Justice Department has failed to provide ``some kind of data
that supports the reasonableness'' of the search, and ``That is the
core command of the Fourth Amendment,'' said Sachs, who was once
U.S. attorney in Baltimore.
   The employees don't dispute the need to preserve the department's
integrity or protect secrets, Sachs said. ``The question is `how may
the department go about enforcing and imposing those accepted
requirements?'''
   ``The department has plenty of ways _ observation of supervisors,
background checks, all the less intrusive ways _ to check up on its
employees,'' Sachs said.
   But Bolton argued that the issue was not evidence of drug use but
the types of secrets the employees handled.
   Justice Department employees have access to some of the nation's
most closely held secrets, such as information about
counter-intelligence and defense programs, such as the stealth
bomber.
   ``Stealth technology is something that the KGB would crawl over
hot coals to get its hands on,'' Bolton said.
   But his argument seemed to trouble Chief Judge Patricia Wald, who
questioned when those national security concerns would justify an
intrusive search.
   ``The strongest part of your case is the government's interest,''
Wald told Bolton. ``It's the other side of the equation, what can
trigger this type of testing that bothers me the most.''
   There's ``no question we are living in a high-risk society. The
question is how far can we go in deterring large risks ... in terms
of our constitutional rights,'' Wald said.
   Bolton argued that Justice Department employees already waived
privacy rights when they submitted to extensive FBI background
checks and medical examinations.
   Circuit Judge Laurence Silberman, taking up an argument advanced
by Bolton, suggested that requiring evidence of drug use would mean
the government would have to stop testing once it had successfully
deterred narcotics abuse among a group of employees.
   ``The implications of that argument are awful,'' Sachs said.
   The government ``could suspend the Constitution'' if deterrence
were allowed to be the sole justification for drug testing, he said.
   Both sides urged the court to decide the case without waiting for
a ruling by the Supreme Court on two other cases involving drug
testing. The high court is reviewing testing of U.S. Customs Service
agents seeking promotion and railway crews involved in accidents.
   Circuit Judge Spottswood Robinson III also sat on the panel,
which gave no indication when it would rule.

<HEAD>Judge In Steinberg Trial May Give `Accomplice' Instructions</HEAD>

   The judge in Joel Steinberg's murder trial will
probably tell the jury that his live-in lover was an accomplice in
the death of the girl they raised, a move that could undermine her
testimony, according to a source.
   Hedda Nussbaum's testimony is central to the case against
Steinberg, who is accused in the 1987 fatal beating of 6-year-old
Lisa Steinberg.
   The source, who is involved in the case and spoke on the
condition of anonymity, said Wednesday that state Supreme Court
Justice Harold Rothwax probably will tell the jury to consider Ms.
Nussbaum an accomplice.
   Depending on how the judge phrases the instruction, it could mean
the jury will not be permitted to use her testimony to convict
Steinberg unless there is corroborating evidence.
   Today's session was delayed, however, when Rothwax was hit by a
car and suffered two broken wrists as he rode his bike to court,
police said.
   If Rothwax tells the six men and six women to consider her an
accomplice ``as a matter of fact,'' he lets them decide whether her
actions or inaction contributed to the child's death. If the jurors
decide she contributed to the death, then her testimony must be
supported by other evidence.
   If the judge instructs them that Ms. Nussbaum was an accomplice
as a ``matter of law,'' then the panel has no choice and is obliged
to use Ms. Nussbaum's testimony only if it is supported by other
evidence or testimony.
   Steinberg, 47, is a disbarred lawyer charged in the death of the
girl he illegally obtained at birth from an unwed teen-ager. The
girl was removed from his Greenwich Village apartment and died in a
hospital three days later of a head injury.
   Steinberg has denied hitting the girl, but Ms. Nussbaum said
Steinberg told her the night Lisa was fatally injured that he had
``knocked Lisa down and she didn't want to get up.''
   Ms. Nussbaum testified that Steinberg then went to dinner with a
friend. She said that during the three hours that he was out, she
did nothing to help the child.
   Medical experts testified that Lisa could probably have been
saved if help had been summoned earlier.
   Ms. Nussbaum originally was charged with murder. Prosecutors
dropped charges on the ground that she had been so beaten down
physically and mentally by Steinberg that she was unable to act. Ms.
Nussbaum agreed to testify against Steinberg.
   Ms. Nussbaum, 46, a former editor of children's books, spent
seven days on the witness stand recalling 12 brutal and bizarre
years with Steinberg.

<HEAD>Lawmaker Says Cooperation With Cuba on Drug Control Possible</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The chairman of the House Committee on
Narcotics Abuse and Control said Thursday that after a lengthy
conversation with Cuban President Fidel Castro he is convinced the
possibility exists to establish ``a new era of cooperation in
narcotics control.''
   Rep. Charles Rangel, D-N.Y., said his 3{-hour meeting with Castro
in Havana on Tuesday evening was ``extremely promising.''
   ``There is now the possibility of discussions towards
establishing direct Cuba-U.S. cooperation in narcotics
interdiction,'' as well as extending cooperation into other areas
such as eemergency search and rescue operations, Rangel said.
   ``It is time to depoliticize narcotics efforts with Cuba,''
Rangel said. He said the meeting with Castro signals the possibility
of ``opening a new era of cooperation in narcotics control.''
   Rangel commented in a statement issued by his office here. He and
others in a 12-member congressional delegation are touring Latin
America, with visits scheduled to the Dominican Republic, Guyana,
Trinidad and Tobago.
   Rangel said Castro told the delegation that Cuba wants to work
with the United States and Latin American countries ``and that
cooperation with the United States will naturally flow from this
involvement.''
   ``Castro said he recognizes that the problem is shared by the
region, and it needs to be addressed regionally,'' Rangel said.
   Currently there is no cooperation, officially or unofficially,
between Marxist Cuba and the United States on narcotics matters.
   Rangel said he had been told by State Department and Drug
Enforcement Administration officials that Cuban and U.S. law
enforcement agencies ``do not even share information on suspected
upcoming drug shipments.''
   ``This kind of nuts-and-bolts joint interdiction cooperation is
an example of what can be started right away,'' he said.

   Sonny Bono could come to be known as
the face that erased the budget deficit.
   It will take a lot of T-shirt sales at $13 a pop to wipe out the
city's $2.3 million deficit, but how many other places can fight
budget woes by peddling the mayor's likeness?
   So far, 1,100 admirers have sent in checks for the shirts bearing
either of two messages: ``I Want You Babe,'' or ``Meet Me in Palm
Springs,'' city officials said.
   The shirts have helped the city raise $7,500 toward erasing
budget woes, city spokeswoman Ann Erdman said.
   The 53-year-old Bono, who owns Bono's restaurant in this desert
resort, 110 miles east of Los Angeles, was elected mayor April 12, a
day after ex-wife and ex-singing partner Cher won an Academy Award
for her performance in the movie ``Moonstruck.''

   Academy Award-winning actress Greer Garson says the
groundbreaking ceremony for a new hospital unit was interrupted by
laughter because, ``I forgot my lines.''
   The ceremony was Wednesday for the Fogelson Education Unit, named
in honor of her late husband, at Presbyterian Hospital.
   Ms. Garson and her husband, Col. E. E. ``Buddy'' Fogelson, a
Dallas oilman, lawyer and rancher, donated a $1 million challenge
grant to help in construction of the unit.
   Fogelson died in 1987 at the age of 87 after a lengthy battle
with Parkinson's disease.
   ``The center is not only for Buddy, but for the doctors who cared
for him,'' the actress said. The center is a tribute ``to the good
care afforded my husband and me during the past several years.''
   She dismissed the forgotten lines saying, ``Oh well. We'll have
to do it at the opening (of the unit).''
   Mrs. Garson moved to Dallas in 1949 after she married Fogelson.
She also maintains homes in California and New Mexico. She won the
Academy Award in 1942 for best actress for her performance in ``Mrs.
Miniver.''

   Bart Starr, a former University of
Alabama quarterback who guided the Green Bay Packers to five
National Football League championships, has won nearly $2.4 million
in a lawsuit.
   A federal court jury awarded Starr the damages Wednesday in his
lawsuit against a former business partner in an automobile
dealership.
   ``We are very grateful to the jury for their decision,'' Starr
said after leaving U.S. District Judge Sam Pointer's courtroom. ``It
has been a very emotional time for us.''
   Besides the stress of the 18-month lawsuit, Starr's son, Bret,
died this summer from an apparent drug overdose.
   The jury awarded $2,387,423 to Starr after finding that Thomas M.
Acheson, Starr's partner in the dealership, breached a 1972
agreement.
   Both sides have 10 days to file further motions. Acheson's
attorneys indicated they would file motions to set aside the verdict.
   ``I believe that the settlement asked for is totally out of line
and the verdict is not supportable,'' Acheson said in a statement.

   Country singer Johnny Cash is scheduled
to undergo open heart surgery Monday, joining close friend Waylon
Jennings, who is recovering from a similar procedure at the same
hospital.
   Cash, 56, was admitted Wednesday to Baptist Hospital after tests
were performed, doctors said.
   Reba Hancock, Cash's sister, said the tests showed there may be a
blockage.
   ``John had no chest pain,'' she said. ``He was just experiencing
a few problems, and went in for some tests.''
   In the 1960s, Cash overcame a 100-pill-a-day addiction, and he
was treated in 1984 for morphine abuse that he said he developed
while undergoing teatment and surgery for ulcers.
   Cash is known for his hit songs ``A Boy Named Sue,'' ``I Walk the
Line'' and ``Ring of Fire.''
   Already in Baptist Hospital is his pal Jennings, 51, who is
listed in stable condition after undergoing triple bypass heart
surgery Monday.
   Jennings, 51, was the narrator of the TV show ``The Dukes of
Hazzard'' and had a hit song by that name. His other hits include
``Mammas, Don't Let Your Babies Grow Up to Be Cowboys,'' a duet with
Willie Nelson.

<TEXT>
   The American decision to talk with the PLO
is the biggest step toward Middle East peace in a decade, but
radical Palestinians called Yasser Arafat a traitor Thursday and
said the bloodshed will continue.
   Arafat's renunciation of terrorism and recognition of Israel's
right to exist, coupled with the U.S. response after years of
shunning the Palestine Liberation Organization, is the most dramatic
development since Egypt signed a peace treaty with Israel in 1979.
   His move could be the turning point in the 40 years of
Arab-Israeli conflict, but it also is the PLO chairman's greatest
gamble and could explode in his face.
   Such radical Palestinian factions as the Abu Nidal group may
launch a new wave of terrorism intended to wreck the initiative.
Militants within the PLO have stayed their hands for the moment, but
many feel Arafat made too many concessions.
   The Popular Front for Liberation of Palestine, a Marxist group
that reconciled with Arafat last year after a four-year
estrangement, accused him of ``capitulation.''
   Its leader, George Habash, said in a statement sent to The
Associated Press in Nicosia from Damascus, Syria, that it welcomed
the U.S. decision but felt Washington acted only to ``end the
diplomatic isolation that followed its refusal to grant Chairman
Yasser Arafat a visa to go to New York.''
   ``Therefore, we urge our masses to keep up the struggle to force
Israel and the United States to recognize the state of Palestine and
all legitimate Palestinin rights,'' he said.
   After the United States refused Arafat a visa to address the U.N.
General Assembly in New York, the assembly moved its session to
Geneva.
   Saeed Mousa, who leads a Syrian-based breakaway faction called
Fatah-Uprising, said Arafat was ``a traitor ... for his surrenderist
concessions to the United States and the Israeli enemy.''
   A Mousa spokesman accused the PLO chairman later of paying ``an
exhorbitant price, the recognition of Israel, for this American
decision'' and declared: ``Arafat is not able to fulfill his
commitments, especially his commitment to give up the armed struggle
against Israel.''
   Mousa and other dissidents left the PLO in 1983 in a
Syrian-supported mutiny.
   Ahmed Jibril of the Popular Front for the Liberation of
Palestine-General Command, also backed by Syria, said in Damascus:
``Arafat has recognized (Israel) and offered four-fifths of the
Palestinian land to'' the Jewish state.
   ``By renouncing violence and terrorism, Arafat is condemning
anyone who uses the gun against the Israeli occupier,'' Jibril said.
``Arafat has offered Israel what he doesn't have. The land of
Palestine is not the property of any organization or any
individual.''
   Six weeks ago, West German authorities arrested 13 people
suspected of belonging to Jibril's group who said they were planning
terrorist attacks.
   The extremist Saiqa faction, whose name in Arabic means
``lightning,'' said in Damascus: ``We shall see to it that the PLO
gets back on its original revolutionary course of struggle.''
   Arafat and his lieutenants would be targets of the radicals,
along with Israelis and Americans.
   Since his first hints at moderation 15 years ago, Arafat has had
to fight not only the Israelis but Palestinian extremists and
hard-line Arab nations led by Syria. Hafez Assad, president of
Syria, has sought for years to gain control of the PLO.
   Gunmen working for Abu Nidal have killed a score of Arafat aides,
and the Israeli secret service has assassinated others. The last
victim of Israel was Khalil al-Wazir, the PLO chairman's right-hand
man, shot to death April 16 at his home in Tunis, according to
Israeli security sources.
   Last month, Arafat steered the PLO legislature to implicitly
recognizing Israel by accepting U.N. Security Council Resolutions
242 and 338 as the basis of an international Middle East peace
conference.
   The Palestine National Council also declared an independent
state, presumably to be located in the West Bank and Gaza Strip,
where Palestinians have been in revolt against Israeli occupation
for a year.
   Habash's guerrilla group and others went along with the
compromise at the Algiers meeting for the sake of unity, but Habash
said to Arafat:
   ``We're backing your efforts because this is what the majority
wants, but we don't believe moderation will pay. We can't wait
forever. If you fail, you have to come back to this council to say
so and we can then decide the future course.''

   The City Council has unanimously approved an
ordinance banning beepers in all public and private schools, a move
educators hope will put a dent in drug sales and prostitution.
   ``We know their mothers are not beeping them,'' Alderman Robert
Shaw said earlier at a committee meeting.
   School officials say students are often beeped in classrooms to
make drug deals or to engage in prostitution.
   ``We've got girls 11 years old. They get a call and they're out
of school to turn a trick,'' public schools security chief George
Sims said.
   The beeper ban was part of an omnibus ordinance approved by
aldermen Wednesday.
   School Superintendent Manford Byrd issued an executive order in
September banning the beepers, but Sims said the result was irate
parents who didn't like being called down to school because of the
infraction.
   The ordinance takes the issue out of the hands of school
administrators and gives it to the police. Violators are subject to
fines of $200 to $500.

   A city ordinance requiring handgun purchasers
to wait 15 days before picking up their weapons goes into effect
Friday.
   The law requires the wait between sale and receipt of a handgun
to allow police time to check whether the prospective buyer has a
criminal record or is mentally incompetent.
   Until now, guns could be picked up immediately and police had to
track the buyers down if there were reasons to prevent them from
buying guns. Cincinnati's ordinance is based on an Ohio law that
allows cities to enact local gun control measures.
   The National Rifle Association, which lobbied against the
ordinance, said Cincinnati's law goes farther than measures in other
cities because it applies to individuals who sell guns, as well as
to commercial gun dealers.
   The law requires anyone selling, renting, leasing or transferring
ownership or possession of a handgun to notify police of the
transaction and fill out an application form. Forms are available at
police district stations and the city Safety Department offices.
   The ordinance does not cover rifles or shotguns.
   Violation is a first-degree misdemeanor with a maximum $1,000
fine and six months in jail.
   Three stores in Cincinnati now sell handguns. Retailers say it is
too soon to tell what impact the ordinance will have on sales.

   Fifteen of Chicago's best and brightest high
school seniors are being enticed into the teaching profession in a
corporate-sponsored scholarship program.
   The 15 students introduced Wednesday as Academy of Educators
Scholars will receive a free, four-year education if they graduate
from college and teach for at least five years. And if they land a
classroom job in Chicago, the students will receive a $12,000 bonus.
   ``All my friends are aspiring lawyers and aspiring physicians,
and all of them want to make a lot of money,'' said Afrika Turner,
17. ``I never wanted to be a nurse or a firewoman, I always wanted
to be a teacher.''
   The program offered by the Foundation for Excellence in Teaching
is being financed by Kraft Inc., Arthur Andersen & Co., GATX Corp.
and a number of individuals.
   Martin Koldyke, who helped start the foundation, said the program
is an investment in the city's youth.
   ``In the venture capital business, you have to project for the
future ... and this is the future,'' said Koldyke, general partner
of Frontenac Co., a venture capital firm.
   The program and others like it have the support of the
680,000-member American Federation of Teachers, which has lobbied
Congress for a similar federal program, said spokesman Scott
Treibitz in Washington.
   ``Having goverment do it is really the norm. I think what is a
little out of the ordinary is having the corporation underwrite this
and I think you will see more and more of that down the line,''
Treibitz said.
   He added corporations ``are begining to realize that they have a
lot at stake and they need to improve the schools.''
   Koldyke said 30 teachers who were winners of the foundation's
Golden Apple awards evaluated the files of 190 promising seniors
nominated by the city's public and private high schools.
   The 15 winners can attend one of four schools: Northwestern
University, DePaul University, University of Illinois-Chicago or the
National College of Education.
   Marvin Lynn, 17, said he jumped at the chance for a scholarship.
   ``I want to be a music educator _ teach high school students to
sing classical music and some gospel,'' Lynn said. ``I think I might
have afforded college without this, but I would have been in debt
for a long time.''
   For Koldyke, who taught for a year in Chicago in 1965, supplying
gifted teachers to the city schools has an element of personal
satisfaction.
   ``I wasn't a very good teacher,'' he said, ``and I came to
realize that it was an extremely tough profession.''

   Following a 76-year-old holiday tradition,
about 2,000 Alaskans lined up in the slush to get a rare look inside
the governor's mansion, shake the chief executive's hand and sip
warm cider.
   Gov. Steve Cowper and his wife, Michael, played host at the
Christmas open house Wednesday night for the third consecutive year
in the colonial mansion overlooking the state capital.
   Except for two years during World War II, the open house has been
an annual event since the imposing, three-story home was built for
territorial Gov. Walter Clark in 1912.
   ``I've been to about 38 of them out of the 40 years I've been
here,'' said 92-year-old Ethel M. Montgomery. ``This is my house and
I love it.''
   The feeling that the house is a state treasure that belongs to
all Alaskans brings them out in every shape, age and occupation.
   ``You wouldn't be able to get away with it in a place with more
population,'' said Koren Bosworth, one of Juneau's 30,000 residents.
``It's nice. It gives people a feeling they're part of it.''
   Guests mingled about the main floor of the 15-room mansion
carrying plates of food and cups of cider or punch, while the
Cowpers and Lt. Gov. Stephen McAlpine and his wife greeted people.
The upstairs living quarters and the basement were off limits.
   In the living room, guests were entertained by violinists and a
chorus, while children lined up to talk to Santa and Mrs. Claus.
   Sandy Fiscus, who was sampling the refreshments with her
12-year-old daughter Robin, said they attend the open house every
year.
   The governor's chef, John DeCherney, and the mansion staff begin
planning for the three-hour affair in July. Baking begins in
September and most of the cookies, breads and hors d'oeuvres are
stored in the freezer.
   This year the treats included 1,500 egg rolls, 1,400 artichoke
pastries, 1,350 sausage pastries, 1,400 deviled eggs and 20 pounds
of Brie cheese stuffed with apples and pears. By the end, only a few
treats remained.
   For many, the open house has become a family tradition. Some
parents brought video cameras, while others took snapshots.
   The largest attendance at the open house came in 1983, when an
estimated 4,000 people filed through the mansion. Interest was
sparked that year by controversy over a $2.7 million mansion
restoration and redecoration project during the term of former Gov.
Bill Sheffield.
   The state foots the bill for the open house, with expenses coming
out of the mansion budget, Cowper spokesman David Ramseur said.

   A mail handler shot three co-workers in the
main New Orleans post office, then holed up inside for 13 hours with
his girlfriend as a hostage, firing birdshot at random from under a
door today, authorities said.
   Warren Murphy threw out his shotgun and surrendered this morning
after all-night telephone negotiations with FBI and police,
including a cousin who is a police officer. His girlfriend appeared
unhurt, said FBI spokeswoman Nancy Fisher.
   The rampage was prompted by Murphy's concern for the welfare of
his two children in his wife's custody in Washington, said Police
Superintendent Warren Woodfork, who got him to surrender. ``I just
tried to appeal to him as a father,'' Woodfork said.
   None of the three co-workers hit by birdshot from Murphy's gun
suffered life-threatening wounds, hospital officials said. One
person was shot in the eye.
   Murphy, who is about 40, was a six-year mail handler who had
recently been promoted but whose wife had left him, post office
spokesman Cesta Ayers said.
   ``He feels like he doesn't like the conditions which they (his
children) are living under, and I assured him that I would look into
that,'' Woodfork said. ``And if his kids are being neglected, I
would do all I could to try to get some intervention to maybe get
the kids back here in the custody of their grandmother.''
   Woodfork said Murphy wasn't angry at his girlfriend and
co-worker, Carol Smith, 29. ``After the shooting started he just
grabbed her,'' the police superintendent said.
   Murphy made only one demand during the siege, telling negotiators
he didn't want to see any reporters. Police moved all reporters and
photographers off the sidewalk to a parking garage across the street.
   Murphy came to work Wednesday night and ``got into some sort of
argument with a co-worker, and pulled a weapon out of a bag he had
secured in the area,'' said Volney Hayes, spokesman for the FBI in
an adjacent building.
   The 8:30 p.m. shootings chased about 400 workers from the
building, which takes up most of a city block across the street from
the Superdome. About 100 workers took cover and hid in the building
for four hours before being escorted out by officers making a
room-by-room search for the gunman.
   Murphy chased off FBI agents with gunfire when they cornered him
in a room used for coffee breaks, Hayes said. During the night,
Murphy apparently became frustrated and fired about 10 more shots,
Hayes said. No one was hurt.
   ``They were just random shots,'' Hayes said. ``They haven't been
at anyone ... just stick the barrel under the door and fire.''
   Gunfire hit the telephone officers and relatives had used to try
to talk Murphy into surrendering. Another phone was tossed to him.
   Hayes said he thought Murphy's shotgun had been brought in
earlier, but he gave no further details except to say two shots were
fired and one of the wounded was the person Murphy argued with. He
did not identify the victims.
   Two people, one hit in a thigh and the other in an arm, were in
stable condition at area hospitals, officials said. A third person
was wounded in the eye and underwent surgery at Charity Hospital.
   When the shooting began, Pat Wingerter of New Orleans was
standing in line with his Christmas cards.
   ``I was going to mail this box of stuff I have and the security
guard came down, he was real excited,'' Wingerter said. ``The guard
was screaming, `There's a guy with a gun!'''
   Wingerter said the security guard ran to the door to make sure
the half dozen or so postal workers and customers escaped.
   ``I heard one shot and then the people started coming out,'' he
said. ``Even after the shot, there were people driving up mailing
letters for about five minutes. It was crazy.''
   The New Orleans post office was the scene of another shooting, in
1980 when postal worker Curtis Collins burst in and killed his
35-year-old supervisor with a .30-caliber carbine.
   On Aug. 20, 1986, part-time mailman Patrick Henry Sherrill walked
into the post office in Edmond, Okla., with guns and ammunition in
his mail bag and began shooting. He killed 14 postal workers and
wounded six others before killing himself.

<TEXT>
   The PLO, once a ragtag army of militants
pursuing the quixotic aim of crushing Israel, has evolved into a
Palestinian government-in-waiting embracing a wide range of
ideologies.
   But the unity is fragile.
   The nine guerrilla factions and other political groups which
constitute the 23-year-old movement are held together by their
Palestinian nationalism. They are prey to the divisive and violent
currents of Arab politics.
   They range from the Marxist guerrillas of George Habash's Popular
Front for the Liberation of Palestine, which endorsed Arafat's
strategy of moderation with some reluctance, to Islamic
fundamentalists.
   The outcome of the talks will be crucial for Arafat's strategy of
moderation.
   That depends to a large degree on him holding the radical
elements of his disparate organization in check long enough to
attain solid political gains _ not just from the United States, but
from Israel.
   The PLO represents a widely divergent constituency in the 5.5
million strong Palestinian diaspora, from poor peasants eking a
living on the scrubland of the Israeli-occupied West Bank to
intellectuals in Western capitals.
   Some, like Habash, are Greek Orthodox Christians. Most, like PLO
Chairman Yasser Arafat, are Moslems.
   The PLO is more than just a military organization dedicated to
regaining the Palestinian homeland lost in 1948. Arafat, 59, has
built it into an institution that provides social, educational and
medical services that are more effective than those run by some Arab
governments.
   Naseer Aruri, professor of political science at Southeastern
Massachussetts University, noted recently that this infrastructure
``was the real target'' of Israel's 1982 invasion of Lebanon, which
was aimed at crushing the PLO.
   The PLO guerrilla factions retain considerable autonomy and are
often backed by different Arab countries, such as Syria, Libya,
Algeria and Iraq, who have frequently sought to manipulate the PLO.
   Since Arafat became chairman 19 years ago, the PLO has often been
wracked by schisms. To hold the movement together, he has had to
constantly compromise, often when a decisive move could have meant a
breakthrough in his efforts to make political gains.
   His success in steering the Palestine National Council, the PLO's
parliament-in-exile and its highest decision-making body, to endorse
recognition of Israel and renounce terrorism was largely due the
year-old Palestinian uprising in the occupied West Bank and Gaza.
   The uprising gave the Palestinian struggle a crucial political
dimension. The revolt arose from frustration at the PLO's failure to
achieve political advances and was the catalyst that helped swing
things Arafat's way.
   The PLO has not announced who will talk with U.S. officials. But
the Palestinian negotiators will be the pointmen for Arafat; Habash,
62, a charismatic physician; and Nayef Hawatmeh, 57, leader of the
Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine.
   These three often meet behind closed doors before convening the
PLO's ruling 15-man executive committee to formulate policy.
   Another key figure will be Farouk Kadoumi, head of the PLO's
political department and its de facto ``foreign minister'' since
1973.
   Khaled Hassan, and his younger brother Hani, have been close
Arafat advisers for years. Both are members of Arafat's Fatah
faction, the largest group in the PLO, and often act as his
emissaries to Arab and European governments.
   Bassam Abu Sharif is another important figure who will be closely
involved behind the scenes with a U.S. team led by Robert H.
Pelletreau Jr., America's ambassador to Tunisia.

<DATELINE>SPITAK, U.S.S.R. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Foreign relief workers said Thursday they
were giving up hope of finding more survivors of the Armenian
earthquake, and crews prepared to evacuate the last residents of
this hard-hit town and raze it.
   Nouradian Norig Kritkorianizh, the first secretary of Spitak's
Communist Party, said in an interview that crews would take measures
to prevent infectious diseases and begin razing the city on Sunday.
   About 15,000 of Spitak's 25,000 people died in the Dec. 7 quake
that destroyed most of city, he said.
   Altogether, the quake killed 55,000 people in Soviet Armenia and
left 500,000 of the area's 700,000 people homeless.
   Foreign relief experts and Soviet officials said hope was fading
to find more survivors, and the Tass news agency said searchers had
found only one person alive in the past 24 hours. That person was
found in Spitak, it said.
   Voices and other signs of life in the ruins of destroyed cities
dropped off sharply after Monday night, when temperatures plummeted
to below freezing, Julia Taft, director of the U.S. Foreign Disaster
Assistance office said at a Moscow news conference.
   ``The hope of finding any more (survivors) is ended,'' she said.
   Green military vans with mounted speakers toured the muddy
streets asking people to leave. Most women and children already were
gone.
   ``We believe the evacuation will take about three days,''
Kritkorianizh said. About 5,000 men needed to begin rebuilding the
city in early spring will be given temporary housing about one mile
from Spitak, he said.
   Trucks were distributing milk, bread, sausages, meat and oranges
to the survivors in Spitak, where it remained cold and damp.
   Some people had set up what was left of their household
belongings _ upholstered chairs, mattresses and even an occassional
brass bed _ around crackling bonfires where it was warmer than
inside tents.
   A large group of people were pressing against the gates of what
was once the city's central market, where soldiers were distributing
warm coats.
   Soviet officials vowed to continue the search until there is no
more hope of bringing people out alive but said no more doctors or
fire brigades are needed.
   ``Yesterday (Wednesday) Health Minister Yevgenvy Chazov said the
search was to continue but that with the lapse of time hopes grow
smaller and smaller. They are still looking for people in the
ruins,'' Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady I. Gerasimov said at a
news briefing.
   Teams from France and Britain have already returned home. Willie
McMartin, head of the 14-member International Rescue Corps from
Britain said he doubted anybody was still alive. ``If I thought
there was someone still alive I would not be sitting here,''
McMartin told reporters at London's Heathrow airport.
   McMartin said his group was physically exhausted and that the
Soviets were beginning to employ bulldozers, making it difficult for
them to use their high technology equipment to find victims.
   Rows of bulldozers were seen parked a few blocks from the main
square in Leninakan, Armenia's second-largest city located to the
west of Spitak.
   George Reid, spokesman for the League of Red Cross and Red
Crescent Societies, said the Soviets had decided to call off the
search and rescue on Dec. 20 and that some of the foreign relief
teams were leaving.
   ``It is a terrible dilemna for authorities caught between the
need for proper sanitation and the need to respect relatives who are
still hanging on,'' he told The Associated Press.
   He said that 25,000 bodies had been counted based on figures
provided to the Red Cross by the Soviet Council of Ministers. Tass
reported Wednesday that 21,755 bodies had been identified and
counted so far.
   Thousands of corpses remained buried in rubble.
   ``There is a danger of typhoid, cholera, and dysentery from the
poor sanitation in the disaster area which has likely led to
contamination of the water supply by insects and rodents,'' Dr. Jan
Borg of the Netherlands Red Cross said in an interview in Yerevan.
   Reporters visitng Leninakan on Thursday saw hundreds of sacks of
lime piled at a hospital, apparently in preparation for spreading on
corpses.
   While the relief teams were pulling out, looters were moving in.
   Police have detained 179 people accused of stealing foreign
relief packages and looting in the last 24 hours, Tass said.
   ``Monstrous as it sounds, there are also others _ better
described as shadows rather than as human beings. .. They roam
around the ruins _ not looking anybody in the face, they roam around
the ruins _ not to save but to steal,'' Armenia's Deputy Interior
Minister Viktor Erin told Tass.

<HEAD>UN General Assembly Calls for Middle East Conference</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRENDA WATSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>GENEVA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.N. General Assembly passed a resolution
Thursday, with only the United States and Israel opposed, calling
for an international Middle East peace conference and U.N.
supervision of Israeli-occupied Arab lands.
   It acted at the end of a three-day debate on Palestinian
questions, which was moved from New York to Geneva after the United
States denied PLO chairman Yasser Arafat a visa. The vote was 138-2
with Canada and Costa Rica abstaining and Iran not participating.
   Libya and Syria voted yes with reservations, declaring they did
not recognize Israel, which was mentioned in the resolution.
   An international conference should be convened under U.N.
auspices ``with the participation of all parties to the conflict,
including the Palestine Liberation Organization, on an equal
footing,'' the resolution said, and the Security Council should
establish a preparatory committee.
   Ambassador Vernon A. Walters had said in the debate Wednesday
that the United States would oppose such a resolution.
   ``An international conference may be useful insofar as it helps
to launch and support direct negotiations, but a conference must not
preempt or substitute for the direct negotiations'' between Israel
and the Palestinians and Arab nations, Walters said.
   The resolution ``affirms'' that one principle for achieving peace
is ``the withdrawal of Israel from the Palestinian territory
occupied since 1967, including Jerusalem, and the other occupied
Arab territories.''
   It ``notes the expressed desire and endeavors to place the
Palestinian territory occupied since 1967, including Jerusalem,
under the supervision of the United Nations for a limited period, as
part of the peace process.''
   An uprising against Israeli rule began Dec. 8, 1987, among the
1.5 million Palestinians in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.
Thirteen Israelis and more than 320 Palestinians have been killed.
   A separate resolution passed Thursday ``acknowledges the
proclamation of the State of Palestine by the Palestine National
Council,'' which acts as the PLO legislature, Nov. 15 in Algiers.
   It says the designation ``Palestine Liberation Organization''
will be changed to ``Palestine'' in the U.N. system but the change
would not constitute U.N. recognition of a Palestinian state. The
PLO has observer status at the United Nations and is invited to
participate in Middle East debates.
   Israel and the United States also opposed the second resolution,
which passed 104-2 with 36 abstentions.
   Joseph Petrone, U.S. ambassador to the United Nations in Geneva,
told the assembly the resolutions ``are unhelpful and inconsistent
with the search for peace.'' In a statement explaining the U.S.
vote, Petrone described U.N. supervision in the occupied territories
as ``impractical and unrealistic.''
   He said changing the U.N. reference from PLO to Palestine ``is
vague and could be susceptible to various interpretations. We cannot
support attempts to lend even a degree of purported legitimacy to
the self-proclaimed Palestinian state.''
   Petrone repeated the statement Washington made Wednesday that the
PLO had met U.S. conditions for direct contacts: explicit acceptance
of Security Council resolutions 242 and 338 (calling for Israeli
withdrawal from occupied land and secure borders for all Middle East
states), recognizing Israel's right to exist and renouncing
terrorism.
   ``We view this as another step forward toward the direct
negotiations between the parties concerned that are essential to
achieving a comprehensive settlement,'' he said.
   Javier Perez de Cuellar, U.N. secretary-general, said the U.S.
policy change was ``excellent news'' and created ``much more
favorable'' conditions for an international peace conference
including the PLO.
   Vladimir Petrovsky, the Soviet deputy foreign minister, said it
was ``a reasonable action going in the right direction'' but added:
``It is not enough today to maintain just dialogue for the sake of
dialogue.''
   U.N. spokesman Francois Giuliani said Perez de Cuellar would
return to New York on Friday for consultations intended to speed the
peace process.
   These nations abstained on the second resolution: Antigua and
Barbuda, Australia, Austria, Bahamas, Barbados, Belgium, Bhutan,
Britain, Canada, Central African Republic, Costa Rica, Ivory Coast,
Denmark, Finland, France, Greece, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, Japan,
Lesotho, Liberia, Luxembourg, Malawi, Nepal, Netherlands, New
Zealand, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Trinidad and Tobago,
Uruguay, Venezuela, West Germany and Zaire.

<HEAD>LaRouche Case Goes to Jury as Prosecutors Allege `Enormous Crime'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT M. ANDREWS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The mail fraud conspiracy trial of political
maverick Lyndon LaRouche and six associates went to a federal jury
Thursday, with defense lawyers proclaiming their innocence and
government prosecutors charging they had committed ``an enormous
crime _ a $30 million crime.''
   After explaining the legal complexities for nearly an hour, Chief
U.S. District Judge Albert V. Bryan Jr. sent the case to the jury of
eight women and four men at midday, as Christmas carols chimed from
a church tower outside the courtroom.
   Bryan had said the jurors would deliberate through Saturday, if
necessary, to reach a verdict in the case involving LaRouche, 66,
head of a controversial political movement and a perennial
independent presidential candidate.
   LaRouche did not testify in his own defense during the 15-day
trial, but Bryan cautioned jurors not to let that influence their
decision.
   The judge also said LaRouche's political views were irrelevant to
the case, and Assistant U.S. Attorney Kent Robinson denied defense
lawyers' suggestions that the government was trying to ``get at Mr.
LaRouche or quiet a political movement.''
   LaRouche and six of his fund-raisers and other aides are charged
with mail fraud and conspiracy in an alleged scheme to raise more
than $30 million in loans from supporters without any intention of
repaying them.
   In addition, LaRouche is accused of conspiring to defraud the
Internal Revenue Service by having all his personal expenses _
housing, meals, clothing, travel and even haircuts _ paid by various
corporations he controls, and claiming he had no taxable income.
   LaRouche has not filed federal income tax returns for any year
since 1978, government prosecutors said. His lawyers contended he
had received ``non-taxable compensation'' as an employee of his
organization.
   If convicted of all 13 counts against him, LaRouche faces a
maximum penalty of 65 years in prison and fines totaling $3.25
million.
   In the final closing defense argument, attorney Michael Reilly
said his client, fund-raiser Paul Greenberg, and his colleagues
solicited loans with good-faith assurances that they would be repaid
as promised.
   Waving his arm at each of the seven defendants, Reilly told the
jurors, ``They are not guilty, and I ask you to say so.''
   In his rebuttal, Robinson said LaRouche and his associates knew
their organization was in such dire financial straits that it was
``a bankruptcy waiting to happen,'' but that they never warned
prospective lenders they probably wouldn't get their money back.
   Defense lawyers asked the jurors to question why LaRouche
fund-raisers would ``cut off their life blood'' by defrauding loyal
supporters. To this, Robinson responded that ``they weren't the life
blood of this organization. These supporters were being bled dry.''
   Robinson accused the LaRouche people of treating their lenders
with ``cynicism and disregard,'' an attitude he said resulted in
``an enormous crime _ a $30 million crime.''
   He said there was only one issue to decide: ``Did the defendants
tell the truth when they tried to borrow money from people _ did
they tell the truth, or did they lie?''
   Bryan reminded the jurors that membership in a political
organization, even one with ``honest albeit controversial views,''
is lawful under the Constitution and is not evidence of any criminal
activity.
   LaRouche's political movement embraces a number of unorthodox
positions, and relies heavily on conspiracy theories to explain
world events. It has alleged that prominent figures suchy as former
Secretary of State Henry Kissinger and Britain's Queen Elizabeth
participate in those conspiracies.
   Some Larouche supporters also have advocated a quarantine for
AIDS victims and have been accused of harboring anti-Semitic views.

<HEAD>Reformist Soldiers Discharged, Priest Expelled From Order</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL NORTON</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ Several soldiers who joined a
rank-and-file rebellion that brought Lt. Gen. Prosper Avril to power
three months ago have been discharged for insubordination, an army
official said Thursday.
   ``We cannot let anarchy reign over the armed forces of Haiti,''
Col. Joseph L. Florestant, secretary general of the military staff,
told the Associated Press in a telephone interview.
   In another development, the Salesian Roman Catholic order said in
Rome that it has expelled a Haitian activist priest it accused of
instigating violence and exalting class warfare. The Rev. Jean
Bertrand Aristide was the apparent target of a September attack on a
church that killed 13 people.
   Independent Radio Haiti Inter said Thursday that over the weekend
several soldiers were discharged in the southern town of Les Cayes,
nine each from garrisons in the northern towns of St. Marc and
Gonaives and four in the southwestern town of Aquin.
   The station said all the ousted soldiers supported the Sept. 17
coup against former leader Lt. Gen. Henri Namphy and the nationwide
purge of unpopular officers that followed it.
   Florestant said the soldiers were not discharged because of their
support for the September mutiny but because of their
insubordination after the coup.
   ``We cannot accept that orders come from the bottom of the
hierarchy,'' Florestant said. ``If an enlisted man had been stirred
up and no longer wants to obey orders thinking he has become a
political figure, he may be sanctioned in conformity with the
regulations of the army.''
   Florestant, who was himself appointed to his post after the coup,
said the discharge orders were issued by regional commanders and not
the army high command in Port-au-Prince.
   Soldiers said they ousted Namphy because they were disgusted by
state-sponsored violence. They ousted nearly 60 officers accused of
being repressive and linked to the former Duvalier family
dictatorship.
   Their demands included a return to democratic rule, respect for
human rights and better living conditions for Haiti's 7,000-man army.
   Namphy came to power after former President Jean-Claude Duvalier
fled to exile in France in February 1986, ending 29 years of famly
dictatorship.
   Aristide, 35, has led calls for uprooting the vestiges of the
Duvalier regime. In September, he was escaped during a bloody attack
on his church in Port-au-Prince during a Sunday Mass by thugs linked
to the ousted regime. Thirteen people were killed and more than 70
were wounded.
   A communique issued in Rome by the Salesian Society of St. John
Bosco said Aristide had rebuffed repeated attempts to correct his
behavior, which they described as ``in contrast with his Salesian
and priestly vocation.''
   ``The type of political commitment he has assumed is in serious
contrast with the clear will of the founder (of the order),'' the
statement said.
   ``In addition, the incitement to hate and violence, the
exaltation of class struggle, go directly against that fidelity to
the (teaching) of the church that forms a living part of the
Salesian spirit.''
   Aristide has been at odds with superiors of his Salesian order in
Rome for some time. He was ordered to leave his homeland and go to
Canada by Oct. 17, but he defied the order and remains in Haiti.
   The order's spokesman, the Rev. Giuseppe Costa, said the decree,
ratified by the Vatican last week, did not change Aristide's status
as a priest.

<HEAD>Censors Approve Controversial Director's Film</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KATHY WILHELM</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Film censors in their first open meeting ever
approved a controversial movie about a young man who cannot cope
with China's new competition and commits suicide, an official paper
said Thursday.
   The censors decided that the movie, tentatively titled
``Transmigration,'' can be released uncut to Chinese theaters, the
Guangming Daily said.
   The movie is directed by Huang Jianxin and produced by the Xian
Film Studio, which in recent years has produced China's most
technically innovative and politically daring films.
   Huang's first feature movie, ``The Black Cannon Incident'' in
1985, was cut by censors but still caused an uproar with its attack
on mindless bureaucracy. It told the story of a telegraphed message
about a missing chess piece that was misinterpreted by officials as
a message about a real cannon.
   The Guangming Daily said censors in the Ministry of Radio, Film
and Television discussed Huang's new movie in a two-hour session
that was open to journalists for the first time. It did not say if
the censors plan to make all their meetings open.
   Few Chinese films have dealt with the impact on ordinary lives of
the economic reforms of the past decade, in which central planning
and social welfare guarantees have been reduced in favor of the free
market.
   Although the incomes of most Chinese have risen dramatically,
some have actually slid and many people are unable or unwilling to
obtain jobs or promotions based on merit.
   By showing the underside of the new competition in which some
can't keep up, Huang's movie could be seen as an indirect attack on
government policy. But he said in an interview earlier this year
that this was not his intent.
   The 34-year-old director said his goal was not to provoke
controversy but to ``make films that reflect social problems'' so
they can be corrected.
   The Guangming Daily said the censors decided that the movie ``is
an authentic and honest attempt to portray the reactions of young
people to the reform era in China, and has artistic appeal.''
   For decades, censors met privately and without objective
guidelines to rule on the acceptability of movies and other
entertainment. The Ministry of Culture is drafting a law that would
establish rules for what is permissible.
   Although this would reduce the power of individual censors, some
artists have expressed fears the law will halt the current process
of gradual experimentation and liberalization.

<HEAD>CBS Asks FCC To Deny High School Station's License Request</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   CBS Inc., new owner of WCIX-TV, wants the Federal
Communications Commission to take a high school radio station off
the air, saying the station's signal interferes with the television
station's audio transmission.
   In papers filed Tuesday with the agency, CBS asked that WKPX,
Piper High School's 3,000-watt progressive rock station, be denied a
permanent license.
   WKPX has operated under a construction permit since it went on
the air in February 1983. WCIX filed a protest shortly afterward.
   Steve Salo, a student in Piper's evening radio class, said those
involved in the station ``see this as the big guy coming down on the
little guy.''
   ``And the little guy, in this case, is providing education to
kids, promoting the arts, promoting local groups,'' Salo said.
   But Allen Shacklan, vice president for programming for CBS
television stations, said WKPX shouldn't have been allowed to
broadcast on its frequency in the first place.
   ``It looks like the FCC made a terrible mistake in ever granting
that permit,'' he said.
   At that time, Shacklan said, the FCC was in the midst of a
proceeding that would prohibit radio stations at the low end of the
FM band in areas where they conflict with television audio
transmissions.
   He said CBS has offered a proposal to WKPX that would allow it to
stay on the air, but would not discuss details. WKPX officials
wouldn't talk about it either, but said it was unacceptable.
   CBS takes control of WCIX on Jan. 3. No date has been set for an
FCC decision.

<HEAD>Supreme Court Rules Against French-Only Signs</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SOLL SUSSMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TORONTO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In a decision that could revive tensions between
French and English speakers in Quebec, the Supreme Court of Canada
ruled Thursday against a provincial law requiring commercial signs
to be written in French.
   The court's 5-0 ruling says Quebec can order French on signs but
cannot prevent other languages being used as well.
   Quebec Premier Robert Bourassa was expected to announce Sunday
how the provincial government will comply with the ruling.
   The language law, known as Bill 101, was passed in 1977 when the
separatist Parti Quebecois held power. Bourassa's Liberal Party
platform has supported multilingual signs.
   The Ottawa court ruling found section 58 of the law requiring
commercial signs to be written only in French violated guarantees of
freedom of expression provided in the Quebec charter. But it said
the Quebec government's goal of providing a French ``linguistic
face'' for the province is valid.
   Constitutional lawyers interpreted the ruling as meaning Bourassa
should be able to find a compromise.
   ``The judgment makes it consistent with civil liberties,'' lawyer
Julius Grey said in a television interview with Canadian
Broadcasting Corp.
   Power in Quebec shifted from the English minority to the 81
percent French majority during the 1970s, a tumultuous decade of
separatist sentiment that subsided when voters rejected a
sovereignty referendum in 1980.
   Since then, Quebecers have focused on improved living standards
and competitiveness.
   The province boasted 5 percent real growth last year and produced
40 percent of Canada's business administration students. It was a
support base for the free trade agreement with the United States
signed by Prime Minister Brian Mulroney and President Reagan last
January.
   The court rulings stemmed from two separate cases, one involving
five companies that used bilingual signs and the other from Allan
Singer, a Montreal stationer who insisted he had the right to use
signs written only in English.
   ``It's not a good decision for us,'' Singer told reporters in
Montreal. ``We wanted the English language in Quebec and in Canada,
and we've been denied it.''
   Morton Brownstein, whose chain of shoe stores is one of five
businesses in the other case, told CBC television that all depends
on what steps the provincial government takes. ``I think everybody's
looking for a compatible solution to this dilemma,'' he said.
   The most ardent supporters of French-only legislation want
Bourassa to invoke a clause that could override the Supreme Court
ruling. Yet English-speaking ministers in his government are
expected to resign unless he acts to comply with it.

   Anabolic steroids, the substances taken to help
build muscle, are man-made versions of a male sex hormone called
testosterone.
   In children and teen-agers, steroids can make bones stop growing
prematurely and prevent a child from reaching normal height, the
U.S. Food and Drug Administration warned last year.
   Health authorities also say steroids can cause breast enlargement
in men, along with testicle shrinkage, impotence and enlarged
prostate. In women, steroids have been linked to deepened voice,
beard growth, baldness and breast diminution.
   Steroid users of either gender may also show liver disorders and
``'roid rage,'' which is increased aggression and antisocial
behavior. A study of steroid-taking athletes published earlier this
year found mental problems ranging from deep depression to impulsive
buying sprees and outbursts of violent rage.
   Anabolic steroids are different from anti-inflammatory steroids,
which are commonly used in medicine. Anabolic steroids also have
some medically approved uses, such as treating certain types of
anemia.

   Once again the Agriculture Department is going
to let processors keep on making old-fashioned country hams until
paperwork on a new food safety requirment is completed.
   The deadline for ham producers to comply with new federal
regulations was supposed to be Dec. 31, 1988. But then the previous
deadline was supposed to be last Dec. 31. And the one before that
was Dec. 31, 1986. There also was one on Aug. 6, 1985.
   Now, the department's Food Safety and Inspection Service said
Thursday, the new deadline will be Dec. 31, 1989 _ or whenever the
agency finally approves the new rules, spokeswoman Irene Goins said.
   The lengthy rule-making procedure involves those hams often seen
on grocery shelves in cloth bags, or hanging from rafters in country
stores. They must be scrubbed to remove mold and then soaked or
boiled a couple of times to reduce the salt content.
   They're the kind of hams for which someone had to invent red-eye
gravy and, in some parts of the country, grits.
   As the USDA defines them, they're ``uncooked, cured, dried,
smoked or unsmoked pork products made from solid meat.''
   Typically, country or dry-cured hams are treated with salt and
then put in a smokehouse to cure and age, a total process that can
take months or even years.
   Most hams sold in supermarkets are wet-cured quickly in brine
solutions and cooked before sale to consumers.
   In March 1983 the USDA proposed rules intended to help prevent
trichinosis, a disease caused by microscopic parasitic worms, or
trichinae, that can occur in improperly cooked pork. The proposed
rules were directed at ready-to-eat pork products and dry-cured
country hams.
   Shortly after the original proposal was adopted on Feb. 6, 1985,
the agency learned that some federally inspected ham producers were
using old-fashioned methods that didn't meet the new USDA
requirements and were ordered to show by Aug. 6, 1985, that their
curing procedures were safe.
   The country ham industry protested, so the USDA allowed more
time. One compelling reason for the extensions of time for
compliance was that no trichina problems had been associated with
the dry-cured hams.
   ``These traditional processing methods have been permitted
because they are decades-old methods believed to be effective in
destroying trichinae,'' says Ronald J. Prucha, acting administrator
of the USDA agency.
   ``We are researching the safety of traditional trichina control
methods and developing a proposed rule for issuance in early 1989,''
he said. ``After we receive public comments on that proposal, we
will develop new regulations.''
   But just in case the USDA's rule-making machine is slower than
officials hope, the compliance deadline was extended another full
year.

   The U.S. agreement to talk with the Palestine
Liberation Organization spares President-elect Bush one politically
difficult decision, but gives him another arduous task: overseeing
that dialogue.
   The decision by the Reagan adminstration guarantees that the
Middle East's explosive problems will face Bush as soon as he enters
the Oval Office on Jan. 20, even though the vice president said
Thursday, ``There's no game plan, there's no five-point program.''
   Although initial contacts with the PLO are to begin in Tunis,
Tunisia, later this week, there is little doubt that the turnabout
decision clears the way for the Bush administration to try to bring
Israel and the Palestinians into direct negotiations.
   With tensions high on both sides of the 40-year-old dispute, such
a task could be monumental.
   Bush not only will have to deal with PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat,
whom just a week before the Reagan adminstration had branded a
terrorist, but he'll have to do it in a way that avoids souring
relations with Israel.
   Bush stressed Thursday that the initiative, which he fully
supported, was ``a dialogue, not negotations.''
   ``Let's see how things evolve. My position remains the same. I
want to see direct talks between, for example, between King Hussein
of Jordan and the Israelis,'' he told reporters.
   At the White House, spokesman Marlin Fitzwater denied that
President Reagan made the tough decision so Bush wouldn't have to do
it. But he conceded the action could be helpful to the next
administration.
   ``This is one step further down the road in the pace process and
should provide for new options,'' Fitzwater said.
   He said Reagan had conferred with Bush before making the final
decision, although had not given Bush veto power over it.
   Secretary of State George Shultz's announcement Wednesday that
the United States would initiate a ``substantive dialogue'' with the
PLO saved Bush from having to expend his own political capital in
sorting out the issue.
   Less than a month after he denied Arafat a visa and barred him
speaking at the United Nations in New York on grounds he was a
terrorist, Shultz said the PLO leader had met three conditions long
insisted on by the administration.
   Bush said he fully supported the decision to open talks with the
PLO, in light of Arafat's assertion that he had met the three U.S.
conditions: recognition of Israel's right to exist, a renunciation
of terrorism and acceptance of two U.N. peace resolutions.
   Although U.S. officials have stressed that this country remains
committed to the security of Israel and still opposes an independent
Palestinian state, the decision reversed a longstanding U.S. refusal
to deal with the PLO.
   Israel has shown no indications it is willing to follow suit. Its
government still refuses to deal with what it views as a terrorist
organization devoted to its destruction.
   Major disputes continue to divide Israel and the Palestinians,
including the status of Jerusalem.
   While Bush has had more experience in foreign affairs than any
president since Richard Nixon, his choice for secretary of state,
James A. Baker III, has relatively little background in that area.
   However, Baker's reputation as a non-ideological problem solver,
honed in exchange-rate and trade negotiations with U.S. economic
allies in his 2{ years as treasury secretary, could help make up for
this lack of experience.
   Bush's campaign record provides few clues to the kind of
positions he might take as talks progress on the Palestinian issue.
   For the most part, the vice president dodged most specific
questions concerning the Middle East, as did Democratic rival
Michael Dukakis.
   Bush did speak forcefully during the campaign of his dedication
to U.S.-Israeli strategic cooperation, and he said he would not deal
with the PLO or back an independent Palestinian state _ echoing
administration positions of the day.
   It remains to be seen whether Reagan and Shultz's legacy to Bush
and Baker will be a blessing or a curse.
   Asked Thursday if he would prefer that the talks wait until his
administration starts next month, Bush replied: ``I become president
on Jan. 20. On Jan. 21, I'll tell you what I want to do.''

   Sten Andersson smiled at the television in his
hotel suite when it carried the news that ended months of secret
meetings, and last-minute quibbles over words in two languages not
his own.
   The Swedish foreign minister guided the diplomacy culminating in
the U.S. agreement to talk to the PLO, which Secretary of State
George P. Shultz announced Wednesday night.
   Sweden's effort to bring the United States and the Palestine
Liberation Organization together began on a trip Andersson made to
the Middle East in March. During that visit he saw the Palestinian
uprising, now a year old, against Israeli rule in the occupied West
Bank and Gaza Strip.
   ``I met with about 100 boys shot by Israeli soldiers, some of
them paralyzed for life,'' he told reporters Thursday.
   The 64-year-old Swedish diplomat went to Jordan after Israel, and
talks with two PLO leaders convinced him they wanted a separate
Palestinian state rather than the destruction of Israel Palestinians
had preached for decades.
   Egyptians, Saudi Arabians and envoys from several European
nations were involved in negotiations that followed. Andersson said
he met with Vernon A. Walters, Washington's ambassador to the United
Nations, and hinted to the journalists of contacts with Shultz.
   He said Sweden acted as ``a postman'' delivering messages, but
added: ``I confess we have written some of the letters, too.''
   Eugene Makhlouf, PLO delegate to Stockholm, said the Swedes did
most of the diplomatic maneuvering. ``They worked very hard until we
achieved this result,'' he said just after the Shultz announcement.
   Andersson described his role to a few reporters early Thursday
morning, and at a crowded news conference later. He told the news
conference he approached American Jews, not Israelis, because he did
not want the Israeli government to know about his activities in
advance.
   ``The most crucial event was the meeting with the Jewish
personalities from the United States,'' attended by Khalid el-Hassan
of the PLO, ``a fortnight before (PLO Chairman Yasser) Arafat came
to Stockholm,'' Andersson said.
   Rita Hauser, a prominent member of the Republican Party, led the
American Jewish delegation at the secret meeting. El-Hassan is a
leading figure in the PLO and a confidant of Arafat.
   After the meeting, the foreign minister said, he wrote a document
expressing the agreements reached and both sides agreed to sign it.
The document was not made public until last week, when Arafat
visited Stockholm to meet with Ms. Hauser and other American Jews.
   Most of the meeting with Arafat dealt with strategy for
persuading the U.S. government to deal with the PLO.
   Andersson's last maneuvers were performed Wednesday afternoon,
when he settled arguments over which words in English and Arabic the
United States would accept in Arafat's announcement that he
renounced terrorism and accepted Israel's right to exist.
   On Tuesday, U.S. officials had said a speech by Arafat to the
U.N. General Assembly in Geneva did not meet American conditions for
contacts with the PLO.
   That speech and his statement Wednesday seemed much the same, but
Andersson said Arafat's remarks at the news conference, in English,
cleared up questions of language that had disturbed the Americans.
   He said all the ideas expressed Wednesday were in Arafat's speech
in Arabic a day earlier, but were ``split up and in different
words.''
   Arabs have a different way of making speeches than Americans, the
Swedish diplomat observed: ``They use a lot of words. A lot of words
always cause confusion, misunderstanding. ... If he (Arafat) changes
the words, the Americans say `What's going on here?'.''
   Arafat said in the speech, for instance, that he ``condemned''
terrorism, and at the news conference that he ``renounced'' it.
   Makhlouf said one word covers for both concepts in Arabic. The
PLO representative added that another element contributed to the
delay in a favorable response from Washington: ``They didn't believe
their ears yesterday (Tuesday). They needed to hear it again.''
   Andersson, whose diplomatic involvement with the Arab-Israeli
conflict covers 25 years, said he felt the U.S. decision was an
important step in breaking the Middle East stalemate.
   ``The beginning of peace is always dialogue, but it has a long
way to go,'' he said.

   The government needs to funnel more money to
the nation's colleges and universities and to the students who wish
to attend them, a group of educators told a congressional panel on
Thursday.
   Witnesses appearing before the Joint Economic Committee's
education and health subcommittee said that diverting more resources
to post-secondary education would pay off in the long run with a
higher-skilled work force.
   ``What we have done up to the present time in order to create a
work force as motivated, skilled and dedicated as those we confront
in Japan, West Germany and other industrialized nations has
obviously not been adequate and can even be called tragically
inadequate,'' said Stephen Joel Trachtenberg, president of George
Washington University.
   The subcommittee released a report on Wednesday, the first day of
the two-day hearing, that recommended ways to better American
schools, including lengthening the school year, improving vocational
education and other programs, and increasing the emphasis on basic
skills such as reading and studying.
   But on Thursday, the panel's chairman, Rep. James Scheuer,
D-N.Y., emphasized what he said was a need to consider making
post-secondary education available to all qualified students.
   ``Kindergarten through grade 12 education, which was adequate for
the work force of a predominantly agricultural nation adapting to
industrialization, is simply obsolete in today's complex and
sophisticated high-tech environment,'' Scheuer said.
   The educators who addressed the committee agreed, and argued that
federal aid to colleges and universities has eroded in recent years.
   Robert H. Atwell, president of the American Council on Education,
said the inflation-adjusted value of the maximum Pell Grant award
for colleges costs has declined by 13 percent during the 1980s.
   Atwell also noted that the numbers of minority students are
projected to increase from one-fifth of all American children under
age 17 to one-third by the year 2000. In addition, by the turn of
the century, more than one in seven workers will be non-white, he
said.
   ``The federal government, the states and institutions must
develop a partnership in providing the financial resources and
educational programs that will enable all our citizens to develop to
their full potential,'' he said.

<HEAD>Panel Concerned About Earthquake Safety at Savannah River Plant</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BARTON REPPERT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A scientific advisory panel has urged the
Department of Energy to bolster the resistance to earthquakes of a
weapons production reactor at the trouble-plagued Savannah River
Plant.
   The panel also has concluded that to avoid confusion during a
crisis, fewer personnel should be regularly assigned to the control
room of the K reactor at the facility near Aiken, S.C. The reactor
currently is shut down because of maintenance and safety concerns.
   The recommendations came in a letter, released Thursday, to
Energy Secretary John S. Herrington from the department's Advisory
Committee on Nuclear Facility Safety, which DOE established earlier
this year to assess safety programs at the nuclear plant.
   The three reactors at Savannah River are the nation's only source
for tritium, a radioactive isotope of hydrogen vital to boosting the
explosive power of modern nuclear warheads. Because tritium decays
at a rate of 5.5 percent a year, it needs to be replenished
regularly.
   The advisory committee, chaired by John F. Ahearne, a former
chairman of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, declined to endorse a
detailed DOE report presenting the department's strategy for
restarting the K reactor.
   The just-completed DOE report outlined more than 160 separate
tasks, calling for a complete overhaul of training, safety,
management, operating and inspection procedures.
   In the advisory panel's 11-page letter to Herrington, Ahearne
said that ``in our opinion ... the restart strategy document
represents only an initial step in DOE's efforts to develop sound
operations at SRP (the Savannah River Plant).''
   He added that ``we have broad concerns regarding safety
philosophy, the overall criteria for restart and management.''
   A DOE spokesman, Douglas Elmets, said in response to the letter:
``Secretary Herrington has received this very constructive document.
We believe that this an important part of the process, and we will
respond in due course. Secretary Herrington takes very seriously the
recommendations of the advisory committee.''
   Regarding earthquakes, Ahearne wrote, ``the seismic resistance
issue in the restart strategy appears to be narrowly focused, does
not indicate what must be completed before restart and tends to
weaken the defense-in-depth philosophy.''
   ``The seismic resistance criterion requires the capability to
shut down, cool and monitor core status for a design basis
earthquake (0.2 g), but it is not stated whether or not this needs
to be completed before startup,'' he said.
   The ``g'' figure represents the strength of shaking that a
structure undergoes during an earthquake. A level of 0.2 g would be
approximately equivalent to the force exerted by a nearby quake with
a magnitude of 6 on the Richter scale.
   Ahearne noted in the letter that ``seismic criteria for the
confinement system and the ECS (emergency core cooling system) were
not included because neither is considered to be a `primary safety
system.' Crucial instruments are to be seismically qualified, but
the instrumentation system (wiring, sensors, etc.) is neglected.''
   ``We recommend that the ECS and confinement systems be
seismically upgraded prior to restart,'' he said.
   Overall, Ahearne wrote, ``a rationale should be developed for
deciding which upgrades are of immediate concern, which can be
delayed until after restart and for how long.''
   On the control room issue, the letter to Herrington said current
plans call for at least 12 people being in the K reactor control
room when the reactor is restarted.
   They include five reactor operators, a technical support
engineer, a shift adviser, a DOE Savannah River office onsite
engineer, an environmental safety and health inspector, a DOE
headquarters observer, a contractor oversight representative and a
contract operations manager.
   ``This number is clearly excessive,'' Ahearne wrote. ``Indeed, it
is difficult to see how such a large group could communicate
effectively to provide prompt attention to any crisis situation. The
list of people required for plant control room duties should be
reviewed carefully and access limited to essential personnel.''

<HEAD>Vietnam Turns Over Remains To U.S. Team</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Vietnam on Thursday gave a U.S. military
team 38 sets of remains believed to be those of American servicemen,
a U.S. spokesman said. It was the largest such repatriation since
the Vietnam War ended.
   In a 50-minute ceremony at Hanoi airport, a U.S. military honor
guard loaded the remains, each in metal caskets draped with U.S.
flags, onto an Air Force plane, said Lt. Col. Thomas J. Boyd of the
U.S. Pacific Command.
   He said the plane took off for Honolulu, where the Army Central
Identification Laboratory will determine if the remains belong to
any of the 1,747 Americans listed as missing in action, or MIA, in
Vietnam.
   ``The remains are all associated with incidents in the northern
provinces. They said they were found in lots of different
circumstances and some of the remains were found by local
villagers,'' Boyd said.
   He said the Vietnamese ``presented possible names associated with
some of the remains.'' Boyd said the Vietnamese also turned over
information on 12 other missing Americans.
   Xinhua, the official Chinese news agency, quoted unidentified
Vietnamese sources as saying Vietnam will step up the search for
American MIAs and has agreed to accept more U.S. teams to conduct
searches.
   The previous largest turnover of suspected MIA remains involved
27 sets handed over April 6.
   Boyd said a four-member team of U.S. forensic experts examined 45
boxes of other remains in Hanoi and found some that they recommended
for analysis in the United States. Earlier reports had said 80 sets
of remains were examined.
   The other three teams searched Binh Tri Thien and Nghe Tinh
provinces in north-central Vietnam, looking at U.S. warplane crash
sites and interviewing villagers who witnessed the crashes, Boyd
said. Their 10-day project ended Thursday.
   Investigators focused on 70 ``discrepancy cases'' where the
United States says Vietnamese authorities should have information,
including cases of captured airmen who were never returned.
   Boyd said Vietnamese and U.S. technical experts would meet in
Hanoi on Monday to Wednesday to review work, decide on possible
repatriations and discuss future projects.
   Since the war ended, Vietnam has returned remains of 172
Americans which have been identified by the Army laboratory.
   Currently, 2,383 Americans are listed as MIA: 1,747 in Vietnam,
547 in Laos, 83 in Cambodia, and six in China.
   The repatriation Thursday was the seventh since retired Gen. John
W. Vessey, acting as a special U.S. envoy, reached agreement in
August 1987 with Vietnam's Foreign Minister Nguyen Co Thach to end
months of deadlock on the MIA issue.
   The first American combat troops landed in then-South Vietnam in
March 1965. The Paris Peace Accords in January 1973 halted U.S.
fighting in the conflict, which claimed the lives of about 58,000
Americans and ended in the communist victory over the U.S.-backed
South Vietnamese government in April 1975.
   Bitter political bickering between Hanoi and Washington has often
blocked accounting for the U.S. missing. The U.S. government says it
will not consider normalizing relations with Vietnam until Hanoi
withdraws all its troops from Cambodia and resolves the MIA issue.
   In Laos, U.S. and Laotian officials were continuing a joint
excavation Thursday in southern Savannakhet province to try to
determine the fate of a pilot shot down in 1968. The excavation, to
be completed in a few days, is the fourth such joint project in Laos.

<HEAD>Hearing Set Next Week for Final Trial Preparations</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES ROWLEY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The judge in the Iran-Contra case on Thursday
scheduled a hearing for Dec. 21 to begin making final preparations
for the trial of former White House aide Oliver L. North.
   U.S. District Judge Gerhard A. Gesell, who has previously
indicated the trial could begin as early as late January, said in an
order that he wanted to discuss procedures for screening potential
jurors and other pre-trial housekeeping matters.
   The scheduling order provided yet another indication that Gesell
is determined to take the case to a speedy trial.
   On Monday, he strictly limited the number of classified documents
that North can introduce into evidence and set a Jan. 3 deadline for
listing those secrets he would propose to disclose at the trial.
   Gesell's rulings on secret documents earlier this week greatly
increased the likelihood that all the charges against the former
National Security Council aide will go to trial despite Reagan
administration refusal to release secret documents the defense wants
to publicly disclose.
   Under the Classified Information Procedures Act, Gesell could
still dismiss the central conspiracy charge against North if he
determines that the withheld documents are needed to ensure that
North gets a fair trial.
   But the judge made clear that he would not allow North to
introduce documents that were not relevant to his defense simply to
scuttle his prosecution.
   North is accused of conspiring to illegally divert U.S.-Iran
arms-sale profits to the Contra rebels in Nicaragua.
   He faces a total of 14 felony counts, including charges he lied
to Congress, destroyed documents, pocketed travelers checks intended
for the Contra leaders and illegally used a tax-exempt foundation to
raise money to arm the rebels.
   Three co-defendants are set to be tried separately after North.
   At next week's hearing, the judge said he wanted to consider the
type of questionnaire that would be sent to prospective jurors.
   Gesell said he also wanted to set a deadline for independent
counsel Lawrence E. Walsh to provide North's lawyers with the grand
jury testimony of the prosecution witnesses. The defense is entitled
to examine that testimony to prepare cross examination.
   Questionnaires are usually sent to jurors for lengthy or
high-profile criminal cases, such as the perjury trial of former
White House aide Michael K. Deaver.
   The questions are designed to screen out jurors who would be
unable to serve for a variety of reasons, including their inability
to render a fair verdict or to understand complicated evidence.
   The completed questionnaires would be used as a basis to conduct
jury selection in court.
   The North trial, which could last several months, may require the
court to order as many as 1,000 questionnaires to screen out people
who are unable to serve for the duration of the proceeding.
   The questionnaire would likely also ask prospective jurors
whether they could judge the evidence in the case free of any
influence from the extensive publicity that has surrounded the
Iran-Contra affair.

<HEAD>Examiners Told To Watch for Banks Too Heavily Involved in Buyouts</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The agency regulating nationally chartered
banks ordered its examiners on Thursday to look for banks that have
taken too big a chunk of the risky, but lucrative, business of
financing leveraged buyouts.
   The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, which regulates
about 4,400 of the nation's 14,000 commercial banks, issued a set of
guidelines for banks and government examiners to determine whether a
bank's safety is endangered by involvement in the buyouts, or LBOs.
   Comptroller Robert L. Clarke, in a memo to all national banks,
said LBOs are ``considerably more complex and characterized by
higher levels of risk than more traditional forms of commercial bank
lending.''
   But he acknowledged that LBOs have become an important source of
income for banks as their traditional source of income _
straightforward loans to corporations _ becomes more scarce.
   LBOs are ``a legitimate business activity, as long as a bank's
board of directoers and management follow prudent banking principles
and guard against unnecessary credit and legal risks,'' Clarke said.
   In an LBO, such as Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co.'s $25 billion
purchase of RJR Nabisco Inc., an investment group borrows heavily in
order to buy out stockholders and take over the company.
   The company's new owners either cut costs or sell off pieces of
the company to pay back the loans. Critics of the practice fear the
high debt levels in an economic downturn would endanger both the
company and the group or bank that lends the money.
   In guidelines issued to bank examiners, the comptroller stressed
diversification. He said a bank should have policies in place
ensuring it is not overly involved in LBOs, does not lend too much
to a single borrower and does not concentrate its lending to a
single industry.
   Banks also should have policies curbing potential conflicts of
interest in LBOs, to guard against getting sued by the losing
parties in takeover battles.
   ``These are fundamental elements of any sound credit process, but
they are especially important in view of the risk characteristics of
many'' LBOs, the guidelines said.
   The cautions apply equally to banks that originate the loans and
those that buy into the deals by participating through other,
larger, banks, they said.
   The comptroller began working on the LBO guidelines after
surveying the practices of 11 large money center banks and five
regional banks in late spring and early summer.
   According to Loan Pricing Corp., a New York company that monitors
large banks loans to corporations, banks have lent $70 billion in
highly leveraged transactions since mid-1987.
   Earlier this week, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., which
insures bank deposits up to $100,000, said a substantial but
undetermined amount of bank profits this year are coming from LBOs.
   Banks through the first nine months of this year reported record
profits of $16.4 billion and likely will have earned more than $23
billion by the end of the year, the FDIC said.

<HEAD>Court Denies Visitation Rights To Sperm Donor</HEAD>
<DATELINE>UTRECHT, Netherlands (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Dutch court on Thursday denied
visitation rights to a sperm donor who sued for permission to visit
his biological child, a court spokesman said.
   In the case, which has gained widespread national attention, a
man who donated his sperm to a woman in a lesbian relationship
sought the right to periodically meet the 15-month-old daughter born
as a result of the artificial insemination.
   The donor claimed that an ``emotional attachment'' to the child
developed over visits to the lesbian couple before and after the
birth.
   A month ago, the Utrecht court ruled that the father was entitled
``in principle'' to sue for his rights. But Dutch family law does
not contain specific provisions outlining the rights of sperm donors.
   The identities of both the plaintiff and the defendants in the
lawsuit were not disclosed for reasons of privacy, and court
hearings six weeks ago took place behind closed doors.
   In its ruling Thursday, the court said that ``in this particular
case, the tensions caused by periodical visits would be very
serious, and that is not in the interest of the child.''
   The ruling also said that ``in cases such as this, visitation
rights should only be granted in extraordinary circumstances.'' It
did not elaborate.
   During the hearings, the lesbian couple claimed that the
friendship with the donor had ended and that serious personal
conflicts had developed, according to their lawyer, Arnoud Willems.
   He added that the couple had rejected the idea of an anonymous
donor so that the father could be identified if the child later
would ask for his name.
   Artificial insemination by donated sperm is a widespread practice
in the Netherlands, but the strict confidentiality that prevents
identification of the parties involved usually precludes such legal
battles.

<TEXT>
   For the second consecutive year, flue-cured
tobacco farmers in 1989 will see a hefty boost in federal marketing
quotas, the Agriculture Department announced Thursday.
   Deputy Secretary Peter C. Myers said the 1989 flue-cured quota
will be 890.5 million pounds, up 18 percent from this year's 755
million pounds. The national acreage allotment will be increased to
426,485 acres from 379,588 acres in 1988.
   Allowing for overmarketings and undermarketings, the effective
quota for 1989 will be up by about 90 million pounds from this year.
   Myers said the flue-cured price support will be boosted to $1.468
per pound, an increase of 2.6 cents from 1988.
   The basic quota was increased on the 1988 flue-cured tobacco crop
for the first time since 1975, according to USDA analysts,
reflecting a draw-down on stockpiles and brisk demand.
   Myers said flue-cured tobacco farmers will vote in a mail
referendum to be held Jan. 9-12 on whether to continue federal
marketing quotas for the following three years, 1990, 1991 and 1992.
A two-thirds majority will be required for the controls to continue.

<TEXT>
   A leading advocate for America's children on
Thursday urged President-elect Bush to make good on his campaign
promises to offer more government help to disadvantaged youth,
saying that eventually would save tax money as well as lives.
   Marian Wright Edelman, president of the private Children's
Defense Fund, said the 1988 elections brought children's needs into
the national spotlight, and that ``the debate over the next four to
eight years will be on the form, level and timetable'' of programs
to help youngsters and improve child care.
   In a speech to the National Press Club, Ms. Edelman said Bush's
campaign proposal for a $2.2 billion children's tax credit is a
``welcome supplement'' to the child care bill that was considered
but not enacted by the outgoing Congress.
   She noted Bush also called during the campaign for support of the
federal nutrition program for pregnant women and children, increased
Head Start education efforts, expanded Medicaid health coverage for
low-income families, and new education initiatives.
   ``I have confidence that he will keep his word,'' Ms. Edelman
said. ``... I look forward, on many occasions, beginning in the
State of the Union address, to his fulfilling it.''
   She said that failing to meet children's needs early in life
results in more costly problems later. ``At a time of massive
deficits, America cannot afford to waste resources by failing to
prevent and curb the deficits which cripple our children and cost
billions in later remedial and custodial dollars,'' she said.
   Ms. Edelman's remarks were excerpted from her organization's
upcoming report, ``A Children's Defense Budget: A Vision for
America's Children,'' to be released in January 1989.
   She recited a litany of troubling statistics about the levels of
children living in poverty, infant mortality, gaps in prenatal care,
low birthweight babies, children infected with the AIDS virus,
broken families and homelessness.
   But she added: ``This is, for all its shadows, not a gloom and
doom speech. It is a get-off-our-national-duff and save-our-future
speech.''
   Ms. Edelman said her organization's most immediate goals include:
health insurance for poor families, expanding the federal nutrition
program to cover all pregnant women, infants and children, making
Head Start available to all needy children, ensuring that all
children are fully immunized, making quality child care available to
all families, and increasing the minimum wage.
   ``We believe these goals are doable in four or five years and
should be pursued as fast as the delivery systems of these
successful programs can effectively serve more children,'' she said.
``The longer we wait the more children we will lose.''

   When Ivan Boesky returns to his mansion
after serving time for insider trading, there won't be a
Jeffersonian dome to greet him.
   The North Castle Zoning Board of Appeals voted 3-2 Wednesday
night to deny a request from Boesky's wife, Seema, to cap her
17-room Georgian home in Mount Kisco with a dome similar to the one
that tops Thomas Jefferson's Monticello home in Charlottesville, Va.
   Mrs. Boesky's plans were opposed by 11 neighbors.
   She needed special permission from the board because her plans
would have added a third floor to the house, which is at the center
of a 76-acre estate called Northview.
   North Castle zoning law limits buildings to 2{ stories.
   Those voting against the proposal said approval would have set an
undesirable precedent. Those supporting the dome said it would have
had little impact.
   Boesky paid a record $100 million fine in 1986 to settle federal
Securities and Exchange Commission charges of insider stock trading
and is serving a three-year prison term after pleading guilty in
April 1987 to a federal conspiracy charge. Boesky will be eligible
for parole in March.

   Leading members of Congress gave the new
opening between the United States and the Palestine Liberation
Organization a wary welcome Thursday and sought to reassure Israel
that U.S. officials will be alert to any PLO tricks.
   ``This is good news and the right path to follow,'' said Sen.
Claiborne Pell, D-R.I., chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations
Committee. ``I think we would best be very careful that the PLO
continue to show real seriousness and be wary of any deception.''
   Sen. George Mitchell, the newly elected Senate majority leader,
welcomed the U.S. move and called it a ``significant step toward
advancing the peace process.''
   ``It is consistent with what has been bipartisan American policy
for over a decade,'' Mitchell, D-Maine, said in a statement. ``Under
that policy, the U.S. seeks to encourage direct negotiations between
the parties, without preconditions, intended to achieve a stable and
lasting peace.''
   Mitchell said PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat's acceptance of Israel's
right to exist and renunciation of terrorism were ``important
statements'' but ``in light of the PLO's record ... must be viewed
with caution.''
   He added that the U.S. action ``in no way represents or implies
... recognition of an independent Palestinian state'' and reaffirmed
``strong and unwavering support'' for Israel's security.
   The current Senate majority leader, Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., called
the opening ``a diplomatic turn of events that should not go
unrecognized. It is an opportunity that must be pushed forward
despite the risks.''
   Byrd added: ``As Israel's real friends, it is time to recognize
the shift in posture by the PLO. Our commitment to Israel is firm
and unswerving. But it must be tempered by the realization that
there are times when we must take those first tenuous steps toward
peace.''
   Rep. Dante Fascell, D-Fla., chairman of the House Foreign Affairs
Committee, also sought to reassure Israel, saying the U.S. dialogue
with the PLO does not mean any lessening of U.S. economic and
military support to its ally.
   ``It will ... take more than words to convince Israel,'' Fascell
said. ``Only the Israelis can determine what is best for their own
security. So it should also be made very clear that there will be no
attempt to impose a settlement on Israel.''
   Continued aid to Israel, the top recipient of U.S. assistance, is
necessary both to calm Israeli fears and ``as a clear signal to the
PLO and other parties that the United States is committed firmly to
the independence of Israel within secure borders,'' he said.
   Another staunch Israel supporter and Foreign Affairs Committee
member, Rep. Howard Berman, D-Calif., said he believed Secretary of
State George Shultz was sincere in believing the opening would
advance the cause of Middle East peace.
   ``I remain highly distrustful of the PLO and of Mr. Arafat,''
Berman said in an interview. ``A carefully worded and hedged
statement (in Geneva) has to be put into the light of 20 years of
terrorism and commitment to the destruction of Israel. I remain
highly skeptical about the PLO's intentions.''
   But Berman added, ``I think we should put those intentions to a
test.'' Moves to call off the Palestinian uprising in the West Bank
and Gaza, and a rewriting of the PLO charter to eliminate a pledge
to destroy Israel would help prove the organization's good faith, he
said.
   ``It's a risky move. I hope what we've done here contributes to
negotiations towards peace,'' he said. ``You cannot simply operate
on the basis that the status quo can go on in perpetuity.''
   Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., said the change in U.S. policy
``may well be a historic step on the road to lasting peace in the
Middle East. Only time will tell whether the PLO is genuinely
prepared to live up the far-reaching conditions they have now
accepted.''
   ``It's a very positive thing,'' said Sen. John Chafee, R-R.I.
``There are two parties to the conflict out there, the Israelis and
the Palestinians. To not talk to one of the groups is to ignore
reality.''

   Palestinians elated by the U.S. decision to talk
to the PLO celebrated in the streets Thursday and credited their
year-old uprising against Israeli rule for the change in U.S. policy.
   But Moslem fundamentalists rejected the decision as an American
deception, threatening to deepen divisions among Palestinians in the
occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip. ``America is Israel, and Israel
is America,'' said Gaza City prayer leader Ahmed Yassin.
   Washington's move failed to stop anti-Israeli protests in the
occupied lands. Sixteen Palestinians were wounded in clashes with
Israeli troops, including an 11-year-old shot with a plastic bullet
in the right eye, Arab hospital officials said.
   The wounded also included a 23-year-old Palestinian who suffered
a serious gunshot wound to the liver in the Gaza Strip town of Rafah.
   The army confirmed two of the wounded and said it was checking
further.
   Dozens of Palestinians marched through the streets of the West
Bank city of Ramallah, chanting pro-PLO slogans and carrying banners
reading ``Yes to the PLO'' and ``Yes to the Palestinian state.''
   A slogan sprayed on a wall in Ramallah read: ``The American
position is a victory for the uprising and Palestinian diplomacy.''
   Residents of Gaza City also expressed elation. ``Finally, the
Americans are realizing that there is a Palestinian people,'' said a
35-year-old man who refused to give his name.
   The sentiments were echoed by Palestinian leaders.
   ``The uprising has succeeded beyond our expectations by changing
the political climate,'' said Hanna Siniora, a PLO supporter and
editor of the daily Al Fajr newspaper in Arab east Jerusalem.
   Siniora said Palestinians in the occupied lands had put the PLO
leadership under great pressure to translate the uprising into
political gains, and this pressure led to recent PLO statements of
moderation.
   ``All of a sudden, we were able to say publicly what we had been
saying privately before: `Let's recognize Israel,''' Siniora told
The Associated Press.
   Clear recognition of Israel was one of three conditions set by
Washington for talks with the PLO. The others were renunciation of
terror and acceptance of U.N. resolutions recognizing the right of
all nations in the region to live within secure borders.
   Siniora acknowledged that Palestinians were deeply divided over
the next steps. ``The road to peace is full of obstacles, such as
the opposition of hardliners on both sides,'' he said.
   Moslem fundamentalists and hard-line PLO factions refuse to
recognize Israel. They say all of Israel should be returned to
Palestinian control.
   Yassin, a prominent Moslem fundamentalist, said PLO chief Yasser
Arafat made too many concessions to win Washington's approval.
``Arafat gave everything to Israel, and he got nothing in return but
promises,'' the wheelchair-bound prayer leader said in an interview.
   He also expressed skepticism over the new U.S. policy. ``To all
appearances, there is a change in American policy, but deep inside,
there is nothing new,'' he said.
   But other Palestinians said the U.S. decision marked a
breakthrough in the stalled Middle East peace process, and they
urged Israel to end its refusal to talk with the PLO.
   ``I think the Americans will pressure Israel, and the world
cannot live with (Prime Minister Yitzhak) Shamir's stubbornness,''
said Saeed Kanaan, a PLO supporter and businessman in Nablus. ``No
doubt, Israel is going to be isolated.''

   A late 18th century letter from George Washington
to critics of a treaty with Britain sold for $27,450 Thursday,
Sotheby's auction house reported.
   Bidders paid more than $1.9 million for a range of historical
letters and manuscripts but a collection of U.S. presidential
autographs was not sold because it failed to reach the minimum set
by the seller, Sotheby's said.
   Washington's letter was sent in 1795 to a group of officials
protesting a treaty John Jay negotiated to settle differences
remaining after the Revolutionary War.
   Jay's treaty was criticized because the British continued
violating the Treaty of Paris.
   ``I cannot but hope, that experience will shew, that the public
interest required the course which has been pursued,'' the first
president wrote to the officials.
   Quaritch, a London firm of book dealers, bought the letter, and
also paid $4,220 for autographed memorabilia of President William H.
Taft about American Jews traveling in Russia in 1911.
   In 1913, the United States broke its treaty with Russia over the
terms under which American Jews could visit that. The Russian
government said they could visit only on business.
   According to the Sotheby's catalogue, the two letters and series
of notes ``give a fascinating insight into the thought processes
involved in White House decision-making'' on the matter.
   The collection of presidential autographs, from George Washington
to Lyndon Johnson, did not reach its minimum value of $57,000-76,000.

   Patrick Ryan boasts of his skill in electronics,
carpentry, mechanics and welding, and he made a mark in the Roman
Catholic Church by raising money for African missions.
   Those were the talents, according to the British government, that
the Roman Catholic priest brought to the deadly work of the Irish
Republican Army.
   Ryan, it is alleged in extradition warrants rejected by Belgium
and then by Ireland, conspired to commit murder and cause explosions
in Britain between 1975 and 1988.
   According to press reports attributed to British government
sources, Ryan supplied the timers for scores of bombs and solicited
cash and gold from Libya's Moammar Gadhafi.
   A lean, clean-shaven man with a receding hairline, the
58-year-old Ryan is said by his brother Joe to able to speak nine
languages and fly airplanes and run six miles a day.
   ``I am a member generally of the Catholic church,'' Ryan said
recently. ``I have been a member of the Pioneer Total Abstinence
Association since the age of 12, and I am still a teetotaler.
   ``After that I belong to no other organization either overt or
covert.
   ``So, do I belong to the IRA? I did not, never have, am not, and
have no intention,'' he told the Tipperary Star on Nov. 28, his only
interview since his arrest.
   Ryan is the focus of a diplomatic impasse across the Irish Sea.
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher wants to put him on trial, but
Ireland's attorney general, John Murray, concluded that the priest
could not get a fair trial in Britain.
   Ryan vowed that he will never stand before a British court, and
staged a 22-day hunger strike in Belgium after the British sought
his extradition.
   Ryan was born June 26, 1930 in Rossmore, County Tipperary, one of
six children in a farming family.
   He attended the Christian Brothers school and the Pallottine
College in nearby Thurles, and was ordained June 6, 1954.
   ``While he was with us, we could see a man who was zealous,
hard-working and very orthodox,'' said the Rev. Donal McCarthy,
rector of the students' house of the Pallottine Fathers of Thurles.
``In many ways he could have been an idealist.''
   The young priest was assigned to mission work in the diocese of
Mbulu in Tanzania, where he was involved in well-digging projects.
His colleagues, according to The Sunday Times, recalled him as a
pastor who cared both for the spiritual and economic needs of his
flock.
   In 1967, Ryan was assigned as a curate in an east London church.
In 1970 he returned to Ireland to promote African missions.
   At that time, Ryan reportedly became preoccupied with the
struggles in Northern Ireland, where the mainly Catholic IRA has
waged an armed campaign against British rule.
   In 1973, Ryan rejected a transfer to a church in England.
   ``He told me at that time that he felt in conscience bound to
work for the dependents of prisoners and those who had died in
Northern Ireland,'' said the Rev. William Hanly, the Pallottine
provincial in Dublin.
   Ryan said in the Star interview that: ``I would travel through
the airports principally of Paris and Rome to various parts of the
world collecting a few pence _ more than a few pence, a lot of
money.''
   ``But I found that I would be just stopped at a frontier ... and
I would be given no reason other than `you can't pass.' So I decided
if I couldn't pass one way I was going to pass another way.'' Thus,
he said, he traveled on a forged passport.
   According to British authorities, one of Ryan's contributions to
the IRA was discovering a gadget called Memopark, a timer intended
to remind a motorist when the parking meter expired.
   Ryan allegedly bought every Memopark, some 400 of them, in stock
at a novelty shop in Zurich, Switzerland in 1975. Subsequently,
British sources have said, remains of the timers were found at the
scene of 185 bombings in Northern Ireland and three in London.
   Ryan was arrested in Geneva in 1976, and timers were found in his
possession.
   Ryan also went free when Scotland Yard was unable to develop
evidence that he had committed any offense on Swiss soil.
   He was arrested, and freed, again in France in December 1976, in
Italy in February 1977 and in Luxembourg the next month.
   Ryan's last arrest was on June 30 in Brussels. Belgian police
said they found found timers, circuitry and manuals about bombs in
his possession.
   ``In my living room they found all kinds of books,'' Ryan told
the Star. ``I am an excellent mechanic, very good with electronics,
a good plumber, carpenter, welder. I have a variety of books on all
these subjects. I have also books on music as I play the mandolin
and banjo.''

   A wayward ball from a cricket match set
off ethnic fights in which six people were killed, authorities in
this southern port said Thursday.
   Police and witnesses said the trouble started Wednesday when some
Mohajirs, Moslem immigrants from India, hit a cricket ball into a
house owned by Pathans, an ethnic Pakistani group.
   A youth who tried to retrieve the ball was beaten and died of
head injuries, and news of his death prompted clashes Thursday at a
juncture of e Pathan and Mohajir neighborhoods in central Karachi,
the reports said.
   Hospital officials reported the death toll.
   Security forces patrolled the streets Thursday night and there
were no further reports of fighting.
   Mohajirs, who complain of discrimination, and Pathans, originally
from northwestern Pakistan, have battled repeatedly for a decade.
Nearly 300 were killed in December 1986 during riots in Karachi, a
city of 9 million.

   Religious, professional and social
leaders urged the government on Thursday to postpone presidential
elections until a wave of ethnic violence that killed 109 people
this week subsides.
   At the same time, rival Sinhalese and Tamil guerrillas called for
boycott of Monday's election. Sinhalese extremists said the
government was incapable of conducting fair balloting, and
separatist Tamils blamed the two main candidates for violence that
has wracked this Indian Ocean island for five years.
   A military spokesman said Sinhalese radicals shot and stabbed to
death eight villagers in the south. He said the extremists left
scribbled warnings saying: ``This is the fate of government spies.''
   Later Thursday, soldiers captured an underground hide-out used by
the Sinhalese attackers, who have waged a campaign of terror and
intimidation to overthrow the government, the spokesman said. Four
rebels were killed and 23 surrendered, the spokesman said on
condition of anonymity, he said.
   A government statement said 21 prisoners were killed by police
after anti-government militants bombed open a wall of the
medium-security Welikade prison near Colombo on Tuesday night.
Earlier, officials said only two died.
   A total of 221 prisoners escaped but 133 were recaptured, the
statement said. The remainder remain free.
   The United Organization for Peace and Democracy, an umbrella for
30 professional, religious and social groups, said President Junius
R. Jayewardene should call off the elections because of the
escalating violence.
   Jayewardene, a Sinhalese, is prohibited by law from seeking a
third six-year term. The 82-year-old leader has said he will
dissolve Parliament and step aside Tuesday. Opposition leaders say
that will be too late.
   Sri Lanka has 9.3 million eligible voters among its 16 million
people.
   Sinhalese extremists say the government's peace accord with
Tamils grants too many concessions to the minority people who have
been fighting for a separate homeland in the north and east. Nearly
10,000 people have died since the war started in 1983.
   Predominantly Hindu Tamils, who are 18 percent of the island's
population, contend they are denied jobs, education and money for
development by the Buddhist Sinhalese majority.
   The biggest and most militant Tamil group, the Liberation Tigers
of Tamil Eelam, said Thursday said the two main presidential
candidates _ Ramasinghe Premadasa of the governing United National
Party and Sirimavo Bandaranaike of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party _
``have been instrumental in creating the ethnic conflict and have
been responsible for the genocide of Tamils.''

   Former Rep. Michael Barnes of Maryland has
written top Democrats announcing his candidacy for chairman of the
national party, an aide said Thursday.
   Barnes, for eight years a congressman from suburban Washington,
D.C., becomes the fourth candidate in the race to succeed retiring
Democratic National Chairman Paul Kirk.
   Already in the race are Ronald Brown, former top aide to Jesse
Jackson; former Rep. James Jones of Oklahoma and Michigan state
party chairman Richard Wiener.
   ``The Democratic Party is a sometimes fragile coalition. Our next
chairman mnust be able to reach out to all elements of our party,
seek common ground and build consensus,'' Barnes said.
   He made the comment in a letter that aide Jeff Heller said was
sent Wednesday to the more than 400 members of the committee and
other top Democrats around the country. The DNC members are to vote
on a new chairman when they meet in Washington on Feb. 9 and 10.

<HEAD>Sugar Import Quota Boosted 17 Percent</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United States will allow a 17 percent
increase in the amount of raw sugar that can be imported from 39
foreign countries in 1989, the Agriculture Department announced
Thursday.
   Deputy Secretary Peter Meyers said next year's quota was set at
about 1.24 million short tons of 2,000 pounds each, up from about
1.06 million tons in calendar 1988.
   The Dominican Republic led the list with a 1989 allocation of
185,328 metric tons, followed by Philippines, 166,374, and Brazil,
152,685.
   Officials said the quota for Panama, 30,537 tons, ``is not
allowed to be shipped at this time'' and may later be allocated to
other countries, as was done last July with Panama's 1988 quota.
   Reduced production because of this year's drought and rising
demand were the main reasons for boosting the quota so sharply,
officials said.
   In metric tons, which have about 2,205 pounds each, the 1989
quota will be almost 1.13 million tons. Metric units were used to
establish next year's quota to meet the terms of a new U.S. tariff
system, which will take effect Jan. 1.
   Alan Holmer, deputy U.S. trade representative, announced
country-by-country allocations for 1989. In metric tons, those
include:
   Argentina, 45,279.
   Barbados, 7,444.
   Bolivia, 8,424.
   Canada, 11,583.

<HEAD>Politburo Member Resigns</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Vasil Bilak, a member of the old
guard that supported the Soviet-led invasion of 1968, resigned from
the Politburo and his other Communist Party jobs Thursday, the party
announced.
   Another Politburo member, Josef Kempny, also stepped down.
   Bilak, 71, is a party ideologist linked to the late Soviet leader
Leonid I. Brezhnev and was believed to oppose economic reforms
favored by Lubomir Strougal, the premier who resigned in October.
   He was an associate of former party chief Gustav Husak, now the
figurehead president, and helped purge about 500,000 party members
after the invasion ended the liberal ``Prague spring'' in August
1968.
   The two resignations and the demotion of Central Committee
secretary Mikulas Beno were announced at the beginning of a two-day
plenum of the party Central Committee.
   Two Czechoslovak human rights activists, in a report sent to
authorities in May, said Bilak helped prepare the Warsaw Pact
invasion and accused him of treason.
   Bilak and two others were said to have urged the Soviets to
intervene against the reforms set in motion by Alexander Dubcek,
then the party chief. The others were the late Drahomir Kolder and
Alois Indra, who remains a Politburo member.
   In his letter of resignation, Bilak also gave up his posts as
Central Committee secretary and head of the committee's foreign
policy commission. Jan Fojtik replaced Bilak as chief party
ideologist earlier this year.
   Party chief Milos Jakes praised the two resigning Politburo
members for their party work.
   Addressing the plenum, he said Bilak's ``courage ... faithfulness
to the party, to the ideals of Marxism-Leninism (and) friendship
with the Soviet Union were fully proved in the difficult crisis
years and during the overcoming of their consequences.''
   The Central Committee is to discuss economic results in 1988 and
plans for next year.

   Ionita Olteanu, a leading Romanian

Germany, a Munich newspaper reported Thursday.
   The Sueddeutsche Zeitung said Olteanu was invited to Munich to
take part in a panel discussion on Bavarian television Tuesday. The
Romanian Embassy ordered him not to take part because Romanian
exiles and human rights activists also were participating, it said.
   Olteanu, editor of the Romanian business weekly magazine Revista
Economia, left his Munich hotel Wednesday and asked Bavarian
authorities for asylum, the paper reported.
   Late last week, Maria Cosma, 38, coach of the Romanian women's
gymnastics team, defected in Hamburg and is planning to apply for
political asylum, the West German Gymnastics Federation said.
   Ms. Cosma, who is expected to get a coaching job with the West
German women's gymnastics team, coached the Romanian women at the
Summer Olympics in Seoul and guided the team to an upset victory
over the Soviet Union at the 1987 World Championships in Rotterdam.

   Directors of a charitable foundation were accused
Thursday of siphoning off nearly $7 million to support their own
lavish habits, including chauffeured limousines, nights at the opera
and trips to Florida and Israel.
   In a lawsuit filed in state Supreme Court in Manhattan, state
Attorney General Robert Abrams said officials of the Nate B. and
Frances Spingold Foundation systematically looted the organization's
coffers from 1983 to 1988, depleting its assets by almost 50 percent.
   In particular, Abrams said James R. Halperin, the foundation's
chief administrative officer, took more than $5 million in salary to
perform ``simple administrative duties.''
   Abrams said Halperin _ and not the charities he was supposed to
support _ was the chief beneficiary of the foundation.
   Halperin, a Manhattan lawyer, allegedly billed the foundation at
a rate of $275 to $350 an hour for his services. His hours
increased, according to the attorney general's office, from an
average of 29 per week in 1984 to an average of 77 per week in 1986
and 1987.
   In its lawsuit, the attorney general's office demanded the
removal of Halperin and Melvyn Levitan as directors of the
foundation and demanded repayment of losses resulting from their
alleged misconduct.
   At Abrams' request, state Supreme Court Justice Carmen Bauchamp
Ciparick issued a temporary restraining order barring Halperin and
four other defendants from using any more of the foundation's funds.
   Calls to the foundation for comment were referred to Halperin's
lawyer, Gerald Shargel, who was in court and could not immediately
be reached.
   According Abrams' office, the Spingold foundation was established
in 1955 by Nate B. and Frances Spingold to make contributions to
charitable, educational and religious organizations.
   The foundation's assets have decreased from $12.5 million in 1983
to $6.4 million this year, his office said. No figures were
available on how much the foundation gave to organizations during
that period.
   Nate Spingold died in 1958; his wife and her son, Herbert
Levitan, supervised the foundation until both of them died of
natural causes in 1976.
   Halperin has served as director and chief administrative officer
of the foundation since 1975, while Melvyn Levitan, Mrs. Spingold's
grandson, has been a director since 1977 and president of the
foundation since July 1987.
   The others named in the suit are Nedda Strasbourger, Frimi
Mendlowitz and Adrienne Halperin.
   According to an affidavit filed by Abrams' office, the
defendants' alleged excesses included dinners; a trip by Halperin
and his wife to Florida; the purchase of an unneeded luxury office
for the foundation; and a trip to Israel.
   In addition, the affidavit charged that Halperin leased
automobiles, including a Mercedes and a Cadillac, at foundation
expense, and that he and other directors allegedly hired chauffeured
limousines to take them ``to the theater, opera and ballet, and to
department stores for shopping, gala benefits, and airports.''

   Canada ordered on Thursday that a

delay deportation for years.
   The decision by an immigration adjudicator in Hamilton concluded
an 11-month deportation hearing for Mahmoud Mohammad Issa Mohammad,
convicted in Greece of manslaughter and other charges in connection
with a raid on an Israeli airliner at the Athens airport in 1968.
   He received a 17-year sentence in 1970 but was released later
that year after Palestinian terrorists seized a Greek airliner and
the release of Mohammad and six other prisoners. Mohammad, 46, came
to Canada in February 1987.
   Canada sought his deportation on grounds he lied on his
application for residency by not mentioning his criminal record and
membership in the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine.
   Mohammad has said he wants to put his past behind him and is
claiming refugee status. He lives in Brantford, Ontario, with his
wife and three children and works as a construction subcontractor.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The life expectancy for blacks has dropped for
two consecutive years for the first time since 1970, when mortality
data was first broken down by race, according to a federal report.
   While the white population experienced an increase in life
expectancy, to a record high of 75.4 years, from 1985 to 1986, the
black rate declined to 69.4 years, the same level as in 1982.
   Despite that most recent two-year decline, the report notes that
``the largest gain in life expectancy between 1970 and 1986 was for
both black males and females, 5.2 years, followed by white males, 4
years, and white females, 3.2 years.''
   The annual figures, released recently by the National Center for
Health Statistics, are derived from comparing U.S. Bureau of the
Census data with death certificates filed in the 50 states and
District of Columbia.
   The 55-page report, which contains dozens of tables breaking down
death rates in a variety of ways such as age and sex in addition to
race, makes no attempt at explaining any of the trends shown by the
figures.
   However, the tables show there was a 15 percent increase in
homicides among blacks between 1985 and 1986, compared to a 5
percent increase among whites.
   Homicide was the fifth leading cause of death among black males
and the ninth leading cause of death among black females in 1986.
Homicide was not among the top 10 causes of death for either white
males or females.
   Accidents, the fourth leading cause of death overall, increased 8
percent among blacks and 4 percent among whites.
   Death rates among blacks were lower in 1986 than the previous
year for heart disease, cerebrovascular diseases, chronic liver
disease and cirrhosis, atherosclerosis, nephritis, nephrotic
syndrome and nephrosis and congenital anomalities.
   Overall, the death rate for blacks was 1.5 times that of whites
in 1986, with wide fluctuations among the 15 causes of death. For
example, blacks were half as likely to commit suicide as whites and
5.8 times more likely to die from homicide.
   Blacks were 1.2 times more likely to die accidentally than
whites, but slightly less likely to die in an automobile accident.
   The only other category where the 1986 death rate was lower among
blacks than whites was pulmonary disease and associated conditions.

<HEAD>Former HHS Official, Others Sued in Speechwriting Case</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government on Thursday accused former
Health and Human Services Department official C. McClain Haddow, a
former speechwriter and their wives of submitting false claim and
conflicts of interest.
   A civil suit filed in U.S. District Court alleged that Haddow,
with the assistance of Gordon Jones of Springfield, Va., arranged to
have HHS award a half-dozen contracts for writing speeches for
then-HHS Secretary Margaret Heckler to Jones' wife, Susan, and the
couple's company, Jones Ink Inc.
   The speeches were actually written by Alice Haddow or other
people and $21,790 paid by HHS to the Joneses was passed on to the
Haddows, the complaint alleged. Haddow at the time was chief of
staff to Mrs. Heckler.
   The suit said that Haddow and Jones ``knowingly caused to be
submitted to HHS'' a form saying that Mrs. Jones had done editing
and speechwriting and had performed those duties for congressional
and senatorial clients when she had not done so.
   Jones, now a senior fellow at the Heritage Foundation, a
conservative think tank in Wshington, declined to comment on the
suit.
   In July 1987, Haddow pleaded guilty to conflicts of interest
involving an organization known as the T. Bear Foundation Inc., and
the speechwriting matters. He served three months in prison before
being released last May.
   In addition, the suit said that from November 1984 to October
1985 Haddow and his wife secretly arranged to receive $33,540 of
$37,400 in payments made by the T. Bear Foundation to Magoon and
Associates, a company hired to perform fund-raising activities.
Haddow was a member of the foundation's board.
   The suit seeks $75,990 in treble damages and $70,000 in civil
penalties for the speechwriting in addition to the $33,540 that the
Haddows allegedly received from the proceeds of the T. Bear
Foundation contract.

   Rep. Bill Young had a busy speaking schedule in
the first weeks of 1987, jetting to places like Atlanta, Los
Angeles, Dallas and Seattle as part of the multimillion-dollar
congressional honoraria circuit.
   Between Jan. 5 and Feb. 6, the Florida Republican made 18
speeches, all of them to major defense contractors who have more
than passing interest in hearing from a member of a House
Appropriations subcommittee that has a major role in Pentagon
spending.
   The whirlwind schedule was not without its reward: $29,000 in
speaking fees from the likes of Rockwell, Lockheed and Boeing, an
amount that the Census Bureau says is just $1,853 below what the
median U.S. household collected in income for all of 1987.
   Young didn't keep all of his earnings. His financial disclosure
statement says he gave $3,200 to charity, which brought his
speechmaking net to $25,800, or $84 less than House rules allowed
him to keep. He made no more for-pay speeches after Feb. 6.
   Harry Glenn, Young's press secretary, said Thursday the
lawmaker's honoraria appearances were lumped together because he
only schedules them during times when Congress either is not in
session or has a light schedule, as generally occurs in January. He
said Young generally works a 7 a.m.-10 p.m. day while on these
visits, meeting with company officials and touring plants, not just
speaking for a fee. ``He learned something from these trips,'' Glenn
said.
   Young is not unique among the 390 representatives and 87 senators
who in 1987 pulled in $9.8 million on the honoraria circuit _ a
controversial perk being targeted for oblivion by reformers, a
federal pay commission and influential lawmakers like House Speaker
Jim Wright, D-Texas.
   The commission said that public faith in the integrity of
Congress is threatened by the steady growth in honoraria, which rose
30 percent from 1986 to 1987.
   ``The only principled argument that can be made for the practice
of accepting honoraria is that official salaries are far too low and
must be supplemented for a public official to meet his family
obligations,'' the panel said.
   Its recommendation to the White House and Congress: ban honoraria
and raise congressional pay from $89,500 a year to $135,000.
   The champion honoraria earner for 1987 was Rep. Dan Rostenkowski,
D-Ill., the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, the panel that
originates most tax legislation in Congress.
   Rostenkowski is so much in demand by a broad segment of
businesses, industries and trade associations that his 22 paid
appearances in January 1987 brought in $76,500 in honoraria.
   Even though the powerful chief tax-writer of the House had taken
in more than nearly three times the $25,884 that House rules allowed
him to keep, Rostenkowski didn't withdraw from the 1987 honoraria
circuit.
   He kept talking, and by year's end his voice had brought in
$245,000 _ $25,844 for Dan Rostenkowski, $219,156 for the LaVerne
and Dan Rostenkowski Charity Fund.
   A spokesman says the fund's money was distributed about 50-50
among Chicago and non-Chicago health, ethnic, religious and
educational groups with bona fide charity status. Rostenkowski
doesn't release their names.
   ``We've been running a Robin Hood program _ taking from the tax
lawyers and giving to the poor,'' says the spokesman, who declined
to be quoted by name.
   In 1987, $2.25 million of the $9.8 million in congressional
honoraria ended up going to charities and nonprofit institutions _
an income source that could dry up if the White House and Congress
accept the pay commission's plan.
   Rostenkowski's spokesman says the chairman will continue his
philanthropy even if Congress votes to abolish speaking fees, which
are frequently paid by groups with a financial stake in a particular
lawmaker's committee and floor votes.
   The spokesman says Rostenkowski will help his favorite charities
raise money by volunteering to be a drawing card at their
fund-raising events.
   Rostenkowski was one of three lawmakers who went into six digits
on the 1987 honoraria circuit. In second place with $118,588 was
Budget Committee Chairman Bill Gray, D-Pa., who gave $94,938 to
charity. Third was Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan.,
$106,050, with $80,000 to charity. Both Gray and Dole kept less for
themselves than Capitol Hill rules permit.
   The House lets members keep honoraria earnings up to 30 percent
of official salary, or $26,850. In the Senate, the factor is 40
percent, or $35,800. In 1987, 44 senators took in less than this
amount. Twenty-six of them listed no charitable contributions on
their disclosure forms.
   The new Senate majority leader, George Mitchell, D-Maine, was
above average in honoraria earnings and below average in giving to
charity. He took in $42,225, about $6,000 above the norm, and gave
away $7,350, about $2,000 below the average senator's giving.
   One senator who will be able to watch next year's pay-honoraria
debate with detachment is Dan Quayle, R-Ind., who as vice president
will fall under the existing ban on paid speechmaking by the
executive branch and the judiciary.
   In 1987, Quayle was more active on the honoraria circuit than the
average senator. He collected $49,255, kept $34,953 and gave $14,302
to charity.

   The United States and China signed a four-year
maritime agreement Thursday that will ensure access of each nation's
vessels to the ports of the other.
   The two nations also pledged their intention to provide for the
sharing of cargo carriage in two-way trade, the Department of

   Vessels of each nation would be assured of at least a third of
all such cargoes, it said.
   Under the agreement, U.S.-flag vessels may enter 40 Chinese ports
upon 24 hours advance notice, and Chinese vessels will have the same
access to all but 12 U.S. ports.
   ``This agreement, which caps a five-year effort to improve
U.S.-China maritime relations, will provide new opportunities for
U.S. carriers serving China,'' said Transportation Secretary Jim
Burnley.
   Signing for China was Minister of Communications Qian Yongchang.
   Meanwhile, Sea-Land Corp. announced it will open shipping offices
in Shanghai, Tainjin and Dalian.

<HEAD>Italian Prime Minister Praises U.S. PLO Decision</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Italian Prime Minister Ciriaco De Mita, with
President Reagan at his side, on Thursday praised the U.S. decision
to talk with the Palestine Liberation Organization.
   De Mita, paying a farewell call on the retiring president, told
reporters through an interpreter that he thought Reagan's decision
``helps to work toward the solution of a delicate problem.''
   ``And now, talks will help us understand the conditions that are
there for negotiations,'' he said. ``The decision of the American
government is very important because it solves the problem of
finding a counterpart'' to talk for the Palestinian side, de Mita
said.
   Attending De Mita's meeting with Reagan were Secretary of State
George Shultz and national security adviser Colin Powell.
President-elect George Bush and Vice President-elect Dan Quayle
later had lunch with the allied leader.
   At their meeting, Reagan thanked De Mita again for the Italian
decision to provide a new home for a 72-plane Air Force fighter wing
that is being relocated from Spain, White House spokesman Marlin
Fitzwater said.
   Most of the meeting was about Soviet President Mikhail
Gorbachev's meeting with Reagan in New York, Gorbachev's U.N.
speech, ``the need for NATO unity'' and efforts to correct the
imbalance between NATO and Soviet bloc conventional forces, he added.
   De Mita told a news conference afterwards that the United Nations
had prepared a decision on how to deal with the Middle East, but the
decision had been paralyzed by the lack of an acceptable spokesman
for the Palestinians. The U.S. decision to negotiate with the PLO
was a way around the obstacle, he added.
   Asked what his advice to Israel would be at this moment, he
replied: ``Be serene. Neither the Italian nor the European position
favors one side against the other.''
   The Italian government favors a negotiated solution to the
conflict, he said.
   De Mita added that recent decisions by the Palestine National
Council in Algiers were contested by many Arabs and that the
statements of PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat were risky.
   Foreign Minister Giulio Andreotti, who joined De Mita at the news
conference, said Wednesday's events had made it clear to those in
Israeli-occupied territory that the calmer they remain, the better
the results will be.

   A dozen children and teen-agers seemed
to be enjoying themselves Thursday rummaging through boxes of
clothes and toys. But the laughter and the smiles vanished as they
remembered they didn't have a home or parents to return to.
   Eight days after an earthquake in northwestern Armenia sundered
homes and families, officials can only guess at the number of
children killed or left orphans.
   Many survivors are having nightmares, and the Soviet Children's
Fund, a charity, sent a team of 11 child psychologists to Armenia to
help.
   ``Who has trouble sleeping?'' psychologist Valeria Mukhina asked
the group of children, whose parents are dead or missing.
   Nearly all raised their hands and yelled, ``I do, I do!''
   The therapy session had begun.
   The youngsters, from seven to 15 years old, were sitting in a
recital hall of Yerevan's music conservatory. The building was
converted into a children's relief center and the hall was filled
with donated toys and clothes.
   ``Sit back and close your eyes,'' the pscychologist told the
children. ``Frightening pictures may come to you. But forget about
everything. Force yourself to see the best: the sky, birds.'' The
children broke in with their own suggestions: flowers, a warm sun.
   Their eyes still closed, children were told to imagine themselves
in a forest and told to care for dolls they had just received.
Mukhina seemed to be trying to establish the dolls as a symbol of
security to replace that which was lost with the disappearance of
their parents.
   ``Hold the doll, which loves you,'' she said, pushing the new
toys into the children's embrace. ``Take care of the dolls. Lead
them into the world. Keep everything frightening away from your
doll.'
   Then she concluded: ``When I count to three you will say goodbye
to your forest and tonight you will rejoin it and sleep peacefully.
   The suggestion worked so well that 12-year-old Lena Chudliny
didn't open her eyes again when the count ended. But when she woke
up, the shock of the quake returned and she began to cry.
   Albert Likhanov, head of the Children's Fund, was watching and
went over to embrace Lena and comfort her.
   Lena's 15-year-old brother Ruslan told in a matter-of-fact way
what he could not get out of his mind.
   ``We had an English class. We sat writing. The teacher said
tomorrow there will be a quiz. Then everything started to shake,''
Ruslan said, recalling when the quake struck his hometown of
Leninakan at 11:41 a.m.
   ```Let's get out!' we shouted,'' Ruslan said.
   A classmate of Ruslan's, who identified himself as Saak,
described how the class managed to get outside and saw one entire
class crushed as they tumbled from the third floor to the ground.
   Soldiers later pulled up in a tank and took the students away.
Ruslan said he doesn't know what happened to his parents.
   In an interview, Mukhina explained that she tries to help the
children cope with the tragedy by ``replacing negative emotions with
good thoughts.'' But she said the process is likely to take years.
   In the meantime the children are staying in a Yerevan school,
playing with their new toys and going to movies and concerts.
Authorities are arranging longer term care in sanitariums throughout
the Soviet Union, said Simon Alexanyants, an Armenian doctor
specializing in child health care.
   Some Armenians say the children should be kept in the small
southern republic of Armenia rather than being sent out to other
parts of the Soviet Union. But Alexanyants said all eventually will
return.

   Nicaraguan soldiers fired on
Honduran patrols three times this month in ``provocative'' attacks
along the border, the government said Thursday.
   Foreign Minister Carlos Lopez Contreras sent a protest note to
Nicaraguan Foreign Minister Miguel d'Escoto.
   There was no immediate response from Nicaragua.
   Lopez listed these inidents, without mentioning casualties:
   _Dec. 7: Nicaraguan troops attacked a Honduran patrol with
grenades and rifle fire near Walpauanta, but the two soldiers and
two civilians did not return fire.
   In a separate incident the same day, 24 Nicaraguan soldiers in a
boat on the Coco River tossed grenades and fired rifles at a
Honduran patrol near Prensa and the patrol fired back.
   _Dec. 11: A Sandinista patrol exchanged rifle fire with Honduran
soldiers in the Teotecacinte border post.
   The protest said the attacks ``appear to indicate that the
Sandinista Popular Army is looking for another front to execute its
provocative actions that in no way contribute to lowering tensions
in border areas.''
   Gen. Humberto Regalado Hernandez, Honduran mlitary commander,
said Thursday he and the defense chiefs of Guatemala and El Salvador
agreed in recent meetings that Nicaragua was impeding regional
peace. He did not say when the meetings took place.
   ``We've met and reached the conclusion that the road to peace in
Central America runs through Managua,'' the Nicaraguan capital, he
told reporters.
   Relations between Honduras and Nicaragua became strained after
U.S.-supported Nicaraguan rebels, known as Contras, began their war
against ther leftist Sandinista government in 1981. The rebels have
bases on Honduran territory.

<HEAD>Government Threatens Aid Cutoff Over Cleveland Pollution</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KATHERINE RIZZO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Environmental Protection Agency on Thursday
gave Ohio officials two months to adopt an automobile pollution
inspection plan for the Cleveland area or face a cutoff of $20
million in federal highway funds.
   Unless the state Legislature complies with the federal Clean Air
Act by ordering tailpipe inspections in populous Cuyahoga County,
which includes Cleveland, federal highway money to the county will
be blocked 60 days after the order is published in the Federal
Register.
   In addition, carbon monoxide-spewing smokestack industries will
be denied new construction permits, and air pollution control grants
to Ohio will be reduced by $64,000 under the sanctions given final
EPA approval.
   If those penalties don't prod state lawmakers into enacting a
tailpipe inspection bill, the EPA is ready to wield yet another
club: the loss of sewage construction grant money, perhaps $20
million worth.
   Spokeswomen for Gov. Richard Celeste and the state Environmental
Protection Agency said avoiding the sanctions has become a top
priority for the new year.
   ``We are working with the governor's office on draft legislation
which we hope to introduce as early as possible in January,'' Ohio
EPA spokeswoman Jennifer Lane Maier said. ``I would give the federal
government what they've asked for.''
   Press Secretary Debra Phillips said the governor believes there
is time to beat the 60-day deadline.
   State Sen. Lee Fisher, a Cleveland Democrat, agreed. He predicted
the penalties would force the Legislature to enact a tailpipe
testing bill, though ``with a lot of kicking and screaming.''
   ``Ohio will come into compliance,'' he said. ``We can't afford to
lose those funds.''
   Cuyahoga County was singled out because of violations of federal
air pollution standards, specifically levels of carbon monoxide.
   In high concentrations, the poisonous gas can cause dizziness,
nausea, blurred vision, headaches and delayed reaction times.
   Tailpipe inspections are considered an effective antidote for
high carbon monoxide levels because 85 percent of the gas comes from
the exhaust fumes of cars and trucks.
   Though no other U.S. city currently is suffering the loss of
highway construction money, there are about 10 other areas under
construction bans, including Cincinnati's Kentucky suburbs, Chicago
and some of its suburbs, Albuquerque, N.M., and St. Cloud, Minn.,
EPA spokesman Chris Rice said.
   Highway funding sanctions were lifted recently against
Albuquerque after a year and a half; four areas in California were
under the same restrictions for nearly two years, but those also
have been lifted, he said.
   Even with the sanctions, many highway projects will continue to
get their full federal funding because the government doesn't
withhold money for safety improvements and projects that have a
beneficial effect on air quality.

<HEAD>Opposition Says British Intelligence Agency Among The Worst</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The opposition Labor Party on Thursday derided MI5,
Britain's counter-intelligence agency, as one of the worst secret
services in the West and said it has a long history of recruiting
and promoting Soviet agents.
   ``It has made itself ridiculous because it believes it is above
scrutiny,'' said Labor deputy leader Roy Hattersley.
   Hattersley spoke during a parliamentary debate on a bill proposed
by the Conservative government of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher
to license bugging and break-ins by the agency.
   The Security Services Bill will give a basis in law for the first
time to the 79-year-old agency, whose existence successive
governments long refused even to acknowledge.
   Hattersley's attack reflected complaints by the opposition and
civil liberties groups that the bill fails to provide any
parliamentary control over MI5. Its chiefs will continue to report
secretly to the prime minister and the home secretary.
   The agency became the focus of renewed public attention during a
three-year court battle, which the government finally lost this
year, to suppress the memoirs of ex-agent Peter Wright. His book
``Spycatcher'' includes charges that MI5 tried to destabilize a
Labor government.
   Several Soviet agents from the British upper classes _ Kim
Philby, Guy Burgess, Donald Maclean and Anthony Blunt _ were
recruited at Cambridge University in the 1930s to work for the
British secret services. MI5 and MI6, its sister
intelligence-gathering agency, have been dogged by subsequent spy
scandals.
   The European Court of Human Rights is hearing complaints arising
from charges in 1985 that MI5 agents tapped the telephones of
anti-nuclear campaigners and labor union leaders on the instructions
of Cabinet ministers.
   Home Secretary Douglas Hurd on Thursday denied that MI5 is
``locked in some time warp of the 1950s, forever fighting shadows
that have long since disappeared.''
   But he refused to comment on whether agents have tapped labor
leaders' telephones. ``I am not going to comment on past
operations,'' he said.
   Under the bill, agents will require a warrant, now unnecessary,
from Hurd to bug or break into property, and an independent
commissioner will monitor the granting of warrants.
   The bill also provides for a tribunal of lawyers to hear
complaints from people who suspect they are targets of improper
surveillance. But critics charge official secrecy laws ban revealing
the activities of the secret services.

<TEXT>
   Solidarity's Lech Walesa said Thursday that
he sees increasing prospects for agreement with the communist
government, perhaps through long-awaited ``round table'' talks that
would include his banned union movement and the church.
   ``There is a chance now. I don't know if it is honest or just a
fake. But I cannot destroy it. There are many new elements which we
must notice,'' Walesa said at his first news conference since
returning from France on Monday.
   Polish leader Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski meanwhile told a Communist
Party audience, ``We are looking for roads of still wider national
reconciliation.
   ``There is still only one criterion: a feeling of responsiblity
for the country and the good of Poland,'' Jaruzelski said in a
speech Thursday marking the party's 40th anniversary.
   Parts of Walesa's news conference were broadcast Thursday night
on state-controlled television, the first time his weekly meeting
with reporters was treated by the TV as a normal news event.
   Walesa said Solidarity, the independent union movement in the
Soviet bloc, remains ready for ``serious talks which would assure
pluralism.''
   ``Now, at the end of the year, there are buds of hope to obtain
solutions accepted by both sides. The round table is a chance which
could give life to these hopes, which were born out of seven years
of mutual brawling.''
   Plans to hold the talks broke down in November when authorities
refused to guarantee their willingness to relegalize the labor
federation, crushed in the martial law crackdown seven years ago
this week.
   But Walesa's appearance in a nationwide TV debate on Nov. 30 and
the increasing attention given his views in the state-controlled
media this month indicated a growing acceptance of the Solidarity
leader by officials.
   Walesa's being allowed to go to France also underlined his
improved standing with officials.
   Government spokesman Jerzy Urban on Tuesday praised Walesa's
statements during his trip and said the talks could discuss the
future of trade union pluralism.
   Asked about Urban's comments, Walesa said, ``It is very close to
dotting the `i,' but the dot is still missing.''
   Opposition sources said Walesa will meet this weekend with a
council of 60 independent intellectuals and worker activists that he
consults on major policy issues.
   In another development, the party leadership announced a Central
Committee meeting for Tuesday and Wednesday to discuss political
reforms and the role of the party. Urban has said the plenum could
bring new impetus to national agreement.
   Walesa said Solidarity has been maintaining contacts with
authorities through a Roman Catholic Church intermediary, the Rev.
Alojzy Orszulik.
   He said the talks would cover unions, economic problems and ways
``to cooperate to improve living conditions.''
   Walesa, the 1983 Nobel Peace laureate, agreed this year to end a
wave of strikes demanding relegalization of Solidarity after the
government agreed to the talks.

   Saying ``thanks for a free America,'' President
Reagan on Thursday night threw a switch lighting up the national
Christmas tree, to the cheers of hundreds gathered in the Ellipse
across from the White House.
   With his wife Nancy standing at his side, Reagan delivered brief
remarks from a balcony of the South Portico to the crowd, which had
been listening to Christmas carols by singer Johnny Mathis.
   ``Christmas casts its glow upon us as it does every year,''
Reagan said. ``It reminds us that we need not feel lonely because we
are loved, loved with the greatest love there has ever been or will
ever be.''
   ``We Americans live with bounties that those who lived at the
time of the Christ child's birth could never have imagined,'' he
said. ``The bounties are material, yes, but chiefly they are
spiritual.''

<TEXT>
   President-elect George Bush will
continue diplomatic and economic sanctions imposed in an effort to
force out Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega, the de facto ruler of Panama,
the U.S. ambassador says.
   Bush ``will not be disposed to abandon the pressure for change
and democracy in Panama ... no matter what Noriega might want,''
Ambassador Arthur Davis told a dinner Wedneday night of the American
Chamber of Commerce and Industry of Panama. The embassy released his
remarks Thursday.
   Davis said the United States would end sanctions when Noriega
resigned as as commander of the Panamanian military, a position he
uses to control the country.
   ``The beginning of political stability only can be achieved if
Noriega relinquishes power,'' Davis said.
   Noriega is under U.S. indictment on charges of drug trafficking
and money laundering. He denies the accusations.
   ``In 1988, we have observed in Panama a progressive deterioration
of human rights, a growing disdain for justice and respect for laws,
the unconstitutional ouster of President Eric Arturo Delvalle, and
the loss of confidence in the economy,'' Davis declared.
   He said the government nominally led by President Manuel Solis
Palma was unconstitutional. Noriega arranged Delvalle's dismissal by
the National Assembly on Feb. 26, after Delvalle had tried to fire
the general.
   Davis said U.S. sanctions were not to blame for Panama's economic
crisis and were not meant to hurt the Panamanian people.
   ``The Panamanian economy cannot begin its recovery unless the
political crisis of this country is resolved in a satisfactory
manner for all Panamanians,'' he said.
   Economic sanctions, which which forbid U.S. operations to pay
taxes to Panama, ``are doing what they were created to do: they're
preventing cash from reaching the hands of an illegal regime,''
Davis said.
   Noriega claims Washington seeks an excuse to violate the 1977
treaties under which control of the Panama Canal will be given to
Panama on Dec. 31, 1999. Davis said canal security can be guaranteed
only with ``genuine progress toward democracy and a civilian and
constitutional government in Panama.''
   Davis said presidential elections scheduled for May 7 would be
worthless if Noriega remained in his post.
   ``As long as Noriega clings to power, we don't believe that the
elections can be accepted by Panamanians as the product of an
authentic process,'' he said.
   Most opposition parties take a similar position, arguing that
sufficient election and press guarantees do not exist. The
government has closed three newspapers, three radio stations and a
television station.

<HEAD>Charter Company Accepts Board's Report On Crash</HEAD>
<DATELINE>OTTAWA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A lawyer for Arrow Air accepted the Canadian
Aviation Safety Board's conclusion that ice on the wings caused a
plane crash at Gander, Newfoundland, that killed 256 Americans three
years ago.
   The letter to the board from lawyer Humphrey Dawson was obtained
Thursday by the Canadian Press news agency. It said that while Arrow
does ``not agree with some matters contained in the report, they do
accept the report as published and do not propose in any way to
challenge the same.''
   He did not elaborate on which matters the company disagrees.
   Arrow Air was the operator of the charter DC-8 that crashed on
Dec. 12, 1985, killing 248 U.S. troops and eight crew members. The
soldiers were heading home to Fort Campbell, Ky., from peacekeeping
duties in the Middle East.
   The board concluded Dec. 8 that ice on the wings was the likely
cause, but a significant minority said in a separate opinion that an
in-flight fire caused the crash.
   The often public disputes during the long investigation and the
sharp split led to repeated calls here for a judicial inquiry.
   Dawson said Arrow doesn't want one.
   ``It is my clients' present view that they would not participate
in any such review or inquiry, a view with which I wholly concur,''
he said.
   ``I hope the board will now be able to put this sad incident and
its recently troubled history behind it having regard to the
important role it must play in civil aviation in Canada.''
   He said the release of the board's majority and minority reports
means ``the issues on the whole have been raised.''

<TEXT>
   Defense Minister Humberto Ortega
accused the Reagan administration Thursday of continuing supply
flights to Nicaraguan rebels in violation of a congressional ban.
   Gen. Ortega, whose brother Daniel is president of Nicaragua, also
told a news conference that battle casualties in 1988 were
dramatically lower than the previous year's total.
   He claimed Nicaraguan radar detected 10 clandestine supply
flights into Nicaragua from El Salvador in November.
   The United States has supported the rebels, known as Contras,
since 1981, two years after a civil war in which the leftist
Sandinistas deposed the late President Anastasio Somoza.
   Congress stopped U.S. military aid to the rebels at the end of
February but allowed distribution of non-lethal aid to continue in
neighboring Honduras. About 10,000 rebels returned to base camps in
Honduras to get the food and uniforms.
   Ortega said rebel forces totaled no more than 7,000, of whom
about 2,000 were in Nicaragua.
   He said the presence of Contras in Nicaragua means a war
situation still exists and the rebels ``can do damage.''
   Nicaragua has an army of about 80,000, the largest in Central
America, and gets its military equipment from the Soviet bloc.
   The defense minister said government forces killed 2,226 rebels
in 1988, down from 5,339 the previous year, and 611 Sandinista
soldiers were killed compared with 1,613 in 1987.
   He said civilian casualties rose to 1,748 from 1,675 in 1987, but
did not break the number down into dead and wounded. Ortega said the
number rose because of kidnappings by rebel forces.
   The Sandinistas and Contras signed a cease-fire March 23 that
called for the rebels to stop fighting in exchange for democratic
concessions. Talks on details of the agreement reached a stalemate
in September.
   Both sides stopped offensive operations March 21, when the talks
began. The government has renewed the cease-fire each month since a
formal 60-day truce ended May 31.
   On Thursday, the defense minister claimed the Contras had killed
69 civilians since the March agreement, wounded 79 and kidnapped
372. He said 70 soldiers had been killed, 73 were wounded and seven
were missing.
   Ortega, flanked by the military high command, said Nicaraguans
should be prepared for a U.S. invasion. The Sandinistas have made
that claim repeatedly.
   He said Honduran forces have harassed Nicaraguan positions on the
border to provoke a confrontation that would give Honduras an excuse
to request help from the United States.

   Federal election officials, under court order
to clarify how political parties can spend campaign funds, heard
Democratic and Republican spokesman warn Thursday that too much
regulation could stamp out politicking at the local level.
   While other critics told the Federal Election Commission that
current rules have led to illegal use of so-called soft money, the
national political parties lobbied for flexibility in what the state
and local parties can do.
   The issue revolves around how to apply the federal election laws
to the local entities who get money from the national parties and
whose activity can provide overlapping benefit to presidential and
congressional candidates.
   ``If you like a campaign that involves people at the local level,
then don't go down that slippery slope,'' of micro-regulation,
Republican National Committee counsel Mark Braden told the
commission. He warned that if the local parties are forced into
complicated bookkeeping on what money is spent for federal and
non-federal campaigns they will probably ignore the rules or simply
bow out of campaigning. That would freeze out grassroots activity
and shift to a total national TV campaign, he said.
   Braden and his Democratic counterpart, Joseph Rieser Jr., argued
that where federal and local goals overlap, the local and state
parties should not be saddled with complicated allocation formulas,
but should be allowed to allocate the funds to federal and
non-federal accounts in a way that best suits their situation.
   No matter how stringent the rules, the FEC won't be able to
accomplish complete fairness, Braden said.
   ``You draw up the rules. I get paid to manipulate them,'' he
said. ``Whatever you do is going to be maniplated to some degree.''
   Rieser denied that the DNC gives money to local and state parties
only to help the presidential race. He said the party has an
interest in local level politics as well.
   Different states have different political situations that would
make it unfair to lock them into using a standard formula for how
much of their activity benefits federal elections, versus local
elections.
   For instance, California had a plethora of hotly-contested ballot
initiatives and many tight legislative races on which the state and
local parties invested heavily for slate mailers and
get-out-the-vote activity. Other states had little state election
interest and were more focused on the presidential race.
   The public hearing testimony was a step in FEC compliance with a
federal court order that said the commission's rules were too vague
on soft money, which is banned in federal elections but is permitted
in many states.
   Soft money generally refers to union and corporate donations, as
well as individual contributions in excess of the federal limit of
$1,000. Such funds are banned in federal elections, but permitted in
many states.
   The focus of the current FEC deliberations is how the parties
should allocate funds to soft, or non-federal accounts, and to
federal accounts for campaign activities that benefit both federal
and non-federal candidates. Such activities include voter
registration and get-out-the-vote drives as well as slate cards and
administrative costs.
   Fred Wertheimer, president of Common Cause, a longtime critic of
the system, said that both parties in 1988 ``brazenly flouted the
limits imposed by federal law on the sources and amounts of
permissable contributions in connection with federal elections.''
   Noting that both parties had raised millions of dollars in soft
money, he accused them of using the system to circumvent the limits
on what they could spend for their presidential nominees by doing it
through state party activity.
   Braden and Rieser both said they knew of no examples of soft
money being spent on the campaigns of George Bush and Democrat
Michael Dukakis, but they acknowledged that party spending at any
level inevitably helps the top of the ticket.
   ``That sort of activity affects all elections,'' said Rieser.
   ``You can't help a legislative candidate without helping the top
of the ticket,'' said Braden. ``Everything affects everything else.''
   The RNC raised in the neighborhood of $70 million this year, with
about $20 million of that in soft money, Braden said.
   However, those figures did not include another $25 million that
was raised through the ``Victory '88'' program the RNC set up in
each state, with the funds going directly into state accounts rather
than to the RNC.
   The Democrats, said Rieser, raised about $60 million this year,
with some $18 million of that in soft money.
   Both parties had programs to court high-dollar givers who
contributed sums of $100,000 or more.
   The federal system permits an individual to give no more than
$25,000 per year in federal election contributions, including to
parties and candidates. But unlimited sums can be donated to
non-federal accounts.

   Gas explosions believed caused
by a faulty valve killed a 10-year-old girl on Thursday, injured
four other people and heavily damaged 20 homes in a central West
German town, officials said.
   The chain reaction explosions began at about 11:45 a.m. (5:45
a.m. EST) among newly constructed homes in Niederwalluf, about three
miles southwest of Wiesbaden, Hesse state Interior Minister
Gottfried Milde said.
   Milde told reporters in Niederwalluf that 4,500 residents were
evacuated to neighboring Eltville until 500 houses could be checked
to make sure no further danger of explosion existed.
   Officials earlier said the danger appeared over, but at least
three more explosions erupted among the white townshouses hours
later, raising the total to 20 blasts and 20 homes damaged, Milde
said. Officials said four of the homes were demolished.
   The child's body was found in the rubble of one house. Rescue
teams with trained dogs searched other damaged structures for more
possible victims.
   Spokesman Klaus Olennik of the Rheingau AG gas company told The
Associated Press by telephone a valve in the gas main was to blame.
   ``We don't know if someone tampered with it, or if it was
defective. But something went wrong with a valve separating the high
pressure from the low pressure section of the gas mains,'' Olennik
said.

   The Communist government of South Yemen will
get loans of $5.6 million from the World Bank and the United Nations
to improve health care, it was announced Thursday.
   The World Bank has come under fire in Congress for making loans
to the Communist governments among its 151 members. The U.S.
government holds the largest single block of World Bank stock, but
does not have a veto over loans.
   Of the $5.6 million, $4.5 million will come from the World Bank's
International Development Association. Its loan is repayable in 40
years, including 10 years during which only interest is payable at
0.75 of 1 percent a year.
   The rest of the money is being lent by the World Health
Organization and three U.N. funds: for children, capital development
and population activities.
   The money will help the People's Democratic Republic of South
Yemen construct 19 new buildings, including a nursing school, and
upgrade 26 others. Some of it also will go for medical supplies and
family planning material. About 400,000 people in the remote areas
of the Arabian peninsula will benefit, according to the World Bank
announcement.

<TEXT>
   Political activists began a hunger
strike after they were arrested for organizing a human rights march
that police broke up last weekend, the wife of opposition leader
Domingo Laino said Thursday.
   ``My husband was detained in the central police station on Dec. 6
when he went to find out about the imprisonment of other
politicians,'' Rafaela Guanes de Laino said.
   She said that Laino, president of the Authenthic Radical Liberal
Party, has refused to accept solid food since Dec. 7 and the
approximately 25 others detained since last week have done the same
since Monday.
   ``My children are worried ... because the police haven't taken
him to the Supreme Court of Justice in compliance with a writ of
habeas corpus our lawyers filed,'' Mrs. Guanes de Laino said.
   Saturday's march commemorated the 40th anniversary of the
Universal Declaration of Human Rights, a United Nations document
under which member nations pledge to safeguard life and liberty and
abolish torture and slavery.
   The government of President Gen. Alfredo Stroessner banned the
seven-block walk from the national cathedral to the local U.N.
office on the ground the intention was to disturb the peace.
   When hundreds of people showed up anyway, police attacked them
with electric prods, rubber batons, fists and feet. No serious
injuries were reported, but about 100 people were detained.
   Most were released this week, but the organizers _ leaders of
opposition political parties, independent unions, religious groups _
remain in jail.
   ``Irregular sectors are immersed in a plan to destabilize and
bring down the government,'' Sabino Montanaro, the interior minister
and president of the governing Colorado Party, told party leaders
Thursday.

   A Soviet tanker and a West German container ship

little damage resulted, the coast guard said.
   A coast guard spokesman, who by custom was not identified, said,
``There was no damage to cargo or personnel and no pollution.'' He
said an investigation was under way.
   The collision, about 15 miles off Harwich, northeast of London,
involved the 10,000-ton Soviet tanker Konstantin Tsiolkovskiy and
the 10,000-ton West German container vessel Proud Eagle.
   The spokesman said the container ship proceeded to Felixstowe,
while the tanker was at anchor waiting for a berth at Coryton.

   Chinese and American officials on Thursday began
three days of scholarly discussions and banquets to mark the 10th
anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations.
   In the first of many toasts to be raised over the next few days,
U.S. Ambassador Winston Lord told hundreds of Chinese scholars ``Let
us commit ourselves not only to expanding our exchanges of
delegations and goods, but also to that ever-elusive, more profound
goal _ the exchange of understanding.''
   China's Foreign Ministry plans a strait-laced dinner and evening
of traditional entertainment Friday at the imposing Great Hall of
the People.
   Lord's wife, Bette Bao Lord, said she is planning a more
light-hearted party Saturday that will involve ushers in panda suits.
   ``It's not going to be a reception, it will be a happening,'' she
said. ``We want to have fun.''
   Both sides said the state of Chinese-U.S. relations is cause for
celebration but acknowledged that friction exists over trade, human
rights issues and the status of the rival Nationalist government on
Taiwan.
   ``Ten years ago, nobody could imagine that the two countries
would develop the kinds of extensive and permeating contacts that
exist today,'' Zi Zhongyun, director of the Chinese Academy of
Social Sciences' Institute of American Studies, told a seminar
marking the anniversary.
   For decades after the Communists came to power in 1949, the
United States recognized their defeated rivals, the Nationalists on
Taiwan, as China's government. Ideological suspicion was reinforced
when the Chinese Communists and United States found themselves on
opposite sides in the 1950-53 Korean War.
   In 1972, President Richard Nixon made a dramatic trip to Beijing
and began a process of drawing closer to China that culminated on
Dec. 15, 1978, when President Jimmy Carter signed an accord
recognizing the Communist government.
   The agreement took effect Jan. 1, 1979.
   Since then, the United States has become China's second-largest
trading partner, after Japan, with 1988 trade projected at more than
$13.5 billion. More than 50,000 Chinese will travel to the United
States in 1988, Lord told the seminar Thursday, and about 300,000
Americans will visit China.
   Hundreds of cultural and scientific exchanges have taken place in
addition to regular visits by senior government officials.
   However, Ms. Zi said China remains unhappy over U.S. failure to
press Taiwan to enter into reunification talks with the mainland.
   She also repeated China's frequent charges of U.S. trade
protectionism and criticized U.S. use of technology transfer ``to
impose pressure on China.''
   Last year, the United States froze for months its liberalization
of technology transfers to China to protest China's use of force in
suppressing pro-independence demonstrations in Tibet in the last 14
months.
   In his speech, Lord said U.S. concern for human rights ``is
natural and universal. We do not single out China.'' He reiterated
that the United States recognizes China's sovereignty over Tibet but
pressed for greater access to the region by foreign journalists.
   Washington has not commented on the latest clash between Chinese
police and Tibetan activists, in which police on Saturday fatally
shot at least two people and injured 13.
   China says its rule over Tibet dates to the 13th century. Tibetan
activists claim their remote region was effectively independent from
China for centuries before Chinese Communist troops entered in 1950.

<TEXT>
   A prosecutor ordered a 41-year-old Swede
held in custody Thursday in the slaying of Prime Minister Olof
Palme, signaling what could be a major break in Sweden's crime of
the century.
   The man detained Wednesday is suspected of ``having murdered Olof
Palme,'' Jorgen Almblad, spokesman for the prosecutor's office, told
Swedish Radio.
   Sweden's strict press and libel law forbids publication of a
suspect's name, but he was identified in public records as Christer
Pettersson.
   Palme, a four-term Social Democratic prime minister who
championed international peace and disarmament issues, was killed
the night of Feb. 28, 1986, while walking home unguarded with his
wife from a downtown movie theater.
   The killing jolted a nation which prides itself on orderliness
and had seen little of the political violence and terrorism that
plague other countries.
   Pettersson has a history of violent crime and a previous
conviction of manslaughter. He has been interrogated since he was
detained Wednesday.
   ``The suspicions from yesterday remain,'' said Almblad.
   A witness identified the man as someone who waited outside the
Grand Theater, where Palme had been just before he was fatally shot,
the radio reported without identifying its source. It said there
were discrepancies between witness accounts and the suspect's alibi.
   The killer followed Palme down the street after the prime
minister left the theater and shot him with a .357 magnum revolver
which has not been found.
   Before Wednesday, police were unable to produce a solid lead or a
motive in the killing, despite the largest manhunt in Swedish
history and a reward of $8 million. The investigation was marred by
squabbling between police and prosecutors, and the chief detective
in the case was replaced twice. Government commissions accused
police of incompetence in the investigation.
   Thursday's move means that prosecutors feel they have enough
evidence to build a case against the man and may hold him
indefinitely, although his attorney may dispute the remand order in
Stockholm District Court on Friday.
   ``There is reason to believe it will be a difficult case,'' said
Arne Liljeros, the public defender assigned to the case. ``My client
denies it, says it's a mistake,'' he said in a television interview.
   A friend of the suspect said the man was a member of the Sweden
Party, an ultra-rightist group that advocates white supremacy, the
national news agency TT reported. But police have not linked him
with the party, the report said.
   ``He didn't like Palme, he was angry at him,'' the unidentified
friend was quoted as saying.
   Authorities have refused to give details of their case, but
Swedish police reporters were given access to the suspect's file.
Reports said he had 63 convictions for various offenses and had
spent the last 22 years in and out of prisons and phychiatric wards.
   He was convicted of fatally stabbing an alleged drug addict with
a bayonet in 1970, just a few yards from the site of the Palme
killing.
   Almblad said the suspect had been under investigation ``for a
long time,'' but declined to give further details. The man had been
questioned in 1986, but was not arrested because his alibi appeared
sound at the time, according to TT.

<TEXT>
   The two airlines that dominate Chicago's O'Hare
airport agreed Thursday on flight schedule changes aimed at reducing
the number of delays in and out of the airport next spring, the
Federal Aviation Administration said.
   After two days of meetings, American Airlines and United Airlines
agreed to stagger and more evenly distribute flights at O'Hare _ the
busiest airport in the nation _ especially during heavy travel
periods in the evening, officials said.
   ``We're pleased with the adjustments which should provide a
substantial reduction in delays we've been experiencing (at
Chicago),'' said FAA spokesman Dick Stafford.
   Most of the adjustments will go into effect March 1 when the
airlines put their spring schedules into place.
   The discussions under the direction of the FAA were being
conducted at a hotel near Washington.
   Flight delays have increased at O'Hare in recent months after the
FAA reduced the maximum number of flights allowed each hour at the
airport. The flight restrictions were imposed because of concern
that air traffic controllers were being asked to handle too many
planes.
   There has been a sharp increase in controller errors involving
air traffic in the Chicago area this year.
   American and United together have about 60 percent of the flights
at O'Hare.
   Stafford said the adjustments agreed upon by the two airlines
will be closely watched by the FAA when they go into effect. ``If we
find out the agreement isn't working, we'll call the carriers back
in again,'' he said.

   Organizers of the one-day general strike

movement,. It should not underestimate what has happened or try to
fool itself,'' he said.
   His union is a century-old ally of Gonzalez's governing Socialist
Party.
   In a statement Thursday, the prime minister acknowledged ``the
political success'' of the strike and admitted it represented ``a
tough political blow for the government.''
   The unions estimate that 7.8 million of Spain's 11.8 million
employed stayed off the job to protest austere economic policies.
   Gonzalez said the government would give its view of the strike in
Parliament next Wednesday and seek a first meeting with union
leaders the following day.
   But government spokeswoman Rosa Conde said the government's
position ``will not vary substantially.''
   The General Workers' Union joined the communist-dominated Workers
Commissions to organize the strike after talks with the government
broke down a month ago over demands for more pay, unemployment
benefits and pensions.
   Redondo warned that the two unions will organize more strikes and
demonstrations if the government fails to satisfy their demands.
   Redondo and Secretary-General Antonio Gutierrez of the Workers
Commissions told reporters the government must accept the unions'
basic demands prior to their entering wide-ranging negotiations on
economic policies repeatedly offered by Gonzalez.
   These include wage and pension demands, expanded unemployment
benefits, granting civil servants collective bargaining rights and
withdrawing a youth employment plan the unions reject as
exploitative.
   The unions have denounced Gonzalez' anti-inflation, high-growth
economic policies which caused a boom in the last three years. They
complain that the policies failed to reduce unemployment, which at
18.7 percent remains the highest in Europe.
   Redondo said it was time to compensate workers and the poor for
sacrifices the unions contend made the boom possible.

<HEAD>Department Spends $1.3 Million Sending Collider Reports to the
Public</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID FOX</BYLINE>

   The Energy Department came under criticism
Thursday from an Illinois congressman who said the department wasted
$1.5 million by mailing a 26-pound, 23-volume report on the
superconducting super collider to 16,000 people, sometimes sending
four to a family.
   A department spokesman, Jeff Sherwood, disputed the figures cited
by Rep. Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., saying the report actually went to
about 17,000 people and cost $1.3 million.
   ``This is crazy,'' said Hastert, whose district includes one of
the rejected sites for the collider. ``It's just a lack of common
sense.''
   The document at issue is an 8,000-page environmental impact
statement on possible sites for the $4.4 billion atom smasher in
Arizona, Colorado, Illinois, Michigan, North Carolina, Tennessee and
Texas.
   Energy Secretary John Herrington announced Nov. 10 that Texas
would house the project, a 53-mile, underground ring of magnets
which would whip proton beams together with 20 times the force of
the most powerful existing atom smasher.
   Scientists hope to learn more about the nature of matter from
studying subatomic particles created by the proton collisions.
   The department sent copies of the environmental statement to
everyone who testified at hearings on the project or submitted
written comments on any of the seven finalist sites, Sherwood said.
   ``It is government practice that both draft and final documents
be made available to interested parties as part of the environmental
review process,'' he explained. ``In order to comply with that
process, the department mailed that document out.''
   However, Hastert said an expensive mailing went far beyond the
requirement that agencies keep people involved in the site-selection
process.
   ``The law says people have to be contacted; they don't have to
send all this stuff,'' he said. ``If the department sent a letter
with a reply card, maybe they'd get 1 percent that would want the
report. Then, just making them available in libraries would be
enough.
   ``Why not do that? We're scrimping to cut spending by pennies,
dimes and nickles in Congress. They're spending almost $1{ million,
here, when we could be using that money to build highways or feed
the homeless. What a waste!''
   Sherwood acknowledged that the mailing might alienate members of
Congress who will decide whether to appropriate money for the
collider.
   ``I understand where the argument is coming from. I don't know
who made the ultimate decision,'' he said. ``But if we hadn't
distributed (the report), we would have been criticized for that as
well.''

charged with killing her infant child. Jeremy Irons was named best
actor for his double portrayal of twin gynecologists in ``Dead
Ringers.''
   The best supporting actor award went to Dean Stockwell for two
movies _ ``Married to the Mob'' and ``Tucker.'' Diane Venora won the
best supporting actress award for her work in ``Bird.''
   The best foreign language film was ``Women on the Verge of a
Nervous Breakdown,'' the Spanish movie about a woman whose lover
leaves her. ``Thin Blue Line,'' a film about the murder of a Dallas
police officer, won the award for best documentary.
   The best director award went to Chris Menges for ``A World
Apart.'' Henri Alekan was named best cinematographer for ``Wings of
Desire.'' The best screenplay award went to Ron Shelton for ``Bull
Durham.''
   The New York Film Critics Circle is an organization of more than
two dozen New York-based critics for both print and broadcast media.

<HEAD>Nicaraguan Refugees Moved Into Stadium After Shelter Is Shut Down</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   More than 150 Nicaraguan refugees are living in the
locker rooms of a Miami stadium after their three-room shelter was
closed by the city because it was overcrowded.
   ``I saw three, four people sleeping on top of each other'' at the
House of Love and Hope, said Miami City Manager Cesar Odio after a
Tuesday night inspection. ``I was horrified.''
   The privately run shelter was shut down Wednesday for alleged
unsanitary conditions and violations of Miami zoning laws. Vans and
buses moved the 157 refugees to the Bobby Maduro Miami stadium.
There was no word on how long the refugees would be allowed to stay
at the stadium.
   The action was the first time Miami officials have stepped in to
handle the growing influx of Nicaraguan refugees, who have been
moving to the city since the Sandinista revolution in 1979.
   The exodus has picked up speed in the past few months with
thousands of Nicaraguans pouring across the border, many from
Mexico, and finding their way to Miami.
   Some resented the move to the stadium. ``They're moving us like
animals,'' said Magda Pavon, who has been in Miami two months.
   Others were pleased with the space and bath facilities at their
new quarters. ``I feel they're helping us,'' said Julia Armas.
   The shelter had been cited for code violations several times
since it opened in August, but officials had given shelter founder
Cristobal Mendoza extensions to search for better quarters.
   U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service officials estimate
300 Nicaraguans a week have been settling in Dade County since the
summer.
   The city manager told Nicaraguans that their problem was similar
to the problem facing Mariel refugees eight years ago.
   When 125,000 Mariel refugees arrived in Florida in 1980, they
were processed in the Orange Bowl and a tent city was erected to
house them under an Interstate 95.
   ``We need to work with you in the same way,'' said Odio, who
helped direct the Mariel relief effort.

   Top Energy Department officials will meet
here with the governors of three western states Friday in an attempt
to resolve an impasse over storage of radioactive wastes from
nuclear weapons plants.
   The governors of Idaho, Colorado and New Mexico said they want to
hear proposals to solve the problem when they meet with Joseph
Salgado, chief deputy to Energy Secretary John Herrington, and other
regional DOE officials.
   The immediate problem is to find a storage site for seven boxcars
of radioactive material _ and enough additional waste to fill 17
more _ sitting outside the Rocky Flats nuclear weapons plant near
Denver.
   The other question is when the federal government will open its
Waste Isolation Pilot Plant, a prototype for permanent waste storage
facilities under construction in southwestern New Mexico.
   Doug Elmet, a spokesman for the DOE in Washington, said Thursday
the purpose of the meeting was to provide ``a chance for some
straight talk between the governors and the federal government.''
   But the governors said they hope federal officials will have an
answer to the problem.
   ``I've got all the information I need. What I need now is for
them to come and say, `We have got our act together,''' Idaho Gov.
Cecil Andrus said at a Thursday news conference. ``They should come
with a proposal that the three governors can deal with.''
   Waste has been stacking up at Rocky Flats, which manufactures
plutonium components for nuclear weapons, since October when Andrus
turned away a boxcar headed for the Idaho National Engineering
Laboratory and said the state would accept no more shipments.
   Andrus said he would not open the laboaratory to additional
shipments until the pilot plant is opened and DOE has outlined a
plan to remove existing waste from Idaho. Since the ban was imposed,
he said, ``There has been no progress for two months, which tells me
I was right to put my foot down.''
   Colorado Gov. Roy Romer said he would require Rocky Flats to
suspend production once its temporary storage capacity is filled.
Romer said during a news conference Thursday that he would not
consider a 90-day extension that would permit DOE to keep waste
beyond the plant's capacity.
   ``If they don't have a solution, they are going to have to close
it by failing to act,'' Romer said. ``I do not want a de facto dump
here. That's why I've kept that storage in those boxcars.''
   Romer said he did not expect an immediate solution to the Rocky
Flats problem, but said he hoped the DOE would ``put some alternate
solutions on the table.''
   Don Caviness, spokesman for New Mexico Gov. Garrey Carruthers,
said his boss wanted the Department of Energy to provide a firm
deadline for opening the pilot plant and an update on the progress
of some $240 million in mitigation funds the state has been
promised. Under an agreement signed between the state and DOE eight
years ago, New Mexico is to receive $190 million to build bypasses
around major cities through which waste would be shipped, and $50
million to compensate for lost mining royalties.
   Caviness said Carruthers would not permit the pilot plant to open
until those pledges are fulfilled.
   ``The DOE is in the awkward position. The governor is not going
to have the WIPP site open until the terms are met. New Mexico has
no intention of rolling over because the governors of other states
have problems,'' said Caviness.

<TEXT>
   The trial of a man and a woman accused of
bilking 31,000 men out of $4.5 million with phony stories of a
retreat inhabited by nude ``love angels'' went to a jury Thursday.
   In closing arguments, defense attorneys told the jurors that
defendants Donald Lowry, 59, and Pamala St. Charles, 25, are ``two
of the nicest people ... you'll ever meet.''
   Prosecutors contend Lowry, founder of the Church of Love, and Ms.
St. Charles, his assistant, defrauded lonely men with a mail-order,
sex-fantasy scam that exchanged pictures of nude women and phony
letters for contributions to a non-existent rural church paradise.
The letters asked for donations of money for the angels' supposed
needs, including garden seeds, winter coats and sewing machines.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Darilynn Knauss charged in her closing
argument that the defendants were con artists. But defense Attorney
William G. Schick argued the church was a legitimate business and
described Lowry and Ms. St. Clair as ``two of the nicest people who
care more about others than anyone you'll ever meet.''
   Prosecutors said Wednesday that Ms. St. Charles wrote to church
members telling them not to cooperate with a federal investigation.
   ``Why should you cooperate with them when it is to their
advantage only?'' Ms. St. Charles wrote in the letter introduced in
court. ``They are the enemy.''
   The letter was sent to Church of Love members who attended a
November 1986 convention called ``The Gathering,'' which was held in
a Chicago hotel, prosecutors said.
   Under questioning from her attorney, William G. Schick of Moline,
Ms. St. Charles said she wasn't trying to block the investigation,
but was concerned that investigators may have given false
information about the church to members.
   Ms. St. Charles and Lowry are charged with conspiracy, mail fraud
and unlawful use of funds fraudulently obtained through the COL Corp.
   She and Lowry now operate the International Order of Knights, a
mail order operation that clearly states that its letters from
``fantasy girls'' are fictional.

   A $200 million drop in West Virginia
investment funds are actual dollar losses, not interest, and
resulted from poor sales, state treasury officials said Thursday.
   As jittery local governments continued to pull their money from
the state investment pool, treasury officials said they sold off $30
million worth of securities early to satisfy a run on the investment
account.
   In addition, Treasurer A. James Manchin said the man in charge of
investments at the time of the 1987 loss _ former Associate
Treasurer Arnold T. Margolin _ was warned by his staff about the bad
investments but did nothing to halt them.
   The loss was not revealed until this week, and the news has
spurred a four-day run by local and county governments on the
state's consolidated investment fund, in which state agencies and
local governments place money for investment by the state.
   The local governments pulled out another $37 million Thursday,
bringing to $146 million the investment fund withdrawals since
Monday _ about half of what the agencies had invested.
   Assistant Treasurer Charles Capet said $30 million worth of
securities was sold at a loss to raise the funds needed to pay the
local governments. The state also sold other matured securities and
all its interest earnings were used to meet the demand. ``It's a day
to day thing,'' Capet said.
   ``From the newspaper reports that I've seen and the lack of an
explanation from those in charge, our money would be at risk in the
account if we were to wait for an explanation,'' said Jefferson
County Administrator David Ash, whose county commission Thursday
withdrew the $1.6 million it had in the investment fund.
   Manchin, who is in charge of the investment fund, said he
suspects no wrongdoing in the loss.
   ``It was just bad investments,'' he said Thursday.
   The treasurer has asked the U.S. attorney's office and state
officials to investigate the loss, however. U.S. Attorney Michael
Carey directed Manchin's request to the FBI, which has not decided
whether to investigate.
   At Manchin's request, the private accounting firm of Touche Ross
& Co. is investigating the loss.
   Margolin, who submitted his resignation last month to join the
staff of Gov.-elect Gaston Caperton as chief financial adviser, has
said he is awaiting the results of the Touche Ross investigation
before commenting.
   Manchin has refused to accept Margolin's resignation until the
matter is cleared up. He has challenged Margolin to reveal publicly
what happened, since Margolin said he has explained the situation to
Caperton.
   ``He was the man directly responsible,'' Manchin said of
Margolin. ``If Arnie explained it to Caperton, why doesn't he
explain it to the people? This is strange silence. He's hiding
behind the governor-elect.''
   But Caperton spokesman Steve Cohen quoted Margolin as saying that
he notified Manchin as soon as he discovered the losses. The
governor-elect said he retains the ``fullest confidence'' in
Margolin.
   Assistant Treasurer Charles Capet said the bad investments were
made over a 6- to 8-month period. He said the assets were purchased
at a high price and sold at a lower price.
   Former Assistant Treasurer Kathy Lester, who actually made the
investments under Margolin, was quoted in The Charleston Gazette on
Thursday as saying that she was retaining a lawyer and would have no
comment.
   Assistant Treasurer Mary Hudson, who now is in charge of
investments, said the consolidated investment fund this week totaled
$1.572 billion, or $208 million less than last December. The fund
was $2.4 billion at the end of 1986.

   A postal worker who shot and wounded three
people and held his girlfriend hostage for almost 13 hours was
coaxed into surrendering Thursday by an old acquaintance _ the
police chief.
   ``I just tried to appeal to him as a father,'' Warren Woodfork
said. ``I'm glad it worked. I'm not a trained hostage negotiator.''
   Warren Murphy, 39, gave himself up in the main New Orleans post
office shortly after 9 a.m. and released his hostage, 29-year-old
Carol Smith, unharmed, said police spokeswoman Carmine Menchel.
   Murphy was booked with assault with intent to commit murder, said
Assistant U.S. Attorney Lance Africk. U.S. Magistrate Michaelle
Wynne sent Murphy to undergo psychiatric evaluation at a federal
lockup in Springfield, Mo.
   Three post office workers hit by birdshot from Murphy's gun
during the siege, which began about 8:30 p.m. Wednesday, were not
seriously wounded, officials said.
   Woodfork, who negotiated with Murphy for about two hours, said he
knew the gunman because their sons had played football together.
   He said Murphy was concerned about a marital breakup and the
welfare of his children who reportedly were in his estranged wife's
custody in Washington.
   FBI spokeswoman Nancy Fisher identified Smith, also a postal
employee, as Murphy's girlfriend.
   ``He wasn't angry at her,'' Fisher said. ``He was upset over a
family matter. After the shooting started, he just grabbed her.''
   Volney Hayes, an FBI spokesman, said Murphy, after arriving for
work Wednesday evening, pulled a birdshot-loaded shotgun out of a
bag and started shooting.
   He hit one person in the eye, another in the thigh and another in
the arm.
   Postal employee Leonard King, hit in the eye, was reported in
good condition at Tulane Medical Center. Another victim who was
unidentified was in fair condition at Tulane, a spokesman said. At
Charity Hospital, a spokeswoman said a third victim, also
unidentified, was discharged Thursday.
   About 400 postal workers and customers fled when the shooting
broke out, authorities said. About 100 others took cover and hid for
four hours before being escorted out by officers making a
room-by-room search for the gunman.
   When the shooting began, Pat Wingerter of New Orleans was
standing in line with his Christmas cards.
   ``I heard one shot and then the people started coming out,''
Wingerter said. ``Even after the shot, there were people driving up
mailing letters for about five minutes. It was crazy.''
   After eluding police for five hours, the gunman was cornered with
his hostage in a windowless coffee break room with a single door.
Hayes said Murphy chased off agents with gunfire.
   More gunfire erupted sporadically through the night when Murphy
apparently became frustrated, Hayes said. No one was hurt, he said.
   ``They were just random shots,'' he said. ``They haven't been at
anyone. ... just stick the barrel under the door and fire.''
   Once it was apparent there was no danger to people outside the
building, police lifted roadblocks around the building, allowing
rush hour traffic to proceed on the busy streets surrounding the
post office.
   Hayes said Murphy made his only demand about 9 a.m., telling
negotiators he wanted to see no news reporters.
   A few minutes later, Murphy surrendered.
   ``I told him I'd meet him halfway, and when he walked out I was
there,'' Woodfork said. ``He had thrown the shotgun out.''
   Postal inspector Don Durken said he didn't know how Murphy got
the gun into the post office.
   ``Most of our entrances are secured,'' said Durken. ``But it's a
big building. The loading docks are open at times. Unless you had
someone every 20 feet, it would be hard to make sure nothing ever
got through.''

   President-elect Bush will name onetime rival
Rep. Jack Kemp of New York as secretary of housing and urban
development and was poised to make a decision on former Sen. John
Tower as defense secretary, sources said Thursday.
   Sources close to both Kemp and the vice president said Kemp had
accepted the job after meeting with Bush on Wednesday and that the
HUD announcement could come either Friday or Monday.
   Meanwhile, Tower was tentatively set to talk with Bush on Friday.
A final FBI background check on the former chairman of the Senate
Armed Services Committee was presented to the vice president on
Thursday.
   Transition officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity,
said the lengthy background check did not uncover any problems that
would hurt Tower's chances for Senate confirmation.
   Kemp, 53, a former professional football quarterback who has
championed conservative causes, was a distant also-ran in the
Republican primaries last winter. He was an original sponsor of the
1981 tax cut legislation later endorsed by President Reagan and is
an ardent advocate of free enterprise and government deregulation.
   Kemp has called for housing vouchers for the poor and allowing
tenants of public housing to purchase their units at low cost as
part of his urban redevelopment proposals.
   Meanwhile, Bush moved closer to filling two other Cabinet
appointments, transition sources said.
   Bush met privately with Dr. Louis Sullivan, a black medical
school chief and contender for secretary of health and human
services, and was on the verge of naming Samuel Skinner as secretary
of transportation, according to the sources.
   Gary MacDougal, a Chicago business executive and Bush transition
adviser, also has emerged as a top candidate for secretary of labor,
sources said.
   The sources, who commented only on condition they not be
identified, said Bush may fill some of the eight remaining vacancies
in his Cabinet on Friday.
   He has filled six Cabinet departments so far and has said he
wants to finish before Christmas.
   Transition legal counsel C. Boyden Gray delivered his final
background report on Tower to Bush on Thursday.
   Bush has delayed a decision on whether to name Tower, 63, defense
secretary pending completion of an extensive FBI investigation of
the former Texas senator's background, including an acrimonious
divorce.
   Sullivan is not the only black reportedly under consideration for
the Bush Cabinet, which already includes a Hispanic, Lauro F.
Cavazos, the holdover secretary of education. Retired Army Gen.
Julius W. Becton Jr., who now runs the Federal Emergency Management
Agency, is in the running to head the new Department of Veterans
Affairs.
   Bush told reporters only that he had a ``very good'' meeting with
Sullivan.
   Transition sources said Sullivan, 55, president of Morehouse
School of Medicine in Atlanta, assured Bush at the meeting that he
shared the vice president's anti-abortion views.
   Bush and Sullivan are friends. He accompanied Bush on a trip to
South Africa in 1982, and Barbara Bush serves on the Morehouse board
of trustees. Sullivan introduced the future first lady at the
Republican convention in New Orleans last August.
   Although transition officials formally said there was no final
decision on the HHS post, Bush has made a practice of meeting with
his prospective Cabinet choice shortly before an announcement.
   Skinner, 50, is chairman of the Regional Transportation Authority
of Northeastern Illinois.
   Bush said Wednesday that he expects to name a black to his
Cabinet.
   At a photo opportunity before meeting with transition advisers
and talent scouts, the vice president brushed aside a question about
whether he may appoint two blacks to the Cabinet.
   ``Don't believe all the rumors that are around. Just wait to have
an announcement,'' said Bush, who also told reporters that after the
transition, he won't allow questions at picture-taking sessions.
   ``Talking at photo ops will continue until Jan. 20 and after that
there will be absolutely none,'' Bush said. ``And then I'll have
other ways of communicating that will be much more pleasant for you
and much more pleasant for me and much more respectful of our guests
like foreign visitors.''
   He said the current practice of trying to sandwich in questions
during picture-taking sessions was ``demeaning to your profession.''
   MacDougal, 52, former chairman of Mark Controls Corp., is
reportedly among four candidates on a short list for the labor job,
along with Washington labor lawyer William Kilberg; Patricia Diaz
Dennis, a member of the Federal Communications Commission, and Frank
Doyle, a senior vice president for General Electric. Constance
Horner, the head of the Office of Personnel Management, has faded as
a top contender, administration sources said.
   Gray, the transition lawyer, said background checks now are under
way on candidates for subcabinet jobs.
   As for Tower, Gray said he did not know whether Bush would ask
him to pursue further any aspect of the extensive checking already
completed.
   One of the leading proponents of the Strategic Defense
Initiative, retired Lt. Gen. Daniel O. Graham, said Thursday he
opposes a Tower nomination because the former Senate Armed Services
Committee chairman ``is not for SDI.''
   Graham, founder of High Frontier, a lobbying group for the
space-based missile shield, said Tower would be ``in the pocket of
the Joint Chiefs of Staff'' and would sacrifice SDI to preserve
weapons in the Pentagon arsenal. He predicted Tower would not get
the job ``mainly because he's carrying so much baggage around on his
back.''

   Palestinians, the Arab world generally and many other countries
said Thursday the U.S. decision to talk with the PLO may bring new
life to stagnant Middle East peace negotiations.
   ``I could scream and cry and say, `Happy new peaceful era, Arabs
and Israelis!''' said Nawal Saadi, 44, a pharmacist whose family
fled Israeli-held Jerusalem for Amman, Jordan.
   Mrs. Saadi, one of 1.5 million Palestinians in Jordan, wept as
she said: ``Israel has to know that Arabs, and especially
Palestinians, are for peace and the wise U.S. decision does not mean
Israel will be thrown into the sea. ... We want to live in peace and
share the same land.''
   Mohammed Milhem, a former Palestinian mayor who was expelled from
the Israeli-occupied West Bank, said Wednesday's announcement was
``a great step by a great nation.''
   ``One of the major roadblocks has now been removed to convening
an international conference and the peaceful co-existence between
all peoples and all religions and all states,'' Milhem, former mayor
of Halhoul and a member of the PLO's ruling executive committee,
said in Amman.
   Some radical factions of the Palestine Liberation Organization
also hailed the U.S. decision.
   Kays al-Samarai, spokesman for the Marxist Democratic Front for
the Liberation of Palestine, called it ``a new victory for the PLO''
and for the intefadeh _ the year-old Palestinian uprising in the
Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   George Habash, leader of the radical Popular Front for the
Liberation of Palestine, called it a victory for the uprising even
though ``the U.S. administration says that initiating the dialogue
does not entail recognition of Palestinian rights to ... an
independent state.''
   Palestinians declared an independent state last month.
   Habash's statement referred to ``Israel'' instead of ``the
Zionist entity,'' the phrase his group and other factions
traditionally have used to describe the Jewish state.
   In Israel, Foreign Minister Shimon Peres said it was ``sad day
for all of us.''
   President Reagan said in Washington that the move was ``just
another step'' in the Middle East peace process and Israel should
not worry about the U.S. commitment to its security.
   In the West Bank and Gaza, delighted Palestinans marched in the
streets to celebrate.
   Some Palestinians opposed the concessions made by PLO Chairman
Yasser Arafat, such as renouncing terrorism and recognizing Israel's
right to exist, which effectively denies many Palestinians the dream
of returning someday to their homes.
   ``Armed struggle is our only option. Palestine is for the
Palestinian people and not for Israel,'' said Hassan Daher, a
22-year-old student at the Arab University of Beirut.
   President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt and King Hussein of Jordan
praised the U.S. decision and predicted it will lead to an
international conference on Middle East peace.
   Mubarak said the decision was a beginning, but Israel must
withdraw from the West Bank and Gaza and allow establishment of a
Palestinian state. He accused Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, who
opposes an international conference, of delaying peace efforts.
   Egypt's leading newspaper, the state-owned Al Ahram, said the
U.S. announcement came hours after Mubarak telephoned Secretary of
State George P. Shultz ``to urge him to take a positive attitude
toward the constructive decisions of the PLO.''
   Hussein, after meeting with Mubarak in Cairo, and said: ``I
believe the ice has been broken. ... I believe the peace process has
begun, and we hope to see it accelerate in the near future.''
   Later, in a satellite TV interview with ``CBS Evening News,''
Hussein said Americans ``should understand that the Palestinians and
their representatives have opted for peace ... I know Arafat to be a
man who is determined to stand by his word (in renouncing terrorism)
... That's good enough for me.''
   Khaled Musamer, a PLO spokesman in Amman, noted that the
Americans said the talks would start at a low level, but added: ``We
hope it will be more than that after the first meeting and
especially under the new American president.''
   In Britain, Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher said Arafat's recent
statements qualified the PLO to take part in a peace conference.
   Foreign Secretary Sir Geoffrey Howe said later in a British
Broadcasting Corp. interview, ``There has been courage and clarity
from the Palestinian side. We must now look for the same kind of
response from Israel.''
   President Francois Mitterrand of France said the decision ``has
brought peace in the region a step closer.''
   Japan welcomed the U.S. declaration as ``an important step toward
progress.''
   Prime Minister Ciriaco De Mita of Italy, who was visiting
Washington, concurred, and Vatican radio called the American
decision a sign that ``the force of reason begins to prevail.''
   The governments of Belgium, Greece, Australia and East Germany
were among those praising the action.
   Holland said it would send a delegation of senior diplomats to
Tunis, Tunisia, for talks with the PLO and the European Parliament
urged member nations to recognize the PLO as a Palestinian
government-in-exile.
   An-Nidaa, a Beirut daily, carried the headline: ``American
Retreat Under Blows of Stone-Throwing Heroes.''
   Saudi Arabia's official news agency used the headline ``Finally,
American-Palestinian dialogue.''
   In an Amman refugee camp, accountant Said Khalidy said: ``I never
expected the United States would look at us or care to find a
solution to the Palestinian issue.''

   Howling winds clocked at up to 102 mph
battered Northern California on Thursday, claiming at least one
life, overturning trucks, toppling trees and cutting power to more
than 440,000 electric customers.
   The winds littered scenic Northern California with downed power
lines, branches and trash, and authorities closed dangerous highways
and issued travel warnings.
   The San Francisco Bay waterfront was ravaged by the winds, which
tore yachts adrift, sank several and sent waves up to 10 feet high
slamming into seawalls. A 60-foot floating dock at San Francisco's
Pier 43 sank.
   ``We've had lots of trees knocked down, power outages and phone
problems,'' said Dan Nicholas of Sonoma County Emergency Services in
Santa Rosa, north of San Francisco. ``Some homes have been damaged
to the point where the people had to be evacuated and put up in
motels overnight.''
   Three-year-old Oli Asghar died Thursday in a Berkeley apartment
fire sparked by a candle used because of a wind-caused power outage.
His parents and three brothers and sisters were left homeless, fire
officials said.
   Some 442,000 Pacific Gas & Electric Co. customers throughout
Northern California were left in the dark by the winds, said
officials for the utility whose repair crews worked through the
night.
   ``This is definitely ... one of the largest outages because of
the velocity of the winds,'' said PG&E spokesman Ron Rutkowski.
   The winds also delayed the aircraft carrier USS Carl Vinson from
reaching its dock in San Francisco Bay. The carrier was scheduled to
arrive Thursday following a six-month tour, but Navy officials
postponed the homecoming until Friday.
   Winds weren't the only weather problem in Northern California.
Driving snow Thursday afternoon forced the closure of Highway 101
from Paso Robles to San Luis Obispo, a 30-mile stretch about 230
miles south of San Francisco.
   The winds were caused by the strong flow of air from a high
pressure system over British Columbia to a low pressure center in
Southern California and Nevada, said National Weather Service
meteorologist Randy Hartley.
   In northern Utah, the same ``upper air'' weather system brought
gusting winds up to 115 mph to northern Utah, said meteorologist
Bill Alder. Winds there felled power lines, toppled tractor-trailer
trucks, delayed mail deliveries, closed schools and fanned several
brush fires early Thursday.
   Utah Power & Light Co. crews worked into the afternoon to restore
electricity at the sites of scattered outages throughout a
four-county area.
   UP&L spokesman Dave Mead said he had no firm estimate on the
number of people left without electricity, but said ``you certainly
would be safe saying several thousand.''
   In California, power lines strewn across heavily traveled
Lakeville Highway near Petaluma, about 40 miles north of San
Francisco, forced authorities to close it overnight. Two private
planes at the Petaluma airport apparently were damaged by the winds,
said Nicholas.
   About 3,000 Navy personnel aboard the USS Carl Vinson, returning
from a six-month deployment to the Western Pacific, Indian Ocean and
North Arabian Sea, had their holiday port call delayed several hours
because of the winds.
   Petty Officer John Gwinn, aboard the huge ship, said he was eager
to reach shore where his wife, Sheree, and 3-month-old son, Robert,
were waiting.
   ``For me, it's hard. I've never seen my kid,'' he said.
   Winds clocked at more than 50 mph howled around San Francisco Bay
waterfronts, and the Coast Guard was kept busy retrieving small
boats torn from their moorings. Sausalito police said a tugboat sank
early Thursday.
   Famed attorney Melvin Belli's 110-foot motor yacht ``Adequate
Award'' was also damaged when a boat dragged its anchor across
Richardson Bay and slammed into it at Schoonmaker Marina.
   A controlled-burn fire in Tuolumne County flared because of the
winds and burned 100 acres on Thursday. Several small fires were
also reported in the Stanislaus National Forest.
   Other wind-related problems included malfunctioning elevators in
San Francisco, delayed flights and re-routed air traffic at San
Francisco International Airport and closure of the Richmond-San
Rafael Bridge to pickups with camper shells and other broad-sided
vehicles.
   The winds, blowing northward, were clocked at 102 mph early
Thursday atop Mt. Diablo about 40 miles east of San Francisco, where
remote sensing gear is located, said meteorologist Mike Pechner. The
wind hit 80 mph Wednesday night. Hurricane force winds are 74 mph or
greater.

<HEAD>Federal Panel Recommends Temporary Halt to `Let It Burn' Policy for
Forests</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GUY DARST</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal panel on Thursday recommended a
temporary halt to the ``let it burn'' policy in national parks and
wilderness areas to make sure everybody understands what the policy
means.
   In a report to the secretaries of agriculture and interior, the
advisory panel said current policies permitting fires to burn under
predetermined conditions ``are sound, but the policies themselves
need to be refined, strengthened and reaffirmed.''
   Until the moratorium is lifted, fires will be put out, officials
said.
   ``No ... natural fires are to be allowed until fire management
plans meet these standards,'' the report said.
   Charles Philpot, co-chairman of the review panel, told reporters
he expected ``the moratorium would be finished by the beginning of
the Western fire season, which is the middle of May.''
   Philpot is a former Forest Service official who is now special
assistant to the deputy secretary of agriculture.
   The secretaries of Interior and Agriculture appointed the
committee in September after the worst fire season in history in
Wyoming's Yellowstone National Park. Some 249 fires in and near the
park prompted complaints from residents and their representatives in
Congress that their communities were being ruined by smoke and the
collapse of tourism.
   The panel reviewed fire management policy on all federal lands,
not just Yellowstone. The panel said it found that some plans did
not spell out the conditions under which natural fires would be
allowed to burn.
   Some plans also did not consider ``values at risk outside of
parks and wilderness and the number of fires that can be managed at
one time,'' and ``cumulative effects of drought.''
   The panel's other co-chairman, Brad Leonard, deputy director of
the Interior Department's Office of Program Analysis, estimated that
``Twenty-five to 30 percent of the plans have some shortcomings.
Some of them are minor.''
   The Interior Department contains the National Park Service and
the Agriculture Department contains the Forest Service, which
supervises many wilderness areas and manages much national forest
land adjacent to Yellowstone.
   Interior's Bureau of Land Management, Fish and Wildlife Service
and Bureau of Indian Affairs also manage affected lands.
   The agencies insist they don't have ``let it burn'' policies but
rather ``let it burn if it meets our criteria'' policies.
   The report said the agencies reject as ``impractical and
unprofessional'' the practice that fires can be allowed to burn free
of conditions laid down in advance or appropriate suppression
action. It said some employees essentially had advocated that policy
as long as fire didn't escape the agency's land.
   The report said Interior and Agriculture agencies should make
sure that fire management plans conform to departmental policies,
that employees understand the policies, that everybody is using a
common vocabulary and that agencies have agreed beforehand what to
do if fires threaten to move across administrative boundaries.
   Denis Galvin, deputy director of the Park Service, said his
agency had had the report for 24 hours, and would be submitting
comments to the two secretaries.
   ``I don't see it as a major shift,'' Galvin said. ``It's clear
we'll do more around developed areas'' in deliberately set fires to
clear firebreaks or other techniques.
   The report, which will remain open for public comment for 60
days, recommended more research on when deliberately set fires can
be used and how to use them in lodgepole pine forests, the dominant
kind in Yellowstone.
   Many people interviewed said this technique should be available
for all federal land, though it has been little used in Yellowstone
and practically never in lodgepole because of the difficulty of
controlling it.
   The fires in Yellowstone were particularly intense because of
more than a century's buildup of dead trees and other matter on the
forest floor.
   ``There is little agreement on whether management objectives can
be achieved through planned ignitions when they result in high
intensity crown fire,'' the report said.
   Bill Linenesch of the National Parks and Conservation Association
said he saw no reason why all parks should be barred from letting
fires burn until every management plan had been approved.
   ``The lesson of the summer is that you cannot choreograph
nature,'' said Dave Simon of the association.

   U.S. Ambassador Robert H. Pelletreau Jr.,
who once was held hostage by Palestinians, telephoned PLO
headquarters Thursday to make the first official contact of a new
dialogue for Middle East peace.
   Pelletreau, who escaped from his terrorist captors in 1970, held
a brief conversation with a Palestine Liberation Organization
official at their Tunis headquarters, according to U.S. Embassy
spokesman Adnan Siddiqi and the PLO.
   Siddiqi did not identify the Palestinian or say what was
discussed. He said he did not know when to expect the first
face-to-face meeting of what Secretary of State George P. Shultz
calls a ``substantive dialogue.''
   Palestinian sources speaking on condition of anonymity said the
PLO delegation at the first meeting probably will be led by
executive committee members Abdallah Hourani and Yasser Abd-Rabbou.
State Department officials said the talks probably would begin
Friday afternoon.
   PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat met East German leader Erich Honecker
and other officials in Berlin on Thursday, then headed to Romania.
East Germany was one of the first countries to recognize an
independent Palestinian state. It was not known when Arafat intended
to return to Tunis.
   On Wednesday night, Shultz announced that Arafat's recent
statements renouncing terrorism and recognizing Israel's right to
exist opened the way for talks with U.S. officials. He designated
Pelletreau as the U.S. government's ``only authorized channel of
communication.''
   ``We hope that that dialogue may help bring about direct
negotiations that will lead to peace,'' Shultz said. ``How those
negotiations are structured, who is there to speak on behalf of the
Palestinians is a subject that's a difficult one.''
   The PLO, recognized by the United Nations and especially Arab
states as the sole legitimate representative of Palestinians, has
its political headquarters in Tunis, capital of the Arab nation of
Tunisia.
   Abu Yahia, PLO political director, confirmed by telephone that
the conversation with Pelletreau ``really took place.'' But he
declined to identify the official who spoke to the ambassador.
   In Washington, an American official said Pelletreau called the
director-general of the PLO political section to try to arrange
talks. It was not clear whether he was referring to Abu Yahia.
   ``We're sure the PLO will try hard to have them take place as
soon as possible,'' said the official, who spoke on condition of
anonymity. Another official said the first meeting certainly would
come within days.
   Pelletreau, who has been ambassador to Tunisia since March 1987,
is one of the most experienced and knowledgeable American diplomats
on Arab affairs.
   The 53-year-old native of Patchogue, N.Y., speaks Arabic and
French and has served in Algeria, Morocco, Mauritania, Lebanon,
Jordan and Syria. He once was ambassador to Bahrain.
   From 1985 until going to Tunis in 1987, Pelletreau was deputy
assistant secretary of defense for Middle East and South Asian
affairs.
   His first encounter with Palestinian terrorism came in September
1970 when guerrillas of George Habash's extremist PLO faction
diverted three airliners to Amman, Jordan, and took the passengers
and crews hostage.
   Colleagues say Pelletreau enjoys describing how he outwitted
captors who kidnapped him on the streets of Amman and took him with
the other hostages to a a downtown hotel news conference. Seeing his
captors were not attentive, Pelletreau edged in among the
journalists.
   ``He was standing there as the press conference was going on and
he just walked away. He bears them no ill will. It was a great
adventure,'' a U.S. diplomat said on condition of anonymity.
   ``Those were in the innocent days,'' he recalled. ``It's almost
hard to remember the days when you just didn't kill diplomats.''

   The house of the second-ranking
official in the U.S. Embassy was attacked with grenades last month,
the embassy reported Thursday.
   Neither David Dlouhy, the deputy chief of mission, nor any of his
family members or domestic employees was injured in the Nov. 25
nighttime attack.
   Embassy spokesman Joseph McManus told The Associated Press that
men traveling in two cars through the affluent neighborhood of
Maquilishuat threw several grenades and that two landed at the wall
surrounding Dlouhy's house.
   McManus said the two grenades caused some material damage, but no
injuries.
   Diplomatic sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said one
of the explosives bounced off the top of the wall into the yard.
   A woman was wounded by shrapnel from another grenade thrown
farther down the road, according to newspaper reports published in
the days after the attack. Those reports did not mention the attack
on Dlouhy's home.
   No group claimed responsibility for the Maquilishuat attack.
Because other grenades were thrown at other homes, it was unclear if
the attackers considered Dlouhy's house their specific target.
   Four days after the attack, leftist guerrillas briefly took over
two San Salvador radio stations to broadcast a statement saying U.S.
Embassy officials and U.S. buildings were considered ``legitimate
targets'' in the 9-year-old civil war.
   The centrist government's war effort is funded by the United
States.
   The guerrillas, on their clandestine radio station, previously
made similar statements.
   The wall around the offices of the U.S. Agency for International
Development was struck by a rocket-propelled grenade in October.

   Israeli leaders responded with anger and dismay
Thursday to the U.S. declaration that it will talk with the PLO, a
stunning reversal of policy to which they were given no time to
object.
   Some Israelis were left with a sense of betrayal by the way the
announcement was handled. Others said the dialogue with the
Palestine Liberation Organization is doomed to collapse.
   ``We believe that the United States will discover very soon the
true face of the PLO, and will realize that it cannot be a partner
for negotiations and peace,'' said Avi Pazner, spokesman for Prime
Minister Yitzhak Shamir.
   According to the daily Haaretz, Shamir was considering a
unilateral Israeli step ``that will make the U.S. decision fade.''
   The initiative amounted to granting a limited self-rule to 1.5
million Palestinians in the Israeli-occupied lands, Haaretz said in
a front-page report in its Friday editions.
   The daily Hadashot described Washington's decision as ``the most
painful diplomatic slap in the face that Israel has received since
its establishment. We have been left alone to face the entire
world.''
   Israeli officials said they were notified only 30 minutes before
Secretary of State George P. Shultz made the announcement, which
allowed no time for an attempt to dissuade the Americans.
   Analysts said Israel will face mounting pressure for a favorable
response to the PLO and delay could endanger relations with
Washington, which is its main ally and provides $3 billion a year in
aid.
   If U.S. talks with the PLO succeed, pressure would grow for
Israel to accept a U.N.-sponsored peace conference, which many
Israelis see as a forum for demanding unreasonable concessions from
the Jewish state.
   A conference probably would consider such issues as the Israeli
settlements that dot the occupied territories, return of the
territories, the status of Jerusalem and the central question of an
independent Palestinian state.
   An example of what Israel considers unreasonable was a provision
in a U.N. General Assembly resolution passed Thursday for U.N.
supervision of the occupied territories and Jerusalem, which Israel
has declared its capital.
   Such right-wing leaders as Yitzhak Modai of the Likud bloc said
Israel was prepared to take the heat.
   ``The United States wants to speak to the PLO, but this doesn't
require us to speak with the PLO,'' Modai said. ``The United States
can advise us and even pressure us here and there, but we have to
know how to withstand the pressures.''
   Palestinians called the U.S. decision a victory of their year-old
uprising in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip, in which more
than 320 Palestinians and 13 Israelis have been killed.
   Yossi Ben-Aharon, a senior aide to Shamir, told foreign reporters
there could be no solutions to Palestinian problems without Israel.
   ``They are still where they were in the camps,'' he said. ``We
are still running the show. Their lot ... has not changed by this
American move. The agent to bring about change is Israel, and
nothing can be done by bypassing Israel.''
   Shultz sent an explanatory message to Shamir and Foreign Minister
Shimon Peres, the leaders of Israel's caretaker government.
   A text released by Israeli officials said: ``I know how sensitive
an issue this is for you and the people of Israel. The dialogue that
is about to be launched is not an end in itself. It must focus on
the core issue of negotiations to end the Arafat-Israeli conflict.''
   U.S. Ambassador Thomas Pickering passed on oral assurances that
the United States was not recognizing PLO claims to an independent
state. Israel army radio called Shamir's talk with Pickering ``a
hard and unpleasant one.''
   Pickering said ties with Israel are ``stronger than ever,'' but
he said Israelis and Palestinians must make difficult concessions
for peace.
   Shamir, the head of Likud, made no comment Thursday, but Pazner
said: ``We regret this American decision, very much.'' He said
Israel would not reconsider its refusal to deal with the PLO, which
it calls a terrorist organization.
   Dozens of Jewish settlers from the territories began a hunger
strike, pitching tents in front of Shamir's office.
   ``The U.S. policy of recognizing the PLO is the seed of the next
war,'' said Ron Nachman, a settler leader. ``Israel cannot reach
agreement with the PLO. There is no common ground and the result
will be an explosion.''
   Peres, leader of the center-left Labor Party and Shamir's
political rival, said of PLO chairman Yasser Arafat's renunciation
of terrorism:
   ``I surely see a change in their rhetoric; I hardly see a change
in their actions. This is the discrepancy that worries me.''
   He said Israel was ``facing a new situation'' and proposed an
alternative: that elections be held in the West Bank and Gaza to
choose Palestinian leaders for peace negotiations.
   Ezer Weizman, a Labor member of the Cabinet without portfolio,
said Arafat's recognition of Israel and renunciation of terrorism
made the PLO a satisfactory partner for talks.
   ``I think a new era has opened,'' he said.

   Fierce winds ripped across Northern California and ice pellets
and snow fell in the central coastal area of the state Thursday,
while up to 18 inches of snow fell in Colorado and Michigan's Upper
Peninsula.
   Northward winds in California were clocked at 102 mph early
Thursday atop Mt. Diablo about 40 miles east of San Francisco.
Hurricane force winds are 74 mph or greater. The winds caused at
least one death, overturned trucks and cut power to more than
440,000 electric customers.
   Winds gusted to 67 mph at Travis Air Force Base and to 54 mph on
the Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco.
   One to 2 inches of wet snow fell in the higher elevations near
Paso Robles, Calif. Ice pellets and snowshowers were reported over
the Inland Hills of Santa Barbara County.
   A snow advisory was in effect for the higher elevations of the
southern California deserts through Friday.
   Early Thursday, winds in northern Utah blew trailers off their
foundations at Utah State University in Logan. Winds gusted to 105
mph at Centerville, 84 mph at Logan and 74 mph at Hill Air Force
Base. The winds knocked out power to 50,000 electric customers.

California and Utah also brought wind gusts of up to 65 mph at the
Niagara Mohawk Power Plant in western New York and to 48 mph at
Syracuse N.Y.
   In Michigan's Upper Peninsula, up to 18 inches of snow fell.
   ``Walloped? Who's been walloped?'' said Kerry Noble, manager of
ABC True Value Hardware in Marquette. ``This is just a little
(storm).''
   In Colorado, six to 12 inches of snow was reported in the
Colorado Springs area with 2 feet snow drifts. Up to 18 inches were
reported in the eastern foothills, 13 inches in west Denver, 11 in
Boulder, 9 in Fountain, 6 in Pueblo, 3 in Trinidad and 2 in Lamar.
   Cold arctic air kept Thursday afternoon temperatures below zero
over portions of northern Minnesota. Wind chill temperatures of 20
to 40 below zero were common over the northern Plains and Upper
Mississippi Valley.
   Temperatures around the nation at 2 p.m. EST ranged from 8
degrees below zero at Thief River Falls, Minn., to 81 degrees at
Brownsville, Texas.
   The low in the nation Thursday morning was 23 degrees below zero
at Park Rapids, Minn.
   For Friday, the National Weather Service forecast light snow from
eastern North Dakota to portions of the Great Lakes region. Widely
scattered rainshowers will occur over northern and central Florida,
southern California and southwest Arizona. Snowshowers will develop
over northern Arizona, southern Utah and in the mountains of Nevada
and California.
   High temperatures will be in the teens from Minnesota to New
York, with single digits and teens over northern New England. Highs
will be in the 40s and 50s from South Carolina across the Gulf
Coastal states to much of Texas and New Mexico and in portions of
Arizona, California, Oregon and Washington.
   Highs in the 60s and 70s are expected in the Florida Peninsula,
southern Arizona and coastal California. For much of the rest of the
nation, highs will be in the 20s and 30s.

<HEAD>New Laws Would Ban Religious Discrimination In Jobs</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government proposed new laws Thursday to
prevent employers in Northern Ireland from discriminating on the
basis of religion, but said threats of disinvestment could only
produce greater misery.
   ``I have made absolutely clear ... that there is to be no
discrimination of any sort in Northern Ireland,'' said Northern
Ireland Secretary Tom King, Britain's top official in the province.
   The bill, whose passage is assured because of the governing
Conservatives' huge majority in Parliament, would force companies to
report regularly on how many Catholics and Protestants they employ.
It would order them if necessary to change their employment
practices and levy fines of up to $55,000 on employers who don't.
   The measures, due to take effect next summer, stopped short of
imposing hiring quotas for the 40 percent Catholic minority, but
they mark the toughest attempt to end job discrimination in the
British province.
   Despite longtime bans on overt religious discrimination in jobs,
Catholic unemployment runs at 17 percent, 2{ times the Protestant
rate.
   The new moves appear to have been spurred partly by threats of
disinvestment from the United States.
   Eight American states have endorsed fair employment principles
put forward in 1984 by the late Irish statesman Sean MacBride. He
called for ending investment in companies in Northern Ireland
accused of religious bias.
   The disinvestment lobby is headed by Irish-American legislators
and pressure groups. American investment accounts for nearly 14
percent of the jobs in Northern Ireland.
   ``There is absolutely no way in which this legislation is
designed to see Protestants being dismissed for Catholics to take
their place,'' King told reporters. ``This is about recruitment ...
seeing that there is equality of opportunity.''
   He said the only way to improve employment opportunities for
Catholics was to create more jobs, and he called the disinvestment
program in the United States ``a very negative campaign.''
   ``We're getting more jobs into Northern Ireland and that combined
with effective legislation is the real hope for Catholics of a
fairer situation,'' King said. ``There is no hope for Catholics in
any policy that leads to disinvestment in Northern Ireland, which
leads to greater misery for all.''
   More than 2,700 people have been killed since political and
sectarian violence broke out in Northern Ireland in 1969 after
several years of civil rights campaigning by Catholics.
   Under the new laws, all companies with more than 25 employees _
and later with 10 or more _ will have to submit reports at least
once every three years on the religious composition of the work
force to a new body, the Fair Employment Commission.
   Failure to submit a report or comply with the commission will be
a criminal offense, carrying a fine of up to $55,000.
   The laws would also ban ``indirect discrimination'' in hiring
practices, such as getting workers to find new workers or taking
recruits from a single school. Nearly all Catholic and Protestant
children are educated separately.
   Public and private companies with more than 250 employees also
will have to monitor their job applications as well as the
composition of their work force.

   A Lebanese man was arrested Thursday at Kennedy
International Airport on charges he tried to smuggle almost five
pounds of heroin into the country, federal authorities said.
   Gebrayel Sarkis, 70, was arrested by agents of the U.S. Customs
Service following a flight from Geneva, said Ann Driscoll, a
spokeswoman for U.S. Attorney Andrew Maloney.
   Driscoll said Sarkis told authorities he was a brother of Elias
Sarkis, the president of Lebanon from 1976 to 1982. This information
could not be immediately confirmed, she said.
   At his arraignment before U.S. Magistrate Allyne Ross of
Brooklyn, Sarkis claimed he couldn't understand the charges. His
court-appointed lawyer asked for a hearing on his competency.
   Driscoll said Sarkis was found to be carrying plastic packages of
a white powder, taped around his back.

   A man imprisoned 20 years ago in the
poisoning deaths of his seven children asked for a new trial
Thursday, telling the Florida Supreme Court he was framed.
   Attorneys for James Richardson said the prosecutors and the
sheriff involved in his conviction time should be charged with
perjury and perhaps attempted murder, because he once faced
execution in the electric chair.
   Richardson's case also is being reviewed by Gov. Bob Martinez,
who was considering a request to recommend clemency to free the
former orange picker from prison. Three Cabinet members would have
to concur.
   ``This petition is going to crumble the house of cards the
state's case was built on,'' Miami lawyer Ellis Rubin said shortly
before filing the petition.
   Rubin, and lawyer Mark Lane of New York, who wrote a book on the
Arcadia murders, said Richardson was framed partly to protect a
friend of then-Sheriff Frank Cline. The friend was related to Betsy
Reese, the Richardsons' baby sitter who Rubin and Lane say has
confessed to the killings.
   Reese fed the children on the day of Oct. 25, 1968, when James
and Annie Mae Richardson were working in the fields. The children,
ranging in age from 2 to 8, died within a day after eating food
laced with the deadly pesticide parathion.
   The lawyers said Richardson, convicted on one count of
first-degree murder, was an easy target because he was illiterate,
poor and black.
   ``We know what racism was in Florida in 1968 because of this
case. Let's find out what it is in 19 and 88. This case is going to
do it,'' said Rubin.
   They based their petition on three claims:
   _The knowing use of perjury from the sheriff regarding an
insurance policy Richardson supposedly purchased for the seven
children, and from two former cellmates of Richardson's who said he
had confessed to the crime. One has since recanted that statement.
   _Prosecutors suppressed evidence that would have shown Richardson
had not yet purchased the insurance on the children.
   _Newly discovered evidence; former Arcadia Police Chief Richard
Barnard says he believes Richardson was framed by the sheriff, and
affidavits from nursing assistants that Betsy Reese has told them
she fed the poison to the children.
   Cline did not return a telephone message left at his home.
   There was no answer Thursday night at the office of State
Attorney Frank Schaub, who won Richardson's conviction in 1968.
Schaub leaves office next month.

<HEAD>Communist Party Supports Multi-Party System</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The ruling communist party for the first
time openly supported development of a multi-party system Thursday
and said independent political groups can take part in parliamentary
elections in 1990.
   Janos Berecz, chief ideologist of the Hungarian Socialist
Workers' (communist) Party, said in a report to the policy-setting
Central Committee that a law regulating parties should be passed
before a new constitution is adopted in early 1990.
   ``The party ... advocates society's right to self-organization,
and therefore it supports the enactment of a party law that will
regulate the foundation of parties in keeping with the new
constitution,'' Berecz said in his speech, published by the official
news agency MTI.
   It was the party's first direct support of a multi-party system.
In November the government approved for presentation to Parliament
draft bills to permit such a system.
   Berecz did not say what kind of power new parties will be
permitted to wield. MTI has said the leading role of the Hungarian
Socialist Workers' Party will remain at least until the new
constitution is adopted.
   The keynote address by Berecz comes a week before Parliament is
to pass a law on assembly and association that sparked a nationwide
debate in Hungary on the feasibility of a multi-party system.
   However, Berecz rejected a multi-party system along a Western
democratic model.
   ``We disagree with the bourgeois (Western) interpretation of the
multi-party system,'' he said.
   Communists have also said they do not want to see the development
of parties like those in Czechoslovakia or East Germany, which carry
little or no political weight. They say parties that develop should
be capable of bearing responsibility.
   The country's leaders have said the law would mean the acceptance
in principle of a multi-party system but have emphasized that a
separate law would be needed to regulate the establishment and
function of independent political parties.
   Berecz said the draft constitution could be put before the
Central Committee as early as May or June 1989 and then presented to
Parliament in the spring of 1990 following public debate on the
draft.
   He also advocated a plebiscite on the new constitution as
demanded by independent groups and some lawmakers after it is
approved by Parliament.
   Elections could then be held in the second half of 1990, Berecz
was quoted as saying.
   In an interview with the independent Reform weekly, published
Thursday, Central Committee Secretary Matyas Szueros indicated
independent parties could begin to function on a local level as
early as 1989.
   Dozens of independent organizations have mushroomed in the past
year, many with highly political platforms and nationwide support.

   Israeli soldiers and allied militiamen
infiltrated a U.N.-policed village in south Lebanon on Thursday and
abducted a Shiite Moslem guerrilla leader, police said.
   Armed residents in the village of Tibnin retaliated by kidnapping
three Irish soldiers with the U.N. peacekeepers for about an hour, a
police spokesman said on condition of anonymity.
   The Irish soldiers were released after the mainstream Shiite Amal
militia promised the villagers that the U.N. Interim Force in
Lebanon will do its best to locate the guerrilla leader, Jawad
Kasfi, and bring him back, the spokesman said.
   A source at the 5,800-strong UNIFIL said villagers from Tibnin
held three Irish soldiers aboard an armored personnel carrier for
more than an hour.
   ``The Amal movement interfered and the villagers released the
three Irish soldiers unharmed,'' the source said on condition of
anonymity.
   Tibnin, 13 miles north of the Israeli border, is within UNIFIL's
area of operations.
   The police source said two Israeli soldiers and three men from
the South Lebanon Army militia ``infiltrated into Tibnin in two
civilian cars early in the day and kidnapped Kasfi.''
   He said Kasfi was reputed to have ``engineered and lead guerrilla
attacks against the Israelis and the SLA in south Lebanon.''
   Israeli troops and South Lebanon Army militiamen control a
six-to-10-mile strip of south Lebanon which they refer to as their
``security zone.''
   The zone, which extends from the Mediterranean in the west to the
foothills of Mount Hermon in the east, serves as a buffer against
cross-border guerrilla raids into northern Israel.
   The nine-nation UNIFIL patrols a narrow region north of the
security zone.

<DATELINE>SOFIA, Bulgaria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The interior minister and three other
Cabinet members were relieved of their jobs on Thursday at a session
of the National Assembly, the state news agency BTA reported.
   The report gave no reason for the shake-up, which came one day
after a Communist Party plenum and a series of changes in the ruling
Politburo. However, Dimiter Stoyanov apparently left the Interior
Ministry so he could assume even greater responsibility.
   Stoyanov, 60, who holds the rank of colonel general, was
appointed a full Politburo member and a party secretary _ apparently
responsible for security affairs _ at the two-day party conference
which ended Wednesday.
   BTA said he was relieved of the interior minister's job he held
since 1973.
   Georgi Tanev, 45, named minister of transportation in September,
became new interior minister. Tanev, a civilian, has been a member
of the policy-setting Central Committee since 1981.
   Western analysts, speaking on the condition of anonymity,
speculated that Stoyanov's rise to the Politburo was linked to
official criticism of growing lawlessness and a wave of criminal
offenses in Bulgaria.
   Replacing Tanev as transortation minister was Trifon Pashov, a
regional party secretary for Mihailovgrad in northwestern Bulgaria.
   Among other changes in the 14-member Cabinet, Health Minister
Radoi Popivanov was replaced by Mincho Peichev, deputy chairman of
the National Council of the Fatherland Front, a Communist-ruled mass
organization.
   Alexei Ivanov, the minister of agriculture and forestry, was
replaced by Georgi Menov, a member of the standing committee of the
Agrarian Party.
   The official media has recently been criticizing the country's
agriculture for output shortfalls, including shortages of such basic
foodstuffs as potatoes, beans and rice.
   In a speech to the party meeting Tuesday, national Communist
leader Todor Zhivkov called for a reassessment of economic reforms.
He said change so far has been inefficient and contradictory.
   Zhivkov, 76, the longest-serving leader in the Soviet bloc,
called for introduction of market-style competition in the economy,
partly by turning state enterprises into share companies.
   He made clear, however, that the state would maintain a
controlling role.

   The piercing sounds blasted at a family's
farm during a 13-day police siege were demonstrated Thursday at the
trial of three polygamist clan members charged with a law officer's
death.
   Jurors showed little reaction as noises used in the psychological
assault ranging from an air-raid type siren to a sound resembling a
stuck car horn were played from two 100-watt speakers about 60 yards
away from the Summit County Courthouse.
   The demonstration came in the ninth day of the trial of clan
patriarch Addam Swapp, his brother Jonathan Swapp and brother-in-law
John Timothy Singer.
   All are charged with second-degree murder in the Jan. 28 death of
Corrections Lt. Fred House.
   House was shot and killed as he directed attack dogs toward the
Swapp brothers during an arrest attempt. Addam Swapp, who
precipitated the standoff when he bombed a Mormon chapel in nearby
Marion on Jan. 16, was seriously wounded during the same shootout.
   Judge Michael Murphy cautioned jurors that the demonstration was
only to illustrate methods used to rob clan members of sleep in
hopes of speeding their surrender, and that they were not exact
duplications.
   Defense attorneys have contended that loud, piercing electronic
noises, low-flying aircraft, flares and banks of brilliant lights
used by authorities in an effort to exhaust the 15 barricaded clan
members, including nine children, actually escalated tensions during
the siege.
   On Wednesday, Elliott Landau, a psychologist called by the
defense, testified that the FBI's use of the loudspeaker may have
caused anxiety, stress, irritability and reduced reasoning ability
among clan members during the standoff.
   Earlier testimony indicated the loudspeakers were used
irregularly during the final days of the standoff, and that they
were repeatedly shot out or torn down by clan members.
   Addam Swapp said the noises were a torture and they put pillows
on the children's heads in an attempt to block the sound. He said he
was compelled to shoot out or tear down the speakers to stop ``the
crazy noise from hell.''
   Also on Wednesday, Addam Swapp testified that neither he nor any
other member of his family deliberately fired at officers during the
firefight that ended the siege by 100 law officers.
   He said once the siege began, none of the family felt they could
trust anything the authorities said.
   Swapp said he never fired at anyone during the siege and felt of
killing, ``it's murder, it's wrong.''
   Asked who should atone for the slaying, he said, ``that was an
accident.''
   Prosecutors contend and defense attorneys concede the
wheelchair-bound Singer fired the fatal bullet, but Singer says he
was aiming at the dogs, not House.
   In a related development, Carla Foster, a friend of the Swapps,
was issued a misdemeanor citation charging her with illegally
carrying a concealed weapon after she unwittingly brought a gun to
the proceedings, officers said.
   Foster, 36, had handed her purse to a deputy stationed at a metal
detector and told him the gun was inside. She later explained to
officers that she had left her purse in her car during the morning
session and had retrieved it after lunch, forgetting that the weapon
was inside, said Detective Sgt. Robert Berry.
   Murphy barred Foster from the courtroom for the remainder of the
trial, and she was ordered to appear Tuesday in 3rd Circuit Court,
Berry said. The incident went virtually unnoticed in the courtroom.

   An offshore oil rig being towed across the
Atlantic Ocean capsized in high winds Thursday but all 26 crew
members were safe inside an enclosed boat called a ``survival pod,''
the Coast Guard reported.
   The rig Rowan Gorilla I capsized about 1,200 miles east of New
York City in gale-force winds of 40 to 60 knots and 40-foot seas,
the Coast Guard said.
   The tugboat Smit London, which had been towing the rig from Nova
Scotia to Yarmouth, England, remained with the pod, said Lt. Cmdr.
Paul Milligan, a Coast Guard spokesman in New York.
   Two commercial vessels were heading toward the tug and pod. They
were about 200 miles away as of 4 p.m. and it was expected to take
two days to get the crew out of the pod because of weather
conditions, he said. A Canadian P-3 plane was on the scene, he said.
   ``The people are safe _ there's nothing that can be done until
the seas subside,'' Milligan said.
   The crew members entered the survival pod, a boat that is
completely enclosed and contains food and water, about noon when it
became apparent the rig might capsize, he said.
   Nobody was injured when the rig capsized sometime in the early
afternoon, he said.
   The rig, owned by the Rowan Co. Inc. of Houston, capsized but did
not sink, and will probably be salvaged, Milligan said.
   The crew consists of 25 Canadians and one American, he said.
   But Maj. Glen Urquhart, a spokesman for search and rescue
operations in Halifax, Nova Scotia, said 27 people were in the pod,
including two women. He said they were 25 Canadians, one American
and one Dutch crew member.
   ``Apparently they're a little bit seasick, but aside from that we
haven't had any other adverse reports,'' he said.
   Tim Brownlow, a Rowan crew member who had been scheduled to meet
the rig in Europe, said the life pod has enough food and water for
days and can stay afloat in the roughest weather.
   ``Have you ever put a cork in a bathtub? That's what it's like,''
said Brownlow, who has worked on oil rigs for eight years. ``They're
a self-righting capsule. They can flip, flip, flip and it will keep
righting itself.
   ``There will be some sick puppies tonight.''
   The rig began listing after one of its ballast tanks cracked and
began taking in water, said Danny McNease, vice president of
operations for the Rowan Co. He said the rig, about 300 feet wide
and 300 feet long, was built to withstand 100-foot waves and 80 mph
winds.
   The rig, which is not under lease to an oil company, left Halifax
last week for the 30-day trip across the Atlantic to the North Sea.
It can carry 86 men. It is a jack-up rig, meaning its platform sits
atop huge legs that are embedded in the sea floor during drilling.

<TEXT>
   A fonmer deacon of a faith-healing sect was
sentenced to 41 months in prison Thursday for failing to seek
medical help for his dying, diabetic son.
   Bobby Norman, 43, who was convicted in October of first-degree
manslaughter in the death of his son, Aaron, was a deacon in a
nameless Christian fellowship that followed a literal translation of
the Bible, distrusted conventional medicine, and practiced strict
discipline of members.
   Aaron Norman, 10, died of complications related to juvenile
diabetes at his parent's Mead home Dec. 20, 1987, the day after he
was spanked by his father and church founder Doug Kleber during a
faith-healing session.
   ``In 15 years as a judge, nothing has bothered me more than this
trial, this sentencing,'' Spokane County Superior Court Judge John
Schultheis said before handing down the sentence to a grim-faced
Norman.
   In brief remarks prior to sentencing, Norman told Schultheis he
loved his son and asked for mercy so that he could remain with his
shattered family, especially an 8-year-old son who is in counseling.
   During an hour-long plea for leniency, defense attorney Roger
Peven argued that Norman was under the influence of Kleber and
former Spokane pastor Jeffrey Siegel.
   Drawing parallels to the followers of the Rev. Jim Jones who
committed mass suicide in Guyana, Peven argued that normally
intelligent people can be seduced by evil people who subvert God's
word to carry out their will.
   Schultheis told Norman that as a parent, ``I have to be the
person that intervenes between the child ... and outside
impediments. You had the absolute obligation to intervene, and you
didn't do it.''
   Deputy Spokane County prosecutor Clark Colwell had asked
Schultheis to find exceptional circumstances that would allow him to
sentence Norman to more than the 31-41 months called for by state
sentencing guidelines.
   Kleber, 34, of Champaign-Urbana, Ill., was sentenced Dec. 7 to
three years in prison after pleading guilty to second-degree
criminal mistreatment. He founded the sect, dubbed the ``No Name
Fellowship'' as a prayer group of Christian athletes at the
University of Illinois in the 1970s, where he played football.
   Siegel, 33, of Chapel Hill, N.C., also pleaded guilty to
second-degree criminal mistreatment and was sentenced to a two-year
term.
   Testimony during Norman's three-week trial indicated the gravely
ill boy was beaten the day before his death by his father and
Kleber, while Siegel and other church members watched. The spankings
were believed necessary to get the boy to confess to what they
called the sin of masturbation, which church elders believed was the
cause of his illness.
   Norman, a 24-year Burlington Northern Railroad employee,
testified that he believed Kleber's assurances that his son was
recovering, despite physical signs to the contrary.
   Norman and his wife, Judith, originally were charged with
homicide by abuse. The charge against the Norman was later reduced
to first-degree manslaughter and charges against Mrs. Norman were
dismissed.
   Charges of second-degree criminal mistreatment also are pending
against three other former sect leaders, whose trials are scheduled
for next year.
   The fellowship, which at its peak claimed about 300 adult members
in four states, disbanded in February.

historic policy toward Yasser Arafat's Palestine Liberation
Organization by declaring it is ready for ``substantive dialogue''
with the group the United States has long denounced as a terrorist
outcast on the world scene.
   The announcement Wednesday night left Israel in diplomatic
isolation and came just a few hours after President-elect Bush had
taken a tough line against the PLO, declaring that it had not met
U.S. conditions for direct dealings.
   But President Reagan and Secretary of State George P. Shultz said
that Arafat, in statements made in Geneva about the same time that
Bush was speaking, had met the U.S. conditions for a ``substantive
dialogue'' _ a form of diplomatic acceptance long sought by the
Palestinian group.
   Shultz said Arafat's group had accepted U.N. Security Council
resolutions 242 and 338, recognized Israel's right to exist in peace
and security, and renounced terrorism.
   Opening meetings will be conducted in Tunis, where the PLO has
its headquarters, by U.S. Ambassador Robert H. Pelletreau Jr.

   Despite a Soviet vow to continue
searching for survivors of the Armenian earthquake, foreign rescue
teams that worked in Spitak said they were told to stop digging so
the town can be bulldozed.
   Sixty survivors were discovered in the earthquake's ruins
Wednesday, eight days after the quake rattled the southern Caucasus
region, leaving an estimated 55,000 people dead and 500,000 homeless.
   Search teams with tracker dogs from Italy and West Germany told a
Toronto Globe and Mail reporter that they had been ordered out of
Spitak, a town of 25,000 people nearly totally destroyed by the
quake.
   They said Soviet authorities said they were preparing to blast
the ruins and bulldoze the city to prevent decomposing bodies from
starting an epidemic.

   A congressional study places the largest
government estimate yet on the price of bailing out the nation's
failing savings and loans, and says the cost could soar even higher
unless action is taken quickly.
   The General Accounting Office says the government should spend
$112 billion to close failed institutions and abandon its current
strategy of trying to keep the institutions alive through assisted
mergers.
   GAO said the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp., or FSLIC,
will need $85 billion over and above the $27 billion it expects to
collect in fees from S&Ls through 1998.
   However, the congressional auditing and investigative agency
warned that the pricetag will be even higher if interest rates rise.
Most economists expect rates to climb through the middle of next
year, but offer no firm predictions beyond that.

   With a few words from prolific science fiction
author Isaac Asimov, the voyage of laser beams through a shark-proof
underwater fiber-optic cable began a new era of trans-Atlantic
communications.
   The cable, thinner than a child's wrist, went into service
Wednesday and can carry 40,000 phone calls between the United States
and Europe simultaneously, double the capacity of its trans-Atlantic
copper-cable predecessors combined.
   Asimov, author of more than 400 books of science fiction, spoke
the first official words on the cable in a three-way video
conference connecting New York, London and Paris.
   ``Welcome, everybody, to this historic trans-Atlantic crossing _
this maiden voyage across the sea on a beam of light,'' Asimov said
at 10:30 a.m. EST, his voice instantly flashed as coded pulses of
laser light through the more than 3,500 miles of cable.

   Fallen whiz kid Barry Minkow listened grimly
as a jury announced ``guilty'' 57 times on fraud charges in a $25
million swindle that snared Wall Street brokerages, major banks and
small investors.
   The 22-year-old defendant, who launched his ZZZZ Best carpet
cleaning business in his parents' garage at age 16, had been trying
to make a plea bargain only hours before the U.S. District Court
jury convicted him on all counts of securities, credit card and mail
fraud charges.
   The jury rejected Minkow's claim that he was a frightened young
boy forced by mobsters into a life of crime, and accepted the
prosecution's portrayal of him as a shrewd young con man with a
thirst for money, power and fame.
   Minkow could be sentenced to up to 300 years in prison. Judge
Dickran Tevrizian set sentencing for Feb. 21.

   The time has come for those strangely ironic
symptoms that seem inappropriate to the season, but the Rev. Lee
Fullerton offers some reassurance: Those ``holiday blues'' are
really quite common.
   As noted in pastoral and psychiatric counselling, the melancholy
oddly descends most widely in the presumably happiest periods,
especially the weeks from Thanksgiving to Christmas.
   ``It's when you're suppose to feel good and be happy,'' said
Fullerton, an Atlanta pastor who has worked extensively in the
mental health field. ``But a lot of people don't feel that way.''
   There's a simple system for helping ward off that despondency, he
said _ talking about it with relatives, friends or fellow church
members, or getting them to open up about it.
   ``You can't just pull people out of it,'' he said. ``But it can
help to encourage them to talk about it, to let them know that most
people have such feelings once in a while.''
   As a costless Christmas present to others, he suggested in a
telephone interview: ``Pay a little more attention to people.''
   Fullerton, 39, pastor of Atlanta's Steward Avenue United
Methodist Church and formerly a pastoral counselor at the Georgia
Mental Health Institute, has written some pre-Christmas advice on
the subject for fellow clergy.
   It was distributed by the urban mission arm of the denomination's
North Georgia conference.
   Fullerton cited two main factors that bring on the slump in mood:
The holiday reality often doesn't match the popularized image, and
the pace of activities all around appear abnormally accelerated and
burdensome.
   ``Everything seems speeded up, the merchandising going into a
frenzy, people getting behind in their shopping and having to fight
crowds and traffic to do anything,'' he said. ``It zaps their energy
and their enjoyment, too.''
   More basically for many, the problem is shattered expectations,
he said.
   ``They've grown up thinking Christmas should be a big family
gathering, with gifts and everybody around and food on the table.
But that's often not the way things are.''
   In many cases, the contrast is acute for single people, for
one-parent families, for the homeless and other poor that ``don't
have enough money to get the one gift a child has wanted all year.''
   For these and others in similar circumstances, the typically
portrayed images of Christmas simply don't live up to the reality
and ``it's as if something had died,'' Fullerton said.
   ``It shows on them. They feel guilty. They blame themselves.
They're a lot harder on themselves in judgment than God would ever
be. By such harsh judgments, emotionally and physically, we're
ruining our health.''
   In the pamphlet for clergy, Fullerton said ``the church has the
unique opportunity'' to do two special things: to ``proclaim the
holiday season as a time for thanksgiving, expectation and
celebration,'' and to ``minister to those who do not feel thankful,
expectant or celebrative.''
   He said seasonal depression also can bring related illnesses such
as ulcers and headaches, and also result in family disputes and
violence. ``When people feel helpless and hopeless, the tendency to
lash out is greater. Law enforcement and victims' assistance
officers receive more requests for services'' than at any other time
of year.
   Although Christmas blues are quite common, he said many people
suppress them because ``they feel guilty or ahsamed,'' but a
sensitive pastor can spot those seeming listless, disinterested or
restless and offer comfort.
   He suggested pastors build sermons on cases of biblical
characters who endured despair, or inviting psychiatrists or
hospital chaplains to address church groups on anxiety and
depression.
   Help people to see the holiday blues as ``normal,'' he advised,
encouraging them to share their troubles with others. He said
pastors are not immune to the problem in this busy season, and tells
them:
   ``Be aware of your own limitations.''
   Fullerton said the holiday slump usually starts out as a kind of
``low grade depression,'' and a little help can stop it from
``getting even deeper down the line.
   ``A lot of deep-seated problems start like this, as a seasonal
problem, but those who stay in it get worse and worse and end up
very depressed.'' The results, he added, can be serious, such as
heavy drinking or suicidal impulses.
   But why this inconsistent mixture of sadness creeping into a time
of joy?
   ``I see it as strangely consistent in the Christian faith,'' he
said. ``At Christmas, there's an element of being down in the pit,
and God comes to you there.
   ``You couldn't accept it any other way, and the situation seems
you would never get out, but God comes in.''

   The Earth is ``under siege by the invasion
of human products that destroy its atmosphere, its water, its flora
and fauna,'' says a conference of 40 scientists and Christian
theologians.
   Citing damage to the ozone layer, degrading of land, pollution of
water below and above ground, toxic materials injected into the air,
deforestation intensifying droughts and floods, the conference says:
   ``God's earth faces a crisis... As the recognition of God's land
onwership gave way to the notion of human ownership, land became a
commodity ... Humans began treating the land as a resource rather
than a created partner.''
   The conference was jointly sponsored last month by the North
American Conference on Christianity and Ecology and the World
Alliance of Reformed Churches, embracing 161 Reformed and
Presbyterian denominations totaling about 70 million members.

was to return in January to Australia to serve the Anglican Church
there, although her future in it as a priest was uncertain.

   Southern Baptists now feel more free to
speak out on social issues because they no longer bear the shame of
racial segregation, says the head of the denomination's moral
concerns agency.
   The Rev. Richard Land, executive director of the Southern Baptist
Christain Life Commission, told seminary students that Southern
Baptists had hesitated to deal with social problems because of fear
of being criticized for segregation.
   ``I think we at least had the decency at some level of
consciousness to be ashamed of the segregation captivity of our
churches for most of our history,'' he said. ``We were not able to
apply our ethical position on social issues until we were liberated
from that.''
   Beyond that, he said a different understanding of the separation
of church and state has caused a ``sudden upsurge'' in the
denomination's political involvement.
   ``I think the separation of church and state was used as an
excuse for not getting involved as much as it was a conviction over
whether we should be involved,'' he said.

<HEAD>Watch Those Interest Rates</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Individual and corporate credit users of late
have been treating rising interest rates with a calm that hardly
befits the situation.
   The perception, widely held, is that the economy now is better
able to handle its debt because many more loans than before carry
adjustable interest rates. Flexibility is built in _ or so it is
said.
   A strong argument can be made, however, that the economy instead
is much more credit-sensitive than before. The viewpoint involves,
among other things, the type of credit, the amount and length of it,
and the tax consequences.
   The calm view of the credit future involves a view of adjustable
rate loans, which are far more common on big consumer items than in
years gone by. Many see these loans as a positive factor in the
credit outlook.
   That is, instead of being denied loans, as frequently occurred in
the days of fixed-interest rates, borrowers will be granted credit.
This, it is argued, lessens the dangers of a credit crunch that
would bring the economy down.
   A more concerned view of the situation, however, sees adjustable
loans as a threat to stability. With interest rates rising, people
may find themselves unable to remain current on loan payments. Same
effect: The economy suffers.
   But there are even more vital elements involved.
   Except for home mortgage loans, interest on adjustable-rate
consumer loans will be taxed more heavily next year. Currently, 40
percent of interest escapes federal income taxes. Next year, the
deductible percentage drops to 20.
   Rising interest rates and falling deductibility, therefore, can
produce a one-two punch that could put some folks down for the count.
   Moreover, many of these consumer loans are for periods
considerably longer than just a decade ago, and that too can create
problems. Car loans are made for as long as five years now, which
often may be longer than the life of the car.
   Stress already is becoming serious in some automobile markets,
with the repossession rate rising markedly this year. But
repossession doesn't always resolve the problem. Some five-year-old
cars simply aren't worth taking back.
   The corporate market has its own problems. Business demand for
short-term credit has been fueled by the surge of leveraged buyout
activity. Some of these loans probably are poor to begin with, but
an increase in interest rates, and perhaps an economic downturn as
well, might quickly turn them into bad loans.
   It might not take much of a downturn to show how unsound some of
these LBO loans are, because many were made on the basis of cash
flow analyses that were optimistic even for a booming economy.
   LBOs also are soaking up liquidity, threatening to limit funds
available for more productive activities. Illiquidity could develop
in 1989 because gross national product has been growing much faster
than total bank reserves.
   Congress could radically change the game too, although the chance
of it being able to do so within the next year is questionable.
Still, it is possible that a Congress trying to reduce budget
deficits might seek revenue by taxing some of the LBO debt. Right
now, interest companies pay on LBO debt isn't taxed.
   Perhaps the nicest thing that can be said about the credit
situation is that interest rates might not rise, as so many
forecasters expect and as Fed policy would seem to indicate.
   Among others, for example, Merrill Lynch & Co. expects that a
slowing of economic growth in 1989 will allow interest rates to fall
sharply. But even if they do, there's an awful lot of debt out there
to be serviced.

<HEAD>Crewmen of Seized Ship Have Lost No Bitterness</HEAD>
<NOTE>With LaserPhoto</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By BILL BASKERVILL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>FAIRFAX, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two days before Christmas 20 years ago, the
captive crewmen of the spy ship USS Pueblo crossed the ``Bridge of
No Return'' to freedom, but they still haven't put their bitterness
behind them.
   ``I thought they would shoot me in the back,'' recalled crew
member Harry Iredale. ``I didn't believe it until I was on the other
side.''
   ``I felt like I had just come back from the dead,'' said Lloyd
Bucher, captain of the ship that had been seized on the high seas by
North Korea, the first such taking of a U.S. warship in a century
and a half.
   The crewmembers remain angry at the American military's failure
to protect the lightly armed vessel or to come to its aid.
   ``There were so many people at the Joint Chiefs of Staff level on
down who weren't paying attention to their damn job,'' said Bucher.
``They would have greatly preferred for the North Koreans to have
done us in completely.''
   Instead, one crewman was killed in the attack and the 82 others
were subjected to 11 months of brutal captivity.
   ``The U.S. at that time had enormous military forces in the
western Pacific within 5 minutes flying time of us,'' Bucher, now
61, said in a telephone interview from his home in Poway, Calif. ``I
would have thought something could be mustered to come to our aid.
But everybody just forgot we were there.''
   Iredale, 44, of Fairfax, was a civilian oceanographer employed by
the Navy and assigned to the Pueblo to provide a cover for the
ship's real mission of collecting electronic intelligence. He
believes the capture demonstrated an American naivete about the
world.
   Conducting espionage off the North Korean coast was not the same
as running similar missions off the Soviet Union, he said. ``The
North Koreans didn't play by the rules.''
   Throughout the attack, seizure and early days of captivity,
Iredale said, ``We expected someone to come over the horizon to
rescue us.''
   Robert J. Chicca, a Marine sergeant who worked as a Korean
linguist on the Pueblo, said he still finds it difficult to believe
there was no retaliation.
   ``I would lay the blame on every military commander who was in
helping range and didn't come,'' said Chicca, 44, in a telephone
interview from his home in Bonita, Calif.
   Retired Adm. John J. Hyland, commander in chief of the Pacific
Fleet at the time, said it is difficult to provide protection for a
spy ship.
   Writing in this fall's issue of Naval History magazine, Hyland
said, ``There isn't any way you can do anything for an
intellgience-gathering ship unless you want to accompany it with a
destroyer, which would defeat the purpose.''
   Bucher, who retired from the Navy in 1973 after 27{ years of
service, said the lack of preparedness that permitted the Pueblo
humiliation persists in the military today.
   Pointing to the failed mission to rescue American hostages in
Iran in 1980 and the terrorist bombing that killed more than 200
Marines in Beirut in 1983, he said, ``As the years have passed I
have learned of the incredible disarray our defenses are in.''
   The weather was clear and cold on Jan. 23, 1968, as the Pueblo
lolled about 15 miles off the North Korean coast _ three miles
outside the communist nation's territorial waters.
   Iredale was taking water-temperature measurements as four North
Korean torpedo boats and two subchasers, all heavily armed,
approached the 176-foot Pueblo around noon.
   ``They circled around and had their guns trained on us,'' Iredale
said.
   A subchaser raised a signal flag asking the Pueblo's nationality,
and Bucher ordered the hoisting of the American flag. When the
subchaser ordered the Pueblo to follow it, the American ship began
to move away.
   One of the boats suddenly opened fire on the Pueblo with its 57mm
cannon, slightly wounding Bucher and another crewman. A later salvo
killed Fireman Duane Hodges and wounded Chicca and several others.
   Bucher ordered the Pueblo stopped and stalled for time as crewmen
radioed for help and frantically destroyed classified documents.
   Shortly after 2 p.m. the Pueblo, which never fired a shot from
its .50-caliber machine guns, was boarded by about 10 North Korean
soldiers clad in olive green quilted jackets and carrying submachine
guns.
   The Pueblo became the first American warship captured since 1807
when a British ship forced the USS Chesapeake to surrender off the
Virginia capes.
   After the North Koreans failed to extract ``confessions'' from
the men during initial interrogations, the torture and beatings
began.
   ``They wanted us to say we were inside their territorial waters
and spying on them,'' Iredale said.
   ``You were helpless, and after a while, hopeless.''
   The worst part of the imprisonment was ``hell week,'' which came
late in the crew's captivity, Iredale said.
   ``They had me kneel down and took a hammer handle and started
pounding my head. They put a board on the back of my knees and
jumped up and down on it.
   ``After it stopped they came in and gave me a pail of water and a
brush to wash my blood off the floor and stucco walls,'' Iredale
said.
   Bucher said he was ``kicked into unconsciousness. That I endured
a few times.''
   Chicca's nose was broken several times. ``They didn't like
Marines,'' he said.
   Freedom finally came on Dec. 23 at the bridge separating North
Korea and South Korea _ but only after American officials signed an
apology that they immediately repudiated.
   A Navy court of inquiry recommended a court-martial for Bucher,
who violated the hallowed Navy code of ``don't give up the ship.''
That finding was reduced to a letter of reprimand by the commander
of the Pacific Fleet.
   The court of inquiry also recommended a reprimand for the admiral
responsible for ensuring the Pueblo's safety.
   Secretary of the Navy John B. Chafee overturned the panel's
recommendations on the day they were made public, saying the Pueblo
crew had suffered enough.
   ``If he (Bucher) hadn't surrendered they would have blown the
ship out of the water,'' Iredale said. ``It would be suicide.''
   Bucher said he was under orders to observe the North Koreans but
``not to incite them.''
   Still, he said in some ways he feels personally responsible.
``Whatever I was unable to do are the things I feel worst about,''
he said.
   ``If I had a way to destroy the ship, we would have abandoned it
and blown it up. I tried to get cans of TNT before we sailed, but
the Navy said they didn't have any.''

<HEAD>B.B. Takes Lucille From the Blues to U2</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LARRY McSHANE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   For years, playing the blues was a sure way to
get them, says guitar great B.B. King.
   ``That has hit me pretty hard, that the blues were not popular
for a long time,'' said King, recalling the days in the 1960s and
'70s when he was more popular in Europe than at home. ``It was like
being black twice. But I kept working hard, kept practicing, kept
playing.''
   He and ``Lucille,'' his guitar, are still playing. After
overcoming prejudice both racial and musical, King is now revered as
a blues giant; he's just released his 52nd blues album, and he
almost steals the show from U2 in their concert movie, ``U2 Rattle
and Hum.''
   ``I was in Ireland, and (U2 lead singer) Bono came by,'' King
said recently about their collaboration. ``I'd always admired him
and the group, and we talked about songwriting. I told him to think
of me when he was writing, and he said, `OK, I'll do it.'''
   The result, ``When Love Comes to Town,'' features King swapping
vocals with Bono and playing his distinctive lead guitar over U2's
backbeat _ a merging of the Mississippi delta and the Emerald Isle
recorded at the renowned Sun Studios in Memphis, Tenn.
   King, 63, was born in Indianola, Miss., and took up the guitar at
an early age. He started out playing and singing gospel, but soon
began taking requests from churchgoers for more secular music.
Making the guitar a career, he recalled, was a financial decision
easily reached.
   ``I made $22.50 on a plantation driving a tractor all week.
Playing guitar on a Saturday night I made $25 _ understand, that's
for one evening,'' King said. ``That's when I decided.''
   King moved to Memphis after World War II, dubbing himself the
``Beale Street Blues Boy'' _ later shortened to B.B. In 1951, he
scored his first hit with ``3 O'Clock Blues'' and his career was off
and running.
   But during the British Invasion of the '60s and the disco craze
of the '70s, King and his music slipped into the background. Despite
the lack of acclaim, King never considered playing any other music.
   ``No, I didn't even think about it; I never felt that way,'' he
said. ``I felt bad, I felt ridiculed, looked down upon for doing
this kind of music. I wished it was different, but everything I play
is bluesy.''
   King said his instantly-recognizable guitar style was developed
more because of his ears than his hands: ``I can't hear lows, so I
would turn the treble up. That's how it started.''
   But it's evolving to this day, he said before a Manhattan
appearance at the Benson and Hedges Blues Festival to benefit the
homeless.
   ``It's always changing. I'm influenced by everything. There are
young people today who come up and say they idolize me _ I learn
from them. It's a round-robin.''
   Another thing that has the veteran musician smiling is the number
of current artists who are acknowledging the blues ``are the mother
of all music.'' King cited Robert Cray as a particular favorite.
Then he named another musician who loved the blues: the late John
Lennon.
   ``I remember once an interviewer asked John Lennon what he'd like
to being doing. And he said, `Playing guitar, playing the blues like
B.B. King,''' King said. ``He never knew what that meant to me. It
feels good to hear people talk like that.''
   Despite his advancing years, King keeps an active schedule; he
estimates spending 300 days a year on the road. And he has no
intention of hanging up ``Lucille'' any time in the near future.
   ``When the great creator says it's enough, that's when I'll
stop,'' said King. ``What else would I do? It's like Count Basie
told me one time: My friends are around the world. If I stopped
playing, how could I see them all?''

   Another holiday season brings a riot of photography
books, on subjects ranging from the honey hunters in Nepal to water
towers, taken by photographers from Ansel Adams to f-stop Fitzgerald.
   All of the people who have been storing those back issues of
National Geographic can throw them out if they can come up with $65
for ``Odyssey: The Art of Photography at National Geographic''
(Thomasson-Grant). The selections from 100 years of National
Geographic photography are rich in quality and variety.
   Among other retrospectives, John Loengard has assembled ``Life
Classic Photography: A Personal Interpretation'' (New York Graphic
Society, $24.95). Each photograph is accompanied by a succinct,
provocative statement on how the shot came to be, giving it a
textbook value.
   The West is at the top of landscape books with two works from the
Graphic Society: ``Ansel Adams: Letter and Images'' ($50), and Eliot
Porter's ``The West'' ($60). The Adams book is distinguished by the
late photographer's lucid personal reflections on his art, while
Porter's shots stand alone with the luster of oil paintings.
   To complete the history lesson, the life and work of a Western
photography pioneer can be found in ``William Henry Jackson and the
Transformation of the American Landscape,'' by Peter B. Hales
(Temple University Press, $39.95).
   The hit of the Midwest is ``Hometowns: An American Pilgrimage''
(Graphic Society, $50). George Tice looks for a connection between
three little Midwestern towns and three large figures they produced:
James Dean's Fairmount, Ind.; Ronald Reagan's Dixon, Ill.; and Mark
Twain's Hannibal, Mo.
   ``Wayfarer: A Voice From the Southern Mountains'' (Oxmoor House,
$50), is photographer William A. Bake's fourth book on the South.
The poet James Dickey spins an interesting but uneven tale to
accompany the photographs.
   One of the best features on New England comes from Life magazine
legend Alfred Eisenstaedt, who in ``Eisenstaedt: Martha's Vineyard''
(Oxmoor House, $35), lets us in on his personal collection of 50
years of photographing his summer place.
   From more exotic places come rare glimpses at ``The Honey Hunters
of Nepal,'' by Eric Valli (Abrams, $29.95), and ``The Whisper of
Stars: A Siberian Journey'' (The Globe Pequot Press, $24.95). The
first offers breathtaking shots of the Gurung tribe committing the
cliff-hanging robberies that have helped sustain the Himalayan
people for centuries. In the second, Boston Globe two-time Pulitzer
Prize-winner Stan Grossfeld captures the warmth and life of an
almost mythically forbidding land.
   There also are portraits aplenty this year, from the popular
study of the ruling house of Windsor in ``Cecil Beaton: The Royal
Portraits'' (Simon and Schuster, $35), to Sally Mann's evocative
look at girls on the brink of maturity, ``At Twelve: Portraits of
Young Women'' (New Images, $25).
   At the head of the class is ``Album: The Portraits of Duane
Michals 1958-1988'' (Twelvetrees Press, $55). Michals says he is
only sharing an encounter he had with movie stars and ordinary
people, that most were strangers to him and therefore his portraits
revealed ``nothing profound about the subjects or captured
anything.'' But there is an almost palpable self-consciousness _ on
the part of the subjects and the photographer _ that gives these
portraits a special freshness.
   ``Nicholas Nixon: Pictures of People'' (Graphic Society, $40),
coincides with the Museum of Modern Art's first retrospective on the
41-year-old photographer. His use of a large-format camera, not in
vogue since Walker Evans' Depression-era work, forces some sobering
confrontations with subjects such as the elderly and AIDS victims.
   Like Beaton, Patrick Lichfield's royal portraits helped make him
one of the few British photographers to work for Vogue. His
portraits and pictures from a style that emerged from commercial
work are presented in ``Lichfield in Retrospect'' (Salem House, $35).
   Jazz lovers will be thrilled with ``Jazz: A Visual
Retrospective'' (Billboard Publications, $60). Designer K. Abe has
combed archives for portraits so often revealing because the
subjects, as critic Nat Hentoff says in introducing the 350
photographs, ``are less likely than most people to wear masks.''
   An insider's look at 50 years of jazz can be found in ``Bass
Line: The Stories and Photographs of Milt Hinton,'' by Hinton and
David G. Berger (Temple University Press, $39.95). The great bass
player also has a remarkable eye.
   For cultural significance there may be no more important a book
than Peter Weiermair's ``The Hidden Image'' (The MIT Press, $45), a
look at the evolution of the male nude in photography. But like
``Robert Mapplethorpe'' (Graphic Society, $50), whose beautiful work
has long been augmented with sometimes shocking male nudes, the book
will not be of general appeal.
   If one of photography's aims is to draw attention to details we
might otherwise give little notice, there is no more successful book
than MIT Press' $50 ``Water Towers,'' by Bernd and Hilla Becher. The
effect can only be realized by leafing through the Bechers'
groupings of these often overlooked staples of the industrial
landscape.
   Among other books of interest, author Stephen King and
photographer f-stop Fitzgerald (his legal name) take a look at
gargoyles in ``Nightmares in the Sky'' (Viking Studio Books,
$29.95); Ansel Adams and writer John Hersey's talents help make
potent ``Manzanar'' (Times Books, $27.50), a look at one of the
Japanese internment camps of World War II; Carl Chiarenza's
``Landscapes of the Mind'' (David R. Godine, $40), is studio work
for the most serious artists.

<HEAD>Feds Restoring Salmon Run for Indians</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JEFF BARNARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>UMATILLA, Ore. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Few people remember the days before
irrigation dams killed the salmon runs on the Umatilla River.
   But the Umatilla Indians never forgot, and more than 70 years
after the river's waters became the property of white farmers, the
Indians are seeing salmon returning as a result of a huge federal
commitment to restore a part of the circle of life.
   ``It's like a part of us returns, part of my body,'' said Louie
Dick Jr., vice chairman of the board of trustees for the Umatilla
tribe. ``Because that is part of my body, the salmon.''
   About 600 members of the tribe still live on a reservation just
east of Pendleton, about 40 miles up the Umatilla River from where
it empties into the Columbia River at this town.
   The treaty that put them on the reservation in 1855 was supposed
to guarantee the right to gather traditional foods in their usual
places, including the salmon swimming up the Umatilla River.
   But after 1914, when a series of five irrigation dams was built,
so much water was diverted for farms there wasn't enough left in the
riverbed for the coho and chinook salmon to swim through the broad
shallow stretches and over 24-foot-tall Three-Mile Dam to spawn in
the headwaters and tributaries.
   Only the steelhead, a type of rainbow trout related to salmon,
survived the dams, because they could wait for the winter rains to
raise the river and were better at climbing the crude fish ladders.
   For the Umatilla tribe, the loss of the salmon left a gap in the
circle of eight inseparable elements that make up life: speech,
food, religion, shelter, clothing, water, the land and the person.
   ``When we talk of food, we talk of food that Creator, he lent
this to us,''said Dick.
   ``What you would call the amber waves of grain are not really
that important to an Indian background. I know the farmer says
irrigation is bread and gives food to the person. To the Indian
person, no.''
   In 1980, Congress created the Northwest Power Planning Council
with a mandate to restore fish runs wiped out by dams in the
Columbia River system. That's when the Umatilla treaty began to have
power.
   Working with the council, the Bonneville Power Administration, a
branch of the U.S. Department of Energy that markets power from 28
dams, has spent $8 million on the Umatilla, and is committed to a
total of $25 million, said Jay Marcotte, manager of the Umatilla
basin project for BPA.
   Congress ordered BPA, because it sells electricity from dams that
devastated fish runs, to set aside a portion of its profits
``protect, mitigate and enhance'' fish and wildlife.
   The U.S. Forest Service and the Umatilla Indians use that money
on their respective lands, and the Oregon Department of Fish and
Wildlife uses it on private land, to stop erosion that smothers
spawning beds, to deepen shallow channels, and to build new fish
ladders, traps and outtake screens on the dams. A new hatchery is
planned near the mouth of the river.
   Between 1981 and 1987, BPA's expenditures to improve Columbia
basin fish runs included $120 million in direct payments and, it
calculated, four times that much in indirect payments such as lost
revenue from storing water to help fish get over the dams rather
than using it to turn turbines.
   Gary James, who manages the fisheries program for the Umatilla
Indians, is seeing the effects.
   ``This was the very first year we've gotten adult coho back to
the river,'' he said. ``We've got a total of about 1,500 coho back
so far. The fall chinook we are getting is the best run we've had,
too. The total run of adults and jacks is approaching 1,500 as
well.''
   In the next 15 years, James hopes to see 40,000 salmon and
steelhead returning annually, with 15,000 reaching the headwaters to
spawn.
   November marked the first time in more than 70 years that the
Umatilla Indians have been able to take salmon from the river
carrying their name.
   The fishing place and the memories of salmon in this river are so
distant from the reservation that few took advantage. But more are
expected as the runs improve.
   Dan Mills, a farmer on the board of the Stanfield Irrigation
District, stood in hip boots and wielded a net as he helped state
biologists gather fish in a trap at Three-Mile Dam to analyze the
success of various smolt releases.
   ``Agriculture has kind of been in direct competition with what's
going on here,'' Mills said. ``As long as we can work together on
it, it will be an excellent deal. There's also no way of stopping it.
   ``For every one of us with irrigation rights, there's 50 guys who
want to go fishing.''
   The biggest improvement of all will be a $42 million U.S. Bureau
of Reclamation project to supply local farmers with water from the
Columbia River. That will leave for the fish the water that farmers
used to take from the Umatilla. The program has been approved by
Congress, but has yet to be financed.
   ``The government created the problem by subsidizing all the
irrigation system dams built early in the century,'' said James.
``Before that, the water was to be kept in the river so the salmon
could reach the reservation.
   ``I like the way the irrigators' attorney put it. The government
sold the car twice, and now both parties want to drive it.''
   ``This was one of the few situations where the tribe and the
irrigators thought it was a win-win situation.''

<HEAD>Maverick Researcher's Approach to Developing Cancer Drugs Is
Faltering</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP Extra</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL RAEBURN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>FRANKLIN, Tenn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A maverick researcher's efforts to speed
tests on unproven cancer therapies by selling them to any patients
willing to pay is faltering.
   Dr. Robert K. Oldham, founder of Biotherapeutics Inc., has so far
been unable to show that the treatments, which cost as much as
$24,000, can prolong lives or reduce the severity of symptoms.
   Although patients stoutly defend their right to seek his
experimental help, Oldham is failing to attract enough patients to
make a profit. What is more, he has been attacked by doctors and
scientists who say it's unethical, and possibly dangerous, to sell
treatments not yet shown to work.
   Dr. Arnold Relman, editor of the New England Journal of Medicine,
says patients who go to Oldham ``are people desperate with fear.
They're dying of cancer. And they're encouraged to believe there
might be some hope. It's cruel deception. It's commercial
exploitation of a tragedy. I think it's totally immoral.''
   Biotherapeutics was the first profit-making enterprise to take
advantage of government reluctance to allow sales of most
experimental drugs until they've been throroughly tested for safety
and effectiveness.
   Oldham's daring decision to sell such unproven treatments to the
public, and risk federal closure, has put Biotherapeutics in the
midst of a debate over what the government might do to speed
delivery of new drugs to dying patients.
   The outcome is vitally important to anyone who will be touched by
cancer, AIDS, heart disease or any other incurable ailment.
   Oldham is selling what are called immune therapies. They have
been widely touted as an important fourth weapon against cancer,
augmenting the triple arsenal of chemotherapy, radiation and surgery
that cure only about half of the almost 1 million Americans
diagnosed with cancer each year.
   Immune therapies, sometimes called biological therapies, are
intended to provoke the body's immune system to destroy invading
cancer cells.
   The hope _ and so far it remains little more than a hope _ is
that the therapies may attack tumors impervious to conventional
therapies.
   Another potential advantage is that the immune system may target
cancer cells more accurately than conventional treatments, thus
producing fewer of the harmful side effects often associated with
chemotherapy and radiation.
   Dr. Steven A. Rosenberg of the National Cancer Institute, who has
done much of the pioneering work in biological therapy, calls this
``the dawn of a new approach to treating cancer.''
   ``I've now had almost 20 patients with widespread, metastatic
cancer that's disappeared,'' Rosenberg said in an interview.
   Rosenberg is, however, a sharp critic of Oldham. He asserts that
biological therapy is not ready for widespread use. ``The worst
thing we can do is raise false expectations,'' he said.
   Biotherapeutics Inc. is located in a squat, modern, red-brick
building just outside Franklin, an antebellum town 18 miles south of
Nashville with a picturesque square frequently sought out by
moviemakers.
   The building's Y-shaped entrance resembles an antibody molecule,
a reminder of the company's use of cancer antibodies in some
treatments.
   Oldham, the company's dominant presence, is a well-known
researcher with more than 300 papers to his credit. Among his
accomplishments, he lists the discovery of certain white blood cells
called natural killer cells, which help defend the body against
disease.
   He began his research career at the National Cancer Institute. He
left in 1975 to establish the cancer program at Vanderbilt
University but returned to the cancer institute in 1980 to initiate
research on biological therapy for cancer.
   He left the institute again in 1984, this time to set up
Biotherapeutics, which focuses almost exclusively on the use of
biological anti-cancer agents.
   Oldham is a tough, combative man. He bristles at criticism of
Biotherapeutics and seeks opportunities to defend himself and his
enterprise.
   If cancer patients want the treatments he offers _ whether those
treatments work or not _ then the patients ought to get them, Oldham
says. ``Where does society come off saying you can't have it?'' he
argued.
   For more than three years, Oldham has sidestepped federal
regulations on the sale of experimental treatments by claiming to be
in the business of patient-funded research.
   Oldham says he is not selling treatment. He says he's recruiting
patients to serve as subjects in cancer research _ and to pay for
the privilege.
   He says what he is doing is no different from what the National
Cancer Institute is doing, except for the source of the funding. The
cancer institute gets its money from Congress; Biotherapeutics gets
its money from patients.
   But is Oldham selling research? Interviews with patients, Oldham
and other company officials suggest that people are coming to
Biotherapeutics not to contribute to a research effort, but to try
to save their lives.
   Here is the wording on a poster outside his office: ``If you had
cancer, and traditional treatments weren't effective, what would you
do? Give up? Or fight, pursuing every option? ... When standard
therapies fail, we offer patients a scientifically valid option.''
   Ask Oldham's patients why they have come to him, and it's clear
they're seeking treatment _ not a chance to be guinea pigs.
   James E. Murphy was recently treated by Oldham for colon cancer.
His doctor in Washington, D.C., had told him he could do nothing
more for him. Why had Murphy come to Oldham?
   ``You don't have any alternative if you want to fight it,'' he
said in an interview in his hospital room. ``Eventually I will die,
but at least I'll give it a shot. ... I think Biotherapeutics
charging (for experimental treatments) is better than not giving
people a shot at it.''
   Murphy, 60, said he hoped his case would help Oldham learn
something that might help others, but that wasn't why he was there.
   A salesman for a computer systems development company, Murphy
said he and his wife paid for his treatment with money from their
retirement account.
   Murphy knows the Biotherapeutics treatment is a long shot. Oldham
explained that well. And he believes that, ideally, experimental
treatments shouldn't be commercialized, as Oldham's are.
   ``But the government isn't doing anything,'' Murphy said. ``You
call the National Institutes of Health and ask about colon cancer
and you get a tape.'' You call Oldham, and if you are have the
strength left and the money, you get treated.

   The two principal therapies Oldham is using are monoclonal
antibodies and adoptive immunotherapy.
   Monoclonal antibodies are protective proteins produced in mice
that have been injected with human cancer cells. Such antibodies
could, theoretically, attack and destroy tumors or could be used to
carry cancer-killing drugs directly to tumors.
   Oldham is selling a monoclonal antibody treatment for $24,000.
Does it work? ``It's too soon to tell,'' he said.
   Adoptive immunotherapy involves taking immune cells from cancer
patients, stimulating the cells with a drug called interleukin-2,
and re-injecting them in the hope the cells will attack the
patients' tumors. The cells are called lymphokine-activated killer
cells, or LAKs.
   This treatment has been shown to be of some help in fighting
melanoma and kidney cancer. Ten percent of such patients show a
dramatic reduction in tumor size, but whether the treatments will
improve or extend their lives is not yet known.
   ``It's probably helping some people,'' said Dr. Bruce Chabner,
director of the cancer treatment program at the National Cancer
Institute. Kidney and other urinary cancers will strike 22,500
Americans this year and melanoma will strike 27,300, says the
American Cancer Society.
   Oldham is selling adoptive immunotherapy for 50 percent off the
regular price of $19,400. Does it work? ``It's too early to tell,''
he said.
   Many of Oldham's critics have questioned why the FDA hasn't acted
to stop Biotherapeutics. Charging for experimental treatments is
usually prohibited by the FDA, according to Dr. Robert Temple, a
director in the FDA's drug evaluation office.
   ``We in general don't think people should be charged for
investigational drugs,'' he said. ``They haven't been shown to work
yet; it's not fair.''
   The FDA says it hasn't made a decision yet on Biotherapeutics.
Many doctors outside the FDA say the agency is knotted in sharp
internal debate.
   Peter Barton Hutt, formerly the FDA's chief counsel and now a
Washington lawyer, put the FDA's fundamental dilemma this way: ``If
someone is desperately ill and has no other hope, should the
government tell them what they can take? Balanced against that, if
the patient is desperately ill and has no hope, should there be
protection against them being defrauded?''
   An additional complication is that Biotherapeutics' company
structure makes it difficult for the FDA to act.
   Biotherapeutics does not send its drugs across state lines. It
has hospital affiliates scattered across the country, but each
hospital has a nearby laboratory that produces drugs according to
the Biotherapeutics recipe.
   Dr. Bruce Burlington, director of the FDA's division of
biological investigational new drugs, said that limits the agency's
ability to act. ``With intrastate activities, there is debate over
the extent of our jurisdiction,'' he said.
   While the FDA ponders its moves, the ethical debate over Oldham's
activities continues.
   Dr. Michael Grodin, a pediatrician and director of the medical
ethics program at Boston University, says Oldham clearly has
conflicting interests.
   As a doctor, he should be helping patients. As a researcher, he
should be trying to advance general knowledge, not to save dying
patients. And as a businessman, he should be trying to keep his
company afloat.
   ``It seems to me that the patient can't sort that out, even if
the researcher can,'' said Grodin.
   The immediate concern of Biotherapeutics is not, however, in
resolving these ethical tangles but in curing the company's
financial ills.
   In the most recent fiscal year, Biotherapeutics lost almost $10
million of the $40 million stake it raised to go into business. It
treated 400 patients, and, said Louis P. Berneman, the company's
president, ``the expectations were that that would have been
higher.'' He wouldn't say exactly what the company had hoped for.
   If management can't turn its troubled finances around, the
company won't survive beyond 1990, said Joseph Clark, its chief
financial officer. Clark added, however, that he had little doubt
that the company would make it.
   It has already taken some drastic steps. The price of its most
expensive product _ the monoclonal antibody treatment _ has been cut
from $35,000 to $24,000. Adoptive immunotherapy is on sale for
$9,700.
   The company hopes to persuade patients' insurance companies to
come up with the rest, although insurance companies as a rule do not
reimburse patients for experimental treatments.
   Biotherapeutics hopes the FDA will approve interleukin-2 next
year for use against kidney cancer and melanoma. Berneman thinks
insurance companies will then reimburse the costs of adoptive
immunotherapy.
   Oldham is determined to press on against whatever odds. ``Some of
our critics would legislate and regulate against us being
available,'' he said. ``And that is wrong.''

<HEAD>No Fan of Perestroika, Castro Sees `Difficulties' with Moscow</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   As his revolution approaches its 30th
birthday, President Fidel Castro has become something of an
ideological renegade in the communist world, waging a lonely
struggle in defense of socialist purity while others experiment with
capitalist reforms.
   His recent speeches underscore his resistance to change. He has
adhered to a strict constructionist viewpoint with only minor
variations since that New Year's day three decades ago when he
toppled a discredited dictator and proceeded to turn Cuba upside
down.
   While the Soviet Union and other communist countries try to
overcome economic stagnation by borrowing some capitalist practices,
Castro remains a no-apologies defender of centralized planning and
state domination of the economy.
   Some analysts even foresee the possibility of the first serious
Soviet-Cuban rift since the two countries became devoted allies in
1968.
   The Soviets are clearly displeased with what they regard as Cuban
misuse of economic aid, which has averaged about $5 billion annually
in recent years.
   In a recent article, the Soviet newspaper Pravda blamed Cuba for
``serious imperfections'' at Soviet-backed industrial projects in
Cuba.
   Castro, meanwhile, makes no attempt to conceal his disdain for
Soviet reforms. Cuba, he has said, ``must watch over the ideological
purity of the revolution. ... That is why we cannot use any methods
that reek of capitalism.''
   He acknowledged recently that his country's future is somewhat
more uncertain as a result of the Kremlin's philosophical shift.
   ``We can expect difficulties that may come from the enemy camp
(the United States) and difficulties that may come from the camp of
our own friends,'' he said.
   In 1986, at about the time Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev
began moving toward capitalist-style reforms, Castro shut down a
six-year experiment involving the sale by farmers of their produce
at market rates. He was afraid that a spreading capitalist mentality
and a high-income elite might take hold.
   Most experts say Cuba is too valuable an ally for Moscow to cut
adrift simply because of differing economic policies. Cuba provides
important political support for Moscow and is widely admired
throughout much of Africa and Latin America.
   Cuba also serves as an indispensable base for Soviet monitoring
of U.S. military and space activities. At one facility alone, 2,100
Soviet technicians engage in intercepts of U.S. communications,
according to American officials.
   Castro had planned a huge welcome here for Gorbachev on Dec. 9
but the visit was postponed on short notice because of the
earthquake in Soviet Armenia.
   Despite the apparent durability of Soviet-Cuban relations,
Castro's unorthodox views have left him somewhat out of the Marxist
mainstream.
   While other countries look on material incentives for workers as
a fact of life that must be accepted as the price for increased
production, Castro believes _ perhaps more firmly than before _ that
people should work not for personal gain but out of a sense of
patriotic duty.
   To the extent that Cuba is undergoing difficult economic times,
Castro says the fault lies not with the system but with human
frailty, the lack of revolutionary zeal. Whatever the reason, the
Cuban economy has been stagnant for more than two years.
   Castro, of course, never has been one to follow the crowd. He has
spent a lifetime overcoming long odds.
   In a recent speech, he recalled the time in December 1956 when,
at the start of his guerrilla struggle, serious setbacks reduced his
forces to no more than a few devoted followers. Defeat seemed
imminent.
   ``Now we are millions,'' he said, using the analogy to underscore
his view that seemingly insurmountable obstacles can be overcome
through patience and political will.
   But as Castro himself has admitted, no challenge for him has been
more difficult than bringing about economic wellbeing for his
countrymen.
   Food and clothing are strictly rationed and there is an acute
shortage of adequate housing. For transportation, Cubans must rely
on buses that too often are overcrowded or make their rounds too
infrequently. Cubans also complain about bureaucratic lethargy and
poor service generally, in restaurants and elsewhere.
   The quality of life for the average Cuban, compared with
developed countries, is dreary although there appear to be few
destitute Cubans. Many workers finds their jobs unfulfilling. Youths
complain about a lack of recreational opportunities.
   As an alternative to the drab government-controlled press, Cubans
these days snatch up Spanish-language Soviet magazines which have a
quality Cuban publications lack: openness.
   Ofelia Espinosa, who works at a local newsstand, said some Soviet
weeklies are sold out in five minutes. ``Two years ago, we used to
throw them out,'' she said.
   There is no overt persecution of Cubans who practice their
religion but such people have little hope of rising to positions of
authority. Christmas was officially abolished years ago because the
celebration interfered with the sugar harvest but there are signs of
a more flexible government attitude nowadays toward that occasion.
   Some families say they are discreetly doing this year what was
unthinkable in previous years: putting up a Christmas tree.
   While there is more tolerance for outspokenness than before,
Cubans who make known their disdain for the system do so at their
own risk. Worker absenteeism has been a problem for all 30 Castro
years, a phenomenon that is not surprising in a country that claims
to guarantee a job for everybody.
   Theft at state enterprises has been a major headache for the
regime. On a secret tape that was smuggled out of Cuba, Defense
Minister Raul Castro said ``1 million police'' couldn't solve the
problem without stricter accounting controls.
   In many professions, requirements of the state leave little room
for creativity. A Cuban judge knows the judiciary is subservient to
the state. A journalist is aware that he must report within the
narrow boundaries imposed by party dogma.
   Cuba also is viewed by the Reagan administration as a threat to
U.S. interests because of its generous support for Nicaragua's
leftist government and aid to guerrilla groups elsewhere.
   A related issue is the militarization of Cuban society. Cuba
spends a higher percentage of its national budget on the military
than all but a few countries worldwide.
   According to U.S. figures, Cuba has 950 battle tanks compared
with Canada's 114. Its military establishment is comparable to that
of Brazil, a country with a population 13 times the size of Cuba's.
   Among nations that have embraced communism, Cuba appears to be
one of the more successful. Several of the more recent converts to
Marxism are wracked by civil war and poverty. In Cuba, there is less
absolute poverty than in any country in Latin America, where
unemployment and underemployment rates run as high as 50 percent.

   For millions of Cubans, Castro remains an inspirational figure.
His oratorical skills are undiminished. He impresses visitors with
the breadth of his interests, ranging from medicine to nuclear
power. Little occurs in Cuba which escapes his restless gaze. Seldom
has a leader of so small a country had an international impact as
great as his.
   He can claim partial credit for the agreement under which South
Africa will grant Namibia, Africa's last colony, independence and
black majority rule. That was Castro's price for agreeing to
withdraw Cuba's forces from Angola.
   Above all, he sees himself as the broker for the dispossessed. He
constantly expresses outrage about the injustice of a world in which
some countries enjoy boundless abundance while others starve _
120,000 children every three days, a Hiroshima and a Nagasaki every
72 hours, he claims.
   Castro is proud that the infant mortality rate in Cuba is
comparable to that in some of the most developed countries. One
reason Cuba has had difficulty developing economically is that so
much of the country's resources go toward meeting basic human needs
_ housing, schools and hospitals.
   The vast majority of Cuba's children have the opportunity to
develop their minds and bodies through Cuba's far-reaching
educational and sports programs.
   On a per capita basis, Cuba quite possibly produces more good
boxers, runners, swimmers and baseball players than any other
country.
   While more than a million Cubans have fled the island since 1959,
the revolution has rescued countless others, mostly peasants and
workers, from the social and economic oblivion they endured under
the previous system.
   Block-by-block ``defense committees'' are used to monitor the
politically suspect but they also have helped make Cuba's streets as
safe as any in the hemisphere. Castro also boasts that Cuba is drug
free.
   Castro has been at the helm in Cuba for well over half his adult
life and, at 62, he shows no sign of slowing down. If he does
falter, brother Raul, 57, has been tapped as the successor.
   But Fidel, as he is known to his countrymen, may well be around
for years to come. He has outlasted six American presidents. Next
month, Ronald Reagan will become the seventh.

<HEAD>Mazda Builds U.S. Designed Mini-van</HEAD>
<NOTE>With LaserPhoto and LaserGraphic</NOTE>
<NOTE>EDS: Subs 15th paragraph to CORRECT spelling to two-passenger.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By ANN M. JOB</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>For The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   About the time Chrysler was getting ready to introduce its
minivans for the 1984 model year, Mazda employees in California had
their own concept for a minivan on the drawing boards.
   The result, the 1989 Mazda MPV, debuted in November and marks a
milestone in the Japanese automaker's history. The MPV _ an
aerodynamic-shaped and smartly dressed package _ is the first Mazda
vehicle born of an initial design that originated in the United
States. In fact, the MPV (for multipurpose vehicle) is not sold
today in Japan, Mazda's home country.
   The vehicle, designed with American buyers in mind, is built in
Japan but sold only in the United States and Canada. Sales of about
40,000 are forecast through October 1989, including about 4,000
four-wheel-drive models due out beginning in March, said spokesman
Fred Aikins. For the following 12 months, steady sales of another
40,000 are expected, he added.
   Early results were heartening, with Mazda reporting more than 900
sold in the first three weeks the vehicles were out.
   ``We feel the (minivan) market is continuing to expand,'' Aikins
said. ``Our sales need to come from the additional buyers into the
market and from the domestics.''
   Besides Chrysler, Ford and General Motors also sell small vans,
though Chrysler outpaces all the competition in sales. The No. 3
U.S. automaker has sold more than 1 million of its Dodge Caravan and
Plymouth Voyager vans since the 1984 model year.
   Major Japanese automakers such as Toyota and Nissan also sell
minivans here, but Aikins said the Mazda MPV is different because it
is not as box-like as the competitors. In price, however, the MPV is
in the midst of all the others.
   Aikins said the base price for a two-passenger cargo van is
$10,989, with the lowest-priced five-passenger MPV wagon at $12,909.
The base price for a seven-passenger MPV with the standard
four-cylinder engine is $13,759.
   The test vehicle had a V6 engine and topped out at just over
$19,000. Those price ranges are comparable to the competition.
   The MPV has a side door that opens outward, like a regular car
door, rather than a sliding side door that is standard on other
vans. The MPV's side door, however, opens to a maximum 90 degrees _
greater than that on a car door.
   The design allows a slightly wider door opening on the vehicle
than on other small vans, Aikins noted. The swing-out door is
lighter and easier for children to manage than some sliding doors.
The MPV side door also features a bar that's easy to grab and use
when manuevering around in the back.
   In addition, swing-out doors have greater durability and are less
prone to rattles during driving, Aikins said.
   Another feature on the test MPV _ a seven-passenger model _ was a
three-passenger rear bench seat with a seatback that folded down so
the folded seat could be pushed upward and locked in place behind
the middle bench seat. It's an unusual-looking arrangement but
provides cargo space in back.
   On other vans, the rear seat can be unlocked from the floor and
removed, but the MPV rear seat can't be removed unless hand tools
are used first to unfasten it from the floor. That's a bit awkward
and time-consuming for someone who wants to get large, long items in
the van.
   But Aikins countered that buyers may not have to remove the MPV
rear seat seat at all. Mazda designed the rear seat bench and the
two-passenger middle seat with seatbacks that fold down backwards
for a somewhat uneven, but mostly flat, bed. Aikins suggested buyers
just load their long items on that bed.
   But I don't know that owners want long, dirty items _ such as
wood _ on their upholstery. Wouldn't owners rather put the items on
the floor as permitted in other vans? (The MPV's middle seat is
removable, however, with a flip of a couple latches, if you have
cargo that is not very long.)
   The MPV, like all vans, offered good visibility, because of its
higher riding profile. Still, it handled like a car, except for some
body sway around corners.
   The van is rear-drive, as opposed to the front-drive Chrysler
products, permitting towing capabilities of up to 4,300 pounds with
the optional MPV towing package. Despite the rear-drive
configuration, however, the MPV has a flat floor, save for the
slightly raised area under the rear bench seat where suspension coil
springs are located.
   Probably the most enjoyable part of the MPV was the optional
3-liter V6 engine which performed flawlessly. Teamed with a
four-speed automatic overdrive transmission, the engine was smooth
and peppy. It's the same powerplant that's in the Mazda 929.
   The standard engine for the MPV is a 2.6-liter four-cylinder
that's newly developed for the van, Aikins said.
   Another highlight of the MPV was the nicely appointed interior.
Upholstery is placed on the sides of the doors, providing soft
armrests, and carpeting is below on the sides of the doors, giving
the impression of a nicely integrated interior. There was even a
nifty pull-down two-cup holder on the side of the front passenger
seat.
   About the only complaint was that the dashboard featured a tiny
mapbox and a too-small glovebox. The van's interior was spacious,
and legroom was admirable in all three seating areas _ front, middle
and rear.
   It was relatively easy to move around inside, though obviously,
you must hunch over a bit.
   The sloping front dashboard design gave an airy feel. Fit and
finish was superb. The test vehicle had the optional, separate air
conditioner for rear-seat passengers _ another nice touch.
   Mazda says its target buyers are men, but company officials
expect women to be the primary drivers. That's explained by the fact
that 73 percent of the potential buyers are male, with 88 percent
married. The median age is 39, 60 percent are college graduates.
   The MPV is new, there are no trouble index reports from Consumer
Reports.

<HEAD>Pam Dawber Plays Wife of Stricken Football Coach</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The story of a football coach stricken in the
prime of life by Lou Gehrig's disease isn't exactly light-hearted
viewing, but Pam Dawber, who plays the coach's wife, found the movie
``happy.''
   ``It's really about the human spirit at its very best,'' she
said. ``I think he inspires so many people by overcoming his own
incredible trauma. It's a hopeful, happy movie.''
   It was soon after Dawber's CBS sitcom ``My Sister Sam'' was
finally dropped for good after bouncing around the schedule for two
seasons that she was offered the role as Lucy Wedemeyer in the
real-life movie ``Quiet Victory,'' which CBS will air Monday, the
day after Christmas.
   Mrs. Wedemeyer helps her husband, Charlie Wedemeyer (Michael
Nouri), continue his coaching career despite the disease that leaves
him unable to speak or move.
   Dawber had held off new projects until she got final word on ``My
Sister Sam,'' so the movie offer came as she was ready for something
new. The series was on-again, off-again on CBS until April.
   ``We all thought we were going back to work on the USA Network,''
she said. ``Tribune Entertainment was nearly ready to make 44 new
shows. Then it fell through. Too bad. It was a good show. But it was
the victim of network politics.
   ``They wanted our Monday night time slot for a new show, `Frank's
Place.' So they ended up killing two shows. `Frank's Place' never
should have been on at 8 o'clock. It was a more sophisticated show.''
   ``My Sister Sam'' was moved to Saturday night its second year,
but was soon taken off the air. It returned briefly in April as part
of CBS' ill-fated attempt to program sitcoms on Tuesday.
   April wasn't all bad for Dawber. She and husband Mark Harmon had
their son, Sean.
   For ``Quiet Victory,'' she packed up her new baby and spent
several weeks filming on Folly Beach, on one of the sea islands off
South Carolina. The Wedemeyers live in Los Gatos, which is south of
San Francisco, but it was too expensive to film there.
   ``So, we went to South Carolina, which has palm trees, old houses
and beaches,'' she said.
   Wedemeyer was 30 when he learned he had amyotrophic lateral
sclerosis, called Lou Gehrig's disease after the famous New York
Yankee first baseman who was also stricken. A former star
quarterback at Michigan State, Wedemeyer was coaching the Los Gatos
Wildcats and teaching mathematics. He was married to his high school
sweetheart, Lucy, a former cheerleader.
   He's a native of Hawaii, where he was known as ``Kalekauwila,''
God of Lightning. His brother is Herman Wedemeyer, another football
star, who played Detective Duke Lukela for eight years on ``Hawaii
Five-0.''
   ``Charlie is completely immobile,'' said Dawber. ``He can move
his lips. He has a portable breathing apparatus and a feeding tube
and sometimes gets around in a golf cart. Lucy reads his lips and
relays his coaching commands to the team. ...
   ``He's a regal, charismatic man. Lucy's kept him alive through
her attitude. They both have a wonderful sense of humor. She's a
terribly selfless woman. Lucy in a way is the cheerleader for Los
Gatos. The community has done so much for them and with them.''
   The movie was directed by Roy Campanella II, whose father played
for the Brooklyn Dodgers until an automobile accident left him an
invalid.
   Now that the movie is completed, Dawber, who gained fame as Robin
Williams' foil on ``Mork and Mindy,'' is ``shopping around'' for a
new comedy series.
   A sitcom offers ``the most reasonble schedule,'' she said. ``I
don't want my son dragged around while I do more movies. I want the
industry to know that I'm available.''
   Dawber, who has sung in many musicals, including ``Pirates of
Penzance'' on Broadway, planned to audition for the role of
Christine in the Los Angeles production of ``Phantom of the Opera.''
She said she would have to audition without benefit of having seen
the play, since she was unable to get tickets to the show in New
York.

<HEAD>Julia Louis-Dreyfus _ One-Woman Greek Chorus on `Day by Day</HEAD>
<NOTE>With LaserPhoto</NOTE>

   On NBC's ``Day by Day,'' Julia Louis-Dreyfus
is sort of a one-woman Greek chorus _ she brings the unglad tidings
to a couple of former yuppies who gave up the good life to run a
day-care center.
   Louis-Dreyfus plays Eileen Swift, a flamboyant stockbroker who's
a friend of Brian Harper (Doug Sheehan) and his wife, Kate (Linda
Kelsey). Brian had also been a stockbroker, and Kate a lawyer. They
quit their high-paying jobs to spend more time with their infant
daughter and teen-age son.
   ``Eileen's a spoilsport who reminds them of what they're
missing,'' Louis-Dreyfus said. ```She has great entrances and exits.
That broad can make a joke.
   ``I hope she's a sympathetic character,'' she said. ``My goal is
to make her sympathetic in spite of herself. She's so abrasive. I
hope the audience likes her, because she says things everyone wishes
they could say. You see a side of her _ I don't want to say
vulnerable _ a side of her that's warm.
   ``She's a former colleague of Brian's, but they were merely
friends. In this season, Eileen's moved next door so that she can
pop into the house more easily. No matter what she says, they remain
good friends. That's a sitcom for you. Of all the characters in the
show I'd say she's the most cartoon-like. She says terrible things,
but people don't pay that much attention. It's just Eileen and her
hijinks.''
   The Sunday night comedy joined the NBC lineup last spring, based
on executive producer Gary David Goldberg's real-life experiences
running a day-care center in Northern California. It also stars
Christopher Daniel Barnes as the Harpers' 15-year-old son, Ross, and
Courtney Thorne-Smith as Kristin, the center's beautiful young
assistant.
   Louis-Dreyfus, an alumnus of Chicago's Second City troupe and
NBC's ``Saturday Night Live,'' got to know Goldberg when she was in
a spinoff pilot of his ``Family Ties.'' The spinoff was never picked
up as a series.
   ``They were spinning off Scott Valentine's character of Nick,''
she said. ``I played a character who was similar to Eileen. She was
sarcastic but more intellectual than Eileen. I would never call
Eileen an intellectual.''
   She recently moved into a new home with her husband, writer-actor
Brad Hall. ``It 's a lovely little cottage with a fireplace,'' she
said. ``We're finally getting organized.''
   Louis-Dreyfus had roles in the movies ``Soul Man'' and ``Hannah
and Her Sisters.''
   ``I did `Hannah' right at NBC while I was doing `Saturday Night
Live,''' she said. ``I was in the beginning of the film when Woody
Allen's an executive producer of a television comedy show. I was his
assistant. I worked with him for about a week, which was fun. But
most of my part was cut out.
   ``This is such a different experience from `Saturday Night
Live,''' she said of the sitcom. ``On `Saturday Night' you go to
work on Monday morning and have to write your own material with the
writers. The hours were nuts. Here, you come to work, and they hand
you a script. Working on a sitcom is as close as you can get to
having a regular job without having a regular job.''
   She and her husband were both on ``Saturday Night Live,'' but
they had met earlier at Northwestern University in Chicago.
   ``Chicago's a great theater town. You don't make a lot of money,
but you don't make any money in theater anyway. Chicago's a much
easier place to work and live than New York.''
   Louis-Dreyfus was born in New York, but when her parents divorced
she divided her time between New York and Washington. ``I can
remember when the Eastern Shuttle was $18,'' she said.
   ``I grew up mostly in Washington and went to high school with a
lot of politicans' kids. My stepfather was a doctor. I did every
play I could get my hands on. I grew up trying to juggle my time
between theater and homework.''

   U.S. industry is using more of its capacity
than at any time in nine years, the government said in a report that
heightened concerns that the economy will overheat and inflation

84.0 percent in October.

was 3.1 percent smaller than September's deficit of $10.67 billion.
   The October deficit was the lowest since July's $9.47 billion.

<TEXT>
   The U.S. trade deficit dipped slightly in October and the
nation's factories ran at their highest rate in nine years in
November, the government says.
   Stocks and bonds fell Wednesday in reaction to the reports.
Investors feared they hinted at higher inflation in the months ahead
and possible moves by the nation's central bank to nudge up interest
rates.
   The merchandise trade deficit for October fell 3.1 percent to
$10.3 billion, the Commerce Department said. But investors decided
the improvement would not continue unless the dollar fell further to
make U.S. goods more competitive in world markets. That could
depress stocks and bonds.
   In the day's other big economic report, the Federal Reserve said
U.S. industry in November was using more of its capacity than at any
time in nine years.
   The operating rate at factories, mines and utilities was 84.2
percent last month, up from 84.0 percent in October and the highest
rate since November 1979. That raised speculation that factories
were running too close to full tilt, possibly leading to shortages
that would boost inflation.
   ``We're starting to approach levels of capacity utilization in
some industries that will mean higher prices. If growth continues at
this rate, we'll soon find most industries passing on higher prices
and we'll see monthly increases in the inflation numbers,'' said
David Berson, an economist with the Federal National Mortgage
Association.
   On Wall Street, the Dow Jones average of 30 industrials dropped
9.24 points to 2,134.25 on Wednesday as declining issues outnumbered
advances by about 6 to 5 in nationwide trading of New York Stock
Exchange-listed stocks.
   In the bond market, the Treasury's closely watched 30-year bond
lost } point, or about $7.50 for every $1,000 in face value. Its
yield, which moves inversely to its price and is often an indicator
of interest rate trends, climbed to 9.04 percent from 8.97 percent
late Tuesday.
   The dollar retreated against major currencies Wednesday, hurt by
what money dealers called rumors of a hike in West German interest
rates and a negative market reaction to the monthly U.S. trade
report.
   ``The figures came out in line with expectations, and since
there's overriding bearish sentiment to the dollar, people just
resumed selling it,'' said Stuart Yannalfo, a trader at the New York
commodities futures firm Refco Inc.
   In other economic news Wednesday:
   _The Commerce Department said business inventories in October
climbed at the slowest rate in five months, while sales surged a
strong 1.2 percent. The report suggested robust economic growth.
   _The Federal Reserve said its industrial production index in
November increased by 0.5 percent for the second month in a row.
   _Sales of U.S.-made cars and light trucks fell 11 percent in
early December compared with a burst of incentive-driven sales in
the same period a year earlier, domestic automakers reported.
   David Jones, an economist with Aubrey G. Lanston & Co., a
government securities trader in New York, said improvement in the
trade deficit will slow in the months ahead. He said capacity
strains will make it difficult to manufacture more exports, and
strong domestic demand will suck in more imports.

   Anticipation of colder weather in the Northeast
has pushed wholesale home heating oil prices sharply higher.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the January contract for
heating oil rose 1.86 cents Wednesday to settle at 51.13 cents a
gallon, after falling 0.93 cent on profit-taking Tuesday. Other
contract months were up more than a penny.
   Prices were higher Monday and Friday on the arrival of
sub-freezing temperatures in the Northeast. The weather remained
cold on Wednesday, and parts of the region were hit with snow.
   Andrew Lebow, a senior energy analyst with E.D.&F. Man
International Futures Inc, said Wednesday's ``heating oil market ...
was supported by anticipation of colder weather in the Northeast.''
   Among other refined petroleum products traded on the exchange
Wednesday, January unleaded gasoline, which fell 0.90 cent on
Tuesday, rose 0.42 cent to settle at 43.72 cents a gallon.
   The January contract for West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark
grade of U.S. crude oil, settled at $16.37 a barrel, up 37 cents
from Tuesday, when it fell 6 cents.
   Lebow said the markets also got a boost from reports that
non-OPEC oil producers Colombia and Norway would be willing to cut
production if the cartel sticks to an output-slashing pact ratified
last month.
   The 13-nation Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries
agreed to keep daily crude production at 18.5 million barrels to
help prop up sagging worldwide oil prices.
   ``Overall, the traders' sentiment seems to be changing. They're
more optimistic OPEC is going to cut production, and there's no sign
to lead to the contrary,'' said Lebow.

<HEAD>Fiber-Optic Cable Beneath Atlantic Goes Into Service</HEAD>
<HEAD>LaserGraphic</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER COY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Coded pulses of laser light have begun carrying
phone calls, video signals and computer data beneath the Atlantic
Ocean on the first fiber-optic cable connecting the United States
and Europe.
   The shark-proof cable that went into service Wednesday can carry
40,000 phone calls simultaneously, double the capacity of all its
trans-Atlantic copper-cable predecessors combined, even though it
measures less than an inch across.
   Isaac Asimov, the prolific author of science and science fiction,
spoke the first official words on the cable in a three-way video
conference connecting New York, London and Paris.
   ``Welcome, everybody, to this historic trans-Atlantic crossing _
this maiden voyage across the sea on a beam of light,'' Asimov said
at 10:30 a.m. EST in the first words spoken over the new cable
except for test messages.
   In a sign of the voracious demand for communications, the
partners in the $361 million project expect the new fiber-optic
cable to start running out of room by late in 1991. That's when a
new cable with even more capacity will go into service.
   Fiber-optic service to Japan and the Far East will start next
spring, and other undersea fiber links will reach to the Caribbean
and the Mediterranean by the early 1990s.
   For residential customers, the new cable, TAT-8, will mean a
continued decline in the price of calls trans-Atlantic calls. For
businesses, it will mean lower rates and more capacity for the huge
volume of computer data they transmit, especially in the areas of
finance, travel and tourism.
   Ordinary television broadcasts still will be carried by satellite
because they would take up too much room on the cable. But the
cable's builders expect the cable to be used for video conferences
between offices, with the signals compressed to take up less room.
   Lasers have revolutionized phone networks by making it possible
to transmit information in the form of rapid pulses of laser light
through hair-thin strands of glass known as optical fibers. The
lasers transmit information in digital form, that is, coded into a
series of ones and zeros.
   Most long-distance calls within the United States already are
carried on optical fibers.
   The new cable contains six strands of glass, and two of them are
spares. The cable measures 0.8 inch across, except for the sections
that are reinforced against shark bites, which are 1.3 inches across.
   The first undersea phone cable between the United States and
Europe, TAT-1, was built in 1956 and could handle 36 simultaneous
calls. During its entire 22-year lifetime it handled 10 million
calls. TAT-8 (the TAT rhymes with `cat') can handle that many calls
in less than two days.
   American Telephone & Telegraph Co. owns 34.1 percent of TAT-8,
British Telecom owns 15.5 percent and France Telecom owns 9.8
percent. All three of those companies sent cable-laying ships to
share in the effort. The rest of TAT-8 is owned by 27 other
telecommunications administrations and companies.
   In spite of the huge capacity of fiber-optic cables, AT&T said
there is still a role for satellites, and it recently signed a
contract with Communications Satellite Corp. expanding its use of
satellites. A Comsat spokesman, Richard McGraw, said other companies
such as MCI Communications Corp. and US Sprint Communications Co.
also had signed long-term contracts for satellite usage.
   The cable touches ground in North America at Tuckerton, N.J.; in
the United Kingdom at Widemouth in North Cornwall; and in France at
Penmarch in Brittany. It is buried a yard beneath the ocean floor to
a depth of about 3,000 feet so it will not be snagged by fishing
vessels. It is clad in steel to a depth of 8,500 feet to protect
against shark bites.
   AT&T said 1988 would be the first year the company handled more
than 1 billion calls into and out of the United States.

   Here are sales results for the seven major U.S.
automakers for Dec. 1-10, 1988.
   Percentage changes in sales are based on average daily sales
during each period rather than comparisons of straight totals. There
were nine selling days in the period this year and nine selling days
last year. For the year to date there were 291 selling days,
compared with 290 selling days in the corresponding period a year
earlier.
   Cars and trucks made in the United States by Honda, Nissan,
Toyota and Mazda are counted as domestic and appear in this table.
Mazda began making cars at its Flat Rock, Mich., plant in October
1987.
   Cars and trucks imported for sale under the GM, Ford and Chrysler
names are counted as foreign. Sales of imported cars and trucks are
reported at the end of each month.

<HEAD>Fall in Early December Sales Not Seen as Worry</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By FREDERICK STANDISH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An 11 percent drop in sales of U.S.-made cars and
light trucks in early December isn't seen as worrisome in an
industry flirting with the second-best calendar year in history.
   Companies making cars and light trucks in the United States on
Wednesday reported they sold an average of 29,610 vehicles during
the nine selling days in the Dec. 1-10 period this year. That
compared with an average of 33,251 vehicles sold during the same
time last year, when there also were nine selling days.
   The automakers reported that car sales dropped 10.5 percent and
light truck sales were down 11.7 percent in early December of this
year compared with last year.
   But no one was predicting that the numbers pointed to an industry
in a slump. Incentives began to work their way back into car deals
during early December last year after a brief hiatus as the 1988
model year started.
   ``They (automakers) started putting on some heavy-duty
incentives'' in early December last year, said analyst Kathleen
Heaney of Nikko Securities Co. International Inc. ``You've got a
tough time to compare it with.''
   Mary Ann Sudol of Fitch Investors agreed.
   ``That's hard to read,'' she said. ``It's not surprising that
they're down a little bit, given that December is bad for auto sales
anyway.
   ``In any (recent) 10-day period, you've had so much noise in the
period that it's hard to make a comparison. That noise is
incentives.''
   As the year draws to a close, the companies are looking forward
to what could be the second-best sales year in history, behind the
16.3 million vehicles sold in 1986.
   For the year, car and light truck sales in the United States have
risen 6.9 percent in 1988 over 1987, going to a daily rate of 37,949
this year compared with 35,499 last year.
   Among the Big Three U.S. automakers, General Motors Corp. showed
the largest early-December decline in car sales, falling 12.9
percent to a daily rate of 8,906 cars in 1988 from 10,226 last year.
GM's car sales were up 0.9 percent in 1988 over 1987 to a daily rate
of 11,776 this year, compared with 11,668 last year.
   Ford Motor Co.'s sales in early December fell 11.6 percent to a
daily rate of 5,582 this year, compared with 6,316 in the same
period last year. But for the year, Ford's car sales have climbed
7.7 percent to an average daily rate of 7,121 in 1988 compared with
6,612 in 1987.
   Chrysler Corp. said it sold cars at a daily rate of 2,673 in
early December this year compared with 2,979 during the same period
last year, a 10.3 percent decline. So far this year, Chrysler has
sold 10.3 percent more cars, with a daily sales rate of 3,451 in
1988 compared with 3,130 last year.

   A management-led group buying out
Hospital Corp. of America plans to sell some assets of the nation's
largest hospital management company to help finance the $3.6 billion
acquisition.
   ``In order to meet its debt obligations, which include the
repayment of a $1.3 billion asset sale bridge loan within two years
of the merger, HCA will be required to sell certain of its assets
and businesses,'' company officials said Wednesday in a statement.
   ``HCA is currently reviewing each of its affiliated businesses
for possible disposition. However, no decision has been made with
respect to which assets or businesses will be sold and no such
decisions are currently anticipated to be made prior to the
merger,'' the statement said.
   A management group led by HCA Chairman Thomas F. Frist Jr. has
obtained commitments for more than $4 billion in debt and $300
million in equity to finance the buyout.
   The management group, TF Investments Inc., submitted the only
buyout proposal by a Nov. 18 deadline set by HCA's board of
directors. The company's board approved the buyout Nov. 22.
   ``They're still reviewing assets and businesses, and they're not
going to make any decision until the merger is completed,'' HCA
spokesman David McFadden said.
   ``We're looking to get the proxy cleared by the (Securities and
Exchange Commission) in mid-January. We're still planning to hold
the shareholder meeting in February, what time we really don't
know.''
   McFadden said HCA officials expect shareholders to approve the
buyout.
   HCA has filed preliminary proxy materials relating to the sale
with the SEC.
   Co-arrangers for the bank financing are Morgan Guaranty Trust Co.
of New York and Chase Manhattan Bank.
   Additional loan commitments have been obtained from Continental
Illinois National Bank and Trust Co. of Chicago, General Electric
Capital Corp., Industrial Bank of Japan Ltd., Toronto-Dominion Bank
and Deutsche Bank of West Germany.
   HCA officials said $2.362 billion of the $4.012 billion in bank
financing will be in an 8-year loan. About $1.3 billion will come
from the bridge facility that will mature two years after the sale
is completed.
   About $280 million is expected to come from an anticipated $350
million revolving credit facility, officials said.
   Equity commitments have been obtained from Frist, HCA management
and Texas-based investor Richard Rainwater for $125 million, the HCA
stock bonus retirement plan for $75 million and $100 million from
``affiliates of certain of the lenders,'' the statement said.

<HEAD>Trump May Try To Get Control Of Caesars World</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOYCE A. VENEZIA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The price of Caesars World Inc. stock
rose just hours after the company announced that developer Donald
Trump had invested in the gaming company.
   At the close of the day Wednesday on Wall Street, Caesars World
stock had jumped $4.12{ a share to $29.37{ in consolidated New York
Stock Exchange trading.
   The activity led at least one gaming analyst to credit Trump with
being a shrewd investor.
   ``I take my hat off to Donald Trump,'' said Marvin Roffman of the
Philadelphia investment firm Janney Montgomery Scott Inc. ``It was a
wise investment to buy into Caesars. ... We've always felt Caesars
was one of the best-managed companies in the industry, and we felt
it was worth up to $40 a share.''
   Trump has asked the federal government for a ruling on whether
his investment would violate antitrust laws. He filed notice with
the Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission of his
desire to possibly buy more than 50 percent of Caesars World common
stock.
   Although neither Trump nor Caesars World will say how much Trump
already owns, the filing was made under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act,
which requires companies or individuals to seek such a ruling once
they have acquired at least $15 million worth of stock in a company.
   Caesars World officials refused comment on Trump's notice, ``due
to the confusing content of this notice,'' according to a statement.
Trump also refused to comment Wednesday.
   ``Such filings are very confidential and he's been advised not to
comment,'' said Susan Heilbron, a spokeswoman for Trump.
   Caesars World owns three gaming halls: Caesars Hotel Casino in
Atlantic City, and Caesars Palace and Caesars Tahoe in Nevada.
   In the notice, Trump said he ``has the good-faith intention,
subject to price, availability and necessary approvals, if any, to
acquire such number of shares ... to hold in excess of 15 percent of
the outstanding voting securities'' of Caesars World.
   Roffman said, however, that Trump would not be successful in a
hostile takeover of Caesars World. In a similar situation last year
involving investor Martin Sosnoff, New Jersey gaming regulators
blocked Sosnoff's highly leveraged takeover proposal.
   In a similar situation involving Trump, New Jersey's Casino
Control Commission would probably also reject a highly leveraged
deal, Roffman suggested.
   ``Donald Trump's style is not cash, it's to borrow,'' the analyst
said. ``He has (accumulated) a debt of $1.235 billion outstanding on
his three Atlantic City properties.''
   Under New Jersey law, Trump can own only three gaming halls in
the state. So far, he is licensed for two _ Trump Plaza and Trump
Castle casino hotels. A third, the massive Taj Mahal, is under
construction and expected to be completed in 1990.
   ``I think he'll sell one anyway in the future, because it doesn't
make sense to market three in Atlantic City,'' Roffman said. ``But
the bottom line with this Caesars notice is that Donald Trump is
interested in making money, not owning another casino. He simply
bought into an undervalued situation and will come out with a
profit.''
   This is not the first time that Trump has invested in a rival
casino company.
   He made a $30 million profit from investing in Holiday Corp.
stock and a $24 million profit on Bally Manufacturing Corp. stock.
He also bought a small amount of stock in Golden Nugget Corp., a
move that his competitor, Golden Nugget Chairman Steve Wynn, called
a ``publicity stunt.''

   The dollar moved slightly higher in thin European
trading late this morning as the market waited for a widely expected
increase in a key West German interest rate in the wake of a round
of interest rate increases elsewhere in Europe.
   Gold prices also rose.
   Traders said an increase in the West German Lombard rate is
likely to be matched by a rise in the U.S. Federal Reserve's
discount rate.
   The Lombard rate is what the West German central bank charges
commercial banks for supplemental borrowings in which securities are
used as collateral.
   The discount rate is what the U.S. central bank charges on loans
to commercial banks.
   There were interest rate hikes in the Netherlands, Belgium and
France on Wednesday.
   In London, the British pound fell to $1.8312, compared with
$1.8335 Wednesday.
   Other dollar rates at mid-morning, compared with late Wednesday's
rates, included: 1.7362 West German marks, down from 1.7365; 1.4638
Swiss francs, up from 1.4630; 5.9365 French francs, up from 5.9350;
1.9593 Dutch guilders, up from 1.9590; 1,286.00 Italian lire, up
from 1,279.50; 1.2005 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1986.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day begins,
the dollar fell 0.38 yen to a closing 122.97 yen. Later, in London,
it was quoted at 122.85 yen.
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $421.40 a troy ounce, up
from $420.75 bid late Wednesday. At midmorning today, the city's
five major bullion dealers fixed a recommended price also of $421.40.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $421.25, up from $420 bid late
Wednesday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold rose $1.67 to close at a bid $423.05.
   Silver was quoted in London today at a bid price of $6.21 a troy
ounce, up from Wednesday's $6.16.

   Fallen whiz kid Barry Minkow listened grimly
as a jury announced ``guilty'' 57 times on fraud charges in a $25
million swindle that snared Wall Street brokerages, major banks and
small investors.
   The 22-year-old defendant, who launched his ZZZZ Best carpet
cleaning business in his parents' garage at age 16, had been trying
to make a plea bargain only hours before the U.S. District Court
jury convicted him on all counts of securities, credit card and mail
fraud charges.
   The jury rejected Minkow's claim that he was a frightened young
boy forced by mobsters into a life of crime, and accepted the
prosecution's portrayal of him as a shrewd young con man with a
thirst for money, power and fame.
   Minkow could be sentenced to up to 300 years in prison. Judge
Dickran Tevrizian set sentencing for Feb. 21.
   Minkow's attorney, David Kenner, said he would appeal the
conviction, noting that Tevrizian severely limited evidence on
Minkow's claims of mob pressure.
   The jury was to resume deliberations today on five charges
against Minkow's co-defendant, accountant Norman Rothberg, who is
accused of taking a bribe to cover up ZZZZ Best's frauds.
   Minkow, sensing he would be convicted, had agreed to plead guilty
to about 15 percent of the charges, Kenner said outside court
Wednesday.
   But Assistant U.S. Attorney James Asperger said no final
agreement was reached.
   The jury, which reached its verdict after five days of
deliberations, made such discussions moot.
   It took 40 minutes to read the decision. Minkow fidgeted
occasionally, and reached over once to clasp Kenner's hand.
   The attorney said Minkow was remorseful and regretted what had
happened.
   ``I think he's learned lessons from this,'' Kenner said. ``Barry
never wanted anything more than to build ZZZZ Best into the General
Motors of carpet cleaning .... He clearly was involved with a
company that was infiltrated by organized crime.''
   ``I was just a front man for the mob,'' Minkow had insisted on
the witness stand. ``I was just a puppet.''
   The youthful defendant told of constant beatings and threats from
mobsters, loan sharks and thugs, but there was little corroborating
evidence.
   ``A duress defense is difficult to establish because threats by
their very nature are communicated privately,'' Kenner said.
   In two weeks on the stand during the four-month trial, Minkow
admitted defrauding numerous investors as well as talk show hosts
who hailed him as a teen-age genius of the finance world.
   He admitted making romantic overtures to a woman banker to obtain
her approval on a loan; she testified that she lost her job because
of him. He told of bouncing checks, issuing false credit card
charges and arranging investor tours of restoration projects that
didn't exist.
   Dozens of victims who lost money in Minkow's frauds testified.
   After starting his business, Minkow had claimed ZZZZ Best was
making a fortune restoring fire- and water-damaged buildings when no
such jobs were done.
   ``He sold investors on a business that for the most part did not
exist,'' Asperger told jurors.
   Soon, he was a familiar face in TV advertisements and on talk
shows. He wrote a book about his success and took Wall Street by
storm when ZZZZ Best went public in 1986.
   But the company quickly collapsed in scandal. Minkow claimed its
demise was caused by mobsters, including the late Jack Catain, who
turned the business into a swindle.
   ``Barry has expressed to me the remorse he has for having been in
that situation and his desire to become a meaningful member of
society,'' Kenner told reporters.
   ``Barry is a young man,'' said Kenner. ``I would hope Barry would
still be a young man when he is released.''

<DATELINE>SYDNEY, Australia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Larry Adler, a Hungarian refugee from
World War II who arrived in Australia penniless and became one of
its leading business tycoons, has died at age 57 of complications
following a heart attack.
   Adler, who died Tuesday, was chairman and chief executive of FAI
Insurances Ltd., one of Australia's largest companies. The cause of
death was not given other than that it was related to a Dec. 2 heart
attack.
   Known as a shrewd and sometimes ruthless workaholic, Adler once
described work as something to ``play at.''
   ``I work golf, I work tennis, but I play work,'' he told a
newspaper interviewer three years ago. ``I absolutely love it and if
another heart attack is the price I have to pay to keep going at
this pace, then I'll pay it gladly.''
   Adler claimed that money itself was not the prime motive for his
constant striving.
   ``Sure, it's important when you haven't got it. But once you have
it, it is merely a barometer of how well you are doing,'' he said.
``Money is the only applause a businessman gets for his
performance.''
   Arriving in the country in 1949, Adler worked as a gas station
attendant, record-shop owner and taxi driver before forming Fire &
All Risks Insurance in 1960 with $56,000 cash.
   FAI is a $2 billion-a-year business, and is listed on exchanges
in New York, Toronto, Switzerland, New Zealand, London, Hong Kong
and Singapore.
   Laszlo J. Adler was born Nov. 2, 1931, in Budapest, Hungary, of
Jewish parents. His father, who had run a large profitable insurance
company, died in a Nazi death camp when the country was invaded in
1944. He changed his name to Larry upon settling in Australia.
   New South Wales state Premier Nick Greiner called Adler one of
Australia's great entrepreneurs. ``He built up, by his own drive and
hard work and native wit, a huge business in a very competitive
area.''
   Adler is survived by his wife Ethel and three children.
   His son Rodney, 29, a director of FAI, today was named chief
executive of the company. The family has a 41 percent controlling
interest in FAI.

   The U.S. dollar declined today against the Japanese
yen on investors' fears of possible interest rate hikes abroad,
while stock prices also fell.
   Trading in both markets was relatively quiet following
Wednesday's report by the U.S. Commerce Department that showed the
U.S. trade deficit had dropped only 3.1 percent in October from the
previous month to $10.35 billion.
   ``The trade figures didn't provide any clear direction for the
dollar, and dealers, anticipating possible rate hikes in West
Germany and the United States, aren't taking any large positions,''
said Kaneo Ogino, a dealer at Goldman, Sachs in Tokyo.
   The dollar closed at 122.97 yen, down 0.38 yen from Wednesday's
close.
   A moderate sell-off pushed the dollar down to 122.88 yen at the
opening, but it drifted higher on buying by investment trusts, Ogino
said. It ranged between 122.85 yen and 123.05 yen.
   ``The market held a sense of disappointment over the slowed pace
of improvement in the U.S. trade deficit in recent months, though
the latest figures were within expectations,'' said a dealer at the
Bank of Tokyo who spoke anonymously.
   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the Nikkei Stock Average of 225
selected issues, a 156.92-point gainer Wednesday, fell 48.98 points,
or 0.16 percent, closing at 29,705.75.
   Investors, finding no incentives for either buying or selling,
remained mostly on the sidelines because of worry over rising
interest rates, traders said.
   Many investors in both markets are also reluctant to take any new
positions as the end of the year approaches, analysts said.
   ``It's a case of the end-of-the-year blues,'' said Casey
Flaherty, a trader at Yamaichi Securities Co.
   Flaherty said the market lacked new speculative themes.
   ``Until we get something new, there isn't likely to be much going
on this year,'' he said.

   Unemployment in Britain fell to a seasonally
adjusted 7.5 percent of the workforce in November, the lowest level
since March 1981, the government said Thursday.
   The November figure was down from 7.7 percent in October and
substantially lower than the 9.2 percent rate in November 1987, the
Department of Employment said.
   Seasonally adjusted unemployment was estimated at 2.11 million
people, down from a revised 2.16 million people in October and 2.6
million people in November 1987.
   The department said the decline in the number of jobless of
49,300 was consistent with the average 40,000-a-month fall since the
beginning of 1988.

<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Conrail has named Richard D. Sanborn to
succeed retiring L. Stanley Crane as chairman and chief executive
officer.
   Sanborn, 52, came to Conrail in March 1988, as president and
chief operating officer, titles he will retain, and board member.
The company announced then that he would replace Crane.
   Crane, 73, became chairman and CEO of the freight railroad in
1981 and presided over the company as it went from a federal
government-owned money loser to a profitable, publicly held
corporation in March 1987.
   In October, Conrail reported third-quarter profit of $83 million,
up from $62 million for the same period in 1987. In the first nine
months of the year, Conrail had net income of $228 million, up from
$220 million in the same year-ago period.
   Sanborn, of Baltimore, came to Conrail from CSX Distribution
Services Inc., where he was president and CEO. CSX Distribution is a
division of CSX Corp., another big Eastern railroad.
   In a recent employee publication, he identified Conrail's major
challenges as the need to be more responsive to customers and to
compete more effectively to haul commodities that now move mainly by
truck.
   Among the key decisions Sanborn may face early next year is
whether or not to build a new headquarters. Conrail now has offices
in three downtown Philadelphia buildings.
   His appointment is effective Jan. 1.

<HEAD>Share Prices Higher on Slower Growth in British Earnings</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Share prices were higher on the London stock
exchange at midday Thursday, helped by news that the growth in
British average earnings slowed in October.
   The news helped ease fears of overheating in the British economy,
dealers said. The British government has pushed up interest rates
sharply in recent months to help quell inflationary pressures.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index was up 6.5
points, or 0.37 percent, at 1762.6 at about 12:30 p.m.
   The index opened 6.6 points down on nervousness ahead of the
release of the earnings figures and amid worries about upward
pressures on interest rates worldwide. The figures showed the
underlying annual rate of increase in average earnings fell to 9
percent in October from 9.25 percent in September and August.
   Volume was light as 228.7 million shares changed hands by midday,
compared with 263.6 million shares at the same time on Wednesday.
   Oil shares continued to dominate trading, as the market remained
convinced that London and Scottish Marine Oil had completed the
long-awaited sale of its 25.2 percent stake in Enterprise Oil. This
rumor swept the market late Wednesday and continued to make the
rounds Thursday.
   Dealers said both companies' share prices rose on relief the deal
might have finally been completed. Lasmo shares were up 11 pence at
474 pence, after peaking at 481, while Enterprise shares gained 18
to 534, having been as high as 537.
   Also in the oil sector, news late Wednesday that British
Petroleum Co. was talking exclusively with RTZ Corp. about selling
most of its minerals business gave a sharp boost to turnover,
especially in BP shares.
   BP shares, which had risen strongly on rumors ahead of official
confirmation of the possible sale, were down 1 at 258. RTZ also
reversed its recent course and rose 7 to 400. One dealer said price
changes were a correction to the previous moves. But another dealer
said the transaction, which would include the sale of BP's gold
operations, could prove a better deal for RTZ than for BP.

<DATELINE>STRASBOURG, France (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The president of the European
Parliament, Lord Plumb, Thursday signed the EEC's $52.8 billion 1989
budget into law.
   It was the first time since 1983, and only the second since 1979,
that the budget was signed before the fiscal year begins on Jan.1.
   The 1988 budget was only signed in June this year.
   The European Economic Community's 1989 budget amounts to 44.83
billion European currency units, or the equivalent of $52.8 billion,
with farm spending set at 26.7 billion Ecus _ $31.5 billion _ or 56
percent of the total budget.
   It was the first time agriculture payments were kept to under 60
percent of the budget since the European Economic Community was
founded 31 years ago.
   This was the result of a deal hammered out by the 12 EEC leaders
in Brussels in February to strictly control farm payments.
   The 1989 budget cut agriculture spending by 1.3 billion Ecus, or
$1.5 billion, because of higher-than-forecast world cereal prices
and a cheaper U.S. dollar.

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A leading Japanese research institute Thursday
predicted Japan's economy will grow 4.4 percent in the fiscal year
beginning April 1.
   The Nikko Research Center, affiliated with Nikko Securities Co.,
echoed projections issued by other leading economic think tanks over
the last two weeks.
   Like other researchers, Nikko said the bullish 4.4 percent growth
after accounting for inflation would be led by strong capital
investments and personal spending. Producer prices, on the other
hand, are expected to rise by a modest 0.5 percent, while consumer
prices are expected to rise by 1.0 percent.
   The forecast is based on assumptions that the official discount
rate will remain unchanged at a postwar low of 2.5 percent, an
exchange rate of 120 yen to the dollar and crude oil prices at
$14.50 per barrel.

   Japan Air Lines said Thursday it would consider
retaliation against United Airlines if the U.S. government bans
sales of JAL tickets through computerized reservation and ticketing
systems in the United States.
   ``We deeply regret the sudden decision by the United States
neglecting our previous agreements and unilaterally applying
political pressure to settle this matter,'' the company said in a
statement.
   The U.S. Department of Transportation has accused JAL of
violating the fair competition rules of the International Air
Transport Association and called for discussions on whether
sanctions should be imposed, Kyodo News Service reported from New
York.
   The U.S. Embassy in Tokyo said Thursday it had no details of the
decision.
   The dispute surfaced last summer when JAL refused to allow United
Airlines' ticketing system to sell JAL tickets in Japan. JAL said it
is not allowed to sell United's tickets in the United States and
thus has the right to refuse sales of JAL tickets by United in Japan.
   If U.S. sanctions are adopted against JAL, the Japanese airline's
statement said, it would appeal to U.S. courts. If the sanctions are
allowed to stand, it added, ``We will consider the possibility of
retaliation against United Airlines.''
   The statement said: ``We believe we reserve the right to choose
which ticketing system to use based on our commercial judgment and
thus such a matter should not be settled on a political and
administrative basis.''
   United's Tokyo office declined to comment on the matter while
legal proceedings are under way.

<HEAD>Stores Sue State Over Dec. 26 Hours</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Five retail stores have sued the State of
Massachusetts for the right of all stores to open during normal
business hours on Dec. 26 without having to get local permits.
   The stores are challenging state Commissioner of Labor and
Industries James Snow's interpretation of a new state law on store
openings the days after Christmas and New Year's. The holidays fall
on Sundays this year.
   Snow ruled that Sunday hours will apply on Monday, Dec. 26. That
means the stores cannot open before noon unless they get permission
from their local police chiefs, and the permits must be confirmed by
the state.
   Snow already has said the state will confirm all local permits,
but many local police chiefs have refused to grant them.
   The suit was filed Wednesday in Suffolk Superior Court by
Filene's, Filene's Basement, Lord & Taylor, Caldor and Lechmere.
   Permits to open before noon have been granted by police chiefs in
Auburn, Boston, Danvers, Hanover, Newton, Peabody, Westborough,
Westfield and Worcester.
   Permits have been denied by chiefs in Belmont, Braintree,
Brockton, Burlington, Cambridge, Dedham, Framingham, Hyannis,
Natick, Springfield and Wellesley.
   ``The retailers reluctantly decided to take this action primarily
for customer-service reasons,'' said Boston lawyer Dawn-Marie
Driscoll.
   ``On the day after Christmas, customers appear early to make
exchanges, to use gift certificates and to take advantage of
after-Christmas sales.
   ``Retailers would lose a lot of customer goodwill by being open
in some locations and being closed in others.''
   Under state law, when some holidays, including Christmas, occur
on Sundays, they are observed on the following Mondays.
   A change in the law passed last month, and agreed to by a
coalition of retailers and unions, allows retailers to open Jan. 1
and Jan. 2, and Dec. 26, but not Dec. 25.
   But the wording of the change is open to interpretation.
Retailers and some legislators said they thought it meant stores
could be open during usual weekday hours. Other said they thought it
meant Sunday hours would apply.

<TEXT>
   Hospital Corp. of America officials say
they have not decided what assets they will sell to help finance the
$3.6 billion management-led buyout of the nation's largest health
care company.
   ``They're still reviewing assets and businesses, and they're not
going to make any decision until the merger is completed,'' HCA
spokesman David McFadden said Wednesday.
   HCA officials released a statement Wednesday outlining how TF
Investments Inc., a group of top managers led by HCA Chairman Thomas
F. Frist Jr. and third-party investors, plans to buy out the health
care giant.
   ``In order to meet its debt obligations, which include the
repayment of a $1.3 billion asset sale bridge loan within two years
of the merger, HCA will be required to sell certain of its assets
and businesses,'' company officials said in the statement.
   The statement said HCA currently is reviewing each of its
affiliated businesses for possible disposition.
   TF Investments has obtained commitments for more than $4 billion
in debt and $300 million in equity to finance the buyout, the
company said. TF Investments submitted the only buyout proposal by a
Nov. 18 deadline set by HCA's board of directors. The company's
board approved the buyout Nov. 22 and shareholders are expected to
ratify the decision at a February shareholders meeting.
   HCA has filed preliminary proxy materials relating to the sale
with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the statement said.
   Officials said $2.362 billion of the $4.012 billion in bank
financing will be in an eight-year loan. About $1.3 billion will
come from the bridge facility that will mature two years after the
sale is completed.
   About $280 million is expected to come from an anticipated $350
million revolving credit facility, officials said.

<HEAD>EEC Orders Deregulation Of Telecommunications Services</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The European Economic Community Thursday
ordered EEC member states to deregulate by 1991 the
telecommunications services industry in a move that is likely to
meet national opposition.
   The decision was taken by the executive European Commission
unilaterally under the EEC founding treaty which allows it to impose
legislation to stop public monopolies distorting competition.
   A similar move earlier this year to break national
telecommunications authorities' monopolies in the consumer equipment
market is being challenged in the European Court of Justice by
France, supported by West Germany, Italy and Belgium.
   The latest order would open up to private competition services
such as data transmission, leased lines, electronic mail and
financial data networks in stages by January 1991.
   The Commission said in a statement that national
telecommunications monopolies in certain countries restricted
clients' use of infrastructure and charged ``disproportionate''
prices for services in relation to cost. These measures limited the
supply of telecommunications services, it said.
   It said that telecommunications services were growing fast and
predicted that data transmission services would grow by 15 to 25
percent a year once the market was deregulated.
   The value of the telecommunications services market in the EEC is
estimated at about 64 billion European currency units, or $75.5
billion.
   The Commission will not put its order into effect immediately. It
will consult with the member states on the terms of the legislation
before giving the final go-ahead in March.
   The Commission also proposed draft EEC legislation to set common
conditions for open access by private operators to public
telecommunications networks.

   Still, analysts said, it gave investors another reason to take a

   Leaders of the flight attendants union at
Continental Airlines say they don't anticipate a strike against the
airline over wages even though the membership has authorized a
walkout if necessary.
   Negotiations with the Houston-based Continental will resume in
January, Carla Winkler, president of Local 1 of the Union of Flight
Attendants, said at a news conference Wednesday.
   ``We have made a decision that we are not calling a work stoppage
and are going to do everything we can to talk to Continental and to
try to develop a good rapport with them,'' she said.
   The union represents about 5,600 attendants, with 60 to 70
percent of them dues-paying union members, Ms. Winkler said. They
have been working without a contract for five years, she added.
   Union leaders said of the some 4,400 attendants who voted, 80
percent of them gave the union's board the authority to call a
strike if necessary.
   Continental spokesman Art Kent said the company had not expected
the attendants to agree to a strike.
   ``We're obviously pleased that nothing is going to happen to
impact public travel, especially during the traveling season,'' Kent
said.
   Ms. Winkler said Continental flight attendants are paid $11,000
to $15,000 annually, levels 30 to 35 percent below their
counterparts at other airlines.
   The union is seeking a three-year deal that would boost the lower
end of a salary scale by 5 percent and the upper end of the scale by
up to 35 percent, she said.
   Continental, she said, is offering an increase of about $1 an
hour. But Kent said the airline had made a wage and benefits package
proposal it is prepared to implement Jan. 1 that includes raises of
up to $4.25 per hour. He added, however, that the company will
continue talks with the flight attendants.

   Farley Inc. today extended for the fourth time its
$1.4 billion unsolicited takeover bid for Georgia-based textiles
giant West Point-Pepperell Inc.
   The $48-per-share cash tender offer, which was to have expired at
12:01 a.m. EST today, will run for another week, expiring at 12:01
a.m. next Thursday, Farley said in a statement.
   Farley, the Chicago-based maker of Fruit of the Loom underwear,
Acme boots and several other apparel brands, said about 13.6 million
shares of West Point-Pepperell had been tendered by shareholders.
Those shares, along with the Pepperell shares held by Farley,
represent more than 50 percent of Pepperell's outstanding common
stock, Farley has said.
   Farley's offer is contingent on getting Pepperell's ``poison
pill'' takeover defense overturned, either in court or by a vote of
Pepperell shareholders. Farley has asked Pepperell to call a special
shareholder meeting to consider its takeover bid.
   Pepperell, based in West Point, Ga., is the country's largest
publicly held textile manufacturer. It's brands include Gold Toe
socks, Arrow shirts and Martex towels.
   In an unrelated matter, the Federal Trade Commission granted
final approval for the acquisition by West Point Pepperell of J.P.
Stevens & Co. Inc., but the FTC also ruled that the Hannah Pickett
Sheet Mill in Rockingham, N.C., would have to be sold in the next
nine months.
   The commission's order does not require the divestiture of any
brand names or licensing arrangements, West Point said.
   Hannah Pickett represents less than 8 percent of the sheet-making
capacity of the total company.

   The department will propose new air pollution regulations in four
to six weeks which will tighten current standards, said Tom DeRocco,
spokesman for the department's Minerals Management Service.
   However, DeRocco said he could give no details of the forthcoming
proposed regulations.
   The state's 1981 lawsuit charged that pollution from drilling
rigs in federal waters off southern California made it impossible
for onshore communities to meet federal clean air regulations.
   Negotiators held their last meeting in California on Wednesday.
DeRocco said the department had been optimistic that an agreement
would result: ``We thought we were going to have something to share
with you,'' he said, but no agreement resulted.
   He said he did not know what the principal points of disagreement
were. Interior officials involved in the negotiations were to meet
in Denver with Secretary Donald P. Hodel to discuss the breakdown.
   Hodel and Gov. George Deukmejian agreed in November 1985 to try
to settle the lawsuit under the auspices of the Mediation Institute.
Other major parties were the Coalition for Clean Air and the
Citizens for a Better Environment, supporting the state's position
in the lawsuit, and the Western Oil and Gas Association, supporting
the department.
   By agreement with the state, Interior has required winning
bidders in Southern California lease offerings to install
pollution-control equipment generally similar to that required for
land-based production.

<HEAD>Court Dismisses Libel Verdict Against Newspaper</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN DOWLING</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SPRINGFIELD, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Illinois Supreme Court today threw
out a $200,000 libel verdict stemming from a 1980 editorial in the
Belleville (Ill.) News-Democrat that said a county board chairman
lied about his stand on a tax increase.
   Without written dissent, the justices said the editorial
attacking then-St. Clair County Board Chairman Jerry Costello was
false and libelous, but that Costello's lawyer didn't prove the
newspaper's editors had reason to believe it was false when they
published it.
   As a result, the high court said, Costello failed to meet the
``actual malice'' test for libel claims by public officials _ that
the statement was made with the knowledge that it was false or a
``reckless disregard'' for the truth.
   ``Failure to investigate does not itself establish actual malice
if the (editors) did not seriously doubt the truth of their
assertions,'' Justice Daniel Ward wrote in the court's opinion.
   Costello, who was elected this fall to the U.S. House of
Representatives, filed the lawsuit against Capital Cities
Communications, Inc., owner of the newspaper, and Richard Hargraves,
the editorial-page editor who wrote the editorial.
   The case gained national attention in 1984 when Hargraves was
jailed briefly for refusing to reveal the names of people he said
were confidential sources for the editorial.
   The newspaper endorsed Costello in his 1980 campaign for county
board chairman, saying he had promised to vigrously oppose any new
taxes without approval by voter referendum.
   After the election, the county board approved a creation of a
mass transit district with taxing powers, and the newspaper blasted
Costello in a scathing editorial.
   ``Jerry Costello lied to us ... and when he lied to us, he lied
to you,'' the editorial said in part.
   Costello filed a libel lawsuit against the newspaper, claiming
that he had lobbied against the measure but as the board's presiding
officer was barred by law from speaking or voting on the issue when
a roll call was taken.
   The lawsuit initially was dismissed by a circuit judge, but a
trial was ordered by a state appellate court. Costello was awarded
$600,000 in punitive damages and $450,000 in compensatory damages
after the trial judge found that the editorial's statements were
false and malicious.
   On appeal, a divided Illinois Appellate Court panel upheld the
verdict for Costello but threw out the punitive damage award and
reduce the compensatory award to $200,000. The majority opinion
called the editorial ``unduly harsh and vicious.''
   However, dissenting appellate Judge Robert Steigmann wrote that
the majority decision ``constitutes a threat to one of our most
important freedoms _ the freedom of the press to criticize
vigorously, and even unpleasantly, public officials in the execution
of their official duties.''

   Grain and soybean futures were mixed in early
trading today on the Chicago Board of Trade, with corn and oat
futures slightly higher while wheat and soybean prices were modestly
lower.
   Persistent rumors that the Soviet Union was in the market for
U.S. corn supported corn futures prices. But analysts said
expectations of large Soviet purchases of U.S. wheat appeared to be
fading _ and so was buying interest in wheat futures.
   Soybean traders continued to watch the planting weather in Brazil
and Argentina, the world's second- and fourth-largest soybean
producers, where conditions have been generally dry.
   ``They did have some fairly good rain in the early part of this
week,'' said Ted Mao, grain specialist with Shearson Lehman Hutton
Inc. in New York. ``Now the market will be looking ahead to see if
the front moving in this weekend will bring any significiant
precipitation or not.''
   In early trading, wheat was \ cent to 1 cent lower with the
contract for delivery in December at $4.26 a bushel; corn was \ cent
to 1{ cents higher with December at $2.67{ a bushel; oats were \
cent to 1 cent higher with December at $2.11} a bushel; soybeans
were 1 cent to 3 cents lower with January at $7.76{ a bushel.
   Cattle futures were mixed while pork futures were mostly higher
in early trading on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Live cattle were .17 cent lower to .20 cent higher with December
at 72.80 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .02 cent lower to .10
cent higher with January at 84.40 cents a pound; live hogs were .05
cent lower to .35 cent higher with December at 43.55 cents a pound;
frozen pork bellies were .33 cent to .53 cent higher with February
at 45.25 cents a pound.
   Livestock and meat futures settled mostly higher on Wednesday.

<TEXT>
   West Germany's central bank
boosted a key interest rate 0.5 percentage points to help prevent
inflation from flaring up, but a top official said the move
shouldn't be considered part of a coordinated international rate
hike.
   The Bundesbank raised the Lombard lending rate to 5.5 percent
from 5 percent effective Friday, but it kept the discount rate
unchanged at 3.5 percent.
   The Lombard rate is what the central bank charges on loans to
commercial banks when securities are used as collateral. The
discount rate is the main commercial bank loan.
   Bundesbank officials said the change in the Lombard rate came in
response to concerns about rising inflation.
   ``We are in an environment of slightly rising interest rates,''
said Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl.
   He said the economy is in a process ``which one can call a
boom,'' and that a tighter monetary policy is appropriate.
   Poehl also referred to interest rate developments in the United
States, Great Britain and other European countries. But he stressed
that the Lombard rate hike should not be seen as a concerted
interest rate increase.

<NOTE>Eds: CORRECTS name of plaintiff to Kimble sted Kimball throughout.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>WHARTON, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An Ohio natural gas producer has won a $600
million damage judgment against a Tenneco Inc. subsidiary, but
Tenneco quickly said it would appeal the jury award.
   The 12-member jury on Wednesday ruled that Tenneco's Tennessee
Gas Pipeline subsidiary broke a contract to buy natural gas from
Floyd Kimble, co-owner of Red Hill Oil Co. of Dover, Ohio.
   The jury awarded actual damages of about $250 million, plus
interest, and punitive damages of $350 million, according to Tenneco
officials.
   The verdict followed three days of deliberations and capped a
4{-month trial in Wharton before State District Judge Daniel R.
Sklar, who still must approve the verdict.
   Houston-based Tenneco issued a statement saying it was
disappointed with the verdict and would appeal it.
   ``I'm amazed _ shocked _ astonished,'' said Walter Sapp,
Tenneco's general counsel. ``I find it totally incredible.''
   The verdict stemmed from a suit the tiny company filed against
Tenneco in December 1985 that alleged Tenneco broke a contract it
had to buy certain volumes of gas, Tenneco spokeswoman M.A. Shute
said.
   Kimble was represented by Houston attorneys John O'Quinn and Al
Deaton, who were not available for comment Wednesday.
   The Wall Street Journal on Thursday quoted Kimble's wife Doris,
who is co-owner of Red Hill, as saying of the court challenge: ``We
felt we had valid reasons as individuals to seek fulfillment of the
contract.''
   According to a statement issued by a Dallas public relations firm
representing O'Quinn, the litigation stemmed from a practice by
pipeline companies _ when oil and gas prices were higher _ of making
contracts guaranteeing producers that the companies would buy their
gas at fair market prices.
   Sapp said the two sides ``had a wide dispute'' regarding the
amount of gas Tennessee Gas was obliged to buy from Kimble. He did
not have the specific amounts of gas each side claimed it had agreed
to buy.
   Kimble claimed Tennessee Gas broke its contract in 1983, but Sapp
said the company was acting on a provision in the contract that
allowed it to buy less gas under certain circumstances.

<HEAD>Airlines Working Toward Staggered Flights Agreement</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The two airlines that have nearly two-thirds of
the flights in and out of Chicago's O'Hare airport moved toward an
agreement today on staggering flights in an attempt to reduce delays.
   American Airlines and United Airlines worked out some tentative
scheduling arrangements for evening flights on Wednesday and were
tackling the morning flight schedule at O'Hare today, officials said.
   The discussions under the direction of the Federal Aviation
Administration were being conducted at a hotel near Washington. Any
agreement must be approved by the FAA.
   The scheduling changes, which often involve shifting flight
schedules only slightly, would not go into effect until March.
   The FAA recently directed a reduction in the maximum number of
flights per hour at O'Hare, the country's busiest airport, because
of concerns that air traffic controllers were being asked to handle
too many planes during some peak periods.
   This year there has been a sharp increase in controller errors
involving air traffic in the Chicago area.
   FAA spokesman Dick Stafford said the two-day meeting was expected
to produce a scheduling arrangement between American and United,
which together account for about 60 percent of the flights at O'Hare.
   ``Nothing at this point has been decided,'' said Stafford, adding
that the airlines had ``begun to make a little progress'' in working
out an arrangement.

   The stock market was mixed today in an atmosphere

   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 3.37 to 2,137.62 by

   The last trading will occur Friday in a series of expiring stock
index futures, index options and options on individual stocks.
   This quarterly ``witching hour,'' when program traders engaged in
multiple strategies move to close out their positions, has been less
stormy for the stock market in 1988 than it often was in previous
years.
   Still, analysts said, it gave investors another reason to take a
wary approach in a difficult, sluggish trading environment.
   Many investing institutions that managed to squeeze positive
results from their portfolios earlier in the year are waiting out
the last couple of weeks before New Year's simply hoping to keep
those results intact, brokers say.

<DATELINE>DEARBORN, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ford Motor Co. has developed an
inexpensive catalytic converter the automaker says is as effective
as platinum in meeting exhaust emissions standards.
   Ford Chairman Donald E. Petersen told the Pittsburgh High
Technology Council on Wednesday that the automaker is installing the
new converter on some 1989 cars.
   ``To appreciate the full implications of this patented
development, you must understand that at least some platinum _ a
very expensive and scarce metal _ has always been required in the
past to reduce tailpipe emissions to meet government standards,''
Petersen said.
   The idea for the converter evolved from Ford's use of ``theme
groups'' to develop new automotive technologies and adapt them to
the assembly line, Petersen said.
   Ford spokesman Bill Peacock declined today to reveal any details
about the new device or the material in it. He said it would cost
significantly less to produce, but was not specific, and did not say
how much of the savings would be passed on to the consumer.
   Peacock said if successful, the new device would not be put into
the general manufacturing process until after the 1989 model year.

<HEAD>IBM Decides To Extend Antitrust Settlement With EEC</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SALLY JACOBSEN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   International Business Machines Corp.
said Thursday it decided to extend a 1984 antitrust settlement that
requires the computer giant to give certain technical information to
competitors in Europe.
   The U.S. company and the European Economic Community said in a
statement that the accord ``has come to serve as an effective
vehicle'' for resolving questions on how competing machines can be
hooked up to IBM equipment.
   The 1984 settlement suspended a 4-year antitrust case brought by
the 12-nation trading bloc against IBM.
   IBM was allowed under the agreement the right to give, starting
Jan. 1, a year's notice that it would end the arrangement. That
meant the arrangement could have expired as early as Jan. 1, 1990.
   The agreement makes it easier for other companies to compete with
IBM by setting out a time schedule for release of certain data,
generally within four months, to enable competing equipment to
interconnect with hardware and software for IBM's large-scale System
370 mainframe computers.
   By extending the agreement, IBM avoided an uproar among Europeans
who dislike the dominance of an American-based company in the
European computer market. The agreement is relatively painless to
IBM and has not cut into its share of the market.
   The statement said the community and the company decided that
``neither foresees any change in circumstances that would cause
IBM'' to use its termination right.
   ``However, should such circumstances arise, IBM has agreed to
review the matter with the (EEC) prior to giving any notice,'' the
statement said.
   Jean-Francois Verstrynge, an official in the community's
competition department, said, ``IBM and the (EEC) have agreed that
they do not foresee that at the present time such special
circumstances will occur.'' The special conditions were not
specified.
   The move to extend the agreement, he said, was prompted by
concern the computer market would suffer from ``fear, uncertainty
and doubt'' if IBM had the power to give notice at any time.
   ``It was to eliminate this uncertainy'' that the extension was
sought, he told reporters.
   IBM is, in terms of revenue, the largest computer vendor in
Europe as well as worldwide.
   Verstrynge said the EEC's competition chief, Peter Sutherland,
met on Dec. 1 with C. Michael Armstrong, president of IBM Europe, to
discuss a continuation of the accord.
   ``It was an easy meeting,'' Verstrynge said. ``But Mr. Sutherland
was totally determined.''
   The trading bloc will continue reviewing the agreement annually,
he said.
   An IBM spokesman in Paris, who demanded anonymity, said the
arrangement ``does achieve the intended objective'' of providing a
means through which the company can provide data to competitors.
   He said that from August 1984 to last June 30, the computer firm
received 66 requests from 20 competitors covering 703 questions.
   Verstrynge said prior to the agreement, IBM could announce a new
piece of equipment without releasing technical details.
   ``The competitors could not react with competing products or
services because they didn't have the technical information,'' he
said.

<HEAD>Ex-NY Fed Reserve Bank Director Pleads Innocent To Insider Trading</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DANIEL J. WAKIN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEWARK, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former bank president accused of leaking
confidential interest rate data while he was a director of the New
York Federal Reserve Bank pleaded innocent Thursday to insider
trading charges.
   Robert A. Rough was arraigned before U.S. District Judge
Dickinson R. Debevoise one week after being indicted by a federal
grand jury here.
   Rough was accused of leaking information on the discount rate set
by the Federal Reserve Bank in Washington to principals at Bevill,
Bresler & Schulman Inc., a Livingston, N.J. brokerage firm that
later collapsed.
   The government alleged that Bevill, Bresler made millions of
dollars and avoided millions in losses because of the information,
which Rough allegedly exchanged for $47,000 in interest-free loans.
   Rough's attorney, Michael Himmel, said he would need time to
review thousands of transactions by the firm, which collapsed in
April 1985.
   Debevoise on Thursday set Rough's bail at a $150,000 personal
recognizance bond.
   A hearing on pre-trial motions was set for Feb. 14, and trial was
scheduled for Feb. 21.
   After Thursday's hearing, Himmel and Rough declined to comment.
   Authorities have called Rough's case the first insider trading
involving government securities and the Federal Reserve system.
   The indictment said that while he was president of the National
Bank of Sussex County in Branchville and sat on the New York Fed's
board from 1982 to 1984, Rough regularly leaked word on the New York
Fed's discount rate recommendation to the national Fed, as well as
the Fed's final determination on the rate.
   Changes in the discount rate _ the interest on Fed loans to
commercial banks _ have a powerful impact on the securities markets.
Fed officials have called action involving the rate one of their
most closely guarded secrets.
   Discount rate changes widely are regarded as the strongest
indication the Fed makes of the direction it wants to push interest
rates, which affect the price of debt securities such as bonds.
   After the Fed learned of the allegations against Rough, which
first were mentioned in April 1987 during testimony of a criminal
trial stemming from the Bevill, Bresler collapse, it tightened
procedures regarding the rate.
   Rough formally was charged with conspiracy to commit wire and
securities fraud, two counts of bank fraud, one count each of wire
fraud and securities fraud and two counts of making false statements
to banks.
   Rough resigned from Sussex National earlier this year,
prosecutors said.

   Share prices closed higher Thursday on the London
Stock Exchange, boosted by news that British wage growth slowed in
October and by some speculative buying of several major stocks.
   Dealers said overall trading volume remained low, with activity
concentrated in a few of the leading shares affected by takeover
speculation or special situations.
   Other share prices were higher in thin volume as the reported
slowdown in British average earnings reduced fears that British
interest rates would have to be increased again to curb inflation.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index closed up 7.1
points, or 0.4 percent, at 1,763.2, near the session peak.
   Volume was a modest 396.2 million shares, down from 447.1 million
shares a day earlier.
   Early in the trading session the market remained in negative
territory, preoccupied with evidence of an upward drift in world
interest rates.
   But the market turned around after the government reported that
the underlying annual rate of increase in average earnings fell to 9
percent in October from 9.25 percent in September and August.
   Most market forecasts had been for the rate to show no change on
the month, while some analysts called for faster growth.

<HEAD>Dollar Ends Higher After German Rate Hike, Gold Falls On Platinum
Selloff</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar rose in Europe on Thursday after an
expected increase in a key West German interest rate failed to
bolster the West German mark.
   Gold and silver prices fell in busy trading, pulled down by a
sell-off in platinum sparked by Ford Motor Co.'s announcement that
it had developed a catalytic converter that didn't use the metal.
   Dealers said speculation that the U.S. Federal Reserve would
follow the West German Bundesbank's move by boosting the U.S.
discount rate helped the dollar.
   Dealers widely had discounted the Bundesbank's move to raise its
key Lombard lending rate by 0.5 percentage point to 5.5 percent. But
many market players had held on to marks rather than dollars in
hopes that the move would boost the mark further against the U.S.
currency.
   When such a rise did not materialize, dealers sold their marks
for dollars and other currencies.
   ``The move was predicted, and there wasn't enough reaction to
it,'' one dealer said.
   The Lombard rate is the interest the West German central bank
charges commercial banks for supplemental borrowings in which
securities are used as collateral. The discount rate is what the
Federal Reserve charges on loans to commercial banks.
   The West German rate hike followed rate hikes on Wednesday and
Thursday by the central banks of France, Belgium and the Netherlands
and Austria.
   In London, the British pound dipped to $1.8280 from $1.8335 on
Wednesday.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Wednesday's
rates, included: 1.7485 West German marks, up from 1.7365; 1.4725
Swiss francs, up from 1.4630; 5.9745 French francs, up from 5.9350;
1.9665 Dutch guilders, up from 1.9590; 1,288.00 Italian lire, up
from 1,279.50; and 1.2054 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1986.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day begins,
the dollar fell 0.38 yen to a closing 122.97 yen. Later in London,
the dollar was quoted at 123.35 yen.
   A wave of platinum selling was sparked by reports that Ford Motor
Co. Chairman Donald Petersen said his company had developed a
catalyst that was just as effective as platinum in meeting stringent
exhaust emissions standards, but was significantly less expensive.
   Platinum tumbled to $565 an ounce at the close in Zurich, down
from Wednesday's close of $600 an ounce and the session high of $601.
   Gold fell in London to a late bid of $416.45 a troy ounce,
compared with $420.75 bid late Wednesday In Zurich, gold closed at
$416.00 an ounce, down from $420 bid late Wednesday.
   Earlier in Hong Kong, gold rose $1.67 to close at a bid of
$423.05.
   Silver bullion prices fell in London to a late bid of $6.11 a
troy ounce, compared with Wednesday's $6.16.

<HEAD>Grain Futures Advance, Soybeans Decline On Export Talk</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Grain futures prices closed modestly higher
Thursday on the Chicago Board of Trade amid rumors that the Soviet
Union may have purchased up to 2 million metric tons of U.S. corn.
   But soybean futures declined on the lack of confirmation of a
rumored sale of soybean meal to the Soviets, analysts said.
   The corn market has been strong all week on persistent rumors
that the Soviet Union was in the market for a large amount of U.S.
corn and sorghum.
   Those rumors intensified Thursday, with some observers saying
they believed the sale already had been completed.
   ``It is very likely that the sale has already gone through and
we're just waiting for official confirmation,'' said Ted Mao, a
grain specialist with Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. in New York.
   ``It wouldn't surprise me to see some sort of confirmation come
in the next 24 to 48 hours,'' he said.
   At the close, wheat was 2 cents to 3\ cents higher with the
contract for delivery in December at $4.28} a bushel; corn was
unchanged to 1\ cents higher with December at $2.68 a bushel; oats
were } cent to 2\ cents higher with December at $2.13 a bushel;
soybeans were 2 cents to 3} cents lower with January at $7.75 a
bushel.

<DATELINE>KINGSLEY, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Snow falls silently on the Michigan
battlefield as Tim Schmuckal inspects the ranks of Christmas tree
soldiers.
   Scotch pine, blue spruce and Douglas fir are destined for all
points of the United States to meet their artificial foe: the
plastic Christmas tree.
   ``I'm worried about that,'' says the 18-year-old Schmuckal,
shaking the snow from his brown hair.
   ``They're saying that 42 percent, 48 percent, of people are
buying artificial trees,'' he said.
   With a year of college under his belt, Schmuckal isn't sure there
is enough future in his father's northwestern Lower Peninsula
Christmas tree farm for him to take the same trade.
   The National Christmas Tree Association expects Americans will
buy 34.1 million natural trees this holiday, while about 30 million
people will put up artificial ones.
   There are other problems. The summer drought killed 2,000 young
trees at the Schmuckal farm, flooding hurt Michigan's 1986 harvest,
and an increase in small-scale growers threatens to undercut the
market.
   But growers say those woes are sideline skirmishes. From the
hand-worked 400 acres at the Schmuckal Tree Farm in northern
Michigan to the helicopter-harvested operations of the nation's
largest Christmas tree growers, it is fake trees that are hurting a
$1 billion-a-year business the most.
   The market share for artificial trees has continued increasing
despite a 21.8 percent jump in natural tree sales the past 11 years.
Only 20 years ago, fewer than 20 percent of the holiday trees were
artificial.
   ``We can't ship artificial trees fast enough,'' said Terrence
Hayes, vice president of the American Tree Co. in Pittsburgh. ``The
trees are looking more like real trees each year. And increased
prices don't make any difference. They still sell.''
   Artificial trees offer durability, safety and variety, their
sponsors say. They come in metallic pink, shimmering silver or
decorated with feathers. They come in symmetrical green perfection.
   But, ``they don't smell Christmas. ... And they're expensive,''
said Barry Brand, executive secretary of the Michigan Christmas Tree
Growers Association.
   Artificial trees also are causing problems for others: a charity
lot in Saginaw that once sold about 2,000 trees to raise money for
St. George's Catholic Church now reports sales of 1,400.
   Individual tree growers are doing what they can to compete,
pushing quality control programs and improving tree strains.
   Most trees are stained green before cutting to give them a good
color. Farms like the Schmuckal operation prune the crop into
classic cones by hand, while some bigger operations airlift the
harvest by helicopter so the trees won't lose needles from being
dragged on the ground or hauled in a truck.
   But the biggest push came just this year, when the
Milwaukee-based National Christmas Tree Association declared war
against fake trees with a $1 million promotional campaign.
   About three-fourths of the money is committed to television
commercials featuring NBC weatherman Willard Scott extolling pine
needles over plastic.
   Michigan, which supplied this year's Capitol Hill Christmas tree,
has inaugurated its own promotion with a quality control program.
Select trees that meet specifications are bestowed with a ``Michigan
Snowfresh'' tag before being loaded onto trucks headed for Florida,
New York, Mexico and Canada.
   ``We're trying to build up Michigan. There's something about
Michigan. We have the soils,'' Brand said.
   Oregon growers would disagree, said Don Becker, spokesman for the
National Christmas Tree Association said. Both states ship out about
6 million trees a year and claim to lead the nation.
   ``We don't get into it and just say the two states are the top
producers,'' Becker said.
   Back on his father's farm, Tim Schmuckal isn't certain Michigan
can do for Christmas trees what Idaho did for potatoes. Too few
trees bear the tag and the bulk of what consumers find in hometown
parking lots show no origin at all.
   The national association is not concerned that programs such as
``Snowfresh'' have that impact. Any cut tree is desirable, Becker
said. ``Just get out there and get one,'' he said.

   The stock market declined slightly today in an
atmosphere of caution approaching Friday's ``triple witching hour.''
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials dropped 3.38 to 2,130.87
by 3 p.m. on Wall Street.
   Losers outnumbered gainers by about 5 to 3 in nationwide trading
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 523 up, 817 down and
585 unchanged.
   The last trading will occur Friday in a series of expiring stock
index futures, index options and options on individual stocks.
   This quarterly ``witching hour,'' when program traders engaged in
multiple strategies move to close out their positions, has been less
stormy for the stock market in 1988 than it often was in previous
years.
   Still, analysts said, it gave investors another reason to take a
wary approach in a difficult, sluggish trading environment.
   Many investing institutions that managed to squeeze positive
results from their portfolios earlier in the year are waiting out
the last couple of weeks before New Year's simply hoping to keep
those results intact, brokers say.
   Tiger International rose 1~ to 16|. Late Wednesday the company
said it had been approached by a party it didn't name about a
possible takeover.
   Semiconductor stocks were a notable bright spot after Merrill
Lynch raised its ratings on the group.
   Texas Instruments, which said it had developed a new type of
integrated circuit, climbed 1\ to 38~; Motorola ~ to 40|; National
Semiconductor \ to 9], and Intel | to 22 in the over-the-counter

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The number of U.S. business failures fell by 6.3
percent during the first three quarters of this year, the best
performance in nearly a decade, according to a private survey
released Thursday.
   The number of business failures fell to 44,793 from 47,794 in the
first nine months of 1987, the report by Dun & Bradstreet Corp.
stated.
   Joseph Duncan, Dun & Bradstreet's corporate economist, said the
decline was ``larely attributable to decreases in the levels of
failures in the oil and agricultural states.''
   Agricultural business failures fell 54.9 percent. Duncan said the
number of agricultural failures soared in 1987 when farmers took
advantage of new protections under the federal bankruptcy law. The
rush to benefit from the new provisions subsided this year, leading
to the drop in failures in that industry.
   The only industry to see an increase in failures was wholesale
trade, where 5.4 percent more companies failed during the first nine
months of this year than in the same period a year earlier.
   In other industries, mining failures fell 25.5 percent;
transportation and utility failures were off 7.8 percent; retail
failures were off 6.6 percent; financial, insurance and real estate
failures fell 3.4 percent; failures of service companies were down
1.8 percent; construction failures were off 1.4 percent; and
manufacturing failures were essentially unchanged.
   Dun & Bradstreet is a financial information publisher.

<HEAD>EEC To Hold Talks With Japan On Dairy Imports</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The European Economic Community said
Thursday it will hold talks next month with Japan in an effort to
open Japan's dairy market to more imports.
   The 12-nation trading bloc would like Japan to ease measures that
it says protect the local dairy industry from foreign competition.
   The Japanese market for table cheese amounts to about 120,000
metric tons a year, with imports from the European trading group
accounting for some 27,000 tons.
   The study found that sales of European dairy products in Japan
were hindered by import quotas on cream, butter, powdered whey, and
condensed and powdered milk.
   It also said Japan maintains a 35 percent tariff on processed and
natural cheeses and limits the opening of large supermarkets that
are the main outlets for sales of imported cheese.
   Moreover, it said, exporters were faced with long delays at
customs offices and discriminatory labeling rules.
   As a result, European Community officials should press Japan to
slash the tariff on imported cheese, ease restrictions on expansion
of supermarkets and shift government subsidies from production to
promotion and consumer education, the study indicated.
   The study found that Japan's per capita consumption of dairy
products is one of the lowest among industrialized nations.

<HEAD>National Semi Announces Loss; Micron Has Big Gain</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   National Semiconductor Corp. on Thursday announced a $25.2
million net loss during its second fiscal quarter and company
officials blamed the loss on a sharp decline in bookings and sales
and a weak semiconductor market.
   The results contrasted sharply with those of another chip maker,
Micron Technology Inc., which said late Wednesday the profits in its
first fiscal quarter nearly quadrupled.
   National Semiconductor of Santa Clara, Calif., said its loss was
in contrast to a net profit of $11.6 million, or 8 cents a share, a
year earlier. Analysts were expecting the losses, noting that the
company faced a squeeze on pricing because of intense competition in
its markets.
   Sales for the second quarter, which ended Nov. 27, were $705.3
million compared to $640 million for the same quarter last year.
   For the first half of fiscal year 1989, sales were $1.35 billion,
with a net loss of $55.7 million. Sales in the same period of 1988
were $1.15 billion with net earnings of $25.1 million or 19 cents
per share.
   Micron Technology, of Boise, Idaho, did better because it makes
computer memory chips, which are priced highly because of short
supplies. It earned $32.2 million on revenue of $110.4 million
during the quarter that ended Dec. 1. Last year, Micron earned $8.4
million on revenue of $43.2 million.
   Per-share earnings were 88 cents for the quarter, compared to 33
cents per share a year ago.
   However, both income and revenue were down from the last quarter
of Micron's 1988 fiscal year, when the company had a record
quarterly profit.
   The declines were due largely to a higher effective tax rate and
costs associated with hiring new employees, said Kipp Bedard,
manager of investor relations. In addition, the company has been
setting money for legal expenses.
   In November, Texas Instruments filed a patent infringement
lawsuit against Micron. Texas Instruments alleges that Micron is
producing memory chips that disregard TI's patents.

   Assets of the nation's 459 money market mutual
funds rose $1.72 billion in the latest week, the Investment Company
Institute said Thursday.
   The rise, to $281.22 billion in the seven-day period ended
Wednesday, followed a $1.22 billion drop in the funds' assets the
previous week, according to the Washington-based mutual fund trade
group.
   The funds' assets hit a record high of $281.89 billion in the
week ended Nov. 23, 1988.
   The Investment Company Institute said that in the latest week,
assets of 230 general purpose funds rose $170.1 million to $90.06
billion, assets of 93 broker-dealer funds increased $117.7 million
to $117.86 billion, and assets of 136 institutional funds rose $1.43
billion to $73.3 billion.
   The seven-day average yield on money market mutual funds rose in
the week ended Tuesday to 7.95 percent from 7.85 percent the
previous week, according to Donoghue's Money Fund Report, a trade
journal based in Holliston, Mass.
   The 30-day average yield rose to 7.81 percent from 7.72 percent,
Donoghue's said.
   The average maturity of the portfolios held by money funds was 34
days, down from 35 days, Donoghue's said.
   Separately, the newsletter Bank Rate Monitor said its survey of
100 leading commercial banks, savings and loan assocations and
savings banks in the nation's 10 largest markets showed the
effective annual yield available on money market accounts rose to
6.17 percent as of Wednesday from 6.15 percent a week earlier.
   The North Palm Beach, Fla.-based newsletter said the effective
annual yield available on special savings accounts, called Super NOW
accounts, were unchanged at 5.13 percent.
   Bank Rate Monitor said the effective annual yield was 8.12
percent on six-month certificates of deposit, up from 8.08 percent
the previous week. Yields were 8.39 percent on 1-year CDs, up from
8.35 percent; 8.52 percent on 2{-year CDs, up from 8.49 percent; and
8.68 percent on 5-year CDs, up from 8.66 percent.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Co. announced
Thursday it had laid off about 120 employees, largely in its
municipal and equities departments.
   Meanwhile, another large brokerage firm, Kleinwort Benson Group
PLC said in London that it cut 35 jobs from its British equity
trading department. The firm employs around 4,000 people, including
about 600 in that division.
   Smith Barney, a division of Greenwich, Conn.-based Primerica
Corp., made its cuts ``after careful analysis of our staffing
requirements in the context of our current business environment,''
said spokesman Robert Connor.
   ``We decided that in the business environment that we're living
through some steps had to be taken to keep costs down,'' Connor said.
   Smith Barney posted an operating loss of $14.5 million in the
third quarter, compared with an operating profit of $10.5 million in
the year-ago period.
   Business has been off for many Wall Street firms in recent
months, particularly in stock trading.
   The hardest hit area was Smith Barney's municipal department,
where about 25 employees were laid off in the trading, syndicate and
investment banking areas, and in equities trading, where about 20
employees were laid off.
   Smith Barney employs about 6,300. So far this year it has cut its
staff by about 500, Connor said.
   At Kleinwort, a spokesman said the aim of its layoffs was ``to
reduce overheads to stay competitive in a very difficult market.''
   Kleinwort's move follows last week's decision by rival Morgan
Grenfell Group PLC to withdraw from market making in equity and
fixed-interest securities. Morgan Grenfell, which cut 450 jobs,
blamed tough trading conditions and a severe price war among market
makers.

   McGraw-Hill Inc., the publishing and information
services giant, said Thursday it had acquired Commodity Quotations
Inc., which provides up-to-the minute financial information. The
price was not disclosed.
   Commodity Quotations' Comstock product contains commodity,
securities and foreign exchange market information from more than 45
markets and exchanges in the United States, Canada and abroad.
   Comstock is used mainly by retail brokers and investment
advisers, but McGraw-Hill hopes to expand the service and the base
of customers who take it.
   Joseph L. Dionne, chairman and chief executive of McGraw-Hill,
said the acquisition was a step toward his company's long-term goal
``to provide niche markets with authoritative information, directly
and economically to personal computers, and on a real-time basis
which is essential to trading markets.''
   McGraw-Hill already has a service, Platt's Global Alert, that
provides spot news and up-to-the minute quotes for the oil and
petrochemicals industries and has been delivered via Comstock since
April.
   The company plans to expand Comstock into other commodity markets
and provide a full-service financial trading information product to
a wider audience that will include larger financial trading
companies.
   Commodity Quotations, which has offices in Scarsdale, N.Y., and
London, will become part of Standard & Poor's-McGraw-Hill, a unit of
McGraw Hill Financial Services Co., which provides financial,
economic and investment information and analytical service.

   Stock prices suffered some spotty losses Thursday
in an atmosphere of caution approaching Friday's ``triple witching
hour.''
   Analysts said buying also was restrained by interest-rate worries.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials slipped 1.25 to 2,133.00,
bringing its loss since the start of the week to 10.49 points.
   Declining issues outnumbered advances by more than 3 to 2 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
544 up, 844 down and 568 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 136.82 million
shares, against 132.35 million in the previous session. Nationwide,
consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in those
stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter market,
totaled 167.26 million shares.
   On Friday the last trading will occur in a series of expiring
stock index futures, index options and options on individual stocks.
   This quarterly ``witching hour,'' when program traders engaged in
multiple strategies move to close out their positions, has been less
stormy for the stock market in 1988 than it often was in previous
years.
   Still, analysts said, it gave investors another reason to take a
wary approach in a difficult, sluggish trading environment.
   Some interest rate increases in Europe, meanwhile, heightened
recent speculation that the Federal Reserve might soon raise its
discount rate.
   Many investing institutions that managed to squeeze positive
results from their portfolios earlier in the year are waiting out
the last couple of weeks before New Year's simply hoping to keep
those results intact, brokers say.

<HEAD>Primerica, Commercial Credit Shareholders Vote On Merger</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LINDA STOWELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>STAMFORD, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Commercial Credit Group Inc.'s $1.65
billion cash and stock buyout of Primerica Corp. was approved
overwhelmingly by shareholders of both companies on Thursday,
despite criticism by some Primerica workers and shareholders of big
severance payments for the company's executives.
   ``I only wish the powers that protected the executive board would
have protected the employees a little more,'' said Lorraine Cheney,
a Primerica employee for three years.
   Cheney and some others said their benefits have been cut, while
top executives of Primerica are receiving severance payments, called
golden parachutes, that reportedly total about $98 million.
   Under the buyout, shareholders will receive one share of
Commercial Credit common stock plus $7 in cash for each share of
Primerica.
   Based on Thursday's closing price, the deal is worth $28.25 a
share in cash and stock. Primerica closed at $28 a share on the New
York Stock Exchange.
   The combined companies will operate under the Primerica name.
Primerica, a Greenwich-based financial services and direct-marketing
company, is the parent of Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Co., the
investment firm it acquired in 1987 for $750 million.
   Separately, Smith Barney on Thursday announced the layoffs of 120
employees due to soft business conditions.
   Baltimore-based Commercial Credit is involved in consumer credit,
including lending, property and casualty insurance and credit cards.
   Shareholders for both companies approved the merger on Thursday.
Primerica shareholders voted in Stamford, while Commercial Credit
shareholders met in New York.
   Primerica's proxy statement does not give a total figure for the
severance payment package for its top executives. But published
reports have put the figure at about $98 million.
   Primerica spokespeople declined to discuss the figure, because
some shareholders have filed lawsuits against the company and its
directors in an attempt to stop the merger.
   The proxy does say that Primerica Chairman Gerald Tsai Jr. will
receive $19.2 million in cash, $8.6 million to cover excise taxes
and $10.4 million, relating to cancellation of stock options.
   The proxy also reports that Tsai, who will be the new company's
largest individual shareholder and director and chairman of the
board's executive committee, will receive an annual fee of $250,000,
office space, staff, plust business expenses.
   ``I can only tell you it is our judgment that this merger is in
the best interest of the shareholders,'' Tsai said.
   Tsai also said he could not discuss the golden parachutes because
the matter is in litigation. But he told one shareholder who
complained that 93 percent of the shareholders voted in favor of the
merger, ``so I guess you're in the minority.''

<TEXT>
   When Ivan Boesky returns to his mansion
after serving time for insider trading, there won't be a
Jeffersonian dome to greet him.
   The North Castle Zoning Board of Appeals voted 3-2 Wednesday
night to deny a request from Boesky's wife, Seema, to cap her
17-room Georgian home in Mount Kisco with a dome similar to the one
that tops Thomas Jefferson's Monticello home in Charlottesville, Va.
   Mrs. Boesky's plans were opposed by 11 neighbors.
   She needed special permission from the board because her plans
would have added a third floor to the house, which is at the center
of a 76-acre estate called Northview.
   North Castle zoning law limits buildings to 2{ stories.
   Those voting against the proposal said approval would have set an
undesirable precedent. Those supporting the dome said it would have
had little impact.
   Boesky paid a record $100 million fine in 1986 to settle federal
Securities and Exchange Commission charges of insider stock trading
and is serving a three-year prison term after pleading guilty in
April 1987 to a federal conspiracy charge. Boesky will be eligible
for parole in March.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mobil Chemical Co. said Thursday it has stopped
using ozone-destroying chemicals to make its foam packaging for
food, following through on a commitment made in April.
   Mobil Chemical is a leading producer of foam food containers for
schools, hospitals and fast-food restaurants. A plant in
Bakersfield, Calif., made most of the foam that used the chemicals,
called chlorofluorocarbons.
   The voluntary elimination of the compounds will affect less than
15 percent of Mobil's polystyrene foam products business, the
company said.
   ``We're able to take this step because our research effort gave
us an alternate blowing agent that is environmentally acceptable,''
said John Y. Glass, vice president and general manager of the
Polystyrene Business Group.
   Chlorofluorocarbons are believed responsible for depleting the
earth's ozone layer, a protective shield that screens out harmful
ultraviolet rays from the sun.
   The Food Service and Packaging Institute announced on April 12 a
voluntary program by all its members to phase out use of
chlorofluorocarbons by the end of 1988.
   Mobil Chemical, a Stamford, Conn.-based subsidiary of Mobil
Corp., recently announced it was opening a plastic foam recycling
plant in Massachusetts to recycle polystyrene foam products and
plastic cutlery.

<HEAD>Money Supply Increases in Week Ended Dec. 5</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The two broadest measures of the nation's money
supply rose in the week ended Dec. 5, the Federal Reserve Board
reported Thursday.
   The Fed said the measure known as M2 rose to a seasonally
adjusted $3,064.1 billion from $3,061.2 billion the previous week.
   An even broader measure, M3, increased to a seasonally adjusted
$3,899.4 billion from $3,895.9 billion.
   The narrowest measure of the money supply, M1, fell to a
seasonally adjusted $786.4 billion from a revised $787.5 billion.
   M1 includes cash in circulation, deposits in checking accounts
and non-bank travelers checks. M2 is M1 plus accounts like savings
deposits and money-market mutual funds. M3 is M2 plus less-liquid
accounts, such as certificates of deposit in minimum denominations
of $100,000.
   In judging its monetary policy, the Fed has indicated it is
monitoring the value of the dollar, commodity prices and the
difference between short- and long-term interest rates. It also has
shifted its attention from M1 to the two broader money supply
measures
   The Fed said in mid 1988 that it reaffirmed its target for annual
growth in M2 and M3 at between 4 percent and 8 percent, which is
slightly lower than the 1987 target of 5.5 percent to 8.5 percent.
The Fed has not set a specific target range for M1 since early 1987.
   In other reports:
   _The Federal Reserve Bank of New York reported commercial and
industrial loans at major New York City banks fell $770 million,
compared with a gain of $454 million a week earlier.
   _The Federal Reserve said bank borrowings from the Federal
Reserve System at the discount window averaged $413 billion, down
from $558 billion.

   One of the country's largest companies that
finances mobile homes and recreation vehicles has agreed to pay
$115,000 to settle Federal Trade Commission charges involving
discrimination against the elderly, the FTC said Thursday.
   Green Tree Acceptance Inc., of Minneapolis, was charged with
violating federal credit laws by failing to give some consumers a
reason for denying them credit and by informing others only that
they failed to meet unspecified internal credit standards.
   An amended complaint included the additional charge that the
company required elderly applicants to make higher down payments.
The FTC said the proposed consent decree is for settlement purposes
only and doesn't constitute an admission by the company that it
violated the law.

   Du Pont Co. signed a letter of intent to
purchase Hercules Inc.'s olefin carpet fiber business, doubling its
share of the international market for the cheap commercial carpet
fibers, a Du Pont spokesman announced Thursday.
   The purchase price was not disclosed, said Tom McAndrews,
director of the flooring systems division.
   Du Pont accounted for about $2 billion of the $20 billion
commercial and residential carpet market sales in 1988, McAndrews
said.
   The acquisition of the Hercules business, reported to sell $50
million to $60 million annually, will expand Du Pont's share of the
$400 million olefin fiber market to more than $100 million,
McAndrews said.
   Du Pont announced last month it planned to begin making olefin
fibers as part of a new program to market commercial carpets sold
through retail outlets.
   Under a supply cotract, Hercules will continue producing olefine
carpet fibers at near capacity for three to five years, according to
a company statement. Du Pont will have exclusive rights to that
production, after which time it plans to have expanded its capacity,
the company said.
   Du Pont also will obtain rights to Hercules' customer list and
marketing information, the company said.
   Du Pont is a diversified chemical, specialty products and energy
company with 1987 sales of $30.5 billion.

<HEAD>Platinum Market Collapses On Ford News</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Platinum futures prices collapsed Thursday on the New York
Mercantile Exchange after Ford Motor Co. announced development of a
platinum-free catalytic converter that could slash global demand for
the metal by one-third.
   On other markets, sugar futures plunged; energy futures fell;
grain futures were higher; soybeans were lower; livestock and meat
were mixed; and stock-index futures retreated.
   All platinum futures except the spot December contract settled
down the daily limit of $25 with the January contract at $579.50 a
troy ounce. The spot contract, which has no limit, finished $34.10
lower at $531.90.
   The use of platinum as a catalyst for chemical reactions in
automobile pollution-control systems accounted for about 38 percent
of world consumption of newly produced platinum last year and was
expected to represent about 35 percent of consumption this year.
   Speculative buying of platinum futures had been rising due to
recent projections that demand would continue outstripping
production through 1992. Ford's announcement jolted the market.
   ``It's a disaster,'' said Bette Raptopoulos, metals analyst with
Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. in New York. ``All our reasons for
being bullish on platinum have been defused.''
   Fred Demler, New York-based metals economist with Drexel Burnham
Lambert Inc. agreed: ``It's a major development. It could
potentially wipe out one-third of platinum consumption.''
   Ford Chairman Donald E. Peterson announced a pilot program for
the invention Wednesday evening but the news didn't hit the markets
until after the opening of platinum trading on the New York Merc.
   ``It came in dribs and drabs,'' said Ms. Raptopoulos. ``I had
heard it as a rumor as soon as the market opened but I was hesitant
to act.''
   She said the market started falling from its $606 opening, ad at
$601 she recommended selling the contract. That was at about 9:35
a.m., she said. Selling quickly escalated until the market went
limit-down at about 9:50 a.m.
   The first news service report of Peterson's remarks came across
the wires at about 10 a.m. EST.
   The platinum selloff spread to gold and silver futures, which are
traded on New York's Commodity Exchange.
   Gold settled $8.60 to $10.10 lower with February at $416.60 a
troy ounce; silver was 11.6 cents to 13 cents lower with March at
$6.185 a troy ounce.
   Sugar futures prices plummeted on New York's Coffee, Sugar and
Cocoa Exchange on indications that near-term availability of sugar
was on the rise, analysts said.
   Bearish factors included Thailand's announcement that it planned
to move up shipments of 100,000 metric tons of sugar from July to
March, and indications that China had been selling sugar, said
Judith Ganes, an analyst with Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. in New
York.
   Sugar settled .44 cents to 2.76 cents lower with the active March
contract at 10.84 cents a pound.
   Oil futures retreated in quiet trading on the New York Mercantile
Exchange amid profit-taking following the previous session's rally,
analysts said.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 2 cents to 38 cents
lower with January at $16.35 a barrel; heating oil was .19 cent to
.55 cent lower with January at 50.94 cents a gallon; unleaded
gasoline was .05 cent to .32 cent lower with January at 43.65 cents
a gallon.
   Grain futures finished modestly higher on the Chicago Board of
Trade amid rumors the Soviet Union may have purchased up to 2
million metric tons of U.S. corn.
   Soybean futures declined on the lack of confirmation of a rumored
sale of soybean meal to the Soviets, analysts said.
   Wheat settled 1} cents to 3{ cents higher with December at $4.28{
a bushel; corn was unchanged to 1{ cents higher with December at
$2.68\ a bushel; oats were 1} cents to 2{ cents higher with December
at $2.14 a bushel; soybeans were unchanged to 3 cents lower with
January at $7.75{ a bushel.
   Cattle futures finished mixed on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange
in positioning ahead of Friday's monthly cattle-on-feed report from
the Agriculture Department, while most pork futures declined.
   Live cattle settled .02 cent lower to .37 cent higher with
December at 72.97 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .35 cent lower
to .20 cent higher with January at 84.05 cents a pound; live hogs
were .03 cent to .30 cent lower with December at 43 cents a pound;
frozen pork bellies were 1.17 cents lower to .20 cent higher with
February at 43.87 cents a pound.
   Stock-index futures retreated moderately on the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange, where the contract for March delivery of the
Standard & Poor's 500 settled .70 point lower at 277.70. Each point
is worth $500.

<HEAD>Dollar Up, Gold Drops on Platinum Rout</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar strengthened Thursday after a West
German interest rate hike failed to hurt the U.S. currency and led
money dealers to assume the U.S. Federal Reserve would tighten
credit in this country.
   Gold prices dropped as much as $8.60 an ounce in New York in
reaction to tumbling platinum prices, a result of fears that the
world automobile industry demand for platinum could dwindle.
Precious metals historically move in the same direction.
   Currency strategists said the West German Bundesbank's hike in a
key lending rate from 5 percent to 5.5 percent raised speculation
that the U.S. central bank would raise its discount rate, the loan
fee to financial institutions, which as of Thursday stood at 6.5
percent. A higher U.S. rate would tend to make dollar-denominated
holdings worth more.
   Currency dealers also said the West German bank's move had
generated optimism that the West German mark would riseas well. But
when the mark did not rise as expected, speculators sold it and
bought dollars instead.
   In Tokyo, the dollar fell 0.38 Japanese yen to 122.97 yen. Later
in London the dollar was quoted at 123.35 yen. By the time trading
ended in New York the dollar fetched 123.86 yen, up from 122.77 yen
late Wednesday.
   In London, the British pound dipped to $1.8280 from $1.8335 on
Wednesday. In New York the pound fetched $1.8192, down from $1.8295
Wednesday.
   Other late dollar rates in New York compared with rates late
Wednesday: 1.7557 West German marks, up from 1.7374; 1.4783 Swiss
francs, up from 1.4655; 1.2054 Canadian dollars, up from 1.2020;
6.0075 French francs, up from 5.9390; and 1,296.50 Italian lire, up
from 1,285.25.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe compared with late rates
Wednesday: 1.7485 marks, up from 1.7365; 1.4725 Swiss francs, up
from 1.4630; 5.9745 French francs, up from 5.9350; 1.9665 Dutch
guilders, up from 1.9590; 1,288.00 Italian lire, up from 1,279.50;
and 1.2054 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1986.
   In the precious metals market, a barrage of platinum selling was
incited by reports that Ford Motor Co. had devised a substitute
material for platinum, which is heavily used by the automobile
industry for emission control devices. The platinum panic spilled
into the gold market.
   ``With platinum moving down so sharply, the psychology tarnished
the other precious metals and resulted in a wave of selling,'' said
Jeffrey Nichols, a strategist at American Precious Metal Advisers in
New York.
   At Republic National Bank in New York, gold was quoted at $413 a
troy ounce as of 4 p.m. EST, down from $421 late Wednesday. At the
New York Commodity Exchange, gold for current delivery dropped $8.60
to $412.90.
   Earlier in London, gold fell $4.30 an ounce to $416.45; in Zurich
it fell $4 to $416; and in Hong Kong it rose $1.67 to $423.05.
   Silver bullion for current delivery dropped 11.6 cents a troy
ounce on the New York Comex to $6.061. Silver in London fell 5 cents
an ounce to $6.11.

   Bond prices slipped Thursday and a key short-term
interest rate rose as traders puzzled over whether the Federal
Reserve had taken steps to boost interest rates.
   The Treasury's bellwether 30-year bond fell 3-32 point, or about
$1 for every $1,000 in face value. Its yield edged up to 9.05
percent from 9.04 percent late Wednesday.
   Trading volume was light, as investors sorted through the
available evidence on the economy's strength and the central bank's
likely reaction to the growth. Some analysts expect the Fed will
tighten credit for fear that the pace of economic growth will
rekindle inflation.
   Economic reports this week indicated only a moderate decline in
the nation's trade imbalance in October while industrial production,
the industrial operating rate and retail sales all rose in November.
   Traders also pointed to the West German central bank's hike in
one of its key lending rates Wednesday as increasing chances that
the Fed may do the same.
   Higher interest rates depress the prices on outstanding bond
issues.
   An important U.S. lending rate, the federal funds rate, rose as
high as 9 percent on Thursday before settling at 8~ percent late in
the day, up from 8] percent late Wednesday.
   The federal funds rate is the interest that banks charge each
other for short-term loans, and the Federal Reserve can influence
the level of the rate indirectly by buying or selling government
securities in the open market.
   Some traders concluded that when the Fed failed to do so at its
traditional midday juncture, while the federal funds rate was
trading at 8} percent, that the central bank had indeed tightened
its credit polciy.
   But others were not convinced. They noted that Thursday was a
corporate tax payment deadline and said that may have resulted in a
drain on bank reserves, forcing banks to borrow money.
   Robert Brusca, chief economist for Nikko Securities
International, said he doubts the Fed ``is going to tighten in a
clear, noticeable way.''
   ``I don't see any reason to do it. The economy has shown we can
get a suprising amount of growth without inflation and I don't think
the (Fed's) board of governors wants to stand in the way of that,''
Brusca said.
   Meanwhile, interest rates on 52-week Treasury bills rose in
Thursday's auction to the highest level for such a sale in 3{ years.
   The Treasury Department sold $9.0 billion of the bills at an
average discount rate of 8.49 percent, up from 7.92 percent at the
last auction on Nov. 17 and the highest since 9.24 percent on March
14, 1985.
   In the secondary market for Treasury issues, prices of short-term
government issues were down 3-32 point, intermediate governments
fell 1-16 point and 20-year issues lost 1-16 point, according to
Telerate Inc., a financial information service.
   The movement of a point is equivalent to a change of $10 in the
price of a bond with a $1,000 face value.
   The Shearson Lehman Daily Treasury Bond Index, which measures
price movements on all outstanding Treasury issues with maturities
of a year or longer, fell 0.68 to 1,129.78.
   In corporate trading, industrials were down. Moody's Investment
Grade Corporate Bond Index, which measures price movements on 80
corporate bonds with maturities of five years or longer, fell 0.83
to 292.95.
   In the tax-exempt market, prices lost 1-16 point, according to
the Bond Buyers index of 40 actively-traded municipal issues.
   Yields on three-month Treasury bills rose to 8.45 percent while
the discount rose 7 basis points to 8.17 percent. Yields on
six-month bills fell to 8.68 percent as the discount slipped 10
basis points to 8.22 percent. Yields on one-year bills rose to 9.16
percent as the discount rose 5 basis points to 8.49 percent.
   A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. The yield
is the annualized return on an investment in a Treasury bill. The
discount is the percentage that bills are selling below the face
value, which is paid at maturity.

   Three people were charged Thursday with
defrauding investors in a start-up jewelry company of $640,000 in a
case involving a New York brokerage firm already under scrutiny by
federal authorities, the U.S. attorney said.
   Stock of the jewelry company, Renaissance Enterprises, was
underwritten by Monarch Funding Inc. of New York.
   The Securities and Exchange Commission in a 1985 civil lawsuit
charged Monarch, its president, an employee and two others with
manipulating the stock of two Washington, D.C., companies. The
action was put on hold until January while the U.S. attorney in
Newark conducts an overlapping criminal investigation, said SEC
attorney Barry Goldsmith in Washington.
   An indictment unsealed Thursday accused Eric Wynn, 29, his wife
Annabelle Salaverria Wynn, 42, of Edison, N.J., and Francis LaMagra,
40, of Paramus, N.J., of conspiracy, interstate transportation of
fraudulently obtained stockholders' funds and income tax violations.
The indictment was returned May 20.
   Wynn was president of Renaissance, Mrs. Wynn was vice president
and LaMagra was an officer of Intercoastal Affiliates, a company
that dealt with Renaissance, the indictment said.
   It said they used several means to siphon off funds from the
offering, including making checks payable to accounts under
different names controlled by Wynn and under his wife's maiden name.
   They allegedly used $18,500 to buy personal jewelry. Phony loans
were made to companies created by the defendants, the indictment
said.
   The defendants could not be reached for comment. The Wynns have
an unpublished telephone number and LaMagra had no listing in
Paramus.
   ``Mr. LaMagra just unequivocably denies any criminal wrongdoing
in any of these matters,'' said his attorney, Robert De Groot. He
said the government had strung together innocent business activities
to create a fiction of wrongdoing. LaMagra has a ``history of
working in the banking industry'' and is a well-known business
consultant, the lawyer said.
   An attorney for the Wynns, Raymond A. Brown Sr., could not be
reached. He did not return a phone message.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Robert P. Warren, chief of the frauds
division, said the lag in unsealing the indictment was because of a
continuing investigation.
   LaMagra was convicted in federal court in Brooklyn, N.Y., in
April for conspiring to prepare false income tax returns for a
reputed captain in the Bonanno crime family, Louis Attanasio, said
Assistant U.S. Attorney Ruth Nordenbrook in Brooklyn.
   That case is on appeal.
   The SEC charged penny-stock underwriter Monarch, which maintains
its innocence, with illegally inflating the stock in 1982 and 1983
of Toxic Waste Containment Inc., a hazardous waste cleanup company,
and Liquidation Control Inc., a business consulting firm for
distressed companies.
   In November 1987, a former Wall Street analyst was sentenced to
eight years in prison by a federal judge in Newark for writing
falsely positive reports on the companies while having a financial
interest in them.
   Thursday's indictment said the Wynns and LaMagra, through false
claims and a false prospectus, caused Monarch to make ``false
representations to induce the public to invest'' in Renaissance.
   U.S. Attorney Samuel A. Alito Jr. said the defendants face at
least 50 years in jail each if convicted of all the charges.
   They were not arrested and no court appearance was set.

   General Electric Co. and two employees
pleaded innocent Thursday to federal charges of padding the cost of
a battlefield computer system by $10 million.
   GE, the nation's third-largest defense contractor, and the two
employees are charged with hiding savings negotiated with
subcontractors in a $270 million Army contract to make the computer
system.
   The two employees are James Badolato of Springfield, Pa., and
Gerald A. Leo of King of Prussia, Pa.
   ``The government alleges in essence that their materials and
subcontractor costs were inflated and the defendants and General
Electric knew it,'' said Nicholas C. Harbist, the assistant U.S.
attorney prosecuting the case.
   George Jamison, a GE spokesman in Connecticut, said the company
would stand by the statement it released at the time of the
indictments. In that statement, the company labeled the charges
``unfair and unfounded.''
   The company also said that an internal investigation into the
same matter showed pricing discrepancies totaling $3.69 million,
which the company already has refunded.
   In May 1985, GE pleaded guilty to unrelated contract-fraud
charges, paying a $1.04 million fine and reimbursing the government
$800,000.
   J. Clayton Undercofler III, the lawyer representing GE, said the
innocent pleas were entered in a brief hearing before federal
magistrate Edwin E. Naythons.
   A trial date for the current charges was set for Feb. 13.
   Badolato and Leo were released on their own recognizance under a
$250,000 bond. As part of the release agreement, the two men
surrendered their passports and agreed to restrict their travel to
the eastern district of Pennsylvania, Harbist said.
   The 321-count indictment, released Nov. 29, charges that the
scheme was conducted through GE's wholly-owned subsidiary Management
and Technical Services Co., or MATSCO, in the Philadelphia suburb of
King of Prussia.
   GE was awarded a $250 million contract in June 1983 to make the
``decentralized automated service support system,'' called the
DAS-3, for the Army.
   According to the indictment, the company and the two employees
lied to the Defense Department about the prices GE was paying for
parts and raw materials and double-billed for some materials.
   The Army would have been defrauded of $22 million if the scheme
had not been uncovered, the Pentagon said.
   The government charges Badolato, 41, formerly the subsidiary's
subcontracts manager, with trying to cover up the scheme by altering
dates of purchase orders and withholding information from goverment
auditors.
   Leo, 51, formerly the materials manager for MATSCO, is also
charged with lying to a federal auditor.
   Both men have been transferred to other parts of GE.
   Leo faces a maximum of 55 years in prison and $1.3 million in
fines if he is convicted on one count of racketeering, five counts
of mail fraud and two counts of making false statements and
concealing material facts from a federal agency.
   Badolato faces the same penalties plus $5,000 more in fines if
convicted of one count of racketeering, five counts of mail fraud,
one count of obstructing agency proceedings and one count of making
false statements and concealing material facts from a federal agency.
   GE is charged with five counts of mail fraud and 312 counts of
presenting false claims to the government.
   In Washington, Glen Flood, a spokesman for the Defense
Department, said he was unaware of any proceedings to suspend or bar
GE from bidding on defense contracts. An Army spokesman did not
return calls about the matter. Jamison would not comment on the
topic.

<DATELINE>OMAHA, Neb. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   ConAgra Inc. on Thursday said its earnings
rose 17 percent in the second quarter and were up 21 percent for the
first half of fiscal 1989, propelled by strength in poultry and
prepared foods businesses.
   The food processing conglomerate said second-quarter earnings
were a record $87.4 million, or 71 cents a share, on sales of $2.81
billion. That compares with earnings of $74.5 million, or 61 cents a
share, on sales of $2.30 billion in last year's second quarter.
   For the first half, earnings were $145.5 million, or $1.19 a
share, on sales of $5.58 billion. That compares with earnings of
$120.2 million, or 98 cents a share, on sales of $4.71 billion in
the same period last year.
   The company said its prepared foods segment had a substantial
profit gain in the second quarter and first half, led by an increase
in poultry earnings.
   Other strong performers were turkey products, consumer frozen
foods, agricultural products and grain processing and trading units.
   Fresh red meat earnings were below last year's levels, but losses
in the Armour processed meat unit narrowed in the first half, the
company said.
   ``Record second-quarter and first-half results are particularly
satisfying in light of the tough business environment,'' said
Charles M. Harper, ConAgra chairman and chief executive officer.
   ``In addition to intense competition, our businesses were
challenged by higher and volitile ingredient costs caused by the
drought,'' he said.

   The state Legislature voted unanimously
Thursday to temporarily restore to corporations in New York a weapon
to fight hostile takeover attempts by other companies.
   The measure validating the use of so-called ``poison pills'' was
approved 129-0 by the state Assembly and 52-0 by the Senate and sent
to Gov. Mario Cuomo's desk. The legislation, a product of
negotiations involving the governor's office, is expected to quickly
be signed into law by Cuomo.
   The measure is designed to undo until April 1, 1989, the result
of a state Supreme Court ruling earlier this year in which a poison
pill that Irving Bank Corp. tried to use to fend off a hostile
takeover by Bank of New York Co. was ruled illegal.
   That court decided New York state laws prohibit the inequitable
treatment of shareholders. That cleared the way for Bank of New
York's acquisition and raised concerns among the more than 100
companies in New York that have poison pill rules in place as
protection against hostile suitors.
   Under the poison pill scenario, a target company gives
shareholders the right to buy additional stock at reduced prices
when an outside party buys up a certain percentage of the company's
shares. That makes it far more expensive for a suitor to buy enough
stock to get a controlling interest in the target company.
   The poison pill is designed chiefly to give a company time to
fend off an unfriendly takeover, if it chooses, or to negotiate a
better price for its shareholders if it goes along with a buyout
offer.
   The Senate sponsor of the bill, Richard Schermerhorn, R-Orange,
said the Republican-controlled Senate originally favored validating
the poison pills for 18 months, but he said that time period was
reduced due to opposition in the Democratic Assembly.
   A special task force made up of business leaders and others is in
charge of studying the use of poison pills and other aspects of the
merger and acquisition field and will report to the Legislature by
early spring.
   Schermerhorn said he'd been told there were ``billions of dollars
out there'' that could be used in acquisitions and that some effort
must be made to head off the wholesale buying and selling of
companies.
   State. Sen. Franz Leichter, a Manhattan Democrat who voted for
the measure, said poison pills are sometimes used by corporate
management to ``keep itself in control.'' He said that can lead to
what he called abuses.
   ``Poison pills really are a way of changing the rules in the
middle of a game,'' he said.

<HEAD>Appeals Court Rules Leasing Violated Antitrust Act</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ST. LOUIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal appeals court on Thursday ruled that
the leasing of two corn wet milling plants in Iowa by Nabisco Brands
Inc. to Archer-Daniels-Midland Co. in 1982 was a violation of the
Sherman Antitrust Act.
   The government had claimed in a suit filed in December 1982 that
the lease created an unreasonable restraint of trade because it
would give ADM a large enough share of the high fructose corn syrup
(HFCS) market to control the price of the product.
   In the early 1970s, new technology allowed the processing by wet
corn milling plants of certain corn syrups into a substitute for
sugar in sweetening various products, including canned fruits and
soft drinks.
   The suit noted that since 1934 sugar cane and beet sugar growers
have benefitted from either direct subsidies or sugar price supports
enacted by Congress. Because of the price supports, the price of
HFCS has been substantially lower than the price of sugar for many
years.
   The government presented evidence that if the lease between ADM
and Nabisco was consummated, ADM would be able, because of its newly
established market position, to raise the price of HFCS to a level
just below the price of sugar.
   The companies, however, were granted a summary judgment in the
case in U.S. District Court in Iowa. That court agreed that sugar
and HFCS are in the same relevant product market, and that ADM's
share of that market was not sufficient to constitute a violation of
the Sherman Act or the Clayton Act.
   In its 2-1 decision Thursday, a panel of the 8th U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals ruled, however, that while sugar and HFCS are
functionally interchangeable, they are not reasonably
interchangeable because of the price differential between the two
products and therefore are not in the same relevant product market.
   The majority on the appeals court panel comprised judges Gerald
W. Heaney and Theodore McMillian.
   Dissenting was Judge Donald R. Ross, who said he agreed with the
district court's decision that HFCS and sugar belong in the same
relevant product market.

<HEAD>Coors Employees Reject Teamsters Representation</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GOLDEN, Colo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Brewery workers at Adolph Coors Co. have
voted overwhelmingly against union representation by the Teamsters,
a spokeswoman for the brewery said Thursday night.
   Results of the two days of balloting on union representation were
announced by Pam Crider, a brewery spokeswoman.
   ``Of the 1,562 eligible workers at the brewery, 1,081 voted
against union representation, while 413 voted for the union,'' she
said.
   ``Brewery workers have decided that they don't want union
representation,'' said John Meadows, director of community relations
for Coors. ``Coors will continue to work to maintain high-quality
relationships among its work force without third-party
representation.''
   The International Brotherhood of Teamsters switched a live
telephone in Golden to a recording after the vote was announced.
   The vote followed 18 months of union and company politicking at
the brewery, the nation's fourth largest.
   The Teamsters needed a simple majority to win representation for
the 1,600 Coors brewery workers.
   The brewery has been non-union since December 1978, when workers
voted overwhelmingly to withdraw from the AFL-CIO after a bitter
20-month strike.
   The strike had been effectively broken and triggered a nationwide
organized labor boycott of Coors products. That boycott officially
ended in August 1987 with an agreement between Coors and the AFL-CIO
and including the Teamsters.
   An agreement between Coors and the Teamsters stipulated that win
or lose, there will be no return to the boycott against Coors
products.
   Voting began Wednesday, when 126 brewery workers who had Thursday
off voted. It continued at three locations at the brewery on
Thursday, said Meadows.
   Key issues in the election included wages and pensions. The
Teamsters have touted the wages recently implemented and the pension
plan under consideration by Anheuser Busch Co.'s new brewery in Fort
Collins, Colo.
   Coors officials have warned employees not to count on those wage
and pension levels even if the Teamsters win, saying Busch is four
times as large as Coors and can afford salaries and benefits that
Coors cannot.
   Coors Chairman Bill Coors, addressing workers Monday in a series
of meetings at the brewery, rejected the Teamsters' claims that a
union victory would boost sales at Coors, which last year shipped
15.6 million barrels of beer and expects to sell 17 million barrels
this year.
   Teamsters Brewery Division Chief David Laughton has said the
union label would make Coors more palatable to many consumers and
boost sales as much as 10 percent.
   But Robert S. Weinberg, a beer industry analyst in St. Louis,
said the vote won't affect Coors sales one way or another.
   ``A non-union workforce is going to cost the company some
business. Similarly, a union workforce could cost some sales. The
question is: Is it a significant amount of business?'' he asked.
   The election was being conducted independently of the National
Labor Relations Board. University of Denver Prof. Tom Watkins, an
experienced labor arbitrator, was acting as the independent monitor.
   Coors reported third-quarter beer shipments of 5.57 million
barrels, up 8.1 percent from the same period a year earlier, and net
earnings for the period of $21.64 million, up marginally from a year
earlier.
