   A radical Palestinian group said two
French girls were released Monday after being held hostage for more
than a year with their mother and five Belgians, but the hours
passed with no sign of the children.
   Marie-Laure Betille, 7, and Virginie Betille, 6, left for Paris
on a plane, according to Walid Khaled, spokesman for the radical
Fatah-Revolutionary Council, headed by the reputed terrorist Abu
Nidal.
   In Paris, the French government said only that it continued to
``hope for a speedy release'' of the two girls.
   ``It has been indicated to the families, received at the Foreign
Ministry on their return from Beirut, that the French government is
keeping up hope for a speedy release and is pursuing its efforts in
this direction,'' a ministry spokesman said.
   In Beirut, Khaled told The Associated Press: ``I ask their father
Pascal Betille to be ready with lots of Christmas gifts to reunite
with his daughters.''
   He refused to say where the girls were released or to specify the
flight they were on. There had been widespread speculation the girls
would be freed in Libya or Algeria.
   Libya is Abu Nidal's main backer. Algeria, where the splinter
Palestinin faction has bases, had offered its help in returning the
girls to their father.
   Betille, who is separated from the girls' mother, Jacqueline
Valente, had spent the weekend in Lebanon along with the girls'
grandmother, Brigitte Valente, and another relative.
   The three left for Paris on Monday aboard a regular Middle East
Airlines flight. The girls were not aboard that plane.
   Fatah-Revolutionary Council said Sunday the girls would be freed
as a Christmas gift to the children of the world.
   ``I'm disappointed because I am going without my two little
darlings,'' Betille said before leaving Beirut. ``But I am carrying
with me a promise that they are going to be released soon.''
   Khaled said earlier the girls had been told of their imminent
release and that their mother no longer objected. ``They are old
enough and have accepted the coming separation. They are happy. They
did not cry,'' he said.
   In February, Ms. Valente said in a videotaped message released by
her captors that she refused to let her daughters go without her.
   Khaled released a new set of videotapes of Ms. Valente and the
five Belgian captives Sunday. They said they were being treated well
and sent season's greetings to relatives and friends.
   The captives did not disclose where they were being held, but
said the tapes were made Dec. 20. One said they were all living in
the same apartment.
   Khaled announced on Nov. 8, 1987 that his group had seized eight
French and Belgian nationals aboard their French-registered yacht,
the Silko, off the Israeli-occupied Gaza Strip.
   The Fatah-Revolutionary Council accused them of spying for
Israel. Israel denied it.
   Some press reports have said the captives were being held in the
sprawling Ein el-Hilweh refugee camp on the outskirts of south
Lebanon's port city of Sidon. Others said they were in Libya.
   Ms. Valente gave birth to a baby girl in captivity and is due to
deliver again in January, Khaled has said. Since her separation from
Betille, Ms. Valente has been living with Fernand Houtekins, one of
the five Belgian captives.
   The other four catives are Houtekins' elder brother, Emmanuel,
Emmanuel's wife, Godelieve and the couple's two children, Laurent,
17, and Valerie, 16.
   Emmanuel and Godelieve Houtekins paid tribute in the latest
videotaped messages to efforts by King Baudouin of Belgium to secure
their release and urged him to maintain interest in the case.
   Khaled confirmed the king had personally intervened through
intermediaries to help resolve the issue.
   In addition to the Silko captives, 15 foreign hostages are being
held in Lebanon: nine Americans, three Britons, an Italian, a
Belgian and an Irishman. They are believed held by pro-Iranian
Moslem fundamentalists.
   Peter Winkler, 32, a Swiss worker for the International Committee
of the Red Cross, was released Dec. 16 after nearly a month in
captivity. His kidnappers reportedly wanted to trade him for a
Shiite Moslem hijacker, Hussein Hariri, whose trial begins in
Switzerland in February.
   Abu Nidal, whose real name is Sabri el-Banna, formed his group in
1976, after splitting from Palestine Liberation Organization. He has
since topped wanted lists across the world for masterminding several
hijackings, bombings and assassinations.

   A city police official Monday denied a
published report that he offered to lie to reporters about a drug
investigation involving a former city employee who was visited by
Mayor Marion Barry last week.
   ``That statement is emphatically a lie,'' Deputy Chief Edward J.
Spurlock, said on WUSA-TV Monday. ``I would not lie in reference to
the performance of my duty.''
   The Washington Post reported Monday that Barry was in a city
hotel room with former city employee Charles Lewis on Thursday when
two detectives were called back from an attempt to make an
undercover drug buy from Lewis.
   The detectives had gone to the hotel to investigate a complaint
from hotel officials that Lewis offered drugs to a hotel maid. They
left the hotel after ``somebody called them back downstairs,'' the
Post reported, quoting city government sources.
   It was not revealed who called the detectives away or why they
left when they did, the paper said.
   The detectives were working from the 3rd District under Spurlock,
sources told the Post. The paper reported that Assistant Chief Issac
M. Fulwood told officers that Spurlock offered to lie to reporters
who called him about the actions of the detectives. However, Fulwood
later denied making the statement.
   Spurlock, asked about the report that he offered to lie about the
probe, said, ``I would arrest your mother or my mother if I caught
them doing a crime.''
   Police are conducting an internal investigation on whether Lewis
was involved in any drug activity, how police handled the complaint
and why the mayor was at the hotel, the Post said.
   The Post, in Tuesday's editions, quoted sources as saying that
the two detectives had given conflicting accounts of their actions
to police investigators. The paper identified the two as Pierre
Mitchell and Robert Thompson and said both had previously worked
off-duty at the Ramada Inn where Lewis stayed. However, the Post
said it could not be determined how their accounts differed.
   The paper also said Tuesday that Barry had acknowledged through a
spokesman that he had called police officials during the weekend to
ask them when they would conclude their investigation. The spokesman
said the mayor denied trying to influence the probe.
   Traces of cocaine were discovered in Lewis' hotel room after he
checked out on Friday, although the tests did not indicate whether
the cocaine had been in the room recently.
   The Post quoted sources as saying Barry visited the hotel six
times last week. The mayor acknowledged through a spokesman that he
visited Lewis at the hotel at least three times, but the mayor has
denied any wrongdoing.
   ``I would never knowingly associate with anybody using drugs or
dealing with drugs,'' the mayor said through a spokesman. ``Under no
circumstances would I associate with anybody doing this.''
   Meanwhile, an elected member of the city Advisory Neighborhood
Commission called Monday for an independent investigation.
   ``I'm not totally sure about the police department's
investigation in it because, remember, the chief (of police) is
appointed by the mayor,'' said Virgil Thompson. ``I want no
involvement of the police department, the city council or the
executive branch of government.''

   With the roar of cars from Interstate 87 behind
him, Richard DeSimone had 25 city sixth-graders bend over to look in
the mud for traffic of a quieter kind.
   ``A muskrat's been here,'' he told them, pointing out a pawprint
with a line through it, evidence of a muskrat dragging its tail.
DeSimone then showed them footprints made by a raccoon. The children
jockeyed for views.
   In Van Cortlandt Park, an oasis in the Bronx that has been home
to animals ranging from snapping turtles to two white-tailed deer
spotted last year, DeSimone taught the children to be nature
detectives and park stewards.
   He is one of New York City's 68 urban park rangers, a group of
goodwill ambassadors that has educated tens of thousands of city
dwellers about the nature around them.
   The program in the nation's largest city, now in its 10th year,
has become a model. Park ranger programs have started in about 15
cities, including Seattle, Philadelphia, Boston and Cleveland. The
programs are independent from the National Park Service, which
oversees federal wilderness areas.
   ``Park rangers are such a welcome and comforting force in any
park,'' said Mary Kimmitt, deputy director of the Philadelphia
Ranger Corps, which started a year ago.
   In some areas, the presence of rangers helps keep down the crime
rate. In New York's Central Park, for instance, the number of
felonies dropped 28 percent in the last four years; robberies alone
fell 40 percent.
   ``We're trying to get people back in the parks,'' said Therese
Braddick, director of New York's urban rangers. ``Some people
believe they're not safe, and at night many areas aren't.''
   Still, while law enforcement in New York's parks is handled by
police and a 180-member park patrol squad, Ms. Braddick said, ``We
provide a sense of security for people.''
   Besides, rangers show New Yorkers that their backyard is not all
concrete. Last year, 84,000 people attended 2,618 educational
programs held by the rangers.
   ``When you think of Manhattan, the picture of beautiful park land
doesn't come to mind,'' Ms. Braddick said.
   And yet in this city of 8 million people there are 26,000 acres
of parks.
   There are 30 species of ducks, 10 species of owls, 15 types of
hawks and falcons, red foxes, snapping turtles, raccoons, skunks,
and, occasionally, deer from Westchester County to the north. The
areas have about 30 types of endangered plants, including the winged
monkey flower.
   New York's first park, Bowling Green, was created in 1733. The
city set aside land for Central Park in the mid-1850s, created the
Department of Parks in 1870 and during commissioner Robert Moses'
tenure from 1934 to 1960 doubled park acreage.
   There is little left to put aside now. ``The city has filled its
borders,'' said park historian Jonathan Kuhn.
   The end of major park expansion makes the current public land
that much more important, rangers say.
   One place Braddick loves to visit is Pelham Bay Park in the
Bronx, with its salt marsh, mud flats, 13 miles of rocky shoreline
and 520 acres of forest.
   Herman Barrocales, 33, fished in Brooklyn's Prospect Park when he
was a boy. Now he is a park ranger stationed there. One of his jobs
is to lead hawk watches.
   On a crisp morning recently, he passed around binoculars on a
second story terrace in Prospect Park's Boathouse. He told the dozen
people who came by that New York was a choice location to see hawks
as it is on their fly path from Canada to warmer spots.
   In an hour, five birds of prey were sighted, including the rare
peregrine falcon. The falcon took its time in passing. Barrocales,
normally talkative, barely said a word as he watched.
   The children from P.S. 122 who visited Van Cortlandt Park also
were impressed by the wildlife around them.
   After listening to DeSimone's message that they should take care
of the parks _ underscored as he picked up a plastic six-pack holder
and broke its rings, which can strangle ducks _ 11 year-old Lanette
Romero said she had learned a lesson:
   ``You should keep your eyes open, make sure you don't harm
animals and look for clues like footprints.''
   After school, she was going to the library, she said. ``I'm going
to find more out about muskrats.''

   Dozens of health care, child care and family
bills that died this year with the 100th Congress are bound for
resuscitation in 1989, their prospects at once better and worse than
before.
   On the plus side, President-elect Bush repeatedly called for ``a
kinder, gentler nation'' during his campaign and proposed to spend
more on child care, health care, education and homeless aid.
   Lawmakers are seizing on Bush's interest to promote their own
versions of child care and other social initiatives, taking heart in
what they view as a consensus on ends if not means.
   On the other side of the coin is Bush's pledge of ``no new
taxes.'' If he keeps that vow, says one key lawmaker, no social
projects are likely to make it into the blueprint for fiscal 1990
spending.
   ``If the president-elect will move on his position on (tax)
revenues, we can make room for some of these initiatives,'' said
Rep. Leon Panetta, D-Calif., incoming chairman of the House Budget
Committee. ``If we could pick up half of a deficit reduction package
in revenues (as opposed to cuts), we would make room.'' He said that
would amount to about $15 billion in new taxes.
   ``The worst consequence of the deficit problem is that we are
losing resources that could be devoted to (social) priorities,''
Panetta added. ``We're paying $166 billion in interest on the debt.
That's money that's not going for hunger, housing, nutrition and day
care.''
   Panetta's Senate counterpart, Tennessee Democrat Jim Sasser,
stopped short of giving Bush an ultimatum but indicated that without
new tax revenues, domestic spending increases will have to wait.
   ``It may be possible to redirect some resources to some domestic
needs,'' Sasser said, speculating that dollars could be shifted from
defense to education, health care and infrastructure. ``Maybe not
this year, maybe not next year, maybe the year after.''
   Budget woes and philosophical splits over the last two years
buried proposals to expand child care, guarantee parental leave,
provide nursing home and home health care benefits, increase the
minimum wage, require employer-sponsored worker health benefits and
offer tax breaks to families with children.
   All are certain to be back this year, along with Bush's campaign
proposals. And most will come through the House Education and Labor
Committee chaired by Augustus Hawkins, D-Calif., who has a pledge of
his own: to promote anything his committee thinks will be good for
the country _ cost be damned.
   ``We're just going to pass them and allow them (the budget
architects) to adjust the budget in such a way as to pay for them,''
Hawkins said in an interview. ``We're not advocating anything we
can't justify. ... We think they will create earnings and reduce
social costs'' in the long run.
   But Hawkins' attitude is increasingly rare on Capitol Hill.
   ``Pay as you go is the rule. We crossed that threshold with
catastrophic health care,'' said Panetta, referring to the 100th
Congress' expansion of Medicare coverage. The program is being paid
for by beneficiaries.
   Along the same lines, House Ways and Means Chairman Dan
Rostenkowski, D-Ill., said this month that members of his
tax-writing committee ``are not going to endorse any new spending or
revenue-losing proposal, however meritorious, unless it is included
in a package that is self-financing.''
   Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, the senior Republican on the Labor and
Human Resources Committee, said a tax hike at least for some
segments of society will be necessary to finance new social programs
if Bush and Congress do not cut spending.
   ``What we've got to do is find offsets,'' he said. ``We're going
to have to make priority choices between competing programs. We're
going to have to get the money from some that aren't really that
important.''
   But Hatch, who chaired his committee when the GOP controlled the
Senate, conceded most programs are well-intentioned and many work
well. Short of cuts to offset new spending, he suggested that a
multi-billion dollar child-care program might, for example, be
financed by a new tax on major corporations.
   The tax would be imposed ``on the theory that they should be
leading out in this area,'' Hatch said. ``We could alleviate the tax
if they do something for child care. The workforce is diminishing.
It's in their best interest to get involved.''
   Among the major social initiatives expected in the 101st Congress:
   CHILD CARE. Democrats will reintroduce their $2.5 billion Act for
Better Child Care, designed to subsidize day care for lower income
people and bring care up to minimum federal health, safety and
staffing standards. Bush has proposed a $2.2 billion plan to expand
Head Start, make the dependent care credit available in the form of
a refund to those who owe no taxes, and give a tax break to
low-income families with young children, whether or not they are in
day care. A middle-ground, bipartisan proposal may be forthcoming
from the Senate Finance Committee.
   HEALTH CARE. Competing needs include long-term nursing home care,
a pet project of new Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell,
D-Maine; long-term home care, pushed by Rep. Claude Pepper, D-Fla.,
and health insurance for the 37 million Americans who don't have it.
On the last, Bush has proposed letting people ``buy into Medicaid.''
But some congressional heavyweights including Sen. Edward Kennedy,
D-Mass., and Rep. Henry Waxman, D-Calif., want all employers to
provide coverage _ which would help two-thirds of those now
uncovered. Rostenkowski, for his part, has said there is no way
Congress can take care of long-term care and the uninsured in one
session.
   FAMILY LEAVE. Bush has said women shouldn't have to worry about
losing their jobs if they take time off to care for new babies.
That's far short of congressional proposals that would require
businesses to give leave to both parents to care for newborn, newly
adopted or seriously ill children, to employees with serious medical
problems themselves, and in one case to employees to care for ailing
relatives. But some lawmakers are optimistic about a compromise,
given Bush's interest in the issue.
   MINIMUM WAGE. Efforts to raise the minimum wage stalled in the
100th Congress over President Reagan's insistence on linking any
hike to the creation of a subminimum training wage. Bush also favors
a subminimum wage, but has not been specific about to whom it would
apply. Kennedy, a prime mover on the issue, believes there may be
room for negotiation and a chance for early passage.
   EDUCATION. Bush has proposed a $500 million merit schools program
to reward schools that get good results from largely disadvantaged
student bodies. He also has proposed a $50 million fund to spur the
establishment of magnet schools.
   HOMELESS. Bush said in the campaign that the McKinney Act
designed to help the homeless should be fully funded. For the first
two years of the act, Congress released only $713 million of an
authorized $1.1 billion. This year Congress appropriated $378
million for the homeless act, considerably less than the auhorized
ceiling of $634 million.

<TEXT>
   President Carlos Salinas de Gortari has kicked
a political hornet's nest by suggesting the Roman Catholic Church,
technically illegal in Mexico since 1917, be restored to normal
status.
   The constitution ratified in that year by the triumphant forces
of the Mexican revolution went beyond separation of church and
state. It denied the church legal existence and tried to eliminate
church influence.
   Mexico remains the most Catholic country in the hemisphere
nonetheless, and the church has not faded. Every year, millions of
people take part in public processions to the Basilica of the Virgin
of Guadalupe, the country's patron saint.
   Salinas acknowledged reality by declaring in his inaugural speech
Dec. 1 that a ``modern state deals openly and modernizes its
relationship with unions, business groups, news organizations ...
and the church.''
   It was the first time in modern Mexico a president publicly
acknowledged the church as part of society. Sitting in the gallery
for the first time were representatives of the church: Cardinal
Ernesto Corripio Ahumada, four other bishops and Papal Nuncio
Girolamo Prigione, the pope's ambassador.
   Church leaders welcomed the move and conservative parties said
they favored a debate to redefine the church's role. Critics said
the government should stick to the constitution.
   Salinas' Institutional Revolutionary Party, which has controlled
the government since it was founded 60 years ago, was torn between
supporting him and loyalty to the constitution's framers.
   Congresswoman Socorro Diaz said: ``The reopening of a debate
settled by history ... does not strengthen national unity and
creates disagreement and confrontation among Mexicans.'' She is
director of El Dia, a newspaper sponsored by the party's left wing.
   Some saw the president's move as an effort to widen support for
his government while his party is losing traditional backing from
labor and the middle class.
   The issue does divide the opposition. During a debate in
Congress, conservatives shouted ``Fanatic!'' ``Robespierre!'' and
``Son of Lenin!'' at left-wing members who opposed the reassessment.
   An officially anti-clerical government leading a largely Catholic
population is one of Mexico's contradictions. The government ignores
technical violations of the law by the church in order to maintain
social peace.
   One paragraph in Article 130 of the constitution says: ``The law
does not recognize the religious associations known as churches.''
   In the eyes of the peasant, union and military revolutionaries
who wrote it, the church was part of an oppressive landowning
establishment. To the hierarchy, they were godless destroyers of
established order.
   Churches cannot own property and the government has the power to
determine the number of priests in each state. Foreign priests are
prohibited from working in Mexico and public displays of religion
are forbidden.
   Priests do not have the right to vote, but do so. They are not
allowed to speak or write about politics or the government, but
write opinion columns. They are barred from teaching, but the
Catholic Church runs schools and universities where the children of
government leaders study.
   Presidents hold private meetings with bishops.
   Two million people attended a Mass in Mexico City conducted by
Pope John Paul II. He spent a week in Mexico during his first trip
to America.
   In the late 1920s, Catholics conducted the Cristero revolt
because of government persecution. A church hero was the Rev. Miguel
Pro, a Jesuit priest executed by the government, who was beatified
in November.
   A few days after the Salinas inaugural, Interior Minister
Fernando Gutierrez Barrios caused front-page headlines by declaring:
``The church exists,'' and since then the debate has covered acres
of newsprint.
   In Congress, Popular Socialist Party member Alfredo Reyes
Contreras said even the presence of prelates at the inauguration had
violated the Mexican constitution. He demanded an investigation.
   A leader of the Unified Socialist Party, Gilberto Rincon
Gallardo, a Catholic, said change is needed because the current
situation ``stimulates fanaticism.''
   The Popular and Unified Socialist parties both belong to the
Democratic Front coalition that supported Cuauhtemoc Cardenas
against Salinas in the July 6 presidential election.
   Salinas should be able to get the two-thirds vote he needs in
Congress to change the constitution, if he wants to do so. His party
controls 60 of 64 Senate seats, and although it has only 260 of 500
lower house seats it can expect support from the conservative
National Action Party's 101 members.

   Shoppers with visions of after-Christmas sales dancing in their
heads jammed malls across the nation Monday as gifts were traded
from California to New Jersey, but Boston's famed bargain basement
wasn't booming.
   The day after Christmas is one of the biggest shopping days of
the year, and this year, retailers reveled in a happy coincidence
that gave most people the day off to return gifts and swarm around
sale tables.
   ``It's packed, it'll be maxed out today,'' said Lora Dubbs,
manager of the 269-store Galleria in the Los Angeles suburb of
Glendale. The mall's department stores opened two hours early, at 8
a.m., she said.
   In San Diego County, dressing-room lines were so long at the
Nordstrom's department store in the North County Fair mall that men
took their bargain duds to the men's restroom to try on.
   In Indiana, stores were packed with shoppers looking for deals
and returning gifts that weren't quite right. Returns increase at
least tenfold the day after Christmas, said Rod Rumrill, manager of
the Brownsburg K mart.
   In Minnesota, consumers were welcome to make returns with few
questions asked, said George Hite, a spokesman for Target Stores, in
Minneapolis.
   Returned items ranged from clothing to telephone answering
machines, Hite said.
   ``What happens (with answering machines) is people realize
nobody's calling them,'' said Hite. ``We get a lot back.''
   New Jersey shoppers lined up early at stores to return Christmas
gifts and to take advantage of sales in the post-Yuletide rush.
   ``This is one of the biggest shopping days of the year _ tied
with Thanksgiving,'' said Mary Kitsos, assistant mall manager at the
Bergen Mall in Paramus.
   In Michigan, consumers looking for a better fit kept some stores
busy.
   ``Those misfit gifts are coming back,'' said Randy Boadway,
manager at Meijer's Thrifty Acres, in Northville.
   ``Crazy,'' is how K mart employee Lynn Berglund described the
activity at a store in Kingsford. Most people seemed to be sweeping
up holiday items at bargain prices, Berglund said. Wrapping paper
was most popular.
   But in Boston, cashiers at Filene's Basement looked disappointed
when the expected crowds failed to materialize at the famed bargain
mecca by noon Monday.
   ``I kind of look forward to them,'' said Nelda Scott, referring
to the traditional post-holiday shopping crowd. ``It can be fun if
the customers are nice.''
   Store clerks said that the confusion over store hours Monday may
have contributed to the lesser turnout. A judge ruled last week
against retailers who sought permission to open all day Monday.
   Although Filene's and other stores around Boston's Downtown
Crossing appeared quieter than normal, other shopping malls in the
region reported good turnouts.
   ``The stores picked up around noon,'' said Beth Chase, a clerk at
Bloomingdale's at the Chestnut Hill Mall. ``I think a lot of people
got up late, had brunch and then went shopping.''
   But some store managers already had their minds on other holiday
happiness to sell.
   ``Valentine's Day goes up tomorrow,'' said Joann DeMilner,
manager of Gala's Hallmark in suburban Detroit.

   On school days, 9-year-old Jamie Swartz
takes her lunchbox and books and joins the world of children. She
giggles with her classmates and makes drawings for display on the
family refrigerator.
   And then she returns to a world of adult rules where she is not
welcome.
   The adults-only condominium where she moved in to live with her
father as her mother lay dying of cancer has become an unfriendly
place following the condo board's decision to force the child off
the premises by Jan. 10.
   The impact of the Viewpointe condominium board's order has
spilled beyond the cream-colored stucco buildings that overlook a
man-made pond and the rear of the shopping center in this inland
community 30 miles north of Miami.
   In Florida, second only to Hawaii in the number of condo
dwellers, the girl's plight has rallied critics of ``condo
commandos'' who zealously enforce their rules.
   Attorneys and condominium directors are watching the controversy
with interest; a federal anti-discrimination housing law outlawing
many adults-only communities is set to take effect in March.
   ``I understand the perception this case has,'' said Douglas
Neway, an attorney representing the Viewpointe board. ``But the rule
is `no children' and they have a right to enforce that rule.''
   ``This place is run like the Gestapo,'' said Jamie's stepmother,
Jill Swartz. ``You can always make an exception.''
   The girl's stepmother and father, Lynn, are seeking a buyer for
the two-bedroom condominium while the board threatens to begin
eviction proceedings.
   So far there have been no bids for the $56,000 unit, which the
couple purchased three years ago for about $50,000.
   ``I think the publicity has hurt us. Who wants to buy a place
where they think the neighbors don't try to work with you?'' said
Ms. Swartz.
   Jamie moved into the complex in April after her 42-year-old
mother, Maye Swartz, was hospitalized with cancer. The condo board
voted in July to allow Jamie to stay until her mother finished
chemotherapy. She died in September.
   As the Jan. 10 deadline nears, the Swartzes are preparing to
fight.
   ``We can't afford to pay a mortgage on two homes,'' said Ms.
Swartz. ``If we ever want to get a little house on a street with
children for Jamie, then we can't walk away from this place.
   ``Believe me, we'd like to leave,'' said Ms. Swartz, who doesn't
allow the girl to talk to reporters. ``Jamie walks through the
complex and no one will talk to her. She's been brave, but it's
still rough for a little girl who's been through what she has.''
   Many of the Swartzes' neighbors were sympathetic to the family's
dilemma, but none would give their name for fear of irritating the
condo board, whose members are elected from the complex.
   ``She's a quiet little girl who doesn't bother anyone,'' said a
woman living next door. ``What ever happened to helping people out
in time of crisis? I guess that's old-fashioned.''
   If a court battle ensues, several factors are working in the
couple's favor, said Harvey Koppell, an attorney who offered free
assistance to the Swartzes.
   Koppell said the Viewpointe bylaws allow exemptions from the
adults-only rule. In addition, the condo board may be forced to
accept Jamie when the federal Fair Housing Amendment Act takes
effect March 12.
   The new provisions ban age discrimination with the exception of
subsidized facilities for the elderly, or in complexes where all
occupants are 62 or older or if 80 percent of the units have one
resident at least 55 years old.
   ``I don't think they are even close to meeting one of the
exemptions,'' said Koppell.
   Neway said he believes the complex may fulfill the 55-year-old
exemption, but no surveys have been taken.
   The concept of adults-only living is well accepted in Florida,
where legions of retirees seek friends their own age and a respite
from the noise of children.
   But fears from some condo directors that the Swartzes' stalemate
will be replayed elsewhere may be unwarranted, said attorney Gary
Poliakoff, author of ``The Law of Condominium Operations.''
   ``Retirement communities are generally built in areas not near
schools and other services,'' said Poliakoff, whose Fort Lauderdale
firm represents 1,600 condo associations across the country. ``There
are no facilities designed for children. How many families do you
think will want to live in an adult-only setting?''
   Some who have chosen to fight the adults-only trend in Florida
have lost. In 1977, a couple was forced out of their Tamarac
condominium after having a baby. The unsuccessful age discrimination
suit went as far as the Florida Supreme Court.

   When Pan Am flight 103 crashed last week,
claiming more than 280 lives, the reaction was one of virtual
universal horror. But the death toll was only a small fraction of
the number of children under 5 who die almost unnoticed each day
from hunger and disease.
   If Christmas Day was typical, about 38,300 such children from
poor countries died, according to new estimates released by the
United Nation's Children's Fund.
   Put another way, the death toll from the Pan Am flight is equaled
every 10 minutes or so in terms of children aged 5 and under.
   These figures are derived from UNICEF's calculation that 14
million children under age 5 died in 1987, partly because so many
countries in Latin America, Asia and Africa, impoverished by debt
and other factors, are cutting back on social services.
   UNICEF executive director James Grant said last week that 3
million of these children died last year ``because they didn't have
50 cents worth of vaccine in them.''
   The situation apparently has changed little and may have even
worsened in 1988. The World Bank reported last week that poorer
countries are transferring their wealth to richer nations at record
levels this year _ 50 percent higher than 1987.
   The bank said the 17 most highly indebted countries of the Third
World will give wealthy countries $31.1 billion more than they
receive, triple the amount of 1983. Crushing debt repayments mean
less money left over for imports of basic human necessities such as
food and medicine.
   No region has been harder hit than Latin America, where per
capita income is 8 percent below 1980 levels.
   The Inter-American Dialogue, a gathering of concerned citizens
from throughout the hemisphere, said in a recent report the social
consequences of Latin America's prolonged depression have been
multiplying.
   ``The people of Latin America have seen their wages fall and
their jobs disappear; their housing, schools, hospitals and other
public services have deteriorated; and they have endured food
shortages and mounting street crime.
   ``Financially strapped governments have been unable to address
such fundamental social problems as the vast gap between rich and
poor, the deep poverty of rural areas and city slums, widespread
malnutrition and high rates of infant mortality,'' the report said.
   President-elect Bush seems to be aware of the problems that the
$1.3 trillion debt burden is causing Third World countries. Since
his election, Bush has met with the presidents of Mexico and
Argentina and the incoming president of Venezuela _ all countries
where foreign debt is a major political and economic issue.
   Two days before release of the UNICEF report, Bush left the
impression that his administration is likely to ask commercial banks
to ease the debt burden of developing countries.
   Bush said the issue ``should be subject to a major review which
will include not just the Treasury but our national security people
because we've got enormous problems, particularly in our own
hemisphere, on Third World debt.''
   U.S. policy on the debt issue was spelled out in September 1985
by then Treasury Secretary and now Secretary of State-designate
James A. Baker III.
   His proposals for restoring growth in Latin America and elsewhere
call for a combination of economic reforms in the debtor countries
and new public and private lending to meet their capital needs.
   But, as the Inter-American Dialogue report points out, Latin
American governments have lost confidence in the Baker approach
because it has not produced the resources it promised.
   ``Many now see debt relief _ to reduce the region's financial
obligations and massive capital outflows _ as the only way for Latin
America to escape its economic bind,'' the report said.
   To UNICEF's Grant, the link between debt and child mortality is
obvious. He said that in 16 of the most debt-burdened countries, the
number of childhood deaths in the last 12 months is approximately
650,000 more than would have been the case if the 1970-80 rate of
decline in under-5 mortality had continued.

   Here is the text of the Interior Department's
policy statement supporting sales of federally provided water in the
West, together with the text of the 1986 draft of the policy.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   Primacy in water allocation and management decisions rests
principally with the states. Voluntary water transactions under this
policy must be in accordance with applicable state and federal laws.
   The Department of the Interior (DOI) will become involved in
facilitating a proposed voluntary water transaction only when it can
be accomplished without diminution of service to those parties
otherwise being served by such federal resources, and when:
   (a) there is an existing federal contractual or other legal
obligation associated with the water supply; or
   (b) there is an existing water right held by the federal
government that may be affected by the transaction; or
   (c) it is proposed to use federally owned storage or conveyance
capacity to facilitate the transaction; or
   (d) the proposed transaction will affect federal project
operations; and
   (e) the appropriate state, tribal, or other non-federal political
authorities or subdivisions request DOI's active involvement.
   DOI will participate in or approve transactions when there are no
adverse third-party consequences, or when such third-party
consequences will be heard and adjudicated in appropriate state
forums, or when such consequences will be mitigated to the
satisfaction of the affected parties.
   As a general rule, DOI's role will be to facilitate transactions
that are in accordance with applicable state and federal law and
proposed by others. In doing so, DOI will consider the positions of
the affected state, tribal, and local authorities. DOI will not
suggest a specific transaction except when it is part of an Indian
water rights settlement, a solution to a water rights controversy,
or when it may provide a dependable water supply the provision of
which otherwise would involve the expenditure of federal funds. Such
a suggestion would not be carried out without the concurrence of all
affected non-federal parties.
   The fact that the transaction may involve the use of water
supplies developed by federal water resource projects shall not be
considered during evaluation of a proposed transaction.
   One of DOI's objectives will be to ensure that the federal
government is in an acceptable financial, operational and
contractual position following accomplishment of a transaction under
this policy. Unless required explicitly by existing law, contracts
or regulations, DOI will refrain from burdening the transaction with
additional costs, fees or charges, except for those costs actually
incurred by DOI in performance of its functions in a particular
transaction.
   DOI will consider, in cooperation with appropriate state, tribal
and local authorities, necessary measures that may be required to
mitigate any adverse environmental impacts that may arise as a
result of the proposed transaction.

   Here is the 1986 statement that was never issued:
   Primacy in water allocation and management decisions relating to
voluntary exchanges of water is reaffirmed to rest with the states.
   Federal reclamation laws do not preclude support for and
implementation of a voluntary water exchange policy. When voluntary
water exchanges are proposed, they will be viewed in a positive
manner. If project authorizing legislation is in direct conflict,
changes in project authorizing legislation will be supported if
project purposes can be protected or changed to meet current
conditions while protecting or compensating third parties.
   The Bureau of Reclamation needs to become involved in
facilitating voluntary water exchanges only if: (a) there is an
existing federal contractual obligation associated with the water;
(b) there is a proposed use of federal storage-conveyance capacity;
(c) the proposed action will affect existing federal project
operations; or (d) the appropriate state or other non-federal
authority requests reclamation's active involvement.
   If existing water service or repayment contracts need to be
revised to comply with this policy and the proposed water exchange,
those changes will be made in a routine and expeditious manner,
provided such changes are consistent with federal reclamation law
and meet the policy requirements listed herein.
   While voluntary exchanges within state or within basin boundaries
will be more easily approved, exchanges involving a larger
geographic area also will be considered.
   Short-term and long-term water exchanges will be supported.
Short-term water exchanges are defined as having an exchange life of
no more than one year. The contractual obligations associated with
this water will remain with the entity currently responsible.
Long-term water exchanges are defined as having an exchange life of
more than one year. The contractual obligations associated with this
water may be transferred, through negotiated contracts, to the
responsible entity receiving the water. Any additional costs
associated with the transfer, including any power interference
charge, shall be advanced or repaid in a manner negotiated by the
parties involved.
   Exchanges may involve changes in type, location, or priority of
use. All exchanges must be in accordance with applicable state and
federal laws, including the protection of the water rights of those
who are not direct parties to the exchange.
   The United States' interest in project repayment will be fully
protected.

   ``Square 571'' is the name given by the
government to a 43,000-square-foot federal building that sits vacant
in the middle of the District of Columbia, footsteps away from a
homeless shelter which lately has been turning away 50 to 75 people
a night.
   A law passed in mid-1987 directed the federal government to make
its ``underutilized'' property available to the homeless, but Square
571 was beyond the grasp of homeless advocates.
   The reason: The federal government interpreted ``underutilized''
to mean partially occupied, not vacant.
   Under that reading of the law, only 12 of the U.S. government's
properties _ Uncle Sam owns 429,959 buildings and 727 million acres
of land _ were deemed suitable for the homeless.
   Of those, two _ a post office in Lynn, Mass., and an office
building in Bell, Calif. _ have actually been devoted to that
purpose since passage of the McKinney Homeless Assistance Act in
July 1987.
   These facts outrage homeless advocates, who have sued the
government to force it to make more of its underused and unused
properties available.
   On Sept. 30, U.S. District Judge Oliver Gasch ruled in the
advocates' favor, noting ``it's unreasonable to suggest that
Congress chose to lease to the homeless half-empty properties and
properties which are used part of the time, but no properties which
are wholly unoccupied.''
   ``Pitifully few of the numerous unused federal properties are
being evaluated for their suitability to assist the homeless,''
Gasch wrote in the decision. ``Those that are found to be suitable
are not being made available to homeless providers.''
   Gasch forbade the federal government from selling or transferring
any of its excess or surplus properties until it has complied with
the law.
   Currently, the government has 335 excess or surplus properties
ranging from a three-story federal office building in downtown
Providence, R.I., to a vacant school in Phoenix.
   Excess property is defined as that which isn't needed by the
government agency which controls it, while surplus property isn't
needed by any federal agency at all, according to Earl Jones,
commissioner of the General Services Administration's property
resources service. Normally, when a piece of federal property is
declared excess, it is turned in to the GSA, which can offer it to
other federal agencies or state or local governments, or sell it on
the open market, Jones said.
   Two months after Gasch's ruling, no more federal properties had
been leased to the homeless and the parties to the lawsuit went back
to court. The National Coalition for the Homeless asked for a
timetable for the government to comply, charging that the Department
of Housing and Urban Development was trying to stall.
   Gasch has given the government until Wednesday to review half its
335 surplus and excess properties to determine suitability for the
homeless, and until Jan. 12 to assess the other half. If it doesn't
finish on time, Gasch could find the government in contempt.
   Asked what the government had been doing in the two months since
the judge's initial ruling, James Stimson, the assistant on homeless
policy to the secretary of HUD, said officials were ``reviewing the
list'' and revising the criteria for deciding which properties would
be suitable for the homeless.
   ``There've been no major changes,'' he said. ``Some additional
factors were added recently.''
   Those factors were to allow for exclusions of properties in flood
plains or near hazardous or toxic waste sites or near explosive
materials, he said.
   ``I find that an example of exercise in the absurd, spending two
months to make that change,'' said Maria Foscarinis, attorney for
the National Coalition for the Homeless. ``They wasted over two
months, as far as I can tell.''
   Foscarinis said she believed the government was looking for ways
to exclude more of the properties on the list and was only prevented
from coming up with more loopholes because ``they were subjected to
very close scrutiny by a congressional committee and by us.''
   Stimson denied the allegation.
   Stimson said HUD had identified three properties on the list of
335 suitable for the homeless and two unsuitable. GSA had
recommended that HUD look at those particular properties because
they might fit the bill, Stimson admitted.
   Those that were deemed suitable were: the John Fogarty Federal
Building in Providence, which is partially occupied; a federal
building in Smithfield, N.C., which is fully occupied by the
Department of Agriculture; and about five acres of land known as the
Raritan Depot in New Jersey.
   Those that were excluded: a group of buildings at Fort Hayes in
Columbus, Ohio, because they are structurally unsound, and a former
missile testing site in Dade, Fla., because it's in a flood plain.
   Those recommendations have been sent back to the GSA, Stimson
said.

   President-elect Bush's Cabinet is all but
completed as he heads for Texas today to begin his annual
post-Christmas quail hunting trip at the 10,000-acre ranch of one of
his close friends.
   Bush intends to spend four days at the Lazy-F Ranch in Beeville,
Texas, returning Thursday after stopping over in Montgomery, Ala.,
for a couple of hours of fishing.
   The hunting trip _ a ritual Bush has followed for 20 years _
begins two days after Bush named his 13th Cabinet member, Elizabeth
Dole, as labor secretary. The surprise nomination means that only
two top-level jobs, energy secretary, and drug czar, both
Cabinet-level posts, remain open.
   Bush, who had earlier set a self-imposed Christmas deadline to
name his Cabinet, was unperturbed about the vacancies.
   ``I still think we're ahead of schedule,'' he said, predicting he
would fill the energy slot ``in a week or so.'' ``This one is a very
critical one ... because of the attention to some of the
nuclear-related problems. ... I am not going to be under the gun on
this last one to meet a timetable of some sort.''
   Among those mentioned for the energy post are Peter Johnson, the
former head of the Bonneville Power Administration in Portland,
Ore.; former Louisiana Rep. Henson Moore, and Lt. Gen. James
Abrahamson, head of the Strategic Defense Initiative operation at
the Pentagon.
   With the Cabinet just about complete, Bush said that when he
returns he'll start focusing on ``the first hundred days, on
legislative initiatives, on working with the secretaries-designate''
to come up with policies.
   The hunting trip, an all-male affair at the ranch owned by
Houston millionaire Will Farish, is a private excursion. Bush
brushed aside any criticism of the sport.
   Asked whether quail hunting was humane, Bush replied jokingly,
``The way I shoot it, it's very humane.''
   He also said there were ``some ferocious, aggressive birds there.
... If these birds, if they're not, as we call `harvested,' in the
conservation movement, why then there's an oversupply that results
in terrible famine and imbalance in nature. So I will try to
contribute to this ecological balance.''
   Mrs. Bush will remain in the nation's capital, packing up her
house for the move to the White House next month.
   On Sunday, Christmas Day, the couple, who are Episcopalian,
worshipped in a black Baptist church, and Bush pronounced the
service ``beautiful.'' Bush and his wife joined with obvious
enjoyment as the choir sang the ringing ``Hallelujah Chorus.''
   Jerry A. Moore, pastor of the church, said he extended the
invitation to Bush at a Christmas party in the vice president's
residence after Bush mentioned he would like to attend the service.
   ``We are delighted that you were able to share this spiritual
occasion with us,'' Moore said from the pulpit. ``May God be with
you and make your joys mount in his name.''
   Mrs. Bush told reporters that her present from the
president-elect ``was just what I asked for'' _ a computerized
dictionary.
   Asked what she gave her husband, Mrs. Bush replied: ``A big fat
kiss.''
   Bush's selection of Mrs. Dole, the first female to be named to a
full Cabinet post, was applauded by members of Congress and labor
leaders. Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., chairman of the Senate Labor
and Human Resources Committee, called Mrs. Dole ``an excellent
choice.''
   Mrs. Dole, 52, is the wife of Senate minority leader Bob Dole,
R-Kan., who waged an unsuccessful campaign against Bush for the GOP
presidential nomination last year.

<HEAD>Barry Reportedly in Hotel Room When Detectives Called Back From
Drug Probe</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Detectives were recalled from a planned
undercover drug buy from a former city employee in a hotel room
where Mayor Marion Barry also was present, according to a published
report today.
   The Washington Post said in its report that it was not
immediately able to determine who called the officers back or why.
   The detectives went to the hotel Thursday to investigate a
complaint from hotel officials that former city employee Charles
Lewis had offered drugs to a hotel maid. They left the hotel after
``somebody called them back downstairs,'' the Post reported, quoting
city government sources.
   An internal police investigation is under way in an effort to
determine whether Lewis was involved in any drug activity, how
police handled the complaint and why the mayor was at the hotel,
sources said. Barry is expected to be interviewed as part of the
probe.
   Traces of cocaine were discovered in the room at the hotel,
located in the northwest section of the city, and an unnamed
district source said Barry visited the hotel six times last week.
   But the chemical tests did not indicate whether the cocaine had
been in the room recently. Barry has denied any wrongdoing.
   ``I would never knowingly associate with anybody using drugs or
dealing with drugs,'' the mayor said through a spokesman. ``Under no
circumstances would I associate with anybody doing this.''
   The detectives who backed off from the undercover drug buy were
working out of the 3rd District under Deputy Chief Edward J.
Spurlock, sources told the Post. Assistant Chief Issac M. Fulwood
told officers that Spurlock offered to lie to reporters who called
him about the actions of the detectives, including stating falsely
that no detectives from his district responded to the hotel, the
paper reported.
   Spurlock told reporters Thursday night that he had no knowledge
of the situation.

<HEAD>Senator Says CIA Passenger, Alone, Would Not Have Prompted Attack</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The vice-chairman of the Senate Intelligence
Committee says the possible presence of a CIA operative on the Pan
Am jet that crashed last week probably would not, by itself, have
provoked a terrorist attack.
   Sen. William Cohen, R-Maine, said Sunday on ABC's ``This Week
With David Brinkley'' that he could not confirm whether the CIA
agent had been on the flight.
   But Cohen said that even if the agent had been aboard it would
not necessarily be significant because terrorists ``could have
eliminated him'' by direct assassination on the ground.
   ``I don't think you can draw any connection one way or another at
this point,'' Cohen said.
   The FBI's executive assistant director, Oliver Revell, on Sunday
denied earlier reports that the CIA's station chief in Beirut,
Lebanon, was aboard the Pan Am jumbo jet that crashed last week in
Scotland. He declined to say, however, whether any other CIA
operatives were on the plane.
   ``We cannot comment on intelligence community personnel, but I am
authorized to say that the station chief in Beirut was not on that
aircraft,'' he said in an interview with CBS Radio.
   Two government officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, had
said Saturday that the CIA's chief in Beirut was among the 258
people aboard the aircraft.
   Contacted again Sunday, one of the officials reiterated to The
Associated Press that the station chief, who has not been publicly
identified, had been a passenger on Pam Am Flight 103. Investigators
are viewing the crash as the possible result of sabotage.
   Revell was interviewed by CBS reporter Lesley Stahl following his
appearance with Stahl on the network's ``Face the Nation.'' There
was no discussion of this aspect of the crash on the television
program.
   In the post-program interview, Revell was asked whether any U.S.
government employee from Beirut had been aboard the ill-fated flight.
   ``Yes,'' he replied, ``the regional security officer from the
State Department was on the aircraft, unfortunately.''
   On Friday, the State Department said that three of its people
were on Flight 103: Matthew K. Gannon of Orange, Calif.; Ronald
Lariviere of Holyoke, Mass.; and Daniel E. O'Connor of Boston.
   Gannon was identified by the department as a political officer at
the U.S. Embassy in Beirut. The others were identified as security
officers _ Lariviere in Beirut, O'Connor in Nicosia, Cyprus.
   CIA agents frequently use embassy positions as covers for their
operations overseas.
   Revell said investigators are pursuing at least three possible
causes for the crash: a bomb planted by terrorists; a bomb placed
aboard by someone acting on a personal level wanting to kill a
particular passenger; and structural breakup of the aircraft.

   Noel Willman, who won a Tony Award for directing
the 1961 Broadway production of ``A Man for All Seasons,'' has died.
He was 70.
   Willman, whose home was in New York, died of a heart attack
Saturday.
   The Northern Ireland-born Willman first appeared on Broadway in
``Legend of Lovers'' in 1951. He played Lord Byron in the 1954 film
``Beau Brummell,'' which starred Elizabeth Taylor and Peter Ustinov.
   His reputation took off in 1961 when he directed ``A Man for All
Seasons'' in London and on Broadway. He said he turned to directing
on the advice of his mentor, Tyrone Guthrie.
   In 1962, Willman staged S.J. Perelman's ``The Beauty Part,''
featuring Bert Lahr. Four years later, he directed ``A Lion in
Winter'' with Robert Preston and Rosemary Harris on Broadway.
   Willman's directorial swan songs were two limited engagements by

   A torch singer who crooned at the
fanciest clubs of Paris and New York says she's never been happier
now that she's helping the down-and-out find food and shelter in
this industrial city.
   ``This is my home,'' Patricia Rainey said from her office at
Prospect House, a United Way agency founded by activist Abbie
Hoffman two decades ago to help minorities. ``I love this job
because I get a lot out of these people.''
   Rainey's stage talents are put to use presenting the agency's
work to 50 corporations yearly and helping an average 150 clients a
month with things like filling out tax forms and finding jobs.
   It wasn't an easy transition, says her boss and half-brother,
Paul, who lured her from New York a decade ago.
   ``Our clients come to us with eviction notices the day before
they're going to be evicted or for food the day before they run out
of food. They're always going to be at the bottom of the ladder,''
he said. ``Pat was just not prepared for that.''
   Rainey, 58, grew up in comfort in the 1930s. Her father, Julian
D. Rainey, was an attorney for the city of Boston and worked as
campaign manager for the minority vote on the presidential campaigns
of Franklin D. Roosevelt and Alfred E. Smith.
   While attending Boston and Northeastern universities, she sang in
clubs on weekends.
   ``I worked all the little joints and I was a beautiful thing,''
she said. ``I was also pretty gullible. I went for the `okeydokey'
all the time even though I didn't have to because people would have
hired me anyway. ... I always thought of myself as a second-class
citizen because I was black.''
   Her father encouraged her, even placing newspaper ads to promote
her appearances. And in the early 1950s she graduated to New York
nightclubs, where she met a man who introduced her to drugs.
   ``I didn't know he was a junkie,'' she said. ``He called somebody
and told him to bring him the works. I didn't even know what `works'
were. Then he was putting something in his arm and I said, `Well,
give me some, too. You're not going to leave me out.' ''
   Soon, she said, she was in jail for prostitution and her father
refused to bail her out: ``He let me rot in detention for a month.
He knew what he was doing.''
   She kicked her drug habit while in prison and went to Europe
after her release to sing in the Paris nightclub of fighter Sugar
Ray Robinson. Actress Simone Signoret was among those who saw her
sing. Signoret's recommendation to friends in London led to jobs
there at the Stork Room, the Embassy Club and Cafe de Paris.
   Also among Rainey's admirers was actress Ruth Gordon, whose
husband, Garson Kanin, gave her a part as a rich maid in a play that
starred Peter Sellers. The play flopped and Rainey moved to a Rome
nightclub, where she occasionally chatted between songs with King
Farouk of Egypt.
   All the time, however, her heart wasn't in the job.
   ``In actuality she was never interested in a singing career,''
said her brother, who managed her career briefly. ``She'd feign
interest because I was interested and my father was interested.''
   She left Europe to tend to her dying father in 1957.
   Eventually she wound up in New York, middle-aged, overweight and
depressed. Her brother persuaded her to move to Worcester.
   Like most Prospect House employees, Rainey first was a client,
seeking help with her taxes. She was one of only two dozen workers
when she joined the agency eight years ago. It has since grown to
235 employees.
   The talent that helped her attain success as a torch singer helps
her keep others from despair.
   ``When someone comes in, I try to make their day a little
brighter. They come in, you sit them down, give them a doughnut,
make them feel they're human,'' she said.

<HEAD>A Reworked `Legs Diamond' Battles Its Way To Broadway</HEAD>

   For nearly two months, ``Legs Diamond'' has been
the talk of Broadway, even though the lavish Peter Allen musical
hasn't officially opened. The conversation hasn't been encouraging.
   The show about the notorious New York gangster, played by Allen,
finally premieres tonight after endless previews, two postponements
and a major overhaul that its producers hope will save the $5
million musical.
   ``We just want to make it work,'' said Arthur Rubin, one of the
show's producers, a group that also includes the Nederlander theater
organization and New York Yankees owner George Steinbrenner. ``I
didn't care how many times we had to postpone. We would do it until
we got it right.''
   ``Getting it right'' has meant making drastic changes in front of
difficult, demanding New York audiences. Because of the show's
elaborate sets, the producers bypassed an out-of-town tryout in
favor of preview performances in New York. After all, Allen, who
also wrote the show's book and lyrics, had had successes in New York
with his revues on Broadway and at Radio City Music Hall.
   So much attention has focused on ``Legs Diamond'' because it is
the only musical of Broadway's meager fall season. That fact enabled
the show to accumulate a $10 million advance, mostly from theater
parties.
   ``Legs Diamond'' is also an American musical, a home-grown
product with a highly visible star and creator.
   The previews, which originally were slated to start Oct. 18 at
the Mark Hellinger Theater, were delayed a week because of technical
problems with the mammoth and complicated sets.
   The first preview ran more than three hours. Many theatergoers
walked out after the first act. It was a scene repeated during most
early previews.
   ``The audience reaction was not too great,'' Rubin recalled
diplomatically. ``There were a lot of things to fix.''
   ``I didn't need anybody to tell me,'' said director Robert Allan
Ackerman. ``I had a very clear picture of what was wrong.''
   The opening, scheduled for Dec. 1, was postponed first to Dec. 11
and then to Dec. 26.
   Once previews were under way, Ackerman developed what amounted to
a weekly game plan to improve the musical. He would meet with author
Harvey Fierstein, choreographer Alan Johnson, and Allen _ usually
after the Sunday matinee _ and decide what they wanted to accomplish
in terms of rewrites.
   On Monday, the company's day off, Fierstein and Ackerman would do
the rewrites. On Tuesday, the company would rehearse the new
material and as much as possible of it would go into the show that
night. On Wednesday, the company would play two shows. On Thursday,
the company would learn more new material and play it that night and
throughout the weekend. On Sunday, the cycle would begin again.
   ``The part that is the most frustrating is that invariably we
would know that on Tuesday we would be unraveling the whole thing
again,'' Ackerman said. ``But each change we did made the show
better. We could feel the show getting better and better.''
   The fix involved cutting some 45 minutes from the show,
eliminating characters, throwing out sets and songs and writing and
staging an entirely new opening number, ``When I Get My Name in
Lights,'' which features Allen atop a huge electric sign announcing
the show's title. The changes boosted production costs from $4.2
million to $5.1 million.
   Among the characters jettisoned were Legs Diamond's wife and
brother, played by Christine Andreas and Bob Stillman.
   ``Nobody was let go because they weren't doing a wonderful job,''
Ackerman said. ``I think the remarkable thing about this whole
process is that we have gone through what is regarded as the most
hellish thing you can live through in the theater _ the making of a
musical _ and there has been no animosity at all.''
   For Allen, the previews were incredibly difficult, Rubin said.
``There was a lot of pressure,'' the producer added. ``He was
performing, rehearsing, and trying to write a new song, all at the
same time.''
   Major changes were stopped a week ago to give the cast time to
play the same material.
   ``I hope we fixed it all,'' Ackerman said. ``I can tell you now
that the audience reaction is tremendous, and people are really
loving. But whether or not it will be a hit, I don't know.''

   The Earth influenced world events in 1988 more
than any man or woman, Time magazine said in naming it story of the
year.
   ``This year the Earth spoke, like God warning Noah of the
deluge,'' the weekly newsmagazine said in departing from its annual
Man of the Year designation.
   ``No single individual, no event, no movement captured
imaginations or dominated headlines more than the clump of rock and
soil and water and air that is our common home,'' it said, citing
natural and human-caused disasters like earthquakes, drought,
overpopulation, pollution of the world's beaches.
   Every year since 1927, Time's editors have selected a person,
group or object they believe most significantly influenced world
events that year. An inanimate object was chosen once before _ the
computer, in 1982.
   In the cover article of its Jan. 2 issue, released Saturday, Time
warned of a series of impending environmental catastrophes:
   _Pollution-caused warming of the atmosphere, known as the
``greenhouse effect,'' threatening weather changes that could flood
coastlines and render large areas of the planet infertile and
uninhabitable.
   _Toxic and radioactive wastes and dumped garbage that could
poison drinking water and despoil the land.
   _Chemical pollution that is depleting the atmosphere's protective
ozone layer.
   _Clearing of tropical rain forests, driving thousands of species
to extinction.
   ``Most of these evils had been going on for a long time, and some
of the worst disasters apparently had nothing to do with human
behavior,'' Time said. ``Yet this year's bout of freakish weather
and environmental horror stories seemed to act as a powerful
catalyst for worldwide public opinion.''
   Added Time: ``Now, more than ever, the world needs leaders who
can inspire their fellow citizens with a fiery sense of mission, not
a nationalistic or military campaign but a universal crusade to save
the planet.''

<HEAD>Woman was `Hatbox Baby' Found in Desert</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MESA, Ariz. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It wasn't until more than half a century later
that a retired aerospace worker learned she was the ``Hatbox Baby,''
a newborn found in a hatbox in the Arizona desert on Christmas Eve
1931.
   ``Everybody in my family knew the story except me,'' said Sharon
Elliott, who at age 57 still has the same red hair and blue eyes
that won so many hearts in 1931 when the story hit the newspapers.
   ``My mother didn't want me to find out. It was such a shock after
all these years _ I couldn't believe that during all that time it
had been kept from me,'' she said in an interview published Sunday
in The Mesa Tribune.
   The tale of the baby began when Edward and Julie Stewart were
making their way toward Phoenix. A puncture forced them to stop
along the dusty highway about 10 miles west of Superior.
   As Stewart repaired the tire, his wife heard a cry and then
beckoned her husband to venture with her into the desert stillness.
   A hundred yards from the road, they found a black pasteboard
hatbox with the lid fastened. Stewart kicked it, eliciting another
cry.
   The Stewarts opened the box, and inside they found an infant
about a week old, wrapped in flowered pajamas.
   Newspapers rejoiced in the incredible good fortune that led the
Stewarts to the ``hatbox baby,'' and they cooed over the red-haired,
blue-eyed waif who was eventually put up for adoption.
   Ms. Elliott, a retired aerospace worker who moved from California
to Mesa several months ago, learned she was the hatbox baby about
two years ago, shortly before her adoptive mother passed away.
   ``My daughter and son-in-law were being transferred to Mesa, and
my mother was afraid that somehow I would find out _ that somebody
would say something and I would get hurt. It was a big story in
those days, and for years the papers wrote about it every Christmas,
wondering whatever happened to that little baby.
   ``When she told me, I cried. She was the only mother I ever knew,
the only one I ever wanted. But now that she's gone, I'd like to
find out more.''
   Arizona newspapers followed the baby's story closely until she
was adopted in February 1932. Years later, newspapers and national
Sunday magazines repeatedly asked whatever became of the baby.
   ``She now is 30 years old and quietly beautiful, they say, a
woman of exceptional grace and purity living somewhere in Arizona,''
columnist Don Dedera wrote in The Arizona Republic, on Christmas
Day, 1961.
   Dedera wrote many more columns and stories about the baby, hoping
someday she might read one and come forward.
   ``It's such an intriguing little mystery, a wonderful story,''
Dedera, now a freelance writer, said in a recent interview. I always
had hoped I'd be able to wrap it up.''
   Ms. Elliott eventually went to The Mesa Tribune and identified
herself as the hatbox baby to see if reporters had any information
about who left her in the desert and why. But nothing about her
origin has surfaced.

<HEAD>Wyoming Lawmakers To Consider Lowering Drinking Age</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Earlier this year, Wyoming indignantly
became the last state in the nation to raise its legal drinking age
to 21. Next month the Legislature will be asked to display its rage
by lowering it back to 19.
   The request comes barely six months after the higher age limit
took effect and is seen by its sponsors as a way to defend the U.S.
Constitution and to rise up against federal blackmail.
   It also comes in the wake of a study showing that the
single-vehicle nighttime crash fatality rate among drivers ages 19
and 20 declined 38 percent in Tennessee in the 28 months after that
state raised its drinking age from 19 to 21.
   Wyoming raised its drinking age when faced with a federal mandate
that threatened loss of millions of dollars in highway funds.
   State Reps. H.L. Jensen and Dan Budd are sponsors of legislation
to repeal the 21-year-old limit.
   ``I think we disfranchised a segment of the population of the
state and I don't think it's done that much good in cutting down the
(traffic) fatalities,'' said Jensen.
   Added Budd: ``I feel the federal government violated the trust of
the (U.S.) Constitution and I think it's worth pursuing.''
   Budd in 1987 killed an attempt to raise the drinking age by
pocketing the proposed legislation when it reached the House
Transportation Committee, which he chairs.
   ``Certainly they can withhold the money,'' Budd said. ``They
blackmailed the state of Wyoming. But I guess if you sell out, if
that's the only thing you're looking at, then the Constitution has
no meaning. We don't need a constitution, we'll base everything on
money.''
   State Highway Department officials say it could cost Wyoming
$12.3 million in federal funding in fiscal 1990 if the Legislature
lowers the age limit.
   In a study published in Friday's Journal of the American Medical
Association, Dr. Michael Decker of Vanderbilt University School of
Medicine said raising the drinking age to 21 had ``a dramatic,
immediate and lasting effect on the number of fatalities of 19- and
20-year-olds.''
   Tom Fanter of the Wyoming Highway Department's safety branch said
that in 1987 the state had 53 alcohol-related accidents involving
fatalities. Of those 11, or nearly 21 percent, involved motorists
under age 21 who had been drinking. Eight of those 11 accidents
involved 19- and 20-year-olds, he said.
   In the first 10 months of 1988 there were 48 fatal accidents
involving alcohol and 13 of those, or 27 percent, involved motorists
under age 21, said Fanter. Of the 13, nine occurred after the higher
drinking age took effect July 1 and seven involved 19-and
20-year-olds.
   ``This shows me we still need enforcement,'' he said.
   Jensen said the Vanderbilt study was ``like comparing apples to
oranges. That's interesting for Tennessee, but I don't think it has
any bearing on Wyoming,'' he said, adding that factors such as law
enforcement affect fatality rates.
   In Wyoming, increasing the age limit ``didn't accomplish the
purpose of keeping the alcohol from 19 and 20 years old, if that's
what they wanted to do,'' said Jensen.
   Gov. Mike Sullivan initially opposed increasing the drinking age
but is disappointed by the attempt to lower the limit.
   ``That's one of the silliest ideas I've heard in a long time,''
Sullivan said. ``It doesn't seem to me to be particularly
constructive. We went through a large battle to get where we are.
... I said last year I didn't think we should be an island in the
U.S. on that and my mind hasn't changed any.''

<TEXT>
   President-elect Bush's choice to lead the
Defense Department says an emphasis on weapons systems that depend
on fewer people may help the Pentagon meet its needs in a time of
budgetary constraint.
   ``The big cost is not in the B-2 (bomber), the B-1 and the
aircraft carriers,'' former Texas Sen. John Tower said Sunday. ``The
big cost is not in the hardware, the big cost is in personnel.''
   Tower, Bush's designated defense secretary, said one of his first
priorities would be devising a strategy to achieve national
objectives for defense.
   ``Then we have to look at the roles and missions of all our
forces and see where they fit into that strategy,'' he said on the
CBS-TV program ``Face the Nation.''
   Programs that don't fit, Tower said, ``get low priority and they
get cut. And hopefully, by going to less manpower-intensive systems
we can make some economies.''
   Tower was long rumored as Bush's choice for defense secretary but
the announcement was delayed for several weeks as the FBI conducted
an exhaustive background check of the former senator, known for his
pro-defense positions while in the Congress.
   ``I discovered much to my dismay that not everybody loves me,''
Tower said when asked about the lengthy review, fueled in part by
accusations made by his ex-wife.
   Of reports that he sometimes drank to excess, Tower said he only
drank in moderation. ``I'm only a wine drinker,'' he said. ``I don't
drink spirits.''

   Five inmates arrested in the assault that
quelled a prison riot have been listed among 23 people killed in the
uprising, but state officials said they do not know how the
prisoners died.
   The five inmates were videotaped while in custody by an NBC
television crew and were only later reported as fatalities, raising
the possibility they were killed in custody.
   ``I don't know what to say,'' Ernesto Medina, assistant director
of criminal investigations for the state of Nayarit, said in a
telephone interview on Sunday. ``I don't know anything about that.''
   The five had been reported killed in the shootout that ended the
two-day revolt, but a hostage told The Associated Press that they
had surrendered.
   Prison officials said the death toll during the uprising was 23,
including the warden and a police commander. Nineteen deaths were
described as occurring Friday night during what the officials said
were two assaults by police.
   The government news agency Notimex said some of the prisoners
suffered up to 10 bullet wounds.
   The NBC videotape reviewed by the AP shows at least 13 prisoners
outside the prison being questioned by police. Five can be heard
giving their names; those names are on a list of dead later given to
the AP by officials.
   A witness who spoke on condition his name not be used said the
inmates were taken back into the prison after they were questioned
and that after that, more gunshots were heard.
   And Brenda Margarita Rubio Gonzalez, who had been held hostage,
told the AP on Sunday that she was freed hours before what officials
said was the final, guns-blazing assault.
   ``They (the prisoners) surrendered,'' said Ms. Rubio, a prison
records clerk.
   Medina said he could not explain how the inmates could have died
after interrogation. He said the prisoners were dead when he himself
arrived at the prison Friday night.
   State judicial police Cmdr. Sergio Anzaldo maintained Sunday that
most of the deaths occurred during a second assault on the prison
offices at about 11 p.m. Friday night.
   ``Even I don't understand this,'' Anzaldo said when asked how
those now listed among the dead could have been taped while in
custody hours earlier. He said he would investigate further.
   Efforts to reach other state and federal officials by telephone
for comment were unsuccessful on Sunday.
   The uprising at the prison in the Nayarit state capital of Tepic,
500 miles northwest of Mexico City, began Thursday with a mutiny by
prisoners angry that they had been denied Christmas pardons. The
prison warden was killed then, officials said.
   The Venustiano Carranza prison was surrounded and two special
police teams, the Fox and Scorpion squads, were flown in from Mexico
City.
   According to the official version of events Friday night, the
commander of the Fox squad, Jorge Armando Duarte Badillo, was shot
to death by the rioting prisoners while trying to talk them into
surrendering.
   Officials said the commando teams then launched an assault at
about 6 p.m. Friday that was repulsed, and launched another attack
at 11 p.m. that retook the prison administration area and freed 19
hostages.
   However, NBC producer Oscar I. Delgado said a network crew
videotaped prisoners in custody at about 8:30 p.m. Friday. The
prisoners had been brought into a park outside the prison, Delgado
said.
   Ms. Rubio said only one prisoner was in the room with her and
other hostages, and he walked out with his hands raised at about 6
p.m.
   Questioned Sunday about the discrepancies, Medina said there was
only one assault, ``but it lasted a long time.'' Anzaldo maintained
there were two assaults.
   The death toll was given Friday night as six, but on Saturday
morning jumped to 22, then 24. The official toll is now set at 23,
Medina said Sunday, 21 of them prisoners.
   The videotape shows at least two of the prisoners apparently
injured, but all were alive, lifting their heads to look at the
camera or answering questions from police.
   Sometimes an officer could be seen kicking or poking a prisoner,
asking for confirmation or repetition of a name. Five prisoners can
be heard giving their complete names: Benjamin Gambero Anzaldo, Jose
Luis Parra Leyva, Arturo Torres Casillas, Ricardo Hermosillo Guzman,
and Enedino de la Cruz Simon.
   All five are on a list of dead provided Saturday by state
spokesman Francisco Flores and confirmed on Sunday by Medina.
   The witness who spoke on condition of anonymity said gunshots
were heard shortly after the prisoners and members of the Fox group
also re-entered the prison.
   Anzaldo said six captured prisoners and seven guards suspected of
collaboration were in custody. Medina said authorities were
searching for two men who reportedly smuggled guns into the prison
by posing as lawyers.

<HEAD>Americans Celebrate Christmas With Joy, Charity And Remembrance Of
Tragedy</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL HIRSH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   San Francisco and Las Vegas enjoyed a rare white Christmas while
New York and Boston were left dry, as millions of Americans
celebrated a holiday of joy and homecoming tinged with the
remembrance of tragedy near and far.
   For many, the day after Christmas meant relaxing amid shucked
gift wrappings and turkey leftovers, but for the less fortunate
today was a return to the streets or lonely prison life after an
interlude of charity from fellow Americans.
   ``The giving spirit is definitely at a high,'' said Philip
Bascom, a worker at the Greater Bangor Area Shelter for the homeless
in Maine. ``I think people are more sympathetic on Christmas.''
   And a great deal of sympathy was needed this year, many
volunteers said.
   ``There are just so many more'' homeless people, worker Joe
Ferguson said at the Atlantic City (N.J.) Rescue Mission, where
about 250 people gathered Sunday for ham and turkey. ``It's been a
bad year.''
   ``We've never had this many people,'' said Ken Kruger, who runs
the Volunteers of America residence in New York City. ``Last year,
we finished serving at 2 p.m.''
   Toward evening, a line of homeless people was still three-deep
around the block.
   At New York's St. Patrick's Cathedral, Cardinal John O'Connor led
prayers in remembrance of the 258 people aboard Pan Am Flight 103
who were killed when the jet crashed Wednesday in Scotland.
   O'Connor said the faith of the families of plane crash victims
was heartening.
   ``Thinking that I would console or encourage them,'' he said, ``I
found my own faith deepened instead, by their acceptance of
suffering, their willingness to let whatever happens in this world
happen, and to know that God still loves them very deeply.''
   Not all churches were bedecked with boughs of holly or other
tokens of Christmas green and red. In snowless Massachusetts,
wreaths in Armenian churches were wrapped in black in memory of the
55,000 people believed killed by a Dec. 7 earthquake in Soviet
Armenia.
   Doctors and nurses from Portland, Ore., who rushed to Armenia
following the quake returned home Christmas Eve, saying they found
the real meaning of Christmas in the hearts of the victims.
   ``The Armenians, despite the death and destruction within their
lives, were magnificent and totally devoted to us and other
foreigners who came to help them,'' said Northwest Medical Teams
founder Ron Post.
   In Hayward, Calif., Santa Claus suffered a setback when thieves
stole more than $2,000 worth of Christmas toys bought by
firefighters for needy children. But people who heard of the theft
brought bikes, soccer balls, puzzles, games and other toys to the
firehouse.
   ``We have received probably three or four times the toys that we
started with,'' said Capt. Bruce Jones. ``We just can't even express
our gratitude to the people that came in.''
   A more permanent loss struck a family in northern Indiana, when
six family members and a fiancee were killed in a traffic accident
en route to a Christmas Eve celebration.
   ``It was a shocker,'' said Linda Fort, the sister-in-law of Laura
Cites, one of the victims. ``It just couldn't be worse. People are
giving this time of year, but this really puts a damper on
everything. It's still the Lord's birthday. And she is with the
Lord. ... That gives us a lot of comfort.''
   A setback also was suffered by members of the 70-year-old United
Methodist Church in Ware Shoals, S.C., which was destroyed by fire
Sunday hours after Christmas Day services concluded in the landmark
building.
   The fire was believed to have originated in the electrical system.
   Christmas Day in Georgia meant a feast for 30,000 needy people in
Atlanta and peace and quiet after a Christmas Eve riot at the Hall
County Jail.
   ``They were disgruntled,'' said Sheriff's Sgt. Ed Barfield.
``It's overcrowded here, we've got them one on top of another. It's
Christmas.''
   While the East Coast was dry, frosty yuletide temperatures led to
Christmas Day snow flurries that dusted Las Vegas, San Francisco and
low-lying Southern California foothills. Drifts made higher mountain
regions impassable.
   Snow closed Interstate 5 for several hours Sunday night at Tejon
Pass north of Los Angeles, a major artery linking the north and
south.
   It was the first Christmas Day snowfall in Las Vegas since the
National Weather Service started keeping records there in 1937,
officials said.
   Snow also fell in Utah, Colorado, Idaho, Montana and Wyoming.
Light snow fell in parts of New York state and Michigan.

<HEAD>Pope's Christmas Wish: A Cure For AIDS</HEAD>
<HEAD>With PM-World Christmas, Bjt</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARY BETH SHERIDAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Pope John Paul II made his most extensive
comment yet about AIDS in his annual holiday message, saying his
Christmas wish is that ``science and love'' will find a cure for the
deadly disease.
   The white-robed pontiff, speaking from the balcony over the main
entrance to St. Peter's Basilica, appealed for help for AIDS
sufferers and for help for survivors of the devastating earthquake
in Soviet Armenia.
   ``Let forces be joined and efforts be increased to help those in
need, with whom Christ himself wished to identify himself,'' said
the leader of the world's 850 million Roman Catholics.
   The pope, wearing a glittering gold miter and carrying a staff
topped by a cross, said Sunday that the beauty of Christmas lies in
the fact God sent his son as a poor person.
   ``The poor under every label, old and new, have a place in the
mystery of Christmas: those suffering and dying of hunger, the
rejected, the disinherited, refugees, the victims of hatred, of
wars, of natural disasters,'' he said in Italian.
   John Paul II devoted several minutes of his address to those
suffering from illnesses, including aquired immune deficiency
syndrome.
   ``I think of them all, and to all of them I say: do not lose
hope,'' the Polish-born pope said. ``These words are addressed above
all to the victims of AIDS, called to face the challenge not only of
the sickness but also the mistrust of a fearful society that
instinctively turns away from them.
   ``I invite everyone to take up the tragic burden of these
brethren of ours, and, as I assure them of my deep affection, I
exhort scientists and researchers to increase their efforts to find
an effective treatment for this mysterious illness,'' he said.
   ``May the concerted efforts of science and love soon find the
hoped-for remedy: this is the hope that I lay at the crib of the
newborn savior.''
   About 70,000 people who packed St. Peter's Square under sunny
skies listened quietly to the traditional message. Different groups
burst into applause when the pope, in his conclusion, offered
Christmas greetings in 44 languages.
   The address was broadcast directly to 15 countries, including the
Soviet Union for the first time. It was shown on television later or
in partial form in 35 other nations.
   The speech marked one of the few occasions on which the
68-year-old pontiff has discussed AIDS. He first publicly addressed
the issue during a 1987 visit to San Francisco in which he told AIDS
sufferers that ``God loves you all without distinction.''
   He also expressed sympathy for AIDS victims earlier this month,
saying the church must consider them ``brothers and sisters.''
   In a major statement on AIDS earlier this year, the Vatican
newspaper L'Osservatore Romano said that the spread of the disease
must be arrested and people must ``overcome ethically aberrant
behaviors.''
   It said that sexual permissiveness was the true cause of the
problem.
   AIDS is caused by a virus that damages the body's immune system,
leaving victims susceptible to infections and cancer. It is spread
most often through sexual contact, needles or syringes shared by
drug abusers, infected blood or blood products, and from pregnant
women to their offspring.
   The Vatican condemns homosexuality and the use of artificial
birth control. It has criticized campaigns advocating condoms to
stop the spread of AIDS.
   The pontiff gave Sunday's address after saying Mass in St.
Peter's for about 8,000 people, ranging from diplomats to the Holy
See in black morning coats to tourists in blue jeans.
   Earlier, he celebrated midnight Mass before thousands of people
in the Basilica.

   A 17-car Amtrak train with more
than 300 people aboard derailed Sunday night during a snowstorm in a
rugged, mountainous canyon, but no injuries were reported,
authorities said.
   The two locomotives and 15 cars went off the track just after 9
p.m. in Glenwood Canyon, said the chief dispatcher's office at the
Rio Grande Railroad in Denver, about 150 miles east of here.
   The train, which had 294 passengers and about 15 crew members,
was en route to Salt Lake City from Denver, John Jacobsen, Amtrak's
director of public affairs, said early Monday from his home in
Washington, D.C.
   ``The cause of the derailment is not known at this time, but all
cars are reported to be upright and in line. We have no reports of
injuries to passengers,'' Jacobsen said.
   ``At this point it doesn't seem to be a serious derailment in
terms of injuries to passengers,'' he said, but a ``complicated
logistics problem.''
   A train headed to the scene to transport the people the 10 miles
to Glenwood Springs, where they would be put up in hotels for the
night.
   Jacobsen said Rio Grande Railroad, which owns the tracks, will
investigate the accident.

   The dollar inched down aginst the Japanese yen on
Monday, while share prices advanced on the Tokyo Stock Exchange.
   The dollar closed at 124.72 yen, down 0.23 yen from Friday's
close of 124.95 yen. After opening at 124.85 yen, the currency
ranged between 124.63 yen and 124.90 yen.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues, which gained
0.10 points during its half-day session Saturday, added another
181.65 points, or 0.61 percent, closing at 29,868.01.
   Trading was thin, but market players showed interest in
high-priced issues such as finances, which can influence the index
even if the number of shares changing hands is small, said a dealer
with Daiwa Securities.
   ``The majority of dealers were sitting on the sidelines because
they feel safer getting rid of shares before the year-end and New
Year holidays and because of uncertainties including the emperor's
condition,'' he said.
   Markets will close when Emperor Hirohito dies. Christmas Day
marked his 63rd year on the Chrysanthemum Throne, but the
87-year-old monarch has been in serious condition with internal
hemorrhaging for more than three months.
   Traders are also reluctant to make major moves in a shortened
trading week. Because of the New Year's holiday, the stock market
will be open for two full-day sessions and one half-day session this
week.
   Trading on the currency exchange was slow, reflecting the
Christmas holiday lull on overseas markets.
   ``Market players could not decide on trading tactics today
without knowing trends on overseas markets,'' said a dealer at
Mitsubishi Bank.

   A North American robin believed to have flown
across the Atlantic Ocean and Scotland was drawing hundreds of
birdwatchers to the Scottish east coast on Monday.
   The rare visitor, which is not known to breed in Europe, was
spotted hopping around in seafront gardens at Inverbervie, 36 miles
northeast of Dundee, and was reported on Christmas Day on
``Birdline,'' a telephone information service about birds.
   British birdwatchers, known as twitchers, are celebrated for
dashing anywhere in the country to see, record and photograph rare
birds.
   The little olive-brown robin with a red breast, familiar in
Britain and the rest of Europe, is a favorite image on Christmas
cards.
   The North American robin is almost twice the size of its European
cousin and has gray-brown upperparts and a brick-red breast and
upper belly.
   The Royal Society for the Protection of Birds said the visitor
may have been blown across the Atlantic by a fierce westerly gale in
recent days.

   The following are excerpts from the Vatican's
official English translation of Pope John Paul II's annual Christmas
message, delivered on Sunday from the balcony of St. Peter's
Basilica:
   ``How beautiful upon the mountains are the feet of him who brings
good tidings (Is. 52:7).
   ``How beautiful is Christmas. Yet, it is filled with human
misery. It bears the mark of a closed door, when Joseph and Mary
sought refuge in the inn. It bears the mark of people's indifference
to others _ the first sign of the hardened hearts which the
Messenger of good tidings will confront, not only in the days of his
earthly life, but in every generation. And precisely _ because of
all this _ Christmas is beautiful...
   ``Eyes enlightened by faith discover the attraction of the
Mystery of God under the veil of poverty and neglect...
   ``The Church prolongs the mystery of the Incarnation of the Word
and proclaims the news of salvation to the farthest ends of the
earth, today as yesterday. She carries forward the first and second
evangelization to fulfill the expectations that man bears in
himself. Today I greet this missionary Church: I greet and encourage
the priests, the men and women religious, the catechists, doctors,
nurses, teachers, technicians...
   ``The poor under every label, old and new, have a place in the
mystery of Christmas: those suffering and dying of hunger, the
rejected, the disinherited, refugees, the victims of hatred, of
wars, of natural disasters. In a special way I am thinking of those
who have been affected by the terrible earthquake in Armenia, and
are now mourning their loved ones buried under the debris, keeping
anxious watch at the bedside of the injured in the hospitals, or
struggling against the cold and the bad weather, without a roof
under which to seek shelter for themselves and their children. In
this tragic hour, may they experience the understanding and support
of people of good will. May the world see an increase of the
generous reaction which has mobilized governments, organizations and
individuals in a wonderful chain of solidarity, and with everyone's
help may the work of reconstruction begin so that hope may spring
again in that sorely afflicted region...
   ``My thoughts also go to those who are lacking in that precious
gift that is good health, to all those who are affected by illness,
and struggle with it in hospital wards, clinics or their own homes.
I think of them all, and to all of them I say: do not lose hope.
These words are addressed above all to the victims of AIDS, called
to face the challenge not only of the sickness but also the mistrust
of a fearful society that instinctively turns away from them. I
invite everyone to take up the tragic burden of these brethren of
ours, and, as I assure them of my deep affection, I exhort
scientists and researchers to increase their efforts to find an
effective treatment for this mysterious illness. May the concerted
efforts of science and love soon find the hoped-for remedy: this is
the hope that I lay at the crib of the newborn Savior.''

<DATELINE>TUNIS, Tunisia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The PLO maintains a discreet presence in
Tunisia, where Yasser Arafat has made his headquarters. A head
without a body, it is 1,500 miles from the land Arafat seeks for an
independent Palestinian state.
   There are no office complexes, residential compounds or guerrilla
training camps, no obvious signs of the Palestine Liberation
Organization.
   As one Western diplomat put it, ``There's no swagger about it.''
   In fact, the organization's offices are not easy to find.
   The PLO's presence consists of several political offices in
inconspicuous houses scattered around the city, a few dozen
officials and a total Palestinian population of about 1,000.
   Arafat is often away, seeking international support for a
Palestinian state in Israeli-occupied land with a peace initiative
that this month succeeded in engaging the United States in dialogue.
   Compared to the 3 million Palestinians living in Jordan and the
occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip, the PLO presence in Tunis is
miniscule.
   ``Tunis is not home really,'' said Khaled Bahig, who works in the
PLO's information department. ``It's very far from our people. It's
not like Lebanon, Jordan or Syria. Here we are just working in our
offices. We are not really working among the Palestinian people. But
from the political point of view, we have a lot to do.''
   The PLO moved its headquarters to Tunis in August 1982 after
being driven out of Beirut by the Israeli invasion of Lebanon.
Tunisia's president at the time, Habib Bourgiba, had always been a
staunch supporter of the Palestinian movement.
   The more than 1,000 PLO fighters who came here from Lebanon were
temporarily stationed at a camp in the hills west of Tunis. The camp
was closed in 1985 and the fighters moved on to Iraq, Algeria,
Sudan, North and South Yemen and Lebanon. The PLO says it no longer
maintains a military presence here.
   Part of the reason for the PLO low profile in Tunis is the threat
from its enemies.
   In October 1985, Israeli jets streaked across the Mediterranean
and bombed Arafat's residence, administrative office and the homes
of several PLO officials in the seaside suburb of Hamam Plage,
killing at least 61 Palestinians and 12 Tunisians.
   The PLO still maintains a small administrative office in a
rundown building at the site, located on a gravel road marked by a
blue sign ``Avenue of the Martyrs of Oct. 1, 1985.''
   In April, PLO military commander Khalil Wazir, also known as Abu
Jihad, was assassinated in his home near Carthage. The PLO blamed
Israel's Mossad secret service and Israeli officials privately
acknowledged responsibility.
   Today, the house is shuttered. Two posters of Wazir are pasted on
the front door and a Palestinian flag is taped to a window on the
second floor.
   Tunis is more of a rest stop than a permanent base for the PLO
top brass.
   Arafat is constantly on the move. When he does stop in Tunis, it
is usually for a short time and his whereabouts are secret. It is
said that he never sleeps in the same bed twice for fear of
assassination by Israeli agents or radical Palestinians opponents.
   Still, Tunis serves as a type of proxy PLO capital and it is
where the United States has, through Ambassador Robert H. Pelletreau
Jr., begun talking with the organization. The first talks on Dec. 16
ended a 13-year ban on official U.S. contact with the PLO.
   The move came after Arafat met U.S. criteria for talks by
renouncing terrorism and recognizing Israel's right to exist.
   The U.S.-PLO talks were arranged through the PLO's political
department, the headquarters of Farouk Kaddoumi, often referred to
as its foreign minister.
   The department is located in a white two-story house in a new
neighborhood on the city's outskirts. A visitor wouldn't notice it,
but for the presence of two Tunisian security guards with machine
guns or the Mercedes of a visiting ambassador parked in front.
   Inside, the walls are lined with posters hailing Palestinians'
yearlong uprising in the West Bank and Gaza.
   A few hundred yards away on an unpaved, dead-end side street that
Tunisian taxi drivers often have difficulty finding is the PLO's
information department, a simple house that serves as the office of
PLO spokesman Ahmed Rahman.
   The PLO in Tunis also maintains departments of social affairs and
education, the news agency WAFA and a school for 400 Palestinian
children.
   ``Most of the Palestinians live together,'' said Ribhi Awad, an
assistant to Kaddoumi. ``You can find 10 families in one building.
But they also mix in Tunisian life. The Tunisian people have been
very sympathetic to our cause.''

10,000-acre spread in ``God's country'' is a favorite hunting spot
of President-elect Bush.
   The president-elect today was to begin a four-day visit to Will
Farish's Lazy F Ranch. For the past 20 Christmas seasons, Bush has
retreated there to tote a shotgun through the South Texas mesquite
in search of quail and other game birds.
   Nobody paid much attention until the vice president became the
president-elect. And some in this town of 15,000 are applauding the
change.
   ``It would bring a lot of tourists to town,'' said Janice Porter,
manager of the Beeville Chamber of Commerce. ``It would do a lot for
Beeville.''
   ``He hunts in a rough place, really, but he calls it `God's
country,''' said City Manager Jose Montez. ``I'm sure that if he
keeps coming here, we will receive some national exposure.''
   Beeville, 65 miles northwest of Corpus Christi, last saw a
president when William Howard Taft stopped by to make a whistlestop
speech in the early 1900s.
   Bush aides said the vice president would arrive and depart on Air
Force Two at the nearby Chase Field Naval Air Station, Bee County's
largest employer, with 551 civilian employees and 1,286 military
personnel.
   Downtown streets around the red-domed courthouse were being
spruced up for Bush.
   Beeville has a 2,500-student college, a two-screen movie theater,
a 12-lane bowling alley, three banks, two radio stations and just
125 motel and hotel rooms.
   It was founded in 1835 by Irish settlers and named after Bernard
E. Bee, who served in the government of the Republic of Texas, which
lasted from 1836 until Texas joined the union in 1845.
   Recently, Beeville's economy has suffered from the drop in oil
prices and lean years for farmers and ranchers. As with many other
small cities, big discount department stores on the outskirts of
town have put a squeeze on the downtown business district, where the
city has begun a $450,000 revitalization project.
   Susan Stasny, who in 1986 was elected Bee County's first
Republican county commissioner, met Bush during one of his hunting
trips. She said having a president visit occasionally would boost
the status of the city and county.
   Farish, a Houston millionaire whose ranch is just outside town,
is a longtime Bush friend whose company manages Bush's investments
through a blind trust.

   In Christmas messages, world and spiritual leaders urged a new
surge of generosity to help heal the wounds of people whose lives
have been shattered by the Armenian earthquake, the Pan Am crash in
Scotland and the AIDS plague.
   ``Our hearts and prayers go out to those who have been injured
and bereaved and it is my hope that the eternal message of Christmas
will bring some comfort in the hour of sadness,'' Queen Elizabeth II
said in an unprecedented update of her annual Christmas message.
   In Bethlehem, the hilltop town in the Israeli-occupied West Bank
where Jesus was born, steady rain and the yearlong Palestinian
uprising dissuaded crowds of pilgrims from celebrating Sunday's
holiday.
   Several hundred people chanted Mass in the Church of the Nativity
while Israeli soldiers chased stone-throwing youths in the town's
streets. In the occupied lands, one Palestinian was killed and 16
were reported wounded in clashes with Israeli troops. Arab reports
said a second Palestinian died of wounds suffered in an earlier
clash.
   Despite the violence, tourists said they still were glad they
came to Bethlehem.
   ``We are excited to be here, to see the places we have read about
from childhood through Sunday school and Bible studies,'' said
Charles W. Fleming, director of the Shiloh Baptist Church Senior
Choir from Washington.
   Pope John Paul II set the tone of compassion for the holiday in
offering his Christmas wish: that ``science and love'' would find a
cure for the deadly scourge of AIDS.
   ``I invite everyone to take up the tragic burden of these
brethren of ours, and, as I assure them of my deep affection, I
exhort scientists and researchers to increase their efforts to find
an effective treatment for this mysterious illness,'' the pope said
at Vatican City.
   Speaking to about 70,000 people in St. Peter's Square, the Roman
Catholic leader also appealed for help for survivors of the
earthquake that rocked Soviet Armenia on Dec. 7, killing an
estimated 55,000 people.
   In Armenia, President-elect Bush's son, John, and grandson,
George, toured the disaster area and passed out candy bars and games
to injured children at a hospital.
   George, 12, said the Christmas visit was ``better than just
sitting at home and opening presents.''
   In Lockerbie, Britain, where Pan Am Flight 103 crashed on
Wednesday night, Christmas services were tinged with grief as
relatives of the dead and soldiers still muddy from searching the
wreckage joined townspeople in holiday prayers.
   ``Father, if you're the God of love why did you let this
happen?,'' asked the Rev. Maurice Taylor at the town's Holy Trinity
Catholic church. ``Why did you allow the destruction of hundreds of
innocent lives?''
   The leader of the Church of England, Archbishop of Canterbury
Robert Runcie, said in his Christmas sermon that the string of
tragedies had a positive side: ``a new surge of generosity, new
signs of a readiness to give and receive; a new touching of the
hearts of men and women towards those whose world they share.''
   Iran's prime minister, Hussein Musavi, issued Yuletide greetings
to Iran's 400,000 Christians and those in the rest of the world,
urging believers to ``strive to remedy the pains of the modern
world.''
   In South Africa, the family of Nelson Mandela made a brief visit
to the jailed black leader, who spent his 27th consecutive Christmas
in prison.
   In West Germany, Joseph Werner of Setauket, N.Y., spent Christmas
Eve in a solitary vigil on the western side of the Berlin Wall,
distributing small black paper flags in what he said was a protest
against the forced division of many German families.
   Not all celebrations were subdued. In Wales, 72-year-old Ted Nash
raised a glass to herald the birth of his third great-granddaughter
to be born on Christmas Day.
   ``Helen really didn't fancy going to hospital on Christmas Day,''
said the slightly jaded Nash of the new mother. ``But there wasn't
really much she could do about it.''
   ``Luckily it was a very quick birth,'' Nash said.

   A family was opening Christmas presents when a
somber police officer showed up at the door with shocking news: six
relatives and a fiancee had been killed in a traffic accident while
on their way to the home.
   ``It was total chaos,'' said Mazel McCarty of Knox, the
great-aunt of one of the victims, 6-year-old Crystal Davis. ``It was
unreal when they told us about the accident. ... We're so
devastated. We all feel we'll wake up any minute. It's just a
nightmare.''
   Six members of the Davis family and the fiancee of one of them
were killed Saturday when their westbound car veered into the path
of an eastbound dump truck two miles southwest of this northern
Indiana town, authorities said.
   Driver Floyd Davis, 25, of Knox, had tried to avoid a car that
had slowed down to make a turn, police said.
   The victims were pronounced dead at the scene, which was littered
with Christmas presents. The driver of the truck was not seriously
hurt.
   In addition to Davis and his stepdaughter Crystal, the dead were
identified as Davis' wife, Rosalind Davis, 23; his 17-year-old
brother Jesse; his mother, Gloria, 46; his 3-year-old stepson, Carl
James Davis; and Laura Cites, 25, Jesse Davis' fiancee.
   Weather was not believed to be a factor in the crash, authorities
said.
   The family was on their way to celebrate Christmas Eve at a
relative's home near North Judson, said Starke County Coroner
Douglas E. O'Donnell.
   ``It just couldn't be worse, Cites' sister-in-law Linda Fort said
Sunday. ``People are giving this time of year, but this really puts
a damper on everything. It's still the Lord's birthday. And she is
with the Lord. That's good. That gives us a lot of comfort.''

   Christian pilgrims celebrated a subdued
Christmas in Bethlehem under heavy guard, and one Palestinian was
killed and 16 were reported wounded in clashes with troops elsewhere
in the occupied lands.
   The army said two people were wounded Sunday.
   In the hilltop town where Jesus was born, most shops were closed
in solidarity with the yearlong Palestinian uprising and only a few
colored lights hung from the municipality's Christmas tree.
   Police and soldiers inspected cars for weapons.
   As pilgrims chanted mass in the Church of the Nativity off Manger
Square, about 50 soldiers chased a group of stone-throwing youths
outside. The protesters shouted ``with blood and soul we will redeem
the martyrs,'' Arab news reports said.
   Despite the violence, tourists said they were glad they came to
the West Bank town.
   ``We are excited to be here, to see the places we have read about
from childhood through Sunday school and Bible studies,'' said
Charles W. Fleming, director of the Shiloh Baptist Church Senior
Choir in Washington, D.C.
   Seventy-six choir members joined the trip to Bethlehem to perform
in a Christmas Eve choir concert.
   In the occupied Gaza Strip, Christmas was marred by a series of
clashes between Palestinians and Israeli soldiers.
   In Jabaliya, a shantytown refugee camp, 17-year-old Raed Rashid
Idmaida was fatally shot in the head after Palestinian high school
students attacked soldiers with rocks, Arab reports said.
   The army said the confrontation occurred when a routine patrol
was confronted by a hail of stones.
   ``After one soldier was attacked physically by several protesters
and there was danger to his life, the soldier was forced to fire at
one of them and he (the protester) was killed,'' said an army
spokesman.
   Five other Palestinian teen-agers were wounded in the Jabaliya
clash, and 11 others were wounded in other incidents in the occupied
territories, according to Arab and media reports.
   Also Sunday, 22-year-old Mohammed Naser Hwash died of a head
wound sustained Dec. 16 during a clash with Israeli soldiers in the
West Bank city of Nablus, according to Israel radio and an official
at Muqassed Hospital in Arab east Jerusalem. The army said it was
checking the report.
   The new Palestinian fatalities raised to 336 the number of Arabs
killed in the uprising. Fourteen Israelis have also died.
   In east Jerusalem on Sunday, an Arab shopkeeper was critically
wounded when two firebombs were thrown inside his store, Israel
Television reported. The store was bombed for remaining open after
noon in violation of a yearlong commercial strike, the TV said.
   Moslem fundamentalists of the Hamas, or Zeal, movement published
a leaflet Sunday calling for a day of ``confrontation'' with Israel,
to mark the 41st anniversary since the founding of an armed
Palestinian movement by Abdel Kader Husseini. Hamas is particularly
powerful in Gaza.

   A couple left their 6-year-old son
at a gas station and failed to notice he wasn't in their car until
they got home 150 miles away, authorities said.
   Sean McCarty of Riverside was found by other holiday travelers
who called authorities, police spokeswoman Sheryl Hone said Sunday.
The boy's grandmother picked him up at a police station, the
spokeswoman said.
   The youngster knew enough of his address so that police could
locate his home in Riverside, where county sheriff's deputies were
waiting when the boy's parents got home late Saturday, she said.
   The child's mother told police Sean had been very quiet during
the first part of the trip home and must have slipped out of the car
at the gas station without the parents noticing.

<HEAD>Thousands Surround Buildings Housing African Students; 13 Injured</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN POMFRET</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   More than a dozen people were injured in an
all-night clash that started at a school dance between Chinese and
African students in Nanking, the official Xinhua news agency said
today.
   Thousands of Chinese surrounded two buildings at one university
where African students live and pelted students with rocks and
bottles for seven hours, said an African student, contacted by
telephone from Beijing.
   The Chinese then marched to other universities and bombarded
other dormitories which house African students.
   The Xinhua report said two Africans and 11 Chinese employees from
Hehai University in the eastern Chinese city were injured.
   The incident was the latest in a series of violent outbreaks
between black African students and Chinese during the last several
years. Chinese authorities say they are isolated cases, and deny
charges by the Africans that they are a result of racism against
Africans in Chinese society.
   Xinhua said the problem started when two African students
escorting Chinese women to a school dance refused a request by
university authorities to register the women's names. The common
practice is designed to limit contact between Chinese and foreigners.
   The report said other African students forced open the door and
attacked university employees, teachers and students with iron
sticks, bottles and rocks.
   The African student, who was at the party, said he first learned
of a problem when rocks and bottles began flying into the dance hall.
   ``I looked outside and I saw a crowd of about 2,000 Chinese,'' he
said.
   He said the crowd threw rocks and bottles at the dance hall and
two student dormitories from about 10 p.m. Saturday until 5 a.m.
Sunday.
   ``The crowd trapped us inside the buildings and we couldn't get
out,'' said the student.
   Another band of Chinese returned to Hehai at noon Sunday and
continued throwing rocks and bottles at the building, he said.
   That crowd, which he estimated at about 4,000, then marched to
two other universities in Nanking where black Africans study. He
quoted African students there as saying the crowd also threw rocks
and bottles at African dormitories.
   In its report, Xinhua said an unspecified number of students held
a street march, shouting ``punish assailants.''
   The African student, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said
police escorted about 70 African students to Nanjing's main train
station Sunday. He and Xinhua said the students demanded that they
be sent to Beijing.
   Today, a Dutch student at Nanking University said about 200 black
Africans from three different universities were at the station and
all wanted to go to Beijing. An official at the train station twice
refused to let a reporter talk by telephone to the students.
   Xinhua said local police have taken measures to protect the
African students and said some Africans have returned to the
university.
   In May 1986, about 18 Africans studying in the northeastern city
of Tianjin fled to Beijing because of reported threats from Chinese
following a bottle-throwing battle that started after Chinese
students complained of noise from a foreigners' party.
   About 200 African students in Beijing then staged a march to
protest what they said was racism against the estimated 1,500
Africans studying on Chinese campuses.
   In 1980, 19 Africans and Arabs and 24 Chinese were injured in a
fight in Shanghai that also began over loud music from a foreigner's
radio.

   A couple said they survived a
snowy night in subzero temperatures on the 9,425-foot Rabbit Ears
Pass by cross-country skiing all night.
   Mitchell Dion, 32, and his wife, Sydney, 25, of San Pedro,
Calif., were found in good condition Saturday, nearly 24 hours after
leaving on what was supposed to be a three-hour cross-country ski
trip, authorities said.
   ``It was either ski or die. That was the choice,'' Dion said from
Routt Memorial Hospital, where he and his wife were admitted for
observation and released.
   Dion said he suffered frostbite on a toe, but Mrs. Dion was
unharmed.
   Rescuers began looking for the couple after a relative reported
them missing Friday evening, said Routt County Sheriff's Deputy Dana
Taylor.
   By morning, about 30 people and a helicopter were involved in the
search, Taylor said. The helicopter crew spotted the couple on
Rabbit Ears Pass.
   Dion said he and his wife left on the ski trip shortly before
noon Friday, carrying two baked potatoes and a quart of water.
   ``We just wanted to get warmed up. But, then I got us completely
lost,'' he said. ``I didn't think that kind of thing could happen to
me. We got so far away (from where we intended to be) that even the
searchers couldn't find us.
   ``Once we realized that we just had to survive, our fatigue went
away and we never got tired or hungry after that,'' he said.
   The couple braved a snowstorm for several hours, but the snowfall
stopped about 3 a.m. Saturday. They figured out where they were with
the help of the moonlight, Dion said.
   He recognized a canyon that would lead them out, but the route
was a difficult one, Dion said.
   ``It was very steep and with rocks and brambles. We didn't know
how hard it was going to be,'' he said. ``We were heading toward the
main highway when the helicopter found us.''

<HEAD>Snow Blankets Much of West; Up to 2 Feet in Utah</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Snow fell early today from the mountains of Southern California
to the northern Plains, where the temperature dipped to minus 21
degrees. Some parts of Utah buried under as much as 2 feet of snow.
   Snow also lingered over parts of lower Michigan, upstate New York
and northern Vermont. Scattered rain and thunderstorms dampened
eastern Kansas, western Missouri and western Arkansas.
   A storm centered over the Rockies spread snow through much of the
West, including a light dusting Sunday in Las Vegas, that city's
first-ever Christmas Day snowfall.
   Snow fell Sunday night in mountain areas of Southern California
and traffic was escorted along Interstate 5 through Grapevine, north
of Los Angeles. Snow advisories continued in effect with up to 3
inches expected by morning.
   Snow was heavy at times Sunday evening in Show Low, Ariz., where
2 inches accumulated. In southern Idaho, Pocatello received half a
foot.
   A winter storm warning continued in Utah, where up to 2 feet was
reported on the eastern Salt Lake Valley on Sunday. Up to 6 inches
was expected by this morning, with the mountains possibly receiving
8 to 16 inches.
   The snow kept road crews busy but the Utah Highway Patrol said
only minor traffic accidents were reported. The snow and 20-40 mph
winds prompted the Utah Avalanche Forecast Center to issue a warning
for the northern Wasatch Mountains.
   Ahead of the storm, snow and sleet covered the northern Plains
and middle Missouri Valley. An inch of snow an hour was falling at
Rapid City, S.D.
   Today's forecast called for snow from the Rockies across the
northern Plains to Wisconsin and upper Michigan. Rain was expected
from northern Indiana to Illinois, the central Mississippi Valley,
Kansas, Oklahoma, and southeast Arizona.
   Highs were predicted to be near zero or in single digits from
western Minnesota across North Dakota to eastern Montana; in the
teens and 20s in northern New England, northern New York state,
upper Michigan, the upper Mississippi Valley, South Dakota, central
and northern Nebraska, the Rockies and the eastern Plateau. The 30s
and 40s were expected from central New England to Virginia, over the
rest of the Great Lakes and the Ohio Valley, the central Mississippi
Valley and central Plains, the rest of the Plateau and the central
and northern Pacific Coast; the 70s and 80s in Florida and southern
Texas. Highs elsewhere were forecast to be in the 50s and 60s.
   The nation's high on Christmas Day was 87 degrees at McAllen,
Texas.
   At 2 a.m. EST, temperatures ranged from minus 21 degrees at
Warroad, Minn., to 74 degrees at Fort Lauderdale, Fla.

   Killings during Christmas weekend pushed the
city's 1988 homicide total to a grisly record of 1,848, a trend that
authorities said has been fueled by crack and other drugs.
   With a week to go before year's end, seven homicides on Saturday
raised the total for 1988 to 1,842, one more than the record set in
1981, said a police spokesman, Sgt. Raymond O'Donnell.
   Christmas Day brought six more homicides, said another police
spokesman, Sgt. Maurice Howard.
   On an average day in New York City, five people are slain.
Elected and police officials blame drugs, particularly crack, for
the rise in violence.
   In all of 1945, the Police Department reported 291 homicides; in
August 1988 alone, there were 201. Since the crack explosion in
1985, homicides have steadily increased: 1,385 in 1985, 1,582 in
1986 and 1,672 last year.
   As of last month, Assistant Police Chief Raymond Kelly said,
about 42 percent of this year's slayings were drug-related.
   ``These tragic statistics reflect the mayor's concern expressed
over the past 4{ years that the federal government ought to do
something about drugs flooding across our border,'' said mayoral
spokesman Lee Jones.
   The problem is not limited to New York; Washington also has set a
record for the most homicides in a year.
   New York ranks 10th in killings per 100,000 people, said Kelly.
The top three are Detroit, Washington and New Orleans, he said.
   The record-setting homicide, reported shortly after 11 p.m.
Saturday, involved a 19-year-old Staten Island man whose body was
found on a streetcorner, riddled with bullet wounds, according to a
police spokeswoman, Sgt. Diane Kubler. The motive for the slaying
was unknown, she said.

   Calling it ``the greatest Christmas gift
that I could give,'' President-elect Bush's son John passed out
candy and toys to children injured in Armenia's devastating
earthquake.
   John E. Bush and his 12-year-old son George flew into the
Armenian capital of Yerevan aboard a DC-8 cargo plane carrying
relief supplies, toured the disaster zone in a bus and stopped in
the village of Spitak, which was flattened by the Dec. 7 quake.
   They returned to Yerevan later Sunday and visited rooms on three
floors of Children's Hospital No. 3, where more than 600 youngsters
hurt in the quake have been treated.
   Bush and his son handed out candy bars, teddy bears, games of
tick-tack-toe and other donated toys flown in by the Americares
charity.
   ``This is probably the greatest Christmas gift that I could give
myself or my son,'' said the lanky 35-year-old Miami real estate
developer, who is nicknamed Jeb.
   Armenians themselves were not celebrating Christmas. An ancient
people who embraced Christianty as a state religion more than 1,600
years ago, Armenians have canceled Christmas festivities on Jan. 6,
the date they and the other Eastern rites usually celebrate the
birth of Jesus.
   Bush's eyes welled with tears as white-coated Armenian doctors
and nurses, speaking through interpreters, told him of the ordeals
and injuries of the children, many of whom gazed blankly and
silently at the visitors from their hospital beds.
   Paulik Khaladvhan, 12, was crushed as his Spitak home collapsed
and lay unconscious for seven days under the ruins. Mona Kasparyan,
3{, was pinned motionless under a broken concrete panel for four
days.
   Kayani Petrosyan, 5, was buried alive with her mother for nine
days and survived only because the woman cut her fingers and fed her
blood.
   ``Happy Christmas to you. You're a brave little girl,'' Bush told
Kayani, who was cradled in her grandmothers' arms.
   Oganis Tomasyan bent over to kiss the 12-year-old Bush when the
boy gave candy and toys to Tomasyan's granddaughter, Mona. The
girl's mother died Saturday in a Moscow hospital after her legs were
amputated.
   ``I saw children who suffered and I looked at the horrible scenes
of the buildings,'' George said of his trip to the disaster area.
   He said his Christmas visit to Armenia is ``better than just
sitting at home and opening presents.''
   Alarmed that the Bushes might pass them by, injured children in
fifth-floor wards and their parents descended stairs and
pathetically pleaded with hospital staff and Soviet officials to
have the president-elect's son visit them, too.
   ``They won't let him come because our floor hasn't been repaired
for his visit,'' said a sobbing Artyun Grigoryan, 12, as he stood on
crutches in the stairwell, an ugly gash visible on his head. ``Tell
him, please tell him that on the fifth floor there are suffering
children, too.''
   The hospital's chief doctor, Ophelia Nazaryan, said Bush was not
invited to other wards because of the risk of infection. Marguerite
Squire, a U.S. Embassy spokeswoman from Moscow accompanying Bush,
said Bush had brought enough toys for all 350 children now at the
hospital and that they would be distributed.
   Bush said there was nothing political about his one-day visit.
   ``This is no question of politics or ideology,'' he said. ``It's
a question of people helping people.'' An estimated 55,000 people
were killed in the quake and a half million rendered homeless.
   Bush and his son were to fly home via New York later Sunday, but
their plane was grounded by heavy snow in Yerevan, according to
Susan Hanson, a spokeswoman for Americares, a private relief
organization based in New Canaan, Conn.
   In the disaster area, workers continued to clear rubble and
evacuate residents. The labor newspaper Trud said Sunday that 99,000
people had been taken out of the area _ more than 60,000 of them to
places outside the Armenian republic.

<HEAD>Volunteers Wry To Save Oil-Coated Birds</HEAD>

   Volunteers cleaned and fed hundreds of
squawking waterfowl coated with some of the 70,000 gallons of oil
that spilled into the ocean after a tug boat collided with a barge.
   With the search for dead and ailing birds continuing, 207 dead
birds had been found by Sunday night, and it could take weeks for
officials to determine how many of the injured waterfowl will
survive, said Pam Miller, a state biologist in charge of the rescue
mission.
   Sause Bros. Ocean Towing of Coos Bay, Ore., owner of the tug
Ocean Services and barge Nestucca, hired a company to begin cleanup
operations Saturday. Dick Lauer, a company manager, said Sunday he
doubted an estimate of cleanup costs would be available before late
today.
   Officials said 570 rescued birds were kept in cardboard boxes
around the Hoquiam Middle School gymnasium, locker rooms and
hallways. About 50 volunteers worked on bird cleanup Sunday at the
makeshift bird hospital, noisy with squawking birds tapping on their
boxes.
   It took about an hour for each bird to be cleaned by a pair of
volunteers and then wrapped in towels or cloths to be kept warm.
   The birds, mostly open-ocean birds such as murres, were being
tube-fed twice a day with smelt. Most arrived ``pretty well coated
with oil from head to toe,'' Ms. Miller said.
   It would probably take three or four weeks to clean, inspect and
return the stricken birds to the wild, said Alice Berkner, executive
director of the Bird Rescue Research Center in Berkeley, Calif., and
supervisor of the rescue. Of those treated, 25 percent to 65 percent
are expected to survive, officials said.
   Oil ruins the insulating effect of a bird's feathers, which can
cause it to die of cold, Ms. Miller said. Birds also can be poisoned
by ingesting oil while cleaning their feathers, she added.
   The birds, including grebes, loons, scoters and other sea ducks,
were found along a 30- to 40-mile section of coastline after the
tugboat Ocean Services struck the fuel-oil barge Nestucca it was
towing to Grays Harbor on Thursday, authorities said.
   An emergency patch was placed on the barge Saturday, and the next
day it was taken to Portland, Ore., for repairs.
   Athough oil-soaked birds were found from the mouth of the
Columbia River to Moclips, oil washed ashore only along a three-mile
stretch of beach from the entrance to Grays Harbor northward to
Ocean Shores, officials said. A Wildlife Department spokesman said
beach cleanup was progressing smoothly.
   Two remaining strips of oil were five to 15 miles offshore late
Sunday, but officials expect it to dissipate or sink, said Wildlife
Department spokesman Doug Zimmer.
   He added that damage was minimized because the spill occurred at
high tide so the most of oil was drawn out to sea and dissipated,
rather than being concentrated in more environmentally sensitive
shoreline areas.
   The biggest known spill in Washington state waters was a
239,000-gallon leak from the tanker Arco Anchorage in Port Angeles
on Dec. 21, 1985, with bird losses conservatively estimated at 1,600
marine fowl and 475 ducks.

   A man reaching for sugar from his kitchen cabinet
was killed by shots fired through his second floor window, police
said.
   Inacio Mendez, 43, of Boston's Roxbury section was pronounced
dead at Boston City Hospital on Christmas night, about 45 minutes
after the shooting, said Police Sgt. Albert Goslin.
   Goslin said Mendez's wife was sitting at the kitchen table with
her husband when he got up to make coffee. He was standing by the
window, getting sugar from the cabinet, when she heard several shots
and saw her husband grab his chest. He was hit twice _ in the left
breast and in the left arm _ but managed to stagger into a hallway
before he collapsed, Goslin said.
   Police said they had no suspects. A closed set of venetian blinds
covered the window, leading police to surmise that the gunman may
not even have known whom he was firing at.

<TEXT>
   A Baptist minister from New Jersey who
came under Contra rebel fire this year has defied U.S. government
policy and brought about 70 tons of food, medicine and supplies to
the Nicaraguan people for Christmas.
   The Rev. Lucius Walker arrived in Nicaragua on Christmas Eve with
a caravan of 18 vehicles carrying the goods for the victims of the
seven-year civil war.
   ``This feels like a great sense of triumph, because the terrorism
(here) is supported by the government of the United States and we
are representatives of the goodwill of the people of the United
States,'' the Baptist minister said.
   Walker, of Demarest, N.J., is the executive director of the New
York-based Interreligious Foundation For Community Organization,
which sponsored the relief effort, called Pastors For Peace.
   The Reagan administration in 1985 ordered an economic boycott of
leftist Nicaragua, but the ban excludes humanitarian aid.
   In July, another convoy of aid crossed the U.S.-Mexico border
after a long dispute with U.S. Customs Service, which said taking
the trucks to Nicaragua would violate the 1985 measure.
   The government agrees the roughly 70 tons of supplies qualify as
humanitarian aid exempt from the embargo, but says the vehicles are
not aid.
   Walker's vehicles, which crossed the U.S. border on Dec. 14, were
detained briefly by customs officials, according to Tom Hansen, a
project coordinator from New York.
   ``We were forced to call our lawyers and say the licensing
request they wanted was illegal,'' he said. ``Humanitarian aid
doesn't require an export license.''
   Walker's organization is strongly opposed to the Contra rebels,
who with U.S. backing have fought since 1981 to try to oust the
Sandinistas.
   When Walker visited Nicaragua in August, he said, he was slightly
wounded by a Contra bullet fired during an attack on a riverboat in
eastern Nicaragua. But he vowed to return with aid.
   ``I feel a great sense of satisfaction and rightness,'' Walker
said.
   The goods will be distributed among Nicaraguans by religious
groups, said Sharon Haas, another project coordinator from Cleveland.
   Ms. Haas said she doesn't see much hope for a change in U.S.
policies toward the Nicaraguan government after the January
inauguaration of George Bush as president.
   Ms. Haas said the group planned to travel to the Nicaraguan
coastal city of Bluefields to see the devastation left by the Oct.
22 hurricane.
   Walker said he was wounded while traveling from Bluefields, but
rebel activity there has dropped substantially after a cease-fire
agreement was signed by the government and the Contras in March.
Talks aimed at establishing a permanent peace broke down in
September.
   Most Contras have fled to camps in Honduras, where they received
U.S.-supplied aid ranging from food to uniforms.
   Congress stopped U.S. military aid to the rebels in February but
allowed distribution of non-lethal aid to continue in neighboring
Honduras.

<HEAD>Arafat: PLO Insists On A Corridor Connecting the West Bank and Gaza
Strip</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HAMBURG, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The PLO will insist that an
independent Palestine have a corridor through Israel to connect the
Gaza Strip and the West Bank, PLO chief Yasser Arafat is quoted by a
West Germany magazine as saying.
   In an interview in this week's Der Spiegel magazine, Arafat also
was quoted as saying the Palestine Liberation Organization will
continue to demand that Jerusalem be capital of that independent
state.
   He was asked if, in the negotiations he hopes for with Israel, he
would insist on sticking to U.N. Resolution 181, which deliniates
borders for Israel and a Palestinian state. Under those borders,
some areas that the Israelis have held for 40 years would be part of
a Palestinian state.
   However, Arafat was quoted as saying: ``Let's get the talks
started first, then each can put their conditions on the table.''
   ``But in all cases we will insist on establishing a corridor
between West (Bank of the River) Jordan and the Gaza Strip. It is
not acceptable for us to establish a state split into two parts.''
   The Palestine National Council declared an independent state Nov.
15 at a meeting in Algiers. Then, after Arafat explicitly recognized
Israel's right to exist and renounced terrorism, Washington ended a
13-year ban on contacts with the organization and opened talks with
the PLO on Dec. 16.
   Israel has said it will not negotiate for Middle East peace with
the PLO, which it considers a terrorist organization.
   Arafat backs an international Middle East peace conference, and
has in the past two weeks traveled to Austria, East Germany, Italy,
Romania and Yugoslavia seeking support for the plan. He had an
audience with Pope John Paul II on Friday.
   Der Spiegel also quoted the PLO leader as saying he is willing to
negotiate ``on equal terms.''
   In the interview, Arafat also insisted that Arab east Jerusalem
must be the Palestine capital: ``We demand our Arabian Jerusalem,
not more and not less.'' Israel annexed Arab east Jerusalem after
seizing it in the 1967 Middle East war along with the West Bank and
Gaza Strip, which are home to 1.7 million Palestinians.
   Palestinians in the occupied lands are engaged in a year-long
uprising against Israeli occupation that has claimed the lives of at
least 335 Arabs and 14 Israelis. PLO officials have credited the
revolt for helping gain international sympathy for their cause.

   It was the worst and best of Christmases for
Jack Wittman, who thought he had lost his son in the Pan Am crash
over Scotland and then, suddenly, received the gift of his boy's
life.
   ``I had the greatest present I could have had. I had my Christmas
last night,'' Jack Wittman, the father of Master Sgt. David Lee
O'Connor, said Sunday. ``I am 62 years old and will never live to
have a better Christmas than the one last night.''
   However, he said, ``I feel so sorry for the other people. My
heart goes out to them because I know what they are feeling.''
   Wittman said he talked to his son Christmas Eve, two days after
being told by Pan Am that the soldier, stationed in West Germany,
had been on the plane that crashed and killed all 258 aboard.
   ``He didn't know nothing about it,'' Wittman said. ``He was kind
of upset and didn't know what was going on. He said, `I am alive and
doing well.' When we both quit crying and settled down I told him I
loved him and wished he was here. Thank God he wasn't on the plane.''
   The false information apparently came from a listing of ``D.
O'Connor,'' Wittman said. But the actual victim was Daniel E.
O'Connor, 31, of Boston, who was a security agent for the State
Department in Nicosia, Cyprus.
   Wittman, who is retired from a Sapulpa glass company, said the
mistaken notification of his son's death sent shock waves through
his family as it gathered to celebrate Christmas. His son had sent
him a letter last month indicating that he would try to return to
Oklahoma for the Christmas holidays.
   ``Hell's not the word,'' Wittman said. ``Nobody knows what it's
like until they go through it. If it hadn't been for prayer and the
church I belong to here I couldn't have made it.''

<DATELINE>DENVER (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A controversial Denver program that pays teen-age
girls $1 a day not to get pregnant is proving one of the most
successful methods of curbing the teen pregnancy rate, supporters
say.
   The program was introduced at La Mariposa Health Station three
years ago, and prompted criticism even from many supporters of
family planning, who saw it as paternal and coercive.
   Supporters of the program don't claim to have found the ultimate
solution to the teen-age pregnancy problem, but they say on a small
scale it works and costs less in the long run.
   Between 30 percent and 50 percent of teen-agers who become
pregnant once are likely to become pregnant again before they're 18.
But of 18 original participants in the Denver program, only 17
percent had a repeat pregnancy.
   Gov. Roy Romer's Initiative on Teen Pregnancy reported that
Colorado spends more than $200 million annually in Aid to Families
with Dependent Children, food stamps, Medicaid and other public
assistance for families headed by women who began their childbearing
as teens.
   To earn their money, all the teen-agers have to do is show up
once a week at the west side clinic for a group session. La Mariposa
counselor Diane Medina presides over a stack of dollar bills and a
smorgasbord of snacks. She just listens to the conversation and
makes no demands.
   About a dozen teen-agers are regulars; others come occasionally
or drop by to pick up their $7 and leave.
   ``There are no hard and fast rules,'' said medical director Dr.
Peggy LaTourrette. ``They can talk about anything they want to. This
is the only group, the one place ... they can come in and nobody's
telling them what to do, nobody's giving them rules and
regulations.''
   Officials at Rocky Mountain Planned Parenthood have had their
hands slapped by their national headquarters for funding the
program, but they hope to prop it up for another year. The program
lacks funding for 1989.
   Supporters say anyone with $1 a day to contribute to the project
can ``sponsor'' a teen-ager, significantly decreasing the odds that
she will give birth to a child before she's 18.
   Desiree Ramos, 16, has earned $462 through the program which, for
her, is spending money. She had an abortion at 13, and still wants
children ``but I want to wait until I'm 20, maybe 21.''
   ``I want to have enough to buy him what he wants. I don't want
him stealing. I don't want us living in the projects,'' she said.

<TEXT>
   Three huge storage vats were uncorked at a
winery, creating a 450,000-gallon pink sea, and authorities said the
motive may involve sour grapes.
   Valves to the storage vats were opened before sunrise Saturday at
Bronco Wine Co., located on the outskirts of Modesto, said
Stanislaus County sheriff's investigators.
   Over five hours, 344,000 gallons of white wine and another
106,000 gallons of red wine flowed from the vats at a loss of
$800,000, said Detective Jane Irwin.
   The culprit may be a disgruntled former or current employee,
because the complex valves on the vats would be difficult for an
outsider to open, she said. Winery employees were being interviewed.
   Bronco Wine executive John Franzia said he was upset about the
loss, but he spent little time crying over spilled wine.
   ``There's nothing I can do about it,'' he said. ``It's done.''
   A winery security guard discovered the spill at 9:30 a.m. Five
hours earlier, everything had been dry, Franzia said.
   Workers pumped the wine into an adjacent field and road,
surprising deputies, who drove into a 3-foot-deep pool of the
liquid. Wine rose to the patrol car doors, Ms. Irwin said.
   She said she initially thought the liquid was water dumped by
recent storms, but then noticed that the pool had a bouquet and
blush.

<TEXT>
   President Hosni Mubarak said he is willing to
go to Israel if it would help bring peace to the Middle East, and
Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir of Isreal said he would welcome such a
visit.
   The trip would be the first by an Arab leader since Anwar Sadat's
daring visit in 1977, which set the stage for the first peace treaty
between Israel and an Arab state, and his two follow-up visits in
May and September 1979.
   Mubarak made the offer in two weekend interviews. However, he
told the Tokyo newspaper Yomiuri on Sunday that he would go only if
Israel extends the invitation unconditionally. ``I don't accept any
preconditions,'' he said.
   In responding to Mubarak's initial offer, made through an
interview with the Kuwait newspaper Al-Anbaa, Shamir said Sunday
that he would be ``very happy to receive him in Israel.''
   However, Shamir indicated on Israel Television that he wants to
work with Egypt toward providing limited self-rule to Palestinians
in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip based on the 1978
Camp David accords.
   In many public statements in recent months, Mubarak has rejected
that as a basis for talks.
   He supports PLO chairman Yasser Arafat' to have elapsed because Israel
failed to honor
them and because they now have been superseded by other initiatives
for a Palestinian settlement.
   If Mubarak were to visit Israel, he would be the first Arab
leader to go to the Jewish state since his predecessor. Sadat's 1977
visit to Jerusalem to address the Knesset, Israel's parliament, set
in motion the process that made Egypt the only Arab country linked
by peace treaty to Israel.
   Moslem extremists assassinated Sadat four years later, partly
because of the treaty. Mubarak, then the vice president, was
standing at Sadat's side but suffered only a minor hand wound.
   The latest offer appears part of Mubarak's attempt to
re-establish Egypt as the Arab world's main power broker.
   Mubarak offered to visit Israel in replying to a question by the
Kuwaiti newspaper whether he would go ``if that would resolve the
whole Palestinian issue?''
   ``Why not go?'' Mubarak was quoted as saying. ``If this visit
would lead to solving the problem, and if it would lead to
establishing a just peace, then I am ready.''
   He said groundwork would have to be laid well.
   ``It is not a matter of empty movements without content or
established interest. ... If there is something that needs my going
to Israel to resolve the Arab cause, what should stop me? ... Our
contacts with Israel are in the open, we discuss and exchange views
with them, and that it is best way to solve issues.''
   In Sunday's interview with the Japanese newspaper, Mubarak
stressed that he has nolations with Cairo after the
peace treaty was signed.
   Mubarak began shortly after Sadat's assassination to repair the
diplomatic damage. His moves paid off in November 1987 with a
decision by the Arab League that relations with Egypt was a matter
best left to individual national decisions.
   Since then, all but Libya, Lebanon and Syria have restored
relations, and there have been strong hints in recent days of a
rapprochement with Syria.

<TEXT>
   Despite the blasts of hot air from exhaust
grates, the comradery of men battling nature, regular stops by a
volunteer soup kitchen and the little donated Christmas tree topped
by a blue baseball cap, none of the dozen homeless men at the Foggy
Botton triangle thinks life in the streets is quite so great as
President Reagan says they do.
   The president said in a television interview before his departure
for Christmas in California that people who live on Washington's
streets ``still prefer out there on the grates or the lawn to going
into one of those shelters.''
   He told ABC's David Brinkley that he didn't understand why the
homeless don't get jobs when the local paper carries up to 75 pages
of help wanted ads each Sunday. Reagan also said a large percentage
of homeless people are mentally retarded.
   The American Civil Liberties Union attacked Reagan's remarks
broadcast Thursday as ``mean spirited and insensitive,'' saying the
number of homeless has increased dramatically under his
administration. Estimates range into the hundreds of thousands, with
more than 15,000 of those in the nation's capital.
   Every man interviewed on the triangle formed by 20th and E
Streets and Virginia Avenue, four blocks from the White House, said
he would rather live under a roof.
   But they all said life on Washington's grates is better than life
in homeless shelters which haven't got enough room to take in all of
the capital's homeless.
   ``Given the choice of one of the grates and the urine and the
lice and the maggots, I'll take the grates,'' said Robert Jackson,
as a stiff, hot updraft warmed a small circle of men in their 20s
and 30s over the Christmas weekend.
   Robert Moens, 29, said the shelters are full of drug addicts,
freed mental patients, transvestites and criminals.
   ``You've got people in there who would steal the stink out of
your shoes,'' he said.
   The men agreed that plenty of jobs are available, and some of
them have jobs. Two said they work full-time for the federal
government. One has delivered pizzas and used to sleep in his
delivery uniform under the trees on the triangle.
   But they say none of the jobs pays enough to get a man off the
grates.
   Moens said he can earn good money by submitting to safe
scientific testing at university laboratories. But he said he
recently had to send $1,000 for support of his two children who live
with their great-grandmother, and he only has enough to rent a
storage shed for his belongings.
   Moens said Reagan is partly right about the great number of
mentally ill on the streets.
   ``It was all done with good intentions when they started
releasing people who were not a danger to others,'' he said. ``But
it's more inhuman to let them stay out here and fend for themselves.
Some of them are psychotic and should be locked up.''
   Go Go Joe, who wouldn't give his real name because he doesn't
want relatives to know how he's living, said he prides himself on
good hygiene and believes deeply in Jesus Christ.
   He said he has had several $3.35-an-hour minimum wage jobs.
   ``I challenge President Reagan to live on that,'' he said.
   The Sheriff, who also would not give his real name, showed his
photo on a plastic Defense Department identification card and said
he was working as a supervisor at the Pentagon. He also said he'd
been in prison on a weapons charge until a year ago.
   ``I have clothes. I take showers. I work out at the Pentagon gym.
I don't want pity. I'm just in Washington trying to get a
foothold,'' said the man, who is 35.
   ``This is our living room,'' he said, ``and that's our television
set,'' pointing to the street _ a partially demolished building, a
classy apartment house, a drug store and a liquor store.
   Liquor store co-owner Brian Fischer has a different view of the
grates.
   Some of the men are his friends and one once brought him to
tears. A fellow named Allen came in so cold he couldn't fasten his
jacket.
   ``When he asked me to help him zip up, I got an image of my
7-year-old kid, and I cried,'' said Fischer.
   But some men out there are seriously mentally ill and others are
criminals who find refuge in the anonymity of street life, he said.
   ``The media builds up these people too much,'' he said. ``A lot
of them fight over the grates with bottles.''
   When an elderly, white-bearded derelict called Wolfman died a few
weeks ago after living on the streets for more than two decades, his
body lay on a grate for three hours before anyone came to take it
away, Fischer said.
   ``The president has a very valid point about them preferring to
live on the grates rather than in the Washington shelters,'' said
Fischer. ``But criminals in prison are treated better than these
people.''

   Friends and relatives of a man killed by a
twister that swirled through two Nashville suburbs, destroying 20
buildings, used power saws in an attempt to salvage their buried
belongings.
   ``We've picked around a little bit, trying to get things on the
edges,'' said Victor McMillan, son-in-law of Ernest Rice, 67, who
was killed by one of eight tornadoes in the region on Saturday.
   ``It'll be bulldozed and carted off,'' McMillan said. ``We're
trying to get into areas we haven't been able to reach.''
   Police officers and state troopers sent in by Gov. Ned McWherter
patrolled the area to deter looting, but officials said curiosity
seekers tying up traffic have been the worst problem.
   ``The biggest problem has been sightseers,'' said Mike Thompson,
emergency management director for Williamson County.
   The twister cut a three-mile path that also damaged 45 homes and
17 businesses, officials said. Thompson estimated the damage to
houses at $3 million.
   Fifteen people injured by the tornado were examined at Williamson
Medical Center, but only one was admitted. Lucy McClearon of College
Grove was listed in stable condition today.
   Several hotels gave free lodging to tornado victims.
   McMillan recalled that as the tornado hit, he and his wife were
lifted into the air and shot outside the house.
   ``We were very quickly outside in the dark and the rain,'' he
said. ``We ended up out in the gravel.''
   Many of those whose homes or businesses were destroyed were
distraught, while others were stoic.
   ``We're having a great Christmas,'' said Mary Ann Power as family
members salvaged material from her office supply business, Power
Enterprises.
   ``What can you do. It's happened. It's just a fact of life.
They're just material things. We can replace that.''

   Operators of three women's clinics hit by
suspicious fires on Christmas morning blamed anti-abortion
activists, but the leader of one group said members condemn the use
of violence.
   Federal officials joined arson investigators to determine the
cause of the fires, which broke out within an hour of each other.
   ``We'll start interviewing people (today) and look at motives and
if there were any threats against any of the clinics,'' said Chris
Nelson, assistant special agent at the Dallas office of the U.S.
Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms.
   Firefighters responded to blazes at North Dallas Women's Clinic,
the Fairmount Center Clinic and A to Z Women's Health Services
within an hour Sunday morning, fire Capt. Mike Southerland said.
Damage was minor, and no injuries were reported.
   Clinic officials believe the attacks were the work of
anti-abortion groups.
   ``We feel like we know who it is,'' said Betty Pettigrew,
director of A to Z Women's Health Services. ``They're always
threatening it, and we had heard that some clinic was going to be
hit _ not necessarily in Dallas.''
   But Bill Price, president of the Greater Dallas Right to Life,
said his group rejects violence.
   ``Our organization has made a commitment to stop abortion by
working through the system,'' Price said. The use of violence ``will
definitely hurt our cause.''

<TEXT>
   The chief investigator into the crash
of Pan Am Flight 103 said today that a suitcase and pieces of
wreckage were sent to a military research center to see if they show
signs of an pre-crash explosion.
   Mick Charles, head of a team of 40 U.S. and British investigators
at the site, also said there was no evidence yet of a structural
failure in the jumbo jet but that the possibility was still being
``actively investigated.''
   An expert on air disasters blamed structural failure for the
crash and was quoted as saying the Boeing 747's left wing, which has
not been found, could have fallen into the sea _ ripped off as the
nose tore away.
   Also today, police investigated reports that looters were
scouring the wreckage from the plane during the night in search of
rings, jewlery and cash, and authorities arrested a man on suspicion
of looting.
   The violence of the disaster in southwest Scotland was such that
five days after Britain's worst-ever aviation wreck, it has not yet
been possible to identify even one of the 239 bodies recovered.
   Searchers still had to find an estimated 30 more bodies.
   No more bodies were found on Sunday. Pan Am said 258 were aboard
the night flight to New York, and 11 townspeople were listed as
missing.
   Charles said some pieces of wreckage from the Boeing 747 and a
suitcase were being sent to a military research center for
examination ``to determine whether they exhibit evidence of
pre-impact explosion.''
   His statement was issued by the Department of Transport.
   Charles said on Friday that investigators had no evidence of
sabotage in the crash of the Pan Am jet over this picturesque town
in southwest Scotland.
   The sabotage theory emerged after an Islamic group claimed
responsibility, the U.S. government said it had been warned of a
threat against a Pan Am flight from Frankfurt to New York, and
flight recorders showed the pilots apparently had no warning before
the plane broke up suddenly at 31,000 feet.
   Flight 103 started in Frankfurt and changed aircrafts in London.
   Charles' brief statement today said:
   ``Although, because of the fragmented and scattered nature of the
wreckage, the investigation of the structual aspect of the accident
is a slow process, no evidence of a structual failure has so far
been found. However, the possibility of such a failure is still
being actively investigated.
   ``Some pieces of wreckage and a suitcase are today being taken to
the Royal Armament Research and Development Establishment at Fort
Halstead for more detailed examination to determine whether they
exhibit evidence of a pre-impact explosion.''
   The Ministry of Defense said the Fort Halstead center near Biggin
Hill in Kent does research and development on armor and exlosives.
   An expert on air disasters was quoted today as saying he thought
structural failure to the rear of the cockpit was the cause.
   William Tench, Britain's former chief inspector of air accidents
and now a consultant on aircraft accidents to the Defense Ministry
and the European Economic Community, told The Times of London there
was no evidence of a bomb.
   Tench said the jet's left wing, which has not been found, could
have fallen into the sea _ ripped off as the nose tore away. The
wind could then have blown the wing into the sea, which is just 10
miles south of Lockerbie.
   ``If the wing had broken off at the root, the disruption of the
electrical system would have been substantial, possibly precluding
the sending of a mayday (distress) call,'' Tench was quoted as
saying.
   ``If the wing is missing, this raises the question of whether
there was a structural failure resulting from over-stressing in
extreme weather conditions, which were in the area at the time,''
The Times quoted Tench as saying.
   Police said today that they had arrested a local 28-year-old man
on suspicion of looting. The announcement followed reports in The
Sun, Britain's largest-circulation newspaper, that looters were
scouring wreckage from the plane under cover of night in search of
rings, jewlery and cash.
   Police said the suspect might be taken before the sheriff's court
in nearby Dumfries when it reopens on Wednesday.
   Police spokesman Angus Kennedy said steady rain today might
hamper a helicopter survey of the search corridor, which now extends
15 miles east of Lockerbie, where most of the Boeing 747 rained to
the ground in large pieces.

   A couple with six children adopted another six
just in time for Christmas, and now they plan to expand their home.
   ``I can't imagine any of them being any less than our own,'' said
Margaret Thimsen, who along with her husband, Ronald, adopted the
new family members at a special hearing Friday.
   ``Ron and I have one big problem: We don't know how to withhold
love,'' Mrs. Thimsen said. ``So often in foster-home situations,
withholding becomes a necessity. You just can't let yourself get too
attached to someone you're going to lose. In our case, we don't
lose. We keep.''
   The new children include siblings James, 12, Nina, 8, Joseph, 7,
and Rayna, 5. Also adopted were 2-year-old Christopher and
7-year-old Anne, who joins her two sisters, Mildred, 11, and Diane,
10, who were adopted by the Thimsens in 1984.
   The other children are Kim, 9, adopted in 1983, Mary, 21, adopted
in 1971, and the Thimsens' biological children, Dennis, 27, and
Debbie, 23, who live in California and were home for the holiday
weekend.
   Nine of the adopted Thimsen children were unwanted. All but
Christopher are victims of physical or sexual abuse.
   Christopher's story is unique. He is Mary's son, so he is now
both an adoptive son and grandson to the Thimsens.
   ``Mary's life has not been easy,'' Mrs. Thimsen said. ``She just
didn't feel she could be a mother when she wasn't ready, so we
thought, `Why not?' How could we have done otherwise?''
   Thimsen, who works in the maintenance department of a Redmond
research firm, said the family plans to add two bedrooms to its
three-bedroom home.

Christmas night, family members said today.
   Jason Brady, 16, died at at his home in Moore.
   Brady, the son of Robert and Irla Brady, suffered from Burkitts
Lymphoma and learned in early December that he had only a few weeks
to live. He wanted to visit Washington and the Make-A-Wish
Foundation in Oklahoma City arranged for the visit.
   In Washington, Brady met with President-elect George Bush,
Oklahoma Sens. Don Nickles and David Boren and appeared on the
NBC-TV ``Today Show'' with Willard Scott. He returned to Oklahoma on
Wednesday.
   A funeral service is scheduled for Wednesday morning in Moore.

   Gov. George Mickelson, injured in a
snowmobile accident over the weekend, was in good condition today
and even felt good enough to joke with hospital personnel, an aide
said.
   ``He said he didn't want to get on the hopsital scale because it
weighs heavier than the one at home,'' said Gretchen Lord Anderson,
Mickelson's press aide.
   The governor was in the special care unit at St. Mary's Hospital
in Pierre, and Anderson said he might be moved into a regular room
today. Mickelson probably will remain hospitalized at least through
Saturday.
   Mickelson, 47, suffered a broken collarbone and four broken ribs
when his snowmobile dropped about 10 feet into a ravine and he was
thrown off during an outing with his family Saturday afternoon.
   Mickelson slept well Sunday night, Anderson said.
   ``He put in a good night's rest, but he's still in a lot of
pain,'' she said.

<TEXT>
   Two young French girls who were held
hostage with their mother and five Belgians for more than a year
were released today and flown to Paris, a spokesman for their Moslem
captors said.
   Walid Khaled, spokesman for the Fatah-Revolutionary Council, the
extremist guerrilla group headed by terrorist Abu Nidal, said the
girls _ Marie-Laure, 7, and Virginie, 6 _ were ``on their way to
Paris by plane and will arrive there within a few hours.'' He did
not specify the flight they were on.
   The girls' father and grandmother left Beirut earlier today
aboard a Paris-bound Middle East Airlines plane after saying they
were disappointed that the girls were not freed on Christmas, as
expected.
   The Fatah-Revolutionary Council said Sunday that the girls would
be freed as a Christmas gift to the children of the world.
   The group said it was acting in response to appeals from Libyan
leader Moammar Gadhafi, chief backer of the organization. But Khaled
would not specify where or when the girls would be freed, only that
it would be outside Lebanon.
   ``I ask their (the girls') father to be ready with lots of
Christmas gifts to reunite with his daughters,'' Khaled told The
Associated Press today.
   He again refused to say where the two girls were released. But
there had been widespread speculation that they would be freed
either in Libya or Algeria where Fatah-Revolutionary Council also
has bases.
   Earlier today, Khaled said the girls had been told of their
imminent release and that their mother, Jacqueline Valente, no
longer objected to this. ``They are old enough and have accepted the
coming separation. They are happy. They did not cry,'' Khaled said.
   The grandmother and father of the girls said earlier today that
they were unhappy about leaving for Paris without the girls.
   ``I'm disappointed because I'm leaving without my two
granddaughters,'' said Brigitte Valente as she left a hotel for the
airport.
   With her in the escorted French Embassy car were Pascal Betille,
the girls' father and estranged husband of French hostage Jacqueline
Valente, as well as Ms. Valente's brother-in-law, Andre Metral.
   ``I'm disappointed because I am going without my two little
darlings,'' said Betille. ``But I am carrying with me a promise that
they are going to be released soon.''
   Khaled released a new set of videotapes of the captives on
Sunday. On the tape, all the captives said they were well cared for.
   The Fatah-Revolutionary Council declared Nov. 8, 1987 that it had
seized them aboard a French yacht off the Israeli-occupied Gaza
Strip and accused them of spying for Israel. However, Israeli press
reports said the yacht was hijacked off Libya, the group's main base.
   The radicals did not disclose where the hostages were held but
said the tapes were filmed Dec. 20. They did not relay any demands
of their kidnappers.
   The Belgians are Fernand Houtekins, his brother Emmanuel and his
wife Godelieve and their two children, Laurent, 17, and Valerie, 16.
   ``I'm pregnant and in good health. After our release, I intend to
live in another country than France to build up my future there,''
Ms. Valente said on the videotape.
   Ms. Valente gave birth to another girl in captivity and is due to
deliver again in January, according to Khaled.
   Besides those seized on the boat, 15 foreigners, including nine
Americans, are missing in Lebanon and believed held hostage by
pro-Iranian fundamentalist factions. The longest held is Terry
Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent for The Associated Press,
who was abducted March 16, 1985.
   Peter Winkler, 32, a Swiss working for the International
Committee of the Red Cross was released Dec. 16 after nearly a month
in captivity. His kidnappers reportedly wanted to trade him for a
Shiite Moslem hijacker, Hussein Hariri, whose trial begins in
Switzerland in February.

   John Mulroy, described by a colleague as a
balding leprechaun six feet tall, was a man who made things work.
   An emergency electrical system for The Associated Press in Lima,
to use when guerrilla actions led to blackouts.
   A satellite setup that carried AP accounts of the Olympic games
in Seoul to a receiver in London, and on to the world's newspapers
and broadcasters.
   A balky communications link in Hong Kong _ with repairs
prescribed long distance while he was in a hotel room in Istanbul.
   ``Morning, how's everything?'' he said before he talked the Hong
Kong correspondent through the problem, apologizing that the
telephone conversation would have to share his attention with a
hasty shave so that he could get to the airport.
   Many days, John Mulroy lived on airplanes.
   Last Wednesday he died on one.
   Mulroy, 59, director of international communications for the AP,
was one of 258 people killed aboard Pan Am Flight 103 when it
crashed into a village in southern Scotland, across the Irish Sea
from his native Ireland.
   His son Sean, 25, his daughter-in-law Ingrid, and three other
members of his family died with him.
   Airplane stories were part of the Mulroy lore. He was the
unflappable flier. He'd take his seat, make the sign of the cross,
and take a nap while the plane climbed to altitude.
   He caught the last plane out of Ankara in a March blizzard this
year, cheerful and joking through a flight that clipped a snowbank
on takeoff and bounced through gale force winds afterward.
   Heading from Tokyo to Moscow he looked down at Siberia. ``If we
have to go down here it will take them a long time to find us,'' he
told a colleague. ``And it's cold, too.''
   Mulroy, a 25-year veteran of Pan Am before he joined the AP 4 1@2
years ago, enjoyed flying.
   ``If you're in a vibrant, moving industry, it's always
pleasant,'' he said in an interview conducted for the AP employee
magazine on Nov. 30. ``Because you get off the plane and you know
there's something to be done and you've got to move forward. . .''
   For all the millions of miles he covered, Mulroy said he knew
nothing about jet lag. ``I can get on an airplane to sleep or to
work, one of the two. And I get off the airplane ready to go to work
again.''
   He spoke in what Lou Boccardi, president of the AP, called an
authoritative whisper. It was unmistakably Irish, a heritage that
was his pride. He was a naturalized U.S. citizen.
   Mulroy and his wife, Joan, sent their three children _ Sean,
Siobhan, 26, and Brendan, 23 _ back to Ireland to attend high
school. The family vacationed there each summer, in a house at
Cloongee, near Mulroy's birthplace.
   He'd built it for his father, a widower who raised six children
by himself. When his father died, it became Mulroy's Irish base.
He'd had it renovated and enlarged, and was planning to spend more
time there after he retired, although there were those who wagered
he wouldn't have retired anyhow.
   Mulroy's Roman Catholic faith was deeply held; he counted an
audience and brief conversation with Pope John Paul II one of the
high points of his life.
   In Seoul for the Olympics, he slipped away to attend Mass at a
Korean Church. ``I didn't understand a word of it, but it was
grand,'' he said.
   At the end of another Korean Mass, the priest switched to
English, greeted Mulroy and a colleague and asked them to stand.
Mulroy was up in an instant, nodding and smiling as 800 Korean
churchgoers applauded. He took the arm of his shy colleague and
pulled him up, too.
   A memorial Mass was being said Monday night at St. Francis of
Assisi Church in Greenlawn, on Long Island.
   After his quarter-century career at Pan Am, where he began as a
Long Island City ticket agent and became director of communications,
Mulroy joined the AP in August 1984.
   It quickly became part of his identity _ and vice versa. He was
known worldwide as the AP man. In Moscow, he joined all the toasts
but scrimped on the vodka. At the Great Wall of China, he
encountered a group of quigong masters, men studied in the Chinese
way of harnessing vital powers. He watched as four of them lifted
their teacher using only their thumbs. Then they lifted Mulroy,
although not very far.
   When bureaucrats and import restrictions got in the way of making
things work, he knew how to talk, cajole or smuggle his way around
them.
   His handshake was as firm _ crushing to some _ as his brogue was
hoarse and whispery. That low voice took on a different significance
to his colleagues only after his death, when they learned that he
had suffered from cancer and had a lung removed about six years ago,
before he joined the AP. He told no one; he didn't want it thought
that he was less than fit, or that he should ease his pace.
   He never did. Because his assignment was worldwide, time zones
meant nothing. The telephone rang at his home in East Northport, on
Long Island, at all hours. And Mulroy would answer, at 3 a.m., with
a sweetly Irish ``Good Morning.''
   One call came while he was in Ireland, fishing near his house.
His wife, Joan, called him in. Mulroy dealt with the problem. ``You
made me miss catching my dinner _ you owe me one,'' he said.
   He had that right. The AP and its people owed him more than one.
And the feeling was mutual. Mulroy was proud of his company and his
colleagues. Some he designated honorary Irishmen, among them Masaaki
Iwasa of Tokyo, and Francois Ghattas of Beirut and Nicosia.
   ``A small group, but the greatest bunch of talent I've ever
seen,'' Mulroy said of his AP associates in the Nov. 30 interview.
``Hours and time never seem to matter.''
   Mulroy set the standard. As he left an AP town, the words that
came just before goodbye were a litany:
   ``If you need anything at all, just let me know.''

<TEXT>
   Pope John Paul II will visit South
Korea in October 1989, but the Vatican said Monday that news reports
the pontiff planned to visit China and North Korea were ``all
speculation.''
   The South Korean news agency Yonhap quoted unidentified Roman
Catholic church sources as saying the pope would attend the 44th
International Eucharistic Congress in Seoul Oct. 5-8.
   It said the Vatican was trying to arrange for the pope to come to
South Korea from North Korea through Panmunjom, the truce village in
the Demilitarized Zone separating the two Koreas.
   The news agency quoted a church official, who asked not to be
identified, as saying the Vatican hoped the trip would ``ease
tension and promote peace on the divided Korean peninsula.''
   Vatican spokesman Joaquin Navarro said ``there is nothing
planned'' regarding a visit to either North Korea or China. He said
the pope intends to go to South Korea for a eucharistic congress,
but gave no details.
   Pope John Paul II visited South Korea in 1984 to commemorate the
200th anniversary of the Korean Catholic Church.

   Police on Monday found the bodies of five
bus passengers shot and killed by suspected Sikh militants in Punjab.
   The assailants on Sunday stopped a state-owned bus, ordered all
seven Hindu passengers to get off, and took them into the jungle.
   After a 30-hour search, police discovered the bodies of five
Hindus along with two seriously wounded passengers in the Mand area
of Punjab, said the area's police chief, Anil Kaushik.
   In another incident Monday, suspected Sikh militants shot and
killed five other people in Punjab, including a family of three.
   The militants have been blamed for more than 2,400 killings this
year in the northern state.
   Militant Sikhs have been fighting for an independent homeland in
Punjab since 1982, claiming discrimination by the Hindu community.
Sikhs form 2 percent of India's 880 million people, but are a
majority in Punjab.

   Police have arrested a Japanese for allegedly
smuggling 11 pounds of marijuana in lamp stands.
   Masatoshi Saito was arrested after returning from Manila Dec. 20
when a dog used by customs sniffed out the marijuana in the
pedestals of three lamp stands he was carrying, said a police
official at the New Tokyo International Airport at Narita.
   Saito, 38, told investigators he bought the stands at a
department store in Manila and did not know anything about the
marijuana, valued at $200,000, said the official.
   The maximum penalty for smuggling marijuana into Japan is seven
years in prison.

   Catherine Cassidy, 31, was hospitalized in critical condition
with burns, and her 32-year-old husband, John, suffered superficial

   The dead were identified as Lisa, 9, and her brothers, Jason, 6,
Keith, 4, and 18-month-old Graham.
   Firefighters said the blaze in this town about 12 miles southeast
of Dublin could have been caused by an electrical fault or an open

<HEAD>Handful of Western Publications to Be Sold Officially</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>

   Special kiosks in major cities will begin selling a
few hundred copies of Western newspapers and magazines beginning
Jan. 1, the Tass news agency said Monday.
   ``The fact that the new arrivals, which certainly cannot be
called `pro-Soviet,' will be sold here at all says a lot about
increased openness in the Soviet Union,'' the official news agency
said.
   But the small number of papers to be made available and the
average reader's lack of knowledge of English ensure that few people
will have access to the publications.
   Tass said among the publications to be sold from the special
kiosks will be The Guardian, The Times, and the Financial Times from
Britain, the International Herald Tribune, and the magazines Time
and Newsweek.
   Tass initially said 350 copies of The Guardian, and 400 copies of
the Financial Times and International Herald Tribune will be sold
daily. It did not say where besides Moscow they will be sold.
   The number of papers offered for sale are likely to increase, the
report said.
   Distribution of such publications have long been prohibited in
the Soviet Union on ideological grounds. But since the Moscow summit
between President Mikhail S. Gorbachev and President Reagan, a
limited number have been available at the Soviet Foreign Ministry's
press center.
   Access to the press center generally is limited to accredited
correspondents, so few people had the opportunity to buy the papers
there.

<HEAD>Official Daily Tells People to Prepare for Hard Years</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Chinese people must be prepared for two or
three hard years while the government imposes austerity measures to
battle economic problems, the Communist Party's official daily
newspaper said Monday.
   The masses must tighten their belts for the next few years as the
nation comes to grips with faltering agricultural production, high
inflation and overspending of public funds, the People's Daily said
in a front-page commentary.
   The editorial was the latest piece in the official media to
hammer home the seriousness of the economic crisis which has seen
inflation soar to 26 percent and industrial growth shoot up to an
unsustainable level of almost 20 percent.
   Although incomes as a whole are rising, surveys have shown that
up to 20 percent of urban residents report that their living
standards are declining as a result of the rise in retail prices.
   In September, the government announced a two-year economic
retrenchment plan under which the government will slash funding for
new construction projects, impose controls over credit, prices and
raw materials distribution, and slow the pace of market-oriented
reforms.
   The measures have had some small successes in cooling off the
economy, but have run into resistance from local authorities trying
to protect pet projects.
   ``The overheated economy can be cooled down and economic health
restored only when all departments consider the interests of the
whole and share the burden,'' the daily said.
   It said that although the economy looks very good as a result of
rapid economic expansion, ``there are in fact a lot of potential
dangers.''
   The foundation of the economy is weak, it said, with a large
population, inadequate natural resources and a shortage of funds.
``But many people have forgotten this.''
   New buildings continue to go up while some localities compete for
high economic growth and indiscriminately distribute big bonuses
among employees.
   ``Some people import goods blindly and spend foreign currency
without plan and some people eat and drink and spend money
extravagantly. ... If we don't cool down the overheated economy, it
will surely lead to crisis.''
   The daily said the need to live a hard life does not mean that
economic construction will be halted. Rather, there will be a shift
from dependence on increasing investment and expanding production to
reliance on improving management, upgrading technology and raising
economic efficiency.

<HEAD>North Korea Invites Radicals From South to Youth Festival</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   North Korea on Monday invited radical
students from South Korea to an international youth festival next
year in its capital, according to a North Korean letter.
   Officials said the letter was sent through the border village of
Panmunjom and addressed to South Korea's National Council of Student
Representatives, a radical student organization.
   The letter called for the two sides to meet at the border in
March to arrange the participation of South Korean students in the
13th World Festival of Youth and Students, to be held July 1-8 in
the North Korean capital of Pyongyang.
   In the invitation, North Korea characterized the international
festival as an event where students seeking the unification of the
divided peninsula can form a common movement.
   The peninsula was divided in 1945 at then end of World War II,
when Soviet and U.S. troops ended Japan's colonial rule.
   The quadrennial festival is a political, arts and sports event in
which most of the participants are from communist and Third World
nations. The last such festival was held in Moscow in 1985.
   Radical students said there was no reason to avoid ``our
participation in events in North Korea,'' but government officials
maintain that all dialogue with North Korea should be conducted
through government channels.
   South Korean officials said the radical students were invited to
strengthen anti-U.S. and anti-government activism.
   In June and August, police blocked thousands of radical students
who tried to stage a cross-country march to the border, where they
were to hold unification talks with North Korean students. The
police blockades triggered violent street protests.
   Radical students, a small but powerful minority on campuses, have
seized on national unification as part of their anti-government,
anti-U.S. strategy. But they have failed to garner strong public
support.
   North Korea in recent months has called for dialogue with Seoul
through various channels, but South Korean officials consider the
overtures as attempts to remove U.S. troops and cause social unrest.
   Dissident students are demanding the withdrawal of 42,000 U.S.
troops based in South Korea under a mutual defense treaty, saying
the United States has hampered unification.
   In preparation for the youth festival, North Korea is building
new hotels in Pyongyang with a capacity of 2,600 guests, the
official North Korean news agency reported Monday. The Korean
Central News Agency said one facility _ the 33-story Chongnyon Hotel
_ will have a glass roof, indoor and an outdoor swimming pools, a
movie theater, conference rooms, banquet halls and recreation
facilities.

<HEAD>Residents Return Home After Evacuation Due to Volcano</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hundreds of residents of a small Andean
town in southern Chile returned to their homes Monday after
authorities said the weekend eruption of a nearby volcano posed no
danger.
   The Lonquimay volcano near the town of Malalcahuello, 415 miles
south of Santiago, erupted Sunday for the first time in a century.
   Police said about half the population of Malalcahuello _
estimated at 500 to 800 _ had returned by Monday morning, while the
snow-capped, 8,400-foot volcano continued to spew smoke and lava
from three fissures near its base.
   ``The situation now is calm and under total control,'' said a
report by the national police force in Santiago. It said police
patrols were continuing to monitor the volcano by air and land.
   The provincial governor, army Gen. Alejandro Gonzalez, authorized
the return of Malalcahuello's residents after flying over the
volcano Sunday with experts from a regional university.
   Some residents remained at municipal buildings in the city of
Curacautin, 50 miles away, police said.
   The government's National Emergency Office, in announcing
Sunday's evacuation, called it ``just a precaution.'' It said some
residents also left Lolco, another town near the volcano.
   The volcano erupted through three separate craters near its base.
Police said the largest crater, with a diameter of around 130 feet,
continued to spew lava and thick smoke Monday.
   The eruption followed a series of earthquakes that rocked the
area during the past week. Flor Verdugo, a teacher who owns the only
telephone in Malalcahuello, said there were three heavy tremors
shortly before the eruption.
   Pedro Riffo, a volcano expert at the University of Temuco, the
largest city in the area, said the last registered eruption of the
Lonquimay occurred in 1889.
   He said Malalcahuello, the closest town to the volcano, is ringed
by a chain of mountains that serve as a natural defense wall.
   Riffo said three other volcanos exist in the area, but only one
of them, El Llaima, has shown actitvity in recent years.

   Eighty students who fled to remote rebel
camps following brutal suppression of a pro-democracy uprising
returned home Monday from Thailand aboard two Burmese air force
planes.
   About 7,000 students and others remained along the Thai-Burmese
border, where many have vowed to fight the Rangoon government
alongside ethnic minority rebels.
   The 80 students were repatriated after Burma asked the Thai
government for help in getting them back. They fled Rangoon and
other areas of the country following the Sept. 18 military coup by
Gen. Saw Maung.
   ``We don't know how to express our happiness to be back in Burma
after nearly three months of ordeal,'' said Saw Hla, a student from
Rangoon. The students along the border have been suffering from
malaria, poor nutrition and other hardships of jungle life.
   In a repatriation plan worked out during a visit Dec. 14 to Burma
by Thai army commander Gen. Chaovalit Yongchaiyudh, Saw Maung's
government reportedly pledged that returning students won't be
harmed. It also said Thai and Red Cross officials would be allowed
in to monitor the status of the returnees.
   The Rangoon government has given Dec. 31 as the deadline for
repatriation of the students but indicated it might give an
extension. The Thai government set up a transit camp at Tak, near
the Burmese border, where those intending to return are being housed.
   The majority of students who have sought refuge with the
insurgents have thus far spurned the repatriation offer. On
Saturday, they seized two Thai district officials who had gone to
persuade the students to return home, government sources in Thailand
said.
   The students arrived in Burma on Burmese air force planes which
were accompanied by two Thai aircraft carrying Thai journalists.
   Thirteen of the returning students were from Rangoon and were
reunited with their parents at a military camp. The others will be
sent to their home areas, government spokesman Kyaw Sann said.
   Sai Thiha, a headmaster at a primary school in eastern Burma,
said 36 students still remained behind at Tak, uncertain whether to
return. But Thai officials described the 36 as deserters from the
Burmese military and not students.
   There have been a number of unconfirmed reports that students who
had earlier returned on their own had disappeared and were presumed
killed by the authorities.
   Burma has been shunned by most of the world community since the
uprising, during which the military gunned down largely unarmed
demonstrators by the hundreds.

   Americans believe President Reagan has helped the
rich and hurt the poor, but a wide majority nonetheless approve of
his work in the White House, according to a national poll.
   Majorities in the Media General-Associated Press survey gave
negative grades to Reagan's social policies and ethics enforcement,
rated his judgment unfavorably and said they would not have
supported him for a third term.
   At the same time, an overwhelming two-thirds approved of the way
Reagan has done his job overall and said history will view him
positively, and 55 percent said he has bettered the nation.
   The telephone survey was conducted among a random sample of 1,084
adults shortly after last month's election. Reagan leaves office
Jan. 20.
   The poll found two factors at the heart of Reagan's popularity:
Wide belief that his economic policies have helped the nation and
high regard for his leadership. He also scored well on defense and
U.S.-Soviet relations.
   Reagan's ratings flagged elsewhere. While nearly two-thirds said
his economic policies have been good for the nation, for example, a
mighty 80 percent rated his handling of the budget deficit
negatively.
   Moreover, 54 percent said the poor are worse off economically as
a result of Reagan's policies, and 72 percent said wealthy Americans
are better off. Opinion was more divided on the middle class:
one-third called it worse off, a quarter said better off and the
rest saw little change.
   A third of respondents said they and their families were better
off as a result of Reagan's efforts, and 18 percent said worse off.
But they split evenly when asked to score Reagan's handling of the
economy, and more than twice as many picked the worst rating as
chose the best. The poll gave ``excellent'' or ``good'' as positive
choices, ``only fair'' or ``poor'' as negatives.
   Reagan received negative ratings for his handling of every social
issue posed: civil rights, 51 percent negative; education, 54
percent negative; housing, 65 percent negative, and welfare, 67
percent negative. Six in 10 rated him negatively on his handling of
ethics in government.
   In all these gauges Reagan fared worst among Democrats but also
was rated negatively by most independents. Majorities of Republicans
endorsed him on most issues but not on the deficit, welfare or
housing.
   On two other issues, he scored extraordinarily well: Seven in 10
rated him favorably for defense policies and eight in 10 rated him
positively on handling relations with the Soviets.
   Six in 10 viewed Reagan's other foreign policies favorably. The
poll was done before he opened contact with the Palestine Liberation
Organization this month.
   Even with his mixed policy ratings, six in 10 respondents ranked
Reagan positively for his accomplishments in office overall and
two-thirds rated his leadership ability as excellent or good. A full
three-quarters favorably rated his charisma and ability to
communicate.
   On his judgment as president, 53 percent rated him negatively.
But he was seen as effective: Six in 10 said he has accomplished
most of what he set out to do.
   On his effectiveness, as in many other issues, Reagan did best
with the youngest adults, age 18-29, and worst with the oldest, 65
and over. He also did considerably better with men than with women.
   Fifty-two percent said they would not have voted Reagan for a
third term if he were legally allowed to seek one _ down from 64
percent when the Media General-AP poll asked the question last
spring. Half the men polled, but just 37 percent of the women,
favored a third Reagan term.
   The survey, conducted Nov. 10-20, has a margin of error of plus
or minus three percentage points.

<HEAD>Despite Peace Appeals, Black Factions Continue Fighting in Natal</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID CRARY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   There was no Christmas lull in
the fighting between black factions in Natal Province, despite a
peace appeal from Archbishop Desmond Tutu, and police said nine more
blacks have died in the country's worst conflict.
   Most died from stab wounds in six separate incidents Sunday in
the troubled province. A dozen homes were set afire, 17 people were
injured, and police used tear gas to break up two street battles.
   More than 1,000 blacks have been killed in Natal in the past two
years in the feuding between supporters of militant anti-apartheid
groups and members of Inkatha, a more moderate movement led by Zulu
politician Mangosuthu Buthelezi.
   Tutu, the 1984 Nobel Peace Prize laureate who heads southern
Africa's Anglican Church, last week deplored the violence in this
southeastern province.
   ``When we are meant to be celebrating the birth of the Prince of
Peace, the killing looks as though it is escalating,'' the black
archbishop said. ``In such a situation it is easy to be dispairing.
Calling for peace can seem a meaningless ritual.''
   Black leaders had expressed optimism in September, when officials
of Inkatha and the Congress of South African Trade Unions signed a
peace pact in the Natal provincial capital, Pietermaritzburg. The
militant labor federation is allied with the banned United
Democratic Front _ an umbrella organization for anti-apartheid
groups _ in the power struggle against Inkatha.
   The agreement condemned violence and established a board to
review residents' complaints of harassment or attacks.
   The pact remains in effect, but has had limited success. Some
witnesses have been afraid to testify and many supporters of the
United Democratic Front, which is banned from holding meetings, felt
they were not consulted about the agreement.
   This month, increasing violence has further dimmed the hopes
raised by the peace pact. On Dec. 3, gunmen fired into a house in
Trust Feed, a black community near Pietermaritzburg, and killed 11
people, including children, who were holding an all-night vigil for
a child who had died.
   News reports initially blamed Inkatha for the massacre. Buthelezi
later claimed the victims were Inkatha members and threatened to sue
anyone who blamed his organization.
   On Dec. 17, residents of Caluza, also near Pietermaritzburg, said
Inkatha members rampaged through town, killing three people and
damaging dozens of homes while police stood by.
   Police officials deny any partiality in the conflict.
   Tutu, in his peace appeal, raised the issue of police bias.
   ``I am very disturbed to hear reports that people do not perceive
the police as a force which protects them, but rather as a group
which favors those who claim allegiance to the Inkatha movement,''
he said.
   The country's largest-selling black daily newspaper, The Sowetan,
said in a recent editorial the ``reign of terror'' in Natal was ``a
shame and a disgrace.''
   Both Inkatha, which claims 1.5 million members, and the United
Democratic Front oppose the apartheid policies under which South
Africa's 5 million whites dominate the 26 million blacks, who have
not voice in national affairs. But the strategies of the two groups
differ markedly.
   The front, a predominantly black coalition of about 600 groups,
advocates economic sanctions, strikes and other confrontational
tactics to bring about sweeping political and economic change.
   Inkatha, which opposes sanctions and shuns militant protest,
accuses the front of supporting the violence of the outlawed African
National Congress, the largest guerrilla group fighting the
government.

are not necessarily mired in delays and red tape.
   ``There are already dividends after only one year,'' said Frans
Moens of the Antwerp Plastic Merchandising Co.
   Moens, holding a bouquet of red plastic roses, said Antwerp
Plastic controls one of Europe's oldest producers of plastic flowers
_ Italy's Alma Rose SpA _ which was approached last year by the
Soviets.
   Alma Rose had long wanted to be a trailblazer with the Soviets.
Since the early 1970s, it offered its services ``but always met a
`nyet' (Leonid) Brezhnev-style,'' said Moens, referring to the
former Soviet leader.
   But things moved quickly with the emergence of Mikhail S.
Gorbachev and his program for economic reform.
   Talks started in March 1987, and six months later the $40 million
joint venture Sovplastital was founded. A Soviet state company holds
78 percent of the shares, with the remainder held by Alma Rose. On
the board of directors, however, parity reigns.
   Key to doing successful business with the Soviets, said Moens,
was setting up an all-encompassing business plan. ``The Soviets
rigorously stick to the plan but absolutely everything has to be in
it,'' he said. He compared this with the more practical approach of
European businesses.
   For Tashkent, the Soviets wanted machines, materials and the
know-how to refine the plastic products while gaining an export
market to earn them foreign currency.
   Antwerp Plastic and Alma Rose gained a new production unit _
where wages are still low _ and a market of 280 million potential
customers. ``The market is simply enormous and still has to be
claimed,'' said Moens.
   An Antwerp Plastic official, who demanded anonymity, also said
Alma Rose wanted to reduce production in Italy ``because of the many
(labor) strikes. That is not the case in the Soviet Union.''
   The factory in Tashkent employs 800 workers and plans to add 300
soon, Moens said.
   The plastic wares, including flowers, hot-colored pots in the
shape of pears and apples and plates of intertwined fake leaves, are
mainly sold domestically through state shops. But the joint venture
already has set up Western-style shops in Tashkent and Moscow.
   Moens said the mayor of Leningrad also made inquiries about a
shop.
   As the first Belgian company involved in a Soviet joint venture,
Antwerp Plastic often is asked for information. About six companies,
mostly in the chemical sector, are negotiating, but no deals have
come through.

<HEAD>New Ideology Chief Criticizes Press, Informal Organizations</HEAD>

   The Kremlin ideology chief in a speech published
Monday attacked some state-run publications for sensationalism and a
lack of regard for facts under President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's
policy of greater openness.
   Vadim A. Medvedev, who was named to the ruling Communist Party
Politburo by Gorbachev in September and immediately given control
over ideology and propaganda, also indicated there would be no
lessening of control over the mass media.
   ``People are concerned about hysteria, sensationalism, the
destructive direction of some statements, the inciting of passions,
lack of regard for the facts, a deficit of professionalism,'' and
other tendencies in the Soviet press, Medvedev said in a speech to
local party officials in Kazan.
   ``The mass media must obey general laws, develop in the framework
of the laws of socialist government,'' he said. A new law on the
press is being written, but ``no law can take away the civic
position, the party responsibility of the leaders of the mass media,
of our entire journalistic body.''
   His comments at the Dec. 23-24 conference were published Monday
by the Communist Party newspaper Pravda.
   State-controlled press and publishers have used the new
atmosphere of greater freedom under Gorbachev to publish material
that were not acceptable or were banned for years under Gorbachev's
predecessors.
   But since taking control over the party's ideology and propaganda
apparatus, Medvedev also has signaled that ``glasnost,'' the policy
of greater openness, has definite limits.
   On Nov. 29, Medvedev told a news conference that he opposed
publication of works by exiled writer Alexander Solzhenitsyn because
they would undermine Soviet society. Some writers, artists and
activists in informal political groups have been clamoring for
publication of works by the Nobel-prize winning author who was
stripped of his citizenship and exiled in 1974.
   Medvedev's speech was one of a series published by Pravda on
Monday by top party leaders at regional conferences reviewing local
party membership in accord with a directive from the June Communist
Party conference to cleanse party rolls of people who were standing
in the way of Gorbachev's reform policies.
   Medvedev also criticized party and government traditionalists,
who he said were standing in the way of Gorbachev' reforms. He said
the party was trying to steer a course between extremists who wanted
no reform and those who wanted too much, too fast.
   His statement contrasted with a speech in the Ural Mountains city
of Perm two weeks ago by Politburo member Alexander N. Yakovlev, who
emphasized the need for more democracy and openness.
   ``Democracy, glasnost and differences of opinion still frighten
us, as if every one of us constantly lives in agreement with himself
and always thinks in comfortable cliches,'' said Yakovlev,
considered the Politburo member closest to Gorbachev. ``Can you
really call a person a person if he doesn't have his own opinions?''
Yakovlev asked.
   Pravda said Medvedev's comments on the Soviet media referred to a
few publications it did not identify. But they most likely referred
to the handful of journals and newspapers that have been pushing the
frontiers of Gorbachev's glasnost policy to publish revelations
about Soviet history and social problems that previously never would
have surfaced in the official press.
   Leading those publications are the weeklies Ogonyok and Moscow
News. More conservative publications continue to publish less
controversial material, except for several instances in which open
disputes have broken out in the pages of the official media between
progressive and traditional papers.
   The accusation that some publications were inciting passions also
was likely aimed at local newspapers in the Baltic republics and in
the southern republics of Armenia and Azerbaijan.
   In both places the official media accused local media of adding
to ethnic rather than quieting it.
   Medvedev also served notice on informal political organizations
that have sprung up outside the Communist Party that they will be
tolerated only as long as they do not run counter to party policy.
   Medvedev said the informal groups are a ``natural part of the
process of restructuring.'' Some people, he said, are using a
``healthy process for establishing and movement of anti-socialist
goals.''
   ``Our main criterion for determining relations with autonomous
organizations is their correspondence with the goals of
restructuring, ideological renewal, socialist choice,'' he said.

   A strong earthquake shook the northwestern
province of Gansu on Monday but no casualties or damage were
reported, the official Xinhua News Agency said.
   Xinhua said the quake measured 5.1 on the Richter scale,
indicating a quake capable of causing considerable damage in a
populated area.
   It said the quake struck at 3:46 p.m. (2:46 a.m EST) and was
centered in Linze county about 280 miles northwest of the Gansu
capital of Lanzhou.
   An earthquake Nov. 6 in southwestern China's Yunnan province
killed 730 people, the highest toll of any quake in China this
decade.
   The Richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on
seismographs. Every increase of one number means a tenfold increase
in magnitude. Thus a reading of 7.5 reflects an earthquake 10 times
stronger than one of 6.5.
   An earthquake of 3.5 on the Richter scale can cause slight damage
in the local area, 4 moderate damage, 5 considerable damage, 6
severe damage. A 7 reading is a ``major'' earthquake, capable of
widespread heavy damage; 8 is a ``great'' quake, capable of
tremendous damage.

<HEAD>National Assembly to Consider Limiting President's Tenure</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ANNIE HUANG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The National Assembly, Taiwan's electoral
college, said Monday it will consider a request from President Lee
Teng-hui that would limit the number of terms a president can hold.
   Lee, 65, proposed the change Sunday when the National Assembly
convened a special three-day session to commemorate the anniversary
of the adoption of the Nationalist constitution on Dec. 25, 1947.
   Under the constitution, a president is limited to two consecutive
six-year terms. The clause was revised by an emergency decree in
1960 that allowed Nationalist leader Chiang Kai-shek to serve as
president until his death in 1975. Chiang was president for 27 years.
   He was later succeeded by his son, Chiang Ching-kuo, who served
10 years before he died earlier this year. The younger Chiang was
succeeded by Lee, who is serving out the remainder of Chiang's term,
which expires in May 1990.
   The Nationalists retreated to Taiwan in 1949 after losing a civil
war to the communists in mainland China. Both the Nationalists and
communist Chinese maintain they are the legitimate government of
both Taiwan and China.
   The emergency decree extending the presidential term was passed
at a time of heightened tension between the rival Chinese
governments.
   Before his death, Chiang Ching-kuo initiated democratic reforms
that included a more lenient Nationalist policy toward the
communists. Lee has vowed to continue the policy.
   He told the National Assembly a limited presidential term would
make the government ``more responsive to the public's demand for
democracy.''
   Members of the opposition Democratic Progressive Party, who
disrupted Sunday's session, wants the emergency decree abolished
because they say it gives the president too much power.
   Lee, the first native Taiwanese to head the Nationalist
government, gave no indication what limit to the presidential term
he supports, but observers say he is likely to back the two-term
presidency.
   Of the 894 members of the National Assembly, 768 belong to the
governing Nationalist Party. Lee, who is chairman of the party, is
expected to be a candidate for election to his first full term as
president in 1990.

   As the Eiffel Tower turns 100 years old, two other
world-renowned towers will turn on their flashiest smiles in tribute.
   At their respective midnights on New Year's Eve, Japan's Tower of
Tokyo and New York's Empire State Building will switch on new
illuminations and dedicate the ceremonies to the 984-foot tower
completed in 1889 by engineer Gustave Eiffel for the Paris Universal
Exposition.
   The tributes will be the first event scheduled in the centennial
commemoration of the Eiffel Tower.
   Other towers in Toronto, British Telecom's edifice in London, and
the Olympic towers in Calgary and Munich also will beam their
recognition of the tower that has become the symbol of the French
capital.
   ``Since the time of the Pyramids and the Tower of Babel, towers
have always fascinated people,'' said Grazyna Szczesniak, of the
Eiffel Tower Society. ``It is as if the highest points in the world
give a different vision of humanity and communicate in a special
way.''

<HEAD>Takeshita to Reshuffle Embattled Cabinet</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ELAINE KURTENBACH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita is expected to
announce a Cabinet reshuffle this week after months of bitter
parliamentary battles over controversial tax reform and a
stock-profiteering scandal.
   ``An annual reshuffle of Cabinet posts is a firmly established
custom in Japan,'' said Seizaburo Sato, a political science
professor at Tokyo University. Only 20 portfolios are available, he
said, and prime ministers are expected to rotate senior parliament
members through key posts at regular intervals.
   Takeshita has said he would announce changes in his Cabinet
sometime this month. He is expected to do so soon after Parliament
ends its current extraordinary session Tuesday.
   Press reports, quoting unidentified sources, said Takeshita
probably would retain those in top Cabinet posts, such as Foreign
Minister Sousuke Uno and Shintaro Abe, secretary-general of the
governing Liberal Democratic Party.
   ``Mr. Takeshita doesn't want to upset the status quo. He'll keep
most important figures, but there is a very strong push for some
change,'' Sato said.
   Takeshita's administration has been under fire for the
involvement of top party leaders in the Recruit Cosmos stock
scandal, in which influential figures profited from sales of stock
bought at bargain prices before the shares were publicly listed.
Takeshita's name is among those linked to the scandal.
   Opposition parties demanding a thorough inquiry into the scandal
held up debate on tax reform until Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa
resigned to take responsibility for an aide's involvement in the
stock deals, which were legal although the ethics involved were
questioned.
   Even then, the path was rough for Japan's first tax overhaul
since 1949.
   Public and political opposition already had delayed tax reform
for a decade, and Takeshita made it a top priority when he assumed
office in November 1987. Opposition foot-dragging left him with the
choice of abandoning the bills or forcing them through.
   On Saturday, the Liberal Democratic Party used its commanding
parliamentary majority to enact a tax package that introduces a 3
percent sales tax and cuts corporate and upper-bracket income taxes.
   Immediately after the bills were passed, Takeshita named one of
the architects of the tax reform, Tatsuo Murayama, as his new
finance minister. Takeshita himself had been acting finance minister
since Dec. 9, when Miyazawa resigned.
   Approval ratings for the Takeshita administration have plummeted
over its handling of the stock scandal and tax package. Takeshita's
tax victory was greeted with a chorus of criticism from the local
press.
   ``The pattern of the ruling party steamrolling its bills'' and
stalling tactics by the opposition have been repeated so often
``that it goes to show just how `sick' Japanese politics have
become,'' said the national newspaper Asahi Shimbun.
   In an unusually vehement editorial, the English-language Japan
Times said, ``The whole process leading up to (passage of the tax
bill) has illustrated in a disgusting way how arrogant the
government party has become ... how deeply tainted by money the
nation's politics is, how unprincipled many politicians and some
political parties are.''
   The Liberal Democratic Party said tax reform was needed to
eliminate inequities in the tax burdens of salaried wage earners and
the self-employed. Opposition critics maintain, however, that the
tax bill will do little to eliminate unfairness or close tax
loopholes.
   In addition to establishing the sales tax, Takeshita's tax
package slashes duties on imported liquor and automobiles, reduces
the basic corporate tax rate from 42 percent to 37.5 percent and
cuts the maximum income tax rate from 60 percent to 50 percent.
   ``The most affected will again be pensioners and those in
lower-income brackets and salaried consumers ... (who) will have to
pay more for food and other daily necessities covered by the new
tax,'' the Japan Times said.

<TEXT>
   Security forces arrested 57 Moslem
fundamentalist students suspected of anti-state activities and are
searching for another 50, police sources said Monday.
   Detainees were seized as they distributed leaflets attacking
President Hosni Mubarak and Interior Minister Zaki Badr, who handles
internal security, according to the sources, who spoke on condition
of anonymity. The leaflets demanded the release of other detained
students.
   About 300 people thought to be Moslem extremists have been
rounded up this month in this city 230 miles south of Cairo, the
sources said. Most were students from Assiut University.
   It coincided with an anti-extremist crackdown in Cairo and other
cities in which about 500 people have been arrested.
   The operation is being carried out under an emergency law enacted
immediately after Moslem extremists assassinated President Anwar
Sadat in Cairo on Oct. 6, 1981.
   Informants said security forces were searching for another 50
Assiut University students who fled the city.
   For almost a decade, Assiut has been a center of agitation by
Moslem fundamentalists demanding immediate implementation, by
violence if necessary, of the stringent Islamic legal and social
code known as Sharia.
   Assiut University, which has about 50,000 students, has seen
frequent clashes between fundamentalist students and police and
between rival moderate and extremist factions of the Moslem zealots.
About 100 students were injured in one inter-student clash at the
beginning of this month.
   Badr said last week there are about 825 extremist students at the
university.
   The minister also said extremists had desecrated 25 of the
nation's 70,000 mosques by using them to store arms and trade in
drugs to finance their activities.

   Thousands of Chinese youths chanting ``Kill the
black ghosts!'' surrounded a train station Monday where more than
130 African students were holed up after three days of racial
clashes, American witnesses said.
   The Americans _ students in the central China city of Nanking _
also reported another attack by stone-throwing Chinese on a foreign
student dormitory.
   The Xinhua news agency said officials later persuaded the
Africans to leave the train station and go back to their Hehai
University dormitories.
   A Chinese witness, however, said police forced the students out
of the station, carrying some of them. He said four U.S. students
with the Africans also were forced onto buses and taken away.
   The Chinese mob of about 5,000 remained outside the station,
according to the witnesses, who spoke on condition of anonymity in
telephone interviews.
   A Xinhua report said two Africans and 11 Chinese employees of
Hehai University were hurt in the clashes, including one Chinese
with a serious head injury.
   Officials denied a Chinese student allegation that one of their
number died in violence Saturday night.
   About 135 African students had holed up in the foreigners' lounge
of the train station. Train traffic apparently continued normally.
   The Africans had fled their campus and planned to board a train
for Beijing to complain at their embassies after Chinese students
bombarded their dormitories with bottles and stones Saturday night
and Sunday.
   Violent clashes between Chinese and African students have been
reported in several Chinese cities in recent years. The Africans say
they are the targets of racism, a charge Chinese officials deny.
   The fighting in Nanking began during a Christmas Eve school
dance, Xinhua said. Two African students escorting Chinese women to
the dance refused to register the women's names at the campus gate,
as is customary, the news agency said.
   Other Africans forced open the gate and attacked school workers,
teachers and students with sticks, bottles and rocks, Xinhua said.
   The Africans soon were surrounded by thousands of angry Chinese
students who attacked their dormitories, according to one African
student at Hehai. He said the attack lasted from 10 p.m. Saturday
until 5 a.m. Sunday and resumed Sunday afternoon.
   ``The crowd trapped us inside the buildings,'' he said.
   About 4,000 Chinese youths marched Sunday to two other Nanking
universities where Africans are studying, and stoned their
dormitories.
   Chinese students who surrounded the station Sunday evening
claimed one of their number was killed, the American said.
   Su Xiaxin, a government official in Jiangsu province where
Nanking is located, denied that anyone was killed.
   He said he did not know the whereabouts of the African students
but that they were in no danger. He said he also did not know what
police were doing to control the Chinese crowd at the station.
   Earlier Monday, about 400 Chinese students marched to a foreign
student dormitory at Nanking University, shouted to the foreigners
to come out, and threw a few stones, an American student said. He
said the Chinese were distributing pamphlets calling for redress of
the ``insult to our (Chinese) race.''
   The American said there had been several disagreements lately
between African students at Hehai and school administrators. In one
incident, he said, school officials tried to build a wall around the
African students' dorms but the students tore it down.
   China long has offered scholarships to black African students to
cement ties with their governments.
   But social relations always have been strained, especially if
African students try to date Chinese women.

   Israeli paratroopers killed three guerrillas
Monday in a clash several yards north of the Israel-Lebanon border,
the army and Israel armed forces radio said.
   The Israeli troops sustained no casualties.
   In Beirut, the radical Fatah-Revolutionary Council, headed by
reputed terrorist Abu Nidal, said the guerrillas had crossed the
border into northern Israel before dawn and ``wiped out a unit of
Israeli guards'' in a shootout that lasted several hours.
   An Israeli patrol spotted the guerrilla squad during the night in
the area of Meiss El-Jabal village, several yards north of the
border, and opened fire, killing the three guerrillas, the Israeli
army command said.
   Soldiers found Soviet-designed Kalashnikov rifles, ammunition,
anti-tank rocket launchers, leaflets and other equipment near the
bodies of the guerrillas, the army said.
   It gave no other details. Israel army radio said the soldiers who
took part in the clash were from the elite paratrooper brigade and
that the guerrillas apparently were on their way to stage a
hostage-taking operation in Israel.
   The clash was in Israel's self-proclaimed security zone, a six-to
10-mile-wide buffer strip north of the border carved out in 1985
when it withdrew the bulk of its troops from Lebanon.
   The zone is patrolled by Israeli soldiers and the South Lebanon
Army, an Israeli-backed, mostly Christian militia.
   The Fatah-Revolutionary Council communique did not say what
happened to the infiltrators.
   Lebanese police said four other guerrillas of the Popular
Struggle Front apparently were heading for Israel when their rubber
dinghy ran aground near the coastal town of Jiye, 15 miles south of
Beirut. Three guerrillas drowned and one surrendered to Syrian
troops at a checkpoint near Jiye, police said.
   The two incidents suggested that radical factions opposed to
Palestine Liberation Organization chairman Yasser Arafat were bent
on escalating their warfare against Israel, possibly to scuttle
Arafat's recent peace overtures.
   Fatah-Revolutionary Council and the Popular Struggle Front are
among the splinter groups that have rejected Arafat's explicit
recognition of Israel and the PLO's dialogue with the United States.

<HEAD>Prime Minister, Unions Agree To Discuss Differences</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MADRID, Spain (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Socialist Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez and
leaders of Spain's two biggest trade unions agreed Monday to new
talks to resolve differences that led to a paralyzing nationwide
strike.
   Gonzalez announced he agreed to form a ``socio-economic council''
with the unions to study five demands they made after the Dec. 15
general work stoppage.
   ``I hope this will continue to be a habit, a future custom above
all, if we are able to institutionalize a forum for dialogue,''
Gonzalez told a news conference after meeting leaders of the
Socialist General Workers Unions and the Communist Workers
Commissions.
   Antonio Gutierrez, secretary-general of the communist union, said
the meeting was worthwhile, but ``more progress could have been
made.''
   Union demands include increased wages for civil servants and
pensioners hurt by an unexpected rise in inflation, unemployment
insurance for more workers, and collective bargaining provisions for
civil servants.
   Gonzalez already has agreed to a demand he withdraw a government
plan to spur youth employment, which included reducing minimum wages
for those under 25.
   In a Dec. 21 address to parliament, he also said bowing to the
unions' demand to extend government unemployment insurance to cover
48 percent of Spain's 2.7 million jobless was ``impossible'' because
``neither the budget nor the economy could stand it.''
   Gonzalez told legislators that Spanish civil servants had union
rights equal to those in other European countries, making the
collective bargaining demand unnecessary.
   He urged the unions to negotiate with the government to ensure
the country maintains its 5 percent annual growth rate.
   Monday's four-hour meeting was the first encounter between
representatives of government and organized labor since the Dec. 14
strike in which 7.8 million of 11.8 million employed Spaniards
stayed home to call for a bigger share of benefits from the booming
economy.
   The two labor leaders boycotted a Dec. 22 meeting called by
Gonzalez because they objected to the presence of the head of the
country's main employers' association.
   After Monday's meeting, the socialist union's Secretary-General
Nicolas Redondo said he expected most negotiations to be limited to
government and union representatives.
   ``For certain concrete issues the business leaders could attend.
But not when we are trying to formulate a progressive employment
policy,'' he said.
   Labor leaders accuse the Socialist government of siding with a
thriving business community while abandoning workers still suffering
wage restrictions and other concessions the unions made to help
transform Spain's once-sluggish economy.
   Since the Socialists first won a parliamentary majority in 1982,
annual inflation has been cut from more than 14 percent to just over
5 percent. But unemployment remains the highest in Europe at 18.7
percent.

<DATELINE>VIENNA, Austria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Communist Party newspaper in Albania
has made an unusually strong attack on Serbian nationalism in a
province of Yugoslavia dominated by ethnic Albanians, an official
report said.
   In an article Sunday, the daily Zeri i Popullit said Yugoslavia
always has been split by the desire of the southern Slavs to unite
under Serbian domination, according to the ATA Albanian news agency,
monitored in Vienna.
   Serb nationalists have staged mass demonstrations this year
demanding more control over their medieval heartland of Kosovo, a
province bordering Albania and dominated by ethnic Albanians.
   Serbs, the largest of more than 20 ethnic groups in Yugoslavia,
charge that Albanians in Kosovo _ who have staged anti-Serbian
protests _ want to secede from the Yugoslav federation and unite
with Albania.
   But Zeri i Popullit said the ethnic Albanians' revolt stems from
a desire to be treated as equals in Yugoslavia. The Albanians say
they are being harassed by the Serbs, and demand that their
Serbian-controlled province be made a separate republic.
   Yugoslavia is a federation of six republics and two autonomous
provinces constituted after the communists took power following
World War II.

   A ranking North Korean delegation headed
by Foreign Minister Kim Yong Nam arrived in Tehran on Monday for
talks on political and economic cooperation, Tehran television
reported.
   Kim said he was in Iran to expand ties and focus on economic
affairs, especially reconstruction, according to the broadcast,
monitored in Nicosia.
   Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati and Reconstruction
Minister Gholamreza Forouzesh greeted the delegation, which included
External Economic Affairs Minister Chung Son Nam, the TV report said.
   Chung said the talks will touch on the construction of dams, and
rebuilding urban areas, damaged in the eight-year war with Iraq. A
U.N.-sponsored cease-fire halted the war on Aug. 20.
   The official Islamic Republic News Agency, also monitored in
Nicosia, reported Sunday that Iran signed an economic accord with
North Korea.
   Under the terms of the agreement Iran will export 80,000 tons of
concentrated lead, 250,000 tons of zinc and 200,000 tons of
industrial salts to the Asian country, in exchange for 200,000 tons
of steel bars and other metals.

   Assailants with axes killed a state
legislator and two other people in a southern city Monday, and at
least 20 died when mobs angered by the deaths rampaged and set fire
to buildings, news reports said.
   Thirteen people died and more than 100 were injured in the riots
in Vijayawada, about 850 miles southeast of New Delhi. Police opened
fire into the crowds, killing at least four other people, the
reports said.
   The army and paramilitary troops were deployed in Vijayawada to
help police restore order. Authorities imposed a 24-hour curfew on
the city of 500,000 people, and police were ordered to shoot at
rioters, the reports said.
   Rioting began after the slaying of Mohan Ranga Rao, a state
legislator of Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi's Congress Party.
   Ranga Rao, 48, went on a hunger strike Thursday, saying he was
protesting police oppression, said Press Trust of India without
elaborating. News reports said Ranga Rao and some of his supporters
had set up a camp in the city.
   Vijayawada is in Andhra Pradesh state, which is governed by the
opposition Telegu Desam Party.
   Assailants armed with axes threw smoke bombs and then attacked
and killed the lawmaker and two of his supporters, according to
Press Trust of India.
   Other supporters attacked the assailants as they fled, and two
people were killed, the news agency said. It did not identify the
victims.
   Angry Congress Party supporters responded by setting fire to
buses, movie houses, hotels, shops and a newspaper office in
Vijaywada, United News of India said. It said rioting also was
reported in the towns of Tenali, Tadapalligudam, Eluru,
Visakhapatnam and Hyderabad, the state capital.
   Congress supporters set fire to three buses in Hydebarad and
attacked homes owned by relatives of Chief Minister N.T. Rama Rao,
the news agency said.

   Crews today rescued nearly 300
holiday passengers stranded after their 18-car Amtrak train derailed
in a rugged canyon during a snowstorm, authorities said.
   No injuries were reported among the 294 passengers and
approximately 15 crew members Christmas night when the California
Zephyr went off the tracks in Glenwood Canyon, about 10 miles east
of here and 150 miles west of Denver.
   ``I felt something shift. The train was going 30 miles per
hour,'' said passenger Mike Mettert of Greenwood, Ind. ``The train
stopped and squealed. We felt a few bumps, and there we were.''
   A work train pulling seven cabooses brought the passengers and
crew to Glenwood Springs, where they were put in hotels, said John
Jacobsen, Amtrak's director of public affairs.
   ``Some of them were just glad to be here. Others were angry and
they felt like Amtrak should compensate them,'' said Janet Muttillo,
night auditor at the Hotel Denver in Glenwood Springs.
   The 15 cars and two locomotives on the Amtrak train landed
upright next to the tracks in the canyon, which rises above the
Colorado River, Jacobsen said from his Washington, D.C., home today.
A third locomotive remained on the tracks.
   The derailment was caused by a warped track, Jacobsen said.
   ``The rail spread apart enough to cause the wheels to drop into a
ridge between the rails,'' he said. ``The wheels dropped down
between the rails and that's what kept it upright. The train
couldn't move because it was locked into place by the rail.''
   ``We know what happened, not why it happened,'' he said.
   It was ``snowing like the dickens'' at the time of the accident,
a sheriff's dispatcher said, and there was about a foot of snow at
the derailment site.
   Until they were evacuated, passengers remained on the train,
which briefly lost its heat and light, said Glenwood Springs Police
Sgt. Terry Gallant.
   ``It's still coupled together and upright. I imagine they'll have
it back on the track before the day's out,'' Jacobsen said. ``I have
no doubt there is some damage to it. Any time you take a turn and
get it off the rail, there's some damage to the wheels. I suspect
the damage will be very minor.''
   One passenger, an unidentified 63-year-old California woman, was
taken to Valley View Hospital as a precaution, but was released
after it was determined she was in good condition, nursing
supervisor Carol Davis said.
   The derailment occurred just after 9 p.m. The train's most recent
stop was Denver and its next stop was to be Salt Lake City. From
there, it would have split, carrying passengers to Los Angeles, San
Francisco and Seattle.
   Traffic moved through the canyon on a parallel track, said Tony
Marzano, chief transportation officer with the Denver and Rio Grande
Railroad, on which the train was traveling.

<HEAD>16 Suspected Coup Plotters Arrested</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sixteen military men and civilians
arrested for plotting a coup had planned to assassinate top
politicians and take over the armed forces command on Dec. 8, the
Sudan News Agency said Monday.
   The state agency quoted a source at the army's general command as
saying alleged plotters loyal to deposed President Gaafar Nimeiri
had a two-part plan.
   One group was to assassinate political leaders, including
civilian Prime Minister Sadek el-Mahdi, while another occupied vital
and strategic departments such as the army general command and the
radio station.
   He did not say if others were suspected in the plot. Those
arrested still were being interrogated and no charges had been put
yet, he said.
   The military source said Dec. 7 alleged ringleader Lt. Col.
Hassan Mohammed Ahmed Nasr told his associates that Dec. 8 was zero
hour, but that they would have problems securing fuel.
   Gasoline is rationed in Sudan and car owners have to queue for
several hours for their weekly supply.
   The source said Nasr recruited an army depot worker to supply the
fuel, but the coup plotters were arrested before they could make
their move.
   Nine of the 16 arrested are military men, he said, including a
retired major general, two retired brigadiers, five non-commissioned
officers and Lt. Col. Nasr. He said another 1st Lt. Mohammed
Suleiman still is at large.
   The rest are politicians and other civilians who worked in
Nimeiri's dissolved state security and special guards forces.
   Nimeiri was ousted April 5, 1985, by the military, who handed
power to a democratically elected government in 1986.
   Nimeiri was stranded in Cairo, Egypt, and has remained there
since. He is not allowed any political activities by his Egyptian
hosts and there has not been any evidence linking him to the aborted
coup.
   In a separate development, the government Monday imposed huge
price increases on sugar, cigarettes and other commodities, just two
days after announcing salary increases for workers in both public
and private sectors.
   Information Minister Abdulla Mohammed Ahmed announced the
increases in a statement published by the state news agency.
   From Tuesday, the price of a pound of sugar was increased more
than 600 percent from 4.3 cents to 26 cents. Prices of imported and
locally produced cigarettes were increased by 50 percent. In
addition, the government imposed a 15 percent tax on all locally
manufactured commodities.
   On Saturday, Prime Minister Sadek Mahdi announced pay increases
of between 500 percent and 50 percent for all workers on a sliding
scale so lowest paid workers get the biggest increases.
   Although Sudan produces more sugar than it needs, there are
continuous shortages fueled by smuggling to neighbouring countries
like Uganda, Zaire, Chad and Ethiopia, where the sweetener costs a
lot more. On the black market in Khartoum, a pound of sugar now
costs between 43 and 61 cents.
   Ahmed said the government hopes the higher price will ration
consumption and combat smuggling.

   Michael Jackson whirled and twirled his way Monday
through a show billed in the Japanese press as a ``farewell
concert'' but made no mention of retiring.
   Jackson spoke to the audience only briefly during the two-hour
show, the ninth and final concert of his current stand in Tokyo,
saying: ``Domo arigato (thank you) to everyone in Japan'' and ``I
love you, Japan.''
   In August, Jackson's manager, Frank Dileo, said the tour probably
would be Jackson's last. He said Jackson, 30, would go on to ``do
movies and other things.''
   Tokyo was supposed to be the final stop on the 14-month,
four-continent tour. But three shows in Los Angeles that were
canceled last month because Jackson had throat problems have been
rescheduled for next month.
   After Dileo's comments, newspapers dubbed the Tokyo appearances
Jackson's ``farewell concerts'' and promoters sold T-shirts and hats
emblazoned with that slogan.
   The nine concerts _ 450,000 tickets in all in the 50,000-seat
Tokyo Dome _ were quick sellouts.
   ``It's going to be lonely without Michael. It's as though his
life is over,'' said Yuriko Wada, an office worker from Kyoto who
attended the concert.

about husband Corbin Bernsen.
   In the January issue of Self magazine, Ms. Pays of ``Max

   He said family life is a top priority, but he remains committed
to his work.
   ``Next to Amanda, my greatest passion is my work, but what I do
get jealous about is her ability to do more quality things because
of her classical nature,'' he said. ``People are willing to pay me
to do a physical comedy, but I want to be able to do a passionate

   Richard Carpenter says he still doesn't
understand the 1983 death of his sister and singing partner, Karen
Carpenter, but he feels the life of an entertainer had nothing to do
with it.
   Miss Carpenter died of complications brought on by anorexia
nervosa, an eating disorder characterized by extreme dieting. Her
life and death are the subject of the TV movie ``The Karen Carpenter
Story'' on CBS next week.
   ``If she had died in a more tangible way, if she had been hit by
a car, it would have been equally tragic, but something I could
comprehend,'' Carpenter writes in the Dec. 31 issue of TV Guide.
``The eating disorder that killed her, anorexia nervosa, was little
understood then and only a little more now.''
   Carpenter is executive producer of the movie.
   ``What would possess a woman like her to starve herself?''
Carpenter asks. ``Some people blame it on career pressure or a need
to take more control over her life.
   ``I don't think so. I think she would have suffered from the same
problem even if she had been a homemaker.''

   Stephen Silverman's book about Daryl F.
Zanuck's vicious power struggle with his son Richard for control of
20th Century Fox didn't exactly put him on Richard Zanuck's
Christmas list.
   ``I wasn't out to write a puff piece on the guy, but I don't
really think he'll stay mad for very long,'' Silverman, 37, said
recently about his book, ``The Fox That Got Away.''
   ``Besides, we aren't exactly running in the same social circles,
anyway. I doubt if I lost any party invitations because of the
book.''
   Richard Zanuck ousted his father, one of Hollywood's last
old-style movie moguls, to win control of 20th Century. But a final
move by the elder Zanuck ruined his son's studio career.
   ``It's about fathers and sons, period, and that alone is of
interest to people,'' Silverman said of the book, his first.
   Zanuck died in 1979. His son became a successful independent
producer with David Brown, working on such films as ``Jaws,'' ``The
Sting'' and ``Cocoon.''

<TEXT>
   The Soviet Union, which for decades banned accurate
maps as a security risk and outlawed public opinion surveys as
anti-communist, will allow the Gallup poll to survey its citizens'
knowledge of geography, it was reported Monday.
   The poll of 1,500 to 2,000 people apparently is aimed at
discovering whether Soviet citizens are as ignorant as Americans of
such basic facts as the location of Great Britain.
   A recent international poll by Gallup and the National Geographic
Society found that three out of four Americans couldn't find the
Persian Gulf on a map and most couldn't find Britain. Americans
ranked sixth among the eight nations tested.
   Adult Americans averaged 8.6 correct answers out of 16, far
behind the Swedes at 11.6. The West Germans scored with 11.2, the
Japanese 9.7, the French 9.3, and the Canadians 9.2. The Americans
outscored only the Italians at 7.6 and the Mexicans at 7.4.
   Now it appears that same test is coming to the Soviet Union.
Izvestia said the planned poll is a joint project of Gallup and the
National Geographic Society aimed at determining the level of
geographic knowledge of various countries.
   Although the Soviets have broken with tradition and started their
own public opinion polls in the past year, this apparently is the
first time a foreign firm will be permitted to conduct a survey on
Soviet soil, albeit in conjunction with the Soviet Institute for
Sociological Research.
   For many years, sociology was a lost science in the Soviet Union,
as Marxist-Leninism claims all societies will inevitably develop
into communism.
   Personal thoughts were grounds for imprisonment, and public
opinion polls were inconceivable.
   Maps are still sketchy and deliberately distorted, with rivers
shifted and whole sections of major cities excised. The government
admitted to that practice several months ago and promised that
accurate maps were forthcoming. Many Soviet citizens have difficulty
reading maps as a result of these inaccuracies.
   Reliance on public transportation is also limits some citizens'
sense of direction.
   ``Follow bus No. 7,'' may be the best advice a motorist can
expect.
   Americans, however, don't fare much better, according to Gallup.
More than one-third could not pick out the westernmost city on a
simple map, its U.S. poll found.
   The Gallup poll also will survey Soviet consumers to determine
what products they buy and what items they would like to purchase,
Izvestia said.
   That basic marketing question may sound a bit strange to Soviet
ears. With a chronic severe shortage of nearly all consumer items,
most Soviet consumers buy anything decent they find, regardless of
such niceties as size, and then trade with friends.
   The Gallup poll also will question Soviet consumers' familiarity
with American-made products, Izvestia said.
   Soviets love Western brand names and snap up shirts, stickers,
hats, almost anything imprinted with names like Addidas, Nike and
Mercedes. But the genuine Western products are hard to come by, as
the Soviet Union has cut imports of consumer goods as its foreign
income has fallen with the price of Siberian oil and gas.
   Exact wording of the Gallup survey questions is still being
worked out, but it should be completed by mid-January, Izvestia said.

   An Eastern Airlines jet with 110 people
aboard made an emergency landing today after a 14-inch hole
developed in the fuselage and the cabin lost compression at 31,000
feet, authorities said.
   The Boeing 727, which was flying from Rochester, N.Y., to
Atlanta, landed safely and none of the 104 passengers or six crew
members aboard Flight 251 was injured, said Yeager Airport Police
Chief Robert Barnette.
   The tear was on the top of the fuselage over the last rows of the
20-year-old jet, said Karen Ceremsak, an Eastern spokeswoman in
Miami.
   The plane experienced no sudden trouble when the hole opened up,
except the ``rapid decompression,'' and flew on for another 50
miles, said Federal Aviation Administration spokesman Jack Barker in
Atlanta.
   The passengers put on their oxygen masks, and the pilot simply
``flew it to 10,000 feet,'' an altitude that requires no
pressurization in the cabin, Barker said.
   Passenger Sam Piazza, 55, of Boca Raton, Fla., said at first he
and his wife thought a bomb had exploded.
   ``We were cruising along and you could hear the rush of the wind
and the pitch of the wind and all of a sudden you could hear a big
pop,'' Piazza said.
   Bill Tretter, 25, of Buffalo, N.Y., and three family members were
waiting for lunch when the cabin lost pressure.
   ``We were just going along, and they were serving the first-class
passengers and all of a sudden air started to rush by and it was
kicking up dust,'' Tretter said.
   All 104 passengers planned to continue on to Atlanta, Barker
said. There was no immediate indication of the cause of the crack,
he said.
   Barnette said he received the first report of the emergency
landing request at 9:10 a.m.
   ``As far as I was concerned it was a normal landing, I asked if
he needed assistance and he said no. There was no emergency crews
needed on the runway,'' said the air traffic controller who guided
the plane in. He refused to be identified.
   The roof of a Boeing 737 was torn off during an Aloha Airlines
flight on April 28, killing one person and injuring 61 others. The
accident prompted a federal investigation into the aging fleet of
jets. The FAA ordered airlines to replace rivets believed to have
caused cracks in the fuselage skin.

   Afghanistan's Shiite guerrilla leader
Burhanuddin Rabbani on Monday met Iranian officials and thanked them
for their support, Iranian television reported.
   The broadcast, monitored in Nicosia, said Rabbani briefed Iranian
Prime Minister Hussein Musavi and Parliament Speaker Hashemi
Rafsanjani on military developments in Afghanistan and thanked them
for their support.
   Musavi was quoted as telling Rabbani that the fight by Afghan
guerrillas must continue until an Islamic government is established
in Kabul, the TV report said.
   Earlier Iranian press reports quoted Rabbani as saying he was in
Tehran to consult with the Shiite Moslem alliance on the future of
Afghanistan after the Soviet troop withdrawal, which is scheduled to
end Feb. 15, 1989.
   The official Islamic Republic News Agency, also monitored in
Nicosia, said Afghan refugees in Iran would rally Tuesday to mark
the ninth anniversary of the Soviet intervention in Afghanistan.
   Soviet troops marched into the country in December 1979 to
support the Marxist government.
   U.S.-backed Afghan guerrillas are split into two coalitions _ the
Iran-based Shiite alliance and the larger Sunni Moslem alliance
based in Pakistan.

   A group has filed suit demanding about $94.3 million
from the government and factories for air pollution damages suffered
by 483 people, a lawyer said Monday.
   It is the largest air pollution damage suit ever filed in Japan,
said lawyer Seiichiro Onuki. A suit seeking $69.4 million for 471
people, also in western Japan, was filed in 1984.
   Onuki said his clients also sought a court injunction to limit
the discharge of air pollutants in their neighborhoods.
   Onuki said the suit claims damages for 483 people, including 11
who have died, who have been recognized by the Environment Agency as
suffering from air pollution.
   The group in Amagasaki, 270 miles southwest of Tokyo, alleges
that nitrogen dioxide, sulfur dioxide and other pollutants from
plants and highways caused respiratory diseases, including asthma
and bronchitis, Onuki said.
   He said the pollutants were discharged by nine manufacturing and
electric power firms in Amagasaki, and the government and the
government-owned Hanshin Super Highway Corp. were accused of failing
to curb pollution on a national highway in the area.

<HEAD>Angolan Leader Says Military Success Brought Namibian Agreement</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MAPUTO, Mozambique (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Angolan President Jose Eduardo dos
Santos says his country's military successes against South Africa
led to the signing of Namibia's independence agreement, according to
a report received here Monday.
   ANGOP, Angola's state news agency, said dos Santos praised the
Angolan armed forces during a ceremony Sunday when he received
copies of the treaties signed in New York on Thursday by Angola,
Cuba and South Africa.
   There was no mention in the report about the agreement for the
withdrawal of 50,000 Cuban troops from Angola as a link to South
African withdrawal from neighboring Namibia, which South Africa has
ruled for 73 years.
   The ANGOP report quoted dos Santos as saying his government
forces made an ``incalculable contribution to the cause of peace.''
   He declared they won the October 1987 battle for Cuito Cuanavale
city, ``the largest military battle ever fought in sub-Saharan
Africa.'' The report did not indicate whether he mentioned Cubans
who supported Angolan troops in the battle or the participation of
guerrillas opposed to his government who reportedly still are
fighting at Cuito Cuanavale.
   The strategic town in southern Angola was beseiged by South
African forces and guerrillas of Jonas Savimbi's National Union for
the Total Independence of Angola. Dos Santos said they never managed
to capture the town.
   Savimbi said he did not want to occupy the town, but forced
Angolan forces to abandon it and a plan to attack his headquarters
at Jamba.
   Dos Santos was quoted as saying the defense of Cuito Cuanavale
and ensuing military successes achieved with Cuban soldiers at
Ruacana and Calueque _ where many South African soldiers guarding
dam installations were killed _ ``have changed the direction of
events in southern Africa, and led the parties involved to
negotiation.''
   The New York accords ``open the path to peace in southern Africa,
since they have made inevitable a search for a political solution to
the grave problem of apartheid in South Africa,'' he said.

   The black-robed men chant hymns and divide
their days between study and prayer in defiance of a Catholic Church
they say they are trying to preserve.
   In the eyes of Pope John Paul II, the 50 men at the only U.S.
seminary aligned with excommunicated Archbishop Marcel Lefebvre are
members of a rebel church. But they believe it is the shepherd that
has gone astray.
   ``We love the pope and we pray for him every day,'' said Paul
Kimball, a fifth-year student at St. Thomas Aquinas Seminary. ``But
we can't obey him when he's telling us to use the new Mass. Until he
converts and becomes a true Catholic, we can't obey him.''
   The seminary, situated on a bluff above this Mississippi River
town, is run by Richard Williamson, one of four men excommunicated
along with Lefebvre last summer when the Swiss prelate unilaterally
consecrated them as bishops.
   Lefebvre and the Fraternity of St. Pius X that he heads oppose
many of the changes introduced by the Second Vatican Council in the
1960s, including the holding of Mass in the local language. The
group continues to use the Latin Mass from the 16th century.
   Although they hold to the church teaching that the pope is the
vicar of Christ on earth, Lefebvre's supporters say the pontiff can
also make mistakes.
   The excommunications are ``worth nothing in the eyes of God,''
said the Rev. Pierre Delaplace, who teaches at the seminary. An
excommunicated Catholic is not permitted to receive the church's
sacraments, which include communion and last rites.
   The Rev. Kevin McDonough, chancellor of the Minneapolis-St. Paul
Archdiocese, said Lefebvre's followers have ``taken a very
beautiful, important thing in the church ... and have said this
practice is the one and only way people may reverently worship God.''
   ``To maintain such a constricted vision of life requires that
someone has to be controlled by their own fear,'' McDonough said.
   Lefebvre claims millions of sympathizers around the world, but a
Vatican spokesman said the figure is closer to 80,000 to 100,000.
The Rev. Francois Laisney, district superior of the Lefebvre
movement in the United States, estimated there are between 15,000
and 20,000 followers among the nation's 53.5 million Catholics.
   The movement has about 270 seminarians, 210 priests and 340
churches worldwide, acording to figures kept by the seminary.
   The seminary opened in July after it outgrew its campus in
Ridgefield, Conn. Built in 1950 as a Dominican priory, the seminary
was purchased by Lefebvre's followers for $400,000 in 1987.

<TEXT>
   The Soviet Union launched its first national
multicandidate election campaign Monday with 100 Communist Party
members and ordinary citizens entering the race.
   Monday's nominees, including a retired army general and economic
reformer, have exactly three months to win the suddenly unguaranteed
votes of their comrades. Their campaigns may include free television
time and an unpaid staff of 10 volunteers.
   A government reform law November dropped decades of
single-candidate balloting for Communist Party nominees in favor of
unlimited candidates for 2,250 seats in the new Congress of People's
Deputies. Nominating will continue for another month and balloting
is set for March 26.
   Even the official Soviet news agency Tass admitted Monday that
Soviet elections were ``largely reduced to a formality in the past.''
   Voters had no choice of candidates and nominees were chosen
according to social status, age and sex to guarantee filling quotas
for factory workers and other demographic groups, Tass said.
   In the time of Soviet dictator Josef Stalin, people who
registered objections by vainly voting ``no'' risked a 25-year
prison term.
   Under President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's reorganization, precinct
caucuses, workers grouped by company or industry, and certain public
organizations ranging from the Communist Party to the Academy of
Sciences may nominate an unlimited number of candidates.
   Congress will meet once a year and elect a nearly full-time
parliament from among its members.
   The Soviet Union first experimented with multiple candidates in
some local council elections June 1987. They resulted in the
Communist Party losing its majority control in some councils to
non-party members.
   Nevertheless, ``the Party'' is guaranteed pre-eminence by the
Soviet Constitution, which also prohibits other political parties.
The one visible opposition group, the Democratic Union, spends much
of its time agitating for the right to exist.
   In Moscow, signs popped up Monday identifying precinct meeting
sites.
   Public interest was less than overwhelming, however, according to
Soviet media. Although work groups must have 500 members to nominate
a candidate, the vote in one Minsk computer factory was just 36-8. A
local Communist Party official overwhelmed her opponent, a shift
supervisor known for her honorable character and painstaking work.
   Monday's Tass report answered one serious objection to
Gorbachev's reform plan _ the possibility a person could be elected
to fill more than one congressional seat. Since two-thirds of
representatives will be chosen by territorial district and one-third
from organizations, it was possible a person could be nominated in
his region and also by several organizations.
   But Tass said an election commission would register the nominees
at the end of the first month of the campaign to prevent one person
running in several districts simultaneously. Tass did not say if the
commission would have the power to bar candidates for other reasons.

   President-elect Bush expressed support
Monday for a meeting between Egyptian and Israeli leaders, saying,
``The more contact they have ... the better it is.''
   Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak was quoted Sunday as saying he
was willing to go to Israel if such a visit would help achieve peace.
   Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir welcomed Mubarak's
suggestion. Shamir, appearing on Israeli television Sunday night,
also said he would soon reveal a new Mideast peace plan, but he did
not divulge details.
   Bush, arriving at Chase Naval Air Station for a quail hunting
trip, was asked if he would be willing to travel to the Middle East
if that would help.
   ``If I thought it would further the peace process, I would get on
that plane right now and go,'' he replied.
   But the vice president quickly qualified his remark, saying that
such a trip would be impossible immediately because he is not the
president.
   Bush added that any such diplomatic initiative requires ``a lot
of planning, a lot of policy review is necessary before we could
even contemplate such a thing.''
   Asked what a Mubarak visit to Israel might accomplish, Bush
replied: ``I don't know.''
   But he said, ``The more contact they have ... the better it
is.... If that works out, that is fine.

   Public Service Company of New Hampshire, the
first major investor-owned utility to seek bankruptcy protection
since the Depression, must file its reorganization plan with a
federal judge Tuesday.
   The utility has said it probably will seek federal regulation
enabling it to charge its 360,000 ratepayers for its 36 percent
share in the stalled $5.7 billion Seabrook nuclear plant.
   State law bars charging ratepayers before a plant is operating.
   The reactor was completed in 1986 but has not been able to
receive a license of evacuation planning obstacles.
   The utility has said it may be entitled to rate increases of up
to 40 percent over two years under federal regulation. The state
reportedly offered rate increases of at least 4 percent a year for
five years.
   Four New England utilities have expressed interest in taking over
some or all of Public Service's non-Seabrook assets.

<TEXT>
   The Arab League Council on Monday said the
United States risks ``serious repercussions'' in its relations with
the Arab world if it attacks Libya.
   The final resolution of a special session called by Libya said an
international organization was best suited to examine the U.S.
complaint that Libya maintains a chemical weapons factory.
   ``The council considers the American threats as a factor of
tension itself threatening the international climate of detente and
peace that Arab states are trying to support and consolidate,'' read
the resolution, which was unanimously adopted.
   President Reagan, in a television interview last week, said
Washington has been discussing with its allies the possibility of
taking military action to destroy a Libyan factory it claims can
produce enormous quantities of chemical weapons.
   U.S. spokesmen have said military action was only one of several
options.
   Libya denies the charge, says the factory is producing
pharmaceuticals and declared its ``full commitment to all
international conventions'' banning chemical weapons.
   Also on Monday, Kuwait joined Iran, Iraq, Syria and the Palestine
Liberation Organization in pledging to back Libya in the event of a
U.S. attack.
   ``These threats are not directed against Libya alone but against
the entire Arab world,'' Foreign Minister Sheik Sabah Ahmed told the
Kuwait News Agency. ``Kuwait stands by sister Libya against any
aggression it might confront.''
   The Arab League resolution said questions, ``in particular those
of a military character,'' should be submitted to competent
international organizations such as the United Nations and the
International Atomic Energy Agency.
   U.S. spokesmen have said they would like the issue examined at an
international conference in Paris Jan. 7-11 to consider ways of
enforcing the 1925 Geneva convention outlawing chemical weapons.
   The resolution reaffirmed the Arab League's solidarity with Libya
and warned the United States that ``any attempt at an aggression
against this state risks the most serious repercussions in the
region and in Arab-American relations.''
   It further accused Israel of using chemical weapons in southern
Lebanon and the occupied territories.
   The council ``notes with surprise the silence of the United
States'' in the face of Israel's use and ``fabrication and stockage
of these prohibited arms,'' it said.
   No one has made such accusations before. The Israeli government
customarily refuses to confirm or deny foreign reports that it
started to develop chemical arms after Egypt used such weapons
during its 1963-67 involvement in the civil war in Yemen.
   Israeli leaders have vowed to retaliate ``thousandfold'' in the
event of a chemical attack from the Arab side.
   Arab League Secretary-General Chedli Klibi, opening the special
session, accused Washington of violating the U.N. charter and
international law with its threat.
   ``The new threats proffered by the United States evoke the
astonishment of the Arab states and are denounced by our peoples,''
Klibi said. ``They show, what's more, the seriousness of a situation
where a state, no matter how important it is, treats questions of
international conflict outside the framework of the United Nations,
the only appropriate framework.
   ``The Arab states warn against the inherent risks of the American
accusations and against all aggression against one of them.''
   U.S. warplanes bombed Libya in 1986 in retaliation for the
terrorist attack on a West Berlin disco where two U.S. servicemen
and a Turkish woman were killed and more than 200 soldiers and
others were injured.

<DATELINE>BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The leading Communist Party daily on
Monday called on Parliament to replace Premier Branko Mikulic and
his government because of failure to resolve Yugoslavia's worst
postwar economic crisis.
   ``Mikulic's government must fall because it was not able to carry
out its own programs and to create a climate for an authentic start
of economic reforms,'' said the daily Borba in a front-page
editorial.
   Yugoslavia is grappling with a 250 percent annual inflation rate,
15 percent unemployment, a $21 billion foreign debt and growing
labor unrest.
   ``The Yugoslav Parliament should usher in the new year by
replacing the current federal government,'' Borba said.
   Mikulic, who came to power in 1986, indicated in a recent
interview that he and his government had no intention of resigning.
No government or premier has resigned or been replaced in Yugoslavia
since the communists came to power after World War II.
   Borba said that if the government is not replaced, Yugoslavia
might be faced with severe labor unrest.
   In 1988, workers staged a record 1,000 strikes to protest low
wages and plunging living standards that have dropped to the
mid-1960s level, according to official statistics.
   ``The patience of the Yugoslav working class is running low,''
Borba said.
   In another development, a former official was expelled from the
Communist Party on Monday for his alleged involvement in a
real-estate scandal in the central republic of Bosnia, the official
Tanjug news agency reported.
   A party disciplinary commission expelled Todo Kurtovic for using
political influence to secure favorable bank loans to build a
luxurious vacation home on the central Adriatic coast.
   Kurtovic came to prominence as of the party's top ideologues in
the 1970s, when he headed the communist-led Socialist Alliance and
authored books on socialism.
   The Parliament of Bosna demanded last week that legislation be
passed allowing authorities to confiscate homes belonging to several
hundred Bosnian politicians who obtained illegal bank loans to build
them.
   They include Milanko Renovica, until last year president of the
party's ruling Politburo, and Nikola Stojanovic, a former member of
the Politburo.
   Mikulic, who is from Bosnia, has also been linked to the
real-estate scandal, but the premier last week denied repeated
allegations that he owned illegally-financed property in Bosnia.
   According to press reports, Bosnian politicians qualified for the
loans by having local banks order a temporary transfer of foreign
currency from the accounts of Yugoslavs working abroad to the
applicant's account. The foreign currency served as collateral to
secure the loan, and would then be returned to the original
accounts. Such services were repaid with political favors and rapid
promotions, according to the reports.
   The terms of the loans did not include the usual adjustments for
inflation, thus reducing the real value of the mortgage to what one
press report called ``the value of a pack of cigarettes.''

   PLO chief Yasser Arafat and his top aides
concluded a three-day meeting Monday focused on means of advancing
the peace process in the Middle East, a PLO official said.
   One development reported from the 15-member PLO Executive
Committee meeting was a decision to upgrade the status of PLO
offices to embassies in countries that have recognized the
independent Palestinian state. Ninety countries have recognized the
state so far, officials said.
   Azzam Al-Ahmed, director of the Palestine Liberation Organization
office in Baghdad, said the leaders discussed a host of issues
during five closed-door sessions, including the latest dialogue with
the United States, the formation of a provisional government in the
Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip and the year-old uprising
there.
   Al-Ahmed would not specify on any conclusions, saying a statement
would be issued later.
   Sources close to the executive committee said Sunday the members
agreed that in further talks with the United States, the PLO should
stress greater U.S. recognition of the group and the need for an
international peace conference.
   The sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the PLO
will urge the United States to recognize it as the sole and
legitimate representative of the Palestinian people.
   Earlier this month, Washington broke a 13-year ban on contacts
with the PLO. Talks were held in Tunis, Tunisia several days later.
   The committee also broached the topic of forming a provisional
government, a Palestinian spokesman said. He said the issue needed
further discussion.
   Arafat was quoted Monday as telling the West German magazine
Spiegel that an independent Palestinian state must have a corridor
through Israel connecting the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   In November, the Palestine National Council, the PLO's
parliament-in-exile, declared an independent Palestinian state but
did not specify its borders.
   ``We can negotiate over that in the peace conference,'' Arafat
was quoted as telling Spiegel of the borders.
   ``But in all cases we will insist on establishing a corridor
between West Jordan (the West Bank) and the Gaza Strip. It is not
acceptable for us to establish a state split into two parts,''

   Two men trapped in an avalanche while
sliding down a hill were rescued after nearly seven hours under 6
feet of snow, authorities said.
   ``These guys are very lucky. It was a stupid move on their
part,'' said police Officer John Chilton.
   Passers-by dug out Brett Woods, 24, and Keith Kathcart, 19, late
Sunday after hearing screams and seeing a glove resting atop the
snow near the Chapman Hill ski area. The two were hospitalized in
good condition Monday.
   Close to 3 feet of snow had fallen in southwest Colorado by
Sunday, prompting the Avalanche Warning Center in Denver to warnings
throughout the weekend.
   Woods and Kathcart were sliding down a steep embankment when the
snow slide occurred.
   They were admitted to Mercy Medical Center with hypothermia and
muscle injuries, authorities said. Woods' body temperature had
dropped to 91 degrees after the accident, while Kathkart's was 87,
said Dr. Mack Johnson.
   ``I guess under the circumstances, they were in pretty good
condition,'' said Frank Mackey of the Fire Department. ``They could
talk and one of them walked to the ambulance.''
   Andy Loving of the Avalanche Warning Center said the U.S record
for surviving snow burial is nine hours. ``After 30 minutes of
burial, the chances of survival are reduced by half,'' he said.
``They must have had some kind of air space around them.''

<TEXT>
   Hosni Mubarak learned international diplomacy
under Anwar Sadat. But unlike his mercurial predecessor, the
Egyptian president avoids grand gestures calculated to succeed
through their shock value.
   Sadat, the only Arab president ever to visit Israel, announced
his stunning 1977 trip to Jerusalem from the podium of Egypt's
parliament. It was so unbelievable, many journalists in the audience
reported it as a figure of speech, not a literal commitment to take
his peace campaign to the parliament of the enemy.
   By contrast, when Mubarak said over the Christmas weekend he also
would go to Israel if it would help bring peace, he used visiting
journalists _ one Kuwaiti, one Japanese _ to convey the message.
   The message, a very tentative initiative, reflected the
57-year-old Mubarak's characteristic caution.
   ``Why not go? If this visit would lead to solving the
(Arab-Israeli) problem, and if it would lead to establishing a just
peace, then I am ready,'' he told the Kuwaiti newspaper Al-Anbaa.
   And on Sunday, he repeated in an interview with Tokyo's Yomiuri
Shimbun that he would be willing to go but said: ``I have no plans
... It depends. I don't accept any preconditions.''
   That seemed a slight step back from previous pronouncements, in
which Mubarak said there would be no reason for him to meet with
Yitzhak Shamir unless the hard-line Israeli prime minister changed
his policies.
   But it also sent a signal to Shamir, who welcomed the idea of a
Mubarak visit, not to insist as a condition of his invitation that
Mubarak go to Jerusalem. That would imply Egyptian acceptance of
Israel's annexation of the eastern part of the city, which Israel
occupied in the 1967 war.
   In 1982, there was talk of a Mubarak trip, but it never got off
the ground because the Israelis wanted him in Jerusalem.
   Such considered, signal-sending diplomacy has been a hallmark of
Mubarak's seven years in office, which began after a national
referendum a week after Moslem extremists assassinated Sadat on Oct.
6, 1981.
   The opening to Israel and the peace treaty that followed two
years later were among reasons the killers gave for the attack, in
which Mubarak suffered a slight hand wound.
   Sadat passed over several generals senior to Mubarak when he
chose the generally colorless but good-natured air force commander
as vice president in 1975.
   He relied heavily on Mubarak, who first drew Sadat's eye with his
performance in the 1973 war. Mubarak's air force jets opened the war
with a successful first strike against Israeli positions in the
occupied Sinai that gave Sadat the momentum he needed for the best
Arab battlefield performance ever against Israel.
   It later was to give him the political leverage he needed to make
peace.
   As president, Mubarak quickly began work to recover Egypt's
traditional position as political and military anchor of the Arab
world. After the peace treaty, most Arab countries and the Palestine
Liberation Organization broke relations with Egypt.
   In June 1982, when King Khaled of Saudi Arabia died, Mubarak
quietly and unobtrusively went to pay Egypt's respects. In 1983, he
made up with the PLO by giving sanctuary to chairman Yasser Arafat
when invading Israeli forces drove him from Lebanon. Mubarak
remained a staunch ally and major arms supplier of Arab Iraq in its
long war with Persian Iran.
   One by one, Arab barriers fell. Finally, in November 1987,
leaders of the 22-member Arab League, boycotting Egypt en masse
since 1979, voted that diplomatic relations are a matter of
individual national interest.
   Since then, all members except Libya, Lebanon and Syria have
restored ties. Last week, Mubarak invited President Hafez Assad of
Syria to visit Egypt, and Syrian media has begun hinting at a
warming of relations.
   In an interview shortly after Sadat selected him vice president,
Mubarak hinted at the kind of president he would be.
   ``I am a man who likes to do his work perfectly and faithfully,''
he told the Cairo newspaper Al-Akhbar.
   He characterized his decision-making style in a 1986 interview
with The Associated Press: ``It's well-studied, well-calculated,
then the decision. I never do anything just for the move. ... No, I
am not that kind of man.''

   Firefighters rushing to an emergency left
a pot of frying oil on the firehouse stove, resulting in a $10,000
blaze that will close the station at least a week.
   ``We tell people not to do that kind of stuff,'' Acting Battalion
Chief Martin McMahon said Sunday. ``We all come from the human race.
We make mistakes.''
   The blaze broke out after the six-member squad on Christmas duty
received a call to help a rescue team trying to resucitate a man,
McMahon said. The firefighters failed to turn off the burner that
was heating oil for frying potatoes.
   A storeowner next door spotted the smoke, broke a window to get
inside and used a fire extinguisher. Another firefighter showed up
minutes later, but with no fire trucks in the building, he also was
forced to use an extinguisher.
   Mayor Arthur Rosenburg said the firefighters will move to other
facilities during the week or two it take to fix the damage.
   ``It was one of these careless things that are inexcusable, but
it happens,'' the mayor said. ``We're going to put it in their union
contract that they have to turn off the stove before they go out on
a call.''

   Radioactive gas leaked from the Connecticut
Yankee nuclear plant for 10 minutes Monday morning, but no one was
injured and there was no danger to the public or employees, a
spokeswoman said.
   The release of xenon-krypton occurred while technicians were
taking a test sample, Northeast Utilities spokeswoman Barbara Luce.
   She said the accident did not affect operations at the plant.
   The spokeswoman said the release was measured as two-hundredths
of a millirem, a unit used to measure radiation exposure. By
comparison, she said, a diagnostic chest x-ray involves between 20
and 30 millirems of radiation.
   Luce also said that there are daily, planned releases of the gas
of less than a millirem. The gas is produced during fission. The
utility notifed state and government officials of the accident and
were investigating, Luce said.

   A raging snowstorm cut off roads into the
quake-devastated area of Armenia on Monday, leaving survivors and
emergency workers shivering in tents and the unheated shells of
buildings, the government newspaper Izvestia reported.
   Freezing temperatures dropped sharply and were expected to reach
5 degrees, Soviet television reported. Campfires and emergency
stoves provided the only warmth. The heating plants that produce
steam for the radiators of entire Soviet cities were destroyed in
the Dec. 7 earthquake, which authorities say killed up to 55,000
people.
   Survivors continued to search for missing relatives among the
dead, the injured, and the displaced.
   One widowed father tracked down his infant son, who was five days
old when the quake smashed the Leninakan maternity hospital where he
was born and killed everyone but that one baby boy. Dug from the
ruins after being buried for two days and nights, the infant was
still wearing a wrist name tag, Tass reported.
   The father of little Oganez Gevorkyan found him in a Yerevan
hospital, suffering from a broken arm and a broken leg.
   ``The father stood a long time over the cot, tears coursing down
his face,'' Tass said. And then the elder Gevorkyan hastened back to
his army unit to continue clearing earthquake debris. The Soviet
news agency did not give the father's first name.
   Another Armenian man by the name of Arutyunyan dashed into a
collapsing maternity hospital and saved his wife and newborn son.
The quake slammed into their village of Nalband, right at the
epicenter, just as the boy was born, knocking him out of the
obstetrician's hands and leaving the exhausted new mother to pick
him up.
   The Communist Party newspaper Pravda reported Monday that Moscow
is cracking down on party leaders in neighboring Azerbaijan who
failed to cool flaming tempers and ethnic violence, which led tens
of thousands of Armenians to flee Azerbaijan in the weeks before the
quake. An undetermined number of refugees settled in with relatives
in the quake area just before the earthquake struck.
   A military patrol halted the fleeing Communist Party chief of the
Kedabak region only after firing on his automobile, Pravda said. The
soldiers found him carrying cash amounting to several years' salary,
Pravda said.
   In Baku, the capital of Azerbaijan, 213 party members were
disciplined for failing to ease tension, Pravda said. Thirteen were
expelled from the party. In another group, 121 persons held
responsible were fired from their jobs.
   Pravda blamed criminal elements and their government protectors
for inciting the ethnic strife as a cover-up for their activities.
Moscow has sent hundreds of special prosecutors into the area to
investigate charges of corruption.

<TEXT>
   President-elect Bush, beginning a four-day
hunting and fishing vacation Monday, called his son Jeb's visit to
earthquake victims in Soviet Armenia ``so moving and so right.''
   Bush flew to this rural south Texas town about 70 miles from
Corpus Christi to hunt quail on the secluded 10,000-acre Lazy-F
ranch owned by his long-time friend, Will Farish, a Houston
investmant banker.
   Looking casual and relaxed in a red shirt and black cowboy boots,
Bush told reporters his best Christmas present was seeing Jeb, a
Miami real estate developer, and his grandson, George, 12, deliver
toys and medical supplies to children in Yerevan, Armenia on
Christmas Day.
   ``It was so moving and so right ... it said what we feel ... we
want to reach out to those others less fortunate,'' Bush said.
   The vice president, arriving at Chase Naval Air Station in the
flat Texas scrubland, said he talked with Jeb by telephone as the
younger Bushes flew back to the United States.
   Jeb said the trip was ``probably the most moving thing he has
ever been involved in,'' Bush recounted.
   The Soviet ambassador to the United States, Yuri Dubinin, was
also ``deeply appreciative'' of the efforts Jeb Bush and other
Americans are making to help victims of the earthquake that killed
about 50,000 people, Bush said.
   Jeb Bush flew to Armenia aboard a cargo plane chartered by
Americares, a relief agency, to deliver toys and medical supplies to
children on Christmas Day.
   The president-elect spent Christmas in Washington with his wife,
Barbara, and one of his five children, Marvin, and his wife and
daughter. Mrs. Bush did not accompany her husband on the trip to
Texas, an annual ritual Bush has followed for two decades.
   Bush said his designated secretary of state, James Baker III, and
Mrs. Baker are planning to visit the Farish ranch, possibly arriving
Monday night. In addition, Bush's brother, Jonathan, was expected to
join the group.
   Bush, who doesn't have a heavy work schedule for the next four
days, said he ``brought a little homework, a little inaugural
backround material, a little reading,'' especially on the budget.
   ``Everything has to fit into a budget plan,'' he said.
   While saying he has no qualms about hunting birds, Bush said, ``I
don't think I could shoot a deer. ... Quail hunting, that is
something else again.''
   ``These aren't animals ... These are wild quail,'' he said. ``Our
forefathers ate by harvesting game.''
   On Saturday, Bush named the 13th person to his Cabinet, Elizabeth
Dole as labor secretary. The only high-level job vacancies that
remain are for energy secretary and the newly created drug czar
post. Bush said there would be no announcements before Friday at the
earliest.
   After his vacation, Bush intends to focus on legislative and
policy issues.
   He said he will sit down with ``our education people,'' with
William Reilly, nominated as head of the Environmental Protection
Agency, and Attorney General Dick Thornburgh with whom the
president-elect wants to review anti-crime and anti-drug programs.
   Bush was asked about the investigation into the crash of the Pam
American flight over England last week. There was been speculation a
bomb might have caused the explosion.
   Bush said there was some ``interesting speculation,'' about the
crash, but he had no information about the investigation.
   He also said he would he would ``get on that plane right now'' if
he thought his precence in the Middle East would bring about peace.
But such diplomatic initiatives must be planned, Bush said, adding
he is not yet president.
   Asked about Egyptian Presiident Hosni Mubarak's offer to visit
Israel, Bush responded: ``The more contact they have ... the better
it is.''
   On Thursday, Bush leaves Beeville to fly to Alabama where he will
spend a few hours fishing before he returns to the nation's capital.
   Bush will fish for bass in a 55-acre lake on the property of Ray
Scott, president of Bass Anglers Sportsmen's Society. The lake is in
Pintlalla, near Montgomery.

<HEAD>Anti-Abortion Activist Condemns Abortion Clinic Fires</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The leader of an anti-abortion organization Monday
denounced the setting of fires at three clinics on Christmas morning.
   ``I think if it was in fact people doing this in the name of
right to life, they've done our movement no favors at all,'' said
Bill Price, head of the Texas Coalition for Life and president of
the Greater Dallas Right ot Life Committee. ``We just do not in any
form or fashion condone this type of activity.''
   A to Z Women's Health Services, the Fairmont Center and the North
Dallas Women's Clinic sustained minor damage in the fires, which
were reported early Sunday within about a half hour, investigators
said. No injuries were reported.
   Clinic officials charged the attacks are the work of
anti-abortion groups, which have staged protests and ``baby
rescues'' at the clinics in the past year.
   ``They are definitely suspicious fires,'' said Fire Capt. Mike
Southerland. ``It's possible some flammable liquids were used, but I
don't know what types at this time.''
   The U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms also is
investigating for links to past attacks on abortion clinics.
   ``I think all these fires were definitely connected,'' said Dena
Jackson, director of operations at North Dallas Women's clinic.
``When you look at the people that are anti-choice, they tend to be
highly religious. And with Christmas Day being so significant, I
think that definitely had something to do with it also.''
   ``We feel like we know who it is,'' agreed Betty Pettigrew,
director of A to Z Women's Health Services. ``They're always
threatening it, and we had heard that some clinic was going to be
hit _ not necessarily in Dallas.''
   Price said the fires improperly move the focus of the
right-to-life cause away from its goal and place it on the arson
controversy.

   Military explosives experts will
examine a suitcase from Pan Am Flight 103 and pieces of the
shattered jumbo jet for evidence of a bomb, Britain's top
investigator at the scene said Monday.
   At a news conference, however, a spokeswoman for investigator
Michael Charles refused to say where the suitcase was found, whether
it was intact or what attracted attention to it.
   Penny Russell-Smith, a Department of Transport press officer,
would only add that the suitcase ``exhibited characteristics which
merit further consideration.''
   For the first time since the crash Wednesday, police were
preparing to release the bodies of victims after pathologists
completed post mortems and confirmed identification.
   Police said about half a dozen bodies would be released Tuesday,
but Deputy Chief Constable Paul Newall said he could not provide
names or nationalities.
   One more body was found Monday, raising the total of bodies found
to 240. Police also announced the arrest of a local man following a
report of looting at a crash site.
   At least 29 bodies are still missing from the 258 people who died
aboard the New York-bound Boeing 747. Steady rains throughout most
of the day and low clouds restricted the search, Newall said.
   ``There may be some we will not find, and I think everyone should
be aware of that,'' Newall said.
   Police spokesman Angus Kennedy said Monday that all the occupants
of four cars found near one crash site had been found alive. Eleven
townspeople are missing and feared dead.
   Ms. Russell-Smith refused to say any more about the suitcase, nor
would she describe the amount of wreckage submitted for analysis or
what part of the aircraft it came from.
   ``Although, because of the fragmented and scattered nature of the
wreckage the investigation of the structural aspects of the accident
is a slow process, no evidence of a structural failure has so far
been found,'' Charles said in a statement released in Lockerbie and
in London by the Department of Transport.
   ``However, the possibility of such a failure is still being
actively investigated,'' Charles said. ``Some pieces of wreckage and
a suitcase are today being taken to the Royal Armament Research and
Development Establishment at Fort Halstead in Kent for more detailed
examination to determine whether they exhibit evidence of a
pre-impact explosion.''
   The Defense Department said the center does research on
explosives and armor.
   Experts have said structural failure or a bomb are the most
likely reasons the Pan Am jet disappeared from radar screens just as
it reached cruising altitude of 31,000 feet over southwestern
Scotland.
   The Times of London quoted William Tench, former chief inspector
of air accidents, as saying he believed a structural failure caused
the crash.
   The flight originated as a Boeing 727 from Frankfurt, West
Germany, with a change of planes at London's Heathrow International
Airport. Federal police in West Germany and the commander of
Scotland Yard's anti-terrorist squad last week began investigations
at those airports.
   Newall said he believed the looting case was an isolated
incident. It occurred in the area where falling wreckage exploded in
a fireball, obliterating four houses and severely damaging 20
others. All the missing townspeople were residents of the
neighborhood.
   The Rev. Patrick Keegans, the Roman Catholic parish priest, lost
his home in that neighborhood, although he was away from it at the
time.
   At a Requiem Mass Monday night, Keegans spoke of the bewilderment
of those who lost loved ones.
   ``Confronted with the horror of such loss, we feel empty, hurt,
confused, and we say to ourselves, `things will never be the same
again.' As Christ did on the Cross, we too scream at the Father, `My
God, my God, why have you abandoned me?' He does not seem to answer.
There is only silence.''
   Britain's Independent Television Network canceled plans to cover
the Mass after Kennedy said several relatives of the dead indicated
they would not attend a televised service. At least 90 relatives,
mostly from the United States, are known to have visited the town
since the crash.
   Lockerbie's streets were quiet and its shops were closed Monday
for Boxing Day, a holiday in Britain's long Christmas break.
   Social workers expressed concern about the delayed effects of the
disaster on the town's 2,500 residents.
   Leslie Jardine, a spokesman for the local social work department,
said a brochure advertising a telephone hotline was being
distributed to every home.
   ``Nature heals through allowing these feelings to come out,'' the
brochure said. ``Stopping these feelings may lead to nervous and
physical problems. Crying gives relief.''

   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev reappeared in public
Monday after a rare, 15-day absence from public events and Soviet TV
news coverage.
   In news film of his meeting Monday with Herbert Mies, head of the
West German Communist Party, Gorbachev appeared smiling, rested and
healthy _ in contrast to the shocked and saddened visage he showed
after viewing the carnage in earthquake-stricken Armenia on Dec. 11.
   Since then, he had not been shown on television, nor reported as
attending any public event. He missed no scheduled event, but for
Gorbachev to be absent from public view for so long is rare.
   Gorbachev's meeting Monday with Mies included a discussion of his
forthcoming visit to West Germany in the first half of 1989.

   Donald Trump, Paul Newman and Mel Gibson are
among the year's 10 most watchable men, a women's group said Monday.
   The 10 Most Watchable Men of 1988 represent a variety of
attributes that include attractiveness and success, said Suzy
Mallery, president of the 15,000-member Manwatchers Inc.
   ``They want it all, and this year's list has it,'' Ms. Mallery
said. ``Big bulging muscles have never been important, but now
dress, grooming and keeping in good physical shape has become much
more important.
   ``Good manners and communication are equally essential.''
   But women seem to be looking more at looks, Ms. Mallery said.
``Today's ambitious women are looking for the superficial things,
the bright and the savvy. It wasn't that way when we started in
1975,'' she said.
   Also making the grade this year were Kenny Rogers, John F.
Kennedy Jr., Tony Danza, Andrew McCarthy, Alan Thicke, Tony Curtis
and Lou Gossett Jr.
   Three previous contenders _ Burt Reynolds, Tom Selleck and Don
Johnson _ weren't eligible this year because Manwatchers elevated
them to its Hall of Fame, allowing room for new faces. Previous
inductees include Clint Eastwood and Robert Redford.

   The slayings of six women in recent
months have diverted attention from another killer that has stalked
this seaport for more than two years _ high-purity heroin.
   City Medical Examiner Dr. John O'Toole III estimated he handles
between 30 and 40 overdose deaths per year in the greater New
Bedford area.
   ``When I first joined the force you'd see heroin 5, 10 percent
pure. Now it's 50 to 60 percent pure,'' said Detective Richard
Spirlet.
   The potent heroin, bearing labels like Supra 87 and Power 95, has
drawn far less attention than the unknown killer responsible for the
slayings of six women whose bodies were found along highways in this
part of Massachusetts.
   When Mayor John Bullard was asked about the impact of the
slayings on the community he spoke not of the fear of murder but of
the scourge of drug addiction in this city of 98,000 about 50 miles
south of Boston.
   ``The biggest problem is the waste of human lives that takes
place off the front pages,'' Bullard said. Law enforcement
authorities said is no accident that the one thing all the murder
victims had in common was drug abuse.
   New Bedford, home of the state's largest methadone program, has
become a bustling retail outlet for heroin coming in by car from New
York City and Providence, R.I.
   A large Colombian population in nearby Central Falls, R.I., has
kept New Bedford well stocked in cocaine, according to law
enforcement officials.
   In August, September and October the city Emergency Medical
Services were responding to 17 overdose calls a month. In November,
when the discovery of the bodies became a major news story, there
were 29 ambulance runs for overdoses.
   ``I think the reason they overdose is they really don't know what
they're getting,'' said Kenneth Sylvia, deputy director of the
emergency medical services unit. ``A person is immune to a certain
percentage of heroin. If they go over that, they overdose and I know
that because I had a sister who overdosed and died.''
   New Bedford boasts the nation's richest fishing port in the
dollar value of its catch but has higher-than-average unemployment.

<HEAD>Referendum on Amnesty Law Approved; Vote Probably in April</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The Electoral Court confirmed on
Monday that enough Uruguayans signed petitions opposing a December
1986 military amnesty law to force a referendum that could overturn
it.
   The referendum probably will be held in April, said Juan Furest,
one of the nine members of the court. The exact date will be
disclosed within 10 days.
   Foes of the amnesty law needed 555,701 signatures, representing
one-quarter of Uruguay's 2.2 million electorate, to obtain a
referendum and Furest said they obtained the required number.
   The amnesty law bars the prosecution of soldiers and police
accused of human rights abuses, including murder, committed during
the 1973-85 military dictatorship's suppression of urban terrorism.
   Local human rights groups said about 150 Uruguayans were killed,
200 were arrested and disappeared, and thousands were tortured in
this small South American nation of 3 million people.
   President Julio M. Sanguinetti opposes the referendum and
predicts the amnesty law will not be overturned. He says overturning
the law carries the likelihood of a ``long, hazardous . .. and
dramatic period of confrontation'' between soldiers and civilians.
   The law was passed as civil courts were about call military
officers to answer charges of murder, kidnapping and torture.
Officers indicated they would ignore requests to testify, setting up
a potential clash with the government.
   The same issue in Argentina has led to three unsuccessful
military insurrections there in the past 20 months against the
government of President Raul Alfonsin.
   Sanguinetti, elected in November 1984, took office in March 1985.

   Gov. Rudy Perpich wants to
spend $2.2 million to take advantage of this community's reputation
as the ``nation's icebox.''
   The money would be used to lure companies here to do mechanical
testing and help them promote their products as having withstood the
lowest temperatures in the lower 48 states.
   ``International Falls is a cold place. So is Minnesota. Why not
'fess up to it and capitalize on it?'' said Richard Braun, chairman

   The governor said he will include the request in his 1989 budget
proposal.
   Companies such as Ford Motor Co. and Bell Helicopters already do
mechanical testing here.
   Testing and related activity pump about $300,000 a year into the

   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir may ask the United
States and the Soviet Union to sponsor Middle East peace talks as
part of his new peace initiative, an aide said Monday.
   Shamir's proposal, confirmed by his spokesman, Yossi Ahimeir,
came as Egypt's President Hosni Mubarak was reported to be
considering a trip to Israel to advance stalemated peace efforts.
   In Beeville, Texas, President-elect Bush expressed support Monday
for a meeting between Egyptian and Israeli leaders, saying, ``The
more contact they have ... the better it is.'' He said in response
to a question he, too, would be willing to go to the Middle East if
he believed it would further the peace process.
   Ahimeir said in a telephone interview that Shamir would condition
his proposal on Moscow's renewing diplomatic ties. The Kremlin
severed ties with Israel during the 1967 Middle East War, when
Israel captured Arab lands.
   Mubarak was quoted in an interview with a Kuwaiti newspaper
Sunday as saying he would go to Israel if the visit would help
achieve peace. It would be the first visit to the Jewish state by an
Arab leader since the late Egyptian President Anwar Sadat made his
last trip in September 1979.
   Shamir has said he would welcome a visit by Mubarak.
   ``He would like to renew the link with Mubarak,'' Ahimeir said,
adding that the timing seemed right since Shamir, as leader of the
right-wing Likud bloc, took office for a second straight term
Thursday.
   The Likud virtually has complete control over the nation's
foreign policy, although the left-leaning Labor Party is still in
the government. Labor's leader Shimon Peres, formerly foreign
minister, is now finance minister.
   Israel's ambassador in Cairo, Shimon Shamir, was meeting with
Egyptian officials to determine whether a Mubarak visit was
possible, said another Shamir spokesman, Avi Pazner.
   Thomas Pickering, the outgoing U.S. ambassador to Israel who has
been named U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, told reporters in
Tel Aviv a Shamir-Mubarak summit was ``certainly something the U.S.
would encourage and welcome.''
   He said the United States also was encouraged by Israeli efforts
to come up with a new peace initiative despite its fierce opposition
to recent U.S. contacts with the Palestine Liberation Organization.
   Shamir has been drawing up his own peace plans as alternatives to
growing pressure on Israel to negotiate with the PLO and participate
in a proposed international Middle East peace conference.
   Israel rejects any dialogue with the PLO, which it considers a
terrorist group. Shamir also has refused calls to join an
international conference, fearing a wide forum of nations would be
biased against Israel and pressure it to concede land to the Arabs.
   Ahimeir said that according to Shamir's proposal, the two
superpowers would ``invite the parties of the conflict to sit down
and negotiate'' without the participation of other U.N. Security
Council members.
   The daily newspaper Maariv said Monday that in talks with
Mubarak, Shamir would propose an Egyptian role in getting
negotiations started between Israel and a delegation made up of
Palestinians and representatives from neighboring Jordan.
   The aim of such talks would be to reach an interim agreement for
Palestinian self-rule in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip, the
newspaper said.
   Ahimeir said Shamir would be willing to coax Jordan into peace
talks by agreeing to consider modifications of the U.S.-sponsored
Camp David Accords signed in 1978, which led to an Israeli-Egyptian
peace treaty the following year.
   ``We want to get the Jordanians into the peace circle. We will
start with Camp David and are ready to discuss any changes they
want. We will listen and discuss it with them,'' Ahimeir said. He
declined to elaborate.
   Both Jordan and the PLO have in the past rejected the Camp David
accords, which outline a five-year autonomy or self-rule plan for
Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza Strip pending negotiations
for a final settlement.
   Although Israel wants Jordan to be a peace partner, King Hussein
distanced himself from that role in July when he severed his ties
with the West Bank.
   Palestinians in the occupied lands have been protesting Israel
rule there for more than a year in what has been called the
``intefadeh,'' or uprising. On Monday, soldiers shot and wounded
eight Palestinians in scattered clashes in the territories.
   At least 336 Palestinians and 14 Israelis have died since the
uprising began Dec. 8, 1987.

   More than 100 writers, artists and
scientists have sent an open letter to Cuban President Fidel Castro
asking him to hold a referendum on extending his rule, a Cuban
activist said Monday.
   The signatories from the United States, Europe, and Latin America
also include 50 exiled Cubans, said physician Marta Freyde. She
lives in Madrid and serves as vice-president of the Human Rights
Committee in Cuba, an independent group.
   Among those who signed were Italian film director Federico
Fellini; French actor Yves Montand; Nobel Prize-winning writers
Claude Simon and Saul Bellow and scientists Andre Lwoff and Jean
Dausset; and writers Camilo Jose Cela of Spain, Octavio Paz of
Mexico, Ernesto Sabato of Argentina, and Mario Vargas LLosa of Peru,
Ms. Freyde said.
   The letter notes that Jan. 1, 1989, marks the 30th anniversary of
Castro's communist rule and says he never has asked the Cuban people
to give him a mandate through a vote.
   The message calls for a ``free and secret vote.'' It also asks
that Cuban exiles and government opponents be allowed to return so
they can publicly campaign; release of all political prisoners;
legalization of human rights committees, and creation of an
independent body to supervise voting.
   The signatories point to an October plesbiscite in Chile ``where
the people, after 15 years of dictatorship, have been able to freely
express their country's political future.'' Chilean voters rejected
extending the term of military President Augusto Pinochet until 1997.

   ``Miami Vice'' star Don Johnson and his
ex-wife, actress Melanie Griffith, plan to re-marry, Johnson's
publicist said Monday.
   ``No date has been set,'' Elliot Mintz said in a statement by
telephone from Aspen, Colo. He wouldn't disclose where the wedding
will be or where the couple is spending the holidays.
   ``Both Don and Melanie wish to enjoy this very special time
together,'' Mintz said. ``In order to provide a sense of dignity and
privacy, there will be no press conference, photo opportunities,
interviews or further statement.''
   Miss Griffith, 31, star of the current hit movie ``Working
Girl,'' was married briefly to the then-little-known Johnson when
she was a teen-ager. She is the daughter of actress Tippi Hedren.
   She later married, then divorced, actor Steven Bauer, and they
have a 3{-year-old son, Alexander.
   Johnson recently was romantically involved with entertainer
Barbra Streisand, and the two sang together on the Top 10 adult
contemporary hit ``Till I Loved You.''
   Johnson, 39, has a 5-year-old son from his relationship with
Patti D'Arbanville.
   Johnson, who plays the scruffy vice cop Sonny Crockett on the
NBC-TV series, and Miss Griffith have reportedly been living
together in Miami.

<HEAD>Authorities Deny Knowledge Of How Inmates Died</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: New throughout, UPDATING with higher death toll, new charges

<DATELINE>TEPIC, Mexico (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Authorities on Monday denied anew any
knowledge of how five inmates died after they were videotaped while
in police custody during a prison riot that killed 25 people.
   ``I cannot explain this to you. No. No, we have no information on
the matter,'' Francisco Flores, a spokesman for the Nayarit state
government, said in a telephone interview.
   The five inmates were captured during an assault Friday night by
special police commando teams _ the Fox and Scorpion squads _ that
quelled a two-day uprising at the Venustiano Carranza state
penitentiary, 500 miles northwest of Mexico City.
   Freed hostage Patricia Castillo, a clerk in the prison law
office, said Monday the Fox squad entered the prison ``shooting
indiscriminately. The squad was very angry because they (the
inmates) had killed their commander. I was very scared.''
   She was among about 19 hostages seized Thursday by a small group
of inmates to protest the denial of Christmas pardons for good
behavior.
   Officials at first said the inmates died during two assaults on
the prison. But according to a witness and two hostages and a
videotape made by NBC News, only one assault occurred and many
prisoners were still alive when it was over.
   Some prisoners' bodies had up to 10 bullet wounds, the government
news agency Notimex said.
   Among those who died before the assault were the prison warden,
Samuel Alvarado, and Jorge Armando Duarte Badillo, the Fox squad
commander, who officials said was killed while trying to negotiate
with the inmates.
   One witness, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the
prisoners captured after the assault were questioned in a park
outside the prison, then taken back inside. Members of the Fox team
also entered the prison, and more than 30 gunshots were heard after
that.
   The governor of Nayarit, Celso Humberto Delgado Ramirez, said in
a television interview Sunday that only one assault occurred, but
did not discuss the attack further. Delgado was in Mexico City on
Monday but could not be located for comment.
   The Fox and Scorpion teams are based in Mexico City, but Fernando
Arias, a spokesman for the federal attorney general's office, said
on Monday the prison uprising was a state matter.
   ``It has been completely in the hands of the state government,
and we are not investigating or taking part because legally there is
no reason to,'' Arias said. ``The two teams were sent by the federal
district government on loan to and under the orders of Nayarit.''
   Officials said 21 inmates died during the assault, but the NBC
videotape showed 13 prisoners lying outside the prison being
questioned by police. All were alive, although at least two appeared
to have suffered bloody wounds.
   Five prisoners could be heard giving their complete names:
Benjamin Gambero Anzaldo, Jose Luis Parra Leyva, Arturo Torres
Casillas, Ricardo Hermosillo Guzman, and Enedino de la Cruz Simon.
   Those names later appeared on a list of dead provided to The
Associated Press by Flores and confirmed by Ernesto Medina, deputy
director of criminal investigations for the state.
   Castillo said she was held by four inmates in a room and that one
of them, Jose Martinez Palafox, was captured alive. His name also is
on the list of the dead.
   ``We were rescued by a special team, the Fox I believe it was
called. There was quite a bit of shooting. They killed all the
inmates there, except one,'' Castillo said. Palafox surrendered, she
said. ``He was not wounded. But they killed him anyway.''
   Castillo said she was treated well when first she was taken
hostage, ``but later they started pushing and shoving and
mistreating us.''
   She criticized the governor for calling in the special police
squads.
   ``They came in and shoved everyone aside, including the local
police. The judicial police or even the local army could have
handled it,'' she said.
   Brenda Margarita Rubio, a prison records clerk held hostage, told
a similar story. ``They surrendered,'' she said. Only one prisoner
was in the room with her and about a dozen other hostages, and that
prisoner walked out with his hands raised, she said.
   The death toll was given Friday night as six, but on Saturday
jumped to 22, then 24. A state government spokesman said Monday the
confirmed toll was 25.
   State judicial police Cmdr. Sergio Anzaldo said Sunday that six
prisoners and seven guards suspected of collaboration were in
custody.
   Medina, Anzaldo and other officials could not be reached by
telephone Monday for further comment.

   Passengers on a plane that was forced to
land when the fuselage tore open at 31,000 feet Monday said that
although the experience was frightening, there wasn't mass panic.
   ``The crew was marvelous,'' said Lucille Lobene, 63, a passenger
from North Miami Beach, Fla. ``There was no screaming, no hysteria.''
   ``The passengers were absolutely superb,'' added the plane's
co-pilot, Garland Jones, 40, who is based in New York.
   Eastern Airlines flight 251, a Boeing 727 en route to Atlanta
from Rochester, N.Y., made an emergency landing at Yeager Airport
after a crack toward the rear of the plane began opening, officials
said. Two minor injuries were reported.
   The jet, carrying 104 passengers and six crew members, lost cabin
pressure but experienced no other sudden trouble, said Federal
Aviation Administration spokesman Jack Barker, in Atlanta. The
opening in the fuselage was ``about a 14-inch square hole,'' Barker
said.
   ``When you felt cold air right away you knew the outside was
coming in,'' said Elaine Davie, 40, a passenger from Rochester, N.Y.
   Davie said none of her childrens' oxygen masks worked, and her
5-year-old daughter Christina began screaming.
   ``She was just too young to understand what was going on and we
couldn't get to her right away,'' she said.
   Jones said he suspects the masks didn't work because passengers
didn't pull them all the way down. The oxygen flow is triggered by
the pulling action, he said.
   Another passenger, David Moore, 39, of Phoenix, Ariz., said he
was concerned about an unusual noise before takeoff.
   ``There was a definite wind noise, not from the back of the plane
but from above our heads,'' said Moore. ``The (second officer) came
back, looked at it and decided it wasn't anything.''
   But Jones disputed Moore's account and said the second officer
went to the rear of the plane to help flight attendants close the
aft door prior to takeoff.
   When the hole broke open, ``I looked up, and I could see sunlight
shining through,'' Moore said.
   Passenger Sam Piazza, 55, a former pilot of Boca Raton, Fla.,
said he and his wife at first thought a bomb had exploded. ``We were
cruising along and you could hear the rush of the wind and the pitch
of the wind and all of a sudden you could hear a big pop,'' he said.
   Piazza said the noise from the wind obscured the crews' attempts
to talk to passengers over the flight intercom.

   President-elect George Bush's son and grandson
returned to the United States from earthquake-stricken Armenia on
Monday, with the younger Bush saying the visit enabled him to feel
the real meaning of Christmas.
   John E. Bush and his son, George, 12, had flown to the Armenian
capital of Yerevan on a relief flight Saturday. They toured the
disaster zone in a bus, stopping at a children's hospital to deliver
candy bars and gifts.
   ``I think we did some good for our country,'' the elder Bush said
at John F. Kennedy International Airport. Of the earthquake victims,
he said, ``We're doing good for them in a specific way, so I was
privileged.''
   Bush, 35, a Miami real estate developer, stopped with his son in
Spitak, which was destroyed by the earthquake Dec. 7.
   ``We'd seen it on television every night, but to be there is
different, I think more profound,'' he said. ``We take for granted a
very good life.''
   ``It was very sad to see these kids my age'' in the hospital,
said his son. He said he thought they ``were happy to get presents
from a person from across the world.''
   The younger Bush said he hadn't minded spending his Christmas
away from home. ``Many people think Christmas Day is a day when you
open presents. But it's to celebrate Jesus' birth,'' he said. ``I
had the Christmas spirit.''
   Their flight was organized by Americares, a relief organization
in New Canaan, Conn. Steve Johnson, a vice president of Americares,
said the flight carried about $3 million in supplies, mostly medical.
   Bush said he returned with a list of needs given him by an
Armenian church official, including medicine and computer equipment
   An estimated 55,000 people were killed in the earthquake and half
a million were left homeless.

   Health Department officials took samples of the food that was

   The menu included turkey and trimmings, chicken, ham, greens, egg
nog and pie.

   Animal rights activists turned out in force Monday
to try to disrupt fox hunters and prevent the killing of their
quarry.
   All around the country, packs of dogs and red-coated riders
thundered across fields and over fences in pursuit of foxes, as they
always do on Boxing Day, a nationwide holiday the day after
Christmas.
   The Hunt Saboteurs' Association, marking its 25th year of
anti-hunt activities, was out in the field too _ laying false trails
and using their own hunting horns to try to confuse the dogs.
   Placard-waving activists confronted the Surrey Union Hunt in
Guildford, south of London, and scores of hunt saboteurs mingled
with onlookers and booed, shouted and chanted ``Scum'' as the
hunters clattered down the town's cobbled high street on their sleek
horses.
   Supporters carried placards reading: ``Stop this bloody cruelty''
and ``Hunting is a crime not a sport.''
   In Mortimer, Berkshire, southwest of London, police moved in when
activists became involved in angry exchanges with members and
followers of the Garth and South Berks Hunt. Three men were arrested
after the reins of one of the horses were cut, police said. Two were
charged with breach of the peace and the third was being questioned
about alleged criminal damage.
   Police reported angry scenes between hunt supporters and animal
rights activists at the start of the Albrighton Hunt meet at Hagley,
Worcester, in central England.
   A police spokesman, speaking anonymously, said a hunt saboteur
spattered several people with fake blood but there was no serious
trouble and no arrests were made.

   The Midwest was socked by a winter storm Monday, with up to a
foot of snow burying parts of South Dakota and wind chill
temperatures plunging to 45 degrees below zero.
   Much of the East Coast and the South basked in sunshine.
   The large winter storm brought widespread ice and snow from
Indiana to Montana, making driving conditions very hazardous.
Portions of Interstate 90 in southern Minnesota were closed because
of poor conditions.
   A number of car accidents was reported in southern and central
Minnesota and in northeast Indiana.
   In Illinois, up to 8 inches of snow blanketed Rockford, and the
western suburbs of Chicago had 7 inches.
   Temperatures were bitterly cold from Minnesota across the Dakotas
to Wyoming and Montana. Wind chill temperatures dropped to around 45
below zero at Jamestown, N.D., Livingston, Mont., Douglas, Wyo., and
Rapid City, S.D.
   Winter storm warnings for heavy snow were in effect for Minnesota
and most of the Dakotas. Snowfall ranged from 6 to 12 inches with
over a foot in the Black Hills of South Dakota.
   Winds were gusty as well. Winds whipped to 46 mph at Russell,
Kan., and to 69 mph at Guadalupe Pass, in western Texas.
   The cold air was to spill into the Southwest on Tuesday morning.
A frost warning was in effect for inland valleys of Southern
California and a freeze warning was issued for the deserts of
southwestern Arizona.
   But sunshine prevailed across most of the East Coast and Gulf
Coast states. Afternoon temperatures ranged from the teens and 20s
over northern New England to 60s and 70s across the Gulf Coast
states. Readings were in the 70s over much of Texas and southern
Louisiana, and the 80s over southern Texas and southern Florida.
   Temperatures around the nation at 2 p.m. EST ranged from 7
degrees below zero at Cut Bank, Mont., to 84 degrees at Harlingen
Texas and Fort Myers, Fla.
   The nation's low Monday morning was 21 degrees below zero at
Warroad, Minn.
   Tuesday's forecast called for snow from northern Michigan across
the upper Mississippi Valley and central Plains to western portions
of the southern Plains; sleet and freezing rain from central and
northeast Oklahoma, and over portions of New York and Pennsylvania;
snow through parts of New England; showers and thunderstorms from
the lower Great Lakes across the Ohio and lower Tennessee valleys
and the middle and lower Mississippi Valley to the southeast half of
Texas; rain along the northern Pacific coast with snow inland over
the northern Plateau region; and windy over the central and southern
Plains.
   High temperatures were forecast in the single digits and teens
from Minnesota through the northern and central high Plains to the
northern Rockies; in the 50s and 60s through the middle and south
Atlantic coast states, the central and southern Appalachians, the
Ohio and Tennessee valleys, much of Arkansas, central Texas, the
desert Southwest and much of California; into the 70s in the central
Gulf Coast region; the 70s and 80s along coastal Texas and most of
Florida; and in the 20s, 30s and 40s around the rest of the nation.

   Investigators were trying to
determine Monday what caused an 18-car passenger train to jump the
tracks, stranding nearly 300 holiday travelers overnight but
injuring no one, Amtrak said Monday.
   The passengers aboard the California Zephyr remained on the
train, which still had light and heat, for several hours until a
work train Monday brought them here in two trips aboard seven
cabooses.
   ``We know what happened, not why it happened,'' said John
Jacobsen, Amtrak director of public relations in Washington, D.C.
   Jacobsen said some of the wheels slipped between the rails,
causing the cars to go off the tracks.
   ``The wheels dropped down between the rails and that's what kept
it upright,'' he said. ``The train couldn't move because it was
locked into place by the rail.''
   But, he emphasized, ``I don't know whether there was a problem
with the rail,'' and added that any number of things could have
caused the accident.
   ``That's all under investigation,'' he said.
   Rick Davis, Amtrak liaison for the Denver & Rio Grande Railroad,
which maintains the track, said it was premature to say what caused
the derailment.
   Jerry Pilcher of Chicago said passengers took the derailment in
stride, in part because the train already was several hours behind
schedule. ``There was a bit of caroling. It couldn't have gone more
smoothly if it had been a drill,'' said Pilcher.
   The train, carrying 294 passengers and about 15 crew members,
originated in Chicago and was headed for the West Coast. It was 150
miles west of Denver and 10 miles east of here when it left the
tracks Sunday night.
   It was snowing heavily at the time and about a foot of snow was
on the ground, but that shouldn't have had any bearing on the track,
Jacobsen said.
   Some passengers compared the derailment to a rough airplane
landing or driving over cobblestones.
   ``It was a miracle no one got hurt,'' said Wardell Copeland of
Vallejo, Calif. ``It was amazing that none of the cars went off into
the (Colorado) river. About 15 feet and that would have been it.''
   ``I was asleep and all at once ... I thought we were going over a
bridge,'' said Carolyn Johnson of Lincoln Neb. ``It just got real
rough and the train stopped.''
   Up to 40 Denver & Rio Grande maintenance crew members worked on
the grounded train Monday trying to get it back on the track but
said it could take until Tuesday. The railroad maintains the track
on which the Zephyr was traveling.
   Most passengers took buses to Salt Lake City or back to Denver.
   Jacobsen said the damage to the train was probably minor.
   An Amtrak derailment in Colorado in 1985 sent 26 people to the
hospital. Seven cars left the track in a canyon near Granby,
northwest of Denver.

<HEAD>Dole Says Labor Department Should Take Leading Role on Child Care
Issue</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SALISBURY, N.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Elizabeth Hanford Dole, President-elect
Bush's choice to be Labor Secretary, said Monday the department
would take a leadership role on the issue of child care.
   ``Women with children need help with child care so they can
work,'' she said. ``We have a changing work force and we have to be
sure we anticipate what the needs will be and be sure that training
is provided.''
   She said she also was interested in a wide range of other issues,
including ``continuing education, eliminating illiteracy,
discrimination, the fairness issue, safety, pensions _ you just go
through a whole range of issues.''
   ``It will be a real opportunity to be involved with helping the
inner-city poor,'' Mrs. Dole said in an interview with the Salisbury
Post. ``But the main thing will be to protect the welfare of working
men and women _ the working family _ and establish policies that
will really provide an opportunity for employment. I'm very much
oriented to helping people get a job and improve their working
lives.''
   She said the Cabinet position would give her a chance to make a
difference in the education and training of young people so they'll
have the skills they need in later years.
   ``The work force has changed and it will change more,'' Mrs. Dole
said. ``And young people will have to be sure their skills match the
needs.''
   Mrs. Dole, a Harvard-educated lawyer who served as transportation
secretary during the Reagan administration, said she and Bush had
discussed her areas of interests for several weeks before he offered
the job Thursday.
   ``He had ... told me he'd like to have me in his administration,
and I had described to him what I was thinking of doing outside of
government,'' she said.
   Mrs. Dole said she had set up a number of speaking engagements
and had several job offers from corporate boards and law firms.
   ``But my feeling was the centerpiece of my life was where I could
really make a difference to people, in helping to relieve some of
the most pressing needs,'' she said.
   The North Carolina native left her post as transportation
secretary to work for the unsuccessful 1988 presidential campaign of
her husband, Sen. Bob Dole, R-Kan.
   In announcing her selection Saturday, Bush said the fact that
Mrs. Dole is married to the Senate minority leader played no role in
his decision, saying, ``This appointment stands on its merits.''

   John Mulroy, who died in the Pan Am jet
crash in Scotland, was eulogized Sunday as a man of ``sincerity,
diplomacy, gentle dignity, kindness, special grace, and
intelligence'' at a memorial Mass.
   Michael McDonald, a friend of Mulroy's for 30 years, told a group
of 500 worshipers that Mulroy had been like a ``father, brother,
confessor, and guidance counselor'' to him over the many years of
their friendship.
   Mulroy, who was director of international communications for The
Associated Press, was flying home with his son Sean, his
daughter-in-law Ingrid, his sister Bridget Concannon, her husband,
Thomas, and their son Sean, all of whom died in the Wednesday crash.
   The Rev. Augustine Sheehan, the parish priest at the St. Francis
of Assisi Church in this Long Island community, described Mulroy as
``a true gentleman'' who was ``upright, honest, dignified,
respectful and considerate of others.''
   Mulroy had spent 25 years with Pan American World Airways before
joining the AP in August 1984.
   The 59-year-old naturalized U.S. citizen was born near Cloongee,
Ireland, where he vacationed each summer.
   Among those attending the service were AP communications
executives who had flown in from London and Frankfurt, West Germany.

<TEXT>
   An Eastern Airlines jet carrying 110
people tore open at 31,000 feet Monday, causing the airliner to lose
cabin pressure and forcing an emergency landing, authorities said.
Two minor injuries were reported.
   A Federal Aviation Administration official said cracks were found
on the same plane's fuselage in two previous inspections.
   Bobbie Mardis of the FAA's safety data branch in Oklahoma City
also said mechanical problems forced the aircraft to make
unscheduled landings on two occasions since 1985.
   The Boeing 727 en route to Atlanta from Rochester, N.Y., landed
at Yeager Airport with a hole in the fuselage that opened up 50
miles, or a few minutes' flying time, north of Charleston, officials
said.
   The jet, carrying 104 passengers and six crew members, lost cabin
pressure but experienced no other sudden trouble, said Federal
Aviation Administration spokesman Jack Barker in Atlanta.
   The opening in the fuselage was ``about a 14-inch square hole,''
Barker said. ``Those things start with a crack and end up as a
hole.''
   There was no immediate indication of the cause of the tear near
the top of the jet, which was about 20 years old, Barker said.
   The passengers put on their oxygen masks, and the pilot flew the
jet to 10,000 feet, an altitude that requires no pressurization,
Barker said.
   Two passengers were taken to the Charleston Area Medical Center
for treatment of minor injuries, a hospital spokesman said.
   ``They are being treated for injuries as a result of the
decompression ... nose bleeds, headaches, that sort of thing,'' said
spokesman Gary Chernenko.
   Passengers described the sudden blast of air that whipped through
the craft when the hole blew open.
   ``When you felt cold air right away you knew the outside was
coming in,'' said Elaine Davie, 40, a passenger from Rochester, N.Y.
Her ears still ached after popping when the plane quickly descended,
she said.
   Passenger Sam Piazza, 55, of Boca Raton, Fla., said he and his
wife at first thought a bomb had exploded. ``We were cruising along
and you could hear the rush of the wind and the pitch of the wind
and all of a sudden you could hear a big pop,'' he said.
   Another passenger, David Moore, 39, of Phoenix, Ariz., said he
was concerned about an unusual noise before takeoff.
   ``There was a definite wind noise, not from the back of the plane
but from above our heads,'' said Moore. ``The (second officer) came
back, looked at it and decided it wasn't anything.''
   But co-pilot Garland Jones, 40, disputed Moore's account and said
the second officer went to the rear of the plane to help flight
attendants close the aft door prior to takeoff.
   When the hole broke open, ``I looked up, and I could see sunlight
shining through,'' Moore said.
   The roof of a 19-year-old Boeing 737 tore off an Aloha Airlines
flight at 24,000 feet on April 28, killing one person and injuring
61. The accident was blamed on cracks in the fuselage skin from
repeated pressurization and depressurization of the cabin.
   That accident prompted a federal investigation into the aging
fleet of jets, and the FAA ordered airlines to replace rivets
believed to have caused cracks.
   Eastern spokeswoman Karen Ceremsak in Miami said the Eastern jet
has always been owned by Eastern, was delivered to the company in
the late 1960s and was maintained according to FAA guidelines. ``It
had an inspection of the crown in September _ that's the whole top
area from the cockpit to the tail,'' she said.
   ``We don't know what he cause is yet, we've dispatched a team of
mechanics to Charleston,'' she said.
   Ms. Mardis said a fracture 3@32 of an inch large was found in
the jet during a 1987 safety inspection in Atlanta, and a 5-inch
crack was found in 1986.
   She said one unscheduled landing was made when a hydraulic
pressure system failed, and the other when an engine compressor
failed. Ms. Mardis did not say where the landings were made, but
said they were reported in 1985 and 1986.
   ``We were just going along, and they were serving the first-class
passengers and all of a sudden air started to rush by and it was
kicking up dust,'' said Bill Tretter, 25, of Buffalo, N.Y., who was
traveling with three family members.
   Co-pilot Jones said the air traffic controller and the passengers
handled the situation well. ``It was a very unusual occurrence, but
the procedure we practice all of the time,'' Jones said. ``It went
very well.''
   Airport Police Chief Robert Barnette said the hole was 6 to 8
inches wide on the left side of the aircraft near the tail.
   ``It was a tear,'' Ms. Ceremsak said. ``The metal did not
actually leave the fuselage. It was at the top of the fuselage,
right over the last rows of the aircraft.''
   Barnette said he learned at 9:10 a.m. of the plane's request to
land.
   ``As far as I was concerned it was a normal landing,'' said the
air traffic controller who guided the plane in. He spoke on
condition of anonymity. ``I asked if he needed assistance and he
said no. There was no emergency crews needed on the runway.''
   Boeing Commercial Airplanes spokesman Tom Cole, reached at home
Monday, said he did not have the jet's records in front of him but
could not recall any serious structural problems with the 727. He
said there have been cracks in some 727s over the years, as with all
jetliners, but nothing unusual.
   Boeing Co. had shut down nearly all operations for the holiday.
   After the incident is studied and it is determined how the tear
occurred, Boeing will notify all operators of 727s of similar age
and use ``to tell them all what we found out so they can check their
airplanes,'' Cole said.
   The three-engine jet went into commercial service in 1964.
Production ended in 1984, with 1,831 delivered. According to a
Boeing inventory for the end of 1987, Eastern had 122 727s in its
fleet.

   A storm bearing up to 12 inches of snow and wind chills as low as
45 degrees below moved through the Plains and Midwest on Monday,
closing highways and backing up air traffic just as holiday
travelers were heading home.
   ``Everything around here is in bad shape because of the weather,
and it's getting worse by the minute,'' said Ray Noll, a reserve
officer with the Porter County, Ind., sheriff's department. At least
25 cars were involved in a pile-up on an interstate highway in the
northern Indiana county, police said.
   Another pile-up of as many as 30 cars was reported in Indiana's
northeast county of Porter when a propane tanker overturned on
Interstate 65 Monday morning, state police said.
   Snow fell or was in the forecast from the Rockies and upper
Plains as far east as Ohio. Accidents and blowing snow closed
segments of interstate highways in several states, including Utah,
Minnesota, Indiana and South Dakota.
   Up to 12 inches were forecast in Minnesota and 10 inches in South
Dakota by Tuesday.
   ``We got a report that the weather was going to turn bad, and we
decided to leave a couple of days earlier than we intended to,''
said Vic Waters of Viroqua, Wis., who was heading east from Sioux
Falls, S.D. ``We found the roads were looking like we probably made
the right decision.''
   The storm knocked out power to more than 50,000 homes and
businesses in eastern South Dakota Monday afternoon for about two
hours when high winds caused power lines to bang together and
short-circuit, said a spokesman for Northern States Power Co.
   The snow caused delays of at least 30 minutes for planes taking
off and landing at Chicago's busy O'Hare International Airport, said
a Federal Aviation Administration duty officer who wouldn't give her
name.
   United cancelled all of its flights O'Hare on Monday afternoon,
said spokesman Rob Doughty. It was not known how many flights were
affected but on normal day, United has 400 departures from O'Hare,
he said.
   Wind chill readings fell to 45 degrees below zero in Jamestown,
N.D., Livingston, Mont., Douglas, Wyo., and Rapid City, S.D.
   It was the same storm system that earlier brought up to 2 feet or
more of snow in the West, with the mountains of Utah and Colorado
particularly hard hit. Powder Mountain, Utah, reported 26 inches of
snow.
   In Durango, Colo., two men were hospitalized in good condition
Monday after being buried under snow for nearly seven hours. They
were rescued by passers-by who heard their screams. The area was
under an avalanche warning.
   In Utah, officials warned of avalanches in mountains and Wasatch
Front after 8 inches of snow were forecast for the areas.
Authorities warned that large, spontaneous avalanches were likely on
all slopes above 7,000 feet elevation.
   The storm kept Utah Department of Transportation crews busy
Sunday, and at least one section of Interstate 84 was closed Monday
because of drifting snow.
   ``I don't know that any of them (crew members) were home for
Christmas,'' said Lynn Millard, a maintenance supervisor for the
department.
   Mountain areas of Arizona reported 2 to 5 inches of snow Sunday
evening to Monday morning, while parts of Montana got up to 8 inches
in the same period.
   Warroad, Minn., had the nation's low temperature Monday morning _
21 degrees below zero even before the wind chill was factored in. It
was 18 below at Cut Bank, Mont., and 14 below zero at Lovelock,
Nev., and Butte, Mont.
   Parts of Montana remained below zero during the day.
   By midday Monday, portions of Minnesota, Wisconsin, Iowa and
Illinois were getting snow at a rate of 2 inches an hour and had 8
inches by early afternoon. The western suburbs of Chicago had 7
inches of snow.
   ``If I could, I'd stay home and watch the football game today,''
said Rockford police Sgt. Colin Anderson.
   Snow, sleet and freezing rain were reported in Missouri and
elsewhere in Illinois.
   ``We're getting a lot of cars skidding out and sliding off the
roads,'' said Sgt. Malcolm Burnett of the Illinois State Police
office in Springfield. ``We've got snow and sleet in the north and
freezing rain further south.''
   ``They've forgotten how to drive on this stuff,'' said Lt. Ralph
Henson of the Illinois State Police station in Ashkum in the
east-central part of the state, where about 15 accidents were
reported in the first hour of snowfall.
   The cold extended all the way to the West Coast. San Francisco
had a non-official low of 27 in Golden Gate Park, and three bridges
northeast of Oakland closed because of ice on the road, officials
said.

   President Hosni Mubarak says he is willing to
go to Israel _ if it would help bring peace to the Middle East _ in
what would be the first trip to Israel by an Arab leader since Anwar
Sadat's daring 1977 visit.
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir of Israel said he would welcome a
visit.
   Mubarak made the offer in two weekend interviews. However, he
told the Tokyo newspaper Yomiuri on Sunday that he would go only if
Israel extends the invitation unconditionally. ``I don't accept any
preconditions,'' he said.
   In responding to Mubarak's initial offer, made through an
interview with the Kuwait newspaper Al-Anbaa, Shamir said Sunday
that he would be ``very happy to receive him in Israel.''

   In Christmas messages, world and spiritual leaders urged a new
surge of generosity to help heal the wounds of people whose lives
have been shattered by the Armenian earthquake, the Pan Am crash in
Scotland and the AIDS plague.
   ``Our hearts and prayers go out to those who have been injured
and bereaved and it is my hope that the eternal message of Christmas
will bring some comfort in the hour of sadness,'' Queen Elizabeth II
said in an unprecedented update of her annual Christmas message.
   In Bethlehem, the hilltop town in the Israeli-occupied West Bank
where Jesus was born, steady rain and the yearlong Palestinian
uprising dissuaded crowds of pilgrims from celebrating Sunday's
holiday.
   Several hundred people chanted Mass in the Church of the Nativity
while Israeli soldiers chased stone-throwing youths in the town's
streets. In the occupied lands, one Palestinian was killed and 16
were reported wounded in clashes with Israeli troops. Arab reports
said a second Palestinian died of wounds suffered in an earlier
clash.
   Pope John Paul II set the tone of compassion for the holiday in
offering his Christmas wish: that ``science and love'' would find a
cure for the deadly scourge of AIDS.
   In Armenia, President-elect Bush's son, John, and grandson,
George, toured the disaster area and passed out candy bars and games
to injured children at a hospital.

   The vice-chairman of the Senate Intelligence
Committee says the possible presence of a CIA operative on the Pan
Am jet that crashed last week probably would not, by itself, have
provoked a terrorist attack.
   Sen. William Cohen, R-Maine, said Sunday on ABC's ``This Week
With David Brinkley'' that he could not confirm whether the CIA
agent had been on the flight.
   But Cohen said that even if the agent had been aboard it would
not necessarily be significant because terrorists ``could have
eliminated him'' by direct assassination on the ground.
   ``I don't think you can draw any connection one way or another at
this point,'' Cohen said.

   This farm town is unaccustomed to being in

10,000-acre spread in ``God's country'' is a favorite hunting spot
of President-elect Bush.
   The president-elect today was to begin a four-day visit to Will
Farish's Lazy F Ranch. For the past 20 Christmas seasons, Bush has
retreated there to tote a shotgun through the South Texas mesquite
in search of quail and other game birds.
   Nobody paid much attention until the vice president became the
president-elect. And some in this town of 15,000 are applauding the
change.
   ``It would bring a lot of tourists to town,'' said Janice Porter,
manager of the Beeville Chamber of Commerce. ``It would do a lot for

   President-elect Bush's choice to lead the
Defense Department says an emphasis on weapons systems that depend
on fewer people may help the Pentagon meet its needs in a time of
budgetary constraint.
   ``The big cost is not in the B-2 (bomber), the B-1 and the
aircraft carriers,'' former Texas Sen. John Tower said Sunday. ``The
big cost is not in the hardware, the big cost is in personnel.''
   Tower, Bush's designated defense secretary, said one of his first
priorities would be devising a strategy to achieve national
objectives for defense.
   ``Then we have to look at the roles and missions of all our
forces and see where they fit into that strategy,'' he said on the
CBS-TV program ``Face the Nation.''

   Tobacco has been accused of mischief ever since
people first lit up. But in the United States, it wasn't until a
surgeon general's report 25 years ago that a methodical scientific
indictment was drawn up. Since then, anti-smoking attitudes and
campaigns have steadily gathered force and produced striking change.

   For the employers of the Marlboro Man and the vast majority of
Americans who found comfort and contemplation in smoke rings, the
warnings had been clear, and the formal announcement of 1964 came as
no big surprise.
   Twenty-five years ago next Wednesday, after 14 months of studying
8,000 scientific reports, Surgeon General Luther Terry's blue-ribbon
panel announced that smoking was bad and ``a health hazard of
sufficient importance in the United States to warrant appropriate
remedial action.''
   Statistically linked to lung cancer, heart disease, stroke and
various malignancies of the throat and mouth, smoking was called
health enemy No. 1.
   Remedial action began benignly enough: warnings on cigarette
packs that reminded the fatalistic smoker that he could be killing
himself.
   But in the ensuing years it has become a new kind of uncivil war
which smokers see as a bullying campaign against individual rights
and many non-smokers see as a crusade in which their health and
well-being is at stake, not to mention their carpets and coffee
tables that in years past were vulnerable to falling ash and embers.
   Back in 1964, at an accelerating yearly pace, more than 70
million adult Americans in a population of 192 million smoked more
than 523 billion cigarettes, 7.1 billion cigars and used more than
150 million pounds of tobacco in other forms, a pipeful, a chaw or a
dip of snuff.
   These days, after 2{ decades of warnings and repressions, some 55
million to 60 million Americans smoke out of a population of some
million. They smoke 575 billion cigarettes a year, some 4 billion of
various types of cigars and cigarillos, and they use a little less
than 150 million pounds of tobacco in other forms.
   They smoke less per capita today, but spend a lot more for it.
Most hotels and airports charge nearly $2 a pack, and the price
would make a World War II smoker (18 cents a pack) choke before he
took a drag.
   In 1964, smokers spent $8 billion on the ugly habit, some $3.3
billion of which went to federal, state and local governments as
taxes. Today they spend $35.5 billion on tobacco, and almost $10
billion is collected as tax.
   All of this in the face of a nationwide campaign that has banned
smoking in many federal buildings, work places, restaurants,
airplanes, trains and rest rooms. In terms of a regulation and
educational programs, the scale is unprecedented, save for
prohibition, and the stated aims by health authorities are more
ambitious than any attempt to persuade people to change such an
ingrained habit.
   Three years ago, Surgeon General C. Everett Koop announced he
expected a smoke-free society by the year 2000.
   ``This is not a prohibitive society,'' he said. ``We're not going
to tell people they can't smoke. We learned that we can't tell
people they can't drink.''
   They can, however, devise tactics to isolate and then eliminate
the habit.
   Smelling victory, the surgeon general put on a smile and
suggested that outdoor smoking be mandated in the spring ``and by
the time cold weather comes, it will be well-ingrained in their
habits and they won't come in to smoke.''
   Backed by ``the whole grass-roots movement of militant
non-smokers,'' he said:
   ``I think the person that smokes in 1995 is going to smoke alone
or with other smokers. That might be in his bathroom or his back
yard or in a segregated area. I wouldn't be surprised to see it out
of doors.''
   Even now, the smoker can sense his growing isolation.
   Smokers have felt the elbow in their backs at their local,
formerly friendly bars and were asked to move the ashtray. This is
something like asking the altar boy to douse the incense in church.
   The federal government finds itself on the horns of a dilemma. It
actually controls the growing of tobacco by allotting acreage to
180,000 farms in 23 states and Puerto Rico. This stabilizes
production and insures price levels. The Commodity Credit Corp.
lends farmers money against the value of their crops, the loans
being repaid as the tobacco is sold. For many farms, tobacco is the
one stable factor in an otherwise unpredictable market. Consider:
   Wheat last year yielded $96 an acre. Soybeans yielded $183,
cotton $459, peanuts $632, feed corn $202 and sweet corn $724.
Tobacco yielded $3,206 per acre.
   For many states it is a prime cash crop. North Carolina reaped
$738 million last year, Kentucky $514 million, South Carolina $151
million and so on down the line to West Virginia which reaped $4
million.
   The tobacco industry employs almost 57,000 people who feed the
product to just short of 1 million retail outlets that include
almost 619,000 vending machines.
   The United States exports $3.4 billion worth of tobacco a year,
more than any other country, and the figures grow every year.
   So Uncle Sam condemns the weed, hems in its users, yet encourages
its cultivation and its export.
   Anti-smoking forces, the white hats, while chastising the smoker
for his foolish habit, see him as the victim of sinister forces, the
black hats, the tobacco industry.
   Lori Heise, writing in World Watch, a product of the Worldwatch
Institute, which tries to keep its fingers on the ills of the world,
lambastes what she calls the ``unhealthy alliance'' between
government and the industry.

   She says tobacco remains ``legal today solely by historical
accident and political maneuvering.''
   ``The accident is that millions of Americans became addicted to
tobacco before the hazards of smoking were widely recognized and
before products sold to the public were systematically reviewed for
safety. The maneuvering involves skillful political manipulation by
the tobacco industry to obtain exemption from every law and
authority designed to protect the public from hazardous substances.''
   She says that with falling domestic demand, the industry is
aiming more at foreign markets, especially the Third World and Asia,
where, for instance, 63 percent of men in Japan smoke, 70 percent in
China. Only 27 percent of American men smoke, she says.
   Furthermore, American cigarettes sold abroad are far higher in
tars and nicotine than domestic brands.
   Indeed, those 25 years ago when the surgeon general first
attacked smoking, most smokers cut down and looked to the industry
to provide them with safer cigarettes, which the industry did.
Opponents, who had pressed for safer cigarettes, then pressed for
none at all.
   The strength of the new attack on smoking has the fervor and the
rationale of ``Mothers Against Drunk Drivers.'' The National Academy
of Sciences in 1986 legitimized studies that held that non-smokers
were endangered by environmental tobacco smoke, called ETS.
   That same year, the surgeon general said 20 years of accumulating
evidence allowed the verdict: ``It is now clear that disease risk
due to the inhalation of tobacco smoke is not limited to the
individual who is smoking, but can extend to those who inhale
tobacco smoke emitted into the air.''
   While urging changes, he emphasized that those changes ``should
not be designed to punish the smoker.''
   ``Cigarette smoking is an addictive behavior, and the individual
smoker must decide whether or not to continue that behavior;
however, it is evident from the data presented in this volume that
the choice to smoke cannot interfere with the non-smokers' right to
breathe air free of tobacco smoke.''
   While the studies have been criticized, they are largely
statistical and have not been refuted. But since many smokers have a
guilty conscience about their habit anyway, efforts to fight off the
increasing repression make little headway.
   Not that there have not been efforts. Philip Morris publishes a
glossy, entertaining magazine that has become a rallying point for
smokers militant enough to fight back. Introduced in 1985 with a
circulation of 150,000, the free magazine claims a circulation today
of 12 million and a readership of 24 million.
   It reports local and national efforts to restrict the rights of
smokers and provides a vent for some of the emotions of those who
feel they are persecuted by the non-smoking movement.
   Publisher Guy Smith explains that its surveys produce a profile
of the American smoker that should command attention in the
marketplace.
   ``We want Detroit to know that smokers buy cars _ a lot of cars.
Furthermore, we want Detroit to know that although some people
complain about cars with ashtrays, there are still millions of car
owners who smoke and use ashtrays.''
   If the message is aimed at automakers, it is also aimed at
politicians, restaurateurs and others who serve the general public.
   Consider the Philip Morris statistics: Smokers own 35 million
cars, 5 million of them new last year; they have 38 million TV sets,
23 million VCRs, 5 million home computers, 30 million credit cards.
Sixty-five percent of them are married and 40 percent have children.
Almost 90 percent are registered voters and the vast majority said
they voted in the last election. They are affluent, educated, active
in community affairs and charitable organizations. Every day, 21
million of them go out to eat.
   That does not jibe with the statistics of the non-smoking
movement, which sees smoking as largely a blue-collar problem, the
affluent, better-educated having fled the smoking ranks.
   Everybody's statistics show the number of women who smoke is
bucking an otherwise downward trend, especially young women. The
non-smoking people say this is especially disheartening, because
smoking by a pregnant woman has been shown to be injurious to the
fetus.
   Some 35 million Americans have quit, most of them obeying the
strictures of the American Cancer Society, the American Heart
Association, the American Medical Association and myriad other
health groups allied against smoking.
   As a social experiment, the campaign for a smoke-free America has
made remarkable strides. But it is not the first attempt to stomp
out the lowly weed.
   They tried whipping in Russia and beheading in Turkey, and in
this country health issues were a prime motive in the late 1800s.
Now it's local bans on smoking as in New York City and Beverly
Hills, curtailed advertising and special taxes (35 cents more a pack
in California).
   Today's anti-smoking movement is hard-nosed and persistent,
thanks to federal involvement. It is an emotional confrontation.
``The New Yorker'' magazine recently captured the angst in one of
its cartoons. The skyscrapers of Manhattan rise majestically into
the air, but their turrets and parapets are occupied by half-hidden
members of a SWAT team. Below, huddled and hidden in the dark
shadows of the buildings, are two men, the last cigarette smokers in
New York City.

   Without cigarette smoking our nation would be free from the
tragic toll of 320,000 deaths a year _ that's equivalent to two
fully loaded jumbo jets crashing every day with no survivors.
   The current cure rate for cancer would rise to 55 percent to 60
percent from its current level of 50 percent.
   One-third of all beds in cancer centers would no longer be
occupied by victims of smoking.
   Fewer of our young people would take up drugs since smoking
teen-agers are 15 times more likely to graduate to narcotics.
   The air would be cleaner everywhere _ on planes, in hotels,
sports arenas, restaurants, public buildings, places of employment,
the movies and homes. Some 46,000 deaths to non-smokers would cease.
   And our nation would no longer be paying out $65 billion annually
for medical bills and lost productivity incurred by cigarette
smoking.
   The life expectancy gain for people who would have experienced a
tobacco-related death would be approximately 15 years.
   Families would no longer have to endure the loss of loved ones to
cigarettes and children would no longer have to worry about the fate
of their smoking parents.
   Public health and agricultural officials would no longer confront
us with the paradox of, on the one hand, ordering warning statements
on cigarette packs and the other, providing subsidies for the growth
of a lethal product.
   Funds now invested in research and treatment for smoking-induced
illnesses could be diverted to new areas of promise in medicine and
science.
   The pack of lies, the lady killers, the coffin nails would be
relics of our past. The environment would become safer, healthier
and better for all.
   One would hope that the Marlboro Cowboy could be rehabilitated to
champion enlightened causes _ like ``say no to drugs,'' ``stop drunk
driving'' _ or perhaps encourage people to have annual checkups for
cancer.

   Paradise. That's what the anti-tobacco zealots would call a world
without tobacco. We'd say more a fool's paradise.
   If those opposed to tobacco were to succeed in dictating which
behaviors were acceptable and which were not, life would become very
unpleasant for smokers and non-smokers alike.
   The sad fact is that once the antis eliminated free choice
regardinq tobacco, they would affect free choice itself. The adult
enjoyment of alcoholic beverages could be next on their hit list.
From there, where? What would the self-appointed moralists, with
their predictable self-serving claims, ban next: red meat, eggs,
dairy products, artificial sweeteners, coffee? Would any product or
behavior still be an object of free choice?
   Before we yield to such action, it might be wise to reflect on
what this country is all about. The United States was founded by
inspired curmudgeons who were wise enough to realize that in
protecting others' rights to disagree with them, they were
protecting their own right to disagree with others.
   The Constitution reflects this wisdom. The founders saw the folly
in having one person or group dictate the choices of another person
or group. It also protects the rights of non-smokers.
   From the beginning, tobacco was part of American history. It
served as collateral for loans from France to finance the
Revolution, and its value helped sustain the young nation. All the
while it was freely criticized. In 1604, King James called it a
``loathsome custom.'' The colonists and revolutionaries were
chastised by moralists, but continued to grow and enjoy tobacco as
part of their free choice.
   Who are today's smokers, the people whose choice would be usurped
in a world without tobacco? Everybody. There are nearly 60 million
adults who choose to smoke, part of the fabric of American society.
They raise families, pay billions of dollars in tobacco taxes and
have the same hopes and dreams as anyone else.
   When ``a world without tobacco'' is promised as paradise, do not
forget that the price is loss of free choice, and that is paradise
lost.

   More than 680,000 ``boat people'' have fled
Vietnam since Saigon fell to the communists in 1975 and about
615,000 have been resettled, most by the United States, Canada and
Australia. But in recent years, scaled-down resettlement programs
have left thousands languishing in rude camps. Scores of others die
each year in their flight for freedom.

<DATELINE>BAN THAD, Thailand (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   La Kieu Mai Ly, the 16-year-old
daughter of a rice farmer, fled Vietnam by boat seeking a better
life, expecting to eventually join an aunt in the United States.
   Five days into the voyage in May, Thai pirates in the South China
Sea rammed the boat, drowning many of the 22 passengers. They
attacked those who tried to hang onto the boat to save themselves
with long poles and knives.
   The pirates abducted Miss Mai Ly, her sister, her aunt, and two
other women. They repeatedly raped the women during eight days of
terror and then tossed Miss Mai Ly into the sea. She swam for hours
before another boat rescued her. Her two relatives are still missing
and presumed dead.
   Miss Mai Ly is now staying in this austere camp near the volatile
Cambodian border where Thailand has sent Vietnam's ``boat people''
to discourage more from coming. But she says she would never return
home despite her ordeal at sea and the Thai government's refusal to
allow the boat people to resettle in the West.
   ``I would commit suicide first,'' she says as late monsoon rains
muddy the floor of her bamboo and thatched roof hut.
   The boat people continue fleeing Vietnam more than 13 years after
the communists defeated U.S.-backed South Vietnam in April 1975. But
they are now sailing into a world increasingly reluctant to receive
them.
   More than 680,000 boat people have fled since 1975 and about
615,000 have been resettled, most by the United States, Canada and
Australia. But in recent years, scaled-down resettlement programs
and increasingly restrictive selection have left thousands of
``long-stayers'' languishing in the camps for years, many with
serious psychological problems.
   In 1979, Asian nations already sheltering more than 200,000 boat
people pushed tens of thousands from their shores, killing many, and
threatened to shoot others. But at a Geneva conference in July of
that year, Western nations pledged to resettle the refugees and
Asian nations promised to give them safe asylum.
   That led to a recent surge in the exodus. The refugees from
Vietnam now include not only those fleeing political persecution,
but also ``economic migrants'' and people seeking to join relatives
abroad.
   In 1988, scores of Vietnamese drowned as authorities pushed their
small wooden boats off Thailand. Some were beaten in dreary Hong
Kong camps, others were left to drift and die at sea.
   ``The Western nations are tired of dealing with the problem and
perceive themselves as no longer able to sustain the guarantees they
made in 1979,'' says one senior Western aid official.
   In a recent series of urgent consultations, nations have agreed
to another international conference early in 1989, but this time to
forge a strategy to deter rather than ease the exodus.
   There is some cause for optimism. Vietnam for the first time says
it will take back large groups of boat people. Previously Vietnam
branded them as traitors and allowed only a few to return.
   Vietnam reached a repatriation accord with Hong Kong in October
and seeks agreements with Malaysia and Thailand. In early November,
a Vietnamese delegation visited a camp in Malaysia to persuade boat
people they were welcome back home. But a major problem is that
Hanoi wants only those who volunteer to return, while its neighbors
want to send back anyone who is not a political refugee.
   Of the 60,000 boat people in the region's camps, only about a
dozen have volunteered to return to Vietnam, says Sergio Vieira de
Mello, head of the Asia bureau of the United Nations High
Commissioner for Refugees.
   In Hong Kong, however, 439 Vietnamese have volunteered to return
home. Vietnam pledged they would face no recrimination and Britain,
which rules Hong Kong, has promised financial aid to help them
resettle.
   ``We hope that a successful reintegration of those would break 13
years of assumptions that once they leave Vietnam, their
resettlement in third countries is automatic, that the Eden is there
and they've got to give it a try,'' Vieira de Mello said in an
interview in Bangkok.
   After subsiding for a few years, 28,116 boat people arrived in
neighboring countries in 1987 _ the largest annual flow since 1982 _
and camp populations swelled. In the first nine months of 1988,
37,676 Vietnamese landed, double the number of the same period in
1987.
   That overtaxed the patience of Asia's developing nations,
resulting in the most serious asylum crisis in years.
   Thai marine police and fishermen pushed off or rammed boats that
arrived on the East Coast in a massive smuggling network involving
corrupt Thai, Cambodian and Vietnamese officials. Western aid
officials said at least 100 boat people drowned and others were
attacked by pirates after being turned away. Hundreds of others were
stranded on islands with no regular source of food or water.
   Government officials called the boat people invading economic
``opportunists'' who posed major security problems.
   Thailand halted resettlement abroad and sent all new boat people
to this camp in the nervous no-man's land of the Thai-Cambodian
frontier, alongside some 300,000 Cambodians huddled on the doorstep
of the decade-old war in their country.

   Thailand in April announced restoration of asylum, but sources
say the pushoffs continue.
   ``Asylum across the board is pretty much over in Thailand,'' says
a senior Western aid official.
   Tiny, crowded Hong Kong in June ended one of the region's most
generous asylum programs and began screening new arrivals to
separate political refugees from economic migrants, who are to be
repatriated. Officials said that instead of the ethnic Chinese from
the bourgeois class the communists once persecuted, most new boat
people were peasants difficult to resettle abroad.
   Guards at Hei Ling Chau Center used their feet, fists and batons
to beat Vietnamese on June 19 when they went on a hunger strike
after complaining they were not getting enough food. The medical
staff examined 100 Vietnamese in 45 minutes.
   More than 4,000 other Vietnamese were crammed into the top floors
of a 12-story factory building which U.N. officials likened to a
prison unfit for human habitation. Wooden barriers on the windows
shut out sunlight and there was one restroom for 600 people.
Authorities later decided to close the camp.
   Community groups strongly protested when the government said it
would abandon the system of closed camps where Vietnamese cannot go
outside without special permission. In one public opinion poll, 73
percent of Hong Kong residents surveyed opposed allowing the boat
people to land.
   Malaysia said it was fed up with boat arrivals and threatened to
close its Pulau Bidong camp housing more than 10,000 boat people by
the end of 1989. Officials warned the country would begin turning
away boats from its shores.
   A U.S. Navy ship, the USS Dubuque, abandoned a drifting
ramshackle boat of Vietnamese in the South China Sea in June, and
some starving passengers said they later murdered and ate two boys
on board. Fifty-two passengers survived 37 days at sea, but 58 died.
   The commander of the Dubuque, Capt. Alexander G. Balian, has been
relieved of duty.
   Moreover, pirate attacks have become much more savage. Compared
with the same period last year, the number of Vietnamese reported
dead or missing in attacks in the first nine months of this year
soared from 21 to 428 and those raped or abducted from 61 to 142.
   These tragedies have posed a dilemma: How do you preserve the
right of asylum without encouraging more people to flee?
   Nations attending talks in Bangkok this fall urged a package of
measures, including repatriation, and renewed pledges of asylum and
resettlement based on region-wide screening like that in Hong Kong.
   The United States has quietly expressed support for involuntary
repatriation of economic migrants under certain conditions. In other
major policy shifts, it has proposed a moratorium on resettlement
and narrowing its program to Vietnamese who qualify as immigrants or
are of special humanitarian concern, such as people held in
political ``re-education'' camps because of their U.S. ties during
the war.
   ``We've always had a resettlement-driven policy, but there is a
growing awareness that resettlement has a negative impact'' by
encouraging the boat exodus, says a U.S. Embassy official.
   In a recent interview in Hanoi, Assistant Foreign Minister Vu
Khoan said Vietnam was trying to discourage the boat exodus by
expanding the Orderly Departure Program for people to leave on
regular jet flights, and the resettlement in the United States of
half-American children and former re-education inmates. Vietnam also
now allows people to travel abroad to visit relatives or for work,
study and medical care, he said.
   Western sources say Vietnam also has increased border patrols,
clamped down on boat people smugglers and mounted a public awareness
campaign to discourage flight.
   The Orderly Departure Program has expanded and the 2,221
resettled in the United States in September was a record high month.
The United States has taken half of the more than 145,000 Vietnamese
resettled since the program began in 1979 and has applications from
700,000 others. But establishing a special program for former
inmates remains stalled by political differences with Vietnam.
   Sixty-two percent of some 2,300 Vietnamese who landed in Thailand
in the first half of this year told aid officials they or their
relatives had spent time in re-education.
   Economic policies are ``the main weapon the communists use to
govern the country,'' says Nguyen Huu Giao, a former lawyer who is
the Vietnamese administrator at Ban Thad. ``They cannot control the
population without trying to control their stomachs.''
   Giao, 49, says he spent 10 years in re-education after speaking
out for human rights. He paid a smuggler about $2,500 worth of gold
to flee the country shortly after his release in October 1987.
   He says he would never go back, and like many others at Ban Thad
is convinced that someday he will be granted his wish to start a new
life in the West.
   ``I don't think Thailand will keep us here all our lives,'' he
says. ``I will wait as long as they want.''

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ In the years just following World War I, more
player pianos were sold than standard pianos, but that soon ended on
a sour note, thanks to the coming of the radio and the phonograph.
Now the ole piano roll is rolling again, thanks to a music merchant
in Pennsylvania with an ear for nostalgia.

   Ed Keefer, like the girl in a cartoon from
another era, has a good foot for music.
   At his Classic Player Piano Co., housed in a non-descript
building at the end of a dirt road, the world's great compositions
are performed with no sour notes, no missed trills and no botched
arpeggios.
   ``I'm elementary. I play about three, four or five songs and
that's about it,'' Keefer says. ``That's why players are so great. I
enjoy foot-pumping them and sitting there singing along.''
   Keefer, 33, founded his cottage company two years ago when he
discovered that the last firm manufacturing player pianos had gone
out of business. A music store owner for 12 years, he always had a
steady trickle of customers for the mechanical pianos _ even in this
remote part of northern Pennsylvania _ and figured there were
potential buyers in other parts of the country as well.
   ``In a small town like Seneca I was selling two players a year
and figured someone in L.A. ought to be able to sell 100,'' he says.
   Keefer sold his music store, mortgaged his home and went into
business in 1986. By 1987, the first full year of production, sales
reached $1.5 million. He estimated sales would top $2.3 million in
1989, when all the figures are in.
   ``When we first went into production, we were happy if we could
finish one piano a day,'' says Todd Hart, 28, unofficial business
manager. ``Now we're building five a day. The growth in two years is
staggering.''
   Things have been so busy, no one has even bothered to take the
time to paint the walls or put up a sign.
   Hart watches the bottom line, while Keefer usually spends his
days poring over the operation of a new piece of equipment or going
over various phases of production. Dressed in a flannel shirt and
jeans, the boss is indistinguishable from his carpenters and
technicians.
   Although players comprise less than 1 percent of the overall
piano industry, Keefer says Classic has no competition. It is the
only company in the world manufacturing players regularly, he says.
   The company first began building a line of players under its own
name, but production quickly increased when it received orders to
manufacture several hundred players for Baldwin. Sales were enhanced
this year when Classic received additional orders from Wurlitzer,
which was acquired by Baldwin.
   ``We have our own little niche in the industry,'' Keefer says.
   ``Baldwin sells 50,000 regular pianos a year. They'll sell about
400 players. It isn't worth it for them to gear up production to
increase their volume 1 percent.''
   A few years ago, the last companies to make player pianos _
Aeolian, which Wurlitzer acquired, and Universal _ went out of
business for reasons unrelated to the instrument itself, Hart says.
   Aeolian was a financially troubled company that had spread itself
too thin by building all types of pianos, including players, under
many different names, Hart says.
   Universal, on the other hand, had a good product in its
state-of-the-art player mechanisms, which were inserted into another
company's piano. But the piano supplier went out of business and
Universal was ``up a creek without a piano,'' Hart says.
   A player piano is composed of about 12,000 parts, compared to
8,000 in a regular piano. Like a regular piano, depressing a piano
key causes a wooden, felt-covered peg _ called a hammer _ to strike
a string. In a player, however, the keys are depressed through
pneumatics.
   A paper roll punched with holes passes over a brass bar, which
maintains a constant vacuum either by pumping the foot pedals or by
turning on an electric switch. When a hole in the paper roll passes
over the vacuum, it causes a valve to close and depress the piano
key.
   The greater the number of holes passing over the vacuum bar at
the same time, the greater the number of keys played, which is why a
player can do what a human cannot.
   Customers for player pianos are often people in their 40s and 50s
who have long nurtured an interest in the instruments, he says. With
retail prices ranging from about $6,800 to nearly $9,000, they're
usually not bought on a whim.
   ``Younger people are buying regular pianos and those who are
older than their 50s are just remembering and wishing,'' he says.
   ``Obviously it's enough of a novelty item and there's enough of a
price difference between this and a regular acoustic piano that it's
not a question of, `Gee, do we buy a regular piano or do we buy a
player.' It's, `When can we afford a player, I've always wanted
one.'''
   Despite their nostalgic appeal, players are not just for the
Perry Como set. Piano rolls, which currently cost about $5 each,
have been manufactured continuously since the 1890s in music styles
from the silly to the sublime, from Scott Joplin to Janis Joplin,
ragtime to rock 'n' roll.

   The two companies currently manufacturing piano rolls ``love
me,'' Keefer says. ``They were very supportive when we first started
because for a time, they were without player pianos and, therefore,
without an end product for their product.''
   Time was, however, when player pianos were as common as video
games and stereo systems are now. When players burst onto the scene
in the late 19th century, years of piano lessons became academic to
many a would-be pianist with too little patience or coordination to
learn to play.
   Until the mid-1920s, the question was not whether to buy a player
but which player to buy, says Harvey Roehl, whose Vestal Press has
published dozens of books on the subject.
   Just before World War I, there were more than 40 companies in the
player business and from 1919 to 1925, more players were sold than
standard pianos, according to U.S. Department of Commerce figures.
   Famous composers such as George Gershwin, Edvard Grieg and Claude
Debussy were hired to transcribe their music on piano rolls. In the
early days of ragtime, many tunes that never made it to a printed
score survived only on piano rolls.
   The player was so popular it often usurped regular pianos. Roehl
claims the decline in sales of regular pianos in the 1930s and '40s
was partly because a whole generation of children simply had not
learned to play the piano.
   In one particular cartoon from the era, a young girl, arms at her
side, pumps the pedals of a player while her well-dressed mother
remarks to a friend, ``Yes, my daughter has a great foot for music.''
   ``When player pianos were in their infancy, they were a real
novelty,'' Hart says. ``Even if it was a lousy playing piano, it
would sell because it was a player. If you had a player piano in
your house, it was a big-time party house. It was the place to go on
a Friday night.''
   But the end came even more quickly than the beginning, thanks to
the 1929 stock market crash and the birth of radio and phonographs.
In 1932, not a single player was shipped from the factories, Roehl
says.
   Since the late 1950s, however, interest in players has been
growing, and production was renewed, albeit randomly.
   ``In a sense, it's nostalgia for a lot of people,'' Hart says.
``It gives people a sense of their roots _ Aunt Gertrude had one in
the parlor, grandpa had one in the basement, whatever.''
   As Hart spoke, the rich chords and runs of ``The Shadow of Your
Smile'' wafted through the air from a corner of the warehouse-style
building where the players are given one final test before being
shipped.
   ``He's good, isn't he?'' quips Hart, glancing at a motionless,
dark-haired man listening for imperfections in a Wurlitzer.
   Actually, few of the four dozen employees at Classic play the
piano, and no one _ not even the boss _ owns a player.
   ``Our kids are too little yet. They'd pound on it,'' says Keefer.
   ``I can't afford one,'' jokes Hart.
   It takes Classic 58 hours to build a player _ from assembling the
player mechanisms and building the oak-veneered cabinet to winding
the strings around tuning pens and hand-gluing parachute-type fabric
to small, plastic bellows that operate each key.
   Forty-seven people are involved in the process _ 41 more than
when the company began. That makes Keefer and Hart very happy for
it's one of the few bright lights in the economically depressed
area, which is largely dependent on the oil and gas industry.
   ``Jobs were one of Ed's concerns. There were a lot of people who
needed jobs, a lot of his friends and family who were out of work,''
says Hart, whose brother does the stained-glass designs for the
pianos' sliding doors.
   As he spoke, a piano teacher and a dozen of her students on an
informal tour of the small plant walked by, quietly commenting on
the quality of the sound and the action of the keys.
   ``We like showing off. No problem,'' Hart says. ``In this area,
it's exciting for people to see something that's succeeding.''

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ It's long been suspected that professional
wrestlers are merely actors, though they'd never admit it, and now
some of them are taking their talents to Hollywood. Some are getting
good reviews, such as Andre the Giant in ``Princess Bride,'' but
others are proving, in the words of one reviewer, that ``wrestlers
can't act a lick.''

<TEXT>
   In the world of acting, there are the blue
bloods: Sir John Gielgud. Lord Olivier.
   Enter King Kong Bundy.
   Gielgud and Olivier work on Hamlet. Bundy works on Hulk Hogan's
head.
   OK, so it's not the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art. But Bundy, a
450-pound, bald-domed professional wrestler, is getting his share of
casting calls.
   Bundy and a growing number of his fellow grapplers have gone
Hollywood.
   ``If you think about it, it makes a lot of sense in the right
environment,'' says Myrna Gardner, a World Wrestling Federation
marketing director. ``They're very experienced, great in front of
the cameras.''
   Producers and directors evidently agree.
   Grapplers big, Andre the Giant (7-foot-4) in ``The Princess
Bride,'' and small, The Haiti Kid (a midget) in ``Penitentiary
III,'' currently are available on the shelves of video stores. Bundy
has appeared with Richard Pryor in the film ``Moving'' and appeared
as a guest on the Fox Network show ``Married ... with Children.''
   Jesse ``The Body'' Ventura has enjoyed prime roles in the Arnold
Schwarzenegger box-office smashes ``Predator'' and ``The Running
Man.'' Superstar Billy Graham has a film due soon. Tiger Chung Lee
worked on Eddie Murphy's ``The Golden Child.'' Big John Studd
appeared in 1984's ``Micki and Maude'' and on shows like ``The
A-Team'' and ``Beauty and the Beast.'' Rowdy Roddy Piper's third
film is John Carpenter's ``They Live.''
   And next year, Hogan _ perhaps America's best-known professional
wrestler, the force behind ``Hulkamania,'' a man whose likeness can
be found on more gift items than Elvis Presley _ will star in ``No
Holds Barred.''
   The Hulkster will appear as wrestler Rip Rohrem. Such typecasting
is not unusual: Rarely do wrestlers play romantic leads.
   ``I'm not Robert Redford, I'm a villain,'' says Big John Studd, a
6-foot-9, blond-haired behemoth. ``It doesn't bother me to play that
kind of character. I've been doing it my whole life.''
   Playing that character? You mean wrestlers are acting out there?
   Well, yes, but not the way you think, the wrestlers say. The
performance is not in the ring (at least no one admits to that).
It's developing a persona and taking it on the road, creating a good
or evil character for televised interviews and arenas around the
country.
   Bad guy Rowdy Roddy Piper says he was so convincing in this
violent version of the Strasberg school that irate fans stabbed him
three times and shot at him once.
   ``In Charlotte, N.C., I was stabbed an inch from my heart.
They're carrying me out on a stretcher, and people were spitting at
me, throwing garbage at me,'' recalls Piper, almost wistfully.
   Piper retired from the ring two years ago and turned actor at a
moment when Hollywood was newly receptive to wrestlers.
   ``I think the headlines, the national exposure of Hulk Hogan and
the World Wrestling Federation opened a lot of people's eyes,'' says
Ventura, a former WWF tag-team titlist and current wrestling
announcer. ``People started seeing us in a new light. They finally
realized, `Hey, these guys are talented at what they do.'''
   While tough-guy roles are the norm, some wrestlers have been
asked to play against type. Andre the Giant _ the most hated man in
wrestling, according to one ring publication _ played the gentle
giant Fezzick in the critically acclaimed ``Princess Bride'' and
drew favorable reviews.

   The Giant's acting instincts ``are pure and natural,'' says
director Rob Reiner. ``He never missed a mark.''
   But ``Princess Bride,'' a sweet-tempered, humorous fairy tale,
was an extraordinary use of these king-size performers. The
wrestlers know that more often than not, their build, bulk and
bad-boy reputations land them their parts.
   ``Schwarzenegger, Stallone, (ex-football star) Fred Dryer _ it's
hard to make people sympathize with these guys. They're large,
they're good-looking, surrounded by pretty girls,'' Studd says. ``So
you get John Studd to step on their heads a couple of times and then
people feel sorry for them.''
   When Ventura landed his role in ``Predator,'' he was responding
to a call for a 6-foot-4, 250-pound killer.
   ``I just walked in there, with blond hair down to my shoulders,
about six earrings and a Fu Manchu mustache, and I didn't even
read,'' Ventura recalls. The casting director, he says, ``looked me
up and down two times, then said, `Let's go meet the producer.'''
   Ventura became so friendly with Schwarzenegger during the filming
that the ex-weightlifter invited him back for ``The Running Man.''
The Body has also just finished another film, ``Thunderground,''
which is due out in 1989. It was easy to put wrestling behind him.
   ``I was a 10-year veteran, and that's not the kind of career
that's gonna last forever,'' says Ventura, 37, an ex-biker and
Vietnam veteran whose departure from the ring was hastened by blood
clots.
   Piper made his acting debut battling amphibian-like mutants in
the B-flick ``Hell Comes to Frogtown.'' His review: ``It was
horrible, just a joke.''
   But he was fortunate enough to hook up with director Carpenter, a
wrestling fan, in ``They Live,'' a science-fiction film about a
futuristic America overrun by wealthy aliens-Republicans.
   Piper, an ex-Golden Gloves boxer who lived for years on the
streets of Toronto, says acting turned out to be more of a challenge
than expected. As a wrestler, he was renowned for his sputtering,
stuttering fireworks in interviews before and after matches.
   ``I came out to L.A. originally figuring I was gonna be another
James Dean, you know? But everything I did in wrestling was wrong
for acting. It's just the opposite for movies. When I did the
wrestling interview show `Piper's Pit,' I improvised everything.
That's what people liked _ you know, this guy is winging everything.
   ``But when you take a 40-foot by 20-foot screen, and I'm there
going, `HELLO THERE,' _ I had to learn how to underplay, to get
down, to get subdued,'' Piper says.
   There are some problems. Studd has complaints about sleazy
Hollywood operators. Others object to typecasting. ``Why would I
play a wrestler?'' Ventura asks. ``Everyone knows I can wrestle.''
   And then there're the critics. The New York Daily News reviewed
``They Live'' under the headline, ``They Live, But Who Cares?''
   ``A lot of people have always accused pro wrestlers of, er,
acting in the ring,'' the reviewer wrote. ``But do I feel silly now!
If Roddy Piper is any indication, wrestlers can't act a lick.''
   Piper got the last laugh. ``They Live'' became the nation's
highest grossing film in its first week out. But The Rowdy One
realizes he hasn't earned a star on Hollywood Boulevard, and
unemployment remains just a few nasty write-ups away.
   ``If this movie really goes, I got a chance at being a major
motion picture star,'' Piper says. ``If it don't go, I got a shot at
being just another wrestler.''

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ A decade ago a presidential commission described
American incompetence in foreign languages as ``scandalous'' and
suggested that was one of the reasons for the U.S. trade deficit.
That may be debatable, but the people at the State Department agree
that fluency in a foreign language is not an American trait.
</TEXT>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When it comes to foreign languages, says the
State Department's top linguist, ``Americans are somewhere at the
bottom of the civilized world.''
   And that sure makes Harry Obst's job more difficult. Obst is
director of language services, the person in charge of providing
interpreters and translators to the White House and 30 government
agencies. He spends much of his time scrambling for linguists to
meet the growing demand.
   Sometimes Obst comes up empty-handed and has the unpleasant duty
of informing Cabinet officers or other high-ranking officials that
his bureau is unable to provide an interpreter.
   ``It's very uncomfortable for me as director of this office to
deal with that,'' says Obst, who has about 25 slots each allotted
for interpreters and translators. Also on his calling list are 1,900
private contractors, mostly individuals.
   Obst himself was born in Germany and interprets for visiting
officials from his native land.
   A few years ago, there was jubilation at the State Department
when, after a painstaking search, a Chinese language specialist was
found for a long-standing vacancy. More than 200 applicants had
failed the test.
   But within hours, the linguist was lured away by Occidental
Petroleum Corp. for a salary far in excess of the $40,000 offered by
the State Department.
   ``We never saw the gentleman report for duty here,'' Obst says.
   The United States, Obst says, pays relatively little attention to
linguistic matters as compared with the Soviet Union, China, Japan
and even some smaller countries, such as Cuba.
   The Soviets reward some linguistic virtuosos with prestige
ambassadorships and other key government posts. The outgoing U.S.
ambassador to the United Nations, Vernon Walters, himself a master
of eight languages, says the American goverment should adopt a
similar practice.
   Thomas Pickering, the career diplomat George Bush picked as his
ambassador to the United Nations, is fluent in French, Spanish,
Arabic and Swahili.
   There are many reasons for the lack of interest in foreign
languages among Americans. In some parts of the country, an American
can go a lifetime and not hear any language but his own.
   Europeans have exposure to a multiplicity of languages within a
relatively small area and emphasize language training throughout
secondary school.
   Beyond that, learning a foreign language can be a lonely, arduous
task. The payoff for dedicated study often is long in coming. There
is little appeal for today's American youth to spend hours on end
poring over flashcards in Pushtu.
   Pushtu? That is a language spoken in Afghanistan. When an Afghan
rebel leader visited Washington in 1987, he asked that a native-born
American be his interpreter rather than a naturalized American of
Afghan origin. Not surprisingly, none was available.
   A decade ago a presidential commission described American
incompetence in foreign languages as ``scandalous.'' It argued that
one reason for the U.S. trade deficit, only a fraction then of what
it is now, is that Americans don't speak other languages well enough
to persuade foreigners to buy their products.
   J. William Fulbright, when he was chairman of the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee, described the problem as ``cultural and
linguistic myopia.''
   Sen. Paul Simon, D-Ill., was so concerned that he wrote a book
about the subject eight years ago _ ``The Tongue-Tied American.''
   The concern is shared by Dr. Robert Gard, president of the
Monterey Institute of International Studies in California, one of
the few campuses in the country that turns out accomplished
linguists.
   Gard says the attitude of corporate executives seems to be that
the rest of the world ought to learn how to speak English.

   That certainly was not the attitude of the legendary Emil Fossan,
the linguistic equivalent of Babe Ruth. By 1984, when his 40-year
government career ended, Fossan was helping out the State Department
in 34 languages.
   ``He was the most remarkable translator we ever had,'' Obst says.
   Several years ago, the paucity of bright, bilingual Americans
forced the State Department to drop a requirement that candidates
for the foreign service be fluent in a second language. The reason
was that too many talented people had to be passed over because of
the requirement.
   In other countries, language training ``is mandatory in high
school, mandatory in college, and, as a result, you have a good base
from which you can work,'' Obst says.
   Stephen Bosworth, president of the United States-Japan
Foundation, a private group based in New York, says increasing
numbers of U.S. public schools want to add Japanese to their
curriculum but many can't find qualified teachers.
   He adds that American businesses give low priority to expertise
in Japanese. Given a choice between giving a job to someone trained
in Japanese and another who has a master's in business
administration, ``they'll always pick the one with the MBA,'' he
says.
   At the State Department, a linguist must be able to interpret
simultaneously and consecutively into both his native and acquired
languages, demands that are ``unheard of'' elsewhere, Obst says. He
must be able to toss off colloquialisms on issues ranging from Rio
Grande salinity problems to high energy physics to the nuclear fuel
cycle.
   Linguists say a nimble mind must be supplemented by a number of
other traits as well: motivation, a spirit of adventure, curiosity,
self-confidence, a wish to communicate and ``an omnivorous appetite
for the myriad flavors that foreign cultures come in,'' as the
current issue of the Foreign Service Journal puts it.
   Making life more difficult still for State Department language
recruiters is that the agency's salaries are generally smaller than
those of international organizations, which compete for the same
talent.
   At the State Department, an interpreter without supervisory
responsibilities can earn up to $71,000. For a translator, who deals
exclusively with printed material, the peak salary is $65,000.
   He says salaries at the United Nations are 10 percent to 15
percent higher, but others maintain the gap is even wider.
   Besides the United Nations, the State Department also competes
for linguists with such international organizations as the World
Bank, the International Monetary Fund and the Organization of
American States. Unlike the State Department, these institutions can
hire non-Americans and don't have to worry about security clearances.
   According to Obst, experts in Japanese, Russian, Chinese and
Portuguese are the most difficult to find.
   One New York-based firm provides Japanese-language interpreters
for $450 a day. When it hires a Japanese language free-lancer, the
State Department pays $325 a day, $300 for other languages.
   Still, rubbing elbows with the president during a meeting with a
foreign luminary is one of the attractions of interpreting for the
State Department.
   Stephanie Van Reigersberg, chief of the State Department's
interpreting division and a fluent speaker of Spanish and French,
sat at the side of George Bush during his post-election meeting with
Mexico's new president, Carlos Salinas de Gortari.
   Ms. Van Reigersberg says the psychic rewards of helping out the
president and other top officials compensate for the other
shortcomings of being a State Department interpreter.
   In contrast, she says, at the United Nations, ``it's blah, blah,
blah about structural adjustment loans.''
   ``The people who come tend to stay,'' she says. ``But finding
people is getting to be impossible.''

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ It's called the Four Corners, the area where
Colorado, Utah, Arizona and New Mexico come together, and it's a
region rich in Indian artifacts. A private group has established a
non-profit research center where you don't have to be a trained
archaeologist to get a chance to dig.

<DATELINE>CORTEZ, Colo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Here in the southwest corner of Colorado,
schoolchildren and other amateurs are digging alongside
archaeologists hunting for clues to what happened to the Anasazi
Indians who disappeared from the region more than 600 years ago.
   Stuart Struever, a self-styled archaeologist-entrepreneur and
founder of the Crow Canyon Archaeological Center, calls it a kind of
``intellectual Outward Bound,'' referring to the wilderness training
program that challenges people to test their physical limits.
   About 1,300 people came to Crow Canyon last year to get their
hands in the dirt. They included retirees from New York,
grade-schoolers from Chicago, teen-agers from a nearby Zuni
reservation, Soviet young people on an exchange program.
   Several hundred other people attended the center's traveling
seminars on Southwestern archaeology.
   Under the supervision of trained researchers, the student diggers
excavate the ruins of the Anasazi, the ``ancient ones'' in the
language of some of their apparent descendants, the Navajo.
   The Anasazi lived in the Four Corners region from about 500 B.C.
until their sudden disappearance from much of the region about A.D.
1300, archaeologists say.
   Money for Crow Canyon's research and six full-time researchers
comes from students' fees and contributions from individual and
corporate patrons.
   The center also has programs designed to bring in children from
Cortez and nearby Indian tribes to teach them about the Anasazi.
   Ian Thompson, a Cortez native and local historian who is director
of the Crow Canyon Center, says it has helped raise local
consciousness about the Anasazi and he hopes it will curb some of
the pottery hunting that is destroying much of the Anasazi heritage.
   Crow Canyon lies on the relatively fertile McElmo Plateau,
elevation 6,900 feet, in the shadow of Mesa Verde, where
archaeologists earlier in the century excavated some of the
best-known Anasazi cliff dwellings.
   Crow Canyon's campus just outside Cortez includes research
laboratories, conference rooms, the beginnings of a library,
artifact-filled sandboxes for children under 11, a cafeteria and
dormitories that can house up to 100 people. The dorms are shaped
like hogans, traditional Pueblo Indian dwellings.
   A short drive away, around a series of shallow canyons, are the
excavation sites. A survey begun about five years ago revealed 454
sites of Anasazi ruins in about a 1{-mile circle roughly between the
campus and Sand Canyon, the major excavation site.
   In this area, very little topsoil accumulates over the years, so
it is easy to see centuries-old Anasazi sites ringed by rocks in the
middle of farmers' fields.
   Aside from the major dig at Sand Canyon, a handful of test sites
also are being excavated.
   Bruce Bradley, director of the Sand Canyon excavation, says the
McElmo Plateau is rich in Anasazi ruins but has not been explored
much by archaeologists, who have concentrated more on Mesa Verde and
other sites.
   Bradley hopes to learn more about the final stages of the Anasazi
civilization and perhaps find out what happened to them.
   One day recently, about a dozen adult volunteers were digging
under the sun at one of the test sites near Sand Canyon. Among them
were David and Bernice Gotlieb, a retired couple from New York.
   ``We've been armchair archaeologists _ voyeurs, but this is our
first time with our hands in it,'' said David Gotlieb, 64, as he
rubbed the soil he had just dug through a screen to see if it
contained any pottery shards or other items.
   Digging, he says, gives him ``a sense of history, and the
curiosity that goes with it.''
   The Gotliebs, who uncovered some ancient postholes in their area
the day before, said they planned to come back to dig every year.
   The Gotliebs' supervisor, Mark Varien, says he enjoys working
with lay people.
   Varien, who wears a cowboy hat with beaded Indian band, came to
Crow Canyon after two years as archaeologist for the Zunis.
   ``Archaeology is not this elitist thing that only archaeologists
can do,'' he says. ``Cultural resources are our heritage and people
should be able to participate in that.''
   This is not Struever's first experiment in combining research
with public education. In his native Illinois, as director of the
Center for American Archaeology and professor of archaeology at
Northwestern University, Struever directed the huge excavation at
the Koster site, in Kampsville, which drew thousands of students and
lay archaeologists in the 1970s.
   Struever's introduction to the Southwest came when he moved to
Telluride in 1976 to write a book about Koster. He said he quickly
became a convert to Anasazi archaeology and the ``magical'' region.
   Struever says he wants Crow Canyon to be a prototype for future
archaeological projects.
   Struever went first for support to Ray Duncan, a Denver-based
oilman who also is principal stockholder of Purgatory Ski Area near
Durango, and who grew up with Struever in Peru, Ill.
   Duncan became Crow Canyon's principal benefactor and now is
chairman of the board of directors.
   Thompson says the non-profit Crow Canyon had a $1.2 million
budget this year, about 85 percent of which came from tuition
payments.
   ``It's working its way toward self-sufficiency,'' he says.
   The center also won a National Science Foundation grant for
$62,000 to be used for research.
   Last year it cost $645 for an adult digger to spend a week at
Crow Canyon. For schoolchildren, it usually costs about $60 a day.
   But for children in the economically troubled Cortez area, the
center subsidizes the digging, charging only $2 a day.
   The center also has a $6,000 scholarship fund that allows Indian
students to come dig.
   ``We're trying to elevate the public consciousness here _ we want
them to know about their own area,'' Struever says.

   Game show host Pat Sajak is starting a new
late-night talk show on CBS this week, but he's not bragging that
he's taking on Johnny Carson head-on.
   Neither Sajak nor CBS want to oversell the show the way the
syndicated ``Thicke of the Night'' was trumpeted in 1983.
   ``We don't want that kind of pre-show hype because there's no way
you can live up to it,'' Sajak says. ``We want people to know we're
coming, but we don't want to build up expectations.''
   Sajak says his exposure as host of ``Wheel of Fortune'' will
help. ``People know me. That's half the battle.''
   Sajak has quit the daytime version of ``Wheel of Fortune'' on
NBC, but will continue as host of the nighttime show, the
highest-rated show in syndication.
   ``The Pat Sajak Show'' makes its debut on CBS on Monday, putting
the network back into the talk show business for the first time
since it canceled Merv Griffin in 1972. It was Griffin, who as
producer of ``Wheel of Fortune,'' lifted Sajak, a former TV
weatherman, out of obscurity.
   ``I've always wanted to do late-night television,'' Sajak says.
``That's a pretty narrow thing to aim for. It only took 30 years.''
   CBS turned again to a talk show to try to recoup its late-night
losses. More than a fourth of its affiliate stations deserted the
network's rotating action-adventure shows. But announcement of the
Sajak show has brought most of the defecting stations back.
Apparently 90 percent of the CBS stations will broadcast the show.
   It looks like a renewal of the old talk show wars, when Griffin
on CBS and Dick Cavett on ABC, plus David Frost and Mike Douglas in
syndication, took on Carson. Now, besides Sajak, Joan Rivers and
Arsenio Hall are joining the fray with new syndicated talk shows.
   But this time each show is looking to find its own niche and
audience. Taking on Carson head-on, or even appearing to, as
``Thicke of the Night'' and Joan Rivers tried, is an invitation to
disaster.
   ``We have great respect for Johnny, but we don't plan our show
around him,'' Sajak says. ``I think CBS has realistic expectations.
They don't think we have to knock someone off to be a success.
Actuall, Johnny's been very gracious to me. He once asked me to be a
guest host.''
   Sajak will find himself competing not only against Carson, but
against the first half of NBC's ``Late Night with David Letterman.''
His new show will be 90 minutes, while Carson has long since had his
show cut to an hour. ``When you get going you want to be there as
much as you can,'' Sajak says.
   Once Sajak got the go-ahead from CBS one of the first things he
did was talk to others who had attempted talk shows and failed.
   ``The one thing we kept hearing was that too many chiefs, too
many vice presidents, too many executive producers were running
around giving orders,'' he says. ``Everybody had ideas and the host
was forced to squeeze them all in.
   ``So, we're going to keep it simple. There's just myself and the
producer, Paul Gilbert. We basically make the decisions. CBS has had
the courage of its convictions. Too often going on TV is like a
marriage. You marry someone because you love them, then spend the
next five years trying to change them. I am very wary of network
interference.''
   Sajak, who concedes he is a traditionalist, says he is baffled by
some of the changes in television _ particularly the turn taken by
afternoon talk shows.
   ``I don't know what to make of all this chair-throwing and trash
TV,'' he says. ``I hope it's just a passing fad.''
   He cautions viewers against expecting anything radical. He will
not be different just for the sake of being different.
   ``You make it different by bringing your own personality to it,''
he says. ``It's `The Pat Sajak Show.' That's the only talent I have,
being Pat Sajak. The reason so few people have succeeded in this is
that they feel they should always be in the spotlight and get all
the laughs. You have to step aside and let your guests shine. When
your guests look good, you look good.''
   Sajak recalls that as a youngster he frequently climbed out of
bed late at night to watch Jack Paar, who was host of ``The Tonight
Show'' before Carson.
   ``I was at Jack's house in Connecticut recently,'' he says. ``It
was fun to hear the old stories, get some advice, look at some old
tapes and relive the past a little.''

   Taped to the mirror in David Dukes' dressing room
at the Eugene O'Neill Theater are several pieces of white paper
filled with scribbles. They are his lifeline to understanding the
plot of ``M. Butterfly.''
   But the jottings don't even tell the entire story of the complex
and fascinating play. The actor says the scrawl pertains just to
``my action'' _ what his character goes through, scene by scene, in
this Tony award-winning Broadway hit about a bizarre, 20-year love
affair between a French diplomat and a Chinese opera singer who
turns out to be a man.
   ``It's the only way I can keep the whole play in my mind,'' says
Dukes, who portrays the deluded, desperate diplomat. ``If things
start to go wrong on stage, I'll just stare at the paper for a while
and try to track the character's development again. It's very easy
in a long run to go in directions that you're not quite aware of and
eventually find you're getting too serious or too comic or
whatever.''
   For Dukes, a highly verbal, intense and quick-witted actor, the
role has brought high praise, including cheers from New York theater
critics who came back to see the play after he replaced its original
star, John Lithgow.
   You could describe the 43-year-old Dukes as ``one of those New
York theater actors who always works'' except that he happens to
live in California and works all over television and movies too.
   TV audiences know him from a slew of miniseries: ``Space,''
``Kane and Abel,'' ``George Washington,'' and most recently, ``The
Winds of War'' and ``War and Remembrance,'' in which he played
Leslie Slote.
   Broadway theatergoers might remember him from runs in ``Bent''
and as part of the replacement casts in ``Amadeus'' and ``Dracula.''
Dukes took over from Lithgow in ``M. Butterfly'' last August after
only two weeks of rehearsal. But it's easier, he says, going into a
play that already is running. In fact, he watches his predecessors
for tips.
   ``I believe in selective theft,'' Dukes says with a grin.
``There's a great advantage coming in and replacing somebody. You
get to see the whole thing. John Lithgow, until he saw my dress
rehearsal, never did get to see the whole production.''
   Dukes also talked extensively with Lithgow, who is an old friend,
about the role. The conversations were invaluable.
   John Dexter, the director, was ill and couldn't attend Dukes'
rehearsals. So Stuart Ostrow, the show's producer, and the stage
manager acted as his director. Lithgow also watched Dukes' last
dress-technical rehearsal and used the occasion to tell his
successor everything about the role that Dexter had told him.
   Lithgow's most specific advice?
   ``Remember the music of the play,'' Dukes recalls. ``The speeches
do have a musical tone to them.''
   Ask Dukes for a description of the character he plays, and he'll
quickly say, ``a dork _ an unromantic male who is lucky to have a
wife.
   ``At the same time, the diplomat serves as the narrator of the
play and must tell the story with confidence and assuredness,''
Dukes adds. ``There are a lot of strange, conflicting colors in this
play.''
   To conserve his energy for the marathon that is ``M. Butterfly,''
Dukes hibernates much of the day. He'll do voice-over auditions for
television commercials, since they don't require much physical
effort, but not much else.
   ``There's no way around the fact,'' he says. ``This role does you
in.'' That's why he signed only for a six-month run and is eager to
get home to California and his wife and 5-year-old daughter. His
wife, Carol Muske, teaches at the University of South California and
has a novel, ``Dear Digby,'' coming out in April.
   Still, Dukes will usually go anywhere for a good acting job. That
passion wasn't always there. It wasn't until Dukes did a play his
senior year in high school in Marin County, Calif., that he wanted
to become an actor. He went to college as a math major, but by the
end of his freshman year had switched to speech and drama because
``girls like actors much more than they like mathematicians.''
   After graduating from college, Dukes acted and worked behind the
scenes at the American Conservatory Theater in San Francisco, and
never looked back. For ACT and touring companies that came through
San Francisco, he also worked as a stagehand.
   Dukes began jumping from repertory company to repertory company,
working for the Alley Theater in Houston, the San Diego Shakespeare
Festival, the Mark Taper Forum in Los Angeles, and then the Charles
Street Playhouse in Boston.
   In 1971, Dukes received his first New York show, a revival of
Moliere's ``A School for Wives,'' with Brian Bedford and Joan Van
Ark. It turned into a hit and later toured the country, making his
name known in New York.
   ``Theater work is what I think I do best,'' he says. ``When I
step on a stage, it's a world I know. Cameras and me are not close
friends.
   ``But you've got to do television and film. If I had done more of
it, perhaps they would have asked me to originate this role in `M.
Butterfly,''' Dukes adds. ``Yet I've never burned to be a star. You
have to have enough of a name to get the big parts with the best
people.
   ``I'm also one of those faces, because I change my look for jobs,
that people will look at and say, `Didn't I go to college with you
in Virginia?' I go through that a lot. They think they know me, but
they can't remember where.''

<HEAD>At The Movies: ``Torch Song Trilogy''</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LINDA DEUTSCH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   They said it couldn't be done. ``Torch Song Trilogy,'' the
soul-searching saga of a gay man's life and loves, seemed less
likely than most plays to translate successfully to film.
   The 1982 Broadway hit was memorable for its performances but also
for its stagecraft. A pivotal comedy scene played on two gigantic
beds could be executed only on stage. The controversial ``back room
scene,'' depicting anonymous sexual encounters through implication,
seemed destined to offend on screen.
   But, surprise of surprises, ``Torch Song'' has become a movie and
the result is deeply affecting.
   Harvey Fierstein, who created ``Torch Song'' and won a Tony for
his lead role on Broadway, has skillfully adapted the story and his
own performance to the big screen. He appears in virtually every
scene and is always fascinating to watch.
   ``Torch Song,'' which might have seemed hopelessly dated in the
age of AIDS, turns out to be as relevant as ever on questions of gay
self-respect and parental clashes with a homosexual offspring.
   It is called a trilogy because three stories are interwoven _ all
revolving around Arnold Beckoff (Fierstein), a young gay man who
works as a female impersonator. Part 1 centers on Arnold's
relationship with Ed, his first love. Brian Kerwin manages to give
great appeal to the character of Ed, a bisexual who can't be true to
his male or female lover.
   Act 2 introduces us to Alan, a young model who replaces Ed in
Arnold's affections. Matthew Broderick is sweetly touching as the
doomed Alan who decides to ``marry'' Arnold and adopt a child.
   The finale focuses on the greatest anguish of Arnold's life, his
relationship with his domineering, disappointed mother. But Mrs.
Beckoff is not one of Anne Bancroft's greatest performances. The
role was created on stage by Estelle Getty who gave the part a
vulnerability missing from the shrewish interpretation chosen by
Bancroft and director Paul Bogart.
   To their credit, Fierstein and Bogart have shortened the ``back
room scene'' and carefully labeled each significant development with
dates to stress this is a story of the 1970s, not the AIDs-conscious
1980s.
   ``Torch Song Trilogy,'' which is rated ``R'' for sexual subject
matter, is not a film just for gay audiences. At its heart, it is a
story of interpersonal relationships and the universal search for
love and understanding which transcends sexual orientation.

   Videos reviewed this week: ``Bagdad Cafe,'' ``Candy Mountain,''
``Rikky and Pete''
   
   ``Bagdad Cafe'' (Virgin Vision; VHS-Beta, $79.95; Rated PG)
   
   Eleonore and Percy Adlon, a couple of German filmmakers, fell in
love with the wacky desert light in Bagdad, a defunct town outside
Barstow, Calif. They made a movie about lovable eccentrics who
inhabit a roadside truckstop.
   It's lovely to see the desert light and watch tractor-trailer
rigs hiss by at dusk like the tide, but then there's the rest of
this awkward, conventional, stolidly Germanic film with which to
contend.
   Marianne Sagebrecht plays the plump hausfrau Jasmin who is
stranded at the cafe run by Brenda (CH Pounder), whose slightly
crazed, unfocused rage is unsettling. Jack Palance as a painter is
still Jack Palance.
   This slight, smarmy movie got big mileage at the art houses for
reasons that mystify. It's reminiscent of the Brazilian comedy
``Altemira,'' which had more important things to say about travel,
misfits and entertainment.
   ``Bagdad Cafe'' tries to create an engaging artificiality in that
truckstop's unforgiving desert light. If they'd used a sound stage,
it might have worked. As it is, the desert wins hands down. Trucker,
pass by.

   ``Candy Mountain'' (Republic Pictures Home Video; VHS, $79.95;
Rated R)
   
   Who can resist a subtle, little, too-hip road movie that casts
Tom Waits as a wealthy golf fanatic, Leon Redbone as a Canadian
constable with a jail in his basement, Joe Strummer (The Clash) as a
fascist security guard and Dr. John as a henpecked mobile-home
dweller?
   ``Candy Mountain'' played only briefly in a few art houses, so
the appearance of the video is a service to film buffs in
medium-to-small media markets everywhere. Kevin J. O'Connor stars as
Julius, a bone-headed guitar picker intent on jiving his way into
the big time. When he plays backup _ for free _ for big-timer Keith
Burns (David Johansen), Burns is moved to yell in his face,
``Ba-BOM, ba-BOM, ba-BOM, ba-BOM. Ya got that?''
   Julius, wising to the fact that Burns and some record company
execs are obsessed with finding the fabled Elmore Silk (Harris
Yulin), lies and says he knows him. Silk, it seems, was something of
a guru to the rock world as maker of the world's best guitars, but
he disappeared. No one knows where or why. Now his guitars are worth
thousands of dollars apiece.
   Thus begins Julius' quest to find the master and lure him back
into the financial fold, thereby, in Julius' mind, assuring himself
a record deal.
   Julius careens through the debris of Elmore's past before finding
the master at what seems to be literally the end of the Earth.
   Directed by underground filmmaker Robert Frank, this is a movie
that works on a lot of different levels, and the end is stunning.

<TEXT>
   
   In ``Rikky and Pete,'' they get the car chase scene over early,
leaving a few wrecks but moving on to a charming and funny movie
about how two intelligent Australian misfits try to find their place
in the world.
   Rikky (Nina Landis) is a geologist who moonlights as a folk
singer. Her brother, Pete (Stephen Kearney), is a talented inventor
unable to hold a regular job, enraging his stuffy, wealthy father by
working as a paperboy and using an ingenious mechanical folder on
his rounds.
   They both feel out of place in Melbourne, and when Pete has a
serious run-in with the police sergeant who crippled their mother in
a car accident, they escape to the outback.
   They find people and work they like in a mining town full of
eccentric characters. Rikki sings, they both find romance and they
strike it rich in their own mine _ that is, until the arrival of
their parents and the sergeant.
   Director Nadia Tass has a great cast, including Landis and
Kearney, as well as Filipino actor Tetchie Agbayane as Pete's love
interest. ``Rikky and Pete'' is light and fun, easily able to cheer
up an evening with the VCR.

   ``California Roll'' (CBS) _ Osamu
   
   East is East and West is West, right?
   Not according to Japanese composer and musician Osamu, who's
successfully blended traditional Oriental rhythms with faster-paced
jazz and rock on ``California Roll.''
   For Western music lovers who've heard some pleasing Eastern tunes
but don't know what to buy at the record store, ``California Roll''
is an ideal, aurally palatable introduction.
   The album, which is Osamu Kitajima's third in the United States,
is a showcase for the Chinese koto, a 13-string zither-like
instrument that emits the precise, delicate sound familiar to
Westerners as ``Oriental music.''
   But don't get the idea that ``California Roll'' is nothing but
inscrutable meandering. It's too full of state-of-the-art
electronics for that.
   Osamu plays all the instruments on four of the nine songs that
feature the koto surrounded by a patter of percussion, bells and
synthesized sounds.
   Songs such as ``Escape Space,'' ``Back Street to Paradise'' and
``White in Flight,'' with their sensitive melodies and
slower-than-slow rhythms, lend a sensation of limbo-like suspension
to the listener. (They also wouldn't sound out of place on a ``Miami
Vice'' soundtrack.)
   Osamu can rip out a hot rock guitar lick as well. On ``Leading
Edge,'' the guitar stakes out the melody, followed by a bridge on
the koto. ``Eastern Eyes, Western Skies'' features an extended
guitar solo, as does the even harder-rocking ``Samurai Lover.''
   The title of ``California Roll'' refers to an American version of
that Japanese favorite, sushi. Osamu's musical synthesis gives
Western ears a taste of that country's sonic delicacy.

   ``Big Time'' (Island) _ Tom Waits
   
   Much of Tom Waits' music is difficult, but ``Big Time'' is
impossible. The poor sound quality makes it that way.
   ``Big Time,'' released in conjunction with the concert film of
the same name, contains live performances of songs from Waits' three
most recent studio albums _ ``Swordfishtrombone,'' ``Rain Dogs'' and
``Franks Wild Years.'' Fans already familiar with the material may
find ``Big Time'' of interest. But the uninitiated likely will be
frustrated by the task of trying to decipher Waits' lyrics.
   When his gravel-coated voice isn't too far from the mike, it's
too close. And on three songs that were mixed live to cassette, the
singing is overwhelmed by tape hiss. It's too bad, because the
enigmatic Waits is clever with words. A lyric sheet would have
helped, but Waits' five-piece backup band is mired in aural muck,
too.
   There are times when sound quality that is less than
state-of-the-art enhances a performance _ Bruce Springsteen's
``Nebraska'' album comes to mind. And Waits, last of the beatniks,
is anything but a digital performer. But the small-time sound on
``Big Time'' causes the medium to block the message.

<HEAD>Star Watch: Basketball Coach Inspires Kurt Russell</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HILLEL ITALIE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When baseball stars Mickey Mantle and Roger Maris
made the movie ``Follow Me Home'' in the early 1960s, they inspired
a young Kurt Russell to take up acting.
   Twenty-five years later, he drew upon another sports figure in
preparing for his role in ``Tequila Sunrise.'' Russell, who stars
with Mel Gibson and Michelle Pfeiffer, decided that Los Angeles
Lakers coach Pat Riley had the kind of look his part required, a
look the actor describes as ``relaxed GQ.''
   ``There are very few men that have the confidence to wear ... an
outrageous fashion statement,'' said Russell, who emulates Riley's
slicked-back hair and well-tailored suits in the movie.
   ``I felt that Pat Riley's look was right for this film because he
was arrogantly confident but not offensive. It's very tough to do
that.''
   Russell plays a police officer investigating a drug dealer who is
also an old high school friend (Gibson), and who is involved with a
mysterious Mexican drug lord (Raul Julia). Russell seduces Pfeiffer,
the owner of a fashionable restaurant and Gibson's friend, and uses
her to extract information on the drug dealer.
   ``I feel good about the chemistry of Michelle and myself and
Mel,'' Russell said. ``It reminded me of doing `Silkwood' with Meryl
(Streep) and Cher. I always felt there were three specific people in
the room and they each in a good way brought something to the
other.''
   Russell emerges as a negative character in ``Tequila Sunrise''
because he manipulates both Gibson and Pfeiffer for his own ends.
However, the actor enjoyed his role.
   ``I like the style of some of those old gangster movies that
(James) Cagney did. You didn't pull for him, but you did feel bad
when he got killed off. Cagney played the worst guy in the room; I
was drawn to that character,'' he said.
   Russell, a child star in Disney movies (``Follow Me, Boys,''
``The Computer Wore Tennis Shoes,'' ``The Fox and the Hound''), has
a long history of playing bad guys.
   ``A lot of people take Walt Disney and lump it all together. The
first picture I did, I was the tough kid on the block. My father was
an alcoholic and I was sling-shotting everybody,'' he said.
   Russell's career sagged through most of the 1970s until he landed
the starring role in the television movie ``Elvis.'' It was, Russell
admitted, a nearly impossible task.
   ``Elvis Presley is the second most recognizable unit to
Coca-Cola. The only thing tougher to do is play the Coca-Cola
logo,'' he said.
   But Russell managed to receive surprisingly positive reviews and
has gone on to be one of the most popular actors of the '80s,
appearing in ``Silkwood,'' and ``Used Cars'' among other films.
   With that popularity has come success. How does he handle it?
   ``Failure is quite easy to deal with because it's right there and
it's much less complex than success,'' the actor said. ``Success can
become very complex, dealing with your ego and dealing with greed.
You begin to make amounts of money you don't want to stop making.''
   Money has freed him, though, to enjoy more private time. In 1983,
he fell in love with actress Goldie Hawn while they were making
``Swing Shift.'' They have houses in California and Colorado. Hawn
was an old friend of ``Tequila Sunrise'' writer-director Robert
Towne.
   ``I find Robert Towne's style inexplicibly hypnotic,'' Russell
said of the screenwriter of ``The Last Detail'' and ``Chinatown.''
   ``He makes you keep turning the pages. You're not exactly sure
why. I feel that way about Bob Towne as a human being as well.''
   Russell, the son of TV actor Bing Russell, grew up in Southern
California. In 1963, at the age of 12, he made his film debut in the
Elvis Presley movie ``It Happened at the World's Fair.''
   But he loved sports more than acting, and spent some time playing
minor league baseball for the San Diego Padres and California
Angels. A shoulder injury suffered at age 22 ended his baseball
career. Sports continues to pop up in Russell's conversation,
especially when he makes comparisons to acting.
   ``Acting's the easiest job in the world,'' he said. ``I am
accused of not liking actors. I do like them, but they think
somebody interfering with their ever important performance is an
obstacle.
   ``They haven't faced Nolan Ryan with the winning run on third
base, that's an obstacle. Or face Mike Ditka with four yards to go,
there's an obstacle that's tough to get around.
   ``I watched a guy drilling in the street and he comes to this
point where he gets into this stuff that's heavy concrete. This guy
had an obstacle!''
   Russell brings an athlete's sense of concentration to his work.
   ``You must get zeroed in; nothing else exists when you're doing
it,'' Russell explained. ``I would like to think if I'm on this
jackhammer or getting across the goal line, it would be the same
way.''

<HEAD>The Artists: Soprano Returns to Early Role for Met Stopover</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE SILVERMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It was eight days before Christmas, and a
homesick Mirella Freni was grateful to Bizet for writing the
character of Micaela out of Act 4 of ``Carmen.''
   The soprano had an Alitalia flight to catch to Italy, where her
mother, daughter, two grandchildren and other relatives awaited a
holiday reunion in her hometown of Modena.
   ``Since I can leave early, I'll be on the plane Saturday night,''
Miss Freni said in an interview the day before the matinee
performance. ``I hated to wait an extra day.''
   It was an unexpected coup for the Metropolitan Opera to persuade
Miss Freni, at age 53 still one of the world's most sought-after
sopranos, to stop in New York for two performances as Micaela. She
was on her way home from San Francisco, where she had appeared with
Luciano Pavarotti in Puccini's ``La Boheme.''
   Micaela _ the girl-next-door who loses the affections of the
soldier Don Jose to the gypsy Carmen _ is usually sung by sopranos
early in their career. Miss Freni made her stage debut in the part
in 1955 but had not sung it anywhere in 15 years.
   ``Mostly they want me for more demanding roles now,'' she said.
``But the Met said, `Oh please, Mirella, just two performances on
your way home, and one is the radio broadcast. I am happy I can
still sing the role.''
   Snaring the superstar, even for two performances, was part of the
Met's renewed emphasis on glamorous casts. Appearing with her was
mezzo Marilyn Horne as Carmen and bass Samuel Ramey as the toreador
Escamillo.
   Though the role of Micaela is relatively short _ an extended duet
in Act 1 and a showpiece aria in Act 3 _ it is not without its
challenges.
   ``Toscanini made the aria a required part of auditions for lyric
sopranos at La Scala,'' Miss Freni said. ``It calls for a little of
everything _ recitative, pianissimo, long phrases, high notes.''
   That she can still meet all those challenges is remarkable,
considering that Miss Freni long ago ventured beyond the lyric
repertory into heavier, dramatic roles such as Desdemona in Verdi's
``Otello,'' the title role in his ``Aida'' and Puccini's ``Manon
Lescaut.''
   Some critics have regretted her decision, noting that the more
heroic roles inevitably stretch and harden a soprano's voice. But
Miss Freni has had more success than most in retaining the mellow
tones required of a lyric soprano.
   ``I don't try to be more dramatic than I am,'' Miss Freni said.
``I still think of myself as basically a lyric soprano, but with
other possibilities. I know very well my limitations.''
   For instance, she said, Aida is comfortable for her because much
of the part lies in the upper register, where she is strong. But
Amelia in Verdi's ``Un Ballo in Maschera'' and Leonora in his ``La
Forza del Destino'' proved unworkable, because those roles require a
lot of heavy singing for the middle voice.
   The soprano will be back at the Met in February to begin
rehearsals for one of the newest roles in her repertory, Tatyana in
Tchaikovsky's ``Eugene Onegin.''
   ``I always loved the music, but I was afraid because it's in
Russian,'' she said.
   About six years ago, maestro Bruno Bartoletti asked her to sing
it at Chicago's Lyric Opera, and she agreed, studying intensively
with a Russian language coach _ and getting support from her
husband, bass Nicolai Ghiaurov, who was born in Bulgaria and speaks
fluent Russian.
   ``Nicolai helped me whenever I would panic,'' she said. ``I'd
say: `Nicolai, Nicolai, how do you say this?' and he would show me
and get me to calm down.''
   She has since triumphed in the opera repeatedly, at Vienna, La
Scala, London's Covent Garden. Now the Bolshoi Opera has invited her
to sing the role, a rare honor for a foreigner.
   ``I'm a little nervous, but we're trying to work out a time when
I can do it,'' she said.
   She is also studying another Tchaikovsky role, Lisa in ``Pique
Dame,'' for La Scala in 1990.
   Miss Freni freely admits that her transition to the more dramatic
repertory has not been completely smooth sailing.
   `Naturally, I've made mistakes. I'm human,'' she said. ``I did
(Verdi's) `Traviata' too early. (Verdi's) `Ernani' wasn't too bad,
but it's not my kind of opera. The role was too `tat-tat-tat' and my
specialty is long phrases. So I said good-bye to that.''
   One mistake she was asked to make but didn't was to record the
title role of Puccini's ``Turandot,'' a part that has been
identified with such stentorian sopranos as Birgit Nilsson and Ghena
Dimitrova. Miss Freni has long been identified with the lyric
soprano role in that opera, the slave girl Liu.
   ``Can you believe it! Turandot!'' laughed Miss Freni. ``I am not
arteriosclerotic! I am a grandmother, but not in that way.''
   In fact, it's hard to believe that the glamorous Miss Freni, with
her golden blond hair and radiant smile, is a grandmother in any
way. She looks remarkably unchanged from the young singer who first
thrilled audiences around the world in the early 1960s with her warm
and generous singing.
   Growing up in Italy during and after World War II, Miss Freni
never wavered in her choice of careers.
   ``I remember when I was 5 and someone asked me what I wanted to
be, I said, `an opera singer,''' she recalled. ``I was really
crazy.''
   When she was breaking into the profession, the two reigning and
rival sopranos were Maria Callas and Renata Tebaldi _ the former an
intensely dramatic singer, the latter noted for her golden thread of
sound.
   ``I admired both of them, but I tried not to model myself on
either,'' she said. ``I told myself, `Mirella, don't be a bad copy
of someone else. Better to be a small Freni.'''

<HEAD>Music Makers: Breathe Is Breathing a Little Easier</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HILLEL ITALIE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   David Glasper is proud to be part of a ``pop''
band.
   ``As soon as you say that word, people sneer at it,'' said
Glasper, lead singer of the English group Breathe.
   ``The Beatles played it, the Stones played it. We just want to be
generally accepted. If we've written a handful of classic records,
we would have achieved what we wanted to do.''
   But acceptance for pop stars means hit singles, and Breathe had
to endure an unimaginably difficult road in working to get its songs
played on the radio. Their debut album, ``All That Jazz,'' was
released in August 1987, and proceeded to go nowhere. Worse, the
group feuded with its manager and the two sides parted ways.
   ``He was frustrated,'' Glasper said. ``We had released seven
singles in the United Kingdom to no avail. We were wondering what we
could do. You're bound to start questioning things.''
   And questioning each other.
   ``Because we took so long to happen, the relationship became
really strained. We were all just screaming at each other,'' he said.
   The story of Breathe, however, was to take an unexpected turn for
the better in 1988. ``Hands to Heaven,'' the album's second single,
began getting heavy airplay on American adult contemporary stations
and eventually became a Top 20 hit on the pop charts.
   ``It's a song we really believed in,'' Glasper said. ``It's about
separation. A man married for 50 years called a radio station in
Chicago and said the song was for him. He had been to the Navy and
had been away from his wife a lot.''
   Glasper, now in his mid-20s, grew up in the suburbs of London and
showed an early interest in music. ``I've always been singing. I
used to walk around the house humming. I was involved in choir at
school. I was brought up on the Doobie Brothers, Led Zeppelin, Pink
Floyd, music like that.''
   He and his childhood friend, guitarist Marcus Lillington, formed
Breathe with drummer Ian Spice and bassist MIck Delahunty in the
early 1980s.
   ``We used to massacre classic records like `Stairway to Heaven'
and `It's Different for Girls,''' Glasper recalled. ``Then we
started experimenting. It's like a craft.''
   They also had to experiment with giving the group a name. They
started with Catch-22 and ran through several others before settling
on Breathe.
   ``The name was never a concious decision,'' Glasper said. ``We
were looking to change our name when we decided to use Breathe for a
local gig because we had a song of that name on the posters.''
   Breathe began recording its first record back in 1985, a little
too soon in Glasper's opinion.
   ``Our band hadn't really jelled into any one thing. We spent a
lot of time in the studio writing and experimenting. Towards the
later stage of the album, we kind of found out what kind of band
we'd like to be,'' he said.
   What hurt the group, Glasper said, was management's emphasis on a
major selling point for most pop bands: appearance.
   ``We were four young guys. It doesn't take much business acumen
to see we could have appeal to teen-age girls. But we realized that
we wanted to be involved in songwriting and prove ourselves that
way. Our first manager used to scream at us about image.''
   Ironically, Breathe ended up making its breakthrough in the
United States with an older audience.
   ```Hands to Heaven' is quite a mature sounding record. People
thought we were a lot older than we actually were,'' Glasper said.
   But he found that being called an ``adult contemporary'' band has
its drawbacks, too, and promised that the group would do something
about it.
   ``We've got really stuck into an image like Chicago or Air
Supply, but we have some uptempo songs written for the next album.
There's going to be a big ballad, but we've got a lot of faster
songs,'' he said.
   ``I know that the songs we've written at the moment are not our
best. It's exciting because we don't know what we'll end up sounding
like.''
   One of the new songs is called ``Satisfy'' and Glasper has good
reason to feel pleased. ``How Can I Fall,'' the second single from
``All That Jazz,'' is selling well and the album itself has cracked
the Top 40.
   ``When we first finished recording `All That Jazz,' we started
thinking, `Can we write songs?' And then there came a point where
nothing had happened and we asked what were we doing wrong. We were
getting paranoid,'' he said.
   ``It was such a relief that the record was a hit and we could
say, `Yeah I told you so.'''

<HEAD>Books and Authors: A Book for Reading Aloud Around the Fire</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GENEVA COLLINS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Alex Haley, whose monumental and deeply moving
``Roots'' _ a chronicle of his descent from slave ancestry that
inspired Americans of all races to explore and take pride in their
past _ has written a new book that is as small in scope as ``Roots''
was large.
   ``A Different Kind of Christmas'' (Doubleday and Co., $15) is a
slim volume that tells the tale of Fletcher Randall, the son of a
wealthy Southern plantation owner who undergoes a moral conversion
and joins the Underground Railroad to help free a group of slaves.
   Haley, in New York recently to promote the book, said that
although the tale was fictional, the workings of the Underground
Railroad as portrayed in the novella are accurate.
   ``If you've researched slavery a lot, as I have for `Roots,' you
automatically know a lot about the phase of it called the
Underground Railroad,'' a network of Quakers, abolitionists, former
slaves and others who set up an escape route for slaves to find
their way north to freedom, he said.
   ``The Underground Railroad could not have worked but for whites
who were anti-slavery and for blacks who were willing to lay their
lives on the line to help others escape.''
   ``A Different Kind of Christmas'' is surprisingly Haley's first
book since the Pulitzer Prize-winning ``Roots,'' published in 1976.
It is written in a simple style that lends itself to being read
aloud to the family over the course of two or three evenings before
Christmas.
   Haley was asked if he had such an oral tradition in mind when he
wrote it.
   ``I always write like that, or like to think I do,'' said the
author, who was born in Ithaca, N.Y., but raised in a small town in
western Tennessee, and credits the South's great story-telling
tradition as his chief writing influence.
   ``I grew up with my grandmother and her sisters sitting on the
front porch in Henning, Tennessee _ population 475 _ after supper,
early dark, sitting in rocking chairs, dipping snuff, skeeting snuff
at lightning bugs over the honeysuckle vines, and telling stories,
night after night after night. So I enjoy writing stories as if I
were telling them,'' he said in an accent as sweetly Southern as the
honeysuckle he recalled.
   It was his grandmother's and great-aunts' storytelling that led
Haley to devote 12 years meticulously tracing his mother's side of
the family back six generations to a small village in Gambia, West
Africa. The product of his obsessive labor evolved into ``Roots: The
Saga of an American Family,'' a mix of painstakingly authenticated
fact and imagined fictional detail. It was an instant best seller,
and the 12-hour miniseries adapted from the book drew 130 million
viewers, then the largest audience in television history.
   Set in 1855, ``A Different Kind of Christmas'' focuses on how
Fletcher, sent up North to be educated at Princeton University,
slowly converts from pro- to anti-slavery after he is befriended by
some Philadelphia Quakers.
   Why did Haley choose to make the hero of his tale a wealthy
Southern white instead of, say, a slave or freed black man?
   ``If you're going to tell the story of the Underground Railroad,
you can tell it from any number of points of view. ... I wanted to
show Fletcher's mind change,'' he said. ``A black perspective would
be one thing from the very beginning, and that would be to get free.
A white mind would go from being in a white world and a white
perspective to turning 180 degrees to get to where Fletcher got.''
   ``A Different Kind of Christmas'' was first conceived as a
novelization of the Christmas television special that was broadcast
Dec. 11: ``Roots: The Gift,'' featuring Kunta Kinte, Fiddler and
other characters from the book and miniseries. However, the
screenwriters' strike earlier this year prevented Haley from
collaborating with the TV script writer on the project, so he
created a new cast of characters for a tale set several decades
after the TV special.
   Haley, 67, started his writing career while in the U.S. Coast
Guard. He contributed to Readers Digest, Playboy and other magazines
before publishing his first book, ``The Autobiography of Malcolm
X,'' which sprang out of a series of Playboy interviews Haley
conducted with the civil rights leader.
   ``Roots'' catapulted him to fame at age 55, and the author
acknowledged that celebrity has its price. Four plagiarism suits
were filed against him (one was settled out of court and three
others dismissed), and he is so in demand for speaking engagements
that it's difficult for him to find time to write.
   ``Still,'' he asserted, ``when I talk about the negatives, I'm
talking about at best 10 percent. Ninety percent of it's got to be
beautiful. To this day people come up to me on the street, every
race imaginable, and say `Thank you.' That's holy. You can't top
that.''
   To escape the steady stream of phone calls and speech requests,
Haley tries to book passage on a cargo ship roughly four times a
year, spending a month or more writing 12 to 14 hours a day.
   He has spent the last several voyages working on a host of
projects. Haley hopes ``Henning,'' a book of memoirs of his youth in
Tennessee, will be out next year, followed by ``Madame C.J.,'' an
account of C.J. Walker, who became the first woman in America to
earn $1 million. She was a black woman who sold hair preparations
for black women.
   One might assume that the author of a Christmas tale would have
plans for a a traditional holiday to be spent with family and
friends. But Haley expected Christmas Eve to find him scribbling
away aboard a cargo ship.
   ``When I publish a book, that's Christmas,'' he said.

<HEAD>Nashville Sound: Part Comic, Part Evangelist</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOE EDWARDS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mike Warnke is one of a kind _ he's part
evangelist and part stand-up comic. Or, as some folks say, he's ``a
standup Jimmy Swaggart with long hair.''
   The 43-year-old Christian humorist and recording artist, who has
shoulder-length locks, is also a former heroin addict and satanist
high priest who once had more than 1,500 worshippers.
   Noting his background, he says: ``If God can use me, he can use
anybody.''
   He shares his religious faith at up to 22 personal appearances a
month. He's just released his 12th humor album, ``One in a
Million,'' on DaySpring Records of Nashville.
   He employs 30 people at his ministry office in Burgin, Ky., where
he has noted a marked rise in telephone calls from people, including
the police, asking about the occult.
   ``There's been a dramatic increase in the past three years,'' he
said in a telephone interview. ``We're seeing younger kids getting
involved. It used to be people age 20, but now it's 13 and 14. I'd
say 70 percent of the calls deal with the occult. This is a
frightening trend.''
   Warnke, who wrote the 1972 book ``The Satan Seller,'' which has
sold more than 3 million copies, believes there's a definite link
between the occult and heavy metal music.
   ``We've never investigated a case with the police where heavy
metal was not a factor. The music drives the lyrics into the
conscious and subconscious. Then there's the clothing, the attitudes
of the musicians, the things they say and the lifestyles they
purport, and the symbols.''
   The symbols include demonic-looking caricatures, horns worn on
heads and upside down crosses.
   He compares music to lumber in that either can be used for good
purposes or otherwise. ``If you put a 2-by-4 in the hands of the Ku
Klux Klan, it's bad. But in the hands of a carpenter, it's not.''
   Warnke, who has been featured on the TV show ``20-20,'' says he
began his involvement with the occult at age 12 or 13. He joined a
coven in the early 1960s when he was in college and became a
satanist high priest.
   ``I was the star sinner on campus,'' he recalled.
   He used heroin heavily. And some of his satanic followers tried
to murder him by injecting him with an overdose of heroin and
leaving him on the streets of San Bernadino, Calif., to die.
   Passers-by saw him and took him to a hospital, where his recovery
began.
   ``If I'd have had to kick it (addiction) in the streets, I'd have
been dead for sure,'' Warnke said.
   He later joined the Navy and served one tour of duty in Vietnam.
He became a Christian and devoted himself to preaching against
satanism.
   After his records started coming out, Record World magazine
honored him as the contemporary and inspirational non-musical artist
of the year, 1976-79.
   He estimates he speaks to more than 1 million people a year. He
has performed for the queen of Denmark and the king of Sweden and
been to Australia, New Zealand, South Africa and Canada.
   He's drafting a sequel to ``The Satan Seller'' that is due out
soon.
   ``I've never been a perfect Christian,'' Warnke said. ``That's
where I deviate from others who seem to have a mandate to tell
everyone else how to live. Jesus has been a perfect Jesus, and I
just try to spend time talking about him and not me.
   ``What I'm trying to put across to Christians is that you don't
have to be stereotypical. The Lord will use you no matter who you
are. For people who don't know Jesus, we hope they see him and get
saved.''
   Warnke, a native of Evansville, Ind., said threats against his
life picked up after he began working with police on cases involving
satanism.
   ``The threats used to be just rhetoric. But people have jumped on
stage with knives and I've been shot at backstage. I just keep
ducking,'' he said.

<HEAD>Fitted with Mini-Telescopes, Legally Blind Take To the Roads</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KEN KUSMER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>INDIANAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   ``I'm going to get a motor car. I'm going to
learn how to drive,'' says Bruce Quinn, 32 years old and legally
blind.
   Quinn, who expects by summer to run two radio stations 50 miles
apart in northern Indiana, may be licensed to drive for the first
time, using glasses equipped with small telescopes to spot details
like signs and lights.
   ``I'm excited about it. I got a moped a few years ago, and I've
had a lot of fun with it and never any trouble, so I should be all
right,'' said Quinn, of Delphi. ``It offers me a lot of
opportunities. Something called freedom. Goodbye to Greyhound. A lot
of handicapped people are stuck on Greyhound.''
   California and Texas have been licensing bioptic drivers for more
than 10 years and about 25 states have such programs for as many as
2,000 nationwide, said Warren Brown, Indiana Bureau of Motor
Vehicles director of licensing.
   Brown developed Indiana's bioptic registration program at the
urging of a vocational rehabilitation counselor and with help from
low-vision optometrists.
   ``I thought it was the greatest idea in the world when I heard
it. It's nice to do a little good for someone,'' he said. ``You
wouldn't believe how sad it is to tell a man he cannot drive again.
I've had men cry. Driving is probably the single most important
thing in any man's life.''
   Optometrist Paul Bither, who helped write Indiana's licensing
guidelines, says not everyone is suited for the program. Getting a
license is ``a major step toward independence,'' but ``it's not
something that I push,'' he said. ``Driving is a great privilege,
but it's also a great responsibility.''
   In Indiana, bioptic drivers must have vision correctable to
20-200 in glasses, 20-40 through the telescopes with up to 4X
magnification, a horizontal visual field of 130 degrees and no major
blind spots, color defects or other visual problems. They must be
evaluated and fit for the telescope, get a six-month learner's
permit and training _ available only in South Bend, Indianapolis and
Evansville _ and pass a road test.
   The telescopes cost $500 to more than $2,000. They vary in size
and weight, but the most common are about an inch in diameter and
about 6 ounces. They may extend a few inches at a slight angle
upward from the top of the glasses over the user's strongest eye, or
in some cases both. When the user needs to see some detail, he tilts
his head forward to look through the scope.
   ``Most bioptic drivers, especially the older ones, tend to drive
only in familiar areas,'' said optometrist Dr. Debra McConnaha of
Indiana University. ``It's possible they might be able to drive to
the grocery and back without using the telescope. It's there if they
need it.''
   Supporters of the program say bioptic drivers must be able to
glance through the telescopes and spot something in less than a
second, about the time drivers with normal vision might spend
looking in a rear-view mirror.
   Opponents say that's impossible.
   Dr. Gerald Fonda, a Livingston, N.J., ophthalmologist who's been
prescribing bioptic glasses since 1947, said bioptic drivers need at
least three seconds to adjust to looking through the telescope, spot
the detail, and then readjust to looking through normal glasses. He
said the telescope creates a blind spot that is twice as wide as the
field of vision through the scope.
   ``The purpose of the telescope is to pass the driver's test.
There's no evidence this device is safe, and there is overwhelming
evidence it is a hazard,'' Fonda said.
   Dr. Arthur H. Keeney, professor of ophthalmology at the
University of Louisville Medical School, says the telescopes create
an illusion of nearness to objects and that an ``awning effect''
obscures overhead signs. He and Fonda support letting low-vision
sufferers drive under restricted privileges, such as under 35 mph
only and not on freeways.
   ``There are lots of ways to help people without encumbering with
an optical device that imposes limitations,'' Keeney said.
   A 1983 study of bioptic drivers in California showed they were
nearly twice as likely as the general driving population to have an
accident, said Bill Gengler, spokesman for that state's Department
of Motor Vehicles.
   ``The accident rate was higher, but not significantly. In fact,
it was lower than rates for a variety of other types of California
licensed drivers with different medical conditions,'' Gengler said.
   Despite the accident rate, advocates claim bioptic drivers are
among the most careful on the road. Bioptics say they know their
limitations and won't exceed them or else risk losing part of their
independence.
   ``We stress the safe-driving aspect as part of the privileges we
get as drivers,'' said Marc Sessions, president of the 1,000-member
American Bioptic Certified Drivers based in Laguna Niguel, Calif. He
said the group's initials, ABCD, also stand for ``Always Be Careful
Driving.''
   Teresa Canada, 34, of Jasonville, started driving at 16 but lost
her license eight years ago because of her vision. ``I have to be
more careful than others. If I feel I am not capable, I am not going
to be on the roads,'' said Canada, driving through downtown
Indianapolis after her road test in October.
   Until she got a bioptic license, Canada had to call her husband
at work if an emergency came up at home with any of their four
children. ``It's been eight years since I've been able to drive, so
I've been in a kind of a prison.''

   American chestnuts could once again line
Eastern avenues if an experimental vaccination technique proves
successful against the fungus that devastated the stately trees
three decades ago.
   Two stands of trees treated 10 years ago by the Connecticut
Agricultural Experiment Station are not only thriving and producing
tasty nuts, but their fungus resistance appears to be spreading to
other chestnuts.
   The treatment involves injecting the trees with a mixture,
imported from Europe, of a virus-like substance and the killing
fungus. The substance doesn't kill the fungus, but makes it less
effective _ sort of a vaccination.
   ``I think we have a real phenomena. I think we have the spread of
a biological control,'' said Sandra L. Anagnostakis, who has studied
the American chestnut for more than 20 years. ``But how far will it
go?''
   Anagnostakis speculates that insects, animals or people are
spreading the weakened fungus to other trees, allowing them to
survive, too.
   A control for the fungus could add a new chapter to the story of
one of the great environmental disasters of modern time.
   American chestnuts once grew from Georgia to Maine. Their
dominance in the woods made them prized for food and wood. And
because all but the oldest trees put out new sprouts when cut,
replanting wasn't required after harvesting.
   But in 1904, the chestnuts that lined the avenues in New York
City's Bronx Zoo began to wilt and die from a fungus that couldn't
be stopped.
   ``The infection was insidious and the fungus was able to spread
out very rapidly from its apparent start in the New York area,''
Anagnostakis said.
   By the 1950s, all mature chestnuts in the native range were wiped
out, an estimated 3.5 billion trees.
   Anagnostakis suspects that the fungus, Cryphonectria parasitica,
was brought into this country with Asian chestnut trees from Japan
or China at the turn of the century. But it causes few problems for
Asian chestnuts, possibly because the fungus and Asian chestnuts
evolved together.
   ``The American chestnut is a different species,'' she said. ``It
had never been exposed and was almost completely susceptible. It's
partly because of that that we now have plant quarantine laws.''
   Scientists have been able to study American chestnuts because the
trees produce sprouts from stumps or old root systems. The fungus
doesn't penetrate below ground and into the roots, so the trees can
grow as large as six inches in diameter before the fungus infects
and kills them.
   The fungus usually enters a tree through a broken branch or a
break in the bark. It then grows through the cambium, the growing
tissue that produces bark and wood, and eventually pushes through
the bark to appear as orange blotches.
   The blotches produce spores that help spread the fungus.
   European chestnuts are similar to American and also are
susceptible to the fungus, which was first reported overseas in
Italy in 1938. It began to spread rapidly, but within 15 years a
variation was discovered in Italy that was less virulent and
appeared to stop the killing blight when the two came together.
   French scientists Jean Grente and Suzanne Sauret began studying
the less deadly strains, known as ``hypovirulents.''
   In 1972, Anagnostakis got a sample. Scientists here found that
the hypovirulents interfered with the blight and produced white,
rather than orange blotches. She said they haven't identified the
hypovirulence, but that it acts like a virus and contains
double-stranded ribonucleic acid.
   There are varieties of the hypovirulents, and aside from the
European type, others have been found in Michigan, Virginia and
Tennessee, she said. ``There's really nothing that describes what it
really fits into.''
   In 1978, researchers introduced the Italian strain in test sites
in Goodwin State Forest in Hampton and on private land in Pomfret,
and Anagnostakis has tested different mixtures of it at other sites
across the state.
   In all cases, the trees seem to be surviving and the
hypovirulents are spreading. The treated trees don't grow straight
and tall like their ancestors, and probably never will because the
hypovirulents create cankers, big knots of bark, that grow on the
trees, she said. The cankers don't kill the trees.
   Anagnostakis' research is unfinished, but she is ``guardedly
optimistic about the biological control in our woodlands.''

<HEAD>Spy Plane to Probe Ozone Loss over Arctic</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LARRY GERBER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>STAVANGER, Norway (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   American and European scientists using a
modern version of the U-2 spy plane are setting out to explore
troubling signs of ozone loss high over the Arctic.
   The project, organized by the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration, runs from Jan. 1 to mid-February, the period when a
hole apparently opens up in the protective ozone layer at the top of
the world.
   Most of the scientists are veterans of a 1987 expedition that
documented an ozone hole over Antarctica during the southern winter.
   ``The ozone hole over Antarctica is something you can't miss,''
said Dr. Adrian Tuck, a chemist and meteorologist. ``We did come up
with an unequivocal answer that the ozone hole was indeed caused by
man-made chemicals, and a natural question to ask is: `Is it
possible in the Arctic?'''
   Scientists fear that the loss of ozone, a gas which filters the
Sun's harmful ultraviolet rays, is leading to increased skin cancer
and eye damage, and could upset the food chain by harming many
species of plants and animals.
   Dr. Darrell S. Rigel, a U.S. dermatologist, recently reported a
1,500 percent increase in melanoma, a form of skin cancer, in the
United States since 1935, with more people contracting the disease
at a younger age.
   Tuck and other scientists gathering at Sola, a Norwegian air
force base here, said the Arctic hole appeared to be smaller than
the southern one, but could be more serious because it is closer to
where people live.
   ``If the changes occur, they could probably have an effect over a
much larger area, due to the difference in meteorology,'' said Ivar
Isaksen, a professor at the University of Oslo. ``There's a much
larger exchange of air.
   ``The idea here is to look at what happens not only in the
vortex, but what consequences it could have for the ozone at lower
latitudes.''
   The vortex is a circulation of strong westerly winds in the polar
region.
   The scientists will analyze clouds about 12 miles up that ``in a
manner that was completely unpredicted ..., can intervene in the
chemistry, change the chemical balance, and make it easier for the
chlorine from refrigerants and aerosol can sprays and so on to
destroy the ozone,'' said Tuck.
   Four pilots will take turns flying through the clouds in a
single-engine ER-2, an updated model U-2, loaded with scientific
instruments. A modified DC-8 airliner will look at the clouds from
below with lasers and other instruments.
   The missions will mostly be north and west of Norway, but will
avoid Soviet air space, said pilot Jim Barrileaux of Dublin, Calif.
He said the Soviets might be sending up research flights of their
own over northern Siberia.
   The Norwegian air force cleared out a sprawling hangar at its
seaside base to make room for the ER-2. An advance team nailed
together sheetrock partitions as temporary offices, and computer
experts patched together a network for data analysis and weather
reports beamed down by satellite.
   It could take as long as a year to analyze the data and publish a
full report, said Estelle Condon, the project manager.
   Worry about ozone depletion led last year to industrial nations'
signing a treaty to reduce the use of the chloroflourocarbon
chemicals that are primary suspects in ozone destruction. Further
steps are under consideration.
   ``We have information from the southern hemisphere, and so we
would like information from the northern hemisphere, so when the
negotiations take place they have the best information possible to
make the decisions,'' said Condon.
   The project's $10 million budget is ``not very big by NASA
standards,'' she said. Up to 150 scientists will take part, most of
them from the United States. Britain, Norway and West Germany also
are represented.
   The mission's success will depend largely on the weather, said
Tuck. The clouds could drift over the Soviet Union, or they may not
form at all, though 1985 was the only year in the past decade when
that happened. ``So if this is a horse race,'' he said, ``you're
backing odds of 10 to 1.''

   ``I'm going to get a motor car. I'm going to
learn how to drive,'' says Bruce Quinn, 32 years old and legally
blind.
   Quinn, who expects by summer to run two radio stations 50 miles
apart in northern Indiana, may be licensed to drive for the first
time, using glasses equipped with small telescopes to spot details
like signs and lights.
   ``I'm excited about it. I got a moped a few years ago, and I've
had a lot of fun with it and never any trouble, so I should be all
right,'' said Quinn, of Delphi. ``It offers me a lot of
opportunities. Something called freedom.''
   California and Texas have been licensing bioptic drivers for more
than 10 years and about 25 states have such programs for as many as
2,000 nationwide, said Warren Brown, Indiana Bureau of Motor
Vehicles director of licensing.
   Optometrist Paul Bither, who helped write Indiana's licensing
guidelines, says not everyone is suited for the program. Getting a
license is ``a major step toward independence,'' but ``it's not
something that I push,'' he said.
   In Indiana, bioptic drivers must have vision correctable to
20-200 in glasses, 20-40 through the telescopes with up to 4X
magnification, a horizontal visual field of 130 degrees and no major
blind spots, color defects or other visual problems. They must be
evaluated and fit for the telescope, get a six-month learner's
permit and training _ available only in South Bend, Indianapolis and
Evansville _ and pass a road test.
   The telescopes cost $500 to more than $2,000. They vary in size
and weight, but the most common are about an inch in diameter and
about 6 ounces. They may extend a few inches at a slight angle
upward from the top of the glasses over the user's strongest eye, or
in some cases both. When the user needs to see some detail, he tilts
his head forward to look through the scope.

<HEAD>Beepers Becoming A Problem In Many Major Hospitals</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The persistent beeping of pocket pagers has become
too common in many big hospitals, taking doctors away from their
patients to deal with questions that are not really urgent, a new
study concludes.
   Beepers have largely replaced overhead paging systems. Among the
most frequent targets of the beepers are interns, the young doctors
who provide much of the care in large hospitals.
   In a study at three hospitals affiliated with the University of
California, San Francisco, Drs. Mitchell H. Katz and Steven A.
Schroeder persuaded 26 interns to keep logs of their beeper calls.
   The interns were paged an average of once an hour. However, on 24
occasions, interns were paged five or more times an hour. One
unfortunate intern got eight calls in a single hour. The figures
probably underestimate the frequency of pages: some interns said
they had to stop keeping logs because they were too busy answering
pages.
   Only about one-third of the pages were for truly urgent matters
requiring immediate changes in patient care. Most concerned matters
that could have been put off until later. Some were entirely
unnecessary.
   For instance, one intern was beeped awake to evaluate a patient
whose mental status had changed.
   ``On arrival,'' the doctors wrote, ``the intern learned that the
patient appeared drowsy because he had been asleep, like the intern,
when the nurse evaluated him.''
   The doctors said recently in the New England Journal of Medicine
that a few changes, such as relying more on written notes and
grouping several non-urgent pages together, could reduce the paging
interruptions up to 42 percent.

<HEAD>Yale Awarded $6.6 Million Grant For Schizophrenia Center</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW HAVEN, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The National Institute of Mental Health
has given Yale School of Medicine researchers $6.6 million to study
schizophrenia, which affects an estimated one person in 10 at some
point in life.
   Schizophrenia usually begins with an apparent personality change
that may include social withdrawal, difficulty in communicating and
lethargy. Later, in its more active phase, it can make victims see
hallucinations and hear voices.
   They may feel controlled by invisible agents or believe their
thoughts are being broadcast to others. They may adopt new
identities.
   The research will be guided by the concept that the mental
disorder rises from physical rather than purely psychological
problems, said Patricia S. Goldman-Rakic, a neuroscience professor
who will direct the study.
   ``The Center for Neuroscience Research underscores the modern
conception of the disease as having an organic basis that affects
the highest center of the brain, the cerebral cortex, where the
functions of perception, memory and thinking are carried out,''
Goldman-Rakic said.

<HEAD>EPA Picks Pitt For Pollution-Control Development Center</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has
picked the University of Pittsburgh to open the nation's first
center to speed commercial development of pollution control
technology.
   U.S. industry and government spent nearly $80 billion in 1987 for
pollution controls, and the cost of cleaning hazardous waste sites
is estimated at more than $200 billion over the next 20 years, Pitt
said in a statement.
   The National Environmental Technology Applications Corporation
``will be a positive force for changing the way government and
industry work together in the environmental area,'' said EPA
Administrator Lee Thomas.
   Pitt President Wesley W. Posvar said, ``It is clear that to bring
environmental technology out of the laboratory and into the
marketplace with the approval of government, a strong public-private
sector partnership is required. NETAC will help forge that
partnership.''
   EPA and Pitt will each pay half of the center's operating
expenses of $9 million over its first three years. NETAC is expected
to be in operation within two years at the university's Applied
Research Center in Harmarville.
   The Federal Technology Transfer Act of 1986 encourages the
government and companies to cooperate in moving new technologies to
market.
   Pitt two years ago formed the Center for Hazardous Materials
Research, a non-profit organization that does $2.5 million a year in
business.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A researcher has developed a flexible wire that
carries electrical current without resistance, a step toward
practical use of recently developed high-temperature superconducting
materials.
   Scientists had previously produced only rigid superconducting
wire.
   Flexible wire may be useful in coils to store electricity,
magnets and magnetic resonance imaging systems, which create images
of the body's interior without X-rays, said Shyam Samanta of the
University of Michigan.
   Superconductivity is the ability to carry current without
resistance. Scientists hope superconductors will lead to such
products as more powerful computers and floating, high-speed trains.
   As in other superconductor developments, the term ``high'' is
relative. The new wire must be chilled to work. Tests on a
half-inch-long piece found it lost electrical resistance at 321
degrees below zero Fahrenheit, Samanta said.
   The wire, one-eighth-inch in diameter, is based on a standard
superconducting compound of yttrium, barium, copper and oxygen. The
compound is normally brittle, but a flexible wire was produced by
adding silver and silver oxide, Samanta said.
   Researchers do not yet know how much electrical current the wire
can carry, he said in a recent telephone interview.
   Until that is known the usefulness of the wire cannot be
assessed, said Roger Poeppel of the Argonne National Laboratory in
Argonne, Ill., where rigid wire has been developed. Other
researchers have produced wire-like silver tubes with a core of
superconducting powder, Poeppel said, but he did not know how
flexible the tubes were.

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. dollar finished lower against the Japanese
yen, while share prices rose on the Tokyo Stock Exchange in slow
trading Monday as overseas markets were closed for Christmas
holidays.
   The dollar closed at 124.72 yen, down 0.23 yen from Friday's
close of 124.95 yen. After opening higher at 124.85 yen, the
currency edged down, ranging between 124.63 yen and 124.90 yen.
   Dealers said market players were reluctant to make major moves
without knowing trends on overseas markets, closed until Tuesday for
the Christmas holiday.
   ``There was hardly any activity in the market,'' said a dealer
with Mitsubishi Bank in Tokyo.
   On the stock exchange, the 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average rose
181.65 points, or 0.61 percent, following Saturday's 0.10-point
gain, and closed at 29,868.65. The index gained 86.02 points in
early morning trading and continued to rise.
   Dealers said stability in the currency market contributed to the
Nikkei's rise.
   After a full-day session Tuesday and a half-day session
Wednesday, the stock market is to close until Jan. 4 for the New
Year holidays.
   A dealer at Daiwa Securities said many investors were trying to
avoid holding many issues ahead of the six-day holidays, mainly
because of uncertainty over Emperor Hirohito's condition.
   The 87-year-old emperor has been bedridden with internal
hemorrhaging since Sept. 19, and his death would lead to a further
closing of the stock market.
   Another dealer with a major securities firm in Tokyo said trading
remained inactive in the afternoon as a majority of institutional
investors remained on the sidelines.
   It was mostly individual investors' buy orders for steel,
shipbuilding and financial issues that boosted the Nikkei index, he
said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   Volume traded on the first section was estimated at 600 million
shares.

swallowing up Joseph Giordano's recycling yard, forcing him to post
a hand-printed sign:
   ``NOT ACCEPTING NEWSPAPER UNTIL FURTHER NOTICE!!''
   The small cardboard announcement is bad news for local
municipalities trying to comply with the state's mandatory recycling
laws, enacted in April 1987. The sign in Giordano's yard is
indicative of a newspaper glut in the recycling business.
   ``I'm limited in places where I can sell it,'' he said. ``I can't
sell newsprint to a tissue mill, because it's not a soft paper. All
overseas markets have put their orders on hold.''
   Aletha Spang, acting administrator in the state's Office of
Recycling, said ``Paper dealers warned us that this could happen.''
   ``Our feeling was that with a strong export market, there
wouldn't be a problem,'' she said.
   Foreign countries, especially in Asia, have traditionally
recycled U.S. newspapers into paperboard that may return to the
United States in the form of boxes for cameras and VCRs. But within
the past few months, the bottom has fallen out of the export market.
   ``The export market has gotten smart,'' Ms. Spang said. ``They
know the paper is going to come, regardless of what they have to
pay.''
   New Jersey, the first state to impose a mandatory recycling
program, in recent weeks has experienced the dilemma of what to do
with massive volumes of waste and not enough recycling facilities.
   ``You can mandate collection, but the state can't mandate making
it into a new product,'' Ms. Spang said. ``That's part of the
marketplace.''
   She tried to be optimistic, saying,``We're hoping this (glut) is
just temporary.''
   But Giordano was blunt about the prospects: ``These newspapers
are probably going to end up in the dump.''
   J. Rodney Edwards, vice president in charge of recycling for the
American Paper Institute in New York, said that while there is
mandatory collection of newspapers, it doesn't necessarily mean
mandatory recycling.
   ``The capacity to use all the newspapers we recycle is limited by
the number of recycling mills,'' he said.
   The mountains of old newspapers are getting so high that
municipalities may soon have to pay recyclers to take the papers
away, said James L. Burke, an executive vice president of Garden
State Paper.
   ``When mandatory recycling first came on line, people thought it
would be a money-making program for their towns,'' he said. ``But
the majority of paper collected from municipalities is of lower
quality than we get from volunteers _ it's filled with mailers,
gummed labels and other contaminants.''
   ``We have to put money and labor into cleaning it up, so we may
have to charge to take it,'' he said.
   Burke noted, however, it may still be cheaper for municipalities
to pay recycling companies to take the papers away.
   ``If tipping fees at the dump are $100 a ton, and we charge a
modest $10 a ton, we may still be a good deal,'' he said.
   John Haas, recycling coordinator for Ocean County, said most
newspapers are now sent to the Garden State plant at a profit, but
there are concerns about the future.
   ``We're noticing what's happening in other parts of the state,
and we're all affected by the same market forces,'' he said.
   Giordano called on state officials to deal with the problem.
   ``The states need to put more pressure on the mills to force them
to buy more recycling material and stop using fibers from trees and
plants,'' he said.
   ``The solid waste problem is economical, social and political,
and it's going to take good political leadership to address the
problem properly,'' he said.

   Ask Mr. Foster Travel, founded 100 years ago
by a know-it-all who insisted his shops be run by single women, is
targeting the European market after being refueled by two new owners
in the past 15 years.
   The nation's oldest travel agency, Ask Mr. Foster, was on the
decline in 1972 when it was purchased by a Los Angeles travel
company headed by Peter Ueberroth, who went on to organize the Los
Angeles Olympic Games and become commissioner of major league
baseball.
   The company is now the major component in the $3 billion Carlson
Travel Group, the travel arm of Minnesota millionaire Curt Carlson's
conglomerate Carlson Cos.
   There were 29 Ask Mr. Foster branch offices when Ueberroth bought
the company for $1 million and hired his brother, John, to help
direct an expansion.
   When Carlson bought the company from Peter Ueberroth in 1979 for
an undisclosed sum, it had more than 100 branches and more than $100
million in annual revenue.
   John Ueberroth joined Carlson when the company was sold and
continued expanding Ask Mr. Foster into one of the continent's
largest travel agencies, with more than 800 offices. The travel
retail network of New York-based American Expres also has more than
800 offices in the United States and Canada.
   John Ueberroth, now president of Carlson Travel, based in the
Minneapolis suburb of Plymouth, has said sales in his group will
double by 1992 to $6 billion. Besides Ask Mr. Foster, the group
includes P. Lawson Travel of Canada, Neiman-Marcus Travel and
Carlson Wholesale Vacations.
   The overseas expansion will initially include contracts with
business-oriented travel agencies in 20 to 30 major European and
Asian cities. Before Ask Mr. Foster was revived by the Ueberroths
and Carlson, it was losing market share and name recognition during
the 1960s because it was undercapitalized and overmatched in an
industry that was on the rise, the company said.
   It had turned into something far different than Ward Grenelle
Foster _ who some call the father of the travel agency in North
America _ envisioned when he opened his first shop in St. Augustine,
Fla., in 1888.
   Foster's penchant for travel grew during his confinement as child
in a New York tuberculosis sanatorium. He developed a passion for
travel literature of any kind and became known as a walking
encyclopedia in St. Augustine. When visitors to America's oldest
city had a question that inn keepers couldn't answer, they were told
to ask Mr. Foster.
   Foster began by printing information guides to various cities,
and by the 1920s, his travel service included 70 offices throughout
by U.S.
   Genevieve Kenna, 87, of Melbourne, Fla., lived through the
changes as one of the company's original ``Foster girls.'' Foster
himself chose Kenna and others because they were single,
``courteous, interested, patient, conscientious, and above all,
enthusiastic in helping people.''
   ``We tried men at first, but they are not up to it,'' Foster said
in a 1924 article about his company. ``Women are more interested in
the problems that come to them and have more graciousness in their
attitude toward people.''
   Women still outnumber men at the travel agent level, but men
began working as agents for Ask Mr. Foster in the 1940s, said Janis
Chamoun, a spokeswoman for the company.
   Ms. Kenna, who worked for the company from 1928-1971, said
traveling was always an important part of the job.
   ``We learned by seeing so that we could say which cities and
hotels were nice to visit,'' said Ms. Kenna, a native of St. Paul.
   She said Foster was ``the super salesman of all time.''
   Frequently traveling more than 50,000 miles a year, Foster owned
the company until 1937, when he sold it to Detroit native Paxton
Mendelssohn, a millionaire heir of the Fisher family who had to deal
with a set of worldwide events that greatly changed the travel
business.
   The outbreak of World War II curtailed domestic travel, and the
rail lines were forced to cancel their contracts with Ask Mr.
Foster. It wasn't until 10 years of depression and four years of war
had passed that the American public took to the road again _ this
time in unprecedented numbers.
   With the demand for rail service so great, the railroads canceled
their advertising contracts with Ask Mr. Foster, and the fee-based
travel agency business gradually turned to commissions as its prime
source of revenue. The process was accelerated with the popularity
of air travel in the 1950s.
   In 1957, the company was purchased by two Ask Mr. Foster
shareholders. They sold it to Ueberroth's company in 1972 after
operations continued to sag.
   Under Carlson, Ask Mr. Foster has grown eightfold under an
aggressive expansion mode. In September, for example, Carlson
purchased Gelco Travel Management Service Inc. from Gelco Corp., to
expand Ask Mr. Foster by 83 offices.
   Many of the travel agencies are owned by the parent company, but
others are owned by franchisees, Chamoun said.

<HEAD>Mexican Oil Demand Rising, Country Facing Loss of Export Role,
Report Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MEXICO CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mexico may no longer be a major exporter of
oil by the end of the century unless new crude deposits are found
because domestic consumption continues to rise, the Mexican
Petroleum Institute said Monday.
   The institute said in a report the state petroleum monopoly Pemex
will have to cut down on exports and increase current proven
reserves by at least 12.5 billion barrels during the next 11 years
just to keep up with growing domestic demand.
   Mexico's total energy consumption is currently equivalent to
2.325 million barrels of crude oil daily, 80 percent of which is
made up of petroleum and the rest is generated by hydroelectric
plants, according to the report.
   This could go up to the equivalent of 3.7 million barrels daily
by the year 2000 and to 5.9 million barrels by the year 2010, the
institute said.
   The country's proven oil reserves currently stand at about 72
billion barrels of crude. It produces 2.5 million barrels daily and
sells 1.325 million barrrels, mostly to the United States, making it
the world's sixth largest exporter.

<HEAD>Japan's Economy Will Continue To Grow In 1989, Government Predicts</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Japan's economy, which has already been expanding
for 25 months, will continue to grow in 1989, the Economic Planning
Agency predicted Monday.
   In its 1988 report on Japan's economy, the agency said domestic
demand continued to spur growth and help reduce the country's large
trade surplus.
   It said there was nothing in sight in the country itself that
could retard economic growth, predicting that the economy will
maintain ``smooth growth, with personal spending and corporate
capital investment as the engine.''
   However, the agency stressed the need for astute management of
fiscal and monetary policies and stepped-up efforts to ease various
restrictions, open markets and cut the trade surplus.
   The report also said it was necessary for Japan to coordinate
policies with other major industrial countries to head off inflation.
   The government has set an inflation-adjusted growth goal of 3.8
percent for fiscal 1988, which ends March 31, but most economists
have said an expansion of more than 5 percent was possible because
of the present robust domestic demand.
   At present, the agency report noted, corporate capital spending
was mainly fueling growth, pushing up production and spurring
consumption through creation of more jobs and higher income. This,
in turn, was prompting corporations to pour more money into the
improvement of production and other facilities.
   The agency shrugged off worries among some economists about
excessive production, pointing out that much of the equipment
investment was going into research and development that does not
lead immediately to an increase in production.

   Athletic apparel manufactuarer Reebok
International has remained atop the rankings of the most profitable
companies in the United States, Forbes magazine said Monday.
   Reebok, known for its popular leather athletic footwear, had a
more than 200 percent average return on equity during the last four
years, with a 27.7 percent return over the past 12 months, according
to Forbes, which compiled its annual listing of the nation's most
profitable firms.
   The business magazine tallied firms' return on equity _ the
measure of how much a corporation earns on its shareholders'
investments _ over the last three to five years. Forbes listed 1,116
companies in its rankings, which are being published in the
magazine's Jan. 9 issue.
   Right behind Canton, Mass.-based Reebok was Delta Woodside
Industries, a Greenville, S.C.-based fabric and apparel maker, with
a more than 200 percent return on equity over the past three years,
and a 37.8 percent return in the last year.
   Third on the list was CenTrust Savings Bank, a Miami-based
savings and loan company, with a 150.6 percent return over four
years, and a 6.7 percent return in the most recent 12 months.
   No. 4 was Anchor Glass Container, of Tampa, Fla., which had a
133.2 percent return over the last four years and 5.1 percent in the
past 12 months.
   In fifth place was Jepson Corp., a consumer and industrial
products company, with a 94.4 percent return over three years and a
19.3 percent return in the last 12 months.
   The least profitable company in the nation was Public Service of
New Hampshire, which had a 0.2 percent return in the past five
years, with a loss in the most recent year. Forbes also listed 175
companies which had losses for their five-year average returns, or
for which three-to-five year figures were not available.
   Because the rankings consider a company's aggregate performance
over several years, some of the companies with recent profit
declines or losses may still rank high on the list.
   Rounding out the top 10 profitable companies were: Microsoft
Corp., of Redmond, Wash., with a 73.9 percent return over five years
and a 43.2 percent return in the last year; Western Savings & Loan,
based in Phoenix, with a 69.6 percent five-year return and a 1.3
percent return for the most recent 12 months; Pilgrim's Pride Corp.,
of Pittsburg, Texas, with a 68.4 percent return over four years and
a loss in the most recent year; Best Buy Co. of Bloomington, Minn.,
with a 60.2 percent return over five years and a 3.1 percent return
in the last 12 months; and Chrysler Corp., with a 59.4 percent
return over four years and a 14.8 percent return for the past year.
   As part of its survey, Forbes also named the companies it
believes are set to make the biggest comebacks, with General Motors
Corp. among the candidates.
   Forbes noted that GM has reduced its costs and said the
automaker's loss of market share seems to be leveling off.
   Turner Broadcasting System Inc. also was named as a comeback
candidate. Although the company is still showing losses, it has cuts
its shortfall by a third, Forbes said.
   Another company that has turned around is toymaker Mattel Inc.,
which has managed a strong earnings increase although its sales were
down during the first nine months of the year, Forbes said.
   Among other firms recovering from declines are steelmaker USX
Corp., retailer Gap Inc., Mellon Bank Corp. and GTE Corp., the
telecommunications company, Forbes said.

   Japanese companies spent a record 4.19 trillion yen
_ the equivalent of $33.8 billion _ last year on entertainment and
gifts, according to the National Tax Administration Agency.
   The agency, in a report released Monday, said spending by
hospitals and the life insurance industry was highest at 9.67
million yen per firm.
   The 4.19 trillion yen total for entertainment spending
represented an average daily expenditure of 11.4 billion yen _ a 6.1
percent increase over 1986, when wining and dining clients cost
companies a total 3.95 trillion yen, the agency said.
   Japanese executives are often given carte blanche to entertain at
exclusive nightclubs and Japanese-style inns, where an evening meal
can cost $500 or more.
   Inviting clients for rounds of golf and exchanging gifts are
other customary entertainment expenses.

<HEAD>Arbitration On The Rise As Doubts About Litigation Grow</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: for Tuesday PMs; Business Analyst John Cunniff is on vacation.</NOTE>

   Litigation will always be the bedrock of the
American judicial system, but many businesses are deciding it's not
for them.
   More and more, companies that can't resolve their differences by
negotiation are submitting them to impartial arbitrators who weigh
both sides and hand down binding decisions.
   Commercial arbitration cases rose 84 percent from 1983 to last
year and are still increasing, the American Arbitration Association
says.
   Arbitration makes sense in many situations. It saves time and
money and puts complex matters in the hands of trained experts
instead of untrained, unpredictable judges or juries.
   ``The idea of asking 12 uneducated, uninformed jurors to try to
decide an issue that is complex and requires technical training and
experience in an industry _ it just doesn't make sense,'' said
Robert Coulson, president of the arbitration association.
   In arbitration, Coulson said, ``You can pick an arbitrator who's
expert on the industry, or patent law, or whatever aspect of
technical information that is relevant to the case.''
   Arbitration gained credibility when computer rivals International
Business Machines Corp. and Fujitsu Ltd. used it to end a bitter
dispute over IBM's copyrights on mainframe computer software.
   IBM has a glorious history of victories in the legal system, so
some analysts said it was foolish of the company to surrender so
much control over its future to a law professor and a retired
railroad executive whose judgments are impossible to appeal.
   But choosing arbitration probably shaved tens or hundreds of
millions of dollars from IBM's _ and Fujitsu's _ legal fees while
removing crippling uncertainty over the terms of their competition.
   Even patent lawyers like the trend, mainly because they are so
overworked they don't mind the competition from arbitrators. Juries
simply can't grasp many patent issues, said Michael Blommer,
executive director of the American Intellectual Property Law
Association.
   ``When the Constitution was written, there weren't cases like
this where the average man couldn't understand the facts,'' Blommer
said.
   That was before the days of biotechnology and microelectronics.
   In a complex patent case today, Blommer said, ``If under
cross-examination somebody is forced to recant or change his
position, the jury might not understand that he even is changing his
position.''
   Federal judges do a little better, but not many of them studied
science or engineering, either. The judiciary took a step in the
right direction in 1982 by sending all patent appeals to the Federal
Circuit in Washington, where many judges are highly trained and have
expert clerks.
   Actually, most arbitration is on matters other than intellectual
property disputes. Labor grievances account for about a third of the
American Arbitration Association's business. Other big areas are
construction contracts, disputes between stockbrokers and clients,
insurance claims and supervision of elections of private
organizations.
   Many contracts are being written to include provisions that any
disputes over them will be submitted to arbitration.
   Non-binding arbitration, where decisions can be appealed to the
courts, is also growing in popularity. The Better Business Bureau
does it. So does the insurance industry. Courts in 20 to 25 states
and 10 federal districts have annexes that do arbitration to clear
out cases that don't need to go before a judge or jury.
   Trials, particularly trials by juries, clearly have a place.
Criminal cases are obviously not suited to arbitration. Arbitrators
are also unsuited to try cases where major societal questions are at
stake, such as the round of lawsuits against cigarette companies
over health damage from smoking.
   Even in areas where arbitration is well-suited, there is a cost
in civil liberties. The state of Massachusetts, in a first, is
trying to prohibit stockbrokers from requiring that their clients
agree ahead of time to settle disputes by arbitration.
   A federal judge last week threw out Massachusetts' regulatory
effort, but the state vowed to appeal.
   ``Compulsory arbitration or arbitration agreements entered into
by citizens who do not recognize they are forfeiting their
constitutional right to trial by jury is counter to the American
system of fair play,'' the Association of Trial Lawyers of America
said.
   Americans have not lost their taste for suing the living
daylights out of each other. Clearly, though, arbitration has plenty
of room to grow.
   ``It's exciting to let people take control of their own disputes
and use their innovation and ideas to resolve them in a practical
way,'' Coulson said.
