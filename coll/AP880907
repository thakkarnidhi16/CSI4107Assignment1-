   Republican George Bush criticized Democrat Michael Dukakis
before a Jewish group Wednesday as having ``trouble making up his
mind'' on whether to support or oppose creation of a Palestinian
state. But Dukakis told the same group he would ``never recognize a
unilateral declaration of a Palestinian state or government in
exile.''
   Bush and Dukakis were speaking to a B'nai B'rith convention in
Baltimore.
   The vice president was the first to address the Jewish group and
he underscored the closeness of U.S.-Israel relations.
   ``No threat, no stone thrown, is strong enough to divide us. No
wedge will be driven between us,'' Bush pledged.
   Bush declared his opposition to creation of an independent
Palestinian state in the Middle East and criticized Dukakis,
although he didn't mention him by name.
   ``My administration would not support the creation of any
Palestinian entity that would jeopardize the security of our
strategic ally, Israel,'' he said.
   ``Anyone who has trouble making up his mind on this issue, or
who proposes to leave it open, just doesn't understand the dangers
to Israel and to the United States; just doesn't understand the
very real threats that continue to exist,'' added Bush.
   Dukakis has said the question of a Palestinian state should be a
matter of negotiations between Israel and its neighbors.
   Dukakis pledged support for Israel and said Republican vice
presidential nominee Dan Quayle ``has voted repeatedly against
foreign assistance to Israel.''
   ``We will not sell weapons that would threaten the security of
Israel to any nation,'' he said.
   ``The Republicans have sold AWACS (planes) to Saudi Arabia,
Mavericks (missiles) to Kuwait, Stingers (missiles) to Bahrain and
billions of additional dollars worth of sophisticated arms to Arab
countries that refuse to make peace with Israel,'' Dukakis said.
   ``George Bush has supported those sales, and Dan Quayle has
voted for them. Lloyd Bentsen and I are going to say `no' to Arab
shopping lists that endanger the security of Israel,'' he said.
   In a break with the Reagan administration on the domestic front,
Bush told Knight-Ridder newspapers Wednesday he will soon outline a
proposal calling for ``some adjustment'' in the minimum wage.
   The administration opposes raising the minimum wage, which is
now $3.35 an hour. But campaign sources told Knight-Ridder that
Bush was expected to link a raise in the minimum wage to a
sub-minimum wage ``training differential'' for teen-agers and other
new hires. Congress has opposed such a differential in the past.
   ``We ought to maintain a minimum wage differential for training
people,'' Bush said. Bush has been criticized by his opponents as
insensitive to the needs of working people.
   The vice president received encouraging news from the latest ABC
News-Washington Post poll which found Bush leading Dukakis by an
eight-point margin.
   The survey of 1,104 likely voters found that 51 percent favored
Bush while 43 percent prefer Dukakis. The poll, conducted Aug. 31
to Sept. 6, had a margin of error of 3.5 percent.
   An another front, however, the Bush campaign ran into a public
relations problem because of a second record linking the public
relations and lobbying activities of Bush campaign members with
governments with drug connections.
   NBC and CBS reported Wednesday that campaign manager Lee
Atwater, senior adviser Charles Black and scheduler Paul J.
Manafort were parties in the lobbying firm of Black, Manafort &
Stone, which was paid $800,000 to represent the Bahamian government
in 1985.
   The proposed contract with the government of Prime Minister
Lynden Pindling mentioned that ``in fact, the Drug Enforcement
Agency and the Department of Treasury could be viewed as active
critics of Pindling administration policy.''
   The emphasis of the lobbying plan ``should be a mixture of
Executive Branch concentration and Congressional lobbying,'' the
proposal said, noting connections within the State Department and
with then-Attorney General Edwin Meese III.
   Bush at the time was spearheading a drug-enforcement effort that
included investigations of Pindling. A report last week linked Bush
aide Stuart Spencer with lobbying efforts on behalf of Panamanian
leader Manuel Antonio Noriega.
   Bush caused a momentary stir at an American Legion convention in
Louisville, Ky., when he mistakenly referred to the day as the
anniversary of the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor.
   ``I wonder how many remember today is Pearl Harbor day,'' Bush
told the veterans. ``Forty-seven years ago to this day we were hit
and hit hard at Pearl Harbor and we were not ready.''
   He went on, but then, alerted by the murmuring among the 6,000
veterans in the audience, Bush abruptly stopped and said:
   ``Did I say Sept. 7? Sorry about that.''
   The attack was on Dec. 7, 1941.
   Bush said Dukakis would ``cancel and delay our strategic
modernization with what amounts to an undeclared unilateral
freeze.''
   Democratic presidential nominee Dukakis spoke at Kean College in
Union, N.J., and asked, ``Where was George Bush while his
administration was doing its best to slam the door of college
opportunity in the face of millions of young people across this
country?''
   ``George was right there _ all the time,'' said Dukakis. ``Not
doing and not saying a thing.''
   The Massachusetts governor said he and his running mate Lloyd
Bentsen ``are going to stop the assault on college loans and
grants, and we're going to stop it cold.''
   Dukakis described his own proposal under which the federal
government would guarantee bank loans to college students with
repayment based on a percentage of future earnings and extending
over a person's working life.
   Bush has proposed allowing parents to earn interest tax-free on
U.S. savings bonds to help pay for college, but he has not
suggested any overhaul of the loan program.
   But the Reagan administration has already launched a small,
experimental income-contingent loan program, with repayments pegged
to students' income in later life. The Democratic controlled
Congress balked last year at a major expansion of the program, now
being tried at 10 campuses.
   Bentsen and Republican vice presidential nominee Dan Quayle
tended to Senate business.

   Only a few birds are chirping at 8:30
a.m. when the sounds of a Tchaikovsky piano concerto fill the woods
of this northern Michigan town.
   The World Youth Symphony is rehearsing for an upcoming
performance. The music flows with deceiving precision: One could be
listening to a symphony orchestra, not a collection of high school
musicians at summer camp.
   But this is anything but an ordinary summer camp.
   ``This place is a paradox because the natural aspect is serene,
but serene is hardly the word to describe the activity here. It's
crazy,'' said Ray Wilkins, chairman of the camp's visual arts
department.
   The National Music Camp, the 61st edition of which ended in
August, attracts 2,100 campers from third grade through high
school. They come from all 50 states and 26 foreign countries to
spend a summer of intensive study in music, dance, drama and the
visual arts.
   Many campers already are accomplished in their chosen field.
They come to hone their skills at the camp, which is spread over
1,200 acres and has about 450 buildings. The camper-staff ratio is
almost two to one, and private lessons are available for those who
want them.
   ``These are bright kids, and many of them are extremely
well-equipped for a career in the arts,'' said Tom Oosting,
director of the camp's theater program.
   With such a collection of talent, competition among campers can
get intense.
   ``People come to the National Music Camp to see how they stack
up,'' said Edward Downing, the camp's director. ``A lot of big
decisions can be made during the summer as young people decide on a
possible career in the arts.''
   Perhaps the most intense competition occurs every Friday, when
violinists in The World Youth Symphony challenge each other for the
right to sit in the first chair. The competition is known as
``Bloody Friday.''
   ``There are people who take it too seriously, but competition
has always been a part of being here,'' Downing said. ``We like to
think it's friendly competition and we try to keep it that way.
   ``It's an opportunity for the camper to show how he or she has
progressed, not necessarily to beat the next person ahead of you.''
   Despite the emphasis on the arts, campers enjoy their free time
like others their age. Many boys and girls like to find a secluded
spot in the evening to talk quietly.
   George Wolff, a high school student from Warren, Mich., said
some campers like to play classical music but never would listen to
it on their own. ``It's kind of humorous,'' he said. ``People will
play Mozart and Beethoven, then come back to their cabin and listen
to a Led Zeppelin cassette.''
   The camp's scenic location is a main reason youngsters get so
much out of the program.
   ``This place is absolutely conducive to clearing your mind and
focusing on your work,'' Oosting said. ``You need blue skies and
varied visual stimuli.''
   The camp, which was founded in 1927, also does its best to make
sure the kids are kept busy. Campers in the theater department can
be involved in up to three plays at one time.
   However, said Oosting, the theater program can be daunting.
Rehearsal time is limited because the camp's activities are
structured in 50-minute periods.
   ``Most Gilbert and Sullivan operettas are 2{ hours long, but are
rehearsed and staged here in 50-minute periods,'' he said. ``In
most cases, until the actual performance, it's probably never been
run through from beginning to end.''
   Campers belie their youth in terms of dedication to their
specialty. At night, it is not unusual to hear the sounds of a
violin or horn coming from cabins, as campers practice on their own.
   During the day, the youth bustle from one class to the next _
walking quickly with a clear sense of purpose.
   Wolff said he would like to become an opera singer, a career
goal shared by few of his peers.
   ``When I was 14 and listening to opera, it was hard for some
people to handle,'' he said. ``But I don't limit myself to
listening to just opera, I listen to all kinds of music.''
   The rules at the camp can be interpreted as strict. All campers
are required to wear a uniform _ blue corduroy pants for boys and
knickers for girls and blue shirts for all. Campers from third
through ninth grade are not allowed to leave the grounds during the
eight-week session. High schoolers are permitted to leave only with
their parents or other pre-approved adults.
   ``Yeah, sometimes the rules get out of hand, but it's really
trivial compared with what you're learning,'' Wolff said.

   Faced with the prospect of losing the
grain farm that has been in their family for most of this century,
seven members of the Richard Kurth family turned to a new cash crop
_ marijuana.
   That decision, discovered in a drug bust last fall, has turned
many in this farm town of 1,700 against the Kurths. Some see no end
to the controversy, particularly after most of the family received
reduced sentences.
   ``I don't believe they will ever be able to live in the
community again,'' said Joan Stewart, editor of The River Press
newspaper. ``It's never going to be forgotten.''
   Yet some of the Kurths say all they want to do is remain on the
4,500-acre farm and cattle feedlot, which still faces foreclosure.
   ``I'm not going to let a community shove me out,'' said Cindy
Halley, daughter of Richard Kurth, the family patriarch.
   It's not just the family's action that has upset Fort Benton.
About 960 valid signatures, far more than the 549 needed, have been
gathered on a petition to recall Chouteau County Prosecutor Tom
Sheehy over the way the case was handled.
   ``This type of prosecution will only encourage more drug
traffic,'' says the petition, which expresses concern over plea
bargaining and notes the Kurths were not required to post bond.
   ``This `prominent' family has never paid a cent of bail, they
weren't brought in,'' complained Winnie Appleby, who runs a local
motel.
   Dr. William Gertson, heading the recall effort, said people
wanted Sheehy to turn the case over to federal prosecutors
``because we felt like he was inexperienced and we felt like he was
so liberal that nothing would happen.''
   The prosecutor, who is suing to invalidate the recall petitions,
defended the plea bargains that resulted in convictions of Richard
Kurth and his wife, Judy, both 57, and five others.
   ``Guilty is guilty,'' Sheehy said.
   He noted that District Judge Chan Ettien released the family
members on their own recognizance and reduced sentences that Sheehy
recommended.
   Richard Kurth received four concurrent 20-year sentences, with
all but five years suspended, while his wife received a five-year
sentence with all but one year suspended. Both could be out in less
than a year, with good behavior. Sentences for the others were
suspended altogether or deferred.
   Ettien struck a nerve with his courtroom comment that the social
ill from marijuana use ``does not approach that of alcohol.''
   The judge, who declined to elaborate, wrote in his sentencing
order that, except for one criminal offense, the Kurths had been
``an exemplary group.''
   Some people in town agree. Howard Axtman, who sells farm
equipment and had two Kurth children in his Boy Scout troop, said,
``I'm not a supporter of what they did. I don't think anyone is.
But they were good people.''
   Up to a point, they were typical people, too.
   Most farmers in Montana have suffered years of drought and low
prices for grain.
   But in 1985, Richard and Judy Kurth decided that to pay their
debts they would grow marijuana. They have said the decision
stemmed from an offhand remark made by an officer of Norwest Bank
in Great Falls.
   ``Perhaps in jest, perhaps not,'' the bank officer suggested
they could save their ranch only by ``growing an illegal cash crop
of some sort, perhaps marijuana,'' defense lawyer Ralph Randono
said at the couple's sentencing.
   He contended the bank was ``very aware'' of what the Kurths were
doing.
   Frank Shaw, president of the bank, termed the comments
``preposterous and total fabrications.''
   After beginning the operation, the couple decided to recruit
their adult children. All three agreed, along with two of their
spouses; son Bill Kurth's wife, Lisa, was not involved, authorities
said.
   ``Kind of the way I took it was either you hop on the bandwagon
and help out or I guess you can just go down the road and find
another job,'' said son-in-law Clay Halley, ``because it was either
do this and save the ranch or there wasn't going to be any ranch.''
   In nearly two years, authorities say the family sold $400,000
worth of marijuana.
   In addition to the sentences, the state is seeking $750,000 in
taxes and interest, based on the estimated value of the 2,155
marijuana plants seized in last October's raid.
   Family members had a lot to learn about growing marijuana, they
said in a recent interview. First, they went to libraries and
bookstores. They also received advice from customers, lost some
crops and learned from mistakes.
   ``Just like anything else in agriculture, you try it and if it
doesn't work, you change it and try it again,'' Clay Halley said.
   Hired men and customers came and went at the farm, 14 miles
south of Fort Benton, without knowing marijuana was being grown and
dried in four separate buildings with automatic watering and
lighting systems. Windows and doors in those buildings were locked
and covered.
   Even sheriff's deputies, serving papers involving the Kurths'
debts, had no reason to suspect anything, said Undersheriff Doug
Williams.
   The loan agreement showed Norwest Bank had agreed to forgive the
Kurths' $1.3 million loan if they paid $275,000. They paid $125,000
and hoped to make the final payments by April 1988, then
restructure their debts with the Federal Land Bank, save the farm
and stop growing marijuana.
   ``Our objective was to not continue this thing over two years,
and when we got done in two years, to still have a ranch,'' said
son Doug Kurth.
   Just 5{ months before the last loan payment was due, federal and
county law officers arrived at the Kurth property, after receiving
a tip.
   The Kurths say they were actually relieved to see law officers
pull up on Oct. 18. Two days earlier, men posing as Drug
Enforcement Administration agents had attempted a robbery. The
following day, they had received a $25,000 extortion demand.
   But they have since had to face their own young children, deal
with publicity and withstand the continued scrutiny of their
neighbors and the townspeople.
   The family's clothing, cars, travel and entertainment are often
discussed, and many people maintain the Kurths could have altered a
lifestyle described as ``high-flying'' if they had truly wanted to
get out of debt.
   ``They lived so much higher than people who were in debt,'' said
Gertson. ``They were flashy in their dress, flashy in their way of
living.''
   And editor Stewart said of Richard Kurth, ``His lifestyle is not
poor farmer, and never has been.''
   Doug Kurth and his wife, Rhonda, and the Halleys say such talk
is a price they pay for living in a small town. Despite it all, the
two families want to remain.
   Doug summed up the message he'd like to convey to the community,
saying: ``Hey, it's over with. We're paying our debt to society.
Leave us alone.''

<HEAD>Jews And Human Rights Leaders Hail Argentine Anti-Discrimination
Law</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Human rights leaders and Jews are
hailing a new law that imposes fines or jail sentences on anyone
convicted of discrimination based on race, religion or sex.
   They call it a significant advance in the protection of civil
liberties in Argentina.
   ``We think the law has extraordinary social and political
significance for Argentine society,'' said David Goldberg,
president of the Delegation of Argentine Israelite Associations.
   ``There was a gap in previous legislation in that there was no
penalty for those who did discriminate,'' said Goldberg, a medical
doctor whose organization is the largest of several that represent
the estimated 400,000 Jews in this South American country.
   Simon Lazara, a Socialist congressman and a leader of the
Permanent Assembly for Human Rights, said, ``The law is not solely
aimed at anti-Semitism, but also at discrimination based on color
or creed, or against the native (Indian) communities.''
   The legislation was introduced early in 1984 by President Raul
Alfonsin, who co-founded and ran the Permanent Assembly for Human
Rights before he was elected to office in October 1983. His
inauguration seven weeks later ended a harsh, nearly eight-year
military dictatorship.
   As reworked and finally approved by Congress in August, the new
law penalizes anyone who ``arbitrarily blocks, obstructs or
restricts ... the full exercise ... of fundamental rights and
guarantees.''
   Argentina's Constitution of 1853 as amended protects the right
to assembly, universal suffrage and freedom of speech and worship,
although Roman Catholicism is the country's official religion and
only Catholics can hold the nation's presidency and vice presidency.
   The law punishes by jail up to three years anyone convicted of
belonging to an organization that promotes the superiority of one
race or color or creed over another.
   Anyone convicted of a crime or offense committed ``in
persecution or hatred of a race, religion or nationality, or with
the intent to destroy ... a national, ethnic, racial or religious
group,'' could be sentenced to additional fines or prison.
   The law also requires restitution in cases of property damage.
   ``Overall, the new law constitutes a vision of the new democracy
in Argentina, reflecting the conditions that have existed since the
end of the last military dictatorship,'' Lazara said.
   Argentina's century-old tradition of democracy has been
tarnished by six military interventions since 1930, including coups
that ousted Gen. Juan D. Peron in 1955, two civilian presidents in
the 1960s, and Peron's wife Isabel in 1976.
   More than 9,000 Argentines, most of them sons and daughters of
the middle class, ``disappeared'' and are presumed dead following
their arrests in the late 1970s by security forces trying to crush
the Montonero urban guerrillas and leftist political opposition in
general.
   Discrimination usually is not overt, but it is pervasive. Darker
skinned Argentines of Indian descent, while not barred from
white-collar jobs, more commonly are manual laborers. Very few Jews
are in the army. Women are paid less than men for doing the same
job.
   Anti-Semitism in recent years has been reflected by the knocking
over of Jewish tombstones in cemeteries, the painting of
anti-Semitic graffitti on walls and, very infrequently but always
intimidating, the setting off of small bombs in the doorways of
synagogues.
   ``We don't have a very serious problem of discrimination based
on religion or race, but there is, in the background, among certain
sectors, some anti-Semitism,'' said Jose Ignacio Lopez, Alfonsin's
press secretary.
   Angel Grushka, leader of the leftist Federation of Jewish
Cultural Entities, said the new law is helpful, but he added tha
the wished the acts of discrimination that would invoke the
penalties were more precisely spelled out.
   ``We still have to work very hard on the judicial level to make
sure that anti-Semitic actions are punished,'' Grushka said.
   Anti-discrimination legislation in Argentine law dates to 1949.
In 1964, similar legislation that penalized those convicted of
discrimination was implemented, but that legislation was revoked by
the military government that came to power two years later.

   This year has brought a heady string of successses
to Javier Perez de Cuellar, the U.N. secretary-general, tempered by
reminders that enmities built over centuries do not fade easily.
   Another sobering element is the near-insolvency of his
organization, which was created in 1945 as the hope of the world
but in recent years has been called inept or useless at best and,
at worst, seriously biased.
   The run of success began in April with an agreement for the
Soviet Union to withdraw its 100,000 soldiers from Afghanistan
after more than eight years of helping the communist government
fight Moslem guerrillas. That agreement took six years of U.N.
mediation.
   Then, in the past two weeks, came the Iran-Iraq cease-fire,
direct talks between the belligerents, a revival of negotiations on
a settlement in divided Cyprus and acceptance of a U.N. peace plan
for the disputed Western Sahara.
   U.N. roles also are foreseen in southern Africa and Cambodia,
where progress has been made toward peaceful settlements.
   A sign of growing U.N. popularity is the increased sales of
T-shirts emblazoned with doves of peace and its blue-and-white
globe emblem.
   Reality is always present, however, to keep euphoria from
getting out of hand.
   In Geneva, the Iran-Iraq peace negotiations that began Aug. 25
were deadlocked this week.
   No one had expected the enemies to shake hands and make up
immediately after eight years of war, but Perez de Cuellar admitted
to frustration nonetheless.
   He left the negotiations Thursday to meet other commitments,
appointing Sweden's U.N. ambassador, Jan Eliasson, to continue his
work as mediator.
   A new problem arose when the Afghan government asked for more
talks on the U.N.-mediated Afghan agreement. The Soviet Union said
this week it had sent jet fighters back into the country to help
the army fight the rebels, who are supported by the United States
and Pakistan.
   If all goes well and a larger U.N. role is required to monitor
regional political settlements, the money problem will grow because
some members, including the United States, are behind in their dues.
   Arrears in dues total $600 million. The United States owes more
than $467 million to the regular budget and $70 million to
peacekeeping operations.
   ``Funding is a huge problem,'' U.N. spokesman Francois Giuliani
told reporters in Geneva this week. He said the organization was
going broke and being forced to use money intended for October
salaries to pay for the U.N. peacekeepers in Iran and Iraq, where
the cease-fire began Aug. 20.
   Diplomats say they expect the United States and other members,
as in past budget crises, to produce the money needed for the
organization and its peacekeeping operations.
   One reason for the new effectiveness of the 159-member world
organization is increased cooperation among the five permanent
Security Council members _ the United States, Soviet Union,
Britain, China and France _ according to the diplomats.
   They say an Afghan agreement was possible because of improved
East-West relations and the decision by Soviet leader Mikhail S.
Gorbachev to cut Soviet losses and withdraw.
   The main U.N. role is that of catalyst, ready to enter the
picture when nations realize their best interests lie in settling
regional conflicts.
   ``We must be patient,'' Perez de Cuellar said Thursday when
questioned about lack of progress in the Iran-Iraq talks.
   ``These problems are very difficult and complicated. They cannot
be solved overnight. Remember how long the Afghanistan talks went
on.''
   He admitted to frustration at the slow pace, however, and said
he had been very busy with meetings on the Cyprus and the Western
Sahara problems.
   Recent achievements by the United Nations make an impressive
list and Perez de Cuellar has been mentioned as a possible
candidate for the Nobel Peace Prize. The 68-year-old Peruvian
diplomat says the prize, if awarded, should go to the organization
rather than the man.

   This year's summer movies, attacked for being
everything from blasphemous to reactionary, nevertheless shattered
box-office records, with a cartoon bunny and an African prince
leading the way.
   While critics debated the alleged evils of ``The Last Temptation
of Christ'' and ``Rambo III,'' moviegoers plunked down
approximately $1.7 billion for tickets.
   That beats the previous summer record of $1.59 billion, set in
1987.
   ``People are movie-minded and they're going,'' Bob Selig,
president of the National Association of Theater Owners in
California, said Tuesday. ``People are just not going to stay at
home every night regardless of what they have there.''
   Videocassettes and cable television, though increasingly
popular, didn't keep fans from ``Who Framed Roger Rabbit'' and
``Coming to America,'' each of which grossed more than $110 million.
   The summer season, which began in late May and concluded on
Labor Day, was not dominated by any movie, as ``Beverly Hills Cop
II'' and ``Top Gun'' had done in 1987 and 1986, respectively.
Indeed, four separate movies led this summer's box-office tally.
   Disney's ``Roger Rabbit,'' an unusual comedy merging animation
and live action, was the season's No. 1 hit, followed closely by
Paramount's ``Coming to America,'' featuring Eddie Murphy as an
African prince in search of an American bride. Not far behind was
Paramount's ```Crocodile' Dundee II,'' the fish-out-of-water
adventure story that took in more than $100 million, and ``Big,''
20th Century Fox's comic look at a child trapped in a man's body,
which is close to passing the $100 million mark.
   ``To have four movies over $100 million is unusual. I believe
it's only happened once before,'' said Barry London, president of
marketing and distribution for Paramount Pictures.
   London said the quantity of good movies this summer ``created an
environment'' for audiences. ``The public's having a good time with
one movie makes them want to come back again,'' London said.
   ``It's been a good, diverse product mix,'' said Peter Farwell,
vice president of corporate relations for General Cinema, the
country's fourth-largest theater chain. ``It seems we've had movies
that appeal to all segments of the population _ there's been
something for everybody.''
   Film reviewers apparently had little impact on which movies
became hits: ``Coming to America'' met with mixed reviews and MGM's
``Willow'' and Disney's ``Cocktail,'' both panned, still brought in
more than $50 million apiece.
   At the same time, the controversies surrounding ``Last
Temptation'' and ``Rambo III'' appeared to have little to do with
their box office performance. ``Last Temptation,'' which probably
wouldn't have been a box-office hit under any circumstances,
collected more than $2 million after being blasted by conservative
Christians for its depiction of a Jesus with human weaknesses.
   ``Rambo III,'' the violent Soviet-bashing saga about its
invasion of Afghanistan that opened the week the Russians began
pulling out of the country, grabbed only $55 million in the
nation's theaters, down sharply from the $150-million success of
``Rambo: First Blood Part II'' in 1985.
   Summer flops included ``The Big Blue,'' ``Big Top Pee-wee,''
``Mac & Me,'' ``The Rescue'' and ``Monkey Shines.''

   The Associated Press has appointed news editors
in Argentina and Puerto Rico and a correspondent in Belgium in a
trio of foreign moves, AP President Louis D. Boccardi announced
Tuesday.
   Edmund W. McCullough, news editor in San Juan, has been named
news editor in Buenos Aires. McCullough, 38, replaces Randall L.
Hackley, who transferred to the Foreign Desk in New York.
   Robert T. Glass assumes the news editor position in San Juan.
Glass, 41, had been a newsman in London since 1981, when he
transferred from New York.
   Sally A. Jacobsen, a Mexico City newswoman, has been appointed
NATO and Common Market correspondent in Brussels. Jacobsen, 42,
replaces Robert W. Burns, who transferred to Washington, D.C.
   McCullough, a native of Stamford, Conn., joined the AP in 1981,
working as a newsman in Albany and Buffalo, N.Y. He transferred to
Washington in 1983 as New York regional reporter. Two years later,
he moved to the World Services Desk in New York. He was assigned to
San Juan in 1986.
   Glass, a native of Nashville, Tenn., joined the AP as a newsman
in 1974 in Philadelphia. He transferred to the General Desk in 1977
and worked in New York until his assignment to London.
   Jacobsen, a native of Gunnison, Colo., joined the AP in 1976 as
a newswoman in Baltimore. She transferred to Washington three years
later. In 1985, she moved to the Foreign Desk and was assigned
later that year to Mexico City.

   ``Nightmare on Elm Street'' made a killing at
the nation's movie theaters for the third-consecutive weekend as
summer box-office revenues reached about $1.7 billion, the highest
ever.
   With Labor Day weekend receipts of more than $43 million, this
year's summer movie season surpassed 1987's record of $1.59
billion. The season runs from late May to Labor Day.
   The top eight spots in the box-office list were mostly unchanged
from a week ago, with ``Betrayed'' emerging as something of a
late-summer hit.
   ``A Nightmare on Elm Street 4: The Dream Master'' took in $6.4
million last weekend. ``Betrayed,'' a movie about white
supremacists, finished second with $5.5 million.
   Finishing third was ``A Fish Called Wanda,'' with $5.1 million,
followed by ``Die Hard'' in fourth with $4.8 million and ``Who
Framed Roger Rabbit'' in fifth place, with $4.4 million.
   ``Cocktail'' finished sixth with $4.4 million, just $60,000 less
than ``Roger Rabbit,'' ``Young Guns'' was seventh with $4.1
million, ``Married to the Mob'' was eighth with $3.4 million,
``Big'' ninth with $2.5 million and ``Tucker'' 10th with $2.3
million.
   Here are the top films for the long holiday weekend as tallied
by Exhibitor Relations, with distributor, weekend gross, number of
theater screens, average per screen, total gross and number of

reported.
   The agency, monitored in Nicosia, on Tuesday quoted Morteza
Arami, Managing Director of the Bank of Industry and Mines as
saying shares will be offered at determined ceiling and base prices.
   They will be sold to the highest bidder within the pre-set
limits, he said.
   Aramai was quoted as saying the establishments, affiliated to
the bank, have annual sales of 150 billion riyals ($2 billion) and
include factories producing 92 percent of the glass needed in the
country, five cement plants, two chinaware factories, a tile
factory, 33 textile mills and dozens of other enterprises.

   Air France, the French national carrier, says it

   Air France stopped its service to Tehran in March 1985 after
deciding the safety of its flights could not be assured, given the
political-military situation of the Iran-Iraq war.
   The airline announced Tuesday that it will schedule one flight a
week to Iran's capital, an Airbus A300 with first, business and

   Prior to March 1985, Air France offered two flights a week
between Paris and Tehran.

<TEXT>
   The former host of the Pennsylvania Lottery's
TV drawing who was convicted in a scheme to rig the game is making
a television comeback: as host of a bowling show.
   ``I was apprehensive. You could say I still am,'' Nick Perry
said. ``There's bound to be somebody out there dissatisfied with my
coming back.''
   Perry, 71, returned to television Tuesday night on ``BPA Jackpot
Bowling,'' a twice-nightly show on cable television in the
Pittsburgh area.
   Perry has taped 30 of 64 programs scheduled for an initial
13-week run.
   Perry was host of the nightly lottery telecast and an announcer
on a Pittsburgh TV station when the daily lottery number came up
666 on April 24, 1980. Perry and several other people were
convicted of rigging the drawing by putting weights in the pingpong
balls used to select the number.
   Perry served two years in prison and a year at a halfway house.
He now supervises couriers for a medical testing company in
suburban Ross Township.
   Perry still insists he is innocent.
   ``No one in my family and none of my close friends ever hit the
three sixes,'' he said. ``Why wouldn't I give it to them _ my
family, who could have used the money?''

<TEXT>
   The House is taking up a politically potent
anti-drug bill as Congress returns from vacation to face a long
list of troublesome issues made all the more contentious by
election campaign tensions.
   Among the issues that remain to be settled before lawmakers quit
to campaign for re-election are spending levels on Star Wars, arms
control issues, a major overhaul of the welfare system, competing
proposals on child care and aid to Nicaragua's Contra rebels.
   Many of those same issues are being debated by Republican George
Bush and Democrat Michael Dukakis in their contest for the
presidency. Their running mates, Sens. Dan Quayle, R-Ind., and
Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas, left the campaign trail _ at least for the
day _ to be on hand for the resumption of a congressional session
that broke in mid-August in advance of the Republican National
Convention.
   Both chambers were convening today for what was expected to be
the final congressional session of the year.
   Leaders of the Democratic-controlled Congress hope to finish
their work by Sept. 30 to permit members time to campaign for
re-election Nov. 8. All 435 House seats will be up for grabs along
with 33 of the 100 Senate positions.
   A post-election ``lame duck'' meeting is not considered likely.
   Heeding election-year polls showing voters are worried about
illegal drugs, both chambers are trying to come up with anti-drug
packages.
   The House bill on the floor today was written by Democrats with
an eye toward attracting Republican support.
   The bill would cost up to $2 billion a year, which would be in
addition to the $3.9 billion a year the federal government already
spends to fight drug abuse. The plan includes something for
everyone involved in fighting illegal drugs _ more money for
education, treatment and rehabilitation; more resources for state
and local law enforcement efforts to seize drugs on land, in the
air and on the seas.
   Legislators from both parties say the imminent election could
affect both rhetoric and votes in Congress.
   ``If the Republicans try to dream up some vote to try to
embarrass Sen. Bentsen, they have to be aware that whatever they do
could also catch Sen. Quayle,'' said Sen. David Pryor, D-Ark.
   For example, Democrats may push for votes on their legislation
to increase the minimum wage from $3.35 per hour to $4.55 hourly
over a three-year period, an increase opposed by President Reagan.
If it were sent to his desk, the president might be forced to
consider the political consequences that a veto would have on Bush.
   Pryor and Sen. Pete Domenici, R-N.M., ranking Republican on the
Senate Budget Committee, agreed that members are anxious to finish
work and return home to campaign.
   ``We have a lot of things still to be done, but people want to
finish up so there's going to be a strong push to get things
resolved and done,'' said Domenici.
   ``I think the presidential election will have some effect, but I
think the greater effect will be members' wish to get out and
campaign for their own elections,'' said Pryor.
   The Pentagon budget is likely to be the most contentious issue,
they said. Reagan vetoed Congress' first military budget bill last
month because he didn't like its arms control policy restrictions
or cuts in his proposed Star Wars budget.
   Another campaign issue, child care, is the subject of numerous
bills in both chambers. The fastest-moving bill is the
Democratic-backed $2.5 billion Act for Better Child Care Services
to provide an array of services for children and parents.
   Though Reagan and other conservatives oppose the measure,
Democrats have declined to compromise. Democratic leaders in both
chambers could bring the measure to a vote, setting up an
election-season confrontation with the White House.
   In addition, Congress has passed and Reagan has signed only two
of the 13 appropriation bills needed to pay for the federal
government when the new fiscal year begins Oct. 1. But the other 11
have been passed separately by each chamber and are now in
House-Senate conference committees to resolve differences.
   The Senate version of the military spending bill also includes a
Democratic-backed Contra aid proposal, which the House is likely to
approve with few changes. The current Contra aid package expires
Sept. 30. The new plan calls for $27 million in ``humanitarian''
aid _ food, clothing, and shelter _ and sets up procedures for a
subsequent vote on releasing $16.5 million in frozen military
supplies.
   If Reagan wants the military aid, House Speaker Jim Wright,
D-Texas, has vowed not to stand in the way of a floor vote.
   While Quayle will be among the conferees on the defense bill,
Bentsen is one of the House-Senate conferees who are working on a
major social issue _ welfare reform.
   The Reagan administration had expressed reservations about the
way the compromise was shaping up before the negotiators recessed
last month. But Dukakis has told Democratic lawmakers he wants them
to finish work this year.
   The reform effort centers on a greatly expanded work, education
and training program for welfare recipients. The biggest stumbling
block is a provision which requires some recipients to do community
work.
   The House is tentatively scheduled to vote on another social
issue Sept. 14 when it considers a family leave bill that
guarantees 10 weeks of unpaid, job-protected leave for new parents
employed by firms of 50 persons or more. The business community
strongly opposes the bill, contending it would make companies
noncompetitive and the government shouldn't mandate employee
benefits.

<HEAD>Judge Declares Marijuana OK for Medical Treatment</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES ROWLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Drug Enforcement Administration's chief
administrative law judge says marijuana should be legalized as a
prescription drug because smoking it helps cancer patients control
nausea after chemotherapy.
   Francis L. Young recommended reclassifying marijuana as a
Schedule II drug so that it could be prescribed by physicians to
treat the often severe nausea accompanying chemotherapy as well as
muscle spasms caused by multiple sclerosis.
   Young, whose findings are not binding on DEA's head, John Lawn,
acknowledged that ``strong emotions are aroused on both sides of
any discussion concerning the use of marijuana.''
   ``Nonetheless it is essential for this agency, and its
administrator, calmly and dispassionately to review the evidence of
record, correctly to apply the law, and act accordingly,'' he wrote
in an opinion released Tuesday.
   Young rejected as ``specious'' the argument that prescribing
marijuana cigarettes as a medicine ``will `send a signal' that
marijuana is OK generally for recreational use.''
   ``The fear of sending such a signal cannot be permitted to
override the legitimate need, amply demonstrated in this record, of
countless sufferers for the relief marijuana can provide when
prescribed by a physician in a legitimate case.''
   Young cited testimony by doctors and patients during 11 days of
hearings that marijuana was an accepted and effective treatment for
nausea among cancer patients and for multiple sclerosis, a
debilitating and crippling neurological disease.
   The hearings were ordered in 1980 by the U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals here, which chastised DEA for ignoring its statutory
obligation to consider evidence that marijuana might have some
medical benefit.
   The appellate court had twice previously overruled DEA's
rejection of petitions, first filed in 1972, by the National
Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws (NORML).
   The group's attorney, Kevin B. Zeese, vowed to take the case
back to the court if Lawn or his successor rejects Young's
recommendation.
   DEA has historically opposed moving marijuana from the list of
Schedule I drugs, which includes heroin, PCP and LSD, to Schedule
II.
   DEA spokesman Cornelius Dougherty said Lawn ``won't have any
comment until he has had a chance to look at'' Young's 68-page
opinion.
   Dougherty said Lawn could opt to hold further hearings before
making a final decision.
   Zeese hailed Young's decision, saying it marks ``the first time
there has ever been an unbiased hearing on whether or not marijuana
is safe for use under medical supervision.''
   ``It's a very important step in the process,'' Zeese said.
   Even if DEA upholds Young's findings, the Food and Drug
Administration and state regulatory agencies would have to pass
judgment before marijuana were made available as a drug.
   Young determined that smoking marijuana was more effective at
controlling nausea from chemotherapy than capsules that contain the
synthetic THC, the chemically active ingredient of cannabis.
   When smoked, ``natural marijuana is inhaled and generally takes
effect more quickly than the synthetic capsule which is ingested
and must be processed through the digestive system before it takes
effect,'' Young said.
   He also cited a seven-year experiment by at least 10 hospitals
in New Mexico that showed marijuana cigarettes were ``highly
effective'' in controlling nausea after chemotherapy. The
cigarettes were supplied by the federal government under
regulations that allow medical research.
   Efforts by Louisiana at making marijuana a prescription drug for
cancer patients were frustrated by the insistence of federal
authorities that it would only be made available as part of a
research project, Young said.
   Few doctors were willing to file the required paperwork to
participate under those conditions, he said.
   Young also rejected DEA contentions that marijuana was not
proven a safe drug, saying: ``by any measure of rational analysis,
marijuana can be safely used within a supervised routine of medical
care.''
   ``Marijuana can be harmful. Marijuana is abused. But the same is
true of dozens of drugs or substances which are listed in Schedule
II so that they can be employed in treatment by physicians in
proper cases, despite their abuse potential,'' he said.
   In the case of multiple sclerosis, there are few drugs to treat
muscle spasms and they often cause serious side effects, Young said.
   Marijuana was also found to be an accepted and effective
treatment of painful bone spurs caused by pseudo hypoparathyroidism.
   Young said there was insufficient evidence that a ``respectable
minority of physicians'' had accepted marijuana as a treatment for
glaucoma, a degenerative optic-nerve disease that slowly causes
blindness.
   But he did note that ``two highly qualified and experienced
ophthalmologists'' accepted marijuana's medical value for treating
the disease.
   As with multiple sclerosis, there are only a limited number of
other drugs to treat glaucoma, and they can cause serious side
effects, Young said.

<HEAD>High-Tech Won't Necessarily Replace Lost Smokestack Jobs, Report
Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARTIN CRUTSINGER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A study released today challenges the notion
that America will be able to replace millions of jobs lost in
fading smokestack industries with new jobs in emerging
high-technology fields.
   The Council on Competitiveness said the United States has lost
its once-commanding lead in many high-tech industries. It said that
only a concerted effort by government, industry and the nation's
schools can reverse the trend.
   ``In field after field, from combustion engineering to consumer
electronics, from machine tools to the integrated circuit, foreign
competitors have moved into markets pioneered and once dominated by
American firms,'' the report said. ``Often, their success was built
on exploiting inventions made in American laboratories by American
scientists.''
   The report said other countries such as Japan have done a much
better job of bringing new technology to the marketplace quickly.
   Unless this trend is reversed, the study warned, the United
States will suffer further deterioration in its trade deficits and
a declining standard of living.
   ``Technology is essential to America's competitiveness, the
driving force behind increased productivity, export growth and a
rising standard of living,'' said John Young, chairman of the
council and president of Hewlett-Packard Co..
   In releasing the report, Young said he wanted to challenge the
comforting illusion that ``the sunrise industries of high
technology are the wave of the future _ the economic panacea we all
need.''
   ``In 1987, our trade deficit with Japan in electronics was
almost as large as it was for automobiles. So Silicon Valley is not
so far removed from Detroit,'' he said.
   The report cited these developments:
   _American companies' share of the U.S. domestic market has
shrunk dramatically in many high-technology fields. Between 1970
and 1987, U.S. manufacturing companies' share of the American
market in phonographs fell from 90 percent to 1 percent, in color
televisions from 90 percent to 10 percent, in machine tools from
100 percent to 35 percent and in telephones from 99 percent to 25
percent.
   _America's trade surplus in high-technology products has
declined precipitously during the 1980s and was actually in deficit
for the first time in 1986.
   _Foreign inventors captured 47 percent of U.S. patents in 1987,
up from 35 percent in 1975 with Japanese inventors holding key
patents in an increasing number of fields.
   _By 1986, Japan had captured 65 percent of the world market in
computer chips. The United States had less than 30 percent.
   _America could face a shortfall of 500,000 scientists and
engineers by the year 2010, due to retirements and a declining
number of students choosing careers in science and engineering.
   Bobby Inman, a member of the council and the chairman of
Westmark Systems Inc., said that in global competition, the key to
success in developing new technology for the marketplace is speed
and teamwork.
   ``We've been too slow, too fragmented, too uncoordinated and too
adversarial,'' he said.
   The report said U.S. companies face an uphill struggle in global
markets unless the federal government improves the machinery for
making national technology policy.
   The report called on the next president to give his national
science adviser Cabinet rank with the power to coordinate all
government policies relating to research and development.
   The federal government operates more than 700 research
laboratories with an annual budget of $20 billion, close to
one-third of the government's annual spending for research and
development.
   But the report said there is no consensus on the projects these
labs should be pursuing and coordination is so lax that it is
difficult to determine just how many labs there are or what
projects they are pursuing.
   The report said investment in education, equipment and
facilities should be made a top federal priority. It estimated that
$10 billion would be needed over the next 10 years to restore U.S.
university research facilities.
   The government also should promote faculty development programs
as a way of filling an estimated 1,300 to 1,800 vacant engineering
positions at U.S. universities, the council said.
   The council also called for tax credits to companies for
research and development, regulatory reform to speed the commercial
application of new technology and reduction of the federal budget
deficit as a way of lowering the cost of capital to U.S. businesses.
   ``The primary challenge for policy makers is to create a new
policy framework appropriate for today's competitive environment,''
Young said. ``We can no longer afford to view the commercial
application of technology as a second-rate priority.''
   The council, founded in 1986, is composed of 151 chief
executives from industry, organized labor and higher education. It
has issued a series of reports aimed at improving the ability of
American companies to compete in world markets.

   Typical scenes from what is already the most star spangled

judgment that Americans are in the mood for another dose of
patriotism, the sort of stuff Ronald Reagan promoted in two
landslide election victories.
   But flag-waving also is the refuge of candidates who would
rather not spell out how they plan to balance the budget or create
millions of new, well-paying jobs.
   Flag-waving isn't limited to creating a sea of color for the
evening television news shows.
   ``Read my lips,'' says Republican Bush. ``No new taxes.''
Rhetorical flag-waving.
   ``Good jobs at good wages,'' says Democrat Dukakis, waving his
favorite rhetorical flag.
   Weighing in on Tuesday was the president, an old master at this
kind of campaigning.
   ``After eight hard years of rebuilding America's strength, do we
really want to return to a Disneyland defense policy?'' the
president asked the American Legion.
   He ticked off the defense systems he claimed Dukakis opposes,
including the Trident missile and the Stealth bomber, both of which
the Massachusetts governor supports.
   On the question of a federal budget awash in record amounts of
red ink, both candidates talk about the need to reduce the
deficits, but they aren't saying how they'd do it.
   The flexible freeze proposed by Bush is derided by Dukakis as
``son of voodoo economics,'' the memorable phrase Bush once used _
and now wishes he hadn't _ to describe Reagan's economic policies.
   But Dukakis' own plan for cutting the deficit is based on
unspecified cuts and his determination to collect up to $100
billion in unpaid income taxes.
   Helping the homeless, the elderly, providing better schools and
health care, rebuilding the nation's roads and bridges, restoring
the competitive edge to American industry, cleaning up the
environment, all these are widely accepted goals to be reached
through the vaguest of proposals.
   Everybody is for cooperation, bringing together government,
business and labor.
   With new taxes a forbidden topic and budget deficits remaining
at record levels, neither Bush nor Dukakis wants to commit himself
to specific proposals with price tags the nation can't afford.
   So, instead they tout their leadership abilities, a pitch that
assumes the main task is to convince voters that the candidate will
make the right decisions, whatever they may turn out to be.
   Dukakis talks about his 10 years as governor of Massachusetts
and describes himself as a tightfisted manager whose hallmark is
competence.
   Bush holds up his impressive resume and says he was at Reagan's
side when interest rates, inflation and unemployment declined from
the levels of the final year of Democrat Jimmy Carter's presidency.
   But nothing waves quite so impressively as the flag.
   Republican vice presidential nominee Dan Quayle stood at the
base of the Statue of Liberty on Labor Day to denounce ``the
mindset that would impede the daily recitation of the Pledge of
Allegiance.''
   He was offering a version of what has become the most frequently
heard Republican thrust of this campaign _ that Dukakis vetoed
legislation that would have required Massachusetts public school
teachers to lead pupils in the daily recitation of the Pledge of
Allegiance.
   Dukakis vetoed the measure after receiving a state Supreme Court
opinion that said it was unconstitutional.
   ``Should public school teachers be required to lead our children
in the Pledge of Allegiance?'' asked Bush in his speech to the GOP
convention. ``My opponent says no _ but I say yes.''
   Of course, the vice president was not proposing federal
legislation to require any such thing. That would violate
Republican beliefs in states' rights, not to mention the
Constitution.
   To counter any suggestion that he's lacking in patriotism,
Dukakis campaigns surrounded by flags of all sizes, huge ones for a
backdrop, small ones passed out to the audience.
   His rallies are often conducted to the heavy beat of Neil
Diamond singing, ``Coming to America.'' His appearance on Ellis
Island, the first stop in America of his mother when she came from
Greece 75 years ago, ended with a solo trumpet rendition of
``America the Beautiful.''
   By now, the voters ought to be convinced that both presidential
candidates are patriots who love their country and revere its flag,
convinced and ready to hear how the contenders plan to deal with
national problems.

<HEAD>Rice Remains `Symbol of Japanese Protectionism'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The recent U.S. agreement with Japan on beef
and citrus was hailed as a major step toward improved trade
relations, but an Agriculture Department economist says rice
remains ``a symbol of Japanese protectionism.''
   Although the United States continues to press Japan to open its
rice market to imports, only a small quantity can come in for use
in alcohol or confectionery products, says Lois A. Caplan of the
department's Economic Research Service. Returning travelers also
are allowed to bring in small amounts.
   The United States for years has been after Japan to liberalize
its import policies so more American products can flow into the
Japanese market. Japan is the U.S. farmer's largest foreign market,
but officials say freer trade would open the door even wider.
   After months of negotiations, the United States and Japan signed
a pact on July 5 which gradually widens access to the Japanese
market by 1991. However, Japan adamantly refused to budge on the
question of rice.
   Although Japanese consumers pay more than twice as much for rice
as Americans do, sentiment is strong in Japan to protect the
nation's rice farmers.
   In September 1986, the Rice Millers' Association, a private U.S.
trade group, filed a complaint against Japan under section 301 of
the 1974 Trade Act, charging that Japan's virtual ban on rice
imports constituted unfair trade practices.
   ``The U.S. government decided not to pursue the 301 action
against Japan but urged Japan to discuss its rice policy in the
current round of global trade negotiations,'' Caplan said. ``Japan
has agreed to consultations under the new round but has repeatedly
refused to have bilateral discussions with the United States.''
   Caplan, whose analysis is in a report about U.S. trade with
Pacific Rim countries, said rice is a ``very sensitive issue'' in
Japan because it is a staple food and is important in many Japanese
traditions.
   ``Many older Japanese have bitter memories of hunger during and
immediately after the Second World War, and still have ties to the
farming community,'' she said. ``The Japanese government and the
LDP (Liberal Democratic Party), which derives much of its support
from farmers, have steadfastly rejected demands to liberalize the
rice market and have promised to maintain the present policy of
self-sufficiency in rice.''
   In most of the last two decades, Japan has produced more rice
than it has consumed, leading to periods of burdensome surpluses.
The unneeded rice inventories were reduced by subsidizing exports,
using rice in livestock feed, or by limiting production.
   The criticism of Japan's restrictive rice policies and strong
pressure by its foreign trading partners have started
``unprecedented debate in Japan over its agricultural policy,
including import restrictions,'' Caplan said.
   Consequently, he said, the discussion and social changes taking
place in Japan ``are likely to make it politically feasible for
Japan to move toward freer market access for agricultural imports''
down the road.
   ``Changes include an aging population with fading memories of
World War II food shortages, a decline in the political influence
of farm groups, and an increasing awareness of the high cost of
domestic agricultural products compared with overseas prices,''
Caplan said.

   Grants totaling $2 million are being awarded
by the Agriculture Department to 18 predominantly black land-grant
colleges and universities.
   Deputy Secretary Peter C. Myers said Tuesday the grants will
help the schools upgrade instructional programs in agriculture,
strengthen faculty, and recruit and retain minority students in the
fields of agriculture and food sciences.
   The grants will be administered by the department's Office of
Minority Research and Teaching Programs, which primarily serves the
interests of colleges and universities authorized under an 1890
federal law, the Second Morrill Act.
   Officials said the grants, minus administrative costs, will
provide each of the recipients a total of $102,496.
   The schools are:
   Alabama A&M University, Huntsville.
   Alcorn State University, Lorman, Miss.
   University of Arkansas-Pine Bluff.
   Delaware State College, Dover.

   The Soviet Union has bought more U.S. corn for
delivery during the current marketing year, the Agriculture
Department says.
   Officials said Tuesday that an additional 802,400 metric tons of
U.S. corn have been sold by private exporters for delivery during
the 1988-89 marketing year which began on Sept. 1.
   More than 1.7 million tons of corn have been sold to the Soviets
in the last week, according to USDA announcements.
   A metric ton is about 2,205 pounds and is equal to 39.4 bushels
of corn or 36.7 bushels of wheat or soybeans. The 802,400 tons of
corn would be about 31.6 million bushels.
   Corn prices have been averaging about $2.68 per bushel at the
farm level, according to USDA estimates, meaning that the new sale
could have a farm value of around $84.7 million.
   No indication was given whether the recent new corn sales would
count under the current long-term grain supply agreement with the
Soviet Union or be carried forward separately in case a new pact is
forthcoming.
   The current five-year pact is set to expire Sept. 30 and
negotiators are trying to work out a new one, or at least an
extension of the current agreement, to take effect on Oct. 1.

<HEAD>Woman Fights for Bible British Troops Took During 1778 Raid</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FAIRHAVEN, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A 63-year-old woman is waging a
single-handed campaign to retrieve a Bible signed by George
Washington that was seized by the British during the Revolutionary
War.
   ``They stole it,'' said Alice West Clark of Fairhaven. ``This
Bible belongs in this country and it belongs to my family.''
   The Washington Masonic Bible was seized by the Duke of
Cornwall's Light Infantry during the raid on Old Dartmouth village.
It now is a prized possession of the Light Infantry museum in
England.
   Clark said that when the British were marching through what is
now Acushnet and North Fairhaven on Sept. 6, 1778, they set fire to
the home of Bartholomew West, an 80-year-old invalid. West was
saved by neighbors and the Redcoats moved on after taking the
family Bible.
   Clark, who is uncertain whether she is related to the original
Wests but whose lineage stretches back to that era, told the
Standard-Times of New Bedford that the Bible was printed in 1712,
is covered with Masonic symbols and contains records of the West
family. It was signed by Washington when he received a Masonic
degree.
   Clark said she was informed by letter from a U.S. embassy
official in Britain that the museum authorities have sought legal
advice to ensure that the Bible can remain in British hands as
spoils of war.

<HEAD>Forest Service May Have To Raid Trust Fund To Pay For Firefighting</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. Forest Service says it may be forced
for the second straight year to raid a reforestation trust fund to
pay its fast-mounting firefighting bill.
   The Forest Service already has spent $190 million this year on
firefighting, and the Western fire season is just entering its
traditional peak month.
   An Interior Department appropriations bill now pending in
Congress includes $125 million for firefighting and Rep. Peter
DeFazio, D-Ore., said Tuesday that most of it will be used to repay
the Knutsen-Vanderberg trust fund from last year's borrowings.
   The Forest Service spent $265 million in 1987 to fight Western
fires, most of which struck in late August and September.
   While Congress has traditionally bailed out the Forest Service,
DeFazio said ``smoke and mirrors'' budgeting could eventually leave
the trust fund short of money.
   A Forest Service budget official said no decision has been made
on whether to borrow from the Knutsen-Vanderberg trust fund.
   ``It's a possibility,'' said Robert Gordon, an assistant
director of the agency.
   He said the fund typically has about $400 million in it and the
programs it finances generally cost about $200 million a year.
Money from the fund comes from fees timber operators pay when they
log national forests and is earmarked for reforestation projects.
   ``It will eventually catch up with you if you don't replenish
it, but I think we will be all right this year,'' Gordon said.

<HEAD>Number of Hispanics Up By One-Third This Decade</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The number of Hispanics has grown by more than
one-third since 1980 and now represents 8.1 percent of the nation's
population, the Census Bureau says.
   In a report issued Tuesday, the bureau also said the rate of
Hispanic growth is nearly five times that for the rest of the
population, and more than half of all Hispanics in this country
live in just two states: California and Texas.
   The bureau estimated there were 19.4 million Americans of
Hispanic background as of last March. That is 34 percent more than
the 14.5 million people who listed themselves as Hispanics in the
1980 census.
   The nation's non-Hispanic population increased by about 7
percent in the same period.
   About half the Hispanic increase was a result of immigration and
half resulted from birth rates exceeding death rates.
   While people of Spanish ancestry made up a growing share of the
nation's residents, they are extremely concentrated geographically,
the bureau found. About one-third, 33.9 percent, live in
California, and 21.3 percent live in Texas, meaning those two
states account for well over half of all Hispanics in the United
States.
   The study did not estimate the Hispanic population of every
state, but it said that nearly 90 percent live in just nine states.
   Those are California, 6.6 million; Texas, 4.1 million; New York,
2.1 million; Florida, 1.5 million; Illinois, 801,000; Arizona,
648,000; New Jersey, 646,000; New Mexico, 543,000, and Colorado,
368,000.
   Other findings of the report include:
   _The unemployment rate among Hispanics was 8.5 percent, compared
with 5.8 percent for non-Hispanics.
   _People of Mexican heritage were the largest Hispanic group at
12.1 million. They were followed by Puerto Ricans living on the
U.S. mainland, 2.5 million; Central and South Americans, 2.2
million; and Cubans, 1 million.
   _The proportion of Hispanic families anchored by a married
couple was 70 percent, down from 74 percent when it was last
measured in 1982. At the same time, the share of families headed by
a woman with no spouse present increased from 26 percent to 30
percent.
   _More than half (51 percent) of Hispanics have completed high
school, and 10 percent have completed four years of college. That
still trails non-Hispanics, of whom 78 percent are high school
graduates and 21 percent have finished college.

<HEAD>Jackson Denies Anger Over Being Excluded From Illinois Meeting</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Jesse Jackson says he is eager to get on with
his role in the fall Democratic campaign although he was excluded
from a meeting between presidential nominee Michael Dukakis and
Democratic leaders in his home state of Illinois.
   Dukakis met in Illinois on Tuesday with elected leaders and
fund-raisers, including Sen. Paul Simon, Rep. Dan Rostenkowski,
other members of Congress and other elected officials. Though at
home in Chicago, Jackson was not invited.
   Dukakis spokesman Leslie Dach said the reason was that Jackson
is a national leader and the meeting in Illinois was focusing on
the Dukakis state strategy and organization.
   ``I didn't know anything about it other than the press
inquiries,'' Jackson said in a telephone interview from Chicago.
``So I have no comment to make.''
   Sources said Jackson was angered by the exclusion, and one
associate, speaking on condition of anonymity, described him as
``seething.'' But Jackson said he was neither hurt nor angry.
   ``I just hate for people to be allowed to put words in my mouth
or give some adjective description of what my emotions are,'' he
said. ``I'm working. I'm hopeful. I'm registering voters.''
   He said he had spoken Monday night and Tuesday morning to
Dukakis vice chairman John Sasso. The two are to meet Thursday to
discuss the future of the campaign.
   Jackson said that ``areas dealing with campaign direction and
priorities still have to be worked out.'' He said he hoped to
discuss his ongoing voter registration efforts with the campaign.
And he said he hoped to discuss targeting the message of the
Democratic ticket to Teamsters, working women, family farmers and
others who ``need to be Democrats.''
   Asked if he would get a schedule of campaign appearances at this
meeting, Jackson said, ``I certainly hope so.''
   Asked if he feels Dukakis has been slow to involve him in the
campaign, Jackson said, ``There are some decisions the campaign has
to make about how it will employ its volunteers,'' including people
like New York Gov. Mario Cuomo, Sen. Edward Kennedy of
Massachusetts and himself.
   ``I assume that's the kind of thing Sasso will be doing,'' he
said referring to Dukakis' close confidant, who has just returned
to the campaign.
   ``The plans are incomplete,'' he said. ``I hope they will be
complete soon ... I hope before this week is out that all of the
remaining areas will be resolved and we'll be on our way.''
   Dach said the meeting with Sasso will include discussion of
``how we can best work together, places, details, themes.'' But he
also indicated the campaign sees the meeting as involving
``evolving issues that need to be addressed and refined.''
   Jackson has declined to criticize Dukakis, despite some
incidents that some Jackson supporters have perceived as slights.
   The most recent involved reports that the Dukakis camp had
conducted polling that found Jackson had high negatives in some
states where he beat Dukakis in the primaries and that the Dukakis
officials said they did not want Jackson campaigning in those
states.
   While these reports came from sources close to Jackson and the
national Democratic Party, Jackson himself said he had received no
such direction.
   ``I don't have anything in writing on that,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   President Reagan is campaigning against the
Carter administration and the news media as he attempts to convince
voters that he has put America's defense policy on the right track
and the Democrats would derail it.
   The president jumped into the post-Labor Day election fray
Tuesday as he ended a three-week California vacation and returned
to the White House, where he planned a meeting with Republican
congressional leaders today.
   ``It will be a meeting to map strategy and to get reports from
the leaders on what they found out from their constituents during
the recess,'' White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater told reporters
aboard Air Force One.
   The congressional recess coincided with Reagan's vacation, which
was spent mainly at his ranch north of Santa Barbara, with a
five-day interval in Los Angeles.
   On his way back to Washington, Reagan stopped in Louisville,
Ky., to address the American Legion's 70th national convention,
asking, ``After eight hard years of rebuilding America's strength,
do we really want to return to a Disneyland defense policy?''
   Deriding the policies of the president from whom he wrested the
White House in 1980, Reagan said: ``An administration from the
party of Franklin Roosevelt, Harry Truman and John Kennedy had,
incredibly, lost faith in the place of America, the role for good
that America played, the moral mission of America in the world.''
   Reagan also reminded the Legionnaires of something he said when
he addressed their convention during his 1980 campaign: ``Once we
have the (military) programs to reverse the trends now in favor of
the Soviet Union, we must strive for arms limitation agreements
that will further that security _ including significant arms
reductions _ so long as they are equitable and based on strict
reciprocity.
   ``Actually, I didn't read that for your benefit, but for the
benefit of my gang on the (press) platform back there,'' he told
the audience at Louisville's Commonwealth Convention Center.
   ``They keep saying that the INF agreement I signed with Mr.
Gorbachev _ the first significant, equitable and reciprocal
reduction of U.S. and Soviet nuclear missiles in history shows how
I've grown in my job. But I'm waiting for them to acknowledge the
simple truth of what I've been saying for eight years about
strength being the only road to peace.''
   Reagan also touched on some of the legislative issues facing him
as he headed back to Washington with 4{ months remaining in his
term.
   ``Earlier this year, the majority in Congress turned a deaf ear
to our pleas, and to those in Central America who hunger for the
freedoms we in the United States take for granted,'' he said. ``We
hope that with your help we might still convince this Congress to
do what's right.''
   The Senate has passed a bill, which the administration describes
as minimally acceptable, to resume assistance to rebels fighting
the leftist government of Nicaragua. The House has not acted.
   The president also said that ``before I leave office I want to
be sure that we have a Cabinet-level Department of Veterans
Affairs.'' A bill to upgrade the status of the Veterans
Administration has passed the Senate and awaits House action.
   Much of the speech was devoted to denunciation of the previous
Democratic administration and of the Democrats now seeking to
regain the White House.
   Reagan at one point claimed that Democratic nominee Michael
Dukakis wants to scrap the Trident missile and the Stealth bomber.
Dukakis actually favors both.

<TEXT>
   The government has committed $3.6 million in
emergency assistance for flood-plagued Bangladesh, and a private
U.S. group says it will provide another $4 million for medicine and
food.
   The Agency for International Development's office of foreign
disaster assistance said Tuesday that the government assistance
will include 10,000 tons of food and more than 2,000 tons of corn
and wheat seed. U.S. disaster management experts also will be sent
to Dhaka to help assess the situation and advise on further
assistance, the agency said.
   Oxfam America, a private humanitarian organization, also
announced its relief program on Tuesday.
   ``Of the 500 deaths that have been reported officially, many
were caused by consuming contaminated food and drinking water, and
as a result of snakebites,'' Oxfam said in a statement from its
Boston headquarters.
   ``The greatest medical need is for water purification tablets,
which we are attempting to secure in large quantities and deliver
as quickly as humanly possible.''
   The organization said experts fear that ``because most roads and
highways have been out ... thousands of families will starve to
death unless supplies reach them soon.''
   Oxfam blamed the second consecutive year of major floods in
Bangladesh on massive destruction of trees in northern India and
China, allowing water to pour unchecked into the deltas of
Bangladesh.
   ``The deforestation of the region has stripped away many of the
natural barriers that protect against the waters of the Ganges
River and the melted snows of the Himalayas,'' the organization
said.
   Oxfam said it is concerned that ``many more deaths will occur in
Bangladesh in the years to come with continued inattention to this
problem.''

   Interest rates on short-term Treasury

   The Treasury Department sold $7 billion in three-month bills

average discount rate of 7.4 percent, down from 7.5 percent last

highest since they sold for 7.3 percent on Aug. 5, 1985. The
decline in six-month bills put them at their lowest level since
they averaged 7.26 percent on Aug. 8.
   The new discount rates understate the actual return to investors
_ 7.5 percent for three-month bills with a $10,000 bill selling for
$9,816.50 and and 7.79 percent for six-month bills selling for
$9,625.90.
   In a separate report, the Federal Reserve said Tuesday that the
average yield for one-year Treasury bills, the most popular index
for making changes in adjustable rate home mortgages, fell to 8.24
percent last week after averaging 8.28 percent the week before.

   Rock music fans traveled from
throughout the Soviet bloc to hear Bruce Springsteen, Peter Gabriel
and other stars sing for human rights on the third stop of Amnesty
International's global rock tour.
   The concert Tuesday opened to a sell-out crowd of 80,000,
including senior communist officials.
   It was a rare event in Eastern Europe.
   Individual Western rock groups have been allowed to play in
Communist European capitals, but this was believed to be the first

   The Budapest concert also was unusual because it was sponsored
by a Western human rights organization. The West has often accused
East bloc countries of violating human rights commitments.
   The state news agency MTI reported that ``chief patron'' of the
concert was Hungarian top ideologist Janos Berecz, a Politburo
member. It said Soviet government spokesman Gennady Gerasimov also
was present, as was Interior Minister Istvan Horvath.
   One source said Premier and Communist leader Karoly Grosz was
also seen at the Nep Stadium, as were Soviet diplomats.
   The tour, which began in London Friday, then took the stars to
Paris, is marking the 40th anniversary of the U.N. Universal
Declaration on Human Rights. It will include 20 cities on five
continents.
   The performers include Britain's Sting, American folk singer
Tracy Chapman and Senegal's Youssou N'dour.
   Gabriel told reporters that negotiations still were under way to
take the tour to Moscow and that the performers hoped it could be
arranged.
   During a break in the concert, Berecz was quoted by MTI as
saying that ``there is no need to be afraid of human rights issues,
but persistent efforts are needed for them to be accomplished and
to prevail to the full extent.''
   Berecz was also reported as saying that there was ``no
obstacle'' to cooperation with Amnesty International since the
organization is assessing countries not according to their social
systems but on the basis of their human rights record.
   Hungary has taken the unprecedented step recently of accusing an
allied country of human rights abuses. Budapest maintains that
neighboring Romania is pursuing discriminatory policies that harm
the culture and tradition of about 1.7 million ethnic Hungarians
who live there.
   Ian Martin, secretary-general of Amnesty International, visited
Budapest last week for brief talks with Horvath and with Gyula
Horn, the state secretary for foreign affairs.
   Thousands of Austrians went by special train to Budapest for
Tuesday's event with a special package deal costing $45. Fans from
Czechoslovakia, East Germany and Poland were also in town for the
performance.
   Hungarians paid a maximum $6 for tickets.
   Audiences at each stop on the tour receive a personal ``passport
to human rights,'' a pocket-size replica of the Universal
Declaration of Human Rights.

   Sonny the elephant was coaxed home with a
trail of food after he climbed out of his pen, ripped out an
electrical wire designed to keep him enclosed and walked through a
chain-link fence.
   ``Most people think that elephants can't climb, but he can,''
city parks and recreation director Ash Grandy said Tuesday.
   The elephant was found Monday wandering in a vacant enclosure
next to his pen at Hillcrest Park Zoo.
   Using the lure of food ``was sort of like leading a donkey with
a carrot tied to the end of a stick,'' Grandy said.
   Sonny has been awaiting shipment to a new home at the Popcorn
Park Zoo near Newark, N.J., where he will be surrounded by a moat.
Zoo officials here decided to get rid of him because he has become
too large.

   The grave of William Butler Yeats in western
Ireland, where the great Irish poet was buried in a state funeral
in 1948, probably doesn't contain his remains, a researcher says.
   The tomb in Drumcliffe, County Sligo, says Diana Souhami, more
likely contains the remains of anonymous Frenchmen with whom Yeats
shared a pauper's grave before being brought to Ireland for
reburial.
   Ms. Souhami's conclusions, which met with disbelief among some
keepers of Yeats' memory, are based on letters of Yeats' friend,
the painter Hannah Gluck. Ms. Souhami read the letters while
writing a biography of Ms. Gluck.
   Yeats died in France in 1939 after stipulating he wanted to be
buried at Drumcliffe. He had even written his own epitaph, now
inscribed on the gravestone seen by thousands of visitors annually:
   ``Cast a cold eye
   ``On life, on death
   ``Horseman, pass by.''
   Yeats scholar John Kelly was quoted by The Daily Telegraph on
Tuesday as saying Ms. Souhami's findings, if true, represented ``a
very cruel irony.''
   But Canon Pat Wood, president of the Yeats Society in Sligo,
said in a telephone interview: ``It's an old, old story and I don't
believe it.''
   He said Anne Saddlemyer, author of a biography of Yeats' wife
Georgie, examined the controversy and concluded the remains at
Drumcliffe were the poet's.
   Ms. Saddlemyer lives in Toronto and her telephone was not
answered Tuesday. Yeats' son Michael, who lives in Dublin, also did
not answer telephone calls.
   Ms. Souhami said in an interview that from letters she found
among Ms. Gluck's papers, it appeared that Georgie had Yeats buried
in a cemetery in Roquebrune, southern France, believing the grave
would be left intact for 10 years.
   In fact, perhaps unwittingly, she had bought a pauper's grave in
which Yeats was buried with four or five others. This grave was
cleared in 1946 and the bones placed in a common ossuary, a
receptacle for bones of deceased people, Ms. Souhami said.
   ``Why she chose the communal grave isn't clear,'' she said.
``Perhaps she thought she had a 10-year concession. What is certain
is that she didn't, and it's certain that it was all cleared out in
1946.''
   In 1947 Ms. Gluck and the journalist Edith Heald visited the
site and were shocked to find no trace of Yeats' grave, she said.
Ms. Gluck then contacted Yeats' friend Edmund Dulac, who wrote to
the priest at the graveyard asking whether Yeats' remains could be
dug up and identified.
   Ms. Souhami said she found among Ms. Gluck's papers a letter to
Dulac from the priest, a man identified only as Biancheri, which
said: ``Is it possible to find the bones of the poet Yeats in the
ossuary? Yes! If we empty the entire contents of the ossuary, and
if we have details of distinctive characteristics which will enable
us to reconstruct the skeleton after painstaking research carried
under the direction of a medical expert...''
   Yeats' purported remains were exhumed and shipped to Ireland
just one month later _ much too soon to enable the bones to be
identified under the terms described by Biancheri, said Ms. Souhami.

   A huge fire Tuesday prompted an
evacuation order for the Old Faithful tourist complex at
Yellowstone National Park, and a wall of flames moved to within 600
yards of the town of Silver Gate and threatened Cooke City.
   The 500 to 600 visitors and non-essential employees near the
park's most popular attraction would be asked to leave by 9 a.m.
MDT Wednesday for safety reasons and to allow firefighters the
access they need to protect structures, said Yellowstone
spokeswoman Joan Anzelmo.
   ``This is not a panic at all,'' she said. ``This will be a slow,
orderly closure and evacuation as (closures) have been in different
locations throughout the summer.''
   Gusts 30 mph pushed the main body of the 144,000-acre North Fork
blaze to within 1{ miles of the complex Tuesday evening and carried
embers to within three-quarters of a mile of the area, where they
sparked spot fires.
   To the north, flames surged out of the northeast corner of
Yellowstone within 600 yards of the tourist community of Silver
Gate but moving eastward on a collision course with the larger
community of Cooke City, three miles away.
   Officials said the flames passed to the north of Silver Gate
along a hillside without damaging buildings. But the community
remained endangered and the situation appeared to be worsening as
the flames moved east.
   The sheet of flame was barely 600 feet from downtown Silver Gate
as it paralleled the community, spreading one mile to the east
within an hour, officials said.
   Observers said the fire billowed hundreds of feet into the air
through a cloud of spewing embers that were doused by firefighters
as they landed on buildings.
   Earlier, the fire forced hundreds of firefighters to retreat to
new positions in what was called a last-ditch effort to keep the
flames from overrunning the community.
   Fire officials were pessimistic about holding back the
unpredictable 61,300-acre Storm Creek fire, only 1{ miles west of
Silver Gate, the first town in the fire's path.
   ``We're going to make every effort we can to save every
structure and every home in these communities,'' said Mike Warren,
branch commander of the firefighting effort.
   Hundreds of firefighters retreated Tuesday, fearing for their
safety. ``Too hot!'' yelled one. However, more experienced
firefighters remained to extinguish hot spots and wet down trees.
   Tuesday night, flames leaped from tree to tree a few hundred
yards from Silver Gate after a spot fire flared on a nearby
hillside. Firefighters splashed buildings with water in a
last-ditch effort to save the community.
   The spot fire was estimated at 20 acres and growing fast.
   Earlier Tuesday, authorities went door to door to order
evacuations of Cooke City.
   Gov. Ted Schwinden and federal authorities Tuesday imposed a ban
on all outdoor recreation outside Montana's cities and towns to
lessen the fire danger.
   ``We could face a very, very dangerous day or day and a half,''
Schwinden told reporters. ``When you count up the score, Mother
Nature is way ahead.''
   Thirteen major fires have burned roughly 1 million acres in
Yellowstone and the surrounding national forests in Wyoming,
Montana and Idaho. Inside the 2.2 million-acre park, 633,725 acres
are charred.
   Elsewhere, a fire in parched grass and pine in central
Washington exploded overnight from just 160 acres Monday to more
than 25,000 acres Tuesday, sending firefighters fleeing and
overrunning at least one bulldozer that could not move fast enough,
state officials said. It burned toward some of the state's prime
fruit orchards.
   Forests and grassland also burned in California, Oregon and Utah.
   The Boise Interagency Fire Center, the coordinating office for
firefighting in the West, says fires so far this year have charred
3.65 million acres, an area larger than Connecticut, which is 3.2
million acres. But slightly more than 2 million of the acres are in
Alaska. During the last big fire season, 1985, 2.8 million acres
burned, including Alaska.
   The fire center has called this the worst fire season in 30
years, but without giving a specific year or acreage.
   The U.S. Forest Service said Tuesday it has spent $190 million
battling this summer's blazes. Last year, the Forest Service spent
$265 million to fight fires through September.
   The National Weather Service said any relief is still five days
away. Long-range weather maps show a low pressure system dropping
into the Pacific Northwest from the Gulf of Alaska by Sunday, which
could bring rain to Montana and snow in the state's western
mountains.
   But until then, the weather service said, Montana can expect
relatively strong wind.
   Park County commissioners declared an emergency and directed
sheriff's deputies to forcibly remove people from Silver Gate and
Cooke City. Deputies remained behind to protect property from
looting.
   Silver Gate was encircled by firebreaks Monday about a half-mile
away and work continued Tuesday on strenghtening the fire break
around Cooke City.
   About 75 fire trucks were stationed in the two towns, some from
as far away as New York and California. The trucks were manned by
250 firefighters to protect buildings, in addition to 1,200
firefighters battling the fire itself.
   Inside Yellowstone, crews battled to defend the stores, lodges
and cabins around Old Faithful geyser from the North Fork fire,
which was } mile away.
   ``It's a very defensible area,'' Denny Bungarz, North Fork fire
incident commander, said before the evacuation order. ``We feel
very good that if that fire gets around Old Faithful, we'll be able
to skirt (the fire) around it with little or no loss.''
   Soldiers from Fort Lewis, Wash., worked Tuesday to place a
4,000-foot irrigation line on the western edge of the complex to
protect it from flames expected Wednesday. The soldiers also
chopped down small trees and brush.
   The northwest flank of the North Fork fire was about three miles
northeast of West Yellowstone, Mont., after jumping the Madison
River over the weekend, but Tuesday's change in wind direction
pushed the flames away from town.
   A lobe of the North Fork fire also burned back into the Targhee
National Forest in Idaho, where it originally started before
entering Yellowstone, said Troy Corn, fire information officer.

   Lisa Pupo has promised to retaliate against
her law partners for pulling a prank that got her hundreds of
offers for a date, but admits it's tough to top a stunt that got
the attention of 56,800 people.
   At Sunday's National Football League game between the Dallas
Cowboys and the Pittsburgh Steelers, an airplane flew over the
stadium pulling a banner that read, ``LISA PUPO _ 30 _ SINGLE,''
along wither her home phone number.
   ``I must have gotten 200 phone calls. I got calls even before
the game was over,'' Miss Pupo said.
   ``I got marriage proposals, a couple of perverted calls, a lot
of pretty sincere callers and even a woman who wanted to know why I
would do such a thing,'' she said.
   ``I highly recommend it for someone who really is looking for a
date,'' she said., adding she was having her phone number changed.
   Miss Pupo said partners Mike Burns offered her the law firm's
tickets to the season opener. So she invited her parents, a friend
_ and her boyfriend _ to the game.
   She said she has warned Burns and David White to ``watch their
backs. I told them revenge is sweet.''

   Looters plundered government buildings and
factories on Wednesday, and army trucks loaded with troops rolled
downtown after state-run radio said security forces would shoot to
prevent further destruction.
   ``The defense forces and the people's police force shall open
fire to impose control should they find that these looters, bent on
violence, continue their acts...,'' Radio Rangoon announced.
   The violence, combined with the resignation Tuesday of nearly
200 Foreign Ministry officials from the ruling party, was another
blow to the besieged government of President Maung Maung.
   Sources described the situation as chaotic. Many residents
closed the doors of their homes and shops, and traffic was minimal.
   Looters broke into the Customs Department warehouse, a building
of the Education Department and soap and textile factories. Thieves
were spotted carrying away air conditioners and office equipment
from the Rangoon office of the U.N. Food and Agriculture
Organization.
   A livestock and poultry farm near the city's airport was
pilfered.
   More troops were seen in the Kamayut Hledan area near the campus
of Rangoon University, where students have held rallies and
meetings to plot strategy to force the government to give in to
their demands for democracy.
   The radio broadcast was the first stern warning about
intervention to stop looting, which has been occurring in the
city's suburbs for several weeks and spread downtown Tuesday, when
the government allowed looting to go unchecked.
   A statement from the 187 Foreign Ministry employees who resigned
from the Burma Socialist Program Party said they decided Monday to
quit en masse to protest 26 years of one-party rule.
   Many other government departments have expressed opposition to
the government through public statements, strikes and
demonstrations. The unrest has crippled the administration, which
faces mass demonstrations nationwide Thursday if it does not yield
to demands for democracy.
   But the government has refused to budge from its plan for the
party leadership to meet Monday to consider organizing a referendum
on establishing multiparty democracy.
   ``We have now reached a stage where the government should comply
forthwith with the people's wishes. Any responsible government
would have done so long ago,'' said the statement from the Foreign
Ministry employees.
   ``Procrastination in any form by the government, either by
resorting to irrelevant legal procedures or by various maneuvers,
tactics, (and) ruses designed to retain the reins of power would
inevitably bring about immense suffering to the people, together
with the ultimate threat of fratricidal strife,'' it said.
   A ministry officer said the party resignations would have little
effect on work of the ministry, which has been minimal since the
upheavals began in late July.
   Ministry sources said employees of 16 of the 26 foreign
diplomatic missions, except for the ambassadors, expressed support
for the demands of their colleagues in the Foreign Ministry.
   Sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said hundreds of
people Tuesday carried away bags of rice from a warehouse in the
western part of the city, then sold it to merchants for a quarter
of the normal price.
   Nearby, looters took frozen fish and equipment from a warehouse
at the Fisheries Department, and another group stole provisions
from a Food and Beverages Corporation warehouse near the Rangoon
University campus, the sources said.
   Two rice-filled carriages at the Central Railway Station were
pilfered by railway employees where were later joined by nearby
residents.
   Residents of the suburb of South Okkalapa earlier reported that
at least 20 people died Monday in a clash between looters and
members of a neighborhood ``vigilance committee'' who rushed to a
government biscuit factory to stop looting.
   On Monday, opposition leaders Aung San Suu Kyi and former
Defense Minister Tin Oo threw their support behind a demand by one
student group that an interim government be formed by 8 p.m.
Wednesday or protests will follow Thursday.
   Virtually every day, at least one of the more than 40 student
groups has held news conferences or meetings to demand democracy.
   The demands also are being circulated in the more than 20 daily
newsheets, which pro-government groups also have used to try to
splinter the opposition and criticize a multi-party system.
   Burma's turmoil mounted after students rioted in September 1987
to protest economic policies, then led broader-based street
protests in March and June.
   Street riots flared anew after Ne Win resigned July 23 after 26
years in power and the party chose hard-liner Sein Lwin to succeed
him.
   Government radio said 112 people died in Rangoon in rioting
against Sein Lwin, who resigned after only 17 days. Diplomats
believe many more people were killed.
   Demonstrations have been largely peaceful since Maung Maung took
power Aug. 19 as the first civilian leader in 26 years.

<HEAD>Newspaper Gives New Details of Stalin's Death</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KAREN GILMOUR</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Soviet newspaper has provided new details about
dictator Josef Stalin's death, which has been shrouded in mystery
because of incomplete or disputed official accounts.
   Sovietskaya Estonia quotes a retired bodyguard as saying Stalin
went unattended for at least 14 hours after suffering a stroke
because Lavrenti Beria, the head of the secret police, refused to
let anyone summon physicians.
   The article appeared in Sunday's edition of the newspaper,
published in the Soviet republic of Estonia, and copies arrived in
Moscow on Tuesday.
   The paper attributed most of its report to the bodyguard, Maj.
A.T. Rykov, who it said was present when Stalin, stricken at his
dacha outside Moscow, died in March 1953.
   Rykov told the paper that Beria insisted Stalin was only
sleeping and his guards panicked when they found the dictator
unconscious on the floor of his country residence, or dacha.
   No one dared contradict Beria, who became chief of the secret
police in 1938 and carried out bloody purges, and Stalin was not
attended by doctors until the next day, according to the report.
   Stalin had ruled the country since 1924, eliminating his
opponents inside and outside the ruling Communist Party and
enforcing harsh collectivization.
   Little official information was given about his death and
historians have challenged the official reports released as other
party officials engaged in a power struggle for leadership.
   Sovietskaya Estonia, basing its article on what it said was a
lengthy interview with Rykov, gave this version:
   _Stalin probably died several days before March 5, 1953, the day
given officially as the date of death.
   _He died at his dacha and not in the Kremlin, as official
reports said.
   _An autopsy showed Stalin suffered a series of small strokes in
his final years that affected ``parts of the brain responsible for
psychotic activities.'' Results of the autopsy have not been
officially released.
   _It took more than six months to embalm and preserve the body
before it was put on public display.
   The newspaper said Rykov had served as a guard at Stalin's dacha
and recently entered the paper's editorial department and offered
to tell his story.
   ``He could talk for hours about `the leader of the people,'
saving every little fact in his memory,'' the report said.
   It quoted Rykov was as saying Stalin went to bed at 4 a.m. on
March 1, 1953, after guests had left.
   ``In the afternoon guards noticed there was no movement in
Stalin's study or other rooms, but at 6:30 p.m. a light was turned
on in the study and in the hall,'' Rykov said, according to the
newspaper.
   It quoted him as saying no one summoned the guards, who became
concerned, and when one went in to deliver a letter Stalin was
lying on the carpet in the dining room having ``obvious
difficulties in saying anything. Other guards came into the room
and carried Stalin into the largest hall. It could be seen that he
was cold, and he probably was on the floor three to four hours
without any help.''
   The account said Beria and Georgi M. Malenkov, a close aide who
briefly succeeded Stalin as the Communist Party leader, arrived at
3 a.m. on March 2 after Beria telephoned instructions that no one
was to say anything about Stalin's condition.
   After seeing the unconscious leader, Beria insisted the guards
had panicked and that ``Stalin was simply sleeping,'' according to
the report.
   Doctors finally were summoned, apparently by Nikita S.
Khrushchev, who won the power struggle to become the party chief
later in 1953, and they arrived between 9 a.m. and 10 a.m.
   ``The doctors were so nervous they could not even take off
Stalin's shirt,'' Rykov was quoted as saying. ``It had to be cut
through with scissors. The diagnosis was brain hemorrhage.
Treatment was attempted, but it was not surgical. What surgeon
could take responsibility for Stalin's life, especially when Beria
frightened everybody, asking whether they could guarantee that
Stalin's life could be preserved?''
   Beria was arrested in July 1953 and charged with conspiracy
against the state. After a secret trial he and six alleged
accomplices where shot in December 1953.
   The newspaper article also described the evening of March 5,
1953, when S.S. Debov, who had embalmed the body of Soviet founder
Vladimir Lenin, was summoned.
   ``One of Stalin's cars took Debov to Stalin's postmortem
examination, which showed some irreversible changes localized in
parts of the brain responsible for psychotic activities, which were
caused by a number of small hemorrhages,'' Rykov said.
   Stalin's funeral was held on March 9 and the body carried to the
mausoleum, which was closed for more than eight months for a
permanent embalming procedure.
   ``On Nov. 17, 1953, the mausoleum was opened for the people with
Lenin and Stalin lying together,'' the newspaper said.
   It reported the identical coffins remained side by side until
Oct. 31, 1961, when soldiers took Stalin's remains to a plain
gravesite nearby but outside the Kremlin wall.
   Khrushchev had begun his campaign against what he called the
cult of Stalin.

   China's senior leader Deng Xiaoping surprised
U.S. officials today by saying he hoped Vice President George Bush
would be the next president of the United States.
   The apparent endorsement of Bush, who headed the U.S. liaison
office in Beijing in 1974-75, came during a meeting with U.S.
Defense Secretary Frank C. Carlucci.
   ``Vice President Bush used to be (current U.S. Ambassador
Winston) Lord's predecessor so we had a lot of contact with him at
the time. I hope he'll win the election,'' Deng, 84, said in
opening remarks.
   Deng, Carlucci and others in the room laughed at the remark.
   Carlucci did not comment on the Chinese leader's preference for
the Republican nominee over Democratic Gov. Michael Dukakis of
Massachusetts.
   China's official media files occasional reports on the
presidential campaign, but has not taken sides nor commented on how
the outcome might affect China.

   Here is a text of Lloyd Bentsen's remarks to
the House of Representatives on July 12, 1950, concerning the use
of atomic weapons in Korea:
   ``Mr. Chairman, I speak to you of a subject which may well
result in a Third World War or a lasting peace. This battle in
Korea has been called a lot of fancy names in the past three weeks.
Some have said it is merely a police action, but try telling a GI
in the foxholes of Korea that he is just a cop on his beat. Ask the
wives and mothers of those who are fighting in Korea today; they
will tell you there is just one three-letter word for it _ war.
   ``It is time we face up to reality, time we admit we have a
small war on our hands, one we want to end as quickly as possible
to avoid a worldwide conflagration.
   ``The seriousness of this situation is difficult to
overemphasize. With each new day, our newspapers tell of American
men retreating, of our troops outnumbered and outgunned. Our forces
are on a peninsula surrounded by water on three sides and by the
enemy on the fourth _ an enemy with a force we have underestimated,
Korean allies whose strength we have over-estimated.
   ``A North Korean Army with approximately 200,000 well-trained
men attacking us. Tanks double the size of our own, thrown against
our outnumbered troops. At least 150,000 Chinese communists in the
vicinity of the Korean border prepared to join the North Koreans if
we continue to suffer defeat at their hands.
   ``The soldiers in Korea have done a magnificent job when you
consider their lack of fighting equipment. Our logistical problem
is most complex. The distances involved are tremendous. Our enemies
have a relatively simple problem of supply by merely transporting
on overland routes. It takes no stretch of the imagination to
realize this could develop into another Bataan.
   ``What can we do to end this war now?
   ``My suggestion may result in my being labeled an alarmist or an
extremist, but if it should result in an earlier end to this
warfare and the saving of American lives, as I believe it will,
then I mind not the labels. I propose our commander-in-chief, the
president of the United States, advise the commander of the North
Korean armnies to withdraw his troops to the north side of the 38th
Parallel within one week or use that week to evacuate a named list
of principal North Korean cities which would be subjected to atomic
attack by our Air Force.
   ``There are those who will recoil in horror and condemn such
action, but to those I say, it is deserving of these people who are
so morally wrong as to attack peaceful neighbors in the dead of
night, those who will accept the surrender of American boys, tie
their hands behind them and then brutally murder them.
   ``To those who will speak and write against this suggested
action I ask: `Why not do it now, rather than six months from now
wishing we had done it?'
   ``This war is past the wrist-slapping stage. This is not a time
for wishful thinking. The president made a brave move when he sent
our American forces to Korea.
   ``Now we are faced with the next step. If we lose South Korea
after the steps we have taken, our nation will have suffered its
severest setback in its fight against communism. It is not beyond
the realm of possibility that we could lose South Korea if the
troops of Communist China join the affray and we refuse to use all
the weapons at our command.
   ``We are fighting this battle with one hand tied behind us. Let
us use everything we can to end this war now. Should this war in
Korea continue, we can expect it to hearten communist satellites
throughout the world. We can expect similar trouble in Yugoslavia,
Iran and Formosa, from the Huks in the Philippines and an
intensified attack by the communist forces in Indochina.
   ``Should this war in Korea continue, this great and powerful
nation can find itself fighting a war of containment all over the
world, draining us of manpower and resources. Communist Russia,
during our struggles, can continue to let her satellites take the
losses, while building her own atomic stockpile until that fateful
day when the men in the Kremlin decided they are strong enough and
we are weak enough.
   ``Better to let those who would destroy free nations know that
the United States stands ready to use full military might to stop
aggression, that the atomic bomb awaits those who would violate the
peace of free men.''

suicide attempt; a version moved on sports wire.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mike Tyson won't fight Frank Bruno in London as
scheduled Oct. 22, his manager said after doctors announced the
heavyweight champion suffered a concussion and amnesia when his car
hit a tree Sunday.
   ``The fight is off,'' manager Bill Cayton said. ``I don't know
when he will be able to fight again. It will have to be against
Bruno because of the contract.''
   ``When Tyson was told the fight was off, he took it pretty
well,'' Columbia-Presbyterian neurologist Carolyn Britton said
Tuesday. ``He is in good spirits. He did sustain a concussion, but
he will be able to go home in the next day or two. He is doing
quite well.''
   It will be 30 to 60 days before the 22-year-old Tyson can resume
training, said the doctor, who strongly recommended against the
fight.
   Britton said that when Tyson arrived at the hospital Sunday
night, about nine hours after the accident near the upstate town of
Catskill, the champion couldn't remember getting into the car.
   Later, doctors said, he recalled getting into it and starting
the engine, but not the single-car accident, which occurred near
his training camp.
   Meanwhile, the Daily News today quoted Tyson through
unidentified sources as having made comments regarding suicide to
his wife prior to the accident.
   The Daily News, again through unidentified sources, also said
Tyson had threatened his wife on several occasions and is under the
care of a psychiatrist.

<HEAD>Almanac: A Penny Saved Is A Penny Spurned; Try A 12{-Cent `Bit'
Instead</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The Farmers' Almanac expects to see a
little less snow and a lot less drought next year, but what the
172-year-old digest of Americana really wants to see less of is
pennies.
   The penny, inspiration for homely expressions that have been a
staple of almanacs since Benjamin Franklin set up shop _ ``A penny
saved is a penny earned'' is one _ has outlived its usefulness,
concludes the 1989 edition of the Farmer's Almanac.
   ``Only tradition explains our stubborn attachment to the penny.
But sometimes traditions get ridiculous,'' the almanac says, living
down its reputation as a defender of long-held values.
   Instead, editor Ray Geiger has proposed a new coin worth 12{
cents, or one ``bit.''
   ``I can't think of anything you can buy with a penny. The penny
candy is all a nickel,'' said Geiger, who with varying degrees of
success has led the publication's previous campaigns to restore
city names to postmarks, eliminate the nine-digit ZIP code and
print currency in colors other than green.
   ``You see a penny on the street and you no longer bother to pick
it up,'' and young children often find it's no longer worth their
time and effort to empty jars of pennies and package them in
50-cent rolls, Geiger said in a recent interview.
   Also in the newly released edition is a prediction for another
``cold and mean'' winter, but not as rough as the last one, with a
little less snow in the Midwest and the Rockies.
   The summer of 1989 should be more pleasant, with drier than
average weather but no repeat of this year's drought, according to
Geiger. ``We didn't predict the drought, but neither did anybody
else,'' he said.
   But what really gets Geiger heated up is the persistence of the
penny, whose purchasing power has diminished to the point where its
only uses are making change and collecting sales taxes, according
to the almanac.
   The almanac's plan for the bit _ a name derived from ``two
bits,'' the colloquial expression for a quarter _ takes into
account the change in monetary values.
   ``This perceives the dollar as being cut into eight equal
pieces, half a dollar is four bits, 75 cents is six bits,'' the
almanac said. It points out that while U.S. money is based on the
decimal system, stock markets routinely list prices in increments
of one-eighth of a dollar.
   The U.S. Mint churns out billions of pennies each year, and the
almanac suggests that as many as 200 billion of the coins may be
squirreled away in vaults, baby banks, cookie jars and shoe boxes.
   The almanac says the introduction of the bit would bridge the
gap between the dime and the quarter, for greater flexibility in
coin combinations that would produce 22{ cents, 27{ cents and so
forth, all the way up to 97{ cents.
   To promote the idea, the almanac suggests a gold-toned coin that
would be about as thick as a dime, midway in size between the
nickel and the quarter.
   The Treasury Department declined to embrace the recommendation,
saying there has been no groundswell of support for a change.
   ``We've periodically examined the penny, and right now the
department has no plans to eliminate it. It's still an integral
part of the coinage system,'' said spokeswoman Felice Pelosi.
   Undaunted, Geiger said he was prepared to travel to Washington
to solicit support for the change.
   ``Some people will think this is a nutty idea, but they thought
it was a nutty idea to bring back the old postmark, and that was a
singlehanded victory for the Farmers' Almanac,'' he said.
   Geiger's almanac, which is sold to banks, insurance companies
and other businesses for distribution to customers as a promotion,
claims a circulation of more than 5 million.
   Its 48 pages are a compendium of calendar data, household hints,
one-line jokes, inspirational messages, recipes and, of course,
weather predictions derived through a secret formula by the
almanac's forecaster, Caleb Weatherbee.
   Geiger, who turns 78 this month, is marking his 55th year as
almanac editor, a tenure he says ties the record established by the
original editor of the Old Farmers Almanac, a New Hampshire-based
publication founded in 1792.

<HEAD>Bentsen Says Campaign Turned Nasty Early</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Democratic vice presidential candidate Lloyd
Bentsen returns to the Senate today after a Labor Day recess spent
in campaigning that he says surprised him with its ferocity.
   ``I think this is early on, to be as aggressive as it is,'' said
Bentsen, who had to battle some jeers as he wrapped up a campaign
trip at the Virginia Polytechnic Institute in Blacksburg, Va. on
Tuesday.
   Mike Dukakis, the Democratic presidential nominee, and Vice
President George Bush, the GOP candidate, also faced hostile
elements in their appearances on Tuesday.
   Bentsen was interrupted as he spoke at an outdoor rally at
Virginia Tech by students carrying Bush posters. Instead of
ignoring them, Bentsen spoke to them directly.
   ``I met George Bush once before,'' he told them, alluding to the
1970 Texas Senate race in which he defeated the then-congressman
Bush. ``And Quayle season is opening early this year,'' he said.
   Afterward, Bentsen visited with reporters on his campaign jet
and said he enjoyed the challenge. ``It gets my adrenaline up,'' he
said.
   Bentsen told reporters he felt the Republicans were running on
``phony issues'' such as Dukakis' veto of a bill requiring the
pledge of allegiance in schools, a decision the Massachusetts
governor made based on a Supreme Court opinion.
   The Texas senator has been responding by sharpening his own
attacks. On Tuesday at Virginia Tech, he said the Republicans have
tried to ``trash educational opportunity across the country.''
   ``We can't make quality education available only to the
privileged few,'' he said, as part of the Democrats' charge that
the Republicans are unfair to working people.
   Bentsen planned to spend today in the Senate, including a
procedural vote on a politically-sensitive textile trade bill. He
was scheduled to leave the Capitol again this evening for a
$1,000-per-person reception in Connecticut to raise money for his
Senate campaign.
   Under an unusual Texas law, Bentsen is running for both the vice
presidency and re-election to his Senate seat, since he cannot drop
out of the latter without handing the spot to the GOP for six
years. If he were to win both races, he could then resign from the
Senate and a special election would be held.
   Bentsen's late-summer campaigning has been concentrated in
Texas, the South, and border states. But he planned to begin a more
wide-ranging schedule Thursday. After campaigning in New York on
Thursday, he was heading for Iowa and then California.

   The five astronauts who in about
three weeks will fly the first post-Challenger space shuttle
mission intensified emergency and countdown training here today.
   A busy schedule called for them to inspect their shuttle
Discovery and its communications satellite payload on the launch
pad, rehearse an emergency departure from the pad, fit their flight
pressure suits and be briefed on preparations for the launch.
   The National Aeronautics and Space Administration hopes to
launch Discovery in the last week of September, but won't set a
firm date until Sept. 14, following a two-day flight readiness
review.
   Commander Rick Hauck and pilot Dick Covey scheduled practice
runway landings today in a jet plane modified to handle like the
shuttle. They had planned to do the flying on Tuesday, but rain
forced a postponement.
   Hauck, Covey and mission specialists George Nelson, Mike Lounge
and Dave Hilmers, all veteran shuttle fliers, arrived here
yesterday from the Johnson Space Center in Houston for three days
of training culminating on Thursday with a countdown test.
   For that test, the astronauts will board Discovery to take part
in the final two hours of the count, rehearsing launch-day
procedures.
   ``It's really hard to believe that, at least by the calendar, we
could be less than three weeks from launch. But we are, and we're
ready,'' Hauck said Tuesday.
   The space shuttle fleet has been grounded since the loss of
Challenger and its seven-person crew in an explosion 73 seconds
after launch on Jan. 28, 1986.

   The Army is studying the potential
consequences of giving stimulants like amphetamines to soldiers to
help solve the problem of keeping them alert when they go days
without sleep, a newspaper reported.
   Officials expect to give stimulants to troops in the field ``in
the near future,'' according to a report by the Washington-based
Walter Reed Army Institute of Research, which conducted the study.
   The San Jose Mercury News, which obtained the report, said
Tuesday that similar studies are being conducted by the Navy and
Air Force.
   Army spokesman Ben Smith said the objective is to find drugs
that can keep soldiers sharp when they are awake for days. Among
those under study are amphetamines, and stimulants such as
nicotine, the newspaper reported.
   Smith said concerns about side effects have placed their
possible use in doubt. Past research has concluded that extended
use of amphetamines and their derivatives can lead to paranoia,
hallucinations and violent behavior.
   ``You'd love to find the perfect drug that enhances performance
without side effects,'' Smith said. ``But any recommendation about
what to use would have to come from elsewhere. Our researchers are
objective scientists.''
   The non-classified research has been under way for about four
years and is the latest in a series of military studies on jet lag
and sleep deprivation, Smith said.
   He said the report will be published in the journal
Neuropsychopharmacology, published by the University of California,
San Diego, and will be reviewed at many levels of the military.
   ``Research is under way to identify new stimulant drugs that can
maintain normal alertness and performance in the face of days or
weeks of partial sleep,'' the report said.
   It predicted that in the next decade the studies will ``no doubt
provide novel means (both behavioral and pharmacological) to
sustain soldier alertness and unit performance,'' according to the
newspaper.
   Gregory Belenky, a Walter Reed scientist and a principal
researcher in the study, was not available for comment Tuesday,
Smith said. But Belenky is not a supporter of amphetamines and is
not making a case for their use in the report, Smith said.
   Army and Navy officials say their personnel are not allowed to
use stimulants or sleep-inducing drugs unless prescribed by a
doctor. But in July, Air Force officials acknowledged that some
pilots use the amphetamine Dexedrine.
   The officials said the pilots only take the stimulant to stay
awake on long flights and that it is not used for normal,
day-to-day training flights.
   In the Army experiments, subjects were kept awake 48 hours and
then are given either a placebo or up to 20 milligrams of an
amphetamine, Belenky told the Mercury News.
   Use of amphetamines ``really brought people back to normal
levels for about 12 hours,'' he said. ``It really sort of restores
mood, it restores performance.''

<HEAD>Foreign Aid Offered, But Problem Is Getting Aid To Flood Victims</HEAD>

   Government officials said today they
have no way to distribute millions of dollars in foreign aid to the
more than 20 million victims of floods that still cover
three-fourths of this impoverished nation.
   Railroads and highways were washed away, bridges were mangled
and the Dhaka Airport was still partly under water today and unable
to receive large planes.
   The floods have claimed at least 1,267 lives, according to
newspaper reports. The government put the death toll at 412.
   About 21 million people _ nearly one-fifth of the total
population _ have lost their homes, according to the government.
   With wells and pumps throughout much of the low-lying nation
under water, people have resorted to drinking the very flood water
that has marooned them. Thousands of new cases of diarrhea were
reported each day.
   Although the government has begun distributing water
purification tablets, its efforts were hampered by flood waters
that prevented helicopters from landing in some of the worst hit
areas.
   ``In most places, people are marooned. It is difficult to supply
the purification tablets, so people will be facing more diarrhea.
Typhoid is also possible, although we have no reports yet,'' said a
government relief official who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   He said there were no reports of starvation, but added: ``There
is danger of people starving if we can't get food to them in time.''
   The floods began in June with the arrival of the annual monsoon
rains.
   The waters subsided but rose to new heights Aug. 27 as heavy
rains in neighboring India and Nepal washed down from the Himalayan
mountains into the Ganges and Brahmaputra rivers, which run through
Bangladesh to the Bay of Bengal.
   The independent Bengali-language newspaper Khobar today reported
101 deaths in the past 24 hours that were not included in the
government tally. Khobar said most of the latest victims drowned or
died of diarrhea and snake bites.
   The government's health control center said Tuesday night that
at least 102,000 people throughout the country were known to be
suffering from diarrhea. That count included 10,000 cases reported
in the past 24 hours.
   Foreign Ministry and Relief Ministry officials said they were
unable to estimate the total amount of foreign aid offered so far.
   However, Japan has offered $13 million dollars in flood relief,
the United States $3.6 million and Canada $5 million. The European
Common Market pledged $560,000 dollars, and other offers continued
to arrive.
   Bangladesh, one of the poorest and most densely populated
nations on earth, already was slated to receive $2 billion in
foreign assistance before the floods.
   ``It's certainly one of the world's biggest receivers of foreign
aid,'' said Earling Dessau, head of the United Nations Development
Program in Bangladesh.
   The United Nations has 1,200 foreign and local staffers working
in Bangladesh, the largest U.N. mission in the world, Desau said.
   Bangladesh needs 18 million tons of rice a year for food and was
expected to produce 16.5 million tons until the flood hit. The
shortfall was covered by imports, largely in the form of grants
from abroad.
   But 8 million tons of rice was in the ground when the floods
struck, and the government estimates that at least a fourth of that
crop has been destroyed. How much of the remainder can be saved
depends on how fast the flood waters recede.
   The Ganges, Brahmaputra and Meghna rivers _ the largest in the
country _ have started receding but the levels of at least 12 of
their tributaries has risen, the government's flood control center
said.

   The dollar fell on the Tokyo foreign exchange
market Wednesday, while share prices made a moderate rebound.
   The dollar closed at 134.30 yen, down 1.30 yen from Tuesday's
close of 135.60 yen. The U.S. currency had opened at 134.55 yen and
moved in a range of 134.30-134.72 yen.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues, a 21.07-point
loser Tuesday, closed at 27,504.01, up 183.50 points, or 0.67
percent. After the index opened at 27,407.81 with a 87.30-point
gain, share prices continued to rise until the end of trading.
   ``The dollar finally went below the 135-yen level, and investors
were less concerned with the higher dollar,'' said Hiroyuki Sekine,
exchange dealer at the Daiwa Bank in Tokyo.
   ``That's why the dollar-buying drive became weaker and investors
began buying more yen,'' Sekine said.
   Also spurring yen buying was the Bank of Japan's short-term
economic forecast Tuesday that predicted Japan's economy would keep
growing without inflation, Sekine said.
   At the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the Nikkei Stock Average of 225
selected issues, down 21.07 points the previous day, closed the
morning session up 78.79 points from Tuesday's close at 27,399.30.
   A stock analyst with Nomura Securities said the rebound in share
prices and moderate trading also stemmed from the Bank of Japan's
report.
   ``Investors became optimistic after the Bank of Japan's report
and bought more shares. There was less of a cautious mood in the
market,'' he said.
   ``Although the stock market had been directionless due to
unfavorable factors at home and abroad, it is gradually getting
clear,'' the analyst added, speaking on condition of anonymity.

<HEAD>Government Tells Solidarity Activists To Join Official Unions</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN DANISZEWSKI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Workers who boycotted official unions
after Solidarity was outlawed should now join those unions instead
of agitating for their own, says government spokesman Jerzy Urban.
   Lech Walesa called the comment irresponsible and said such
government utterances could jeopardize ``roundtable'' talks at
which communist authorities have promised to discuss reinstating
the Solidarity independent labor federation, which he chairs.
   Urban, in his first news conference since a 19-day strike wave
ended Saturday, also said Tuesday that the talks between government
officials and worker representatives would be held sometime this
month.
   He said government officials want the meetings to begin as soon
as possible, but that they would be canceled automatically if any
more ``political'' strikes occur.
   The last of the strikes ended after Walesa won government
assurances that the legalization of Solidarity would be discussed
in the round-table talks.
   Urban said the round table with Walesa and other worker
delegates will include several dozen people and cover speeding
economic recovery, reaching a national consensus, improving living
standards and democratizing Poland.
   Asked about the strikers' demand for reinstatement of
Solidarity, Urban said allowing two trade unions in one plant was
unacceptable.
   ``If followers of some tendency connected in the past with
Solidarity are a majority in a given plant, then they can either
join the (official) trade union, outnumbering it and directing it
where they wish, or form a coalition, a compromise body'' with the
official union, he said.
   ``The existing legal rules offer a broad scope of
possibilities,'' he said, and Solidarity activists made a
``historical mistake'' in boycotting the new government unions
created in 1982 after Solidarity was outlawed.
   Urban said a pro-Solidarity union could be formed in a plant
where no union existed, but it would not be permitted to use the
name Solidarity ``in the present legal situation.''
   Reached at home in Gdansk after Urban's news conference, Walesa
said: ``Let them talk. But they should remember that they could
destroy the round table by such irresponsible statements. This is
all I can say.''
   Solidarity activists say they want their own unions not
membership in the unions established by the government under the
1981 martial-law crackdown.
   The official union federation, called OPZZ, said it would oppose
allowing new unions into plants where it is established.
   An OPZZ resolution also said Premier Zbigniew Messner's
government should resign. Its leaders have said government
officials should be held personally accountable for economic
problems that led to last month's strikes, which affected 20
enterprises employing 100,000 people.
   Numerous signs in the official press and in speeches at a party
conference last month have pointed to changes in the government at
the next parliament session, which is expected this month. Such a
shake-up would not affect the Communist Party leadership, which
holds the real power.

Action</HEAD>

   A guerrilla leader has endorsed
plans by the rebels' political allies to participate in national
elections in March, but still vows military action to ``complicate
the election.''
   Leonel Gonzalez, one of five commanders of the leftist Farabundo
Marti National Liberation Front, said Tuesday that the rebels
approve of the plans by the Democratic Revolutionary Front to take
part in the elections.
   ``That they have decided to participate is an autonomous
decision that in no way damages the (military-political) alliance
but rather strengthens it in light of the current situation,'' he
said on the rebels' clandestine Radio Venceremos.
   The Democratic Revolutionary Front, an umbrella organization of
leftist political organizations linked to the guerrilla army,
announced last month that they would take part in the elections.
   The rebels and the leftists have boycotted elections here for
the past decade, contending the balloting was part of a
U.S.-designed counterinsurgency effort and that democracy did not
exist in El Salvador.
   The rebels have been battling the U.S.-backed government since
1979. An estimated 65,000 people have died during the civil war.
   The election likely will be a close contest between El
Salvador's two dominant parties, the incumbent Christian Democrats
and the conservative Republican Nationalist Alliance.
   The rightist alliance, known as Arena, gained control of the
legislature and two-thirds of the country's municipal governments
in elections held in March.
   Incumbent President Jose Napoleon Duarte, barred by the
constitution from another term as president, has been diagnosed as
having terminal liver cancer. Gonzalez said on Radio Venceremos
that the left's participation is intended ``to prepare all forces
for the politically negotiated solution (to the war). It is a
correct decision.''
   But he said ``We must make the entire electoral process a
political and military battleground.
   ``Our military action will deepen the political crisis and
complicate the electoral scheme,'' he said.
   The guerrillas demand a share of power in what they say would be
a transition government ``of broad popular participation.'' The
government has repeatedly rejected the demand, insisting the rebels
lay down their arms and compete for power through elections.

   Defense lawyers appeared grim, but
insisted the trials of remaining defendants in the $7 million Wells
Fargo robbery would not be harmed by the guilty pleas of two others.
   Luz Berrios Berrios and Paul S. Weinberg accepted plea bargains
in federal court Tuesday and pleaded to reduced charges stemming
from the 1983 heist, the second-largest in U.S. history.
   Ms. Berrios pleaded guilty to conspiring to use some of the
stolen cash to pay for a toy giveaway in Hartford in 1985. Weinberg
pleaded guilty to a reduced charge of transporting some of the
stolen money in 1984.
   ``It's not going to hurt us,'' said attorney Leonard Weinglass,
who represents Juan Segarra Palmer, a Harvard-educated lawyer
accused of being the ringleader of a Puerto Rican terrorist group
that claimed responsibility for the robbery. Prosecutors declined
comment while the cases of other defendants are pending.
   The pleas were made as jury selection began in the trial of
Weinberg; Ms. Berrios; her husband, Segarra Palmer; and four
others. Questioning of 165 prospective jurors was expected to begin
Thursday.
   Authorities say the group, Los Macheteros, planned to use the
money to finance terrorist acts aimed at ending the U.S.
government's control of Puerto Rico.
   Ms. Berrios told U.S. District Judge T. Emmet Clarie that she
conspired with others in Puerto Rico to send between $5,000 and
$12,000 to Hartford to pay for toys given away on Jan. 6, 1985,
Three Kings Day, the day when people in many Latin American
countries exchange gifts.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Albert S. Dabrowski said that
racketeering and other felony charges against Ms. Berrios would be
dropped at sentencing. She faces a maximum penalty of five years in
prison and a $10,000 fine. No sentencing date was set.
   Ms. Berrios will not testify at the trial of any other Wells
Fargo defendants, said her attorney, Jacob Wieselman.
   Weinberg, a Springfield, Mass., attorney, pleaded guilty to a
misdemeanor charge of aiding and abetting in the transport and
receipt of less than $100 in stolen money from the heist at a Wells
Fargo depot in West Hartford on Sept. 12, 1983. He had been charged
with four felonies.
   Weinberg admitted to transporting some of the stolen cash from
Pennsylvania through Connecticut to Springfield. But his attorney,
F. Mac Buckley, said Weinberg had been ``duped'' into his role by
Segarra Palmer, to whom he loaned his truck and trailer.
   Weinberg faces a maximum penalty of one year in prison and a
$1,000 fine. He will testify for the government in other cases.
   Nine other defendants are awaiting trial at a later date after
the government appeals a ruling by Clarie throwing out some
tape-recorded evidence obtained through wiretaps.
   Three defendants are at large, including Victor Gerena, the
Wells Fargo security guard who authorities say was recruited by Los
Macheteros to carry out the robbery. He allegedly fled to Cuba with
$4 million.
   The government contends that all of the defendants except
Weinberg are salaried members of Los Macheteros.
   Authorities believe some of the money is buried in Puerto Rico.
The only money recovered was the torn halves of a $10 bill.

   Roy Rogers chased, tackled and captured a
bank robbery suspect, authorities said, but the hero in the
real-life drama isn't married to Dale Evans and never rode a horse
called Trigger.
   ``I just saw the guy and did what I thought ought to be done,''
Rogers, 38, of Tulsa said after Tuesday's action.
   Rogers captured Rodney McDonald, 45, of Bartlesville, a block
from a Fourth Century National Bank branch moments after the
holdup, said FBI spokesman Dan Vogel.
   Vogel said bank robbery charges will be sought against McDonald.
   Authorities said Rogers began chasing McDonald after seeing a
bank employee chasing the man. Rogers and the unidentified employee
restrained the unarmed suspect until police arrived.
   The bank was robbed by a man with a rectangular object he
claimed was bomb, but turned out not to be an explosive, police
said.

<TEXT>
   The safe landing of two cosmonauts after two
aborted attempts comes during a busy year for the Soviet manned
space program, with cosmonauts seeking to break their own country's
endurance record in an orbiting station.
   The Soviet Union inaugurated manned spaceflight in 1961 and has
since gained the confidence to televise launches and landings live
and invite foreigners to climb aboard for a ride, as it did with
the Afghan cosmonaut who returned to Earth today.
   But the tense ordeal of the Afghan-Soviet crew reminded the
Soviets of the dangers of space flight in a similar, if less
tragic, way that the explosion of the space shuttle Challenger in
January 1986 sobered U.S. space officials.
   ``We are already used to everything going smoothly in space,''
commentator Alexander Tikhomirov told Soviet viewers in a prime
time television newscast. ``And some forget about the danger which
space research entails. And here, this once more convinces us how
complex a matter it is and what a huge amount of abnormal
situations awaits cosmonauts in orbit.''
   Whether the problems with the latest mission, in which
malfunctions trapped the the two cosmonauts in orbit as food and
oxygen dwindled, will delay the next ventures in the Soviet program
is unclear.
   Those ventures include a Nov. 21 blastoff by a Soviet-French
crew for a monthlong mission, a 1990 voyage with an Austrian crew
member and a later mission with a Malaysian crew member.
   The most enduring symbol of Soviet commitment to manned
spaceflight has been the orbiting Mir space station. The research
complex, launched in February 1986, is planned as a permanently
manned fixture in space.
   Two cosmonauts have been aboard Mir since Dec. 21 and plan to
break the 326-day space endurance record set by Yuri Romanenko
aboard Mir last year. In June, a Soviet-Bulgarian crew spent 10
days in space, including a visit to Mir. Soviet officials also have
indicated they will launch their own space shuttle, unmanned, by
year's end. They have emphasized the shuttle will not be flown
manned until it is proven safe.
   The candor with which the Soviets informed the world of the
plight of their temporarily stranded crew showed how treatment of
the space program has changed under Soviet leader Mikhail S.
Gorbachev. It was a far cry from the secrecy in which missions were
veiled starting with the Oct. 4, 1957, launch of the first
satellite, Sputnik.
   Since Yuri Gagarin blasted off as the first man in space in
1961, manned launches have become routine. Soviet officials now
show launches and in some cases landings on live television and
invite foreigners to watch the blastoffs. The first live TV
coverage of a Soviet manned space launch was the Apollo-Soyuz
mission in 1975. The first launch to be shown live of an
all-Russian crew was in 1984.
   Space has also served political purposes for the Soviet Union.
Prior to the Afghan mission, the Soviets had 13 ``guest
cosmonauts'' aboard their spacecraft in flights that serve to show
off their scientific prowess and promote friendly ties with other
countries.
   As U.S. officials still grapple with the tragic deaths of the
seven Challenger crew members, the Soviets have to think back 17
years to their last fatal space disaster.
   Three cosmonauts docked with the Salyut 1 space station, and
then during re-entry on June 30, 1971, air leaked out of their
capsule and they suffocated.
   The first and only other fatality in a Soviet space flight was
Vladimir Komarov. His Soyuz 1 capsule crash landed April 24, 1967,
but Soviet officials never explained what exactly went wrong.
   Western space experts believe six to eight other cosmonauts died
in training accidents on the ground from 1960-1975.

<HEAD>Dollar Falls Sharply, Share Prices Rebound</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar fell sharply against the Japanese yen,
while share prices moderately rebounded on the Tokyo Stock Exchange
today.
   The foreign exchange market began trading the dollar at 134.55
yen, with a 1.05-yen drop from Tuesday's close of 135.60 yen. The
currency ranged within 134.30 yen and 134.72 yen in a spot trading
estimated at $8 billion, closing at 134.30 yen.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues, which lost
21.07 points Tuesday, recouped 183.50 points, or 0.67 percent from
the previous day's close of 27,320.51. After the index earned 87.30
points to open at 27,407.81, share prices went higher to finish the
day's session at 27,504.01 in moderate trading with estimated 750
million shares.
   ``The stock market now has less factors to make investors
cautious, and their participation finally began to be active
again,'' said an analyst with a major securities firm in Tokyo.
   ``Although the volume is not that much yet, it has been at least
inceasing,'' he said, adding that the market was regaining its
strength.
   Among the issues attracting investors were steels, shipbuilding
and resort-related stocks.
   The dollar's decline was widely attributed to the Bank of
Japan's short term economy forecast Tuesday that reported the
Japanese economy has been and will be growing without inflation.
   ``Although some securities companies once sold the yen to buy
the dollar for their profit-taking purposes, the dollar-buying
drive in the market was not strong any more,'' said Hiroyuki
Sekine, exchange dealer with the Daiwa Bank in Tokyo.

<HEAD>Supreme Court Rejects Cardenas Petition</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MEXICO CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Opposition leader Cuauhtemoc Cardenas
suffered another setback in his quest for the presidency when the
Supreme Court refused to investigate alleged electoral fraud.
   In a unanimous opinion, the court said Tuesday it could
intervene in a congressional certification of the election results
only if irregularities jeopardized the entire vote count.
   Cardenas, the candidate of the leftist National Democratic
Front, claims the July 6 election was rigged to favor Carlos
Salinas de Gortari of the governing Institutional Revolutionary
Party, or PRI.
   Official results gave Salinas 50.36 percent of the vote,
Cardenas 31.12 percent and Clouthier 17.07 percent. The PRI has won
every presidential race since it was formed in 1929, but never by
such a narrow margin.
   On Friday, the Chamber of Deputies begins what are expected to
be tense sessions to confirm Salinas' victory.
   In a letter to Cardenas, Supreme Court president Carlos del Rio
Rodriguez said the court was empowered to investigate only those
fraud cases that ``could place in doubt the legality of the entire
election process.''
   His ruling was carried by the Excelsior news service.
   The decision followed a vigorous defense of Salinas' victory by
the PRI's two highest officials.
   ``This has been the most watched-over election in Mexico's
history,'' said PRI secretary-general Manuel Camacho Solis. He
rejected the Front's arguments that another vote count would show
Cardenas won.
   Camacho Solis said that ``even applying the political criteria
of the (Front), there exists no basis for saying that Cuauhtemoc
Cardenas won the election. Cuauhtemoc Cardenas loses in the urban
areas; he loses in the rural areas.''
   PRI president Jorge de la Vega Dominguez accused Cardenas and
National Action Party candidate Manuel Clouthier of pressing their
fraud protests to upset the presidential transition.
   Salinas is scheduled to be inaugurated Dec. 1.
   ``The opposition parties, in an immoral and perverse attitude,
have been speaking since long before the elections of electoral
fraud,'' de la Vega Dominguez said Monday. ``They never proved it
because it never occurred.''
   ``Their objective is simplistic and puerile: the conquest of
public power through provocation. Confusion, disorder and
destabilization,'' de la Vega Dominguez said.
   His statements were among the strongest by the PRI on the
opposition since the election.

   An immigrant apparently distraught over money
and family problems killed his two children and wounded 14 police
officers before he was shot dead during a day-long standoff,
authorities said.
   A gunbattle between police and Cho Mun Chu, 45, closed
Manhattan's FDR Drive during Tuesday morning's rush hour, tying up
thousands of motorists as negotiators tried to coax Chu into laying
down his birdshot-loaded 12-gauge shotgun.
   Helen Chu, 8, and her 9-year-old brother, Warren Chu, were
apparently both shot in the head by Chu during the nine-hour siege,
police said. The standoff ended when police shot Chu twice in the
chest; he died later that night at Bellevue Hospital.
   The 14 officers were treated at hospitals for minor injuries
involving wounds from shotgun pellets and released.
   Chu, who came to the United States from Taiwan 13 years ago, was
described by neighbors as extremely bad-tempered. He had
``financial problems and family problems'' that set him off, said
First Deputy Police Commissioner Richard Condon.
   ``He was constantly hitting on his wife, his kids,'' said Pedro
Morales, 26, whose girlfriend, Vicky Bello, lives in the apartment
above the Chus and has filed several complaints against the family.
   ``The guy was a psycho, he used to bang on the walls and the
ceiling,'' Morales said.
   ``He chased my ex-husband with a samurai sword when he
complained to him a few years ago,'' Ms. Bello said.
   Police Commissioner Benjamin Ward said authorities believe the
boy may have been killed before police arrived; Helen was last seen
alive at noon by a police camera that had been lowered to a living
room window to monitor Chu's movements.
   The girl's death was believed to be the first time since the
elite Hostage Negotiating Team began in 1973 that a hostage was
killed during negotiations, said Sgt. Raymond O'Donnell, a police
spokesman.
   The shootings began at 6 a.m., when Chu wounded three officers
called to investigate complaints of shots being fired on the Lower
East Side, police said.
   Hundreds of officers were brought into the area, and police
removed the door to Chu's 11th-floor apartment from its hinges in
an attempt to bring the girl to safety, Ward said.
   Negotiations were in its fifth hour when the gunman suddenly
fired two shotgun blasts at police, including several hostage
negotiators who were talking with him from behind a barricade
outside the doorway. Neither of the children was then visible, Ward
said.
   ``We waited until he fired point-blank _ one captain was hit,
four lieutenants were hit, and one police officer was hit by
pellets, and he was now firing point blank at the door,'' the
commissioner said.
   The officers returned two shots, hitting Chu twice in the chest,
Ward said.
   Chu had made no threats against his family and in the course of
negotiations had made no demands, said First Deputy Police
Commissioner Richard Condon.
   He was believed to be unemployed, police said. His $280-a-month
apartment is rent-subsidized by the city, according to Devorah L.
Fong, a spokeswoman for Grenadier Realty Corp., which manages the
building.
   Chu's wife, Hui Choy Chu, 37, was thought to be visiting Taiwan,
O'Donnell said.

   A moderate earthquake centered in eastern Kentucky shook homes
and rattled residents in five states but caused no major damage or
reports of injuries, officials say.
   ``It practically shook me out of the chair,'' Betty Raines of
Huntington, Ohio, said after Tuesday night's quake, which
registered 4.5 on the Richter scale and was also felt in Kentucky,
Indiana, Tennessee and West Virginia.
   The quake struck at 10:28 p.m. EDT, and was centered about 40
miles northeast of Lexington, Ky., and 65 miles southwest of
Ashland, according to the National Earthquake Information Center in
Golden, Colo.
   An aftershock was recorded a few minutes later, said Greg
Steiner, technical director of the Center for Earthquake Research
and Information at Memphis State University in Tennessee.
   ``It scared me to death,'' said Mary Welch, state Disaster and
Emergency Services coordinator in Montgomery County, Ky., near the
epicenter.
   Ms. Welch said the reported damage included falling plaster at
an apartment building in the county seat of Mount Sterling.
Long-distance phone service was knocked out in parts of Mount
Sterling.
   Some phone service was lost in neighboring Bath County and a
clock was ``knocked from my wall,'' said emergency coordinator
Vernon Barber.
   In Owingsville, the quake jarred an air conditioner out of a
wall of the county jail, said Ronnie Beadle, deputy jailer and
dispatcher.
   Hundreds of Cincinnati residents jammed police switchboards to
report the temblor, authorities said.
   ``We've had at least 500 people call in here,'' Richard Young,
Hamilton County Communication Center supervisor in Cincinnati, said
about an hour after the quake. ``Everybody and their aunt called in
here to find out what happened or make sure we knew about it.''
   ``My door cracked open when it happened. I could hear it,'' said
Kris Sommer, a resident of the Dayton, Ohio, suburb of Amberly.
   The quake also was felt in Putnam County, W.Va., near
Charleston, said Sheriff's Deputy K.D. Watson.
   ``We got a couple of calls from people who said their houses
were shaking, but one guy said his house shakes all the time,''
Watson said.
   The region's last strong quake occurred June 10, 1987, when a
temblor registering 5.0 on the Richter scale shook residents in 16
states from Kansas to South Carolina and parts of Canada, breaking
windows and tumbling chimneys.
   That quake occurred along the New Madrid Fault, a 150-mile crack
in the earth from northern Arkansas to southern Illinois.
   Tuesday night's quake was not related to that fault, but
occurred in a region ``laced with fault lines'' covering part of
Tennessee, southern Kentucky and Virginia, Steiner said.
   An earthquake of 3.5 on the Richter scale can cause slight
damage in the local area, 4 moderate damage, 5 considerable damage,
6 severe damage. A 7 reading is a ``major'' earthquake, capable of
widespread heavy damage; 8 is a ``great'' quake, capable of
tremendous damage.
   The San Francisco earthquake of 1906, which occurred before the
Richter scale was devised, has been estimated at 8.3 on the Richter
scale.

   Conservative Rep. Connie Mack III handily won the
GOP nomination in the race to succeed retiring Sen. Lawton Chiles,
and he awaits the outcome of a runoff between two longstanding
Democratic rivals.
   State Insurance Commissioner Bill Gunter, in a Senate runoff for
the third time, goes one-on-one in the Oct. 4 runoff with Rep.
Kenneth ``Buddy'' MacKay, who ran second to Gunter in Tuesday's
bitterly fought six-way Democratic primary.
   Chiles, 58, is retiring after three terms.
   Voters in Nevada, meanwhile, nominated Republican Sen. Chic
Hecht and Democratic Gov. Dick Bryan to face eachother in November
for Hecht's U.S. Senate. And Vietnam war hero James ``Bo'' Gritz,
who has made forays into Southeast Asia looking for POWs, lost his
bid in a congressional race.
   Mack, grandson of the baseball Hall of Fame manager, said he
could beat either of his rivals. ``Whoever it is, it will be
someone who wants more taxes, more spending, more government, and
less freedom,'' he said.
   Mack, 47, who got campaign help from President Reagan and
indicted former National Security Council aide Oliver North, said
his campaign will prove that ``the conservative movement isn't
over.''
   With 99 percent of the vote reporting unofficial returns, Mack
had 392,342 votes, or 62 percent, to 243,039 votes, or 38 percent,
for his only challenger, aggressive former federal prosecutor
Robert Merkle.
   Merkle, 44, said his campaign, shunned by the GOP hierarchy, had
``sent shock waves through this state. ... We have proved without a
doubt that the U.S. Senate slot is not for sale in this state.''
   Mack planned a four-city swing beginning in Key West today and
will soon air new television commercials in an effort to build
support while Gunter and MacKay are sniping at each other.
   Gunter, 54, said he won the election even though MacKay, 55,
``ran against my record. ... The people of Florida don't like that
type of campaigning.''
   With 99 percent of precincts reporting, Gunter had 360,831 votes
or 37 percent, followed by MacKay with 251,968 votes or 26 percent.
U.S. Rep. Dan Mica, 44, was third with 178,138 votes or 18 percent.
State Sen. Patricia ``Pat'' Frank had 115,187 votes, or 12 percent.
   Former Republican Gov. Claude R. Kirk, 62, was fifth with 48,797
votes or 5 percent, and former Senate postal clerk Fred Rader, 41,
had 11,222 votes for 1 percent.
   MacKay had accused Gunter of conflict of interest for accepting
contributions from the industry he regulates. MacKay's campaign
manager, Greg Farmer, called Gunter's 12 years as insurance
commissioner ``a saga of sleaze.''
   Gunter retorted that MacKay was hypocritical for accepting funds
from political action committees that Gunter said wanted to
influence his votes.
   Ms. Frank, praised for running a clean campaign but badly
outspent by the Democratic leaders, said the Senate race was an
``M&M campaign _ money and mudslinging.''
   MacKay ran third in a bitter 1980 primary in which Gunter ran
second, then defeated incumbent Richard Stone in a runoff. Gunter
lost to Republican Paula Hawkins, but Democrat Bob Graham won that
seat back by defeating Mrs. Hawkins in 1986.
   Elsewhere in Florida, 10-term Democratic Rep. William Chappell
of Ormond Beach captured 70 percent of the vote against primary
challenger Charley Roberts, a retired Army veteran. Chappell's name
has been mentioned in published reports about the defense
procurement probe, but he denied wrongdoing.
   ``Any time we can get this type of response on this kind of
(rainy) day, we know we are doing a good job,'' said Chappell, 66,
who described his Democratic opponent and three Republican
challengers as ``four vultures waiting to see the demise of ol'
Bill Chappell.''

   Seven bombs exploded today
outside offices in this northwestern regional capital and in three
other cities, causing extensive damage but no injuries, police said.
   No group immediately claimed responsibility, but police said
they suspected the radical nationalist group, the Guerrilla Army of
the Free Galician People.
   The small group seeks independence from Spain for the
four-province northwestern region of Galicia and claimed
responsibilty for a series of bombings in the area in April, police
said.
   The first three explosions occurred just after 3:30 a.m. in
downtown Santiago de Compostela, the capital of the region of
Galicia.
   The blasts ripped through offices of Barclay's Bank, the utility
company Union Electrica Fenosa and Banco de Galicia, police said.
   The blasts shattered windows of buildings adjacent to the
offices and wrecked at least seven cars, police said.
   At nearly the same time in La Coruna, the capital of La Coruna
province, a bomb exploded in the doorway of a centrally located
office of the Banco de Bilbao, heavily damaging the office and
seven cars parked nearby, according to police.
   An hour later in Vigo, a port city on Galicia's eastern coast,
bombs exploded outside offices of Banco Atlantico and the Banco
Pastor, partially destroying the offices but causing no injuries,
police said.
   The seventh bomb exploded in the northern Galician port city of
El Ferrol outside an office of Banco de Bilbao, destroying the
office and heavily damaging several cars parked nearby, police said.

   Two ice-cream sellers have been
ordered to stay away from the market square in this town because
the color of their tricycles clashes with the buildings.
   Councilors say the vanila and strawberry stripes on Lindsey and
Joanne Rastell's tricycles don't match the soft yellow stone
structures built centuries ago in this village of 1,600.
   ``These trikes look like very bright Victorian hat boxes _ they
are just not Campden,'' said councilwoman Juliette Griffiths on
Tuesday. ``If we let them stay, we shall have a fish-and-chip van
next.''
   Joanne Lindsey said the vendors would fight the move. ``We have
got a trading license from Cotswold district council and we plan to
stay,'' she said.

<HEAD>Shamir Kicks Off Campaign, Vows to Block Palestinian State</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAN IZENBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir vowed to foil
Palestinian dreams of an independent state but called for a
dialogue with leaders in the occupied territories as he launched
his campaign against the rival Labor Party.
   Shamir, leader of the right-wing Likud bloc, said Tuesday that a
victory for his party in the Nov. 1 national elections ``would put
an end to the delusions regarding an independent Palestinian state
or a provisional (Palestinian) government.''
   He said a Likud victory also would send a message to ``all Arab
rioters ... and the terrorist organizations controlling them, that
they do not stand a chance of fulfilling their goals and plots.''
   Palestinians have been rioting in the occupied West Bank and
Gaza Strip since Dec. 8. More than 250 Palestinians have been
killed. Four Israelis have died.
   Israel captured the Gaza Strip from Egypt and the West Bank from
Jordan in the 1967 Middle East War.
   The Palestine Liberation Organization, under pressure to fill
the vacuum left by Jordan's King Hussein when he dropped claims to
the West Bank in July, has said it may declare a Palestinian state
in the occupied lands or a government in exile.
   About 3,000 right-wing supporters, some waving Israeli flags,
cheered as Shamir criticized the left-of-center Labor Party, which
advocates trading land for peace with Palestinians.
   In a bid for crucial support from religious voters, the
non-observant Shamir donned a skullcap at the end of his speech and
read a special prayer recited before the Jewish New Year, which
begins next week. Skullcaps are worn by observant Jews.
   If elected, Shamir said, he would immediately ``invite the
leaders of Egypt and Jordan and Palestinians in Judea and Samaria
(the biblical names for the occupied West Bank) and Gaza to
negotiate directly for peace on the basis of the Camp David
agreements,'' which call for limited Palestinian autonomy.
   ``Each side will be able to raise any issue as long as we don't
stop talking until all possibilities for peace have been
exhausted,'' he said.
   He said the Palestinian uprising had not changed his mind about
the need to negotiate autonomy.
   ``We know many (Palestinians) are taking part in the acts of
hostility and hatred against Israel,'' Shamir said. ``But we also
know many understand that the path of violence will only heap
tragedy and suffering upon them.''
   Shamir said Likud would step up the construction of Jewish
settlements in the occupied territories ``until there is absolutely
no doubt in anyone's mind that we have returned to our ancestral
homeland.''
   Jewish settlement slowed under the current Labor-Likud coalition
government because Labor opposes Jewish settlements in densely
populated Arab areas of the occupied territories.
   Shamir said his government would strengthen ties between Israel
and the United States, and he scorned Labor for saying that his
hard-line policies would create a rift with Washington.
   ``Our relations have never been better or closer than during the
Likud era,'' said Shamir.

   Gov. Dick Bryan crushed three
Democratic rivals for the right to challenge Sen. Chic Hecht in
November as the Republican senator easily won his party's primary.
   Vietnam war hero James ``Bo'' Gritz, who has made forays into
Southeast Asia in search of POWs, lost his bid for a seat in the
U.S. House of Representatives to Republican Party activist Lucille
Lusk.
   With all precincts reporting in Tuesday's Democratic primary,
Bryan, 51, garnered 61,987 votes or 80 percent. ``None,'' an option
listed on the ballot, came in second with 6,991 votes or 9 percent.
   Trailing the 51-year-old governor and ``None'' were Patrick
Fitzpatrick with 4,691 votes or 6 percent, Manford ``Cave Rock
Manny'' Beals with 2,651 votes or 3 percent, and Larry Kepler with
1,650 votes or 2 percent.
   Hecht, 59, defeated Larry Scheffler, owner of a graphics
business in Henderson who said he would press for reprocessing
nuclear waste brought to Nevada so that only low-level, less
radioactive waste would remain.
   Hecht had 55,352 votes or 82 percent, Scheffler had 5,617 votes
or 8 percent, and 6,454 voters or 10 percent favored ``None.''
   ``Now the primary is over and we're gearing up for this race,''
said Hecht, who is seeking a second term. ``You're going to see the
most exciting race Nevada has ever had.''
   Bryan, who is serving his second term, said he looked forward
``to the challenge that lies ahead ... We feel that we've generated
some momentum but as we've said from the very beginning this is
going to be a very tough race.''
   In the GOP House primary, Lusk received 12,075 votes or 48
percent to 10,715 votes or 42 percent for Gritz and 2,562 votes or
10 percent for retiree John Kraft. The Democratic incumbent, Jim
Bilbray, had no opposition.
   ``We needed a larger voter turnout,'' said Gritz.
   Gritz said of his main opponent, ``Lucille would be much better
in the home than in the House _ of Representatives, that is.''
   Ms. Lusk said she was ``ready to take on Mr. Bilbray. As for
Gritz, she said, ``I think what I believe is more believable than
what he believes.''
   In the Senate race, Hecht has become known for verbal miscues,
once referring to a ``nuclear suppository'' when he meant
``repository'' and on another occasion saying he had debated
``diametric materialism'' with a Soviet official, when he meant
``dialectic.''
   A recent survey of Senate administrative assistants ranked him
as the least effective senator in Washington.
   Hecht has attacked Bryan as being too pro-labor and said: ``I
brought out what this campaign is about. The out-of-state labor
bosses want to control the Senate.''
   Bryan responded that Hecht has resorted to inaccuracies and
cliches instead of specifics. He also said only about 10 percent of
his contributions come from labor and Hecht was incorrect to say 42
percent of all contributions came from labor groups.
   Bryan said he has received about $189,000 from labor out of $1.8
million in contributions and ``I don't care if you're using the old
math or new math ... that works out to 10.4 percent.''

<HEAD>Defiant City Councilmen Refuse To Budge As Fines Mount</HEAD>
<DATELINE>YONKERS, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   City officials have paid a $192,000 fine
and face million-dollar penalties by week's end, but the mayor says
prospects look bleak for a quick settlement of an impasse over
housing desegregation.
   ``I'm sorry to report that there hasn't been any significant
movement,'' Mayor Nicholas Wasicsko said Tuesday. ``The court is
standing firm but the councilmen say they want some concessions
before they comply. The two sides are considerably far apart.''
   Meanwhile, Westchester District Attorney Carl A. Vergari
declined to prosecute the four councilmen who have refused to vote
for the court-ordered housing desegregation plan.
   He said he has doubts about the ``constitutionality of a statute
which criminalizes the act of voting'' and he cited Gov. Mario
Cuomo's refusal to remove them from office pending court appeals.
   Vergari had been asked to act by the Emergency Financial Control
Board, a state panel that has taken over Yonkers' finances.
   At issue is U.S. District Judge Leonard Sand's order that
Yonkers build low- and moderate-income housing, which grew out of
Sand's 1985 finding that Yonkers for decades had intentionally
segregated schools and public housing.
   The city schools were desegregated under a plan approved by
Sand, and the City Council agreed in January to develop 1,000 units
of housing.
   But under enormous community pressure, four councilmen _ Peter
Chema, Nicholas Longo, Henry Spallone and Edward Fagan _ voted Aug.
1 to block one portion of the plan.
   Sand levied escalating fines against the city _ $100 for the
first day and doubling every day after that. He also fined the
nay-voting councilmen and threatened them with jail.
   The penalties were stayed pending appeal. Last week, the U.S.
Supreme Court reinstated the fines against the city with a cap of
$1 million a day, but continued the stay of the councilmen's
punishment.
   A $192,000 fine was paid Tuesday. If the fines were to continue
through the week, Yonkers would owe $204,800 by late today. By
Friday, the city would reach the $1 million daily cap. Bankruptcy
would arrive Nov. 12, according to city officials.
   No face-to-face meetings took place Tuesday, but key figures in
the crisis of the state's fourth-largest city were in touch by
telephone, including City Council members, the National Association
for the Advancement of Colored People, the Justice Department and
the offices of Cuomo and Sand.

   Navy personnel and civilian workers on tiny
Midway Island 1,300 miles northwest of here have made preparations
to ride out Hurricane Uleki, the commanding officer said.
   ``We've secured all the equipment and made the preparations we
need to make, and we're ready it ride it out,'' said Lt. Cmdr.
Gibson McMillan, officer in charge of the Navy base on the
two-square-mile island where the highest elevation is about 30 feet.
   ``We anticipate the possibility of hurricane force winds in 24
to 36 hours,'' he said in a telephone interview.
   Midway is home for about 300 sailors and contracted civilian
employees who share the island with thousands of gooney birds. Navy
dependents no longer live on the island.
   Hurricane Uleki's strong winds could hit the northern-most
islands in the Hawaiian Chain today. The islands include Midway and
Kure Atoll, where the 22 Coast Guard personnel maintain a
navigation station.
   At 8 p.m. Tuesday, the hurricane was 1,000 miles west of
Honolulu, moving west-northwest at 14 mph with winds at 75 mph and
gusts 90 mph, the National Weather Service said.
   The storm was forecast to maintain hurricane strength during the
next 12 to 24 hours and to gradually turn north within 18 to 24
hours.
   The weather service said some of the stronger fringe winds on
the north side of Uleki might reach Lisianski Island early today
and Midway and Kure Atoll later in the day.
   Uleki, at one time packing winds gusting to 150 mph, approached
to about 300 miles of the major Hawaiian Islands of Oahu, Kauai and
Niihau during the Labor Day weekend, before veering away to the
west and then moving northwest, parallel to the 1,500-mile-long
chain.

<HEAD>Tammy Bakker Spills Heart In Letter To Supporters</HEAD>
<DATELINE>COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Tammy Faye Bakker said in a fund-raising
letter to 400,000 people that her husband lay in a fetal position
for hours while she prayed for death and could not stop crying
after their departure from the PTL ministry.
   ``I did not know I could cry so hard,'' she wrote in a packet
asking for donations to help the couple buy back the ministry. ``I
did not know I could laugh so loudly. I did not know I could
dislike God so much. I did not know I could love God so much.''
   Mrs. Bakker's thoughts on leaving the ministry last year in the
midst of her husband's sex-and-money scandal are contained in a
four-page brochure on its way to supporters. The State newspaper of
Columbia printed excerpts in today's editions.
   The packet contains a letter from Bakker asking for donations
ranging from $25 to $1,000. Contributors are promised a copy of
Mrs. Bakker's new album, ``Peace in the Midst of the Storm.''
   The appeal is part of Bakker's effort to buy back the ministry
he abandoned after acknowledging a sexual affair with church
secretary Jessica Hahn.
   The ministry filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the
bankruptcy code two months after Bakker left in March 1987. Bakker
now appears to be the leading contender to buy it back.
   Bankruptcy Trustee M.C. ``Red'' Benton extended from Tuesday to
Thursday a deadline for Bakker to raise $3 million to demonstrate
he can make good on his offer of $172 million for the ministry's
assets. Benton had said Friday that if the $3 million wasn't
available by Tuesday he would be forced to consider other bids.
   Bakker said he was about $100,000 short of raising the $3
million in cash and letters of credit.
   Benton will recommend a proposed buyer to U.S. Bankruptcy Judge
Rufus Reynolds, who must approve any sale. Reynolds set a Saturday
deadline for submission of bids.
   Bakker and Benton told reporters Tuesday after an hourlong
meeting they were still working out final details of a contract for
Bakker to buy PTL's assets, which include the Heritage USA
Christian theme park and hotel complex, a satellite TV network and
undeveloped property near the Fort Mill ministry.
   Bakker said supporters nationwide are pledging money for the
purchase.
   ``It's the most fantastic thing I've ever seen,'' he said.
   Benton has given Bakker until Friday to present him with the
details of Bakker's deal with a group of Greek businessmen Bakker
says are backing his bid.
   The trustee said he has ``four or five'' other bids for PTL
besides Bakker's, along with an an offer of $113 million by
Canadian real estate executive Peter Thomas.
   Mrs. Bakker told reporters Tuesday she was ``so excited'' about
the possibility of returning to the couple's TV show that she was
rehearsing her opening song.
   ``It will be `The Sun Will Shine Again,''' she said.
   In the mailing, Mrs. Bakker described her feelings after Bakker
admitted his sexual misconduct and turned PTL over to the Rev.
Jerry Falwell. The Bakkers later left their Tega Cay parsonage and
moved to Gatlinburg, Tenn.
   ``My stomach was so sick all the time I could not even
swallow,'' she wrote. ``I didn't want to wake up in the morning. I
prayed to die!''
   ``Where was God? Did He care that I was hurting so bad. Did He
care that Jim would lie curled up in a fetal position for hour
after hour.''
   She also recalled her reaction when Falwell asked the Bakkers to
leave their Tega Cay parsonage.
   ``I heard those words and terror gripped my heart. ... We had
raised our children there, we had put our marriage back together in
that house. Max and Snuggles and Muffie, our dogs, were playing in
their yard! Tinkerbell and Hooter, our kittens, were there. ...
   ``How I longed for my bed! The place of safety for me. Our place
of rest after a hard day!''

   The American Legion says it's too soon to
forgive or forget Jane Fonda's visit to Hanoi during the Vietnam
War despite her recent apology to veterans on national television.
   Legionnaires ``do not believe her apology was in any way sincere
and was only stated on the TV program as a ruse to further enhance
her many commercial undertakings,'' said a resolution adopted
Tuesday at the veterans group's 70th annual convention.
   Many ``of America's fighting men and women lost their lives,
were wounded, tortured and suffered in many other ways because of
Jane Fonda's dealing with the enemy,'' the resolution.
   Ms. Fonda, who has made a career both as a film actress and
physical fitness enthusiast, offered the apology for her excesses
as a 1960s anti-war activist on ABC-TV's ``20-20'' news program
this summer.
   During the Vietnam War, she made a much-publicized trip to North
Vietnam, where she called on U.S. servicemen to quit fighting.
   The Legion's resolution, presented by the organization's
Americanism Commission, was approved on the convention floor on a
voice vote without discussion, but with apparent enthusiasm.
   Last month, the Veterans of Foreign Wars also rejected Ms.
Fonda's apology at the group's convention in Chicago, and adopted a
resolution calling on Congress to try her for treason.

   The dollar was mixed in thin early European
trading today. Gold prices fell.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends as Europe's business day begins,
the dollar fell sharply to close at 134.30 yen, down 1.30 yen.
Later, in London, it was quoted at 133.90 yen.
   The dollar's decline in Tokyo was widely attributed to the Bank
of Japan's short-term economic forecast that reported the Japanese
economy has been and will be growing without inflation.
   Foreign currency dealers said trading in Frankfurt, West
Germany, was also dominated by dollar-yen movements. After the
dollar rose to peaks of 1.8480 marks and 134.70 yen in the Far
East, Japanese investors began unloading it and pushed the U.S.
currency back, dealers said.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning, compared with late Tuesday:
   _1.8418 West German marks, down from 1.8425
   _1.5540 Swiss francs, up from 1.5525
   _6.2725 French francs, up from 6.2715
   _2.0796 Dutch guilders, down from 2.0820
   _1,375.50 Italian lire, down from 1,377.65
   _1.2370 Canadian dollars, up from 1.2340
   In London, the dollar fell slightly against the British pound.
One pound cost $1.7050, compared with $1.7035 late Tuesday.
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $428.00 a troy ounce,
down from $428.10 bid late Tuesday. At midmorning today, the city's
five major bullion dealers fixed a recommended price of $427.
   Bullion dealers said the precious metal was trapped in tight
ranges, amid a lack of investor interest and the offsetting
influences of a weaker dollar and weaker oil prices.
   The bid price for gold in Zurich was also $427, down from $428
bid late Tuesday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold rose $1.04 to close at a bid $430.19.
   Silver was quoted in London at a bid price of $6.49 a troy
ounce, down from Tuesday's $6.56.

<HEAD>Stationary Front Continues to Drench Florida</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   A stationary front continued to hit Florida with strong winds
and heavy rain today, causing widespread flooding of lowland areas
and minor beach erosion along the state's central Gulf Coast.
   Cool air, meanwhile, spread over part of the nation's
midsection, breaking temperature records as far south as Arkansas.
   The stationary front has been drenching Florida since Sunday,
with some west-central areas getting 5 to 10 inches and Yankeetown
on the Gulf Coast receiving more than 13 inches.
   ``All the rivers around here are over their banks,'' said Coast
Guard Petty Officer Eric Hermann in the Yankeetown station.
``There's a lot of street flooding and stuff. We're just waiting
for high tide tonight.''
   The rains flooded roads in the Tampa-St. Petersburg area and
curbed voter turnout in the state's primary elections. A flood
warning was issued for the St. Mary's River in northeast Florida,
which is expected to crest Thursday.
   Record cold settled on parts of the Mississippi and Ohio
valleys. Jonesboro, Ark., had an early morning reading of 51
degrees, breaking by one degree its record low for this date, while
Evansville, Ind., also broke its old record low by one degree with
a reading of 46.
   Smoke from forest fires spread across western and central
Montana, and ash from fires was falling at Great Falls, Mont.
   Today's forecast called for showers and thunderstorms along the
South Carolina and Georgia coasts and across the Florida Peninsula,
cloudy skies over northwest Washington state and generally sunny
skies elsewhere. Strong, gusty winds were forecast for the northern
Rockies, the upper Missouri Valley, the Dakotas and the upper
Mississippi Valley.
   Highs were expected to be in the upper 50s in northern Maine; in
the 60s in the rest of New England and the Middle Atlantic States;
in the 60s and 70s from northern Montana to Washington and northern
Oregon and along much of the California coast; in the 90s in the
southern and central Plains; and in the 90s to about 105 degrees in
the desert Southwest, eastern California, western Nevada and
southwest Oregon. Highs elsewhere were predicted to be in the 80s.
   At 3 a.m. EDT, temperatures ranged from 37 degrees at Marquette,
Mich., to 87 degrees at Las Vegas, N.V., and Phoenix, Ariz.

   Israeli officials freed four Palestinian
guerrillas who were jailed after being captured off the coast of
Lebanon last year and flew them to Switzerland, the army command
said today.
   The four were among 50 Palestine Liberation Organization
guerrillas taken prisoner in February 1987 after the navy captured
a boat, the Maria R, en route from Cyprus to Lebanon.
   An army spokeswoman said all the guerrillas have been sentenced
to varying terms in jail. She did not elaborate.
   The four guerrillas released have completed their prison terms,
she said, adding that they were taken to Switzerland Tuesday night
to allow them to return to Arab countries.

<HEAD>Kelly McGillis, Kerry Kennedy Take Over Chavez Fast</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Actress Kelly McGillis and Kerry Kennedy,
daughter of slain Sen. Robert Kennedy, are the latest in a series
of celebrities to carry on the anti-pesticide fast of United Farm
Workers President Cesar Chavez.
   By fasting for three days each, the celebrities are supporting
Chavez's boycott of California table grapes in protest of allegedly
dangerous pesticides used on the fruit.
   Chavez began the water-only fast in Delano, Calif., on July 16
over the dangers allegedly caused to workers and consumers by five
pesticides: captan, dinoseb, methyl bromide, parathon and phosdrin.
   After 36 days, Chavez turned the fast over to the Rev. Jesse
Jackson.
   Since then, Jackson has passed the protest along to Southern
Christian Leadership Conference President Joseph Lowery, who passed
it to actor Martin Sheen, before it went to Sheen's son, actor
Emilio Estevez and ``Miami Vice'' star Edward James Olmos.
   On Tuesday, Estevez passed the fast to ``Top Gun'' star Ms.
McGillis, Ms. Kennedy and Tommy Tang, a well-known chef, outside a
supermarket.
   After completing her three days, Ms. Kennedy will turn the fast
over to Lou Diamond Phillips, Estevez's co-star in the movie
``Young Guns.'' Ms. McGillis has not decided who will receive the
fast from her, said C.C. Goldwater, a spokesperson for the event.
   Adam Ortega, a spokesman for the California Table Grape
Commission, dismissed the fast as ``mainly for publicity purposes''
and denied there was any danger in eating California grapes.
   ``Every government test has demonstrated California table grapes
are safe and delicious,'' said Ortega. ``They're simply trying to
scare people away.''

<HEAD>Spy Satellites OK Despite Reported Explosion Of Rocket's First
Stage</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LEE SIEGEL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The reported explosion of a Titan 2 rocket
stage as it fell away from a booster did not prevent four Navy spy
satellites from climbing toward their proper orbits, sources said.
   ``The satellites are moving exactly as they should be,'' an Air
Force source said Tuesday, speaking on condition of anonymity.
``Everything is just peachy.''
   The satellites were launched from Vandenberg Air Force Base 140
miles northwest of Los Angeles on Monday atop a 103-foot-high,
liquid-fueled Titan 2. The Lompoc Record newspaper, quoting ground
observers, reported Tuesday that the Titan 2's expended first stage
apparently blew up in a secondary explosion after separating from
the booster's second stage. The rest of the booster was seen
continuing skyward.
   A second source, also insisting on anonymity, told The
Associated Press that the satellites were not endangered.
   Neither source could confirm the secondary explosion, but said
they wouldn't necessarily know of such an event if it didn't affect
deployment of the satellites.
   ``I checked into it and everything I know is positive,'' said
Capt. Marty Hauser, an Air Force public affairs officer at the
Pentagon. ``It went well.''
   The observers, who were very familiar with launch procedures,
believed the crimson flash resulted from a puncture in a nearly
empty oxidizer tank on the the $37.5 million rocket's first stage,
according to the Record.
   The newspaper said similar anomalies happened after launches of
other rockets at Vandenberg without preventing their payloads from
reaching orbit.
   Capt. Norma Payne, a Vandenberg spokeswoman, would not discuss
whether an explosion occurred or whether the secret payload reached
proper orbit.
   ``We're not going to comment on the results of a (classified)
space flight,'' she said.
   Space policy expert John Pike of the Federation of American
Scientists has identified the Titan 2's payload as a White Cloud
Navy Ocean Surveillance System of four satellites which would be
used to listen to the Soviet fleet's radar and radio communications.
   Four or five sets of White Clouds _ about 16 to 20 satellites _
already are in orbit, with the new set likely meant to replace
aging White Clouds launched in the early 1980s, Pike said.
   The rocket was the first of a series of refurbished Titan 2
intercontinental ballistic missiles to be used as a space booster.
The missiles were originally deployed in silos in Arkansas, Kansas
and Arizona in the 1960s, but were removed because of corrosion and
other aging problems.
   The Air Force decided to refurbish Titan 2 as space boosters
because it was cheaper than building new rockets.
   On Monday, Payne called the Titan 2 liftoff ``a spectacular
launch with all systems operating as expected,'' but said officials
would not know for two to three days whether the payload achieved
its intended polar orbit circling the Earth from North to South
poles.
   Last Friday, a satellite said to be designed for intercepting
Soviet communications was launched by a $65 million Titan 34D
rocket from Cape Canaveral, Fla. A source close to the project, who
spoke on condition of anonymity, said the satellite failed to
achieve its desired stationary orbit when the rocket's upper stage
failed to re-ignite. He said there was little hope of salvaging
that mission.

<HEAD>Police Seize A Second Tape of Archbishop's Defiant Sermon</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Security police today seized a
second recording of a defiant sermon by Archbishop Desmond Tutu,
and a pro-government newspaper said authorities should not be
reluctant to prosecute him.
   Officers with a search warrant came to the Argus, a Cape Town
morning newspaper, and seized a tape recording its religion
reporter made of a sermon Sunday in which Tutu called for a boycott
of local elections slated for next month. State-of-emergency
regulations forbid such calls.
   On Tuesday, two plainclothes officers went to the Anglican
archbishop's official residence in Cape Town and seized a recording
of the sermon that Tutu's press aide, John Allen, had made.
   In the sermon at St. George's Cathedral in Cape Town, Tutu urged
whites and blacks to boycott nationwide municipal elections
scheduled for Oct. 26. Many blacks oppose participation in any
local or regional elections until the black majority is allowed to
vote in national elections.
   A pro-government Johannesburg daily, The Citizen, said Tutu
``has invited the government to prosecute him ... to achieve the
status of a martyr.''
   ``He is well aware that if he is prosecuted, the world spotlight
will be on him, that the court case will be reported far and wide,
that his status internationally will be enhanced, and that South
Africa itself will suffer tremendous harm when he, as head of the
Anglican Church in southern Africa, as Nobel Peace laureate, is
placed in the dock,'' the newspaper said.
   ``Whatever the consequences, his defiance cannot be allowed,''
The Citizen said. ``To us, he will be the man who has harmed his
country, his church, his people.''
   Another Johannesburg paper, Business Day, today advised the
government to ignore Tutu. ``He would be furious,'' the paper said.
   Violation of emergency regulations is punishable by up to 10
years in prison.
   Tutu said Sunday that he was aware of the penalties. ``I am not
defying the government, I am obeying God,'' he said.
   The Oct. 26 elections for councilors in South Africa's racially
segregated municipalities will mark the first time that voters of
all races go to the polls on the same day.
   The white-controlled government is depicting the elections as a
major step toward democracy and is spending hundreds of thousands
of dollars on advertising to encourage a large turnout.

   A newlywed whose four-month disappearance
with her husband prompted a nationwide search was in serious
condition today after an automobile accident.
   Loyola University Medical Center said it could not provide
details of Carolyn MacLean Swanson's injuries. Her husband, Scott,
23, requested that officials keep the incident quiet.
   ``He is absolutely anti- any media right now,'' said nursing
supervisor Diane Keating. ``He didn't even want her identity
released.''
   WMAQ-TV reported that Mrs. Swanson, 22, was injured Tuesday in a
two-car collision in Wheaton, a suburb west of Chicago. The other
car was driven by a 16-year-old girl, WMAQ said. Local police had
no comment.
   The Swansons, once students at Wheaton College, a private
Christian school, eloped and were secretly married a week before
they disappeared April 2.
   Their ransacked luxury auto was found in an alley in downtown
Chicago with the motor still running, leading to fears of foul play.
   Searches in Michigan, Indiana and Illinois found no trace of the
couple. They turned up unharmed July 27 in San Diego, where they
said they had been living under assumed names, trying to enjoy
``perfect love.''

<TEXT>
   Police arrested 21 suspected leftist terrorists and
seized guns and grenades in a major sweep in the Rome area before
dawn today, officials announced.
   Some 200 Carabinieri, or paramilitary police, carried out the
early morning operation, staging raids on four apartments in the
city and suburban areas, said Gen. Roberto Jucci, commander of the
Carabinieri.
   Many of the suspects were surprised in their sleep and officials
said they encountered no resistance.
   Jucci said 12 of those arrested are believed to be members of
the Formation of the Fighting Communist Party, the most dangerous
and active group of what remains of the Red Brigades terrorist gang.
   The group has been implicated in several assassinations over the
past two years, including the killing in April of Sen. Roberto
Ruffilli, a close friend and adviser of Premier Ciriaco De Mita.
   ``This is a severe blow (to the Red Brigades). We hope this will
keep them from commiting futher atrocities,'' Jucci told a news
conference.
   The Carabinieri declined to disclose specific charges against
those arrested, saying the suspects were still being questioned.
The 21 arrested include five women.
   Italo Leopizzi, another Carabinieri official, said 16 pistols,
21 detonators and a large number of hand grenades and rifles were
seized in the pre-dawn sweep, along with $140,000 in cash.

   The MTV Music Video Awards,
started five years ago as a kind of party to celebrate the instant
success of the video clip format, enters the big leagues tonight
with its 1988 show.
   The 2{-hour show at Universal Amphitheater features performances
by a mix of acts whose first blast of success or career revivals
are largely owed to MTV.
   Among those scheduled to perform on the show either live or by
satellite are Aerosmith, Guns 'n' Roses, Elton John, Rod Stewart,
INXS, Crowded House, Depeche Mode, The Fat Boys and Jody Watley.
   Fitting into neither the new star nor the revived career
category is Academy Award winner Cher, who like many of the awards
show performers is also a nominee.
   Superstar Michael Jackson, for instance, is scheduled to perform
via satellite and receive the 1988 Video Vanguard Award for career
contributions to the medium.
   Jackson rose to superstardom with MTV in 1983 with his
``Thriller'' and ``Beat It'' videos. His ``Bad'' and ``The Way You
Make Me Feel'' videos are nominated this year.
   Jackson's award and a Viewer's Choice award, picked by MTV
viewers the night of the awards by dialing a special ``900''
telephone number, join 15 nominated categories.
   Top nominees are videos from the high-energy Australian pop
group INXS with eight, including best video and best group video
for ``Need You Tonight-ediate,'' and former Beatle George Harrison,
whose videos have five nods, including best video and and best male
performance on a video for ``When We Was Fab'' and ``Got My Mind
Set On You,'' respectively.
   The host is comedian Arsenio Hall, co-star of ``Coming to
America.'' The presenters include Justine Bateman, Cyndi Lauper,
Belinda Carlisle, Suzanne Vega, Los Angeles Laker Earvin ``Magic''
Johnson and Sam Kinison, among others.
   The show will be broadcast live on MTV, and has also been sold
into syndication for airing at a later date on non-cable stations.
   The awards categories are divided into general video nominations
and professional sections, the latter dealing with technical
achievements.

<HEAD>Bentsen Urged Truman to Consider Atomic Bombs in Korea</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By EVANS WITT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Political Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Three weeks after the Korean War began in
1950, then-Rep. Lloyd Bentsen urged President Truman to threaten an
American atomic attack on ``principal North Korean cities'' if the
invading communist forces did not withdraw from South Korea.
   Bentsen, now the Democratic vice presidential candidate but then
a freshman congressman, was among the first Washington figures to
advocate use of nuclear weapons in Korea. Others were to speak out
in agreement, but neither President Truman nor, later, President
Eisenhower ever voiced their support.
   In an interview Tuesday, Bentsen said he is ``older and wiser''
now and would not do the same again.
   North Korean troops invaded South Korea on June 25, 1950.
American and South Korean troops were caught by surprise and
suffered heavy casualties as they retreated.
   In remarks to the House of Representatives on July 12, 1950,
Bentsen said the president should make clear ``that the United
States stands ready to use full military might to stop aggression,
that the atomic bomb awaits those who would violate the peace of
free men.''
   ``My suggestion may result in my being labeled an alarmist or an
extremist,'' he said, ``but if it should result in an earlier end
to this warfare and the saving of American lives, as I believe it
will, then I mind not the labels.''
   Bentsen, then just 29 years old, said: ``We are fighting this
battle with one hand tied behind us. Let us use everything we can
to end this war now.'' He ``drew cheers in the House'' with the
speech, says the edition of ``Facts on File'' for that week 38
years ago.
   Bentsen, now 67 and the senior senator from Texas, called for a
difficult and deadly decision by Truman as communist troops pushed
American and United Nations forces back.
   ``I propose our commander-in-chief, the president of the United
States, advise the commander of the North Korean armies to withdraw
his troops to the north side of the 38th Parallel within one week
or use that week to evacuate a named list of principal North Korean
cities which would be subjected to atomic attack by our Air
Force,'' Bentsen said.
   ``There are those who will recoil in horror and condemn such
action,'' he added. ``To those who will speak and write against
this suggested action I ask: Why not do it now, rather than six
months from now wishing we had done it?''
   Bentsen repeated his sentiments before cameras on the Capitol
steps, and a film clip appeared in a 1982 documentary, ``The Atomic
Cafe.''
   Fifteen days after Bentsen's suggestion, Truman answered a flat
``No'' when asked if he were considering the use of nuclear weapons
in Korea. But after the Chinese entered the war in November 1950,
Truman's public stance changed. ``There has always been active
consideration of its use,'' he said of the atomic bomb.
   Bentsen, explaining his stance in the interview Tuesday, said
Eisenhower ``used that same threat'' to bring the North Koreans to
bargain.
   ``At the time, you have to remember, we were losing 50,000
Americans and the Marines were really being booted around and we
were being kicked off the peninsula,'' he said. ``So you have to
put it in the time period, and at that time we controlled the
bomb.''
   Asked if he would do the same now, he answered: ``I must say,
I'm an older and wiser man.''
   Bentsen spokesman Mike McCurry said the Dukakis campaign was
aware of Bentsen's remarks when Dukakis chose him as his running
mate.
   The Korean war was to last until July 27, 1953, when a truce
began as the first step in peace talks. U.S. losses were put at
54,660 killed and 103,284 wounded.
   Questions of age and judgment have been raised in the 1988
presidential campaign by Bentsen, who has suggested that the
Republican vice presidential nominee, 41-year-old Sen. Dan Quayle
of Indiana, is not seasoned enough to be a heartbeat from the
presidency.

   A prison escapee who called himself and
his girlfriend a modern-day ``Bonnie and Clyde'' crime team was
found sleeping in a stolen car and arrested by an Ohio State
Highway Patrol trooper.
   Vincent Bruce, 26, escaped Aug. 26 from the Cook County Jail in
Chicago, where he faced armed robbery charges, by using a bar of
soap carved and blackened to resemble a gun, officials said. Bruce
pulled the gun on an unarmed guard who was escorting him to a
hospital for treatment.
   Bruce and his girlfriend, Catherine Reed, 29, called themselves
a modern-day ``Bonnie and Clyde'' after Depression-era gangsters
Bonnie Parker and Clyde Barrow, who killed at least 13 people,
authorities said.
   Ms. Reed was arrested last summer in Cincinnati in the slayings
of three alleged drug dealers in the Los Angeles-area slayings.
Police in Los Angeles said Bruce, who is also sought in the
slayings, was a ``real violent, mean type.'' A third suspect in the
case has been arrested and is awaiting trial.
   Highway Patrol Sgt. Dick Wells said Bruce was found asleep in a
stolen car at a rest area of Interstate 70 near Newark in central
Ohio around 5 a.m. Tuesday. Licking County authorities are working
with police from Chicago and Los Angeles to have Bruce extradited,
Well said.

<NOTE>Eds: UPDATES thruout with details of troops movements and more
evacuations of embassy dependents.

<TEXT>
   Army trucks loaded with armed troops
patrolled the capital's main streets today with orders to shoot
looters, who were sacking government buildings, factories and
warehouses.
   The U.S. Embassy in Rangoon ordered an evacuation of 95 American
dependents as a ``precautionary measure,'' said Ross Petzing, the
U.S. Embassy spokesman in Bangkok. There were no reports that any
of the approximately 55 U.S. Embassy staff members would leave.
   Diplomatic sources said the Italian, Israeli and several other
small embassies sent out dependents in recent days and that the
Japanese and larger Western embassies were considering evacuations.
   Petzing said the first group of 45 Americans would arrive in
Bangkok on Thursday if the airport in Rangoon was open.
   Anti-government forces have called for a nationwide strike
Thursday to press demands for an interim government and democracy
and it was believed airport workers would join in the work stoppage.
   ``The streets are deserted, people are pretty much in fear of
their property. Things have pretty much closed down,'' said a
Western diplomat in Rangoon. ``There is a widespread perception
that things have deteriorated.''
   Today was the first time in nearly three weeks that the military
presence has been obvious in Rangoon, where there was looting
Tuesday.
   As the troops rolled in the city, state-run Rangoon Radio
announced that the ``defense forces and the people's police force
shall open fire to impose control should they find that these
looters, bent on violence, continue their acts.''
   It was the first stern warning about intervention to stop
looting, which began outside the city several weeks ago.
   Radio Rangoon said its warning ``does not concern those people
who are demonstrating peacefully,'' referring to pro-democracy
demonstrations against the three-week-old government of President
Maung Maung.
   Looters broke into the Customs Department warehouse, a building
of the Education Department and soap and textile factories. Thieves
were spotted carrying away air conditioners and office equipment
from the Rangoon office of the U.N. Food and Agriculture
Organization.
   A livestock and poultry farm near the city's airport also was
pilfered.
   Many residents closed the doors of their homes and shops, and
traffic was minimal.
   The Western diplomat said the looting was probably the act of
desperate and poor people taking advantage of the breakdown of law
and order rather than an anti-government move. Other analysts
believe disorder is being purposely stoked by authorities to
justify further crackdowns.
   Protesters blame the Burma Socialist Program Party for 26 years
of repression and inept ecoomic policies that have turned Burma
into one of the world's poorest nations.
   Ne Win, who seized power in a military coup 26 years ago, blamed
student unrest in March and June in part for his decision to resign
in July. He was replaced by Sein Lwin, whose appointment sparked
riots in which hundreds of people died.
   Sein Lwin resigned after 17 days and was replaced by Maung
Maung, Burma's first civilian leader since the coup, but protests
have continued.
   Despite a crumbling administration, defections from the ruling
party and signs of dissatisfaction within the powerful military,
the government has refused to budge from its plan for the party
leadership to meet Monday to consider organizing a referendum on
ending one-party rule.
   On Tuesday, 187 Foreign Ministry employees resigned from the
ruling party to protest the government's refusal to bow to the
people's demands.
   Also today, a government newspaper accused a former army major
of using his influence to lure to their deaths 20 students and
Buddhist monks who were behind many of the protests against 26
years of authoritarian rule.
   The Working People's Daily said that Zau Htaung, a former army
major, offered a cash bounty for the heads of students and monks.
It said Zau Htaung persuaded residents of a Rangoon suburb to lure
to a biscuit factory the students and monks, who were members of a
local ``vigilance committee''.
   It said Zau Htaung and 40 other people involved in the deaths
fled after being attacked by a mob, but it said 38 of them were
captured.
   The newspaper did not say whether Zau Htaung acted on his own
initiative or why he had allegedly organized the killings.

<HEAD>Government Goes To Court To Seize Defective Condoms</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The federal government has gone to court
to try to confiscate nearly 50,000 condoms it says are defective.
   The case is believed to mark the first time the federal Food and
Drug Administration has sought to seize a batch of condoms for
destruction.
   The U.S. Attorney's office filed suit in U.S. District Court
here on Tuesday asking the court to order the U.S. Marshal to seize
the condoms from the warehouse of Mentor Corp. of Minneapolis.
   The seizure would include about 44,350 condoms from a batch of
contraceptives made for Mentor by an East Coast factory, said
assistant U.S. Attorney Roylene Champeaux.
   The FDA routinely tests condoms every three months before they
leave manufacturers' warehouses. If more than three condoms of a
batch of 1,000 leak, the batch is declared substandard, said Mentor
spokesman Al Mannino.
   Previously, manufacturers were allowed to destroy the condoms
and file affidavits with the FDA stating they had been destroyed,
he said.
   But the FDA is now taking a much tougher approach to condom
quality control. Government health experts have advised use of
condoms as a preventive measure against the spread of AIDS, or
acquired immune deficiency syndrome.
   Judge Paul Magnuson is expected to sign the seizure order later
this week, Champeaux said. Mentor will have until Nov. 10 to
contest the seizure, according to the government's complaint. If
Mentor does not file a claim for the return of the condoms, the
government will destroy them, Champeaux said.
   ``That would be fine. That would save us the cost of destroying
them,'' said Mannino, who said he was baffled by the government's
action.
   FDA inspectors declared the Mentor batch defective Aug. 1,
Mannino said.
   Mentor, which has headquarters in Minnesota and Santa Barbara,
Calif., makes a variety of implantable devices and health care
products.

<TEXT>
   School maintenance workers hiked the
heat to 120 degrees hoping to get rid of a pesky mold, but the heat
ended up killing plants and lab animals and sending students in
search of cooler classrooms.
   Officials arriving at Lakewood High School Tuesday morning
walked into a stifling heat that had been simmering for three days
in the school's science wing. Floors buckled, students' plants
withered away, tanks of tropical fish perished, as did a turtle, a
snake and at least one favorite lab rat.
   ``There were many students and a teacher who were emotionally
attached to that rat,'' Science Department Chairman Richard
Henderson said Tuesday afternoon, when the wing had cooled down to
a balmy 90 degrees.
   Lakewood Principal Barbara Broughton said she feared computers,
films and other materials also may have been damaged by the heat.
   Workers turned on the heating system in the science wing in an
attempt to dry the area, Ms. Broughton said. The wing has been
experiencing a persistent mold problem in recent years because a
ventilation system has failed to properly dehumidify the building,
she said.
   By raising the temperature, workers hoped to kill the mold
spores and alleviate the problem.
   But Ms. Broughton said she and her teachers were not warned and
animals and plants were not moved.
   ``As soon as (students) walked in here they knew something
wasn't right,'' Henderson said. ``It really was unbearable.''
   School officials scrambled to find cooler rooms for Tuesday's
classes but expected rooms to be cool enough to be used today.
   Maintenance workers won't know for several days whether the heat
treatment solved the mold problem, said Carol Jackson, public
information officer for the Pinellas County schools.

<DATELINE>MOORHEAD, Minn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A boy who survived 45 minutes underwater
in a freezing river has begun a new school year, saying he feels
completely recovered from his icy ordeal.
   ``I'm going to be able to do everything on my own now,'' said
Alvaro Garza Jr., 11, who was trailed Tuesday by reporters and
photographers as he attended his first day of sixth grade.
   He spent his summer ``riding (a) bike, playing baseball, playing
football ... doing a bunch of stuff,'' he said.
   His parents, Alvaro Sr. and Mary Helen Garza, said their son had
recovered from the nerve damage he suffered and no longer required
physical therapy.
   Garza fell through thin ice and into the frigid Red River, which
divides Moorhead from Fargo, N.D., last Dec. 4 as he tried to
retrieve a dead squirrel. When rescuers pulled him from the river,
his body temperature was 77 degrees and he showed no signs of life.
   Doctors used a heart-lung bypass machine to warm his body; four
days later, he communicated by blinking his eyes. He spent 17 days
in the hospital.

<HEAD>Elementary School Adopts Dress Code</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW HAVEN, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An elementary school that draws most of
its pupils from public housing projects will soon require students
to wear uniforms, the school's principal said.
   Parents who refuse to have their children wear the required
attire will face having their children transferred to another
school, school officials said.
   However, William Olds, executive director of the Connecticut
Civil Liberties Union, said requiring uniforms in a public school
is ``blatantly unconstitutional.'' Olds said he doesn't believe the
school system could legally transfer a pupil for failing to comply
with the dress code.
   Although the dress code doesn't take effect until Oct. 3, at
least a dozen boys came to school Tuesday wearing what will be
their required attire: gray pants, white shirts, green ties, and
brown or black shoes.
   ``The girls wanted their dresses today, too. But we told them
they'd have to wait,'' said Jeffie Frazier, principal of the Helene
Grant School, which has about 300 students in kindergarten through
fourth grade.
   Girls will have to wear white blouses, white socks and dark
shoes.
   The dress code is part of an effort to build self-esteem and end
clothing competition, Frazier said. The idea has been so
successful, she said, that 51 families have added their names to a
waiting list to enroll their children in the school.
   Parents who have difficulty affording the uniforms can get
financial aid from community organizations, Frazier said.
   Schools Superintendent John Dow Jr. said he enthusiastically
supports the new dress code. If it proves successful, school
officials added, it may be expanded to other schools.
   About 50 public schools around the nation have adoped dress
codes, among them schools in Baltimore, Washington, D.C., and Perth
Amboy, N.J., according to state and national education officials.

   Mohammed Ali Hamadi gloated after
a U.S. Navy diver was murdered during the hijacking of a TWA
jetliner, an American witness testified today at Hamadi's trial on
air piracy and murder charges.
   The witness, Peter W. Hill, was one of 39 Americans held hostage
for 17 days aboard TWA Flight 847 in June 1985 after it was seized
on a flight from Athens to Rome and diverted to Beirut. U.S. Navy
diver Robert Stethem was shot and killed during the ordeal.
   Hill, 60, testified that after Stethem was killed, Hamadi
started talking to him. ``Hamadi, gloating, said, `This is the gun
that killed him (Stethem).' He seemed quite proud of it.''
   Hill said that was the only time he saw Hamadi with the gun in
his hand.
   Hamadi has admitted he was one of the hijackers but denies
killing Stethem, saying he tried to prevent the slaying.
   Hill, who lived in Hoffman Estates, Ill., at the time of the
hijacking, was the first American to testify at Hamadi's trial.
Hill, who worked for a West German travel agency, was directing a
Holy Land tour for Chicago-area residents.
   He said passengers were forced to put their heads between their
knees for nearly six hours after the flight was hijacked, and that
some were abused.
   ``I was conscious that some passengers were being abused
physically. I couldn't see it because my head was between my knees,
but I heard the sound of slapping,'' Hill testified.
   ``Later when two men were brought back to the economy class I
became aware that they had been subjected to a horrible beating,''
Hill said, identifying them as passengers Curt Carlson and Stethem.
``I could see that Mr. Stethem had been severely beaten.''
   Later, Hill said, ``I heard a muffled sound from the forward
department. I am somewhat of an expert on small arms and I
determined that it was a gunshot. I feared the worst.''
   Stethem's body was then thrown onto the Beirut airport runway.
   Hill testified that Flight 847 pilot John Testrake, of Richmond,
Mo., told him, ``A young man (Stethem) was brutally murdered.''
   ``Every time I think of it, even after three years, I am very
affected.'' Hill said, his voice shaking with emotion.
   Stethem's father, Richard, took notes during Hill's testimony,
and his mother, Patricia, listened with her head bowed.
   Hill said shortly after the murder, 12 men dressed in soldiers'
uniforms came aboard the plane. ``There was definite comradery
between these men, which we later learned were from Amal, and the
hijackers.''
   He added that the hijackers robbed everyone on the plane, taking
money and jewelry from the passengers. ``They became common
thieves, common pirates, and they were drooling over their gains.''
   During testimony Tuesday, Hamadi repeated his claims of
innocence involving Stethem's death, but he refused to identify the
accomplice who he says shot the sailor.
   ``I already said the other (one of his accomplices) was
responsible and he was the murderer,'' Hamadi said.
   ``Our orders were not to kill. We were told to hijack the plane,
to force it to land and to state our demands. But not to kill,''
Hamadi said. He refused to say who issued the orders.
   Transcripts of tapped telephone calls introduced in court
suggested that Hamadi, a Lebanese Shiite Moslem, received help from
Iran in covering his tracks after the hijacking.
   The court heard transcripts of two calls Hamadi made from Iran
to his older brother Abbas, who was living in West Germany. They
indicated Hamadi was in Iran for at least three months after the
hijacking.
   In a telephone call from Iran on Oct. 13, 1985, Mohammed Hamadi
told his brother he was going back to Beirut the next day but Abbas
Hamadi warned him he would be arrested because he was wanted by
U.S. authorities.
   ``We're going on a military plane to Syria and then we're taking
a military car to Beirut,'' Mohammed Hamadi said.
   When Abbas Hamadi asked him who told him that, Mohammed Hamadi
replied: ``The Revolutionary Guards told me,'' referring to Iran's
paramilitary troops.
   Prosecutors say Mohammed Hamadi was a member of Hezbollah, a
radical Lebanese Shiite Moslem group backed by Iran that is
believed to be holding foreign hostages in Lebanon. Hamadi has
denied being a member of the group.
   Hamadi was arrested on Jan. 13, 1987, at Frankfurt airport, when
customs inspectors found explosives in his luggage. He went on
trial here after West Germany refused a U.S. extradition request.
   In April, a West German court sentenced Abbas Hamadi to 13 years
in prison for kidnapping two West German businessmen in Beirut in
an unsuccessful bid to gain his brother's release from prison.

   William Dean Singleton, chief executive officer
of the company that owns The Houston Post, has become the
newspaper's publisher, the Post reported today.
   Singleton, MediaNews Group's vice chairman and chief executive
officer, became publisher of the Post on Tuesday.
   Donald F. Hunt, the former publisher, has been named president
of MediaNews International, a new company owned by Singleton and
MediaNews chairman Richard Scudder, which was formed for
international acquisitions.
   Singleton and Scudder own MediaNews Group, parent company of the
Post, The Denver Post and 47 other newspapers in nine states.
   ``We decided several months ago that we wanted to expand our
operations outside the United States,'' Singleton said. ``Our
newspapers have been very successful here, and there are some good
opportunities in Great Britian and other parts of the world. We
wanted someone with international experience to run the company and
Don has that experience.''
   Hunt held several positions with Canadian newspapers including a
stint as general manager of The Toronto Sun before he moved to
Houston.
   Singleton moved from Dallas to Houston after he announced in
June that MediaNews Group had sold The Dallas Times Herald. At the
same time, he announced that MediaNews Group was moving its
corporate headquarters to Houston.

   Authorities are investigating an Israeli
general for complicity in a draft-dodging scam that has raised a
furor in this country, Israel radio reported today.
   Investigators were looking into the activities of the reserve
general as well as two majors believed to be ringleaders in the
scheme, the radio said. It did not provide their names.
   The disclosure of the inquiry Monday shocked many in this
country where the army is seen as a sacred institution and its
soldiers as heroes for defending the tiny nation against Arab
enemies.
   Police also arrested a new suspect in the case, the radio said.
The suspect, a Tel Aviv doctor whose name was not given, was
reportedly charged with forging medical reports for draft-dodgers.
   He was at least the second physician implicated in the scam.
   An army official, who insisted on anonymity, said he could not
confirm or deny the radio report but added ``now that the
investigation is no longer undercover, it is widening.'' So far, at
least 17 people have been arrested and the army said it was
pursuing dozens more.
   Renaan Gissin, deputy army spokesman, said the draft-dodging
scheme was uncovered Monday with the arrest of 16 people including
high-ranking officers and doctors and ``touches on the very essence
of the Israeli Defense Forces _ the sacred principle here is to do
military service.''
   He said two lieutenant colonels, two majors and an orthopedic
surgeon were among the first group arrested.
   Reports said Monday that about 60 people had paid thousands of
dollars to escape the draft or reserve service, but newspapers
reported Tuesday that several hundred people may be involved.
   ``This is just the tip of the iceberg,'' Gissin said. ``The last
word has not been said.''
   The scheme, which investigators say started in November,
reportedly involved falsified medical statements and tampering with
army computers to show men excused from reserve duty.
   In Israel, a nation of 4.1 million, both men and women are
drafted at age 18. After their three years of duty, men do reserve
service of up to 62 days a year until age 55. Women serve two years
and reserve duty is not obligatory.
   Avoiding service has long been a social taboo, and many
employers ask applicants to prove they served in the army.
   News of the scandal has prompted scathing editorials in many
Israeli newspapers.
   The English-language Jerusalem Post said today: ``The uncovering
of an entire network ... whose beneficiaries may have run into the
hundreds poses a new problem for the army.'' It urged against
``crying havoc'' but called for ``greater vigilance in preventing
the recurrence'' of draft evasion.
   
   There are virtually no conscientious draft resisters in Israel
and fewer than 300 people have refused service during the last
decade in controversial operations in Lebanon or the occupied lands.
   Since Dec. 8, Palestinians in the occupied West Bank and Gaza
Strip have been in revolt against Israel's 21-year occupation. More
than 255 Palestinians and four Israelis have been killed.
   Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin on Tuesday described the
draft-dodging scandal as an aberration, but said he would order a
full investigation of the medical exemption system.
   ``We have to remove this disease from the healthy body of the
army with all means available,'' he said on Israel Television.
``Parallel to that, we have to examine our means of supervision in
the defense system.''
   Politicians on both ends of the political spectrum went further,
urging re-evaluation of Israeli society at a time when values of
the country's pioneer days are being lost.
   ``We must all do a self-evaluation about the type of society
we're building here, a society where everything can be bought with
power or money,'' said Gad Yatsiv of the left-wing Mapam Party.
   Geula Cohen of the right-wing Tehiya Party said the corruption
displayed in the latest scandal was rooted in ``an atmosphere of
materialism and abandonment of the ideals of national
responsibility.''

<HEAD>San Diego Appoints Task Force For Killing Series</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN DIEGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Law enforcement agencies have formed a task
force to investigate the slayings of 30 women since 1985, saying
they were modeling their effort on Washington state's ``Green
River'' task force.
   A task force consisting of detectives and prosecutors has been
working informally since June and was formally appointed Thursday,
San Diego County sheriff's Sgt. Liz Foster said Tuesday.
   Authorities in both San Diego and Seattle have denied published
reports that there is any conclusive link between the San Diego
slayings and the 48 deaths attributed to the Green River killer,
so-called because many of the bodies were found near the
Seattle-area river.
   In both series of killings, the victims were mostly prostitutes
or transients. San Diego investigators believe at least 10 of the
30 unsolved slayings since 1985 are the work of one killer. The
most recent Green River killings occurred in 1984.
   Foster said the task force began working informally after
several meetings between sheriff's officials and members of the
Green River task force.
   San Diego County prosecutors reportedly are obtaining computers
for the task force because their Seattle counterparts recommended
it, The San Diego Union reported.
   The slayings in Washington's King County are the nation's worst
unsolved series of killings. Forty bodies were found around Seattle
and Portland, Ore., and an additional eight women are missing and
feared victims.

   A county judge has barred a woman from
obtaining an abortion during a divorce proceeding, calling her
estranged husband's bid to block the procedure a type of custody
fight.
   The ruling Tuesday blocks Shawn K. Lewis, who is about three
months pregnant, from aborting the fetus conceived after she filed
for divorce from Carlton J. Lewis.
   Lewis had sought the order, claiming that as the father he was
entitled to a say in what happens to the fetus. Mrs. Lewis could
face 45 days in jail and a $100 fine for contempt of court if she
defies the order.
   Genesee County Circuit Judge Valdemar Washington, in a 17-page
ruling, said he issued the injunction because the couple had filed
for divorce and the case ``falls squarely within the jurisdiction
of divorce proceedings.''
   ``In this court's view, this is not a case of mother's right to
terminate pregnancy versus father's rights to veto pregnancy,''
Washington said.
   ``Once that (divorce filing) occurred, an additional
responsibility was placed on the court to look into the interests
of any minor children that the parties may have.''
   He said no Michigan court has ruled on when a fetus becomes a
child, so he must consider the case a custody fight as if the child
already was born.
   Her attorneys said they will seek an emergency hearing before
the state Court of Appeals.
   ``I'm very disappointed,'' said Linda Pylypiw, who represented
the woman on behalf of the American Civil Liberties Union. ``I
don't believe (Washington) ruled on any of the constitutional
issues.''
   Pylypiw said a woman has a right under the 14th Amendment, which
guarantees a right to privacy, to choose abortion during the first
trimester of her pregnancy.
   Steven Moss, attorney for Lewis, hailed the ruling, but said it
would be decided ultimately by higher courts.
   Washington had granted a temporary order halting the abortion
Aug. 8. After considering written arguments, he made the order
permanent Tuesday.
   The hometown of the couple, who are in their 20s, has not been
disclosed.
   The couple have a 16-month-old child, who is living with Mrs.
Lewis.

   An American rabbi is on his way
to East Berlin to conduct Jewish holiday services in the communist
capital, a Jewish community spokesman said.
   Rabbi Herman Dicker of New York, who arrived in Frankfurt today,
is to officiate at Sunday evening services at a synagogue in East
Berlin. The tiny East German Jewish community has no permanent
rabbi.
   Michel Friedman, a spokesman for the Frankfurt Jewish Community,
said Dicker was expected to arrive in Berlin tonight.
   The World Jewish Congress in New York said it had reached an
agreement with the East German government for Dicker to lead
services in observance of the Jewish religious holidays of Rosh
Hashana and Yom Kippur.
   The World Jewish Congress said there were 600 Jews in East
Germany, while other estimates put the population at fewer than 450
people.
   The Hungarian-born Dicker, a research librarian at the Jewish
Theological Seminary in New York, lived in Berlin until he fled in
1936 after the Nazis came to power. He served with U.S. forces that
liberated Nazi concentration camps at the end of World War II, the
World Jewish Conference said.
   The World Jewish Conference said it and the East Berlin Jewish
community were still looking for a permanent rabbi to serve there.
   In September 1987, American Rabbi Isaac Neuman became the first
rabbi in 21 years to be appointed to East Germany. But the
Polish-born Neuman resigned in May after criticizing the Jewish
community leadership for allegedly interfering in his work.

   The South Korean agency said Shin Doo-sup was in serious
condition at a hosptial in Sungnam, about 10 miles south of Seoul,
after brain surgery.
   Shin was among 200 people, most of them college students, who
marched into the streets after a campus rally to oppose the
government of President Roh Tae-woo, the agency said.
   The protesters demanded the arrest of former President Chun
Doo-hwan and his wife, Lee Soon-ja, for alleged involvement in
corruption and financial scandals. Chun stepped down at the end of
a seven-year term in Febuary.
   The protesters hurled rocks at riot police, who retaliated with
tear gas, the report said. Most protesters ran away, but Shin fell
to the ground after being hit by the canister, it said.

compiled by Associated Press bureaus on how the U.S. presidential
election campaign is viewed abroad.

   Here is a sampling of comment in newspapers overseas on the
presidential race between Democrat Michael Dukakis and Republican
George Bush and on Bush's running mate, Sen. Dan Quayle:
</TEXT>
<HEAD>FRANCE</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   _Dominique Nora in Liberation (leftist) of Paris, Sept. 5: ``For
the moment, George Bush seems to be aligning his campaign more on
foreign policy, while Mike Dukakis concentrates on economic themes.
It is true that well-to-do Republican voters don't really need
reassurance in this field. But paradoxally, Bush gets little profit
from the apparent economic health of the country. His strategic
positioning is delicate: he can neither lay claim to a debatable
heritage nor break with existing policy without disavowing his
colleagues and disappointing his supporters. Will he be one of the
first to belie the old rule according to which obvious prosperity
benefits the incumbents?''
</TEXT>
<HEAD>JAPAN</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   _Asahi Shimbun (national, independent), Sept. 1: ``The U.S.
economy has progressed favorably on the surface. Business has seen
nearly six years of expansion, the unemployment rate stands at an
eight-year low. On the other side, however, the external debts are
widning. There is also concern about the recurrence of last
October's `Black Monday'. A trend in the improvement of fiscal and
budget deficits that has continued for some time ... is beginning
to be cloud over. A sense of uneasiness is prevailing within the
United States and people are thinking that things should not be
left they way they are.
   ``Western countries, including Japan, feel the same uneasiness.
...
   ``It is neccessary for the new president, to be elected in
November, to eliminate the uneasiness felt both in and outside the
United States by building up a sound U.S. economy. In concrete
terms, he should restrain excessive consumption and gear up
industry's international competitiveness. ...
   ``The presidential election held every four years is a festival
for the American people as well as an opportunity to check on their
way of living. We hope both candidates and voters would consider
(the nation's) economical responsibility as a superpower.''
</TEXT>
<HEAD>INDIA</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   _The Times of India (national, moderate) of Bombay, Sept. 1:
``The forthcoming U.S. presidential election is disproving the
predictions made earlier by commentators who felt that it would
fail to arouse much popular interest, being viewed by most as a
ho-hum contest between a candidate who was seen as little more than
a `yes-man' to the present incumbent and an opponent perceived to
be as `charismatic as a word processor.' ... The increasingly
popular sport of `Quayling,' which involves beating about the Bush
to flush out the Republican vice presidential candidate's
peccadillos which the media considers fair game to take pot shots
at, has helped allay such qualms.''
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   _The Statesman of Calcutta (north India, conservative), Aug. 31:
``Mr. Quayle is from the far right of the Republican Party, a group
that viewed Mr. Bush's relative moderation as little worse than
apostasy. The choice of the unknown senator has surprised most
observers, though the very fact of his obscurity may be a plus
point for a presidential candidate who so signally lacks charisma.''
</TEXT>
<HEAD>ITALY</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   _Vittorio Zucconi, in La Repubblica (liberal) of Rome, Aug. 31:
``Bush, wrapped in the stars and stripes flag of an electoral
campaign based on `God, Country, Family, and Defense,' is winning
the rhetorical battle in the distance. He does not want to discuss
real problems.
   ``The Democrats are concentrating their efforts on television
debates in order to improve the weak public appeal of the Greek
from Boston.''
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   _Rodolfo Brancoli, in Corriere della Sera (moderate) of Milan,
Aug. 31: ``Probably the majority of the voters have not formed a
clear opinion about the two candidates yet, and are changing their
preferences simply on the basis of their last impressions.
   ``The message of Bush is clear and direct: it is `progress
without risk,' a slogan which is natural for any party in power
which has achieved positive results on the whole.''

<HEAD>Supreme Court Rejects Petition Of Condemned Sikhs In Gandhi Murder</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Adds background.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>NEW DELHI, India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today refused to
review the death sentences of two Sikhs convicted in the 1984
assassination of Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, news reports said.
   Press Trust of India quoted a three-judge panel as saying it
found no reason to review the Aug. 3 judgment upholding the murder
convictions and death sentences.
   Satwant Singh and Kehar Singh have no legal appeal left, but
they can ask President Ramaswamy Venkataraman for mercy. If the
president turns down their pleas, they will be hanged.
   The two, and a third Sikh, Balbir Singh, were convicted of
murder and conspiracy by a trial court in January 1986. The
sentence was upheld by the Delhi High Court in December of that
year.
   The Supreme Court acquitted Balbir Singh in July, saying
evidence against him was scanty.
   ``We have examined and re-examined every material on record,''
Press Trust quoted the judges as saying. ``We see no reason to
entertain the review petitions.''
   The three Sikhs were not related. Singh, which means lion in the
Punjabi language, is added to every male Sikh's name by doctrine of
the faith.
   Mrs. Gandhi was shot and killed in the garden of her New Delhi
residence on Oct. 31, 1984, by Satwant Singh and Beant Singh, both
members of her security staff. Beant Singh was shot by other guards
minutes later, and Satwant Singh was wounded.
   Beant's uncle, Kehar Singh, and Balbir Singh, a policeman, were
arrested on charges of conspiracy.
   The assassination was apparently in revenge for an army attack
Mrs. Gandhi ordered on the Golden Temple, Sikhism's holiest shrine,
which was being used as a base by militants fighting for an
independent Sikh state.
   The campaign, mainly in the northern state of Punjab, still
lingers and has claimed more than 1,800 lives this year. Sikhs
comprise 2 percent of India's 800 million people, but they are in a
majority in Punjab, a rich agriculture state bordering Pakistan.
   The militants claim they are discriminated against by Hindus,
who make up 80 percent of the country's population. They started
their bloody campaign for a Sikh nation in 1982.

<TEXT>
   Fruit growers turned on their irrigation
systems to help fight a fire that exploded by 25,000 acres in 24
hours, threatening Washington's important apple crop.
   The irrigation systems helped keep the fast-growing Dinkleman
Fire from jumping the Entiat River on Tuesday, the last major
barrier between the flames and this central Washington town of 400
residents.
   ``They started up the irrigation systems around their homes,''
said Nick Mickel of the state Department of Natural Resources.
``The irrigation stopped the flames.
   ``That was a major factor in slowing the spread down along the
Entiat River,'' Mickel said. ``That saved those orchards from being
damaged.''
   The fire is concentrated in a narrow canyon in the Cascade
Mountains near the Columbia River, and has raced through heavy
timber and tinder-dry grass along the hillsides. The blaze,
believed to be human-caused, grew from about 160 acres Monday.
   By nightfall Tuesday, the fire had burned between 25,000 and
30,000 acres, destroyed one house and forced the evacuation of a
dozen others. State officials also closed a 40-mile stretch of U.S.
97 between Chelan and Wenatchee because of heavy smoke but
re-opened it late Tuesday night.
   There were no reports of the fire blowing up overnight, U.S.
Forest Service spokesman Ron DeHart said today. A total of 1,100
firefighters and more retardant-dropping aircraft were expected
today.
   The lush green fruit orchards that run for miles along the
opposite bank of the Entiat River remained undamaged. The orchards
are the backbone of the local economy, and would take years to
replace.
   The heavy moisture that collects in the trees and underlying
grass from the irrigation makes the orchards a natural firebreak,
Mickel said.
   The Chelan County Sheriff's Department asked growers along a
five-mile stretch of the river to turn on their sprinklers Monday
night, Mickel said. Many sprinklers remained on Tuesday morning,
and growers also used hoses to wet down the roofs of farmhouses
near the flames.
   At some points the flames were just 400 feet from homes,
climbing spectacularly up the trunks of trees, and heavy smoke
blanketed the entire canyon.
   Bill Self, the owner of Entiat Natural Orchards, credited quick
action by firefighters, rather than his irrigation system, for
saving his house, packing shed and trees.
   Embers flying across the river ignited vegetation above his
property, and winds pushed the flames down toward the buildings, he
said.
   ``Several helicopters and 50 ground crew with bulldozers came
within five minutes,'' Self said. ``They brought everybody up here
and saved the farm.
   ``Lots of people complain about where their tax dollars go but
I'll gladly pay my taxes for this kind of service,'' Self said.

<HEAD>Visitors Ordered Out Of Old Faithful Area; Flames Threaten Two

<DATELINE>YELLOWSTONE NATIONAL PARK, Wyo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Tourists casually packed
their cars and evacuated the Old Faithful complex today as a
wind-blown wildfire roared less than a mile away, while a river of
fire flowed within feet of two small towns on Yellowstone's
northern border.
   It was the first time in Yellowstone's 116-year history that
evacuations had been ordered near Old Faithful, park officials said.
   The tourists at Old Faithful couldn't see any flames today
because a ridge blocked their view, but park spokeswoman Marsha
Karle said the smoke in the park made it ``harder and harder to
breathe.''
   The 500 to 600 visitors and non-essential employees at the hotel
and campground complex near the park's most popular attraction were
ordered to leave for safety reasons and to allow firefighters the
access they need to protect structures, says spokeswoman Joan
Anzelmo.
   ``This is not a panic at all,'' she said.
   Wendy Morrison of Scottsdale, Ariz., said a bellman knocked on
her door at 6:45 a.m. and told her the National Park Service was
evacuating the area.
   ``We kind of figured it was coming so it was not too much of a
shock,'' Morrison said. ``We got in yesterday and were planning to
stay through tomorrow.''
   Winds gusting to 30 mph pushed the 144,700-acre North Fork blaze
to within three-quarters of a mile of the complex early today.
Embers carried by the wind started spot fires even nearer to the
famed geyser.
   Firefighters in Cooke City, Mont., where the giant Storm Creek
fire surged out of the park, hoped today that a stiff west wind
wouldn't shift enough to fan the flames across a 20-foot firebreak
separating the fire from the tiny tourist towns of Cooke City and
Silver Gate at the park's northeast corner.
   Overnight, wind blew parallel to the narrow east-west firebreak,
and firefighters channeled the fire past the northern edge of
Silver Gate.
   By this morning, the fire's leading edge was past Silver Gate
and within a quarter mile of Cooke City, but still following the
10- to 20-foot-wide firebreak channel.
   sked how close the fire was to buildings, fire information
officer Dave McMorran said: ``Zero. It's right up behind the
buildings.''
   Officials hoped the fire's scorched path would protect the towns
from a return.
   At the Old Faithful complex, officials are confident they can
protect structures from the advancing flames. These include the
historic, wooden Old Faithful Inn, two other lodges, hundreds of
cabins, a general store, a service station and a clinic.
   On Tuesday, soldiers laid a 4,000-foot irrigation line to wet
down the area to divert the flames.
   The blaze is among 13 major fires that have burned roughly 1
million acres this summer in Yellowstone and the surrounding
national forests in Wyoming, Montana and Idaho. Inside the 2.2
million-acre park, 634,000 acres are charred.
   Firefighters wetted down buildings in Cooke City and Silver Gate
as the 63,000-acre Storm Creek fire surged out of the park. Both
towns, with a combined year-round population of 150, were ordered
evacuated earlier Tuesday as the fire threatened from 1{ miles away.
   Wind-blown embers landed on buildings but were quickly doused by
firefighters, who waged a nightlong effort to save the community.
   Some firefighters sprayed rooftops just above a portable sign
that read: ``Give it hell, guys. It ain't over 'til it's over.''
   Firefighters cut Silver Gate's power Tuesday night to prevent
the downing of live power lines. The town was lit only by
spotlights, and the orange glow of the spot fire 200 yards away was
bright enough to read by.
   David Liebersbach, fire commander at Silver Gate, estimated
firefighters had a 25 percent chance of saving the town.
   Other Montana fires also forced evacuations.
   The 66,000-plus-acre Canyon Creek fire in west-central Montana
grew so quickly that officials had no accurate idea of its size,
said Jane Weber of the Lewis and Clark National Forest. The growth
prompted an evacuation of an undetermined number of cabins.
   More than 30 cabins southwest of Augusta were ordered evacuated,
Weber said. To the southwest across the Scapegoat Wilderness, the
Canyon Creek fire forced evacuations north of Ovando, about 75
miles northwest of Helena. And officials evacuated about 10 homes
near a new fire eight miles west of Glacier National Park.
   In southwest Montana, firefighters began evacuating 12 to 15
homes west of Darby as the Little Rock Creek fire spread to more
than 1,000 acres in the Bitterroot National Forest. The fire was
about two miles from Darby today, but the town was not considered
threatened, said fire information officer Paul Gyles.
   Gov. Ted Schwinden on Tuesday banned all outdoor recreation
outside Montana's cities and towns due to the fire danger.
   Elsewhere, a fire in parched grass and pine in central
Washington exploded from 160 acres Monday to more than 25,000 acres
Tuesday, sending firefighters fleeing, destroying at least one
house and forcing the evacuation of a dozen others. State officials
closed, but later re-opened, 40 miles of nearby U.S. 97 due to
smoke.
   The fire, the largest of several in Washington, burned toward
some of the state's prime fruit orchards.
   In Idaho, wind whipped a fire in the Nez Perce National Forest
from 25,900 acres Monday to 36,780 by Tuesday night.
   Campgrounds were evacuated about 225 miles north of San
Francisco in the King Mountain Range, where a 1,150-acre fire was
burning and firefighters continued today to mop up the remnants of
wildfires that blackened more than 25,000 acres in Southern
California. Forests and grassland also burned in Oregon and Utah.
   The Boise Interagency Fire Center, the coordinating office for
firefighting in the West, said fires this year have charred 3.65
million acres, an area larger than Connecticut. Slightly more than
2 million of the acres are in Alaska. During the last big fire
season, 1985, 2.8 million acres burned. The fire center has called
this the worst fire season in 30 years.

   Flooding caused by several days of heavy
rainfall led to the evacuation of about 1,000 people, closed
schools and forced police to patrol in garbage trucks today,
authorities said.
   About 1,000 people were evacuated from trailer parks and
low-lying areas in eastern Manatee County, the Florida National
Guard said.
   The rainfall was the heaviest since Hurricane Elena in 1985, but
no injuries were reported. One community reported 13 inches of
rainfall.
   Manatee County supervisors and the Bradenton city council met in
emergency session this morning to seek ways to combat flooding
along the Manatee and Little Manatee rivers.
   Police in Palmetto, across the Manatee River from Bradenton,
were forced to abandon their patrol cars and travel in garbage
trucks.
   Manatee High in Bradenton and several other schools were
flooded, said county school Superintendent Gene Witt; the school
board called off classes across the county.
   ``The roads are heavily flooded and we're having sewage problems
with water backing up into the schools,'' he said. ``In the last 25
years I haven't seen anything of this magnitude.''
   Parts of Manatee County, just south of Tampa, have received up
to 10 inches of rain in the last two days, Witt said; four more
inches could fall today, forecasters predicted.
   Up the coast from Bradenton, Yankeetown reported 13 inches of
rain.
   ``All the rivers around here are over their banks,'' said Coast
Guard Petty Officer Eric Hermann in the Yankeetown station.
``There's a lot of street flooding and stuff.''
   In northern Florida, officials in Clay County began to evacuate
families along swollen Black Creek, said Chief Pete Cummings of the
Clay County Public Safety Department.
   Deputies went house-to-house in a boat just after daybreak
today, offering assistance to families and making sure they could
get out, said Cummings.

   Hundreds of Louisiana teachers went back to school today after a
three-week strike, but officials scrambled for substitutes in
Peabody, Mass., as walkouts affecting more than 110,000 students
began or continued in five states.
   A settlement was signed Tuesday night in southwest Louisiana's
Vermilion Parish after officials agreed to collective bargaining
with the Vermilion Association of Educators representing 600
teachers, cafeteria workers and school bus drivers.
   ``We're very happy. We're going back to school and I think we'll
have a better educational system,'' association President Betty
Girouard said.
   The teachers, on strike since Aug. 26 over the right to
collective bargaining and a 6 percent pay cut imposed in 1987,
returned to work and their 9,500 students today.
   Many of the teachers on strike in 25 public school districts in
Michigan, Pennsylvania, Massachusetts, New Jersey and Illinois were
holding out for raises.
   ``The teachers decided it's time to take a stand and that stand
actually is a walk and that's what we'll be doing tomorrow morning:
walking a picket line,'' Thomas Grady, head of the United Teachers
of Lowell, Mass., said after a unanimous strike vote Tuesday by 970
members.
   The first day of school today was canceled for the city's 13,100
students.
   The teachers are seeking higher pay and longevity bonuses.
   Lowell has filed a petition with the state labor relations board
for a strike investigation hearing, which was set for Thursday,
said Victor Forsley, the School Committee's attorney.
   ``We'll present evidence to prove that an illegal strike is
taking place,'' Forsley said. Teacher strikes are illegal in
Massachusetts.
   Teachers in nearly 40 Massachusetts school districts were going
to work this week without a contract.
   In Peabody, the city's 408 teachers on Tuesday rejected a 17
percent wage increase over three years, holding out for 42 percent.
   ``To sit at the table locked in at 42 percent is totally
irresponsible,'' said Mayor Peter Torigian.
   As teachers picketed peacefully outside, classes went on as
planned today since the program was limited to orientation
sessions, said Assistant Superintendent Gregory Theokas.
Administrators said they were trying to bring in enough substitutes
to cover classes Thursday and Friday. The district has 5,700
students.
   Bert Latessa of the Massachusetts Federation of Teachers
defended the union's position. The 42 percent wage request, Latessa
said, is smaller than it appears because the teachers maintain they
have been performing extra duties such as handling oversized
classes without extra pay.
   In Detroit, more than 1,400 professors and academic staff
members at Wayne State University went on strike Tuesday over union
work rules and salary.
   About 950 clerical workers and secretaries represented by the
United Auto Workers have been on strike there since Aug. 25.
   Here is a brief summary of teacher strikes elsewhere.
   New Jersey: A union representing about 130 teachers, custodians
and clerks at Eastern Regional High School in Voorhees postponed
the first day of school by striking early today after nearly 12
hours of talks broke down, officials said. The school has 1,450
students.
   Michigan: Strikes in 10 districts idled nearly 45,000 students
and more than 2,000 teachers, the Michigan Education Association
said.
   Pennsylvania: Strikes by about 2,750 teachers canceled classes
or disrupted teacher preparation days in 10 districts with 43,800
students.
   Illinois: Strikes in two districts affected 501 teachers and
9,145 pupils in Granite City, Farmer City, Mansfield and Bellflower.

<HEAD>Report: US Public Health Efforts in Trouble</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JERRY ESTILL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. public health system is sick and will
get sicker unless Americans stop taking it for granted and demand
more from themselves and their leaders, a National Academy of
Sciences report concluded today.
   ``We have slackened our public health vigilance nationally and
the health of the public is unnecessarily threatened as a result,''
said the report by the academy's Institute of Medicine. ``Public
health is a vital function that is in trouble.''
   ``Our guard is now down,'' Richard D. Remington told a news
conference at which the report was released. ``The American people
must understand that everyone's health will suffer in the long run
if we do not take care now to rebuild the capability of and
confidence in our public health agencies.''
   Remington, chairman of the committee that conducted the study,
is a professor of preventive medicine and environmental health at
the University of Iowa.
   Rather than dwell on specific health problems, the 218-page
report offers a blueprint for structural changes and attitude
shifts at federal, state and local levels to shore up the system in
general.
   It said the nation is on the verge of falling victim to past
successes, noting that ``many of the major improvements in the
health of the American people have been accomplished through public
health measures.''
   ``But the public has come to take the success of public health
for granted,'' it said.
   The panel cited AIDS and access to health care for the indigent
as examples of ``immediate crises.''
   At the same time, it said, lingering problems ``with equally
great significance for the health of the public and the well-being
of our society require continuing attention.''
   It gave four examples:
   _Injuries, which kill 140,000 of the 70 million Americans hurt
each year. They are the leading cause of death for children and
young adults.
   _Teen-age pregnancy. Pregnant teen-agers have higher rates of
miscarriages, complications, stillbirths, infant and maternal
deaths than pregnant adults and their surviving children are more
likely to suffer injuries and also more likely to be hospitalized
by age 5 than children of adult mothers.
   _High blood pressure. Despite improvements, hypertension still
afflicts about 60 million Americans and makes them susceptible to
strokes and heart disease.
   _Smoking and substance abuse. ``Smoking is the single greatest
cause of premature death in this country,'' the report said, citing
estimates that smoking contributes to as many as 225,000 deaths a
year from coronary heart disease, 100,000 from cancers and 20,000
from lung disease.
   In a third category, the institute cited toxic substances and
Alzheimer disease as ``time bombs'' that will require increasing
attention in coming years.
   The panel said there is plenty of blame to go around for
continuing public health problems, and that solutions ``will
require a comprehensive strategy and a strong commitment on the
part of the entire society.''
   Many of the problems are with health professionals and
politicians, the report said.
   ``Public support _ always fragile because of limited awareness _
is increasingly being eroded by controversy,'' it said.
   And while faulting the tendency of elected officials to react _
or overreact _ only to crises, the report did not clear health
professionals, saying they ignore the political implications of
health care at the public's peril.
   ``Many public health professionals who talked with us seemed to
regard politics as a contaminant of an ideally rational
decision-making process rather than as an essential element of
democratic governance,'' it said.
   Making clear it believes that public health protection should
apply to the more than 30 million uninsured or underinsured
Americans, the panel said ``the ultimate responsibility for
assuring equitable access to health care for all, through a
combination of public and private sector action, rests with the
federal government.''
   It also said geography should be no more of a barrier than lack
of money.
   ``No citizen from any community, no matter how small or remote,
should be without identifiable and realistic access to benefits of
public health protection,'' it said.

   Illegal dumpers of syringes, blood vials and
other infectious medical wastes face stiffer penalties under
legislation signed into law today by New York Gov. Mario Cuomo.
   The bill is part of a state effort to stem the flow of medical
trash that washed ashore on several New York City and Long Island
beaches in recent months, forcing the temporary closure of several
popular shores during the hottest summer in decades.
   Cuomo called this year's descriptions of the floating debris
``shocking'' and said the incidents ``threaten the livelihood of
thousands who work at our beaches and the enjoyment of the millions
of New Yorkers who use the beaches for recreation.''
   Under the bill approved by Cuomo, penalties of up to four years
in jail and fines of up to $50,000 could be brought against people
convicted of illegally disposing of the so-called red bag medical
wastes. The debris is dubbed that because it's supposed to be
thrown out in specially marked containers.
   Cuomo also said he signed a companion bill today that provides
$2 million to pay for stepped up enforcement of the infectious
waste disposal rules by the state departments of Environmental
Conservation and Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation.
   The legislation is designed to put teeth into regulations
recently established by the state Environmental Conservation and
Health departments. Those new rules are designed to provide
``cradle to grave'' tracking of the medical wastes and to make sure
that discarded infectious materials are clearly marked to make
tracing easier.

   Here are excerpts from recent editorials in newspapers
throughout the nation.
   Sept. 3
   The Kennebec Journal, Augusta, Maine, on George Bush _
environmentalist:
   Standing on the shore of Lake Erie, ... George Bush spoke these
remarkable words: ``I am an environmentalist.'' ...
   The words were remarkable because the Reagan administration,
which he has served faithfully for eight years, has regarded
``environmentalist'' as something close to a dirty word. ...
   On no other issue _ even Iran-Contra _ is George Bush so
vulnerable to serious, sustained criticism by his Democratic
opponents.
   Until this year, he has never even murmured a dissent against
the policies of a president who came into office maintaining that
``trees cause pollution,'' while appointing James ``Second Coming''
Watt as Interior secretary, who later disclosed he thought we
should use up all available natural resources while there was still
time.
   The Reagan record on the environment is not merely dismal; it is
repellent.

   Watertown (S.D.) Public Opinion on the Pledge of Allegiance in
schools:
   Indeed, it's difficult to believe that two grown-ups running for
president in this perilous age have nothing better to argue about
than whether school children should recite the Pledge of Allegiance.
   The Pledge of Allegiance is an emotional issue. Those who
believe children should have the right to recite it in unison want
to instill patriotism in our youth.
   But those who believe children should not be forced to take an
oath have an equally important goal _ to protect freedom of belief.
   Both sides have a strong point to make. Who can say which side
is right? The Founding Fathers aren't available for comment on the
issue.

   Nashville (Tenn.) Banner on Congressional reform:
   The Pentagon has come under heavy criticism and close scrutiny _
deservedly so _ for procurement scandals and information peddling
by consultants and lobbyists.
   But last week Defense Secretary Frank Carlucci tossed the ball
back to Congress, serving notice that if chances for abuse are to
be reduced, Congress is going to have to clean up its own house. ...
   ``Congress should revise its procedures to make it impossible
for individual members who want to force the president to purchase
an item not included in his defense request to do so by burying an
amendment within the overall defense budget package,'' the defense
secretary said. ...
   He made it clear that any meaningful reform is going to have to
include reform of procedures in Congress.

   The Dallas Morning News on medical wastes polluting the beaches:
   It has been the summer of the syringe, when Americans discovered
to their horror that it probably wasn't the sharks they had to fear
at the seashore, but the medical waste. ...
   As far back as December 1978, the Environmental Protection
Agency announced it would regulate infectious wastes as hazardous
wastes under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act.
   But when final regulations were issued in 1980, infectious waste
was not included as a hazardous waste. ...
   Finally, this summer, the EPA asked for public comment on its
handling of the biomedical waste issues, but critics say that's too
little, too late. ...
   A federal approach would be helpful since the current patchwork
of state legislation makes it possible for dumpers to shift to
states with more lenient laws.
   Still, more laws would not be necessary if the EPA would move
more quickly to define medical waste and include it in hazardous
waste regulations.

   The Orange County (Calif.) Register on financing space
exploration:
   Were we snookered into supporting a badly run government space
program?
   Sure, NASA did put a man on the moon. But make some big
technical project a national priority, throw billions at it ... and
even the government can accomplish something.
   But government is singularly inept at running day-to-day
operations of anything, especially of something so complex as space
exploration. ...
   Happily, a new era may be dawning.
   On Oct. 6, America's first private commercial rocket is
scheduled to be launched in Florida by the EPrime Aerospace Corp.,
a publicly held Florida company. It will be a modest launch,
lofting into space a few scientific and industrial experiments. ...
   The important thing is that it's the first of a series of
private rockets that will compete with NASA.

   The (Greenwood, S.C.) Index-Journal on negative campaigning:
   Look at how much time vice presidential nominee Dan Quayle has
had to devote to putting to rest the silly charges surrounding his
National Guard service. Before that ran its course, it was
something to do with a female lobbyist.
   And what about the ``wimp'' factor applied to (George) Bush and
how much time and effort he's had to give to overcoming that, as
well as a couple other meaningless charges.
   Meaningless, yes. Nevertheless, those charges have taken their
toll on the Republican ticket. Both Bush and Quayle could have
better used that time and effort to get their own ideas in focus
before the voters.
   As long as they have to run around countering charges of one
kind or another, they'll never get their own messages out. And
that, of course, is what negative campaigning is all about.

   The Daily Dunklin Democrat, Kennett, Mo., on the vice
presidential nominees:
   Neither (Daniel Quayle nor Lloyd Bentsen) appears to break any
preconceived mold of leadership retardation we expect from someone
selected for a job that requires not much more than silent
subservience and pleasant countenance.
   The expecation that anyone holding the office (of vice
president) will, as the saying goes, ``grow in office,'' seems
wistfully and overly optimistic given the lack of duties of the
position. ...
   Americans will just have to conclude that there is some unseen
quality in both vice presidential candidates that will sometime be
revealed.
   Neither Quayle nor Bentsen makes us stop asking the decades-long
question that haunts so many Americans. How come we never get any

   Arkansas Democrat, Little Rock, Ark., on education loans:
   As though it weren't enough that too many college graduates
default on their student loans, word now comes from the General
Accounting Office that the lenders who extend the
government-secured loans are also gouging Uncle Sam.
   GAO doesn't say it's being done deliberately. It just says the
lenders are getting millions in excess subsidies each year because
the U.S. Department of Education is lax in checking the accuracy of
their bills for the loan interest the government pays. ...
   The federal watchdog agency says that the loan act should be
rewritten to allow the Secretary of Education to charge interest on
overpayments made to lenders and also to require that the latter
employ independent auditors to certify the loan accounts and
interest billings.
   Congress could and should do that before the current session
expires.

the safety of airline passengers obviously is not what it should be.
   Thirty-two of the nation's commercial airlines have been fined a
total of $1 million by the Federal Aviation Administration for
failing to provide adequate security checks at airports.
   Inspectors still were able to smuggle phony weapons aboard
planes without having them detected by X-ray machines, guards or
metal detectors 15 percent of the time they tried to do so, the FAA
said. ...

   The Atlanta Constitution on an energy policy:
   By 1979, the United States had wrestled a comprehensive energy
policy into place.
   Shocked by prices that had been quadrupled by the monopolistic
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, the nation adopted
policies designed to reduce its energy dependence sharply.
   The idea was to protect ourselves from future vulnerability to
OPEC, but over the eight years of the Reagan administration, the
energy program has been dismantled. ...
   No, the strategies of the late '70s were not necessarily
appropriate for all time, and, yes, more of the energy savings of
the early '80s were caused by extortionate prices than by federal
policy.
   But guiding policies are needed all the more in the absence of
conservation-forcing high prices, and it is blithe, at best, to act
as if the nation needs no energy policy at all.

   Anchorage (Alaska) Daily News on the U.S. security policy:
   Security policy represents both a quandry and an opportunity for
the next American president: a quandry because a decade of
unprecedented peacetime buildup of U.S. defense capacity cannot,
for budgetary reasons, be continued _ and an opportunity for much
the same reason.
   The opportunity is clear, and it flows directly out of the
maturation of policy under President Reagan in the past two years.
...
   How to grasp the opportunity? Four key steps: reduce the
superpowers' nuclear arsenal, as President Reagan has long
proposed; keep the arms race out of space, as the Soviets have
suggested; untangle the East-West standoff in Europe, ... and
control the spread of nuclear and chemical weapons. ...
   Americans should listen carefully to what Michael Dukakis and
George Bush have to say about these matters _ and consider which of
them is better equipped to exploit the opportunities.

   Marshall (Minn.) Independent on human rights in Romania:
   Congress has gone on record opposing plans of President
Ceausescu of Romania to destroy more than half the traditional folk
villages in his country.
   Under a massive collectivization program, Romania would bulldoze
7,000 of its 13,000 traditional villages to make way for
government-owned agricultural-industrial complexes.
   The displaced people would be hearded into state-owned,
standardized housing units to be built in centuries-old town
centers. ...
   Violation of human rights of all its citizens is part of the
government's miserable record. It has denied its 2.5 million ethnic
minorities the right to preserve their native language.
   Recent congressional action expressing outrage at Romanian
repression will have little effect of the contempt for human rights
and cultural legacies displayed by Ceausescu.
   But it may give some hope to the oppressed minorities in Romania
that their plight has not gone unnoticed.

   The Decatur (Ala.) Daily on presidential debates:
   It will be good if there are several (presidential) debates, for
from them it is possible to learn more of each man.
   In planned speeches a candidate will only say what he wants the
audience to hear. That is even true in press conferences.
   But a debate is a little different and issues usually are
addressed, even though one or the other or both might have to face
topics not to his liking.
   The campaign is here. Both candidates are at the same starting
line. The one who gets elected is going to be the one who lets the
American people know exactly what he plans and how he is going to
carry out those plans.
   Eight years ago President Reagan said he was going to balance
the budget within four years. He didn't tell us how he was going to
do it and the American voters let him get away with it, and you
know what has happened to the budget.
   Not only do we want to hear what the candidate is going to do,
we want to hear how he is going to do it.

congratulations for developing a high-tech, low-smoke cigarette, it

   The allure of the cigarette, called Premier and to be
test-marketed in three cities starting Oct. 1, is that it will emit
only a trace of ash or smoke that could irritate people nearby.
   However, the Reynolds people aren't claiming that Premier will
be any less dangerous than regular cigarettes.
   Apparently, they are more concerned about prying the
increasingly vehement anti-smoking crowd off their backs than
reducing the health hazard to those who will smoke their cigarettes.
   There's nothing like hitting a problem head on, is there?

<TEXT>
   The Rev. Silvester Mooney, who headed Douai Abbey
in England for 40 years and was believed to be the world's oldest
Roman Catholic monk, has died at age 102, the abbey said Wednesday.
   Popularly known as Grandfather Abbot, Mooney was deeply loved as
a simple, taciturn man who never accepted any comfort that wasn't
available to his fellow monks, said the Rev. Oliver Holt, a
community spokesman.
   He did, however, accept a television set as a 101st birthday
gift, and enjoyed watching sports programs, Holt said.
   His 100th birthday brought special greetings from Pope John Paul
II, and Mooney marked the occasion by preaching a 20-minute sermon
without notes.
   Holt said recent checks of records indicated Mooney probably was
the world's oldest living Catholic monk and definitely the oldest
Benedictine.
   Born in Liverpool on June 14, 1886, Mooney was sent to Douai in
northern France at age 11 to be educated by the English Benedictine
community of St. Edmund's. He was ordained a priest in 1911.
   He returned to England with the 80-strong community, which
established a new abbey called Douai 50 miles west of London. In
1929, Mooney was made its abbot until he retired in 1969.
   Holt said Mooney recently underwent treatment for a small
abnormal growth, but attributed his death Monday night ``basically
to old age.''

<DATELINE>BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   British rock star Peter Gabriel,
speaking in Hungarian learned for the occasion, urged Romania to
respect the rights of ethnic Hungarians during a concert organized
by Amnesty International.
   A capacity crowd of 81,000 that included top Soviet and
Hungarian officials attended the all-star concert Tuesday night at
Nep Stadium, the only Soviet bloc venue on the six-week global tour.
   Bruce Springsteen, dressed in black, played for nearly two
hours. Spectators, many from across the Soviet bloc, sang along
with Springsteen on ``Born In the U.S.A.,'' his opening number.
   British rock star Sting, American folk singer Tracy Chapman and
Senegal's Youssou N'dour also performed in the eight-hour concert,
a rare event in Eastern Europe.
   Individual Western rock groups have been allowed to play in
communist European capitals, but this concert was unusual because
it was sponsored by a Western human rights group. Western
governments and organizations, including Amnesty International,
have accused East bloc countries of rights violations.
   Hungary's premier and Communist Party leader Karoly Grosz, who
met with Romanian President Nicolae Ceausescu last month to discuss
the minority issue, was at the concert, but there was no official
report of his presence.
   The state news agency MTI said spectators included Soviet
government spokesman Gennady Gerasimov and Janos Berecz, chief
ideologist of the Hungarian Communist Party and a member of the
ruling Politburo.
   Berecz, described as ``chief patron'' of the concert, was quoted
by MTI as saying, ``There is no need to be afraid of human rights
issues, but persistent efforts are needed for them to be
accomplished.''
   Hungary recently accused Romania of serious rights abuses.
Budapest maintains neighboring Romania is discriminating against
the culture and traditions of the 1.7 million Hungarians in
Romania. Romania has a population of 23 million.
   The major issue is Romania's plan to raze 7,000 villages,
including hundreds of communities populated mainly by ethnic
Hungarians, and resettle the people in agro-industrial centers as
part of a land reform program.
   The tour, which began in London Friday and then went to Paris,
is marking the 40th anniversary of the U.N. Universal Declaration
on Human Rights. It will include 20 cities on five continents.
After the show, the entourage flew to Turin, Italy, where their
next concert is scheduled for Thursday.
   A song by Sting, ``Set Them Free,'' dedicated to children in
South African jails, was especially well received at Tuesday's
concert.
   Hungarian singer Hobo, leader of the local Hobo Blues Band,
asked the audience to ``put our hands together for people who are
oppressed all over the world and (for) our people who suffer in
Romania.''
   Ms. Chapman told the audience: ``You have the right to be free.
Tell the government to support your rights.''
   Some spectators people held up banners pleading the cause of the
Romanian Hungarians and calling for the United Nations to take up
the issue.
   Shortly before 2:00 a.m., the stars got together on stage for a
rendition of Bob Dylan's ``Chimes of Freedom'' and ``Get Up, Stand
Up'' by the late reggae singer Bob Marley.
   In the first media comment, the Hungarian newspaper Esti Hirlap
said, ``Nothing comparable has happened in Nep Stadium since the
late Louis Armstrong's concert here'' in June 1965.
   The newspaper referred to Gabriel, who has performed in Budapest
on his own before, as ``an old friend'' and thanked him for
speaking in Hungarian.

<HEAD>Thousands Of British Mail Boxes Sealed In Strike</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Postal deliveries were nearly at a halt and 100
million pieces of undelivered mail piled up Wednesday in a week-old
nationwide strike that idled more than half of the country's
180,000 postal workers.
   The strikes left only two of 82 mechanized sorting offices in
operation, one in Belfast, Northern Ireland, and one in Gloucester.
All 11,000 collection mailboxes in London were sealed.
   The national postal service said in a statement that the backlog
of undelivered letters and parcels reached 100 million _ equivalent
to the amount of mail delivered in two working days.
   The Mail Users' Association said the postal dispute was costing
British industry $43 million a day.
   The postal service said talks were under way, but the British
Broadcasting Corp. reported little progress.
   ``We are talking about holding talks,'' said a post office
spokesman who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   South Wales Electricity pledged that no customers would be cut
off during the strike because of unpaid bills.
   The National Federation of the Self-Employed and Small
Businesses, representing about 50,000 small companies, said many
companies could be in trouble if the strike continues because of
the delay in receiving checks.
   Faced with the threat of empty spaces in letters-to-the-editor
columns, The Times, The Daily Telegraph and The Independent invited
readers to send letters by Fax machine, and the BBC invited
listeners to dictate their letters by telephone.
   The labor action began Aug. 31 with a 24-hour strike called by
the Union of Communication Workers, which said it was unfair to
offer bonuses to junior employees only in selected regions.
   The weekly bonuses of about $12.52 to $33.40 were given to new
staffers in London and southeast England, where the postal service
has trouble recruiting and keeping workers. The union maintains the
bonuses should be paid to all workers or not at all.
   The union represents 140,000 postal workers. The post office
said today that more than 90,000 of them were on strike.
   Many postal workers around the country refused to return to work
on Sept. 1 because local managers hired extra temporary workers to
help clear the backlog of mail. The walkouts since have escalated.
   The post office said Tuesday that many union members walked out
because they were denied large overtime payments after temporary
workers were hired to clear the backlog.
   The union denied this and said the walkouts were provoked by
management demands that staff cross picket lines, handle mail from
areas not theirs and sign guarantees that they will not strike or
take other protest action again.
   Private couriers are profiting from the labor troubles.
   TNT Express U.K., which says it is Britain's largest courier,
said its 26 nationwide depots hired extra workers to handle a 400
percent increase in business since the strike began.

   A prosecutor had told the jury that Tabacca of Universal City
became outraged when flight attendant Pamela Martinez tried to stop
him from lighting up aboard a Trans World Airlines flight from
Boston to Los Angeles on Dec. 30. He had been seated in the
no-smoking section at the last minute.
   ``He grabbed her arm, twisted it and shoved her across the aisle
into the bulkhead,'' said Assistant U.S. Attorney Robin Scroggie.
   The prosecutor said Tabacca also shouted obscenities at Ms.
Martinez, rammed his shoulder into her and swung his garment bag
into her leg.
   Tabacca's attorney, Deputy Public Defender Marilyn Butler,
admitted her client lighted a cigarette, but denied that he
assaulted the flight attendant.
   Defense lawyers said they would appeal the conviction on several
grounds, arguing among other things that the statute making it
illegal to interfere with a flight crew member was intended to
apply only when the safety of a flight is jeopardized.
   Although Tabacca's ticket was for the smoking section, most
seats on the flight were later converted to non-smoking because of
new government regulations requiring airlines to provide no-smoking
seats for all passengers who arrive on time and want them.

<HEAD>Politburo Member Was Mentioned As Possible Honecker Successor</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Werner Felfe, a high-ranking Politburo member once
considered a likely successor to East German leader Erich Honecker,
died Wednesday, the official state-run news agency ADN reported.
   Felfe, 60, was one of the youngest members of the 22-member
Politburo and 16 years younger than Honecker. He was secretary of
agriculture in the communist government at the time of his death.
   ADN said Felfe died ``suddenly and unexpectedly'' of a heart
attack.
   ``The party and our people have lost an outstanding party
functionary and statesman,'' ADN said. It said Felfe had ``worked
tirelessly to help develop the socialist society in the German
Democratic Republic (East Germany) in the interests of the working
people.''
   Felfe was born on Jan. 4, 1928 in Grossroehrsdorf, about 12
miles northeast of Dresden in what is now East Germany.
   He joined the German Communist Party at the age of 17 and became
a member of East Germany's communist party, the Socialist Unity
Party, when the nation was formed after World War II.
   Felfe recently had spoken in favor of Soviet leader Mikhail S.
Gorbachev's reform plans and told Western visitors that East
Germany needed similar reforms.
   Western sources in East Berlin, speaking on condition of
anonymity, quoted him as saying he believed East Germany should
institute the reforms only after personnel changes in the ruling
Politburo.

   The national government Wednesday
imposed direct federal rule and dissolved the legislature in the
northeastern state of Mizoram, news reports said.
   The government ordered direct rule, known as president's rule,
in an effort to end a 10-day political crisis prompted by a
rebellion within the Mizo National Front, the state's governing
party, the United News of India said.
   Eight dissident members defected to Prime Minister Rajiv
Gandhi's Congress Party on Aug. 29, leaving the government of state
Prime Minister Laldenga a minority in the 40-member state
legislature, the news agency said.
   Under the Constitution, elections must be held within a year.
   Mizoram is the fourth state after violence-torn Punjab and
politically unsettled Tamil Nadu and Nagaland to be placed under
president's rule.
   Mizoram, which borders Burma and Bangladesh, was upgraded from
an Indian federal territory to a state in February 1987 under an
agreement signed by Gandhi and the Mizo National Front, which had
waged a 20-year guerrilla war.
   The front took control of the state legislature that month from
the Congress Party, and Laldenga, who led the bloody campaign for
more automony, became prime minister.
   Under the accord, the front agreed to drop demands for
independence from India and the federal government agreed to
upgrade Mizoram to a state.

   China on Wednesday successfully launched its
first experimental weather satellite, the Wind and Cloud No. 1, the
official Xinhua News Agency said.
   The satellite was launched by a Long March 4 rocket from a space
station in Taiyuan, north-central China, Xinhua said.
   It will transmit information on clouds, the earth's surface,
marine water color, vegetation growth, ocean surface temperatures
and ice and snow to satellite ground stations worldwide, the news
agency said.
   The State Council, or cabinet, and the Central Military
Commission issued a statement saying the launching ``is of great
importance to promoting China's national economic growth and serves
as an encouragement to people of all nationalities.''
   China has launched 23 of its own satellites since starting its
space program in 1970 and has recovered 11 orbiters since 1975.
Most of the previous satellites have been involved in mapping.
   It has begun carrying experimental devices owned by foreign
companies and is trying to establish a satellite launching service
for foreign customers.

   Republican George Bush, talking tough on defense, received a
warm reception at an American Legion convention today while
Democratic rival Michael Dukakis told a college audience ``George
was right there'' as the Reagan administration fought aid programs
for students.
   Bush, speaking to about 7,000 people at the Legion gathering in
Louisville, Ky., renewed his contention that Dukakis would weaken
the nation's defense.
   ``I do not doubt my opponent's patriotism. But patriotism is not
the issue. The issue is how best to deter war, to keep peace and to
fulfill our country's special responsibility as leader of the free
world,'' Bush said.
   ``My opponent opposes the SDI (Strategic Defense Initiative).
But, like you in the American Legion, I support it. We cannot leave
America hostage to Soviet ballistic missiles,'' he said.
   Bush sent murmers through the audience when he said at one
point: ``I wonder how many Americans remember that today is Pearl
Harbor Day; 47 years ago to this very day we were hit and hit hard
at Pearl Harbor. And we were not ready.''
   He later corrected himself _ the Japanese air strike was on Dec.
7, 1941, one of the best-known dates in U.S. history _ and the
legionnaires gave him a good-natured round of applause.
   Dukakis, in remarks prepared for delivery at Kean College in
Union, N.J., criticized Reagan administration cuts in federal
student aid programs and outlined his own college opportunity
proposal.
   That proposal that would have students receive loans in return
for their agreement to pay back a percentage of their income for
the rest of their working lives.
   As for Bush, Dukakis asked, ``Where was George Bush while his
administration was doing its best to slam the door of college
opportunity in the face of millions of young people across this
country?''
   ``Where was he while his administration was denying
middle-income families the hope for a future of prosperity and
success for their children?''
   ``George was right there all the time. Not doing and not saying
a thing,'' Dukakis said.
   One day earlier, behind the scenes, Dukakis agreed to Bush's
request that they meet face-to-face only twice and have running
mate Lloyd Bentsen debate Republican Dan Quayle once. Negotiations
continued today on scheduling and format.
   Dukakis criticized Bush on Tuesday after the vice president told
a shipyard worker in Portland, Ore., his wages have dropped from
$13.36 an hour to $9.50 an hour under the Reagan administration
because ``you're going through a competitive change.'' The
reference was to foreign competition.
   After being met by a booing and jeering union crowd at the
Northwest Marine Iron Works in Portland, Bush said during lunch,
``All I need is 51 percent of the vote.''
   ``George Bush made it clear today that he really does not
understand the hopes and dreams and aspirations of millions and
millions of American workers across this country,'' Dukakis said in
response to Bush's comments. ``That's not an adequate answer to
American workers.''
   Last week, Bush evoked an angry response when he called a small
increase in the unemployment rate ``statistically irrelevant.''
   Today, Bush addressed the 70th annual convention of the American
Legion in Louisville, where President Reagan on Tuesday lambasted
the Democratic ticket on defense matters.
   Reagan said that while Bush's opponents have praised him for
reaching a treaty with the Soviets banning intermediate-range
nuclear weapons in Europe, they also ``opposed deploying the
missiles that made that treaty possible.''
   ``Yes, it comes down to this: After eight hard years of
rebuilding America's strength, do we really want to return to a
Disneyland defense policy _ with Mickey Mouse treatment of our men
and women in uniform, Goofy strategic plans and Donald Duck-like
lectures telling us that whatever goes wrong is our own
blankety-blank fault?'' Reagan asked.
   The battleground of the airwaves began seeing some action. In
ads that the began airing Tuesday in several states, the Democratic
National Committee accused Reagan and Republicans of misleading
Americans about the threat posed by the the federal budget deficit.
   Later this week, DNC plans include an ad stressing Dukakis'
``bring prosperity home'' theme, which emphasizes economic policies.
   A Dukakis campaign ad that began airing nationally Tuesday night
shows a montage of shots from Dukakis' speech at the Democratic
convention and lists his major accomplishments as governor.
   The Dukakis campaign also began airing a third ad just in Texas,
touting Dukakis and his running mate, Bentsen, for supporting
legislation to give workers 60 days' notice before a plant closing.
   Despite the air time, Dukakis had some trouble getting his
campaign off the ground Tuesday.
   His flight was grounded in Chicago by the Federal Aviation
Administration after a surprise inspection turned up three minor
safety violations, forcing the Massachusetts governor to cancel an
appearance in Columbus, Ohio.
   The flight he managed to take home to Boston landed safely, but
a cone over the rear galley popped off and dropped to the tarmac.
The pilot said a passenger had pulled an emergency release cable
that opens the cone only when the plane is on the ground.
   Bentsen, set the tone for the educational attacks, telling an
audience at Virginia Polytechnic Institute in Blacksburg, Va. that
the Republicans have been trying to ``trash educational opportunity
across the country.''
   Bentsen planned to spend today in the Senate, including a
procedural vote on a politically-sensitive textile trade bill.
   Quayle, an Indiana Senator, was also in Washington.

   Republican presidential nominee George
Bush today confused the anniversary of Pearl Harbor Day as he
delivered a tough defense speech to a national American Legion
convention.
   In his talk to about 7,000 members of the nation's largest
veterans' organization, the vice president also said a Democratic
administration would leave the nation ``hostage to Soviet ballistic
missiles.''
   But murmurs spread through the audience as Bush said,``I wonder
how many Americans remember that today is Pearl Harbor Day: 47
years ago to this very day we were hit and hit hard at Pearl
Harbor. And we were not ready ...''
   However, a few minutes into his speech Bush paused abruptly and
said, ``Did I say Sept. 7? Strike that. Dec. 7, 1941,'' Bush, a
World War II Navy pilot, added, ``I'm glad I corrected that, I saw
this guy shaking me off out here.''
   Bush's correction on the date of the Japanese invasion of the
Hawaiian naval base that triggered U.S. entry in World War II won a
good-natured round of applause and laughter from his audience.
   Sheila Tate, Bush's press secretary, said: ``It was 47 years ago
this year and he just said today. He wasn't thinking.''
   The Pearl Harbor remark did not appear in a prepared text of the
vice president's speech.
   Bush spoke a day after President Reagan told the same group that
a victory by Democrats in December would return the nation to a
``Disneyland defense policy.''
   Bush continued along the same vein, claiming rival Michael
Dukakis would weaken the nation's defense.
   ``I do not doubt my opponent's patriotism. But patriotism is not
the issue. The issue is how best to deter war, to keep peace and to
fulfill our country's special responsibility as leader of the free
world,'' Bush said.
   He voiced his strong support for the Reagan's administration's
``Star Wars'' missile defense system.
   ``My opponent opposes the Strategic Defense Initiative. But,
like you in the American Legion, I support it. We canot leave
America hostage to Soviet ballistic missiles,'' Bush said.
   The vice president also said that, if elected, he would not
hesitate in ordering the kind of preemptive military strike that
Reagan called for in 1986 against Libya, if conditions warranted.
   He also said that he would continue to press for the
administration's effort to make the Veterans Administration a
full-fledged Cabinet agency _ if such legislation does not pass
during the rest of Reagan's term.
   On Tuesday, Bush said his experience makes him better able than
Dukakis to keep his cool in the face of the kind of heavy-duty
heckling both candidates were exposed to on the campaign trail.
   ``If I hadn't been through demonstrations before, I would have
gotten a lot tenser,'' Bush told reporters after being jeered by
shipyard workers in Portland, Ore.
   The Democratic nominee, campaigning in the Chicago area,
encountered noisy anti-abortion protesters for the second day in a
row.
   ``I've seen campaigns before,'' Bush said in Everett, Wash.
``I've been at this level of American politics before and there's
nothing like it. It's unique. It's his (Dukakis') first exposure.
   ``When it happens, you don't need to get all uptight about it
and act like you're being put upon, because this is how it works at
this level in politics.''
   Bush will focus on Middle East policy at an address later in the
day to a B'nai B'rith convention in Baltimore.
   Booed and jeered loudly by several hundred unionized iron
workers, some of whom were waving Dukakis signs, Bush told his Port
of Portland audience: ``Don't listen to all this Dukakis stuff.
They're on the ropes and they have to make all this noise.''
   The GOP nominee was taunted and jeered as he spoke to iron
workers at a shipyard. The hard-hattd workers accused Bush of
``union busting'' and booed insistently throughout his speech.
   Bush returned the fire, telling the iron workers to quiet down
and listen to him defend the Reagan administration's record on
job-creation.
   ``The Democrats are trying to mislead you,'' he said. ``Things
aren't going to get worse unless they get elected. I know the truth
sometimes hurts.''
   Bush also produced a 38-year-old union card showing he was a
member of the United Steelworkers of America. Bush belonged to the
union for a brief period when he lived in Compton, Calif., and sold
oil drilling equipment for a Texas-based company. His dues were
paid for 1950 through payroll deductions, the card stated.
   ``How many guys running for president of the United States has
been a member of the U.S. Steelworkers Union?'' Bush asked.
``You're looking at one.''
   Aboard Air Force Two, Bush said the intensity of the protest
surprised him, but he added he may have scored a few points.
   ``When we were in there at the lunch counter, this guy came up
and he says `I'm not for you, I'm still not for you. But you've got
a lot of guts to show up.' Which is nice.''
   Bush said that he counted at least ``two loudmouths'' in the
crowd clearly for him, ``so when I needed succor, I would turn to
them.''

   Mike Tyson, who suffered a concussion when he
smashed his car into a tree, had told his wife shortly before the
crash that he was going to try to kill himself, a newspaper
reported today.
   The Daily News said the information came from ``individuals with
an intimate knowledge'' of Tyson's situation.
   Tyson remains in Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center where he
was taken Sunday after his car struck a tree at the upstate home of
a friend. Doctors said Tuesday that Tyson had lost consciousness
for about 20 minutes and suffered a concussion and amnesia.
   Tyson's Oct. 22 title defense against Frank Bruno in England was
indefinitely postponed because of the injuries.
   ``I'm going to go out and kill myself,'' the Daily News said
Tyson is reported to have told his wife, actress Robin Givens.
``I'm going to crash my car.''
   A source close to Tyson told The Associated Press that the
heavyweight champion was ``brooding all week'' because his wife
refused to be with him at his upstate New York training site,
instead chosing to ``hang out with her fancy friends at the U.S.
Open.''
   The source, however, called any suicide threats just ``idle
threats'' and said those close to Tyson believed he was simply
``looking for a little attention'' from his wife.
   The New York Post today quoted Ruth Roper, Givens' mother, as
saying, ``Mike did absolutely not try to kill himself.''
   Repeated efforts by The Associated Press to reach Tyson's
manager Bill Cayton by telephone were unsuccessful. Dan Klores, a
spokesman for Tyson, said a statement on the Daily News report
would probably be issued later today.
   The News said that after the accident Givens, who is a star of
the ABC television series ``Head of the Class,'' called Tyson's
aides and managers and told them, ``Michael just tried to kill
himself.''
   And the News said Tyson reportedly told Givens in his hospital
room: ``I told you I'd do it. And as soon as I get out of here,
I'll do it again.''
   The News said that according to sources close to Tyson, the
champion has suffered a chemical imbalance since childhood that
prods him to violence, including incidents in which he beat or
threatened his wife.
   According to the News, a psychiatrist treating Tyson has
recommended that he be committed for psychiatric evaluation.
   Doctors evaluating Tyson's physical condition said it would 30
to 60 days before he could resume training.
   The Bruno fight originally was set for Oct. 8, but was postponed
a first time after Tyson broke a bone in his right hand during a
pre-dawn scuffle with former boxer Mitch Green on a New York City
sidewalk.

   Republican Sen. Chic Hecht brushed
aside a primary challenger and promised ``the most exciting race
Nevada has ever had'' as he began his underdog campaign against
popular Democratic Gov. Dick Bryan.
   Bryan, who turned back three challengers of his own in a primary
Tuesday, said ``we feel that we've generated some momentum, but as
we've said from the very beginning this is going to be a very tough
race.''
   A poll taken in August for the gaming industry showed Bryan with
a 14-point lead over Hecht, who is seeking a second term. Hecht
said Tuesday that his own polls show him trailing Bryan by 5
percent to 6 percent and said that was ``right where we want to
be.''
   With all precincts reporting from Tuesday's voting, Bryan, 51,
had 61,987 votes or 80 percent. Patrick Fitzpatrick had 4,691 votes
or 6 percent, Manford ``Cave Rock Manny'' Beals had 2,651 votes or
3 percent, and Larry Kepler had 1,650 votes or 2 percent. ``None,''
an option listed on the ballot, drew 6,991 votes or 9 percent.
   On the GOP side, Hecht, 59, had 55,352 votes or 82 percent,
Larry Scheffler, owner of a graphics business, had 5,617 votes or 8
percent, and 6,454 voters or 10 percent favored ``None.
   Hecht has attacked Bryan as too pro-labor and says the
``out-of-state labor bosses want to control the Senate.''
   Bryan has characterized Hecht as ineffectual and said his rival
was wrong in claiming that 42 percent of Bryan's campaign
contributions came from labor groups. He said he had in fact
received about $189,000 from labor out of $1.8 million, and ``I
don't care if you're using the old math or new math ... that works
out to 10.4 percent.''
   In a GOP congressional primary, Vietnam war hero James ``Bo''
Gritz, who has made forays into Southeast Asia seeking MIAs, lost
to party activist Lucille Lusk. Lusk received 12,075 votes or 48
percent to 10,715 votes or 42 percent for Gritz and 2,562 votes or
10 percent for retiree John Kraft.
   The Democratic incumbent, Jim Bilbray, had no opposition.

<HEAD>Prime Minister Withdraws Resignation, Hints At Split In Leadership</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ED BLANCHE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Iran's prime minister withdrew his
resignation under orders from Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, Iran's
official media reported Wednesday, but he hinted at wide splits in
Tehran's leadership.
   The Islamic Republic News Agency, monitored in Nicosia, said
premier Hussein Musavi told Khomeini in a letter Tuesday night that
he agreed to retract his resignation ``out of concern for Islam and
the revolution and the interests of the country.''
   Musavi later chaired a meeting of his 21-member Cabinet and said
Khomeini's ``instruction'' was a ``divine gift,'' Tehran Radio
reported.
   But in a rare admission by an Iranian leader, he was quoted as
citing ``difficulties in the decision-making process in the
executive'' that he hoped Khomeini's action would eliminate.
   He did not elaborate. But it appeared to be a sideswipe at
President Ali Khamenei, one of his political rivals, underlining
the divisions that have beset the Tehran hierarchy for some time.
   Khomeini's intervention after Musavi submitted his resignation
Monday may have defused the political crisis for now.
   But the political divisions were largely set aside during the
eight-year war with Iraq, and Western analysts believe Iran faces a
period of political turbulence now that the fighting has stopped.
   Musavi said he was resigning because as many as eight of his
ministers, more than one-third of his Cabinet, would fail to win a
vote of confidence in the Majlis, Iran's 270-seat parliament.
   On Tuesday, hours before the parliament was to vote on the
Cabinet, Khamenei's office said Musavi's resignation was turned
down.
   IRNA said Musavi agreed to stay on after Khomeini told him:
``Your resignation letter caused some surprise. ... You should have
at least mentioned something about it to me or high-ranking
officials.''
   Khomeini's letter, broadcast by Tehran Radio, told Musavi: ``In
the event that you fail to reach agreement as regards some of the
ministers, actions will be carried out as they were in the past.''
   Khomeini did not elaborate. But he rescued Musavi from a
no-confidence vote in the Majlis four years ago by appealing to
deputies for unity while Iran was at war with Iraq.
   The revolutionary patriarch stressed: ``It is the legal right of
the Majlis to vote for any minister that it desires to vote for.
   ``In these days, when the people are sending their children to
the fronts of sacrifice to assist Islam, it is no time for
complaining and resigning ... You should continue your service in
your bastion as prime minister.''
   Tuesday's parliamentary session was canceled after Musavi's
resignation was announced, but a new session was scheduled for
Sunday.
   Rival factions in Tehran have disputed postwar policies,
particularly the task of reconstruction and efforts by Parliament
Speaker Hashemi Rafsanjani to bring Iran out of political isolation.
   Rafsanjani, the acting military commander and the most powerful
figure in Iran after Khomeini, and Khamenei favor seeking foreign
investment to help rebuild the country's shattered economy.
   Musavi, a radical technocrat who has been premier for seven
years, opposes outside intervention. He fears it will drive Iran
into debt and allow in the multinationals booted out after the 1979
revolution.
   Philip Robbins of the London-based Royal Institute for
International Affairs said: ``It was easy enough to decide during
the war not to take loans from the West when no one was offering
them anyway.
   ``But now Western companies are willing to do business with
Iran, that presents the Iranians with some difficult decisions,''
he said in a telephone interview.
   Musavi, despite impeccable revolutionary credentials, has no
power base of his own like Rafsanjani, Khamenei and Interior
Minister Ali Akbar Mohtashemi, a hardliner whose influence is
growing.
   Iran's internal divisions were sharpened when Khomeini decided
last month to accept a U.N.-sponsored cease-fire in the war with
Iraq after a string of battlefield defeats.
   Musavi won a personal vote of confidence in parliament in July,
squelching speculation that he might be eased out and replaced,
possibly by Mohtashemi.
   But the political feuding probably will come to a head by next
year when Khamenei's term as president expires, analysts said.
Khomeini has decreed Khamenei cannot run again.
   The debate over Iran's direction in the postwar era is only part
of the power struggle between rival factions over who will fill the
political vacuum when Khomeini dies.
   The 88-year-old revolutionary leader reportedly has been ailing.
Iranian leaders have denied that, but Khomeini has appeared
increasingly frail in recent public appearances.

   President Reagan has nominated Lt. Gen. Robert
W. RisCassi for promotion to four-star general and appointment as
vice chief of staff for the Army, the Pentagon said Wednesday.
   Assuming Senate confirmation, RisCassi, 52, would succeed the
retiring Gen. Arthur E. Brown Jr. as the Army's second-ranking
officer, the Pentagon said.
   RisCassi, a native of Hartford, Conn., now is director of the
joint staff for the Joint Chiefs of Staff. He would be replaced in
that post by Air Force Lt. Gen. Hansford T. Johnson, 52, the
Pentagon said.
   Johnson, a native of Aiken, S.C., now is deputy
commander-in-chief of the U.S. Central Command, the organization
responsible for all American forces in the Middle East.

   The State Department criticized Nicaragua on
Wednesday for refusing to allow the United States to replace eight
diplomats whom the Sandinista government expelled two month ago.
   In addition, department spokesman Charles Redman said Nicaragua
is not issuing visas to U.S. diplomats assigned to replace envoys
being routinely reassigned or to personnel seeking to visit the
embassy on official business.
   The Sandinistas appear to be engaged in an effort ``to obstruct
the normal functioning of our diplomatic mission,'' Redman said,
adding that the policy contradicts Nicaragua's stated wish to
improve relations with the United States.
   The personnel shortage in Managua prevents the embassy from
providing normal economic and political reporting and precludes
normal consular services, he said.
   On July 11, Nicaragua expelled Ambassador Richard Melton and
seven other diplomats, charging they were attempting to destabilize
Nicaragua.
   In response, the United States expelled Nicaraguan Ambassador
Carlos Tunnermann and seven of his colleagues. Tunnermann had
served both as ambassador to the United States and to the
Organization of American States.
   The Nicaraguan government said the expulsion of Tunnermann was
illegal because envoys assigned to international bodies such as the
OAS cannot be targets of retaliation in bilateral political
disputes.
   U.S. diplomats in Managua have been told that the visas sought
by the United States will be approved if Tunnermann is allowed to
return to his post in Washington.
   Meanwhile, Redman said, the United States will not allow the
Nicaraguan government to replace the expelled envoys so long as the
Sandinistas continue to refuse visas for U.S. diplomats.

<TEXT>
   A 5-day-old gorilla may soon believe
his mother is Edna Moore, who has made a place for the baby ape in
her home.
   The infant lowland African gorilla arrived Tuesday on a flight
from New York, wearing diapers and a white hooded sweatshirt. He
snuggled close to Mrs. Moore, who will raise him until he is old
enough to join his brother, Jamie, at the Rio Grande Zoo.
   Mrs. Moore, wife of zoo Director John Moore, has raised other
gorillas. She said her home has been ready for the baby since it
was born Friday.
   ``I just pulled out the bassinet and started sterilizing
bottles,'' she said.
   The ape's mother, Huerfanita, is on loan for breeding purposes
to the Bronx Zoo in New York.
   ``If the mother could raise the baby I would let it,'' Moore
said. ``But sometimes you lose the baby, so you must take every
precaution to keep them because they're so rare.''
   Mrs. Moore fed the baby a bottle of formula milk twice during
the four-hour, 20-minute Lear-jet flight with Albuquerque Journal
Publisher T.H. Lang as pilot. Zoo curator Ingrid Schmidt
accompanied them.
   Mrs. Moore said she believes the infant will begin recognizing
her as his mother in about a month.
   The couple has two children, and they also have raised four
orangutans as well as Jamie since they came to New Mexico.
   Moore says he knows when the raising of the gorillas stops.
   ``The first time they arm wrestle with you and push you to the
table, it's time to make a move to the zoo,'' he said.

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Michael Dukakis switched his focus from the
economy to education today as his campaign and the Democratic Party
began major advertising efforts touting his record as Massachusetts
governor and criticizing Republican policies.
   Dukakis took particular aim at GOP rival George Bush who has
said repeatedly that he wants to be known as ``the education
president.''
   In remarks prepared for delivery during an afternoon appearance
at Kean College in Union, N.J., the Democratic nominee criticized
Reagan administration cuts in federal student aid programs and
outlined his own college opportunity proposal.
   Dukakis described his proposal that would have students receive
a loan in return for their agreement to pay back a percentage of
their income for the rest of their working lives.
   As for Bush, Dukakis asked, ``Where was George Bush while his
administration was doing its best to slam the door of college
opportunity in the face of millions of young people across this
country?''
   ``Where was he while his administration was denying
middle-income families the hope for a future of prosperity and
success for their children?''
   ``George was right there all the time. Not doing and not saying
a thing,'' Dukakis said.
   The Democratic nominee arrived home Tuesday night, ending a
strange campaign day that saw his first event disrupted by
anti-abortion protesters and his only other scheduled event
canceled because of minor problems with his chartered plane.
   The campaign's plane troubles continued today as a second craft
carrying additional reporters, televisions crews and campaign
staffers was grounded in Boston by what aides said was hydraulic
problems. The plane, a Midway Airlines DC-9 jet, was the same one
that Dukakis had flown from Chicago to Boston a day earlier.
   Dukakis, some of his traveling press and campaign aides flew to
New Jersey today in their familiar Presidential Airways Boeing 737.
Dukakis had been forced to abandon that plane in Chicago Tuesday
when a Federal Aviation Administration spot inspection found
several minor maintenance problems.
   The plane was later flown to Boston empty and was back in
service this morning.
   Dukakis wasted no time Tuesday in lashing into Bush for telling
a shipyard worker in Oregon earlier that his wages had dropped from
$13.36 to $9.50 per hour during the Reagan administration because
of ``competitive change.''
   ``George Bush made it clear today that he really does not
understand the hopes and dreams and aspirations of millions and
millions of American workers across this country,'' Dukakis said at
the airport. ``That's not an adequate answer to American workers.''
   In ads that began airing Tuesday in several battleground states,
the Democratic National Committee accuses Reagan and Republicans of
misleading Americans about the threat posed by the federal budget
deficit. The ``Hey Pal'' ad asks voters whether they can afford
four more years of GOP control of the White House _ a question
Dukakis has asked at his recent rallies.
   The DNC will supplement that ad later this week with another
commercial focusing on the ``bring prosperity home'' theme, Dukakis
spokesman Leslie Dach said.
   The Dukakis ad, which began airing nationally Tuesday night, is
titled ``New Era'' and was shown in California and Texas prior to
the Republican National Convention. It features a montage of shots
from Dukakis' speech at the Democratic convention and lists his
major accomplishments as governor.
   The Dukakis campaign also began airing a third ad just in Texas,
a 30-second spot touting Dukakis and his running mate, Texas Sen.
Lloyd Bentsen, for supporting legislation to give workers 60 days'
notice before a plant closing.
   Reagan and Bush opposed the legislation but the president
allowed it to become law without his signature. Bush's running
mate, Indiana Sen. Dan Quayle, led the Senate opposition to the
measure; Bentsen was its chief sponsor.
   The ad shows a red stamp reading ``No'' superimposed over photos
of Bush and Quayle as the announcer says, ``Shouldn't there be a
law to give you and your community 60 days' notice?''
   A Dukakis-Bentsen campaign logo then appears on the screen as
the announcer says, ``The choice is clear.''
   Dukakis spent several hours Tuesday stuck in Chicago while the
Federal Aviation Administration conducted a surprise inspection of
his Presidential Airways charter. Inspectors found three minor
safety problems, forcing Dukakis to cancel an appearance in Ohio.
The Boeing 737 was repaired in Chicago and was to rejoin the
campaign today.
   His only other appearance came in what usually is friendly turf
for Dukakis _ an ethnic gathering. But his speech at a
Polish-American restaurant outside Chicago was delayed for several
minutes because of anti-abortion protesters, several of whom were
pushed and dragged out of the hall by Dukakis supporters.
   Dukakis says he personally opposes abortion but believes women
should be allowed to choose to have an abortion.
   On the flight home, Dukakis joined the pilot and co-pilot in the
cockpit for the landing in Boston. Just after the plane landed a
cone over the rear galley popped off and dropped to the tarmac. The
pilot said a passenger had pulled an emergency release cable that
opens the cone only when the plane is on the ground.

   The U.S. Postal Service announced Wednesday it

postal workers in that country.
   British postal deliveries are nearly at a halt and 100 million
pieces of undelivered mail have piled up in a week-old nationwide
strike that idled more than half of the country's 180,000 postal
workers.
   The embargo ``was requested by the British postal administration
because of it's inability to handle any volume of mail,'' a Postal
Service statement said.
   Mail to Britain will be returned to senders. People who get such
mail back can apply to their local post office for a refund of the
postage.

   Seven sculptures in a city park are anyone's for
the asking _if they can lug them away.
   The weighty pieces of art that turned a downtown lot into
Sculpture Park have to be moved to make way for development, say
owners of the land.
   ``We've got these two-ton canaries to dispose of,'' said Suzanne
Clarke McDonough, a leader of Sculpture Chicago, a non-profit
group. ``It's no joke.''
   The sculptures are made of steel plates and chains and other
heavy materials. Artists have taken all the sculptures but seven.
One will go on a long-term loan and six with no strings attached.
   ``We have to have the site cleared by mid-September, or I'm
afraid ... they could be demolished,'' Ms. McDonough said.

   Two Oklahoma ranchers say their Nebraska
counterparts should get their heads out of the sand, and join their
boom industry _ raising ostriches.
   Mike and Doug Stickler told farmers at the Nebraska State Fair
they dropped out of the cattle feeding business three years ago to
concentrate on ostriches, those big, long-necked birds who can
gallop at 45 mph for 30 minutes and can kill you with a swipe of a
foot.
   The family bought three breeding females and a male. This year,
they got 102 eggs and 75 percent of them have made it to the
yearling stage. Yearling pairs can fetch up to $15,000, Doug
Stickler says. Chicks sell for about $1,500 apiece.
   Their leather, which stretches to 12 to 15 square feet, brings
$25 a square foot or higher, depending on quality. A full set of
feathers fetches about $200. Their meat brings about $7 a pound and
ostrich jerky sells for about $17 a pound. Even their eggshells
sell for $35 to $50 each.
   ``We tell farmers that this is a good alternative to wheat,
cattle and corn,'' Doug Stickler said. ``Farmers are bullheaded and
don't want to quit farming. This has been an excellent business for
us.''

<HEAD>Security Forces Shoot Looters; Diplomats Evacuating Dependents</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Mobs plundered government offices and
warehouses Wednesday, and state radio said security forces shot
five looters. Diplomats said chaos was near and prepared to
evacuate their families.
   Opposition leaders called for a nationwide general strike
against 26 years of repressive one-party rule on Thursday. Leaders
hoped for the largest of the many mass protests that have driven
two governments from office in less than two months.
   Looters ranged through the capital, and one Western diplomat
said: ``The streets are deserted. People are pretty much in fear of
their property. Things have pretty much closed down. There is a
widespread perception that things have deteriorated.''
   State-run Rangoon Radio reported looting in 38 areas of the
capital Tuesday and Wednesday. It said security forces shot and
killed five people, wounded six and arrested 88 looters.
   The radio urged people to report looters to police and said more
than $43 million in state property had been plundered since the
beginning of August.
   An earlier broadcast said security forces would ``open fire to
impose control'' if looting continued, but the order would not
apply to peaceful anti-government demonstrations.
   Soldiers fired into crowds of unarmed demonstrators last month,
killing 112 people by government count and several hundred
according to other reports.
   Army trucks patrolled the main streets shortly after the radio
announcement late Wednesday morning.
   In its 8 p.m. broadcast, Rangoon Radio said the government was
invoking a 1987 order banning demonstrations at the Parliament
building and several other sites.
   Minutes later, groups of protesters could be heard shouting:
``Down with the Burma Socialist Program Party government! We will
go on demonstrating!'' The party has ruled since a military coup by
Ne Win in 1962 with socialist policies that have isolated Burma and
brought economic ruin on a nation rich in resources.
   Party leaders plan a special meeting Monday to consider holding
a referendum on one-party rule, as promised by President Maung
Maung, but opponents demand an interim government leading to
democracy.
   Because the situation is ``sliding towards chaos,'' up to 100
dependents of U.S. Embassy employees will be evacuated as soon as
possible, said the Western diplomat, who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
   Ross Petzing of the U.S Embassy in Bangkok, Thailand, said:
``It's just a precautionary measure due to the unpredictability of
events over the next week and we hope it will be temporary.''
   He said the first group of 45 Americans would arrive in Bangkok
on Thursday unless strikes grounded the flight.
   Other diplomats said 41 Thai Embassy dependents would leave
Thursday, but the Foreign Ministry in Bangkok said no final
decision had been made.
   Diplomats said the Italian, Israeli and several other embassies
had evacuated dependents and the Japanese and larger Western
embassies were considering doing so.
   Demonstrators have not threatened foreigners, and the U.S.
Embassy has been favorite rallying point, with protesters
applauding the American flag.
   Vernon A. Walters, U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, said
Wednesday during a visit to Bangkok the United States will ``do
everything we can to see Burma's passage to freedom occur in a
peaceful way if at all possible.''
   The Western diplomat said he saw about 10 trucks, each carrying
at least 20 soldiers, parked Tuesday night near the Shwedagon
Pagoda and around Rangoon University, where students plan
anti-government strategy.
   He described it as the largest force he had seen in Rangoon in
two weeks.
   Many residents barred the doors of their homes and shops as
looters raided raided the Customs Department warehouse, an
Education Department building, Rangoon University, livestock and
poultry farms, soap and textile factories and rice barges along the
Rangoon River.
   Thieves seized air conditioners and office equipment from the
local office of the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization and
ramsacked warehouses of the U.N. Children's Fund.
   Looting began after a general strike Aug. 8 that caused a
gradual breakdown in government control and spread to downtown
Rangoon on Tuesday.
   The Western diplomat said the looting is ``an act of
desperation'' by poor people who need food and other supplies in a
city paralyzed by strikes and protests.
   Turmoil began in Burma with student riots in September 1987 that
led to street protests in March and June.
   Ne Win resigned July 23 and was succeeded by a hard-line former
general, Sein Lwin, who lasted only 17 days. Maung Maung is the
first civilian leader since 1962.

   Changes in adoption laws designed to
curb illegal ``baby trade'' have restricted the ability of
foreigners to adopt Filipino youngsters and may mean that many will
spend their childhood in orphanages.
   New regulations, which took effect Aug. 3, ban adoptions of
Filipino children by foreigners residing in the country unless at
least one prospective parent is related to the child.
   Foreigners living abroad can still adopt Filipino children
through international agencies. But prospective parents living here
will have to return to their own country and file papers there
through an international agency.
   The procedure can take years, depending on the adoption laws in
the country where the papers are filed.
   Government figures indicate that in recent years about 17
percent of the 2,500 children adopted here annually have been taken
by foreigners residing in the Philippines and who were not related
to the child.
   More than a third of all adoptions of Filipino children are by
foreigners, including those who file papers abroad and would not be
affected by the changes.
   ``The new code is not anti-foreigner,'' said Lourdes Balanon,
assistant director of the government's Bureau of Child and Youth
Welfare. ``It is an effort by the government to protect our
children.''
   Ms. Balanon said that in the past foreigners could adopt
Filipino children in a few weeks. Previous regulations allowed
single foreigners to adopt with much less red tape than in the
United States or other countries.
   Ms. Balanon added that although many of the adoptive foreign
parents were of good character, others may have been fronts for
``baby trading'' _ selling youngsters to couples abroad who were
unable to have children.
   ``Mothers were convinced to give up their children, and even
kidnapping may have been encouraged,'' she said.
   Because local adoptions usually were arranged without the
services of an international agency, the government here had no way
of ensuring the child's welfare once the parents left the country.
   But some welfare workers fear the new regulations will
discourage legitimate adoptions by qualified foreign families,
living in a country without a tradition of taking in children who
are not related to those who adopt them.
   In Filipino society, adoption of children with no blood ties is
rare. Government figures show that in the past two years, only 5
percent of the children adopted here were taken by Filipino couples
who were not related by blood.
   Traditionally, orphans and children of impoverished parents
unable to care for them become the responsibility of the ``extended
family'' _ uncles, aunts, cousins and grandparents.
   But children born out of wedlock are often kept secret from
their families.
   Abortion is technically illegal and birth control is frequently
shunned in this predominantly Roman Catholic country. Unwed mothers
find themselves under tremendous social pressure to turn their
infants over to religious or government orphanages.
   In other cases, extended families sometimes are too poor to take
in another child.
   ``Older children will be especially affected,'' said Lisa
Hechenova of the Asilio de San Vincente de Paul Orphange in Manila.
``Because if Filipinos adopt at all, they want infants. Foreigners
are more inclined to accept toddlers and even 6-to-10-year olds.''
   Jose, a 3-year-old toddler at Manila's Hospicio de San Jose
Orphanage, is one of those children who, because of new
regulations, may never have a home. He has been at the orphanage
for more than eight months because officials have had difficulty
finding him a home and the new changes in the law will make it even
more difficult.
   Seven-year-old Maria was among the last children adopted by a
resident foreign couple. She was given in July to a European couple.
   Maria said she never knew her natural parents.
   ``But I used to dream about them every night. Only they didn't
have faces.''

   Sen. Joseph R. Biden Jr., saying he is ``a
little wiser ... more serene'' returned to the Senate Wednesday,
nearly seven months after he underwent emergency brain surgery to
repair an aneurysm.
   Looking tanned and trim as he stepped off the train from
Wilmington, Del., Biden plunged into a busy first day, attending a
surprise party in his office, talking with reporters, chairing a
Foreign Relations subcommittee hearing on presidential war powers,
and voting in the Senate.
   Later, the Senate put aside business on a textile bill to pay
tribute to Biden.
   With Biden's parents, wife, children and other relatives looking
on from the gallery, the Senate voted unanimously to welcome him
back and gave him a standing ovation. A parade of senators from
both parties took the floor to praise Biden, including 87-year-old
John Stennis, D-Miss., who had been a fellow hospital patient.
   ``Having friends make a difference. Having a place you want to
be makes a difference,'' Biden said in an emotional thank-you
speech.
   ``I'm more happy to be back than you can imagine,'' the
45-year-old senator told his staff, which had draped his office in
balloons and ``Welcome Back, Senator'' banners.
   Biden, who last year was a candidate for the Democratic
presidential nomination later captured by Massachusetts Gov.
Michael Dukakis, reflected on the 12-month period that took him
from the campaign trail to the hospital.
   Biden said his withdrawal from the race ``saved my life. My
doctors told me the prospects of my still being alive if I stayed
in the presidential race were very remote.
   ``There is no way I would have been the candidate,'' Biden said.
``I either would have died or been in the hospital.''
   Biden also said he bore no grudge against the Dukakis aide whose
leaked reports to the press helped end Biden's campaign.
   John Sasso, who was fired by Dukakis and then recently rehired,
had given reporters information that Biden had taken quotes from a
British politician and used them, unattributed, in his own speeches.
   ``Any personal feeling disappeared between the first aneurysm
and the blood clot,'' Biden joked, adding that he would work for
Dukakis in this fall's presidential campaign.
   Biden was hospitalized last February, complaining of neck pain
and nausea. A middle-of-the-night emergency transfer brought Biden
from a hospital in Wilmington to Walter Reed Army Medical Center in
Washington. Hours later, he was operated on for an aneurysm in an
artery supplying blood to his brain.
   Another, smaller, aneurysm was found and Biden underwent
additional surgery on May 3.
   Looking back over the year, Biden said ``I hope than I'm a
little wiser. I think I have a somewhat more serene outlook _ not a
sense of urgency.''
   ``I thought a lot about whether I wanted to stay in this
business,'' Biden said of his lengthy recuperation. ``I like what I
do. I'm very good at what I do ... It made me eager to get back to
do my job.''
   Biden was welcomed back by Senate Majority Leader Robert C.
Byrd, D-W.Va., and Republican Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan.
   ``We've greatly missed his leadership, his counsel, his warm
sense of humor over the past months,'' Byrd said. ``But you can
always count on Senator Biden to overcome any adversity.''
   ``Joe had a tough time of it over the past seven months,'' Dole
said. ``But to the surprise of no one who knows Joe Biden's spirit
and tenacity, he triumphed.''

   Rep. Connie Mack III, fresh from victory in a
Republican Senate primary, said Wednesday the GOP has a
``tremendous opportunity'' to reclaim the seat, while two Democrats
launched a runoff campaign that threatens to divide the party.
   The conservative Mack, grandson and namesake of the legendary
Philadelphia A's baseball manager, turned back a challenge from
former outspoken federal prosecutor Robert Merkle in Tuesday's
voting.
   State Insurance Commissioner Bill Gunter led a six-way
Democratic race, but failed to win a majority and will compete Oct.
4 against the second-place finisher, Rep. Kenneth ``Buddy'' MacKay.
   In a Nevada Senate primary, Republican Sen. Chic Hecht coasted
to nomination for a second term and will face Democratic Gov. Dick
Bryan, who buried three challengers.
   The Florida seat at stake is now occupied by Democrat Lawton
Chiles, who decided to retire after three terms.
   Mack, 47, began his day in Key West, 90 miles from Communist
Cua, to emphasize his campaign theme of ``less taxes, less
spending, less government _ more freedom.''
   He pledged to reach out to ``conservative Democrats'' and said,
``We felt all along we had a tremendous opportunity, and obviously,
if that becomes a very tense runoff election that's divisive, plus
we add to that George Bush is running very strongly in Florida,
that just adds to our opportunity.''
   Mack got campaign help during the primary from President Reagan
and indicted former National Security Council aide Oliver North,
and expects strong national Republican support for the general
election.
   MacKay, meanwhile, picked up the endorsement of Rep. Dan Mica,
who ran third in Tuesday's primary. Mica overwhelmingly carried his
home Palm Beach County and neighboring Broward, and MacKay, from
Ocala in north-central Florida, said Mica's support should be ``a
tremendous help'' in South Florida.
   ``We're in high gear now, but we've got a lot of work to do,''
MacKay, 55, said as he headed to South Florida for joint news
conferences with Mica.
   Gunter, insurance commissioner since 1976, was in Tallahassee
working out strategy for his third Senate runoff. He told reporters
he wasn't surprised by the Mica endorsement of his opponent, and
said he was pleased with his first-place standing, although he has
slipped from initial polls four months ago.
   ``When you've got undecided voters and when you have a situation
where the front-runner is being dumped on as I was, you're going to
see some settling,'' Gunter said. ``I'm delighted with our
position.''
   Gunter and MacKay both expressed hope for a positive runoff
campaign, but they clashed repeatedly during the primary campaign,
as they had in the 1980 Senate primary.
   Democrats hold a 3-2 lead in statewide voter registration, but
intraparty divisions caused by bitter runoffs were blamed for their
defeat in the 1986 governor's race and 1980 Senate race.
   MacKay, 55, had accused Gunter, 54, of conflict of interest for
accepting contributions from the industry he regulates, and his
campaign manager, Greg Farmer, called Gunter's 12 years in his
current office ``a saga of sleaze.'' Gunter called MacKay
hypocritical for accepting funds from political action committees
that he said wanted to influence votes in ``the ultimate regulatory
body _ Congress.''
   MacKay ran third in the 1980 primary in which Gunter ran second,
then defeated incumbent Richard Stone in a runoff. Gunter lost to
Republican Paula Hawkins, but Democrat Bob Graham won that seat
back by defeating Mrs. Hawkins in 1986.
   With all votes counted, Mack had 394,444 votes, or 62 percent,
to Merkle's 244,926 votes, or 38 percent.
   Gunter tallied 372,434 votes or 38 percent, followed by MacKay
with 258,648 votes or 26 percent. Mica, 44, was third with 179,729
votes or 18 percent. State Sen. Patricia ``Pat'' Frank had 117,379
votes, or 12 percent.
   Former Republican Gov. Claude R. Kirk, 62, was fifth with 50,304
votes or 5 percent, and former Senate postal clerk Fred Rader, 41,
had 11,617 votes for 1 percent.
   Elsewhere in Florida, 10-term Democratic Rep. William Chappell
of Ormond Beach captured 70 percent of the vote against primary
challenger Charley Roberts, a retired Army veteran. Chappell's name
has been mentioned in published reports about the defense
procurement probe, but he denied wrongdoing.
   Mack's predecessor, L.A. ``Skip'' Bafalis, made it into a runoff
as he sought to win back the congressional seat he gave up to run
for governor in 1982. In a five-way race, he finished second with
29 percent to former Lee County Commissioner Porter Goss, who had
38 percent. Retired Army. Gen. James Dozier, held hostage 42 days
in 1981 by Red Brigade terrorists in Italy, finished third, at 18
percent.

   The State Department said Wednesday it has
asked the government of Burundi to accept international involvement
into an inquiry on last month's tribal massacre that is believed to
have claimed thousands of lives.
   Department spokesman Charles Redman said the inquiry would cover
both the causes and solutions to the violence that has erupted
periodically in Burundi, in central Africa.
   More than 100,000 Hutus, who make up more than 85 percent of the
population, were killed in 1972 and an estimated 5,000 died in the
slaughter last month. The Hutus have been feuding for decades with
the Tutsis, who dominate Burundi's politics.
   Redman confirmed earlier independent accounts that government
forces were responsible for some of killings. While condemning the
armed forces' role, he said authorities in Burundi have permitted
journalists and embassy observers free access to area where the
atrocities occurred.
   Redman said there has been no cutoff of U.S. aid but that
officials are assessing the situation.

<HEAD>Public Health Sytem Said To Put Americans At Unnecessary Risk</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JERRY ESTILL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. public health system, largely a
victim of its own success, has eroded to a point where Americans
are at unnecessary risk, a National Academy of Sciences panel said
Wednesday.
   Members of a committee formed by the academy's Institute of
Medicine declined at a news conference to put the blame on any
particular administration or segment of the health community.
   ``I think this is something that has evolved over time,'' said
Bailus Walker Jr., professor of environmental health and toxicology
at State University of New York in Albany and president of the
American Public Health Association.
   Nonetheless, they said the system probably is less equipped to
cope with health emergencies than it was 20 or 30 years ago and
that the first task is to get the public to accept that there is a
problem.
   ``Our guard is now down,'' said Richard D. Remington, chairman
of the committee and professor of preventive medicine and
environmental health at the University of Iowa. ``The American
people must understand that everyone's health will suffer in the
long run if we do not take care now to rebuild the capability of
and confidence in our public health agencies.''
   The report itself said, ``We have slackened our public health
vigilance nationally and the health of the public is unnecessarily
threatened as a result. Public health is a vital function that is
in trouble.''
   It said ``many of the major improvements in the health of the
American people have been accomplished through public health
measures'' but lamented that ``the public has come to take the
success of public health for granted.''
   Joseph Boyle, executive vice president of the American Society
of Internal Medicine and a former president of the American Medical
Association, said part of the problem is dwindling communication
between private doctors and public health officials.
   ``They have lost one another and in the process they have lost
their way,'' said Boyle.
   He noted that individual Americans rely heavily on their
individual physicians for advice on health matters in general,
including what they should demand from government in the way of
public programs.
   Although the 218-page report focuses on examining the public
health system rather than specific health problems, Remington cited
AIDS as an example of a threat the system was not well equipped to
handle.
   ``I think we're going to be treated to more of the same and
worse,'' he said. ``Who knows which environmental problem will
explode next?''
   Not only is AIDS a good example of the kind of new diseases that
can arise, he said, the way it is being dealt with is a good
example of a major problem: Health professions don't trust
politicians and politicians don't trust health professionals.
   ``Both sides are a little bit right and both sides are a little
bit wrong,'' said Remington.
   Walker added that there are ``numerous instances where public
health data suggested one approach and political pressures result
in another.'' Pressed for an example, he cited reluctance by some
government officials to aggressively promote use of condoms as a
barrier to sexual transmission of AIDS.
   Although not linked specifically to AIDS, one section in the
report itself says, ``Public support _ always fragile because of
limited awareness _ is increasingly being eroded by controversy.''
   While elected officials too often eschew unpopular positions on
health issues, health officials too often fail to take into account
the need for public support for public policies, the report said.
   ``Many public health professionals who talked with us seemed to
regard politics as a contaminant of an ideally rational
decision-making process rather than as an essential element of
democratic governance,'' it said.
   The panel cited AIDS and access to health care for the indigent
as examples of ``immediate crises'' but said there are lingering
problems ``with equally great significance for the health of the
public and the well-being of our society.''
   It gave four examples: injuries, teen-age pregnancy, high blood
pressure and smoking and substance abuse.
   The institute also cited toxic substances and Alzheimer disease
as ``time bombs'' that will require increasing attention in coming
years.

   A pickup truck carrying eight

early Wednesday, critically injuring four youths, authorities said.
   Three others had moderate injuries and the driver suffered minor
injuries, said Deputy Dan Cox of the Los Angeles County Sheriff's
Department.
   Six of the youths were riding in the pickup's open bed, said
fire Capt. Charles Seder.
   The truck went off the road in Angeles National Forest at 2:40
a.m. Rescuers were summoned about 3:15 a.m., Cox said.
   Helicopters lifted the injured out of the forest and flew them
to Henry Mayo Newhall Memorial Medical Center and Northridge

   Anyone who illegally dumps the kind of
infectious medical wastes that turned 1988 into a nightmare for
beachgoers faces longer jail terms and stiffer fines under
legislation signed into law Wednesday.
   Gov. Mario Cuomo said the syringes, blood vials and other
medical debris that washed ashore this summer ``threaten the
livelihood of thousands who work at our beaches and the enjoyment
of the millions of New Yorkers who use the beaches for recreation.''
   Several popular beaches were temporarily closed during the
state's hottest summer in decades when the debris came ashore.
   Under the bill approved by Cuomo, penalties of up to four years
in prison and fines of up to $50,000 could be brought against
people convicted of illegally disposing of so-called red bag
medical wastes. The name refers to waste that is to be thrown out
in specially marked containers.
   Previously, state law had provided for illegal medical waste
dumpers to face up to 15 days in jail and fines of up to to $2,500,
according to state Department of Environmental Conservation
spokesman R.W. Groneman.
   Cuomo also said he signed a companion bill Wednesday that
provides $2 million to pay for stepped up enforcement of the
infectious waste disposal rules by the state departments of
Environmental Conservation and Parks, Recreation and Historic
Preservation.
   The bills are aimed at putting teeth into regulations recently
established by the state Environmental Conservation and Health
departments that set out guidelines for disposal of medical wastes
and require ``cradle to grave'' tracking.
   Among the debris discovered on New York beaches this summer were
vials containing human blood infected with the HIV-virus _ the
AIDS-related immune system deficiency _ and hepatitis, according to
state Health Department tests.
   Groneman said the DEC has not finalized its report on the source
of the debris.

   Alvaro Garza Jr., who survived 45 minutes
underwater in a river last December, began a new school year
feeling completely recovered.
   ``I'm going to be able to do everything on my own now,'' said
Alvaro, who was trailed by reporters and photographers Tuesday, his
first day of sixth grade.
   The 11-year-old boy fell through ice on the Red River, which
divides Moorhead from Fargo, N.D., as he tried to retrieve a dead
squirrel. When pulled out of the water by rescuers, his body
temperature was 77 degrees and he showed no signs of life.
   Doctors used a heart-lung bypass machine to warm his body, and
four days later he could communicate by blinking his eyes. He went
home after 17 days in the hospital.

her,'' Mrs. Marx, 50, said in a recent interview.
   Mrs. Marx isn't alone in soliciting funds for Mrs. Reagan's

   Flowers, 48, fell ill Friday night while performing in a

   ``He was hospitalized in Lake Tahoe and today he is being moved

Flowers has suffered from cancer for some time and ``it has been

   The puppeteer created a cast of characters, but it was the
craggy old hussy Madame, manipulated with rods rather than strings,
that launched the popularity of the television and showroom act.

   A homeless woman shot and killed her husband
as they sat under a Monongahela River bridge because the man
refused to share a bottle of vodka with her, authorities said.
   Kathleen T'Souvas, 35, was being held Wednesday without bond in
the Allegheny County Jail on charges she shot her husband, Robert
T'Souvas, 39, once in the head during a dispute Saturday.
   Authorities said the couple, married about nine years,
apparently had traveled around the country in their van, which they
had parked near Three Rivers Stadium or at area service stations
for more than a year.
   The couple left San Jose, Calif., for Pittsburgh on Aug. 20,
1987, according to a diary kept by Mrs. T'Souvas. Police said her
husband carried identification from Oakdale, Calif.
   The couple spent Saturday afternoon drinking under the
Smithfield Street Bridge with David Bozic, 42, also homeless,
according to police. The couple had built a makeshift shelter under
the bridge after their van broke down, police said.
   The three entertained themselves as they drank by shooting at
rats and cans with Bozic's .22-caliber revolver, police said.
   During the evening, T'Souvas apparently refused to share a
bottle of vodka with his companions, police said.
   Bozic said he left to get food and returned, thinking that
T'Souvas was asleep, according to police. He said he didn't realize
T'Souvas was dead until he didn't wake up Sunday, according to
police.
   Authorities said T'Souvas' single head wound was discovered
after his body was taken to the morgue.
   Police said Mrs. T'Souvas' diary included accounts of the
couple's fishing for food, selling blood for money and working
part-time for a free kitchen.

   Arrest warrants were issued Wednesday for two
leaders of a Brazilian-based therapy group after the defendants
failed to appear in federal court on currency violations.
   The defendants were identified by authorities as Norberto Keppe,
founder and head of the International Society of Analytical
Trilogy, and another leader, Claudia Pacheco. Both are Brazilians.
   They were arrested June 24 at Kennedy International Airport for
allegedly failing to report, as required, $100,000 in cash which
was hidden in their luggage, authorities said. They were charged
with two counts of currency violations and if convicted, would face
a maximum of 10 years in prison.
   Trilogy was founded during the 1970s in Brazil by Keppe, who
claims to have developed a method of therapy that can cure mental
and physical illnesses, including cancer and AIDS.
   After the two didn't attend a pretrial hearing Wednesday, U.S.
District Judge Raymond Dearie ordered arrest warrants.
   The prosecutor, Assistant U.S. Attorney Thomas Roche, said the
government also would begin forfeiture proceedings for the
defendants' joint $1 million bail, which was secured by two
buildings owned by the society.
   Harvey Kaminsky, who represents the defendants, told Dearie he
had tried to contact his clients last week and this week but had
not heard from them. He said he did not know where they had gone.
   Kaminsky said Trilogy had about 100 patients in New York,
thousands in Brazil and participants in Europe and other parts of
the world. Patients are encouraged to live in communal households
and attend therapy sessions at least once a week.
   The society also has established various business enterprises,
including a travel agency, cleaning service and a printing house.
   Kaminsky said Keppe and Pacheco were on their way to London to
attend an international conference for Triology when they were
arrested at the airport.

<HEAD>Perez de Cuellar Says Iran-Iraq Peace Talks `Blocked'</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.N. Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar said
Wednesday that the Iran-Iraq peace talks in Geneva are blocked
because Iran refused Iraq's request to discuss navigation and
border issues.
   Perez de Cuellar met briefly with President Francois Mitterrand
at the Elysee Palace to brief him about the talks that began Aug.
25, five days after a U.N.-sponsored cease-fire began in the
eight-year war.
   France, a permanent member of the U.N. Security Council,
presides over the Council.
   The Iran-Iraq negotiations aim to put a permanent end to the war
that has left an estimated 1.5 million people dead.
   Perez de Cuellar told reporters after the meeting he was seeking
a formula to settle the issues that have stalled the U.N. talks in
Geneva.
   ``To be truthful, I cannot say the situation will be unblocked
tomorrow,'' said the secretary-general, who also was scheduled to
meet with Foreign Minister Roland Dumas and Premier Michel Rocard.
   Iran's deputy foreign minister Mohammad Javad Larijani told
reporters, ``You can't say the negotiations are deadlocked, but
they definitely are slowing down.''
   He said the problem was Iraq's wish to discuss freedom of
navigation and the Shatt al-Arab waterway, a section of the border
between the two countries. The border has been a source of dispute
between the two neighbors for 150 years.
   An agreement made in 1975 in Algiers gave half of the waterway
to each country. But Iraq has since renounced the agreement and
claimed all of the waterway.
   Iran has listed as priorities the withdrawal of troops to
international borders, exchange of war prisoners and assigning the
blame for starting the war.
   Larijani said a discussion on the Shatt al-Arab is ``not the
next issue on the agenda'' even though Iran, which has four ports
on the waterway, is interested in the matter.
   ``Changing the borderline is out of the queston,'' Larijani
said, however.
   Larijani met in the French capital with Rocard and Dumas to
bring them up to date on the Iranian point of view in the Geneva
negotiations and to discuss improving relations.
   Paris broke diplomatic relations with Iran in July 1987 after a
dispute involving a French demand to question an Iranian Embassy
employee about a wave of terrorist bombings.
   Relations were resumed in June after that issue was settled and
the last three French hostages held in Lebanon were freed.
   Larijani said Iran appreciated the French naval presence in the
Persian Gulf region. He said it was calm and discreet, compared to
U.S. intervention in the gulf, which he termed ``hysterical.''
   Asked about reports of recent U.S.-Iranian contacts, he denied
there had been any official contact involving high-level officials.
Queried about low-level unofficial contacts, he suggested a
reporter consult the Iranian Foreign Ministry's secret files.

   Alberto Minervini, bearded, in tattered

seized him a month ago.
   The 58-year-old industrialist from Naples and his 15-year-old
grandson were abducted Aug. 5 while vacationing in southern
Calabria. The teen-ager was released the next day, presumably to
pass on a ransom demand.
   Several thousand police joined the hunt, but to no avail.
   Police said Minervini had been chained to a pole and was in weak
physical condition. They said he gave no details of his escape.

   Gov. Mario Cuomo joined the battle against
subway crime Wednesday, helping police run down a man who allegedly
had stolen tokens from a station.
   ``It happened very, very suddenly,'' Cuomo said. ``We joined the
chase.''
   Cuomo was on his way to a school to promote school construction
legislation when he and two state troopers in his car spotted a
group of transit police officers chasing a man with a bag of tokens
around his neck in Harlem.
   Cuomo said his driver, Trooper Mary Ellen Fitzpatrick, tried to
cut the man off with the car. When he kept running, she and Cuomo
jumped out and gave chase.
   Fitzpatrick, who was dressed in a business suit, kicked off her
shoes and ran in her stockings.
   ``I maintain _ she differs with me _ that I beat her down the
block,'' Cuomo later joked.
   The man ran into a store, where he was stopped by a New York
City police officer. He was charged with tampering, larceny and
resisting arrest.
   Al O'Leary, spokesman for the transit police, said the man had
been seen tampering with a turnstile at a subway station, and
personally collecting tokens from passengers.

<HEAD>Nigerian Girl Goes To Court To Stay In United States</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LINCOLN, Neb. (AP) </DATELINE>

   A Nigerian teen-ager who is fighting
deportation to her homeland because she says her father beat her
will be allowed time to pursue her case further, her lawyer said
Wednesday.
   Hours before Omoleura Oyesiji, 17, was to be sent back to
Nigeria on Tuesday, her lawyer, Susan Koenig-Cramer, filed a motion
for a temporary restraining order to block the action.
   During a brief hearing Wednesday, the U.S. Immigration and
Naturalization Service agreed to give Koenig-Cramer an additional
day to file a motion for habeas corpus, which would claim Oyesiji
is being held illegally by the INS. Filing of the motion would
suspend the deportation order until a federal judge rules on it,
said U.S. Attorney Ron Lahners.
   The girl, a high school senior, is to stay with her foster
parents in Omaha until her fate is decided, said Koenig-Cramer. The
attorney said that at very least, she hopes the girl's safety can
be ensured if she returns to Africa.
   In March 1987, Oyesiji moved from Nigeria to Omaha with her
father and stepmother so her father could attend the University of
Nebraska College of Medicine.
   Omaha police responded to a call of a domestic assault at the
family home in September 1987, authorities said. A doctor found
scars on the girl's body, possibly from previous beatings,
Koenig-Cramer said. Though no charges were brought against the
father, the girl was placed in a youth home.
   In December, Oyesiji's father and stepmother moved back to
Nigeria, leaving the girl behind. Because the girl moved to the
United States on her father's visa, she was ordered to be deported,
Koenig-Cramer said.
   The girl's foster mother, Sue Fichter, said she is a dedicated
student who is earning good grades.
   ``She is a terrific girl,'' said Ms. Fichter. ``It was a
supposed to be a temporary stay, but we liked her so much, we asked
her to stay.''
   Lahners said the INS had no choice but to try to deport the
girl, since an immigration judge signed a deportation order in July.
   ``I think the immigration service is being very fair about it,
in allowing the young lady all of her legal rights,'' Lahners said.
``But you must understand their situation. They must enforce the
law.''

<DATELINE>RAMSTEIN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The death toll from the Ramstein
air show disaster rose to 54 on Wednesday when a West German man
died from severe burn injuries, a state official said.
   ``A 35-year-old man died at about 11 a.m. today at a clinic in
Offenbach,'' Rhineland-Palatinate state spokesman Juergen Dietzen
told The Associated Press.
   He said the victim was from Rhineland-Palatinate state.
   Dietzen also said 162 people remained hospitalized from the Aug.
28 disaster at the U.S. Air Force base in Ramstein, in
Rhineland-Palatinate state.
   ``About 30 of them are in serious condition and a few are in
critical condition,'' Dietzen said.
   The Ramstein air show disaster occurred when three Italian
stunt-flying jet planes collided and one of them hurtled into a
huge crowd of people, exploding into a fireball.
   Spectators _ children as well as adults _ ran in terror from the
burning wreckage, many of them with horrible burns. Dietzen said
seven children were among the dead.
   He gave the following nationality breakdown for the dead: 47
Germans, two Americans, one each from France and the Netherlands,
and the three Italian pilots.
   Dietzen also said four people are still missing, but ``there is
no certainty that these people were at the air show.''
   Meanwhile, in Farnborough, England, the first full-scale display
since the disaster began.
   The Red Arrows, the Royal Air Force's display team of seven
scarlet Hawk fighters, performed daredevil aerobatics with
customary flair and precision for a crowd of 35,000. The team will
perform daily through Sunday, when the show ends.
   In Grimbergen, Belgium, an air show scheduled for Sunday was
canceled because of the German disaster, organizers said.
   Grimbergen Airfield Promotion said in a statement the
cancellation of its show was ordered by the town of Grimbergen,
north of Brussels.

   A real estate broker who said six
numbers had been ``driving me crazy'' presented a winning Lotto
ticket today to claim her record $55 million prize.
   Sheela Ryan of Winter Springs said she didn't know what she'd do
with her winnings and was unsure whether she would quit her job.
She can pick up her first check for $2,767,361 next week.
   ``I've always been middle class and the middle class always
needs money,'' she said at a news conference with her two attorneys
and Lottery officials.
   Ms. Ryan, 63, a native New Yorker, said she was single and had
no children.
   She said today marked her first trip on a plane, her first news
conference and ``this is the first time I've ever won $55 million.''
   She said she picked the first six numbers that she read on the
front page of The Orlando Sentinel: 3, 27, 19, 35, 20 and 5. She
bought the winning ticket in the central Florida town of Longwood.
   ``These numbers were driving me crazy,'' she said. She had won
$4 twice previously in the game. Ms. Ryan said she had been buying
four tickets a week until Florida offered a $23 million jackpot in
early August. Since then, she's been buying five tickets.
   Before Ms. Ryan claimed her prize, several dozen Lotto players
claimed they had the winning ticket.
   ``We've had several dozen calls from folks saying, `We have the
winning ticket. What do we do?' without identifying themselves or
their city or anything else,'' Lottery Secretary Rebecca Paul said
Tuesday. ``Until someone comes through the door with a ticket, we
take it all with a grain of salt.''
   It's not a crime to claim a winning lottery ticket, but it's a
felony to present an altered lottery ticket for payment.
   One of the claimants was Charles Hill, an elementary school
janitor in the tiny hamlet of Bristol, about 280 miles northwest of
Longwood. Officials said Hill told them his wet ticket was
recovered from a pile of laundry after Saturday's drawing.
   Hill's claim was enough to get him a $23,000 Chevrolet van with
no cash down.
   Tommy Thomas, owner of a Panama City Chevrolet dealership, said
Tuesday that he gave a brand new mauve van to Hill after Liberty
County Sheriff Harrell W. Revell told the credit manager that the
ticket was bona fide.
   ``We took a chance with them,'' Thomas said. ``I figured if they
were lucky enough to win the lottery, we could do that.''
   But lottery officials said today that Hill did not have the
winning ticket.
   ``We have denied Mr. Hill's claim based on the fact he does not
have the original of his ticket,'' a statement by Tom Bell, general
counsel for the Lottery Department, read. ``The Lottery's
verification procedures on the copy provided by Mr. Hill indicate
that he does not have the winning ticket.''
   Several dozen people other than Hill have called the department
claiming to have the winning ticket, according to Mrs. Paul. She
said one identified himself as a resident of Minnesota, and another
caller came from central Florida.
   The jackpot's final value was put at $55.16 million, which
breaks down into 20 annual payments of $2.76 million before taxes.
Earlier estimates put the jackpot at $54 million, a record for a
state lottery.
   Gov. Bob Martinez, who has opposed the lottery, announced
Tuesday that it had broken $1 billion in sales since it began in
January. The biggest winners, he said, are Florida's schools.
   ``This record-breaking pace is exciting, both for the players
and public education in Florida,'' Martinez said.
   Since 35 percent of lottery sales go to education, $350 million,
or double earlier projections, will go to support education,
Martinez said.

<TEXT>
   Senate Republican Leader Bob Dole welcomed Dan
Quayle back to the Senate on Wednesday, giving him a fire
extinguisher to fight off the press but stopping short of calling
Quayle an asset to the GOP ticket.
   ``I know you've been on a roller coaster ride,'' Dole said as he
welcomed the Indiana senator back after a summer recess in which
Quayle became the party's vice presidential nominee.
   ``Thank goodness our roller coaster is going up and (Michael)
Dukakis' is disappearing out of sight,'' Dole said. Dole said
Dukakis should get ``the Rip Van Winkle Award for 1988 ... He's
been asleep. ... He just disappeared.''
   Since his nomination, Quayle has been dogged by controversies
over his military service, personal life and academic record, and
some in his own party have expressed skepticism about whether the
41-year-old senator should be on the ticket.
   Dole, a onetime presidential hopeful who was on George Bush's
short list of vice presidential prospects, has himself expressed
reservations about Quayle. Dole said recently that people of his
generation might have problems with allegations that Quayle used
his wealthy family's influence to get into the National Guard
during the Vietnam War.
   He repeated that view Wednesday, saying, ``If he did get certain
breaks ... that would create a problem in the minds of many,
particularly I would say in my generation.''
   Dole was asked by reporters after his reception for Quayle
whether he now thinks Quayle is an asset to the Republican ticket.
   ``I think he's becoming an asset,'' Dole said. Did that mean the
senator thought Quayle had achieved that status yet, he was
pressed. ``Becoming,'' Dole replied.
   At the reception, Dole presented Quayle with a small fire
extinguisher, which he said Quayle could ``spray on the press from
time to time.''
   He also gave Quayle a framed copy of the Pledge of Allegiance.
The Republicans have critized Dukakis, the Democratic presidential
nominee, for vetoing a Massachusetts bill that would have required
teachers to lead students in the pledge. Quayle devoted his Labor
Day fall campaign kickoff speech to the pledge.
   Dole called Quayle a ``rising young star in our party.'' Later,
he told reporters that despite Quayle's rocky start as the vice
presidential nominee, the young senator was ``catching on pretty
fast.''
   ``You just get out there and do it,'' Dole said. ``It's a whole
new world when you start a national campaign. There's constant
media attention and I think he's adapted very well in the last few
weeks.''
   But Dole gave a somewhat equivocal answer when asked about
Quayle's qualifications for national office.
   ``I think Dan Quayle is a very quick study. It's probably not
fair to compare him with somebody who's been in the Senate for
12-18 years or more.'' Dole said.
   Quayle's Democratic counterpart, Sen. Lloyd Bentsen of Texas, is
completing his 18th year in the Senate.
   ``My view is that he (Quayle) is qualified. It's like saying
compared to who? You can always find someone better than anybody I
know of in any business or profession. There are others who have
more experience. But I think Bush saw certain attributes he thought
would be helpful to get him elected and he chose Dan Quayle. It's
George Bush's choice,'' Dole said.
   Quayle told his fellow Republican senators, ``No matter what
happens in this election, the people who know me best and the
people I am closest to are the people right here in this room.''
   ``I can't wait to get back out there'' on the campaign trail, he
said. Quayle leaves Thursday for a quick trip to Illinois and Ohio.
He said he would return to Washington for key Senate votes as he
was needed.

   A British air force fighter jet
crashed Wednesday, killing the pilot and injuring the American
co-pilot, police said.
   Police in the town of Calw, about 20 miles southeast of
Stuttgart, said the plane crashed at about 11 a.m. in an open field.
   They said the Royal Air Force plane hit a high-voltage line just
before it crashed, but it could not be determined if that was the
cause of the accident.
   Police said the British pilot of the Jaguar jet was killed in
the crash. An American who co-piloted the jet was slightly injured
after he ejected.
   British Army spokesman Col. Michel Baugniet said the aircraft
was from the the Coltshall base in England and was in West Germany
on a routine training mission.
   Officials declined to release the names of the crew pending
notification of relatives.
   The crash came 11 days after three Italian Air Force jets
collided during an air show at a U.S. Air Force base in Ramstein.
One of the stunt jets plowed into a crowd of spectators and
exploded, killing more than 50 people.
   A series of NATO warplane crashes in West Germany in recent
weeks has prompted demands that low-level military training flights
be reduced or stopped.
   At least 80 people have died as a result of military air crashes
in West Germany since March 30.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   With trumpets blaring and a procession of alumni
from classes dating to 1893, Barnard College on Wednesday kicked
off a yearlong centennial celebration.
   Thirty-one years after women earned the right to vote, women in
New York City earned the right to get a college education without
leaving home when Barnard opened its doors on Oct. 7, 1889.
   It was the first women's college in the city and is one of the
elite ``seven sister'' colleges. Barnard is an independent college,
though affiliated with Columbia University.
   Speaking at a special convocation at Riverside Church, Barnard
President Ellen V. Futter said the college will continue to press
government leaders to address the needs of women and men.
   She called for ``a restatement of the goals of the women's
movement,'' and for resolution of national issues including
maternity and paternity leave, care of children and the aging,
flexible work schedules and preschool education.
   Ms. Futter said it was also ``long past time to do more than
just acknowledge the feminization of poverty'' and time to ``offer
a stronger hand up to women of color.''
   Francine du Plessix Gray, a 1952 Barnard graduate and author of
``Lovers and Tyrants'' and ``World Without End,'' delivered the
keynote speech.
   In it, she also spoke about the past and how women of the '60s
gave up motherhood for ``sisterhood'' and how the emphasis is once
again on motherhood and the family.
   ``Only in the last two or three years have we begun to strive
for a synthesis of sisterhood and motherhood _ a synthesis which,
if we complete it, may offer us greater serenity and power than
we've ever had,'' she said.
   Following the convocation, alumni paraded to the main campus for
the dedication of the new, $20 million Centennial Hall dormitory
which will house 400 students.
   The oldest participate was 99-year-old Hannah Bessmer.
   Thousands of balloons in Barnard blue were released as faculty,
students and their families feasted on a four-foot-high birthday
cake.
   Barnard has 2,200 students. Tuition and fees total about $13,000
a year.

   A former Walt Disney World costume designer
died 10 years after she was beaten so badly she was unable to walk,
talk or feed herself, and police are seeking to reopen the case.
   Blanche Wendelin, 69, died over the weekend in her daughters'
home in Fort Lauderdale, where she had lived since an eight-month
hospitalization that followed the September 1978 attack. After an
autopsy Monday, the Broward County medical examiner's office ruled
the death a homicide.
   An acquaintance was investigated in connection with the beating,
but was never charged. The statute of limitations ran out a year
after the beating when police were unable to gather enough evidence
to file charges, and all information about the case was removed
from the suspect's file.
   But under a new state law, homicide charges can be filed
whatever the length of time between the injuries and the death.
   Orlando detectives are bound by court order not to talk about
details of the case, said spokesman Sgt. Mike Holloway. But he said
are seeking an opinion from the Orange County state attorney's
office on whether the case can be reopened and charges pursued
against the suspect.
   ``If they can make something of it, I say go after his blood,''
said Marilyn Nevandomski, one of the victim's daughters. ``Nobody
should be able to do that to another human being and get away with
it, no matter how much time has passed.''
   Ms. Wendelin helped design and make costumes for the puppets in
the ``It's a Small World'' attraction at Disney World. Four years
ago, she went back in her wheelchair for a VIP tour, her daughter
said.
   But her life had become difficult in recent years as she was
forced to depend on others.
   ``We really lost her 10 years ago,'' said Ms. Nevandomski. ``The
way she was before and the way she was after, there's no
comparing.''

<TEXT>
   A group of blacks whose death
sentences have drawn worldwide protest spent their 1,000th day on
Death Row on Thursday, waiting for the country's highest court to
decide whether they can appeal.
   The five-judge Appeal Court in Bloemfontein, which turned down
an earlier appeal from the Sharpeville Six, heard arguments
Wednesday from defense attorneys asking that the case be reopened
to hear evidence from a state witness who said police pressured him
to lie.
   The government has indefinitely postponed the hangings of the
five men and one woman until the judicial proceedings are complete.
The court did not say when it would render its decision.
   President P.W. Botha has resisted appeals from the United
States, Britain, the United Nations, most European nations,
Australia, Japan and Canada to grant clemency in the case.
   Diplomats from 13 countries attended the hearing.
   The defendants were sentenced to die for their roles in the 1984
mob killing of black town councilor Kuzwayo Dlamini.
   No evidence was presented that the six contributed physically to
his death. But they were convicted in 1985 under the principle of
``common purpose'' because they allegedly were active members of
the crowd that stoned and burned Dlamini during riots over a rent
increase.
   Botha has said he will not intervene in the judicial process,
and he already has turned down a request for clemency before the
new evidence of possible perjury was brought forward.
   The state attorneys told the Appeal Court it had no jurisdiction
to review the case once the president had made a decision, even if
new evidence was raised.
   In June, the lower court judge who imposed the death sentences
rejected a motion to reopen the trial to consider the new evidence.
He said the defendants could appeal to the higher court but he felt
their only hope lay with Botha.
   Sydney Kentridge, a defense lawyer, said the controversy
surrounding the witness, Joseph Manete, could be resolved only if
the case were reopened to allow new oral evidence. But he also
agreed with a suggestion by one of the judges, J.L. Van der Merwe,
that Wednesday's hearing could constitute the actual appeal. He
said he could imagine no further argument than had already been
presented.
   The defense submitted an affidavit in which Manete said he
falsely testified that two of the defendants were at the scene of
the killing. He also wrote a letter to Botha, describing in detail
how police allegedly assaulted and threatened him and other
witnesses.
   ``I cannot interfere with the judicial system in South Africa
unless it is completed, and only when it is completed will I, as a
human being, deal with this matter on merit,'' Botha said in a
British television interview Tuesday.
   Some of Botha's critics have accused him of hypocrisy on this
issue, noting that he ordered a halt to prosecution of South
African soldiers about to go on trial for murder in South-West
Africa, also known as Namibia.
   The Sharpeville Six are Francis Mokgesi, 31; Reid Mokoena 24;
Oupa Moses Diniso, 32; Duma Joshua Khumalo, 28; Reginald Sefatsa,
32, and Theresa Ramashamola, 27.
   Ms. Ramashamola would be the first South African woman executed
in connection with a case widely viewed by activists as political.
Violence against black officials who cooperate with the
white-dominated government's segregated political structures is
considered by many blacks to be a consequence of apartheid.
   By law and custom, apartheid establishes a racially segregated
society in which the 26 million blacks have no vote in national
affairs. The 5 million whites control the economy and maintain
separate districts, schools and health services.

   The first official delegation of Soviets to
cross the Bering Strait since it was closed 40 years ago arrived
Wednesday in this historic gold-mining town, seeking to improve
contacts between the superpowers' most remote regions.
   Crowds braved rain and a 42-degree temperature to cheer the
Soviets' arrival aboard the Dmitri Laptev, a hydrological research
vessel. Several Eskimos in the group hugged and talked in their
native language, greeting relatives and friends they had not seen
for decades.
   ``It's just like home,'' said Oleg Kulinkin, mayor of the Soviet
town of Provideniya, across the strait. ``In the first minutes,
there was the land, grass, the weather and, most important,
friends.''
   The visit by the 11-member Soviet delegation and a crowd of
Soviet and foreign journalists came in response to a June
``friendship flight'' that took 82 Alaska Eskimos, politicians and
journalists to Provideniya.
   Gov. Steve Cowper had invited the Soviets in July to make the
return visit. The group will be in the state through Friday.
   Members of the group said they hope to improve tourist,
economic, scientific and cultural ties between the two sides of the
Bering Strait. They said theirs was mainly a good-will visit, not
one that would seek official agreements.
   ``We hope that, in any case, there will be direct contacts
within the next year in order to complete tourist trips, postal
exchanges. We're counting on it,'' Vyacheslav Kobets, chairman of
the government council of the Magadan region, said in an interview
aboard the Soviet vessel.
   A reception was scheduled at the city's convention center and
the guests later were to be treated to a reindeer teriyaki luncheon.
   A banner stretched across Nome's Front Street featured the U.S.
and Soviet flags. ``I never thought I'd see the day when the hammer
and sickle would be flying in Nome,'' said Tom Busch of radio
station KNOM.
   The group was scheduled leave later Wednesday for Anchorage,
where plans call for them to visit a shopping mall and have dinner
at an Anchorage hotel. They were to return to Nome on Thursday and
then return to the Soviet Union on Friday.

   Two gunmen shot and killed a
32-year-old man outside his store Wednesday, police said. News

   Witnesses reported the gunmen fled in a brown car that police
officials of the Royal Ulster Constabulary said was later found in

   Press Association, the domestic British news agency, and the
British Broadcasting Corp. said the victim was a leading member of
the Ulster Defense Association, an umbrella group of Protestant
vigilantes.
   A police spokesman, speaking anonymously in keeping with British
custom, said the man's name would not be released until his
relatives had been notified. He said he did not know whether the
victim was a member of the Ulster Defense Association.
   No one one claimed responsibility for the killing, the spokesman
said.
   The mostly Catholic Irish Republican Army is fighting to drive
the British from the predominantly Protestant province and unite it
with the 95 percent Catholic Irish Republic.

<HEAD>Air Force OKs Final Phase of `Doomsday' Radio Project</HEAD>

   The Air Force has quietly approved the final
construction phase for a nuclear ``doomsday'' radio network,
concluding that the project can be expanded without harming the
environment.
   The decision to expand the so-called GWEN network of radio relay
towers across the nation was made last month by Air Force Deputy
Assistant Secretary James F. Boatright, said Kevin Gilmartin, a
spokesman for the Air Force Electronic Systems Division at Hanscom
Air Force Base, Mass.
   It followed a review of public comments received since Sept. 25,
1987, when the Air Force published a final environmental impact
statement on the work, Gilmartin said Wednesday.
   Approval of the final construction phase means the GWEN network
ultimately will grow from 56 radio towers linking 38 terminals at
military bases to 96 towers linking 49 terminals, the spokesman
said.
   That represents a reduction from the 126 towers proposed last
fall but will still provide a ``final operational capability,'' he
added.
   GWEN _ an acronym for Ground Wave Emergency Network _ is a
system of low-powered radio antennas and transmitters designed to
ensure adequate communication links for U.S. military forces
following a nuclear attack. The Air Force says the network is
needed to ensure that a president can give a launch order to
Strategic Air Command bombers.
   The service has said it would like to complete the expanded
system by January 1992.
   A typical GWEN station consists of a thin, 300-foot tower and
three small shelters surrounded by a fence. The shelters house
electronic equipment and an emergency generator and fuel. The
stations normally require a 700-square-foot parcel of land.
   Each GWEN antenna is connected to a small grid of copper wire
buried underground at its base and operates with less than 2,000
watts of power.
   The Air Force currently is completing construction of what it
calls the ``thin line'' system of 56 GWEN towers. Fifty of those 56
towers are already operating, receiving and relaying brief test
messages every 20 minutes.
   Some of the towers in the initial system generated public
controversy, with citizen groups in such states as Massachusetts,
Oregon, Pennsylvania and California banding together to fight GWEN
on grounds the towers increased the likelihood of their towns
becoming nuclear targets.
   The Air Force repeatedly dismissed those arguments, asserting
the isolated towers were not worth that type of targeting attention
by the Soviet Union.
   GWEN's construction surfaced anew as a political issue a few
weeks ago when former Defense Secretary James Schlesinger
criticized Democratic presidential nominee Michael Dukakis for
opposing the project.
   Dukakis, the governor of Massachusetts, wrote letters in 1986
and 1987 opposing the placement of GWEN towers in his state both on
environmental and policy grounds.
   Now that Boatwright has certified expansion of the system as
posing ``no significant impact'' to the environment, the Air Force
must perform environment studies for each individual tower site and
award a contract for additional equipment, Gilmartin said.
   The Air Force estimates the entire system will cost roughly $600
million when completed, he said.

   Solidarity's national spokesman won fresh
support from President Reagan on Wednesday and urged Polish
authorities to make good on their pledge to negotiate with the
banned independent trade union.
   ``Time is running out,'' said Janusz Onyszkiewicz, who has been
the spokesman for Solidarity since 1981.
   ``People are expecting that some kind of compromise, finally,
will be thrashed out and if nothing will indicate this is something
that will happen soon, then people's patience will wear thin,''
Onyszkiewicz said, predicting more labor unrest if the government
doesn't bargain with Solidarity.
   The government, seeking to end a 19-day strike wave that swept
Poland from the Baltic coast in the north to the Silesian coal
fields in the south, last Wednesday held talks with Solidarity
leader Lech Walesa for the first time since releasing him from
martial law internment in November 1982.
   The strikes are over, but in Warsaw government spokesman Jerzy
Urban said that talks would not resume until later this month.
Urban also said they would be called off if any more ``political''
strikes occur and urged workers to join government-sponsored trade
unions rather than try to revive Solidarity.
   Poland's communist authorities proclaimed a state of war against
Solidarity on Dec. 13, 1981, and outlawed the union the following
year. Before last week, the government refused to negotiate with
Walesa and still refuses to allow Solidarity to operate as a legal
union.
   Walesa called Urban's remarks irresponsible.
   Onyszkiewicz warned that ``if the people see that the talks are
just a smokescreen, there will be more unrest in Poland.''
   ``When we ended the last strikes (in August 1980) we had
cast-iron guarantees in writing'' that the government would allow
the creation of independent trade unions. ``This time we don't,''
said Onyszkiewicz.
   ``The only thing that we can say for sure is that there was an
agreement to hold talks on all issues, including unions,'' said
Onyszkiewicz, who is making his first visit to the West in five
years.
   ``But it would be extremely foolish of the Polish government not
to come up with something.'' If not, ``there will be new strikes in
a few months,'' he said.
   If the government negotiates in earnest with Solidarity now, it
can do so without the pressure of nation-wide strikes and protests,
and can reach a reasonable compromise, said Onyszkiewicz, who by
profession is a lecturer in mathematics at Warsaw University.
   ``In two or three months, they will be forced into
concessesions, and they will be viewed as a group that can be
talked to only with a pistol to their heads,'' he said.
   After meeting with Reagan in the Oval Office, Onyszkiewicz told
reporters the U.S. president was committed to maintaining pressure
on the Polish government.
   ``I didn't ask for anything specific, but it is obvious that if
you want to see Poland in a stable condition ... then you must
obviously keep the pressure on the authorities. And President
Reagan said that this pressure will be kept,'' he said.
   Reagan imposed economic sanctions on Poland after the martial
law declaration, and did not lift them until military rule ended
and most political prisoners were released. This year, Poland and
the United States exchanged ambassadors for the first time since
1982.
   The Solidarity spokesman said economic reforms, introduced by
Polish leader Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski to decentralize some
decision-making, will not win popular support unless there are
``deep changes, deep political changes'' in Poland.
   ``Austerity can't be imposed by sheer force. We need not only
economic changes, but political changes in the country, that's why
we need independent institutions. That's why so many Poles think we
need Solidarity,'' said Onyszkiewicz.
   ``Solidarity is a group that is committed against the use of
force. That gives it a moral power and it gives us hope that change
will come in the future and that it will be bloodless,'' he said.
   ``I am optimistic. In the long run, we can't lose. The most
difficult period is still ahead. It is going to be hard,'' he said.
   ``For geopolitical reasons, we must accept the leading role of
the communist party in setting out foreign and defense policy. But
we would like to be allowed to discuss and to help decide domestic
policy issues, such as housing,'' he said.

   The belief that America's economic standing in
the world will be rescued by emerging high-technology industries
was questioned Wednesday by a prestigious study group which said
the country is fast losing its dominance in many of these fields.
   The Council on Competitiveness, contending that the country has
been far too complacent in the face of growing foreign competition,
recommended a major effort on the part of government, industry and
schools to reverse the trend.
   ``We cannot afford any further erosion in our once-commanding
technological lead,'' said the report of the council, comprised of
151 top officers of industry, labor and higher education. ``Because
technology is a driving force behind productivity improvements,
export strength and a high standard of living, the stakes are
enormous,'' it said.
   In releasing the report, John Young, chairman of the council and
president of Hewlett-Packard Co., said he wanted to challenge the
comforting illusion that high technology industries would provide
the ``economic panacea we all need'' to offset job losses in
traditional smokestack industries.
   ``In 1987, our trade deficit with Japan in electronics was
almost as large as it was for automobiles. So Silicon Valley is not
so far removed from Detroit,'' he said.
   The report said that U.S. companies' market share had shrunk so
dramatically over the past two decades that the country suffered a
trade deficit in high-technology goods for the first time ever in
1986.
   Citing government statistics, the report said that between 1970
and 1987, American manufacturing companies saw their proportion of
the U.S. market for record players fall from 90 percent to 1
percent, in color televisions from 90 percent to 10 percent, in
machine tools from 100 percent to 35 percent and in telephones from
99 percent to 25 percent.
   ``In field after field ... foreign competitors have moved into
markets pioneered and once dominated by American firms,'' the
council said. ``Often their success was built on exploiting
inventions made in American laboratories by American scientists.''
   The report said countries such as Japan have done a much better
job of bringing new technology to the marketplace quickly.
   ``We've been too slow, too fragmented, too uncoordinated and too
adversarial,'' said Bobby Inman, a member of the council and the
chairman of Westmark Systems Inc.
   Roland W. Schmitt, president of Rensselaer Polytechnic
Institute, said that ``at the same time we are slipping downward in
our ability to compete with foreign nations in high technology
product sales, we are slipping into dependence on foreign nationals
to sustain education and research efforts.''
   He said that in U.S. engineering schools currently, 40 percent
of the students and one-third of the faculty are foreign born.
   Even this infusion of talent will not be enough to prevent an
estimated shortage of 500,000 scientists and engineers in the
country by the year 2010, the report said.
   Schmitt said the decreasing interest of American students in
math and science was caused in part by a generally lackluster
quality of teaching at the high school level.
   To correct these problems will require increased federal
spending, even in this era of tight budgets, the report said.
   Among the council's recommendations:
   _The president's national science adviser should be elevated to
Cabinet rank with the power to develop a presidential strategy for
the development of science and technology.
   _The federal government, which spends as much on research and
development as all of American industry combined, should
concentrate more on commercialization. The report said the current
priorities of defense, space, energy and health were focused too
narrowly.
   _Federal spending to support university research should be
increased, with $10 billion needed over the next 10 years to
upgrade university research facilities, which have seen their
federal funding decline by 95 percent in real dollars since 1970.
   _The 700 federal research labs, which have an annual budget of
$20 billion, are at present so poorly supervised that it is
difficult to determine just what projects they are pursuing. Some
labs should be closed and the remaining ones better supervised.
   The council also said tax credits to companies for research
spending should be made permanent and Congress should streamline
its own decision-making on R&D spending, which at present is
splintered among nine different budget subcommittees.
   ``The primary challenge for policy-makers is to create a new
policy framework appropriate for today's competitive environment.
We can no longer afford to view the commercial application of
technology as a second-rate priority,'' Young said.

<HEAD>Government Depicts Soviet Republic as Wracked With Corrupt
Officials</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The government Wednesday depicted a Soviet
republic at the heart of the trial of Leonid Brezhnev's son-in-law
as plagued by officials who lined their pockets through
influence-peddling.
   Prosecutors on the third day of the trial said the law
enforcement apparatus in the Central Asian republic of Uzbekistan
sold promotions and accepted gifts from officers who paid bribes to
remain on the force.
   One of the defendants, Pyotr Begelman, was accused of taking
$1,600 from officers to help them get off a waiting list for buying
a new car. Soviets sometimes wait years for a car.
   Begelman was quoted in a document read in the Soviet Supreme
Council as saying it was ``well known that to work in the
Uzbekistan police or Interior Ministry, you had to give bribes.''
   ``And where could you get the money if not from subordinates,''
Begelman asked rhetorically.
   The charge sheet read in court Wednesday said Begelman bribed an
official of the Communist Party's policy-making Central Committee
in Uzbekistan to become a deputy interior minister in 1982.
   Begelman laughed sarcastically as a court reporter read some of
the things he is accused of doing.
   Another co-defendant, identified only as Kh. Norbutaev, was
accused in the charge sheet of taking 12,000 rubles ($19,047) from
one witness alone, either in cash or in gifts such as alcohol,
sheep, shoes, fur hats and a Finnish suit.
   Another of the nine defendants stood up in the dock at the start
of the session to complain that investigators were using ``moral
and psychological pressure'' to make him confess in Moscow's
Lefortevo prison, where the accused are being held during a trial
that is expected to last up to eight weeks.
   That defendant, former Uzbek Interior Minister Khaidar Yakhyaev,
slept during some of the afternoon session.
   An attorney for Yakhyaev, 61, said the defendant maintains he is
innocent of all charges. The defendants have not yet been given an
opportunity to enter their pleas pending completion of the reading
of the charges against them. The indictment runs about 1,500 pages.
   On Tuesday, the government finished laying out its case against
Brezhnev's top police official, who was said to have killed himself
following discovery of his extravagant lifestyle financed by
bribery.
   The government charged that Nikolai A. Shchelokov, who served as
interior minister under Brezhnev, took cash bribes as well as
extravagant gifts, including wine and pearls.
   The principal defendant in the case is Yuri M. Churbanov, a
Shchelokov deputy who is married to Brezhnev's daughter, Galina.
Churbanov's wife has not appeared in court. His lawyer told
reporters she is ill but will testify in defense of her husband
later in the trial.
   The trial is seen as a further attempt to discredit Brezhnev,
whose regime is routinely referred to by Soviet leader Mikhail S.
Gorbachev and his top officials as a period of stagnation.
   Western reporters are being allowed to witness the opening days
of the trial and have been told they will also be permitted to
attend for the verdict.

   The Defense Department informed Congress on
Wednesday it had approved the sales of Harpoon anti-ship missiles
to Canada and Venezuela and MK-46 torpedoes to Spain.
   Assuming there are no congressional objections, the Pentagon
said Venezuela would be offered 18 Harpoon missiles at an estimated
cost of $50 million, while Canada would receive 29 Harpoons of a
slightly different model for an estimated $47 million.
   Both countries intend to use the missiles to equip patrol boats
or frigates, the Pentagon said.
   Spain, meantime, is being offered 231 MK-46 torpedoes for an
estimated $64 million. They will be installed on frigates and
anti-submarine helicopters.
   The U.S. Navy will be responsible for overseeing each of the
transactions.
   The prime contractor for the Harpoons will be the McDonnell
Douglas Astronautics Co. in St. Louis, Mo., while the prime
contractor for the torpedoes will be the Defense Systems Division
of Honeywell Inc. in Hopkins, Minn.

<HEAD>Agency Says Pentagon Still Overpaying For Some Weapons</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TIM AHERN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Pentagon is continuing to pay tens of
millions of dollars more than it should for weapons because defense
contractors are hiding information that would bring prices down,
the General Accounting Office said Wednesday.
   Despite some Pentagon successes in halting overpriced weapons,
contractors still aren't complying with a 1962 law designed to
provide more information to government contract negotiators, the
congressional watchdog agency told a House subcommittee.
   The law, the Truth in Negotiations Act, requires disclosure to
the government by contractors of all relevant information about
contracts. Companies found to be in violation can be sued for
recovery of the overpricing.
   ``Our work shows that when contractors fail to disclose relevant
cost or pricing data, the government pays higher contract prices
than warranted,'' said Paul Math, associate director of the GAO's
national security division.
   Math told the House Government Operations national security
subcommittee that GAO auditors have looked at 18 major contractors
in the past four years and recommended that $32 million be
recovered on 38 contractrs.
   The Pentagon agreed and has recovered $6 million and is still
trying to get the rest of the money back, Math said.
   A new round of GAO checks on five contractors found potential
overpricing of almost $18 million, Math said. About $13 million was
due to non-compliance with the 1962 law, and the other $5 million
was attributed to faulty contractor estimate systems.
   The reviews involve non-competitive contracts, which are awarded
without bidding. The Pentagon has generally pushed for more
competition in its contracts in recent years, but still awarded $79
billion worth of non-competitive contracts in fiscal 1987, Math
said.
   The Pentagon, embarrassed by overpriced weapons, has instituted
a series of reforms that have partially solved the problem, Math
said.
   But ``further improvements are needed,'' he added, detailing new
rules which would provide more data to government contracting
officials. That information would enable them to better argue for
lower-priced contracts.
   Derek J. Vander Schaaf, the Pentagon's deputy inspector general,
generally agreed with Math's comments and also said the Pentagon
needs more auditors to check contracts.
   ``We need to increase the audit resources the Department of
Defense is dedicating to defective pricing reviews,'' Vander Schaaf
said.

<HEAD>Murder Charges Filed Against Three Polygamist Clan Members</HEAD>
<DATELINE>COALVILLE, Utah (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Three polygamist clan members were
charged Wednesday with second-degree murder in the death of a state
corrections officer killed during a shootout that ended the clan's
13-day standoff in a rual compound.
   The charges, filed in 3rd Circuit Court in Summit County, name
clan leader Addam Swapp, his brother Jonathan Swapp, and John
Timothy Singer.
   State attorneys had waited to file charges in the death of
Department of Corrections Lt. Fred House until after the three men
and clan matriarch Vickie Singer had been sentenced last week by a
judge following a federal trial on firearms, attempted murder and
bombing charges.
   Assistant Attorney General Creighton Horton said that barring
new evidence, Mrs. Singer would not be charged in House's death.
   Evidence presented during the federal trial showed the bullet
that killed House was fired by John Timothy Singer, 22, son of Mrs.
Singer, during the shootout at the Singer homestead in Marion on
Jan. 28. The gun battle seriously wounded Addam Swapp, who
triggered the siege when he bombed a nearby Mormon chapel.
   On Friday, U.S. District Judge Bruce Jenkins sentenced Addam
Swapp to 15 years in federal prison. Jonathan Swapp, 21, and John
Timothy Singer were sentenced to 10 years in prison and Mrs.
Singer, 45, was given a five-year term.
   The penalty for second-degree murder is five years to life in
prison.
   Third Circuit Judge Maurice D. Jones ordered that the three be
held without bail, but it was not immediately known if they would
be moved to the Summit County Jail in Coalville or would remain in
the Salt Lake County Jail.
   The complaint was signed by Ronald E. Miller, criminal
investigator for the state attorney general's office. It said the
three men had either killed House, 35, ``or acting under
circumstances evidencing a depraved indifference to human life ...
engaged in conduct which created a grave risk of death to another,
and thereby caused the death of Fred House.''
   The document listed 34 people who witnessed the slaying or
otherwise provided evidence. No arraignment was scheduled.
   The murder complaint said that after the three are tried, they
will be ``returned to the custody of federal officials to begin
serving their prison sentences'' for the federal convictions.
   Swapp said the bombing of the Kamas Stake Center was ordered by
God as a sign of the impending collapse of the Mormon Church and
all government. He also said the act would trigger the return of
family patriarch John Singer, slain by police nine years before for
resisting arrest.
   The clan maintained Singer was killed in a church-state
conspiracy and that the family had been harassed for years by
police and neighbors.

<HEAD>Banks Having Banner Year Despite Texas Setbacks</HEAD>

   The nation's commercial banks enjoyed their
most profitable six months on record through June this year,
despite continuing losses in Texas, the government said Wednesday.
   ``You could hardly ask ... for better,'' said Federal Deposit
Insurance Corp. Chairman L. William Seidman.
   Commercial banks earned $10.5 billion in the first and second
quarters this year, topping the $9.7 billion in net income for the
second and third quarters of 1985, which had been the most
profitable six months since the FCIC began keeping track in 1934.
   In the first half of last year, banks lost $5.4 billion. The big
loss was almost entirely attributable to huge reserves set aside by
the largest banks for expected losses on loans to Third World
countries.
   Banks haven't seen the need to build those reserves further this
year and are thus earning strong profits. Banks set aside $916
million on foreign laons in the first six months of this year,
compared with $16.4 billion in the same period a year ago.
   ``We think ... we will see record profits for the year if the
economy continues on its current level,'' said Seidman, whose
agency insures commercial banks deposits up to $100,000. The most
profitable year for banking was 1985, when the industry posted
earnings of $18.1 billion.
   The April-June period of 1988 was the second most profitable
quarter on record, after the July-September quarter of last year,
when banks reported $5.8 billion in net income.
   However, the banking picture remained bleak in Texas, a state
troubled by soured real estate prices and a depression in the oil
industry. Banks there lost $2.9 billion in the first half, with
$2.3 billion of that attributable to a single institution: First
RepublicBank Corp. of Dallas, which has since been rescued with $4
billion in federal money.
   Elsewhere in the oil-dependent Southwest, banks earned modest
profits.
   Seidman said he hoped that the condition of banks in Texas would
improve now that so many have been closed or merged with healthier
institutions. At the end of August, 173 banks had failed or
required government assistance to stay open. Ninety-seven of those
_ including 42 First RepublicBank subsidiaries _ were in Texas.
   Seidman said failures would continue at the same rate this year,
setting a post-Depression record, but then decline next year.
   In the Midwest, battered earlier in the decade by farm bank
failures, the profitability of most banks has been restored. In the
first half, 7 percent of banks in Iowa, Kansas, Minnesota,
Missouri, Nebraska, North Dakota and South Dakota lost money,
compared with nearly double that amount a year ago.
   Farm losses caused by this year' drought may check the
improvement in banks in the region, but Seidman said Midwestern
banks should be able to weather any difficulties because they've
lent more carefully than in the past and because of government aid
to farmers.
   Other figures cited by the FDIC include:
   _The number of unprofitable banks has dropped from 2,243 in the
first six months of 1987 to 1,729 this year.
   _Banks on the FDIC's problem list dropped from a peak of 1,601
at mid-year 1987 to 1,455 on June 30 of this year.
   _The total of bad loans, those on which payments are not being
made, totaled $73.4 billion in the second quarter, 3 percent less
than a year ago.
   _Bank lending in real estate and to consumers grew at the
expense of traditional commercial loans to business. Much of the
expansion in real estate loans was to build commercial projects
such as offices and shopping centers. Much of the growth in
consumer lending was in home equity loans.
   Seidman also noted that growth in commercial bank deposits
barely matches inflation and is not keeping up with growth in the
economy. Meanwhile, deposits at savings and loan institutions have
grown twice as fast, he said. Many insolvent S&Ls, which have not
yet been closed by regulators, are paying high interest rates in
order to attract depositors.

   In a lawsuit titled ``United States of
America vs. 308 cardboard cases, more or less, of condoms,''
federal officials don't want to leave condom quality control to
someone else.
   Federal prosecutors are asking a federal judge to order the U.S.
Marshal's office to seize a batch of defective condoms from Mentor
Corp.'s warehouse in suburban Brooklyn Center. The lawsuit is
against the product, not Mentor Corp.
   The seizure would include about 44,350 condoms from a batch of
contraceptives made for Mentor by an East Coast factory, said
assistant U.S. Attorney Roylene Champeaux.
   Judge Paul Magnuson is expected to sign the seizure order later
this week, Champeaux said. The marshal's service will confiscate
the condoms and officially put them in Magnuson's custody.
   According to the government's complaint, Mentor will have until
Nov. 10 to contest the seizure. If Mentor does not file a claim for
the return of the condoms, the government will destroy them,
Champeaux said.
   ``That would be fine,'' said Mentor spokesman Al Mannino. ``That
would save us the cost of destroying them.''
   Mannino said he was baffled by the government's action because
his company had informed the federal government that it was going
to destroy the condoms.
   FDA inspectors declared the Mentor batch defective Aug. 1,
Mannino said. A batch is substandard if more than three condoms of
a batch of 1,000 leak, he said.
   On Aug. 18, Mentor's quality control officer signed an affidavit
saying the company would destroy them.
   In the past, manufacturers were allowed to destroy the condoms
and file affidavits with the FDA stating they had been destroyed,
he said.
   But the company recently was notified that the FDA is now taking
a much tougher approach to condom quality control.
   Comparing the suit to an admiralty law action, Champeaux said,
``This is the same thing as seizing a ship.''
   Mentor has headquarters in Minnesota and Santa Barbara, Calif.
The company, which makes a variety of implantable devices and
health care products, buys condoms from other manufacturers and
adds an adhesive to the inside as well as an outer hood.

   Washington's orchard belt was spared from a
blistering 30,000-acre forest fire Wednesday by farmers who turned
on their irrigation systems and by a shift in wind and temperature.
   The arrival of cool, humid weather and more favorable winds gave
firefighters the upper hand for the first time in three days.
   ``The plan is for direct attack today,'' said Doreen Medina,
U.S. Forest Service spokeswoman.
   The blaze, believed to be human-caused, grew from about 160
acres Monday. For a time, it had threatened the lush green fruit
orchards that run for miles along the opposite bank of the Entiat
River. The orchards are the backbone of the local economy, and
would take years to replace.
   The Chelan County Sheriff's Department had asked growers along a
five-mile stretch of the river to turn on their sprinklers to keep
the blaze from spreading on the orchard side of the river.
   About 700 firefighters used bulldozers to ring the fire while
dozens of aircraft and helicopters bombed it with water and flame
retardant. An addditional 100 people, including National Guardsmen,
are supporting the firefighters.
   The fire, 50 percent surrounded by fire lines Wednesday, was not
expected to be completely contained before Friday.
   ``We had done a lot of defensive work. Now most of that is
holding and they are taking the resources and putting them on the
(fire) line,'' Medina said. ``We're actually going out and building
line.''
   Smoke from the fire was so thick Tuesday that a 40-mile stretch
of U.S. 97 between Chelan and Wenatchee was closed. The shift in
winds helped officials reopen the highway Wednesday, and dozens who
had evacuated from their homes were allowed to return. One home on
the outskirts of this central Washington town of 400 was destroyed.
   More than 3 million acres of public and private forests in
eastern Washington were closed because of the fire danger, and bans
or restrictions have been levied statewide on hunters, fishermen
and campers.
   The major area of concern was the Entiat fire's west and
northwest side, a critical winter range for one of the state's
largest mule deer herds.
   ``This is the turning point on this fire,'' said Ron DeHart,
spokesman for an interagency task force battling the fire.
   ``Right now we've got it pinned in a corner,'' with the fire
stopped by the Entiat River on the southern flank, Highway 97 on
the eastern flank, DeHart said.
   Elsewhere in Washington, five fires were burning in the
northeast corner of the state. Those have burned 58,000 acres and
were requiring the efforts of 4,000 firefighters.
   Janet Edwards, a spokeswoman for the firefighting effort in the
Colville National Forest, said only one of the fires was still
growing. That one, near Republic, Wash., was at 17,600 acres
Wednesday.

<HEAD>Repeal of War Powers Act Urged By Retired Generals</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LAWRENCE L. KNUTSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Three top retired military officers testified
Wednesday that the War Powers Act should be repealed on grounds
that its restraints on a president's ability to expose U.S. forces
to the risk of combat are unworkable and possibly unconstitutional.
   ``I think the nation would be best served by repealing the
entire act,'' said retired Air Force Gen. David C. Jones, a former
chairman of the military joint chiefs of staff. ``It is a continual
sore in relations betweeen the executive and Congress.''
   Another joint chiefs chairman, retired Army Gen. John W. Vessey
Jr., said he agreed with Jones that ``repeal of the act would be a
good thing.''
   Retired Air Force General Brent Scowcroft, national security
adviser in the Ford administration, also called for repeal,
describing the act as ``well-meaning but deeply flawed.''
   The three retired officers testified before the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee, which is examining possible steps to
strengthen the the War Powers Act, enacted over President Nixon's
veto in 1973.
   The act requires the president to notify and consult with
Congress whenever he orders troops into combat conditions, and says
those forces may have to be withdrawn within 60 days unless
Congress approves their continued deployment.
   The hearings were chaired by Sen. Joseph R. Biden Jr., his first
official act since his recovery from brain surgery earlier this
year.
   Scowcroft said that while the consultations between the
president and Congress called for by the act are a worthwhile goal,
the act does not make clear what is meant by consultations.
   ``How does the president deal with objections to his plans?'' he
asked. ``How can a president deal with confidentiality? What if
Congress is out of session?''
   ``To a layman, it seems that the law most clearly is
unconstitutional,'' he said. ``If being commander in chief has any
meaning at all it must include the ability to move troops.''
   He and the others said Congress can use its power of the purse
as expressed in the appropriations process to force a president to
withdraw U.S. forces.
   ``This act is an invitation to struggle between the two
branches,'' he said. ``We need to increase cooperation between the
two branches, not an attempt by one branch to tie the other down.''
   Vessey said that the way things stand now, the War Powers Act
provides the nation's adversaries with ``an opening to drive a
wedge between president and Congress and the American body
politic.''
   Sen. Brock Adams, D-Wash., said the arguments for repealing the
act amount to a declaration that it is ``better to let the pot boil
until there is an explosion between the Congress and the president
or between the people and the president, rather than go ahead with
an orderly procedure under the War Powers Act.''

<TEXT>
   U.S. Defense Secretary Frank C. Carlucci said
Wednesday he is satisfied with China's assertions that its growing
arms trade will not contribute to instability in the Middle East
and other volatile regions.
   He told reporters two days of talks were the ``best discussions
we have ever had'' on the question, he was ``fully usatisfied''
with the Chinese explanation and ``I hope we can put this issue
behind us.''
   The United States ``will continue to work to expand the
technology that is being made available to China,'' Carlucci said,
adding without elaboration that new technology exchange programs
are being discussed in aviation and other fields.
   Boeing is negotiating the sale to China of about a dozen CH-47
transport helicopters for use by a rapid deployment force. The
United States has supplied China with helicopters, technology for
fighter jets, torpedoes and other ammunition.
   Carlucci met on Wednesday with 84-year-old Deng Xiaoping,
China's leader and head of the Central Military Commission.
   He conferred Tuesday with Defense Minister Qin Jiwei, Premier Li
Peng and Vice Premier Wu Xueqian.
   Among matters discussed were U.S.-Soviet arms reduction talks,
the Soviet military withdrawal from Afghanistan, the situations in
Cambodia and Korea, modernization of China's armed forces and
Chinese domestic policy.
   The Chinese ``clearly attach great importance'' to their own
satellite launching service, which could suffer serious losses if
Washington does not issue export licenses for U.S. communications
satellites, Carlucci told reporters.
   Defense Department officials said the issue was raised by all
the Chinese leaders Carlucci met on Tuesday, and urged the Reagan
administration to approve launching of U.S. satellites by China.
   ``I indicated that from my perspective I did not see this as a
national security issue,'' the defense secretary said. ``They have
given us all the assurances we need on the safeguarding of the
technology. It is not a technology transfer issue. It is a trade
issue.''
   The Commerce Department and some U.S. congressmen have argued
that launching American satellites with the Chinese Long March
rocket would undermine efforts by U.S. companies to establish
commercial launching services.
   Carlucci also was asked about a statement by Deng Xiaoping that
he hoped Vice President George Bush would win the presidential
election.
   Bush headed the U.S. liaison office in Beijing in 1974-75,
before full diplomatic relations were established, and has met Deng
and other Chinese leaders in frequent visits to China since then.
   ``I gave him (Deng) about a billion absentee ballots,'' Carlucci
said jokingly.
   Deng generally receives only visiting presidents and premiers.
His meeting with Carlucci underscored the importance with which
China views overall relations and military links with the United
States.
   Military ties have developed since diplomatic relations were
established in 1979. Exchanges of senior military officials are
common, the United States sells a small amount of military hardware
to China and U.S. warships made a port call in 1986 at the Yellow
Sea port of Qingdao.

   Flood waters swept a motorist away
Wednesday, closed schools, and forced the evacuation of at least
1,000 people after three days of heavy rain on Florida's central
Gulf Coast.
   Across the overflowing Manatee River from Bradenton, police in
Palmetto, were forced to ride in garbage trucks after street
flooding made patrol cars useless.
   The National Guard was put on alert as forecasters said there
would be no letup Thursday in Florida's heaviest rain since
Hurricane Elena three years ago.
   ``If they call us, we are ready to respond,'' Guard spokesman
Jerry Vaughn said Florida from headquarters in St. Augustine.
   A local state of emergency was declared in Manatee County along
the Manatee River, which was 7 feet above flood stage late
Wednesday afternoon, and was expected to crest at 11{ feet above
flood stage before Thursday.
   The Red Cross opened three shelters for residents of south
Tampa, where waters lapped at car windshields.
   State officials said they were providing four-wheel-drive
vehicles from the Game and Fish Commission to help in the
evacuations, which involved hundreds of homes and at least 1,000
people in Manatee County.
   ``One third of the Interbay peninsula is under water,'' said
Edward J. McElroy, acting manager of emergency operations in Tampa.
   Divers searched unsuccessfully for a man swept away after a car
carrying four people stalled in a drainage ditch in Tampa, then
began to float. The other three people were rescued.
   Witnesses saw James Edward Mercer, 45, surface in the murky
water, his arms flailing, but he was dragged under by the strong
current before rescuers could get to him, said Steve Cole, Tampa
Police Department spokesman.
   Manatee County schools were shut after several were flooded in
the Bradenton area, south of Tampa.
   ``The roads are heavily flooded and we're having sewage problems
with water backing up into the schools,'' said superintendent Gene
Witt. ``In the last 25 years I haven't seen anything of this
magnitude.''
   Almost all low-lying areas were flooded in Pinellas,
Hillsborough, Pasco, Sarasota, Manatee, Hardee, Hernando, Sumter,
Citrus and Polk counties. Most rivers and streams in those counties
either flooded or were forecast to reach flood stage.
   The rain was from a near-stationary cold front that has been
hovering across the Florida Peninsula at the mid-state level,
dumping from 8 to 15 inches of rain, the National Weather Service
said.
   Forecasters predicted Wednesday that 4 more inches could fall
before the front slowly retreats northward.
   In Tampa, a homeowner measured more than 12 inches of rain over
two days. Farther north, in Yankeetown near Cedar Key, the weather
service reported 13 inches had fallen.
   ``All the rivers around here are over their banks,'' said Coast
Guard Petty Officer Eric Hermann in the Yankeetown station.
``There's a lot of street flooding and stuff.''
   Yankeetown holds the national record for 24-hour rainfall of
38.7 inches on Sept. 5-6, 1950.
   Meanwhile, in northeast Florida, about 20 families were
evacuated from their homes after two days of heavy rain caused
Black Creek to spill over its banks into nearby homes in Clay
County. The Red Cross brought food and coffee to the Middleburg
Fire Department for those forced from their homes, but most found
refuge with relatives and friends, officials said.

   Presidential campaign ads began this week on
an upbeat note, with Democrat Michael Dukakis and Republican George
Bush promoting themselves as candidates of compassion in two
high-stakes states.
   ``Who cares about your life?'' a narrator asks at the end of a
Dukakis ad keyed to a plant-closing bill that became law over the
objections of the Reagan administration.
   The spot, running in Texas, concludes, ``The choice is clear.''
   Or is it?
   ``I want a kinder and gentler nation,'' Bush says at the outset
of a 30-second spot running in California, in an excerpt from his
convention acceptance speech. ``I'm a quiet man, but I hear the
quiet people others don't. ... I hear them and I am moved.''
   The convention footage is intercut with an array of domestic
scenes _ Bush cooking corn in a big pot, Bush biting into a
sandwich at a picnic, Bush lifting a grandchild into the air and
kissing her.
   The Dukakis plant-closing spot shows a padlocked plant gate as a
narrator asks, ``Shouldn't there be a law to give you and your
community 60 days' notice? George Bush says no and Dan Quayle led
the fight in the Senate against making it a law.''
   The ad says Massachusetts Gov. Dukakis passed one of the first
notification laws in the country and touts Texas Sen. Lloyd
Bentsen, Dukakis' running mate, as ``the man who won the fight to
make 60-day notification law.'' The two are shown in their
shirtsleeves, chatting genially with a group of workers at a plant.
   The Dukakis campaign bought network time starting Wednesday for
an ad called ``New Era,'' which first aired in a very limited
fashion during the Republican convention last month. The ad, the
first paid national exposure for Dukakis, features excerpts from
his acceptance speech and a list of his accomplishments.
   A second Bush ad, also running in California, uses another chunk
of Bush's acceptance speech intercut with shots of the White House
lit up at night, a flag waving in the background.
   ``What it all comes down to in this election is the man at the
desk and who should sit at that desk,'' Bush says in the speech
excerpt. ``My friends, I am that man.''
   The Dukakis campaign and the Democratic National Committee
unveiled one negative ad scheduled to start airing late this week.
The ad, produced for the DNC, takes the Reagan administration to
task for the tripling of the federal debt since 1980.
   The ad, called ``Hey Pal,'' features printed text describing the
climb of the debt from $900 billion in 1980 to $1.8 trillion in
1985 to $2.6 trillion in 1988. The text is intercut with a laughing
actor depicting a Republican.
   ``Hey pal,'' he says, ``how about a couple hundred billion? I'll
pay you right back. ... What's another trillion between friends?''
The ad concludes with these words on the screen: ``We can't afford
the Republicans.''
   ``Sorry, pal,'' the narrator says.
   Campaign spokesman Leslie Dach said the ad ``very clearly states
what the record is in this administration on the national debt.''
He said it would air in battleground states, but declined to reveal
which ones.
   A group called Americans for Bush, not associated with the Bush
campaign, has prepared two ads slamming Dukakis' record on crime
and plans to show them on several national cable networks. The ads
were to be unveiled at a news conference Thursday.

<TEXT>
   The national Centers for Disease Control plans more
rigorous sanitary inspections of cruise ships and new health
scorecards that will help the public judge a ship's history, a CDC
official said Wednesday.
   Dr. Vernon N. Houk, director of the CDC's Center for
Environmental Health and Injury Control, said the center plans to
hire additional inspectors and set up an improved inspection
routine of the cruise ships.
   Houk said the proposed new reporting procedures would replace
pass-fail designations with a numeral rating and include a median
score of all inspections from the previous five years.
   ``A single inspection score does not accurately predict the
possibility of an epidemic on a particular cruise,'' said Houk.
``However, an epidemic is significantly less likely to occur on a
vessel whose staff maintains a higher level of sanitation over a
period of time.''
   He added, ``Scores over a five-year period would provide the
traveling public with more information than is now available.''
   Meanwhile, outbreaks of germ-related illnesses has remained
stable on passenger vessels although more ships are docking at U.S.
ports.
   Cruise ship voyages from the U.S. have nearly doubled from the
mid-1970s to about 3,500 trips yearly, but Houk said the number of
gastric diseases since 1980 has remained steady at about two cases
per 10 million passenger-days. That figure represents the total
number of days at sea.
   Since the CDC resumed unannounced cruise ship inspections in
March 1987, five outbreaks affecting about 22,000 passengers have
been investigated.
   The CDC spot inspection program, halted in 1985, was refunded by
Congress after limited cooperation from cruise ship lines using
private inspectors.
   Only about 30 percent of 78 cruise ships inspected by the CDC
since March 1987 achieved scores above 85, the minimum passing
mark, on first inspection. However, all but five ships passed on
reinspection, according to CDC figures.
   The inspections include checking water, food preparation and
storage and general cleanliness, said the bi-weekly CDC cruise ship
report summary distributed to travel agents and cruise ship
operators.
   Houk said at a public meeting here Wednesday that the numeral
reporting system could be implemented early next year if approved
by federal officials. There is no fine or other penalty for cruise
ships failing CDC inspections, but the lines could suffer losses if
tour operators direct clients to other vessels or the public learns
of the low score.
   ``Reputation is invaluable in the cruise ship industry,'' said
John Layzell, a vice president at Miami-based Admiral Cruise, one
of 22 lines operating out of U.S. ports. ``If the traveling public
reads about an unsatisfactory score in their Sunday travel
sections, then they might just change their minds.''
   James Mitchell Jr., a travel agent from Hanover, N.H., who
attended the conference, said the CDC reports will not have full
impact until they are circulated among most of the 30,000 tour
brokers around the country.
   ``Right now, at best, 3 percent of the travel agents get the
reports,'' he said. ``Most agents don't even know these reports
exists.''

<HEAD>Simon Calls For Stricter Sanctions Against South Africa</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   South Africa is a country ``drifting toward
massive violence'' and only bold new internal leadership and strong
signals from other countries will avert large-scale bloodshed, Sen.
Paul Simon said Wednesday.
   Simon said his recent five-day trip to South Africa convinced
him that it is time for the United States to adopt its strictest
economic sanctions yet as a signal to Pretoria that apartheid, the
subjugation of the black majority, must be abandoned.
   ``Blacks are living in despair and hopelessness, and whites are
living in fear,'' Simon, D-Ill., told a news conference. ``And the
greater the fear, the more there is repression.''
   New sanctions legislation, similar to a bill passed Aug. 11 in
the House, was scheduled to come before the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee on Thursday. Simon chairs the panel's Africa
subcommittee.
   Simon and another Senate backer of the harsh sanctions measures,
Assistant Democratic Leader Alan Cranston of California, said they
believed the measure could be brought to the floor for a vote in
the waning days of this year's session.
   But both conceded that it would be difficult to pass the bill in
the absence of significant Republican support, and they
acknowledged that opponents could make it difficult to get ifrom Mentor
Corp.'s warehouse in suburban Brooklyn Center. The lawsuit is
against the product, not Mentor Corp.
   The seizure would include about 44,350 condoms from a batch of
contraceptives made for Mentor by an East Coast factory, said
assistant U.S. Attorney Roylene Champeaux.
   Judge Paul Magnuson is expected to sign the seizure order later
this week, Champeaux said. The marshal's service will confiscate
the condoms and officially put them in Magnuson's custody.
   According to the government's complaint, Mentor will have until
Nov. 10 to contest the seizure. If Mentor does not file a claim for
the return of the condoms, the government will destroy them,
Champeaux said.
   ``That would be fine,'' said Mentor spokesman Al Mannino. ``That
would save us the cost of destroying them.''
   Mannino said he was baffled by the government's action because
his company had informed the federal government that it was going
to destroy the condoms.
   FDA inspectors declared the Mentor batch defective Aug. 1,
Mannino said. A batch is substandard if more than three condoms of
a batch of 1,000 leak, he said.
   On Aug. 18, Mentor's quality control officer signed an affidavit
saying the company would destroy them.
   In the past, manufacturers were allowed to destroy the condoms
and file affidavits with the FDA stating they had been destroyed,
he said.
   But the company recently was notified that the FDA is now taking
a much tougher approach to condom quality control.
   Comparing the suit to an admiralty law action, Champeaux said,
``This is the same thing as seizing a ship.''
   Mentor has headquarters in Minnesota and Santa Barbara, Calif.
The company, which makes a variety of implantable devices and
health care products, buys condoms from other manufacturers and
adds an adhesive to the inside as well as an outer hood.

   Smaller crops of some fruit will mean fewer
cans on grocers' shelves in the coming year, the Agriculture
Department said Wednesday.
   The department's Economic Research Service said those crops
include apricots, clingstone peaches, bartlett pears and apples.
Moreover, it said in a new outlook report, smaller inventories
already on hand ``will keep most canned fruit supplies tight again
this season.''
   Demand from both domestic and export markets has been relatively
strong, the report said.
   ``Several canned fruit prices have advanced recently because of
strong movement, tight supplies and higher contract prices for raw
fruit,'' the report added. ``Prices are expected to remain strong
throughout 1988-89.''

   The chief of Poland's official trade union
said Wednesday that talks with Solidarity expected to begin this
month will address union pluralism, but appeared to rule out
legalizing the banned group.
   ``If there are different trends afoot, let us find a proper
solution: join (the official) union, take part in the elections,''
said Alfred Miodowicz, head of the All-Poland Alliance of Trade
Unions and a member of the Communist Party Politburo.
   Miodowicz, speaking at a news conference at the trade federation
headquarters in Warsaw, did not rule out a meeting with Solidarity
leader Lech Walesa before the talks begin.
   Howevever, he said:
   ``The legalization of Solidarity as another trade union would be
inconsistent with our concept, which says there is one trade union
in an enterprise.''
   Last week Walesa persuaded workers to end strikes. In exchange,
he received a pledge from Interior Minister Gen. Czeslaw Kiszczak
of negotiations whose topics would include legalizing Solidarity,
the first independent trade union movement in the Soviet bloc.
   The strikes began Aug. 16 at the July Manifesto coal mine in
southern Poland by workers who demanded higher pay and legalization
of Solidarity.
   Miodowicz told reporters that current worker dissatisfaction
resulted from poor implementation of economic reforms by the
government.
   In a speech to the Communist Party's Central Committee on Aug.
28, Miodowicz said government leaders should be held personally
acccountable for the economic problems that touched off the strikes.
   On Tuesday, the official union formally called for the
government of prime minister Zbigniew Messner to resign. It asked
for a no-confidence vote at the next meeting of Parliament,
expected sometime this month.

   President Reagan has invited the foreign
ministers of Egypt and Israel to a mini-summit meeting in New York
on Sept. 26 to try to give new impetus to lagging Mideast peace
efforts, U.S. and diplomatic sources said Wednesday.
   Initially, Secretary of State George P. Shultz planned to meet
with Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon Peres and Egyptian Foreign
Minister Ahmed Esmat Abdel Meguid while all were attending the
special session of the U.N. General Assembly.
   Reagan decided to step in to demonstrate that U.S. interest in
promoting a settlement of the Arab-Israeli conflict had not flagged
despite a lack of progress in recent months and elections to be
held in the United States and Israel in November. Shultz also will
participate.
   ``They want to show the initiative is still alive,'' said a
diplomatic source who, like the others, demanded anonymity. A U.S.
official said Reagan wanted to ``put his weight'' behind the U.S.
proposal for a Mideast peace conference and see whether the 1979
peace treaty Egypt signed with Israel can be expanded further into
the Arab world.
   The president's invitation was conveyed Tuesday to a senior
Israeli embassy official who readily accepted in behalf of his
government. Shultz called in Egyptian Ambassador Abdel Rauf
El-Reedy on Wednesday to outline the U.S. initiative.
   While Reagan is in New York he also will address the U.N.
session.
   State Department spokesman Charles E. Redman declined to say
whether Reagan would meet with the foreign ministers. ``A lot of
meetings are possible in New York, but I'm not at a point where I
can confirm those at this point,'' he told reporters.
   Peres, head of the Labor Party, has supported Shultz's efforts
this year to convene a Mideast peace conference. But Prime Minister
Yitzhak Shamir, head of the Likud coalition, has resisted, partly
because the administration proposes that Israel yield most of the
West Bank and Gaza in exchange for Arab recognition.
   Shamir's Likud associates suggested in Jerusalem that the Reagan
administration was meddling in Israeli affairs by setting up a
meeting just five weeks before Israel's election. The Nov. 1
balloting is viewed as a referendum on Israel's Mideast policy.
   ``At this hour, I still don't have all the details on the
meeting,'' the prime minister said. ``I will just say one thing. We
must not forget that we are on the eve of elections.''
   Uri Oren, political adviser to Deputy Prime Minister David Levy
of Likud called the meeting ``a bad joke'' and ``astonishing
evidence of improper policy, both external and internal.''
   ``Everybody understands that such a meeting cannot advance any
political process several weeks'' before the elections, he told an
Associated Press reporter in Jerusalem.
   Jordan's King Hussein has insisted on a guaranteed Israeli
withdrawal as a condition for attending peace talks. Shamir
rejected the proposition during a trip by Shultz to the region last
spring and Hussein subsequently said he would no longer try to
intercede on behalf of the Palestinian Arabs who live in the
territories Israel captured from Jordan and Egypt in the 1967
Mideast war.
   The U.S. blueprint for peace envisaged Jordan resuming its
control of West Bank territory, which it held from 1948 to 1967,
while Shamir favors self-rule but not statehood for the 1.4 million
Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza.
   There is no place in the administration's plan for a separate
Palestinian state.
   Reagan's predecessor, Jimmy Carter, engineered the
Israeli-Egyptian peace treaty by holding a summit at Camp David,
Md., in 1978 with former Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin and
the late Egyptian President Anwar Sadat.
   A meeting in New York would give Israel another opportunity to
step up its relations with Egypt under the treaty. President Hosni
Mubarak has resisted, however, until the settlement can be
broadened to include Palestinians.
   Meanwhile, Yehoshafat Harkabi, a former chief os Israeli
military intelligence, on Wednesday called on his government to
negotiate with the Palestine Liberation Organization for the
creation of a Palestinian state on the West Bank and in Gaza.
   In a Washington speech, Harkabi, who now teaches, writes and
lectures, called the PL0 ``the enemy'' and an ``ugly''
organization. But, he said, Israel must recognize ``there either
will be a Palestinian state as our neighbor or Israel will be the
Palestinian state.''

   A man who chopped down a neighbor's
stately oak tree to improve reception on his television satellite
dish was placed on two years' probation Wednesday and ordered to
stay off the tree owner's property.
   Superior Court Judge Thomas G. West granted the request by
Arthur Anderson, 59, of Redding for accelerated rehabilitation, a
form of probation, on charges stemming from the felling of the
83-year-old oak.
   In his decision, the judge didn't address tree owner Charles
Marriner's request that Anderson's satellite dish be taken away
from him during the probationary period.
   ``He's going to be able to enjoy the fruits of his crime,''
Marriner, 62, also of Redding, told the court.
   Anderson's lawyer, Jeffrey B. Sienkiewicz, told West that his
client is ``very regretful about this entire incident.''
   ``I don't believe that Mr. Anderson knew that the tree was on
Mr. Marriner's property,'' Sienkiewicz said.
   Marriner said, however, that Anderson had to go over a stone
wall and a fence to get to the tree, which was about 170 feet from
the Marriner home.
   Police said it was the second time Anderson was caught on
Marriner's property. They said he cut down a tulip tree there in
May 1987 and was warned then against trespassing.
   West said he was not ordering Anderson to make restitution
because that issue is pending in a civil suit Marriner has filed.
He seeks $37,000 in compensation for the two trees.
   Anderson, a construction worker, cut down the tree June 12,
police said. He told police that he and his wife are ``television
addicts'' and said, ``Now I can get the Disney Channel.''
   Under the accelerated rehabilitation program, available only to
first-time offenders, if the defendant completes probation
successfully, the charges are erased from his record.

   American experts say the Soviets handled
Tuesday's crisis on their Soyuz spacecraft with a sophistication
and confidence that comes from years of successful missions.
   Nicholas Johnson, a U.S. authority on Soviet space, said despite
the drama of two men caught in a malfunctioning space capsule, the
situation was much less serious than problems the Soviets
encountered on earlier flights.
   ``The Soviets have had major anomalies about every four years
since 1967,'' said Johnson, who works for Teledyne Brown
Engineering in Colorado Springs, Colo., a major space contractor.
   ``These are situations which are potentially life threatening
and this one was probably the most modest of all of them,'' he said.
   The Soviets lost one cosmonaut in 1967, three in 1971. In 1975
there was an in-flight launch abort during a prelude to the joint
U.S.-Soviet mission in which an Apollo spacecraft linked up with a
Soyuz in space. And in 1983, there was a launch abort when the
rocket caught fire on its pad and the cosmonauts had to be pulled
off with an emergency system.
   Donald K. Slayton, who was one of the three astronauts aboard
Apollo in the joint mission, said the fact the Soviets passed up an
opportunity to land safely but off target on Tuesday shows there
was no panic or severe emergency.
   ``If they had had a serious problem of running out of
expendables (oxygen) they would have gotten it down somewhere,''
Slayton said. ``That tells you they had it under control.''
   Marcia Smith, the Soviet-space expert at the Library of
Congress, said the successful landing ``was a feather in their cap,
especially for ground controllers who sorted out what the problem
was and sorted out the fix for it.''
   The experts acknowledged they need a great deal more information
before passing final judgments but Slayton said the way in which
the Soviets handled the problem shows they certainly are more
sophisticated now than they were in 1975.
   ``The've got a lot more epxerience now than they did then and
it's probably simpler for them now,'' he said. Slayton, one of the
original seven American astronauts, is vice president of Space
Services Inc., a private launch company in Houston.
   Miss Smith said she does not know whether the Soyuz problem was
with an infra-red sensor that determines the position of the
spacecraft by taking readings of the Earth's horizon or with the
ship's computer.
   ``There is some indication now there was a misprogramming of the
computer,'' she said.
   Being marooned in space has been a concern of all space
travelers since humans first went into orbit. Slayton said this
concern was reflected in the design of the Mercury spacecraft,
America's first manned orbiting vehicle. He said the one-man craft
had three solid retro rockets, any one of which could have brought
the astronauts to Earth, ``somewhere.''
   The Soyuz had two engines: the main one can be shut down and
restarted, while the backup can be fired only once.
   ``I'm interested in what engine they fired,'' said Miss Smith.
She called the backup ``the last shot to get them home.''
   Johnson said the Soviets were just as candid with the public
about their problem nine years ago when Soyuz-33 malfunctioned with
a Soviet and a Bulgarian aboard and had to abandon its plans to
dock with a space station.
   ``We didn't hear all the details after the 33 incident, but they
told us there was a malfunction in the main engine,'' he said.
``The waited 24 hours and used the backup engine to get back.''
   By coincidence, he pointed out, one of the cosmonauts on the
space station was Vladimir Lyakhov, the commander of the Soyuz that
got in trouble on Tuesday.

<DATELINE>BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Leftist guerrillas blew up Colombia's
main oil pipeline, and fierce fighting is driving hundreds of
peasants out a southern state, the Defense Ministry said Wednesday.
   President Virgilio Barco offered Sept. 1 to negotiate peace with
Colombia's six guerrilla groups, but there has been no answer from
the insurgents.
   One of the guerrilla groups, the National Liberation Army, blew
up the Canon Limon oil pipeline on Tuesday, the Defense Ministry
said in a news release.
   Guerrillas have attacked oil pipelines 46 times this year.
   Canon Limon is an oil field in northwest Colombia with 1 billion
barrels of reserve petroleum, discovered four years ago by the
Occidental Petrolum Co.
   The pipeline, which pumps 225,000 barrels of oil a day, will be
shut down at least until Saturday for repairs, the state oil
company Ecopetrol said in a news release.
   The 500-mile pipeline takes oil from Canon Limon, in the state
of Arauca, to the Caribbean port of Covenas.
   Ecopetrol has estimated that guerrilla attacks on oil
installations have cost Colombia $300 million this year.
   Meanwhile, the Defense Ministry communique said heavy fighting
is going on between guerrillas and the army in the southern state
of Tolima. Hundreds of peasants are fleeing the area, the statement
said.
   It said nothing about casualties in the battle with elements of
the leftist Colombian Revolutionary Armed Forces.

   Members of Congress expressed concern
Wednesday that America's electronics industry could suffer
irreparably if it is left behind in the race to develop a new
high-quality television system.
   The result, they said, could cost the country in many ways _ an
even higher trade deficit and thousands of jobs lost, as well as
the loss of potential military, medical, consumer and other
applications that are expected to come with development of the
technology.
   Rep. Edward J. Markey, D-Mass., chairman of the
telecommunications subcommittee, asked electronics industry trade
associations to submit reports to the panel by January outlining
steps the government could take to assure American involvement in
high-definition TV.
   Suggestions have ranged from antitrust exemptions for U.S.
companies involved in HDTV research and development to
appropriating Pentagon funds for HDTV research because of the
potential military applications of the technology, he said.
   Over the last decade, the United States has shifted from a major
supplier to a net importer of electronics products, he noted.
   ``HDTV could make a bad situation worse,'' Markey said at the
final of three hearings on high-definition TV, called HDTV.
   High definition TV produces clearer, brighter images on a wider
TV screen with high-quality sound. The Japanese have been
developing HDTV for nearly 20 years and the Europeans have been
working on their own system for several years. Both systems are
incompatible with U.S. television broadcasting.
   The Federal Communications Commission last week set preliminary
guidelines that will allow research to proceed toward establishing
an American HDTV system. Under the FCC guidelines, a U.S. system
must be able to be received on existing TV sets so current
equipment would not become obsolete. But to receive improved
picture quality, viewers would have to buy a new TV set.
   Richard Elkus Jr., chairman of the Prometrix Corp. and
testifying for the American Electronics Association, said advanced
TV offers the U.S. electronics industry an opportunity to rebound
in a market projected to reach $20 billion in U.S. sales and $40
billion worldwide by the year 2007.
   It also will have ripple effects in other areas, he said. For
example, HDTV products will use a large supply of advanced
semiconductors and HDTV will have applications in military and
medical fields, he said in testimony submitted to the panel.
   He added, however, that regardless of what standard the United
States selects, it won't stop the Japanese from entering the U.S.
market.
   More important than selecting a standard, he said, is government
and industry coming up with a strategy to put American companies
back on the electronics manufacturing track and to develop
marketing and distribition systems that will rival the Japanese.
   About 20 advanced-TV systems are under development and competing
to be designated as the U.S. HDTV standard.
   Richard Wiley, a former FCC chairman and chairman of the FCC's
advisory committee on advanced TV technologies, said his panel's
testing of the systems could begin by the end of the year and will
take a year and a half to complete.
   ``This is not going to be something you're going to solve
overnight,'' he said referring to the selection of a standard
system, the involvement of U.S. electronics companies in the
emerging industry and the gradual replacement of TV sets by
American viewers.
   Wiley estimated that the United States had ``a year or two'' to
establish a national HDTV policy, but Markey said, ``I'm not as
optimistic as you are in the time we have before us.''

<HEAD>U.S. Warns Afghan Rebels Against Drug Sales to Back their Fight</HEAD>

   The United States has warned the anti-Soviet
Mujahedeen rebels in Afghanistan against producing and smuggling
drugs to support their fight, a U.S. official said Wednesday.
   ``We have indicated to them it would be bad for them in Congress
and in U.S. public opinion,'' said the official, speaking on
condition of anonymity.
   The seven rebel groups based in Pakistan are waging a fight for
control of Afghanistan now that the Soviet Union has begun a
pullout to end its 8{-year occupation. The rebels are fighting the
Soviet-backed Kabul government and are also expected to vie for
supremacy among themselves.
   A report issued by the State Department this week said the
estimated 3 million to 5 million Afghan refugees expected to return
next year from Pakistan and Iran will need a quick and profitable
cash crop to make a living on their ravaged lands. The cultivation
of opium and heroin ``will be extremely tempting,'' the report said.
   It urged international agencies coordinating the repatriation of
Afghan refugees to raise the level of public awareness of the
narcotics problem.
   ``It's something we're very aware of and we've talked to the
Mujahedeen about,'' said the U.S. official, who is involved in the
repatriation effort.
   The State Department report said the Soviet pullout, as well as
Pakistani President Zia ul-Haq's death last month in a plane crash
cast serious doubt on the prospects for successful narcotics
control in Southwest Asia.
   The ``International Narcotics Control Strategy Report'' is
issued by the State Department every six months to update
government officials and Congress about attempts of some 50
countries to eradicate drug production and smuggling.
   Afghanistan, already the largest producer of illicit opium in
Southwest Asia, ``is likely to be faced with even greater levels of
opium cultivation in the unsettled conditions following the Soviet
troop withdrawal,'' the report said.
   Whatever new government is established in Kabul after the
Soviets leave, ``will be faced with so many other pressing needs
that narcotics control may not be given a high priority,'' it said.
   In Pakistan, President Zia was a strong supporter of drug
eradication and his unexpected death ``introduced serious
uncertainties in Pakistan that may have an impact on narcotics
control,'' the report said.
   The United States has made it clear to the caretaker government
in Pakistan that narcotics control ``remains a high-priority issue
in U.S.-Pakistan relations,'' the document said.

   An Iranian-backed Shiite Moslem faction
is holding an Israeli soldier who was captured two years ago when
his plane was shot down in south Lebanon, a Shiite source said
Wednesday.
   The source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the Israeli
airman, Ron Arad, ``is now under the control of the Faithful
Resistance Movement,'' a faction based in the Bekaa Valley that
broke away from Justice Minister Nabih Berri's mainstream Shiite
Amal militia early this year.
   The movement is headed by Mustafa Dirani, Amal's former security
chief who was dismissed Feb. 26 on charges of trying to create an
Iranian-controlled wing within the Syrian-backed militia.
   Amal had officially claimed it was holding Arad, 30, the
navigator of an Israeli F-4 Phantom jet downed in south Lebanon
Oct. 16, 1986. But an Amal spokesman, who also refused to be
identified, said ``the Israeli airman is not under our control.''
He declined to elaborate.
   According to the Shiite source, Amal ``lost control'' of Arad
when it fired Dirani, who established his headquarters in the Bekaa
in east Lebanon.
   The source added: ``The Israeli airman has been held by Dirani
all the time and he still holds him.''
   Last Friday, the Israeli army said it was working for Arad's
release and holds Amal responsible for his safety.
   ``Israel stresses and reiterates it considers the Amal
organization, and its leader (Berri), responsible for the health
and safety of the navigator and hopes all necessary steps will be
taken in keeping with this responsibility,'' an Israeli army
statement said.
   Arad's F-4 was shot down by Palestinian guerrillas using a
shoulder-fired Sa-7 missile to defend against an Israeli bombing
raid in south Lebanon. The pilot was rescued by an Israeli
helicopter, but Arad was captured by Shiites.
   Five other Israelis are missing in Lebanon.
   Two soldiers captured in February 1986 are believed held by the
Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God. Three others were
reported missing after a tank battle with the Syrian army in the
Bekaa.
   Syria, the main power broker in Lebanon, maintains 40,000 troops
in the Bekaa, north Lebanon and west and south Beirut.
   In another development, police said two Soviet-designed Katyusha
rockets hit a house in the town of Hasbaya on Wednesday in Israel's
self-designated border ``security zone'' in south Lebanon,
``wounding a number of civilians.''
   Although the police statement did not say who fired the rockets,
Moslem guerrillas regularly attack the Israeli zone.
   The Israeli-backed South Lebanon Army, a mainly Christian
militia, retaliated at 11 a.m. by shelling the village of Kfir,
north of the security zone, with tank fire, polices said.
   The barrage damaged the village's elementary school and eight
houses. Two schoolchildren were wounded, police reported.
   Israel set up the 6-to-10-mile-wide security zone to curb
cross-border raids when it withdrew the bulk of its army from south
Lebanon in 1985.

<HEAD>Park Service Says Past Fire-Fighting Policy Made 1988 Blazes Worse</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A century of misguided attempts to fight every
forest fire worsened this summer's blazes in Yellowstone National
Park by allowing a natural buildup of fuel, National Park Service
officials said Wednesday.
   ``It's obvious it made it worse,'' said Walt Dabney, chief
ranger of the service.
   If more fires of the past had been allowed to burn, fewer
combustible gases would have built up through the natural decaying
of tree leaves and underbrush. Thus today's forest blazes would be
easier to manage, the officials said.
   Though the service will review its policy of letting many fires
burn, ``Our policy is sound, based on scientific research,'' said
William Penn Mott, director of the service.
   ``The problem is the building up of fuel in many areas due to
the previous policy.''
   The Park Service has followed a policy of letting most fires
burn since 1972. It fights them only when they threaten settled
areas or areas outside the parks. Yellowstone was established as a
park in 1872.
   Ecologists say natural fires are important in preserving species
diversity and attracting wildlife. In fact, many species, such as
the lodgepole pine typical of Yellowstone, depend on fire for
reproduction.
   The Forest Service _ whose land almost completely surrounds
Yellowstone _ follows a similar policy for its wilderness areas.
But it relies on deliberate, controlled burning and timber
harvesting to manage the fifth-sixths of its domain that is not
wilderness. In that larger area, most fires are fought if the
service judges that they will not stay within ``reasonable
bounds,'' said Peterson.
   Since July 21, the Park Service has been trying to put out the
fires in Yellowstone, and has directed its other installations to
extinguish quickly any fire for which there won't be resources to
monitor and steer away from vulnerable areas. It has banned
controlled burning for the rest of the summer.
   Of the 13 separate fire outbreaks in and near Yellowstone, five
originally were allowed to burn, some of them starting on Forest
Service land outside the park. Some fires have merged, leaving
eight active now.
   ``In hindsight, we would have tried to put out every fire,''
Peterson said. ``If we had known the weather would evolve the way
it did, we would have done it differently,'' Mott said.
   ``Without a crystal ball or higher connections that we don't
have, we can't know it's not going to rain in July and August,''
Dabney said.
   He said the current Western fires are on a scale not seen for
more than 200 years.
   On Capitol Hill, senators from Wyoming and Montana complained to
Interior Secretary Donald Hodel that allowing some of the
Yellowstone fires to burn was a grave mistake. They said Mott
should be fired because of the Yellowstone destruction.
   ``The National Park Service and the Forest Service made a very
gross error in judgement _ naively and stupidly,'' said Max Baucus,
D-Mont. ``... There's been too much hope and prayer and not enough
action.''

<HEAD>House Begins Considering $2 Billion Addition to Drug War</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Inserts new 3rd graf, ``After a,'' with debate over for day</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By LARRY MARGASAK</BYLINE>

   The House began Congress' latest assault on
illegal narcotics Wednesday, taking up a 375-page bill that would
spend some $2 billion for every conceivable method of fighting drug
abuse.
   The House will likely labor through next week on the work
product of 11 committees, which might undergo major surgery from
more than three dozen amendments. Some proposed changes will
provide the most controversial moments of debate.
   After a day devoted to debate and explanations of the bill's
provisions, the House postponed votes on amendments until Thursday.
   Speaker Jim Wright, D-Texas, has labeled the bill
``bipartisan,'' a strategy that will allow incumbents of both
parties to claim credit for the politically popular legislation
during their re-election campaigns.
   But the tactic also guarantees votes on Republican-inspired
amendments that would allow the federal death penalty for
drug-related killings, deny federal benefits to convicted drug
users and admit some illegally seized evidence in court.
   The House took up the bill on Congress' first day back from a
month-long recess.
   Other issues that lawmakers must settle before they quit next
month to campaign for re-election are spending levels for the Star
Wars anti-missile program, arms control issues, a major overhaul of
the welfare system, competing proposals on child care and aid to
Nicaragua's Contra rebels.
   Democrats may push for votes on their legislation to increase
the minimum wage from $3.35 per hour to $4.55 hourly over a
three-year period, an increase opposed by President Reagan.
   It was just two years ago that Congress passed its last
comprehensive anti-drug bill, but lawmakers from both parties now
agree it failed to stem the tide.
   ``I hope it does,'' Wright said when asked whether this measure
will have greater success. ``I don't know what else to do if it
doesn't.''
   He said more treatment facilities and education are needed, and
called local police ``ill-equipped and undermanned ... against drug
lords.''
   The bill would increase spending for federal and state law
enforcement agencies to intercept illegal drugs on land, in the air
and on the seas.
   It would establish a seven-day waiting period for purchasing a
handgun, a provision that makes the legislation the latest
lightning rod for the gun control debate.
   Banking laws would be changed to try to stop the laundering of
drug money at legitimate financial institutions. Education programs
would be expanded for youth, including disadvantaged youngsters and
the most hardened gang members.
   The bill encourages Latin American countries to form a regional
anti-narcotics force and pledges financial support if one is
started.
   Federal contractors would be required to maintain a drug-free
workplace. Tight controls would be placed on the U.S.-made
chemicals that are used to manufacture heroin, cocaine and other
drugs.
   States would be given money to develop programs to stop the
spread of AIDS by intravenous drug abusers.
   As debate began, the bill's Democratic floor manager, Rep.
Charles B. Rangel of New York, urged colleagues to ``meet the
challenge'' of fighting illegal drugs.
   While pledging not to discuss such issues as Vice President
George Bush's role as Reagan's drug coordinator, Rangel accused the
administration of ``asking for severe cuts'' in the programs
Congress approved as part of the 1986 anti-drug bill.
   He also told the House: ``Don't allow the emotionalism of
amendments to distract from what we really have to do ... give
assistance to those people on the front line.''
   Nonetheless, Rep. George Gekas, R-Pa., urged lawmakers to
support his amendment for what he called ``the ultimate weapon''
against drug traffickers _ the death penalty.
   The proposal would permit capital punishment for anyone who
intentionally kills a person while committing a federal drug felony.
   Rep. William McCollum, R-Fla., will propose that the government
deny student loans, public housing, licenses and other benefits for
five years to those convicted of two or more drug-related offenses
within a 10-year period; and for 10 years to those convicted of
drug distribution.
   McCollum also will propose that a portion of federal highway
money be withheld from states that do not require suspension or
revocation of drivers' licenses for those convicted of drug-related
offenses.
   Rep. Dan Lungren, R-Calif., will try to win admission of
illegally seized evidence in federal cases if police made a search
with the ``good faith'' belief they were acting constitutionally.
   McCollum will attempt to strip from the bill a provision calling
for a seven-day waiting period for the purchase of a handgun,
during which law-enforcement authorities could perform a background
check.
   Employees and supporters of the National Rifle Association
contacted lawmakers to oppose the provision while hundreds of
uniformed police officers supporting the delay roamed through the
Capitol on Wednesday seeking support.
   Meanwhile, Attorney General Richard Thornburgh told an executive
working group on federal-state-local prosecutorial relations that
the anti-drug bill has provisions that ``hold great potential,''
but also has language that ``could hinder and obstruct'' law
enforcement efforts.
   He said the administration supports the death penalty, but wants
to strengthen sections on the admission of evidence and laundering
of ``ill-gotten gains.''

<HEAD>Private Study Recommends Dismantling U.S. Embassy in Moscow</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM DRINKARD</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A private engineering study of the bug-riddled
new U.S. Embassy in Moscow finds that the structure cannot be
salvaged and recommends it be dismantled and rebuilt, says a House
member involved in the issue.
   This time, the engineers told the State Department, only
American labor and materials should be used, there should be better
security on the construction site and the building should be
pre-constructed in the United States as much as possible.
   Rep. Olympia Snowe, R-Maine, said the report by BDM Corp.
supported the conclusion she had reached following a tour of the
site more than a year ago, soon after it was discovered that the
building was suffused with a sophisticated Soviet eavesdropping
system.
   One earlier study, by former Defense Secretary James R.
Schlesinger, had concluded the eight-story building could be
partially salvaged by removing and rebuilding the top three floors
for use in unclassified embassy work and called for building a new
annex for top-secret activities.
   ``The administration should move quickly to begin tearing down
the new building this fall so that they take advantage of the warm
season,'' Snowe said in a statement. She said some $38 million
remains available in the construction account that could be used
for the dismantling.
   The structure should be taken apart carefully, she said, rather
than demolished, so that building components can be shipped back to
the United States for further study by intelligence experts, who
still haven't fully figured out the technology used in the Soviet
bugging system.
   BDM, which studied the embassy problems at the State
Department's request, concluded that complete dismantling and
reconstruction would cost $160 million and take 45 months to
complete, Snowe said. There is no way the new structure can be
modified to make it secure, she said.
   Abandoning the new project and trying to rehabilitate the
current outmoded embassy building would cost $170 million and take
80 months, leaving the project susceptible to security problems for
a longer time and increasing the likelihood of inflationary cost
increases, the firm concluded.
   The Reagan administration has not yet decided what to do about
the embassy building, which has already cost nearly $60 million in
construction costs and studies.

<HEAD>US Offers Philippines Nearly Half-Billion In Aid To Retain Bases</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BARRY SCHWEID</BYLINE>

   The United States has offered the Philippines
$489 million in aid this year in an effort to extend American use
of two major military bases for two years, congressional sources
said Wednesday.
   The offer includes a doubling of the yearly fee for using Subic
Bay Naval Base and Clark Air Base from $180 million to $360 million.
   But the Philippines government is asking for a more sizable
increase _ to more than $1 billion in aid overall.
   The negotiations on renewing the base agreement, whose terms
expire in 1991, are in suspension at least until Foreign Minister
Raul Manglapus meets here next week with State Department officials
and key members of Congress, said the sources, who spoke only on
condition of anonymity.
   This year's military and economic aid to the Philippines totals
$463 million. The Reagan administration is seeking congressional
approval of $289 million for next year, in addition to food aid,
which this year amounts to $62 million.
   Although negotiations over the U.S. bases in the Philippines and
also in Greece have broken down, the State Department on Tuesday
voiced confidence the talks would be resumed and settlements
reached.
   Both allies benefit from the presence of U.S. military forces on
their territory, spokesman Charles E. Redman said. He said the
talks with the Philippines would be reopened on a ``mutually
convenient date'' and the negotiations with Greece had been
suspended temporarily.
   Redman said Ambassador Nicholas Platt had returned to Washington
from Manila for ``long-planned consultations'' and that further
discussions probably would be held when Manglapus, chief negotiator
for the Philippines, is here next week.
   Secretary of State George P. Shultz is scheduled to meet with
Manglapus on Sept. 30, during the special session of the U.N.
General Assembly in New York.
   The Philippines, a former U.S. colony, have had strong ties with
Washington since their partnership against Japan in World War II.
Since Corazon Aquino took over as president in 1986, U.S. military
and economic aid has totaled $1.3 billion.
   The Subic Bay and Clark bases are among the most important U.S.
military bases overseas.

<HEAD>Company Announces Steps To Prevent Use Of Acne Drug During
Pregnancy</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL MORAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEWARK, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The maker of the anti-acne medicine Accutane
announced a federally sanctioned program Wednesday aimed at
preventing the drug's use during pregnancy, a practice that studies
show can cause birth defects.
   The drug, sold by Hoffmann-La Roche Inc. since 1982, has been
identified by the company as a factor in at least 70 cases of birth
defects. And U.S. Food and Drug Administration spokeswoman Faye
Peterson said incidents of deformities caused by the drug ``are
notoriously underreported.''
   Donald D. Hollander, president of the the Nutley-based company's
Roche Dermatologics division, said the manufacturer will begin
requiring physicians prescribing Accutane to obtain a signature on
a patient consent form advising of the drug's risks.
   Womens' health groups and some professional associations have
long sought such a procedure for Accutane. Hollander said such
consent forms are unprecedented for a drug already approved by the
federal government.
   ``In essense, the message we wish to communicate is simple,''
Hollander said. ``Accutane should not be prescribed or taken if
pregnancy cannot be excluded during therapy.''
   Hollander said Hoffmann-La Roche was taking another highly
unusual initiative in offering to pay for women using Accutane to
receive an initial pregnancy test and birth-control evaluation it
recommends.
   The company also promised to distribute pregnancy information
kits, offer a pregnancy counseling referral service and make major
changes in the way it packages the drug to include health warnings.
   The offer to reimburse doctors for pregnancy testing and birth
control exams ``is strictly a company initiative,'' but the other
moves announced at a New York news conference essentially amount to
an adoption of guidelines written in April by an FDA advisory
committee, said Ms. Peterson.
   ``We recommended these steps in order to curb overprescription
of the drug, which should really be used as a last resort for
people with severe, recalcitrant acne when other methods of control
have failed,'' Ms. Peterson said.
   At the April meeting, the federal committee rejected calls to
pull the drug off the market, noting that it is the only effective
treatment for a severe, disfiguring form of acne.
   She said the FDA expected to complete evaluation of Hoffmann-La
Roche's new packaging proposal within two months.
   Dr. William Cunningham, company assistant vice president and
director of medical affairs, said the proposal calls for the drug
to be packaged in 10-tablet, individually wrapped envelopes, a
change from the 100-tablet bottles previously marketed.
   Cunningham said the packets, which will be covered with warnings
against use of the drug during pregnancy, will help prevent overuse
of the drug.
   Reaction to the company's announcement from medical and womens'
groups was enthusiastic.
   Cindy Pearson, program director of the National Women's Health
Network in Washington, said the use of patient consent forms would
ensure that doctors and patients discuss the risks before the drug
is taken.
   William Heineke, spokesman for the American Academy of
Dermatology, said the group favors the use of all other alternative
treatments for severe acne before resorting to Accutane.
   ``A female using Accutane should employ effective methods of
contraception, should have a negative pregnancy test two weeks
prior to using the drug, at least once a month during use and a
month after completion of treatment,'' he said.

   Five astronauts on Wednesday
inspected the space shuttle Discovery, which they hope to ride into
orbit late this month, and their commander reported, ``It all looks
clean; it all looks good.''
   Commander Rick Hauck and his crew drove to Launch Pad 39B for a
session that also included an examination of the communications
satellite in the spaceship's cargo bay and a walk-through of launch
pad emergency escape procedures.
   Hauck's crewmates are pilot Dick Covey and mission specialists
George Nelson, Mike Lounge and Dave Hilmers.
   They received launch preparation briefings and visited the pad
as the shuttle launch team began a countdown for a simulated
liftoff on Thursday, during which the astronauts will board
Discovery's cabin for the final two hours.
   The mock liftoff, scheduled for 10 a.m., is the last major test
before launch.
   ``After tomorrow, we're all going to be ready to fly,'' Hauck
told reporters after the pad exercises.
   Asked if he saw anything that would prevent a late September
launch of the first space shuttle mission in 32 months, he replied,
``I haven't seen anything.''
   The National Aeronautics and Space Administration is aiming for
a liftoff in the last week in September. But officials won't set a
firm date until Sept. 14, following a two-day flight readiness
review here.
   Engineers were troubleshooting one technical problem that was
not expected to affect the launch date.
   Three valves that control the flow of gaseous oxygen in
Discovery's main engines and help pressurize the fuel tank were
removed for inspection after two of them performed sluggishly
during a recent launch pad test firing of the shuttle's main
engines.
   The parts were flown to the plant of their maker, Eaton Corp. of
Valencia, Calif., where the two sluggish valves were found to be
slightly contaminated with minute particles of chrome and stainless
steel, said NASA spokeswoman Lisa Malone. They were cleaned and are
being tested, she said.
   Three matching valves were removed from sister ship, Atlantis,
and were found to be contamination-free. Malone said engineers will
examine all six and pick the three in the best condition for
installation on Discovery.

   The two sellers of chlordimeform, a pesticide
used on an eighth of the nation's cotton crop, have agreed to quit
marketing the product and will recall leftovers from farmers after
the current growing season, the Environmental Protection Agency
said Wednesday.
   The agency said it would make the distribution or use of the
chemical, a suspected cancer agent, illegal after Feb. 19. The
product has been used to destroy the eggs and larvae of the tobacco
budworm and the cotton bollworm.
   Pesticide recalls are rare, and a spokesman for one of the
companies, Ciba-Geigy Corp., said in Grensboro, N.C. he could
recall none that took products back from farmers.
   Recalls will begin in four or five weeks, after use for the
current growing season is over, said the spokesman, Steve Powell.
Farmers will receive refunds for unused amounts and reimbursement
for any shipping expenses.
   ``It's our hope'' that little will be left over, he said.
   The other licensed seller is Nor-Am Chemical Co. of Wilmington,
Del. Powell said he did not know whether Nor-Am bought its product
from Ciba-Geigy or manufactured its own. At Nor-Am, spokesmen who
could discuss chlordimeform had gone for the day.
   Ciba-Geigy has sold chlordimeform under the trade name Galecron
and Nor-Am sold it under the name Fundal. About a million pounds
annually had been used in recent years.
   In 1985 and 1986, EPA said it intended to undertake a special
study of chlordimeform because of evidence that it caused tumors in
laboratory animals.
   In February, the companies proposed to stop sales and give back
their licenses, and this proposal, now accepted by EPA, means that
the special study will not be started.
   Use on food crops was stopped in the 1970s after cancer in lab
animals began to appear, and usage restrictions were tightened. EPA
said it did not believe there was any significant dietary risk from
chlordimeform, but it intends to revoke the regulations permitting
a small residue on treated food.
   Although there appear ``significant risks for applicators
exposed over a lifetime, the available data do not support'' an
immediate emergency ban on use, EPA said.
   One of the breakdown products of chlordimeform, a chemical
called 5-CAT, appears to cause the tumors observed in lab animals,
said Karem Ahmed of the consulting firm of Environ Corp., who
studied chlordimeform while at the Natural Resources Defense
Council.
   The chemical 5-CAT is also used as a raw material in the
dyestuffs industry in Germany and one group of dye workers studied
there showed higher than normal incidence of bladder cancer,
according to Ahmed. This chemical is no longer used in the United
States, and EPA said it would treat it as a new chemical requiring
an EPA safety review if any company wants to re-introduce it.
   Some workers in the leather and other industries who use
dimethylformamide, a starting chemical for one method of mking
chlordimeform, have developed excessive testicular cancer.
   EPA said it was consulting the Centers for Disease Control and
the Association of State and Territorial Health Officers, as well
as the companies, on whether and how workers should be notified of
possible effects of exposure to chlordimeform and related chemicals.
   Powell said the company had told its own production workers
about chlordimeform's effects, but he did not know what might be
required for notices to farm workers.

<HEAD>Three Policemen Convicted In Torture and Disappearance Of Robbery
Suspect</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MADRID, Spain (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A three-judge panel convicted three police
officers on Wednesday in the torture and forced disappearance of a
robbery suspect and sentenced them to 29 years each in prison.
   Four other officers were acquitted of charges of torture and
forgery of official documents.
   Salvador Dominguez, head of the Audiencia Territorial of the
Madrid court, read the unanimous decision to a court packed with
journalists after a four-month trial and an additional 39 days of
deliberation.
   The trial began in April and was viewed by political observers
as an indictment of the failure of Socialist Prime Minister Felipe
Gonzalez's government to curb abuses by the national police. Many
of the senior police officials entered service during the Francisco Franco.
   The government issued no statement after the verdict.
   Dominguez said the court found the three officers guilty of
illegal detention, torture and forced disappearance of Santiago
Corella and forgery of official documents.
   The three, arrested two years ago, are Francisco Javier
Fernandez Alvarez, 45, former chief of the national police's
anti-robbery brigade in Madrid, Inspector Victoriano Gutierrez
Lobo, 42, and Inspector Francisco Aguilar Gonzalez, 41.
   The 29-year-old Corella had a record of previous arrests when he
was picked up as a suspect in a jewelry store robbery on Nov. 12,
1983.
   Prosecutors said the three policemen tortured Corella physically
and mentally in a Madrid police station to such an extent that they
decided to dispose of him _ ``make him disappear.''
   They said the officers forged police registers to cover
themselves.
   The defendants said Corella escaped the day of his arrest after
they took him to a field outside Madrid to question him about an
arms cache.
   Corella's body was never found.
   Defense lawyer Manuel Tuero told reporters the defense ``will
exhaust all appeals.''
   The court ordered each of the three convicted men or the state
to pay $40,600 to Corella's wife and each of his two children.
   Witnesses testified that the officers set up jewelry store
robberies from which they split the take.
   The three also were indicted in at least two different cases of
police corruption and await trial on those charges.
   The officers remain in preventive custody in a special prison
unit in the northern Rioja region.

<HEAD>Elton John Sale Tops $6 Million After Two Days</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The running total for the auction of rock star
Elton John's castoff possessions soared to $6.2 million Wednesday
with two days left to go.
   ``It is as much as we had expected all four days of the sale to
fetch,'' said Philippe Garner of Sotheby's auction house, who
catalogued and ran the second day's sale of rare art nouveau and
art deco glass, furniture and statuettes.
   Sotheby's said the 500 lots fetched $4.2 million, bringing the
total for the first two days to $6.2 million.
   John said earlier he is selling off items from his mansion near
Windsor, west of London, because he has no more room and wants to
collect other things.
   In contrast to the opening day, when John's fantastic
eyeglasses, costumes, platform boots, rock music memorabilia and
personal jewelry drew crowds of pop fans, American and European art
dealers were out in force Wednesday.
   ``But there were still a lot of strangers and new buyers and a
lot of them were in very trendy clothes,'' said Fiona James, a
Sotheby's publicist.
   Because of the connection with the pianist-singer-composer, the
art objects went for well above estimates. Glass vases by Frenchman
Emile Galle and lamps by Charles Louis Tiffany of New York went for
three times the expected prices.
   An unidentified American buyer paid the top price of the day,
$152,400, nearly double the top estimate, for a sofa and four
chairs with upholstery designed about 1925 by French artist Raoul
Dufy.
   The Macklowe Gallery of New York paid $152,400 for three leaded
glass table lamps and Seibu, the Japanese department store which
bought several lots of jewelry Tuesday, paid $115,200 for a lamp
and a 1920s bronze and ivory figure of a woman.

<HEAD>Commissioner: Police Couldn't Cope With IRA Agents, Asked Army
Help</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GIBRALTAR (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The police commissioner testified at a
coroner's inquest Wednesday that he asked the British army to help
seize IRA agents because of fears a car bomb might explode and
police couldn't handle with the situation.
   The three unarmed IRA agents were shot and killed by British
soldiers on March 6, raising strong criticism of the government of
British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and spurring charges that
the deaths were part of an unofficial ``shoot-to-kill'' policy
against the IRA.
   The Thatcher government denied the charges. Observers from the
human rights organization Amnesty International and from Ireland
are attending the inquest.
   Hearings began Tuesday in the deaths of Mairead Farrell, 31,
Daniel McCann, 30, and Sean Savage, 24, who the Irish Republican
Army said were IRA members in active service when they were killed
in the British fortress colony.
   The inquest has no power of prosecution, but the Gibraltar
attorney general is expected to return criminal indictments if it
rules the killings unlawful.
   Gibraltar Police Commissioner Joseph Canepa told Coroner Felix
Pizzarello and his jury that he was informed March 4 that the three
IRA members had been sighted in Malaga, Spain, about 75 miles
northeast of Gibraltar.
   Police in Gibraltar then set up observation posts at strategic
locations on the rock, near Spain's southernmost tip.
   At 12:30 p.m. on March 6, McCann and Farrell were identified by
police as the two entered Gibraltar from Spain on foot, Canepa said.
   They went to the Gibraltar Assembly area where they met Savage,
who earlier parked a white Renault in the neighborhood.
   Canepa said arrests were almost made at that stage. At 3:25
p.m., the three moved north toward Gibraltar's border with Spain.
   ``I asked the soldier to examine the car (Renault) and he
reported that in his view the car contained a bomb,'' Canepa
testified. ``I felt the police couldn't cope with the situation and
so I requested the military help.''
   The soldier Canepa refered to was one of seven military people
believed to have been from Britain's elite Special Air Service unit.
   It was then, Canepa said, that he signed a form asking the
military to intercept and apprehend the three suspects.
   ``I formed the view that we should arrest on suspicion of
conspiracy to murder,'' Canepa testified.
   Minutes later, he received a report that the three IRA activists
had been shot dead as they walked toward the border, Canepa said.
   Canepa said it was later determined there was no bomb in the
Renault.
   Two days later, however, Spanish police located a car rented by
the three IRA agents in a parking garage in Marbella, Spain, a city
about halfway between Gibraltar and Malaga. They said it contained
140 pounds of explosives and a timing device.
   Another witness, a senior British security officer identified
only as `O' for security reasons, told the court the intelligence
service failed to foresee these developments before the shootings:
   _That the three IRA members would cross into Gibraltar from
Spain unarmed two days before a suspected bombing attempt.
   _That the three would first drive an empty car in from Spain to
block a space near the suspected bombing target.
   _And that they would use a timing device rather than remote
control to detonate the bomb.
   `O' testified while concealed from the public by a curtain
around the witness stand.
   Belfast lawyer Patrick McGrory, representing the families of
those killed, tried to show in cross-examining `O' that British
intelligence did not have enough evidence to justify killing the
three rather than simply arresting them.

   Criminal investigators said
Wednesday they believe two suspected IRA men arrested in West
Germany were involved in at least four bombings and shootings on
the Continent aimed at British forces.
   They said they had evidence the two were involved in an Aug. 12
attack in Belgium that killed a British soldier.
   ``According to our investigations so far, we have found links
between attacks against British forces in the Netherlands, West
Germany and Belgium,'' said Alexander Prechtel, a spokesman for the
federal prosecutor's office.
   The men, identified as Gerard Thomas Hanratty, 29, and Terence
Gerard McGeough, 30, were heavily armed when they were arrested in
West Germany on Aug. 30 after they crossed the Dutch border. Police
found two Kalashnikov AK-47 automatic rifles and three .38-caliber
pistols in their car.
   Prechtel said weapons tests indicated that one of the pistols
was used in the fatal shooting in Ostend, Belgium, of a British
soldier.
   The IRA claimed responsibility for the attack.
   On July 13, a bomb attack on a British barracks in Duisburg,
West Germany, injured nine soldiers. On May 1, a shooting attack
killed one member of Brtain's Royal Air Force and wounded two in
Roermond, the Netherlands.
   Two soldiers were injured in the bombing of a British barrack in
Duesseldorf, West Germany, on Aug. 5.
   Authorities believe others were involved and the prosecutor's
office has offered a $27,000 reward for information leading to
their capture.
   The mainly Roman Catholic Irish Republican Army is fighting to
end British rule in Protestant-ruled Northern Ireland and unite it
with the 95-percent Catholic Republic of Ireland.

<HEAD>Hungary Proposes Amnesty For Participants In 1956 Uprising</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government on proposed a general
amnesty Wednesday for people who were imprisoned for taking part in
the 1956 uprising, Budapest radio reported.
   Government spokesman Gyoergy Marosan also was quoted as saying
changes were needed in a decade-old joint project with
Czechoslovakia to build dams and power plants on the Danube River.
He gave no details.
   The amnesty program means ``1956 cases'' will be erased from
individual files and criminal records, allowing those cleared to
have passports and travel abroad, Marosan said. The proposal is to
be presented to the presidential council for formal approval within
a month.
   The 1956 uprising began Oct. 23 with mass demonstrations for a
new government and demands that Soviet troops leave Hungary. On
Nov. 4, 200,000 Soviet soldiers and 2,500 tanks entered Budapest to
crush the revolt.
   How many people would be affected by the amnesty program was not
known immediately.
   A source in Budapest, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said
changes int the power project were decided upon after the
government received 30 studies by official agencies and scientific
institutions, nine of them critical.
   The Czechoslovak-Hungarian project began 10 years ago. It has
has been criticized by environmentalists in Hungary and Austria,
who say it would destroy drinking water reserves, wetlands and
wildlife.
   At an international symposium on the project in Budapest last
weekend, independent experts called for a halt in construction on
the Hungarian side and for a referendum to decide whether the
project should be completed.
   According to the broadcast, Marosan said the government
discussed the project and decided the best solution was to get on
with construction after the unspecified ``partial modifications''
are made.
   On the basis of scientific opinion available to it, the
government will submit a report to Parliament when it meets Oct. 5.
An Academy of Sciences committee will be fornmed to deal with the
necessary changes, the broadcast said, but the government will not
propose a referendum.

<HEAD>Tropical Storm Florence Develops In The Gulf Of Mexico</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Heavy rain fell in northern and central Florida on Wednesday,
but most of the nation had clear skies as strong wind whipped
across the upper Midwest and a tropical storm formed over the Gulf
of Mexico.
   Tropical storm Florence, with 40-mph winds, was born in the
south central Gulf and was expected to remain stationary and
strengthen during the next 24 hours.
   A deep low pressure system over south-central Canada continued
to bring gusty winds to the northern and central Rockies, Great
Plains and the upper Mississippi Valley.
   Winds gusted to 46 mph at Salina, Kan., and 51 miles an hour at
Cheyenne, Wyo., early Wednesday afternoon.
   The only significant area of rain was in northern and central
Florida, where a stationary front continued to produce showers and
thunderstorms.
   Temperatures were on the mild side east of the Plains. Readings
were mostly in the 70s with some 60s in Ohio and the northern and
central Appalachians. Temperatures were in the 80s in Florida.
   Warmer readings covered the central and southern Plains with
some readings into the low 90s. Goodland, Kan., reached 95 degrees
by 2 p.m. CDT.
   Temperatures across the West were mostly in the 80s. A cold
front over northern Wyoming sent cool air into Montana, with
afternoon temperatures in the 60s and low 70s. Temperatures were
near 100 degrees in the desert Southwest but in the 50s and 60s in
the Pacific Northwest and along the California coast.
   Cities setting record lows Wednesday included Baton Rouge, La.
with 56 degrees; Beaufort, S.C. 63; Beckley W.Va. 38; Birmingham,
Ala. 50; Bluefield, W.Va. 42; Bristol, Tenn., 47; Charleston, S.C.,
61; Charleston, W.Va., 45; Cincinnati 41; Columbus, Ohio, 40;

   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 54
degrees at Arcata, Calif., to 101 degrees at Needles, Calif. The
nation's low Wednesday morning was 25 degrees at Gunnison, Colo.
   The forecast for Thursday called for showers and thunderstorms
continuing along a stationary front from southeast Virginia across
the Carolinas and Georgia to Florida and southern Alabama. Widely
scattered showers were predicted in portions of northern Michigan,
Wisconsin and northern illinois.
   High temperatures should be in the 60s in northern Minnesota and
parts of northern Michigan, the 90s across the southern Plains and
the central and southern Plateau, and the 90s to near 105 degrees
in the desert Southwest and interior valleys of California.
Elsewhere, highs should be in the 70s and 80s.

   Pakistani fighter jets shot down an
Afghan warplane 12 miles inside Pakistan on Wednesday and Afghan
air raids hit three mountain villages within this country,
authorities said.
   The U.S. government on Wednesday protested Afghan raids in
Pakistan, which serves as a base for guerrillas fighting the
Soviet-backed Afghan government.
   A Defense Ministry spokesman said several Afghan aircraft
intruded into Pakistani territory but were spotted by a two-plane
Pakistan air force patrol which fired on the intruders.
   He said one Afghan jet was shot down over Nawagai, 120 miles
northwest of Islamabad, but did not say what happened to the pilot.
   The spokesman refused to say what type of plane was involved,
but sources said it may have been a MiG-23. All spoke on condition
of anonymity,
   The spokesman said that when intercepted by the Pakistani
aircraft, the Afghan warplanes turned back toward their country.
Some dropped their extra fuel tanks and bombs, which fell over the
villages of Bandagai and Guro, close to Nawagai. Four people were
injured and two cows were killed, he said.
   In a separate incident, three people were injured when Afghan
aircraft dropped 10 bombs on the villages of Shago Khas, Girokhawar
and Dauda Pahar, 20 miles inside Pakistan, a police spokesman said.
   State Department spokesman Charles Redman said in Washington
that warplanes from Afghanistan have repeatedly raided Pakistani
territory.
   ``We again condemn it and view with grave concern these
successive violations of the Geneva accord and international law,''
he said.
   Wednesday's downing was the fourth Afghan-Soviet aircraft lost
over Pakistan since U.S.-backed Moslem guerrillas began fighting
the Marxist government in Afghanistan in 1978.

   A bomb exploded Wednesday at a
shopping center entrance in an exclusive white suburb of
Johannesburg, killing a black man and shattering windows.
   The man's body was torn asunder outside the main entrance of the
North Park Plaza in suburban Northcliff.
   No one else was hurt.
   Police did not identify the type of bomb or say whether the man
was carrying it when it went off at 7:25 p.m..
   Security at shopping centers, restaurants and other public
places in South Africa was increased recently after the public
demanded more thorough searches of people and parcels.
   On Tuesday night, government-run television broadcast a special
program on bombs, with a reporter displaying the most common types
used in South Africa and showing how he could hide two under his
coat.
   Wednesday's bombing was the second in three weeks at a shopping
center in an affluent white suburb and followed a declaration
earlier this year by guerrilla leaders of the outlawed African
National Congress that they would take their fight to the white
neighborhoods.
   The government usually blames such bombings on the ANC. The
group seldom comments on such incidents, although it has said it is
conducting a campaign of sabotage aimed at ending the apartheid
system of racial separation and white dominance of the government
and economy.
   Seventeen people have been killed and nearly 200 injured in
nearly 40 bombings in South Africa this year.
   More than 100 explosions have caused 31 deaths and about 565
injuries since the government declared a national state of
emergency on June 12, 1986. Police were given wide powers to detain
people without charge, restrict the press, prohibit certain
statements and almost all forms of public protest.
   Office buildings occupied by anti-apartheid organizations have
also been bombed and grenades have been planted or thrown at the
houses of government opponents.
   The latest occurred Aug. 31 when an explosion shattered Khotso
House, a building housing the South African Council of Churches and
other prominent groups.

   Mexico mopped up from two tropical storms
Wednesday as yet another depression formed in the Gulf of Mexico.
   Scattered, fragmentary reports indicated that storms killed at
least 39 people in less than a week and left tens of thousands
homeless. Many communities are without electricity, telephones or
drinking water.
   As relief work went on in such hard-hit states as Veracruz,
Oaxaca, Chiapas and Guerrero, Tropical Storm Florence churned in
the southern Gulf about 125 miles north-northwest of Merida on the
Yucatan Peninsula.
   Florence's 45 mph winds strengthened Wednesday night as the
storm swirled in a stationary position. Forecasters at the National
Hurricane Center in Miami said they could not predict what
direction it would take.
   ``It's out in the open waters of the Gulf right now,''
forecaster Noel Risynchok said. ``The only current threat would be
to marine interests.''
   The storm was expected to remain in place through Thursday, he
said.
   Florence is the sixth named storm of the 1988 Atlantic Hurricane
season. Only one, Debby, had winds exceeding 74 mph, making it a
hurricane.
   Debby hit Veracruz state Friday night. While Debby was drenching
one side of Mexico, another tropical weather system, Kristy, was
soaking the Pacific Coast.
   Both spawned heavy rains that sent rivers over their banks,
downed power lines, washed out roads and rail lines and forced
evacuation of tens of thousands.
   Veracruz state officials said Wednesday an undetermined number
of people was still missing in flooded areas. The also said major
Gulf ports and some roads were still closed.
   Officials in southern Oaxaca state on the Pacific reported five
more deaths Wednesday, raising the state toll to at least 12 and
the national toll to 39.
   Veracruz officials confirmed 16 dead and Chiapas state officials
confirmed five. Central Hildalgo state reported four dead and two
deaths were reported in Guerrero, on the Pacific.
   At least half the corn crop in northern Veracruz was wiped out,
a month before harvest, said state spokeswoman Guadalupe Lopez.
   ``Some of the worst damage was in the orchards: citrus and
bananas,'' she said, adding that flooding also damaged coffee and
beans.
   Nationwide, crop damage was minimal, said Pascacio Taboada of
the Agriculture Ministry. Most orchards will survive the flooding,
he predicted.
   Taboada estimated flood waters covered less than 150,000 acres,
less than 1 percent of Mexico's cultivated land.
   He said heavy rains filled most reservoirs to 70 percent of
capacity, which could mean ample water to irrigate the fall and
spring crops.

   A 17th suspect was arrested Wednesday and
Israel radio said a general was suspected of involvement in the
sale of exemptions from military service, a scandal that has
tainted the nearly sacrosanct army.
   The latest suspect is a Tel Aviv eye, nose and ear specialist
who allegedly sold false medical certificates. Israel radio said
the doctor, Gideon Bialistock, was a Dutch citizen who has lived in
Israel on a tourist visa for 20 years.
   Some Israelis have paid up to $10,000 for exemptions from
compulsory military service.
   Later Wednesday, authorities released a lieutenant colonel, one
of 16 suspects taken into custody Monday, Israel Television said.
It did not elaborate.
   The scandal came to light Monday when military and civilian
police arrested 16 Israelis, including high-ranking officers and
doctors, after a six-month undercover investigation.
   Foreign Minister Shimon Peres praised the army's response. ``I
appreciate the fact that the army reacted immediately, publicly,
and didn't cover up anything,'' he said on Israel radio. Peres is a
former defense minister.
   Army officials said they would review the procedures for
granting exemptions.
   The scandal has angered Israelis who consider the army a sacred
institution and inspired scathing editorials in many newspapers.
   ``The uncovering of an entire network ... whose beneficiaries
may have run into the hundreds poses a new problem for the army,''
the Jerusalem Post said. It cautioned against ``crying havoc'' but
recommended ``greater vigilance'' in the future.
   Members of the ring allegedly arranged exemptions from draft or
reserve duty for hundreds of people by providing false medical
certificates or tampering with army computers.
   Two army majors are the key suspects, Israel radio said
Wednesday _ one who had access to army computers and another who
headed the manpower division's medical committee.
   It said a brigadier general was suspected of involvement in the
scheme but had not yet been arrested.
   Army officials said further arrests were expected.
   ``This is just the tip of the iceberg,'' said Col. Renaan
Gissin, a deputy army spokesman. ``The last word has not been
said.''
   He described the number of people involved as unprecedented.
   Jewish men and women are drafted at age 18 in Israel, whose
population is 4.1 million. Men serve for three years, followed by
62 days of reserve duty each year until age 55. Women serve two
years, with no obligatory reserve duty.
   Avoiding service is a social taboo and many employers ask
applicants to prove they did army service.
   Israel has virtually no conscientious objectors and fewer than
300 people have refused to serve in controversial operations in
Lebanon or the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip during the last
decade.

   Michael Dukakis told a major Jewish
organization Wednesday that George Bush supported arms sales to
Arab nations, and the Democratic presidential nominee promised he
would ``say `no' to Arab shopping lists that endanger the security
of Israel.''
   ``Lloyd Bentsen and I will never play politics with Israel's
security,'' the Democratic presidential nominee said, referring to
his running mate.
   Dukakis spoke to the annual international convention of B'nai
Brith, an organization that works for Jewish causes.
   Dukakis pledged support for Israel and said Republican vice
presidential nominee Dan Quayle ``has voted repeatedly against
foreign assistance to Israel.''
   Dukakis promised he would ``never recognize a unilateral
declaration of a Palestinian state or government in exile.''
   ``We will not sell weapons that would threaten the security of
Israel to any nation,'' he said.
   ``The Republicans have sold AWACS (planes) to Saudi Arabia,
Mavericks (missiles) to Kuwait, Stingers (missiles) to Bahrain and
billions of additional dollars worth of sophisticated arms to Arab
countries that refuse to make peace with Israel,'' Dukakis said.
   ``George Bush has supported those sales, and Dan Quayle has
voted for them. Lloyd Bentsen and I are going to say `no' to Arab
shopping lists that endanger the security of Israel,'' he said.
   Dukakis also referred to President Reagan's trip to a German
graveyard where Nazi SS troops were buried. ``There will be no
trips to Bitburg,'' Dukakis said.
   Earlier in New Jersey, Dukakis said Bush stood silent while the
Reagan administration tried ``to slam the door of college
opportunity'' for young people. The Democratic nominee proposed his
own broad loan program aimed at middle-class students.
   ``Where was George?'' Dukakis said, renewing the Democrats' cry
at the national convention in Atlanta in July. ``George was right
there, all the time, not doing and not saying a thing,'' he said.
   Dukakis, in a speech at Kean College in Union, N.J., outlined
his proposal for a college loan program aimed at making a higher
education more affordable for the children of middle-income
families.
   The program would provide federal guarantees to back bank loans
to college students in return for the student's agreement to repay
the loan with payment withheld automatically from their future
earnings.
   As described by his advisers, students would agree to repayment
plans based on a percentage of their earnings _ with payments
extending for the rest of their working lives. The percentage of
income withheld would depend on how much money was borrowed, said
Larry Summers, a Harvard economist and adviser to Dukakis.
   Aides said the program would add no net cost to the federal
government.
   Bush has proposed allowing parents to earn interest tax-free on
U.S. savings bonds to help pay for college, but he has not
suggested any overhaul of the loan program.
   But the Reagan administration has already launched a small,
experimental income-contingent loan program, with repayments pegged
to students' income in later life. Congress balked last year at a
major expansion of the program, now being tried at 10 campuses.
   Loye Miller, a spokesman for Secretary of Education William
Bennett, said the Dukakis proposal ``sounds like they're stealing
our idea.''
   Later Bennett issued a statement saying, ``Somebody already laid
this egg. We have not seen all the details, but the Dukakis
proposal looks suspiciously like the old Yale University plan that
proved unworkable a decade ago.''
   The plan, according to Miller, failed because students who
anticipated high incomes did not want to end up subsidizing the
loans of their lower-income colleagues.
   Dukakis said the opportunity to attend college is fading in the
face of higher tuitions and stagnating wages. He said college
tuitions have incresed 60 percent under the Reagan administration.
   The Massachusetts governor said scholarship assistance had
quadrupled in his state under his leadership, but that the Reagan
administration has cut college loans, grants and work-study
programs.
   ``And where was George Bush while his administration was doing
its best to slam the door of college opportunity in the face of
millions of young people across the country,'' Dukakis said.
``Where was he while his administration was denying middle income
families the hope for a future of prosperity and success for their
children?''

<HEAD>Former State Official Pleads Guilty To Misdemeanor In Potato

<TEXT>
   A former state administrator pleaded
guilty Wednesday to a misdemeanor charge and avoided going on trial
for bribery in connection with a 2-year-old scandal over a failed
potato sale to Honduras.
   Laurence McMerty, the state Agriculture Department's former
marketing director, pleaded guilty to unlawful compensation for
assistance in a government matter, a charge punishable by up to one
year in jail and a $1,000 fine.
   McMerty, 43, was accused of accepting a Caribbean cruise and up
to $4,000 in cash from a Miami agent, William Messner, who acted as
a middleman in the potato deal.
   Prosecutors dropped felony bribery charges in exchange for the
guilty plea, in which McMerty admitted accepting $3,200 in cash,
which he claims was reimbursement for expenses.
   Jury selection had started in state district court Wednesday
morning for McMerty's trial on the bribery charges. If convicted,
he faced up to 10 years in prison.
   ``I am confident and comfortable justice has been served,''
Deputy Attorney General Bruce Quick said after McMerty entered the
plea Wednesday.
   Messner pleaded guilty July 8 to bribery as part of a plea
agreement that requires him to pay $60,888 in restitution to the
state. Messner, who also was placed on probation, was in jail for
six months prior to the plea.
   McMerty claimed Wednesday's guilty plea exonerated him of any
serious wrongdoing in connection with the potato scandal, which
already had tarnished the career of state Agriculture Commissioner
Kent Jones.
   ``There is no implication of bribery. There is no implication I
did anything to harm the state in any way,'' McMerty said in a
telephone interview from his home.
   McMerty acknowledged Wednesday that he received $3,200 from
Messner's company, Petrolear Holdings Ltd., but he said he believed
he was entitled to the money as reimbursement for expenses he
incurred in 1985 while trying to set up the potato sale.
   McMerty claimed that costs were built into the eventual potato
sale so he could be reimbursed for the 1985 trip to Central
America. McMerty has maintained that he reimbursed Messner for the
cruise, which was not involved in the misdemeanor charge to which
he pleaded guilty Wednesday.
   The state offered McMerty basically the same plea agreement last
November, Quick said.
   No date for McMerty's sentencing was set.
   The potato sale soured in August 1986 after the financial
arrangements came to the attention of Attorney General Nicholas
Spaeth.
   Messner secured from the state $1.85 million in notes that
Spaeth says were issued without authority by Jones and former Bank
of North Dakota President Herbert Thorndal. Messner returned a
$1.55 million note after Spaeth disclosed the deal but he had
already discounted and sold a $300,000 note.
   The state is still owed $104,000 for 400,000 pounds of seed
potatoes that were shipped to Honduras before the deal fell through.

<HEAD>Study Finds No Discrimination In Executive Suites</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A study of business graduates has found no
evidence of widespread discrimination against Jews in the executive
suite, and says their pay actually increased faster than that of
Christians.
   The study, released Wednesday by the American Jewish Committee,
tracked the careers of 444 men and women who received master of
business administration degrees in 1974 or 1979 from Harvard
University, Columbia University or Drexel University.
   The study found:
   _Five to 10 years after starting out as junior executives, 83
percent of the Jews held administrative positions, compared with 69
percent of Protestants and 53 percent of Catholics.
   _Jews had average salaries of about $111,000, compared with
$83,000 for Protestants and $82,000 for Catholics, partly because
Jews tended more often to go into commerce rather than
manufacturing and service, where salaries tend to be lower. Between
the time of their graduation and the time of the survey, Jews had
average annual raises roughly double those of Christians, the
survey said.
   _Nearly two-thirds of the Jewish MBAs identified Christians as
their corporate mentors.
   The study found that half the Jewish MBAs could not read Hebrew
letters, and ``ritual observance, on the average, did not extend
much beyond attendance at a (Passover) Seder and lighting candles
on Hanukkah. At the same time, a majority participated in Christmas
observances, with a not-insignificant number having Christmas trees
in their homes.''
   The coordinator of the project, Murray Friedman, director of the
committee's Middle Atlantic States region and acting chairman of
the U.S. Civil Rights Commission, said however that that despite
Jewish gains in recent years, ``discrimination has not disappeared,
nor are all businesses and economic sectors fully open to Jews.''
   Friedman said in Philadelphia, for example, some business areas
``employ Jews at the higher levels mainly in specialized areas like
public relations and law.''
   ``Sudden shifts in the American economy or the political climate
could reverse the gains that have been made,'' he added.

<DATELINE>QALQILYA, Occupied West Bank (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Israeli troops blockaded
Qalqilya for a second day Wednesday, turning the town zoo into an
army base, and helicopters circled overhead searching olive groves
for Palestinian stone-throwers.
   Also Wednesday, three Palestinians, including two 16-year-olds,
were wounded in stone-throwing confrontations with troops near the
West Bank town of Nablus, about 12 miles east of Qalqilya, hospital
officials said.
   Except for dozens of soldiers patrolling the streets, Qalqilya
was a virtual ghost town one day after the army swept in and
arrested more than 150 Arabs as part of a new tactic to quell the
9-month-old Palestinian rebellion.
   By Wednesday night, more than 200 Qalqilya residents were in
custody, Israel radio said. It said without elaborating that the
detainees included members of several gangs that had hurled
firebombs at Israeli cars.
   ``We have no illusions this measure will stop rock throwing and
firebombing,'' Col. Ranaan Gissin told reporters during an escorted
tour of Qalqilya. ``This measure ... is to send a deterrent message
to the people.''
   Gissin, the army's deputy spokesman, said the town, where troops
have cut telephone lines and blocked all entrances, would remain
under curfew for at least several more days.
   The town and surrounding areas also under curfew are home to
about 35,000 Palestinians.
   On Wednesday, Israeli settlers who live in the area were
permitted to drive through Qalqilya's deserted streets to their
homes.
   During a two-hour tour of Qalqilya, reporters saw two
Palestinians, handcuffed and blindfolded, being transported by jeep
to interrogation in makeshift army bases set up at a local high
school and the town zoo.
   Dozens of troops, some wearing shielded helmets and others
carrying clubs and automatic weapons, patrolled the narrow streets
on foot and in jeeps.
   Several Arabs complained that during house-to-house searches for
suspected rioters the army broke into homes and damaged property.
One Palestinian man pointed to a broken lock and smashed windows in
his home.
   Some residents watched troops from their windows and rooftops. A
small child was seen flying a kite from a rooftop, and remnants of
other kites hung from electrical wires.
   An elderly Arab man emerged on another rooftop where he yelled
at troops, claiming they were calling Arabs profane names.
   ``Is this what you learned in the army? You should be ashamed of
yourself,'' the man, who was surrounded by several children,
shouted in Hebrew.
   On the street below, one soldier was heard saying to another:
``We'll deal with this guy later.''
   Many of the Palestinians arrested belonged to the outlawed PLO
youth group, Shabiba, the army said. It said they were suspected of
throwing stones and firebombs at Israeli cars, or participating in
riots.
   ``The chopper overhead is to locate Palestinian squads who have
escaped into the orchards,'' Gissin said. ``When we see them, we
pick them up.''
   Besides uncovering caches of knives and axes, troops also found
a workshop for making nail-studded iron pieces, called ``ninjas,''
for puncturing the tires of passing cars.
   Gissin said Qalqilya, 1.5 miles from Tel Aviv's northern
suburbs, became a particular problem because hundreds of vehicles
from nearby Jewish settlements and Israeli cities pass through the
town everyday.
   Qalqilya is one of the largest West Bank towns near Tel Aviv.
One soldier accompanying the tour pointed to a hilltop in the town
from where he said Jordanian troops fired the only shell to hit Tel
Aviv during the 1967 Middle East War.
   Also Wednesday, police said a 25-year-old West Bank Palestinian
confessed to last month's killing of an 18-year-old Israeli woman,
Ziva Goldovsky.
   The suspect, a friend of the victim, said he killed her for
nationalist motives after Ms. Goldovsky refused to give him a
pistol, police investigator Uri Weisskoop told Israel radio.
   She was the fifth Israeli to die in the Palestinian uprising,
which has claimed the lives of at least 259 Palestinians.
   Troops lifted a 13-day curfew from the West Bank village of Bani
Naim, near Bethlehem. During the closure, Arab residents said
troops confiscated about 150 cars in an effort to force
Palestinians to pay their taxes.
   Underground leaflets have called on Arabs to refrain from paying
taxes to the Israeli military government.

   The commander of a Soviet space capsule stranded
in space for a day may have worsened equipment problems by not
taking manual control, the government newspaper suggested Wednesday
after the Soyuz TM-5 landed safely.
   The government daily Izvestia said reporters questioned deputy
flight chief Viktor Blagov of the Soviet space program, on whether
the commander, Vladimir Lyakhov, made mistakes Tuesday during
attempts to fire braking rockets aboard his Soyuz TM-5 capsule.
   The tiny capsule parachuted to a landing at 4:50 a.m. Wednesday,
Moscow time, 100 miles southeast of Dzhezkazgan in the Kazakhstan
republic of Soviet Central Asia.
   Despite a problem with the guidance system, the spacecraft
landed within only a few dozen miles of the intended target and
only 24 hours late, Izvestia reported.
   An American expert on Soviet space flight said the two
cosmonauts might have burned to death if the unexpected shutdown of
their rocket engine had come only a minute later.
   ``They were seconds away from death,'' James Oberg, a space
engineer and author of several books on the Soviet space program,
said from Johnson Space Center in Houston. ``The cutoff of that
burn (rocket firing) was lucky for them.''
   Another U.S. space expert, Nicholas Johnson, said he believes
the situation was much less serious than problems encountered in
earlier Soviet flights.
   Johnson said it is too early to make assumptions that the
cosmonauts were near mortal danger and suggested that Oberg was
drawing conclusions ``with inadequate data.'' Johnson works for
Teledyne Brown Engineering in Colorado Springs, Colo., a major
space contractor.
   Television showed the spherical Soyuz capsule floating toward
the ground on a white parachute with orange stripes againt a
reddish dawn sky. A puff of dust rose from the ground when the
capsule landed.
   Abdul Ahad Mohmand, the first Afghan in space, and Soviet
crewmate Lyakhov spent 26 hours aboard the cramped capsule that had
enough air for only two days, dwindling food supplies and no toilet.
   ``Of course it was not an easy thing to sit in spacesuits for 24
hours,'' Lyakhov, 47, said in an interview near the charred capsule.
   The problems began after the capsule undocked early Tuesday from
Mir, the space station where Lyakhov and Mohmand spent six days
with three other cosmonauts.
   After boarding their capsule and undocking, the cosmonauts made
two attempts to re-enter the atmosphere on Tuesday.
   Izvestia quoted Blagov as giving a philosophical answer to
reporters asking whether technical problems or mistakes by mission
control or the capsule crew were to blame for the landing delay.
   ``Life is guilty, a coincidence of circumstances,'' Blagov said.
   Izvestia said Tuesday's first landing attempt was aborted when
an infrared sensor used in guiding the spacecraft malfunctioned.
The sensor locked onto the wrong tracking reference point and
belatedly started an engine that slows the craft for re-entry. The
cosmonauts manually overrode the system and shut down the engine,
the newspaper said.
   A second attempt was made three hours later. The sensor put the
craft in the correct position, but an on-board computer then used
an old trajectory program and an engine burn was incomplete. The
old program had been in the computer since the Soyuz TM-5's last
flight, with a Soviet-Bulgarian crew in June, according to Izvestia.
   The newspaper then listed a question and comment it said
reporters put to Blagov:
   ``Why, with this, did the commander, instead of turning off the
computer and completely transferring to a manual control regime,
again give a command to the machine which could not be corrected,
for the continued working of the engine?
   ``And only when the engine was shut off by an indication of a
loss of ship stabilization did he do what he should have done from
the very beginning: stop the dynamic operation and wait for
communication with the control center, to report about the
situation.''
   Izvestia did not say whether Blagov responded specifically to
these comments, but quoted him as saying: ``We still must
painstakingly study the whole situation.''
   The public questioning of a cosmonaut's performance was highly
unusual in the Soviet space program. It reflected the more open
discussion of problems encouraged by Soviet leader Mikhail S.
Gorbachev under his policy of ``glasnost.''
   Other Soviet space officials steered away from mentioning
possible human error in the mission.
   Asked in an interview on state-run television to evaluate the
crew's performance, Blagov's boss, veteran cosmonaut Valery Ryumin,
responded: ``We consider that the crew worked well.''
   Lyakhov said he and Mohmand had wanted to make a third attempt
at landing on Tuesday, but refrained from making it because the
craft might have touched down outside Soviet territory. He said
they preferred to wait until landing could be assured in Kazakhstan.
   After a sleepless night for the cosmonauts and scientists at
mission control who corrected the problems, the capsule attempted a
third _ and this time successful _ reentry on Wednesday.
   ``We are expecting the opening of the parachute,'' Lyakhov, a
veteran military pilot, told mission control during reentry.
   ``We wish you a successful landing!'' a ground controller said.
   ``It's as if we're now racing along a cobblestone road,''
Lyakhov added.
   Then, he reported: ``There is the opening of the main
parachute.''
   After speaking to reporters at the landing site, the cosmonauts
were flown to the nearby Baikonur space center, where doctors
pronounced them ``in good health and spirits,'' Radio Moscow said.
   Izvestia said the mission ``could be ranked as one of the most
dramatic in the history of cosmonautics.''
   Speaking to reporters after landing, Lyakhov, a veteran of two
long space flights, did not admit to any mistakes.
   ``There was no danger on the ship. We kept the situation under
control,'' he said.

<HEAD>Teacher Walkouts Affect Schools In Five States</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Teacher strikes in six states disrupted classes for 110,000
students Wednesday, but schools in Louisiana and Michigan reopened
when teachers reached agreement on contracts.
   Many of the teachers on strike in 26 public school districts in
Michigan, Pennsylvania, Massachusetts, New Jersey, Illinois and
Ohio were holding out for raises.
   ``We are doing this because we are the lowest paid teachers in
the whole area and we have been for many years,'' said Lowell,
Mass., teacher Coe Kevghas as he picketed in front of the Rogers
School Wednesday. ``We don't want to strike but we are forced to
strike. Veteran teachers earn less than rookie police and firemen.
Why?''
   A settlement was signed Tuesday night in southwest Louisiana's
Vermilion Parish after officials agreed to collective bargaining
with the Vermilion Association of Educators representing 600
teachers, cafeteria workers and school bus drivers. The teachers
had been on strike for three weeks.
   ``We're very happy. We're going back to school and I think we'll
have a better educational system,'' association President Betty
Girouard said.
   In Michigan, teachers in Fenton ended their one-day strike,
pending ratification of a three-year contract. Terms were
unavailable. Teachers returned to classrooms in the 2,800-student
district.
   Elsewhere in the state, walkouts continued in at least nine
public school districts.
   Strikes continued Wednesday in Garden City, Napolean, Michigan
Center, Holland, Manistee, Baraga, Stockbridge, Pontiac and West
Ottawa school districts.
   More than 1,400 professors and academic staff members at Wayne
State University in Detroit went on strike Tuesday over union work
rules and salary.
   About 950 clerical workers and secretaries represented by the
United Auto Workers have been on strike there since Aug. 25.
   In Peabody, Mass., school officials canceled Friday classes. The
city's 408 teachers on Tuesday rejected a 17 percent wage increase
over three years, holding out for 42 percent.
   ``To sit at the table locked in at 42 percent is totally
irresponsible,'' said Mayor Peter Torigian.
   Bert Latessa of the Massachusetts Federation of Teachers
defended the union's position. The 42 percent wage request, Latessa
said, is smaller than it appears because the teachers maintain they
have been performing extra duties such as handling oversized
classes without extra pay.
   Elsewhere in the state, Lowell's 970 teachers voted unanimously
Tuesday to stay off the job because of dissatisfaction with a
proposed salary package. The first day of school Wednesday was
canceled for the city's 13,100 students.
   Teachers are seeking higher pay and longevity bonuses.
   Teacher strikes are illegal in Massachusetts, and the state
Labor Relations Commission on Wednesday declared Peabody's strike
illegal and ordered teachers back to work. The move was a
relatively routine step designed to set the contract negotiation
process in motion.
   Around Massachusetts, teachers in 35 communities were still
without contracts Wednesday as classes began.
   Sixty substitutes replaced striking teachers in Blue Ridge,
Ill., allowing schools to open, while negotiators in Granite City
headed for the bargaining table in the state's only other teachers'
strike.
   Granite City's 444 teachers walked off their jobs Tuesday,
idling 8,200 students in the district's 12 schools. School started
Aug. 25. Teachers voted last Thursday to reject the board's offer
of a 4 percent pay raise. The union has asked for a two-year
contract with salary increases of 10 percent this year and 10
percent next year, Superintendent Gilbert Walmsley said.
   Here is a brief summary of teacher strikes elsewhere:
   New Jersey: A union representing about 130 teachers, custodians
and clerks at Eastern Regional High School in Voorhees postponed
the first day of school by striking Wednesday after nearly 12 hours
of talks broke down, officials said. The school has 1,450 students.
   Pennsylvania: Strikes by about 2,750 teachers canceled classes
or disrupted teacher preparation days in 10 districts with 43,800
students.
   Ohio: Contract talks involving 357 teachers and support
personnel at five Cleveland schools serving 1,250 handicapped
students will resume at the end of the week, school and union
officials said Wednesday.

   Sailing became the No. 1 spectator sport in San
Diego on Wednesday as the America's Cup got under way and
enthusiasts tried to grab the best viewing spots on land and sea.
   Sailors aboard aircraft carriers and waterfront restaurant
patrons peered through binoculars as the American catamaran Stars &
Stripes and the massive yacht New Zealand moved through San Diego
Bay toward the race starting line.
   The heavily favored U.S. boat, skippered by Dennis Conner, took
an early lead in the first race of the best-of-three series. Stars
& Stripes went on to defeat New Zealand by a margin of 18 minutes,
15 seconds, covering the 40-mile course in 4 hours, 53.54 seconds.
   The next two races are scheduled for Friday and, if needed,
Sunday.
   Conner was the skipper of the yacht that won the America's Cup
back from Australia last year, after losing it to the Aussies in
1983.
   A crowd gathered on a grassy embankment at Embarcadero Marina
Park, site of the America's Cup tourist village, to watch the race
proceedings live on a stadium-sized video screen positioned on a
barge just offshore.
   ``It's going to be fun once we get our Kiwi beer,'' said Chris
Hammonds, 26, of Cambridge, New Zealand, who is on the first leg of
a three-year, round-the-world trip.
   ``I'm not a big sailing fan, but a proud Kiwi (New Zealander),
and we want to make our presence felt,'' he said.
   America's Cup Village organizers had said that the compound
would accomodate up to 70,000 people, but police estimates
indicated only about 3,000 turned out for the start of the first
race, said Officer Ken Winklepleck.
   ``I think there'd have been a larger crowd here if it was a
multinational race with everyone sailing similar boats,'' said Mike
Malcom, 28, of Atlanta. ``But it's still very exciting.''
   Overcast skies cleared to brilliant blue as Stars & Stripes and
the New Zealand began the race at noon Wednesday, after months of
legal skirmishes and harsh words between the competitors.
   Through court action, New Zealand had forced San Diego into an
early defense of the Cup, upsetting San Diego Yacht Club plans for
a multinational event in 1991. San Diego responded by choosing to
sail a catamaran, a first in the Cup's 137-year-old history.
   High-spirited race buffs on spectator boats ranging from tugs to
large yachts cheered and waved at landlubbers as they headed out to
a marked viewing area several miles offshore.
   One boat speeding out of the bay created swells that sent
another craft, which was to carry reporters along the race course,
crashing against a cement dock. The media boat was damaged but no
one was injured.
   ``Get that boat's name!'' a man shouted as the craft sped on.
   Banners, balloons and flags flew from the spectator boats, but
the best decoration was provided by nature: A school of dolphins
leapt skyward as they passed by the American catamaran a few hours
before race start.
   At the America's Cup Village, souvenir vendors were busy selling
T-shirts, pins and other memorabilia. Video monitors stationed
throughout provided race information and features on the two
competitors.
   ``I almost cried when I saw our boat (New Zealand) sail out to
the starting point,'' said Carol MacLeod, 25, of Auckland. ``It was
so big and graceful. It looked good in the water.''
   Fans of the Stars & Stripes cheered loudly as Conner and his
crew waved from their 60-foot catamaran as they made their way to
the starting point, four miles off Point Loma.
   ``This is a great birthday present,'' said Mike Cordell of San
Diego, who turned 33 on Wednesday. An America's Cup fan since 1974,
Cordell said the race would be exciting despite the politics
surrounding it.
   But one disgruntled New Zealander said the contest between the
catamaran and yacht, considered lopsided by sailing experts because
of the cat's speed advantage, reflected poorly on the Americans.
   ``The Stars & Stripes are making the Kiwis look stupid in front
of the Americans, but they're making themselves look like fools in
front of the rest of the world,'' said Tracy Barclay, 23, of
Cambridge, New Zealand.

<TEXT>
   Sikh militants armed with rifles opened
fire inside a commuter train in northern Punjab state Wednesday,
killing 10 Hindus and wounding 15 before escaping when the train
stopped, police said.
   The attack took place as the train approached Rure Assal station
near Taran Tarn, 25 miles south of Amritsar, the Sikh holy city,
said Sanjiv Gupta, senior superintendent of police in Taran Tarn.
   Police posted near the station saw a group of Sikhs running from
the train into wheat fields but were unable to catch them, Gupta
said in an interview.
   After searching the train, police found 10 Hindu passengers dead
and 15 injured, including eight seriously, he said.
   Gupta said AK-47 assault rifles were used in the attack.
   The train departed Amritsar at 6:15 p.m. for Khemkaren, a town
on the India-Pakistan border, 45 miles south of Amritsar, Gupta
said. The victims were employed in Amritsar and commuted by train
to their jobs each day.
   More than 1,870 people have died in violence blamed on Sikh
militants this year, police said.
   Sikh militants have waged a guerrilla campaign for secession
from India since 1982. At least 4,500 people have been killed
during that time.
   Sikhs make up less than 2 percent of India's 800 million people
but form a majority in Punjab state. Militants claim Sikhs are
discriminated against by the majority Hindus and want to form an
independent Sikh state within Punjab.

<TEXT>
   Tropical Storm Florence formed off Mexico's Yucatan
Peninsula Wednesday and began drifting eastward in the southern
Gulf of Mexico but posed no immediate threat to land, hurricane
forecasters said.
   An Air Force reconnaissance plane measured Florence's top winds
at 55 mph at 7:30 p.m. EDT as the storm swirled over warm Gulf
waters. It was located about 100 miles north of Merida, Mexico,
near latitude 22.6 north and longitude 89.6 west, said the National
Hurricane Center.
   The plane crew reported near-hurricane force squalls near the
storm's center.
   ``Florence could reach hurricane strength within the next 24 to
36 hours,'' forecaster Bob Sheets said in an advisory.
   September and early October are the height of the hurricane
season.
   ``At this time of the year, a hurricane is always a
possibility,'' forecaster Noel Risynchok said. Air Force
reconnaissance planes will check the storm regularly, he said.
   Forecasters said steering currents around the storm remained
weak Wednesday evening, and they had no idea where the storm might
head once it strengthens.
   ``It's out in the open waters of the gulf right now,'' Risynchok
said. ``The only current threat would be to marine interests.''
   Florence is the sixth named storm of the 1988 Atlantic Hurricane
season. Only Debby, which struck Mexico's Gulf Coast, had wind
strengthen to more than 74 mph, making it a hurricane.

<HEAD>PLO Chiefs To Meet On Provisional Palestine State Plan</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN RICE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A senior PLO official said Wednesday the
group's executive panel will meet this week prior to a conference
whose main topic is creation of a provisional government for an
indepandent Palestinian state.
   Yasser Abed-Rabbo, a member of the Palestine Liberation
Organization's executive committee, said the meeting Saturday in
Tunis will consider proposals to be placed before an emergency
session of the Palestine National Council, the Palestinians'
parliament-in-exile.
   A planned mid-September meeting by the council was postponed
while PLO leaders sought international recognition for a
provisional Palestinian government. Sources say the council
probably will meet next month in Algiers.
   Support for the PLO to proclaim a provisional government has
increased since Palestinians in the Israel-held West Bank and Gaza
Strip began their uprising Dec. 8. More than 280 Palestinians and
five Israelis have died.
   The continuing protests against Israeli rule have bolstered the
PLO's flagging fortunes, with many figures within the PLO urging
declaration of an independent state in the occupied territories.
   Jordan's King Hussein decided July 31 to sever Amman's legal and
administrative links with the West Bank, adding to the pressure on
the PLO by challenging it to assume responsibility for the occupied
region and live up to its claim to be the Palestinians' sole
representative.
   A top Arafat lieutenant, Salah Khalaf, was quoted by Kuwait's
Al-Anbaa daily Wednesday as calling on the PLO to take the
``historic ... realistic political decision'' of declaring an
independent state soon.
   ``We have no option but to take a key step that responds to the
dictates of the Palestinian uprising and its continuation, Jordan's
legal and administrative disassociation with the West Bank and the
international detente which envisages solutions to regional
problems,'' he said.
   Israeli officials have refused to deal with the PLO, calling it
a terrorist organization. Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir has also
vowed to wreck PLO plans for a provisional government or a
Palestinian state.
   The United States also refuses to deal with the PLO until it
accepts U.N. Security Council Resolution 242, which implies
recognition for Israel's right to exist.
   Abed-Rabbo said he expected the national council to issue a
``policy declaration which ... would be based on international
legality, beginning with (U.N. Security Council) Resolution 181 and
ending with 242.''
   Resolution 181 established the state of Israel, but also called
for a Palestinian state.
   Israel has already annexed part of the Arab land captured from
Jordan and Egypt in 1967 where the PLO hopes to create its state.
Israeli critics have also complained that the 1948 partition
resolution calls for giving up part of pre-1967 Israel as well.

   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir suggested
Wednesday that Washington is meddling in Israeli affairs by
inviting Foreign Minister Shimon Peres, his political rival, to a
Mideast peace summit one month before Israel's election.
   Israeli Foreign Ministry officials confirmed that President
Reagan will act as host at a meeting between Peres and Foreign
Minister Esmat Abdel Meguid of Egypt to discuss the peace process.
   U.S. and diplomatic sources in Washington said the meeting will
take place Sept. 26 in New York. Israel's general election will be
held Nov. 1, and voters in the United States go to the polls on
Nov. 8.
   Both Shamir's right-wing Likud bloc and Peres' left-of-center
Labor Party have billed the voting as a historic referendum on how
to solve the Arab-Israeli conflict and deal with the 9-month-old
Palestinian uprising in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   Labor backs the U.S. Middle East peace plan, which calls for the
return of land for peace and negotiations in the framework of an
international peace conference. Likud opposes key elements of the
U.S. plan, ruling out the return of occupied lands and favoring
direct talks on limited Palestinian autonomy.
   Reacting to the news of Reagan's move, Shamir said: ``At this
hour, I still don't have all the details on the meeting. I will
just say one thing. We must not forget that we are on the eve of
elections.''
   Senior Likud officials went further in their criticism.
   ``This is a bad joke,'' said Uri Oren, political adviser to
Deputy Prime Minister David Levy of Likud. ``It is astonishing
evidence of improper policy, both external and internal.''
   ``Everybody understands that such a meeting cannot advance any
political process several weeks'' before the election, he told The
Associated Press.
   Likud officials also accused Peres of acting behind Shamir's
back by not informing the prime minister of the invitation which
was conveyed to senior Israeli officials in Washington on Tuesday.
   But Peres said he only found out about the proposed meeting from
journalists on Wednesday. ``I'm surprised by this. I didn't know
about it,'' he told Israel radio in an interview.
   Peres welcomed the new U.S. initiative and rejected charges that
it was aimed at boosting Labor, which is slightly trailing Likud
and its potential coalition partners in the latest polls.
   ``I don't see a reason that just because we are on the eve of
elections, we have to stop working for the advancement of the peace
process,'' Peres said.
   Peres is scheduled to leave for New York on Sept. 22 to attend
the annual session of the U.N. General Assembly. During the visit,
he said he would meet with foreign ministers of nations playing a
role in the Middle East conflict.
   Secretary of State George Shultz sought support for the U.S.
peace plan during four shuttles to the region this year, but failed
to win backing from most regional leaders. Egypt was the only Arab
state to endorse the plan.

<HEAD>`Doomsday' Plan Put In Effect As City Faces $1 Million-A-Day Fines</HEAD>
<DATELINE>YONKERS, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The city of Yonkers, which faces $1
million-a-day fines starting Friday, will begin laying off hundreds
of employees as part of a ``doomsday plan'' to delay bankruptcy,
state officials said Wednesday.
   The fines stem from the City Council's refusal to approve a
housing desegregation plan ordered by a federal judge.
   Under the spending-reduction plan approved by the state
Emergency Financial Control Board, the city Parks Department and
public library will shut down Saturday; the Planning Department
will virtually close, with just two employees staying on; and $3.7
million in employee fringe benefits will be cut.
   A total of $20 million will be saved under this phase of the
plan, said Secretary of State Gail S. Shaffer, the chairman of the
control board. The layoffs of 447 employees Saturday also will come
from the departments of real estate, civil service, fiscal services
and public works.
   Other belt-tightening measures will kick in over the next few
months if needed, allowing the city to continue to operate until at
least next year, Shaffer said.
   ``The thrust of this plan is to preserve the most important
services as long as possible,'' Shaffer said. ``We're making some
fairly painful choices, but the accelerated cuts will stretch out
police, fire and public safety services.''
   The control board ruling infuriated City Councilman Edward
Fagan, one of four council members who have blocked approval of the
desegregation plan.
   ``It eliminates people we would need. ... There's no concern in
terms of employees' rights,'' Fagan said after storming out of the
meeting.
   U.S. District Judge Leonard Sand ruled in 1985 the city had
segregated housing and education for 40 years. The city's schools
were desegregated under a plan approved by Sand, and the City
Council agreed in January to develop 1,000 units of low- and
moderate-income housing designed to promote integration.
   But Fagan and Councilmen Peter Chema, Henry Spallone and
Nicholas Longo voted Aug. 1 to block the second portion of the
plan. In response, Sand levied escalating fines against the city _
$100 for the first day and doubling every day after that.
   Sand also imposed personal fines against the four councilmen and
threatened them with jail.
   The penalties were stayed pending appeal. Last week, the U.S.
Supreme Court reinstated the fines against the city, with a cap of
$1 million a day. The court upheld the stay of the councilmen's
punishment.
   City officials have said the fines would bankrupt the city by
Thanksgiving. Gov. Mario Cuomo said Wednesday that as long as the
U.S. Supreme Court was considering the case, he would not begin
proceedings to remove the four councilmen.
   Spallone, appearing Wednesday on the syndicated ``Donahue'' TV
show, suggested the city might refuse to pay its fines.
   ``I'm going to have to vote on the transfer of funds to pay the
fines. And I'm saying this publicly, I'm not voting for it,''
Spallone said. ``I'll never surrender the vote of the people.''
   The City Council was scheduled to meet Thursday to vote again on
Sand's order.

<HEAD>Angola, South Africa Resume Talks Amid Reports More Cubans Sent To
Angola</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BRAZZAVILLE, Congo (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Angolan-South African peace talks
resumed Wednesday with South Africa stopping just short of accusing
Angola of violating a month-old cease-fire. At issue are claims
Cuba sent 10,000 more soldiers to Angola, bringing its force to
60,000.
   South African President P.W. Botha, speaking in South Africa,
said, ``If the recent reports of a further large-scale buildup of
Cuban troops and armaments in Angola are correct _ we will have to
make sure of that _ then it is a breach of the principles agreed to
in New York and of the provisions of the Geneva protocol.''
   Angola has denied the Cuban force has been augmented. Officials
of the Cuban delegation, which joined in the U.S.-mediated talks,
also denied the report.
   The Cubans help Angola in its fight against anti-Marxist
guerrillas and also in blocking South African military incursions.
   U.S. sources in Washington first made the claim of Cuban
reinforcements, but the State Department subsequently said it
continued to estimate there were 50,000 Cubans in Angola.
   Guerrilla leader Jonas Savimbi took up the claim in a news
conference last week and said U.S. diplomats tried to persuade him
to accept an agreement that would allow the Cubans three years to
withdraw their forces.
   Savimbi's Union for the Total Independence of Angola, or UNITA,
which receives support from South Africa and the United States, has
been fighting the Marxist government since Portugal granted Angola
independence in 1975.
   The Cuban withdrawal issue remains the main stumbling block.
Negotiations were adjourned last week to give the four parties a
chance to review their positions.
   South Africa, which says it has withdrawn its forces from
Angola, has insisted the Cubans be withdrawn within one year. It
has said it will grant independence to South-West Africa, or
Namibia, if the Cubans withdraw. Angola initially said it would
take four years for the Cuban withdrawal, though it apparently has
offered to send them home in three years.
   In a related development, Savimbi said he would be prepared to
work under Angolan President Eduardo dos Santos, provided
democratic elections are held following any peace agreement, news
reports in Lisbon, Portugal, said Wednesday.
   Savimbi said in an interview in the state-owned daily Diario de
Noticias, ``I am prepared to work under orders of Eduardo dos
Santos. ... I would accept a position of second, third, fourth
place, it doesn't matter to me.''
   The rebel leader added though, ``I set one condition _ that
elections will be realized within a period agreed on by UNITA,
MPLA, FNLA and other patriotic forces.''
   The MPLA is dos Santos' Popular Movement for the Liberation of
Angola. The FNLA, or National Front for the Liberation of Angola
saw its support smashed after a defeat by MPLA troops in 1976.

   A woman who disappeared from Wheaton
College along with her new husband, prompting a nationwide search,
suffered serious injury in a car accident and may be charged with
drunken driving, police said Wednesday.
   Carolyn MacLean Swanson, 22, of Glen Ellyn was reported in
serious condition at Loyola University Medical Center one day after
the collision Tuesday.
   The accident occurred in suburban Wheaton when Mrs. Swanson
apparently tried to pass a car and ran into the back of another
auto that was waiting in a left-turn lane. The driver of the car
she struck, a 16-year-old Wheaton girl, was reported in good
condition at another hospital.
   ``Based on witnesses' statements ... in conjunction with the
accident investigation, charges including driving under the
influence, transportation of open liquor in a motor vehicle and
improper lane usage are pending against Ms. Swanson,'' said a
statement from Wheaton police.
   A blood test at Loyola revealed that Ms. Swanson is pregnant,
officials said.
   Ms. Swanson and Scott Swanson, 23, were secretly married a week
before they disappeared April 2 from the private Christian college.
Their ransacked car was found in a Chicago alley with the engine
running, leading to fears of foul play.
   The couple turned up unharmed July 27 in San Diego, where they
said they had been living under assumed names, pursuing ``perfect
love.''
   On Aug. 31, an Army panel said Swanson, an ROTC cadet until the
disappearance, should be removed from the program and required to
repay more than $16,000 he received for tuition and related
expenses.

<TEXT>
   Three-fourths of Bangladesh was under
water Wednesday, and some aid donors say it is time for long-term
solutions in an impoverished land that becomes a vast flood plain
every monsoon season.
   ``We have started thinking about the focus of our development
aid,'' a diplomat from one industrial nation said privately. ``It
doesn't really make sense to pour millions into this country every
year and see it washed away.''
   Floods began in June with the annual monsoon season. They have
claimed 416 lives by the government's count, which is considered
low, and 1,267 on the basis of unofficial tabulations by Dhaka
newspapers.
   The government said Wednesday night all major rivers remained
above flood stage but that water levels fell during the previous 24
hours in all rivers except two small tributaries near the Bay of
Bengal.
   But people still were marooned on rooftops and scarce patches of
high ground, and as many as one-quarter of the nation's 110 million
citizens were homeless.
   Wells and pumps have been submerged and people have begun
drinking flood water, causing a rise in diarrhea cases and fear of
epidemics.
   On Wednesday night, the health service reported 16,813 new cases
of diarrhea in the previous 24 hours, bringing known cases in the
past two weeks to 119,882. Eighty-three of those people have died
and are included in the official death count.
   Statistics come only from areas that can communicate with Dhaka,
however, so the figures probably are low.
   Officials say total damage and reconstration needs cannot be
assessed until the waters recede, but President Hussain Mohammed
Ershad said Tuesday the cost of rebuilding roads and railways alone
would be $156 million.
   Bangladeshi officials, donor nations and international
organizations all say the most pressing need is a regional plan to
stop flood waters that originate outside Bangladesh.
   Water rushes down from the Himalayas each monsoon season in
rivers that empty into the Bay of Bangal through the Bangladesh
delta.
   Ershad and other top Bangladeshi officials emphasize the need to
work with neighboring India and nearby Nepal and Bhutan for a
solution, but a senior U.N. official said he has pushed regional
planning in vain for nearly a decade.
   Until long-term steps are taken, major aid donors say they have
no choice but to help feed the people of Bangladesh, who are among
the world's poorest, and provide medical assistance.
   The United States, for example, is giving Bangladesh $131.5
million in aid this year, including $73 million for food. The rest
is for development assistance, but generally goes for such things
as health, family planning and agricultural research.
   Washington has pledged $3.6 million of flood relief but most
already was in the pipeline as part of the annual aid package.
   American flood relief consists of speeding up delivery of $2.5
million worth of wheat already in Bangladesh for distribution this
year, plus $1.1 million consisting of seed and constributions to
relief funds.
   The International Red Cross appealed for $6 million for the
flood victims. American Red Cross President Richard F. Schubert Jr.
said the funds would be used over the next two months to feed up to
1 million people, clothe up to 100,000 and provide medical relief
and housing for the neediest of families.
   World Vision, an international Christian relief and development
agency based in Monrovia, Calif., appealed for $500,000 for flood
relief aid for Bangladesh.
   Several Bangladeshi officials handling relief said Wednesday
they could not compute the total amount offered from abroad so far.
   A senior U.N. official, whose office helps coordinates foreign
aid, also was unable to provide a total. He said part of the
problem was that much of the aid comes from funds that already had
been allocated for Bangladesh but now is being applied directly to
flood victims.
   ``The figures are changing almost every hour,'' he said,
speaking on condition of anonymity. ``A number of embassies are
exploring what the scope might be and have not yet made a final
commitment.''
   A senior Western diplomat who follows aid donations closely
said, ``People talk about flood control, (but) the major problem
for Bangladesh is overpopulation.''
   Population density in Bangladesh is 2,000 per sqaure mile, the
world's highest after Hong Kong and Singapore.
   While Hong Kong and Singapore are little more than city-states,
however, Bangladesh is an agricultural nation of about 55,000
square miles, roughly the size of Wisconsin.
   Seventy-five percent of its people work in agriculture, working
the rice paddies and jute fields inundated by the floods.

   Wyoming's congressional delegation asked
Interior Secretary Donald Hodel on Wednesday to declare the state a
disaster area because of wildfires in Yellowstone National Park and
surrounding forests.
   U.S. Sen. Malcolm Wallop also called for the resignation of
National Park Service Director William Penn Mott ``for the simple
reason that he continues to find some reason to celebrate this
event while all the rest of us are suffering.''
   Wyoming's congressional delegation disagrees with the Park
Service's policy of allowing fires of natural origin to burn
untended as long as they don't threaten structures or people.
   However, in the last month Yellowstone officials have tried to
suppress all new fires, whether caused by man or nature. But
unusually dry conditions and gusting winds have prevented thousands
of firefighters from gaining control.
   Republicans Wallop and Sen. Alan Simpson, along with Montana
Sens. Max Baucus and John Melcher, met with Hodel in Washington,
D.C., to express their displeasure with the way fires in the
Yellowstone area are being handled.
   In Yellowstone alone, 644,000 of the park's 2.2 million acres
have been charred since late June, while more than 1 million acres
have been blackened in the park and its surrounding national
forests.
   Simpson also pressed the delegations' demands with President
Reagan during a separate meeting.
   A disaster declaration, which would have to come from Reagan,
would make low-interest loans and cash assistance available to
businessmen and homeowners affected by the fires. Wyoming tourism
has fallen off drastically because of the blazes.

   The man who disarmed the Lone Ranger will be
spending lots of time around horses, but he'll be cleaning up after
the animals rather than riding them.
   Edward Louis Young III, convicted of stealing pistols owned by
Jack Carlson ``Clayton'' Moore, was sentenced to spend 600 hours
cleaning up after the horses at the Houston Mounted Patrol's
stables.
   The task could take 2{ years if Young spends 20 hours a month
shoveling manure at the Houston Mounted Patrol's stables.
   Judge Ted Poe said the punishment was fitting for the theft of
the weapons from the hero who's been bringing evil outlaws to
justice on television and in movies for a half-century.
   Poe also sentenced Young on Tuesday to a month in Harris County
Jail and placed him on probation for 10 years.
   Young, a 45-year-old former airline baggage handler, was
convicted of stealing Moore's chrome-plated, twin Colt .45-caliber
revolvers at Houston Intercontinental Airport on Dec. 24, 1986. An
appeals court recently upheld the conviction.
   ``I carry no animosity and I'm certainly a believer in law and
order, and one thing for sure, the Ten Commandments,'' Moore said
Wednesday from his California home. ``And one of those is `Thou
shalt not steal.'''
   Moore was signing autographs the airport when his bags
disappeared.
   Aside from two U.S. Customs inspectors, Young was the only other
person in the baggage area when Moore's luggage and guns were
stolen. Young was apprehended after police traced him as the person
who sold the weapons at a jewelry and gold exchange. He contended
someone had sold him the pistols and holsters for $200 outside a
pawn shop.
   Young's lawyer based his appeal on insufficient evidence and the
fact that Poe let the Lone Ranger wear his sunglasses and white hat
while testifying.
   Poe, who often wears cowboy boots under his judge's robe in
court, said he had no intention of ordering Moore to remove his
trademark hat.
   ``I wasn't about to be the one who revealed the identity of the
Lone Ranger,'' Poe joked. ``Outlaws have been trying to find it out
for years.''

<TEXT>
   E. Robert Wallach, the Edwin Meese III friend
under indictment in the Wedtech bribery case, said Wednesday night
that he was convicted by the news media even before he was indicted.
   Wallach, speaking at an American University forum on the press,
said the First Amendment guarantee of freedom of the press ``does
not give them authority to desecrate the Sixth Amendment right: the
presumption of innocence.''
   The San Francisco lawyer, who goes on trial Jan. 3 in New York
on federal racketeering and conspiracy charges, said he was the
victim of the media and a special prosecutor's investigation whose
purpose ``was to drive Ed Meese from office.''
   ``I became an appropriate ... vehicle to help to accomplish
that. I became a rag doll you chewed,'' said Wallach, who is under
indictment for allegedly taking payoffs from Wedtech officials to
influence Meese, the former White House counselor and attorney
general, and other public officials.
   ``I was convicted before I was indicted. I was convicted by the
American media,'' said Wallach.
   Lyn Nofziger, the former White House political director
appealing his conviction of illegal lobbying his former Reagan
administration colleagues, told the forum that although some
reporters are careless, he received fair coverage at his trial.
   ``You can't point a finger at the profession,'' said Nofziger, a
former reporter.
   Two reporters on the same panel, Ruth Marcus of The Washington
Post and James Polk of NBC News, insisted the press had no power to
indict or convict anyone.
   Polk said Wallach's problems stemmed from his indictment and the
special prosecutor's investigation of Meese, not the media's
reporting of them.
   ``The press is not the legal system. The legal system, to which
Bob Wallach belongs (as a lawyer), ... decides guilt or
innocence,'' said Polk, a Pulitzer Prize-winning investigative
reporter.
   Wallach said the way the press reports indictments makes people
look guilty.
   ``An even mediocre prosecutor can get a grand jury to indict a
ham sandwich. I'm not a sandwich and I'm certainly not a ham
sandwich,'' said Wallach, a law school classmate and longtime
associate of Meese.
   ``I don't think it would change the public perception at all if
we began every story with, `Another presumably innocent man was
indicted today,''' said Polk.
   Polk, however, said he personally feels the press ``has fostered
an assumption of guilt on the part of Bob Wallach before trial.''
He said juries often begin with the assumption that a defendant is
guilty.
   But Marcus, a Harvard-trained lawyer who covers the Justice
Department, said it is the judge's job to ensure that juries set
aside any preconceptions and reach their verdict solely on the
evidence.
   Wallach was also airing his complaints about the media at a news
conference at the National Press Club Thursday.
   Wedtech was the Bronx, N.Y., minority-controlled defense
contractor that collapsed in a bribery scandal in 1986.
   Nofziger is appealing his conviction on three counts of
violating the Ethics in Government Act. He has been sentenced to
three months in jail and a $30,000 fine.

   An ambassador said Wednesday that a
tendency by the non-aligned movement to generate voluminous
resolutions which have little or no impact has robbed the movement
of the influence it once had in the world.
   The criticism came during the opening session of a four-day
conference of foreign ministers from nations that profess
non-alignment, and it was echoed by several other speakers who
called on the movement to review its role.
   Delegations from 92 of the movement's 101 members attended the
meeting, including 70 foreign ministers. The conference is expected
to map out the movement's policies for the rest of the century.
   ``The movement has become a marginal force on the world stage,''
producing many declarations after each meeting ``which appear to
have no impact,'' Singapore's representative, Ambassador Kishore
Mahbubani, said in a speech.
   ``We will have to re-examine carefully the procedures and
practices of the movement that have allowed it to stagnate,'' he
said. ``The central question ... is this: Can we attempt some bold
restructuring ... within the movement to make it once again a vital
force on the world stage?''
   Zimbabwe's foreign minister, Nathan Shamuyaria, said the
movement risks becoming ``ineffective and irrelevant'' if it does
not follow through on its resolutions and streamline its
operations. ``We must ensure that NAM (the movement) is present at
the tables where decisions are taken,'' he said.
   ``Our major problem,'' he added, ``may not only be the volume or
quality of our documents but rather the degree of our faithfulness
in upholding, promoting and defending the positions we adopt by
consensus in those documents.''
   In general, the movement's documents lack concrete proposals for
solutions to the problems they analyze, Shamuyaria said.
   In his keynote address, President George Vassiliou of Cyprus
said the meeting must focus on bolstering the economies of its
members, which include the world's poorest nations.
   Vassiliou told the 800 delegates the meeting was being held ``at
a time of dramatic changes in the international scene ... in an
atmosphere of optimism as a result of several positive political
developments.''
   He mentioned superpower detente and progress toward the
settlement of conflicts in Iran and Iraq, Afhganistan, Angola and
the Western Sahara.
   Nevertheless, he said, ``We note with sadness that the economic
conditions of most developing countries has not improved. In fact
it has deteriorated.''
   The conference will end Saturday.

   The Cabinet on Wednesday approved an increase in the
speed limit on superhighways to 81 mph but voted to retain a new 68
mph limit on holidays.
   The government lowered speed limits in July in an effort to
reduce accidents in holiday traffic.
   Before the summer, the limit for superhighways was 87 mph and
the limit for smaller highways was 68 mph. The superhighway limit
was changed in July to 68 mph and the lower figure to 56 mph. The
Cabinet voted Wednesday to maintain the standard on smaller
highways.
   The lower limits raised protests from West Germany, whose
tourists flock to Italy in the summer.
   The Cabinet also approved a law making use of seat belts
mandatory beginning next year.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rep. Stephen J. Solarz, D-N.Y., said Wednesday
that based on discussions he had recently with Soviet officials in
Moscow, he believes it is possible that the Soviet Union may
eventually remove its historic barriers against people moving
abroad.
   ``I came away with the impression that it is no longer
inconceivable that within a few years you could have something
approaching freedom of emigration for Jews and perhaps other
citizens of the Soviet Union,'' Solarz told reporters.
   During an August visit to the Soviet capital, he said, ``I had
some of the most remarkable discussions I have ever had'' with
Soviet officials who have influence on matters of clearance to
leave the country.
   Solarz added that the officials, whom he declined to identify,
told him that ``continued restrictions on the right of emigration
are in fact inconsistent with glasnost and perestroika'' _ openness
and restructuring, the key reform policies of Soviet leader Mikhail
S. Gorbachev.
   While not saying when it would happen, ``they said they wouldn't
be at all surprised'' if the policies would change in the future,
said Solarz, a member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee.
   ``I was stunned to hear ... Soviet officials talk about this as
a conceivable possibility,'' Solarz said, noting that he had become
accustomed to ``haggling over the fate of each individual'' seeking
to leave the Soviet Union.

   Rebels ambushed a jeep east of Managua
on Wednesday, killing four people and wounding one, the government
said.
   The attack occurred at 7:45 a.m. in Comalapa near Juigalpa, the
capital of Chontales province, 95 miles east of Managua, according
to a statement issued by the Defense Ministry.
   Armando Montoya, political secretary of the ruling Sandinista
National Liberation Front Party in Comalapa, and Danilo Corrales, a
municipal governent finance official, were killed in the attack.
Two Sandinista police officers also were killed and a third was
wounded, the ministry said.
   In another statement, the ministry said 11 rebels were killed
and five wounded in clashes with troops between Aug. 30 and Sept.
6. It said the attacks took place in northern and eastern Nicaragua
but did not say if government forces suffered casualties. The
ministry said rebel forces killed one civilian and wounded two
during that period. It provided no details.
   The leftist Sandinista government and the U.S.-supported rebels,
known as Contras, agreed to a truce in March, but failed to
negotiate an end to the 7-year-old civil war. Talks broke off June
9, and each side has accused the other of violating the truce.

   Firefighters singed the edges of two
small tourist communities Wednesday in a so-far successful effort
to protect the towns from a huge wind-blown forest fire making its
way out of Yellowstone National Park.
   Another blaze, the 5,000-acre Red Bench fire in the state's
northwest corner, swept into Glacier National Park on Wednesday and
destroyed ranger stations before raging through the evacuated
community of Polebridge, on the park's western boundary.
   Gusty wind fanned backfires lighted along a hillside north of
Silver Gate and nearby Cooke City, creating a charred buffer zone
in advance of the main body of the 119,000-acre Storm
Creek-Hellroaring fire.
   Flames from the backfire roared past Silver Gate late Tuesday
night, coming within 200 yards of buildings clustered along the
community's main street before continuing east past Cooke City on
Wednesday.
   The flames, driven by winds up to 35 mph, leaped a safety line
Wednesday and raced five miles east, destroying four remote summer
cabins near a mountain pass.
   Firefighters sprayed foam on buildings in Colter Pass, 2{ miles
east of Cooke City and saved about 40 structures before the heat of
the soaring flames drove them out, said fire official Bob Martines.
   ``Now, with the fuels burned out, at least on this side of the
valley, there won't be anything left to burn,''' said Bill Stalker,
fire information officer.
   However, fire officials remained concerned that winds could
shift and drive the main portion of the fire into dry, unburned
timber south of the canyon towns.
   Survival of the towns was a matter of luck. Driven by wind with
gusts up to 25 mph, flames from the backfire jumped a line at just
the right spot and traveled down the north side of the canyon
rather than through Silver Gate and Cooke City.
   Asked how close the backfire came to structures at Silver Gate
on Tuesday night, fire information officer Dave McMorran replied:
``Zero. It's right up behind the buildings.''
   The only thing between the fires and structures was the initial
fire break itself, which McMorran described as ``one or two
(bulldozer) blades, 10 to 20 feet.''
   Stalker said, ``The blackened areas on the north sides of both
Silver Gate and Cooke City should significantly reduce the danger
of fire slopping over'' from the main blaze, which was still about
a mile from Silver Gate.
   Evacuated residents may complain about the ugly scene of
blackened timber marking the flames' passage, but it would have
burned anyway, he said. Had the main fire been allowed to sweep
into Silver Gate unchecked, ``that would have eaten the whole town
in 15 to 20 minutes,'' Stalker said.
   In Silver Gate, exhausted firefighters slept anywhere they could
find a grassy spot. Some had worked for more than 24 hours,
protecting buildings from the flames that raced by on the hillside.
   The Red Bench fire breeched the western boundary of Glacier Park
on Wednesday, and quickly charred more than 1,000 acres of the
park, burning several vacant cabins and two ranger stations.
   An abrupt wind shift sent the flames south and through the small
evacuated community of Polebridge, said Madelyn Kempf, fire
information officer.
   ``I'm sure there was extensive damage,'' she said. But officials
could not determine the extent since ``we can't send people in
there because of the firestorm conditions'' created by the
fast-moving flames, Kempf added.
   About 100 people live in the forested Polebridge area.
   Two campgrounds in Glacier were evacuated and closed, officials
said.

   Divers worked around the clock
Wednesday on two sunken sections of the Piper Alpha oil rig thought
to contain the bodies of many of the 120 men still missing in the
disaster, officials said.
   The platform's operator, Occidental Petroleum, estimated the two
living-area sections that fell into the North Sea in the July 6
explosion and fire could be lifted from the seabed by the end of
the month.
   ``The harrowing task before us will be a complex operation in
demanding work conditions,'' said John Brading, the company's chief
executive in Britain. ``We will do our utmost to recover as many of
the missing men as we possibly can.''
   In all, 167 men died when the platform exploded into flames
about 120 miles off Scotland. A third living-area module broke up
in the disaster.
   A company spokeswoman, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
18 divers were working in shifts 24 hours a day to prepare the
modules for lifting.
   The two sections found on the ocean floor would be lifted onto a
crane barge and taken to shallow water for inspection, the
spokeswoman said.
   The main module weighs 1,100 tons and is about as high as a
four-story building, she said.
   Occidental said the bodies could not be recovered until the
platform was secured and its 36 wellheads plugged, a process
completed on Monday.

<TEXT>
   The bomb-sniffing dog whose
nostrils give President Reagan's luggage the once-over has been
retired.
   Eight-year-old Arno, the first canine to serve on the Santa
Barbara County Sheriff's Department, served his last day on the
force Tuesday. He now nips at flies and relaxes at the rural home
of Deputy Andrew Stanley.
   ``We hated to see him go,'' Sgt. Eric George said Wednesday.
``But he's got freedom now. He'll be able to get out and move
around a little more now, but he whines and cries when he sees his
handler going to work.''
   Arno was retired because he has an incurable spinal disorder,
said George. ``He's undergone two surgeries but we are worried now
that he could injure himself where it might paralyze him.''
   ``Now, he can live out the rest of his life in relaxation.''
   For six years, Arno has accompanied either George or Stanley on
various assignments: protection, tracking, searching and bomb
detection. Arno was trained with private donations, but has served
a very public function with Reagan regularly vacationing at his
ranch near here.
   ``He's been utilized on bomb sweeps for President Reagan and
Vice President Bush, Geraldine Ferraro and Gary Hart,'' George said.
   Arno also sniffed for bombs during the 1984 Summer Olympics when
events were held at the University of California, Santa Barbara.
   ``No, he never found a bomb,'' the sergeant said, adding:
``Nothing ever exploded after a sweep, so I guess we did OK.''

<HEAD>Questions Raised About Bakker's Mysterious Greek Financiers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The man representing mysterious Greek
financiers who former TV evangelist Jim Bakker says are backing his
$172 million offer to buy PTL has been convicted of fraud, a
television station reported Wednesday.
   WBTV in Charlotte, N.C., said from 1970 through 1981, Louis
Pihakis, who runs International Financial Consultants in Pensacola,
Fla., was arrested or served time for a variety of charges
including fraud, mail fraud, conspiracy, forgery, counterfeiting
and parole violations.
   The station did not say where it got its information. The report
said Pihakis admitted to the station serving eight months in jail
during that time on charges he said were trumped-up.
   Pihakis' home telephone number in Pensacola is unlisted and he
could not be reached for comment.
   Bakker's lawyer, Jim Toms of Hendersonville, N.C., told The
Associated Press in a telephone interview Wednesday night that
neither Bakker nor his lawyers know the identity of the Greek
businessmen.
   He said they are relying on the word of longtime Bakker friend
and Chicago businessman Jerry Sinclair, who led Bakker to Pihakis
and has acted as a middleman between them. Toms described Pihakis
as the U.S. representative for the Greek businessmen.
   Sinclair, who declined to say what his business is but was
identified by Toms as a songwriter, told The Associated Press in a
telephone interview from Fort Mill that he was aware that Pihakis
had a criminal record, but he did not know how extensive it was.
   Sinclair said he has had positive verification, which did not
come through Pihakis, that the Greek money does exist.
   He said Pihakis has paid for any mistakes he may have made in
the past. ``We know him and trust him because he canot afford to
make a mistake,'' Sinclair said.
   ``That's the thing about the Christian ministry that you must
remember, that we're a very forgiving group, that if somebody makes
mistakes we don't mind that,'' Sinclair told the television
station. ``It matters who they are today. You can find a record on
just about anybody. Maybe the record might not be criminal, but you
got a record of sinning.''
   Sinclair said as long as adverse publicity about Pihakis does
not scare away a Midwest bank that has agreed to handle the Greek
funds, the deal to buy PTL's Christian theme park, satellite
television network and real estate should go through in a matter of
days. The bank has not been publicly identified.
   Bakker had said Tuesday he had $2.9 million of $3 million he
needs for a down payment on a $172 million offer he has made to buy
PTL's assets. The Fort Mill-based ministry he left with massive
debts last year after a sex-and-money scandal must sell the assets
as part of a Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization.
   Sinclair said he told bankruptcy trustee M.C. ``Red'' Benton
Tuesday about Pihakis's criminal background after being contacted
by a reporter for WBTV. Sinclair said Benton did not seem overly
concerned.
   Benton, who had set a Thursday deadline for the down payment,
did not return phone calls Wednesday. His secretary said he would
not talk to reporters until Friday, which she said was the earliest
contracts might be signed with Bakker.
   Toms said he was unsure how much money Bakker has raised in his
effort to gather $3 million in cash and pledges. Bakker and his
wife, Tammy Faye, used a direct-mail campaign to ask supporters for
donations, reciting their troubles and offering copies of Mrs.
Bakker's latest gospel album.
   Benton has a deadline of Saturday to present a buyer to U.S.
Bankruptcy Judge Rufus Reynolds, who is based in Greensboro, N.C.
Benton said Tuesday he may present more than one offer to Reynolds.
A $113 million offer from Canadian real estate executive Peter
Thomas is still standing.

<TEXT>
   A giant mudslide smashed
through five villages in a remote mountain area and at least 76
people were feared dead, officials and news reports said Thursday.
   A relief operation was under way but heavy rain and the
isolation of the area was hampering rescuers.
   Papua New Guinea, with a mainly Melanesian population of 3.3
million, is just north of Australia.
   Minister for State John Giheno said the slide occurred Tuesday
morning and swept through Mitsing, Malafan, Zumara and Tari
villages in the mountainous Kaiapit district of Morobe province,
some 185 miles north of Port Moresby, the capital.
   The Australian Associated Press reported a fifth village,
Marafau, was destroyed. It quoted one horrified villager as saying
the mudslide turned Marafau into a mass graveyard, which ``fell
away like a sliced piece of meat.''
   ``It was all over in about five minutes,'' AAP quoted the
witness as saying.
   AAP said many children were orphaned and left homeless by the
slide, which it said covered an area about 12 miles long.
   The news service said children were away at school when the
slide hit.
   Giheno said one body had been recovered and that 615 other
villagers had been accounted for.
   ``At this stage 75 people are missing, presumed dead,'' he said.
   The villages are about 4,950 feet above sea level. Houses in the
area are mainly flimsy traditional grass-thatched structures built
on stilts. Villagers barely make a living by raising pigs and
farming sweet potatoes.
   Giheno flew over the stricken area by helicopter early Thursday
and then launched an emergency appeal for clothing, blankets and
cooking utensils.
   Officials from the National Disaster and Emergency Center were
flying to the area to assess the situation, he said.
   ``Reports indicate the area is still very unstable,'' he said.

   Buddhist societies from Sri Lanka to South Korea, Burma to Tibet
have proved as prone to violence as others in recent times despite
the precepts of Lord Buddha, the great religious teacher of the 5th

   Cambodia, once a land of 90,000 monks in scores of quiet

   In wartime South Vietnam, protesting monks set themselves afire.
More recently, conflict between the majority Sinhalese Buddhists

   A Soviet space capsule floated safely to Earth on
Wednesday after 26 hours stranded in orbit with dwindling air and
food, but a flight control official said the commander delayed the
landing by making mistakes.
   Deputy flight chief Viktor Blagov said commander Vladimir
Lyakhov should have switched to manual controls to fire braking
rockets aboard his Soyuz TM-5 capsule, according to the government
daily Izvestia.
   The tiny capsule parachuted to a landing at 4:50 a.m. Moscow
time 100 miles southeast of the town of Dzhezkazgan in the republic
of Kazakhstan.
   Izvestia, which reported the space-to-ground radio exchange,
noted that despite the earlier problems with the guidance system,
the spacecraft landed within only a few dozen miles of the intended
target, but only 24 hours late.
   Television showed the tiny spherical Soyuz capsule floating
toward the ground on a white parachute with orange stripes againt a
reddish dawn sky. A puff of dust rose from the ground when the
capsule landed.

   The House began Congress' latest assault on
illegal narcotics Wednesday, taking up a 375-page bill that would
spend some $2 billion for every conceivable method of fighting drug
abuse.
   The House will likely labor through next week on the work
product of 11 committees, which might undergo major surgery from
more than three dozen amendments. Some proposed changes will
provide the most controversial moments of debate.
   After a day devoted to debate and explanations of the bill's
provisions, the House postponed votes on amendments until Thursday.
   The House took up the bill on Congress' first day back from a

   A 63-year-old real estate broker,
saying she was middle class ``and the middle class always needs
money,'' stepped forward Wednesday to claim a record world lottery
prize of $55 million.
   The winner, Sheelah Ryan of Winter Springs, said she watched

winning ticket.
   ``I just kept saying `Oh, my God,'' she told a room packed with

   Ms. Ryan said she didn't know what she'd do with her winnings,
but didn't think that finding things to do with the wealth would be
a problem. ``I've always been middle class and the middle class
always needs money,'' she said.
   The first of 20 annual installments of $2,767,361 _ less 20
percent withheld for the Internal Revenue Service _ is due to be
paid to Ms. Ryan next week. She said she didn't know if she'd quit

   The U.S. public health system, largely a
victim of its own success, has eroded to a point where Americans
are at unnecessary risk, a National Academy of Sciences panel said
Wednesday.
   Members of a committee formed by the academy's Institute of
Medicine declined at a news conference to put the blame on any
particular administration or segment of the health community.
   ``I think this is something that has evolved over time,'' said
Bailus Walker Jr., professor of environmental health and toxicology
at State University of New York in Albany and president of the
American Public Health Association.
   Nonetheless, they said the system probably is less equipped to
cope with health emergencies than it was 20 or 30 years ago and
that the first task is to get the public to accept that there is a
problem.

was questioned Wednesday by a prestigious study group which said
the country is fast losing its dominance in many of these fields.
   The Council on Competitiveness, contending that the country has
been far too complacent in the face of growing foreign competition,

schools to reverse the trend.
   ``We cannot afford any further erosion in our once-commanding
technological lead,'' said the report of the council, comprised of
151 top officers of industry, labor and higher education. ``Because
technology is a driving force behind productivity improvements,
export strength and a high standard of living, the stakes are

   Three-fourths of Bangladesh was under
water Wednesday, and some aid donors say it is time for long-term
solutions in an impoverished land that becomes a vast flood plain
every monsoon season.
   ``We have started thinking about the focus of our development
aid,'' a diplomat from one industrial nation said privately. ``It
doesn't really make sense to pour millions into this country every
year and see it washed away.''
   Floods began in June with the annual monsoon season. They have
claimed 416 lives by the government's count, which is considered
low, and 1,267 on the basis of unofficial tabulations by Dhaka
newspapers.
   The government said Wednesday night all major rivers remained
above flood stage but that water levels fell during the previous 24
hours in all rivers except two small tributaries near the Bay of
Bengal.
   But people still were marooned on rooftops and scarce patches of
high ground, and as many as one-quarter of the nation's 110 million
citizens were homeless.

<HEAD>NBC Movie `Shooter' Has Vietnam Photographers in Focus</HEAD>

   Matt Thompson is first and foremost a
``shooter,'' and if the soldier framed in his camera lens dies in
combat _ well, it's going to make a great picture.
   Thompson, clutching his cameras, is tramping through the jungle,
aware of the Viet Cong stalking him and the American soldiers
around him, yet concentrating on getting ``the shot.''
   The shot that's going to amaze his wire service bosses back in
New York. The shot that's going to land on the front page of every
newspaper around the world. The shot that's going to win him the
Pulitzer Prize. The shot that's finally going to spark the job
offer from Life magazine.
   ``I didn't want combat photographers to be overly glamorized,''
said David Hume Kennerly, writer-producer of the NBC movie
``Shooter,'' airing Sunday. ``I wanted to show what it's really
like. The competitive nature. I wanted to show a guy whose purpose
is getting the one great photo to the exclusion of everything else.
He was going to wind up either famous or dead.''
   Kennerly is himself a Pulitzer Prize-winning photographer who
covered Vietnam, a one-time Life magazine staffer and White House
photographer in the Ford administration. In ``Shooter,'' he tells a
compelling story of combat photographers.
   The photographers work for International Press, a fictitious
wire service operating out of a bureau in Saigon.
   The movie has the feel and texture of the real thing. It throbs
with the passion, the cut-throat competition and the pranks of the
photographers. It swings between the dangers of combat to such
humorous episodes as elderly American tourists who keep wandering
into the shooting zones, and the sticky-fingered German
photographer bent on shipping home the national art treasures of
Vietnam.
   One of the photographers' schemes involves the invention of a
phony photo ``stringer'' named Growald. Thompson wants to use the
money paid the non-existent stringer to aid a Vietnam orphanage.
The other shooters, without charity in mind, horn in and start
crediting some of their film to Growald. Soon Growald is the most
talked-about photographer in Vietnam. It ends with an ironic
backfire to Thompson's quest for the Pulitzer Prize.
   Kennerly was co-writer and co-executive producer with Stephen
Kline. Gary Nelson directed the two-hour movie on location in
Thailand. Kennerly had earlier written a book, also called
``Shooter,'' about Vietnam that was heavily illustrated with his
pictures.
   The movie stars Jeffrey Nordling as Matt Thompson, Alan Ruck as
a fellow shooter, Noble Willingham as the bureau chief, plus
Jeffrey Allan Chandler, Helen Hunt, Rosalind Chao, Steven Ford and
Nick Cassavetes.
   ``The movie is autobiographical to a degree,'' Kennerly
admitted. ``Let's say the photographer was based a bit on me. But
this isn't my story in Vietnam. Every character was pulled from
people I knew. Some of me's in the other photographers, too.''
   Kennerly worked for United Press International in Vietnam and
was 25 when he won a Pulitzer in 1972. He joined Life only six
weeks before the publication folded. He then switched to Time and
is still associated with the magazine.
   He got into motion pictures when he enrolled in a two-year
course in directing at the American Film Institute. His student
film, also about a photographer in Vietnam, will be shown this
season on the Arts & Entertainment Network. He also produced the
NBC movie ``The Taking of Flight 847: The Uli Derickson Story.''
   ``Shooter'' was originally conceived for NBC as a series pilot,
but so far the nework has shown no inclination to pick it up.

<HEAD>Premium Bonds: Attractive `Losers'?</HEAD>

   Today's special at your nearby investment firm:
a $1,125 item guaranteed to shrink in value to $1,000 by the time
you cash it in.
   You'll pass, you say? You have enough trouble with unintended
losses in managing your money, without taking any intentional ones?
   But a good many financial advisers suggest that the proposition
in question, known as a premium bond, might merit a closer look for
yield-conscious investors.
   Premium bonds are interest-bearing securities that carry a price
above their face, or redemption value, generally because interest
rates have fallen since the bonds were first sold to the public.
   As rates came down, the bond's price was pushed upward by
traders and dealers in the marketplace to keep its yield at least
roughly competitive with those of new securities being offered at
today's market rates.
   In theory, however, this balancing process might not always be
totally efficient. Premium bonds may at times be available offering
interest income that could more than cover their decline over time
in principal value.
   ``Many investors question the benefit of buying bonds at a
premium, believing that if they hold a premium bond until maturity
they will be taking a loss,'' says the brokerage firm of A.G.
Edwards & Sons Inc. in a report on the subject.
   ``Actually, this is not the case at all when you consider the
bond's total return. The reason to invest in premium bonds is to
achieve higher-than-market income and current yield, with the hope
that these will more than offset the premium price.''
   In addition, Edwards points out, premium bonds can provide some
tax advantages _ even though the rules were tightened by the Tax
Reform Act of 1986.
   Owners of premium bonds issued by corporations or the federal
government can, if they choose, take a tax deduction each year for
the gradual decrease in the principal value of the bonds.
   For securities bought before Oct. 23, 1986, this amortization is
applied as a simple reduction of investment income.
   For purchases made since that date, it is considered an
investment interest expense _ still deductible, but only if you
itemize and only to the extent that you have net investment income
in any given year from capital gains, interest and dividends.
   As long as it falls within these limits, investment interest,
unlike consumer interest for credit purchases, remains 100 percent
deductible.
   Premiums naturally occur, as well, in the market for municipal
bonds issued by state and local governments, which pay interest
that is exempt from federal income tax.
   Because the interest is not taxable, owners of premium
municipals are not allowed to take tax deductions either for
year-by-year amortization of the principal value or for a capital
loss when the bonds mature.
   So municipal bond investors appraise premium bonds in that
market simply on the basis of the total return they offer: Interest
payments minus the annual depreciation in their value.
   Premium bonds, like all other marketable debt securities, are
subject to the constant ebb and flow of interest rates.
   Thus, if you want or need to sell them before maturity, you can
realize a gain or loss independent of the projected decline in a
premium bond's value from the time you buy it.
   And obviously, investing in premium bonds requires some pretty
sharp calculating, or the counsel of a trusted professional adviser
willing to crunch the numbers for you.
   But it also stands to reason that the more investors shy away
from premium bonds, the more potential opportunities they may offer
for those willing to dig for them.

   How do you undo a stalemate? That is the
question, one whose answer eludes our most skilled politicians.
   More accurately, the nation's political leaders evade the issue,
the result being that the job of straightening out American's
finances is sort of a political ghost, felt and even talked about,
but never confronted.
   The problem is this: How do you deal with the fact that
Americans want their social benefits, such as Social Security and
unemployment payments, but are just as certain that they don't want
taxes raised?
   The Conference Board, a business-financed research group that
contracted for a survey on the subject in an effort to puncture the
quandary, came full circle with this conclusion:
   ``While it is widely agreed that the federal deficit should be
significantly reduced, a formidable majority of Americans continue
to oppose any reductions in this nation's social programs.''
   Not all social programs are enthusiastically supported, said
Fabian Linden of the non-profit board. But those that are
enthusiastically supported, he found, tend to be in the big-bucks
area.
   Based on results from 5,000 households, surveyors found four of
five oppose any cuts in Social Security, Medicare and veterans'
benefits, and three in five oppose reductions in health research,
unemployment and child-care benefits.
   The areas favored for reduction involved a far smaller
percentage of the population. Only one-third, for example, said no
cuts should be permitted in food stamps, public housing, welfare
and aid to small businesses.
   The most enthusiasm for cutting was in the foreign aid category,
with 61 percent _ more than double the percentage in any other
category _ recommending large cuts, and only 6.6 percent holding
fast for ``no cuts.''
   More than 50 percent insisted there be no cuts for environmental
protection, and 46 percent held out for no cuts whatever in roads
and highways spending.
   The findings suggest Americans are no nearer than before to
solving the dilemma of wanting to spend more than to pay, since one
survey after another finds voters opposed to higher taxes.
   The trick may be to find tax increases that affect the fewest
number of people, but such taxes, of course, are also likely to
provide the least revenue. Among the possibilities, therefore, are
taxes on cigarettes and alcohol.
   Perhaps the least likely tax to be accepted by the public would
be the value-added tax which, as might be surmised, is also the tax
that could do most to correct the budget imbalance.
   Such a tax _ on the increase in value of products at the various
stages in production and distribution _ might provide as much as
$127 billion in revenue, compared to $4 billion to $8 billion for
boosts in alcohol and cigarette taxes, according to the
Congressional Budget Office.
   Some of the possibilities studied by the Budget Office would
seem to have little chance of passing, including taxing capital
gains at death, limiting mortgage-interest deductions, and raising
capital gains taxes on home sales.
   Somewhere there is a solution, but it is deep in the dark
confines of the political closet, a spooky place where timid
political candidates do not even want to look.

<HEAD>``Shag'' Introduces Another Hannah to Moviegoers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MATT WOLF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Her surname may sound familiar, but Page Hannah is
launching a movie career based on her own merits, not on family
ties.
   ``I just don't think people are stupid enough to base a $7
million movie on the fact that I'm related to someone; I just don't
buy it,'' said Daryl Hannah's younger sister, whose new movie
called ``Shag'' opened last month in London.
   Set in South Carolina in 1963, the film intrigued some critics
as a kind of son or daughter of the highly acclaimed ``American
Graffiti.'' It portrays four teen-age girls on a last, romantic
summer fling.
   ``Shag'' also features Bridget Fonda, daughter of Peter Fonda,
Tyrone Power Jr., Phoebe Cates and Annabeth Gish, prompting Nigel
Andrews in The Financial Times to write that the movie's main
interest was ``that everyone in it seemed to be the close relative
of someone else.''
   But freckle-faced Hannah, 24 and 3{ years younger than her
glamorous, blond sister, says: ``I'm not bombshell enough or
unusual enough to bring in people simply because I have a last name
that's similar (to someone famous), and I don't think anyone else
in `Shag' is either.''
   Directed by British filmmaker Zelda Barron and opening in the
United States early this autumn, ``Shag'' takes its name from a
popular 1960s dance.
   However, Hannah said the movie was not a retread of recent
movies with dance themes such as ``Dirty Dancing'' and ``Salsa.''
All three were choreographed by Kenny Ortega.
   ``It's much more concerned with getting to know the
characters,'' Hannah said.
   And she added, ``It's extremely rare to have a film about four
girls with a woman directing it.''
   Hannah plays Luanne, the straight-laced daughter of a senator.
She hides behind enormous glasses, her long hair piled into a bun
in the back.
   The Chicago-born actress has done year-long stints as Kate Riley
on the TV series ``Fame,'' and as Adair McCleery in the soap opera
``Search for Tomorrow.'' However, ``Shag'' is her first major
screen role.
   ``In Great Britain, the fact that I have worked steadily is more
recognized. In America, it's like, `So, she's worked steadily; most
of it hasn't really come out,''' Hannah said. ``Here, it's a
testament that you keep getting jobs, (so) obviously you're good.''
   One of 10 children and stepchildren, she joked that acting was
becoming ``kind of a new family business.''
   But she added that her sister has refrained from offering
advice: ``It's not like lawyers sit down with their younger
brothers and say, `This is the way it's going to be.'''

   The role of Freddy in ``Nightmare on Elm
Street'' doesn't carry the prestige of ``Hamlet,'' but Robert
Englund isn't complaining.
   In fact, Englund, a Shakespearean actor at the age of 21,
considers Freddy one of his most challenging roles.
   ``Freddy's one of the first times I used a lot of that theater
training because I can physicalize him so much. I can do a vocal
characterization. You have to live up to the scenery around you,''
he said.
   ``There's a lot of good old-fashioned acting.''
   Freddy is the villain everyone loves to hate in the
``Nightmare'' films. In ``Nightmare on Elm Street IV: The Dream
Master,'' Freddy returns from the dead to haunt the teen-agers of
Springwood, U.S.A.
   The first three ``Nightmare'' films earned a combined $103
million at the domestic box office with Freddy unquestionably the
main drawing card. He's slated to carry his Freddy portrayal to a
TV series this fall called ``A Nightmare on Elm Street: Freddy's
Nightmares.''
   ``There's so many things wrong today,'' Englund said in an
interview. ``Freddy becomes kind of a blanket evil. I don't think
people identify with Freddy but I do think they enjoy the
unapologetic evil.''
   Like any actor, Englund had to find the motivation to play his
character. But how to relate to someone as evil as Freddy?
   ``I used a very concrete trick. I looked around at the
incredible youth and beauty of my co-stars. They were gorgeous,
young; they weren't jaded. I had my share of bitterness and bad
stories.
   ``I was able to use my envy that they were being pampered while
I was being basted like a turkey with Vasoline. I would literally
use that to get angry with them and resent them. It was a nice
parallel to Freddy's loathing of youth and beauty and innocence.''
   Englund grew up in Southern California in the 1950s and was 12
when he enrolled in a children's theater program at California
State University at Northridge. In high school, he won 10 acting
awards in the teen-age drama workshop and was eventually accepted
at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art in England.
   Englund appeared in the Cleveland company production of
``Godspell'' in 1972. His feature film debut was ``Buster and
Billie,'' which starred Jan Michael Vincent and Pamela Sue Martin.
He later appeared with Jeff Bridges and Sally Field in ``Stay
Hungry,'' and with Henry Fonda in ``The Last of the Cowboys.''
   In 1984, after playing Willie in the popular TV miniseries,
``V,'' Englund was looking for a change of pace.
   ``I had some free time and the `Nightmare' film was one of the
few projects that came through my agent that fit perfectly in
there,'' Englund recalled. ``I had never played a monster. I went
in not knowing that Freddy was always in makeup. I thought that
maybe he would be a before and after.''
   The first ``Nightmare'' film was shot on the stage once used for
the ``I Love Lucy'' TV series.
   ``It was this wonderful ensemble thing. We shared a common sound
stage with France's premier communal theater group. It was
wonderful for me doing my first low-rent horror movie to see the
premier ensemble company of the world sit in awe at this perfect
Hollywood movie for them to witness,'' Englund said.
   ``We had gorgeous teen-age girls, fire stunts and monsters. They
were doing `Twelfth Night' in French with silk backdrops and
embroidered costumes.''
   Surprisingly, Englund wasn't much of a fan of horror movies
growing up, but he does admit to being affected by ``Frankenstein.''
   ``I remember watching the original `Frankenstein' with my
mother. It began at 11:15 at night. I was obsessed with that movie,
I couldn't sleep for a week.''
   Freddy has probably caused a few sleepless nights as well. Not
just for the audience, but for Englund, who must endure the daily
routine of having the makeup applied.
   ``It gets harder; it doesn't get easier,'' he said. ``When you
start the movie, you haven't done makeup in a year so it's no big
deal. Towards the end, I would feel my skin tingling in
anticipation. It's not fun.''
   Freddy's appeal isn't just his appearance, but what he says. A
typical line comes in ``Nightmare IV'' when he turns a girl into a
roach and mutters, ``You can check in, but you can't check out.''
   Englund says Freddy's penchant for such one-liners comes from
another popular movie figure _ Clint Eastwood.
   ``There is a certain Clint Eastwoodism that Freddy does use,''
he said. ``Throwing culture in the face of an audience that made
him part of the popular culture.''
   How popular is Freddy? Englund says he's known all over the
world.
   ``There's a huge following in London. There are Freddy
knock-knock jokes in Yugoslavia. The producers in India got mad and
thought the movie was calculated for India _ They have some evil
god like Freddy.''
   Can Englund, who grew up admiring such actors as Michael Caine
and Alan Bates, accept being remembered as a horror movie star? Yes.
   ``If I have to go as a footnote with Boris Karloff and Bela
Lugosi, that's OK,'' he said. ``I have no choice now. I grew it, I

<HEAD>Americans Share Grief With Bereaved Iranians</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE W. CORNELL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   ``It was a horrible senseless thing to happen..
. Please accept my apology and my heartfelt sorrow... I share your
grief and outrage... May God be with you.''
   Such are the sentiments of Americans in letters to families of
the 290 people killed July 3 when the U.S.S. Vincennes mistakenly
shot down an Iranian airliner over the Persian Gulf.
   ``Our crying extends across the oceans,'' wrote Ginger Smith of
Honolulu.
   The U.S. outpouring was typically grass roots, initiated
unofficially, reflecting varied emotions and attitudes, but
overwhelmingly expressing sympathy and regret.
   ``My heart goes out to you in your loss of a loved one,'' wrote
Virla Jean Lynk of Saginaw, Mich. Maria Keeling of Norman, Okla.,
wrote, ``I wish I were there to hold your hand during your sorrow.''
   Wrote Lauri Jo Pietila of San Francisco: ``I grieve for all of
you and the terrible injustice that has been done. Please don't
hate the entire United States...''
   Many of the letters spoke of the common humanity of all people,
whatever their nations or conflicts between them.
   ``We are brothers and sisters,'' wrote Michele Gallery of Studio
City, Calif. Paul J. Piccard of Talahassee, Fla., wrote, ``Since we
all share the same humanity, it is also my loss.''
   The project was begun by the Rev. W. Canty, a New York Episcopal
priest, who says ``some of the letters have caused me to weep. The
love and compassion expressed by Americans for people half a world
away is quite extraordinary.''
   Once the collection is accumulated, he plans to have the letters
translated into Iran's language, Farsi, and languages of other
victims, and bound. He then is to deliver them personally to the
bereaved families.
   Several mainline denominations have endorsed the project, as has
the Rev. Lawrence M. Jenco, a Roman Catholic priest held hostage in
Lebanon for 19 months before his release in mid-1986.
   Those wishing to write should address letters to P.O. Box 6122,
Grand Central Station, New York, N.Y. 10163-6019.
   ``I hope that you will accept the love in my heart,'' wrote
Brent Haug of Las Vegas, Nev. He said a best friend in college was
an Iranian and wished ``all of us could have the benefit of meeting
each other on friendly terms.''
   A New York Jew, Brynna C. Bloomfield, wrote that she formerly
regarded non-Jewish Middle Easterners as an impersonal ``mass,''
but the accident has caused her ``to think about you, humanely, for
the very first time.''
   ``Your losses ... have caused me to ... see ... husbands and
mothers and sisters and children. Then I think you must love and
despair as I do...''
   Andrew Cohen, a Houston student, wrote that ``my government and
your government are enemies, but every man's life is equally
important. All people are the same... I'll be thinking of you and
your pain. God bless you.''
   Only about 100 letters have been received so far, but they're
still coming, mainly from ordinary people but also from Congress
members, judges, mayors, governors, ministers and movie actors.
   A few letters criticized U.S. policy, but most avoided assessing
blame. The Pentagon attributed the accident to stress and ``human
errors'' in reading data. Only two letters denounced Iranians and
also the project.
   Canty said gathering the letters was non-political. ``All people
are victims of this accidental tragedy in one way or another.
Empathizing with grief and sharing these condolences allows the
healing process to start.''
   Some letters voiced shame at the incident. ``I love my country,
but at this time I feel great sorrow and shame for the terrible
horror it has caused you,'' wrote Lucile Sealander of Fayetteville,
Ark.
   Some letters came from parents who who had lost loved ones in
American airplane crashes. A New York woman, Lois Spark, whose son
was killed in an 1986 crash in Detroit that killed 157, wrote:
   ``I know your anger and feel your pain along with mine... My
hope for us, as survivors of these victims, is that they did not
die in vain. That out of this tragedy will come a new desire to
live together on this Earth in peace.''
   Many of the letters express hope for greater international
friendship and trust.
   ``Regardless of what happened between our countries in the
past,'' wrote James E. Ponder of Easling, S.C., ``I love you as a
child of God... I hope that someday soon, Iran and the United
States can become friends.''
   Wrote Stephanie Lee of San Francisco:
   `It is not my place to ask your fogiveness nor do I expect it
for our military's fatal action. I do ask you to please keep your
hearts and minds open to the American people... May you find
strength and love in each other and in your God.''

<HEAD>Philippines Facing Education Crisis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIGUEL C. SUAREZ</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MANILA, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Of the 2,684 law school graduates who
took the bar exams his year, only 480 passed. The result left many
Filipinos in shock and dramatized the state of the country's
American-inspired eductional system.
   Once a model for Asia, it has slumped into mediocrity.
   The results of the bar exams announced by the Supreme Court in
May were the lowest in the history of the Philippines Bar.
   ``It is an indication of the deteriorating quality of the
education we have, especially in the preparatory courses,'' said
Emilio Rebueno, a lawyer who has administered the exams for the
last 11 years. ``A lot of them (examinees) could not even express
themselves.''
   In July, President Corazon Aquino told the nation that unless
the decline in educational standards was checked, generations of
Filipinos would be doomed to ``a future of rampant functional
illiteracy.''
   Critics attribute the decline to low teacher salaries and a lack
of classrooms, books and other teaching aids. They also cite
outdated curricula, poorly trained teachers and inefficient use of
funds, already scarce.
   Many of those who graduate from public high schools cannot
afford to attend elite private colleges or are unable to compete
for places at the state-run University of the Philippines because
of inferior secondary education.
   They wind up in privately-owned ``diploma mills,'' which churn
out thousands of teachers, nurses and other professionals who
cannot qualify for jobs when they graduate.
   After the bar-exam results were announced, Ernesto Jaurigue,
director general of the Professional Regulation Commission,
reported a similar decline in examination results for other
professions, such as medicine, engineering and nursing.
   It was not always that way.
   Amado Dizon, secretary general of the Coordinating Council of
Private Educational Associations, recalled that several decades
ago, the quality of education was so high that a sixth-grade
student could qualify as a substitute teacher for the lower grades.
   Today, education officials acknowledge that many teachers,
especially in the countryside, are not qualified to teach and serve
only to pass on their own ignorance to their students.
   When the United States colonized the Philippines at the turn of
the century, it introduced a public school system patterned after
its own and shipped in thousands of American teachers.
   In a few decades, the demand for higher education was so strong
that the handful of existing private and state colleges could not
cope. Private schools flourished.
   The Philippines still claims one of the highest literacy rates
in Asia at 89 percent. But many question the figure because it
includes people who can read and write only their names.
   Dr. Victor Ordonez, undersecretary of education, attributes the
slide to lack of money, neglect of the education sector during the
20-year rule of the now-deposed President Ferdinand E. Marcos, and
on the system's own inflexibility.
   ``Our country has had so many dramatic turns in its history .. .
but our education system has remained the same as when the
Americans introduced it,'' he said in a recent interview. ``It
continues to move in the same fixed direction and it may fall off
the cliff of irrelevance. We are giving our children the tools of
the past.
   ``How many of them, after school, will need to diagram a
sentence or solve a real-life problem with simultaneous algebraic
equations, or to remember a date (in history)?''
   The Philippines' system emphasizes rote drills at the expense of
analysis or group discussions, which experts say enhance
problem-solving skills. Classes of 50 or more pupils are common.
   Even during the Marcos years, education officials recognized the
problem. With a $100-million loan from the World Bank, they
launched a program in 1980 to reform the public elementary school
system. The program ends this year.
   A $200-million program, financed by grants from various
countries and loans from the Asian Development Bank, is to be
launched next year to upgrade public high schools.
   Both programs involve intensive retraining of teachers,
rewriting books and revamping curricula. Elementary curricula were
reorganized to emphasize basics _ reading, writing and arithmetic.
   Public school teachers' salaries have also been increased
recently. The national average salary for a new teacher was
increased this year to 2,400 pesos ($120) a month from 1,500 pesos
($75).
   This has increased the prestige of the teaching profession, and
applications for teachers schools have increased threefold. Ordonez
said many of the applicants have graduated from ``quality schools.''
   According to Ordonez, the effect of the reforms will not become
apparent until 1994, when students who entered the first grade in
1980 begin graduating from four-year colleges.
   Ordonez said results of achievement tests indicate that progress
is being made. Filipino public school students normally spend six
years in elementary grades and four in high school.

<TEXT>
   Captain James T. Kirk of the starship Enterprise
looks skyward from a lonely, wind-blown planet and says:
``Entapuraizu, riku kara tenso shite kure.''
   For those listening to the English version of ``Star Trek,''
Captain Kirk would have said ``Enterprise, beam me up.''
   Dubbed in Japanese, ``Star Trek'' is just one of many vintage
American TV programs boldly exploring the late-night Tokyo airwaves.
   During a typical week, insomnia-stricken viewers in the Tokyo
area can watch ``Burke's Law,'' the 1960s adventure show starring
Gene Barry as a debonair Los Angeles police chief; Rod Serling's
``The Twilight Zone,'' the acclaimed science fiction series;
``Bonanza,'' one of television's longest running Westerns, starring
Lorne Greene; ``The Beverly Hillbillies,'' the antics of a
backwoods family in Los Angeles' elitist neighborhood; ``Mission:
Impossible,'' the acclaimed Bruce Geller adventure series; and
``The Addams Family,'' a sitcom based on Charles Addams' bizarre
magazine cartoon characters.
   ``I don't have any statistics on this,'' said Yoshihiro Mishima
of the TV Tokyo network, ``but we think the people who stay up to
watch these programs are looking for a bit of the good old days,
when they might have been too young to watch the original
broadcasts.''
   Mishima said the viewers are mainly college students or adults
in their 30s. ``It's part of the `retro boom,''' he said, referring
to a recent trend among some Japanese to seek out things from the
past.
   But American TV shows are nothing new to the Japanese audience.
``There have been American programs on Japanese TV for decades,
going back to `Ben Casey' and `Rawhide,''' Mishima said. ``They've
lost popularity to domestic programing, but people still watch them
to get a look at America.''
   Yuji Tagami, an editor with TV Station magazine, added, ``They
can develop devoted fans, but ratings for late-night American
programs in general are not very high.''
   Limited viewership did not stop the Tokyo Broadcasting System
from putting the ``Nostalgic American TV'' series on its schedule
last October. Since March, the series has included: ``Surfside 6,''
a '60s detective series set in Miami Beach, starring Troy Donahue
and Van Williams; ``Combat!'' the longest of the World War II
adventures, starring the late Vic Morrow; and ``Superman,''
starring George Reeves.
   ``Ratings aren't a good way to judge late-night television
shows' popularity. In that time slot, viewership is small and more
personal. Viewers are more attached to what they watch,'' said
Masato Ueda, TBS producer of the series.
   To young viewers, the appeal of the rejuvenated old programs is
in their ``newness,'' Ueda said.
   ``We decided to go with the series when we went on the 24-hour
broadcasting schedule, and though the `retro boom' was a part of
the decision, we wanted to give young people something completely
new, which to them these programs are.''
   Many of the American programs also feature bilingual broadcasts,
with the original English-language dialogue simultaneously aired on
a subchannel available on specially equipped TV sets.

   Television is assuming the role previously held by
religion in shaping culture, says the head of communications for
the National Council of Churches.
   The Rev. William Fore told the convention of the Religion Public
Relations Council:
   ``Television, rather than churches, is becoming the place where
people find a worldview which reflects what to them is of ultimate
value and which justifies their behavior and way of life.
   ``Television today, whether the viewers know it or not, and
whether the television industry knows it or not, is competing not
merely for our attention and dollars, but for our very souls.''

   A parish expert says the
``feminization'' of local United Methodist churches has contributed
to the decline in the denomination's membership.
   In an article, ``The Vanishing Men in the United Methodist
Church'' for a denominational publication, ``Circuit Rider,'' the
Rev. Lyle Schaller links membership decline to an increasing
percentage of female parishoners.
   He says the imbalance began developing about 1960, five years
before the prolonged decline set in. Church programming ``is
increasingly oriented toward reaching women and children,'' he says.
   Schaller, a United Methodist who is parish consultant for the
Yokefeller Institute in Richmond, Ind., says it is critical ``to
create places in the church where men feel wanted and feel needed.''
   Barbara E. Campbell, an official of the denomination's Women's
division, replies that women may be represented in larger numbers
but men still retain the power. She says the leadership pattern is
``constitutionally biased in favor of men.''

   When Sen. Dan Quayle was baptized a Presbyterian
as an infant, his father, James C. Quayle, recalls that the baby
tried to grab the rose used by the pastor in sprinkling him.
   That touching scene from the past is part of the religious
chronology of the current vice presidential candidates.
   Their religious attachments scarcely have been reported compared
to those of the presidential contenders, Republican George Bush, an
Episcopalian, and Democrat Michael Dukakis, a Greek Orthodox, both
lifelong members of their faiths.
   Dukakis' running mate, Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, was reared a Southern
Baptist but is a longtime active member of the Presbyterian Church
in the U.S.A, the mainline denomination of that tradition.
   Republican Quayle, a cradle Presbyterian, was put on an
``inactive'' list six years ago for prolonged non-participation at
First Presbyterian Church in Huntington, Ind., also part of the
mainline denomination.
   Although it says his membership has not been transferred
elsewhere, he lately has attended congregations of conservative
offshoot Presbyterian bodies espousing biblical fundamentalism,
without formal membership.
   An independent Bible congregation in Indiana also says he still
participates, and congressional biographies list his affiliation as
Bible Church.
   ``He has maintained his relationship with us,'' said the Rev.
William T. Pauley, pastor of Parkview Bible Church in Fort Wayne,
Ind. ``You could say he's still a member.'' Quayle participated
regularly in the mid-1970s.
   ``He is anxious that he lives his life in accordance with the
Scripture,'' Pauley said. ``He takes his stands on the position of
the Bible.''
   Since early this year in Washington, he has attended McLean
Presbyterian Church in McLean, Va., which also insists on Bible
``inerrancy'' (that it's free of error).
   ``He has started worshipping with us over the last several
months,'' said the church's pastor, the Rev. Stephen Smallman,
noting Quayle's family also participates, his children attending
Sunday school.
   The congregation is among conservatives that broke from mainline
Presbyterianism in 1973 to form a separate denomination, the
Presbyterian Church in America. It does not ordain women, as does
the main body.
   Asked about Quayle's commitment, Smallman said, ``I really don't
know him very well, other than to shake hands with him at the door,
and exchange chit-chat.''
   Quayle previously attended Fourth Presbyterian Church in the
capital's suburban Bethesda, Md., part of another conservative
breakaway group that in 1980 formed a small separate denomination,
the Evangelical Presbyterian Church.
   ``He and his wife took part in an adult Sunday school class,''
said the assistant pastor, the Rev. Jeffrey Jeremiah, noting they
and their children attended there for about five years until 1986.
   ``I'm certain the Bible informs him on how he lives his life,''
Jeremiah said.
   In Washington, Quayle's wife, Marilyn, takes part in Friday
Bible study with a score of congressional wives in the home of Rep.
Jack Kemp, R.-N.Y.
   Bentsen is a longtime member of Houston's First Presbyterian
Church, part of the mainline denomination, and takes part in its
life and worship when in town.
   ``He has a strong Christian faith,'' said the pastor, the Rev.
John William Lancaster. ``He was reared in a very strong Christian
tradition, and is a man of genuine Christian commitment.''
   Before Bentsen was nominated for the vice presidency in July, he
had agreed to speak in a Lenten series at the church early next
year on the subject of ``translating your faith into daily life.''
   ``He is not one to use his faith for political purposes, but
it's important in how he thinks and in his value system,''
Lancaster said.
   Bentsen's wife, a daughter, Tina, and son, Lloyd III, also are
active in the congregation, the son ushering and teaching a Sunday
school class.
   Bentsen was reared a Southern Baptist in his native McAllen,
Texas, but has been a Presbyterian through most of his adult life.
In Washington, he attends National Presbyterian Church or New York
Avenue Presbyterian.
   His brother, Donald of McAllen, who is a Baptist, said Bentsen
``doesn't carry his Bible out in front of him,'' but is attuned to
it privately. ``He doesn't use religion in his politics.''
   Quayle had transferred his membership in 1964 from the
Scottsdale (Ariz.) Valley Presbyterian Church, in which his father
had been a charter member, to the Huntington church. It put Quayle
on the inactive list in 1982.
   Both are part of the mainline denomination.
   Quayle and his family had participated regularly in the mid-70s
in Grace Bible Church in Leo, Ind. It moved to Fort Wayne in 1984,
changing its name to Parkview Bible Church. ``He came to give our
inaugural address,'' Pauley recounts.
   Pauley said the independent congregation, unaffiliated with any
denomination, was bibically fundamentalist, ``but not like some
fundamentalists. We're not legalistic, saying you can't do this or
that.''

<HEAD>The `Big Blue' Is Home to Jacques Mayol</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HILLEL ITALIE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The diver Jacques Mayol believes dolphins are
the smartest animals around, and he tries to emulate their way of
life.
   ``That is my hobby, to see how we are related to the dolphins,''
said Mayol, the inspiration for the film, ``Big Blue.''
   ``Its examples should always be followed by man. Its purity and
simplicity. Its respect of its own behavior with nature. He who
lives in harmony with nature can only do good.''
   ``Big Blue,'' directed by Luc Besson, chronicles Mayol's life
from his childhood. Mayol, however, points out that the film
differs greatly from what actually happened.
   ``You can't make a movie totally based on my own life; it could
be a little boring,'' he said. ``It would be too much like a
documentary, too scientific, too philosophical.''
   In ``Big Blue,'' he grows up in Greece and has a diver for a
father. However, Mayol was actually born in the Orient and later
went to Greece to study. His father was not a diver but an
architect and did not like to swim.
   ``Besson made a psychological transfer of his youth in Greece,''
he said. ``He distorted everything, which doesn't matter because
it's a movie. I just accept it, like dolphins do.''
   Much of ``Big Blue'' is devoted to Mayol's friendly rivalry with
Enzo Maiorca, an Italian free diver. Maiorca, whose name was
changed to Molinari in ``Big Blue,'' is determined to dive deeper
than Mayol and dies at the end of the film. The real Enzo Maiorca
is alive.
   ``He's very proud. Very much like he's depicted in the film,''
Mayol said. ``He claims he hasn't seen it. But I knows he's seen
it. He was irritated to the point where he's going to attempt to
beat me again.
   ``The truth is that this rivalry after 22 years still exists.''
   The actor Jean-Marc Barr portrays Mayol in ``Big Blue.''
   ``He's almost like a son to me,'' Mayol said. ``I admired his
desire and his total sincerity in trying to supplicate the little
he knew about me. It was fantastic what he did physically. He dove
day after day.''
   Mayol says it was Besson's idea to make the movie.
   ``Luc went to see me and I thought it was a fabulous thing. I
couldn't believe it. He was just a kid.''
   The film has already been released in Europe and has brought
renewed interest in Mayol's career. But Mayol is not interested in
being a celebrity: ``I don't need the glory, I have it already.''
   Mayol was born April 1, 1927, in Shanghai, which he points out,
means ``On the sea.''
   ``I was a very mischievous child and extremely stubborn and very
bad-tempered,'' he said. ``The hospital where I was born was being
attacked by the Chinese Communists. They wanted to chase all the
white people out. I presumed this marked me.''
   From an early age, Mayol had an interest in the sea.
   ``It's just something that came from within _ totally
unexplained as if it was predestined. I remember as a kid dreaming
I was hanging on to whales.''
   Mayol says his childhood in Shanghai influenced his approach to
diving. ``You go into the sea humbly. It's a very weird feeling.
It's completely another level of conciousness, another reality.''
   In the 1950s, he worked as a journalist in the United States and
was encouraged by friends to competitively test his diving skills.
   Mayol and Maiorca began competing against each other in 1966,
taking turns as the world record holder. But when they reached 249
feet in 1970, the International Federation ruled that the depths
were too dangerous and refused to accept any further records.
   In ``Big Blue,'' Maiorca continues to dive and eventually dies
from going too deep. Mayol says a similar incident, although
non-fatal, actually occurred.
   ``In 1974, he beat me by one meter (3.3 feet) except when he
came back he was dead. At 20 meters from the surface he fainted
completely. He was blue, foam in his mouth,'' Mayol said.
   ``He was brought back to life and solemnly swore that he was
giving up the career. That man is really stubborn.''
   Mayol continued to dive, reaching 345 feet in 1983, but only for
scientific purposes.
   ``I went on because I felt a joy, a total awareness of a new
feeling _ a symbiosis with the sea,'' he said.

   Holy men in their traditional saffron
robes will hand over 4 million guava saplings and papaya seeds to
Hindu pilgrims at a religious fair in January in a unique effort to
get people to plant trees as a way of saving their land and
improving their livelihood.
   The idea is that of an American volunteer group called Trees for
Life in Wichita, Kan.
   ``It is something very new, very original, very challenging,''
said Deepak Nirula, the Indian representative of the organization,
which aims to plant 5 million tress in poor countries to provide
food and fuel for needy people.
   The group is headed in Wichita by Balbir Mathur, who was born in
India but is now a naturalized American. Mathur plans to raise $15
million in small contributions in the United States to finance the
effort.
   The organization is hiring Indian holy men and volunteers to
distribute the saplings and seeds at Kumbh Mela, a three-week fair
to be held in Allahabad in central India, beginning Jan. 14. The
religious fair is held every 12 years and attracts more than 10
million Hindu pilgrims who bathe in the holy Ganges River during a
particularly auspicious configuration of the planets, the sun and
the moon.
   ``We figured out that if we can give it a holy touch to the tree
plantation drive, it can work,'' Nirula said in an interview.
   ``The saplings and seeds will be part of the holy offering which
no Hindu ignores, so we hope when they go back to their respective
villages they will plant the saplings and the seeds,'' said Nirula,
who runs a chain of fast food restaurants in New Delhi.
   ``We may be accused of exploiting the religious sentiments of
the people, but it is for a good cause.''
   Trees for Life is one of the 175 organizations in India trying
to save the fast depleting forests. Each year, the country loses a
total of 3.7 million acres of forest.
   ``It is a very serious problem,'' said Joyce Shankaran, a
director at the National Wastelands Development Board, the official
body that oversees the work of the volunteer organizations.
   It is estimated that at the current rate of deforestation, India
will lose nearly 10 million acres of woodlands, an area equal to
the size of Switzerland, in the next five years.
   Until a few years ago, the Indian government was saddled with
misleading statistics from forest guards that all was green. It was
thought that 22 percent of the country's 812-million-acre land mass
was under forest cover. Ecologists say that the ideal forest cover
should be 33 percent of the land mass, but 22 percent was
considered acceptable in a nation of 800 million people.
   From satellite photographs of India, however, the government
determined that only about 10 percent of the land mass was under
good forest cover.
   The entire Himalayan ecosystem is threatened as a consequence,
with snow lines moving higher and perennial springs drying up
because of lack of precipitation.
   Vanishing forests also affect wildlife. Government reports say
that some of the 350 species of mammals, 1,200 species of birds and
2,000 species of insects in India are threatened. Some may have
been lost already.
   ``Government alone can't save the forest; it has gone beyond the
control of any government,'' said Akhil Chander, a volunteer
working in New Delhi.
   ``There has to be a massive people's movement including
individuals, voluntary organizations, schools and private and
public institution,'' Chander said.
   The Trees for Life group is working in five Indian states. The
most visible project is in Allahabad where the group is planting
papaya saplings.
   ``Our aim is 700,000 papaya tress in Allahabad; we have already
planted 200,000,'' Nirula said. The group wants to plant 2.7
million trees and set up 800 beehives in India by the end of 1989.
   ``This will mean an extra 13.5 million tons of fruit, fuel and
fodder; 88,000 pounds of honey, and save 5,000 tons of wood from
being used as fuel for cooking,'' Nirula said.
   The need for firewood and fodder, or coarse food for cattle, in
India is about 133 million tons a year, but only 36 million tons
are available in state-run stores. The rest comes from illegal
felling of trees, government investigations indicate.
   The Trees for Life group spends about $3 for planting a fruit
tree.
   ``Our message is very clear and loud,'' Nirula said. ``Plant
fruit trees and you will not go hungry.
   ``A $3 apple tree produces 10,000 pounds of apple in its
lifetime. ... Can you imagine going to your grocer and asking him
to give you 10,000 pounds of fruit for $3?
   ``The grocer can't, but Trees for Life can.''

   The world's industrialized economies are booming
this year, and governments should be ready to hit their economic
brakes if inflation shows signs of heating up, the International
Monetary Fund says.
   The IMF outlook has been distributed to member governments but
is not to be made public until later this month. A copy was
obtained and published Tuesday by the AP-Dow Jones News Service.
   The fund's economists now anticipate inflation-adjusted growth
of 3.8 percent for 1988, compared with the 2.8 percent increase
projected in their April report.

   Car and truck sales fell 10.7 percent in August,
compared with the same month last year when incentives prompted
quicker buying decisions by consumers, the automakers and analysts
said.
   Foreign and domestic vehicle makers said they sold 1.25 million
cars and trucks last month, down from 1.35 million during the same
month last year. Figures exclude Japan's Toyota Motor Sales USA
Inc. and South Korea's Hyundai Motor Co.
   For the 10-day period ended Aug. 31, Chrysler Corp. said its
sales of U.S.-made cars rose 2.6 percent compared with the same
period last year. Ford Motor Co. said its car sales for the period
fell 1.4 percent and General Motors Corp. reported a 13.9 percent
drop.

   The new design would make it possible for the companies to build
personal computers that rival IBM's 1{-year-old Personal System-2
line without departing so far from the older standard, analysts

   Japan has liberalized its financial markets by
announcing it would sell 40 percent of its 10-year government bonds
by auction and would give foreign underwriters a bigger share of
the distribution of the rest of the remaining 60 percent.
   The steps announced Tuesday were favorably received by U.S.
officials.
   The auctions will begin in April 1989 and are expected to make
it easier for foreign securities firms to get a bigger share of the
business of selling Japanese government debt.

<HEAD>Oil Futures Prices Fall to Nearly Two-Year Low</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Oil futures prices have fallen to a nearly two-year low,
although analysts do not expect much of a drop in prices to
consumers because of tight supplies for products such as gasoline.
   The drop in oil prices Tuesday came as traders continued to lose
confidence in the ability of the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries to restrain production.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, futures contracts for
October delivery of West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark grade of
U.S. crude, dropped 55 cents a barrel to $14.24. Crude prices had
not been that low on the exchange since October 1986, when they
reached $13.73 per barrel.
   The news on oil failed to have much of an impact on other
markets.
   Stock prices rose modestly Tuesday on the momentum of Friday's
strong gain. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks
increased 10.67 points to 2,065.26 after leaping 52.28 on Friday.
Broader indexes also rose.
   The dollar declined against most major currencies and bond
prices were little changed, while in the commodities market, pork
futures posted steep losses following indications of a sharp
increase in hog supplies.
   In another indication of the economy's direction, Chrysler Corp.
reported sales gains for late August and for the entire month, but
sales slid at Ford Motor Co. and General Motors Corp. compared to a
year ago. Sales were high in August 1987 because the Big Three
automakers slashed financing rates, analysts said.
   Oil market skepticism about the ability of the 13-nation OPEC to
trim its output has deepened in recent days, after initial optimism
about cooperation within the cartel resulting from the cease-fire
between OPEC members Iran and Iraq.
   ``There's too much oil right now. OPEC is showing a complete
lack of discipline,'' said Peter Beutel, assistant director of the
energy group at Elders Futures Inc.
   OPEC Secretary-General Subroto recently capped off a series of
meetings with oil producers by visiting officials in Iran and Iraq,
and tried to persuade Iran to allow Iraq a higher production quota.
But Subroto made little headway in his efforts to win cooperation
among OPEC members for curbing overall output.

<HEAD>Incentives Help Samurai Sales To Set Record</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER COY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sales of the Suzuki Samurai broke a monthly
sales record by 45.9 percent in August as sharp price cuts helped
it stage a comeback from the damage done by allegations that it was
an unsafe vehicle.
   Samurai sales plunged by 70.6 percent in June after Consumers
Union charged that the small, boxy, four-wheel-drive vehicle was
dangerously top-heavy and prone to rolling over.
   August sales totaled 12,208, up from the 2,199 sold in June. The
sales were 54.4 percent ahead of the 7,905 sold in August 1987 and
45.9 percent ahead of the previous-record 8,365 sold in July 1987.
   ``Certainly consumer confidence is back in the Samurai,'' said
Douglas Mazza, general manager of the automotive division of
American Suzuki Motor Corp.
   Consumers Union, publisher of Consumer Reports, stood by its
criticism of the Samurai, which it has rated `not acceptable.'
   ``In essence, deep discounts and advertisements for fun and
excitement do not make this a safe car,'' Marnie Goodman, a
spokeswoman, said Tuesday.
   The swift turnaround restored Suzuki's winning image just in
time for the fall introduction of two new vehicles, a bigger
four-wheel-drive vehicle named the Sidekick and a small hatchback
named the Swift.
   Suzuki is predicting Samurai sales will drop off now that the
dealer incentives have ended, but it is counting on the Sidekick
and Swift to more than pick up the slack.
   Analysts said American Suzuki _ the U.S. arm of Japan's Suzuki
Motor Co. _ is in a much better position than it was three months
ago.
   ``Momentum tends to feed on itself,'' said Scott Merlis, an
analyst for Morgan, Stanley & Co.
   Merlis said he could not comment on the Samurai's safety, but
said it was obvious that customers were willing to shed any
lingering doubts raised by television news clips of the Samurai
tipping over while zigzagging on a Consumers Union test course.
   ``It's sometimes quite ironic how cash rebates can be the
antidote to safety concerns,'' Merlis said. ``Occasionally you see
sales incentives work like magic.''
   On July 13, Suzuki announced $2,000 incentives to dealers that
made it possible for them to slash 25 percent from the Samurai's
$7,995 base price. That helped July sales to rebound somehwat, to
6,327.
   Suzuki had piqued curiosity about its August results by saying
they would be a record, but kept its estimates low to enhance the
surprise.
   Mazza told the Wall Street Journal on Thursday that August sales
would top 9,000. He told the Associated Press on Friday he hoped
sales would exceed 10,000, but did not want to predict they would
be as high as 11,000. ``It was better than even we forecast, and
we're pretty optimistic,'' he said Tuesday.
   Suzuki steadfastly has defended the Samurai's safety, and its
contentions were supported last Thursday when the National Highway
Traffic Safety Administration turned down petitions to investigate
and recall the vehicle. The agency said the Samurai was no more
dangerous than similar vehicles made by other companies.
   The Samurai's success was mirrored by the success of Chrysler
Corp.'s Jeep Wrangler, a competitor, whose sales rose 12 percent to
2,465 from 2,114. The Jeep line as a whole had record sales in
August.
   In another sense, the Samurai's experience is similar to the
rebound experienced by Chrysler's Dodge Omni and Plymouth Horizon,
which were rated not acceptable by Consumer Reports in June 1978.
Their sales fell by a third, but began to rebound after the United
States and Canadian governments said the charges of unsafe handling
could not be substantiated. Both cars are still on the market.

   U.S. sales of cars and trucks were off 10.7
percent last month compared with August 1987, when short-term
incentives enticed consumers to showrooms, automakers and analysts
say.
   Chrysler Corp. was the only one of the Big Three car makers
reporting sales Tuesday to show increases in late August and in
monthly car and truck sales, although one analyst said Chrysler's
incentives were hurting its profits.
   For the month, foreign and domestic vehicle makers reported they
sold 1.25 million cars and trucks last month, compared with 1.35
million during August 1987. Sales by foreign car and truck makers
fell 21.1 percent, and domestic vehicle makers reported a 6.7
percent decline.
   For the Aug. 21-31 period this year, Chrysler said it sold
32,214 U.S.-made cars, compared with 31,388 cars during the same
period last year, a 2.6 percent increase.
   General Motors Corp. reported a 13.9 percent sales decrease to
108,986 from 126,629 cars in late August 1987. Ford Motor Co. said
its sales dropped 1.4 percent to 65,500 in late August this year
from 66,515 in the same period last year.
   For the month, GM's sales were down 20.7 percent and Ford showed
a 6.2 percent decline. Chrysler posted a 5.5 percent increase in
monthly sales.
   All three carmakers reported increases in year-to-date figures,
with Chrysler leading the way at 13.2 percent this year over last
year, followed by Ford at 9.3 percent and GM at a modest 0.4
percent.
   There were nine selling days in the late August periods of 1988
and 1987, and 27 sales days last month compared with 26 days in
August 1987.
   A year ago, with just one month left in the model year,
carmakers offered buyer incentives, including cut-rate financing as
low as 1.9 percent for GM vehicles, to lure customers into
showrooms and shrink inventories. This year the incentives are
different.
   ``Chrysler has been more aggressive than the other two in using
incentives to stimulate sales,'' said Donald DeScenza, an industry
analyst with Nomura Securities Inc. of New York. ``They have the
biggest sales gain and the worst operating performance in the
second quarter. They're cutting into their profits.''
   ``There's an implication that they're buying the sales (with
incentives),'' DeScenza said. ``Those gains are maybe difficult to
hold onto without the incentives in a longer term...''
   ``Chrysler's strategy is to lock in as big a share of the market
as it can to increase its base of loyal customers,'' he said. ``But
I question whether customers gained though aggressive price-cutting
are loyal customers.''
   Toyota Motor Sales USA Inc. did not report August sales Tuesday
due to delayed computation of the monthly figures. The figures were
to be announced today.

   Here are sales results for the seven major U.S.
automakers for Aug. 21-31 as reported Tuesday.
   Percentage changes in sales are based on average daily sales
during each period rather than comparisons of straight totals.
There were nine selling days in the period this year and last.
   For the month, there were 27 selling days this year, vs. 26 last
year.
   Cars and trucks made in the United States by Honda, Nissan,
Toyota and Mazda are counted as domestic and appear in this table.
   Cars and trucks imported for sale under the GM, Ford and
Chrysler names are counted as foreign. Sales of imported cars and
trucks are reported at the end of each month.
   Toyota said because of a dealer incentive program, it would
report its monthly sales on Wednesday. The estimated Toyota figures
below reflect the average number of vehicles sold daily during the
first seven months of 1988 multiplied by the number of selling days.

<HEAD>Officials Expect Argentinian Success In Seeking $4 Billion From
IMF, Banks</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ED McCULLOUGH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Creditors are not happy about
lending Argentina another $4 billion to help pay interest on its
foreign debt through the end of 1989, but probably will do it
anyway, officials say.
   ``I think they (Argentina) will get new funds. It will be harder
because of the circumstances, but they'll get it,'' an economist
for a U.S.-based bank said Tuesday.
   A spokesman for the Economy Ministry said the ministry also
believes that commercial banks and institutional lenders are
reluctant, but nevertheless will commit new funds.
   An International Monetary Fund mission opened talks this week
with the Economy Ministry and Central Bank about Argentina's
anti-inflation plan and suspended interest payments on its $56
billion foreign debt.
   The nation reportedly is seeking loans totaling $4.2 billion
from the IMF and commercial banks, plus a $500 million bridge loan
to cover its foreign debt interest payments until it gets the IMF
money.
   Interest payments on Argentina's foreign debt, the third-largest
in the developing world behind Brazil and Mexico, will total about
$4.6 billion this year, of which the government wants to borrow
half.
   The Economy Ministry spokesman acknowledged the government is
behind in interest payments, but would not say by how much.
   The daily newspaper Ambito Financiero reported Tuesday that
arrearages totaled about $800 million, including $450 million 90
days or more overdue.
   Argentina is seeking a standby loan of about $1.2 billion from
the IMF, to run through the end of the administration of President
Raul Alfonsin in December 1989, according to the Economy Ministry.
   ``The government doesn't want to have to negotiate anything in
1989,'' the ministry spokesman said, speaking on condition of
anonymity.
   National elections are set for next May, and the opposition
Peronist Party stands a good chance of ousting Alfonsin's Radical
Civic Union.
   The ministry spokesman declined to comment on how much Argentina
wants to borrow from commercial banks, citing the delicate nature
of the talks. But the U.S. bank economist and the newspaper La
Nacion, in an article published Tuesday citing unnamed commercial
bank sources, said Argentina is seeking approximately $3 billion in
new bank funds.
   Central Bank director Daniel Marx is to meet Thursday with a
steering committee of 11 U.S., Canadian, European and Japanese
banks, which represents the 250 to 300 banks holding about $39
billion in outstanding loans to Argentina.
   The commercial loans were rescheduled last year, giving
Argentina a 7-year grace period on repayment of principal and $2
billion in new funds. The IMF also agreed to contribute $1.3
billion in standby funds.
   But the IMF and the banks withheld a combined $450 million that
was to be disbursed this year, because the Alfonsin government did
not meet agreed-upon economic targets, including levels of
inflation and the budget deficit.
   Inflation in August probably will exceed July's 25.6 percent
increase, which brought the rise in the cost of living to 178
percent for the first seven months of this year.
   On Aug. 3, the Alfonsin government devalued the austral by 11.4
percent against the U.S. dollar, pledged to reduce the budget
deficit, lifted restrictions on imports, and arranged with
producers a program of voluntary price controls.
   In a separate development, Argentina is seeking $750 million
from the World Bank. That money would be used to help finance the
reform of the banking system and reorient trade policy.
   The World Bank's vice president for Latin America, Shamid
Husain, issued no statement before departing last week, nor did the
Central Bank. But the Economy Ministry spokesman said Tuesday,
``There is not the slightest doubt the loan will be approved.''
   Argentina also is seeking a $500 million bridge loan from a
consortium led by the U.S. Treasury to cover interest payments on
the foreign debt until Argentina receives new funds from the IMF.

<HEAD>Kelly Proteges Follow His Footsteps With Stiffel Acquisition</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   They were schooled in corporate buyouts by master
dealmaker Donald P. Kelly, but two proteges of the Beatrice Co.
chairman say they also plan to actively manage their newly acquired
Stiffel Co. _ as they add to it.
   James M. Snodgrass said Tuesday he and Steven S. Lindblad are
``a little more operationally oriented and a little less dealmaking
oriented'' than Kelly.
   They plan to prove it as chairman and vice-chairman,
respectively, of Stiffel, a Chicago-based manufacturer of
brass-plated lamps formerly owned by Beatrice.
   ``We both want to grow The Stiffel Co. and do other acquisitions
but we want to be more involved in running the business,''
Snodgrass said in a telephone interview.
   Snodgrass and Lindblad did not disclose the amount their
investor group paid to buy Stiffel from American Brands Inc.
   American Brands, based in Greenwich, Conn., acquired Stiffel
earlier this year in its $2.7 billion purchase of Stiffel's parent,
E-II Holdings Inc., a Beatrice offshoot also headed at the time by
Kelly.
   Snodgrass, 51, said one reason he and Lindblad chose Stiffel as
their first acquisition was that, as former executives of Beatrice
and E-II, they already had some knowledge of the company's
operations.
   The 50-year-old Stiffel has about 500 employees, he said.
   The men said Kelly, who will resign as chairman of Chicago-based
Beatrice effective Oct. 1, played no direct role in their venture.
   But Snodgrass and Lindblad, who met while working for Kelly at
Esmark Inc. in the early 1970s, acknowledged his influence on this
new direction in their professional lives.
   ``I suppose, since I worked for the man from 1971 forward, if I
wasn't influenced by him I'd be kind of dumb,'' Snodgrass said. ``I
suppose the common tie is the entrepreneurial orientation that Don
Kelly brought to Beatrice for those of us who worked for him.''
   Lindblad, 48, said he and Snodgrass absorbed lessons in
conglomerate-building during their 15 years of working together
under Kelly.
   ``We have both done a lot of acquisitions and corporate
divestment work in that period of time and it can't help but have
some rub-off,'' he said.
   Snodgrass and Lindblad stayed with Esmark for about a year after
Beatrice acquired it for $2.8 billion in 1984, leaving Kelly on the
outside.
   In 1986, Kelly won a takeover of Beatrice, taking the company
private in a $6.2 billion deal backed by the New York buyout firm
Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. Snodgrass and Lindblad came back on
board later that year.
   Snodgrass served as executive vice president of BCI Holdings
Corp. and president of Beatrice Consumer Durables Group, a non-food
division that went public as a part of E-II in 1987 with Stiffel as
one of its holdings. Kelly made Snodgrass president and chief
executive officer of E-II Consumer Products Co., E-II's major
operating subsidiary.
   Lindblad served with Snodgrass as senior vice president and
chief financial officer of E-II Consumer Products. Before that, he
held the same titles in the Beatrice Consumer Durables Group.

<HEAD>California's Other Big Thrifts Stronger than American, Experts Say</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE GARTIES</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The $2 billion federally-assisted bailout of
American Savings & Loan Association will not be the last such
rescue in California, home to 13 of the nation's 20 biggest S&Ls,
but experts said most of the state's large thrifts are in far
better shape than American.
   The trouble at American, object of a bailout announced Monday,
is more an indication of poor management and lax regulation than a
sign that California thrifts overall are especially endangered,
analysts said Tuesday.
   However, as in the industry nationwide, more mergers and buyouts
are expected among the state's thrifts, particularly smaller
institutions that proliferated in the wake of deregulation in the
early 1980s.
   ``I think there's a trend toward consolidation,'' said William
Davis, chief deputy commissioner of the California Department of
Savings and Loans. ``We have what I would consider to be an
overcapacity in terms of the number of institutions to serve the
public in California.''
   Stockton-based American, the nation's biggest insolvent thrift
and second-largest overall, will be acquired by the Robert M. Bass
investment group of Fort Worth, Texas, under a rescue orchestrated
by the Federal Home Loan Bank Board.
   Bass will inject $550 million into American and the bank board
will put up $500 million in notes and an estimated $1.5 billion in
cash over the next 10 years. The bank board, which will own 30
percent of the new American, pumped $250 million into the company
Tuesday.
   The board also put American into a temporary receivership,
erasing the value of the 35.9 million shares of stock in
Irvine-based Financial Corp. of America, the holding company that
owned American.
   Business continued uninterrupted at American's 180 California
branches and federal insurance remained in force for all deposits.
   William Popejoy, who has headed American and FCA since 1984,
will leave FCA but remain at the helm of American, according to
announcements by the bank board and the company.
   FCA directors scheduled a meeting for today to determine the
company's future.
   American is the nation's second-biggest S&L, with more than $30
billion in assets. California boasts 13 of the country's 20 S&Ls
ranked by assets, including No. 1 Home Savings of America.
   California also is home to 14 S&Ls troubled enough to be under
direct supervision of the bank board, and others that are being
monitored for possible future action. Additionally, 12 California
thrifts have been sold or combined with stronger institutions since
1985, according to the bank board's San Francisco office.
   Most analysts emphasize that the problem institutions represent
a minority of the industry nationwide: In California, the 14
institutions under control of regulators have combined assets of
$4.6 billion, while statewide industry assets total $350 billion.
   American foundered, analysts said, largely because of too-rapid
growth and millions of dollars in loans on real estate in
California, Texas and elsewhere that other institutions would not
touch. In contrast, other big S&Ls lean far more heavily on
so-called quality mortgages, those on single family homes.
   ``By and large, the people running the major savings and loans
in the state have gone through a number of cycles and on the whole
are pretty conservative people,'' said Donald Crowley, who follows
the industry for Keefe, Bruyette and Woods Inc. in San Francisco.
   The California industry is on a stronger footing than that in
Texas and Oklahoma, where the collapse of oil-dependent economies
has been followed by wholesale S&L bailouts, analysts said.
California, they said, continues enjoying a housing boom that has
continued essentially unchecked since the 1950s and largely is
responsible for growth of the state's huge thrifts.
   ``It's sort of like the difference between standing on rock and
standing on quicksand,'' Crowley said, comparing the economies that
support S&Ls in California and the oil patch.

<TEXT>
   Beryl W. Sprinkel, chairman of President Reagan's
Council of Economic Advisers, praised the U.S. and Japanese
economies Wednesday and said most trade issues had been resolved.
   Sprinkel predicted that inflation in the United States ``will
continue restrained'' and said he was ``pleased to note'' the
Japanese policy of encouraging domestic demand to lower exports and
reduce trade imbalances.
   The top U.S. economic adviser was in Japan for meetings with
economists and Japanese government officials, including Prime
Minister Noboru Takeshita, Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa and
Bank of Japan Governor Satoshi Sumita.
   Fielding questions at a news conference, Sprinkel declined to
comment on the dollar's recent strength in foreign exchange
markets, saying to comment would affect the market.
   When asked about the Bank of Japan's lack of participation in
recent interest rate increases by the U.S. Federal Reserve Board
and European central banks, Sprinkel cited Japan's almost-zero
inflation rate.
   ``I'm not about to second-guess the decision of the Bank of
Japan not to raise the discount rate when they have the lowest
inflation in the world,'' he said.
   Sprinkel said ``good economic relations'' between Japan and the
United States had led to resolution of major trade issues recently.
Those include disputes over U.S. beef and citrus imports to Japan
and U.S. firms having access to bid on construction projects in
Japan.
   ``We do not believe that will be the end,'' he said, adding he
hoped to see further measures to eliminate controls in Japan's
economy.

Administration beginning December 1989, Boeing said Tuesday.
   The jets will be equipped with Rolls-Royce RB211-535E4 engines
and configured to carry 200 passengers.
   CAAC Guangzhou will use the planes on its high-density routes to
Beijing, Shanghai and Guilin.
   Total orders for 757s have reached 368 from 23 operators

   Stock prices were broadly lower at midday
Wednesday as sentiment was depressed by a continued lack of
institutional interest.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index was down 12.7
points, or 0.7 percent, at 1,755.3 at about 12:30 p.m. local time.
   Dealers said prices were marked lower in what was called a
technical reaction to the solid gains of recent days, which also
came amid low trading volume.
   ``The last couple of days have been a false market,'' said one
dealer.
   In addition, weakness in the U.S. dollar sparked worries that
Wall Street might move lower later Wednesday. The New York market's
performance Tuesday gave little direction to London shares.
   Sharply lower crude oil prices triggered falls in oil shares,
with some dealers suggesting this pulled the overall market down.
   Volume was thin, with just 183.2 million shares changing hands
by midday.

<TEXT>
   The six oil ministers of the Gulf Cooperation
Council nations, four of whom represent key Arab nations in OPEC,
will meet next month to review ways of stabilizing the world oil
market, a government news agency reported Wednesday.
   The meeting is scheduled for Oct. 16, the Kuwait News Agency
said, but GCC officials, while acknowledging the ministers would
meet, declined to confirm the date.
   Earlier reports had said the meeting would take place Sept. 17
and 18.
   KUNA said production by the 13-nation Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries and the restoration of quota discipline would
be key topics at the GCC talks in advance of an OPEC ministerial
session scheduled for Nov. 21 in Vienna.
   The GCC includes Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Qatar and the United Arab
Emirates, which are OPEC members, and Bahrain and Oman, which are
not.
   KUNA said the four OPEC members would ``coordinate stands on a
number of issues of concern to OPEC ... especially with respect to
the future production level of OPEC and the necessity of member
states adhering to individual production quotas to guarantee
preservation of stability of the official price per barrel of oil
on the world market.''
   Overall OPEC production in August was estimated at 20 million
barrels a day, nearly 3.5 million barrels over its self-imposed
output ceiling. This has helped depress prices below OPEC's
benchmark of 18 dollars a barrel.
   The U.A.E. has refused to accept a quota of 948,000 barrels a
day and demanded a 1.5 million-barrel quota. That is about the
level of its current production.
   Kuwait, backed by Saudi Arabia, rejects Venezuela's wish to keep
condensate gases _ liquids condensed from natural gas during
production _ out of oil quotas.
   The GCC group, along with other OPEC members, hope to settle the
issue of production by Iraq and Iran now that their 8-year-old war
has ground to a halt.
   Tehran has reportedly rejected proposals that Iran and Iraq be
allotted equal production quotas in a bid to curb Iraq's unbridled
output of around 2.8 million barrels a day.
   Iraq has refused to accept a quota of 1.5 million barrels a day
and demanded parity with Iran's 2.3 million-barrel quota.
   OPEC Secretary-General Subroto recently visited Baghdad and
Tehran and indicated that the issue could be solved through a
revamped OPEC production policy aimed at pushing up oil prices to
around $18 a barrel.
   Subroto has also visited other OPEC states, including Kuwait,
Saudi Arabia, the U.A.E. and Qatar.

<DATELINE>TURIN, Italy (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Fiat SpA said Wednesday that it boosted its
stake to a controlling 90 percent in Ferrari, the prestigious
manufacturer of luxury and sports cars.
   The auto giant, which is controlled by the Agnelli family, said
it acquired an additional 40 percent stake in Ferrari ``in the past
few months'' from Enzo Ferrari, the company founder and chairman
who died in August.
   Fiat acquired a 50 percent shareholding in Ferrari in 1959 but
had options to purchase up to 90 percent in the event of Enzo
Ferrari's death.
   The remaining 10 percent was left in the hands of Piero Lardi
Ferrari, Ferrari's son.
   A Fiat spokeswoman said the purchase of the additional 40
percent stake cost Fiat about 19 billion lire, or $13.5 million.
   Ferrari, which produces nearly 4,000 luxury and sports cars a
year, posted net profit of 14.8 billion lire, or $10.5 million, in
1987 on sales of 360 billion lire, or $257 million.
   Most Ferrari cars, including the popular Testarossa model, are
exported to the United States.

<HEAD>Ritzy Rolls-Royce Ruled a Lemon</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A $130,000 Rolls-Royce Corniche convertible
turned out to be a lemon, but a federal judge ruled the British
carmaker owes the Detroit lawyer who bought it only legal fees and
court costs _ no refund.
   Rolls wasn't privy to the contract A. Robert Zeffs signed with
the dealer, Tamaroff Buick of Southfield, U.S. District Judge Anna
Diggs Taylor ruled a week ago. She ordered Rolls to pay Zeffs
$55,307.77 in court fees and costs.
   Zeffs bought the 1981 Tudor red car in March 1983. It came with
300 miles on the odometer, an English leather interior, Circassian
walnut on the dash and a paint job advertised as glowing more like
marble than metal.
   But after Zeff added the car to his classic collection, he began
to notice problems with flaking paint.
   Repairs by Tamaroff were followed with complaints about
additional problems such as a nonworking gearshift indicator light.
   Zeff took the car to Florida in December 1983 and got
Rolls-Royce and a Palm Beach dealer into the picture.
   Finally, a Rolls official commissioned a new finish for the car,
to be done in Florida. The Corniche's 14 to 20 coats of paint,
primer and filler were removed to bare metal, but without Zeff's
consent.
   When he learned of the job, he told Rolls, in effect, to keep
the car. He wanted his money back.
   Because the car was inadequate to start with and a proper
refinishing could only be completed in England, Taylor found that
Rolls had violated its limited warranty and committed fraud.
   However, Zeff could not sue Rolls alone to revoke his acceptance
of the car because he bought it from Tamaroff, Taylor ruled.
   Because the judge ordered Rolls to pay Tamaroff's legal bills,
too, the dealership feels vindicated, said Tamaroff General Manager
Tony Jerome.
   ``We weren't the problem,'' Jerome said.
   Zeff, meanwhile, said he expects Rolls to keep the case alive.
   ``I can't see them not appealing this,'' he said. ``They can't
let a judgment of fraud stand.''

<HEAD>Hearing Held in Hong Kong Courts on U.S. Insider Trading Case</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HONG KONG (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two companies allegedly controlled by the
Taiwanese businessman charged with insider trading in the United
States asked a judge Wednesday for release of $12 million from
their Hong Kong bank accounts.
   Standard Chartered PLC, a British bank, has refused to release
the deposits at its local branch claiming the money was paid to
U.S. authorities last month to comply with a New York court order,
attorneys for the bank said.
   Taiwanese businessman Fred C. Lee was charged by the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission in June with trading on inside
information allegedly provided by Stephen Wang, an analyst at the
New York investment bank Morgan Stanley & Co.
   The two men allegedly made $19 million from illegal trading.
   The court hearing was scheduled to continue Thursday.
   Lee is president of Nanus Asia Co. and Southridge International
Inc., two companies based in the British Virgin Islands, according
to solicitor Charles Wong.
   In a hearing before Hong Kong Supreme Court Justice Gordon
Cruden, a lawyer for the two companies argued that the New York
court order was not enforceable in Hong Kong and that the bank
should pay them the money in their accounts.
   ``The New York orders have no effect whatsoever on the
plaintiffs' right to have their money back,'' attorney Martin Lee
said. ``The accounts were opened in Hong Kong and Hong Kong law is
clearly the proper law.''
   Lee also argued that if the Hong Kong court failed to order
Standard Chartered to hand over the companies' funds, overseas
investors would lose confidence in the British colony's banking
system.
   Arguing for Standard Chartered, attorney Michael Thomas said the
bank couldn't turn the deposits over to Nanus and Southridge
because the charges of insider trading filed against Lee indicated
the funds may have been obtained through a breach of trust and
therefore did not legally belong to the Taiwanese businessman.
   Thomas said that if Standard Chartered had turned the money over
to the two companies instead of the U.S. court, the bank could have
become liable for claims from any victim of alleged insider trading.
   Standard Chartered ``has been caught up in a certain amount of
crossfire'' between courts in the United States and Hong Kong,
Thomas said, adding that there was a ``serious risk'' of the bank
falling victim to double jeopardy.
   Thomas said funds held in the name of Nanus and Southridge had
been treated as belonging to Lee because the companies were
``incorporated cash boxes'' serving solely as the businessman's
nominees.
   Quoting from the testimony of a Standard Chartered officer,
Thomas said that prior to opening the company accounts, Lee had
used a number of personal accounts to finance his U.S. securities
trading.
   Lee did not appear in court. One of his solicitors said the
businessman was in Taiwan.

   The 43,000 white marble panels covering the
outside of the 80-story Amoco Corp. headquarters building will
temporarily be strapped down until tests determine if they must be
replaced because of buckling, officials say.
   After a buckling problem was revealed in March, the company
attached a pair of two-inch stainless steel straps to each panel on
the southwest corner of the skyscraper.
   That corner experiences the toughest beating from wind and
weather changes, and buckling found in some panels caused concern
they could fall off, officials have said.
   Some architects said that all building panels would have to be
replaced, but Amoco officials said they want more time to find a
solution.
   ``If the building is to be re-clad, it will be covered with a
material as close to the color of the original marble as we can
get,'' said Shelby Pierce, Amoco's manager of engineering in charge
of the project.
   Some materials the company might consider are granite, a heavier
marble or aluminum, officials said.
   ``Right now, we plan to keep all of our options open,'' said
Pierce. ``We'll strap the building, get the test results, evaluate
them, and then decide what's the best long-term solution. The
building does not pose a short-term safety problem.''
   The straps are not visible to the casual observer, Thompson said.

   The stock market advanced broadly today as
inflation worries and interest rates continued to subside.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 9.24 to 2,074.50 in
the first half hour of trading.
   Gainers outnumbered losers by more than 5 to 2 in the overall
tally of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 720 up, 261
down and 461 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 25.45 million shares as of 10
a.m. on Wall Street.
   In the credit markets, prices of long-term government bonds fell
more than $5 for each $1,000 in face value, putting their yields at
around the 9 percent level.
   And stock prices continued the rally they began late last week,
when monthly statistics on the employment situation showed slower
job growth.
   Stock-market bulls hope more economic data in the weeks ahead
will support the belief that growth has slowed of late, reducing
upward pressure on inflation and interest rates.
   Inflationary expectations also have been cooled this week by
falling oil prices.
   Gainers among the blue chips today included McDonald's, up } at

<HEAD>Organized Labor Splits Over Boycotting State Job Program</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOURNEMOUTH, England (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Overriding the wishes of their
leadership, trade union delegates Wednesday voted narrowly to
boycott a new government program to train the unemployed for other
jobs.
   The vote at the annual conference of the Trades Union Congress,
the umbrella organization of 84 trade unions, was 4.577 million to
4.042 million, a tiny margin that reflected the split in British
organized labor over the controversial government program. Union
chiefs wield huge voting blocks based on membership.
   Neil Kinnock, leader of the opposition Labor Party, had joined
the TUC leadership in appealing against a boycott, saying it would
portray the labor movement as uncaring about the jobless.
   But the pro-boycott camp claimed that the 1.5-billion-pound
($2.55 billion) Employment Training Scheme launched Monday was
designed to exploit the jobless as cheap labor.
   Persons joining the program will get a weekly bonus of 10 to 20
pounds ($17 to $34 dollars) a week on top of their unemployment
checks, plus money for books, transport and equipment, and a
tax-free 200-pound ($340-dollar) bonus if they complete the
six-month course.
   The basic weekly unemployment payment is 32.75 pounds ($55.60),
plus subsidized rent. The new program is aimed primarily at
retraining the 600,000 long-term unemployed among Britain's 2.3
million jobless.
   Supporting a boycott, Ron Todd, leader of the transport workers'
union, said: ``The government is looking for a hole to hide half a
million unemployed, to remove them from the unemployment court
before the next election.''
   Engineers' union president Bill Jordan backed the program,
saying it was imperfect but ``the only one we have got.''
   ``We have no alternative to offer the unemployed _ no training
to offer, no jobs to offer, only our help. We cannot turn round and
say that we, the trade union barons, decree that you cannot join
these schemes,'' said Jordan.
   The resolution adopted at the week-long conference in this
seaside resort called for an immediate boycott, but the TUC
leadership later said it would take effect over two years to
accommodate unions already cooperating with retraining programs.
   Some intepreted the vote as a slap to Kinnock, especially since
the pro-boycott lobby included powerful union chiefs such as Todd,
whom Kinnock is counting on to back him against a challenge to his
leadership at next month's Labor Party convention.
   But Kinnock said the two-year stay of execution would allow
unions to press for improvements.
   The vote was ``not a bad result at all,'' he told reporters.
``These two years can have a very productive outcome.''

<HEAD>Justice Department Doesn't Object to Democrat Participation</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal attorneys say they have no objection
to limited participation by the Arkansas Democrat in a court case
involving a proposed joint operating agreement between Detroit's
two daily newspapers.
   In a court filing Tuesday, attorneys for the civil division of
the Justice Department said the department did not object to
participation by Little Rock Newspapers Inc., the company that
publishes the Democrat, provided that participation is limited to
issues already raised.
   But the attorneys asked that an affidavit submitted by Democrat
publisher Walter E. Hussman Jr. be stricken from the record because
it goes ``beyond the scope of this case.''
   At issue in the litigation is an injunction issued Aug. 17 by
U.S. District Judge Joyce Hens Green that bars a joint operating
agreement between The Detroit News, owned by the Gannett Co., and
the Detroit Free Press, owned by Knight-Ridder.
   Gannett owns the Arkansas Gazette, the Democrat's competition in
Little Rock. The Democrat last week submitted a brief in the
Detroit case as a party with an indirect interest in the outcome,
arguing against the JOA.
   Attorneys for the Detroit News last week urged the federal court
to ignore the Democrat's arguments, saying the brief by Little Rock
Newspapers wasn't filed on time, raised questions outside the scope
of the case, and would involve the court in an analysis of pricing
practices by the two Little Rock newspapers.
   Hussman said the company he heads filed the brief because he
believes Gannett is trying to stifle competition in newspaper
markets through the use of JOAs.
   Hussman's affidavit contended approval by Meese of the Detroit
JOA altered the nature of such agreements ``from a vehicle for
preserving journalistic competition where it would otherwise not
exist into a vehicle to assist in eliminating competitive
newspapers even where both newspapers could otherwise survive.''
   According to the Justice Department brief, Little Rock
Newspapers' filings show the company ``seeks to address legal and
factual issues well beyond the scope of this litigation, including
matters pertaining to what it portrays as the competition between
its newspaper, the Arkansas Democrat, with the Arkansas Gazette,
owned by Gannett.''
   ``These matters have no bearing on this case and the facts which
Little Rock Newspapers seeks to introduce form no part of the
administrative record,'' the brief said.
   The Detroit JOA, approved by former Attorney General Edwin Meese
on Aug. 8, would be the largest such agreement in history. The
temporary injunction against the agreement was requested by
Michigan Citizens for an Independent Press, a group of advertisers,
readers and employees.
   The agreement would merge the production and business operations
of the News and Free Press, while keeping the newspapers' news and
editorial departments separate.
   The Newspaper Preservation Act allows such partial mergers when
one of the newspapers involved is in danger of failing.

   Market pessimism about OPEC's ability to
restrain its production has pushed oil futures prices to nearly a
two-year low, but experts say American drivers should see little
benefit at the gas pump because of strong demand for the refined
product.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange today, the October contract
for delivery of West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark grade of
U.S. crude, was down 9 cents a barrel at $14.15 at late morning.
The contract dropped 55 cents a barrel on Tuesday. Crude prices
have not traded that low on the exchange since October 1986, when
they reached $13.73 per barrel.
   Responding to the drop, several major U.S. oil companies
announced Tuesday and today that they were cutting the official
price they pay for West Texas Intermediate in the spot market.
   Futures contracts for refined oil products traded on the
exchange also continued Tuesday's decline. Wholesale unleaded
gasoline for October delivery had fallen 0.33 cent a gallon to
42.20 cents at late morning, while wholesale heating oil for
October was down 0.23 cent at 41.48.
   The market's skepticism about the ability of the 13-nation
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries to trim its output
has deepened in recent days, after initial optimism about
cooperation within the cartel resulting from the cease-fire between
members Iran and Iraq.
   OPEC Secretary-General Subroto recently capped off a series of
meetings with oil producers by visiting officials in Iran and Iraq,
and tried to persuade Iran to allow Iraq a higher production quota.
But Subroto made little headway in his efforts to win cooperation
among OPEC members for curbing overall output.
   ``There just doesn't seem to be any hope right now,'' said Linda
Simard, an oil futures broker at the investment firm Drexel Burnham
Lambert Inc. ``Subroto didn't seem to be getting anywhere.''
   The Middle East Economic Survey, an influential weekly published
in Nicosia, Cyprus, reported last week that total OPEC production
was estimated at 20 million barrels a day, more than 3.5 million
barrels over the cartel's official ceiling.
   The cease-fire between the Persian Gulf rivals after eight years
of fighting frees Iran and Iraq to rebuild their war-damaged oil
industries, raising the prospect of a fresh surge in oil production
and a fall in crude prices.
   A key to controlling any increased production, analysts say, is
OPEC's ability to bring Iraq back under its discipline.
   Iraq during the war past ignored its OPEC daily production quota
of 1.54 million barrels, demanding a share equal to Iran's 2.37
million barrels a day. Iraq pumps an estimated 2.8 million barrels
a day, analysts say.
   ``There's too much oil right now. OPEC is showing a complete
lack of discipline,'' said Peter Beutel, assistant director of the
energy group at Elders Futures Inc.
   The price slide will not necessarily mean a break for drivers
filling up at the pump. While crude oil price declines often bring
price cuts in gasoline that is refined from crude, gasoline demand
now is unusually strong in the United States and supplies are
fairly tight, analysts say.
   ``We really don't expect a significant impact to be felt on
gasoline prices,'' said William Veno, director of oil market
analysis at Data Resources Inc., a consulting firm based in
Lexington, Mass.
   Several big oil refiners, meanwhile, cut the prices they are
willing to pay for West Texas Intermediate. Exxon Corp. and Chevron
Corp. reduced their posted price by 25 cents a barrel, to $14.50.
Texaco Inc., Sun Co., Phillips Petroleum Co., Marathon Petroleum
Corp., Diamond Shamrock R&M Inc., Conoco Inc. and Citgo Petroleum
Corp. lowered their postings for WTI by 50 cents a barrel, to $14.

   Grain and soybean futures opened mostly lower
today on the Chicago Board of Trade in a slight technical
correction after five straight days of rising prices, analysts said.
   Despite the early sell-off, experts said underlying fundamentals
remained bullish for the crop futures, especially for the wheat
market, which faces tightening world supplies.
   ``The floor leader is wheat,'' said Richard Feltes, director of
commodity research with Refco Inc., a large Chicago-based futures
brokerage firm.
   Wheat futures are approaching the year's highs set on July 5 and
many observers expect prices to rally through those levels.
   Soybeans and corn also may rally in the long term, but
increasing harvest pressure should keep a lid on those markets
during the next month or two, Feltes said.
   ``I think the mood of the (soybean) trade is described as
cautious near-term, bullish long-term,'' he said.
   In early trading, wheat was 1{ cents lower to \ cent higher with
the contract for delivery in September at $4.08 a bushel; corn was
1\ cents to 1} cents lower with September at $2.92\ a bushel; oats
were unchanged to 1{ cents higher with September at $2.72{ a
bushel; soybeans were 1\ cents to 6 cents lower with September at
$8.82 a bushel.
   Cattle futures were mostly lower while pork futures were higher
in early trading on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Live cattle were unchanged to .20 cent lower with October at
70.97 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .07 cent to .30 cent lower
with September at 81.00 cents a pound; hogs were .20 cent to .53
cent higher with October at 37.90 cents a pound; frozen pork
bellies were .40 cent to 1.15 cents higher with February at 47.20

   Livestock and meat futures settled lower on Tuesday.

   B.A.T Industries PLC said its profit after taxes
edged up 5 percent in the second quarter from a year earlier, with
its tobacco, paper and financial services divisions contributing
strong results but its retailing profits declining.
   B.A.T, a British conglomerate, last month won an eight-month

in Los Angeles. The British company paid $5.2 billion for Farmers.
   B.A.T reported Wednesday that its profit for the three months

period a year earlier.
   Earnings per share edged up to 16.81 pence, or 29 cents, from

   The company's retail division, which includes U.S. department

   Industrial designer J. Gordon
Lippincott says he and his wife of 51 years, Edith, often play a
game when they travel abroad.
   On the way in from the airport, they see how quickly they can
spot some corporate symbol that Lippincott had a hand in designing.
   The game seldom takes very long.
   The lanky, 79-year-old Lippincott, who left the consulting firm
that still bears his name 20 years ago for an assortment of other
pursuits, says he had a hand in developing symbols known the world
over for companies such as Coca-Cola Co., American Express Co.,
General Mills Inc. and Campbell Soup Co.
   But these days Lippincott recalls his firm's work on a car that
has all but disappeared from the landscape: His company helped with
the styling of the Tucker automobile 41 years ago. Only about 50 of
the models were ever built.
   Lippincott's role in the project surfaced as attention has been
drawn to the cars by the recently-released movie, ``Tucker: The Man
and His Dream.''
   Lippincott said his firm was about 4 years old when the aspiring
automaker Preston Tucker stopped by one morning in 1947. Tucker
wanted a professional design firm to help him ``style an auto for
the future,'' one that had an engine in the rear and safety
features like seat belts and pop-out windows and could travel 120
miles per hour.
   ``I didn't let on at first but, wow, did we ever,'' Lippincott
recalled recently as visitors pored over the scrapbooks he keeps at
the modern, breezy house he built 16 years ago on a 40-acre estate
beside the Farm River.
   ``In those days every designer wanted to design a car,'' he said.
   The movie recounts how Tucker developed the car and his travails
with the Securities and Exchange Commission over how he financed it.
   The movie makes no reference to outside designers, but
Lippincott said he doesn't mind. He liked the movie, adding that
actor Jeff Bridges ``did a good job of capturing Tucker's spirit''
in playing Tucker in the movie.
   Lippincott said Tucker already had a good idea of what he wanted
to do by the time he came by for help. He said Tucker's chief
designer, Alex Tremulis, had drawings and a small scale-model of
what the car would look like.
   It included a front headlamp that swiveled as the wheels were
turned.
   Lippincott said Tucker wanted some advice from a design firm on
the outer styling of the car. He said he never knew precisely what
led Tucker to the firm's midtown New York offices.
   Tucker showed up alone. He brought no drawings of the car on
which a lot of work had already been done. He had no appointment.
   But Lippincott saw him anyway, and liked his brashness, his
self-assurance, his energy.
   ``He was an immensely likable and persuasive person,''
Lippincott said.
   Lippincott's partner, Walter Margulies, insisted on being paid
every week in advance, and Tucker agreed. The decision meant the
firm was one of the few associated with the automobile that made
money from the venture. Tucker lost more than $20 million making
the cars.
   Lippincott sent half of the office's 10 designers _ Hal
Bergstrom, Phil Egan, Read Viemeister, Bud Steinhilber and Tucker
Madawick _ to Chicago to work on the project. They created a
full-scale clay model in nine weeks beside another full-scale model
Tremulis was working on himself.
   Once the models were finished, Lippincott said it was left to
Tucker and Tremulis to assemble the prototype and the cars
themselves. Lippincott's involvement was over.
   There is some disagreement about the extent of the Lippincott
contribution to the final version.
   Lippincott said his team's contribution is evident in the
styling in the both the front and back of the car, but conceded it
is hard to pinpoint responsibility when many designers have a hand
in a project.
   Tremulis, who lives in California, said the design team was good
but that the car was 95 percent complete before the outside team
began working on it.
   Egan, who was part of the Lippincott team and later returned to
work for Tremulis on interior design, said from his home in
California that Tremulis deserves most of the credit for the car
design but said the front and back of the car reflect the
Lippincott team's work.
   Lippincott's design advice was avidly sought by companies
ranging from flashlight producers to steel-making giants. He helped
Chrysler Corp. with a corporate logo years later. He sold his
interest in Lippincott & Margulies in the late 1960s.
   He said he learned his most important design lesson in the
mid-40s, when the Bacardi rum makers asked his firm to redesign
their label.
   The firm proposed a festive approach that used a different color
for each letter of the name.
   Lippincott said family politely listened to the presentation,
but offered no response. Pressed for a reaction, the head of the
family said it had been ``most helpful.''
   ``We have gone to the best package designer in the United
States, and you have confirmed my belief that we should not change
our label,'' the man said.
   Lippincott said the lesson was clear and he never forgot it:
``When you have an entrenched brand identity, proceed with great
caution.''

   What has the surge of American exports
meant to Tom Collier, who runs a small company that makes and sells
screws?
   ``I'm taking aspirins every day now,'' he said.
   But he's not complaining. His company, Cam-Tech Industries Inc.,
has doubled its sales this year, increased its employment to 15
from 12 and ``become somebody'' in the world of international trade.
   At Sentry Group, a leading maker of fire-resistant safes and
containers, the boom has made a long-overdue foray into foreign
markets a resounding success. Sales there doubled last year and are
expected to triple this year, said company vice president Doug
Brush.
   ``Our international business has become our top priority,'' he
said.
   There are many similar stories in Rochester, which has become
one of the busiest export centers in the country and the leading
exporting city in New York.
   The city is the home of Eastman Kodak Co., the nation's
ninth-largest exporter, and other large exporters like Xerox Corp.,
which has its largest plant in the area, and Bausch & Lomb Inc.
   But it's the small to medium-size companies that get the most
gain from current economic conditions.
   ``It never ceases to amaze the number of new companies getting
into exporting,'' said Martin Wilner, of Leading Forwarders of
Rochester, a company that finds overseas shipping space for
exporters.
   ``I've been in the business 28 years and we are always coming up
with new clients, especially this year,'' Wilner said.
   Commerce Secretary C. William Verity said in July that for the
first five months of this year, American exports have jumped 31
percent compared with the same period in 1987.
   In June, the most recent month for which statistics are
available, the federal government said exports totaled $26.8
billion, the third highest monthly sales figure on record.
   Last year, Rochester and the surrounding area exported a record
$6.3 billion worth of products, which is more than the overall
totals from 30 different states.
   Only 10 states had higher export sales than Rochester last year.
California led the nation with $27.5 billion, followed by Texas at
$19.7 billion and New York at $15.5 billion.
   ``Exports are more than just a good thing or a nice thing,''
said Colby Chandler, Kodak's chairman and chief executive officer.
``I think it (the export boom) means that they're an integral part
of business, a vital part.''
   He said that the current business conditions and emphasis on
exporting and foreign trade in Rochester, and beyond, will ``not
turn backwards,'' because exporting and importing have become
household terms in business planning.
   Two sure signs that the exporting boom is in full force, at
least in Rochester, according to Fritz Grasberger, director of the
Center for Governmental Research, are an increase in workers
logging overtime and in a shortage of workers for low-paying jobs.
   ``Workers are in demand because manufacturers are trying to take
advantage of new opportunities overseas,'' said Grasberger, who
heads the not-for-profit, local research firm.
   The average work week in March in the Rochester area climbed to
a record 45.4 hours _ its highest level in at least 30 years. The
national average for hours worked in a week is about 39, Grasberger
said.
   ``This is the best economic environment I've ever seen,'' said
Bill Ramage, a labor economist at the state Labor Department in
Rochester. He's been following the Rochester economy since 1978.
   He said the area's manufacturers have stopped tightening their
belts and trimming work forces, partly because of the weak dollar,
and the area's service sector continues to grow.
   Kodak, Rochester's largest employer by far, offers a good
illustration of how the value of the dollar can affect Main Street
USA.
   When the dollar began to rise in the early part of this decade,
Kodak's profits were pared by lost pennies, and then nickels, and
then dimes, on nearly every roll of film it sold overseas.
   The dollar's rise meant Kodak would have to charge more money
for its products in foreign markets in order to make the same
profit, but raising prices in yen, marks, or pounds would send
customers away from Kodak film to competitors' brands.
   So, in an effort to hang onto its customers, Kodak didn't raise
prices and hoped the dollar wouldn't keep getting stronger and keep
costing the company money.
   ``From 1981 into early '86 we estimate that we lost $4 billion
in profits,'' said Kodak spokesman Henry Kaska.
   In addition, the company was forced to lay off more than 10,000
employees, nearly half of them in Rochester, and suffer the first
quarterly financial loss in company history.
   The cutbacks were difficult for this city to cope with,
especially since Rochester's conventional wisdom included that``a
job at Kodak was a job for life.''
   But in 1986, the dollar began to fall, and Kodak began making
more money from its overseas sales. Simply converting foreign
profits into dollars at more favorable exchange rates meant $90
million in extra profits in 1986; $195 million in 1987 and a
projected $260 million this year, if the dollar remains at its
current level.

   The giant Washington Public Power Supply
System fraud trial opened today as defense attorneys argued
unsuccessfully that the judge's trial rules would favor the
plaintiffs.
   Defense attorney Kenneth Kieffer took issue with a portion of
U.S. District Judge William Browning's trial protocol that says
once the examination of a witness has begun ``it will continue
until direct and cross-examination by all parties, on all issues
has concluded.''
   Keiffer said he feared the defense would be unable to put its
case in front of the jury in a logical manner if plaintiffs have
the ability to set the order in which witnesses will appear.
   Plaintiffs' attorney Tom Barr, representing Chemical Bank of New
York, noted the judge's protocol allowed an exception if the
witness elects to appear at the trial rather than be questioned via
a direct television hookup.
   Browning has allowed the use of a satellite hookup in the case
because many witnesses are in the Northwest. The judge denied the
defense motion asking for a change in the protocol.
   Browning has ordered that 20 jurors be seated in the trial,
which could last more than a year. Because it is a civil case, only
six jurors may eventually be called upon to issue a verdict. Jury
selection is scheduled to begin Thursday.
   The case, shifted for trial from Washington state to Tucson
because of pretrial publicity, arose out of the sale of $2.25
billion in bonds to build two nuclear power plants.
   The plants, WPPSS Nos. 4 and 5, were scrapped in January 1982
after being only partially built. In 1983, WPPSS defaulted on the
bonds after the Washington Supreme Court ruled most of the 88
Northwest public utilities investing in the projects had signed
illegal contracts with the power project consortium.
   The default, with 40,000 bond buyers left holding the bag, was
the biggest in the history of the municipal bond market. Of those
bond purchasers, more than 24,000 have filed claims, including
current bondholders represented by Chemical Bank of New York and
original buyers who retain a fraud claim though they have sold
their bonds.
   In addition to the number of plaintiffs, other big figures in
the case include the more than 100 attorneys, the length of time to
trial and legal fees preparing for trial: more than $150 million.
   The case could have been even bigger.
   Dozens of defendants, originally numbering more than 100, have
dropped out during the past year, with settlements totaling about
$350 million. Much of that was paid by insurance companies.
   Left are one Oregon and 20 Washington public utilities, which
own a 67 percent share in the two nuclear plants; two engineering
firms and a financial advisory firm.
   The 21 utilities serve about 650,000 customers, who would
possibly have to bear the brunt of a jury ruling against
defendants. Utilities representing 500,000 other homes in the
Northwest have settled.
   Settlements were being made almost up to the time of trial.
Holiday or not, an agreement between plaintiff attorneys and the
Seattle engineering firm of R.W. Beck was announced Labor Day by
settlement master Junius Hoffman, a University of Arizona law
professor appointed by Browning more than 18 months ago to try to
encourage settlements.
   The case also lacks some of the big money defendants in the
original lawsuits. Wall Street bond underwriters paid $92 million
to settle their share.
   The Bonneville Power Administration, a federal power marketing
agency in the Northwest, was reluctantly dropped from the case by
Browning. He said the law was clear that BPA officials had acted
properly in encouraging construction of WPPSS plants Nos. 4 and 5.
   WPPSS attempted to build five nuclear power plants in the 1970s
to serve Northwest customers. Of those, one plant, WPPSS No. 2 at
the Hanford nuclear reservation, is operating.
   Two others, WPPSS Nos. 1 and 3, were mothballed under
construction delays five years ago.
   Bonds sold to build those three plants are paid for through BPA.
However, plants Nos. 4 and 5 never enjoyed BPA protection.

   Stock prices flattened out today after an early
advance faded.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, up more than 10 points
in the early going, was down 4.45 at 2,060.81 by 2 p.m. on Wall
Street.
   Gainers slightly outnumbered losers in the overall tally of New
York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 687 up, 668 down and 524
unchanged.
   As the credit markets opened today, prices of long-term
government bonds fell more than $5 for each $1,000 in face value,
putting their yields at around the 9 percent level.
   And stock prices continued the rally they began late last week,
when monthly statistics on the employment situation showed slower
job growth.
   But both stocks and bonds later gave back some of their early
gains amid signs that the markets had not yet shaken off their
summer malaise.
   Stock-market bulls hope that more economic data in the weeks
ahead will support the belief that growth has slowed of late,
reducing upward pressure on inflation and interest rates.
   Recent weakness in oil prices kept the pressure on energy
issues. Atlantic Richfield dropped 1[ to 80[; Mobil \ to 42{; Amoco
1[ to 73[; Exxon | to 46, and Schlumberger 1\ to 31\.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks lost
.17 to 150.03. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was down .83 at 295.76.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 101.38 million shares with two
hours to go.

   Getting a banker to sign what essentially is a ``standstill
agreement'' is dicey, because the banking community staunchly
resists becoming involved in exclusive arrangements.
   ``It's extremely difficult to get them to sit on their hands
because they're all looking for business, and they're not satisfied
to do business with just one company because tomorrow they'll be
out on the street looking for more'' deals, said Katarincic, the
lawyer.
   Amoco Corp. Vice Chairman James Cozad, who sits on USG's board,
noted that the ``acquisition and leveraged buyout business ... has
been a financial bonanza for investment banks. Obviously the desire
or opportunity to make substantial profits puts a lot of pressure
on ethics.''
   Investment bankers bristle at the suggestion their moral fiber
may be compromised.
   ``Bankers have been hammered at for quite some time for being
fee chasers, but the critics lose sight of the fact that we are in
the client business, and our integrity and credibility are the
things we sell,'' said one investment banker, who asked not to be
identified because of the sensitivity of the issue. ``We'll have a
short life if we get a reputation of not honoring our commitments.''
   Investment bankers also argue that a good portion of the
information they get from a company is in the public domain anyway.
   But in addition to crucial non-public information, talks with
company executives provide bankers with a more subjective view of a
company _ their market position, their own assessments of their
business strategy and personnel, their own valuation of assets.
   ``There's nothing like speaking to a CEO and hearing what's
really going on,'' said securities lawyer Paul Fischer. ``A
half-hour conversation can be very illuminating.''
   As Amoco's Cozad can attest, ``In certain instances (investment
banks) need a lot of private information, and that information
indeed would be of great benefit to somebody outside our company.''
   Besides investment firms, commercial banks are surfacing more
frequently in M&A deals as they try to expand beyond their
traditional yet decreasingly profitable role as lenders.
   This new set of players has outraged some companies. Interco
Inc., for example, assailed Chase Manhattan Bank in August for
agreeing to help finance a hostile takeover bid.
   Chase had served as Interco's primary international banker and
had participated with other banks in providing the company with a
$150 million revolving credit agreement, among other services.
While Interco did not file a lawsuit, a spokeswoman said the
company feels ``abandoned'' by Chase and is in the process of
severing its ties with the bank.
   Banks and investment firms are not the only alleged culprits.
Lawyers have also been accused of using confidential information
about previous clients. Earlier this year, Murray Ohio
Manufacturing Co. found itself the target of a hostile bid by AB
Electrolux of Sweden. Advising Electrolux was the New York law firm
Sullivan & Cromwell, the same firm that helped Murray Ohio fashion
its anti-takeover strategy a year earlier.
   John L. Duncan, Murray Ohio's president and chief executive
officer, said in a court hearing that he learned about Sullivan &
Cromwell's involvement when he received a letter from Electrolux on
the law firm's stationery.
   ``I was absolutely shocked. I couldn't believe that they would
be representing Electrolux,'' he said.
   While a three-judge panel agreed Sullivan & Cromwell had a
conflict of interest, it ruled there had been no transfer of
confidential information.
   The conflict problem takes a new twist when advisers take equity
positions in companies and becoming investors themselves.
   Koppers Co. spearheaded a public campaign against Shearson
earlier this year because the investment house was participating as
an equity partner in a hostile bid with Britain's Beazer PLC.
   Officials from Pennsylvania rallied round and terminated what
they said amounted to a $7 billion business relationship with
Shearson. Ultimately the Pittsburgh-based company agreed to be
acquired by Beazer for $1.8 billion.
   Katarincic, who represented Koppers, called it a ``casebook
situation'' that already has had an impact.
   ``I know a number of deals where people were thinking of taking
an equity position in hostile tender offers who have backed away''
in the wake of Koppers' confrontation, he said.
   To avoid conflicts in mergers and acquisitions, securities
lawyer John Stoppelman suggests a ``code of professional
responsibility or ethics'' similar to what governs lawyers. He said
a code would establish benchmark standards to guide relationships
and therefore serve as a stronger test for liability.
   Congress is considering legislation, meanwhile, that would
shorten the length of time investors have to disclose significant
stakes in companies.
   Several executives said the recent high-profile confrontations
may be what is needed to send a warning signal to bankers.
   ``I don't know if it will deter them, but I think all investment
banking firms are becoming more sensitive to the issue'' of
conflicting interests, USG's Miller said.

<TEXT>
   A former junior securities analyst pleaded
guilty today to the first criminal charges stemming from what the
government has called the second-biggest insider trading scandal in
Wall Street history.
   Stephen Sui-Kuan Wang Jr., 24, a one-time intern of the
prominent brokerage Morgan Stanley & Co., also pleaded guilty to a
single charge in connection with his role in a previously
undisclosed insider trading scheme.
   Wang, wearing a charcoal gray suit and spectacles, entered his
guilty pleas before U.S. District Judge Kevin Duffy in Manhattan,
who set sentencing for Oct. 19. If convicted of all three counts,
Wang faces a maximum sentence of 15 years in prison and $750,000 in
fines.
   ``Was there any doubt in your mind that what you were doing was
wrong?'' Duffy asked Wang, who stood during the proceeding in
Manhattan federal court. He replied, ``There was no doubt in my
mind.''
   The charges were announced earlier today by U.S. Attorney
Rudolph W. Giuliani, who said that from June 1987 to July 1988,
Wang participated in an insider trading scheme with Taiwanese-born
businessman Fred C. Lee.
   Giuliani said the scheme involved trading in the securities of
more than 14 companies involved in mergers and takeovers where
Morgan Stanley played a role.
   Lee, who has residences in Taiwan, Hong Kong and the United
States, has been said by the Securities and Exchange Commission to
have traded stocks on the tips provided by Wang and netted at least
$19 million in illicit profits. He allegedly shared at least
$200,000 of the money with Wang.
   The SEC has frozen the assets of both men and sought repayment
of the $19 million plus triple damages for a total of $76 million.
That would be the second-largest amount seized by the SEC in an
insider trading case since master speculator Ivan Boesky
surrendered $100 million nearly two years ago.
   Giuliani also said that in addition to the scheme with Lee, Wang
was charged with participating in an earlier scheme to engage in
insider trading with an individual living in the Chicago area
starting in June 1986, when Wang started working at Morgan Stanley.
   The U.S. attorney declined to further identify the individual in
the second scheme but said the person was not one of Wang's
relatives.
   Giuliani said Wang would cooperate with the government and that
the investigation is continuing, an indication that others might be
charged.
   Earlier today, Wang pleaded innocent to one count each of mail
fraud, wire fraud and securities fraud before U.S. Magistrate
Barbara Lee in Manhattan, but the move was a technical prelude to
his subsequent guilty plea.
   Under federal criminal procedure, guilty pleas cannot be entered
before U.S. magistrates, and the move is often an indication that a
defendant has negotiated a plea agreement with prosecutors.
   The U.S. magistrate set Wang's bail at $250,000.

   Grain and soybean futures prices closed mixed
Wednesday on the Chicago Board of Trade as profit-taking and
harvest pressure weakened markets buoyed by rumors of new export
demand, analysts said.
   Wheat finished slightly higher but below the day's highs, which
matched the year's top prices for December and March deliveries.
Rumors that the Soviet Union had purchased 2 million metric tons of
subsidized U.S. wheat supported the market, analysts said.
   ``The wheat shows excellent strength _ it's acting very well,''
said John Frazier, grain specialist with Balfour Maclaine Corp. in
Chicago.
   Soybeans ended mixed due to pressure from the advancing harvest.
Many farmers are cleaning out their bins and selling last year's
soybeans to make room for the new crop, analysts said. Soybeans for
November delivery hit $9.05 a bushel during the session but closed
below $9.
   Corn finished mostly lower in the absence of influential news,
but rumors of export sales limited losses, Frazier said.
   At the close, wheat was 1\ cents to 2{ cents higher with the
contract for delivery in September at $4.12 a bushel; corn was 3
cents lower to } cent higher with September at $2.92 a bushel; oats
were unchanged to 1{ cents lower with September at $2.69{ a bushel;
soybeans were 5 cents lower to 9 cents higher with September at
$8.83 a bushel.

<HEAD>Irish Court Upholds Order Barring Share Sale</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Irish High Court on Wednesday confirmed an
injunction obtained by Pernod Ricard SA preventing FII Fyffes PLC
from disposing of its 20.04-percent holding in takeover target
Irish Distillers Group PLC.
   The High Court, sitting in Dublin, said it would reach a final
decision on the matter Oct. 6.
   Irish Distillers, Ireland's largest distiller, is the target of
competing takeover offers from friendly suitor Pernod Ricard, a
French liquor concern, and hostile bidder Grand Metropolitan PLC, a
British liquor company.
   Grand Metropolitan has made a sweetened offer of 332 million
Irish punts, the equivalent of $479 million, or 525 Irish pence a
share for Irish Distillers.
   Pernod's offer, which has been approved by the Irish Distillers
board of directors, is for 285 million Irish punts, or 450 Irish
pence a share.
   The stake that FII Fyffes, an Irish fruit importer, holds in
Irish Distillers is seen as crucial to the outcome of the takeover
battle.
   Pernod claims a pledge by FII Fyffes last week to sell Pernod
its Irish Distillers shares should stand although Grand
Metropolitan subsequently came back with its higher offer.
   Irish Distillers said in a statement its shareholders should
know that if the high court upholds Pernod's injunction, the French
company will have above 50 percent of Irish Distillers' stock,
including the FII Fyffes stake.
   ``In the meantime, the board is not yet in a position to advise
shareholders as to what action they should take in connection with
their shares,'' Irish Distillers said.
   Irish Distillers stock shot up 49 pence to 415 pence a share on
London's Stock Exchange Wednesday afternoon after trading resumed
following a two-day suspension at Irish Distillers' request.
   Irish Distillers products include Irish whiskey brands
Jameson's, Powers, and Paddy.

<HEAD>Panel Says New Loans Won't Solve Third World Debt Problem</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Banks and debtor nations should renegotiate
existing loans rather than seek new ones to help ease the $1
trillion Third World debt problem, a panel of top bankers,
economists and labor leaders urged in a report released Wednesday.
   The 39-page report by the Economic Policy Council of the United
Nations Association departs from the plan of former Treasury
Secretary James A. Baker III, which suggested pumping more money
into struggling nations to get them back on their feet and attract
foreign investments.
   The Baker Plan had helped bring more money into a number of less
developed countries over the past two years, but UNA panel said
that was mainly because interest rates were lower, making
debt-servicing costs more manageable.
   ``Large new-lending programs may be difficult to secure under
current market conditions,'' the report said.
   Many commercial banks have become reluctant to issue more loans
after some debtor countries, such as Brazil, stopped making loan
payments. Banks suffered huge losses last year after adding to
their loan-loss reserves to cover the shaky Third World debt.
   In addition, many banks are now faced with new capital adequacy
requirements, and ``a large block of problem loans to debtor
countries makes raising capital difficult and expensive,'' the
report noted.
   The report said restructuring loans so payments are reduced will
not only reduce outstanding claims against a country but aid in its
economic recovery.
   The report also urges debtor countries to undertake domestic
reforms to sustain economic growth.
   ``Economic success over a period of time also requires a level
of public confidence that grows out of efficient, uncorrupt
leadership and a political system that is reponsive to the popular
will,'' it said.
   Among its other suggestions, the UNA panel strongly urged
Congress to increase the U.S. contribution to the multinational
World Bank, which provides funding to Third World countries.
   The bank wants the United States to pledge about $70 million a
year over the next six years for a badly needed increase in its
capital. So far, about 140 of the 151 governments that own the bank
have decided to contribute.
   The UNA panel said talks should continue regularly between
multinational institutions like the World Bank, commercial banks
and debtor countries.
   ``It's been an impression ... that there is more and more debt
fatigue on the part of the key players,'' said Anthony Salomon,
former president of the New York Federal Reserve Bank and
co-chairman of the UNA panel. ``You will not see or hear one
concrete black-and-white plan.''
   Besides Salomon, others serving on the 27-member panel, which
began reviewing the international debt problem eight months ago,
included: Rodney Wagner, vice chairman of Morgan Guaranty Trust and
panel co-chairman; Tom Johnson, president of Chemical Bank; Pedro
Malan, executive director of the World Bank; Frederick Getzelman,
executive vice president of Philadelphia National Bank; Henry
Kaufman, economist and president of Henry Kaufman & Co.; and Albert
Shanker, president of the American Federation of Teacher AFL-CIO.

<TEXT>
   The New York Stock Exchange said Wednesday it
will be the first U.S. marketplace to offer trading in American
Depositary Receipts for foreign debt securities, beginning with
French Treasury bonds.
   American Depositary Receipts, or ADRs, are certificates issued
by U.S. banks that allow investors to buy foreign stocks with
dollars. This is the first time they have been used for debt
securities, the NYSE said.
   The Big Board said it expected the bonds to be listed by the end
of the month, pending regulatory approval, and said it expected
other foreign governments and corporations would follow suit.
   Credit Lyonnais in Paris is the custodian bank for the French
bonds, while its U.S. subsidiary CL GlobalPartners Securities Corp.
is marketing the American Depositary Receipts and Bank of New York
is the depositary bank.
   The New York Stock Exchange already offers 2,600 issues of bonds
with a par value of more than $32 billion, mostly corporate issues.
Some foreign government and corporate bonds are also traded, but
those are issues that were originally issued in the United States.

<TEXT>
   Campeau Corp. has agreed to sell all 76 of its
Gold Circle and Richway stores for more than $325 million, the
Toronto-based retailing and real estate company said Wednesday.
   The buyer, Kimco Development Corp., a privately held owner and
manager of shopping centers, said it has agreed to sell 31 of the
stores to Dayton Hudson Corp. and to lease 35 to Hills Department
Stores and two to K mart Corp.
   Buyers or operators are still being sought for the other eight
stores, according to Kimco, which is based in Roslyn, N.Y.
   The Gold Circle and Richway stores are part of Federated
Department Stores Inc., which Campeau bought in May for $8.8
billion.
   The sale does not include the warehouses and central offices,
which will be sold separately. The inventory of the stores will be
disposed of over the next 12 weeks.
   The stores being leased by Hills are in New York, Ohio and
Kentucky, while K mart is leasing a pair of stores in Ohio. The
stores being bought by Dayton Hudson are in Georgia, Florida, North
Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee and Kentucky. They are being
purchased by the Target Stores division of Dayton Hudson.
   Hills and Target said they would reopen the leased stores under
their own names by next spring.
   Campeau has been steadily selling assets to pay for the $8.8
billion purchase of Federated. It also owns Allied Stores Corp.,
which was bought in late 1986 for $3.4 billion.
   Among the units sold have been Filene's, Foley's, I. Magnin,
Bullock's-Bullock's Wilshire, Brooks Brothers and Filene's
Basement. Also on the auction block are Children's Place, Main
Street and Ann Taylor.

   The stock market eked out some small and
scattered gains today after an early advance faded.
   As the credit markets opened, prices of long-term government
bonds fell more than $5 for each $1,000 in face value, putting
their yields at around the 9 percent level.
   And stock prices continued the rally they began late last week,
when monthly statistics on the employment situation showed slower
job growth.
   But both stocks and bonds later gave back some of their early
gains amid signs that the markets had not yet shaken off their
summer malaise.
   Stock-market bulls hope that more economic data in the weeks
ahead will reinforce the belief that growth has slowed of late,
reducing upward pressure on inflation and interest rates.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Members of Congress expressed concern
Wednesday that America's electronics industry could suffer
irreparably if it is left behind in the race to develop a new
high-quality television system.
   The result, they said, could cost the country in many ways _ an
even higher trade deficit and thousands of jobs lost, as well as
the loss of potential military, medical, consumer and other
applications that are expected to come with development of the
technology.
   Rep. Edward J. Markey, D-Mass., chairman of the
telecommunications subcommittee, asked electronics industry trade
associations to submit reports to the panel by January outlining
steps the government could take to ensure American involvement in
high-definition TV.
   Suggestions have ranged from antitrust exemptions for U.S.
companies involved in research and development on high-definition
TV to appropriating Pentagon funds for research on it because of
the potential military applications of the technology, he said.
   Over the last decade, the United States has shifted from a major
supplier to a net importer of electronics products, he noted.
   ``HDTV could make a bad situation worse,'' Markey said at the
final of three hearings on high-definition TV, called HDTV.
   High-definition TV produces clearer, brighter images on a wider
TV screen with high-quality sound. The Japanese have been
developing HDTV for nearly 20 years and the Europeans have been
working on their own system for several years. Both systems are
incompatible with U.S. television broadcasting.
   The Federal Communications Commission last week set preliminary
guidelines that will allow research to proceed toward establishing
an American HDTV system. Under the FCC guidelines, a U.S. system
must be able to be received on existing TV sets so current
equipment would not become obsolete. But to receive improved
picture quality, viewers would have to buy a new TV set.
   Richard Elkus Jr., chairman of the Prometrix Corp. and
testifying for the American Electronics Association, said advanced
TV offers the U.S. electronics industry an opportunity to rebound
in a market projected to reach $20 billion in U.S. sales and $40
billion worldwide by the year 2007.
   It also will have ripple effects in other areas, he said. For
example, HDTV products will use a large supply of advanced
semiconductors and HDTV will have applications in military and
medical fields, he said in testimony submitted to the panel.
   He added, however, that regardless of what standard the United
States selects, it won't stop the Japanese from entering the U.S.
market.
   More important than selecting a standard, he said, is government
and industry coming up with a strategy to put American companies
back on the electronics manufacturing track and to develop
marketing and distribition systems that will rival the Japanese.
   About 20 advanced-TV systems are under development and competing
to be designated as the U.S. HDTV standard.
   Richard Wiley, a former FCC chairman and chairman of the FCC's
advisory committee on advanced TV technologies, said his panel's
testing of the systems could begin by the end of the year and will
take a year and a half to complete.
   ``This is not going to be something you're going to solve
overnight,'' he said referring to the selection of a standard
system, the involvement of U.S. electronics companies in the
emerging industry and the gradual replacement of TV sets by
American viewers.
   Wiley estimated that the United States had ``a year or two'' to
establish a national HDTV policy, but Markey said, ``I'm not as
optimistic as you are in the time we have before us.''

<HEAD>TWA Shareholders Approve Icahn's Plan; Pilots Sue to Block
Privatization</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARCY GORDON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Shareholders of Trans World Airlines Inc. on
Wednesday overwhelmingly approved Chairman Carl C. Icahn's proposal
to buy their shares and take the nation's seventh-largest airline
private.
   But opposition to the move mounted among TWA employees as the
3,300-member pilots union sued Icahn in New York State Supreme
Court to block the privatization.
   At a special meeting, TWA shareholders not affiliated with Icahn
voted 3,714,740 shares in favor of his privatization plan and
146,061 against. Icahn voted his shares with the majority, making a
final vote of 27,159,478 for and 146,061 against.
   The approval had been widely expected by financial analysts and
TWA employees.
   ``We've gone through quite a bit together,'' Icahn told
shareholders before the vote was taken. ``We of course were beset
by problems ... (but) I left my money in to keep the company
running.''
   Icahn, a wily takeover specialist who took the reins of TWA a
little more than two years ago, controls the airline through a
complex myriad of financial entities that own around 77 percent of
its 30.5 million common shares outstanding.
   He dropped a similar proposal to go private after last October's
stock market crash, then came back with a revised bid in April.
   Under the plan, shareholders not affiliated with Icahn would
receive for each share of common stock $20 in cash and $30 in face
amount of 12 percent notes due in 2008.
   Airline industry analysts estimate the bid puts a value of
around $40 a share, or $304.8 million, on the TWA shares that Icahn
doesn't already own. TWA stock closed at $36.75 Wednesday on the
New York Stock Exchange, up 37{ cents a share.
   Entities controlled by Icahn would receive, for each common
share, $20 in cash and a new issue of preferred stock and a
retained share of common stock.
   After completion of the transaction, expected in a month or so,
Icahn and the entities controlled by him would own about 90 percent
of TWA's stock. The remaining shares would be owned by an employee
stock ownership plan.
   TWA also has said that upon completion of the deal, it intends
to pay off at least $64.5 million of its $2.3 billion debt, and
seek the consent of holders of some preferred stock to eliminate
voting rights on that stock and to exchange other preferred issues
for 12 percent notes.
   Icahn said TWA will have about $1 billion in cash after the
deal, an unspecified portion of which will be used to purchase new
aircraft to upgrade the international carrier's fleet.
   At the start of the meeting, Capt. Thomas Ashwood, master
chairman of the TWA pilots union, attempted to serve Icahn with
legal papers related to the union's suit against the privatization.
The papers were accepted by TWA General Counsel Mark Buckstein as
some attending the meeting applauded.
   In its suit, the pilots union alleges that Icahn's plan to go
private is a breach of the agreements it made with him during his
takeover of the carrier. As part of those agreements, the pilots
accepted a 26 percent pay cut, work rule changes and other
concessions they say amount to $300 million over three years.
   The pilots are seeking an injunction blocking the privatization
and a court order enforcing their contracts.
   ``We won't stand idly by while Carl Icahn strips our airline of
assets and keeps it from growing financially stronger, from buying
airplanes and from improving service to our passengers because of
heavy debt,'' Ashwood said in a statement.
   The pilots' action intensified union opposition to Icahn's plan.
Last week, the union representing TWA flight attendants asked the
Department of Transportation to block the privatization and freeze
the airline's assets while it investigates Icahn's fitness to
continue managing the airline.
   The machinists and flight attendants at TWA also plan to file
lawsuits similar to that brought by the pilots union, Ashwood said.
   Icahn bristled at criticism leveled at him during the meeting by
a representative of the flight attendants.
   ``We will not be dictated to by employees concerning how to run
this airline,'' he said.
   After the meeting, Icahn told reporters he was disturbed by the
pilots' lawsuit.

   The dollar ended mixed against major currencies
Wednesday, losing ground against a rising Japanese yen, as
investors turned their attention to economic data due out later
this week.
   Gold prices also were mixed. Republic National Bank of New York
said gold was bid at $427.50 a troy ounce as of 4 p.m. EDT, up from
$426.60 late Tuesday.
   Currency analysts said activity in the foreign-exchange market
was focused on the yen after reports from Tokyo that the Japanese
economy is in danger of overheating. The yen strengthened in
overnight trading in Japan, continued in European trading and
closed near its highs of the day in New York.
   ``The market is taking it as a sign that Japan will be quick in
moving interest rates if the yen begins to weaken again,'' said
James T. McGroarty, an analyst at Discount Corp.
   Currency brokers said that Wednesday's rise in the dollar
against most other major currencies after a huge drop on Friday
reaffirmed that the summer-long rally in the U.S. currency is not
over. They said the dollar has now returned to a more realistic
trading range.
   On Friday, the dollar plunged after the government released
statistics showing unemployment rose in August. The report
suggested the economy was softening and that inflation pressures
could force the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates. Lower
interest rates make dollar-denominated securities less attractive
to foreign investors.
   Friday's selloff was followed by a further weakening of the
dollar in foreign markets Monday, while U.S. currency markets were
closed, and on Tuesday.
   ``It was a pause in the dollar's strength based on weaker
economic fundamentals,'' said Ronald Holzer, chief currency dealer
with Harris Trust & Co. ``Impressions that inflation will be stable
and therefore the economy is slowing down shouldn't hurt the
dollar, given that interest rates are still higher.''
   Analysts said investors were now awaiting new economic news due
out in the next several days. The Producer Price Index, an
important measure of inflation, is scheduled for release on Friday,
followed by the U.S. trade deficit figures due out next Wednesday.
   In Tokyo, where the business day ends before Europe's begins,
the dollar fell sharply to close at 134.30 yen, down 1.30 yen.
Later, in London, it was quoted at 133.67 yen. And in New York, the
dollar fell to 133.325 yen from 134.925 late Tuesday.
   In London, it cost $1.7060 to buy one pound, more expensive than
$1.7035 late Tuesday. Later in New York, it cost $1.7080 to buy one
pound, compared with Tuesday's rate of $1.70365.
   Other late-dollar rates in New York compared with levels late
Tuesday included: 1.84125 West German marks, up from 1.84015;
1.5530 Swiss francs, unchanged; 1.23755 Canadian dollars, up from
1.23405; 6.2760 French francs, up from 6.2695; 1,377.375 Italian
lire, down from 1,378.00.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Tuesday's
rates, included: 1.8435 West German marks, up from 1.8425; 1.5545
Swiss francs, up from 1.5525; 6.2795 French francs, up from 6.2715;
2.0810 Dutch guilders, down from 2.0820; 1,376.50 Italian lire,
down from 1,377.65; and 1.2392 Canadian dollars, up from 1.2340.
   Gold fell in London to a late bid price of $426.70 a troy ounce
from $428.10 bid late Tuesday. In Zurich, gold closed at a bid
$427.50, compared with $428 bid late Tuesday. Earlier, in Hong
Kong, gold rose $1.04 to close at a bid $430.19.
   But on the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold closed up at
$428.10 a troy ounce, compared with $426.70 late Tuesday.
   Silver bullion prices fell on the London market where the metal
was trading at a late bid price of $6.52 a troy ounce, compared
with Tuesday's $6.56.
   On the New York Comex, silver for current delivery rose to
$6.546 a troy ounce, compared with Tuesday's $6.485.

<HEAD>Coffee Futures Surge On Brazilian Drought Fears</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Coffee futures prices rose sharply for the second straight day
Wednesday on fears that a dry spell in Brazil could lengthen into a
drought in the world's largest coffee-producing nation.
   On other markets, cocoa futures were sharply lower; energy
futures were mixed; precious metals gained; livestock and meat
advanced; and grains and soybeans were mixed.
   The Brazilian drought talk that has driven up coffee futures
prices on New York's Coffee, Sugar & Cocoa Exchange may be
premature, but there was little other information to trade on
Wednesday, analysts said.
   Fears of drought damage have underpinned a dramatic rally in the
coffee market in the past month. Coffee for delivery in September
has risen more than 21 cents a pound since falling to about $1.08
in early August.
   But it's still fairly early to be worried about drought damage
to the Brazilian crop, said Sandra Kaul, an analyst with Shearson
Lehman Hutton Inc. in New York.
   ``To put this in perspective, in 1985, when drought trimmed the
crop back sharply, people had not begun to focus on the drought
until the second or third week of October and it wasn't until
Thanksgiving that they began noting damage to the crop,'' she said.
   But Kim Badenhop, an analyst with Merrill Lynch Capital Markets
Inc. in New York, said conditions were becoming a little more
critical as the coffee crop approaches its flowering stage.
   Badenhop said Brazil had an early, dry spring this year,
resulting in unusually low soil moisture.
   Brazilian weather conditions could continue to determine the
market's direction before the Sept. 19 opening of the International
Coffee Organization's semi-annual meeting in London.
   Coffee settled 3.32 cents to 3.79 cents higher with September at
$1.295 a pound.
   Cocoa futures skidded to new 12{-year lows on the Coffee, Sugar
& Cocoa Exchange as producer and consumer nation-members of the
International Cocoa Organization, meeting in London, began tackling
issues that threaten the existence of the price-support group.
   Cocoa was $20 to $28 lower with September at $1,173 a ton.
   Oil futures finished mixed on the New York Mercantile Exchange,
surprising many who had expected a continution of Tuesday's sharp
sell-off.
   Reports that Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates
had increased their crude-oil production last month caused panic
selling of futures Tuesday on fears that the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries was in complete disarray.
   But cooler heads prevailed Wednesday, said Michael Rothman,
senior energy analyst with Merrill Lynch Capital Markets Inc. in
New York.
   ``Almost everybody in OPEC ... is producing at their quota, so
you're not seeing a widespread erosion of discipline,'' he said.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 8 cents lower to 13
cents higher with October at $14.16 a barrel; heating oil was .09
cent lower to .07 cent higher with October at 41.63 cents a gallon;
unleaded gasoline was .13 cent lower to .10 cent higher with
October at 42.59 cents a gallon.
   The steadying of oil prices and the weakening of the dollar
contributed to a modest rally in precious metals futures on New
York's Commodity Exchange, analysts said.
   Gold settled 70 cents to $1.40 higher with October at $430.20 a
troy ounce; silver was 6 cents to 6.1 cents higher with September
at $6.546 a troy ounce.
   Livestock and meat futures posted strong gains on the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange in a technically inspired reversal of Tuesday's
steep losses, analysts said.
   Frozen pork bellies for August 1989 delivery advanced the

<HEAD>Gulf & Western Inc. Third-Quarter Profit Up 21 Percent</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gulf & Western said Wednesday its third-quarter
profit rose by 20.6 percent from a year earlier, led by strong
gains in its publishing and consumer finance units.
   Gulf & Western also announced it had adopted a shareholder
rights plan aimed at making any hostile takeover prohibitively
expensive, in order to protect the rights of its shareholders.
   For the three-month period ended July 31, Gulf & Western
reported its after-tax earnings were $123.8 million, or $1.30 a
share, up from $102.6 million, or 83 cents a share, in the same
period a year ago.
   The company said its revenue rose 8.3 percent to $1.3 billion in
the third quarter, from $1.2 billion in the year-earlier period.
   Gulf & Western said healthy gains in its publishing-information
and consumer and commercial finance units contributed strongly to
the third quarter gains. Its publishing-information services
include Simon & Schuster and Prentice Hall.
   The company said its entertainment division, which includes
Paramount Pictures, contributed significant operating income in the
period.
   For the first nine months of this year, Gulf & Western's net
earnings rose 6.9 percent to $240.2 million, or $2 per share, from
$224.6 million, or $1.81 a share, in the same period of 1987. Its
revenue during the same period totaled $3.6 billion, up 12.5
percent from $3.2 billion in the year-earlier period.
   Regarding the shareholder rights plan, Gulf & Western said it
was ``not aware of any effort to acquire the company'' but believed
the plan would help prevent an acquisition of the company ``at a
price not reflective of its fair value.''
   The ``poison pill'' takeover defense essentially would allow
Gulf & Western shareholders to purchase shares of a hostile
acquirer at a deep discount price, or to purchase Gulf & Western
shares at a discount if a hostile suitor acquired 15 percent or
more of the company's outstanding shares.

<HEAD>Former EPA Chief Named To Head Waste Disposal Company</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   William D. Ruckelshaus, who served two terms as
head of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, on Wednesday was
elected chairman of the board and chief executive officer of
Browning-Ferris Industries, Inc., one of the world's largest waste
disposal companies.
   Ruckelshaus has been on the Browning-Ferris board of directors
since June 1987. He succeeds Harry J. Phillips Sr., who will become
chairman of the Houston-based company's executive committee.
   Besides stints at the EPA, Ruckleshaus has been deputy attorney
general and acting director of the FBI. He also has served in the
House of Representatives of his home state of Indiana and as chief
counsel for the Indiana attorney general's office.
   ``This country is facing serious environmental problems in the
years ahead that will demand innovative, effective and efficient
solutions,'' Ruckelshaus said.
   ``BFI is well situated to participate in helping clean up our
nation's environment, and at the same time continue its impressive
record of growth.''
   Phillips, who held the top job at the company for 11 years, said
Browning-Ferris could benefit from fresh, new leadership and a
broader perspective.
   ``Our company and our industry has become more and more involved
in the public, political and regulatory arenas,'' he said.
   ``The ideal person to lead BFI in the days ahead should, in
addition to administrative and business skills, possess strong
talents, experience and comfort in dealing with issues within these
other, diverse arenas...an individual with a widely recognized
reputation of exceptional integrity.
   ``Given these characteristics, I felt that exactly the right
person to fill this position was Bill Ruckelshaus.''
   Browning-Ferris, whose revenue rose from $300 million to
approximately $2 billion annually during Phillips' tenure, has
subsidiaries that provide collection, transfer, processing,
recovery and disposal of solid wastes and chemical wastes for
commercial, industrial and governmental customers. It also provides
solid waste collection and disposal services for residential
customers.
   It has more than 18,000 employees who work at affiliates in 225
locations in the United States, Australia, Canada, Kuwait, Puerto
Rico, Saudi Arabia, Spain, the United Kingdom and Venezuela.

   U.S. monetary authorities sold $2.9 billion in
the foreign exchange markets to restrain the dollar's rise in the
May-July period, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York said
Wednesday.
   All of dollars were sold to buy West German marks, a currency
that was under heavy selling pressure during the period.
   The New York Fed said it did all of its dollar-selling in the
final 24 business days of the period, from June 27 to July 31, when
it intervened on 16 days in coordination with other central banks.
   During the three months, the dollar rose about 12 percent
against the mark, returning the dollar to its level of about a year
ago. The dollar also rose about 6.5 percent against the Japanese
yen and 9.8 percent against the British pound, but remained below
its year-ago levels against them.
   The New York Fed buys and sells currencies on behalf of both the
Federal Reserve and the Treasury Department.
   The bank does not comment on what it has done in the currency
markets since the end of the reporting period. It also does not
comment on the activities of other central banks.
   However, during the May-July period and in a number of trading
sessions since then there has been wide speculation in the markets
that the Fed and other central banks were intervening against the
dollar.

<HEAD>Drexel Burnham Lambert: From Also-Ran To Finance Revolutionary</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Insider Trading-Drexel</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A decade ago Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. was an
also-ran among investment banks, dismissed as an underachiever by
its stronger competitors.
   Today Drexel remains an outsider on Wall Street, but for a
different reason. The firm became one of the Street's biggest and
most aggressive firms by capitalizing on markets ignored by its
rivals, and in the process revolutionized corporate finance in
general and takeovers in particular.
   Now, Drexel is in trouble.
   The Securities and Exchange Commission said Wednesday it has
filed civil insider trading charges against Drexel and Michael
Milken, head of Drexel's junk bond trading unit.
   Drexel traces its roots to the founding of Burnham & Co. in
1935, although the pedigree of Drexel Firestone, which Burnham
acquired in 1973, goes back to the 1830s and once counted J.P.
Morgan among its partners.
   By the mid-1970s Drexel was languishing in the second tier of
investment banks when it decided to pursue a business largely
ignored by its competitors _ the market for ``junk bonds.''
   Junk bonds refer to corporate debt that credit-rating agencies
consider more speculative than top-ranked ``investment grade''
bonds with respect to the company's ability to meet the debt's
payments.
   Drexel did not invent junk bonds. But the junk bonds that were
around originally had been issued with a higher credit rating and
had since slipped to junk, ``fallen angel,'' status.
   Drexel's novel plan was to sell junk bonds as original issues,
and to reward investors who bought the bonds by paying them higher
yields than they could get on investment-grade securities.
   The junk-bond market then exploded, in large part because Drexel
cultivated ties with a stable of investors willing to buy the
securities. Companies, in turn, rushed to have Drexel sell their
junk bonds with the knowledge those investors stood as ready buyers.
   In addition, many companies avoided or were unable to borrow
huge sums because, despite being relatively healthy, they did not
qualify for an investment-grade rating. But Drexel specialized in
finding companies that could profitably support junk bonds even if
the credit-rating agencies deemed the securities to be below top
grade.
   Leading the Drexel underwriting effort was Frederick H. Joseph,
a relaxed, soft-spoken Boston native who was then head of corporate
finance and is now Drexel's chief executive.
   Drexel simultaneously became the premier trader of junk bonds
under the leadership of Michael R. Milken, a publicity-shy and
intense Californian who moved Drexel's junk-bond trading operation
to Beverly Hills from New York in 1977.
   The pair led Drexel to a near monopoly on the mushrooming
market. But it was not until the early 1980s that Drexel hit on the
idea that made it one of top investment banks and simultaneously
revolutionized the mergers and acquisitions business: Using junk
bonds to finance takeovers, particularly hostile ones.
   Suddenly, a bidder with relatively few dollars could go after a
multibillion-dollar company, armed with Drexel's ability to quickly
raise most of the financing by floating more junk bonds.
   ``Corporate raiders'' such as Carl Icahn, Sir James Goldsmith,
Saul Steinberg and T. Boone Pickens Jr. did just that by enlisting
Drexel's help, and by 1985 Drexel had become the most feared
investment bank in corporate America.
   Yet incumbent managers at many companies also used Drexel's
junk-bond expertise to finance leveraged buyouts, in which the
managers acquired the companies and took them private.
   The result is a junk-bond market that has burgeoned
dramatically, to $159 billion in 1987 from $24 billion in 1977. It
grew 27 percent last year, from $125 billion in 1986, in spite of
unfavorable publicity.
   Along the way, Drexel has earned enormous fees for underwriting
and trading junk bonds and for its takeover advice.
   Drexel's capital as of Dec. 31, 1987, totaled nearly $2.2
billion, up from $1.8 billion the previous year and up more than
tenfold from 1981. That made the privately held company the fifth
largest firm on Wall Street.
   Although Drexel still is the dominant player in junk bonds, the
market's huge growth drew competition from other investment banks.
   Drexel's influence in the takeover game began to diminish
somewhat amid the insider-trading scandal on Wall Street, which
erupted with the arrest of a Drexel investment banker, Dennis R.
Levine, and then led to a government investigation of Drexel's
tactics.
   Still, Drexel had denied suggestions that the probe severely
impaired the firm, claiming its junk-bond business and its other
investment banking operations remained strong.

<TEXT>
   The Washington Public Power Supply System
fraud trial opened Wednesday with lawyers making last-minute
motions before Thursday's planned start of jury selection.
   The proceedings gave some idea of what could become important
arguments in the giant civil case.
   Attorney Kenneth Kieffer, representing some of the defendants,
said WPPSS operated in a fish bowl of publicity in the 1970s, and
it therefore would have been difficult or impossible for his
clients to commit fraud.
   But attorney Paul Bernstein of New York, representing thousands
of claimants in the class action lawsuit, said that while some
WPPSS meetings were open to the public and the media, other
gatherings of utility officials were regularly closed, making fraud
indeed possible.
   ``To say the supply system operated in a fish bowl is not
true,'' Bernstein told U.S. District Judge William Browning.
   WPPSS had signed a contract with 88 utilities to build two
nuclear power plants. But the plants were terminated when they were
partially built, and the subsequent 1983 default on $2.25 billion
in bonds issued to finance the project was the biggest in the
history of the municipal bond market.
   Wednesday's arguments came during discussions on what
information should be presented to jurors to help them understand
the complicated case.
   The WPPSS case was shifted for trial from Washington state to
Tucson following arguments that jurors from the Northwest might be
prejudiced because of the possibility they would pay for an
eventual jury award through their electricity rates.
   In the case, more than 24,000 people who bought bonds on the two
plants have filed suit alleging there was fraud in planning and
construction of the plants.
   Named as defendants were WPPSS, its member utilities, the 88
participating utilities, bond underwriters and engineering and
financial advice firms.
   Settlements totaling $351 million to date have left among the
defendants only 20 Washington utilities, one Oregon utility, two
engineering firms and a company that gave financial advice to WPPSS.
   The default occurred after energy projections for the Northwest
showed the electrical output of the partially-built plants, WPPSS
Nos. 4 and 5, was more than the region needed.
   The plants were terminated in January 1982 and default came in
1983 after the Washington Supreme Court ruled most of the 88
utilities investing in the projects had signed illegal contracts
with WPPSS.
   Wednesday, the defense argued unsuccessfully that the judge's
rules for trial would result in a ``playing field'' tilted in favor
of plaintiffs.
   ``You've put the hammer _ the firing mechanism _ in plaintiffs'
hands,'' Kieffer said in arguing that plaintiffs would be able to
control the trial.
   Keiffer said he feared the defense would be unable to put its
case in front of the jury in a logical manner if plaintiffs have
the ability to set the order in which witnesses will appear.
   Jury selection is expected to take two days. Browning has
ordered that 20 jurors be seated in the federal multi-district
litigation, which could last more than a year.
   Because it is a civil case, only six jurors eventually may be
called upon to issue a verdict.
   WPPSS attempted to build five nuclear power plants in the 1970s
to serve Northwest customers. Of those, one plant, WPPSS No. 2 at
the Hanford nuclear reservation, is operating.
   Two others, WPPSS Nos. 1 and 3, were mothballed under
construction delays five years ago.
   Bonds sold to build those three plants are paid for through the
Bonneville Power Administration. But the terminated plants Nos. 4
and 5 never enjoyed BPA protection.

   The Senate shrugged off charges it was
reverting to ``shameless'' trade protectionism Wednesday and moved
to force a vote on imposing new curbs on textile, apparel and
non-rubber footwear imports.
   ``This is about the survival of the textile industry,'' the
sponsor, Sen. Ernest F. Hollings, D-S.C., told the Senate before it
voted 68-29 to limit debate on the bill to 30 hours and thus avert
any filibuster.
   The action represented a step forward for the textile, apparel
and shoe industries. But prospects for the House-passed bill remain
clouded with a month to go before Congress adjourns to campaign
full time.
   Had the Senate not acted to invoke cloture, or limit debate,
free-trade forces seeking to prevent a vote on the bill itself
almost certainly would have staged a filibuster. Preventing that
required three-fifths support.
   The bill would freeze this year's textile and apparel imports at
1987 levels and permit growth of one percent annually in the years
ahead. It would bar increases in the level of non-rubber footwear
imports.
   The president would be authorized to negotiate tariff cuts to
compensate countries hurt by the tightened restrictions.
   President Reagan vetoed an earlier version of the legislation in
1985 to the dismay of manufacturers and a number of labor unions.
He called the measure protectionism that would raise prices, narrow
consumer choices and actually cost more jobs that it would save in
the textile, apparel and shoe industries.
   The industries were rocked by a wave of imports in the early
1980s and have been pushing ever since for congressional
restrictions.
   Critics have been complaining, however, that the textile
industry's distress is a thing of the past and that, in large
measure thanks to competition from Asian manufacturers, American
companies are more productive and competitive than ever before.
   After voting to invoke cloture, the Senate spent most of
Wednesday afternoon debating amendments designed by critics to
sidetrack the bill. Lawmakers planned to resume action on the bill
Thursday.
   In each case, lawmakers voted to table, or kill, amendments
offered by free-trade critics of the textile bill.
   Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, sponsored an amendment to exempt
``workers coveralls, uniforms, work shoes and work boots.'' He said
it would ``help the workingman.''
   ``This amendment is ludicrous,'' retorted Hollings. It was
tabled 62-28.
   Both sides also got onto a familiar merry-go-round over just how
much the nation's textile companies earn. The claims and
counterclaims have become a regular feature of textile debates.
   Sen. Bob Packwood, R-Ore., a critic of the proposed new curbs,
told the Senate that pre-tax earnings of U.S. textile companies
zoomed 26 percent last year. That brought Sen. Strom Thurmond,
R-S.C., an industry champion, to the floor with figures suggesting
a 12 percent drop in profits thus far this year.
   Packwood retorted that industry efforts to win new relief from
foreign competition were ``shameless.''
   Textile-state senators sat stony faced through the remarks but
retorted afterward that the textile industry's problems were a
serious matter.
   ``The textile and apparel industries will be extinct in a few
years unless the flooding of our markets is stopped,'' said
Thurmond.
   American apparel makers have not fared as well as textile
manufacturers, whose plants have undergone a broad-scale facelift
in recent years.
   Automated machinery that has drastically reduced the manpower
needs of fabric makers still has no parallel in the clothing
industry. Thus Asian apparel plants where wages are low by U.S.
standards in many cases remain able to turn out products with price
tags well below those of American products.

<HEAD>Parent Company of S&L in Federal Bailout Filed for Bankruptcy</HEAD>
<DATELINE>IRVINE, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Financial Corp. of America, said Wednesday
it would file for bankruptcy, a move widely expected after the
federal bailout of FCA's subsidiary, American Savings & Loan
Association.
   The development did not affect customers' accounts at the 186
California branches of American Savings, the nation's
second-largest savings and loan.
   FCA announced its board of directors authorized filing of a
petition for protection from creditors under Chapter 11 of the
federal bankruptcy law. A filing is to be made this week.
   Also Wednesday, William Popejoy, FCA chairman and chief
executive officer, resigned his position to head a new American
Savings under control of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board.
   Both actions stem from a bank board decision Tuesday to place
American Savings into a temporary receivership _ part of a $2
billion federal bailout plan that will turn control of American
over to an investor group led by Texan Robert M. Bass.
   In effect, the receivership creates a new, federally chartered
American Savings and severs all ties between the S&L and FCA.
   Deposits at American Savings continue to be insured up to
$100,000 by the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp.
Additionally, federal regulators several months ago took the
unusual step of guaranteeing deposits larger than $100,000 in
effort to bolster confidence in the long-troubled S&L.
   While depositors and some creditors are protected, stockholders
in FCA saw their investments wiped out by the federal action, which
does not provide for compensation from American to FCA or its
shareholders.
   The bank board agreed Monday to turn control of the new American
over to the Bass Group. Bass agreed to pump $550 million cash into
American.
   The deal, the biggest rescue of a troubled thrift, calls for the
bank board to inject an estimated $1.5 billion in cash into
American over the next 10 years, and to provide $500 million in
promissory notes. The first cash infusion _ of $250 million _ was
made Tuesday.
   Popejoy, 50, was brought in by the bank board to head American
in 1984, at the start of an extended attempt to let the S&L wok its
way out of trouble.
   American faltered after several years of rapid growth under the
former management. Its problems include billions of dollars in
loans made to shaky real estate ventures in California, Texas and
elsewhere. Many of those loans are delinquent or in foreclosure.

   But for the month, the automaker reported a 10.2 percent decline

   There were 27 selling days last month and 26 during the same

   For the year, vehicle makers reported a 4.4 percent increase
from 9,949,273 vehicles during the first eight months of last year
to 10,440,498 during the same period this year.

<HEAD>Fed Gives Bank of New York More Time To Complete Irving
Acquisition Bid</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Federal Reserve Board on Wednesday granted
Bank of New York Co. up to an additional 90 days to complete its
effort to acquire Irving Bank Corp.
   The ruling was a new blow to Irving's nearly year-long struggle
to avoid an unfriendly takeover by Bank of New York.
   Irving's hopes to fend of Bank of New York faded last week when
Banca Commerciale Italiana dropped its friendly offer of $840
million, $84 a share, for 51 percent of Irving's stock. The
Milan-based bank pulled out after an unfavorable Fed ruling on Aug.
19.
   Before Bank of New York can press on with its $1.4 billion
offer, valued at about $70 a share, it must win a ruling from a New
York appeals court affirming a lower court decision in late July
that overturned Irving's anti-takeover defense. The appeals court
has received briefs from the two sides and has scheduled a hearing
for Friday.
   The Fed, in a letter to H. Rodgin Cohen, an attorney
representing Bank of New York, gave the bank until 30 days after
the court ruling to wrap up the deal. But, it said, the extension
would expire within 90 days, whether or not the court rules.
   The Fed, on Feb. 25, originally granted Bank of New York until
May 24 to finish the deal, and has now extended the deadline three
times.
   After the court ruling, Bank of New York is required to consult
with the Fed before acquiring more than 5 percent of Irving. It
already has a 4.9 percent stake. The Fed said it would give the
case expedited consideration.
   The letter also rejected an Irving Bank contention that could
have forced Bank of New York to make a new application to the Fed
for permission to acquire Irving.
   Because of New York state law, Bank of New York may be forced to
maintain Irving as a separate subsidiary, rather than merge the two
organizations. Irving had argued that Bank of New York's
application to the Fed was for a merger only and would be invalid
if Irving remained intact as a subsidiary.
   ``We're very pleased at the extension. And ... we extend an
invitation to Irving's board to enter into substantial and
meaningful negotations with no preconditions,'' said Owen Brady, a
Bank of New York vice president.
   The two banks are both based in New York City and both have
about $23 billion in assets.

<HEAD>Resorts International Sale One Step Closer To Completion</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Entertainer Merv Griffin's plan to
purchase Resorts International Inc. moved a step closer to
completion Wednesday after a shareholder lawsuit was settled.
   The Delaware Chancery Court found the $36-a-share tender offer
price offered to holders of Class A shares ``is both generous and
fair and that the settlement must be approved notwithstanding
several objections to it.''
   Griffin made the tender offer in his bid to take control of the
gaming and real estate company. Developer Donald Trump has agreed
to sell all his shares of Resorts' Class B stock, which has 100
times the voting power of Class A stock.
   As part of the deal, Griffin would pay Trump $63 million to
terminate his management contract with Resorts, and Trump would pay
$255 million for Resorts' incomplete Taj Mahal casino project next
door.
   The Atlantic City Housing Authority has already approved the
deal between Trump and Griffin, through which Griffin will assume
Resorts' housing obligations.
   However, the state Casino Control Commission must still approve
the deal and give Griffin interim authority to operate the casino.
   Gaming officials in the Bahamas must also approve the sale,
because Resorts International has a property there.
   More than 81 percent of Resorts' Class A shares already have
been tendered to Griffin, according to Trump's statement.

   Insider trading charges leveled Wednesday against
Victor Posner are the latest in a string of legal and business
problems dogging the Miami Beach tycoon, a high-school dropout who
amassed a multimillion-dollar fortune in real estate and corporate
takeovers.
   Posner and his son Stephen were among those named in a
Securities and Exchange Commission civil insider-trading complaint
filed in New York against the investment firm Drexel Burnham
Lambert Inc., the head of its junk bond trading unit, Michael
Milken, and others.
   The complaint alleges Posner arranged for now-jailed former
speculator Ivan Boesky to buy stock in Fischbach Corp. that
secretly actually would be controlled by Milken, Drexel and the
Posners, in order to aid Posner's attempted takeover of the company.
   The Posners had not seen the complaint and had no comment, said
Renee Mottram, a spokeswoman at Posner's beachfront corporate
headquarters.
   Wednesday's charges came just two weeks after a judge rejected
prosecution complaints that a tax fraud sentence leveled on Posner
in February amounted to a slap on the wrist.
   Posner, 69, was sentenced to pay fines of $4 million, donate $3
million for a study on the homeless and perform 20 hours of
community service a week for 5 years. He pleaded no contest a year
ago to evading $1.2 million in federal income taxes by inflating
the value of 22 acres he donated to Miami Christian College.
   The crusty, white-haired mogul, whose plethora of holdings
included controlling interest in companies that owned Royal Crown
Cola and Arby's, is performing his community service by helping out
on the bread line at a shelter for the homeless in Miami.
   Posner credited his business success to an ``uncanny ability''
to churn out profits.
   At age 8, he worked at his father's Baltimore grocery stores. At
13, he quit school to run them. But it was his ``genius'' in real
estate that made him a millionaire by age 25, Posner has said.
   He turned to takeovers in 1966, first targeting DWG Corp. and
soon controlling Sharon Steel and several other publicly-held firms
as he developed a reputation as a corporate raider.
   In 1985, his empire was valued at $4 billion, and he was ranked
by Business Week magazine as the nation's highest-paid executive
with an annual salary of $12.7 million.
   But that same year, his corporate empire showed signs of
weakness when Evans Products Inc., 42.5 percent owned by Posner's
NVF Co., sought Chapter 11 protection. Sharon Steel also is
reorganizing under Chapter 11.

   The Securities and Exchange Commission filed a
massive enforcement action Wednesday against investment giant
Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. and the head of its junk-bond trading
unit, accusing them of a systematic fraud violations ranging from
insider trading to falsifying books.
   The 184-page civil complaint filed in Manhattan federal court
marked the government's most aggressive move against a securities
firm in a two-year-old crackdown on Wall Street corruption stemming
from the Ivan Boesky insider trading scandal.
   The complaint alleged ``fraudulent conduct involving insider
trading, stock manipulation, fraud on Drexel's own clients, failure
to disclose beneficial ownership of securities and numerous other
violations.''
   The SEC said it would seek to have the defendants give up the
profits made on the affected stock trades and pay a penalty of
triple the profits. The agency offered no specific figure, but Sen.
William Proxmire, chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, said
the SEC was seeking $100 million.
   Frederick H. Joseph, chief executive officer of Drexel,
reiterated the company's position that it would be absolved of the
charges, while Michael Milken, head of Drexel's junk bond
operations, also denied any wrongdoing.
   The SEC had said previously that it planned to file a civil
complaint against Drexel but had not released details of its case.
   The SEC's move capped months of speculation that the government
had assembled an extensive case against the firm as a result of the
investigation into Wall Street abuses spawned by the Ivan Boesky
scandal.
   According to the complaint, Drexel and Milken, of Encino,
Calif., had a ``secret arrangement with Boesky'' involving at least
16 series of illegal securities transactions.
   Under that agreement, the SEC claimed that Boesky-controlled
companies secretly bought, sold or held securities for Drexel or
other individual defendants and that sometimes Drexel reciprocated
with secret transactions for Boesky.
   The SEC alleged that employees of Drexel and Boesky companies
kept secret, off-the-books records of securities positions taken as
part of the arrangement. Boesky was forced nearly two years ago to
surrender a record $100 million in penalties and illegal profits
from trading on insider information.
   The SEC also charged that Drexel and Milken, in at least two
additional transactions, traded in securities using confidential
information misappropriated from Drexel clients.
   Federal law bars corporate executives, investment bankers and
others with access to confidential corporate information from using
it to trade in securities.
   U.S. Attorney Rudolph Giuliani, whose office prosecuted Boesky
and other Wall Street criminals, declined to comment on whether
criminal charges would be filed against Drexel, Milken or any of
the other defendants.
   There had been speculation the SEC delayed filing its civil
complaint to avoid interfering with the criminal investigation.
   ``We disagree with the charges filed by the SEC and in due
course we expect to be vindicated,'' Joseph said in a statement.
   He added: ``Hundreds of transactions have been reviewed; yet, as
shown by the charges and as we have been predicting, there is
little in the filing that is not based on Ivan Boseky's
allegations.''
   In a separate statement, Milken also predicted he would be
vindicated in court.
   ``For the past 22 months I have been the subject of a shadow
trial of systematic leaks and innuendo based upon false
accusations. ... No one likes to be sued, but I welcome the
opportunity to have at long last a full and open hearing of the
allegations in an unbiased forum,'' he said.
   Also included among the defendants were Milken's brother, Lowell
J. Milken, of Los Angeles; Cary J. Maultasch of Livingston, N.J.;
and Pamela Monzert, Santa Monica, Calif., all Drexel employees.
   Also charged were Victor Posner, of Miami Beach, Fla., president
of Pennsylvania Engineering Corp. of Pittsburgh, which also was
named as a defendant, and Posner's son, Stephen Posner, a director
and vice chairman of the board at Pennsylvania Engineering. A
spokeswoman, Renee Mottram, said the Posners had not seen the
complaint and therefore had no comment. Posner, who was the
nation's highest paid corporate executive in the mid-1980s, pleaded
guilty earlier this year to federal income tax evasion charges.
   Gary Lynch, the SEC's director of enforcement, said in a
telephone interview that the allegations involve 18 series of
transactions, including 16 involving Boesky, the former stock
speculator now in prison.
   Boesky was charged with violating insider-trading related
securities laws in November 1986 and settled charges by agreeing to
return profits and pay fines totaling $100 million.
   SEC charges against Drexel, with whom Boesky worked, had been
widely expected since then.
   In mid-July, Frederick W. Joseph, Drexel's chief executive, told
the firm's employees to expect charges, possibly soon and with
little warning. Published reports quoted the firm's officials at
the time as saying settlement talks with the SEC had broken down.
   Lynch declined to comment regarding efforts to settle the
charges with Drexel or on whether Boesky would be called as a
witness.

<HEAD>Campbell Fourth Qtr. Profit Up 4 Percent</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CAMDEN, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Campbell Soup Co. on Wednesday reported its
fourth quarter profit was up by 4 percent over the same period last
year, aided by corporate acquisitions.
   Campbell posted a profit of $72 million, or 56 cents a share, in
the three months ended July 31, compared with a profit of $70
million, or 54 cents per share, in the same period last year.
   Sales during the fourth quarter rose to $1.15 billion from $1
billion in the year-earlier period, Campbell reported.
   For the full year, Campbell had net income of $274 million, or
$2.12 per share, compared with $247 million, or $1.90 per share, in
the previous year.
   Annual sales rose to $4.87 billion from $4.49 billion in the
previous year.
   Spokesman David Hackney said Campbell's sales and earnings were
boosted by acquisitions that totaled $600 million, including the
acquisition of Britain's Freshbake Foods.
   ``We had strong volume in a number of areas, including soup,
frozen food, V-8 vegetable juice, Franco-American pasta, Campbell's
beans, Pepperidge Farms and Vlasic foods,'' said Hackney.
   Campbell President R. Gordon McGovern said restructuring,
acquisitions and a renewed concentration on the company's core
businesses contributed to profit growth.
   Last year, Campbell closed four plants in Chicago; Doylestown,
Pa.; Pottstown, Pa.; and Memphis, Mich. The company also sold three
ingredient plants and its Pietro's restaurant chain.

<HEAD>Producers Make `Final' Contract Offer to Teamsters</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN HORN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Television and film producers made a final
contract offer Wednesday to Teamster drivers and related unions,
raising the possibility of another entertainment industry strike.
   An all-night bargaining session between the Alliance of Motion
Picture and Television Producers and representatives for five basic
crafts unions concluded early Wednesday morning without a
settlement, alliance officials said.
   In addition to 2,200 Teamster drivers, the basic crafts unions
include Hollywood electricians, plumbers, laborers and plasterers.
   Each of the five unions will vote on the producers' offer
separately. If any union rejects the terms, a strike will not begin
for at least two weeks, according to producers' spokesman Herb
Steinberg.
   The Teamsters have complained that the producers' offers include
wage cuts, unfair overtime standards, and loopholes that permit
excessive non-union film production.
   Earl Bush, secretary-treasurer for the Teamsters Local 399, did
not return phone calls immediately Wednesday.
   ``The final offers are designed to make these contracts more
competitive with the working conditions at other facilities in Los
Angeles,'' alliance president Nicholas Counter said in a prepared
statement. ``If we do not accomplish that, more jobs will be lost
at the studios. Our records show that in 1987 Teamsters lost more
than $14 million in wages and benefits as compared with employment
levels in 1985. We must reverse that trend so that we can recapture
work and jobs at studios.''
   Television and film production has only recently returned to
full speed after a five-month scriptwriters strike. Producers
contend they could hire enough replacement drivers to keep
Hollywood rolling in the event of a strike.
   The Teamsters have been working without a contract since July 30.

<HEAD>Hunts, Creditors Sign Papers on Penrod Deal</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The wealthy Hunt brothers moved a step closer
toward removing their key businesses from from bankruptcy
proceedings Wednesday by signing a nearly $780 million plan to end
their two-year legal battle with creditor banks over Penrod
Drilling Co.
   Under the agreement, the Hunts _ Nelson Bunker, William Herbert
and Lamar _ and trusts they control will convey numerous tracts of
real estate to the banks in consideration for forgiveness of $200
million in existing debt.
   In addition, a newly restructured loan to Penrod in the amount
of $525 million will be secured by notes and Penrod assets, and the
restructured company will make a cash payment of $53.8 million.
   The banks will control for the Hunt trusts all of Penrod's
stock, with 50 percent of the shares held for the banks themselves,
while the trusts will retain the right to redeem all the stock held
for the banks at a predetermined price.
   ``The agreement ends months of sometimes heated negotiations
over the future of Penrod,'' according to a statement by Hunt
Energy.
   Penrod, the world's biggest independent offshore oil-drilling
company, and its sister company Placid Oil sued 23 of their lenders
for fraud and misrepresentation in 1986 after defaulting on $1.5
billion in bank loans. Two of the banks since have been dropped
from the case.
   The suit sought $14 million in damages, alleging the banks _ one
group of which had sued to recover $760 million in past due loans
to Penrod _ conspired to drive Penrod and Placid out of business by
forcing them to agree to an unreasonable payment schedule while
offering their competitors more favorable terms.
   In August 1986, the trust estates of William Herbert, Nelson
Bunker and Lamar Hunt filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection
for the trust partnership that owns Penrod Drilling. Penrod itself
was not under bankruptcy court protection.
   All parties to the Penrod agreement, Penrod officers, bank
representatives and Hunt estate trustees were on hand Wednesday in
New York to sign documents executing the plan. The documents will
be held in escrow pending approval of the plan to reorganize the
three trust estates that own Penrod.
   Judge Harold Abramson has scheduled hearings to begin Thursday
in federal bankruptcy court in Dallas.
   Calls placed Wednesday night to Hunt officials by The Associated
Press were not immediately returned.
   Penrod's current management and field personnel will remain in
place, according to Marshall Ballard, general manager of Penrod.
   Last month, a federal jury decided the Hunt brothers must pay
over $130 million in damages for conspiring to corner the world
silver market in the late 1970s, thereby ruining the investments of
Minpeco SA, the Peruvian government's mineral marketing company.
