<HEAD>Friends Pay Last Respects to Max Robinson</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDs: SUBS graf 6 to correct Jackson's characterization of
conversation with Robinson about contracting AIDS, adding quote from
Jackson eulogy</NOTE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Rev. Jesse Jackson eulogized former ABC
News anchorman Max Robinson on Friday as a man who ``wouldn't
adjust, wouldn't knuckle under the face of ... racism.''
   Jackson, a close friend of Robinson's, delivered the eulogy at a
Washington church where friends and co-workers of the nation's first
black network television anchor paid their last respects to Robinson.
   The former anchor, said Jackson, ``wouldn't adjust, wouldn't
knuckle under the face of obvious and not so obvious racism.''
   Robinson had been ill for more than a year when he died Tuesday
at Howard University Hospital of complications resulting from AIDS.
He was 49.
   ``Max Robinson never adjusted,'' Jackson said. ``He sought to
transform. He was not a TV thermometer who measured things and
spilled them back out. He tried to be a thermostat _ to change the
temperature.''
   Jackson told reporters that he talked to Robinson about how
Robinson contracted AIDS and that Robinson told him: ``It is not
homosexuality but it was promiscuity. ... Let my predicament be a
source of education to our people.''
   Among those attending the ceremony were ABC News President Roone
Arledge, ABC anchorman Peter Jennings, CBS anchorman Dan Rather, 60
Minutes reporter Ed Bradley and CNN anchorman Bernard Shaw.
   ``I think ABC News is a better place today than it was before Max
was there,'' said Arledge. ``A lot of that is due to his efforts.''
   Robinson began his broadcasting career as a radio station disc
jockey in his hometown of Richmond, Va. He moved to Washington in
1965 and three years later became the first black to anchor
newscasts at a major TV station, appearing on the 6 p.m. and 11 p.m.
news on Channel 9 WTOP, now WUSA, with co-anchor Gordon Peterson.
   Robinson then left Washington after 10 years at the top of the
ratings to join ABC as the first black to anchor a network news
show. He was one of three anchors at ABC, along with Jennings and
Frank Reynolds.
   ``He did an enormous amount for us,'' said Jennings. ``He did an
enormous amount, I think, for his community. ... When Max died, we
all hoped he'd find some peace.''
   The frustrated Robinson made headlines publicly denouncing racism
at the news organization during a speech at Smith College in
February 1981.
   Arledge was supervising news coverage when Robinson was an
anchor, and he changed ABC News' three-anchor format after Reynolds
died in 1983. At that point, Jennings inherited the job as sole
anchor of the newscasts, and Robinson was assigned to do news briefs
and weekend anchor.
   In 1984, he left ABC News in Washington and joined WMAQ-TV in
Chicago. The following June, he entered a hospital specializing in
alcohol rehabilitation suffering from emotional and physical
exhaustion, according to Nick Aronson, director of communications at
WMAQ-TV. Aronson said Robinson never returned to the station, and
did sporadic freelance work after that.
   ``I think one of my basic flaws has been the lack of esteem, not
really feeling great about myself, always feeling like I had to do
more,'' Robinson said in a Washington Post profile.
   He is survived by his mother, Doris Robinson Griffin, and
stepfather, the Rev. James Griffin, both from Norfolk, Va., and four
children, Mark, Maureen, Michael and Malik Robinson.
   Robinson also leaves three surviving siblings, Jewel R. Shepperd,
Jean Robinson Yancey and civil rights activist Randall Robinson, the
head of TransAfrica. All live in Washington.
   There will be no private funeral, as Robinson's family has
decided to have his remains cremated.

<HEAD>China Arrests Man Linked To U.S.-Based Dissident Group</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A man linked to a U.S.-based Chinese dissident
group has been arrested, and an organization he led has been
suppressed, according to two official newspapers.
   The reports said Lei Yuanhai and five members of his group
received funds from the New York-based Chinese Alliance for
Democracy.
   The group, established in 1983 by a former Chinese citizen,
advocates democracy in China.
   China News and the People's Daily reported Thursday that Lei and
his colleagues had been accused of passing out copies of ``China
Spring,'' the alliance's magazine that is banned in China. In
addition, they allegedly ``attacked the dictatorship of the people
and the socialist system, and actively plotted riotous, illegal
activities.''
   The reports, which cited no specific instances of illegal
activities, said Lei founded the Chongqing branch of the Chinese
Alliance for Democracy two years ago.
   Following its founding, the branch received regular payments from
New York and agents came to Chongqing to help with organizing, the
reports said.
   China News and the People's Daily said Lei and the five others
have admitted their involvement in the group and expressed
repentance. A letter of apology, written by Lei, has been published
in the Chongqing Daily.
   The reports said the Public Security Bureau had taken note of
Lei's apology and would deal leniently with Lei and the five others.
   China tolerates little political dissent. Political reform here
is viewed by the state as a necessary evil that will help spwr
economic growth. Any moves that would challenge the supremacy of the
Chinese Communist Party are checked.
   The press remains tightly controlled. And tough censorship laws
limit access to new political ideas.
   The Chinese Alliance for Democracy, based in Queens, New York, is
run by Wang Bingzhang, now a U.S. citizen. Wang came to Canada in
the late 1970s from China to study at McGill University in Montreal.
In 1983, he became an American citizen and the alliance was founded.
   Wang has said the alliance receives money from Taiwan and from
other Chinese groups interested in democracy in China. His
organization, he says, is committed to bringing about a democratic
revolution in China.
   Wang's group and magazine, ``China Spring,'' are relatively
popular among the 27,000 Chinese students now studying in the United
States. The magazine regularly runs articles written by people it
says are ``sources in China.''
   The magazine takes its name from ``Beijing Spring,'' a period of
time from 1979-80 when China experienced relative cultural and
political freedoms.
   The magazine lists as honorary co-editors, Wei Jingsheng, Liu
Qing and Xu Wenli, three imprisoned dissidents who were active
during the ``Beijing Spring'' period.
   However, there is no known connection between the dissidents and
Wang's group.

   Korean Air Flight 858 disappears over the jungle near the
Thailand-Burma border. All 115 people aboard the Boeing 707 are
killed.
   Suspicion about a planted bomb focused on two passengers, a man
and woman, detained after they were questioned about forged Japanese
passports and bit into cyanide capsules hidden in cigarette filters.
The couple had left the KAL flight, which was bound from Baghdad to
Bangkok, in Abu Dhabi, one stop before it disappeared. The man
succeeded in his suicide attempt, but the woman survived.
   South Korean officials believe the couple left bags on the plane
that contained a bomb, and suggested they were North Korean agents
who blew up the plane as part of a long-range scheme to disrupt the
1988 Seoul Summer Olympics. North Korea called the accusation
``silly and far-fetched.''

   Four Americans are killed when a bomb under a seat explodes on
Trans World Airlines Flight 840 from Rome to Athens. Nine other
passengers are injured.
   The Boeing 727 was beginning its descent into Athens when the
bomb blew a gaping hole in the fuselage. Two women, a mother and
daughter, and the daughter's baby were killed when they were sucked
from the plane and plummeted to the ground. The fourth victim, also
found on the ground, was killed instantly when the bomb exploded
under his seat.
   Authorities speculated that the terrorist who set the charge may
have been confused by Italy's recent shift to daylight-saving time.
Had the bomb gone off an hour earlier _ before the jet began its
descent _ the massive decompression of the fuselage would have
caused a crash killing all 122 people aboard.
   Police said the explosive device was left under the seat by a
woman carrying a Lebanese passport under the name Mei Mansour who
sat in the seat earlier, when the plane was westbound. Mansour later
appeared in Beirut and denied responsibility.

   Air-India Flight 182 blows apart off the coast of Ireland,
killing all 329 people aboard. The Boeing 747 was on its way from
Toronto to Bombay, via London.
   An inquiry by the Indian government concluded that a bomb caused
the crash.
   Canadian authorities said a man checked a suitcase onto the plane
but did not board. In another incident the same day, Canadian
officials say, Sikh militants planted a suitcase bomb on a Canadian
jetliner in Vancouver. The bag exploded while being transferred to
an Air-India flight at the Tokyo airport, killing two baggage
handlers.
   Despite circumstantial evidence, police have been unable to prove
their contention that extremist Sikhs based in British Columbia
planted the bombs to retaliate for the storming of a Sikh shrine in
India by government troops. Anonymous callers claimed responsibility
for the crash on behalf of Sikh groups.

   A 16-year-old Japanese boy is killed by a bomb that explodes
aboard a Pan Am jetliner bound from Tokyo to Hawaii. Fifteen other
passengers, including the boy's parents, are injured.
   The plane, carrying 285 people, landed safely despite the
explosion, which occurred about 140 miles out from Hawaii. No
individual or group claimed responsibility for the explosion.
   In May 1988, a Palestinian, Mohammed Rashid, was arrested at
Athens airport, on a tip from the U.S. Embassy in the Greek capital,
and charged with planting the bomb aboard the trans-Pacific
airliner. American officials have said Rashid also was involved in
the 1986 TWA bombing.
   His extradition to the United States remains under consideration.

   A Cubana Airlines DC8 crashes into the sea minutes after taking
off from Seawell Airport in Barbados, killing 73 people, including
24 members of the Cuban national fencing team.
   Nine minutes after takeoff, the pilot contacted the control
tower: ``Seawell, Seawell, C0455. We have an explosion on board.
We're descending fast. ... We have fire on board. ... Request
immediate landing permission.'' Another explosion went off and the
pilot was heard shouting, ``Shut the door!'' The plane hit the ocean
several miles offshore.
   Four Cuban exiles living in Venezuela were charged with the
bombing. Two were convicted, one escaped, and a fourth, anti-Castro
radical Orlando Bosch, spent 11 years in Venezuelan prisons while
fighting the charges, was never convicted, and finally was released
and returned to the United States last February.

   The catastrophic earthquake in Armenia has
dampened the Christmas spirit in America's Armenian community, with
many festivities canceled and money normally spent on gifts being
sent for relief efforts.
   Armenians in the United States, as well as in South America and
Europe, have canceled or postponed Christmas and New Year's parties,
weddings, dances, tree decorating and other activities to mourn the
thousands killed in the Dec. 7 quake.
   ``The earthquake has pretty much ruined Christmas for most of the
Armenians I know,'' said Jean-Marie Atamian, a New York lawyer who
had volunteered to answer phones for the Armenian General Benevolent
Union in Saddle Brook, N.J.
   ``We have canceled all of the gatherings and dances and social
functions. We felt it would be totally inappropriate.''
   The earthquake devastated the cities of Leninakan, Spitak and
Kirovakan and up to 100 rural settlements in northwest Armenia.
Official Soviet sources have put the death toll as high as 55,000
and estimated the number of homeless at over 500,000.
   Christmas is celebrated Jan. 6 by the Armenian church and Dec. 25
by Armenian Catholics and Protestants.
   Leaders of the two branches of the Armenian church in the United
States declared a 40-day period of mourning when the earthquake hit.
But many Armenians say the decision to mute celebrations was
spontaneous.
   In New York, Archbishop Torkom Manoogian, head of the Eastern
Diocese of the Armenian Church of America, will hold a requiem Mass
for children Jan. 7 instead of the Christmas party he usually holds
for youngsters, according to Adrienne Alexanian, a volunteer at St.
Vartan Armenian Cathedral. About 70,000 Armenians live in the New
York-New Jersey area.
   In California, with the largest Armenian population outside the
Soviet Union _ some 250,000 live in the Los Angeles area _ Armenians
have canceled weddings and holiday parties. Churches are holding
special requiem services after Sunday Masses.
   Armenian Protestants are preparing for a somber holiday. ``Of
course we will still observe Christ's birth,'' said Rosey Maranjian,
who answered the telephone for the Armenian Mission Association at
its headquarters in Paramus, N.J. ``But there is nothing to
celebrate even though Christ is born.''
   ``We keep asking, `Why us?''' she said. One of her cousins died
in Leninakan, she added.
   ``It's a sad way to celebrate such a joyous event,'' said the
Rev. Moses Janbazian, the association's executive director.
   ``Instead of sending out Christmas cards to friends and
exchanging gifts, we are sending the money to Armenia. And most
families are doing that,'' said Shakeh Kadehjian, a secretary in the
New York office of the Armenian Evangelical Church, which celebrates
Christmas Dec. 25.
   ``Most of the people, without asking us, are canceling their
wedding ceremonies'' until after the mourning period ends Jan. 17,
said Rev. Nareg Shrikian of St. Mary's Armenian Apostolic Church in
Glendale, Calif.
   ``The first reaction among Armenians was to cancel everything,
not even to decorate Christmas trees,'' said Ara Kalaydjian, editor
of the Armenian Mirror-Spectator, an English-language newspaper
published in Watertown, Mass. The area is home to 30,000-40,000
Armenians.
   Kalaydjian said he planned a quiet dinner with his family. ``We
won't exchange gifts. We won't have a tree,'' he siad.
   Edward Bogosian, editor of the Armenian Reporter, said his
English-language weekly, published in New York, ordinarily carries
announcements of holiday events.
   But over the past two weeks, he said, ``all the listings carried
a notation: canceled, canceled, canceled, one after another.''

   Thousands packed into China's top art gallery for
the opening of Beijing's first painting exhibition devoted entirely
to the study of nudes.
   Some leered and shook their heads in disbelief at what they saw,
but many others gazed with obvious appreciation at the works.
   Poets, top government officials, schoolchildren, young couples
and workers gathered Thursday around the paintings by some of
China's best artists.
   ``I feel this exhibition shows we have achieved a little more
freedom. In the past you would never see this,'' said Wang Xing, 22,
a student from Beijing Teacher's College as he viewed a study of a
man and a woman touching a bird. ``It also shows our level is
rising. The paintings here move me, they are beautiful.''
   ``Underneath, everyone is naked and everyone knows their
nakedness,'' said Ai Qing, who at 79 is China's best known living
poet. ``Why then, when we want to paint our bodies, do so many
Chinese think it's strange? I think it is good.''
   The Exhibition of Figure Oil Painting at the China Art Gallery
features 128 paintings by 21 artists. Gallery official estimated
that about 20,000 people came on the first day, paying about 27
cents each, five times the normal admission price.
   ``We have traditional nudes, realistic nudes, expressionist
nudes, abstract nudes, even cubist and deformist nudes,'' said Ge
Pengren, a painting instructor at the Central Institute of Fine Arts
who organized the show. ``Our purpose is to educate the people about
nudes and to show them, through these paintings, how we value life.''
   Ge said the exhibition, which was approved by the Ministry of
Culture before it was opened, hadn't met with any ``major
interference'' since it was sanctioned a year ago.
   ``When we chose the paintings, there was no censorship at all,''
he said.
   Artistic freedom in China is very limited. Books and movies have
to pass through a censor and artists are often restricted in what
they can create.
   During the ultra-leftist Cultural Revolution from 1966-76,
painters were banned from displaying nude paintings and only in 1978
were they again allowed to use nude models.
   Society and the state have been slow in accepting the change.
   Newspapers carried a report earlier this year about a 19-year-old
girl who suffered a nervous breakdown because of the abuse she
received for posing nude at the Nanjing Academy of Fine Arts.
   In recent years, only two exhibitions devoted to nudes have
opened in China. In addition, a nude mural by Yuan Yunsheng, painted
in 1979 during a period of relative cultural freedom, remains
covered at the Beijing Airport.
   ``In the past, society's ideas about morality were a little
backward,'' said Ge. ``It was like we were afraid of our bodies.
With this exhibition, we want to open a new road.''
   Inded, the educational nature of the exhibition is very strong. A
lengthy explanation of the nude's place in art history lines the
middle of one hall. A discussion of the artists' work lines another.
   ``We still have to introduce things to the masses,'' said artist
Cao Li. ``Without this introduction, many people wouldn't understand
at all.''
   But even with the introduction, Fu Kegan was having a hard time.
   ``I'm going to stand here until I understand this painting,'' the
former teacher said as he stood, head shaking, in front of a gray
canvas.
   ``The artist told me this is an abstract nude,'' said Fu, 68.
``But it looks like a pile of rocks.''
   Despite his confusion, Fu said he welcomed such exhibitions.
   ``We hear that nude exhibitions in the West are normal,'' he
said. ``So why in China should they be so mysterious? This show
could teach people that nude painting isn't dangerous.''
   ``It may not be dangerous,'' said Wang Bing, 48, a housewife.
``But I think it's dirty. Look at those boys staring at that
painting.''
   Across the room, a pack of 20 men appeared perilously close to
diving into a painting of two Chinese women.
   ``Oh, there will always be uneducated people,'' Fu said. ``But
maybe this show will teach them to change.''

Oganization and is opposed to calls for an international peace
conference on the Middle East. But he has pledged to introduce new
peace proposals after his new government is in place.
   Shamir, 73, was born in Poland and emigrated to what was then
Palestine in 1938, a decade before the founding of Israel. He has a
law degree and did not enter politics until 1956. He served as prime
minister in 1983-84 and again starting Oct. 14, 1986.

   Shimon Peres moves to the Finance Ministry from the Foreign
Ministry. The son of a Polish timber merchant, he arrived in
Palestine in 1934 and as a teen-ager delivered messages on his
motorcycle for Israel's founding father, David Ben-Gurion.
   Peres, 65, has written at least four books and has said that in
his youth he wanted to be a poet. He is seen as an intellectual, but
many Israelis also view him as arrogant and distant.
   Peres' once-dominant Labor Party has won national elections only
once in the past 11 years, and the 1983 victory was not by a
sufficient margin to allow Labor to rule without Likud. Peres favors
an international peace conference and has promoted the idea of a
dialogue with Palestinians in confederation with Jordan.
   As finance minister, Peres will have to confront growing budget
deficits and major financial problems in Israel's industries,
including companies owned by the Labor-allied Histadrut Union
Federation.

   Yitzhak Rabin remains defense minister, a post he held when the
Israeli Cabinet voted to withdraw its invading force from Lebanon
after a three-year occupation. A native of Jerusalem, he was
ambassador to the United States from 1968-73.
   His term as prime minister was cut short in 1977 when he was
forced to resign in a scandal over his wife's illegal overseas bank
accounts. He and Peres have had a long rivalry for leadership of the
Labor Party.
   Rabin, 66, fought in World War II, taking part in allied
operations in Syria and fighting behind enemy lines. He was army
chief of staff during the 1967 Six-Day War, in which Israel took
control of the West Bank, Gaza Strip and Golan Heights from
neighboring Arab countries.
   He has ordered a firm response to the year-old Palestinian
uprising in the occupied territories.

   Moshe Arens replaces Peres as foreign minister. A native of
Lithuania, he immigrated with his family to the United States at the
age of 14 and studied aeronautical engineering at the California
Institute of Technology and the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology.
   He moved to Israel in 1950 and is said to be proudest of the
planes and missiles he designed here, both for the Israeli military
and for export.
   Colleagues describe Arens as cool and thoughtful. He was
ambassador to the United States in 1982-83, and he is likely to be
heavily engaged in dialogue with Washington following the U.S.
decision to open talks with the PLO, which Israel considers a
terrorist organization.
   Arens, 62, is an extreme conservative and reportedly turned down
the job of defense minister in 1980 because he opposed the
just-concluded Israel-Egypt peace treaty.

   The decision by Pan American World Airways and
the U.S. government not to alert the public to a fairly specific
bomb threat received long before Pan Am Flight 103 crashed in
Scotland could raise liability problems for the airline but probably
not for the government, attorneys say.
   ``I don't know of any legal requirement that the U.S. go public
on a thing like that other than notifying the airline involved and
possibly the embassies,'' said Lee Kreindler, a New York lawyer who
specializes in aviation accident cases.
   ``It's a difficult area, but if the government notifies the
airline in question, I think the government position is justified,''
Kreindler said Thursday.
   Kreindler said there are ``some policy reasons from the
government's standpoint for not'' notifying the traveling public.
One of the purposes of the Federal Aviation Act is to enhance
aviation and an announcement of a specific threat which might not be
bona fide could conceivably result in travelers not flying.
   Flight 103, originating in Frankfurt, West Germany, with a change
of planes at London's Heathrow Airport, crashed in Scotland on
Wednesday, killing all 258 people aboard and more than 20 on the
ground. It was bound for New York.
   Phyllis Oakley, a State Department spokeswoman, said that an
unidentified individual telephoned the U.S. Embassy in Helsinki on
Dec. 5 and said there would be a bombing attempt within two weeks
against a Pan Am aircraft flying from Frankfurt to the United States.
   The conduit would be an ``unwitting'' passenger who would take
the device from Helsinki to Frankfurt and then board a U.S.-bound
flight, she said.
   It has not been established, however, that the telephoned tip was
related to the Pan Am crash.
   Mrs. Oakley said dozens of threats are received each day and all
are taken seriously. L. Paul Bremer, who heads the State
Department's counter-terrorism office, said there have been 87 calls
similar to the Helsinki call over the past three months.
   But the Dec. 5 call, apparently from a tipster, appeared to be
taken more seriously than most others. Many U.S. embassies were
apprised of the threat, including the American mission in Moscow,
where a notice of the threat was posted on a bulletin board.
   No word went out to the general public.
   The prior notification ``is going to raise an interesting
question'' in connection with the other passengers ``who were not
members of the State Department staff whether they should have
received similar notice from Pan Am,'' said George N. Tompkins Jr.,
a lawyer specializing in defending airlines in accident cases.
   Bremer said in an interview Thursday night that not enough is
known to conclude that sabotage caused the jumbo jet to crash.
   ``We don't know if this is a terrorist attack,'' he said.
   Asked what an airline's obligation is once it has been notified
of a specific threat, Kreindler said, ``It's a tough situation. ...
They don't have to stop operating or stop flying, but certainly they
have a duty to meticulously inspect.''
   Kreindler said that in some other instances of terrorism
involving air travel, evidence-gathering in lawsuits has focused on
airline security precautions.
   Officials said Pan Am stepped up security at key airports in the
wake of the threat.
   Anyone filing lawsuits seeking settlements in excess of a $75,000
limit in international airlines cases would have to show willful
misconduct on the part of the airline in order to be successful.
   Tompkins said willful misconduct is extremely difficult to prove,
carrying with it a heavier burden of proof than gross negligence.
   Willful misconduct is a wrongful act done intentionally or an
improper act done wantonly with knowledge of the probable
consequences.

   The damage to national security caused by a
soldier accused of spying for the Warsaw Pact might not be as severe
as originally feared, Pentagon officials say.
   The officials, who insisted on anonymity, said Thursday that
continuing interrogation of Warrant Officer James William Hall III
``suggests he might have been selective in the documents he passed.''
   ``When all is said and done, it doesn't look too bad,'' said one
official.
   ``It's not great, but it's not a crisis, either,'' said another.
   ``The counter-intelligence people are wringing him out now,''
said one source. ``He's still cooperating, singing.''
   Hall, 30, of New York City, was arrested Wednesday at his home
near Fort Stewart, Ga., by Army intelligence agents after a
successful Army-FBI sting operation.
   Lt. Col. John Chapla, an Army spokesman, said Hall was moved
Thursday from Fort Stewart to a prison cell at Fort Meade, Md.,
outside Washington, D.C.
   According to affidavits filed in federal court in Savannah, Ga.,
where Fort Stewart is located, Hall bragged to an unidentified FBI
agent ``that he had been passing highly sensitive signal
intelligence documents to both the Soviets and the East German
intelligence services since late 1982.''
   ``Hall boasted of the important signal intelligence information
he had passed, and admitted his motivation to be greed,'' the
document said. It did not give details on the information.
   Hall allegedly passed the information through a Turkish-born,
naturalized citizen named Huseyin Yildirim. Yildirim also was
arrested Wednesday at his home in Belleair Beach, Fla., near St.
Petersburg.
   He had been scheduled to appear at a bond hearing Thursday but
the proceeding was postponed until Tuesday because Yildirim's
attorney had a scheduling conflict.
   Chapla said Hall was moved to ``facilitate security,'' noting the
base at Fort Meade has ``secure facilities'' that can be used for
courts-martial that involve the presentation of classified material
as evidence.
   Fort Meade also is the site of the National Security Agency, the
supersecret spy agency that conducts electronic surveillance around
the world. Hall worked in the field of electronic surveillance for
the Army and, indirectly, the NSA.
   The spokesman declined to say whether NSA specialists were
sitting in on the interrogation of Hall.
   Chapla said Hall not been formally charged with any crimes as of
Thursday evening but was being detained under the Uniform Code of
Military Justice for suspicion of espionage. He can be held for up
to three days on that basis, Chapla said.
   According to Army records, Hall held a ``Top Secret'' security
clearance and spent most of his 12 years in the service at posts in
West Germany, where the Army maintains electronic listening posts
and intelligence units that would play critical roles in time of war.
   During his service career, Hall rose in rank to a point where he
could have provided ``a detailed and damaging look at our techniques
and capabilities when it comes to intercepting radio and voice
traffic and breaking codes,'' explained one official.
   ``But we've got to find out how far he went. He could have kept
his handlers happy with less sensitive stuff, too.''
   Added an Army source: ``He was a worker bee. He had familiarity
with the techniques and technology of the business of signals
intelligence. It's logical to say he could have really hurt us.''
   Chapla said Hall had been flown on an Army airplane from Fort
Stewart to Fort Meade on Thursday afternoon and that in the process,
legal jurisdiction over the warrant officer was shifted to the
commander of the Military District of Washington.
   That commander is Maj. Gen. Donald C. Hilbert. Should
investigators recommend a grand jury-type proceeding and court
martial, it will be up to Hilbert to decide how to proceed, Chapla
added.

<HEAD>Lowly Rodent Thrust To Forefront Of War On AIDS</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JERRY ESTILL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Researchers have infected mice with the AIDS
virus for the first time, moving the lowly rodent to the front lines
of the battle against the fatal disease.
   Mice have long been a staple of biomedical research, but until
scientists in California were able to develop mice with human immune
systems _ and then get the AIDS virus to spread in them _ the
animals had been largely useless in AIDS research.
   The main breakthrough _ getting a human immune system to function
in mice _ has had scientists excited since the work was reported in
Science magazine in September.
   The current issue of the magazine, out today, contains an updated
report from the same Stanford University researchers confirming
their assumption that they would be able to get the AIDS virus _ HIV
_ to ``take'' in their special mice.
   Mice with standard immune systems are impervious to the AIDS
virus.
   In another report in Science, scientists at the National
Institutes of Health provided additional information on their
previously reported success in producing mice that carry the genetic
code for the AIDS virus in every cell of their bodies.
   A third paper is on the work of scientists at the Hospital for
Sick Children in Toronto, Canada, who have transplanted human bone
marrow into mice with human-like immune systems. That research is
geared toward studying such blood diseases as leukemia and sickle
cell anemia.
   As previously reported, the human immune system was developed in
mice by transplanting liver, thymus, spleen and lymph node cells
from aborted human fetuses into them.
   The significance of all three reports is not in what has been
learned thus far about AIDS or any other specific disease, but
rather the demonstrated ability to use mice in new ways.
   For example, the Stanford scientists purposely limited the scope
of their initial efforts to infect mice with AIDS to observing them
for no more than eight weeks, too short to lead to full-blown AIDS,
but enough to show researchers the virus would flourish in their new
breed of mice.
   ``By limiting the study to eight weeks, we cannot yet predict
whether the mice would get the full AIDS syndrome,'' said Dr. Irving
Weissman, one of the Stanford researchers. ``It's too early to tell.
This experiment wasn't designed to mimic AIDS in human patients
exactly.''
   In a twist of irony, 127 of the 130 the special ``AIDS-coded''
mice developed at NIHealth died in a freak accident earlier this
month, when the ventalition system in the building housing them was
cut off too long during repairs.
   Although it will take four to five months to replenish the NIH
herd, Anthony S. Fauci, director of the National Institute of
Allergy and Infectious Disease said they ``are expected to be
valuable not only for better understanding of HIV effects on tissue,
but also for testing of therapeutics to prevent HIV-induced
disease.''
   In the NIH work, complete copies of the AIDS virus DNA were
injected into fertilized mouse eggs that subsequently were implanted
into adult female mice.
   Of the 64 mice born, researchers identified seven ``founder
mice'' that contained complete copies of the AIDS virus DNA in their
chromosomes and subsequently transmitted the copies to their
offspring.
   Dr. Malcolm Martin, head of the NIH team, said the accident was
made worse by the fact that none of the ``founder mice'' was among
the three survivors.

   The manager of the Savannah River nuclear
material production plant said Thursday the facility's reactors,
which have been shut down because of safety concerns, could be
restarted immediately if necessary.
   ``I certainly think they can be restarted safely,'' said John T.
Lowe. ``I think if the nation judged there was a need for the
materials ... they could be restarted today.''
   The plant near Aiken, S.C., is the nation's sole producer of
tritium, a crucial ingredient in nuclear weapons.
   Lowe, who works for Du Pont, the operator of the U.S. Department
of Energy plant, said in an interview Thursday with The Augusta
Chronicle and the Augusta Herald that political pressures have
contributed to recent, highly publicized problems at the plant.
   Lowe was interviewed on the same day that Energy Secretary John
Herrington announced that ultrasonic testing will be used to check
for possible cracks in reactor vessels. That could delay SRP's
restart until next summer.
   All three Savannah River reactors have been shut down since
summer for safety upgrades and maintenance.
   Lowe declined to say when he thought the plant would resume
operations.
   ``I think that remains to be defined. There has been speculation
that it would be six months or 12 months. I really think until the
... criteria are well defined ... it's sheer speculation to pick a
date,'' Lowe said.

<HEAD>Pentagon Says Official Mistaken In Listing Contractors Under
Investigation</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Pentagon official who told Congress eight
major defense contractors were under investigation for possible
illegal trading of classified documents was mistaken, a Pentagon
spokesman said.
   The spokesman, Dan Howard, said Thursday that only four of the
companies are being investigated.
   Howard said John F. Donnelly, director of the Defense
Investigative Service, ``made a mistake'' when he told the Joint
Economic Committee on Wednesday that Litton Systems Inc., McDonnell
Douglas Corp. Northrop Corp., and TRW Inc. remain part of the
Pentagon's investigation of alleged trafficking of department
secrets among defense contractors.
   Investigations of these companies were closed in 1986, Howard
said.
   Howard said Donnelly was correct in listing four other companies
as remaining under investigation. Those are General Dynamics Corp.,
Boeing Co., Matin Marietta Corp. and Saunders Associates Inc.
   Donnelly had insisted the eight companies remained under
investigation, even after being told by subcommittee members that
his testimony was at odds with a government report on the
investigation.
   The Pentagon also criticized the congressional panel for making
the information public. ``We do not approve of the committee making
public this type of information,'' the department said in a
statement.

   A predawn Kenny Loggins concert for
Japanese television drew a ``lynch mob'' of pajama-clad residents to
the stage after they were awakened by the big beat of the
unauthorized show, police said.
   ``Our switchboard lit up like the Rockefeller Center Christmas
tree,'' said Police Lt. Don Williams. Complaints began coming in
shortly before 5 a.m. Wednesday. The show was set for prime time in
Japan, just before 10 p.m.
   Williams said the show from the steps of the historic Old Mission
did not have the city's permission, and when officers arrived they
found a wooden stage full of rock musicians, speakers, electrical
generators, lights and cameras plus a production crew of 75.
   The singer-songwriter later left without being reached for
comment.
   Police shut the show down despite protests from the producer,
James Okumura of Los Angeles, who said he would lose millions of
dollars, according to Williams. Officials said permits he had
requested via facsimile machine a few hours before the show claimed
it would be ``low volume.''
   Some officers had to hold back angry neighborhood residents, many
of whom came to the scene in their nightclothes.
   ``Understandably, it resembled a lynch mob,'' Williams said.
   The Rev. Virgil Cordano of the Mission said he had been told the
production would be quiet, and he granted permission for use of the
building as a backdrop because ``it was good for Santa Barbara and
good for the Mission.''
   ``I thought I was doing the city of Santa Barbara a favor and
spreading the good news to Tokyo,'' he said.
   The matter will be forwarded to the City Attorney's office for
further review, police said.
   Okumura did not immediately return a telephone message left by
The Associated Press on his answering machine Thursday night.

   John F. Kennedy Jr. will join the office of
Manhattan District Attorney Robert M. Morgenthau in August, working
for a man who once worked as a prosecutor for his father.
   Kennedy, a 29-year-old third-year student at New York University
Law School, will start as a prosecutor at just under $30,000 a year
if he graduates next summer and passes the state bar examination,
according to prosecution sources who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Kennedy, interviewed earlier this month by Morgenthau, will be
one of 20 just-graduated new hires next summer. Until he passes the
bar exam he will not litigate cases. Instead he will help in
research and trial preparation.
   The fledgling prosecutor was spotted a few weeks ago in the
Manhattan Criminal Courts Building in the 11th-floor courtroom where
accused child killer Joel Steinberg is on trial for allegedly
beating his 6-year-old illegally adopted daughter to death. Kennedy
declined to talk to reporters.
   Morgenthau was appointed a U.S. attorney during President
Kennedy's administration. He resigned to run for governor of New
York against Nelson Rockefeller in 1962. He lost and resumed his job
as a prosecutor.

   Max von Sydow, whose roles have ranged from
Jesus Christ to intergalactic space villain Ming the Merciless,
dredged memories from his childhood in Sweden to play a downtrodden
field hand in his latest movie.
   In ``Pelle the Conqueror,'' which won top honors at this year's
Cannes Film Festival, Sydow portrays Lasse Karlsson, father of the
title character.
   The 59-year-old, 6-foot-4 actor tells the audience about the
itinerant farm worker's life of labor and oppression with a jerky,
shuffling walk _ hands flapping, elbows and knees protruding _
marked by habitual head bobbing of a servile peasant.
   The son of a university professor, von Sydow left the city after
the spring thaw to visit maternal relatives in Swedish farm country.
   ``I felt I knew this man,'' von Sydow said. ``I met people like
this, spent every summer with them.''
   The story of Pelle's struggle to overcome social restrictions and
farm labor poverty accurately depicts real life during von Sydow's
childhood, the actor said.
   ``The social structure in Scandinavia was pretty primitive in
rural areas until, oh, the early '40s,'' he said. ``The people who
worked the big farms were essentially migrant workers.''
   Von Sydow has appeared on stage, and in numerous films including,
``The Greatest Story Ever Told,'' in which he played Jesus; ``The
Exorcist,'' and ``Flash Gordon,'' in which he portrayed the
science-fiction villain Ming.

   PEAPACK-GLADSTONE, N.J. (AP) _ It's no king's ransom, but even
the monarch from Morocco has to enjoy unexpected tax rebates.
   The borough council determined this week that King Hassan II of
Morocco had paid too much in 1988. A check of $4,894 was sent to
Hassan, who owns 500 acres of property in Peapack-Gladstone and two
adjacent towns.
   Councilman Douglas McDowell said the refund comes from tax
appeals heard by the Somerset County Board of Taxation that were not
contested by the borough.
   Last month, Hassan was awarded a $146,000 rebate on his county
taxes because his estate was overappraised. The county revised his
land's appraised value from $25.98 million to $7.3 million.
   As a result, the monarch's 1988 county tax bill was cut from
$204,591 to $57,764.
   The king's attorney, Thomas Goodwin of Saddle River, argued
before county tax officials in October that 225 acres of the king's
estate should be assessed at cheaper farmland rates for 1988. In
addition, Goodwin maintained the remaining 97 acres the monarch owns
in the borough also were assessed too high.
   The king's land is spread over Bedminster, Far Hills and
Peapack-Gladstone.

   Gov. Ned McWherter on Thursday blocked a
Jan. 26 parole hearing for the man convicted in the 1968 sniper
slaying of civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr.
   McWherter exercised a law giving the governor authority to halt
early parole hearings for prisoners convicted of certain crimes.
   James Earl Ray, 60, is serving 99 years in prison for
first-degree murder of King in Memphis on April 4, 1968.
   A 1985 law designed to reduce prison overcrowding made Ray
eligible for a parole hearing in November.
   ``We've been advised that he (Ray) is among that class of inmates
who will be affected by that order,'' said Jim Kennedy, McWherter's
chief of staff.
   Kennedy said the order was effective immediately for Ray, who has
been turned down for early parole at least twice before.
   David Welles, legal counsel for the governor, said McWherter's
decision would not affect Ray's original parole eligibility date in
1998 but removes him from consideration for an early release because
of his escape record.
   Ray was a fugitive from a Missouri prison at the time of King's
murder. He is held at Brushy Mountain State Prison, from which he
escaped in June 1977 and was tracked down and placed briefly on
Death Row in Nashville.
   King was in Memphis to assist in a strike by city sanitation
workers seeking higher pay on the day he was felled by a sniper's
bullet. Ray was identified from fingerprints found on a rifle near
the Lorraine Motel, where King was standing on a balcony at the time
of his death.
   Ray pleaded guilty on the day of his trial on March 9, 1969, but
retracted his story three days later and has since maintained his
innocence.
   McWherter had said he opposed Ray's parole but would not try to
influence the state Board of Paroles, which is independent from the
administration.

   Lucky the lobster has gone back to sea, thanks
to an outpouring of support for the 17-pound crustacean who proved
too big for the tank at the Fisherman's Galley seafood restaurant.
   Waitresses took up a collection from staff and customers to pay
the giant critter's expenses for a trip to Portsmouth, N.H., where
it recently boarded a lobster boat for the trip out to sea.
   ``The chef and I packed him up and off he went,'' said restaurant
manager Paul Renaud. Lucky, wrapped in salt-water-soaked paper,
traveled in an insulated box with ice packs. Lobsters can breathe
out of water.
   Lucky's driver was Shelley Pierce, a waitress and one of his most
ardent supporters.
   Renaud said one of the restaurant's reasons for giving up Lucky
was that it needed room in its tank for other, more normal-size
lobsters.

   The Lindermes, both born on Dec. 21, didn't expect the baby until
Dec. 27. Nevertheless, he emerged at 5:30 p.m. Wednesday in
Providence Hospital in Holyoke.
   Linderme, a 25-year-old Holyoke landscaper, said he thought he
might get an unexpected birthday gift when his 22-year-old wife woke
him at 2 a.m. with contractions.
   ``I was pretty amazed that she was going to have it that day,''
he said. ``You can't ask for a better birthday present.''
   The odds of three people in the same family being born on the
same day are 7.5 in 1 million, according to John Buonaccorsi, a
mathematics professor at the University of Massachusetts in Amherst.

   A suburban fire company that published a 1989
calendar displaying photographs of scantily clad women will bow to
complaints from feminists by publishing a beefcake version for 1990.
   ``We know what these ladies want, and we'll give it to them,''
said Dan Haeck, chief of the Pleasant Hills Volunteer Fire Co.
``They say we've exploited women with our calendar. Well, next year
we'll even up the score.''
   A calendar featuring scantily clad men will accompany the next
version of the cheesecake calendar, he said recently.
   ``We're not real good-looking guys, so we might only use a couple
of our guys and hire professionals,'' Haeck said.
   Haeck said the company received letters from women demanding the
second version featuring men.
   Meanwhile, he said, the 1989 ``Blazes of Glory'' calendar is
``selling ... like crazy.''
   The company produced the calendar, priced at $12.95 by mail,
after more traditional fund-raising methods failed to raise the
$800,000 needed to for fire equipment.

   Yes, Virginia, even Santa Claus gets parking
tickets.
   Wes Rupell looked authentic when he pulled up at the Hughes
Justice Complex on Thursday to distribute candy canes and yuletide
cheer. He sported a real beard, jingle bells, spectacles, rosy
cheeks and the requisite red suit.
   But that didn't prevent the long arm of the law from slapping him
with a parking ticket at the state-operated child care center.
   ``I say, `Bah, humbug! Three days before Christmas a Santa gets a
ticket,'' said Cindy Carella, who runs the Justice Juniors center,
which cares for children of state employees.
   It seems the officer who spotted his car illegally parked in a
popular spot outside the state's headquarters for law and order
didn't buy the sign he posted in his window. The sign said Santa was
making a brief stop inside at a children's party.
   Ms. Carella said Rupell spent about 30 minutes with the 25
youngsters, distributing candy canes and letting them sit on his
lap. Because parking is tight at the state building, she had told
him to park in front if he couldn't find a spot.
   ``Everyone should have a Santa like this,'' she said. ``He even
ties jingle bells to his pants so he jingles when he walks.''
   Ms. Carella said she will foot the bill.

   Gov. Michael Dukakis gave President-elect George
Bush some early praise in his first interview since losing the
election, and said he was still ``decompressing'' from the campaign
and wouldn't want to replay it.
   ``There's not much sense in rerunning the campaign,'' the
defeated Democratic candidate told The Associated Press on Thursday.
   ``I mean, we did some things well, we did other things not so
well. It wasn't successful. Obviously, I'm disappointed. Lots of
people are disappointed. We worked very hard. But I don't think it's
something to dwell on.''
   Dukakis declined an opportunity to criticize Bush, whom he had
lambasted during a bitter campaign, saying he would give the
president-elect ``a good six months to a year'' before speaking out.
   However, the governor, who attacked President Reagan's policy in
Central America during the campaign, said he was pleased by reports
that Bush has decided not to ask Congress immediately for renewed
U.S. support for the rightist Contra rebels in Nicaragua and that
Bush hopes to forge a bipartisan consensus and involve Latin leaders.
   ``I think it's the right policy,'' Dukakis said. ``When I met
with him I strongly urged him to do that. I said I think the present
policy is a failure, it's getting worse not better.''
   ``If that's the way the new administration begins, then I think
that's hopeful,'' the governor said.
   Dukakis, who held one press conference immediately after his loss
to assess the campaign, refused to review the campaign in detail,
saying he preferred to focus on the future.
   But he also declined to tip his hand about any plans he may have
for his own career after his current term as governor ends in 1990.
Dukakis has refused previously to say whether he would run for
president again.
   ``It's much too early. At this point, I'm decompressing, working
hard on what's happening here, enjoying a certain amount of normalcy
in my life,'' he said.
   Seated in his Statehouse office after a week's vacation in
Florida, Dukakis appeared relaxed and reflective, more interested in
his state's budget problems than in the national agenda he was
pushing before losing to Bush 54 percent to 46 percent just six
weeks ago.
   ``It's been quite a year. And I must say it's nice to reflect a
little bit on the blessings of life, welcome my crew home and to
play the role of father and husband, and enjoy and relax a little
bit,'' Dukakis said.
   Asked if he ever has days when he wishes he could have another
shot at the campaign, or even another week to battle Bush, Dukakis
said no.
   ``At some point, there has to be a conclusion. You work hard to
that day, then people go and vote. Certainly, nobody ever suggested
American presidential campaigns are too short. Twenty months is a
long time.''
   Dukakis, who had never waged a national political campaign
before, said his biggest surprise was the change that overtook him
immediately after the Democratic National Convention in July.
   ``I think the one thing that you never quite experience until you
experience it is the post-convention period _ when, unfortunately,
you are kind of walled off from citizens, communities. ...
   ``Everything you do is a kind of massive public event. I found
that difficult, frustrating. I don't think it's good. But it is the
presidency and the most important political office there is, and
that's the reality,'' Dukakis said.
   The governor said the process could be improved. ``But at this
point,'' he said, ``I don't have any brilliant ideas for changing
it.''
   Asked to evaluate Bush's initial appointments and policy
statements, Dukakis said it's too soon to draw conclusions.
   ``A new president deserves a chance to put a team together and
get under way. Everything isn't going to be perfect; there will be
bumps along the way,'' Dukakis said.
   ``These are all things that had been deferred, swept under the
rug _ this kind of thing. He's got to deal with them,'' Dukakis said.

   Terrorism has been on everyone's mind in
Washington for years. The toll it has taken is long and painful.
Children, U.S. servicemen, neutral diplomats and even a
wheelchair-bound American tourist are among the victims.
   So it was not surprising that Clovis Maksoud, a representative of
the Arab League, was short about half his audience Thursday when he
held his annual year-end review in one of Washington's snazzier
hotels.
   The absent reporters who specialize on developments in the Middle
East were busy chasing the possibility that terrorists may have been
behind the crash of a Pan American World Airways jumbo jet carrying
258 passengers in Scotland, killing them and another 22 people on
the ground.
   The busy reporters might as well have attended Maksoud's report
over lunch on developments this year in the Middle East and
expectations for 1989. By day's end it was not clear exactly what
caused the jet to crash.
   Many experts believe there was an explosion on the plane, and
among them there is widespread suspicion of sabotage. But the cause
could have been heavy winds, said L. Paul Bremer, who heads the
State Department's office of counterterrorism. ``We don't know if
this is a terrorist attack.''
   Nonetheless, terrorism is in the news again.
   Just last week, the issue dominated the headlines and telecasts
in what may yet prove to be a positive turn of events.
   The United States decided to open a ``substantive dialogue'' with
the Palestine Liberation Organization based on a judgment that
Chairman Yasser Arafat had renounced terrorism.
   No one is making the suggestion, publicly or privately, that the
PLO had anything to do with the crash in Scotland.
   But the Reagan administration thought it had reached a milestone
in the struggle against terrorism.
   The head of a group Secretary of State George P. Shultz had only
recently accused of terrorism said the magic words. Arafat,
condemned by Shultz as an ``accessory,'' suddenly qualified _ by
renouncing terrorism and recognizing Israel _ for the
semi-recognition that a ``substantive dialogue'' implies.
   But with the victory came a burden _ for Arafat and for the
United States in judging the PLO.
   Each incident will be scrutnized for evidence of complicity, to
see if his renunciation of terrorism ``in all forms'' will hold up.
   The first U.S. session with the PLO was held last Friday in
Tunisia. Assistant Secretary of State Richard W. Murphy warned the
next day that it would be the last if terrorism traceable to the PLO
recurred. The warning was echoed by other top U.S. officials.
   Maksoud, who considers the dialogue long overdue, detected
``lingering hangups'' in the warnings. He said the U.S. officials
were ``a little bit on the defensive unnecessarily... as if they've
done something wrong but necessary.''
   Maksoud, a seasoned observer, sees the U.S.-PLO talks as neither
the ``breakthrough'' claimed in some Arab quarters or the threat
perceived by some Israelis and their supporters. To him, the
expressions of anxiety are ``contrived paranoia'' designed to
influence the outgoing Reagan and incoming Bush administrations.
   And yet, U.S. officials will be watching the PLO very closely to
see if Arafat's renunciation of terrorism _ with U.S. prompting _
holds up. That could influence whether the Bush administration tries
to persuade Israel to negotiate with the PLO or lends U.S. support
to the idea of a Palestinian state.
   There are problems in keeping watch, however.
   The PLO is a loosely-knit organization. It is not clear that
Arafat will or can exercise control over all factions. Nor is it
clear how much support his statement has within the group.
   Moreover, defining terrorism has always been elusive.
   Last Sunday, Salah Khalaf, who is second-in-command to Arafat in
Fatah, the mainstream PLO faction, said the chairman's
`'denunciation of terrorism in Geneva did not include military
attacks against Israel.''
   Khalaf, known also as Abu Iyad, added: ``Our struggle will
continue until we raise the PLO flag over Jerusalem.''
   On Monday, a member of the PLO's executive committee said Arafat
had expressed only his ``personal opinion'' in renouncing terrorism
and recognizing Israel's right to exist.
   In fact, Mustafa el-Zibri said, the statements were
``incompatible with the resolutions of the latest Palestine National
Council meeting.''
   The State Department had detected some positive movement at the
Council meeting, but no turnabout in the PLO's stance.

<HEAD>Bush Says He Shares Reagan's View On Libyan Chemical Plant</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   President-elect Bush says he shares President
Reagan's determination to prevent a huge Libyan chemical weapons
factory from being used ``to spread further destruction'' but will
not go into detail about means of doing so.
   Answering reporters' questions after announcing his latest
Cabinet appoinments Thursday, Bush said he thought the matter should
be discussed at an international conference on chemical weapons, set
for Jan. 6 in Paris.
   ``One shouldn't give up on trying to turn around the Libyan
regime,'' he said. ``But what happens beyond that, if there is a
direct refusal to do that, what ... the free world, and I think that
most of the world, frankly, would mandate, then we'll consider
options at that time.''
   Asked specifically whether he shared the Reagan administration's
commitment to preventing the spread of chemical weapons by Libya, he
said that ``not only should our administration be committed to that,
but in my view, any civilized country around the world should be
committed to that objective.''
   ``And in terms of what means one uses to achieve that end, I
think it would be inappropriate to go into detail,'' he said. ``It
does seem to me that our allies can help ... and, yes, we all ought
to be committed to seeing that that plant not ... spread further
destruction.''
   Meanwhile Clovis Maksoud, the Arab League's representative in
Washington, said it was ``not true'' that Libya was producing
chemical weapons.
   ``This atmosphere of creating a focus on Libya as a scapegoat may
be an attempt, directly or indirectly, by the Israelis to shift from
the central challenge of the peace offensive that the PLO (Palestine
Liberation Organization) and the Arabs are undertaking,'' Maksoud
told reporters.
   He said the U.S. accusation ``might give a prior pretext for
those who want to strike at an Arab country in order to prevent the
maturing of the moderating developments that are taking place in the
Arab world as a result primarily of the Arab-PLO dialogue.''
   Reagan, in an interview broadcast Thursday evening on ABC-TV,
said military action against the Libyan site has been discussed by
the United States and its allies, but ``that's a decision that has
not been made yet.'' The portion of the interview containing the
remark was included in the network's Wednesday night newscast.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater, asked about the
president's remark, said, `The president was quite clear that
military action is an option. We're not ruling it out.''
   The United States ``is extremely concerned about production
facilities in Libya ... which we believe can produce enormous
quantities of chemical weapons,'' Fitzwater said.
   Asked whether a U.S. strike against the facility is under
consideration, the spokesman said, ``I'm not saying it's our
intention. ... We will not rule out options.''

   The Philippine military has denied
responsibility for issuing Christmas cards that suggest recipients
should spend the season of peace killing Communist rebels.
   The cards, which have been circulating in Manila, feature the
following message on the front: ``On Christmas Day, don't sit around
the tree.'' Inside the card it reads, ``Kill an NPA rebel,''
referring to the New People's Army.
   Another card shows a woman receiving a Christmas package, and
beneath the drawing it reads, ``On Christmas Day, express your love
to an NPA.'' Inside, a package is shown exploding, followed by this
message: ``A gift to last a lifetime.''
   Some of the cards feature facsimile signatures of Defense
Secretary Fidel Ramos and Chief of Staff Gen. Renato de Villa.
   But Brig. Gen. Honesto Isleta, chief of the civil-military
relations service, denied Thursday the military had sent the cards
and said they were aimed at discrediting the armed forces.
   ``It is aimed at creating an impression to the recepient that the
sender does not respect the season of love,'' Isleta said. ``The
card is designed to discredit us.''

<HEAD>DOT Rules Logan Airport Landing Fee Plan Discriminatory, Court
Fight Vowed</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTOPHER CALLAHAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The operators of Logan International Airport
are vowing to challenge in court a government order that rejects a
new landing fee system designed to cut traffic at the congested
Boston airfield by discouraging small planes.
   The Transportation Department ruled Thursday that Logan's landing
fee structure, which had been closely watched by the aviation
community as a possible national precedent, was unreasonable,
discriminatory and in violation of federal law.
   Deputy Transportation Secretary Mimi Weyforth Dawson signed an
order that gives the Massachusetts Port Authority seven days to
rescind its fee structure or lose eligibility for $10.2 million in
federal aviation improvement grants for the current fiscal year.
   MassPort officials immediately attacked the ruling.
   ``It sounds like the Department of Transportation has really just
given in to political pressure from powerful special interest groups
and turned its back on millions of air travelers in New England and
throughout the nation,'' said Thomas Champion, assistant to the
executive director at MassPort.
   But opponents of the Logan plan hailed the ruling as a victory
for commuter air passengers, private plane pilots and small-town
America.
   ``This is a tremendous victory for greater public access to our
major airports,'' said Rep. Silvio O. Conte, R-Mass., author of the
law that authorized the cutoff of federal funds to Logan if the
Transportation Department agreed that the landing fees were unfair.
   Operators of other major airports, including those in Los
Angeles, Denver and Minneapolis, were awaiting the decision to see
if the stiff fee structure could be used as a model in their own
battles to reduce air traffic, said Rep. Sherwood L. Boehlert,
R-N.Y., a leading congressional opponent of the landing fee plan.
   Small commuter airlines and private plane owners vehemently
fought against the proposal, saying it would lock them out of Logan
and deprive air service to passengers in small communities where
there is no access to major airlines.
   Under Logan's revised fee structure, large jets are paying
significantly less than before, while small aircraft had their
landing fees increase from $25 to more than $100.
   Logan officials defended the new fee structure, which went into
effect in July after a federal district judge in Boston ruled that
the fees were not discriminatory.
   Champion said the landing fee plan had succeeded in reducing
congestion at Logan, which is the largest airport in New England,
and that access had not been restricted for commuters.
   The new fee structure was based on a combination of airplanes'
weight and other operating costs.
   The original fee rate charged planes a minimum of $25 or $1.31
per 1,000 pounds, which ever was greater. Most small planes paid
$25. Under the revised fee structure, which was increased again in
October, all planes are assessed a $103 flat fee plus 55 cents per
1,000 pounds.
   MassPort Executive Director David W. Davis said fees for a Boeing
747, which had ranged up to $800, have been cut roughly in half
under the new fee structure while the landing fee for a Cessna 402
seating 10 passengers jumped from $25 to about $105.

<HEAD>Official Questions ``Fairness Opinions'' to Company Stockholders</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The chairman of the Securities and Exchange
Commission has questioned the independence of financial advisers who
tell stockholders a proposed leveraged buyout of their company is a
good deal.
   David S. Ruder told a House panel Thursday that experts who write
``fairness opinions'' often get higher fees if the deal goes
through. The opinions offer conclusions on the fairness of a buyout
offer.
   Asked by Rep. Mike Synar, D-Okla., whether fairness opinions were
independent, Ruder said, ``All in all, I am quite suspicious in a
significant number of cases, that the fairness opinion is prepared
by somebody with an incentive to go along with management.
   ``Personally, I think that needs to be addressed.''
   Ruder said he was giving the House Energy and Commerce
telecommunications and finance subcommittee his personal opinion _
not that of the SEC, which is currently reviewing all aspects of
leveraged buyouts.
   Leveraged buyouts occur when investors borrow heavily to buy out
a company and then pay off the debt with that company's cash flow or
by the sale of its assets.
   Ruder said the commission wants to determine whether it should
issue new rules to protect investors, and predicted the review would
continue at least through February.
   Fairness opinions are primary factors in the transactions, Ruder
said, because ``shareholders accord a great degree of weight to the
fact that a favorable opinion has been issued.''
   The opinions usually attest that the price offered for shares of
a company is a fair one.
   The hired financial adviser must rely almost exclusively on the
limited information that management supplies about the company.
   Subcommittee Chairman Edward Markey, D-Mass., said an investment
bank may receive $1 million to prepare the opinion, but $1.5 million
if the deal goes through.
   ``It sounds a little bit like a kickback to outsiders,'' Markey
said.

   President-elect Bush's selection of Manuel
Lujan Jr. as interior secretary surprised almost everybody, because
the veteran New Mexico congressman said earlier this month he
wouldn't take the job if it were offered.
   Lujan, 60, is a Republican who announced in January he was
retiring from the House after 10 terms because wife ``Jean and I
thought it was time to come home.''
   He changed his mind even after specifically declaring himself out
of the running for the Interior Department post. Lujan told
reporters earlier this month that Bush transition aide Chase
Untermeyer had asked him if he would take the job, and ``I told him
I would not. I said I really didn't want to go back into government,
but I might be willing to serve on a board or something like that.''
   Reaction to the appointment was mixed.
   ``It's a solid choice. He's better than most of the names we've
been hearing,'' said Paul Pritchard, president of the National Parks
and Conservation Association, a frequent critic of the Reagan
administration.
   ``He will work well with Congress, and he knows where the bodies
are buried,'' Pritchard said.
   But Brock Evans, Washington vice president of the National
Audubon Society, said, ``I have the same heavy feeling in my heart
that I did eight years ago'' when James Watt was appointed to the
post by President Reagan. Lujan was a defender of Watt during his
controversial tenure.
   ``We feel as if we had just been given a lump of coal,'' said
Jeff Webb, president of Friends of the Earth.
   A fiscally conservative mainstream Republican from a prominent
New Mexico Hispanic political family, Lujan was the second-ranking
GOP member of the House Interior and Insular Affairs Committee. He
has devoted most of his time recently to the Science, Space and
Technology Committee, where he was the senior Republican.
   Because of his withdrawal, Lujan had hardly figured in
speculation for the slot, and was not on a list of four
``acceptable'' names submitted to the Bush transition team by
Western Republican senators.
   The choice could be a signal that Bush is serious about new
energy development _ Lujan was a sponsor of the principal bill in
the last session that would have opened the Arctic National Wildlife
Refuge to oil exploration.
   Environmentalists have strongly opposed exploration in that area,
on Alaska's North Slope 65 miles east of the existing fields at
Prudhoe Bay. Congress took no action on the issue.
   The League of Conservation Voters awarded Lujan a low score, 13
out of a possible 100. Lujan voted according to the
``environmentalist'' position only twice out of 16 test votes.
   However, Pritchard said Lujan had been responsive to concerns
about parks and historic preservation.
   The Wilderness Society expressed a split view, saying in a
statement by Vice President Sydney J. Butler that though they
differed on Alaska oil development, Lujan ``has been accessible to
the conservation community.''
   Rep. Leon Panetta, D-Calif., who has led the so-far successful
fight to ban oil exploration in federal waters off central and
northern California, said Lujan ``has not stood in the way of
measures to protect the California coast'' and ``will bring an open
mind to the issue.''
   The U.S. Chamber of Commerce hailed Lujan as ``clearly a friend
of business'' with an 80 percent favorable voting record, according
to the chamber's tabulation.
   Lujan, who now lives in Albuquerque, is a 1950 graduate of the
College of Santa Fe, where he grew up and where his father served as
mayor in the 1940s.
   He will be the second Hispanic in the Bush Cabinet. Education
Secretary Lauro Cavazos has been asked by Bush to stay on.
   ``I went to Washington to balance the budget and we still haven't
done it,'' Lujan once said when asked to name his biggest
disappointment.
   In 1986, he suffered a heart attack and underwent a triple bypass
operation, but in January he said he was not leaving Congress
because of ill health _ rather, ``It was always my fear that I would
stay too long and not have my health.''

   William Reilly, President-elect Bush's choice
to head the Environmental Protection Agency, is a former land use
planner who has spent 15 years leading a foundation that tries to
solve environmental conflicts through consensus.
   Reilly, who turns 49 on Jan. 26, is president of the Conservation
Foundation and of the U.S. affiliate of the World Wildlife Fund, two
organizations whose merger he engineered in 1985.
   The Wildlife Fund has concentrated on preservation of wildlife
and habitat in the tropics, urging reversal of worldwide
deforestation that is clearing total acreage the size of Missouri
each year.
   The Conservation Foundation, which Reilly took over in 1973, is a
research group that has sponsored several convocations of industry
and environmentalists to try to resolve particular local issues.
   Unlike many Washington environmental groups, it does not lobby or
file lawsuits.
   The fund has been the nation's fastest-growing environmental
organization in recent years, tripling its membership to 500,000
since 1985.
   During Bush's announcement ceremony Thursday, Reilly said he
believed he was the first head of such an organization chosen to run
the EPA, and he pledged a ``new and constructive course'' on
environmental problems at home and around the world.
   In a recent interview, Reilly attributed his organization's
growth to the response to active solicitation among a population
exposed to a steady diet of nature programs on television.
   ``The public watches enormous amounts of nature films,'' Reilly
said. ``I worry about saturation, but people who know about these
things tell me not to.''
   And, he said, ``The people who elected George Bush are worried
about the international environment.''
   Reilly has paid particular attention to the ``greenhouse effect''
_ the global warming predicted to result from the use of fossil
fuels. Unlike many environmentalists, he has not ruled out nuclear
power as a benign energy source, and he was considering the
formation of another all-viewpoints study group on nuclear power.
   He serves on the board of several non-pofit organizations and of
Northeast Utilities Inc.
   He said he believed environmentalists were coming to ``two new
awarenessess,'' that ``the environment is much less under control
than we believed'' and ``the degree to which we appear to be hostage
to other countries for our health and well-being.''
   Though no defender of controversial former Interior Secretary
James Watt, he said Watt's $1 billion, four-year renovation of
national park structures ``made a lot of sense'' but ``natural
systems didn't get the same kind of attention.''
   On the parks, the Bush administration ``has got to take the
external threats issue seriously. That's a tough issue for a
conservative administration.'' Park advocates have complained that
threats of development up against park boundaries are spoiling many
parks.
   Reilly has enjoyed the confidence of the outgoing administrator
of EPA, Lee M. Thomas, and Thomas' predecessor, William D.
Ruckelshaus, who turned to the foundation for several studies.
   During the Reagan administration, the foundation has produced
three major ``state of the environment'' documents and, among other
things, major studies of groundwater contamination and national
parks. Before that, it was a pioneer in calling attention to the
dangers of excessive use of pesticides.
   In 1984, the foundation helped organize Clean Sites Inc., which
organizes cleanup of toxic waste by polluting companies themselves.
Clean Sites was begun with chemical industry money but now gets
two-thirds of its funds elsewhere.
   EPA backed a major study of wetlands by the foundation and the
National Governors Association, which recommended last month a goal
of creating enough new wetlands to more than offset the loss of
bogs, swamps, fens, marshes and estuaries to development. Bush has
endorsed the ``no net loss'' goal.
   Thomas turned to Reilly this fall to organize a study of the
Superfund toxic waste cleanup program that would bring industry and
environmentalists together. The environmentalists, however, objected
that the study could be a cover for weakening the program and
declined to participate.
   Reilly is a protege of former EPA administrator Russell Train,
for whom he worked on the staff of the White House Council on
Environmental Quality in 1970-1972. Train is now chairman of the
U.S. World Wildlife Fund affiliate and of the Conservation
Foundation.
   Train was an adviser to Bush on environmental issues and
solicited support for Bush among environmentalists.
   Thomas hailed Reilly's selection as being ``truly outstanding.''
Ruckelshaus said, ``The country, the Bush administration, the people
of EPA and our environment will all be better off.''
   ``This is a positive signal from the president-elect that he
intends to carry out his campaign commitments to environmental
protection,'' said John Adams, executive director of the Natural
Resources Defense Council.
   A graduate of Yale University who holds a law degree from Harvard
and a master's degree in planning from Columbia, Reilly was born in
Decatur, Ill., spent his childhood nearby and went to high school in
Fall River, Mass.
   After college graduation in 1962, he served in the Army,
practiced law in Chicago, attended graduate scool and served as
associate director of the Urban Policy Center before joining the
Council on Environmental Quality.

   Homelessness and inadequate home heating are
factors in the jump in the number of freezing deaths in the United
States, which has more than doubled in a decade, federal officials
say.
   The national Centers for Disease Control reported Thursday that
in 1985, the latest year for which complete statistics are
available, 1,010 people died from exposure to the cold, a 137
percent increase from the 427 deaths reported in 1976.
   More research needs to be done, but the numbers strongly suggest
more and more Americans are dying from the cold, the CDC said.
   The vast majority of the deaths were technically due to
hypothermia _ decreased body temperature, or freezing to death.
   ``It's either increased cold ... which is unlikely, or it's more
people exposed to more intense or more frequent stresses from the
cold,'' said Dr. Edwin Kilbourne, CDC researcher.
   Kilbourne said that while it's possible that many of the deaths
were due to inadequate home heating, another part of the problem is
the significant number of people who have no shelter at all to call
their own.
   ``A person who has to sleep outdoors, they certainly run a higher
risk of problems like hypothermia,'' he said.
   Social service officials have said the number of homeless people
has risen in recent years. Estimates of the number nationwide are as
high as 3 million.
   As the nation ages, Kilbourne said, more research is needed to
determine just who is freezing to death: homeless people _ typically
middle-aged men _ who have no shelter from the cold, or older people
less able to withstand low temperatures and possibly living with
insufficient heat.
   ``In the past, at least in certain cases, hypothermia has been
thought of as a problem of middle-aged male alcoholics ... a `street
person.' We really don't know if that remains the profile,''
Kilbourne said.
   People 60 and older are particularly susceptible to hypothermia,
and account for more than half of all hypothermia deaths, according
to previous studies. Children under a year old also are at high
risk, although hypothermia deaths are rare in children.
   ``Hypothermia prevention programs should focus on persons
particularly susceptible ... and those likely to be subjected to
unusual cold stress,'' the Atlanta-based CDC said in its weekly
report.
   The agency said special attention should be paid to proper
nutrition and home heating for the elderly, shelter for the homeless
and precautions for young people in the outdoors, such as skiers and
hikers.

<HEAD>Sullivan Seeks Better Health Care For Poor</HEAD>
<HEAD>With PM-Bush Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Dr. Louis W. Sullivan, named to head the
Department of Health and Human Services, leads one of three
predominantly black medical schools in the nation and is a longtime
advocate of improved health care for disadvantaged Americans.
   In selecting Sullivan on Thursday, President-elect Bush fulfilled
his pledge to name a black to his Cabinet. But the much-anticipated
nomination was assured only after Sullivan quelled a last-minute
outcry from anti-abortion forces.
   Their objections were triggered by an Atlanta newspaper interview
Sunday in which Sullivan said he supports a woman's right to seek an
abortion, though he opposes federal assistance for it.
   On Monday, Sullivan wrote a letter to The Atlanta Journal and The
Atlanta Constitution saying he is ``opposed to abortion except in
cases of rape, incest and where the life of the mother is
threatened'' _ a statement mirroring Bush's views and one which he
repeated at the President-elect's side in Washington on Thursday.
   Sullivan also declared that the ``nation must address the
disparity that exists in the availability and quality of health
care'' for Americans of differing economic means.
   Similarly, Sullivan had set as the ``abiding goal'' of his
institution the training of doctors willing to establish family
practices in rural and inner-city areas.
   Sullivan, 55, a blood specialist, has been president of the
Morehouse School of Medicine in Atlanta since it became independent
from Morehouse College in 1981. He has taught medicine at Harvard,
Morehouse, the New Jersey College of Medicine and Boston University,
where he graduated with honors in 1958.
   Sullivan returned to BU as an assistant medical professor in
1966. While there, he distinguished himself as a hematologist and
implemented the first minority recruiting program at the school.
   ``Doctor Sullivan is an unusually able physician and
administrator,'' said Hugh Gloster, retired president of Morehouse
College, who hired Sullivan.
   ``He tends to delegate but he handles the important things
himself. He makes the big presentations.''
   He described Sullivan as a charismatic man whose selection to
head the school was the result of an extensive national search. ``I
doubt if there is anyone better qualified,'' he said.
   At Morehouse, Sullivan oversees a faculty and staff of about 100
and currently has no teaching assignments.
   The medical school separated from Morehouse College in 1981 when
it began offering graduate degrees. Its new campus was dedicated in
1982 in a ceremony attended by Bush, whose wife, Barbara, was named
to the medical school's board of trustees in 1983. Sullivan
accompanied the Bushes during a trip to Africa in 1982.
   Sullivan has written or co-written more than 60 technical
articles, mostly dealing with blood chemistry and diseases.
   He has directed national research on sickle cell anemia, a fatal
blood disease that primarily affects blacks. The Atlanta native is a
former president of the Foundation for Minority Health Professions,
and has often expressed concern over the low number of minorities
entering medicine.
   At the same time, he has said that Morehouse, while heavily
black, welcomes white students, especially those willing to practice
medicine in rural or urban poor areas.
   Sullivan, a 1954 honors graduate of Morehouse College and a
graduate of the Boston University Medical School, and his wife,
Ginger, have three children.
   He is active in the American Red Cross and the American Cancer
Society, and serves on the National Executive Board of the Boy
Scouts of America.

   Edward J. Derwinski, a surprise nominee to
become the first secretary of the new Department of Veterans
Affairs, is a former long-time Illinois congressman who lost his
seat at the hands of redistricting.
   Derwinski's selection Thursday by President-elect Bush surprised
advocates for veterans groups and those who deal with veterans
issues in Congress because he has dealt little with issues of
concern to veterans.
   ``I'll admit it was a surprise to me,'' said Rep. G.V.
Montgomery, D-Miss., chairman of the House Veterans Affairs
Committee. ``His name had never even surfaced.''
   One congressional aide described the Capitol Hill reaction as a
``giant shock.''
   Derwinski, 62, did not serve on veterans committees in Congress,
and since then he has worked at the State Department. However,
initial reaction among veterans and their advocates was supportive.
   ``I think he'll be a strong and balanced advocate to be sure
veterans get their share of whatever pie is available for
allocation,'' said Gen. Richard G. Stilwell, a retired Army officer
who served as deputy undersecretary of defense in the Reagan
administration.
   Montgomery, who successfully pushed legislation to upgrade the
Veterans Administration to a Cabinet level department, called him
``a fine choice.''
   ``He has a great wit that will be an asset as he tackles this
tough new job,'' Montgomery said. ``A number of us who sponsored the
Cabinet-level job were looking for a strong spokesman for veterans.
I believe we have the right person in Derwinski.''
   John Hanson, spokesman for the American Legion, said Derwinski
has spoken twice to Legion meetings on international issues.
   ``We've worked with him before,'' Hanson said. ``He's been
friendly and we look forward to seeing him again,.''
   Derwinski has been undersecretary of state for security
assistance, science and technology, a post he assumed in April 1987.
He was named counselor of the State Department in 1983 after leaving
Congress, and served as a special adviser to the secretary of state.
   In those jobs he has been in charge of State Department dealings
with the transfers of arms and sensitive technology. As the
department's international sports coordinator, he worked with Korean
authorities on security arrangements at the Seoul Olympics this year.
   In Congress, Derwinski was known for his trademark crew cut and
loud sportcoats, and for his puckish humor.
   At the VA, he will head a huge bureacuracy with 240,000
employees, a budget of more than $10 billion and the largest
hospital system in the nation.
   The VA has undergone serious financial difficulties as a result
of budget constraints at a time when more veterans are becoming
elderly and are in need of care at VA hospitals, nursing homes and
other medical facilities.
   The current administrator, Thomas Turnage, has come under fire in
Congress as a result of cutbacks in hospital care. Critics have
faulted him for failing to aggressively seek larger budget
appropriation requests within the administration.
   In hearings earlier this year, Montgomery's committee heard
testimony that 8,000 to 10,000 of the VA's 72,000 beds had been put
out of service because of money problems.
   ``It's not going to be an easy job because at the start of the
new Congress we're going to have to seek additional funds,''
Montgomery said. ``We're turning away patients now. We just never
have gotten enough money to run them. He's got his work cut out for
him.''
   Derwinski, a Chicago native, served in the Army in the Pacific
during World War II. He was a member of Congress from 1959 to 1983
from Illinois' 4th Congressional District. He served on the Foreign
Affairs and Post Office and Civil Service committees.
   Derwinski's district was combined with that of another Republican
congressman, George O'Brien, in reapportionment after the 1980
census. The two opposed each other in a Republican primary, and
Derwinski lost.
   He served in the state legislature before being elected to
Congress, and in 1964 was state chairman of Barry Goldwater's
Republican presidential campaign.
   Rep. Bob Michel, R-Ill., said Derwinski was ``always voluably
anticommunist.'' Rep. Edward R. Madigan, R-Ill., said Derwinski, who
is of Polish ancestry, was active and popular with ethnic Republican
organizations.

<HEAD>Spain's Taste For American Food Boosts U.S. Imports</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Spain has turned into one of the American
farmer's richest overseas markets, but Agriculture Department trade
analysts say the character of those shipments are changing rapidly.
   For example, since the entry of Spain into the European Economic
Community in 1986, U.S. exports of wheat and feed grains have fallen
dramatically, says the department's Foreign Agricultural Service.
   But other kinds of products, including many high-value items,
have taken up much of the slack. In the fiscal year that ended Sept.
30, the total value of U.S. farm exports to Spain was $848 million,
up 30 percent from $652 million in 1986-87.
   An important factor is the thriving Spanish economy, which has
helped create new and expanded demand for processed or
semi-processed foods that carry higher price tags than the
traditional bulk commodities.
   Spain's gross national product, or the sum of its goods and
services, grew 5.5 percent in 1987, the highest in Europe, and is
expected to gain nearly that much in 1988, the agency said Thursday
in a report.
   ``However, at more than 19 percent, unemployment remains the
country's most compelling economic and social problem,'' the report
added.
   The surge last fiscal year put Spain among the world's top 10
markets for U.S. agricultural exports. Leading commodities included:
soybeans and soybean meal, corn and corn gluten feed, tallow, hides,
skins, walnuts, peas, beans, lentils, seeds, yellow grease, prunes
and poultry meat.
   Further, the report said, the United States supplied all of
Spain's imported almonds and half of its imported cattle semen.
   ``Increasing disposable income, a more urban and youthful
population and larger numbers of working women have resulted in
greater interest in convenience items, fast foods and more eating
outside the home,'' the report said. ``Patronage of restaurants
traditionally is high.''
   The report added: ``Although the standard three-hour business
lunch endures, consumption of fast foods and snacks is increasing.
Numerous tourists and the growing number of Spaniards who have
traveled abroad tend to encourage greater interest in new food
ideas.''
   As an EEC member, Spain's food processing industry has become a
prime takeover target for investment by many kinds of multinational
companies, and this shows little sign of subsiding, the report said.
   Meanwhile, Spain makes up an important part of the EEC's total
market for U.S. agricultural products. Last fiscal year, U.S.
shipments to the 12-nation trading bloc totaled $7.5 billion, with
Spain accounting for more than 11 percent.
   Japan was the second-largest market (and the biggest for a single
country), with $7.3 billion in 1987-88. Others in the top 10
included: South Korea, $2.3 billion; Canada, $2 billion; Soviet
Union, $1.9 billion; Mexico, $1.7 billion; Taiwan, $1.6 billion;
Egypt, $800 million; Iraq, $700 million; and China, $600 million.

   The Agriculture Department says the Soviet
Union and China have added 1.4 million metric tons of U.S. grain to
their 1989 granaries, including wheat sold to Beijing at subsidized
prices.
   Moscow's order announced Thursday was for an additional 1 million
metric tons of corn for delivery under a recently extended supply
agreement between the two countries. China bought 400,000 tons of
wheat under the subsidy program.
   The latest sales by private exporting companies brought total
corn sold to the Soviets to almost 8.03 million tons in the
agreement's sixth year, which began Oct. 1. Last year, U.S. corn
sales to the Soviet Union totaled slightly less than 5.2 million
tons.
   Exporters are required to report foreign grain sales of 100,000
tons or more to the USDA within 24 hours. Smaller sales are reported
weekly.
   A metric ton is about 2,205 pounds and is equal to 39.4 bushels
of corn or 36.7 bushels of wheat or soybeans. The 1 million tons of
corn would be about 39.4 million bushels.
   Corn prices have been averaging about $2.61 per bushel at the
farm level, according to USDA estimates, meaning that the latest
sale could have a farm value of around $103 million.
   Although no wheat has yet been sold for 1988-89 delivery under
the pact, the Soviets have ordered 500,000 tons of soybeans and
532,500 tons of soybean meal, plus 500,000 tons of grain sorghum.
   Melvin E. Sims, general sales manager for the department's
Foreign Agricultural Service, said seven export companies were
involved in the sale of 400,000 tons of wheat to China, some 14.7
million bushels having an estimated farm value of $58 million at
recent prices.
   The companies included: Cargill Inc., 90,000 tons; Central States
Enterprises, 40,000 tons; Nissho Iwai American Corp., 30,000 tons;
Bunge Corp., 40,000 tons; Tradigrain Inc., 50,000 tons; Tradecom
Inc., 30,000 tons; and Louis Dreyfus Corp., 120,000 tons.
   Sims said the sales were part of an authorized 1 million tons of
wheat announced on Dec. 7 under the Export Enhancement Program, or
EEP. With the latest sales, China now has 210,000 tons remaining
under the authorization.
   The program enables exporters to sell wheat and other designated
commodities to specified countries at reduced prices in order to
meet foreign competition. The exporters then collect free government
surpluses of grain or other products as bonuses, or subsidies.
   Sims said the bonuses due the seven exporters for the latest deal
averaged $23.10 per ton of wheat, or about 63 cents per bushel.

   A small Christmas tree sits
in Georgette Shatara's living room, but she says there will be no
turkey dinner this year, let alone the whole roast sheep that marked
holdays past.
   ``You see the tree?'' she asked. ``I did it for my youngest. He
begged and begged.''
   But Mrs. Shatara had to tell 8-year-old Khader, who sat nearby,
that this year Santa Claus will not visit the family's one-story
stone house in the town where the Bible says Jesus was born.
   One year after the Palestinian uprising against Israeli rule,
many Arab Christian families like the Shataras do not have the money
or the spirit for a traditional Christmas celebration.
   Shortened daily working hours and weekly general strikes have hit
the economy hard. Violence has taken the lives of 333 Palestinians
and 14 Israelis. More than 20,000 Arabs have been jailed since the
uprising started last December and at least 5,600 remain in custody.
   Leaders of the uprising have declared a general strike for
Saturday, on Christmas Eve, when Palestinian Christians used to
crowd into Manger Square with thousands of tourists to watch the
parade that led religious leaders to the Church of the Nativity.
   About 35,000 Palestinian Christians live in the West Bank and
Gaza Strip, occupied by Israel since the 1967 Middle East war. Most
are concentrated in Bethlehem, nearby Beit Jalah and Beit Sahur, and
Ramallah north of Jerusalem.
   The Shataras, Roman Catholics, used to celebrate Christmas by
going to midnight Mass, then having a Christmas dinner with as many
as 50 relatives. The traditional menu included turkey, a roast
sheep, stuffed zucchini and Arab sweets.
   This year, dinner will be for just Mrs. Shatara, her husband,
Issa, and their six children. It will be ``nothing special,'' she
said.
   The 38-year-old Mrs. Shatara says the reason for a quiet
Christmas is obvious: ``Lots have been killed, many others arrested.
There's no work, no money. There's no reason for Christmas.''
   She says her husband, 48, is a waiter in a restaurant in Arab
east Jerusalem and brings home only about 10 shekels ($6) a day
since there are few diners and few tips.
   Her oldest son, Joseph, 19, quit high school to try to supplement
the family income, but has found no steady work.
   ``For the first time, there's no money for clothes for the
children, for toys,'' she said.
   The ``intefadeh,'' Arabic for uprising, was also brought home to
the family 10 days ago when a 14-year-old cousin got caught up in a
stoning incident and was arrested by Israeli soldiers. Mrs. Shatara
said her nephew was held three days and complained he was beaten.
   She said the family would not go to midnight Mass both because of
the general strike and a lack of spirit.
   ``There's no joy in our house,'' she said.
   Others disagree with plans to drop Christmas rituals. Robert
Elian, another Bethlehem resident, complained that Christians were
becoming a beleaguered minority in the biblical city and should
celebrate to assert their presence.
   ``All year, we've had days of sorrow. We need a day to smile,''
he said when Bethlehem's Palestinian officials announced last month
that a traditional Christmas parade would be canceled and the town
Christmas tree would be without lights.
   Israeli authorities are going ahead with plans to hold the usual
ceremony on Christmas Eve in which the military administrators of
the West Bank greet church leaders in Manger Square, near the grotto
where Christ is said to have been born.
   Daniel Rossing, an Israeli expert on Christianity, explained at a
government briefing that Israel felt it was important to maintain
this arrangement that dates to when the Turkish and the British
ruled this region.
   ``You'll never convince me that this isn't important to the
churches,'' he said.
   Israel also plans a Christmas Eve concert in Manger Square,
featuring choirs from Spain, Switzerland and the Shiloh Baptist
Church of Washington, D.C.
   Asked her wish for Christmas, Mrs. Shatara replied, ``salaam'' _
peace in Arabic.
   ``I hope that on this birthday of the prince of peace there will
be peace for all of us,'' she said.

   Sulphur dioxide gas that leaked from an
acid plant in eastern Bihar state made 500 villagers ill, including
20 who were hospitalized today in serious condition, the United News
of India reported.
   The leak in Jhurkully village near Jamshedpur, about 620 miles
east of New Delhi, was so intense that crops near the plant were
also damaged, the news agency said. Cattle were also affected by the
leak, which occurred Thursday.
   The cause of the leak was not immediately known.
   Sulphur dioxide, a heavy, colorless, suffocating gas, is used as
bleach, disinfectant or as preservative.
   The victims, mostly women and children, complained of burning in
their eyes and throat and had breathing difficulties, the agency
said, quoting police.

   The U.S. dollar rose Friday against the Japanese yen
for the second consecutive day, while share prices closed lower on
the Tokyo Stock Exchange.
   The dollar opened higher at 124.90 yen and continued to edge up,
finishing the week's trading at 124.95 yen, up 0.33 yen from
Thursday's close. It had gained 0.40 yen on Thursday.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues, a 76.42-point
gainer the previous day, fell 88.35 points, or 0.30 percent, closing
at 29,686.26.

the weekend,'' the dealer said, speaking anonymously.
   But on Thursday, Bank of Japan Gov. Satoshi Sumita said the
foreign exchange market was stabilizing in the wake of the dollar's
recent sharp decline. He also said the central bank would continue
to monitor the market.
   Securities dealers attributed the bullish Tokyo stock market to
stable currency exchange rates and a wait-and-see mood ahead of the
New Year holiday period.
   ``Most foreign players seem to be out of town for the Christmas
break and as a result, the whole market is slowing down,'' said a
trader with a Tokyo securities company.
   Another dealer said investors were trading actively ahead of the
expected demise of the 87-year-old Emperor Hirohito, who has been
seriously ill for over three months.
   ``The market will very likely slow down when the emperor passes
away,'' said the dealer at Sanyo Securities Co., speaking on
condition of anonymity. ``But on the other hand, there is apparently
a huge amount of excess money in investors' hands, so many of them
feel it is time to invest.''
   Hirohito has been bedridden since Sept. 19 when he vomited blood
due to internal hemorrhaging. Share prices have tended to dip in
recent days in reaction to reports on his worsening health.

<HEAD>South Africa, Angola Vow Continued Support For Each Others' Rebels</HEAD>

   South Africa and Angola say they will
continue supporting rebels fighting each other's governments,
despite having signed a pact pledging not to interfere in each
other's domestic affairs.
   Foreign ministers of South Africa, Cuba, and Angola signed the
agreement Thursday granting independence to South-West Africa, which
will become the new nation of Namibia in 1991. It has been ruled by
South Africa since World War I.
   The pact also stated that 50,000 Cuban troops in Angola will
withdraw, under U.N. supervision.
   The signatories affirmed ``the principle of non-interference in
the internal affairs of states'' and promised not to allow their
territory to be used ``in connection with any acts of war,
aggression, or violence, against the territorial integrity,
inviolability of borders or independence of any state of
southwestern Africa.''
   Pretoria backs rebels fighting to overthrow Angola's Marxist
government, and Angola harbors bases of the African National
Congress, which is fighting South Africa's white-led government.
   Afonso van Dunem, Angola's foreign minister, told reporters ``the
ANC is carrying out a just fight in the name of all humanity against
apartheid, therefore the ANC will continue to receive the solidarity
and support from our government and our people.''
   He denied South Africa is part of ``southwestern Africa,'' saying
that region encompasses only Angola and Namibia.
   But he refused to say whether the ANC will be allowed to maintain
several bases in Angola.
   At a separate news conference, South Africa's foreign minister,
R.F. Botha, was asked if his country would suspend assistance to
Angolan rebels, known as UNITA.
   ``I would be telling you a lie if I say to you that we can
suddenly end our friendship with UNITA,'' he replied. ``We will
remain sympathetic to that organization. Friendship cannot be
terminated in this manner.''
   He promised, however, that South Africa would not violate the
accords, suggesting it will continue with political and diplomatic
support of the rebels but will not send weapons.
   Botha said if the ANC ``is allowed by Angola to continue to
operate as they've done up to now from Angolan territory ... to kill
members of the civilian population of South Africa, that would be a
clear-cut violation of the various agreements.''
   Chester A. Crocker, the U.S. assistant secretary of state who
mediated talks leading to the accords, told reporters Wednesday the
question of support for rebels was a matter between Angola and South
Africa.
   Crocker, Secretary of State George P. Shultz, U.N.
Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar and other diplomats
watched the signing of the accords Thursday.
   ``With the independence of Namibia, Africa's last colonial
question will have been resolved,'' Shultz said.
   The agreement calls for a one-year transition to independence for
Namibia, beginning April 1.
   Under the pact, half the 50,000 Cuban soldiers are to pull out by
Nov. 1, when Namibia is to hold its first free elections for a
national assembly. The rest must be gone by July 1, 1991.
   Foreign ministers Isidoro Malmierca of Cuba and van Dunem of
Angola then signed an agreement under which 70 U.N. peacekeepers
will monitor the Cuban withdrawal.
   A Security Council plan for Namibia's independence calls for
about 2,000 civilian administrators and military police to back
about 7,500 U.N. peacekeepers as South African troops withdraw and a
civilian government is organized.
   The South-West African People's Organization, which has fought
South African forces in Namibia more than 20 years, was not part of
the accords but said it will honor a cease-fire.
   Angolan guerrillas also were excluded.
   South Africa has controlled Namibia, a mineral-rich territory of
about 1.2 million people, since capturing it from Germany in World
War I. It refused to leave, despite U.N. opposition to its presence
there.

   Reflecting the climate of detente between
the United States and the Soviet Union, the United Nation's 43rd
General Assembly concluded its most harmonious session.
   The buoyant, sometimes tumultuous session that ended Thursday was
highlighted by President Reagan's farewell, Mikhail S. Gorbachev's
show-stopping debut and the assembly's decision for the first time
to leave New York and travel to Geneva to hear Yasser Arafat.
   The 12-week session adopted most resolutions by consensus
including, for the first time, the Afghanistan resolution
recognizing the Soviet troop withdrawal.
   It adopted the U.N. budget without a divisive note Wednesday _
the first time the financial plan was adopted without a vote since
the world body was founded 42 years ago.
   The 1990-91 budget of $1.76 billion was about $22 million less
than the last. Its adoption by consensus and the lower expenditure
were viewed as a U.S. victory.
   Dante Caputo, the General Assembly president and Argentina's
foreign minister, told the closing session the assembly had
benefited from the new international climate of detente and
cooperation between the United States and the Soviet Union and had
contributed to it.
   Caputo said the consensus within the 159-member assembly was
``unprecedented in the history of the organization.''
   The world body even charmed its most strident critic, the United
States, which committed itself during the session to repay nearly
$500 million owed to the U.N. budget and peacekeeping forces. The
money had been withheld for years for ideological, budgetary and
other reasons.
   Relations strained during most of the eight-year Reagan
administration eased considerably and when Reagan delivered his
final speech in September, he praised the world body for its
peacekeeping and peacemaking in Afghanistan, Iran and Iraq and
elsewhere.
   Before the session ended, the United Nations played host at the
signing of an agreement granting independence to South-West Africa,
better known as Namibia. It was signed Thursday by South Africa,
Angola and Cuba, which agreed to withdraw its 50,000 troops from
Angola.
   The assembly will reconvene in mid-January to discuss financial
questions and funding of a U.N. monitoring force in South-West
Africa.
   Gorbachev, the Soviet president, delivered a tour de force of
Soviet diplomacy at the assembly this month, promising unilaterally
to cut 500,000 Soviet troops and many jet fighters in Europe and
Asia.
   In December, the United States refused PLO Chairman Arafat a visa
to address the General Assembly.
   The PLO is an honored U.N. invitee and, in protest, the assembly
voted overwhelmingly to move to Geneva to hear Arafat.
   There, Arafat explicitly recognized Israel's right to exist,
renounced terrorism, and called for direct talks with Israel.
   The United States announced it would end a 13-year ban and open a
dialogue with the PLO, changing the entire Middle East landscape and
opening new possibilities for peace.

<HEAD>Judge: Cannot Deport Aliens For Espousing Anti-American Beliefs</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LINDA DEUTSCH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Alien supporters of a Marxist Palestinian
group may not be deported because even non-citizens have the First
Amendment right to espouse anti-American beliefs, a judge ruled in
gutting a McCarthy-era law.
   ``In this case, the government is trying to stifle certain ideas
from entering our society from certain aliens,'' U.S. District Judge
Stephen V. Wilson said.
   ``Our society, however, was built on the premise that only
through the free flow of ideas can our nation grow and prosper.''
   Wilson's ruling Thursday struck down four provisions of the 1952
McCarran-Walter Act that allowed the government to deport aliens who
advocated or were associated with groups espousing anti-American
ideologies including communism.
   He said the sections of the law passed during a time when Sen.
Joseph McCarthy, R-Wis., was whipping up Cold War fears against
communism were ``overbroad'' and could cause deportation for
something as simple as wearing a political button.
   ``Now I feel I can speak freely. I did not an hour ago,'' said
Khader Hamide, 34, one of the eight defendants the government had
sought to deport for allegedly supporting the Popular Front for the
Liberation of Palestine, a Marxist member of the Palestine
Liberation Organziation.
   In his ruling, Wilson also threw out an exception to a 1987 law
that recognized free speech rights in deportation proceedings for
all immigrants except members of the PLO.
   Wilson acknowledged world concern over terrorist threats but said
his decision would not interfere with Congress' ability to enforce
laws already in place to deal with terrorism.
   ``Our decision ... today will not significantly deplete the
government's arsenal in combating terrorism,'' said Wilson, whose
ruling applies only to central and southern California.
   Michael P. Lindemann, the Justice Department's lead attorney in
the case, said the ruling would be appealed. He declined further
comment.
   Paul Hoffman of the American Civil Liberties Union, which helped
in the defense, said the long-term effects of Wilson's ruling would
not be evident until all appeals are resolved.
   However, he predicted the case will be resolved by the U.S.
Supreme Court and could create a landmark precedent in First
Amendment law.
   The case involved seven Jordanians of Palestinian descent and a
Kenyan who were arrested two years ago, held without bail and
subjected to deportation proceedings under the 36-year-old law. An
immigration judge released them after prosecutors refused to present
their allegations in public, demanding a secret forum that was
refused.
   The government eventually dropped McCarran-Walter proceedings
against all but two, although it sought deportation of the others on
technical grounds.
   Wilson cited the landmark 1969 decision in Brandenburg vs. Ohio,
in which the Supreme Court held that the government can only
prohibit speech directed toward inciting imminent lawless action.
   The judge also ruled that the PLO exception to the 1987 Foreign
Relations Authorization Act violated guarantees of due process and
equal protection under the law.
   The Arab-American Anti-Discrimination committee sued the Justice
Department on behalf of the immigrants, joined by the ACLU and the
New York-based Center for Constitutional Rights,
   ``We feel as a community now we can speak our minds on the
Palestinian issue,'' said Hamide, 34. ``We can speak our minds on
the uprising on the West Bank and in Gaza and express our opinions
freely without the fear of being put in jail.''
   David Cole of the Center for Constitutional Rights said the
ruling on the PLO exception means that ``Congress cannot make
politically motivated distinctions in providing First Amendment
rights to aliens.''

<HEAD>Authorities: Arrest Breaches High-Tech Smuggling Ring In 10
Countries</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A high-tech smuggling ring involving dozens of
companies and 10 countries was left in disarray by the arrest of a
man charged with trying to sneak a computer to the Soviet bloc, the
U.S. Customs Service said.
   Eddy Gorandus Haak's arrest and the seizure of the $1.1 million
VAX computer last week culminated an eight-month investigation, said
Patrick O'Brien, special agent in charge of Customs in Miami.
   The Digital Equipment Corp. VAX 8800 mainframe computer seized at
Miami International Airport is capable of upgrading and controlling
systems that launch and guide ballistic missiles, operate radar or
run a mass transit system.
   It is on a federal list that regulates the exportation of
technologically advanced products and likely would have been used by
the Soviet defense system, O'Brien said.
   ``By getting one of these computers, they have saved themselves
10 years and hundreds of millions of dollars in research and
development,'' said Michael Sheehan, another Customs spokesman.
   ``These countries are walking from the Stone Age into the 21st
century in one step at the expense of the United States, and they're
using this technology for interests contrary to United States
interests.''
   O'Brien said the Soviet defense system began converting to VAX
computers earlier in the '80s.
   ``But they cannot build their own. The only way they can get it
is through the United States,'' O'Brien said. ``If we can deny them
from taking ours, they have to build the factories. It comes out of
their defense budget and really slows them down.''
   Customs officials said the investigation includes companies,
brokers and shippers in Boston, Chicago, New York, Newark, N.J.,
Houston, Grand Rapids, Mich.; and Bulgaria, Yugoslavia, Romania,
Hungary, Belgium, Austria, Libya, Iran and Iraq.
   At least one arrest was expected in Chicago and Boston, and
others were possible, Sheehan said.
   ``We need to determine whether these companies that transported
and modified the goods were involving knowingly,'' Sheehan said.
   ``The brokers are the people that we're after,'' O'Brien added.
``They are the people who are going to take it from legitimate
industry and give it to illegitimate industry.''
   There are other smuggling networks of similar scope, Sheehan said.
   Haak's network this year has purchased and diverted numerous VAX
computers, the system mostly highly sought by the Soviets, O'Brien
said. Those computer systems and others smuggled to Soviet countries
during the past few years are worth tens of millions of dollars, he
said.
   Agents arrested Haak on Dec. 14 after he paid $50,000 in Swiss
francs to undercover agents, O'Brien said. They had promised to help
Haak smuggle the computer to Bulgaria, the Soviet bloc's center for
computer technology, O'Brien said.
   Haak, 42, is a Dutch national who lives in Belsele, Belgium. A
grand jury returned a three-count indictment charging him with
conspiring to illegally export computer equipment from the United
States to Bulgaria.
   If convicted of all counts, Haak could receive a maximum sentence
of 35 years in prison and a $5.75 million fine.
   A federal magistrate on Thursday denied bond for Haak after
prosecutors said he would probably flee this country if allowed to
post bail.

   The Soviet Union and South Korea have

news agency Yonhap reported today.
   South Korean government officials declined, however, to comment

Seoul on Wednesday for talks on opening maritime links.
   Yonhap said Soviet officials also asked South Korea to permit
their ships to navigate via South Korean ports.

   The U.S. dollar rose against the Japanese yen for
the second consecutive day in Tokyo today, while share prices
declined in slow trading ahead of the year-end holiday period,
traders said.
   The dollar opened higher at 124.90 yen and edged up a bit more,
finishing the week's trading at 124.95 yen, up 0.33 yen from its
close on Thursday, when it gained 0.40 yen.
   ``The dollar's not really rising all that much because there's a
lack of buy orders. The market is really weak at this time of
year,'' said an exchange dealer with a major commercial bank,
speaking on condition of anonymity.
   The 225-isssue Nikkei Stock Average, which gained 76.42 points
the previous day, lost 88.35 points, or 0.30 percent, closing at
29,686.26.
   Volume in the first section was estimated at a light 600 million
shares, down from almost 734 million shares traded Thursday.
   ``Most foreign players seem to be out of town ... and as a
result, the whole market is slowing down,'' said a broker based with
a Tokyo securities company.
   Shipping stocks declined sharply following an announcement this
morning that Yamashita-Shinnihon Steamship Co. and Japan Line Ltd.
had agreed to merge next June to form one of the country's largest
shippers.
   In a statement, the two companies said the merger was necessary
to resolve an operational crisis caused by a slump in the shipping
sector brought on by the strong yen and the oil crises of the 1970s.
   The decline in shipping stocks also led to sell orders for steel,
non-ferrous metals, heavy electrials and auto shares, market reports
said.
   There are no foreign exchange dealings on Saturday, but the Tokyo
Stock Exchange will be open for a half-day session.

<DATELINE>MIAMI BEACH, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The owner of a yacht that once belonged
to Adolf Hitler wants to torpedo the boat and turn it into a habitat
for fish because he's fed up with the controversy surrounding it
after seven years.
   ``It looks like we're finally reaching the end of this ...
`Hitler-boat business' once and for all,'' said J.J. Nelson, who
also owns A-1 Marine and Commercial Wrecking in Jacksonville.
   Nelson came into possession of the 89-foot Ostwind boat in 1981
after it was abandoned on his property.
   Vice Mayor Abe Resnick, a Holocaust survivor, wants to sink the
50-year-old dilapidated boat to benefit marine life off Miami Beach
and mark next year's 50th anniversary of the Voyage of the Damned.
   ``We're gonna do whatever Resnick wants to do with this thing,''
Nelson said Thursday.
   ``We want to barge it to off of Miami Beach and apparently the
Jewish community will be happy to take it and watch it burn and
sink. I wish it good riddance myself.''
   Resnick is pushing for city financing to tow the boat out to sea
and sink it. But the city commission still must approve the money.
   ``We want to apply the same solution to the Ostwind that Hitler
was trying to apply to the Jews,'' said Resnick, a concentration
camp survivor who escaped and joined the Resistance.
   The sinking of the vessel would coincide with the anniversary of
the 1939 voyage in which the ship St. Louis left from Hamburg,
Germany, with 900 Jews aboard at the beginning of World War II. They
were refused entry into Cuba and the United States. Eventually, they
returned to Europe, where as many as 700 of them were believed to
have been killed by the Nazis.
   Nelson has unsuccessfully tried to sell the boat.
   ``These Nazis in Chicago want it, but they want to make a shrine
out of it. I would rather see it disposed of by the Jewish community
in Miami,'' Nelson said. ``My company can even blow it up or sink
it, if they want us to.''

<TEXT>
   Artist Salvador Dali was in stable
condition today after being rushed to a hospital suffering from
complications from a small intestinal lesion, doctors said.
   In a morning statement, a five-doctor team said the 84-year-old
artist was taken from his Galatea Tower mansion to Figueras Hospital
late Thursday after experiencing nausea and vomiting a small amount
of blood.
   The statement said an inspection of Dali's intestinal tract
showed a ``slight superficial lesion'' in the stomach lining.
   ``Dali's condition, despite this incident, is similar to that of
previous days, and a decision has been taken to keep him under
observation'' for 48 to 72 hours, the statement said.
   On Nov. 27, Dali was admitted for treatment of pneumonia in the
same hospital in Figueras, his hometown in northeastern Spain.
   The next day he was rushed by ambulance 60 miles to Barcelona's
Quiron Clinic in critical condition, suffering from a severe heart
problem aggravated by blood clots in his left lung.
   He was released Dec. 14.
   Dali, a founding member of the surrealist movement, is the last
of an outstanding generation of Spanish painters that included Pablo
Picasso, who died in 1973, and Joan Miro, who died a decade later.
   Dali has been in poor health and in a wheelchair since August
1984 when he suffered serious burns in a fire at his home.
   He was hospitalized for three months and since then has lived in
seclusion.
   In 1986, Dali underwent surgery to receive a heart pacemaker.

   The Yugoslavian ambassador to Spain died of
injuries suffered when his car veered off a highway east of this
capital and hit a highway bridge, the embassy said today. Redzai
Suroi was 59.
   Suroi died Thursday near Guadalajara as he returned alone to
Madrid from a private trip, said embassy counselor Zoran Raicevic.
   Suroi, a native of Erizren in the autonomous province of Kosovo,
had held the post of adjunct to the Yugoslav foreign minister before
coming to Spain in October 1985.
   He also served as ambassador to Mexico from 1978 to 1982 and to
Bolivia from 1970 to 1974, Raicevic said.
   Suroi, a law graduate of Belgrade University, worked as a
journalist for 15 years, and became director of Radio Pristina in
Kosovo before beginning his diplomatic career in 1970, Raicevic said.
   Survivors include his wife, a son and a daughter, the counselor
said.

   A year before Bess Myerson went on trial for
allegedly bribing a judge to fix her lover's divorce case, an old
friend said the former Miss America was ``thinking very positively
what it means to her life.''
   ``She is saying, `I'm going to create a new Bess Myerson,'''
Marilyn Funt told a reporter.
   If a new Bess Myerson exists, she was the smiling, composed,
seemingly confident woman who strode up the steps of the federal
courthouse each weekday for the past four months.
   But once she sat down inside she was forced to listen to tales of
the old Bess Myerson, a woman who was at the least ``eccentric'' _
her lawyer's term _ and possibly dominated by what the prosecutor
called ``greed and vengeance.''
   The issue for jurors was whether Miss Myerson tried to bribe
Judge Hortense Gabel, who was handling the divorce of Miss Myerson's
lover, Carl ``Andy'' Capasso.
   Miss Myerson, the former commissioner of the city Department of
Cultural Affairs, allegedly hired Mrs. Gabel's daughter, Sukhreet;
in return, it was charged, the judge reduced Capasso's support
payments.
   On Thursday evening, the federal jury acquitted Miss Myerson,
Mrs. Gabel and Capasso.
   Despite the verdict, the image of Bess Myerson _ the first Jewish
Miss America, a key political ally of Mayor Edward I. Koch, a
successful consumer advocate, a popular TV personality _ was
tarnished by her trial.
   Miss Myerson never took the stand to speak for herself. But
according to the testimony of others, she was cheap, secretive and
vindictive.
   She was described as a woman worth $7 million who kept her jewels
in a toolbox and once recycled a bouquet of flowers she'd received
by changing the card and having them delivered to Mrs. Gabel.
   A witness said she made numerous telephone calls on a private
line to the judge's chambers, often using aliases, including ``Helen
Goodman'' and ``Mrs. Robinson.''
   She didn't want daytime visitors at Capasso's beachfront estate
to know she had stayed overnight, so ``she would walk out the
kitchen door and come in the front door, as if she had just
arrived,'' according to the housekeeper.
   She invited Sukhreet Gabel to accompany her to a party, but
insisted she use her former husband's name _ Ms. Gabel was divorced
in 1980 _ instead of the maiden name she shares with her mother.
   One night in June 1986, Miss Myerson went to Ms. Gabel's
apartment house dressed in a gray sweatsuit, a headband and
lavender-tinted sunglasses. She refused to give her name to the
doorman.
   On a walk around the block, Miss Myerson allegedly told Ms. Gabel
``You could be dangerous,'' and warned her to ``keep your mouth
shut.''
   Witnesses recalled how she pointed out Capasso's estranged wife
on the street one day as ``an evil woman'' and celebrated with
Capasso after his payments were reduced.
   Moreover, expectations were low when the trial began, for Miss
Myerson had been arrested for shoplifting in Williamsport, Pa. She
looked old and disheveled in newspaper photographers, and was
reported to have been arrested earlier in London on a similar charge.
   But in the end, Miss Myerson's eccentricities paled to her
accuser's.
   Sukhreet Gabel, a plump, chatty, often fatuous woman who enjoyed
the attention as much as Miss Myerson disdained it, said
electroshock therapy for depression had left her memory ``like Swiss
cheese,'' and parlayed her status as the prosecution's key witness
into at least a fleeting celebrity.

   Cheers broke out and former Miss America Bess
Myerson sobbed and kissed her co-defendant lover after their
soap-opera-like divorce-fixing trial ended in acquittals.
   ``It's over,'' Miss Myerson said after her two-year ordeal ended
with Thursday night's verdict. ``I'm grateful for the American
judicial system and I thank the jury for exonerating me.''
   The U.S. District Court jury also cleared Miss Myerson's lover,
Carl ``Andy'' Capasso, 43, and retired state Supreme Court Justice
Hortense Gabel, 76, who handled Capasso's divorce.
   Miss Myerson, seated beside Capasso, kissed and hugged him after
jury forewoman Linda Berardi announced ``not guilty'' for each
charge in the six-count indictment.
   Several people cheered, while key government witness Sukhreet
Gabel _ daughter of Miss Myerson's co-defendant _ sat dazed several
rows behind her.
   After the jury's final announcement, Miss Myerson wiped away
tears and crossed the courtroom to hug Ms. Gabel's frail mother. She
then broke down and cried into her hands as Capasso massaged her
back and neck.
   Miss Myerson, 64, who was Miss America in 1945, had stared
intently at the jury as they entered the courtroom shortly after 8
p.m. and delivered their verdict, rejecting the prosecution's
contention thatthe three were guilty of conspiracy, mail fraud and
bribe-related charges.
   The jury had been sequestered by Judge John Keenan since Monday,
when they began weighing the evidence from the 12-week trial.
   ``I really feel that given the prosecution's case, I had no other
choice but to say not guilty,'' said the forewoman.
   Jay Goldberg, Capasso's lawyer, said, ``Had it not been Bess
Myerson, (U.S. Attorney Rudolph) Giuliani would have never brought
this case.''
   But Giuliani, whose office has rarely lost a major case,
disagreed.
   ``I think we would try this case again, sure,'' said Giuliani.
``Obviously, we're disappointed with the result.''
   Miss Myerson, the city's former cultural affairs commissioner,
was accused of trying to bribe Mrs. Gabel by giving a city job to
Sukhreet, the judge's emotionally troubled daughter. In return,
prosecutors said, the judge reduced Capasso's alimony payments with
his ex-wife, Nancy.
   Capasso, a millionaire contractor, is serving a three-year
sentence in the Lewisburg, Pa., prison for pleading guilty to
federal tax evasion charges in January.
   Before he was taken back into custody by marshals, he offered a
one-word opinion: ``Outstanding.''
   Much of the trial's focus was on Ms. Gabel, who spent nine days
on the stand testifying against her mother and reveled in the
subsequent attention and publicity.
   ``Everybody's a winner. The truth came out,'' said Ms. Gabel.
   Ms. Gabel testified how Miss Myerson began cultivating her
friendship in the summer of 1983; how her mother looked ``very sad''
when she asked about her involvement in the Capasso divorce case;
and how Miss Myerson confronted her in June 1986 during the grand
jury investigation, telling her ``you could be dangerous ... keep
your mouth shut.''
   Ms. Gabel said she was ``happy for Bess and Andy,'' a sentiment
shared by another prosecution witness _ Mayor Edward I. Koch.
   The mayor, whose once close relationship with Miss Myerson
unraveled amid the corruption charges, said simply, ``I'm glad for
her as a personal friend.''
   Koch, who benefited from Miss Myerson's friendship and celebrity
when he was an unknown congressman running for mayor in 1977, was
uncharacteristically subdued and barely looked at Miss Myerson as he
testified.
   The trial, which began Oct. 4, captured the public's imagination
with its tales of high jinks and low comedy among New York's movers
and shakers.
   While prosecutors alleged Miss Myerson tried to ``buy justice in
the courts of New York,'' her lawyers ridiculed the case as ``a soap
opera, not a criminal trial.''

   It began as the Bess Mess, but at times it seemed
to have turned into the Sukhreet Circus. Even as the trial of Bess
Myerson was threatening to destroy the career of one celebrity, it
was creating another.
   She was Sukhreet Gabel, daughter of the judge whom Miss Myerson
allegedly tried to influence.
   Throughout the trial, her antics _ which included singing in a
cabaret and having a facial makeover on television _ amused, enraged
and generally fascinated New Yorkers.
   No one seemed quite certain what to make of this bubbly, rotund
woman who spoke candidly of undergoing electroshock therapy for
depression, who spoke of her love for her mother as she testified
against her, and who giggled as she discussed obscene telephone
calls to her home.
   ``I've been portrayed as mad by more people than I can count,''
Ms. Gabel said. ``And I've gone public to say to people, `Well, see
how mad you think I am.'''
   Ms. Gabel, 39, went public in a big way. She spent nine days on
the witness stand testifying as the prosecution's star witness
against her mother, former state Supreme Court Justice Hortense
Gabel, and Miss Myerson, the 1945 Miss America and the city's former
cultural affairs commissioner.
   Ms. Gabel allegedly was hired by Ms. Myerson for a $19,000-a-year
city job in order to influence Mrs. Gabel. The 75-year-old judge was
handling the divorce case of Ms. Myerson's lover, Carl ``Andy''
Capasso.
   A federal jury Thursday evening acquitted the three of all
charges.
   Ms. Gabel stood beside her mother after the verdict, gently
rubbing the ex-judge's shoulder while congratulating her.
   While Mrs. Gabel told reporters her daughter had simply told the
truth and supported her, U.S. Attorney Rudolph Giuliani admitted the
government might have been better off with a more stable witness
than the flighty Sukhreet.
   ``In many, many cases we bring, there are witnesses with a whole
history of problems,'' said Giuliani. ``You don't have the chance to
pick your witnesses.''
   The scene between the Gabels after the verdict came as no
surprise to those who watched Mrs. Gabel warmly greeting her
daughter each day as the younger woman arrived to testify against
her.
   ``My mother and I have truly never gotten along better,'' said
Ms. Gabel.
   She insisted her testimony contained ``no smoking gun'' that
proved her mother's guilt, nor any clear evidence that would
exonerate her.
   But, she added: ``Based on what I know of my mother ...
corruption and the selling of office is about the farthest thing I
can think of from her modus operandi.''
   Ms. Gabel's own modus operandi has included a wide streak of
zaniness, best exemplified by her cabaret performance at a recent
birthday party for Village Voice columnist Michael Musto. Among the
songs she sang: ``Let the Punishment Fit the Crime.''
   She also appeared on a television talk show, ``People are
Talking,'' to receive new makeup, hairstyle and clothes selected by
a fashion consultant.
   Ms. Gabel _ who changed her name from Julie Bess to an Indian
word for `happiness'' _ clearly has enjoyed her celebrity.
   Her next step?
   ``I guess I'll breathe a sigh of relief and look for a job,'' she
said after the verdict.
   She is thinking of writing a book, and has toyed with the idea of
a career in ``news and entertainment'' _ two fields she knows
intimately by now.

   Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze has
arrived in the North Korean capital of Pyongyang, last leg of a
three-nation tour that included visits to Tokyo and Manila, the
state news agency reported today.
   North Korean Foreign Minister Kim Yong Nam and other top
government officials greeted Shevardnadze on his arrival Thursday
night from Manila, said the North Korean Central News Agency,
monitored in Tokyo.
   The official news agency said Shevardnadze came on a ``working
visit'' as a guest of the state but provided no details on his
agenda. Japanese government officials said he was scheduled to leave
Saturday for Moscow.
   Before his departure for Manila from Tokyo on Wednesday,
Shevardnadze said his visit to Pyongyang was intended to reaffirm
traditional ties of friendship between the two Communist nations.

<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi of India ended a visit
to China today with the two nations expressing a common desire to
improve ties after nearly three decades of strained relations.
   Gandhi, accompanied by his wife, Sonia, departed for home from
Shanghai after his five-day visit, the first by an Indian head of
government since his grandfather, Jawaharlal Nehru, visited in 1954.
   Both sides said the visit ushered in a new era of good will
between the world's most populous nations. Gandhi said his trip
marked a ``new beginning'' for the two countries.
   During the visit, the countries agreed to set up a joint working
group to take up their most divisive issue, a territorial dispute
that broke out into a short border war in 1962.
   ``The leaders of the two countries held earnest, in-depth
discussions on the India-China boundary question and agreed to
settle this question through peaceful and friendly consultations,''
a joint communique said.
   It added, ``They also agreed to develop their relations actively
in other fields and work hard to create a favorable climate and
conditions for a fair and reasonable settlement of the boundary
question.''
   It said Gandhi's talks with Chinese Premier Li Peng were held
``in an atmosphere of friendship, candidness and mutual
understanding.'' Gandhi also met with senior leader Deng Xiaoping,
Communist Party head Zhao Ziyang and President Yang Shangkun.
   The border issue, Gandhi said, is ``very complicated'' and a
quick solution is unlikely.
   China claims 36,000 square miles of mountainous frontier in what
New Delhi says is northeast India's Arunachal Pradesh province.
India says China illegally occupies 14,500 square miles on its
western border.
   The communique said China ``expressed concern over anti-China
activities by some Tibetan elements in India,'' and that the Indian
side repeated its policy of recognizing Tibet as a part of China and
banning Tibetans from carrying out anti-Chinese political activities
on Indian soil.
   India has been the home of Tibet's religious leader, the Dalai
Lama, and thousands of his followers who fled Tibet after an
abortive anti-Chinese uprising in 1959. China blames supporters of
the Dalai Lama for pro-independence activities that have led to
violent clashes with police the past 14 months.
   Gandhi on Thursday presided over the signing of three bilateral
agreements _a civil aviation accord calling for direct flights
between New Delhi and Beijing, a three-year cultural agreement and a
science and technology agreement.
   The communique said Premier Li accepted an invitation to visit
India, but no date was set.
   China, grappling with economic problems at home, has made a
commitment to improving relations with its neighbors.
   Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev is expected to visit China
next year, becoming the first Soviet leader to do so in 30 years.
   China will likely normalize relations with the Soviet Union
during the visit. The two countries fought a border war in 1969.

<HEAD>Police Focus Investigation Of U.S. Teacher's Murder On
Acquaintances</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Police said today their investigation
into the brutal slaying of a 26-year-old American teacher is
focusing on friends and students who knew her.
   Investigators said they have questioned more than 25 teachers and
students who were acquaintances and friends of Carolyn Joyce Abel,
the Lafayette, Ind., woman found stabbed to death Tuesday.
   The Korea Herald today quoted an unidentified investigator at the
Kangnam Police Station as saying,``We suspect the murder was a crime
of passion or a personal grudge in view of its savagery.''
   Violent crime is relatively uncommon in South Korea and personal
attacks on foreigners are unusual.
   Ms. Abel was found dead in her apartment of multiple stab wounds,
including a slashed throat.
   The Herald quoted police as saying investigators believe the
attacker cut her throat after inflicting the other wounds.
   ``It seems that the attacker cut her throat to make sure she was
dead because he feared her possible survival,'' police were quoted
as saying. ``It leads us to suppose the victim knew her attacker
well.''
   Police said they questioned several Korean students who had
frequented Ms. Abel's apartment, as well as two other teachers and
three Korean male students who took a trip to a resort area with the
victim last weekend.
   The autopsy showed the victim was not sexually abused and police
said they found some valuables in the apartment, which led them to
believe robbery was not a motive.
   Ms. Abel came to Seoul in October and was one of about 25
English-language teachers at a private school, the English Language
Services. The school said she had worked in Japan before coming to
South Korea.

<HEAD>Majority Of Israelis Favor Negotiations With PLO</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Fifty-four percent of Israelis favor
negotiations with the PLO, while 44 percent oppose such talks under
any circumstances, according to a poll published today.
   The findings contrast with the policy of the new coalition
government, which flatly rules out talks with the Palestine
Liberation Organization. Israel says the PLO is a terrorist
organization.
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir of the right-wing Likud bloc said
in presenting the government Thursday that he invited the
left-leaning Labor Party to share power because Israel needed to
present a united front against the PLO.
   The poll was conducted Tuesday and Wednesday by the Dahaf
Institute, which interviewed 653 Israeli Jews. The results were
published in the Yediot Ahronot newspaper.
   People were asked: ``Based on (PLO chief) Yasser Arafat's
statement in Geneva, and on condition that he renounces terror, are
you for or against negotiations with the PLO?''
   Twenty-one percent said they definitely backed talks, while 33
percent said they favored negotiations.
   But 24 percent said they were definitely against talks, while 20
percent simply said they opposed negotiations. Two percent were
undecided.
   The margin of error was plus or minus 2.5 percent, the institute
said.
   Dahaf pollster Mina Zemach said the 54 percent approval rate was
the highest measured by her institute.
   Similar surveys in the last two years found a support rate
ranging from 48 percent to 52 percent, while the number of those
rejecting talks fluctuated between 44 percent and 47 percent, she
said.
   In October, one month before the Israeli election, 50 percent
approved talks, while 47 percent objected and 3 percent had no
opinion, Ms. Zemach said.

<HEAD>Christmas Greetings From Anderson's Sister, Former Captives</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lebanese newspapers today published a
Christmas letter to American journalist Terry Anderson and his
captors from the hostage's sister, Peggy Say.
   ``Please give Terry our message of love and concern during this
Christmas season. Tell him that thousands pray every day for the
hostages, their captors and the people of Lebanon,'' said the letter
published in English and Arabic by Lebanon's prestigious daily
An-Nahar.
   Seven other dailies published the Arabic translation of the
letter.
   ``We published the English text as well to give Terry a chance to
read what is addressed to him,'' said an An-Nahar editor who spoke
on condition of anonymity.
   Anderson, 41, of Lorain, Ohio, chief Middle East Correspondent
for The Associated Press, is the longest-held of the 15 foreign
captives in Lebanon. He was kidnapped in Moslem west Beirut on March
16, 1985.
   ``Traditionally this is a season of hope, peace and forgiveness,
but there is little hope in my heart that I will see Terry and other
hostages released during these Christmas holidays,'' the letter said.
   ``It is difficult to sustain hope after almost four years of
working and praying for freedom for Terry and the other hostages.
Some days it seems we have made no progress and are farther from our
goal as ever.
   ``We hear mixed messages from the Middle East and we have no
clear guidelines about what we should do or could do on behalf of
these innocent men,'' Mrs Say wrote.
   Addressing the kidnappers, the letter said: ``Only you, their
captors, can end this stalemate. I pray for you to have the courage
to bring this to a peaceful conclusion for humanitarian reasons.''
   Mrs. Say concluded her letter by saying: ``We have all suffered
enough.
   Please.
   May God be with you and peace be yours.''
   On Thursday, relatives and friends made radio appeals to
kidnappers holding Anderson and the eight other American hostages to
release them in time for Christmas.
   The Christian-controlled Voice of Lebanon radio broadcast the
appeals, which included messages from former U.S. hostages Lawrence
Jenco and David Jacobsen.
   Jacobsen and Jenco were held by Islamic Jihad, the same
fundamentalist Shiite Moslem faction holding Anderson and American
educator Thomas Sutherland, who was kidnapped June 9, 1985.
   In a message from Sacramento, Calif., Jacobsen addressed Haj, the
name by which the former American hostages knew their jailer.
   Jacobsen, freed Nov. 2, 1986, after being held 1{ years, told
Haj: ``You have it within your power to take the first step toward
justice and a better world for the Shiite Moslems. You told me
personally that you believe in peace and justice.
   ``Now you have a wonderful opportunity to demonstrate your words
of understanding and compassion. Release the hostages unilaterally
and without conditions.
   ``Haj, you must have trust in the goodness of the American
people, it is worth a try.''
   Jenco, a Catholic priest who was freed July 27, 1986, by Islamic
Jihad after 18 months in captivity, told Anderson and Sutherland:
   ``In 1985 we sadly celebrated midnight Mass together. A young
guard brought a beautiful cake with the words `Happy Birthday Jesus
Christ.' It seems like yesterday.
   ``This Christmas, I am free to celebrate a free Christmas with my
loved ones and yet I'm not free for knowing that you both are in
prison for your fourth Christmas. May this Christmas be the day of
your freedom.''

<HEAD>Salvadoran Court Voids Extradition Request For Suspect In Bishop's
Murder</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former army captain accused in
the 1980 slaying of a Roman Catholic archbishop and being held in
Miami on other charges will not face extradition to El Salvador, the
Supreme Court ruled.
   The court Thursday struck down a request for the United States to
extradite Alvaro Saravia because it said there wasn't enough
evidence linking him to the murder of Archbishop Oscar Arnulfo
Romero.
   The court also said Attorney General Giron Flores did not have
the constitutional power to ask the United States to send Saravia
back to El Salvador.
   Flores had directly asked the United States for Saravia's
extradition. The case went to the Supreme Court after Saravia's
attorney requested a hearing.
   Saravia has been jailed in Miami since November 1987, when he was
arrested for a traffic violation and authorities found he had been
in the country illegally since 1985.
   It was not clear if Thursday's ruling could result in Saravia's
release. The Salvadoran court said Saravia would not be subject to
arrest if he were sent home.
   President Jose Napoleon Duarte's government accused Saravia of
arranging Romero's assassination on orders of right-wing legislator
Roberto d'Aubuisson, who denied the allegation.
   Romero, an outspoken critic of right-wing death squads, was shot
by a sniper while saying Mass in San Salvador on March 24, 1980.
   The government's accusations were based on the testimony of
Amadeo Garay Reyes, who allegedly drove the sniper to the church.
   The Supreme Court said Garay's testimony was not credible, partly
because he waited more than seven years to come forward with his
story.

   Syracuse, N.Y., turned off Christmas lights in memory of 35
students as Americans nationwide grieved for the Pan Am jet crash
victims, including a cabin attendant who'd planned to retire after
Flight 103 landed.
   The Boeing 747 crashed into a Scottish hamlet Wednesday night,
killing all 258 on board. The dead included a top U.S. government
Nazi hunter, a New York investment bank director, and students,
military personnel and others coming home for the Christmas holidays.
   Many expressed shock and anger at reports that terrorism may have
been involved and that U.S. officials kept quiet about warnings it
received two weeks ago that a terrorist attack on a Pan Am flight
was planned.
   ``We had no knowledge of any terrorist threats and now we feel
like this could have been prevented,'' said Bill Brunner, whose
20-year-old sister, Colleen, an Oswego (N.Y.) State College junior,
was killed.
   ``The anger doesn't surpass the feeling of Colleen being gone,''
Brunner added, ``but I'd certainly like to get a hold of the
terrorists.''
   ``It's unforgivable,'' Lucas Lowenstein, a 19-year-old Syracuse
University sophomore who lost his 21-year-old brother and classmate,
Alexander, said from his parents' Mendham Township, N.J., home.
``Had any of that information gotten back to my father, my brother
would never have taken a Pan Am flight.''
   Those who for one reason or another had not boarded Flight 103
from London to New York expressed relief. Among the lucky ones was
The Four Tops singing group, which was delayed by a British
Broadcasting Co. TV taping.
   Lead singer Levi Stubbs, who landed in Detroit on Thursday with
his three colleagues, said the group had just finished the TV show
and arrived at their hotel when he called his wife to tell her he'd
missed Flight 103.
   ``And she was crying and carrying on, and I asked, `What's the
matter?' And she told me what happened.''
   One of the places hardest hit by the tragedy was Syracuse
University, where 35 of the dead were enrolled in an international
studies program.
   Mayor Tom Young ordered the city's Christmas lights turned off
Thursday night and asked residents to do likewise. New York Gov.
Mario Cuomo ordered flags flown at half-staff through Saturday.
   Two memorial services were held Thursday at Hendricks Memorial
Chapel. Many participants had red, puffy eyes, and nearly all hugged
each other afterward.
   ``When one person dies we are all diminished. It is like when a
finger is severed, the whole body hurts,'' the Rev. Pauli
Kowalewski, the school's Protestant chaplain, told about 400 people
attending one service. ``You can be consoled because Christ is
crying with us. Christ grieves, too.''
   ``It's so sad. You can't help but get pulled in,'' said Noelle
Ellert, a freshman from Cedar Grove, N.J. ``I don't know how
Christmas is going to be normal this year.''
   The university tried to take a business-as-usual approach and
finish the final two days of examinations before recessing for a
three-week holiday break. University Chancellor Melvin Eggers
instructed faculty members to give final exams to distraught
students only if they were prepared to take them.
   Study program victims included 19-year-old twins Jason and Eric
Coker of Mendham Township, N.J. Jason was majoring in liberal arts
and communications at Syracuse; his brother was studying economics
the University of Rochester, N.Y., officials said. Both played
soccer and ran track.
   Another student victim was Robert Schlageter, 20, of Warwick,
R.I., whose postcard to his girlfriend arrived at her home the day
he died.
   ``I haven't seen it yet,'' said Marion Menzies, 20, a University
of Rhode Island junior. She said her mother told her about the
postcard while she mourned Thursday with the Robert's parents.
   At the Justice Department in Washington, flags were ordered flown
at half-staff in memory of Michael Bernstein, an attorney with the
agency's Office of Special Investigations.
   Bernstein, a 36-year-old father of two, had been in Austria
negotiating a treaty to allow some former Nazis in the United States
to be deported there.
   Also killed was Mark A. Rein, a 44-year-old treasurer and
director of the Salomon Bros. investment bank and father of two.
Today would have been his 15th wedding anniversary, his widow,
Denice, said from their New York City home.
   ``Thank God I have my kids and family,'' she said.
   In Millbrae, Calif., friends gathered at the home of the parents
of flight attendant Paul Garrett, 41, who had planned to open a
boutique with his wife in Paris after 15 years with the airline.
   ``The terrible tragedy is that this was going to be his last
flight,'' said Jan MacMichael, a friend who acted as a spokeswoman
for the mourners.

   The holiday spirit isn't lost on Southern
California's filthy rich who've decked the Rolls with boughs of
holly and set out on an annual quest for the perfect gift that is
opulent, unusual and expensive.
   The posh shops on Rodeo Drive this season offer entertainment's
aristocracy the usual collection of magnificent gems, crystal and
oddball dust catchers, such as the $4,000 Scrabble word game at
Carrol & Co.
   Alfalfa-sprouting Chia Pets and the as-seen-on-TV Clapper power
switches _ hot items elsewhere in the country _ won't be under the
Yule trees of the Beverly Hills, Bel-Air or Malibu gentry.
   Living up to the region's car-crazy image, shoppers are buying up
facsimile and answering machines to hook to cellular telephones.
Also hot at Beverly Hills Motoring Accessories: see-through hood
covers to prevent road nicks.
   The perfect gift for high rollers is the new two-door Rolls-Royce
Silver Spirit for $254,500 featured at Gregg Motors in Beverly
Hills. For a brief moment in the fast lane, though, a Budget
Rent-a-Car's luxury outlet down the street will rent a Rolls,
Mercedes-Benz or Ferrari for about $500 a day.
   Gearys in Beverly Hills sells the popular $16 Christmas wreath
for Rolls-Royce grills and limousine-traveling shoppers have shown a
fondness for $20 miniature poinsettias available locally to decorate
the interior.
   Lila Greene of Renta Yenta, a San Fernando Valley specialty
service, has fulfilled a variety of unusual gift wishes this year.
The well-to-do parents of one youngster hired a trapeze act that,
for $5,000, features a man walking a high wire while playing an oboe.
   Ms. Greene has created several winter wonderlands by dusting a
back yard with snow for $1,200, provided Santa and Mrs. Claus for
$325 an hour and decorated trees at $100 each for her bi-coastal
clientele.
   But pricey real estate is the Christmas granddaddy gift for
Southern California's affluent.
   A giant red bow wraps around Zsa Zsa Gabor's estate in Bel-Air,
just around the corner from President Reagan's new digs. ``We are
giving it away for $15 million,'' real estate broker Mike Silverman
said of the Gabor house.
   The president and Mrs. Reagan will spend the Christmas holidays
in the Bel-Air house, their first stay at the residence that will
become their main post-White House homestead.
   For those who want to rub elbows with the likes of Sylvester
Stallone and Carroll O'Connor, Malibu broker Paul Gresante of Jon
Douglas Real Estate has a $4.2 million ocean cottage on Broad Beach
Road.
   Another holiday special is the ocean bluff residence Sea
Pavilions, an $11.5 million estate featuring ``a symphony of exotic
woods and French limestone,'' boasts Gresante. It also has a spa
that seats 25.
   But presents for many well-heeled recipients will be measured by
horsepower rather than square footage.
   At least one widely known Hollywood personality will be getting a
custom Harley-Davidson motorcycle. His name wasn't divulged because
the gift is a surprise.
   ``Every year I stick one or two in someone's home under the
tree,'' said bike builder Gene Thomson of Bartels' Harley-Davidson.
Regular Bartels customers include Stallone, Billy Idol and Mickey
Rourke. Another is actor Gary Busey, who is recovering from serious
head injuries suffered in a Dec. 4 motorcycle accident.
   The Christmas morning deliveries are memorable, he said.
   ``The houses are so big I could have driven through their living
rooms at 50 mph. You should see the steps I have to go up. I almost
hit a sofa last year,'' said Thomson, who has a $28,000 Harley in
the Neiman-Marcus catalogue.
   Unwrapping gifts culminates a Hollywood holiday season ritual of
lavish parties, many of them presided over by Brady White, the show
business Santa to the Stars.
   ``Zsa Zsa asked for a happy marriage and I told her, `I can't
perform miracles,''' said White. ``Then, Sylvester Stallone asked
for the same thing and I told him, ``It will be a rocky road.'''

<HEAD>Reports Say Relief Supplies Still Jammed By Clogged Railways</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Hundreds of train cars are hauling relief supplies
into Soviet Armenia daily, but railway tieups are slowing urgently
needed shipments from arriving in the earthquake-devastated region,
news reports said.
   Children traumatized by the Dec. 7 quake need psychological
counseling and thousands of victims who lost limbs need prosthetics,
the reports continued.
   Officials meanwhile began planning the reconstruction of cities,
even though one report said the leveled town of Spitak was going to
be rebuilt only a half-mile from a fault line.
   A commission of the ruling Politburo ordered all possible
transport mobilized to ship trailers to the disaster area for use as
medical stations, the official Soviet news agency Tass reported
Thursday.
   The panel found rail services in particular are ``a bottleneck
slowing measures to overcome the effects of the natural calamity,''
Tass said.
   New reports said Soviet authorities had evacuated 92,000 people
from northern Armenia, a mountainous republic bordered by Turkey.
The temblor that registered 6.9 on the Richter scale killed an
estimated 55,000 people and left 500,000 homeless.
   Tass increased the official count of ``ruined'' villages to 300,
and said 58 of them were obliterated by the quake. It also said
about 10 percent of the livestock in the rural areas died.
   Freight traffic to Armenia is increasing daily as building
materials join the relief supplies pouring into the tiny republic.
But hauling cargo from the Armenian capital Yerevan to the city of
Leninakan and other stricken areas is still a problem, Tass said.
   Rail service near the disaster area is erratic; unloading of
freight cars is quickening, but still is not fast enough, even at
1,633 cars a day, it said, estimating at least 2,000 cars must pass
through daily to fill needs.
   Armenian children, meanwhile, took up their books again in 23
temporary schools in the Crimea, hundreds of miles from their ruined
homes, Tass reported.
   Psychologists are working with victims to ease the pain of their
experience, and warned that children especially could suffer for
years to come, according to the newspaper Trud. Experts suggested it
will take 15 years to psychologically rehabilitate a generation of
Armenian children, the paper said.
   Physical rehabilitation is also looming as a massive undertaking.
Thousands of people need artificial limbs and many others were
paralyzed when they were crushed under tons of concrete, according
to Richard Schubert, president of the American Red Cross, quoted by
the Novosti news service.
   Meanwhile, an article in Trud on plans for reconstruction of the
destroyed city of Spitak raised as many questions as it answered.
   ``As shown by recent events, it sits on the intersection of two
breaks in the earth's crust. Therefore, the city practically must be
built on a new square, 500 to 600 meters (yards) from the current
one.''
   Without explaining how a move of a half-mile could make much
difference in an earthquake like that of Dec. 7, which destroyed
virtually every building in the city of 25,000, the newspaper said
Spitak and Leninakan will be placed in fields less susceptible to
earthquake, on hard rock foundations.

<HEAD>Governor Blocks James Earl Ray Parole Hearing</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By D.A. ELLIOTT</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A decision by Gov. Ned McWherter that
blocks early parole reviews for some criminals will prevent such a
hearing for the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.'s assassin for 10 years.
   The governor drew praise from a black political group's leader by
amending a 1985 gubernatorial directive that calls for reviews of
inmates for possible early release to relieve prison overcrowding.
   ``It shows he has concern for all people regardless of race,''
said James M. Brown, chairman of the Tennessee Voters Council. ``It
took guts to do it.''
   The McWherter amendment, outlined in a letter Thursday to Parole
Board Chairman Charles Traughber, excludes inmates from such an
early review if they have been convicted of escape, attempt to
escape or assault or homicide of an inmate or prison official.
   McWherter's decision would not affect assassin James Earl Ray's
original parole eligibility date in 1998 but removes him from
consideration for an early release because of his escape record,
said David Welles, the governor's legal counsel.
   Ray was a fugitive from a Missouri prison when he killed the
civil rights leader in Memphis on April 4, 1968. He is serving a
99-year term at Brushy Mountain State Prison, from which he escaped
in June 1977.
   ``It's not just directed at Mr. Ray's situation. This affects the
certain inmates that may be up for early release because of
overcrowding,'' Welles said.
   Welles said the decision would keep about 100 inmates in jail.
   Ray, now 60, pleaded guilty to first-degree murder in the
assassination on March 9, 1969, but retracted his story three days
later and has continued to claim his innocence.
   A 1985 directive designed to reduce prison overcrowding made Ray
eligible for a parole hearing in November but was criticized by
black leaders, including Brown.
   Brown wrote McWherter, requesting that the hearing be prevented.
   ``I asked him to do it before Christmas and make it a present to
all of us. We didn't want a hearing at all,'' Brown said.
   Jim Kennedy, McWherter's chief of staff, said the order was
effective immediately for Ray, who has been turned down for early
parole at least twice.

<TEXT>
   The House of Commons is headed toward a final vote
on the free trade agreement with the United States that is scheduled
to take effect New Year's Day.
   ``The U.S.-Canada free trade agreement is going to be put before
Parliament for a final decision before Christmas and it is going to
be put in place by Jan. 1,'' Trade Minister John Crosbie said
Thursday.
   Crosbie made the comment as he opened debate in Ottawa on the
third and final reading for the trade agreement's enabling
legislation.
   Prime Minister Brian Mulroney's Progressive Conservative Party
won a second consecutive majority government in Nov. 21 elections,
clearing the way for the trade agreement he signed with President
Reagan in January.
   The party has been using its majority in the House of Commons to
speed through the passage, but even the most drastic limits would
require deputies to stay at work until about 1 a.m. Saturday,
Christmas Day.
   Some evidently homesick members sang Christmas carols during
debate that carried past midnight Wednesday.
   A delay of days, weeks or probably even several months would not
hinder the agreement, which will phase out all remaining tariffs
between the two countries over a 10-year period.
   But supporters of the agreement say it would be embarrassing for
Canada to have to ask the United States to postpone the start of
such a major undertaking.
   The approval in the House of Commons then would allow the Senate
to complete its work next week. The Senate, which is appointed, has
promised not to oppose the trade legislation.
   The United States completed all its legislation for the agreement
in September, but it was delayed in Canada by intense opposition
that forced Mulroney to call the election last fall.
   The opposition still wants Mulroney to clarify such issues as how
much government help will be available for workers who lose their
jobs as a result of plant closings linked to the trade agreement.
   Mulroney's party has 169 of the 295 seats in the House of
Commons. The opposition Liberal Party holds 82 and the socialist New
Democratic Party 43.

<HEAD>Safety Council: 350-450 May Die in Christmas Weekend Traffic
Accidents</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Traffic accidents on the nation's highways during
the Christmas weekend may kill between 350 and 450 people, the
National Safety Council says.
   Last year, 389 people were killed in auto accidents over the
Christmas holiday, Barbara Carraro, a council statistician, said
Thursday.
   During a normal Friday night through Monday non-holiday period in
December an estimated 380 people die in crashes, she said.
   The council, headquarted in Chicago, said millions of Americans
would drive an estimated 11.1 billion miles between 6 p.m. Friday
and 11:59 p.m. Monday.
   The council said its projection for traffic deaths over New
Year's weekend was also 350 to 450.

<HEAD>Study: Higher Drinking Age Reduces Fatal Traffic Accidents</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARK PERKISS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Tougher penalties for drunken driving have no
effect on fatal auto accidents among 19- and 20-year-olds, but
raising the drinking age to 21 leads to a dramatic reduction in
deaths, a study suggests.
   The fatality rate in single-vehicle, nighttime crashes involving
drivers 19 and 20 years old declined 38 percent in the 28 months
after Tennessee raised its drinking age from 19 to 21, said Dr.
Michael Decker of the Vanderbilt University School of Medicine.
   Tougher penalties for drunken driving, imposed by Tennessee in
1982, did not change the nighttime fatality rate among 19 and 20
year olds, said Decker, whose study appears in today's Journal of
the American Medical Association.
   ``The threat of penalty in and of itself is not enough to solve
the problem (of drunken driving),'' he said. ``The true risk of
being apprehended is so small that however Draconian the penalties
are, it's not worth worrying about getting caught.''
   In another JAMA report today, two studies found that requiring
the use of seat belts signficantly reduced injuries and deaths and
that accident victims who do not wear the seat belts pay nearly
triple the health care bills of those who do.
   Those studies examined accidents in North Carolina from 1981 to
1983 and accident victims taken to the trauma units of four
Chicago-area hospitals.
   The Tennessee study examined statistics on drivers ages 15 to 24
in 1980 through 1986, said Decker, an assistant professor of
preventive medicine.
   ``There's absolutely no reason to think the results would be
substantially different in other states _ particularly now that
there's some uniformity in the state drinking age laws,'' he said
Wednesday.
   Motor vehicle accidents cause almost 40 percent of deaths among
youths 15 to 24, and drunken driving is involved about half the
time, the study said.
   Drinking ages varied across the country until Congress passed a
law in 1984 requiring states to raise the limit to 21 or lose
highway funds. Wyoming was the last state to comply, raising its
drinking age as of July 1.
   Tennessee's drinking age was 21 until 1971, when it was reduced
to 18. The limit was raised to 19 in 1979 and 21 on Aug. 1, 1984,
although people who were 19 by that date retained the right to drink
as the law was phased in over two years.
   In the 28 months after the drinking age was raised to 21, the
single-vehicle nighttime fatality rate among 19- and 20-year-old was
14.8 per 100 million miles driven _ a 38 percent decline from the
rate of 23.7 per 100 million vehicle miles during the preceding 55
months, the study said. It did not give exact numbers.
   The study showed little change in the fatality rate among people
21 to 24, whose right to drink was unaffected by the change in the
drinking age, Decker said.

   Cards for an ill child are arriving by
the tens of thousands at the home of a woman who has been so
inundated by the mail that she says she no longer has room to
prepare Christmas dinner.
   ``We all have to go to a restaurant for Christmas. I can't even
have Christmas in my own home,'' says Frances Keefe, founder of
Child's Wish Come True. ``This cannot go on.''
   Pleas to stop sending cards only brought more, says Mrs. Keefe.
On Tuesday it was 110,000 cards, and 70,000 more on Wednesday.
Nearly 1 million pieces of mail arrived over a 10-day period,
prompting Mrs. Keefe to notify postal officials that she would no
longer accept mail for ``David.''
   Mrs. Keefe's organization tries to grant the wishes of dying
children, and she thought she was doing just that last year when she
began a campaign to help a cancer victim she'd heard of in England.
   Actually, the boy's name is Mario Morby. He lives in Steely,
England. His cancer is in remission. And he wants no more cards.
   In September 1987, when 13-year-old Mario was critically ill, he
decided he wanted his name to appear in the Guinness Book of World
Records for receiving more postcards than anyone else.
   His family made a public plea, and soon more than enough cards
were coming in. They've never stopped, even after Mario had more
than enough to earn him a spot in the record book, which has dropped
the category in the 1989 edition.
   Despite pleas from his family that the cards be stopped, an
estimated 3 million have been mailed from around the world to
Steely, near Birmingham. Most have been placed in a warehouse by
local postal authorities.
   Earlier this month, Mrs. Keefe and an organization in West Palm
Beach that had pitched in to help her appealed to well-wishers to
stop the card campaign.
   After it became apparent her efforts to end the flow of cards had
failed, a three-member board of the Florida Child's Wish Come True
advised Mrs. Keefe to begin refusing the mail. She decided Wednesday
to take that step.
   The decision was tough because so many people were touched, Mrs.
Keefe said, but ``enough is enough.''

<HEAD>Heavy Rain Leaves Four Dead in Louisiana; Ice, Snow Coat Midwest
And West</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   A storm system unleashed tornadoes in Louisiana and left four
dead on rain-pelted highways before it met with cold Canadian air in
the upper Midwest, coating roads with freezing rain.
   A second winter storm, blamed for two other deaths, covered much
of the Northwest with snow. forcing roads to close. Forecasters
predicted more of the same for the holiday weekend.
   Two tornadoes touched down in west-central Louisiana Thursday
night, and strong thunderstorm winds blew a house off its foundation
and damaged two apartment complexes in Natchitoches. No injuries
were reported.
   Less than 25 miles to the north, a 6-month-old infant was among
four Coushatta area residents killed when four vehicles collided
during heavy rain, Louisiana State Police said. Three others were
injured.
   The strong flow of moisture from the Gulf of Mexico encountered
cold Canadian air in the upper Midwest, resulting in freezing rain
from northern lower Michigan into central Minnesota. Showers and
thunderstorms also extended from southern Indiana and western
Kentucky to Illinois and southeastern Texas.
   In Springfield, Ill., the heavy rain set a record of 2.18 inches
for the day.
   Freezing rain made roads in northern Michigan treacherous.
Reports of traffic accidents were numerous, and sand and salt trucks
were unable to cope with the heavy ice.
   The wet weather was expected to spread across the northeastern
United States today.
   Snow, meanwhile, extended from the West Coast through eastern
North Dakota and eastern South Dakota to northeast Minnesota.
Snowfall totals in eastern South Dakota ranged up to 7 inches around
the Huron area by late Thursday.
   A cold front brought another round of snow to the mountains of
the West. Up to a foot of snow covered higher elevations of western
Nevada, and heavy snow continued today in Utah's mountains.
   A succession of snowstorms also hit southern Idaho, an area that
could escape a third drought year next summer with an ample snowpack.
   A second storm over the Pacific Ocean was expected to bring more
snow to start the Christmas weekend.
   On Thursday, a 59-year-old man was killed when his car went out
of control on an icy road in Mangna, Utah, and rolled over,
authorities said. The day before, an 80-year-old Idaho Falls, Idaho,
died of a stroke he suffered while clearing snow with a snowblower,
police said.
   The forecast for today called for rain in the eastern Great Lakes
through the Appalachians, eastern parts of the lower Ohio and
Tennessee valleys into the central Gulf region, and from the Pacific
Northwest to the central California coast.
   Snow was expected for central and eastern New England and in the
West over much of eastern Washington state, Utah and western
Colorado; freezing rain or sleet turning into rain in central New
England; and snowshowers across northern parts of the upper
Mississippi Valley and upper Great Lakes.
   Highs were expected in the teens and 20s from western Montana
into western Wyoming, across the northern Plains and in northern New
England; 50s and 60s from the central Pacific coast region through
the desert Southwest, the southern Plains, Arkansas, lower Ohio and
Tennessee valleys to the Carolina coast. The 70s were expected from
central and eastern Texas across the Gulf Coast into the southern
Atlantic Coast; 80s in the southern tip of Texas and southwest
Florida; and 30s and 40s across the rest of the nation.
   Temperatures around the nation at 2 a.m. EST ranged from minus 2
degrees at Havre, Mont., to 72 degrees at Corpus Christi, Texas, and
Homestead and West Palm Beach, Fla.
   Other reports:
   _East: Atlanta 56 partly cloudy; Boston 23 cloudy; Buffalo 37

   The U.S. dollar was mixed in moribund pre-Christmas
trading this morning. Gold prices were fractionally higher.
   ``Activity is very, very modest,'' said a Rome bank trader.
``There's absolutely no trend to be detected in the market.''
   In Frankfurt, a dealer at a major European bank said: ``Whatever
little activity we see comes from corporate desks.''
   Traders said the market is likely to remain trendless throughout
next week with business not picking up until the new year.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day begins,
the dollar rose 0.33 Japanese yen to a closing 124.95 yen. Later, in
London, it slipped back to 124.70 yen.
   Other dollar rates at mid-morning, compared with late Thursday:
   _1.7745 West German marks, up from 1.7735

   _1.1950 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1959
   In London, the British pound rose to $1.8035 from $1.7990 late
Thursday.
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $417.20 a troy ounce,
down from $417.25 bid late Thursday. At midmorning Friday, the
city's five major bullion dealers fixed a higher recommended price
of $417.55.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $417.40, up from $417 bid late
Thursday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold rose $1.86 to close at a bid $416.59.
   Silver was quoted in London Friday at a bid price of $6.14 a troy

<TEXT>
   Vietnam's Parliament adjourned its
winter session after demanding greater reform and strongly
criticizing the Communist government for the country's economic
problems, official reports seen today said.
   The government not only accepted the criticism but President Do
Muoi admitted that ``sluggish, inconsistent, perfunctory''
management had worsened the crisis, official Radio Hanoi said.
   ``Few countries in the world have followed in our country's
footsteps by patterning their 1988 scientific-technical norms after
those backward trends set some 15 to 20 years ago,'' he said.
   The 10-day session adjourned Thursday after passing 10
resolutions, including resolutions on making changes and amendments
to the constitution, Radio Hanoi said. A text of the broadcast did
not specify what changes and amendments were sought.
   In a closing speech, assembly chairman Le Quang Dao said 1989 was
the ``pivotal year'' for implementing economic reforms endorsed by
the 1986 Communist Party congress, which also ushered in more
critical thinking and ``openness'' in most aspects of Vietnamese
life. The Western-style reforms are aimed at boosting production
through decentralization of management and other measures.
   ``However, our country is facing great ordeals which require the
National Assembly, the Council of Ministers (central government),
and all the people to renovate even more profoundly and
vigorously,'' he said.
   The Vietnam News Agency called the session ``the liveliest in the
life of this country's legislative body.''
   ``Many deputies were strongly critical of the Council of
Minister's weaknesses and mistakes in handling the economy and
managing society,'' it said in a report Monday.
   They demanded more economic autonomy for local areas and
reductions of agricultural taxes they said were hindering
production. Last week, Minister of Finance Hoang Qui admitted before
the Parliament that the tax system has to be ``completely revamped.''
   In Wednesday's session, Do Muoi conceded the government's
mismanagement in a speech and said: ``I admit these shortcomings
before the National Assembly and promise to draw experience from
them.''
   He acknowledged that in per capita income terms, Vietnam is
ranked one of the poorest nations on earth.
   Do Muoi said government spending has far exceeded national income
``and has even consumed our national capital and loans from foreign
countries and does not show any signs of improvement.''

<TEXT>
   Since philosopher Leszek Kolakowski broke
his 20-year exile to visit his homeland, he has been toasted by the
opposition and ignored by the Communist Party to which he once
belonged.
   Hundreds of colleagues, friends and students too young to have
heard the young Kolakowski openly criticize Polish authorities have
been filling auditoriums for the so-called ``Kolakowski Festival''
that began Monday.
   The lectures are the first in Poland by the 61-year-old
Kolakowski since he was expelled from Warsaw University in 1968.
Kolakowski's works are published in Poland only by the underground
press.
   Based at Oxford University in England, Kolakowski has become one
of the world's leading philosophers, winning fame for his
three-volume ``History of Marxist Thought,'' which focuses on what
the author calls discrepancies between dogma and practice in
communist countries.
   ``The lectures have become a `Kolakowski Festival' and an
important one for us,'' said Jerzy Turowicz, editor of the
influential Catholic weekly Tygodnik Powszechny in Krakow.
   About 500 students, academics and leading members of the Polish
opposition squeezed together on the dark wooden benches of the main
auditorium at Warsaw University on Monday to hear Kolakowski's first
lecture.
   They gave Kolakowski a two-minute standing ovation when he stood
up to speak.
   Kolakowski told the audience that when he left Poland in 1968,
three secret police cars accompanied him to the airport, while on
this trip they haven't paid him any attention.
   On Wednesday, at an evening sponsored by the Warsaw branch of the
Club of the Catholic Intelligentsia in the basement of a Warsaw
church, Kolakowski easily answered questions on the existence of
devils and mystics and the link between philosophy and religion.
   But when a question about the future of the banned trade union
movement Solidarity was raised, Kolakowski hesitated. ``I have no
recipe. Nothing is guaranteed,'' he said.
   Poland's Communist Party this year admitted wrongdoing in its
purge of intellectuals and Jews in 1968 and made clear that the
flood of scholars who left the country then were welcome to return.
   The granting of a visa to Kolakowski, visiting as a guest of the
Polish Philosophical Society, is the most dramatic acceptance to
date of that invitation. Kolakowski is expected to stay in Poland
about three weeks.
   Kolakowski began his academic career as a party member in the
early 1950s but quickly clashed with orthodox communist ideologues.
   In 1956, during a political thaw after Stalin's death known as
the Polish October, Kolakowski and a small group of communist
intellectuals started Straight Talk, a lively journal of critical
Marxist theory.
   The young philosopher urged the party to strive for ``integral
democracy.'' For that view, the party leadership branded Kolakowski
a ``revisionist'' and Straight Talk survived only a year before
authorities banned it.
   A 1966 university lecture on the Polish October, in which
Kolakowski accused authorities of breaking promises to the Polish
people, cost the professor his party card.
   The final blow to Kolakowski's academic career came when the
Minister of Education revoked his chair after the philosopher
defended students who had participated in March 1968 unrest.
   Kolakowski soon left Poland and joined other Soviet bloc
philosophers bloc forced into exile for their views, including Georg
Lukacs of Hungary, deported to Romania in 1956, and Ernst Bloch, who
lost his chair at the University of Leipzig in East Germany in 1957.
   He taught at universities in Canada and the United States and
finally settled at Oxford University.

   A pilot was arrested for investigation
of flying under the influence of alcohol after his small plane
crashed onto an interstate highway, injuring the four people aboard,
authorities said.
   Gordon Flockhart, 29, of Simi Valley, was being held by sheriff's
deputies following the crash, which left him with a broken ankle,
one passenger with a broken back and two others with bumps and
bruises, authorities said.
   An empty whiskey bottle was found on the plane and a blood test
revealed that Flockhart was under the influence of alcohol, said
sheriff's Deputy David Smedley. He said further tests will determine
the blood-alcohol level.
   Nobody on the ground was hurt in Thursday evening's crash of the
single-engine Piper Archer 2 onto the southbound lanes of Interstate
15, 70 miles northeast of Los Angeles, authorities said.

<TEXT>
   Finnish police said today they have
questioned an Arab resident in connection with a telephoned bomb
warning to the U.S. Embassy against an American airliner.
   Though some details of the warning appeared to fit the crash
Wednesday of a Pan Am jumbo jet in Scotland, police said they found
no proof of a link between the warning and the tragedy that killed
all 258 people on board and 22 people in Lockerbie.
   Seppo Tiitinen, chief of the Security Police, said the call was a
message of warning, rather than a threat.
   The U.S. Embassy was warned Dec. 5 that an Arab residing in
Finland would plant a bomb aboard an American airliner originating
from Frankfurt, West Germany, ``within a couple of weeks,'' he said.
Pan Am Flight 103 originated in Frankfurt as a Boeing 727, and
continued from London as a Boeing 747.
   The caller, who spoke English with an Arabic accent, said the
bomb would be carried aboard the aircraft by a Finnish woman, but it
was not clear if she would be a willing accomplice, Tiitinen told
the Associated Press.
   The same caller had issued bomb warnings to the Israeli and U.S.
embassies earlier this year, each time naming the would-be bomber,
Tiitinen said. The caller said the Abu Nidal group, an extremist
Palestinian organization, was behind the plan.
   Tiitinen said the identity of the caller was not certain, but
officers had spoken to the man that the caller accused of preparing
the bomb.
   ``It's a man who has been living in Finland for some time and is
married to a Finnish woman,'' he said. He declined to identify him
by name, but said he had no record of trouble with the police.
   ``We have questioned this man both in connection with earlier
threats and now after the crash in Scotland, but so far we have no
reason to believe that he has anything to do with threats or the
accident,'' Tiitinen said.
   He said police thought the calls were connected to a personal
feud between the two men. ``We think it's more a case of personal
relationships than anything else,'' Tiitinen said.
   But he denied the warnings were dismissed. ``All messages have
been taken very seriously,'' he said.
   Tiitinen said the phone warnings began in the first half of this
year to the Israeli embassy, and were similarly worded. He declined
to say how many times the embassies were called.
   Israeli embassy spokesman Ehud Eytam said a check of the
embassy's records the last four months showed no evidence of
telephoned threats.
   The U.S. Embassy referred callers to the State Department in
Washington.
   Undersecretary of State Ronald Spiers said in Washington that the
Federal Aviation Administration issued an alert after a bomb threat
was received by the Helsinki embassy Dec. 5.

   A newspaper today quoted a security source as
saying investigators were taking ``very seriously'' a pro-Iranian
group's claim that it was responsible for the crash of a Pan Am
jetliner in Scotland.
   The Independent quoted the senior British security source as
saying the group is thought to have sought revenge for the July 3
downing of an Iranian jetliner by a U.S. warship in the Persian Gulf.
   An anonymous caller to The Associated Press in London claimed
Thursday the Guardians of the Islamic Revolution were responsible
for Wednesday's crash of Pan Am Flight 103, which killed all 258 on
board and 22 people on the ground.
   Iran's Foreign Ministry today said the claim was a ``crude
propaganda ploy'' designed to discredit Iran, and it denied
involvement in the crash.
   The official Islamic Republic News Agency, monitored in Nicosia,
quoted an unidentified ministry spokesman as saying in Tehran: ``The
scheme seems to be deliberately designed by foreign enemies of Iran
for specific purposes.''
   The Independent quoted the unnamed source as identifying the
group as ``a fundamentalist Moslem group of Lebanon-based Islamic
Jihad fanatics.''
   Investigators also focused on pre-crash threats of a terrorist
strike.
   In Washington, U.S. officials said an anonymous caller to the
U.S. Embassy in Helsinki, Finland, said Dec. 5 that a bomb would be
planted aboard a Pan Am flight from Frankfurt, West Germany, to the
United States within two weeks.
   George Churchill-Coleman, head of Scotland Yard's anti-terrorist
branch, opened an investigation Thursday of the London stopover of
Flight 103, which originated in Frankfurt and was bound for New York.
   The sabotage theory focused on transfer of luggage between the
Boeing 727 that flew the Frankfurt-London leg, and the Boeing 747
that took off for New York.
   Government and industry officials said it seemed clear the Boeing
747 broke apart in flight, strewing blazing wreckage over the
Scottish village of Lockerbie and surrounding hills.
   Such a sudden catastrophe would be consistent with flight
controller reports that the cockpit sent no distress call as the
plane, having reached cruising altitude of 31,000 feet, disappeared
from radar.
   The Times of London said the Air Accident Investigation Branch of
Britain's Transport Department was examining wreckage under
microscopes to measure the depth of indentations.
   It said years of research showed that if a bomb is detonated in
an aircraft, fragments smash into their surroundings with 10 times
more force than if the plane is downed for some other reason.
   It said investigators were also looking for minute traces of
burns or of explosive itself on seats and victims.
   ``It is in many ways like a criminal investigation,'' Lockerbie
Police Superintendent Angus Kennedy told reporters. ``You have to
preserve the scene. We have to photograph bodies, and bits and
pieces. It is a very long and very painstaking task.''
   Other news reports quoted investigators as saying that the fact a
few pieces of wreckage were found up to 80 miles from Lockerbie
suggested the plane had been blown apart by a powerful bomb.

<TEXT>
   Algerians re-elected Chadli Bendjedid to
his third presidential term by a smaller margin than ever before,
but still gave him a mandate to continue reforms that began two
months ago.
   Thg Interior Ministry announced early today that Bendjedid, the
single candidate, had captured 81 percent of Thursday's vote.
   About 89 percent of the country's 12 million eligible voters cast
ballots. Voter turnout in Algeria traditionally runs at about 90
percent.
   As in most one-party states where a single candidate is on the
ballot, voter abstention is seen as the only real form of dissent in
elections.
   Although still winning a high percentage of votes, the win was 14
percent smaller than 1984 when Bendjedid garnered 95 percent of the
vote with voter turnout at about 95 percent. In 1979, he took 94
percent.
   While reflecting a decline in popularity, the election still
gives Bendjedid a clear mandate to continue with the economic
reforms introduced after a week of rioting in early October that
claimed 176 lives.
   Rioters filled the streets to protest high unemployment,
inflation and a chronic housing shortage. In an effort to restore
calm, Bendjedid promised a more liberal political system and less
central control of both the economy and society.
   In his third term, Bendjedid faces the task of reducing the power
of a military and civilian bureaucracy that has built a comfortable
position in the 25 years since independence from France.
   He also has promised to loosen the grip of the National
Liberation Front, the only legal political party, on all aspects of
Algerian life. One problem is how to permit more autonomy and
democratic freedom without allowing opposition parties.
   The severe economic problems remain, many traceable to several
years of low oil prices on world markets. Unemployment and annual
inflation have surpassed 20 percent and the foreign debt is $23
billion.

<HEAD>SRP Manager Says Plant Could Be Started Immediately If Needed</HEAD>
<DATELINE>AUGUSTA, Ga. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Savannah River Plant's reactors, which
have been shut down by safety concerns, could be restarted
immediately if the nation's defense demanded more nuclear weapons
material, the complex's manager said.
   But plant manager John T. Lowe declined to say when he thought
the plant in South Carolina nearly 20 miles southeast of here would
be restarted.
   ``I think that remains to be defined,'' Lowe said in interviews
published today in The Augusta Chronicle and the Augusta Herald.
``There has been speculation that it would be six months or 12
months. I really think until the ... criteria are well defined ...
it's sheer speculation to pick a date.
   ``I certainly think they (the reactors) can be restarted safely.
I think if the nation judged there was a need for the materials ...
they could be restarted today.''
   Lowe was interviewed Thursday, on the same day U.S. Energy
Secretary John Herrington announced that ultrasonic testing would be
used to check for possible cracks in reactor vessels. That could
delay SRP's restart until next summer.
   All three Savannah River reactors have been shut down since
summer for safety upgrades and maintenance. The shutdown is one of a
number of problems plaguing the nation's nuclear weapons production
system, including plants in Fernald, Ohio, and Rocky Flats, Colo.
   Some have expressed concern the shutdown at Savannah River could
harm the nation's defense because the complex is America's only
producer of tritium, an isotope of hydrogen which is a critical
element in hydrogen bombs and which deteriorates at the rate of 5.5
percent a year.
   Lowe contended that the plant is safe to operate now, and said
the U.S. Department of Energy wants to increase the complex's
``margin of safety.'' The reactors have ``run safely for 35 years
meeting the nation's needs,'' said Lowe, whose employer, Du Pont,
runs the plant for DOE. ``They've run without a nuclear incident
that was an injury to anybody either on or off the plant, and
they've been continuously upgraded over that time.''
   Lowe said politics have played a role in the debate over the
plant's safety. Plant officials were criticized in congressional
hearings earlier this year for not adequately reporting past safety
problems.
   ``Certainly, if you go back in time from 1950 to this year, we
have not only provided DOE with notification of what we considered
significant events ... but also a wrapup of what it meant,'' Lowe
countered.
   ``But with all the current attention, there is an increasing
emphasis from the DOE to know things sooner and at a greater level
of detail. And so we're working to develop a system and have that
available to them.
   ``Some of it's clearly congressional pressure.''
   Du Pont is wrapping up its involvement with the plant, which
dates back to the plant's construction in the 1950s. Westinghouse is
scheduled to take over operations of the facility April 1.

   The pilot of a medical helicopter that
crashed in heavy fog, killing a young patient and two medical
workers, may have been trying to head for an airport southwest of
town, officials said.
   The Bell Long Ranger Model 206L crashed in a muddy soybean field
before dawn Thursday, killing James Rhodes, 7, who had suffered a
broken neck in Marion, Ill., hours earlier and was being airlifted
to St. Francis Hospital.
   Also killed were flight nurse Karen Scherer, 26, and respiratory
therapist Julie Huttegger, 22.
   Pilot Sheldon Rudzek, 39, was in stable condition today at St.
Francis, hospital officials said. He underwent surgery for multiple
fractures, including broken legs, and suffered second- and
third-degree burns over 15 percent of his body.
   Rudzek was in radio contact with St. Francis and reported no
trouble during the 30-minute, 40-mile flight from Marion, where he
picked James up, emergency room officials said. Contact was lost
just before the aircraft went down about three miles from the
hospital around 4:30 a.m.
   A farmer found the craft's wreckage nearly three hours later.
   Skies were clear when the helicopter, owned by Air Evac in West
Plains, left Marion, said hospital spokeswoman Mary Spell.
   Cape Girardeau, a city of about 35,000 people about 110 miles
south of St. Louis on the Mississippi River, ``just got socked in
(by fog) real quick,'' said Spell. ``The last that was heard was
when Air Evac 3 was circling the Cape Girardeau airport in really
heavy fog.''
   Two Federal Aviation Administration inspectors were at the crash
site Thursday and a National Transportation Safety Board
investigator was sent to the scene, said FAA spokesman Bob
Raynesford.
   Air Evac owner Bill Chritton said the company has minimum weather
standards for its flights but that final decisions are left to
pilots.
   ``No one requires the pilot to fly. Any operator in the United
States would have flown this particular mission,'' Chritton said in
defending Rudzek's decision to make the flight.
   The accident was the third crash by an Air Evac helicopter
resulting in death or injury in three years.

<TEXT>
   An apology from a judge who said he gave a killer a
lenient sentence because the victims were ``queers'' did little to
ease the demands of gay rights activists and others who want him
removed from the bench.
   ``He has cast a reasonable doubt into the minds of people across
this nation about Dallas justice,'' said William Waybourn, president
of the Dallas Gay Alliance.
   ``He has raised the question of his judicial fitness and ability
to be impartial. This question cannot be answered with a simple
apology.''
   State District Judge Jack Hampton apologized on Thursday for a
``poor choice of words.''
   Hampton told the Dallas Times Herald last week that he sentenced
Richard Lee Bednarski, 18, to 30 years in prison instead of life on
Nov. 28, in part because the two victims were homosexuals who
``wouldn't have been killed if they hadn't been cruising the streets
picking up teen-age boys.''
   ``I don't much care for queers cruising the streets picking up
teen-age boys. I've got a teen-age boy,'' the judge told the
newspaper.
   Hampton's statements outraged the gay community, which filed a
complaint with the Texas Commission on Judicial Conduct that could
lead to his removal.
   Elected officials, including State Treasurer Ann Richards and
U.S. Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., also criticized Hampton, as did
church leaders, some with large gay congregations, who asked him to
repudiate the statements.
   The judge's apology was addressed to the ministers.
   ``I did not mean to condemn the homosexual community generally
and I used a poor choice of words and I'm sorry about that,''
Hampton said. He said he ``did not intend to state that any victim
of crime was entitled to less fair treatment.''
   The judge said Thursday he considered a variety of factors in
sentencing Bednarski, including the defendant's age, his lack of a
criminal record and ``what the victims were doing out there, but not
their lifestyle.''
   Hampton is up for re-election in 1990.
   ``His apology to eight citizens is not enough. His apology to
every citizen is not enough,'' Waybourn said. ``Bednarski, the
executor-murderer, cannot get off by apologizing. Neither can Judge
Hampton.''
   About 50 sign-carrying demonstrators gathered in support of
Hampton outside the courthouse.
   ``I think that is very generous of Judge Hampton. I think that
merely shows how fair he is,'' attorney Bill McKnight said of the
apology. ``I do not know who bestowed sacred cow status on the
homosexuals of this community _ I don't think they deserve it.''

<HEAD>Palestinian Leader Calls For Military Action Against Israel</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KUWAIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Palestinian leader said the yearlong uprising
against Israeli occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip should be
escalated with military action.
   Salim Zaanoun, deputy speaker of the Palestine National Council,
the PLO's parliament-in-exile, suggested Thursday night that the
uprising take ``serious action to launch military operations here
and there.''
   He differentiated between military action and terrorism, saying
military action ``is sanctioned by international law as long as our
land is occupied.''
   Zaanoun was addressing a rally at the Palestine Liberation
Organization office in Kuwait to mark the 21st anniversary of the
Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, a leftist guerrilla
group led by George Habash.
   The Popular Front is united with Yasser Arafat's mainstream Fatah
and other groups under the PLO umbrella.
   Zaanoun cautioned against expecting too much from the recently
initiated PLO-U.S. dialogue.
   ``The United States has lost too much and wants to compensate for
this loss by this theatrical piece,'' he said.
   ``We have to pursue an even-handed approach to avoid expecting
too much from the diplomatic moves and devote part of our effort for
struggle and perpetuation of the momentum of the uprising.''
   He said the uprising should ``continue and become more vigorous.''
   Kuwait's Al-Qabas daily quoted Arafat, the PLO chairman, as
ruling out acceptance of anywhere but Jerusalem as capital of the
Palestinian state.
   ``A Palestinian state with holy Jerusalem as its capital is our
demand, to which we will stick,'' he was quoted as saying in an
interview.
   He also rejected the notion of demilitarizing the Palestinian
state ``unless Israel is disarmed,'' the newspaper said.
   ``We should be equal,'' he was quoted as saying. ``We want a
completely sovereign state. Why should the Palestinians abandon part
of their sovereignty and Israel not be asked to do so?''
   The United States initiated dialogue with the PLO after Arafat
explicitly recognized Israel's right to exist and renounced
terrorism. Arafat said he had not ``succumbed'' to U.S. conditions
so the talks could start.
   ``I did not change my policy. It was the United States which
changed its policy,'' he said.
   Asked what prompted the U.S. government to change its stand,
Arafat said: ``Undoubtedly it was the attitude of 154 member states
of the United Nations who decided to shift the venue of the U.N.
General Assembly debate on the Palestinian question to Geneva.''
   This move was taken after Washington denied Arafat a visa, thus
barring him from addressing the General Assembly in New York.

   Unidentified guerrillas attacked
Israeli-backed militiamen with rockets and machine guns in south
Lebanon today. Police said two militiamen were wounded.
   A police spokesman said the guerrillas launched two attacks at
first light against positions manned by the Israeli-armed South
Lebanon Army near the villages of Beit Leef and Beit Yahoun.
   The attackers ``withdrew to safety behind a fierce mortar
barrage,'' said the spokesman, who cannot be named under standing
regulations.
   The two wounded South Lebanon Army men were admitted to a
hospital in Marjayoun, a Christian town inside Israel's
self-proclaimed ``security zone'' in south Lebanon, the spokesman
said.
   Israel established the 6-to-10-mile-wide strip when it withdrew
the bulk of its occupation army from south Lebanon in the summer of
1985.
   The zone, patrolled by South Lebanon Army and Israeli troops,
serves as a buffer against cross-border guerrilla attacks.

   A woman who survived a heart attack and
spent three months in the hospital with an infection came home to
find a letter saying she died.
   ``It doesn't seem fair that the state of Illinois keeps insisting
that I'm dead when I have fought so hard to live,'' Eugenia Konrath,
49, said Wednesday.
   The letter from the state Department of Public Aid computer said
she was no longer eligible for medical assistance because she is
dead. Despite the letter, which she opened in September, she
continues to receive benefits.
   Ms. Konrath said she received a call Wednesday that the problem
had been located and was being corrected. But she said she's heard
that story before.
   ``When I call they tell me they are sorry and that everything has
been taken care of,'' Ms. Konrath said. ``I take a deep breath and
then here comes another letter.''
   ``After I got the second letter, I thought it had to be some kind
of joke. The third letter was no joke.''
   Sandra Lynn, a spokeswoman for public aid, said she only knows of
one notice sent to Ms. Konrath. She said the letter resulted from a
computer error.
   Ms. Konrath, who has undergone surgery six times in the past
year, said her medical expenses have totaled more than $100,000
during that period.
   Ms. Konrath said she has diabetes and has been disabled by a
heart condition. Infectious arthritis required the amputation of a
toe earlier this year and the infection damaged her bones, forcing
her to use a wheelchair, she said.

   Dozens of students demonstrated in a
southern city to demand the release before Christmas of a peace
activist jailed for refusing to comply with a court order,
opposition spokesmen said today.
   The demonstration was held Thursday in the southern city of Opole
on behalf of Krzysztof Galinski, 23, who was taken by police from
his class at a technical college Dec. 13, spokesmen from the Freedom
and Peace group said.
   They said Galinski refused to carry out 80 hours compulsory labor
he was sentenced to in March after police searched his apartment and
found copies of leaflets connected with a planned opposition
``happening.''
   For failing to perform the work, a court in September ordered
Galinski jailed one month, leading to his December arrest, Freedom
and Peace said.
   ``All this proves that the democratization and liberalization in
Poland is a farce,'' said a statement signed by Freedom and Peace
activist Anna Niedzwiecka.
   ``The government talks to Lech Walesa and lets him go to Paris,
which is very good, but at the same time a huge majority of Peace
and Freedom participants are refused passports, imprisoned or
threatened with arrest. ... This is the real image of perestroika in
Poland.''
   Freedom and Peace is a banned nationwide group of mostly young
people opposed to the military, the draft and nuclear power.
   A spokesman for the Interior Ministry in Warsaw, asked about
Galinski's case, said he was not familiar with it.

   A fire that may have been caused by
exploding fireworks swept through a ship carrying more than 120
people today, and the coast guard said one person died and at least
three people were injured.
   Passengers and crew abandoned the 1441-ton Dona Conchita five
miles off Panay island, 250 miles southeast of Manila, said coast
guard Lt. Enrico Coching. Coching said a 66-year-old woman was the
only confirmed fatality.
   He said three people were injured, two with severe burns.
   There were widely varying reports on how many people were aboard
the ship. Coching said 206 passengers and crew had been rescued.
   Bob Gothong, executive vice president of the Carlos A. Gothong
Shipping Lines, which owned the vessel, said company records
indicated the ship was carrying 107 passengers and 48 crew members.
In Cebu City, Alfredo Gothong, a company director, said the ship was
carrying 128 passengers and crew.
   Alfredo Gothong said two people, including a pregnant woman,
managed to reach shore and checked into a hospital with broken bones.
   The rest were rescued by the ship, Our Lady of Hope, which rushed
to the area to help, he said, and the company was ``90 percent
certain'' that all those aboard had been accounted for.
   The coast guard said the Dona Conchita, still afire hours after
the blaze broke out, drifted into shallow water and ran aground on
Panay island about five miles northeast of Roxas City.
   Survivors said they were roused from sleep by screams of fellow
passengers and jumped into the Sibuyan Sea. ``There was fire,'' said
Pedro Adiola, 51. We jumped into the water and swam.'' He said it
took nearly two hours for the first rescue vessels to reach the area.
   The Dona Conchita left New Washington on Panay island at 2 a.m.
today bound for Palompon on Leyte island and caught fire three hours
later, company officials said.
   Bob Gothong said the crew radioed that firecracker explosions
were heard and then a blaze started in the vessel's cargo hold. The
fireworks cargo ``must have been loaded illegally, declared as
something else,'' he said.
   He did not know how many fireworks had been aboard but said ``the
crew reported a lot of explosions.''
   The skipper radioed a distress signal and ordered passengers and
crew to abandon ship at 5 a.m., he said.

   Actor Kurt Russell personally served venison from
his recent Celebrity Hunt to the needy and made the point that the
meat was being put to good use.
   ``To see the expression on the people's faces is pretty
satisfying,'' said Russell, who held a hunt that drew 32 athletes,
actors and popular musicians as well as the ire of animal rights
activists.
   Wearing a flannel shirt and blue jeans, he dished out venison
stew Thursday to hundreds of homeless and needy people at the
Salvation Army's Champa Street Center.
   Russell donated 500 pounds of the big game meat to the Salvation
Army in Denver and 500 pounds to the Rescue Mission in Grand
Junction in western Colorado. He planned to go to Grand Junction to
participate in the meal for the homeless there today.
   Russell, who lives part of the year in the Colorado Rockies, said
he wanted the hunt to ``show the reason that you take game is for
providing either for yourself or your family or, in this case, for
other people, to get the message out to other hunters that we are
able to maybe take some of our game and donate it to people who
really need it.''
   Nonetheless, his hunt troubled animal rights activists and
triggered a dispute over hunting licenses with state agencies.
   Animal rights activists and some Hollywood celebrities took out a
full page ad in the show-business publication Variety protesting the
hunt.

<TEXT>
   Three polygamist clan members wept and
hugged their families after a jury convicted them on reduced
homicide charges in the shooting death of a law officer killed
during a 13-day siege.
   Clan patriarch Addam Swapp, 27, and his brother-in-law, John
Timothy Singer, 22, were convicted of manslaughter Thursday in the
death of state Corrections Lt. Fred House. Swapp's brother, Jonathan
Swapp, 21, was convicted of negligent homicide.
   House was killed during a Jan. 28 shootout that ended the clan's
armed standoff with police at their Marion farm. The impasse had
begun 13 days earlier when Addam Swapp, who said he was guided by a
divine revelation, bombed a nearby Mormon chapel.
   The three had been charged with second-degree murder in the death
of House, who was struck by a rifle bullet as he directed police
dogs to attack the Swapp brothers in an arrest attempt coordinated
by an FBI hostage rescue team.
   The maximum penalty for second-degree murder is five years to
life in prison. For manslaughter, the maximum term is five years,
and for negligent homicide one year in jail and a $2,500 fine.
   Third District Judge Michael Murphy scheduled sentencing for Jan.
20.
   The trio was somber and observers silent as the verdicts were
read. But after court adjourned, Addam Swapp wept as he leaned over
a rail to embrace his wives, sisters, sons and brother-in-law.
Jonathan Swapp also embraced his wife, whom he married in a
jailhouse ceremony in November.
   ``I'm pleased and disappointed by the verdict, disappointed
because we have an abiding conviction of the innocence of our
clients,'' said John Bucher, Addam Swapp's attorney.
   Fred Metos, Singer's attorney, said his client was relieved
because he escaped a lengthy prison term. Earl Spafford, Jonathan
Swapp's lawyer, said he ``couldn't be happier'' with the jury's
decision.
   Addam Swapp was seriously wounded by an FBI sharpshooter during
the 20-second exchange in January. He said he never fired, and
agents differed as to whether he was shouldering his rifle when he
was shot.
   Singer acknowledged firing the shot that killed House but said he
was shooting at the dogs. Jonathan Swapp also admitted firing his
rifle but said he was trying to keep officers from shooting his
brother again.
   Prosecutor Dave Schwendiman and fellow prosecutor Creighton
Horton said they were neither surprised nor disappointed by the
verdict.
   ``It was simply a tough case (for the jury),'' Horton said.
``This should put to rest the incident at Marion.''
   Ann House, widow of the slain officer, attended the nine-day
trial.
   ``What was missing in this trial about the killing of Lt. Fred
House was Fred as a real person. He was and still is a model of
character, of responsible behavior,'' she wrote in a statement
following the verdict.
   Mrs. House, whose husband had four black belts in karate, said:
``His students and fellow workers respected this dedication, loyalty
and team support. The Singer-Swapp affair is such a contrast in
values.''

   A police counterinsurgency unit active
in the war against pro-independence guerrillas will be disbanded as
a goodwill gesture following the agreement to end South African rule
over Namibia, a police official said today.
   The unit, with a reputation for tough and sometimes controversial
tactics, is known as Koevoet _ the Afrikaans word for ``crowbar.''
   Chief Inspector Kierie du Rand said the unit would be phased out
gradually starting April 1, the beginning of a seven-month
transition process leading to elections for a Naimibian national
assembly.
   Koevoet members have been involved in numerous court cases over
the years related to allegations of brutality against black
civilians in the northern war zone. Authorities have declined to
disclose the number of men serving in the multiracial unit, but
Foreign Minister Pik Botha of South Africa said Thursday that
overall police strength in Namibia would be reduced from 8,300 to
7,000.
   Botha was speaking at a news conference after joining Angolan and
Cuban officials in signing agreements at the United Nations to bring
about independence in Namibia and remove Cuban troops from
neighboring Angola.
   Koevoet played a principal role in countering incursions by
Angola-based insurgents of the South-West African People's
Organization, which began a bush war against South African rule in
1966.
   SWAPO is favored to win the Nov. 1 elections, but it is likely to
be opposed by a multiracial coalition of parties participating in
the current, South African-installed transitional government.
   Dirk Mudge, a white moderate who serves on the transitional
Cabinet, today urged an active campaign to ``ensure that political
power remains in responsible hands.'' He said there should be no
turning back from the United Nations' independence plan, known as
Resolution 435.
   ``In spite of all the risks that may be involved in the
implementation of Resolution 435, the failure of the peace effort
will have serious, even disastrous, consequences that may include
military confrontation,'' he said.
   South Africa's defense minister, Gen. Magnus Malan, told
reporters in New York that South Africa, under the agreement signed
Thursday, would halt military assistance to UNITA _ the pro-Western
rebel movement fighting Angola's Marxist government.
   However, Malan said South Africa would maintain a friendly
relationship with UNITA and also expected Angola to close African
National Congress guerrilla bases on its territory. The ANC wages a
bombing and sabotage campaign in South Africa aimed at undermining
the white-controlled government.
   ``Should the Cubans launch a new offensive against UNITA, South
Africa would not sit back with folded arms,'' Malan said.
   SWAPO, in a statement issued in Luanda, Angola, and reported by
the Mozambican news agency AIM, hailed Thursday's agreement as a
milestone but criticized proposals by Western countries to reduce by
more than half the planned 7,500-member U.N. monitoring force for
Namibia.
   SWAPO said the smaller force would be unable to monitor the
movements of South African military and police units, including
Koevoet, which is described as ``internationally famed for its
atrocities.''
   SWAPO said South Africa would try to use these security forces
``to create a climate of intimidation and insecurity and thereby to
influence the outcome of the Namibian independence elections in
favor of its surrogates.''

   A consumer boycott launched by
blacks to protest the revival of municipal segregation laws caused
huge Christmas-season losses for merchants in Boksburg, a local
business leader said today.
   Johan Viljoen, chairman of the Boksburg Chamber of Commerce,
estimated that shopowners lost more than $420,000 during a four-week
boycott protesting the reinstatement of ``whites only'' status at
parks and other public facilities.
   Many businesses in the industrial town east of Johannesburg would
be unable to recover their losses and some were likely to close
soon, Viljoen said in a telephone interview. Sales at some clothing
and furniture stores were down by as much as 80 percent, he said.
   The resegregation campaign was undertaken by town council members
of the far-right Conservative Party, who gained power in Boksburg
and dozens of other municipalities in Oct. 26 election.
   Residents of black and mixed-race communities neighboring
Boksburg _ who outnumber the 85,000 white residents by more than
3-to-1 _ said they would grant the town council its wish for a
``White Christmas'' by staying out of the central business district.
   On Thursday, developers of a $11 million shopping mall planned
for Boksburg announced the project was shelved because of the city's
bad business climate.
   The major tenant would have been the OK Bazaar retail company.
Its chief executive, Gordon Hood, said business at his company's
existing store in Boksburg had declined by 49 percent in the past
month.
   A week ago, developers of another proposed shopping mall for
Boksburg announced that their plans were being shelved until
conditions in the town ``return to normal.''
   The Boksburg council thus far has refused to back down, despite
intense criticism from the government and local business groups.
   The Conservatives have accused the government of hypocrisy and
challenged President P.W. Botha's National Party to repeal the
Separate Amenities Act, which allows local officials to segregate
public amenities. The government thus far has made no move to repeal
the law and has not pushed for integration of whites-only facilities
in towns controlled by National Party councils.
   ``The whole thing has been ripped out of proportion by the
misinformation campaign of the media,'' said a Conservative Party
leader, Koos van der Merwe.
   ``Our promises were made within the Separate Amenities Act and
the voters knew what they were voting for.''

   Assailants believed to be Basque
separatists fired grenades at a Civil Guard barracks in northern
Spain today and bombed a convoy near another northern town. At least
three men were wounded, police said.
   A police spokesman said at least two officers were hurt when a
four-vehicle Civil Guard convoy was bombed on a highway near the
northern Basque town of Areta, six miles south of the port of Bilbao.
   The spokesman said a passerby also was believed hurt.
   The blast came about eight hours after assailants launched a
rocket-propelled grenade attack on a Civil Guard barracks outside
Alsasua after apparently planting booby traps in the area, a Civil
Guard spokesman said. Asusua is in the Navarre region that borders
the northern Basque country.
   One Civil Guard officer was seriously injured when he tripped a
booby-trap bomb, said the spokesman, who was not identified in
keeping with custom. At least two other hidden bombs failed to
detonate and two were defused, he said.
   No group immediately claimed responsibility for the attacks, but
police said both bore the earmarks of ETA, the Basque separatist
organization.
   The group has carried out a 20-year violent campaign in an effort
to secure independence from Spain for the three-province northern
Basque region and to seek annexation of the bordering autonomous
region of Navarre.
   Alsasua lies on the border with the Basque region, 30 miles east
of Pamplona, the Navarre region's capital.
   A spokesman at Pamplona's University Clinic hospital said the
booby-trap blast blew away parts of both legs of guard Jose Aguilar
Garcia, 26.
   In another development, a gunman believed to be an ETA member
killed Thursday the owner of a bar in Zarauz, a town in the Basque
province of Guizpuzcoa. Authorities called the shooting of
Engraciano Gonzalez Macho, 42, ``a clear ETA attack,'' adding that
the gunman was believed to be the same man who triggered a car bomb
Sunday that killed a policeman and injured 12 people in Eibar, 25
miles east of San Sebastian.
   Since 1968, ETA has claimed responsibility for killing more than
600 people, mainly Civil Guard, police and military officers.
   So far this year ETA-claimed attacks have killed 17 people.
   ETA is an acronym in the Basque language for Homeland and Liberty.

<HEAD>Studies: Seat Belt Laws Reduce Accident Injuries, Deaths, Hospital
Costs</HEAD>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Seat belt laws dramatically reduce serious
injuries and deaths, and accident victims who didn't buckle up had
medical bills three times higher than those who did, researchers
reported today.
   The two studies, which examined traffic accidents in Chicago and
North Carolina, were published in the Journal of the American
Medical Association.
   In the North Carolina study of nearly 100,000 people involved in
accidents from 1983 to 1987, researchers found that after seat belt
legislation was enacted _ and especially after fines were imposed _
the number of deaths or serious injuries dropped dramatically.
   The second study examined 1,364 accident victims taken to trauma
units of four Chicago-area hospitals. When the victims wore safety
belts, hospital admissions decreased nearly 65 percent and related
costs dropped 66 percent.
   ``Safety belts turn out to be an economical way of trying to
reduce that health care dollar,'' said Dr. Elizabeth Orsay of the
University of Illinois-Chicago. She was primary author of the cost
study.
   Thirty-one states and the District of Columbia have seat belt
laws.
   The North Carolina study estimated that the state may have 1,100
fewer severe and fatal highway injuries each year as a result of
mandatory seat belt use.
   ``What the study suggests is that each and every state could
benefit from seat belt laws with primary enforcement,'' said Dr.
Donald Reinfurt of the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, a
co-author of the study.
   Primary enforcement, part of North Carolina's law, means police
may stop a vehicle if the occupants aren't wearing seat belts. Other
states with primary enforcement laws include Connecticut, Hawaii,
Iowa, New York, New Mexico and Texas.
   North Carolina passed a law requiring seat belt use by front-seat
occupants in 1985 and began imposing a $25 fine in 1987, the year a
second study by the university found the state had the highest rate
of seat belt use in the country.
   While the number of front-seat passengers in traffic accidents
rose from 1983 through 1987, the percentage of serious or fatal
injuries dropped significantly after the law was passed and again
when the fines were imposed.
   In 1985, 4.7 percent of 19,385 front-seat passengers involved in
accidents died or suffered severe injuries. In 1986, the figure was
4.4 percent of 20,603. In 1987, it was 3.8 percent of 21,752 victims.
   The Chicago study showed that the average cost of treating
accident victims who were wearing seat belts was $534 against $1,583
for those who didn't buckle up.
   Mandatory seat belt use would significantly decrease the
financial burden on the public, Ms. Orsay said.
   ``We looked at who was paying for these costs, and a majority of
people not wearing safety belts either had no insurance or were on
public assistance of some sort,'' she said.

<TEXT>
   A mysterious self-styled Santa in a Cadillac
made an appearance at a soup kitchen for the seventh year in a row,
lavishing Christmas cheer on the down and out in the form of crisp
$10 bills.
   The middle-aged, gray-haired man arrived unannounced Thursday at
the Midnight Mission.
   ``It's really very touching. He gives everyone a $10 bill and a
warm smile, and 35 minutes later he's through _ with $6,000 left
behind,'' said Clancy Imislund, spokesman for the mission.
   Imislund figured the well-dressed Cadillac Santa has given away
more than $30,000 over the years.
   The man clears the gift-giving with the mission's directors, but
nobody knows exactly when he's coming. His name and occupation are
not known, but his new Cadillac always has dealer plates.
   ``I figure he owns a dealership. So I say to him, `Why don't you
go public with this?''' Imislund said. ``He just says, `I'll tell
you what. If I publicized this it would help my company, but it
would keep me from having the pleasure of doing something I want to
do.'''
   More than 500 people were in the mission when the Santa and his
two helpers arrived to a burst of applause. He worked the room,
stuffing bills in everyone's pocket and shaking hands with grateful
beneficiaries.
   Many of the homeless went straight to a liquor store.
   The Cadillac Santa ``just says this is a Christmas present and he
doesn't want to tell anybody what to do with it,'' Imislund said.
   ``One old guy said, `I should buy a drink,''' Imislund said.
``But instead he asks me for an envelope and stamp so he can send
the money to his kid in Louisiana.''

   When Samuel Skinner was an assistant U.S.
attorney, says Illinois Gov. James Thompson, he didn't quite fit
into the ``velvet hammer'' school of prosecutors. Instead, Thompson
recalls, ``he was just a hammer.''
   Skinner, 50, once Thompson's top deputy and the man who succeeded
him as U.S. attorney in Chicago, was named by President-elect Bush
on Thursday to become secretary of transportation.
   Skinner headed Bush's presidential campaigns in Illinois both in
1980 and this year, and since 1984 has been chairman of the Regional
Transportation Authority of Northeastern Illinois, the nation's
second-largest transportation system.
   But the nickname ``Sam the Hammer,'' earned in those
corruption-busting days with Thompson in the 1970s, still follows
him.
   ``Usually you call someone a velvet hammer,'' Thompson said in a
recent interview. ``There was no velvet encasing Skinner.''
   ``He is very aggressive, and very determined to succeed in
whatever he does,'' Thompson said.
   ``Personally, I find him to be one of the brightest and most
hard-working individuals I've come across in government,'' said
Gregory Baise, Illinois tranportation director.
   ``What he will bring is an ability to bring to President Bush a
coherent agenda ... for a national infrastructure plan,'' Baise said.
   From the other side of the political aisle, Sen. Alan Dixon,
D-Ill., said: ``He's an absolutely honorable man of the deepest
personal integrity ... a very responsive person. He's an easy man to
deal with.''
   But Skinner, who is also a senior partner in the Chicago law
office of Sidley & Austin, has drawn fire from Sen. Howard
Metzenbaum, D-Ohio.
   Metzenbaum said Wednesday the Senate should not vote to confirm
Skinner without investigating ``why (he) failed to pursue
allegations of fraudulent testing of NutraSweet,'' the artificial
sweetener, against the G.D. Searle Co. _ and later joined the firm
that defended Searle in the case.
   Skinner's office issued a statement saying he ``conducted himself
in accordance with Department of Justice guidelines in the matter
mentioned by Sen. Metzenbaum.''
   Skinner served as first assistant U.S. attorney in Chicago from
1968 to 1975, and became Thompson's trusted friend. They hatched the
idea for the office's Special Investigations Division, and Thompson
made Skinner the division's first chief.
   Skinner built a reputation for toughness during one of Illinois'
biggest federal corruption trials: the bribery case of former Gov.
Otto Kerner, who was convicted in 1973.
   He is a two-time recipient of the Department of Justice
Outstanding Service Award.
   Skinner's current agency funnels federal and state money to local
transit agencies and oversees the Chicago Transit Authority, which
operates city buses and suways; suburban bus systems; and commuter
trains that run between Chicago and the suburbs.
   Skinner ``really runs, with the help of his board, a first class
transit system,'' Thompson said.
   In 1975, when Thompson left the office for the governor's chair,
Skinner was appointed U.S. attorney by President Ford.
   In 1983, he was appointed by President Reagan to the President's
Commission on Organized Crime, which he served as vice chairman.
   Skinner received an undergraduate degree in accounting from the
University of Illinois in 1960.
   He served in the U.S. Army and earned a law degree from DePaul
University in Chicago in 1966. Skinner, who was born in Springfield,
Ill., is married and has three children.

   Arizona's death penalty law is
unconstitutional, a federal appeals court ruled, giving new hope to
about 85 condemned prisoners.
   The 7-4 ruling Thursday by the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
reversed a death sentence in the 1976 car-bombing murder of a
Phoenix newspaper reporter.
   The ruling found that the death penalty law violated the right to
a jury trial by letting the trial judge decide whether a murder was
a capital crime. The court also said the law improperly required the
defendant to justify leniency and did not allow consideration of all
pertinent evidence favoring leniency.
   If it stands, the ruling would overturn all death sentences
issued in Arizona since the law was passed in 1973.
   In a separate 6-5 vote, the court ruled that even if the law had
been valid, John Adamson's death sentence was improper because the
sentencing judge had previously ruled that a prison sentence was
appropriate for the murder, and imposed a death sentence only after
Adamson violated a plea agreement requiring him to testify against
two other men.
   It was the second time the court overturned the death sentence of
Adamson, who admitted planting the bomb in June 1976 that killed Don
Bolles, an investigative reporter for The Arizona Republic. The
Supreme Court reversed the first ruling and reinstated Adamson's
death sentence last year.
   Arizona Attorney General Bob Corbin said he would appeal
Adamson's case to the high court, and denounced the appeals court.
   ``You cannot get a death penalty case through the 9th Circuit
Court of Appeals ... because the majority of the judges are
anti-death penalty,'' Corbin said.
   Timothy Foley, one of Adamson's lawyers, said the ruling affirms
the right to have a jury decide a defendant's fate, ``rather than a
judge who's subject to retention elections and political pressure.''

   A letter carrier accused of hoarding five
tons of mostly junk mail at his home faces up to 10 years in prison
at sentencing Feb. 7.
   William E. Ryan of Milton, a 15-year postal employee, pleaded
guilty Wednesday to two counts of obstructing mail delivery.
Prosecutors dropped eight other counts in exchange. The charges also
carry fines of up to $500,000.
   The mail, mostly advertising circulars, give-away offers,
magazines, free samples and other bulk mail, was discovered in his
home, in a shed and scattered in woods nearby. Some of the mail was
two to three years old.
   ``He didn't come in to explain,'' said Pensacola Postmaster Ben
Jasek. ``He didn't appeal (his firing), nothing.''
   Officials used a front-end loader to scoop up the mail, some of
it wet and moldy and beyond delivery.

   A crack cocaine addict was so desperate to be
treated for his drug dependency that he smashed the windows at two
police stations to draw attention to himself, officials say.
   ``This case smacks you in the face because here is a guy who
obviously wanted to be helped,'' said Criminal Court Judge John
Moore, who helped the addict, Alexis Vega, 34, to get treatment.
   ``This case dramatizes the critical need for treatment upon
demand for all individuals addicted to drugs,'' said Bronx District
Attorney Paul Gentile.
   Vega's efforts to find treatment began after his wife and
8-month-old son left him last summer, according to accounts today in
the New York Post and The New York Times.
   First, he visited hospitals and treatment centers, but was told
there was no room.
   Gentile and police confirmed that on one occasion the man spoke
to the desk sergeant at a station house in the Williamsbridge
section of the Bronx.
   ``I told him I had a problem and was seeking some help,'' Vega
said. ``I could see they weren't going to arrest me or help. So I
reached into my pockets and pulled out some stuff and put it on the
desk, right in front of them.''
   A hypodermic needle and two empty crack vials was enough to shock
the officers, he said.
   ``They grabbed me, roughed me up a little, put the handcuffs on a
little too tight, the usual stuff,'' Vega said.
   But when he was brought before a judge on misdemeanor charges, he
was freed and his pleas to be enrolled in a treatment program were
ignored, he said.
   Finally, breaking the windows at two police stations got him
thrown into jail, into Moore's courtroom and finally into a
treatment program after the judge made a call on his behalf.
   Luis Sierra, a staff member for the center's operator, the Way
Out Church Ministries Inc., said Vega had ``lucked out.''
   ``We have a capacity of 58 men and a waiting list of 600 and
there was one vacancy left when the judge called me,'' he said.

   Nikolaas Tinbergen, a Dutch-born British
zoologist who won the Nobel Prize for Medicine in 1973, has died of
an apparent stroke, his widow said today. He was 81.
   Elizabeth A. Rutten said in a telephone interview that her
husband of 56 years had ``quite reasonably recovered'' from a first
stroke in 1983. He died Wednesday shortly after apparently suffering
another stroke at his Oxford home.
   Born in The Hague in 1907, Tinbergen studied at universities in
Leiden in the Netherlands, in Vienna, Austria, and at Yale
University.
   He gained prominence in the late 1930s as one of the founders of
ethology, the branch of biology that studies animal behavior. During
World War II, he was detained by the occupying German forces at a
detention camp in the Netherlands.
   After a pre-war spell with Konrad Lorenz, the noted German
zoologist, he was appointed professor of experimental zoology at
Leiden University in 1947.
   Two years later, he became an ethology lecturer at Oxford
University, where he wrote ``The Study of Instinct,'' considered the
first handbook on ethology ever published. He was a professor in
animal behavior at Oxford from 1966 to 1974, and a professor
emeritus there until his death.
   Tinbergen, who became a British citizen in 1955, was a prolific
writer and an accomplished maker of nature films.
   He shared the 1973 Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine with
Lorenz and Austrian zoologist Karl von Frisch for their
``discoveries in the field of the organization and occurrence of
individual and social behavioral patterns'' in the animal world.
   The 1973 prize was a new departure for the Nobel committee,
acknowledging for the first time major advances in man's
understanding of sociobiology, especially in the behavioral science
known as ethology.
   ``At one stroke, they (the three laureates) explained some of the
most remarkable examples of the fine control of elaborate patterns
of behavior by external stimuli known to science, sometimes learned,
sometimes not, while leaving in no doubt the crucial importance of
genetic differences in understanding the development of behavior,''
the British magazine Science said of their award.
   Tinbergen's elder brother, Jan, won the first-ever Nobel Prize
for Economics in 1969.
   Tinbergen is survived by his widow, two sons and three daughters.

   An agency is spending $70,000 on awnings, flags
and other improvements to dress up dilapidated buildings for
convention visitors, but neighborhood leaders say the city should
worry more about substance than image.
   The Downtown Development Authority, funded by the city and
special taxes on businesses, is paying for the cosmetic changes to
three buildings prior to the North American International Auto Show
in early January.
   ``You always open yourself up to criticism because if these
buildings were viable and occupied this wouldn't be necessary,''
said Alex Pollock, a city planner who worked on the trimmings. ``But
if the city is going to hope to get this (auto) show repeated, we
have to make a sincere effort to correct some of the less
presentable parts of downtown.''
   The abandoned Tuller and Heritage hotels and Detroit Metropolitan
Building near Detroit's Grand Circus Park echo better days with new
awnings over blank windows, spruced up entrance canopies, paint
jobs, flags and banners. The new fixings will not be taken down
after the convention.
   Neighborhood leaders say the money could be better spent.
   ``All that glitters isn't gold,'' said Cheryl Allen, an officer
of the Michigan Avenue Community Organization. ``That $70,000 used
in our neighborhood would probably (rehabilitate) five complete
homes, top to bottom. Then you would have five families in liveable
homes and looking at a future here.''

   Two police officers accused of forcing a drug
dealer to eat 20 pieces of crack have been ordered to stand trial on
assault charges.
   Ricardo Darbins, 22, and Cedric Scott, 27, were also charged
along with six fellow officers with conspiracy and entry without
permission. They were accused of breaking into crack houses without
a warrant in order to terrorize occupants.
   ``I certainly have no sympathy for dope dealers,'' District Judge
R. Patrick Donahue said Thursday after a preliminary hearing. But he
said the officers tried to do ``something legal in an illegal way.''
   Steven Johnson, 26, testified that officers with guns drawn broke
into his house, where he had 20 bags of crack on a living room
table, and forced him to eat cocaine. He testified one officer said,
``I'm going to make you addicted to crack.''
   A witness in an apartment across the hall testified to
overhearing someone say, ``Eat this. ... If you don't I'll take you
to jail,'' followed by laughter.
   Johnson was treated at a hospital for an overdose. Prosecutors
said he may have saved his life after the police left by drinking
vinegar to induce vomiting.
   The alleged unreported raids on crack houses were made just
before dawn on Feb. 21.
   Defense attorneys said the action resulted from frustation in the
battle against the city's drug trade. ``When police officers start
playing it very, very, very safe, the city becomes very unsafe,''
said Thomas Howard, Scott's attorney.
   The eight officers have been suspended without pay since August
and are free on $10,000 bail each. Darbins and Scott face up to 15\
years in prison if convicted; the rest could receive up to 5\ years.

   Soldiers, police and prison guards today
surrounded a penitentiary in northwestern Mexico where inmates
killed two people, wounded four and were holding 15 people hostage,
officials said.
   The inmates may have rioted because they were denied Christmas
pardons.
   About 10 inmates got hold of firearms and attacked the prison
director's office Thursday, killing the director and an unidentified
person and wounding four people during a shootout with guards, said
Dante Salazar.
   Salazar, a spokesman for the Nayagit state attorney's office,
said the inmates were holding 15 people hostages.
   The inmates allowed Red Cross personnel in part of the prison to
remove the victims, said police spokesman Antonio Villasenor by
telephone.
   ``The situation in there is very tense,'' Villasenor said.
   Salazar said he heard the rioting inmates were protesting because
the Gov. Celso Delgado had not included them in a list of prisoners
who received Christmas pardons for good conduct.
   Delgado today negotiated with the inmates by telephone from
outside the Venustiano Carranza penitentiary in the city of Tepic,
500 miles northwest of Mexico City. Soldiers, police and guards
encircled the the prison.
   Salazar said others in the 1,200-inmate prison probably joined
the riot, but he did not know how many. Rodolfo Leon, the state
attorney general, was quoted by reporters as saying a number of
visitors, relatives and administrative personnel were among the
hostages.
   Delgado talked by telephone with the inmates today in an effort
to persuade them to free the hostages, said a state security
official who demanded anonymity. The source said the inmates were
offered an armored car so they could leave safely, but they rejected
it.
   ``We don't know exactly what they want,'' he said.
   Hector Batista, a volunteer, said he and a Red Cross team went
into the prison today, retrieved the two bodies and took them to the
local morgue, then went in again to pick up the injured.
   ``We went in the first time to take out the dead, they (the
mutineers) were very nice. But the second time, they almost didn't
let us go out,'' he said.
   Batista said there were about 10 rioters, three of them armed
with firearms, and the rest with knives, homemade blunt weapons and
clubs.
   Salazar identified one victim as prison director Samuel Alvarado.
He said the other person killed has not been yet identified but
could be the prison director's secretary.

   The body of a 3-year-old girl was found

Georgia, but her identity remains a mystery.
   An autopsy Thursday at the State Crime Lab showed the child had
been dead one to two months when she was found Wednesday by a
curious timber worker in woods about 35 miles north of the Florida
border, said Sheriff Herbert E. Bond.
   Pathologists were continuing work today to determine the cause of
death.
   ``They were able to tell us she had not been shot or stabbed,''
Bond said.
   The child had been wrapped in a blanket and stuffed inside a gym
bag, which was then placed in a suitcase. The suitcase was sealed
with concrete, and placed in an abandoned TV console.
   The timber worker found the body when he spotted the suitcase and
opened it out of curiosity, police said.
   There are no small children who are known to be missing in the
area, Bond said.

   Pope John Paul II met with PLO leader Yasser
Arafat today for 20 minutes and expressed hope the Israelis and
Palestinians would soon begin negotiations leading to peace in the
Middle East.
   It was the second meeting between the pope and the Palestine
Liberation Organization chairman in six years.
   The Vatican said in a statement after the meeting, ``The pope
expressed his hope that both peoples (Israelis and Palestinians)
would soon see the beginning of a real process of understanding and
of peace, which would put an end finally to their suffering and
their fears.
   ``The holy father reiterated that he was profoundly convinced
that the two peoples had an identical fundamental right to their own
homelands in which they could live in liberty, dignity and security,
in harmony with the neighboring peoples.''
   The statement added that the pope said ``only a concrete effort
and a sincere willingness to understand each other would produce
progress on the road toward peace and justice.''
   Vatican spokesman Joaquin Navarro said Arafat filled in the pope
on the latest developments in the Middle East. However, he declined
to provide specifics.
   Arafat spoke in Arabic during the 20-minute session in the pope's
library and was accompanied by Farouk Kaddoumi, head of the PLO's
political department and three other PLO representatives.
   The pope was accompanied by a translator.
   Reporters were not admitted.
   Arafat presented the pope with a wood carving of the nativity
scene, and the pope gave Arafat a book about the Vatican.
   Israel and Jewish groups were angered by the pope's agreement to
meet with Arafat in 1982. In an account of the meeting, held in a
small room of the Paul VI Auditorium, the Vatican said the pope
called for a Palestinian homeland, respect for Israel's security and
an end to terrorism.
   The Vatican, which maintains diplomatic relations with 117
countries, does not have formal ties with Israel, although the pope
has received Israeli leaders. The Vatican says the lack of relations
is due to Israel's unsettled boundaries and the problem of the
Palestinians. It also does not have relations with Jordan.
   John Paul has spoken out several times this year on the plight of
the Palestinians, who have staged a violent yearlong uprising in
Israel's occupied territories.
   Arafat is touring Europe seeking support for an international
Middle East peace conference and the independent Palestinian state
proclaimed Nov. 15 by the PLO's parliament-in-exile in Algeria.
   Italy is the first NATO member on Arafat's European itinerary.
   Today's audience took place after Arafat met with Premier Ciriaco
De Mita and Foreign Minister Giulio Andreotti at the premier's
office in downtown Rome.
   Andreotti said the meeting ``confirmed the moderate line'' taken
by the PLO, an umbrella for several Palestinian groups, including
Arafat's Fatah.
   He said Arafat gave ``a very positive evaluation'' of the
dialogue that the United States and the PLO initiated last week in
Tunis, Tunisia. The U.S. administration ended a 13-year ban on
contacts with the PLO after Arafat said the organization renounced
terrorism, recognized Israel's right to exist and accepted key U.N.
resolutions on the Middle East peace process.
   Andreotti said Arafat did not ask Italy to recognize an
independent Palestinian state.
   A communique from De Mita's office said Italy remains favorable
to an international peace conference on the Middle East.

   Foreign Minister Moshe Arens today linked the
crash of a Pan Am jet in Scotland to Palestinian factions. An
Israeli newspaper and terror experts blamed Syrian-backed radical
groups opposed to the U.S.-PLO talks.
   The daily English-language newspaper The Nation quoted
unidentified Western intelligence sources as saying the
Syrian-backed Ahmed Jibril group was responsible. It said
investigators believed that at least one person aboard could be
identified as belonging to Jibril's Popular Front for the Liberation
of Palestine-General Command group.
   Israeli officials bitterly opposed the U.S. decision earlier this
month to open a dialogue with the Palestine Liberation Organization
after its chief, Yasser Arafat, renounced terrorism and recognized
Israel's right to exist.
   On Thursday, a senior PLO official, Mahmoud Abbas, said in Cairo,
Egypt, that it was ``nonsensical'' to link Palestinians to the crash.
   In a report from London today, a correspondent for Israel radio's
English service said passengers aboard the Pan Am plane included two
members of a secret U.S. State Department team returning from
Lebanon where they had negotiated for the release of American
hostages.
   A State Department official in Washington said today that two
Americans on the plane were involved in diplomatic security, one at
the U.S. Embassy in Nicosia, Cyprus, and another at the U.S. Embassy
in Beirut, Lebanon, and two other diplomats from the Beirut embassy.
   The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, denied that
two of the Americans had been involved in talks on American hostages.
   Arens, interviewed in Hebrew on Israel radio, said that ``based
on our assumptions, and those of our experts, this is an operation
of international terror, apparently Arab international terror.''
   Arens attacked the U.S.-PLO dialogue, saying ``such steps would
only strenghten the wave of terror and encourage terror groups and
activities.''
   Israel radio said two Israelis died in the crash, and Israel had
sent a top police official to London to assist in the investigation.
   Ariel Merari, a senior researcher in terrorism at Tel Aviv
University's Jaffee Center for Strategic Studies, said the attack
was apparently staged to block the U.S.-PLO talks.
   ``Radical Palestinian factions, who declared Arafat a traitor,
are the most likely candidates,'' Merari said in an interview.
``They likely had Syrian or Libyan backing.''
   He said Palestinian groups were ``responsible for half of the
mid-air plane bombings in the last 20 years'' and said Jibril's
group in particular had a ``rich history'' of such attacks.
   He said Jibril's followers were linked to the Feb. 21, 1970,
downing of Swissair plane by a in-flight explosion, and on the same
day unsuccessfully attempted to blow up an Austrian airlines plane.
   In 1971 and 1972, Jibril guerrillas made three attempts to
detonate a bomb in Israel's El-Al planes, two in Rome and one in
London. In one case, the bomb was hidden in a record player.
   ``They usually use naive carriers, people who don't suspect. In
the case of Jibril, female tourists were befriended by Jibril's men
and asked to take a parcel to Israel,'' he said.
   Merari noted that a ``barometer bomb,'' which is equipped with an
altitude-sensitive detonator and activated by air pressure, was
found concealed in a radio when 13 Palestinians were detained in
October during raids in West Germany. Officials there said the
suspects belonged to Jibril's group.
   The Nation said that the leader of the Jibril cell in West
Germany, Hafez Kassem Khalkamony, told his interrogators the group
planned attacks on civilian aircraft. A similar report was carried
by Israel Television's military correspondent Thursday.
   The paper quoted West German intelligence sources as saying they
believe a Jibril guerrilla boarded the Pan Am plane in Frankfurt.
   It said the man board the plane ``with a briefcase packed with
Syrian-supplied explosives that cannot be detected by routine
security methods'' and fled when the flight was in transit in
London, leaving the briefcase behind.
   Meanwhile, the head of the Israeli Pilots Association Yitzhak
Gonen said he warned the London-based International Pilots
Association in a telephone call earlier this month about a possible
attack by radical Palestinians.
   ``I spoke with them a day after the U.S. decision to start talks
with Arafat (Dec. 15) and warned them that we may expect an increase
in attacks by groups opposing these talks,'' Gonen said. ``It was a
general warning, because I did not have any precise information.''

<HEAD>Bush Office Confirms Son And Grandson Of President-Elect To Go To
Armenia</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President-elect Bush's son and grandson will
travel to Soviet Armenia on Christmas Day to help distribute
American aid to earthquake victims, Bush's office confirmed today.
   In Moscow, Soviet Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady I. Gerasimov
told the official Tass news agency that John E. Bush and George P.
Bush ``will participate in a ceremony of transferring to Armenia
relief aid from the United States.''
   Jeb Bush, 35, a Miami real estate developer, and his son, George,
12, will spend about six hours in Yerevan, the Armenian capital, on
Christmas Day, said the transition office. They leave New York on
Saturday, arriving in the Soviet Union on Christman morning.
   The Bushes are traveling to Armenia as volunteers for Americares,
a relief agency that has chartered a DC-8 cargo plane to transport
supplies to the region.
   The aid will include medicine, medical equipment and toys from
the Americares charity for children who survived the Dec. 7 quake,
which killed at least 55,000 people, Tass said.
   Steve Norman, an Americares spokesman, said the Bushes are among
three people on the flight.
   Norman said the Bushes will only stay a few hours because of time
restrictions imposed by the Soviets. ``They are not allowing people
to stay much longer than that because of congestion at the
airport,'' he said.
   The plane will return to the United States after a brief layover
in Cologne, Germany, Norman said.

   A West German official said today
that police discovered an air pressure-activated bomb during the
October arrests of suspected radical Palestinians, but he emphasized
it was too soon to say whether there was any connection to the crash
of a Pan Am jet.
   ``It's pure speculation,'' said Alexander Prechtel, spokesman for
the chief federal prosecutor's office. The bomb is set off by a drop
in air pressure, such as those occurring in the luggage compartment
of an airplane, he said.
   New York-bound Pan Am Flight 103 originated in Frankfurt and
landed in London, where passengers changed from a Boeing 727 to the
ill-fated Boeing 747.
   Wednesday's crash in Scotland, which killed 258 people on board
and at least 22 people on the ground, apparently occurred after the
plane broke up for an unknown reason at an altitude of 31,000 feet.
   The Neue Presse newspaper of Frankfurt reported today on alleged
lapses in security checks at Frankfurt airport. The newspaper quoted
an unidentified expert as saying it's ``problem-free to smuggle a
bomb on board.''
   ``If the explosives and detonator are taken on board separately,
it's all child's play,'' the newspaper quoted the expert as saying.
   The paper quoted an unidentified baggage handler as saying that
not every bag is subjected to an X-ray scan, and that only random
samplings are made.
   Wolfgang Schwalm, the spokesman for the airport, declined comment
on the report, noting that security is handled by Hesse state
officials. The Associated Press called the office of security chief
Horst Harnstein, and was told he was not available to talk.
   But on Thursday, Hans Neusel, the No. 2 official in the federal
Interior Ministry, strongly defended security at Frankfurt airport.
   Arno Falk, a spokesman for the federal police office in
Wiesbaden, told The Associated Press that West German investigators
were checking details of the crash and were in contact with
investigators in London.
   Since the crash, there have been growing indications the flight
was sabotaged.
   In London, the Independent newspaper today quoted a security
source as saying investigators were taking ``very seriously'' a
pro-Iranian group's letter that it was responsible for the crash.
   However, Prechtel brought up the issue of 13 Palestinians rounded
up in a series of raids in West Germany in October. Three were later
arrested, while the others were set free but remain under
investigation.
   Prechtel said in a telephone interview that the arrested suspects
belonged to the Popular Front for the Liberation of
Palestine-General Command.
   ``They have said they planned attacks against U.S. interests,''
Prechtel said of the suspected Popular Front members.
   The suspects allegedly set up a terrorist cell of the Popular
Front in West Germany, authorities say. The Syrian-controlled
faction is opposed to the Palestine Liberation Organization leader,
Yasser Arafat, and is headed by Ahmad Jibril, a former Syrian army
captain.
   Prechtel said officers in the town of Neuss near Duesseldorf
found in a car used by one member of the group a bomb activated by a
drop in air pressure.
   ``Naturally, you can see a connection,'' Prechtel said when asked
whether members of the group could have been involved in the crash
of the Pan Am plane. ``They may have built several of these bombs.''
   He said the bomb that was discovered was hidden inside a radio,
thus making it difficult to detect.

   Police have arrested a suspect in the slaying of a
barber who was shot to death by a customer upset over his haircut.
   Paul Williams, 34, of Aurora, was picked up Wednesday night in
the investigation into the death of Bobbie D. Willis, said Detective
John Wyckoff. No charges were immediately filed.
   Willis, 47, was killed Saturday at his Barber Bob's Barber Shop
by a man who was angry about the haircut the barber gave him.
   The man refused to pay and grew so angry that police were
summoned to the barber shop. The man paid $9 and left, but returned
with a pistol and opened fire on Willis as he was calling police for
help, authorities and witnesses said.
   Police had said the gunman was slender, in his 20s with very
short hair and a 3-inch, crescent-shape scar on the back of his
head. Williams matched that description.

<HEAD>Court Upholds Convictions of Rebellious Officers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal appeals court convicted
seven retired air force officers for attempting to take over an
airport following an army insurrection in January.
   The three-member court rejected the officers' arguments that they
tried to seize Jorge Newberry Airport to prevent a civil war. One
officer testified that they wanted to stop an air force attack on
rebellious army units at Monte Caseros, 310 miles northeast of the
capital.
   The army units later surrendered.
   Thursday's decision by the appeals court came after the nation's
highest military tribunal convicted the seven of mutiny and
sentenced them.
   The appeals court convicted the men on the more serious charge of
aggravated rebellion. Most received stiffer sentences.
   Under Argentine law, the appeals court can rule on any charges or
assign its own penalties independent of lower or military court
rulings.
   Retired Col. Luis Estrella's sentence of 12 years was upheld,
while the sentences of Lt. Cols. Horacio Ricciardelli, Juan Carlos
Puy and Angel Lavella were increased to 11 years each.
   Under the military tribunal, Puy had received an eight-year
sentence, and Lavella and Ricciardelli seven years each.
   Lt. Col. Ernesto Lynch, Maj. Higinio Ribles and Capt. Antonio
Eduardo all received sentences of six years, eight months; as did
Godofredo Buschiazzo, an enlisted man in the navy.
   Ribles had originally received a seven-year sentence, and Lynch
and Eduardo received five years each. Buschiazzo's term was
increased from one to five years.
   Lt. Col. Antonio Magni, who had argued he did not participate in
the takeover, was acquitted. He had received a three-year sentence
from the military tribunal.
   The convicted servicemen will spend their terms in military
custody.
   On Jan. 18, about 20 rebels seized the control tower, forcing the
cancellation of some flights and the detour of others to Ezeiza
International Airport, the largest in this city of 10 million.
Rebels surrendered peacefully after four hours.
   Estrella told the court that he and the others acted to prevent
the air force attack against the rebels in Monte Caseros.
   ``On Jan. 18, the country was heading towards a civil war and
something had to be done to prevent the repression the air force was
ready to launch on the rebels,'' Estrella said.
   The army insurrection was led by Lt. Col. Aldo Rico, now
cashiered and imprisoned at an army garrison along with about 50 of
his followers. None have been brought to trial.
   Rico also led an uprising in April 1987 to protest the trial of
officers for human rights abuses stemming from the repression of
subversion under the 1976-83 military dictatorship.
   That same concern prompted a third uprising against the civilian
government of President Raul Alfonsin earlier this month.

   A Spanish soldier's souvenir grenade fuse
blew up in the cargo bay of a DC-9 passenger jet today minutes after
all passengers exited the plane, and officials said one person was
slightly injured.
   The small explosion caused little damage to the interior of the
jet operated by the Spanish domestic airline Aviaco, but a cargo
handler was slightly injured, said an airport spokesman who demanded
anonymity.
   ``Two Army soldiers on holiday leave from training in Palma de
Majorca brought back as souvenirs two low-powered fuses, or caps,
used to trigger rifle-fired anti-tank grenades during instruction,''
said Defense Ministry spokesman Pedro Meyer said. ``Although only
one of the fuses exploded, both soldiers acted in a completely
irresponsible way and contravened army rules in traveling with the
fuses.''
   Civil Guard officers at the airport arrested the two unidentified
soldiers and presented them before an examining magistrate in Madrid
District Court for possible charges, Meyer said.
   The Aviaco DC-9 arrived from Palma de Majorca in Spain's
Mediterranean Balearic Islands shortly before the blast, the airport
spokesman said.
   The fuse exploded when a cargo handler moved one of the soldier's
bags in the cargo bay, he said. The handler suffered a slight injury.

<HEAD>President-elect Has Only Two Cabinet Choices Remaining</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: INSERTS 2 grafs after 3rd graf, `I'm not,' to UPDATE with
Fuller quotes.</NOTE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President-elect Bush has nearly completed his
Cabinet with a flurry of surprise announcements, naming a black
educator, a conservationist, a retiring Hispanic lawmaker, a State
Department official and a transit expert to key jobs.
   Only two Cabinet positions _ at the departments of labor and
energy _ remain unfilled.
   ``I'm not sure when those announcements will be forthcoming, but
I would again say fairly soon,'' Bush said Thursday after he picked
five men for a variety of positions. So far he has named 12 Cabinet
members.
   Craig Fuller, co-director of Bush's transition, said it was
possible that Bush might name additional people to his Cabinet
today, and, ``If not, we'll wait until the first of the year.''
   Fuller, speaking on NBC-TV's ``Today Show,'' said transition
aides were talking to people about jobs on Thursday night, and again
today. Besides the labor and energy departments, Bush is looking for
his new drug czar, Fuller said.
   Among those mentioned as possible choices for labor secretary are
Patricia Diaz Dennis, a federal communications commissioner, and
Constance Horner, head of the Office of Personnel Management.
   In the running for the energy slot are former Louisiana Rep.
Henson Moore and Peter Johnson, former head of the Bonneville Power
Administration.
   Bush will be working in his office today, but he has no public
schedule. He plans to spend the Christmas weekend with his family at
the vice president's house before leaving Monday on a four-day
hunting and fishing trip to Texas and Alabama.
   Two of Bush's Cabinet choices, Dr. Louis Sullivan as secretary of
health and human services, and Samuel Skinner as head of the
Transportation Department, were expected in advance.
   Sullivan, 55, the president of Morehouse School of Medicine and
the first black chosen for the Cabinet, publicly reassured
anti-abortion activists that he opposes abortions except in cases of
rape, incest or when the life of the mother is threatened. He said
his views run parallel to Bush's on the issue.
   Sullivan's appointment ran into a roadblock earlier in the week
after he was quoted in a newspaper article saying he supported a
woman's right to have an abortion.
   On Thursday, Bush praised Sullivan's ``long and extremely
distinguished career.''
   Skinner, 50, a former prosecutor and head of the Regional
Transportation Authority of Northeastern Illinois, the second
largest transportation system in the nation, had been expected to
get the Bush administration job.
   Bush described Skinner as an ``effective and visionary
transportation leader.''
   The president-elect made three unexpected announcements, picking
retiring Rep. Manuel Lujan, R-N.M., to head the Interior Department;
former Illinois Rep. Edward J. Derwinski for veterans affairs, and
conservationist William Reilly as administrator of the Environmental
Protection Agency.
   The EPA does not have Cabinet status, though Bush said Reilly's
mission is one of ``tremendous importance,'' and he added: ``I
expect to be a very active president in protecting the environment.''
   The selection of Reilly, 48, a native of Decatur, Ill., who is
president of the Conservation Foundation and the U.S. affiliate of
the World Wildlife Fund, was cheered by environmentalists. ``A
brilliant choice,'' said Paul Pritchard, president of the National
Parks and Conservation Association.
   Reilly, a Harvard-trained lawyer, said he thought he was the
first conservationist selected for the EPA post.
   Former colleagues of Derwinski's said they were surprised by
Bush's pick but thought the undersecretary of state for security
assistance, science and technology would do a good job at the new
Department of Veterans Affairs.
   ``His name had never even surfaced,'' said Rep. G. V. Montgomery,
D-Miss., chairman of the House Veterans Affairs Committee.
   Derwinski, 62, a World War II veteran, knew Bush when the two
served in the House in the early 1970s. He lost his seat after
redistricting in 1982, and since then he has held a variety of jobs
at the State Department.
   Another unexpected move came when Bush selected Lujan, 60, for
interior secretary. A veteran of two decades in Congress, Lujan is
the second Hispanic in the Cabinet, joining Education Secretary
Lauro Cavazos of Texas.
   Lujan, who did not seek re-election, was a member of the House
Interior Committee and ranking Republican on the House Committee on
Science and Technology.
   Meantime, transition aides refused to comment on a report in The
Washington Times that Bush has picked Bruce Gelb, an executive of
Bristol Myer Co., as head of the U.S. Information Agency.
   In a question-and-answer session with reporters, Bush was asked
about a State Department statement that U.S. embassies had been
informed of a terrorist threat against Pan Am more than two weeks
before a Pan Am plane en route to New York crashed in Scotland on
Wednesday.
   Bush said most threats ``never materialize,'' but if there were
``hard evidence that a specific flight was going to be threatened or
that the threat could not be contained, clearly you would want to
serve the public good by notifying people.''
   On anther topic, Bush was asked whether he would consider
military action to destroy a Libyan chemical weapon factory _ an
option that Reagan in a television interview had suggested was under
consideration. He said he would work with U.S. allies to see that
the plant was not built, but he refused to be specific.

   A man teaching his girlfriend how to
defend herself was killed when she shot him in the face as he
pretended to be a burglar in their home, police said.
   Frederick Williams, 26, was killed Thursday by a 12-gauge shotgun
blast at close range as he was teaching Yolanda Edwards, Duval
County Sheriff's spokesman Asa Higgs said.
   The couple had been discussing how Ms. Edwards, 21, could protect
herself from intruders, and Williams gave her the shotgun to use in
practice, deputies said. Williams apparently had loaded the gun and
disengaged a safety.
   Ms. Edwards, however, told police she thought her boyfriend had
unloaded the gun before handing it to her.
   After giving her the gun, Williams left the room and returned
posing as an intruder, police said. Ms. Edwards pointed the shotgun
at Williams and lightly squeezed the trigger, causing the gun to
discharge.
   Ms. Edwards then phoned police to report the shooting.
   Detectives who were called to the home concluded that the
shooting was accidental, Higgs said. No charges were filed against
Ms. Edwards.

   Heavy fog caused a pileup of as many as

miles west of here.
   ``We feel like there is a total of approximately 15 victims and
we only have one fatality so far,'' said Debe West, a spokeswoman at
Cookeville General Hospital. At least two or three people were

   A trooper on the scene reported a pileup of possibly 25 to 30

<TEXT>
   Christmas Eve will be ``Silent Night''
for almost 800 pirate radio stations slated to shut down
indefinitely as part of a government plan to restructure
broadcasting.
   The center-right Social Democrat government has ordered the
Saturday closure while it evaluates offers from stations for control
of 430 frequencies that will be available for local broadcast in
1989.
   ``Final offers have to be submitted by Jan. 3. But the problem is
(the government) hasn't said how long stations will be closed for,''
said Emidio Rangel, director of TSF, a major commercial station that
will close one day before the deadline to allow its employees to
spend Christmas with their families.
   Rangel said between 2,000 and 3,000 people could lose their jobs
because of the closure.
   Pirate stations began broadcasting on the FM band in 1977 but,
with names like Radio Unforeseen and Radio Chaos, most were amateur.
Successive governments tolerated the pirates, and the unregulated
stations boomed.
   TSF, Portugal's most popular station among listeners in the 25-45
age group, boasted a closing program Friday with live interviews
with President Mario Soares, marathon star Rosa Mota and leading
politicians.
   The station, set up in February this year with a capital of
$690,000, has no plans to lay off its 75-strong staff, said TSF
journalist Luis Marinho.
   Prime Minister Anibal Cavaco Silva is committed long-term to
liberalizing the state national broadcasting monopoly, but the
government plans to hand over only one frequency to a national
commercial network at a future date.
   The government has been criticized for reallocating the local
stations, while leaving state- and church-controlled national
networks intact.

   Legislators gave final approval Friday to a law
intended to track and prevent the spread of AIDS.
   The law, to take effect next year, would require doctors to
report to local governors the name, age and sex of any AIDS patient
and how the victim contracted the disease, said an official at the
research office of the Standing Committee on Social and Labor
Affairs, a government agency.
   The law also authorize governors to fine anyone refusing to be
tested for AIDS up to $800, and to punish doctors who disclose
information about AIDS patients to anyone but the governor's office,
said the official, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   He said the law provides for banning entry to any foreigner
believed likely to engage in activities that could spread acquired
immune deficience syndrome, although AIDS tests are not mandatory
for foreigners.
   Most opposition members voted against the bill, saying it would
lead to people avoiding seeing their doctors.
   The government says 50 people have died of AIDS in Japan as of
Aug. 31, with 90 confirmed AIDS patients and 1,048 known carriers of
the virus.

<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Colored lights and tinsel add a twinkle to
the drab store windows, but holiday shoppers' spirits often sink
once they scour aisles of shoddy goods and gasp at the prices.
   For many Poles, this year's Christmas rush through rainy streets
under leaden skies caps a year of economic and political discontent.
   Constant price increases and inflation have eroded the value of
the zloty and shortages send shoppers scampering to better stocked
stores in nearby Czechoslovakia and East Germany.
   The authorities have tried to stock the markets before the
three-day Christmas holiday that starts with ``Wigilia,'' or
``Vigil,'' _ the traditional 12-dish meatless meal that begins when
the first star appears on the evening of Dec. 24.
   Thousands of people crowded the cavernous hall at Warsaw's Hala
Mirowska market Friday amid piles of oranges, nuts, and prunes.
Outside, trucks unloaded Christmas trees and farmers sold spruce
garlands from the country.
   At one meat counter, four saleswomen chatted as about 50
customers in line ignored old sausages hanging on hooks and waited
for the next meat delivery in hopes of obtaining hams or smoked pork.
   The situation in the stores is ``very bad, especially meat,''
said Zdzislaw Kilinski, a private businessman. ``Soon the government
will end meat (ration) coupons, prices will be higher, and I think
they are saving the meat until then.''
   In general, customers complained about the lack of good quality
TVs, radios and clothes in state stores, and said they couldn't
afford prices in private shops.
   One effort at a major Warsaw department store to provide a better
selection of goods frustrated and angered some shoppers _ because it
accepted only Western hard-currency _ and police had to cordon off
one newly opened, well-stocked store in a provincial city to prevent
a near-riot by the heavy flow of customers.
   Shoppers at the three-story Junior department store in downtown
Warsaw enter another world when the escalator stops at the second
floor.
   Under bright fluorescent lights, the shelves are laden with
brand-name Western household appliances, ski boots, and fashionable
evening clothes.
   But because all items in the state-run store are priced in
dollars and must be paid for in hard currency, many Poles will still
have to buy the shabby stitchings one floor down.
   The shortage in normal stores of good toys, pretty clothes and
fragrant scents has led more than 5,000 customers to part with their
precious dollars since the floor opened for business on Monday, said
the floor manager, Mariusz Dobrzynski.
   Long lines have also formed at the Pewex and Baltona dollar
stores for champagne, wine and vodka. The biggest lines were for
games and toys from the West: tennis rackets, erector sets and dolls.
   In the city of Bielsko-Biala, police were called in to restore
order after an avalanche of customers tried to pour through the
doors of the newly opened Klimczok department store, the state-run
news agency PAP reported.
   The department store in the Poland's southern highlands is being
hailed as the country's biggest. When it opened last week, a
near-riot erupted and Polish TV showed scenes of one shopper who got
a bloody nose in the tumult. Others were shown being carried out
after apparently fainting.
   The official PAP news agency complained that professional buyers
were scarfing up anying on the shelves, and the goods appeared the
next day at inflated prices on the Bielsko-Biala flea market.
   Another shopping store in Lodz, in central Poland, was serving
200,000 customers a day and taking in the equivalent of $340,000
daily.
   The Christmas bying season was seen by the new government of
Prime Minister Mieczyslaw F. Rakowski as a test of its ability to
improve public moods.
   The government spent millions of zlotys to purchase extra
supplies of holiday goods like oranges, lemons, bananas and raisins,
and supplies of other traditional Christmas foods like carp and
imported wines from Hungary and Soviet Georgia.
   Shoppers at Hala Mirowska said that in terms of most holiday food
the government had largely succeeded. ``Not so bad, as you can
see,'' said one woman standing in line for holiday poppy-seed cakes.
   But for hams, better meats and consumer goods for giving as
presents, there was disappointment.
   ``There are no boots and a lot of things you need for life,''
said Kilinski.
   ``Maybe it could have been better.''

<HEAD>Vatican Rebukes Catholic Clinics For Using `Test-Tube' Conception</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By FRANCES D'EMILIO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>

   The Vatican said Friday that Roman Catholic
university clinics were challenging church teaching by continuing
research into test-tube conception, which the church rejects.
   An editorial in the Vatican's newspaper, L'Osservatore Romano,
said the church feels determined ``as never before'' to safeguard
the common good against ``technological manipulation of the very
fonts of life.''
   ``The oscillations and discord in the Catholic camp have
contributed to rendering the question more complex,'' said the
editorial.
   ``Above all, the gravity of the decision of several Catholic
university clinics to continue, under certain conditions, the
practive of homologous `in vitro' fertilizaton, cannot be
undervalued.''
   ``Such resolve, from the moment it was made public, has become a
challenge as well,'' the newspaper said.
   In January, a Vatican meeting failed to resolve a dispute between
the Vatican and three Catholic universities in Europe on researching
test-tube conception.
   In 1987, a Vatican document approved by Pope John II had
condemned test-tube conception, surrogate motherhood and
experimentation on live embryos.
   It also branded as immoral the freezing of embryos, cloning,
attempts to fashion animal-human hybrids and the implanation of
embryos in artificial or animal uteruses.
   Shortly after the document's publication, the Catholic University
of Lille, France, announced it will continue experiments with
``in-vitro'' fertilization to help couples who otherwise couldn't
have children.
   The January meeting was with rectors of the Lille institution,
Universite Catholique de Louvain, in Belgium, and Holland's
Katholieke Universiteit of Nijmegen.
   Roman Catholic teaching holds that the only moral way to create
human life is normal sexual acts between a married couple. In ``in
vitro'' methods, an egg is taken from a woman's ovary and united
with sperm outside the womb. When life begins to grow, the
fertilized egg is then implanted in a womb.
   Referring to the universities' decision, the editorial continued:
``The directors of this ... very serious rebellion, try still to
justify themselves by claiming to respect the Roman teaching.''
   The editorial said the clinics claim not to understand the
reasons for the stance of the Vatican's Congregation for the
Doctrine of the Faith.
   The congregation is the Vatican's watchdog for doctrinal
orthodoxy.
   The newspaper asserted that use of artificial birth control ended
up being an incentive for abortion, and that similarly ``it is
becoming evident that artifical procreation puts as its operating
premise'' discriminating cultural choices as to what kind of babies
would be born.

   A bouquet of red tulips lay on the steps of
Syracuse University's study center as students and teachers ended a
memorial service Friday for classmates killed in the Pan Am crash.
   They hugged one another and wept, clustered in small groups
outside the gray stone church where the morning service was held,
and met at the elegant mansion that houses their school across the
street.
   ``They had such a passionate interest in life and a desire to
make the world better,'' Malcolm Ingrim, a Syracuse drama professor,
said as he remembered the six he taught and the other students
killed in the crash Wednesday night.
   ``When all that is snuffed out in 30 seconds it's impossible to
make any sense of it,'' he said. ``It's shattering.''
   The 35 Syracuse students were among 258 people who died when the
New York-bound Boeing 747 crashed in the Scottish village of
Lockerbie on Wednesday.
   Paul Smith, an English major from Kennett Square, Pa., heard the
news Wednesday night while in a pub with friends.
   ``It wasn't real, I couldn't believe it,'' he said.
   Smith shared a house with six friends including Amy Shapiro, a
student from Stamford, Conn., who died in the crash. Like others, he
knew just about all 270 students on the close-knit London program.
   The students were chosen for the program for their academic
ability, and studied at the 19th century mansion on fashionable
Ladbroke Grove with Syracuse and London School of Economics
professors. The term ended Dec. 17, and most had already gone home
when the crash occurred.
   After a friend got a call from the United States and went to the
pub to tell them, Smith and the others raced to the study center to
wait for news. Sometime past midnight, they learned the students had
made the flight, and that there were no survivors.
   ``It still isn't real. You keep expecting Amy to walk through the
door,'' he said, his hands in his pockets and his eyes downcast.
Asked what she was like, he said, ``She was the happiest person
alive.''
   Kristin Huffmon, a junior from Madison, N.J., said Ms. Shapiro
was studying photography and had always said, half-jokingly, that
her dream was to work for National Geographic magazine.
   ``Doesn't every photojournalism student want to work for National
Geographic? That was Amy's `joke,''' said Ms. Huffmon, a political
science major.
   Ingrim, who is originally from London, said three of his students
_ Theodora Cohen, Miriam Wolfe, and Nicole Boulanger _ were planning
to set up a theater troupe at school upon their return. Three
others, Jason Coker, Tim Cardwell and Turhan Ergin, also studied
drama under him.
   ``They were all extremely gifted,'' he said. ``When I see kids of
such promise and energy ... I cannot imagine how the parents are
feeling right now. I just can't imagine.''
   At the memorial service at St. John's church in west London,
vicar Harold Stringer and a local rabbi, Jacqueline Tabick, led the
small group through prayers and hymns.
   They read out the names of those lost and observed a moment of
silence.

   PLO chairman Yasser Arafat today blamed terrorists
for the crash of the Pan Am jetliner in Scotland, condemning it as
an ``inhuman criminal action'' that undermines the peace process in
the Middle East.
   At a news conference at the end of his one-day visit to Rome,
Arafat made his first public comment on the crash of the Boeing 747
in Lockerbie, Scotland, that killed all 258 people aboard and at
least 22 on the ground.
   ``This is an inhuman criminal action which we condemn,'' Arafat
said. ``It is against our peace mission. It is not against a state,
it is directed against humanity as a whole. It is another proof that
we should all fight against this type of terrorist act.''
   ``We join other nations in an effort to stop this terrorism and
criminal acts,'' he added.
   The United States last week reversed a 13-year policy and opened
a ``substantive dialogue'' with the PLO after Arafat renounced
terrorism and accepted Israel's right to exist. U.S. officials have
said the talks will be scuttled if there is proof of PLO involvement
in terrorism.
   Arafat said he was ``very sad'' because the Pan Am crash claimed
the life of ``one of my friends,'' referring to Bernt Carlsson, the
U.N. official involved in negotiations for independence of Namibia.
``I send my heart-felt condolences to all the victims of this
crime.''
   Investigators in Britain are trying to determine if the Pan Am
plane was destroyed by a bomb. Foreign Minister Moshe Arens of
Israel on Friday linked the crash to Palestinian factions.
   ``I am really astonished that rumors were directed against the
Palestinians only,'' Arafat said.
   Asked whether he could control terrorist Abu Nidal and other
radical Palestinian factions, he said: ``These groups are not
Palestinian groups. They follow the intelligence of several Arab and
other states.''
   Arafat said he could only account for groups and individuals
``under the PLO flag.'' He claimed the Israeli secret service Mossad
was trying to undermine the U.S.-PLO dialogue.
   ``According to my information the Mossad has already received
their orders from the Israeli government to sabotage the peace
process,'' he said. He did not elaborate.
   ``It is very important for everyone to know we are pushing to
achieve peace, not only the Palestinian leadership but our masses,''
Arafat said. ``We are against all forms of terrorism.''
   He said Mossad and other groups posed a greater threat. ``All of
us have to coordinate (efforts) to face all forms of terrorism,'' he
said.

   Pope John Paul II told Yasser Arafat during a
20-minute meeting Friday he believes Palestinians and Jews have ``an
identical fundamental right'' to their own countries, the Vatican
said.
   He also called for negotiations and urged Israelis and
Palestinians to live in peace ``in that land where the Prince of
Peace was born,'' Vatican spokesman Joaquin Navarro said.
   Navarro said the pontiff and the Palestine Liberation
Organization chairman had a ``cordial'' talk.
   This audience did not provoke the protest from Israel and Jewish
groups caused by the one Arafat was granted six years ago.
   In mild criticism, spokesman Alon Liel of the Israeli Foreign
Ministry said: ``Peace in the holy land can hardly be served by such
a meeting.''
   Israeli leaders also have met with John Paul, but the Vatican
does not have formal relations with the Jewish state, citing
Israel's unsettled boundaries and the Palestinian problem as reasons.
   John Paul appeared more receptive to Arafat this time, greeting
him in the private library where he usually sees heads of state and
other dignitaries. In 1982, they talked in a small room in the
modern Paul VI audience hall.
   A Vatican statement said the pontiff met Arafat ``in order to
encourage dialogue, the only means to find an equitable solution to
the Mideast conflict, ruling out every form of recourse to arms and
violence and above all, terrorism and reprisals.''
   It said: ``The pope expressed his hope that both peoples would
soon see the beginning of a real process of understanding and of
peace, which would put an end finally to their suffering and their
fears.
   ``The holy father reiterated that he was profoundly convinced
that the two peoples had an identical fundamental right to their own
homelands in which they could live in liberty, dignity and security,
in harmony with the neighboring peoples.''
   Arafat's meeting with John Paul occurred after the PLO chief
conferred with Italian government leaders. He is touring Europe to
seek support for an international Middle East peace conference and
the independent Palestinian state proclaimed Nov. 15.
   Navarro told reporters Arafat briefed the pope on Middle East
developments and that John Paul asked questions, but would not
provide details.
   John Paul has long supported some form of homeland for
Palestinians. The Vatican reacted warmly to the call for a
Palestinian state and praised the United States for deciding to talk
with the PLO after Arafat recognized Israel and renounced terrorism.
   The PLO, in turn, has looked to the Vatican for support.
Palestinian leaders said the pope's first meeting with Arafat six
years ago sas a turning point in the organization's search for
international recognition.
   Four aides accompanied Arafat to the Friday audience, including
Farouk Kaddoumi, head of the PLO political department. With John
Paul was a priest who translated Arafat's Arabic into Italian.
   Arafat gave the pontiff a carved wooden nativity scene and John
Paul gave the PLO chairman a book about the Vatican.
   Earlier Friday, Arafat met with Premier Ciriaco De Mita and
Foreign Minister Giulio Andreotti at the premier's office.
   Andreotti said the meeting ``confirmed the moderate line'' taken
by the PLO, an umbrella organization of several Palestinian groups,
including Arafat's Fatah.
   He said Arafat gave ``a very positive evaluation'' of talks with
the United States, which ended a 13-year ban by Washington on
contacts with the PLO.
   A statement from De Mita's office reaffirmed Italy's support for
an international Middle East peace conference.

   The cockpit recording of Pan Am Flight
103's last minutes ended abruptly after a faint noise, and
conversations among the crew gave no clues about what caused the
plane to crash, officials said today.
   ``There is nothing in the conversations (of the flight crew) to
indicate anything was wrong,'' said Paul McKie, Department of
Transport spokesman.
   ``There is a faint noise at the end which needs a bit more
analysis. There is no indication what that noise is. It would be
quite wrong to jump to any conclusions,'' he said.
   The cockpit recording and flight data tapes from the Boeing 747
were being analyzed by the department's Air Accident Investigation
Branch.
   British and American investigators sifted through crash debris as
relatives of some of the 258 victims aboard the jumbo jet gathered
in a nearby town.
   The noise is heard on the recorder that preserves the last 30
minutes of conversation in the cockpit. The other recorder monitors
flight data.
   McKie told The Associated Press there was nothing abnormal on the
tapes up to the moment they cut off. ``There were no abnormal noises
on the tape until the signals ended abruptly with the aircraft
cruising at 31,000 feet.''
   Although U.S. embassies in Europe had received warnings that a
Pan Am plane would be bombed, the chief British investigator at
Lockerbie, the Scottish village where the plane crashed, said no
evidence of a bomb had been found yet.
   Mick Charles of the Air Accident Investigation Branch told a news
conference: ``We have no evidence whatsoever yet of sabotage,'' but
added this did not mean sabotage was ruled out.
   He said the spread of debris over many miles was ``not unusual,''
since the plane was six miles high and winds were 115 knots. ``In
these circumstances a lot of the debris is going to be sent a very
long distance.''
   Frank Taylor, an aviation safety consultant and former
investigator for the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board, said
a cockpit recording that appears normal until the end could indicate
an explosion knocked out communications, electricity and perhaps
even severed the cockpit from the aircraft. Taylor made his comments
in Washington on Thursday, before cockpit data from the Pan Am
flight was released.
   While aviation experts were reluctant to provide details, it is
generally known that an explosive device placed in certain areas of
the baggage compartment of a Boeing 747 could wipe out computer,
electrical and communications systems as well as possibly
incapacitate the flight crew.
   In Israel, Foreign Minister Moshe Arens today linked the crash to
Palestinian factions. An Israeli newspaper and terror experts blamed
Syrian-backed radical groups opposed to the U.S.-PLO dialogue.
   Arens, interviewed in Hebrew on Israel radio, said that ``based
on our assumptions, and those of our experts, this is an operation
of international terror, apparently Arab international terror.''
   Yasser Arafat, leader of the Palestine Liberation Organization,
today blamed terrorists for the crash of the jetliner, condemning it
as an ``inhuman criminal act'' that undermines the peace process in
the Middle East.
   Arafat made his first public comments on the crash at a news
conference in Rome, where he concluded a one-day visit. He said,
``We join other nations in an effort to stop this terrorism and
criminal acts.''
   ``I am really astonished that rumors were directed against the
Palestinians only,'' he said, and accused the Israeli secret
service, Mossad, of trying to undermine the U.S.-PLO dialogue.
   The Israeli newspaper The Nation quoted unidentified Western
intelligence sources as saying the Syrian-backed Ahmed Jibril group
was responsible.
   The State Department, meanwhile, said four Americans on board the
plane were State Department employees.
   A State Department official, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said two were involved in diplomatic security, one at the U.S.
Embassy in Nicosia, Cyprus, and the other at the U.S. Embassy in
Beirut, Lebanon. Two others were diplomats assigned to the Beirut
embassy, he said.
   The official said an Israeli radio report that two of the
Americans had been involved in negotiations to secure the release of
American hostages in Lebanon was ``totally false.''
   In Carlisle, 33 miles from Lockerbie, relatives of the 258 people
who died on the Boeing 747 began gathering to identify the remains
of loved ones. Another 22 people reportedly died on the ground at
Lockerbie.
   Townspeople stood in a heavy rain today solemnly reading the
lists of the missing.
   About 70 bodies found by search parties still lay outdoors and
about 80 were placed in a makeshift morgue in the town hall while
investigators from West Germany, Scotland Yard and the United States
joined the search.
   The sudden catastrophe that made the plane break up over a wide
patch of Scottish countryside pointed either to major structural
failure or a bomb, and aviation experts agreed the latter was most
likely.
   Speculation about a terrorist attack was fueled by a threat
received Dec. 5 by the U.S. Embassy in Helsinki, Finland, which U.S.
sources believed was linked to the Abu Nidal group of Palestinian
radicals.
   The State Department said an anonymous caller told the U.S.
Embassy a Pan Am flight bound for New York from Frankfurt, West
Germany, would be targeted.
   Flight 103 originated in Frankfurt.
   In addition, an anonymous caller to The Associated Press in
London on Thursday claimed a pro-Iranian group called Guardians of
the Islamic Revolution planted a bomb on the plane.
   The caller said the motive was revenge for the July downing of an
Iranian jetliner in the Persian Gulf by the U.S. warship Vincennes.
   Iran has denied involvement in the crash.
   FBI Director William Sessions told reporters in San Francisco he
had reports of numerous callers claiming responsibility, including
some who claimed affiliation with terrorist groups.
   U.S. Ambassador Charles H. Price II and British Cabinet minister
Malcolm Rifkind, the secretary of state for Scotland, both said
after inspecting the wreckage they were convinced an explosion
occurred.
   The U.S. National Transportation and Safety Board sent four
investigators to Britain, and the Federal Aviation Administration
sent three observers. The Justice Department said it also offered
FBI forensics and disaster units.

   An Air India jumbo jet bound for New York with 250
people aboard returned to London today after a bomb threat.
   Also today, a terminal at Heathrow Airport was evacuated after
officials spotted a suspicious suitcase, and a British Airways
Tristar flew to Heathrow after a bomb threat forced it to make an
unscheduled stop in Rome on Thursday.
   All three incidents followed Wednesday's explosion of a New
York-bound Pan Am Boeing 747 over the Scottish village of Lockerbie.
All 258 people aboard were killed along with at least 22 people on
the ground.
   After Air India Flight 109, a Boeing 747, had taken off for New
York at 2:59 p.m. Air India in New York received a bomb threat from
an anonymous caller, said an airline spokesman, who demanded
anonymity.
   The bomb threat, as a matter of routine, was passed to the
captain of Flight 109 who decided to return to Heathrow, the
spokesman said.
   The 747 landed at 4:21 p.m. and taxied to an isolated area
southwest of the terminals where emergency services were standing
by, the British Airports Authority said.
   Passengers left the plane normally and were taken by bus to
terminal three where they were being kept in two rooms. The airline
spokesman said the plane would be thoroughly searched.
   Earlier today, an unattended suitcase prompted officials to
evacuate hundreds of Christmas travelers from terminal three, but a
bomb squad found the bag contained just clothing, airport officials
said.
   The British Airports Authority said the suitcase was found about
noon today next to an Air Canada check-in desk, just one aisle away
from the Pan Am check-in counter.
   Police said they were told that a man walked into the terminal,
left the suitcase, and drove off again.
   In the British Airways incident, authorities closed Rome's main
Leonardo da Vinci airport for 20 minutes Thursday while the plane
made an emergency landing and its 242 passengers and 12 crew
disembarked at an isolated area.
   The aircraft and the luggage were examined, but no bomb was
found, said British Airways spokesman Michael Blunt. A caller to the
airline's London office said a bomb was on board, he said.
   Flight 146 originated in New Delhi, made a stopover in Kuwait and
was flying to London when it was diverted.
   Blunt said fog had delayed the Tristar for four hours in New
Delhi. About four hours after leaving Kuwait, passengers said the
pilot told them he was landing in Rome because one of his engines
``looked suspicious.''
   Unaware of the bomb threat, most passengers sat in strained
silence while the aircraft descended, then broke into applause on
touchdown about four miles from the Rome terminal. Passengers then
were told to leave the aircraft immediately.
   Outside, the tarmac was swarming with security officials, Italian
police and firefighters, passengers said.

   Three teen-agers found half a million
dollars in travelers' checks in the hills near their home when they
searched for wreckage of the crashed Pan Am jet, police said Friday.
   Stewart Dodd, 14; his 13-year-old brother, Robbie; and friend
Alan Hyslop, 14, scoured the area around their home at Grange
Tundergarth, six miles from Lockerbie on Thursday, the day after the
Boeing 747 broke up in the air and scattered wreckage over a wide
area.
   The boys came across the checks in a brown envelope, said Forster
Dodd, father of Stewart and Robbie.
   ``The checks were all tied together in a big brown envelope that
was torn and damaged. They were all travelers' checks _ there were
no dollar bills,'' he said.
   ``Some of the checks were for several thousand dollars. It seemed
to be official mail _ the package said something like `U.S. Mail
Service' and on it was written how much was inside _ $547,000.''
   The boys took the envelope to their home and gave it to police.

   Commandos with explosive charges
attacked the Defense Ministry and military headquarters in the
capital today, military sources said. No casualties were immediately
reported.
   It was the first time the installation, which houses the Defense
Ministry and the joint chiefs of staff, was attacked during
Salvador's nine-year guerrilla war.
   The sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, gave no other
details.
   Radio reports indicated that two car bombs detonated near the
walled compound in the southwest part of the city, but the reports
could not be immediately confirmed.
   No one claimed responsibility, but the attackers were presumed to
be members of the Farabundo Marti Liberation Front, a left-wing
insurgency trying to overthrow the government. In the last year, it
has attacked installations in the capital with car bombs and
catapult-launched homemade bombs.
   Earlier in the day, unidentified terrorists killed a night
watchman and set off three bombs, destroying the interior of the
biology lab building at the National University, an official at the
institution said.
   The official told The Associated Press that unidentified
individuals cut through a metal fence before dawn to enter the
campus in the capital's northwestern sector. The official, who
commented on condition of anonymity, identified the slain watchman
as Roberto Aguirre.
   No one claimed responsibility for the attack at the university,
with 35,000 students the biggest in the country, and police said
they had no clues on the identity of the attackers.
   The university has been the scene of demonstrations recently by
leftist student unions demanding $1.2 million in additional
appropriations to pay back salaries for December owed to teachers
and workers.
   Students were also protesting the assassination last week of a
woman director of a law faculty extension in the western city of
Santa Ana.
   The interior of the building, including furniture, files,
windows, ceilings and laboratory equipment, was virtually demolished
by the blasts.
   Also today, five provincial town mayors resigned, bringing to 12
the number of mayors who quit during the past three months after
receiving death threats from leftist guerrillas fighting for power.
   The guerrillas have assassinated nine mayors in 1988. They say
the officials were ``executed'' for their part in implementing what
the rebels call ``the U.S.-imposed counterinsurgency plan.''

   If a terrorist bomb brought down Pan Am Flight
103, a 25-minute delay of the jet's departure from London may
provide investigators with their biggest advantage. It kept the
wreckage on land, instead of falling into the ocean.
   The cause of Wednesday's crash that killed all 258 people on
board and more than 20 on the ground has yet to be determined, but
there were signs today pointing to an explosion.
   Witnesses saw a flash of light high in the sky as the jet
plummeted toward the ground; there was no communication from the
cockpit as would have been expected if the pilots encountered flight
control problems, and the wreckage was strewn over miles of Scottish
countryside with the cockpit section found more than three miles
from other large parts of the aircraft.
   From Scotland, officials investigating the crash said today that
the cockpit recording of the flight's last minutes ended abruptly
after a faint noise. They also said conversations among the crew
gave no clues about what caused the plane to crash.
   ``There is nothing in the conversations (of the flight crew) to
indicate anything was wrong,'' said Paul McKie, spokesman for the
British Department of Transport.
   The cockpit recording and flight data tapes from the Boeing 747
were being analyzed by the department's Air Accident Investigation
Branch.
   ``There is a faint noise at the end which needs a bit more
analysis. There is no indication what that noise is,'' said McKie.
   But none of that is conclusive evidence that a bomb detonated
aboard the jetliner.
   President Reagan said today that a public warning about the
flight after an anonymous telephone call to the U.S. Embassy in
Helsinki would ``literally have closed down air traffic in the
world.'' The president said he believes ``all precautions'' were
taken in the warning which went to the airline and U.S. embassies.
   Reagan, speaking in the rain outside the White House as he
departed for California where he will spend the holidays, offered
condolences to the families of the victims, calling for Christmas
prayers for their loss.
   U.S. officials said the caller to the embassy in Finland on Dec.
5 said that a bomb would be planted aboard a Pan Am flight from
Frankfurt, West Germany, to the United States within two weeks.
Flight 103 began in Frankfurt on a Boeing 727, then changed planes
to a Boeing 747 in London. But there has been no evidence that the
telephone tip was related to the crash of Flight 103.
   In addition, an anonymous caller to The Associated Press in
London on Thursday claimed a pro-Iranian group called Guardians of
the Islamic Revolution planted a bomb on the plane.
   The caller said the motive was revenge for the July downing of an
Iranian jetliner in the Persian Gulf by the U.S. warship Vincennes,
but Iran has denied involvement in the crash.
   The wreckage of Flight 103 is expected to provide more definitive
clues, and while it is strewn over miles of countryside, at least it
is not hundreds of feet under wintry seas, some aviation experts
noted.
   In other U.S. developments related to the Pan Am crash:
   _White House officials defended the process by which the State
Department warned U.S. embassies _ but not the general public _ that
a bomb threat had been made against Pan Am. They said the government
would review whether public notification should be considered in
future such cases.
   _President-elect Bush said that if there were ``hard evidence''
that a specific flight was threatened or that the threat could not
be averted, the public should be warned. Nevertheless, he said most
such threats ``never materialize.''
   _FBI Director William Sessions said in San Francisco there have
been ``a number of calls'' from individuals _ some claiming to speak
for various terrorist groups _ taking responsibility for the crash.
Sessions provided no specifics.
   Flight 103 had been airborne 54 minutes when it disappeared from
radar screens while cruising at 31,000 feet over Scotland. It was
about to head westbound over the Atlantic when tragedy struck.
Another half hour and the plane would have been well over water.
   ``You would have had another Air India situation,'' said Frank
Taylor, an aviation safety consultant and former longtime
investigator for the National Transportation Safety Board.
   To many investigators, the Pan Am tragedy appears to resemble the
l985 crash of an Air India Boeing 747 off the Irish coast. That
jumbo jet also plummeted from the sky from 31,000 feet without a
hint of trouble from the pilots.
   But the wreckage landed in the ocean and salvage crews struggled
for four months to gather pieces, including the ``black box''
recorders, that would provide clues. An analysis of the final split
second of the voice recorder was key to Indian officials concluding
that a bomb had exploded aboard the aircraft.
   The authorities probing the Pan Am crash clearly will have more
to work with. They already have found the critical ``black box''
recorders _ one that monitors cockpit conversation and noises and
another that records aircraft performance.
   Investigators will pay close attention to how parts of the
aircraft are bent, tangled and singed and whether there are signs of
residue from an explosion. They also will search for fragments that
might have been used as a detonator and closely examine luggage and
parts of luggage for residue from an explosive.
   The ``black box'' recorders are likely to provide, as they do in
most aviation crashes, the most critical evidence, say aviation
experts.
   The tape from the cockpit recorder may be as important for what
it doesn't say as for what it does, say veteran investigators. Is
there a fragmented sound of an explosion? Are there any exchanges
between pilots about control problems? Did the tape suddenly stop
with no evidence of an emergency or structural concern?
   If all seems normal right to the end, it will be strong evidence
that a powerful explosion might have knocked out communications,
electricity and perhaps even literally severed the cockpit from the
rest of the aircraft, says Taylor. ``If you lost all communications,
lost all electrical power on and airplane, the pilots now are
nothing more than passengers.''
   It would not take a large amount of explosives to do the job,
suggested a number of experts.
   ``If a bomb severs some major or important electrical wiring, or
hydraulic lines or cables, you could lose your ability to control
the airplane,'' noted John Mazor, a spokesman for the Air Line
Pilots Association.
   While aviation experts were reluctant to provide details that
could be used as a primer for terrorism, it is generally known that
if an explosive device _ even a small one _ can be placed in certain
areas of the baggage compartment of a Boeing 747, it could wipe out
critical computer, electrical and communications systems as well as
possibly incapacitate the flight crew.
   Some safety experts say such a scenario explains the sudden loss
of communications while the Pan Am jet was at cruise altitude and
its rapid fall and breakup while still in the sky.
   They point out that commercial jetliners have over the years been
kept aloft for some time even when encountering major structural
problems short of an explosion.
   In l985, the pilots of a Japan Air Lines Boeing 747 struggled to
keep their plane flying for about 32 minutes after a failure in the
rear cabin bulkhead caused rapid depressurization. The jet finally
crashed into a mountain, killing 520 people aboard.

   Terry Anderson's sister asked his
kidnappers Friday to release him for Christmas _ his fourth in
captivity _ but acknowledged ``there is little hope in my heart.''
   Pleading for the American journalist and the 14 other foreigners
held in Lebanon, Peggy Say declared in an open letter to the
pro-Iranian captors: ``I pray for you to have the courage to bring
this to a peaceful conclusion.'' Her appeal was published in Beirut
newspapers.
   Nine of the hostages are Americans, including Anderson, the
41-year-old chief Middle East correspondent of The Associated Press.
He was seized by Shiite Moslem gunmen March 16, 1985, while
returning home from a Saturday morning game of tennis, and has been
held the longest.
   Lebanon's most influential Shiite cleric said Friday the case of
the Western hostages should be settled if Iranian captives are freed
and Israel releases Palestinian and Lebanese prisoners.
   ``We are hearing these days many messages and calls for the
release of the Western hostages,'' said Sheik Mohammed Hussein
Fadlallah, spiritual guide of Hezbollah (Party of God), believed to
be an umbrella organization for groups holding hostages.
   ``We have said time and again that we want this matter closed,''
Fadlallah said in a sermon at the Bir el-Abed mosque in Beirut's
southern slums, where most of the foreigners are thought to be held.
   ``We add our voice to those calling for the release of the
foreign hostages provided all captives, including Iranians in east
Beirut and Lebanese and Palestinians held by Israel, are also freed.
   ``There should be no distinction among kidnap victims. Let the
cry be for the release of all hostages with no discrimination. Let's
treat the case from its humanitarian angle. Let us preserve the
humanity of all of the captives.'' Three Iranian Embassy diplomats
and their driver have been missing since they tried to flee Moslem
west Beirut through the Christian eastern sector during Israel's
1982 invasion of Lebanon. They were stopped by Christian militiamen
and are believed dead.
   Hundreds of Palestinian and Lebanese guerrillas are in Israeli
prisons.
   Eight daily newspapers, including An Nidaa, which speaks for the
Communist Party, published Mrs. Say's letter.
   She addressed it to ``the captors of Terry Anderson'' and said:
   ``Please give Terry our message of love and concern during this
Christmas season. Tell him that thousands pray every day for the
hostages, their captors and the people of Lebanon.''
   An Nahar, an independent daily, published it in English and
Arabic. The others printed the Arabic translation.
   ``We published the English text as well to give Terry a chance to
read what is addressed to him,'' an editor of An Nahar said, on
condition of anonymity.
   Mrs. Say's letter also said:
   ``Traditionally this is a season of hope, peace and forgiveness,
but there is little hope in my heart that I will see Terry and other
hostages released during these Christmas holidays.
   ``It is difficult to sustain hope after almost four years of
working and praying for freedom for Terry and the other hostages.
Some days it seems we have made no progress and are farther from our
goal than ever.
   ``We hear mixed messages from the Middle East and we have no
clear guidelines about what we should do or could do on behalf of
these innocent men.''
   Addressing her brother's kidnappers _ Islamic Jihad (Islamic Holy
War) _ she said: ``Only you, their captors, can end this stalemate.
We have all suffered enough. Please. May God be with you and peace
be yours.''
   Hundreds of Christmas greetings for the hostages from abroad
arrived at Beirut's leftist newspaper as-Safir for the third
straight year.
   Most of them were addressed to Anderson, Thomas Sutherland, 56,
of Fort Collins, Colo., acting dean of agriculture at the American
University of Beirut who was kidnapped in west Beirut June 9, 1985;
and Anglican Church envoy Terry Waite, 49, who was on a personal
mission from the spiritual head of the Anglican Church when he
disappeared after leaving his west Beirut hotel Jan. 20, 1987, to
negotiate for the release of Americans.
   ``To Mr. Terry Waite. We think of you often, more at this time of
the year. We hope you are feeling better by now. Good wishes
always,'' said one card from Dorothy and Leonard Moon of Britain.
   Among the greetings to Sutherland was from a Fort Collins
student. It said: ``Dear Tom. Don't go around thinking we haven't
remembered you. We have a day or holiday for you in Fort Collins and
we tie yellow ribbons on all the trees around the campus in
remembrance of you. We also have a calendar by the field house that
counts how many days you've been held captive until you come back.''
   In London, Archbishop of Canterbury Robert Runcie said ``I would
like Terry Waite back'' as a Christmas present.
   On Thursday, families and friends of hostages made radio appeals
for their release. Among them were Mrs. Say and two freed American
hostages, the Rev. Lawrence Jenco and David Jacobsen.

   The United States on Friday welcomed the
formation of a new government in Israel, and Secretary of State
George Shultz congratulated former Israeli Ambassador Moshe Arens on
becoming his country's new foreign minister.
   ``The U.S.-Israeli relationship has been marked by frequent and
close consultations and cooperation on a number of important
bilateral and regional issues,'' the State Department said in a
brief statement.
   ``We look forward to continuing theis consultative process with
our Israeli friends to strengthen further the enduring ties between
our two countries and to advance the Middle East peace process.''
   Shultz telephoned Israeli Ambassador Moshe Arad on Thursday night
to convey his best wishes for the new government and his ``high
regard'' for Arens, whom he described as a personal friend from the
former envoy's time in Washington, said embassy spokesman Yossi Gal.
   The American-born Arens served here from 1982 to 1983, when he
was recalled to Israel to take over as defense minister.

   President-elect George Bush's son and grandson
are flying to Soviet Armenia over the Christmas weekend to deliver
toys and medical supplies to victims of the devastating earthquake
there, Bush's office said Friday.
   Jeb Bush, 35, a Miami real estate developer, and his son, George,
12, will spend about six hours in Yerevan, the Armenian capital, on
Christmas Day. They leave New York on Saturday, arriving in the
Soviet Union the next morning.
   The Bushes are traveling to Armenia as volunteers for Americares,
a private relief agency that has chartered a DC-8 cargo plane to
transport supplies to the region when 55,000 people were killed in
the earthquake.
   Steve Norman, an Americares spokesman, said the Bushes are among
three people on the flight, loaded primarily with toys and medical
supplies for children.
   On arrival, the Bushes will tour Yerevan, Norman said. ``They
will go into the city and view some of the distribution points,'' he
said.
   Norman said the Bushes will only stay a few hours because of time
restrictions imposed by the Soviets. ``They are not allowing people
to say much longer than that because of congestion at the airport,''
he said.
   The plane will return directly to the United States after a brief
layover in Cologne, West Germany, Norman said.
   Jeb Bush, who campaigned for his father's election and has served
as Florida's secretary of commerce, was familiar with Americares, an
organization founded by Bob Macauley, an old friend of the Bushes'
from Connecticut, Norman said.
   Americares has already flown several relief flights into Armenia.

<DATELINE>BETHLEHEM, Occupied West Bank (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hundreds of Israeli army
troops moved into Bethlehem on Friday to guard against violence as
Christian pilgrims gather for Christmas celebrations.
   Holiday activities in this West Bank town of 35,000 were to be
reduced from previous years in sympathy with the yearlong
Palestinian uprising against Israeli rule in the occupied
territories.
   Israel has controlled the territories since the 1967 Middle East
War, when it captured the West Bank from Jordan and the Gaza Strip
from Egypt.
   Israeli troops took up positions on the roads into Bethlehem, in
its central Manger Square and on roofs of the nearby market. The
square is in front of the Church of the Nativity, which was built
over the grotto where Jesus was born.
   Helmeted soldiers manned rooftop machine gun posts, and dozens of
military jeeps and trucks clogged the Manger Square parking lot.
   Army officials declined to say how many soldiers were sent to the
area, citing security reasons.
   The pro-PLO underground leadership of the uprising has called on
residents in the territories to strike on Saturday in remembrance of
the 333 Palestinians killed in the revolt. Most have been shot to
death in clashes with Israeli troops. Fourteen Israelis also have
died.
   The strike was expected to close all shops and offices in the
territories, including in Bethlehem.
   In one deserted clothes shop Friday, a merchant named Khalad
complained that ``Bethlehem is being reoccupied by the army. I see
more soldiers than I saw in 1967 when we were first occupied. How
can people shop? They are afraid to leave their homes.''
   He asked not to give his last name for fear of reprisal.
   In the center of Bethlehem, slogans painted on the wall by
uprising supporters said ``Remain home on the 24th of December'' and
``Let's escalate the intefadeh,'' which is Arabic for uprising.
   In Jerusalem, a Foreign Ministry official said he expected
Israel's new coalition government to consider two ideas toward peace.
   One would be calling elections in the occupied territories to
select Palestinian negotiators acceptable to Israel and the PLO. The
other is seeking a Soviet-American meeting to launch direct
Arab-Israeli negotiations. The previous coalition government
considered both options.
   The official, who briefed reporters on condition of anonymity,
said Israeli leaders already have rejected the option of giving the
occupied lands autonomy.
   Palestinians have demanded an independent state.
   Bethlehem's Palestinian mayor, Elias Freij, on Friday rejected
Israel-sponsored elections.
   If the balloting is ``for the purpose of electing a new
leadership to be parallel to the PLO, I doubt very much that any
Palestinian will participate,'' Freij said in an interview with
Israel radio.
   He called on Israeli leaders to open talks with representatives
of the PLO, as the United States did last week.
   Freij earlier announced that most of the city's official
Christmas celebrations would be canceled in Bethlehem in solidarity
with the uprising. There will be no municipal decorations and no Boy
Scout parade, he said.
   But the Roman Catholic patriarch in Jerusalem, Michel Sabbah, is
scheduled to lead a religious procession through Bethlehem streets
on Saturday, and the Tourism Ministry is sponsoring a Christmas Eve
concert with choirs from Spain, Switzerland and the Shiloh Baptist
Church in Washington.
   There are an estimated 35,000 Palstinian Christians in the West
Bank and Gaza and about 100,000 Arab Christians in Israel. Between
3,000 and 4,000 western Christians also live in Jerusalem and
surrounding areas.
   Also Friday in the occupied lands, three Palestinians were shot
and injured in clashes with soldiers, hospital officials said.
   A 14-year-old boy was shot in the left leg following Friday
Moslem prayers in the Shati refugee camp in Gaza City, a 16-year-old
boy was shot in the left leg in the Nusseirat refugee camp in the
Gaza Strip and a 7-year-old boy was shot in the right leg in Nablus,
they said.
   The army said it was checking the reports.

   Shortly after 9 a.m., a freak snowstorm
hit the Stewards' house with fury, burying the green lawn and
blooming rose bush and plastering the windows with white stuff.
   For $500, Gregg Steward had bought his family a white Christmas.
   Since Dec. 13, the Riverside Ice Co. has shaved dozens of tons of
ice to cover more than 20 green Southern California lawns with
inches of pure white snow. Under blue skies, palm trees and basking
in 70-degree temperature, children who have grown up with surfboards
and skateboards have tried out sleds and toboggans for the first
time.
   While sun, sand and surf might sound attractive to Northerners
shivering in their hats and mittens, Southern Californians
apparently tire of the tanned life at Christmas time.
   An Arcadia shop sells plastic icicles that customers use to cover
the front of their homes, and sales of spray-can snow are up.
   ``They like a little taste of the Midwest,'' says Chuck Carter,
general manager of the ice company, which usually blows its ice on
vegetable trucks traveling to the East Coast in hot weather.
   As ice company owner Gary Wittenmyer directed the blasting snow
onto the Stewards' yard Thursday, 6-year-old Brett waited, wearing
puffy blue mittens and Amazing Spiderman boots.
   Beside him, in pink ribbons, pink turtleneck, bib-overalls and
Reeboks, was his girlfriend Ashley Cunningham, 6, who already knew
what the snow was for.
   ``I'm going to snow fight Brett,'' she said.
   Gregg Steward, 31, said he had taken Brett and his wife, Bobby,
31, to the mountains the year before for Christmas, and they had
enjoyed playing in the snow. But this year's schedule _ Steward
works as both a Costa Mesa firefighter-paramedic and a Riverside
real estate agent _ didn't allow the time.
   ``So we decided to bring the snow here'' to the family home close
to the Mojave Desert, he said.
   By 9:30 a.m., his New England-style home was sprinkled with five
tons of snow that coated the roof and windows. It lay 6 inches deep
on the lawn, blocking the front door. Brett and the neighborhood
kids attempted a snowball battle.
   ``Some of his friends coming over have _ what do you call them? _
those little round things,'' Steward said.
   There's just not much need to know what toboggans are here, 50
miles inland from Los Angeles.
   The company that coated Steward's yard has had calls from 60
miles west in Beverly Hills and Manhattan Beach, since news broke of
their mini-blizzards. They are booked solid for Christmas Eve and
have lined up jobs for New Year's and Valentine's Day.
   The minimum snow-job costs $300 for 20 300-pound blocks of ice
that are shaved into three tons of snow. Last week, the company put
15 tons of snow on a Moreno Valley lawn for a neighborhood block
party.
   The snow, which consists of fine ice pellets similar to snow cone
ice, lasts for two to three days without rain, about one day with
rainfall. The green grass usually survives despite the cold shower.
   Wittenmyer said the ice company has made more snow in the past
two weeks than in all his 15 years at the company, all because his
wife, Sandy, ran an ad for the usually low-key business in the
newspaper.
   ``It's just gone wild,'' he said.
   But as a transplanted Ohioan, Wittenmyer sees the irony in his
new business.
   ``I came to California to get out of that stuff,'' he said.
   What would the folks back home think now?
   ``They're going to think I'm really a whiz kid selling ice and
snow to Californians.''

<HEAD>New Group Looking For Control of Baptist Convention</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A centrist coalition of Southern Baptists has
launched a bid to win over members of the nation's largest
Protestant denomination, which has been torn for a decade between
conservatives and more liberal members.
   The 14.6 million-member church has been divided since 1979 over
how literally the Bible must be accepted, with conservatives, who
believe every account in the Bible actually happened, controlling
the denomination's hierarchy.
   Last week, a group calling itself Baptists Committed to the
Southern Baptist Convention threw its hat into the ring, promoting
itself as an alternative between the two sides. Its goals, say
organizers, are to educate grass-roots Baptists about issues in the
denomination and to win control away from the conservatives.
   ``If there's an identifiable group, which believes in Southern
Baptist polity and Southern Baptist principles of the separation of
church and state, the priesthood of the believer and the
unquestioned authority of God _ well, that's who I am,'' said the
Rev. Richard Jackson, an Arizona pastor who was defeated in June in
his bid for presidency of the denomination.
   Baptist conservatives had mixed reactions to the organization.
   ``I affirm the right of Baptists to get together and discuss
anything they want to discuss,'' said the Rev. Jerry Vines, of
Jacksonville, Fla., who is the denomination's president.
   Paul Pressler, the Houston judge who has been an architect of the
conservative strategy, told the Dallas Times Herald that he wishes
dissenters would stop fighting.
   ``The Southern Baptist Convention needs healing and working
together, not an escalation of political activity,'' he said.
   Many of the participants at last week's two-day meeting have been
active in previous efforts to wrest control of the church from
current leaders. Among its plans was to launch a new publication to
provide news that does not appear in the convention's newsletter.
   The new organization is a coalition of regional groups including
Message, a Texas-based group, and Baptist Laity for the Baptist
Faith.

<TEXT>
   Volunteers from Jewish groups have become part of
a Christmas tradition in Atlanta _ filling in for non-emergency
workers at hospitals who otherwise might have to work on the holiday.
   The volunteer program started on a small scale in 1981 but has
grown to a systemized effort involving about 500 volunteers who go
to work on Christmas Day so that Christian workers may celebrate at
home with their families.
   Members of the city's Jewish community launched the ``Pinch
Hitter'' program when they saw that many people who wanted to be at
home for the holiday had jobs that required them to work on
Christmas.
   ``Christmas, obviously, holds little significance to the Jewish
community, and here was a chance to let our Christian counterparts
celebrate the holiday,'' said Jeff Rubin, associate publisher of The
Atlanta Jewish Times, a weekly newspaper which last year became a
co-sponsor of the program.
   ``It's an opportunity to promote brotherhood and volunteerism in
the same breath,'' Rubin said.
   Started by the Gate City Lodge of B'nai B'rith, the Jewish
fraternal organization, the program had about 50 volunteers
participating the first couple of years. This year, organizers are
expecting about 500 people to work at nine hospitals.
   The volunteers do just about any task required, Rubin said,
including janitorial work, kitchen duty and assisting in non-medical
patient care.
   Dave Abrams, co-chairman of the program, said some hospital
officials at first were surprised by the willingness of the
volunteers to do menial tasks.
   ``They'd think in many cases we don't want to get our hands dirty
... but that's what this game's all about,'' Abrams said. ``We're
not replacing the doctors, we're replacing the minimum wage people.''
   In addition to providing a break for some workers, the volunteers
also help patients enjoy the holiday, said Judy Smith, spokeswoman
for Emory University Hospital's rehabilitation center, one of the
facilities participating in the program.
   The volunteers have spent time with the center's patients, some
of whom do not have family in the area and are alone for Christmas,
Ms. Smith said.
   ``It's a real important asset for our rehabilitation
population,'' she said.
   As the program has grown, there has been an effort to make it
better organized, Rubin said. A committee this year is coordinating
the needs of the hospitals with the available volunteers so that the
facilities get the number of people they need.
   Another sign of the program's growth, Abrams said, is that a few
non-Jews have joined as volunteers.
   ``Christmas can be a very lonely day for non-Jews who don't have
families,'' he said. ``We've had some call up and ask to volunteer.''

   Neal Sher, head of the Justice Department's
Nazi-hunting unit, Friday questioned why the State Department didn't
alert all government agencies to the terrorist bomb threat prior to
the crash of the Pan Am jumbo jet in Scotland.
   Sher, director of the Office of Special Investigations, lost one
of his aides in the crash, Michael Bernstein, who was returning from
Austria after negotiating an agreement in which the Vienna
government agreed to take back a former SS concentration camp guard
living in La Puente, Calif.
   Sher was in Budapest, Hungary, on official business at the time
of the crash and flew out of Frankfurt, West Germany, on another Pan
American World Airways flight, cutting his trip short when he found
out about Bernstein's death.
   The Pan Am flight that crashed Wednesday en route to New York had
originated in Frankfurt.
   U.S. officials said Thursday a caller to the U.S. Embassy in
Helsinki, Finland, on Dec. 5 said a bomb would be planted aboard a
Pan Am flight from Frankfurt to the United States within two weeks.
   The State Department said it issued a widespread alert about the
bomb threat to airlines, airport security officials and U.S.
embassies. The department said it believed the carriers and airport
security, in particular, should be responsible for enhancing
security matters in such circumstances.
   Asked whether the rest of the government should have been
informed of the threat, which the State Department deemed serious
enough to post in a bulletin board notice at embassies, Sher said he
would have flown on another airline ``if I had known this threat was
out there on Pan Am.''
   ``I'm very upset,'' Sher added. ``People in my office travel all
over the world all the time.''
   Besides Bernstein, three State Department employees, a Peace
Corps volunteer and at least a dozen U.S. military personnel were
among the 258 passengers and crew that died in the crash.
   Sher called Bernstein ``one of the best lawyers who ever came
through'' the office of special investigations and said Bernstein
had won ``a major victory'' in his trip to Vienna.
   During negotiations, Austria agreed to accept Josef Eckert, who
admitted his membership in an SS guard unit assigned to the
Auschwitz concentration camp complex during World War II. Bernstein
informed Sher of the Austrians' agreement in a conversation shortly
before the crash.
   Bernstein, 36, who is survived by his wife and two children, took
a pay cut when he left a private law firm in 1985 and went to work
for Sher after reading a news story about OSI.
   ``There's no question that Mike was doing this out of
dedication,'' Sher said.

   The company dental plan
doesn't cover it, but that isn't stopping Anne Marie Orser from
getting braces for Maddie, her 6-month-old golden retriever.
   ``I always hoped I wouldn't have to put braces on my daughter,''
said Orser of Maple Ridge, a Vancouver suburb. ``I never thought my
dog would have to have braces.''
   The dog is being given a perfect smile and snarl by Vancouver
veterinarian James Anthony, one of the few in Canada who performs
animal orthodontics. His prices range from $150 to $500.
   As in humans, animal orthodontics correct teeth positions so the
pet can eat properly and will have less chance of contracting gum
and tooth disease.
   Unlike teen-agers and pre-teens, who often must wear braces for
years, Maddie's teeth should be straightened within a few weeks,
Anthony said.
   Orser said she especially feared a crooked bottom tooth could
grow through the roof of Maddie's mouth but also wanted the pet to
look her best for dog shows.
   ``We're doing it for better health care. Not doing it could be
risking periodontal disease,'' she said. ``She's definitely part of
the family, so she gets treated as part of the family.''

   Leanna Baker wants a small, intimate
Christmas Day wedding, so she limited herself to 30 maids of honor.
   ``They've been dear friends since childhood and I think it's
wonderful they'll be here for the wedding,'' Baker said.
   The wedding will be held in the Baker family living room, but the
attendants won't take up much room. The maids of honor are Story
Book dolls that Baker, 24, began collecting as an 8-year-old.
   Each has a special position on the white-flocked Christmas tree
that stands in a corner of the room.
   Baker and Darius Michaels had been planning a large church
wedding this spring.
   ``The whole thing just seemed like it was getting out of hand and
it suddenly seemed like too much,'' Baker said, adding that she had
been considering five live bridesmaids as well as a junior
bridesmaid.
   ``And there was all the conflict about how all of the family
members were going to get there on a date that worked with
everybody's schedule,'' she said.
   Finally, she and Michaels settled on Christmas, when members of
both families had planned to get together.
   The 8-inch dolls, each dressed in satin gowns, have sat neatly on
shelves in Baker's room since she was a youngster. Thirty of the 45
dolls were placed on the tree.
   ``We chose the most colorful, the most elaborately dressed,''
Baker's mother, Darlene, said.
   About two dozen people have been invited to Sunday's ceremony.
Baker will have one other special attendant _ her mother.

   The British government issued no public warnings
about a threat made against Pan Am flights because the information
was considered confidential, an official said Friday.
   The Department of Transport said British airports also were not
told about the information passed on by U.S. authorities. The threat
mentioned a Pan Am flight from Frankfurt, West Germany, and did not
specifically mention Britain.
   Transport Minister Michael Portillo said in a British
Broadcasting Corp. television interview that the warning was not
made public because ``this was confidential, classified, U.S.
intelligence information and we didn't have the right to divulge
it.''
   The opposition Labor Party's transport spokesman, John Prescott,
said the government's failure to publicize the threat ended in ``the
poor, ignorant traveling public taking greater risk.''
   Portillo said that ``many warnings are received over the course
of a few months and if these are just fed out to the public without
any assessment, then they would lose their impact.''
   He told Independent Television News: ``This particular warning
was assessed. We looked very carefully at the procedures that we had
in place for American airline flights. Those procedures are greater
than for some other flights, and that was regarded as being
appropriate.''
   A New York-bound Pan American World Airways jumbo jet that took
off from London's Heathrow Airport crashed in southwest Scotland on
Wednesday, killing all aboard.
   Pan Am Flight 103 originated in Frankfurt with a Boeing 727 and
passengers and luggage were transferred to the Boeing 747 at
Heathrow.
   Heathrow said in a statement it ``did not receive any
notification of a reported threat against a Pan American aircraft.''
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's administration Friday ordered
a security review at all British airports, a day after Scotland
Yard's anti-terrorism squad began an investigation at Heathrow into
whether a bomb was smuggled into the plane.
   The State Department said Thursday that an unidentified person
telephoned the U.S. Embassy in Helsinki, Finland, on Dec. 5 and said
there would be a bombing attempt within two weeks against a Pan Am
aircraft flying from Frankfurt to the United States.
   The caller claimed to belong to the Abu Nidal group, a radical
Palestinian faction.
   The State Department said it passed the threat to Pan Am and to
U.S. embassies.
   Portillo said U.S. authorities notified the government Dec. 9 of
a bomb threat against U.S.-bound Pan Am jetliners arriving from
Frankfurt this month.
   In Washington, President Reagan told reporters that to issue a
public warning based on an anonymous threat would ``literally have
closed down all the air traffic in the world.''
   An unidentified British security source was quoted Friday by a
London newspaper, The Independent, as saying suspicion focused on
pro-Iranian terrorists and that a claim of responsibility, from a
caller saying he represented a group called the Guardians of the
Islamic Revolution, was being taken ``very seriously.''
   It quoted the source as saying the group was thought to have
taken revenge for U.S. downing on July 3 of an Iranian airliner
carrying 290 people over the Persian Gulf.
   An anonymous caller to The Associated Press in London claimed
Thursday the Guardians of the Islamic Revolution was responsible.
   The source said the Abu Nidal group reportedly had been in
contact with pro-Iranian groups before Wednesday night's crash.
   Government and industry officials said it seemed clear that the
Pan Am jet broke apart in flight, strewing blazing wreckage over the
Scottish village of Lockerbie and surrounding hills.
   Such a sudden catastrophe would be consistent with reports by
flight controllers that the cockpit sent no distress call as the
plane, having reached cruising altitude of 31,000 feet, disappeared
from radar.

   A propane tanker truck exploded on an
interstate highway in downtown Memphis today, spewing a
700-foot-wide fireball that killed at least five people and engulfed
several homes and cars, authorities said.
   The explosion threw the tanker 125 yards onto a house, killing at
least one child inside, said Fire Department Deputy Director Frank
Baker. Firefighters searched for a second child who was believed to
be inside the home.
   At least a dozen people were injured, authorities said.
   ``There was a guy on fire rolling on the road and there was a
another just lying on the ground where somebody must have put him.
He was still smoking,'' said Jed Tennison, who runs a nearby
business and witnessed the accident.
   The tanker skidded off an exit on Interstate 240 and exploded,
unleashing a fireball that burned at least five houses on both sides
of the highway and three or four other vehicles, said fire Capt.
Benny McDow.
   ``He was trying to exit and lost control and hit a retaining
wall,'' McDow said. ``That exit there is short. It's one of those
tight turns.''
   Four of the dead were killed on the highway, officials said. The
identities of the dead and injured were not immediately known.
   Highway department ambulances took about a dozen people to area
hospitals and other injured were transported by helicopter or by
private vehicle, McDow said.
   The fire department was called about the explosion at 10:10 a.m,
he said.
   ``We do not know the exact cause at this time,'' McDow said.
``Our original call came in as two houses exploded. We responded and
found ... the interstate ... fire.''

<TEXT>
   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ The expulsion of a radical slum
priest from his ecclesiastic order has silenced Haiti's most
influential voice for the rights of the nation's poor.
   In expelling the Rev. Jean-Bertrand Aristide, the conservative
Salesian Order accused the populist Roman Catholic cleric of
fomenting class warfare, calling him a ``protagonist of
destabilization.''
   His ouster was announced Dec. 15 in a statement from Rome.
Although Aristide remains a priest, he cannot officiate at Mass or
deliver sermons over church radio.
   ``He has been neutralized,'' said sociologist Franklyn Midi.
   Aristide, 35, a Salesian priest since 1975, has been one of the
most outspoken campaigners for social justice in a country ruled for
nearly its entire 184-year existence by dictators.
   He has escaped at least three attempts on his life, including a
Sept. 11 attack at his St. Jean Bosco Church in a Port-au-Prince
slum in which thugs armed with machetes, guns, clubs and spears
killed 12 people and wounded at least 70 others.
   One week later, rank-and-file soldiers overthrew Lt. Gen. Henri
Namphy in a coup that put Lt. Gen. Prosper Avril in power. Coup
leaders said they wanted democratic reforms and an end to
state-sponsored violence, citing the church massacre as an example.
   Salesian officials expelled Aristide after he failed to obey
their order to leave Haiti by Oct. 17 and assume a new post in
Canada.
   Two previous transfer orders were rescinded because of popular
protests. Thousands protested in support of Aristide for several
days in October, but there were no immediate demonstrations after
the expulsion.
   Aristide, who has been seen in public only once since the church
massacre, has made no public statement and has declined requests for
interviews. But friends say his morale is excellent and he might
appeal the church decision.
   Despite its condemnation of military brutality and human-rights
abuses in Haiti, the Catholic hierarchy has long opposed Aristide's
political proselytizing of the poor.
   A proponent of liberation theology, which advocates church
involvement in a political struggle by the poor against social
injustice, Aristide preaches ``active non-violence.'' He urges a
``real revolution'' to bring democracy to Haiti, but does not
specifically propose an armed uprising.
   His pulpit style is that of a fire-and-brimstone preacher whose
leading questions prompt quick responses from the congregation. The
sermons were broadcast nationwide and earned Aristide a huge
following among the urban poor and the rural peasantry, who call the
bespectacled ascetic their ``prophet.''
   Although civic leaders and many priests applauded Aristide's
crusade, the church hierarchy apparently feared the possible
consequences of radicalizing the masses.
   ``The upper and middle classes, of course, have heaved a sigh of
relief,'' Midi said of Aristide's ouster. ``They are uncomfortable
when the voice of the poor is raised too high.''
   ``What they have not understood is that Aristide has contained
the resentment of the impoverished masses by giving it a religious
form,'' Midi added. ``He has not sent them into the streets but
drawn them into the church.''
   A Salesian spokesman in Rome, the Rev. Joseph Aubrey, told the
Voice of America that the expulsion was ordered because Haitian
``bishops worried about the results of Aristide's action.''
   But the Rev. Serge Miot, secretary of Haitian Bishops Council,
denied that the council had asked the Salesians to expel Aristide.
   The effective silencing of Aristide coincides with a move by
Avril to tighten army discipline after a purported Oct. 14 coup
attempt. Since then, the government has imprisoned or discharged
dozens of soldiers for alleged insubordination.
   Leftist politicians have accused the government of clamping down
on the most progressive element in the army _ soldiers angered by
the slow progress in bringing about the democratic reforms Avril
promised when he became president.
   It is not known what role, if any, the government had in
Aristide's ouster; but to some, the priest has become a symbol of
the democratic struggle.
   ``Aristide was discharged from his religious order in the same
way that soldiers faithful to the Sept. 17 reform movement have been
discharged from the army,'' said Paul Dejean, a Haitian author and
social worker, referring to those who participated in the coup to
gain democratic reforms.
   ``People who believe in the Gospel values of liberation, liberty,
and justice are penalized and punished,'' he said.

<HEAD>Army Grounds Chinooks for Transmission Checks</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRYAN BRUMLEY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Army said Friday it has grounded its 234
CH-47D medium-lift Chinook helicopters to allow inspection of
possibly faulty transmissions.
   Ten Chinooks have been involved in accidents since 1985, and 16
soldiers were killed in incidents involving the helicopter this
year, although there is no indication that faulty transmissions were
the cause, said Army spokeswoman Paige Eversole.
   The Army grounded the copter fleet in what it called a
``precautionary action'' after the manufacturer, the Boeing Co.,
discovered that ``certain transmissions may have been improperly
assembled,'' the announcement said.
   In the most recent Chinook accident, five servicemen were killed
in a crash in Honduras on Dec. 8.
   Last Feb. 25, 11 soldiers were killed in a Chinook crash near
Chico, Texas.
   Army officials are still investigating the Dec. 8 incident, but
there is ``no suspicion'' that it was linked to the possible
transmission problem, Ms. Eversole said.
   ``Right now we are not speculating at all on the cause of that
accident. We don't know whether there is a relationship between that
accident and this problem. The Army is very quick to ground the
fleet ... for preventive care,'' she said.
   Boeing is sending inspection teams to look at the retainer bolt
assembly, which provides for the proper alignment of internal
gearing and bearings within the main transmission, the spokeswoman
said. The inspections will require 30 days, according to the
announcement.
   The first Chinook CH-47D entered Army service in 1979, replacing
older CH-47 models. The Army is gradually replacing the remaining
146 older Chinooks with the ``D'' model, which has more powerful
engines and transmissions, fiberglass rotor blades, and advanced
flight control systems, the announcement said.
   The Chinook can carry a payload of 16,000 pounds or ferry 33
soldiers.
   The helicopter that crashed in Honduras was on a routine mission
connected with maneuvers the Army has been conducting in that
Central American country since 1982.
   In the Texas crash, ``the retainer bolt assembly was not
identified as a possible cause,'' Ms. Eversole said.
   Despite the recent crashes involving the Chinook, the fiscal year
thaty ended Sept. 30 ``was the safest year on record, with 1.8
accidents per 100,000 hours of flying time for all Army aviation,''
she said.

   Here is a list of some accidents in recent
years involving twin-rotor Boeing CH-47 Chinook helicopters, which
have been grounded by the Army for transmission inspections.
   _Dec. 8, 1988, an Army CH-47D crashed in Honduras, killing five
soldiers.
   _Feb. 25, 1988, an Army CH-47D crashed in a cow pasture near
Chico, Texas, killing 11 soldiers.
   _Nov. 20, 1987, an Army CH-47 crashed and burned in Colombia,
injuring two soldiers.
   _May 15, 1987, an Army CH-47 caught fire and made a forced
landing in dense woods near Monticello, Ark., killing one soldier
and injuring three.
   _Feb. 27, 1987, a Chinook helicopter belonging to the Royal Air
Force crashed near Port Stanley in the Falkland Islands, killing all
seven aboard.
   _Nov. 6, 1986, a Chinook 234, a civilian version of the
helicopter, crashed in the North Sea, killing 45 people. The company
that operated the helicopter said gearbox fatigue probably caused
the crash.
   _May 13, 1986, a British Army Chinook crashed into a mountain on
West Falkland Island, killing three crewmen. Officials said
visibility was poor at the time.
   _April 9, 1986, an Army CH-47D collided with an AH-1S Cobra
helicopter over Fort Stewart, Ga., killing eight soldiers.
   _July 11, 1985, a CH-47D being tested before delivery to the Army
crashed in a marshy area in southern New Jersey, killing two crew
members.
   _April 21, 1985, a CH-47D taxiing on the ground in Honduras was
destroyed when one rotor stopped turning and was struck by the
other. Eight soldiers were injured, and the Army grounded its fleet
of Chinooks for a month and a half to replace rotor transmission
bearings.

   A purse snatcher got much more than he
bargained for when the victim was joined in pursuit by 10 to 15
shopkeepers, police said.
   A Christmas shopper walking in Norwalk had her purse plucked
Wednesday, and the thief headed up the street, according to Sgt.
Richard Rilling.
   The woman screamed and began to give chase. She was soon followed
by the store owners and employees, police said.
   The thief ran into a house, which his pursuers surrounded as
police arrived. A police dog named Rex went into the house and
turned up the pocket book in a upstairs room and the suspect in the
basement, Rilling said.
   David Fagan, 29, of Norwalk was charged with second-degree
larceny for the Wednesday incident and other larceny charges for
purse-snatchings in the area Dec. 14 and 20.

   It's her house, but Jeanette Noble wants
everyone to know the disheveled, ``tacky'' dwelling cared for by
comic Roseanne Barr in her hit show ``Roseanne'' does not always

   Noble's modest frame bungalow has been cast as the home for the

Evansville and has featured his hometown's street signs and
factories in several exterior shots for the show, which is set in
Chicago.
   Noble, who operates a day care business from the house, is quick
to point out her home is not presented in its best light on the
small screen.
   ``They junk it up,'' she said. ``They get tricycles and wagons
from my garage. And they take out flower pots and my sprinkling can
and spread them around.''
   She once winced when the show's photographers stuck a red velvet
reindeer in her mailbox.
   ``I said, `Oh, that looks tacky. I would never do that,'''
recalls Noble. ``They said, `No, but Roseanne would.'''

   Actor Kurt Russell served venison stew from his
recent ``Celebrity Hunt'' to the homeless and needy at a Salvation
Army center, but the act of charity failed to offset the ire of
animal rights activists.
   Russell, who held a hunt that drew 32 athletes, actors and
popular musicians, donated 500 pounds of the big game meat to the
Salvation Army in Denver and 500 pounds to the Rescue Mission in
Grand Junction in western Colorado.
   The actor, who wore a flannel shirt and blue jeans while serving
meals Thursday, said he wanted the hunt to ``show the reason that
you take game is for providing either for yourself or your family
or, in this case, for other people.''
   Nonetheless, the event troubled animal rights activists and some
Hollywood celebrities who took out a full-page ad in the
show-business publication Variety protesting the hunt.

   Mayor Charles Luken says he's through betting
on the Cincinnati Bengals after paying off a bet he lost to
Cleveland Mayor George Voinovich over a Bengals-Cleveland Browns
game.
   ``I'm not going to make any bets because I don't want the Bengals
to carry the Luken hex into the playoff game,'' Luken told reporters
Thursday.
   He lost the bet with Voinovich when the Browns defeated the
Bengals 23-16 on Oct. 30 in Cleveland. Luken had to pay with a plate
of chili-covered spaghetti, which the mayors ate together at Luken's
City Hall office.
   Luken also had to fly Cleveland's city flag over the Cincinnati
City Hall. Asked when the flag was flown, Luken said, ``Dec. 21 _
it's the shortest day of the year.''
   Had Voinovich lost, he was to supply Luken with some Slovenian
klobase, an ethnic sausage.
   Both teams are in the National Football League playoffs.
   The Browns play the Houston Oilers in Cleveland on Saturday in
the American Conference wild card game. The Bengals play the Seattle
Seahawks New Year's weekend at Riverfront Stadium.

   Bill Cosby says that while he was growing
up his mother was more interested in admiring his Christmas presents
to her than in using them.
   ``I tried to give her presents I really thought she needed _ an
electric toaster, a waffle iron, a percolator coffee pot; She loved
them all,'' Cosby says. ``But did she use them? No.
   ``She put them all on top of the refrigerator like they were
trophies from the Olympics and she'd get really mad if anyone took
them down and tried to use them.''
   Cosby, who is to appear at a hotel-casino Jan. 3-8, says he
particularly remembers looking up at a shiny new toaster while
browning bread the hard way.
   ``For years, we still made our toast in the bottom of the oven,''
he says. ``You put it in, wait a while, then turn it over and burn
your fingers while that terrific stainless steel toaster ... sat on
top of the refrigerator.
   ``My mother was a little strange about Christmas.''

   Three State Department employees, a Justice
Department official and a Peace Corps volunteer were aboard the Pan
American World Airways flight which crashed in Scotland, it was
announced today.
   Deputy State Department spokeswoman Phyllis Oakley identified the
victims as follows:
   Matthew K. Gannon, of Orange, Calif. He was assigned to the State
Department's Middle East bureau and was returning home upon
completion of assignment in Beirut as a political officer. He had
previously worked in North Yemen, Jordan and Syria.
   Ronald A. Lariviere of Holyoke, Mass. He had been assigned by the
State Department to Beirut as a security officer since June 1988. He
had previously served in Washington in the office of diplomatic
security after joining the department in 1987.

<HEAD>USDA Setting Sanitary Standards for Air Shipment of Animals</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A new federal sanitation regulation is being
expanded to include airplanes used to carry animals sold to foreign
buyers, the Agriculture Department said Friday.
   James W. Glosser, administrator of the department's Animal and
Plant Health Inspection Service, said the new rule will take effect
on Jan. 23. It was officially proposed two years ago.
   Until now, he said, sanitation rules covered only ships, which
were the principal carriers of animals exported by the United
States. The regulations will not apply to the shipment of pets and
other small animals.
   ``Today, most animals, like people, travel abroad by air, and air
travel should be addressed by the regulations,'' Glosser said. ``In
fact, most airplanes already are disinfected before they are used to
transport animals from the United States.''
   Vehicles used for animals can be contaminated with disease
organisms or flies, ticks, lice and mites that carry disease, he
said.
   The expanded rule covers aircraft, loading ramps, fittings and
other equipment. All will have to be cleaned and disinfected before
animals are loaded, Glosser said.

   President Reagan offered condolences today to
families of the victims of the Pan Am crash in Scotland but said to
issue a public warning based on an anonymous threat would
``literally have closed down all the air traffic in the world.''
   Reagan made the comment in Washington before arriving here for a
two-week California holiday vacation.
   The president said it would be impossible to issue public
warnings about all such supposed terrorist threats.
   ``If you stop to think about it, such a public statement, with
nothing but a telephone call to go on, would literally have closed
down all the air traffic in the world,'' said Reagan.
   ``The search still goes on. We have no knowledge about how the
accident happened. We're still trying to find out,'' Reagan said of
investigation into the crash on the New York-bound flight Wednesday
in Scotland that killed at least 280 people.
   Asked about warnings issued to some U.S. diplomats of a threat of
terrorist attack against a Pan Am flight from Frankfurt, he said,
``All the precautions that could be taken were taken with regard to
warning the airline and all.'' He was referring to warnings by the
State Department and the Federal Aviation Administration to Pan Am
and police authorities, but not to the general public.
   Phyllis Oakley, a State Department spokeswoman, said Thursday
that an unidentified individual telephoned the U.S. Embassy in
Helsinki on Dec. 5 and said there would be a bombing attempt within
two weeks against a Pan Am aircraft flying from Frankfurt to the
United States. Flight 103 originated in Frankfurt with a Boeing 727,
with passengers and luggage switched to a Boeing 747 in London.
   Asked if he had any knowledge about whether a bomb had caused the
plane to explode, Reagan said, ``None of this is established.''
   Prior to answering questions, Reagan read a statement, with his
wife Nancy at his side.
   ``I want to express our sorrow and concern to the families and
friends of those who died in the Pan Am crash ... There are
difficult aspects of this tragedy, but none so compelling as the
anguish of those families who will not have their loved ones with
them this Christmas season,'' Reagan said.
   Reagan, noting that several dozen students from Syracuse
University lost their lives in the fiery crash, young people who
``carried the twin promises of hopes and dreams.''
   ``The tragedy that steals the hopes and dreams from our society
magnifies the loss to our society,'' Reagan said.
   The president asked the nation to ``say a special prayer this
Christmas'' for the victims of the crash and their loved ones.
   The president and his wife then departed on their Marine One
helicopter for Andrews Air Force Base. They planned to celebrate
Christmas in their lush new Bel Air home and bring in the New Year
at the palatial estate of multimillionaire publisher Walter
Annenberg in Rancho Mirage, near Palm Springs.
   The president, who has spent 444 days in his home state since
taking office in January, 1981, will return to the White House Jan.
5. After he leaves office Jan. 20, he and the first lady will move
to Bel Air.
   The $2.5 million estate was purchased by California friends of
the Reagans, who are leasing it to them.
   In an interview broadcast Thursday night, veteran ABC television
journalist David Brinkley noted that some homeless sleep on grates
or on the grass in Lafayette Park, across Pennsylvania Avenue from
the White House.
   Reagan replied, ``Yes, but, David, doesn't that go back _ that
there are always going to be people _ they make it their own choice
for staying out there.''
   ``There are shelters in virtually every city and shelters here
and those people still prefer out there on the grates or the lawn to
going into one of those shelters,'' the president said.
   Reagan also said that ``a large percentage'' of the homeless are
retarded people freed from institutions after laws were changed so
that ``they could only be committed to an asylum or a mental
hospital if they represented a threat, a danger to others or to
themselves.''
   ``People particularly in _ you call it retarded _ walked away
from those institutions, they wanted freedom, but they walked out to
where there was nothing for them,'' he said.
   In the interview, taped Wednesday in the Oval Office, Reagan also
commented on whether he thought Soviet President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev, whom he has joined in forging more cordial U.S.-Soviet
relations, might be forced from office.
   ``Up until now the government of that huge country or nation is
the communist party, which is really a tiny elite of the population
of the Soviet Union,'' he said.
   ``But they literally appoint, so it is possible for _ and we've
seen it in the past _ Soviet leaders to suddenly be ousted. I don't
see any indication yet or threat of that, but I think it's something
that has to be considered if you look at their past history.''
   When asked whether he thought he had escaped blame for things
that went wrong in his administration because people liked him,
Reagan said that ``maybe that's in return for something, because I
like people. I really do.''

   The decomposed body of a toddler was found
stuffed in a gym bag, the bag in a suitcase encased in concrete and
dumped along a dirt road, police said Friday.
   An autopsy Thursday night was only partially conclusive, and
police do not know who the child is. Ware County Sheriff Herbert E.
Bond said there are no small children known to be missing from the
area.
   The body was found Wednesday by a trucker, 16 miles west of
Waycross.
   She had been wrapped in a blanket and stuffed in a gym bag, which
then was placed in a metal suitcase, and the suitcase sealed with
concrete. The suitcase was then placed in an abandoned TV console
and nailed shut with plywood.
   The driver, who was not identified, ``cried like a baby when he
found it,'' the sheriff said.
   The autopsy at the State Crime Lab determined her sex, race and
probable age. Bond said pathologists determined that the child had
been dead about one to two months and was about 3, who was 2-feet-9
and weighed about 30 pounds.
   ``They were able to tell us she had not been shot or stabbed,''
Bond said Friday.
   ``I don't know whether it was an abused child that was
accidentally killed, or a kidnap victim that was killed somewhere
else and brought there,'' he said. ``But somebody went to great
extremes to put it together and then leave it out there in the
open.''

   Santa Claus might be a thin, disagreeable
character in a stiff-brimmed hat if not for the 19th-century
cartoonist Thomas Nast.
   Nast, from whose pen also came the Democratic donkey and the
Republican elephant, gave Santa his present shape _ short, fat and
jolly man with a stocking cap and a long white beard _ as a morale
booster during the Civil War.
   Previously, Santa Claus was sometimes depicted as tall, thin and
domineering, and often had black hair and a stiff-brimmed hat, said
James I. Robertson, a history professor at Virginia Tech in
Blacksburg.
   ``There was no stereotype of Santa Claus at that time,'' he said.
``He tended to be in all shapes and sizes.''
   Nast, as a 21-year-old artist at Harper's Weekly in 1863, drew a
short, fat, bearded Santa bringing gifts to Union troops in a
star-spangled jacket, a cap and striped pants, Robertson said.
   ``The drawing boosted the spirits of soldiers and civilians alike
because it showed the spirit of Christmas had come to the Civil
War,'' the professor said.
   Nast was influenced by Clement Moore, whose 1823 poem ``'Twas The
Night Before Christmas'' depicted a twinkly-eyed, white-haired Santa
smoking a pipe, the professor said.
   Almost every year after, Nast drew a similar Santa. ``Hence the
American Santa Claus took shape by repetition. We just became
accustomed to this same figure,'' Robertson said.
   One aspect of Nast's Santa Claus did not make it to the 20th
century _ ``Nast always put a sprig of mistletoe on his cap,''
Robertson said.

<HEAD>Soviets Scrap Six Nuclear Plants</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARK J. PORUBCANSKY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Six nuclear power projects have been halted in the
Soviet Union because of earthquake danger or tougher standards
imposed after the Chernobyl accident, the nuclear power minister
said Friday.
   Official media has reported cancellation of several projects
because of growing public opposition after the Chernobyl disaster.
   But the list provided at a news conference by Nikolai Lukonin,
minister of the nuclear power industry, was the first comprehensive
report on the state of the Soviet nuclear power industry.
   Cancellations were ``partly due to highly seismic areas, and the
second reason were changes in regulations and norms of building
power plants,'' Lukonin said.
   He said projects had been scrapped in Azerbaijan; Minsk,
Byelorussia; Odessa; and Krasnodar; and that additional units to
existing plants in Armenia and Georgia had been canceled. Those
projects had a combined capacity of 28 million kilowatt hours.
   Officials also temporarily suspended work on a third reactor in
the Baltic republic of Lithuania because of public concern about
possible environmental damage to a lake and earthquake danger,
Lukonin said.
   The nuclear plant located near the Armenian capital of Yerevan is
built on a geological fault. It was shaken but undamaged by the Dec.
7 quake that killed an estimated 55,000 people in northern Armenia.
But Premier Nikolai I. Ryzhkov said in Yerevan on Dec. 12 that the
plant will be closed in two years because of the danger of future
quakes.
   The Georgia, Azerbaijan and Krasnodar sites also are located near
Armenia in the earthquake-prone Caucasus Mountain region of the
southern Soviet Union.
   The Soviet Union has 16 nuclear power plants containing 45
reactors that now produce 12.7 percent of the country's electricity.
Officials are looking for new sites in more stable areas such as
Karelia in the far north near Finland, Lukonin said.
   Despite the cancellations, planning and construction is
continuing at 15 other sites, and it is ``impossible'' to develop
the Soviet economy without further reliance on nuclear power,
Lukonin said.
   Soviet officials have acknowledged a fear of nuclear power among
citizens since the April 1986 Chernobyl accident in the northern
Ukraine that killed at least 31 people and released a cloud of
radiation that eventually circled the globe.
   Opposition to nuclear power has brought Soviets out on the
streets of several cities and some residents of Kiev are inclined to
blame unexplained health problems on the Chernobyl accident.
   Lukonin said fears of nuclear power were a major reason officials
imposed stricter siting and construction requirements after the
Chernobyl accident. The Soviet Union ended production of the
graphite-cooled reactor of the type that failed at Chernobyl.
   But 15 of those reactors still are operating with modifications
made after Chernobyl.
   ``We have to work more closely with the public. We have had
certain misunderstandings with that in the past,'' Lukonin said.
``We have less problems when we explain.''
   Officials of the International Atomic Energy Agency, which
conducted the first international inspection of a Soviet nuclear
power plant, said they were impressed with its safety features and
staff, but that manufacturers had supplied poor quality equipment
that needed modification before it was used.
   ``What the team saw in some cases is that the plant had to take
some equipment that was received, and on plant initiative improve
the quality,'' said Morris Rosen, the director of the agency's
nuclear safety program.
   The director of the Ukrainian plant that underwent the inspection
said he had spent $260 million to improve equipment.
   V.A. Korovkin, director of the plant in the western Ukraine city
of Rovno, said the equipment was for two older reactors, a third
reactor commissioned during the past two years and a fourth unit
that is under construction.
   Agency officials said there was no way to tell from the recently
completed three-week inspection of the Rovno plant whether similar
quality problems exist at other Soviet plants.
   Next year they will carry out a similar inspection in Gorky,
located east of Moscow.

<HEAD>Engineering Student Agrees To Pay School $9,800 For Gluing Locks</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A former University of Massachusetts
student who went on a Halloween lock-gluing spree has been placed on
probation for five years and has agreed to pay $9,800 for damage to
seven buildings and telephone cables.
   Kamal Hyder, 23, from Ryadh, India, was among three students
charged with causing nearly $16,000 worth of damage by injecting a
liquid-steel substance into the building locks on Halloween 1987.
Hyder also was accused of cutting telephone cables and other
vandalism.
   His attorney, Thomas Whitney, said Hyder, who did not graduate,
is employed by an engineering firm in Texas and is working on
several significant projects including a computer for the blind that
can read any style of type.
   ``This case aside, I have been doing constructive things,'' Hyder
told Northampton District Court Judge Clement Ferris. He said he had
received a British award for academic achievement and played his
sitar in charity concerts.
   ``I've written 200 letters of apology to UMass professors and
apologized in person to people for what happened,'' he said.
   Hyder told the judge he had learned about gluing locks from a
co-defendant but had come up with his own more efficient way of
doing it.
   ``I don't see any gain by saddling this man with a record,''
Ferris said in agreeing to continue the charges without a finding
for five years. ``Like anybody else, he's entitled to have made a
dumb mistake.''
   Charges against a co-defendant, Michael J. Milbier, also were
continued without a finding when Milbier agreed to pay $9,800 in
restitution.
   Charges against the third student, Thomas M. O'Connor, were
dismissed after Ferris found that O'Connor, who was supposed to act
as a lookout for the other two while the locks were glued, had
second thoughts and fled.

   A man gored by the same 1,500-pound pet
buffalo that mauled his son a year ago said the animal will be
destroyed.
   ``I don't want anything like that around anymore,'' said Gerald
Assel, who was hospitalized in stable condition Friday, two days
after being attacked.
   ``He was a pet, but he turned against us,'' Assel, 54, said.
``You can never trust a buffalo.''
   Assel said he was sweeping refuse from a barn into a corral when
the bull, named J.R., backed him against a door and worked a horn
into his midsection.
   He managed to escape when the door became ajar, Assel said. He
walked to his house, and his wife, Edna, drove him to the hospital,
he said.
   ``If I would've been against the barn, he would've killed me,''
Assel said.
   Dr. Gilbert Gonzalez said Assel was in surgery about 3{ hours.
The attack severely damaged his bowels and lower abdomen muscles,
and even severed part of his appendix, the doctor said.
   Assel said J.R. attacked his 21-year-old son, Landen, in January.
Landen's wounds to his buttocks and face required about 70 stitches,
he said.
   Assel, whose family raises a herd of 16 buffalo on their 900-acre
ranch to supplement their income, said he has had enough of J.R.'s
attacks.
   Assel's wife said Landen will shoot the bull. The rest of the
herd may be sold, Assel said.
   Doctors expect Assel to be hospitalized two more weeks.

<HEAD>Loose Fuel Cap Reportedly Caused F-A-18 Crash, Four Other Mishaps</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   One Navy F-A-18 Hornet fighter has crashed and
four others have experienced in-flight problems due to a loose fuel
filler cap, according to a report published Friday.
   The Navy News quoted documents obtained under the Freedom of
Information Act involving a non-fatal crash of an F-A-18 near
Twentynine Palms, Calif., on Feb. 7, 1987.
   ``There have been four previous F-A-18A fires or potential fires
resulting from fuel caps being improperly locked to the centerline
tank or due to some other suspected malfunction of the fuel cap,''
according to a Navy accident report quoted by Navy News.
   A Navy spokesman, Lt. Cmdr. Craig Quigley, confirmed that an
improperly tightened fuel filler cap caused one crash of an F-A-18
Hornet, but he had not seen documents discussing the other four
incidents.
   ``We have not detected an inherent design flaw with that fuel
filler cap that would cause us to ground the aircraft or to redsign
the fuel filler cap,'' Quigley said.
   ``We know of one case where a maintenance air crewman improperly
secured the fuel filler cap prior to the aircraft taking off,''
Quigley said. ``The cap was ingested by one of the engines and, as
you may suspect, wiped out the engine and caused the aircraft to
crash.''
   ``The investigation into that crash showed that the maintenance
crew of the Ff Wall Street, the nation's fifth-largest securities firm
elected not to risk getting its head blown off.
   Drexel decided to settle the biggest securities fraud case in
history by paying a record $650 million in fines and restitution and
pleading guilty to six felonies, reversing its longstanding claims
of innocence.
   The battle had already cost the firm nearly $2 billion in
attorneys' fees and lost business.
   Drexel also agreed to cooperate with Giuliani's expanding probes
into financial trading abuses spawned largely by the downfall of
Ivan F. Boesky, the convicted speculator who fingered Drexel and
others more than two years ago.
   The decision came moments before a deadline set by Giuliani to
Drexel following weeks of bluffs, counter-bluffs and leaks to the
newspapers that a climax was imminent.
   Post-mortem accounts of this historic showdown reveal Giuliani
told Drexel's directors he was going to make an announcement at 4
p.m. Wednesday.
   ``He said, `It's going to be either an indictment or a
settlement. You decide,''' said one source familiar with the final
pre-deadline maneuvering, who requested anonymity. ``It was a game
of blink, and Drexel blinked.''
   The biggest weapon in Giuliani's arsenal was his threat to
subject Drexel to the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations
act, commonly known as RICO, a widely feared, far-reaching statute
originally designed to combat drug runners, gangsters and pimps.
   If Drexel had been indicted under that act, the government could
have frozen much of its assets and seized what prosecutors had
reason to believe were the firm's ill-gotten gains, before trial, to
hold as security.
   Individuals named in the indictment would have been forced to
surrender their earnings during the period of alleged wrongdoing. A
trial could have taken months or even years, diverting time, energy
and money from a firm that has prided itself on efficiency,
aggressiveness and big profits.
   Moreover, convictions would have exposed Drexel to multiple civil
lawsuits that could have resulted in many hundreds of millions of
dollars in fines, because of the racketeering act's provision for
triple damages to victims.
   A racketeering indictment would have come at the worst possible
time for Drexel, which has been playing crucial financing roles in
nearly every multibillion-dollar takeover of the year, most notably
a $5 billion bridge loan for Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co.'s $24.5
billion acquisition of RJR Nabisco Inc.
   Drexel executives were known to be anxious to protect their
interest in that deal, which could net as much as $300 million in
fees.
   Only a few weeks before Giuliani's Drexel deadline, the
prosecutor had demonstrated vividly to the firm just how powerful
the racketeering act can be.
   The small New Jersey investment partnership Princeton Newport
Partners liquidated because five of its principals and a former
Drexel trader had been indicted under the statute in August by a
Giuliani-directed grand jury.
   The majority of Drexel's directors decided not to risk a similar
fate and opted instead for a settlement that would label the firm a
felon but at least put the investigation behind it for good.
   In other economic and business news this past week:
   _British conglomerate Grand Metropolitan PLC acquired Pillsbury
Co. for $5.68 billion, ending the Minneapolis-based food and
restaurant concern's feeble effort to thwart the takeover, largely
by relying on its poison-pill shareholder rights defense. Grand
Met's triumph raised new questions about the effectiveness of poison
pills, which have been repeatedly challenged in court.
   _Government figures presented more mixed evidence of the
economy's health. Inflation eased slightly in November, while
consumer spending and orders for large durable goods rose. For the
third quarter of the year, the broadest measure of economic growth
was 2.5 percent, down slightly from an earlier estimate of 2.6
percent. None of the figures pointed decisively to a slowdown or an
overheated economy. But there was speculation that the Federal
Reserve would move soon to hike interest rates if it viewed
inflation as a threat.
   _The Big Three automakers said vehicle sales jumped 15.3 percent
during the mid-December period, paced by a 35.9 percent leap in Ford
Motor Co. car sales. The performance reflected a major improvement
over the same time a year earlier, when consumers spooked by the
October 1987 stock market crash cut back on spending for expensive
items.

   Rep. Bud Shuster says it was a ``legitimate
public works project'' that led him to the Virgin Islands last week.
   But congressional sources said things seemed to happen in the
reverse order _ that the Pennsylvania Republican wanted to go the
islands, and dispatched aides to find a reason for the government to
send him there.
   Shuster toured an airport construction project before leaving St.
Thomas island on Wednesday following a four-day stay.
   Shuster, a member of the House Public Works and Transportation
Committee, had his trip to the island of St. Thomas approved
``without compunctions'' by Rep. Glenn Anderson, D-Calif., the
panel's chairman, according to committee aide Paul Schlesinger.
   The airport tour came after Public Works staff members had looked
into other projects for Shuster to inspect in the Virgin Islands,
including one on St. Croix, according to congressional aides who
spoke on condition of anonymity.
   While he was in the Virgin Islands, Shuster's top aides refused
to disclose his whereabouts.
   ``We're going to take this back to the voters. He did nothing
wrong,'' Shuster administrative assistant Ann Eppard said Friday.
She said the congressman knew nothing about staff members shopping
around for projects, and that if they did that, ``then it was not
initiated by the congressman.''
   She said Shuster was unavailable for an comment Friday.
   Interviewed by telephone Thursday from his rural central
Pennsylvania district, Shuster denied that the committee was paying
for the entire trip. He said the tour of the airport ``was an
official trip, and the committee pays for my airfare back. I spent
my own money staying.''
   Shuster said the Virgin Islands trip represented ``a couple days
off'' and that, ``It's none of your goddamned business what I do in
my personal time.''
   Schlesinger, the committee aide, said he was not aware that
Shuster had arranged to pay part of the cost.
   But Eppard said Shuster got only ``a one-day per diem and a
one-way (plane) ticket.''
   Like other committees, the House panel is free to sponsor its
members on fact-finding missions around the world. Shuster tacked
the Virgin Islands trip onto the end of a fact-finding trip to
Panama, Nicaragua, El Salvador and Honduras that he had taken with
three other House members of the Permanent Select Committee on
Intelligence.
   Shuster said he arrived in the Virgin Islands on Dec. 17, the day
after the intelligence committee concluded its fact-finding mission.
Asked why Shuster did not return home with the others, Rep. Bob
Livingston, R-La., said, ``He had other business to tend to.''
   Shuster, the second-ranking Republican on the Public Works panel
and a member of the subcommittee on aviation, inspected the Cyril E.
King Airport in St. Thomas on the same day as his trip home,
according to officials of the Virgin Islands Port Authority.
   ``This is construction of a completely new airport on an existing
airport. A lot of money has been appropriated for this project and
he wanted to understand what was being done and how far it had
progressed,'' said John Harding, executive director of the port
authority.
   Shuster termed it ``a legitimate public works inspection.'' He
said there has been a major cost overrun, and the Federal Aviation
Administration had cited the airport ``as being among the most
dangerous.''
   FAA spokeswoman Joann Sloane said in an interview Friday, ``From
what I can find out, it's not dangerous but they have a short
runway. There's a mountain on one side and water and other, and
they're building the new runway out into where the water is.''
   Shuster said aides did not disclose his trip because there was a
rule in his office not to reveal his itinerary for security reasons.
   Asked about Shuster's whereabouts earlier this week while he was
in the Virgin Islands, aide Karen Schecter had pointed to a wire
service photograph appearing in a Pennsylvania newspaper on Dec. 15
_ six days earlier _ showing the congressman in Managua, Nicaragua.
   The conservative Shuster, 56, was just elected to his ninth term.
In September, he was presented with his tenth Golden Bulldog Award
by a private, non-partisan group which presents awards for fiscal
integrity.

<HEAD>Last-Minute Plan Changes Meant Some Victims Got on Flight 103</HEAD>

   Ingrid Smith cut short a visit home to be with her
husband in New York, and got a last-minute seat on Pan Am Flight 103
because her husband was a pilot _ with Pan Am.
   ``The last we heard from Ingrid was when she rang from Heathrow
and said `Mum I have got on,''' said her mother, Hilda Ledgard of
North Hykeham in central England. ``We are devastated.''
   Like others rushing to be with family for the holidays or
changing their plans, the last-minute booking cost Mrs. Smith her
life.
   The jumbo jet en route to New York broke up at 31,000 feet
Wednesday night over Scotland, killing all aboard.
   Mrs. Smith, whose husband, Bruce, had previously captained the
same Boeing jet which crashed, had been visiting her parents when
she changed her plans.
   She at first wanted to stay because her mother was ill, but then
learned her husband was to be working over Christmas in New York.
With her parents' blessing, she went to Heathrow Airport hoping to
get on a flight.
   Flora Swire, a medical student, and Yvonne Owen, a social worker,
also wound up on Flight 103 by chance.
   A graduate in medicine from Oxford University, Ms. Swire was
traveling to Boston to spend Christmas and New Year with her
boyfriend, a doctor. She was studying for a doctorate at Nottingham
University.
   ``She went down to London on Monday and bought a stand-by ticket
for New York on Tuesday,'' her mother, Jane Swire, said from her
home in Bromsgrove, in eastern England.
   ``She was waved off from Heathrow by her younger sister,
Catherine, before boarding the flight,'' Mrs. Swire said.
   Yvonne Owen changed her plans to be with her boyfriend in Boston
and his sick sister.
   The 29-year-old from Bristol had planned to take her 18-month-old
daughter, Bryony, to Paris for the holidays, but decided instead
that she and Bryony would visit her boyfriend to help him take care
of his sister.
   The Stevenson family heading for Christmas holidays in the United
States also died in the crash, which left more than 20 people on the
ground in and around the Scottish village of Lockerbie missing and
presumed dead.
   John and Geraldine Stevenson and their daughters Hannah, 10, and
Rachel, 8, were to spend Christmas with relatives.
   ``We are all very shocked,'' said Fiona Wilkinson, who worked
with Stevenson at the regional office for the credit card company,
Visa International. ``He was a very popular, very effective member
of the staff.''
   A traffic jam near Frankfurt Airport proved fatal for U.S. Army
Lt. George W. Williams of Joppatowne, Md.
   His parents had surprised him with an early Christmas present of
a plane ticket home, and he was booked on a flight Tuesday. But he
missed the flight because of heavy traffic, and cajoled Pan Am
employees into giving him a seat on the next flight _ Flight 103.
   Williams, 24, ``called and told us he'd have to get on another
flight, and it turned out to be the one that crashed,'' said his
father, also named George.

<HEAD>Dolphin Rescue Effort Canceled</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The federal government has canceled an
effort to rescue a bottlenose dolphin from Broad Bay, but the head
of the rescue operation said Friday he remains worried the mammal
will die in the cold.
   Robert Schoelkopf, director of the Marine Mammal Stranding Center
in Brigantine, N.J., said the National Marine Fisheries Service
called off the rescue effort because the dolphin is not sick.
   ``The animal is considered not to be a stranding. It's healthy
and swimming,'' he said by telephone.
   The 6-foot-long dolphin known as ``Rascal'' led a rescue team on
a chase around the bay for two days as divers tried to net it to
move it to warm water. More than 50 volunteers and a dozen boats
participated in the operation that ended Thursday.
   Although the dolphin seemed robust, Schoelkopf said he is
concerned it will weaken as the water temperature dips below 42
degrees. Schoelkopf also said the dolphin may not find enough to eat.
   But Schoelkopf said he would take no more action unless invited
to do so by the federal government, which has authority over rescue
attempts.

<TEXT>
   Robbers preying on Southeast Asian immigrants
have held up at least a dozen people in the last week, and police
and community leaders are warning Asians to be careful and not carry
a lot of money.
   In one robbery, a Hmong woman lost a purse containing $5,500.
   ``The word is out that they carry money,'' police Capt. Carl
Johnson said.
   ``The facts speak for themselves,'' said St. Paul police
spokesman Paul Adlemann. ``These people are definitely being
targeted.''
   Two men arrested in the holdup Wednesday of two Hmong women in
north Minneapolis have been linked by photographs and a stolen car
to at least one earlier robbery, in St. Paul.
   But hours after the two were captured with the help of a Hmong
man armed with a shotgun, police said another Asian man was robbed
in north Minneapolis.
   Leaders of the area's Southeast Asian community have begun
holding meetings with heads of clans and families, warning them of
the hazards of carrying money and urging them to use banks.
   Ying Vang, executive director of the Lao Family Community of
Minnesota, said the group contacted 60 Hmong leaders and asked that
they call emergency meetings to discuss taking extra precautions.
   ``We told them to make sure people are aware of this rash of
robberies and to watch each other closely and make sure more do not
happen,'' he said.
   Southeast Asians living in some public housing projects also have
formed groups to patrol at night, he said.
   Vang Cheng Nengchu, a Hmong social worker, said, ``I think that
not everybody in the community is aware of the (recent robberies)
yet because of language obstacles.''
   Ying Vang said Hmong leaders were asked to encourage members of
the 15,000-person community, one of the nation's largest
concentrations of Hmong, to use banks. He estimated that 20 to 30
percent do not because of language barriers and unfamiliarity with
banking systems.
   Detectives in Minneapolis and St. Paul, meanwhile, are
investigating possible links among the dozen robberies, and say
there may be more they don't know of. Word of the robbers' success
has spread, they say, through news accounts and word of mouth on the
street.
   ``We know there's more going on out there, and the Hmong
community should know that they're more vulnerable by virtue of a
few successful robberies,'' Johnson said.

   A generous shopper turned a Salvation Army
kettle filled with coins into a real pot of gold by tossing in two
South African Krugerrands worth more than $800.
   The one-ounce gold bullion coins were not discovered in the pile
of nickels, dimes and quarters collected at a mall until they
arrived at a bank and jammed in a sorting machine, Salvation Army
officials said.
   Employees at Beaumont's First City National Bank, where the
Salvation Army deposits donations each night, found the coins
Thursday morning, said James Fortney, Salvation Army commander.
   The Krugerrands usually sell for slightly more than the current
value of their gold content, and together are worth an estimated
$824, he said.
   Salvation Army officials do not know who made the donation.

<HEAD>Authorities Say No Prosecution Likely in 11-Year-Old Stabbing Death</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Authorities say they believe a death row
inmate who says he killed a reporter but do not plan to prosecute
him.
   ``The various statements he made in his confession convinced us
he is in fact the responsible party,'' Robert Dakopolos, an
assistant Jackson County prosecutor.
   Anthony Joe LaRette, 37, of Topeka, Kan., said in a statement
that he killed Beverly Wortmann, a reporter for the Jackson County
Sentinel-Tribune in Blue Springs, in 1977. He also has been linked
to slayings of two other young women.
   LaRette has been sentenced to death for the 1980 slaying of
18-year-old Mary Fleming of St. Charles.
   Dakopolos said LaRette's statement said he was paid to kill Miss
Wortmann, 24, who was stabbed to death.
   ``He gave us absolutely no means of identifying who this second
person might be,'' Dakopolos said Friday. The prosecutor declined to
say how much LaRette claimed to have been paid.
   He said LaRette will not be charged because he is already
sentenced to die.
   Dakopolos said Kansas authorities have filed notice that they
plan to charge LaRette in the 1978 slaying of Tracey Miller, 26,
Manhattan, Kan. If it appears he might escape the death penalty in
the Fleming death or avoid prosecution in the Miller slaying,
Jackson County prosecutors would file charges in Wortmann's death,
Dakopolos said.

   A short but dense bank of fog was blamed
for a pileup of at least 28 cars that killed one holiday traveler
and injured 20 other people Friday morning, officials said.
   ``I was driving and the next minute, there it is,'' said Clinton
Gregory of Nashville, whose car was near the front of the mass of
smashed vehicles. He received minor injuries.
   Dana Knapp, 25, of Tulsa, Okla., was killed and her husband,
Joseph, 27, was injured, said Debe West, spokeskwoman at Cookeville
General Hospital.
   Ms. West said the 20 injured people _ including Joseph Knapp _
were all treated and released.
   ``We put some on a bus. One couple we sent by limousine service
to Nashville for a rental car,'' she said. ``Others have contacted
family members.''
   The accident occurred at 8:30 a.m. on Interstate 40, about four
miles west of Cookeville, said Highway Patrol Lt. Mason Black.
   Anita Wilborn of Blackstone, Va., was in the third car in the
pileup. She watched the accident start.
   ``This tan colored car, as soon as we hit the bank of fog, it
panicked and ran right in front of a navy colored van,'' she said.
``That van slammed on his brakes and hit the car. From then we
started braking and hitting each other in the rear end.''
   Black said it was unlikely that charges would be filed because
the fog made an accident almost unavoidable. ``They couldn't see
anything,'' he said.
   He said at least 28 cars were involved, but several were not
counted because they were only slightly damaged and drove away with
the permission of the first troopers on the scene.
   Black said the fog bank, about 500 feet long, cleared about an
hour after the accident.

   The Barnes family is spending Christmas at a
friend's townhouse while their home is repaired, and they are
rebuilding their lives as well after losing their daughter last
month in a spate of deadly tornadoes.
   ``We talk about it constantly,'' Libby Barnes said of the
twisters that ripped through their community Nov. 28, killing their
daughter, Janet, 9, and three other people.
   ``We laugh at things she did, we talk about things she did that
we wish she hadn't done.''
   Janet was a vivacious third-grader whose fate her parents, Walt
and Libby, brother Chip, 19, and sister Elizabeth, 16, are
struggling to accept.
   ``I'm just finding the whole concept of it kind of hard to
grasp,'' Elizabeth said as she and her family discussed their ordeal
Wednesday night.
   The family said they are trying to keep Janet's life in
perspective and avoid the temptation to think of her as saintly.
   ``She was just like these other two,'' Mrs. Barnes said,
gesturing at Chip and Elizabeth. ``So when people talk about her
being super-this or super-that _ well, she did have some really good
qualities, but she was a very normal 9-year-old child.''
   A few days after Janet's funeral, Walt Barnes spoke at a support
gathering at a nearby elementary school.
   ``The point I tried to make is that the weather has been around
this planet four and a half billion years, and we have been here a
relatively short time,'' Barnes said. ``And sometimes we get in the
way of the weather or the elements or the environment. It's not
something that's sent upon us. We wanted very much for the children
to understand that.''
   The family has been touched by the outpouring of support from
government and private agencies, their church, Walt Barnes'
colleagues at the state Department of Agriculture, Janet's school
and dozens of individuals _ many of whom they hadn't met before.
   One couple, Ray and Elizabeth Martin, offered the Barneses the
use of the townhouse and stocked it with food. Repair work has
started on their North Raleigh house, to which the family is
determined to return.
   ``At first, we weren't sure we wanted to do that,'' Barnes said.
But they decided not to let one night of horror overshadow the happy
years spent there. Other families are going back and ``that'll be
one of the tightest neighborhoods in this town,'' Barnes said.
   Chip said the restored house would be almost identical to the
original. ``It kind of symbolizes the family _ a few changes, but
we're still going on, not trying to freeze time,'' he said.

<HEAD>Parliament Passes Key Laws on Economy</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN DANISZEWSKI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The parliament on Friday approved bills to
encourge private ownership and foreign investment in an attempt to
reverse four decades of state economic control.
   The Communist government pushed the two pieces of legislation,
which become law Jan. 1, to radically alter the structure of
Poland's socialist economy.
   Poland's 460-member Sejm, or parliament, unanimously approved the
new Law on Economic Activity, which eliminates limits on the size of
businesses that can be privately owned. There were two abstentions.
   The foreign investment bill drew two ``no'' votes and six
abstentions, the official PAP news agency reported.
   Private business now accounts for about 6 percent of Poland's
non-farm economy, but Industry Minister Mieczyslaw Wilczek _ calling
the bills' passage a ``historic breakthrough'' _ has said he hopes
thousands of new businesses will open next year.
   The new law on economic activity removes past discrimination
against private ownership, treating state-owned, cooperative and
private businesses the same for legal purposes.
   Private businesses previously were limited in size to 50
employees and needed permission from administrative officials to
operate. Businesses could be turned down if a local official deemed
them unneeded or said they interfered with an existing state or
cooperative monopoly.
   But the new law removes any ceiling on the size of the work force
and allows individuals, cooperatives, partnerships and limited
liability companies to start and operate businesses as long as they
comply with safety, environmental and fire protection laws.
   However, 11 areas of activity _ such as weapons manufacture,
production and sales of pharmaceuticals and alcohol or operation of
sea and air transport _ will require prior government licenses
because they involve public safety.
   Firms are freed from the previous obligation to associate with
industrial or professional groups.
   Despite the government's high hopes for the legislation, there
were some doubts.
   ``To ... be able to invest in something, one has to have
something to invest,'' said an article Sunday in the weekly magazine
Wprost. ``The majority of Polish families spend their earnings on
current consumption and cannot afford'' to start businesses.
   Only ``richer citizens have now gained an opportunity to show
what they can do,'' the article concludes.
   The law on foreign investment combines and replaces two old laws,
one for investment by foreigners of Polish descent and one for
everyone else. In both cases the rules are now easier.
   A foreign investor must put up at least 20 percent of the
start-up cost of any business or joint venture, and the business
will be subject to a 40 percent income tax _ lower if the company
produces for export.
   Unlike previous laws, there are no requirements that majority
control and local management be Polish.
   Companies will have access to currency auctions where they can
convert profits earned in zlotys to hard currency at market rates.
They also will be allowed to sell to Poles in hard currency.
   Poland passed a foreign-investment bill in 1986 but businesses
considered its terms so unattractive that only about a dozen
companies took advantage of it.
   Authorities hope that Poland's low wage scale and skilled work
force will attract manufacturing and service facilities to serve
other European countries.
   The deputy prime minister, Ireneusz Sekula, presented the
legislation to parliament Thursday, saying the laws would become the
basis ``for freedom, equality and competition in the economy.''
   Departing from orthodox communist assumptions of an equal share
in the wealth for all citizens, he defined the state's duty only as
creating ``equal opportunity.''
   ``Further possibilities should depend on (people's) individual
achievements,'' he said. ``This is the only way one should
understand justice.''
   Parliamentarian Lucien Stepien said that in the context of
decades of ``Stalinist governing'' the new laws might seem
``revolutionary.''
   But in reality, he said, ``they are just an attempt to get back
to normal.''

   A 23-foot Bryde's whale rescued from the
Gulf of Mexico has responded to antibiotics and gained 175 pounds
since last month's stranding, scientists said.
   They hope to return the 2-year-old mammal to the Gulf in January.
   Sea World research biologist Dan Odell says he knows of no other
case in which a Bryde's whale survived a stranding and was returned
to natural habitat.
   ``We got lucky,'' he said, watching the two-ton mammal floating
in a pool at the marine attraction Thursday.
   A boater discovered the whale Nov. 25 in shallow water off
Honeymoon Island near Clearwater. During a daylong rescue it was
towed to shore, hoisted by crane into a truck and transported to Sea
World, 100 miles east.
   Bryde's whales, which grow to 40 feet, are usually found in water
more than 100 feet deep. Scientists don't know why the whale beached.
   Blood tests showed a generalized infection which is responding to
antibiotics. And with huge doses of vitamins and 105,000 calories
daily in herring gruel and high-calorie liquids, the whale has
steadily improved.
   At Sea World, the whale is hoisted out of the pool and tube fed,
a process that takes about 20 minutes. While it is being tube fed,
workers coat its back with a zinc oxide to prevent sunburn and dress
cuts.
   Experts are uncertain whether the whale will resume normal
feeding patterns once returned to the sea. They hope to transport it
75 miles out and attach a radio transmitter to track it.

   President Reagan on Friday mourned the victims
of the crash of Pan Am Flight 103 and insisted it would have been an
``impossible thing to do'' to warn the American public about all
threats against commercial airliners.
   Reagan and his wife Nancy then flew across the country for a
holiday stay at his soon-to-be retirement home in an exclusive Los
Angeles neighborhood after the president made his remarks in
Washington.
   The president, leaving the White House for his two-week
California vacation, also asked Americans to ``say a special
prayer'' this Christmas for the families and friends of those aboard
the plane and those killed on the ground at Lockerbie, Scotland, on
Wednesday. Some 280 people perished.
   ``I want to express our sorrow and concern to the families and
friends of those who died in the Pan Am crash ... There are
difficult aspects of this tragedy, but none so compelling as the
anguish of those families who will not have their loved ones with
them this Christmas season,'' Reagan said as his wife stood beside
him in the rain in Washington.
   The president noted that some three dozen students from Syracuse
University lost their lives in the fiery crash, calling them young
people who ``carried the twin promises of hopes and dreams.''
   ``The tragedy that steals the hopes and dreams from our society
magnifies the loss to our society,'' he said.
   A reporter asked Reagan whether all U.S. citizens, and not just
diplomats, should have been warned about a Dec. 5 telephoned threat
of terrorist attack against a Pan Am flight from Frankfurt.
   ``All the precautions that could be taken were taken with regard
to warning the airline and all,'' he replied.
   Of a possible public warning, the president added, ``I think that
would have been a virtually impossible thing to do on the basis of
that telephone call.''
   ``If you stop to think about it, such a public statement, with
nothing but a telephone call to go on, would literally have closed
down all the air traffic in the world,'' he said.
   Asked whether he had any new information as to whether the Pan Am
jumbo jet was the target of a terrorist bomb, he replied,``None of
this is established. The search still goes on. We have no knowledge
about how the accident happened. We're still trying to find out.''
   Phyllis Oakley, a State Department spokeswoman, said Thursday
that an unidentified person telephoned the U.S. Embassy in Helsinki
on Dec. 5 and said there would be a bombing attempt within two weeks
against a Pan Am aircraft flying from Frankfurt to the United States.
   Flight 103 originated in Frankfurt with a Boeing 727, with
passengers and luggage switched to a Boeing 747 in London for
continuation of the trip to New York.
   The Reagans flew to California aboard Air Force One to celebrate
Christmas in their new home in the posh Bel Air section of Los
Angeles and bring in the New Year at the estate of multimillionaire
publisher Walter Annenberg in Rancho Mirage, near Palm Springs.
   Mrs. Reagan took the president on a tour of the home after a
motorcade from Los Angeles International Airport. He exclaimed, ``I
am awed and I love it,'' according to assistant White House press
secretary Mark Weinberg.
   It was Reagan's second visit to the house, according to the first
lady. She has said she sneaked him out of their hotel on a previous
trip to Los Angeles and had him crouch on the floor of a White House
car to escape the attention of reporters.
   The president, who has spent 444 days in his home state since
taking office in January 1981, will return to the White House on
Jan. 5. After he leaves office Jan. 20, he and the first lady will
move to Bel Air.
   The $2.5 million home was purchased by California friends of the
Reagans, who are leasing it to them.

<HEAD>Police Bag Uzi-Toting Suspect At Bus Terminal</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A man who was being chased by police through the
Port Authority bus terminal Friday turned on his pursuers and tried
to pull a loaded Uzi submachine gun from his pants, police said.
   The gun got stuck.
   ``It's a rather large gun and this particular individual was
5-foot-3 and 220 pounds,'' said Officer Michael Terribile, one of
the arresting officers. ``It got stuck on some clothing. Thank God
it did.''
   The gun was fully loaded with 20 rounds of 9mm ammunition.
   ``One round was in the chamber ready to fire,'' said Terribile.
``It sounds funny but it could have been a really tragic situation.
The terminal was pretty full with holiday travellers heading out of
town.''
   The incident occurred about 2 a.m. after Terribile and Sgt.
Richard Murphy, both in plainclothes, arrested Rasheem McAllister
for allegedly carrying 163 vials of crack inside a resealed potato
chip bag.
   They had McAllister under surveillance for about 40 minutes and
noticed he kept putting down a red tote bag, walking away from it
and then coming back to it near the Greyhound bus terminal,
Terribile said.
   They saw him talking to a second man, and when they asked about
him, McAllister said, ```There's a guy out there with a gun and he's
going to kill everybody,''' according to Terribile.
   Terribile and Murphy were taking McAllister to the police desk
when they noticed a man coming down the opposite escalator.
McAllister did, too, and tried to duck.
   Terribile and Murphy chased the man and called to a third
officer, Ralph Williams, that ``this was the guy.''
   The suspect, identified as Chidiakl Knight, was fighting to get
past other people on the escalator while ``attempting to try and
pull the Uzi out of his waistband,'' Terribile said.
   The officers caught up with him at the bottom of the staircase as
the suspect continued tugging at the weapon, the officer said.
   Knight, 19, of Brooklyn, was arrested on charges of the attempted
murder of a police officer and second-degree criminal possession of
a weapon.
   McAllister, 19, of Brooklyn, was charged with first-degree
criminal possession of a controlled substance.

Friday by the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp.
   That rate was down slightly from a rate of 10.71 percent last
week, which had been the highest level for fixed-rate mortgages
since Aug. 19.
   On one-year adjustable rate mortgages, lenders were asking an
average initial rate of 8.45 percent this week, up from 8.43 percent

<TEXT>
   Salvador Dali remained in stable condition
Friday, one day after a slight intestinal lesion caused him to vomit
blood and suffer nausea, forcing the 84-year-old surrealist painter
back into a hospital, doctors said.
   Dali, last of a generation of famous Spanish artists that
included Pablo Picasso and Joan Miro, has been in frail health and
confined to a wheelchair since he was badly burned in a bedroom fire
in August 1984.
   He entered a local hospital with pneumonia on Nov. 27 and was
sent to a Barcelona hospital after his condition worsened with heart
trouble and blood clots in his left lung. Doctors had allowed the
artist to return to his mansion home in this town near the French
border on Dec. 14.
   Dr. Carles Punsati of the Figueras Hospital told Spanish
Television the painter was resting in stable condition Friday, with
no further bleeding, and maintained constant vital signs.
   ``If no complications arise, he should be able to go home within
three days or so,'' Punsati said.

<TEXT>
   Jurors in the Bess Myerson divorce-fixing trial
voted 9-3 in favor of conviction early on but finally decided the
prosecution's case wasn't strong enough, the panel's forewoman said.
   ``When we looked the other way and presumed innocence, it forced
us to realize that the (prosecution's) evidence didn't bear out,''
said Linda Berardi, the forewoman in the 12-week trial in U.S.
District Court.
   ``There was some feeling among us that something did happen _ but
it wasn't borne out by the prosecution,'' said Nelson Marty, another
juror.
   Late Thursday, the jury acquitted the former Miss America, her
lover, Carl ``Andy'' Capasso and retired judge Hortense Gabel on
charges they conspired to lower Capasso's alimony payments in return
for a $19,000-a-year city job for the judge's down-and-out daughter,
Sukhreet. Mrs. Gabel was handling the Capasso divorce case.
   The jury deliberated for four days before clearing the three on
all six counts of conspiracy, mail fraud, bribery and obstruction of
justice.
   Sukhreet Gabel's dramatic, comical and often contradictory
testimony as the prosecution's star witness wound up hurting the
government's case, Michael Feldberg, who represented her 76-year-old
mother, said Friday.
   ``I think the prosecution would have been better off if they
didn't call her,'' he said at a news conference. ``I don't think
they would have won anyway, but I think they would have been better
off without her because she turned the case into daytime television,
which is something far different than criminal law.''
   If U.S. Attorney Rudolph Giuliani had taken the time to
scrutinize what would happen to Sukhreet Gabel on cross-examination,
``he may have had second, third or perhaps, fourth thoughts about
bringing this case,'' Feldberg said.
   ``The real question in this case, it seems to me, is not whether
Sukhreet Gabel is a troubled person. Obviously, she has her
difficulties,'' he added. ``The real question is why prosecutors who
know these difficulties ... would prey upon them and use this young
woman to make a case against her mother.''
   He said Myerson's fame as a mover and shaker _ she was the city's
cultural affairs commissioner _ may have led the U.S. attorney's
office to bring the charges.
   ``There's a mentality that a lot of prosecutors have of, if the
target is prominent, it helps you in deciding you want to bring a
case,'' Feldberg said, ``and in this case, they had the most
prominent public woman in New York as a target.''
   Myerson, who Mayor Edward I. Koch credits with helping him win
his job 12 years ago, said after the verdict that she was ``grateful
for the American judicial system'' and thanked the jury for
exonerating her.
   She was not available for interviews on Friday, said her
attorney, Fred Hafetz. ``I think she's just resting up a little bit,
recouping from the trial.''
   Mrs. Gabel said that in her 19 years as a judge, the trial was
``the best judicial experience I've had.''
   Capasso, who is serving a sentence for tax evasion, was returned
to a Pennsylvania prison.
   Hafetz said he didn't know Myerson's immediate plans. He said the
trial generated ``a lot of bad publicity'' for her, but added,
``Hopefully this verdict _ a clear verdict vindicating her _ will
restore her to a position where she is going to be able to make a
significant contribution to our lives.''
   ``She's been through hell ... I wish her only well,'' the mayor
said Friday. ``I believe our 25 years of friendship will continue,''
said Koch, who denounced her as a friend after an investigation he
ordered blasted Myerson for hiring Ms. Gabel.
   The mayor's offer of friendship did not extend to a job offer.
Asked if he would invite her to rejoin his administration, Koch
said, ``I think that's over with. I think she has new fields to
conquer.''

   Victor F. Weisskopf of Cambridge, Mass. and
Richard B. Setlow of Upton, N.Y., will receive the Energy
Department's Enrico Fermi Award for 1988, the department announced
Friday.
   The award, a gold medal and $100,000 for each, is given for
``exceptional and altogether outstanding'' achievement in the
development, use or control of atomic energy.
   Weisskopf, 80, is a professor at Massachusetts Institute of
Technology. His citation said he was being honored for ``many unique
contributions to particle and nuclear physics, and to physics in
general as a researcher, educator and statesman of science.''
   Setlow, 67, is a biophysicist on the staff of the Brookhaven
National Laboratory. He was honored for ``pioneering and
far-reaching contributions to the fields of radiation biophysics and
molecular biology, beginning with the discovery and
conceptualization of the processes of DNA repair that have had an
impact on research in genetics, recombination, mutation and
carcinogenesis.''
   The award is named for the late Enrico Fermi, who fled fascist
Italy for the United States before World War II and who achieved the
first self-sustaining nuclear chain reaction in 1942 during the
Manhattan Project, which developed the atomic bomb.

<TEXT>
   Museum curators out for a spin
in John Lennon's 1960's-era limousine found a canister of film
stashed under the passenger's seat.
   One scene on the 8-millimeter print shows a man playing a piano
painted in psychedelic colors similar to the paint job on the Rolls
Royce limousine, and curators are hoping their find is misplaced
Beatles memorabilia.
   Lee Manhas, gift shop manager at the Historic Transportation
Centre in suburban Cloverdale, said she was driving the car when the
film was found by museum staff member Roger Giguer.
   ``He said, `There's something here.' He kicked it, reached down
and pulled out the canister. We were amazed,'' she said.
   The 30-minute film has only been viewed on a very small editing
screen and no faces could be identified, said museum spokesman Fred
Davies. He described the film's contents as outtakes, shot possibly
in Boston in the 1960s.
   ``There's sunsets, an eclipse, an old stone church and about
eight men and women inside and outside buildings,'' besides the
piano shot, he said. ``It's a real mystery.''
   Handwritten on the film canister are the words ``Phil Loomis.
Orson Welles Film School.''
   Davies said he planned to invite experts on Beatle history to
look at the film for clues to determine who made it.
   Vancouver businessman Jim Pattison bought Lennon's vintage 1965
Panther V Rolls for $2.9 million, and it has been on display at the
center since Pattison gave the car to the provincial government
after the Expo 86 world's fair.

<HEAD>KGB and Police Chiefs Say Ethnic Violence Still Plaguing Caucasus</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The KGB and national police chiefs on Friday called
for tougher measures to control ethnic violence that still plagues
Armenia and Azerbaijan despite a month of curfews and army patrols
in the republics, Tass reported.
   The official news agency said KGB chief Vladimir Kryuchkov and
Interior Minister Vadim Bakatin, head of police and troops charged
with keeping order at home, met with other officials to review the
special measures taken Nov. 23.
   On that day, a dusk-to-dawn curfew was put in effect in certain
parts of Armenia and Azerbaijan to quell ethnic violence that killed
at least 31 people.
   Residents of Armenian and Azerbaijan, neighboring Soviet
republics in the Caucasus Mountains, have been at odds historically
for cultural and religious reasons. Most Armenians are Christians
while most Azerbaijanis are Shiite Moslem.
   The Soviet prosecutor's office has filed more than 30 criminal
cases in court stemming from the violence, and investigators
continue to uncover more wrongdoing, Tass said.
   ``At the same time, the situation in the republics remains
complex,'' Tass said. ``Incidents of violence, thefts, instigatory
calls for hurting citizens' rights for national signs, for
disobedience to authorities are still being permitted.''
   It said special concern was generated by crimes committed in the
area of northwestern Armenia devastated by an earthquake on Dec. 7.
   Aside from criticizing ``extremists'' and ``hooliganistic
elements,'' a statement released after the meeting blasted law
enforcement authorities for not stopping the violence. It said
unspecified punitive action was taken against some authorities.
   The statement promised that the full force of law will be used to
stop violence and attempts to spread ethnic hatred.
   Earlier, this month authorities in the Armenian capital, Yerevan,
arrested at least six of the 11 members of the Karabakh Committee,
an unsanctioned political group agitating for Armenian control of
part of Azerbaijan.
   In February, Armenians launched a campaign of demonstrations and
strikes to gain control of Nagorno-Karabakh, a predominantly
Armenian territory in Azerbaijan. The central government in Moscow
has refused to accede to Armenians' demands.
   At the end of February, 32 people, mostly Armenians, were killed
in the first major eruption of violence in the dispute. New violence
broke out last month, and more than 180,000 people have fled their
homes and crossed the border of the two republics.

<TEXT>
   Leftist rebels attacked the
heavily guarded Defense Ministry with car bombs and
catapult-launched explosives on Friday, killing at least three
people and wounding at least 35, officials said.
   The assault on the military headquarters compound and on a nearby
government health clinic appeared to be part of a major rebel
offensive against the U.S.-backed government of President Jose
Napoleon Duarte.
   Also on Friday, unidentified terrorists blew up a biology
laboratory at National University in San Salvador and shot to death
a night watchman, a school official said. The 35,000-student
university, the biggest in the nation, has been the scene of recent
demonstrations by leftist students.
   Witnesses said four car bombs exploded just outside the Defense
Ministry and at a health clinic 50 yards down the road in this
capital city. A 20-foot-high wall surrounds the compound, which also
houses the headquarters of the armed forces joint chiefs-of-staff.
   Defense Minister Gen. Carlos Eugenio Vides Casanova told a news
conference homemade bombs were also launched from catapults. A
military officer, speaking on condition of anonymity, said three
projectiles fell inside the compound.
   Vides said casualties included 25 passengers in a passing bus who
were wounded in the late morning explosions.
   Dr. Alfredo Galan Avalos, director of the clinic, said flying
glass from car bomb explosions injured 10 health workers. About 60
people work in the clinic, which had about 20 patients at the time
of the attack, he said.
   The defense minister said the three people were killed in the
attack and homemade bombs destroyed four vehicles and three
buildings.
   ``These are acts of terrorism, acts of desperation because the
people have rejected them (the guerrillas). This is nothing more
than a bombardment of the civilian population,'' Lt. Alberto
Navarrete, an army officer, told reporters.
   One victim, 35-year-old Luis Andrade, was running from the
initial blasts when another vehicle exploded, killing him instantly,
his mother, 60-year-old Inez Andrade, said. She said the explosion
blew his leg off.
   The mother said she sat stunned on the ground next to her son's
severed limb until a neighbor brought her a plastic bag minutes
later. She said she put the leg in the bag, got up and walked away,
picking up more pieces of her son's body and placing them in the bag.
   Pools of blood, shattered furniture and smashed glass lay on the
clinic floor.
   Ana Miriam Lopez, 52, said had just left a bus and was across the
street when the first car bomb went off.
   ``It scared me out of my wits,'' she said, sobbing. ``My
grandchildren play right over there. By the grace of God, nothing
happened to them.''
   It was the first attack on the Defense Ministry since the
guerrillas launched their war to overthrow the government in October
1979. The conflict has killed an estimated 65,500 people.
   Terrorists set off three bombs at National University, blowing up
a biology laboratory, a school official said, speaking on the
condition of anonymity. They also shot to death watchman Roberto
Aguirre, he said.
   No one claimed responsibility and police said they had no clues.
University Rector Luis Argueta Antillon accused the military, the
government and right-wing terrorists of responsibility, but offered
no evidence.
   Five provincial town mayors resigned on Friday, bringing to 12
the number of mayors who quit in the past three months after
guerrilla death threats.
   The rebels killed nine mayors in 1988, saying they ``executed''
the mayors for their part in installing ``the U.S.-imposed
counterinsurgency plan.''

   A Yugoslav relief flight to the earthquake zone in
Soviet Armenia crashed Dec. 12 because the pilots set the
Soviet-built plane's altitude instruments improperly, a Soviet
investigator said Friday.
   The crash at Yerevan, the Armenian capital, killed all seven
people on the An-12 transport. It was the second plane crash in the
international relief airlift that followed the Dec. 7 earthquake
that killed at least 55,000 people.
   A plane carrying Soviet soldiers crashed the day before while
approaching to land at the quake-ravaged city of Leninakan, killing
the 78 people aboard.
   Izvestia, the government newspaper, quoted the head of a
commission investigating the Yugoslav crash as saying ground
controllers gave the pilots correct information but they did not
confirm receiving it and the controllers did not request
confirmation.
   Rudolf Teimurazov, the commission chairman, said the pilots did
not set their altimeters or prepare for landing by extending landing
gear and wing flaps, Izvestia reported.
   ``It is absolutely obvious that the Yugoslav pilots were in a
hurry,'' the paper commented. ``This is understandable: they wanted
to deliver the quake relief supplies as soon as possible.''
   Shortly after the crash, the official Yugoslav news agency Tanjug
quoted a Yugoslav pilot who landed at Yerevan later as saying the
accident may have resulted from a misunderstanding between the crew
and ground controllers.

   The chief judge in the trial of
confessed TWA hijacker Mohammed Ali Hamadi said Friday that another
American witness will be asked to travel to West Germany and testify.
   Richard Young Moon, a physician, sat near U.S. Navy diver Robert
Stethem, who was beaten and killed during the hijacking.
   Hamadi is charged with murder and air piracy in the June 1985
commandeering of TWA Flight 847 to Beirut, in which 39 Americans
were held hostage 17 days. He admits being one of the hijackers, but
denies killing Stethem.
   Chief Judge Heiner Mueckenberger said Moon would be asked to
testify when the trial resumes Jan. 17 after a holiday recess.
   According to court records, Moon sat near Stethem after the diver
was beaten and before he was killed. Stethem was shot behind a
closed curtain and no one has testified to seeing who killed him.
   More than two dozen American passengers and crew have testified
since the trial began nearly six months ago, describing how Hamadi
and the other hijacker, identifed in court records as Hassan
Ezzeddine, beat Stethem and other passengers.
   Also at Friday's session, Mueckenberger discussed a defense
motion made Dec. 13 that President Hafez Assad of Syria and Nabih
Berri, leader of the Shiite Moslem militia Amal in Lebanon, be asked
to testify.
   Gabriele Steck-Bromme, a defense lawyer, said at the time she
wanted Assad and Berri to be questioned about what she called a
pledge by U.S. authorities not to prosecute the hijackers if the TWA
airplane hostages were released.
   Berri was instrumental in negotiating the release and the
hostages were taken to Damascus, capital of Syria.
   Mueckenberger said Friday he did not feel testimony by Assad or
Berri had ``any meaning'' in the case and doubted either would come
if asked.
   U.S. officials denied when the hostages were released that any
deal had been made.

<HEAD>Smokestack Device Could Help Solve Acid Rain Problem</HEAD>

<DATELINE>AUSTIN, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A research company has developed a
smokestack device far more effective than those now in use at
removing sulfur dioxide, the chief cause of acid rain, a University
of Texas engineering professor says.
   Leonardt Kreisle said the ``synergistic reactor,'' developed by
Aerological Research Systems with help from UT engineering students,
removes virtually all sulfur dioxide from smokestack emissions.
   ``Dry-air scrubbers'' now in use are more expensive to make and
use and remove only 60 percent to 70 percent of the chemical, he
said.
   Thomas Ewan, president of Aerological Research in Daingerfield,
said the company has a prototype that can remove 10 pounds a minute
of sulfur dioxide _ too little for a power plant _ but plans to
build one big enough to remove 5,000 pounds of sulfur dioxide a
minute for power plants and factories.
   Sulfur dioxide is a byproduct of steel manufacturing, refining
and coal burning. It combines with nitrous oxide, sunlight and rain
to form acid. The government has said that a solution to the acid
problem will cost billions of dollars.
   The patent application for the device was accepted by the
government in November. Ewan said the company is negotiating with
manufacturers to produce the devices for the market next year.
   ``We've not looked at the price yet,'' he said, ``but it will
cost a lot less than conventional scrubbers. The design is quite
simple even though the operation is sophisticated.''
   Kreisle said he is not a participant in the patent and has no
financial stake in the device.
   He said it is a fraction of the size of comparable dry-air
scrubbers, operates on about a third of the energy, acts more
quickly, and leaves only dry gypsum, or chalk, as a byproduct.
   The reactor is housed in a steel tube 24 feet long and 6 inches
in diameter and is designed to replace the uppermost part of a
smokestack.
   Gases formed by burning of coal and other organic materials enter
a reactor chamber filled with steam and ground lime. A resulting
chemical action removes the sulfur dioxide, according to the
developers.

   President Reagan on Friday officially
proclaimed Jan. 16 as Martin Luther King Jr. day, saying the slain
civil rights leader's ``work is not done, but neither is his witness
stilled.''
   ``We must reaffirm in every generation the lessons of justice and
charity that Dr. King taught with his unflinching determination, his
complete confidence in the redeeming power of love and his utter
willingess to suffer, to sacrifice and to serve,'' the president
said.
   The day is a federal holiday and also is a holiday in some states.

   The government announced Friday it will
allow the 5-year-old state of emergency to lapse next month, hoping
that Sinhalese radicals will stop engaging in violence and join the
democratic process.
   ``It is our present intention not to extend the emergency when it
lapses on Jan. 15,'' the national security minister, Lalith
Athulathmudali, told a news conference.
   He said the government will also consider releasing 2,200
political prisoners and reopening schools and universities closed
for up to three years due to the violence.
   The emergency was imposed in May 1983 in an effort to quell an
insurgency by minority Tamils against the Sinhalese majority that
has left 8,500 people dead. Parliament has extended the emergency
every month since then, giving security forces sweeping powers to
search homes, arrest and detain people without charge and shoot
violators.
   For 17 months, the extremist Sinhalese group the People's
Liberation Front has waged a campaign to overthrow the government,
saying it conceded too much to the Tamils in a 1987 peace accord.
   The accord provides for limited autonomy for the Tamils and
places 47,000 Indian peacekeeping soldiers on Sri Lankan soil.
   The Tamils, who are mostly Hindus, complain they have been denied
jobs and education by the Sinhalese, who run the government and the
military.
   Tamils comprise 18 percent and the predominantly Buddhist
Sinhalese make up 75 percent of the island's 16 million people.
   Prime Minister Ranasinghe Premadasa, a Sinhalese, was elected
president last Monday and called on Sinahlese extremists to end the
violence and join the democratic process. Parliamentary elections
are to be held Feb. 15.
   Athulathumadali said he did not know whether extremists responded
to Premadasa's appeal for peace but added: ``Incidents of violence
appear to be less and there seems to be no clear rejection to the
open, wide-angled request for them to come into the political
mainstream.''

<TEXT>
   Nearly a year after a polygamist clan began
a fatal confrontation with the law, a jury's verdict has ended
another chapter in a saga begun 15 years ago on the family's
northern Utah homestead.
   The homicide convictions of three young clan members, said one
prosecutor, puts to rest the ``legend of John Singer,'' whose 1979
death at the hands of Utah lawmen triggered the bombing of a Mormon
chapel last January and the clan's 13-day armed standoff at their
Marion farm.
   An eight-member 3rd District Court jury in Coalville on Thursday
convicted clan patriarch Addam Swapp, 27, and Singer's son, John
Timothy Singer, 22, of manslaughter in the death of state
Corrections Lt. Fred House, gunned down during a botched arrest that
ended the siege.
   Addam's brother, Jonathan Swapp, 21, was convicted of negligent
homicide. Singer admitted firing the fatal shot and Jonathan said he
also shot his rifle, but Addam Swapp, who was seriously wounded by
an FBI sharpshooter, insisted he never fired.
   ``It's over,'' said Assistant U.S. Attorney Dave Schwendiman, who
also prosecuted the trio and Singer's widow, Vickie, in federal
court last spring.
   ``They just simply can't bring John Singer out to justify what
they have done and want to do,'' he said. ``It's over, and if this
year hasn't proved that in spades, nothing will.''
   It was 1973 when John Singer, a German immigrant and
excommunicated Mormon who embraced polygamy and other Mormon
fundamentalist beliefs, pulled his children from public schools he
believed were rife with dangerously liberal teachings.
   But the decision to keep the children out of school embroiled him
in an escalating dispute with the law, and in 1979, one of several
deputies trying to serve an arrest warrant felled him with a shotgun
blast when he purportedly brandished a pistol.
   Clan members believe Singer was shot in the back as part of a
conspiracy among lawmen and the Mormon Church, which banned polygamy
in 1890.
   Vickie Singer kept her six children on the farm, although
Singer's second wife left. In 1980, the farm became home to Addam
Swapp, also an excommunicated Mormon, whose married two of Mrs.
Singer's daughters.
   The ensuing years brought a series of troubles, including feuds
with neighbors over water rights and an accident that left John
Timothy Singer a paraplegic. A federal judge dismissed Mrs. Singer's
wrongful death lawsuit in 1987, fueling the family's distrust of
secular and religious authority.
   Summit County Sheriff Fred Eley said Addam Swapp further
antagonized the community late in last year when he began sending
fiery letters to state and local officials, accusing them of
murdering Singer and containing religious references to bloodshed
and destruction. Eley obtained an arrest warrant after Swapp fired a
gun into the air when Eley went to the farm to talk to him.
   Swapp remained holed up on the farm until the night of Jan. 16,
when he planted 87 sticks of dynamite in the chapel, an act he said
was a divinely inspired signal for Singer's resurrection and the
fall of a corrupt church and state. It was the bombing of the chapel
that touched off the siege that ended in House's death.
   ``John Singer never would have blown up a church or done anything
like that,'' Eley said. ``I could see where John was coming from,
and I saw Addam as nothing more than a terrorist.''
   Sentincing on the state convictions was set for Jan. 20.
   Addam Swapp faces a sentence of five years to life, as does John
Timothy Singer. Jonathan Swapp faces a maximum of a year in jail.
The three already have received federal sentences of 10 or 15 years
for the bombing convictions. Mrs. Singer is serving a five-year
federal term; she was not charged in state court.
   Swapp, who wept as he held two of his sons after the trial, did
not make a public statement after Thursday's verdicts. But his elder
wife, Heidi, said she still believes in her husband's cause and in
his innocence.
   ``This is in God's hands,'' she said. ``Only God knows the
truth.''
   The Singer-Swapp family remains on the farm in Marion, said
Swapp's attorney, Bill Morrison. The family has been peaceful, but
Eley said their neighbors still keep watch for any unusual activity.
   ``How long it will last, I don't know, Eley said. ``I hope it's
over, and maybe they do, too. Maybe they've been through enough.''

<HEAD>Officers To Stand Trial For Allegedly Terrorizing Crack Dealer</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Eight police officers accused of terrorizing crack
houses have been ordered to stand trial for allegedly entering an
apartment illegally, then covering up their actions. Two also are
accused of force-feeding a dealer crack cocaine.
   The officers ``tried to do something legal in an illegal way,''
36th District Court Judge R. Patrick Donahue said Thursday in
ordering the trial. ``They conducted what I believe was a police
raid without a search warrant.''
   But defense lawyers protested that a trial would hamper Detroit's
war against the highly addictive drug by making officers hesitant to
aggressively pursue dealers.
   ``When police officers start playing it very, very, very safe,
the city becomes very unsafe,'' said Thomas Howard, attorney for
Cedric Scott, 27, who along with Ricardo Darbins, 22, is charged
with assault for allegedly forcing an admitted dealer to eat 20
``rocks'' _ little chunks _ of crack.
   All eight officers were charged with entry without permission, a
misdemeanor, and with conspiracy to conceal a crime, a felony. They
have been suspended without pay since August.
   In the Feb. 21 incident, officers entered an apartment where the
dealer, Steven Johnson, was alone. He contends police beat him.
   Then, when six of the officers left, the remaining two made him
eat the crack, he testified at a two-week preliminary hearing.
   The eight are also accused of breaking into another home, also
suspected to be a crack house, the same night, and assaulting its
occupants.
   Johnson, 26, said he had sold $100 worth of crack cocaine the
night of Feb. 20 and had cash and 20 bags of crack on a living room
table when police with drawn guns came in.
   Another witness who was in an apartment across the hall from
Johnson, testified to overhearing someone say, ``Eat this .... If
you don't, I'll take you to jail,'' followed by laughter.
   Wayne County prosecutors say Johnson may have saved his life
after police left by drinking vinegar to induce vomiting. He was
treated for a cocaine overdose at Detroit Receiving Hospital.
   A trial date was not set, but arraignment was scheduled for Jan.
13 in Recorders Court.
   The officers, free on $10,000 personal bonds, left the raids out
of their reports and logs, a violation of department policy,
prosecutors say.
   ``The police, in carrying out their duties, are required to
follow the law just like everybody else,'' said Wayne County
Assistant Prosecutor Patrick Foley.

   Emperor Hirohito responded with gestures to
questions by doctors Friday and palace officials said his relatively
stable condition over the past few days showed he retained some
physical energy.
   The 87-year-old monarch has been bedridden and seriously ill for
more than three months.
   ``He responded to yes-or-no-type questions with gestures
(Thursday) night and today,'' Kenji Maeda, Imperial Household Agency
spokesman, told a news conference Friday.
   Later, Maeda said Hirohito's condition remained largely
unchanged, but that palace physicians have not eased their daily
24-hour vigil.
   Hirohito's eldest son, Crown Prince Akihito, visited his father
Friday.
   Akihito, who is next in line for the throne, marked his 55th
birthday Friday in a quiet ceremony with his family, Maeda said.
   The prince has assumed nearly all of his father's formal duties,
which are mostly ceremonial.
   Recent reports in local news media described Hirohito as nearly
comatose, but the palace officially acknowledged only that he spent
much of his time sleeping.

   Spyros Papadatos, the government-appointed
bank commissioner investigating the biggest financial scandal in
Greece's history, died Friday of a heart attack. He was 53.
   Police said Papadatos was declared dead upon arrival at an Athens
hospital after being stricken at home.
   He had been scheduled to release on Friday a list of depositors
at the Bank of Crete, including state enterprises, as part of his
investigation.
   Papadatos, an official of the nation's central bank, was
appointed to investigate the widening scandal at the Bank of Crete
on Oct. 18.
   In a preliminary report, he disclosed that at least $300 million
of bank funds were either missing or mismanaged and accused the
bank's chairman, George Koskotas, of fraud and embezzlement.
   Koskotas, 34, was suspended as chairman but fled Greece on Nov. 6
and eventually went to the United States, where he was arrested. He
is in a Boston jail awaiting an extradition hearing.
   The scandal has implicated ranking members of Premier Andreas
Papandreou's socialist government, prompting seven ministers to
leave. Several quit to protest government handling of the
investigation, alleging that a cover-up was under way to protect
senior Socialist Party officials.

<TEXT>
   A former anti-war radical who was a fugitive for
17 years was released Friday from a federal halfway house after
serving a 17-month term for trying to bomb a University of
Washington ROTC building at the height of the Vietnam War.
   Terry Jackson, 46, who changed his name from Silas Trim Bissell
during his years on the run, said in a telephone interview that he
was released Friday morning from the halfway house program in
Cleveland.
   Jackson, whose family founded the Bissell carpet sweeper company,
still must perform 90 days of community service. He said he plans to
begin work Jan. 3 at the Cleveland Society for the Blind to fulfill
that requirement.
   After that, he and his wife, Ruth Evan, will head for Eugene,
Ore., he said. It was in Eugene that he built a new life for himself
as a physical therapist during the years he was a fugitive.
   Jackson, a poet-turned-radical who helped found the group the
Weather Underground, was accused along with his then-wife, Judith
Emily Bissell, of conspiring to damage federal property by placing a
bomb at the University of Washington's Air Force ROTC building on
Jan. 18, 1970. The bomb did not explode.
   The couple fled from custody in 1970 and eventually separated.
Judith Bissell was arrested in 1977 and was convicted on federal
charges in 1979. She was sentenced to three years in prison.
   After the man known as Terry Jackson was arrested in Eugene in
January 1987, a number of his friends there pledged money and
property for his bail, and nearly 200 letters were sent to the court
on his behalf.
   He pleaded guilty May 1, 1987, in federal court here to
possession of an unregistered destructive device and in Superior
Court to a second-degree assault charge on a Seattle police officer
during a November 1969 anti-war demonstration.
   Jackson was sentenced to two years in federal prison and in
August 1987 began serving time at the Lompoc Federal Corrections
Institution in California. He was released to the Cleveland halfway
house Sept. 22.
   Jackson, who married Ms. Evan while in prison, said he's been
working in a cafeteria at the halfway house run by the Salvation
Army. Though released from the program, he said he'll continue
working at the cafeteria another week before starting at the Society
for the Blind.
   Although Jackson said he could return to physical therapy, ``I
suspect I won't do that. My main energies will be directed toward
painting and writing.
   ``I have various options for things to do for survival money, but
none of those are firm.''

<HEAD>Town Holds Memorial To Remember Christmas Eve Tragedy</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CALUMET, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The holiday spirit will take on a somber
tone Saturday when this community remembers 73 people, most of them
children, who were crushed to death or suffocated at a Christmas Eve
party 75 years ago.
   The town council voted this week to hold a memorial service at
the site where 57 children and 16 adults died. They were killed in a
human stampede after someone yelled a false fire alarm at a party
sponsored by a union group at the height of a bitter strike.
   ``I don't suppose it will ever heal,'' said amateur historian
Jack Foster.
   At the time of the tragedy, members of the Western Federation of
Miners had been on strike for 10 months over the Calumet and Hecla
Mining Co.'s decision to switch from two-man drills to one-man
drills. The union said the new drill was unsafe.
   In the weeks before the disaster, two company guards chased a
striker into a boardinghouse and fired gunshots, killing two men;
three non-union Canadian miners were gunned down as they slept; and
miner and a guard were killed in another shootout.
   On Christmas Eve, the union's women's committee held a party for
the children of striking miners on the second floor of Calumet's
Italian Hall, above a saloon.
   While the party was under way, witnesses said, someone from the
first floor stairwell shouted out a fire alarm. Children and adults
raced to escape, tripping over each other to get into the stairwell
and out the only exit.
   Witnesses said the victims were crushed to death or suffocated
before anyone realized what was happening.
   ``I was so scared,'' said Lena Rigotti, an 88-year-old Hurley,
Wis., nursing home resident who survived the tragedy. ``I told my
sister, `Stay with me and we'll get home.' I don't know how we ever
made it.'''
   Nobody ever found out who sounded the false alarm, Foster said.
The disaster heightened tensions so much that National Guard troops
were ordered out to keep the peace, and a congressional
investigation was held.
   The union called a halt to the strike that next spring.
   Bob Pieti, chairman of Calumet's downtown development authority,
said most residents would like to forget the tragedy. But at
Saturday's non-demoninational prayer service and candlelight vigil,
the names of the victims will be read to remember the dead.
   Peggy Germain, a former Calumet council member, said the disaster
still is a touchy subject.
   ``The death certificates blame `persons unknown,' and some of the
stories are so insidious that I understand why over the years people
in the town didn't want to talk about it,'' she said.

<HEAD>Homeless Activist Found Guilty Of Trespassing For Occupying Vacant
House</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Homeless activist Dorothy King was found guilty
Friday of trespassing for occupying a vacant, federally owned house
last August with a group of homeless women and children.
   King, 36, was given a 10-day suspended sentence. She could have
faced up to 180 days in jail and a fine of $999.
   King, who ran a shelter for the homeless that has since closed,
led a group of 14 women and 26 children from her shelter who spent a
weekend in the house last August. She was arrested after refusing an
order to leave; the other protesters left voluntarily.
   The vacant building was the property of the U.S. Department of
Housing and Urban Development, which had obtained it when the buyer
defaulted on a federally backed mortgage.
   On Aug. 16, one day after King's arrest, HUD agreed to make 55
more homes available to qualified homeless shelter providers in
Colorado. Before then, 14 homes had been made available to the
Colorado Coalition for the Homeless, but King said they were all
full.
   King and her attorneys argued she acted under duress because of
her commitment to Denver's homeless. She testified Thursday that
``there was no shelter or afforadable housing'' in the area at the
time of the protest and she ``didn't know what else to do.''
   ``They can arrest me if I'm a criminal for trying to find these
people a house,'' she recalled telling the arresting police officers.
   Prosecutors maintained the case was a clear-cut one of
trespassing.
   ``You will hear that Dorothy King works for the homeless. She
cares for the homeless. She is deeply concerned about the
homeless,'' said Assistant City Attorney Diane Dash on Thursday.
``In the course of caring deeply about the homeless, this defendant
broke the law.''
   Earlier in the week, Denver County Court Judge Raymond Satter
denied King's motion to use a ``choice of evils'' defense, which
would have allowed her to be acquitted if the jury found she
trespassed to prevent a greater evil _ in this case, homelessness.
   The last witness to testify in the trial on Friday morning was
Gloria Roybal, a former homeless woman who broke into tears while
describing to the court her life on streets and in shelters.

   An Air India jumbo jet bound for New York with 250
people aboard returned to London on Friday after a bomb threat, and
a Heathrow Airport terminal was evacuated after officials spotted an
unattended suitcase.
   Nothing suspicious was immediately found on the plane, the
airline said.
   The incidents came hours after a British Airways Tristar, which
was forced to make a 10-hour unscheduled stop in Rome because of a
bomb threat, arrived at Heathrow Airport, the airline said.
   The bomb-related incidents followed Wednesday's explosion of a
Pan Am Boeing 747, bound for New York from London, over the Scottish
village of Lockerbie.
   At Heathrow, large crowds of Christmas holiday travelers waited
for their flights Friday apparently undeterred by the crash of the
jumbo jet.
   There was no indication of any increase in security, which is
considered to be on a continuous high level, and there appeared to
be no new security checks.
   Air India in New York received a bomb threat from an anonymous
caller after its Boeing 747 left Heathrow for New York at 2:59 p.m.,
an airline spokesman said, speaking on condition of anonymity. The
threat was passed to the captain, who decided to return to Heathrow,
the spokesman said.
   The 747 landed and taxied to an isolated area southwest of the
terminals, the British Airports Authority said. Passengers left the
plane normally and were taken by bus to a terminal.
   Hours later, the airline announced it had not yet found anything
suspicious during a search of the plane. It offered the passengers
seats on another flight Saturday morning.
   Earlier Friday, an unattended suitcase in a terminal at the
airport prompted authorities to evacuate hundreds of Christmas
travelers, airport officials said.
   A bomb squad found only clothing in the suitcase. Police said
they were told a man had walked into the terminal, left the suitcase
and departed.
   In the British Airways incident, authorities closed Rome's
Leonardo da Vinci airport for 20 minutes Thursday while the plane
made an emergency landing and its 242 passengers and 12 crew were
removed.
   No bomb was found. A caller to the airline's London office said a
bomb was on board, said airline spokesman Michael Blunt.
   Flight 146 originated in New Delhi, made a stopover in Kuwait and
was flying to London when it was diverted.

   Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi came home
Friday after five days in China and said his visit restored the
friendly Indian-Chinese relations of the early 1950s.
   Also Friday, about 100 Tibetan students outside Parliament set
fire to a Chinese flag and denounced India's recognition of Tibet as
part of China. Police with bamboo canes watched the rally but did
generally not interfere.
   Gandhi told a news conference at New Delhi's international
airport, ``I believe this visit will be a new beginning for both
countries.''
   A border dispute has strained relations between China and India,
the world's two most populous countries, for nearly three decades.
China has more than 1 billion people, and India has about 800
million.
   Gandhi's visit to Beijing was the first by an Indian prime
minister since his grandfather, Jawaharlal Nehru, visited China in
1954.
   The two countries issued a communique in Beijing earlier Friday,
agreeing to set up a joint working group to take up the territorial
dispute, which led to war in 1962. Gandhi said the group would set a
time frame in which to resolve the issue.
   The communique also said Chinese Premier Li Peng has accepted an
invitation to visit New Delhi, but no date was set.
   China claims 36,000 square miles of mountainous frontier that
India says is part of its Arunachal Pradesh state. India also says
China illegally occupies 14,500 square miles in India's Kashmir
state.
   Gandhi also told reporters that Chinese leaders respected India's
views on Tibet, another sore point in relations. China invaded
mountainous Tibet in 1949 and annexed it a year later.
   The communique noted that China ``expressed concern over
anti-China activities by some Tibetan elements in India,'' and that
the Indian side had repeated its policy of recognizing Tibet as a
part of China and banning Tibetans from carrying out anti-Chinese
political activities on Indian soil.
   India has granted asylum to the Dalai Lama, Tibet's religious
leader, and thousands of his followers who fled Tibet after an
abortive uprising against Chinese rule in 1959. Beijing blames
supporters of the Dalai Lama for pro-independence activities that
led to clashes with police in the last 14 months.
   India and China on Thursday signed three agreements _ a civil
aviation accord calling for direct flights between New Delhi and
Beijing, a three-year cultural agreement, and a science and
technology pact.

<HEAD>U.S. Forces Close Firing Range After Complaints</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. military forces in Japan said Friday they were
halting all live firing training at an Okinawa range where neighbors
complained that bullets strayed into nearby residential areas.
   The announcement by U.S. Forces Japan did not refer directly to
complaints that followed exercises Oct. 15 at a Camp Hansen firing
range on the southern Japanese island.
   But it said ``senior U.S. officials have expressed deep regret
over recent incidents and have emphasized the respect and
appreciation American military forces feel for the people of Okinawa
and their culture.''
   After local officials said nine bullets were reported found in a
village opposite the range's target area. No one was reported
injured, but two Foreign Ministry officials went to Okinawa last
month to talk with U.S. generals and inspect firing ranges.
   The announcement also said that demonstration flights by F-15 jet
fighters at Kadena Air Base, also on Okinawa, were suspended
indefinitely. It gave no reason.
   Maj. Anthony Rothfork, spokeman for U.S. forces in Japan, said
safety regulations for other firing ranges had been reviewed,
permanent safety officers would be present for all live firing
training, the direction of firing would be restricted, and safety
education would be increased.
   Weeks after the firing range complaints, a U.S. Navy ship fired
practice shells that landed about 330 yards from a Japanese Coast
Guard vessel near the entrance to Tokyo Bay. The Navy immediately
expressed regret, and relieved the ship's skipper of command.
   But the Foreign Ministry lodged a protest with the U.S. Embassy,
and Japanese newspaper editorials published blistering editorials.
   About 64,000 U.S. troops are in Japan under a security treaty.
About 35,000 of them are stationed in Okinawa, an island of 1.2
million people.

   The cockpit recording of Pan Am Flight
103's final minutes ended with a brief, mysterious ``faint noise''
and gave no sign that the pilots knew their Boeing 747 was doomed,
investigators said Friday.
   Conversations captured by the ``black box'' that records all
cockpit activity was normal up to the ``faint noise at the end which
needs a bit more analysis,'' said Paul McKie, a Department of
Transport spokesman.
   Mick Charles of the department's Air Accident Investigation
Branch, who is heading a team of 40 U.S. and British investigators
at the crash site, said: ``We have no evidence whatsoever yet of
sabotage.''
   The plane, flying from London to New York, broke up at 31,000
feet Wednesday night, killing all 258 people aboard and bombarding
the Scottish countryside with flaming wreckage over a 10-mile radius.
   Flowers arrived at the scene Friday. A passenger who had left the
flight at London sent a bouquet to a child flying on to New York,
with the message: ``To the little girl in the red dress who lies
here, who made my flight from Frankfurt such fun. You didn't deserve
this.''
   Suspicions of sabotage were prompted by the inexplicable sudden
breakup of the plane, a claim of responsibility and disclosures that
the U.S. government had been warned of a plot to bomb a Pan Am
flight between Frankfurt and New York in December.
   Flight 103 originated in Frankfurt with a Boeing 727, and
switched to a Boeing 747 from London's Heathrow Airport.
   Soldiers hacked open the nose section, lying on its side in a
field, and removed the bodies of crew members on stretchers and
under tarpaulins.
   From 20 to 30 relatives of victims arrived in Lockerbie, the
Scottish village that bore the brunt of the crash, and 155 bodies
were placed in makeshift morgues in the town hall and ice rink.
   The relatives included at least seven Americans. They were
advised against visiting the wreckage, said Superintendent Angus
Kennedy, a police spokesman in Lockerbie.
   More than 600 police and military personnel spent Friday scouring
the countryside for bodies and wreckage, but only one more body was
found. Kennedy said whether it was of a passenger or ground victim
was not known.
   Fourteen adults and three children were missing in the Lockerbie
area and there was no word on the occupants of three cars hit by
wreckage and gutted on a nearby highway, Kennedy said.
   He said it had been learned the driver of a fourth car was
treated for injuries Wednesday night and released, and the driver of
a fifth car was a villager and counted among the 17 residents listed
as missing.
   Arc lights and heavy lifting equipment were brought in to speed
the search. Searchers moved shoulder to shoulder across fields and
marshes, trying to collect every scrap of evidence.
   A faint smell of aviation fuel lingered.
   During the night, a party of Jewish youths clambered over the
rubble, apparently searching for holy items like prayer books that
might have been with Jewish passengers and require ritual burial.
   All indications were that the plane broke up in seconds, and that
the cockpit never knew of the imminent catastrophe.
   ``There were no abnormal noises on the (cockpit recorder's) tape
until the signals ended abruptly with the aircraft cruising at
31,000 feet,'' said McKie.
   There was ``nothing in the conversations to indicate anything was
wrong,'' he said, adding that no conclusions could be drawn yet from
the noise at the end of the tape.
   On Thursday, Transport Secretary Paul Channon said the plane's
radar blip on the Scottish ground control screens ``split into
several returns'' before vanishing.
   Charles told a news conference the wreckage was ``spread over a
very, very long wreckage trail,'' but added this did not indicate
sabotage. The spread was normal, given the plane's altitude and the
115-knot winds at 31,000 feet.
   People have found papers, clothing and mail up to 70 miles from
Lockerbie. Three teen-age boys found a bundle of $500,000 in
travelers' checks in the hills near their home six miles from
Lockerbie, police said Friday.
   ``To try and prejudge this case would be totally wrong. There are
obviously a number of potential causes for an in-flight breakup. We
are looking for evidence to try and point us in the right direction.
To suggest that it would be one or the other at this stage would be
wrong,'' Charles said.
   President Reagan sent a message to the 2,500 people of Lockerbie
saying: ``Our hearts go out to you on this tragic occasion which
marred what should have been a season of joy.''
   Frank Park of the local district council wrote back: ``Our small
community has suffered much but our sadness is even greater when we
think of the loss of so many people from the United States. Our
thoughts are with their friends and relatives wherever they may be.''
   A newspaper Friday quoted a security source as saying
investigators were taking ``very seriously'' a group's claim of
responsibility.
   The Independent quoted the source as saying the group is thought
to have sought revenge for the July 3 downing of an Iranian jetliner
by a U.S. warship in the Persian Gulf.
   An anonymous caller to The Associated Press in London claimed
Thursday the Guardians of the Islamic Revolution was responsible for
the crash.
   A political dispute arose over the Transport Department's
disclosure that it knew of a bomb threat two weeks before the crash
but did not pass it on to Heathrow or the public.
   U.S. officials told British officials that an anonymous caller to
the U.S. Embassy in Helsinki, Finland, said Dec. 5 that a bomb would
be planted aboard a Pan Am flight from Frankfurt to the United
States within two weeks.
   Transport Minister Michael Portillo said it was ``confidential,
classified U.S. intelligence information and we didn't have the
right to divulge it.''
   He said the warning prompted an assessment of Heathrow security
for U.S. flights. The security was judged to be appropriate.
   Also on Friday:
   _An Air India jumbo jet bound for New York with 250 people aboard
returned to London after Air India in New York received an anonymous
bomb threat, officials said. The plane was evacuated at Heathrow but
the airline said nothing suspicious was found.
   _An unattended suitcase found at Heathrow forced hundreds of
Christmas travelers to evacuate one of four terminals for nearly an
hour, but it was found to contain only clothing, officials said.
   _A British Airways Tristar arrived at Heathrow after making a
10-hour unscheduled stop in Rome because of a bomb threat.

<HEAD>Snow Promises A White Christmas Eve In West, Upper Midwest</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Winter storms spread snow across much of the West and upper
Midwest on Friday, with Minnesota, Utah, Colorado, and Nevada
getting the heaviest accumulations.
   Winter storm watches were posted for Saturday for upper Michigan,
southeastern Wisconsin, northern Illinois and eastern Iowa; and
across much of Oregon, northwestern Nevada and the mountains of
northern and east-central California.
   Snowfall for the past two days was particularly heavy in Nevada.
Up to a foot of snow fell around Lake Tahoe, near Reno and in the
northern mountains late Thursday and early Friday. A storm Thursday
produced 25 inches of snow in the Sierra portion of the Lake Tahoe
area.
   In Utah, Alta was blanketed with about 12 inches since Thursday
night and up to 7 inches of new snow covered the ground at Kanab. In
Colorado, 11 inches of snow fell at Wolf Creek, while Telluride and
Delores received 6 inches.
   Oregon's Cascade and Siskiyou mountain passes were forecast to
receive as much as 18 inches of snow from the storm.
   Elsewhere, the northern half of Minnesota was hit with as much as
6 inches at Roseau and 4 inches at Crookston.
   Snow also fell in central and southern New England and in eastern
New York state, and was scattered in Upper Michigan and Wisconsin.
Rain reached from eastern Pennsylvania across western South Carolina
and northeastern Georgia, and was scattered in the Pacific Northwest.
   Temperatures around the nation at 2 p.m. EST ranged from 8
degrees at Caribou, Maine, to 81 degrees at West Palm Beach, Fla.
   An inch of snow fell at Salt Lake City during the six hours
ending at 1 p.m. EST. Heavier rainfall during the same six hours
included 0.96 inch at Centerville, Ala., and Lafayette, La.; 0.82
inch at Millville, N.J.; 0.61 inch at McComb, Miss.; and 0.56 inch
at Baton Rouge, La.
   Saturday's forecast called for rain showers across much of the
nation east of the Mississippi; snow from Iowa across southeastern
Wisconsin and upper Michigan; and rain becoming snow in higher
elevations, extending from the Pacific Coast across the Great Basin,
the northern Plateau and the northern Rockies.
   High temperatures were forecast in the teens and 20s from
Wisconsin across the upper Mississippi Valley, the northern Plains,
the upper Missouri Valley, the northern half of the Rockies and much
of Idaho into eastern Washington; in the 30s and 40s from New
England across the remainder of the Great Lakes, the central
Mississippi Valley, the central Plains, the southern half of the
Rockies, the rest of the Plateau and the northern half of the
Pacific Coast; in the 70s from southern Texas to the South Carolina
coast; the low 80s in southern Florida; and in the 50s and 60s
across most of the rest of the nation.

   The former chairman of Dartmouth's board
of trustees said Friday that he did not influence a disciplinary
panel that suspended two student journalists although he was unhappy
with their publication.
   At a court hearing to determine whether the two stdents should be
reinstated, Norman McCulloch testified his initial reaction to the
off-campus, conservative Dartmouth Review was favorable.
   ``I thought it was extremely important to have a conservative
viewpoint demonstrated and published on campus,'' McCulloch said in
Grafton County Superior Court. ``But I became really disenchanted
when the Review began to go away from a focus on the issues and
began to focus on personalities.''
   McCulloch said, however, that he did not try to influence the
campuswide disciplinary board that suspended former Review editors
Christopher Baldwin and John Sutter for 18 months in March.
   Baldwin, 21, of Hinsdale, Ill., and Sutter, 22, of St. Louis want
Judge Bruce Mohl to let them return to school before their
suspensions expire in September. Mohl is expected to rule before
classes resume Jan. 3.
   They and two other students were accused of harassing music
professor William Cole during a classroom confrontation after a
Review article disparaged Cole's course.
   Cole, who is black, once was described by the Review as looking
``like a used Brillo pad.'' He testified this week that he
considered the latest Review criticisms racially motivated, a charge
denied by Sutter and Baldwin.
   The hearing ended Friday after the judge prevented the school's
lawyer from trying to show that the former editors sought a heavy
penalty in order to generate more publicity for their case.
   Mohl ruled as irrelevant an attempt by Dartmouth lawyer James
Middleton to show that Baldwin and Sutter intentionally sought the
18-month suspension.
   Middleton argued it was ``extremely relevant'' because it was
``important to get a maximum suspension and therefore to get maximum
press exposure.''
   The students' lawyer, Harvey Myerson, disputed Middleton's claim,
calling it ``one of the most extraordinary things I've ever heard.''
   When the hearing began Monday, Myerson said the suspensions had
national implications because of their chilling effect on college
journalists nationwide. But Mohl also called that argument
irrelevant.
   The two students argue that Dartmouth discriminates against
conservatives, disciplining them for infractions more harshly than
liberal students, a charge college officials deny. Two lawsuits, one
in state and one in federal court, have been filed against the
school based on this allegation.

<TEXT>
   While there may be no quick answers to the
tragedy of Pan Am Flight 103, the wreckage scattered across the
Scottish countryside has left enough clues to make it virtually
certain the cause will be found, aviation experts said Friday.
   As more information surfaced, specialists noted the similarities
between Wednesday's crash of the Boeing 747 in Scotland that killed
all 258 people aboard and leaving at least 17 people missing on the
ground, and the crash three years ago of an Air India jumbo jet off
the Irish coast.
   Indian officials after months of retrieving wreckage from the
ocean floor concluded that a bomb exploded aboard the Air India
jetliner. An explosion is widely believed to have caused the Pan Am
plane to crash, although no conclusive evidence of a bombing has yet
surfaced.
   Both the Pan Am and Air India planes were cruising routinely at
31,000 feet and suddenly disappeared from radar. In neither case did
the flight crew declare an emergency or make any radio contact with
air traffic control. In both cases, the planes broke up in the air,
scattering wreckage over five or more miles.
   In both crashes, the recording from the cockpit gave no
indication the pilots were aware of any unusual, but contained a
muffled sound in the final split second of tape.
   That sound became crucial in the Air India investigation. The
final report on the accident concluded: ``From the sounds found
recorded on the CVR (cockpit voice recorder) and the (air traffic
control) tapes it appears that an explosion had occurred on board
the aircraft.''
   Authorities in Scotland announced Friday that a preliminary
review of the CVR tape from Pan Am Flight 103 also ends with a
muffled sound a fraction of a second before the recorder went dead.
   ``There is nothing in the conversation (of the pilots) to
indicate anything was wrong,'' said a British spokesman, reminiscent
of the Air India findings.
   Paul McKie, spokesman for the Department of Transport, cautioned
that further analysis will be required before it can be determined
what the noise might be and warned not ``to jump to any
conclusions.''
   More sophisticated spectrographic examination of the tape likely
will provide a better clue as to whether the sound is an explosion
from a bomb, or a breakup of the aircraft because of a sudden
decompression. Similar sounds have been heard on CVR taps in other
accidents when aircraft experienced major structural failures,
officials said.
   U.S. aviation experts, including several who have been involved
in investigating scores of air disasters, are confident the answers
will be found.
   ``It will be a massive job to reconstruct the pieces,'' said
Ronald Schleede, chief of aviation accident investigation at the
National Transportation Safety Board. ``But they're going to solve
it because the evidence will be there.''
   ``We will know what brought down Pan Am 103,'' FAA Administrator
Allan McArtor said, but he cautioned ``it could take months.''
   Neither McArtor nor Schleede, who has been briefed daily by
telephone by NTSB officials at the crash site, would discuss
specifically the Pan Am findings so far.
   But Schleede and other experts noted in interviews that the Pam
Am crash investigators have some advantages.
   For example:
   _While the crash caused an inferno in the small Scottish farming
town of Lockerbie, destroying a row of houses, most of the aircraft
_ with the exception of a destroyed right wing whose fuel tank
exploded _ appeared to have escaped serious fire damage.
   In many crashes where a plane remains intact and burst into
flames, critical clues are lost because of the intense heat that
bends metal and destroys evidence.
   _The wreckage, although strewn across the countryside, is not _
as was the case of Air India _ in hundreds of feet of water and
exposed to elements that could destroy critical evidence.
   _The cockpit voice recorder and flight data recorder appear to be
in good shape.
   In the coming days, investigators will pay close attention to how
parts of the aircraft are bent, tangled and singed and whether there
is evidence of a chemical residue normally left by an explosive.
   They also will search for fragments that might have been used as
a detonator and closely examine luggage and parts of luggage as well
as aircraft wreckage holes left by flying fragments. Such holes
leave a distinctive pattern if caused by an explosion, one expert
said.
   Some of the wreckage will be reassembled as closely as possible
to the original aircraft and metallurgists will try to determine how
the pieces broke apart. Was it from metal fatigue or from being torn
apart. Which part of an aircraft broke first? Did the pieces break
apart along specific seams of the aircraft's skin?
   The flight data recorder, which monitors the performance of the
aircraft, and the cockpit voice recorder will be examined and their
times coordinated. A key question is whether all of the plane's
electrical systems were knocked out simultaneously, one veteran
investigator said.
   It is known that Pan Am Flight 103 in rapid order lost its radar
transponder, radio contact and both flight and cockpit voice
recorders, this investigator said.
   If all of these functions failed simultaneously, there is strong
evidence of a massive electrical failure, possibly cause by an
explosion near the forward baggage compartment, which is adjacent to
the electrical and computer systems on the Boeing 747, experts
suggested.

   In a high school gymnasium against a
backdrop of honor rolls dating back four decades, a Royal Air Force
officer dispatches helicopter crews to hoist bodies and wreckage
from the Scottish countryside.
   In the school's library, where children's paintings are taped to
the book shelves, Pan Am staff cluster around Flight 103's passenger
lists, trying to match bodies to names.
   Outside the town hall, which contains more than 80 bodies, are
typewritten lists of villagers evacuated from their homes when the
Boeing 747 fell from the sky.
   So while the town hall is now a morgue, the red-brick Lockerbie
Academy, the town's only high school, has become headquarters for
the search and investigation operation for Britain's worst ever air
crash.
   The 900 students, from surrounding villages, are on Christmas
vacation.
   Their school has been taken over by the First Battalion of the
Royal Highland Fusiliers, one of Scotland's oldest regiments.
   They have set up operations on the school hall stage. Officers
work under a board bearing the regiment's name and its previous
title, Princess Margaret's Own Glasgow and Ayrshire Regiment.
   People drift by and stop to read the list posted outside the town
hall. A policeman on guard tries to be reassuring. ``Just because a
name isn't there doesn't mean they're dead,'' he tells each person
who looks at the list.
   Indeed, on Friday a Lockerbie woman listed as missing turned out
to be staying with relatives.
   But police list 17 other villagers as missing, and the fate of
occupants of three cars that were gutted by falling debris on the
nearby highway was not known. Authorities updated their list of
missing saying the driver of one car hit by flaming wreckage was
treated for injuries and released, and the occupant of another
vehicle had been counted twice.
   The rest of the 155 bodies collected by nightfall Friday are in
the Lockerbie skating rink.
   Flowers are piling up outside the makeshift morgues. A passenger
who left the flight in London sent a bouquet to a child flying on to
New York with the message:
   ``To the little girl in the red dress who lies here, who made my
flight from Frankfurt such fun. You didn't deserve this.''
   Paper Christmas decorations made by the pupils dangle from
exercise bars in the school hall. Class blackboards carry lists for
dog handlers, helicopter crews and police who scour the countryside
for bodies and debris.
   Soldiers in camouflage uniforms and berets with the distinctive
white cockade of Scottish regiments trudge out with spades or drive
away in army trucks.
   During the night, Jewish youths from Gateshead in northern
England clambered over rubble, apparently looking for fragments of
holy items belonging to Jews on the plane. They were sent here by
the Gateshead Hevre Kadisha, or burial society.
   Police from the Dumfries and Galloway county force, which with
350 uniformed officers is the tiniest in Britain, mingle with police
from forces throughout Scotland.
   Officers from the huge neighboring county force, the 7,000-member
Strathclyde Constabulary, have arrived in the hundreds to help out
in Lockerbie.
   In an upstairs classroom, with lesson timetables and
advertisements for performances of the Scottish National Youth
Orchestra pinned to notice boards, the head of the Dumfries force,
John Boyd, confers with senior officers.
   The largest classroom is packed with rows of computers into which
police and civilian personnel feed every scrap of information
brought back from the crash site in Lockerbie and sprawling out to a
10-mile radius around the town.
   Anything that is found _ from the vital flight recorders
chronicling the airliner's last moments, to a scorched Christmas
card addressed to addresses in the United States _ are logged into
the computers.
   ``It's called Holmes. That stands for Home Office Large Major
Enquiry System,'' said Superintendent Angus Kennedy, Strathclyde's
press officer.
   Kennedy said the local force didn't have such a system, and the
computers were brought from Strathclyde and other forces.
   ``They've never had anything like this _ there's never been
anything like this in Scotland,'' he said.

   Paul Channon, the British
transportation secretary, arrived in Barbados for a Caribbean
vacation Friday. His department is in charge of investigating the
Pan Am crash in Scotland.
   Britain's opposition Labor Party said it was ``unbelievable'' of
Channon to take a holiday during the investigation into Britain's
worst aviation disaster.
   The jumbo jet broke up in the air Wednesday night and crashed
into the village of Lockerbie, killing all 258 people aboard.
   Channon and his wife Ingrid were met on the tarmac by the airport
manager and walked directly to the arrival hall, making no comment.
   He was seen checking in with Mustique Airways and was believed to
be flying to the tiny island about 40 miles away. Mustique, in the
Grenadines chain, is a popular getaway isle for such famous people
as Mick Jagger and Princess Margaret, sister of Queen of Elizabeth
II.
   The British Embassy in Barbados said it had no information on
Channon's visit because he was not on official business.
   In London, the Trade Ministry said he would be kept informed on
the investigation and planned to return soon after Christmas, but
would fly home earlier if necessary.
   John Prescott, the Labor Party transport spokesman on
transportation, said: ``It is unbelievable. It is quite intolerable
and totally insensitive for the transport secretary to leave for his
holidays so soon after Britain's worst aviation disaster, when
bodies are still being retrieved and a major security review is
under way.''
   Prescott said Margaret Thatcher, the Conservative prime minister,
should ``call him back immediately'' and declared: ``Such lack of
judgment should justify his removal.''
   Geoffrey Dickens, a Conservative member of Parliament, said Labor
was ``trying to make capital out of other people's misery and
death.''

   Speculation that an explosion may have caused a
Pan American World Airways jet to crash in Scotland has prompted the
Federal Aviation Administration to issue a call for increased
security at airports worldwide, officials said Friday.
   FAA Administrator Allan McArtor told reporters that the security
alert was sent to airlines, foreign governments and major airports
both in the United States and abroad on Thursday.
   He said it was prompted by a combination of factors, including
the Pan Am crash Wednesday, the heavy Christmas travel rush and
``what obviously can be considered a heightening of world tensions''
as it pertains to terrorist activities.
   The alert was not prompted by any single threat or piece of
intelligence information, officials said.
   McArtor, in an interview with a small group of reporters,
declined to discuss specifically the Pan Am crash that killed all
258 people aboard a Boeing 747 jumbo jet and leaving at least 17
people missing on the ground. The plane apparently broke apart in
the air, possibly because of a terrorist bomb.
   The crash came two weeks after the FAA sent the State Department
a bulletin warning that Pan Am might be the subject of a terrorist
bombing on its flights from Frankfurt, West Germany. The Boeing 747
that crashed was Flight 103, which had originated at Frankfurt.
   Disclosure of the FAA bulletin in early December _ the 23rd such
alert this year _ has prompted questions over whether such notices
should be shared with the public.
   President Reagan said earlier Friday that a public warning based
on an anonymous telephone call _ as was the case with the alert
involving Pan Am _ would have been an overreaction. It ``would
literally have closed down air traffic in the world,'' Reagan said
in answer to a reporter's question.
   McArtor praised Pan Am's response to the alert at the Frankfurt
airport, saying the airline had imposed ``a very heightened level of
security.'' He said Pan Am's precautions at London's Heathrow
Airport, from which Flight 103 departed 54 minutes before the crash,
were still under review.
   At Frankfurt, McArtor said, Pan Am briefed gate personnel about
the possible threat, kept ground baggage handlers and caterers
``under constant surveillance'' and checked all luggage by X-ray
instead of only at random. All passengers and their bags also were
matched prior to boarding, he said.
   McArtor said that while there is no hard evidence of sabotage in
connection with Flight 103, he is concerned about the possibility
that a bomb could be placed aboard the jetliner at two airports
where security precautions are among the best in the world and where
a heightened alert was in effect.
   ``If there was a door (of opportunity for terrorists) left open,
we've got to find out what allowed that and close that door,'' he
said.

   President-elect George Bush has written
President Daniel Ortega saying he wants to work toward strengthening
world peace, the leftist Sandinista government said Friday.
   The Nicaraguan rebels issued their Christmas message Friday,
vowing not to lay down their arms until there is democracy.
``Certainly it will be a sad Christmas but the near future is filled
with hope,'' said the Contras, as the rebels are known.
   A statement from Ortega's press office said Bush's letter was in
reply to a message of congratulations Ortega sent Bush on his
election in November.
   The New York Times recently quoted Ortega as saying he would
present a peace proposal to Bush but insisted any talks with the
United States center on security issues, not Nicaragua's internal
politics.
   For the past eight years, the United States has pressured the
Sandinistas to undertake democratic reforms and to cut their
military ties with Cuba and the Soviet Union. Washington has
supported the Contras since 1981 as part of that campaign.
   The Sandinistas came to power in a 1979 popular revolution that
overthrew rightist President Anastasio Somoza, promising to install
a ``democratic, pluralistic'' government.
   U.S. officials and opposition leaders accused the Sandinistas of
pursuing repressive policies, including national emergency laws of
1980-87 that imposed press censorship and restricted individual
freedoms.
   In 1981, the Reagan administration cut off all economic aid to
Nicaragua.
   Three years ago it imposed a trade embargo, saying Nicaragua was
a beachhead from which to spread communism in Central America.
   U.S.-Nicaraguan talks in 1985 to explore ways of improving
relations ended in deadlock.
   Friday's statement, published by the Sandinista newspaper
Barricada under the title `Message From Bush To Daniel,'' said
Ortega received the vice president's letter on Thursday.
   ``Among other concepts, President-elect Bush said he
enthusiastically looked forward to working to strengthen world
peace,'' it said.
   The Contras' message, read by telephone from the group's offices
in Miami, said the rebels will only lay down their arms ``in
exchange for a real democracy.''
   ``Our combatants maintain their discipline and are ready to
defend the honor of the nation,'' the Contra statement said. ``It is
not Nicaraguan to try to impose a slave regime when Nicaragua wants
liberty.''
   In other developments, government technicians speaking on
condition of anonymity said work on an eastern port that could
receive huge arms shipments was dealt a serious setback by
sedimentation from Hurricane Joan in October.
   Nicaraguan economists have said the government, strapped by a
severe economic crisis, does not have the resources necessary to
finish the deep water port known as The Bluff.
   Also on Friday, the pro-government newspaper El Nuevo Diario said
the Soviet Union donated a TU-154 jetliner and granted state-run
Aeronica airline credits to buy two AN-32 passenger planes. It put
the cost of the three airliners at $52.8 million.
   The TU-154 can carry 141 pasengers will be used international
routes. The AN-32s will be used on domestic flights, replacing older
American planes which cannot be serviced due to lack of spare parts
arising from the U.S. trade embargo.

<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Marion Phyllis Crocker, adventurous
descendant of the railroad-building family that linked the American
coasts in the 19th century, has died. She was 98.
   Crocker, who died Sunday at home, was the first society woman in
the city to go to France in World War I to drive an ambulance,
remaining with the American Field Service Committee until long after
the armistice.
   She was the daughter of Henry J. Crocker, a banking and oil
businessman of the day, and his wife, Mary Ives Crocker. Her
grandfather, Clark Crocker, helped build and run the Central Pacific
Railroad.
   After World War I ended, she wrote friends: ``I stood with the
crowds on the Avenue Bois de Boulogne and joined the cheers as
President Wilson went by.''
   Some 30 years and another war later, she toiled at home for
creation of the United Nations.
   Early in life she demonstrated her craving for excitement,
proving it with a flight aboard a flying boat over San Francisco in
1911. The trip, she told friends, hadn't frightened her at all.
   The following year, she poo-poohed the complaints of an Army
officer that he had been forced to make an arduous three-day,
90-mile horseback ride by setting out to better him. She began on
her father's stallion, switched to her own, then finished on a pony
from the family ranch, traveling 102 miles in 14 hours.
   Crocker never married. Private family services were held.

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A self-styled Santa driving a Mercedes-Benz
copied his Cadillac-driving counterpart Friday and doled out $10
bills to a hoard of Skid Row homeless.
   The cigar-smoking Samaritan, wearing a bright red, three-piece
suit and a crimson fedora, ``said he read about the Cadillac Santa
and thought he could do better,'' said Clancy Imislund, spokesman
for the Midnight Mission.
   The Mercedes man's outpouring of altruism followed by a day the
seventh annual visit to the mission by a secretive philanthropist
known as the Cadillac Santa, who also shares holiday cheer with
street dwellers in the form of cold, hard cash.
   The latest well-heeled Santa handed out about $3,000, while the
Cadillac-driving benefactor spent about twice as much. The Cadillac
Santa gave out more largely because the homeless have learned to
gather and wait for him after seven years.
   The Mercedes Santa's warmth made up for his gaudy outfit,
Imislund said.
   ``With a red suit, red tie and red fedora, it was the most
God-awful getup you could imagine, but his heart was in the right
place and nobody cared what he was wearing,'' he said.
   ``He was ho-ho-hoing like nobody's business, and just like the
other one, wouldn't reveal who he is.''
   The Midnight Mission serves 1,650 meals a day to homeless men,
women and children, Imislund said.

   Bitterness took hold Friday among friends and relatives of the
Pan Am crash victims over the possibility the tragedy was a
terrorist attack, and many wondered at the coincidences by which
some people and not others were aboard.
   If terrorists are responsible, ``They should kill them. Who are
they to take their political problems out on innocent civilians?''
said Colgate University student Chris Quinn, who lost a fellow
student in the crash.
   The Boeing 747 en route to New York from London crashed into a
Scottish hamlet Wednesday, killing all 258 on board.
   The dead included business executives, 35 students taking part in
a Syracuse University study abroad program and others coming home
for the holidays.
   NBC News reported that one of the victims was the CIA's chief of
station in Beirut, Lebanon, but State Department spokeswoman Sondra
McCarty said she had no information on any victims being employees
of the intelligence agency.
   Three State Department employees died in the crash, including two
junior employees assigned as security officers, and political
officer Matthew K. Gannon, of Orange, Calif., spokeswoman Phyllis
Oakley said earlier Friday.
   Gannon, assigned to the department's Middle East bureau, was
returning home upon completion of assignment in Beirut as a
political officer. He had previously worked in North Yemen, Jordan
and Syria, Mrs. Oakley said.
   Calls by The Associated Press to the CIA were not immediately
returned.
   Also among the victims were an Army navigator heading home for
the funeral of his sister; a soldier flying home to be with his
father while he awaited surgery, and a cabin attendant who planned
to retire after the flight.
   Traffic jams, a ticket mixup and a final exam that lasted too
long were among the twists that saved the lives of others who nearly
took Flight 103.
   The State Department warned U.S. embassies Dec. 7 of a bomb
threat against Pan Am jets out of Frankfurt, where Flight 103
originated. Pan Am and law enforcement authorities were notified,
but no public warning was issued.
   President Reagan on Friday said a public warning would
``literally have closed down all the air traffic in the world.''
   ``I certainly think the public should have been warned. They also
had a responsibility to find out if the threat was true. If it was
true they should not have let anyone get on,'' said Genevieve
Walters, whose son Richard Cawley, 43, of New York, was killed.
   ``To know how she went, and to know they might have known
something like this was going to happen, it would make any mother
mad,'' said Barbara Matthews Weedon of New York, who lost a
20-year-old daughter. ``I think it is negligent. They should have
done something about it, like checked into it.''
   Mildred Sachuck, the house mother at a Syracuse fraternity that
lost a member in the crash and another in a Beirut terrorist bombing
in 1983, said that if the crash was the work of terrorists, ``We
ought to blow 'em to hell.''
   Among the lucky ones was The Four Tops singing group, which was
delayed by a British Broadcasting Co. TV taping. Lead singer Levi
Stubbs said he called his wife to tell her he had missed Flight 103.
``And she was crying and carrying on, and I asked, `What's the
matter?' And she told me what happened,'' he said.
   Flight attendant Paul Garrett, 41, had planned to open a boutique
in Paris after 15 years with the airline. ``The terrible tragedy is
that this was going to be his last flight,'' said Jan MacMichael, a
friend in Millbrae, Calif.
   Paul Walters, who was flying with his wife and son after serving
with the Air Force, said he nearly switched from an earlier Pan Am
flight to Flight 103 because he needed time to come up with $76 cash
to ship the family dog home.
   ``I was reaching for the phone (to call Pan Am) when it rang,''
Walters said. It was a friend offering the money. Walter called his
parents in Detroit to tell them he was OK. They were ``never so glad
to get a collect phone call.''
   Philip Bergstrom, 21, an Army helicopter navigator based in West
Germany, was on his way to Forest Lake, Minn., to be with his
father, who was to undergo heart surgery Jan. 9. ``We were going to
have our Christmas after the operation, just the main family opening
presents,'' said his mother, Audrey.
   Army Sgt. Lloyd David Ludlow, 41, was on his way to Hutchinson,
Kan., for the funeral of his sister, who died a day earlier of a
blood clot, said another sister, Aggie Coslett. ``My sister's
funeral is tomorrow (Friday), and we need to get through that
first,'' she said.
   A mixup saved Curtis Rahilly, 21, of Wilbraham, Mass., who had
been booked on Flight 103 but whose school in England mistakenly
sent the tickets back home. He didn't have the means to buy new
tickets for the flight right way.
   ``I looked at those pictures and saw my body strewn over
Scotland,'' he said.
   ``I kept getting up during the night to check and see if he was
really there,'' his mother, Dorothy, said after he arrived home
safely.
   Jennie Lee Aikenhead, 21, a student in the Syracuse program, had
tried to make the flight, but her opera exam ran late. ``That could
have been me,'' she said.

   Most of the dead from Pan Am Flight
103 still lay outdoors today as investigators applied crime-scene
methods in the search for the cause of Britain's worst air disaster.
   After U.S. officials said they were warned two weeks ago of a
planned terrorist attack on Pan Am, the chief of Scotland Yard's
anti-terrorism squad and West German federal police joined the
investigation into the crash that killed all 258 people aboard the
plane and 22 on the ground.
   ``It is in many ways like a criminal investigation,'' Police
Superintendent Angus Kennedy told reporters. ``You have to preserve
the scene. We have to photograph bodies, and bits and pieces. It is
a very long and very painstaking task.''
   Detective and anti-terrorist squads in West Germany, Britain and
the United States faced proliferating claims of responsibility and,
as yet, no hard evidence that explosives downed the Boeing 747 jumbo
jet over this southeastern Scottish village.

   Syracuse, N.Y., turned off Christmas lights in memory of 35
students as Americans nationwide grieved for the Pan Am jet crash
victims, including a cabin attendant who'd planned to retire after
Flight 103 landed.
   The Boeing 747 crashed into a Scottish hamlet Wednesday night,
killing all 258 on board. The dead included a top U.S. government
Nazi hunter, a New York investment bank director, and students,
military personnel and others coming home for the Christmas holidays.
   Many expressed shock and anger at reports that terrorism may have
been involved and that U.S. officials kept quiet about warnings it
received two weeks ago that a terrorist attack on a Pan Am flight
was planned.
   ``We had no knowledge of any terrorist threats and now we feel
like this could have been prevented,'' said Bill Brunner, whose
20-year-old sister, Colleen, an Oswego (N.Y.) State College junior,
was killed.

   Only two Cabinet positions _ at the departments of labor and

U.S. Customs Service said.
   Eddy Gorandus Haak's arrest and the seizure of the $1.1 million
VAX computer last week culminated an eight-month investigation, said
Patrick O'Brien, special agent in charge of Customs in Miami.
   The Digital Equipment Corp. VAX 8800 mainframe computer seized at
Miami International Airport is capable of upgrading and controlling
systems that launch and guide ballistic missiles, operate radar or
run a mass transit system.
   It is on a federal list that regulates the exportation of

   In the recent wave of South African theatrical
productions exposing the oppression of apartheid, the most popular
is the surprisingly exuberant Broadway musical ``Sarafina!''
   Television viewers who don't expect to be in New York anytime
soon can get a taste of the show and a look behind the scenes in an
NBC News special Wednesday, ```Sarafina' ... Words of Freedom, Songs
of Hope,'' a one-hour version of documentary maker Nigel Noble's
feature-length film.
   The film includes snippets of the incredibly infectious music
composed by Hugh Masakela and the playwright, Mbongeni Ngema, and
touching interviews with the talented cast of black South African
teen-agers who tell wrenching tales of repression, beatings and
deaths of loved ones, but also express hope for the future.
   ``I'd seen the play and had always wanted to do something to
explain what apartheid did to people,'' said NBC News senior
executive producer Paul Greenberg. ``CBS did a good show last year
(the documentary `Children of Apartheid'). But the way these kids
talk about it and act through the play, they explain what happened
to them in their own lives. They describe their hope, and after all
that has happened to them, they really want to go back.''
   The film is ``a departure for us, because there are hardly any
NBC people, just the kids and the music,'' Greenberg said. Connie
Chung appears briefly to explain to viewers what they are about to
see.
   At one point, Ngema lectures his young charges about their
mission in America. ``The South African Embassy has ambassadors
here, and ambassadors are people who speak for them. The black
people of South Africa don't have an embassy here, so this is the
embassy and you are the ambassadors.''
   The kids have been immensely successful. The show opened at
Lincoln Center in October 1987 and moved to the Cort Theater on
Broadway. It won rave reviews and has been selling out nightly.
   The show is a loose flow of sketches about the lives of students
at Soweto's Morris Isaacson High School, a school that prides itself
on its political consciousness. Sarafina is a popular girl and one
of the student leaders. Many of the musical numbers are joyous, even
funny. But late in the play, Sarafina's incarceration and torture by
police _ unseen _ gives fire to the other students' commitment. When
she returns unbowed, there is a climactic dance number in which the
kids hurl themselves with deadly result at the military figures who
double as the on-stage band.
   In an interview, cast member Dumisani Dlamini describes the
reality that inspired the scene. ``I have seen things happening in
front of my face. I have seen my brothers dying, and I have seen my
heroes dying. So how shall I sit down? I have to stand and fight.
Then I'll be free.''
   ``Theater in South Africa at the moment plays a very important
role,'' says Ngema. ``We don't read a lot in the newspaper about
what is happening in South Africa. And newspapers outside South
Africa cannot report everything they want to report. So theater at
this point in time has become the only voice left.''
   Ngema recruited the youngsters from black townships and lived
with the entire cast together in one small house for three months.
He got permission from their parents to take them 8,000 miles away
to New York by promising they would get a good education. He
explains that most South African black children don't attend school
because the education they receive is poor and schools are subject
to riots and police sweeps.
   Most Americans probably cannot imagine how children raised under
crushing oppression could attain Broadway fame and still long to
return to their homeland, but the kids do.
   ``I will go back to South Africa, because it's where I belong,
too,'' says Dlamini. ``It's my home. I'll die in South Africa.
That's what I think.''
   The climactic moment in the film comes when the children meet
singer Miriam Makeba, a spiritual leader for them despite her 27
years in exile. They are so overwhelmed by seeing her in person,
they cry and cling to her, then break into song. She is moved to
tears.
   ``I may die in exile today, but I will die very happy knowing
that you will continue to do all that I started doing,'' Makeba
says, ``spreading the message through your music and your lovely
voices to the world, telling them and showing them that we are a
proud people, and that we are, in fact, a struggling people, and
that we will win our independence, and we'll be free like all other
people in the world.''

   After more than 2,000 years, the mystery and
magic surrounding the Bible has not abated.
   Historian-archaeologist John Romer examines the Bible in a
seven-part series for the Discovery Channel that attempts to
determine what is fact and what is faith. ``Testament: The Bible and
History'' begins Wednesday.
   ``A lot of our knowledge is based on academic structure,'' said
Romer, an Englishman who lives in Italy and Egypt. ``The trouble is
that so many of our assumptions are wrong.
   ``We've given up our old myths, so now we have an archaeologist
telling us about the Bible. A few years ago it would have been a
preacher fronting a documentary on the Bible. And 200 years ago you
would have been killed if you said the wrong thing.''
   Although he looks for a historical foundation, frequently
examining biblical sites for evidence, Romer is also quite
sympathetic to acceptance on faith alone.
   ``Now, instead of Adam and Eve, we have social Darwinism,'' he
said. ``On the whole, I'd rather have Adam and Eve. It deals with a
story and is constructed around issues.''
   The first one-hour episode, ``Once Upon a Time,'' airs Wednesday,
Friday and Sunday, and is about the origins of the Bible. The
second, ``Chronicles and Kings,'' airing Jan. 8, examines the
accuracy of the Old Testament as history. The third, ``Mightier Than
the Sword,'' is about the Hebrew Bible and the influence of Greece
upon the writing of the Old Testament. The fourth show, ``Gospel
Truth?'' airing Jan. 22, looks into the historical existence of
Jesus.
   ``There is no written evidence from his own lifetime that Jesus
ever existed,'' Romer said. ``I think the most powerful indication
of Jesus is the church itself. Within a short period of time after
his death the church was established. That's indication of an
incredible energy.''
   The fifth episode, ``Thine is the Kingdom,'' airing Jan. 29, is
about how the Roman Empire was converted to Christianity. The sixth,
``Power & Glory,'' airing Feb. 5, looks into how Christianity and
the Bible survived the Dark Ages. And the final show, ``Paradise
Lost,'' airing Feb. 12, examines what has happened to the Bible in
the last few hundred years.
   ``The program is not only about the Bible but what is
historically true,'' said Romer. ``It's virtually impossible to
prove something didn't happen. You can't prove that Adam and Eve
didn't exist. History is a series of experiences. Everyone sees
something different.
   ``The way this great book has been treated by kings and princes
is a gruesome tale. But what it does give us is absolutely
astonishing. The Book of Genesis contains some of the oldest stories
in the world. But in the last hundred or so years the Bible has
become a civic and scientific guide to the universe and man's
society. The way a lot of vicars use the Bible they could just as
well use the Brothers Grimm.''
   Romer has written books on ancient Egypt and the Bible and has
written other documentary series on Egypt. He directed the
excavation of the Tomb of Pharaoh Ramses XI in 1977-79, and in 1979
co-founded the Theban Foundation of Berkeley, Calif., an
organization dedicated to conservation of the Royal Tombs of Thebes.
He has also worked on numerous archaeological expeditions for the
University of Chicago.
   Romer lives in Italy but also has a home in the Valley of the
Kings in Egypt.
   ``I've spent most of my adult life in two very religious
countries,'' he said. ``It's made a great impression on me,
especially the Muslims. But the Christian peasants have also
educated me. I think it's very important that if you're studying an
ancient world that you live in a place like that. I don't know how
young students studying ancient Greece can understand it living in a
modern country.''
   Romer said he first got into making television films as a means
of fund-raising. He said he was astonished how little people care
about the past. Television became a way of showing contributors
where the money was going and to explain complicated things.
   ``Television is the greatest selling medium ever devised,'' he
said. ``I don't think you can educate people in the classic sense,
but you can get them interested in investigating more. I want people
to have a care for old things. I want them to treat the past in a
more respectful way.''

<TEXT>
   In the summer of 1964, 1,000 young volunteers
from mainstream America arrived in Mississippi to help register
black voters. They were idealistic and committed, believing their
enthusiasm and good intentions could make a difference.
   But it was a time when Martin Luther King Jr.'s ``dream'' had not
yet stemmed the hate and violence of segregation: During that season
of the Mississippi Summer Project there were 1,000 arrests, 30
bombings, 35 churches burned, 80 people beaten and at least six
murders.
   Three of those murders are the focus of Alan Parker's new movie,
``Mississippi Burning,'' a fictionalized account of the slaying of
James Chaney, Andrew Goodman and Michael Schwerner.
   The story of that racially explosive summer when Goodman, a
student at Queens College, and Schwerner and Chaney, members of CORE
(Congress of Racial Equality), disappeared and were killed is told
through the eyes of two FBI agents, portrayed by Gene Hackman and
Willem DaFoe.
   This was the intention of screenwriter Chris Gerolmo who thought
the case was a ``good story'' that would be interesting to tell from
the perspective of the investigators.
   ``I never understood this to be Hollywood's `civil rights'
picture,'' he said. ``It's an exciting story about something
important.
   ``You see our moral failures and greatness. It allows us to see
America at its very worst and also to see people who displayed great
moral courage. That's a real story.''
   However, what emerges on the screen is more a detective story
than a portrait of a great struggle, and that has some critics and
civil rights workers miffed. The heroes are not those who at times
sacrificed their lives or well-being to ensure black civil rights,
but the FBI.
   ``It was unfortunate that it was so narrow in scope that it did
not show one black role model that today's youth who look at the
movie could remember,'' said Myrlie Evers, commissioner of Public
Works in Los Angeles, whose husband, Medgar, a field secretary for
the NAACP, was shot to death by white segregationists outside their
home in 1963.
   ``In the state of Mississippi, not one leader was mentioned _ not
Rev. (George) Lee, who gave his life so that people could register
and vote, ... no (activist) Fannie Lou Hamer. Certainly no Medgar
Evers, who was the pioneer, the motivator of the civil rights
movement in Mississippi.''
   She also took issue with Parker's portrayal of the agents as
compassionate (Dafoe marches with mourners at Chaney's funeral).
   ``I don't remember the FBI agents we came in contact with as
being concerned with the health and welfare of the blacks,'' Evers
said. ``We were more or less harassed by them.''
   And she challenged the filmmakers' treatment of blacks: ``The
fear that you saw in the expression of the actors who played the
roles of blacks was certainly accurate during that time, but to
simply show fear and no courage is very, very sad.''
   Mary King, a white Southerner who worked in the Summer Project
and knew the slain volunteers, talks about the FBI in her book,
``Freedom Song,'' published last year by William Morrow and Co.:
   ``Practically everyone working in the civil rights movement knew
from firsthand experience of the duplicity of the FBI. In many
instances, FBI agents could be seen watching a demonstration while
fraternizing with sheriffs and local law officers. ... It has now
become commonly accepted that some of these agents were themselves
members of the Ku Klux Klan.''
   Despite her misgivings, Evers said ``Mississippi Burning'' (the
name of the FBI file on the case) was nevertheless a powerful film.
   ``The beatings, the lynchings, the burnings, I remember them,''
she said. ``There was a flood of remembering; I could almost reach
out and touch the screen and feel the pain. But my pain was
doublefold _ not only what I saw on the screen ... but also the
neglect in telling the entire story.''
   The film could be a contender in the upcoming Academy Award race,
and has already won awards from the National Board of Review of
Motion Pictures for best director, best actor (Hackman) and best
supporting actress (Frances McDormand).
   It takes place in 1964, the year President Lyndon Johnson signed
the Civil Rights Act, and when King won the Nobel Prize for Peace.
It also was one of the most racially violent years of the decade
with riots, beatings, bombings and murders.
   The date is June 21: Chaney, Goodman and Schwerner are stopped by
a group of white police and civilians while driving to Philadelphia,
Miss., to investigate the burning of a black church and some
beatings. The whites are openly hostile; one sticks a gun in the
driver's ear and pulls the trigger.
   The trio had gone to Mississippi where only 5 percent of the
black population, which made up 45 percent of the state, was
registered to vote.
   A few days after they failed to check in with the project, as
they were required to do when in the field, Schwerner's charred
station wagon was discovered in Bogue Chitto Creek, 15 miles north
of Philadelphia. Their bodies were found in a crude grave on a
nearby farm on Aug. 4. The three had been shot, and Chaney's skull
had been fractured from a severe beating. In December, 21 whites
were arrested. Murder charges were dropped in state court, but six
were later convicted in federal court for violating civil rights
laws.
   Gerolmo interpreted some of the story himself. For instance, the
identity of the person who tipped off the FBI about where the bodies
were buried remains unknown. In the movie, though, the informant
turns out to be the deputy sheriff's wife (McDormand). Gerolmo
considered it a logical plot twist.
   ``The wives were often a source of information,'' he said.
   Gerolmo is the son of Frank Gero, a theater manager and producer.
His brother, sculptor Mark Gero, is married to the actress Liza
Minnelli. He was born in Chicago and attended Harvard University
where he taught filmmaking before going into off-Broadway theatrical
production. His first movie, ``Miles From Home,'' was a box-office
bomb.
   A New York grade schooler when Chaney, Goodman and Schwerner were
killed, the incident greatly affected his way of thinking.
   ``It was the first time I ever considered that our country could
be wrong,'' he said. ``My mother was active in the civil right
movement. She marched from Selma to Montgomery, and we used to
discuss it around the house.''
   With ``Mississippi Burning,'' he hoped to depict American life in
general. Filmmakers John Ford and Frank Capra were his inspirations.
   ``Capra, Ford, they took on the task to say what America is,''
Gerolmo said. ``It has something to do with taking responsibility.''

   The once-hallowed Wall Street tradition of
investing in growth stocks has fallen on very hard times of late.
   The crash of 1987 had something to do with that. But as
statistical measures show, the big market break only accelerated a
trend that has been in motion for at least five, and maybe as much
as 15, years.
   All this is documented by the investment firm Kidder, Peabody &
Co., which publishes a monthly compilation of what it calls the
``Top 50'' _ the 50 issues traded on the New York Stock Exchange
that carry the highest price-earnings ratios.
   As you might expect, this list is typically dominated by
companies with strong growth records: for example, Coca-Cola, Walt
Disney, and Merck and Eli Lilly in pharmaceuticals, as well as
smaller entities like J.M. Smucker and Tootsie Roll Industries.
   Logically, stocks of companies that demonstrate the ability to
produce above-average growth should sell at higher P-Es than those
with more modest prospects. And they do.
   But the difference between the median P-E of Kidder's Top 50 and
that of the market as a whole, represented by Standard & Poor's
500-stock composite index, has lately contracted to the smallest
premium it has ever shown in calculations dating back to 1960.
   In the 1960s and early 1970s, the Top 50's P-E sometimes was more
than three times that of the general market. As recently as 1983,
the premium stood at 2.5 times.
   In November it fell to 1.3 times the market multiple. In effect,
extra growth is being offered in the marketplace at almost no extra
charge.
   What brought about this devaluation? It started in the '70s with
the collapse of a style of investing that focused on what were
called ``one-decision'' stocks.
   Under this philosophy, money managers at investing institutions
bought stocks of glamour growth companies with the presumed
intention of owning them forever. It didn't matter very much how
dearly you paid for these stocks, since you were never going to sell
them.
   Then the recession and bear market of 1973-74 knocked down that
notion with a resounding thud.
   More recently, says Kidder Peabody analyst Evelyn Feit, several
forces have combined to compress the Top 50's premium _ among them
the takeover and buyout binge.
   ``Investors' attention has been focused on immediate rewards
reaped through buyouts, restructurings and such, rather than on the
long-term investment potential of growth stocks,'' she observes.
   ``This has been accompanied by a diminution of confidence in
growth projects.''
   Tax reform also did growth stocks no favor by eliminating the
special tax break for long-term capital gains. Capital gains are the
prime allure of these stocks, since fast-growing companies usually
pay modest (or no) dividends.
   Now that all investment income is taxed at the same rates, the
fashion has shifted markedly to a ``total return'' approach.
   That left growth stocks more vulnerable than before to
competition from low-risk, interest-bearing investments, especially
when the rates those investments pay get as high as they have been
lately.
   Since the change in the tax rules was a one-time event, Ms. Feit
suggests, the blow it dealt to growth stocks was ``probably a
one-time adjustment.''
   The way she sees it, all this may represent an opportunity for
bargain-conscious investors who believe growth won't stay out of
vogue forever in the investment world.
   ``The growth sector appears positioned to show improved relative
performance,'' she contends, ``perhaps as early as 1989 if past
patterns are repeated.''

<HEAD>Veronica Hamel Is Israeli Woman in Miniseries Thriller</HEAD>
<NOTE>With LaserPhoto</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By JERRY BUCK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In the manner of ``Casablanca,'' the NBC
miniseries ``Twist of Fate'' was filmed with different endings.
   ``The story was very cleverly orchestrated so that it could be
cut three different ways,'' said Veronica Hamel, formerly of ``Hill
Street Blues,'' who stars in the international thriller.
   ``I'm happy with the choice they made, because it was my choice.
It's good that people can creatively agree and pull their resources
together. I felt very good working on this, which is not always the
case.''
   Hamel stars with Ben Cross, Bruce Greenwood, John Glover and
Sarah Jessica Parker in this story told against the background of
World War II, the Holocaust and the founding of Israel. The
four-hour miniseries, which airs Sunday and Monday, is based on the
novel ``Pursuit'' by Robert L. Fish.
   ``It's a good yarn with a lot of twists,'' said Hamel. ``It's not
just about the Holocaust. It's about people and relationships.''
   The show, as the title indicates, is indeed filled with twists.
   Briefly, German SS officer Helmet Von Schraeder (Greenwood),
fleeing Allied prosecution, has his identity changed through plastic
surgery and poses as Ben Grossman, a Jew (now played by Cross).
Interned in a concentration camp, he is befriended by and gains
respect for his fellow prisoners. Eventually he becomes a founding
father of Israel.
   Greenwood returns later in the miniseries in a dual role as Ben's
grown son who discovers the awful truth about his father and tries
to bring him to justice. Meanwhile, former Nazi colleagues learn the
father's secret and attempt to blackmail him into helping with their
terrorist scheme.
   Hamel plays Deborah, the Jewish woman Ben marries.
   ``As soon as I read the script I liked the feel and texture,''
said Hamel. ``I wanted to climb into her skin. I liked her passion.
She wasn't an appendage to a man. She had her own very strong views.
   ``He meets Deborah when he leaves the prison camp and goes to
Palestine,'' said Hamel. ``She is completely unaware of his past.
She has a philosophy that is a strong as her love. In fact, her
philosophy comes first. She becomes a doctor, but she's not as
political as Golda Meir. But at the end when I'm old, I look like a
cross between Golda Meir and Indira Gandhi.
   ``I have a lot of padding to make me look thicker. That helps,
having all those layers. I have to buy it first, then the audience
will buy it. The first time I saw myself on the screen I started to
giggle.''
   The miniseries was filmed on location in Yugoslavia, where Hamel
got a lot of action playing a member of the Israeli Army. ``This is
probably the closest I'll ever get to playing Harrison Ford,'' she
said. Working in Yugoslavia, she said, was ``like being catapulted
out of your life.''
   The two-part miniseries originally was scheduled for December,
but NBC decided to hold it until after the holidays.
   Hamel, a native of Philadelphia, was a leading model before she
turned to acting. She made her stage debut in an off-off-Broadway
show, ``The Big Knife.'' After several years in dinner-theater
productions, she moved to Los Angeles in 1975 and landed guest shots
on such shows as ``The Rockford Files,'' ``Dallas'' and ``Family.''
   At one point she was cast in ``Charlie's Angels,'' at the time
called ``Harry's Angels.'' She withdrew from the series before it
went into production and the role went to Jaclyn Smith.
   Hamel, who only recently returned from Yugoslavia, is now busy
with her own projects.
   ``I'm looking for a writer for a project I will co-produce and
star in,'' she said. ``It's a two-hour film for TV, and it's not a
pilot. I don't want to do a series. I've done that. It would be hard
to find another as good as `Hill Street Blues.' You have to sign for
seven years and that's a long commitment. It's like a marriage.
`Hill Street' was a class act.
   ``I want to do some movies. But it takes years to get things off
the ground. I have an idea for a feature. I'm looking for a
development deal. I spend a lot of time reading scripts and books.
It's hard to just sit down and read for enjoyment.''
   Hamel devotes part of her time to Stuart House, a center for
sexually abused children. She is on the board of directors. She also
has worked for six years with a rape treatment center.

   Like Clint Eastwood's Dirty Harry Callahan, U.S.
Attorney Rudolph W. Giuliani put a .357 Magnum to Drexel Burnham
Lambert Inc.'s head, saying maybe he had one bullet left, maybe he
didn't.
   Drexel decided he did.
   After a protracted battle fought in the courts, the press and the
canyons of Wall Street, the nation's fifth-largest securities firm
elected not to risk getting its head blown off.
   Drexel decided to settle the biggest securities fraud case in
history by paying a record $650 million in fines and restitution and
pleading guilty to six felonies, reversing its longstanding claims
of innocence.
   The battle had already cost the firm nearly $2 billion in
attorneys' fees and lost business.
   Drexel also agreed to cooperate with Giuliani's expanding probes
into financial trading abuses spawned largely by the downfall of
Ivan F. Boesky, the convicted speculator who fingered Drexel and
others more than two years ago.
   The decision came moments before a deadline set by Giuliani to
Drexel following weeks of bluffs, counter-bluffs and leaks to the
newspapers that a climax was imminent.
   Post-mortem accounts of this historic showdown reveal Giuliani
told Drexel's directors he was going to make an announcement at 4
p.m. Wednesday.
   ``He said, `It's going to be either an indictment or a
settlement. You decide,''' said one source familiar with the final
pre-deadline maneuvering, who requested anonymity. ``It was a game
of blink, and Drexel blinked.''
   The biggest weapon in Giuliani's arsenal was his threat to
subject Drexel to the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations
act, commonly known as RICO, a widely feared, far-reaching statute
originally designed to combat drug runners, gangsters and pimps.
   If Drexel had been indicted under that act, the government could
have frozen much of its assets and seized what prosecutors had
reason to believe were the firm's ill-gotten gains, before trial, to
hold as security.
   Individuals named in the indictment would have been forced to
surrender their earnings during the period of alleged wrongdoing. A
trial could have taken months or even years, diverting time, energy
and money from a firm that has prided itself on efficiency,
aggressiveness and big profits.
   Moreover, convictions would have exposed Drexel to multiple civil
lawsuits that could have resulted in many hundreds of millions of
dollars in fines, because of the racketeering act's provision for
triple damages to victims.
   A racketeering indictment would have come at the worst possible
time for Drexel, which has been playing crucial financing roles in
nearly every multibillion-dollar takeover of the year, most notably
a $5 billion bridge loan for Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co.'s $24.5
billion acquisition of RJR Nabisco Inc.
   Drexel executives were known to be anxious to protect their
interest in that deal, which could net as much as $300 million in
fees.
   Only a few weeks before Giuliani's Drexel deadline, the
prosecutor had demonstrated vividly to the firm just how powerful
the racketeering act can be.
   The small New Jersey investment partnership Princeton Newport
Partners liquidated because five of its principals and a former
Drexel trader had been indicted under the statute in August by a
Giuliani-directed grand jury.
   The majority of Drexel's directors decided not to risk a similar
fate and opted instead for a settlement that would label the firm a
felon but at least put the investigation behind it for good.
   In other economic and business news this past week:
   _British conglomerate Grand Metropolitan PLC acquired Pillsbury
Co. for $5.68 billion, ending the Minneapolis-based food and
restaurant concern's feeble effort to thwart the takeover, largely
by relying on its poison-pill shareholder rights defense. Grand
Met's triumph raised new questions about the effectiveness of poison
pills, which have been repeatedly challenged in court.
   _Government figures presented more mixed evidence of the
economy's health. Inflation eased slightly in November, while
consumer spending and orders for large durable goods rose. For the
third quarter of the year, the broadest measure of economic growth
was 2.5 percent, down slightly from an earlier estimate of 2.6
percent. None of the figures pointed decisively to a slowdown or an
overheated economy. But there was speculation that the Federal
Reserve would move soon to hike interest rates if it viewed
inflation as a threat.
   _The Big Three automakers said vehicle sales jumped 15.3 percent
during the mid-December period, paced by a 35.9 percent leap in Ford
Motor Co. car sales. The performance reflected a major improvement
over the same time a year earlier, when consumers spooked by the
October 1987 stock market crash cut back on spending for expensive
items.

   Wall Streeters will have to wait until after
Christmas to learn whether the Federal Reserve has a ``present'' for
the markets in the form of an increase in its discount rate.
   For several weeks now there has been widespread speculation in
the financial world that the central bank would raise the rate,
which it sets on loans to private financial institutions.
   But the discount rate has remained where it stood since last Aug.
9, when the Fed increased it from 6 percent to 6.5 percent.
   During this period, analysts say, the Fed has indeed been taking
steps to tighten its credit policy in an effort to stave off a
revival of inflation.
   The central bank has chosen, however, to pursue that policy by
more subtle means than a discount rate change _ specifically, by
maneuvers creating upward pressure on the federal funds rate.
Federal funds are overnight loans between banks.
   The result has been a rise in all short-term interest rates that
are determined by the money markets.
   So when and if the discount rate is changed, it could well be
interpreted on Wall Street as nothing more than a ``catch-up'' move.
   ``The cutting edge of monetary policy is the federal funds
rate,'' said Darwin Beck, an economist at First Boston Corp., in a
bulletin to the firm's clients. ``The Fed will raise the discount
rate when it suits its purposes.
   ``When the Fed raises the discount rate is less important than
what it signifies.
   ``Will it reflect the end of a firming phase or the beginning of
a further tightening? For the answer we will have to wait for the
announcement and the justification the Fed gives for the hike.''
   The hope on Wall Street is that the Fed will be able at some
point in the new year to change gears and start loosening credit
conditions.
   For that to happen, analysts reason, Chairman Alan Greenspan and
his fellow policymakers would want to see convincing evidence that
economic growth was slowing.
   And the Fed might also hold out for an agreement between
President-elect Bush and Congress on substantial measures to reduce
the federal budget deficit.
   The tricky part of slowing the economy and shrinking the budget
deficit is to do so without causing a recession.
   Amid hopes that that mission could be accomplished, the stock
market continued its tentative, low-volume yearend rally in the past
week.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 18.22 points to
2,168.93.
   The New York Stock Exchange composite index gained .90 to 156.06;
the NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market added
1.54 to 377.34, and the American Stock Exchange market value index
was up 4.85 at 302.22.
   Volume on the Big Board averaged 140.57 million shares a day,
against 144.43 million the week before.
   If fears of an approaching recession intensify in the months
ahead, argues David Resler, economist at Nomura Securities
International, they could actually help prevent one from occurring.
   ``That could happen,'' he said, ``if worries about the future
took some of the exuberance out of current spending so that growth
could slow enough to let the Fed reverse some of this year's
credit-tightening.
   ``Some might judge that scenario as too much to hope for, but the
lessons of 1988 seem to suggest it is not.
   ``The economy has shown itself to be both more resilient and less
prone to inflation than most economists believed possible.''

   It was the year they held a presidential election and half the
nation's voters decided to stay home.
   It was the year rescuers decided to free a trio of battered,
barnacle-encrusted gray whales trapped in the ice at the top of the
world. It was the year an early decision to let Yellowstone burn
altered the face of the showcase national park for a century to come.
   It was the year Oprah decided to diet, Soviet leader Mikhail S.
Gorbachev decided he wanted to be president, Attorney General Edwin
Meese III decided to resign, evangelist Jimmy Swaggart decided to
confess his sins and Michael Spinks decided to challenge world
heavyweight champion Mike Tyson.
   Some decisions worked; others didn't.
   Soviets and Americans pulled together to free two surviving
whales, last seen cruising toward warmer waters. Soviet President
Andrei Gromyko bowed out, and Gorbachev took over. Oprah Winfrey,
the TV host, lost 67 pounds.
   In Yellowstone, however, officials realized too late they might
have made the wrong decision. By the time firefighters arrived,
unusually dry weather and high winds had fires ripping out of
control, forcing evacuation of towns and causing an uproar among
area residents.
   Swaggart preached on but lost much of his audience after the
Assemblies of God decided to defrock him. Spinks lasted for just 91
seconds and eight decisive blows.
   The wisdom of other decisions remained to be seen.
   Faced with the choice between Vice President George Bush and
Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis, and frustrated by one of the
most low-down, dirty presidential campaigns ever, an ambivalent
electorate waffled and fidgeted and finally succumbed to
overwhelming inertia.
   ``I've always loved election years,'' President Reagan said, but
it seemed hardly anyone else did. Bush's 54-46 percent victory over
his Democratic opponent was based on a 50 percent voter turnout, the
lowest in 64 years.
   Political analysts looked at exit polls and determined that many
voters weren't voting for anyone so much as they were voting against
the other guy. They also determined that Bush lost 2 percent of his
supporters because they were turned off by his first major decision
_ to tap as his running mate Indiana Sen. Dan Quayle, the first
``baby boomer'' on a national ticket and a choice that surprised
even Bush's advisers.
   It was Democratic vice presidential candidate Lloyd Bentsen, the
silver-haired, smooth-talking senator from Texas, who provided the
only memorable line from the three nationally televised debates.
   ``Senator, you are no Jack Kennedy,'' Bentsen told a flustered
Quayle, after the 41-year-old senator had compared himself with the
late Democratic president.
   The Kennedy image haunted the campaign and the nation. The 25th
anniversary of his assassination became a time to reflect on
idealism lost and a world changed.
   Nowhere was that change more apparent than in U.S.-Soviet
relations.
   Kennedy, on the campaign trail himself 28 years ago, shunned
Nikita Khrushchev when he visited New York. But Gorbachev, the first
Soviet leader since Khrushchev to taste the Big Apple, had a
super-power lunch with Reagan and Bush on Dec. 7 and addressed the
United Nations, with no Khrushchev-style shoe-thumping. Instead, he
promised to trim 500,000 men and 10,000 tanks from the Soviet armed
forces.
   The visit ended abruptly when a devastating earthquake hit Soviet
Armenia. The Soviet leader rushed home to learn that an estimated
60,000 had died and 500,000 were left homeless as whole cities
crumbled under the quake's force.
   Rescue teams, doctors and planes loaded with supplies poured in
from around the world. It was the first time since World War II that
the Soviet Union had accepted disaster relief from the United States.
   Reagan paid his first visit to Moscow in June for a summit that
failed to break new ground in arms control. The president hammered
away on human rights issues, and Gorbachev later sent America living
proof of his commitment to change.
   Nobel laureate Andrei Sakharov, father of the Soviet dissident
movement, was allowed his first trip outside the Soviet Union after
years of agitation over Soviet human rights policies.
   Americans vigorously agitated for their own causes. More than
5,000 people were arrested in anti-abortion protests that began in
July in 32 cities and continued through the year. Roe vs. Wade, the
Supreme Court decision legalizing abortion, turned 15 years old,
intact.
   Anthony McLeod Kennedy, confirmed as a Supreme Court justice by a
unanimous Senate, inherited a pivotal vote on the abortion issue but
gave no hint of his views.
   Court dockets bulged with the celebrated cases of the
once-powerful.
   Former Philippine President Ferdinand E. Marcos and his wife,
Imelda, were indicted on racketeering charges alleging they
plundered their homeland of millions and defrauded U.S. banks. Harry
and Leona Helmsley, the king and queen of New York real estate,
pleaded innocent to dozens of tax evasion charges.
   Republican Evan Mecham of Arizona became the first governor in a
half-century to be impeached and removed from office, although he
was acquitted on criminal charges of concealing a $350,000 campaign
loan.
   Oliver North, John Poindexter, Richard Secord and Albert Hakim
pleaded innocent to charges of defrauding the government by selling
arms to Iran and giving the proceeds to the Contras at a time when
U.S. aid to the Nicaraguan rebels was banned.
   Congress refused to restore military aid to the Contras but
decided to approve humanitarian aid after the Nicaraguan rebels and
the Sandinista government reached a temporary truce.
   In a decision that stunned Israel, President Reagan authorized
talks with Yasser Arafat's Palestine Liberation Organization for the
first time in at least 13 years. ``Our object is not a dialogue,''
Secretary of State George P. Shultz said. ``Our object is peace.''
   Uneasy peace prevailed in the 8-year-old Iran-Iraq War after a
United Nations-sponsored cease-fire began Aug. 20. Peace talks
opened five days later; they were deadlocked within 24 hours. In
Afghanistan, Soviet troops began a withdrawal in 1988, but the
guerrilla war raged on.

   Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.'s plea bargain to
dodge a criminal indictment brought relief to some exhausted
staffers, but has incited skepticism in Washington and has outraged
dissident employees.
   Sources familiar with internal criticism of the decision by the
huge Wall Street investment banking firm said Thursday the agreement
aimed at settling the biggest securities fraud case in history had
generated a good deal of bitterness and doubts about the future.
   Others said Michael Milken, Drexel's high-yield bond executive
and a key target of the criminal investigation, felt betrayed by the
Drexel decision, which weakens his defense.

   The financial markets shrugged off the news that
Wall Street powerhouse Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. had struck a
historic plea bargain with federal prosecutors.
   Even in Drexel's own backyard, the market for high-risk,
high-yield ``junk bonds'' that the investment firm pioneered, news
of the settlement of fraud charges caused nary a ripple Thursday.
   Conventional bonds as well as stocks also failed to show a
reaction. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials slipped 4.28
points to 2,160.36.

   The Commerce Department reports that orders for
``big ticket'' durable goods, excluding the volatile defense
category, climbed 1.8 percent in November, a healthy increase which
economists took as a sign of continued strength in the new year.
   When defense orders are included in Thursday's report, total
durable goods orders edged up only 0.1 percent in November to a
seasonally-adjusted $122.89 billion.
   That followed a giant 2.9 percent rise in October.

Macmillan units for $400 million, but the publisher still expects to
find buyers for the properties.
   Macmillan, which was acquired for $2.5 billion last month by
Britain's Maxwell Communication Corp., said Thursday that Kohlberg
Kravis indicated it was dropping the deal due to rising interest
rates and problems in arranging financing for the purchase.
   But a Kohlberg Kravis spokesman said the firm backed out of the
deal because of restrictions set by Macmillan and Maxwell.

   The economy is headed into 1989 with healthy growth in orders for
``big ticket'' durable goods, according to a government report.
   The Commerce Department said Thursday that durable goods orders
climbed 1.8 percent in November, not counting the erratic defense
category.
   The report had little effect on the financial markets.
   Including defense orders, total durable goods orders edged up
only 0.1 percent in November to a seasonally adjusted $122.89
billion. That followed a giant 2.9 percent rise in October.
   The overall figure was inflated by a big jump in military orders
in October and then depressed when military orders returned to more
normal levels last month.
   Discounting the swings in defense, orders in the civilian
category climbed 1.8 percent in November, the best showing since a
5.2 percent August increase. Civilin orders had risen only 0.2
percent in October.
   Analysts said they were impressed by the strength in civilian
orders, and said the orders should keep U.S. plants operating busily
through the first half of 1989.
   ``This was an impressive gain and it should pretty much insure
that the economy will keep growing next year,'' said Michael Evans,
head of a Washington forecasting firm.
   Financial markets were quiet Thursday heading into the Christmas
holiday.
   On Wall Street, the stock market posted a modest loss. The Dow
Jones average of 30 industrials dropped 4.28 points to 2,160.36.
   In the bond market, prices edged up slightly as the yield on the
Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond stood at 8.93 percent.
   The dollar drifted higher against most major currencies in
extremely thin trading. It stood at 1.7729 West German marks and
124.68 Japanese yen in late New York trading.
   Oil prices continued rising. On the New York Mercantile Exchange,
the February contract for West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark
grade of U.S. crude, rose 19 cents to $16.49 a barrel after rising
15 cents Wednesday.

   Investor optimism that oil prices will continue
rising has strengthened the energy futures market in light,
pre-holiday trading.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the February contract for
West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark grade of U.S. crude, rose 19
cents to $16.49 a barrel Thursday after rising 15 cents Wednesday.
   Madison Galbraith, an analyst with Merrill Lynch Energy Futures,
said traders were optimistic that prices would rise, and sellers
Thursday were unable to bring the market lower.
   ``We don't have the sentiment that our customers want to be
sellers,'' Galbraith said. ``The market is overall friendly.''
   Traders were upbeat that the price of crude could go to $17 or
$18 a barrel if the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries
successfully reduces its production levels, Galbraith said.
   Among refined products traded on the mercantile exchange, the
January contract for wholesale unleaded gasoline settled at 46.57
cents a gallon, up 0.87 cent from the close Wednesday.
   January wholesale home heating oil rose 0.56 cent to 52.48 cents

   A historic plea bargain that would spare Drexel
Burnham Lambert Inc. from a criminal indictment has incited a mixed
reaction among its staff and skepticism by a key Washington
lawmaker, who suggested the $650 million penalty slapped on the Wall
Street giant might not go far enough.
   Rep. John Dingell, the Michigan Democrat who chairs a committee
with oversight authority in the securities industry, said Thursday
he would have to see details of the settlement before drawing
conclusions.
   ``Main Street has less reason to trust Wall Street,'' he said.
``When the details of the settlement come out, we'll find out
whether Main Street has reason to trust their government.''
   He also said: ``I have no reason to believe that Main Street will
be satisifed by anything less than the most serious punishment.
Currently the public regards markets as a crap shoot and has been
avoiding them like the devil avoids holy water.''
   The agreement announced Wednesday would require Drexel to plead
guilty to six felonies and pay a record $650 million in fines and
restitution to settle as-yet unspecified charges, most likely
stemming from its relationship with Ivan Boesky, the now-imprisoned
inside trader who fingered the firm.
   In addition, it would require Drexel to provide investigators
with evidence of possible wrongdoing by its high-yield bond
financier Michael Milken and others.
   Although Drexel senior executives expressed relief about the
settlement and predicted the firm would thrive, sources familiar
with internal criticism of the decision said other employees felt
embittered and concerned.
   ``There's not going to be a mass exodus, but I think in time
significant people will leave,'' said one of the sources, who spoke
on condition they not be identified. ``I think suicide is a little
strong, but I think it's like cutting off your arms and legs.''
   The plea bargain marked a stunning turnaround for Drexel, which
had asserted its innocence since being implicated by Boesky more
than two years ago and had denounced him as a convicted felon and
doublecrosser.
   Others said Milken, a key target of the criminal investigation
spawned by Boesky, felt betrayed by the Drexel decision, which
weakens his own defense.
   Milken has maintained his innocence and has reiterated that he
would fight any indictment. But the sources said that if he were
indicted he would terminate his relationship with Drexel, which
Milken helped grow into one of the most aggressive and profitable
firms.
   At the same time, the agreement took tremendous pressure off
chief executive Frederick Joseph and other senior managers, who had
been urging colleagues to swallow their pride and settle the case so
the firm could leave the protracted ordeal behind.
   The agreement also raised the prospect that former White House
chief of staff Howard Baker, whose Tennessee law practice has been
advising Drexel for months, would become chairman as part of a
long-term recovery strategy, sources familiar with Baker-Drexel
discussions said.
   Baker, the onetime Tennessee senator who has been conferring in
New York with Drexel aides almost every other week, was visiting the
firm a day before the settlement was reached, the sources said.
   ``Clearly the decision yesterday (Wednesday) removes one of the
major obstacles,'' said one source. ``Now you can see the
opportunity to talk in more detail about such a role.''
   Baker's spokesman Thomas Griscom declined to comment on Baker's
discussions or speculation about his selection as chairman.
   ``They have continued to talk and we expect that to go forward
for the next several weeks,'' Griscom said. Drexel spokesman Steven
Anreder said, ``We echo comments about discussions with him but
there's nothing wider on the table.''
   The settlement agreement still requires approval from senior
Justice Department officials and the Securities and Exchange
Commission, which sued Drexel, Milken and others three months ago on
civil charges of conspiring with Boesky to profit on inside
information, manipulate stock and commit other frauds.
   Sources familiar with the agreement said these other agencies
must approve the agreement by mid-January.
   Chiles Larson, a spokesman for the SEC in Washington, declined to
comment on the agreement or on the status of possible discussions
with Drexel. Anreder, Drexel's spokesman, also declined to comment
on any SEC discussions.

   After settling the nation's biggest securities
fraud case, Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. now faces the crucial task
of retaining its clients, who include many well-known takeover
strategists.
   The beleaguered Wall Street firm received some staunch support
from a number of corporate clients Thursday, one day after it
agreeing to plead guilty to six fraud charges and pay the government
a record $650 million penalty.
   But some clients said privately they still needed to review
whether the plea-bargaining arrangement would change their close
business relationship with Drexel.
   ``I don't think anything at this point is that clear,'' said a
spokesman for one client, which did not want to be identified.
   In announcing its plea agreement late Wednesday, Drexel avoided
what could have been a lengthy, costly trial that threatened to
slowly destroy the firm. The government had spent two years
investigating Drexel's relationship with Ivan F. Boesky, the former
stock speculator was accused of insider trading.
   Although the $650 million settlement is the largest ever in a
securities fraud case, Drexel said it may have cost more in lost
business and legal fees had it continued to fight the federal
charges. Frederick H. Joseph, Drexel chief executive officer, said
the company already has lost about $1.5 billion in business and paid
out $175 million in legal expenses.
   The settlement, though, does not protect Michael Milken, Drexel's
high-yield ``junk bond'' whiz and another key target of the criminal
probe. Milken repeatedly has asserted his innocence.
   Drexel now faces the formidable task of retaining its key
clientele, even without Milken, if it hopes to remain one of the
most powerful and profitable investment banks on Wall Street.
   Milken has generated billions of dollars in revenue for Drexel
through junk bond underwriting, much of which has been used to
finance some of the biggest corporate takeovers of the decade.
   Loyal clients have included such takeover strategists as Carl
Icahn, Ronald O. Perelman, Saul Steinberg and William Farley.
   ``It's obviously a serious blow to Drexel,'' said Farley,
chairman and chief executive of Chicago-based Farley Industries,
which contemplates using Drexel-floated junk bonds to buy
Westpoint-Pepperell Inc.
   Farley said Drexel has assured him it will be able to fulfill its
role in the financing. He said he was confident the firm could
finance the acquisition of Westpoint-Pepperell ``under any scenario
you could describe, and that obviously includes without Drexel.''
   A Drexel spokesman said Thursday that the firm would continue
reassuring its clients that the government settlement would not
interfere with any of its current or future deals.
   ``We have a program of ... communication with employees and
clients, which we consider to be our principal constituentcies,''
said Steven S. Anreder, a senior vice president for the New York
firm. ``The people I've spoken to have indicated their support.''
   Among the staunch supporters have been such small,
growth-oriented companies as Red Bank, N.J., real estate developer
Hovnanian Enterprises Inc.
   ``We feel indebted to Drexel,'' said Hovnanian President Ara
Hovnanian. ``They helped us a great deal with our financing and
that's why we'll be standing with them in their difficult times.''
   Hovnanian said Drexel's $100 million in junk bonds enabled it
grow more than six-fold over the past six year.
   Thomas Reed, spokesman for Shamrock Holdings Inc., which hopes to
take over Polaroid Corp. with the help of Drexel junk-bond
financing, said his firm would maintain its relationship with Drexel.
   ``Shamrock is gratified that Drexel's put the whole thing behind
them. It's been a very difficult experience, but it resolves any
uncertainties, real or imagined, that may have existed on Wall
Street concerning Drexel's ability to operate,'' Reed said.
   Harold Simmons, billionaire chairman of Dallas-based Valhi Inc.,
was equally as supportive.
   Simmons said he used Drexel to float junk bonds three times, most
recently in February when he increased his stake in NL Industries, a
company of which he is now chairman.
   ``I'm sure we'll be doing business with them in the future,'' he
said.

   Dun & Bradstreet Corp. plans to discontinue some
businesses and product lines and to make workforce cuts under a
major restructuring aimed at strengthening its leadership in the
business information industry.
   The company said Thursday that restructuring costs were expected
to offset the $450 million after-tax gain it will get from the sale
of its Official Airline Guides business to British publisher Robert
Maxwell.
   Dun & Bradstreet, the world's biggest marketer of business
information and related services, said it had completed the sale of
Official Airline Guides to Maxwell for $750 million.
   That business includes transportation and travel guides, travel
magazines such as Frequent Flier, which has a circulation of about
350,000, and an on-line ticketing, reservation, schedule and fare
information service.
   Maxwell also has an option to acquire D&B's Thomas Cook travel
agency business.
   Dun & Bradstreet stock closed up 12{ cents at $54 a share on the
New York Stock Exchange.
   Bill Doescher, a spokesman for Dun & Bradstreet, declined to
comment on specifics of the planned restructuring, or what
percentage of the company's 60,000-member worldwide workforce would
be affected.
   Dun & Bradstreet stated in a news release that its restructuring
would include:
   _employee reductions and relocations in a number of unspecified
businesses as a result of automation and reorganization;
   _discontinuance and consolidation of certain businesses and
operations;
   _consolidation and streamlining of computer and production
facilties worldwide;
   _phaseout of the manual collection of household panel information
by Nielsen Marketing Research.
   ``These are continuing steps in the long-term process of
strengthening our competitive advantage and worldwide leadership
positions in key markets for information services,'' stated Charles
W. Moritz, Dun & Bradstreet's chairman and chief executive.
   Dun & Bradstreet, which owns the Nielsen marketing and television
research companies, Moody's Investors Service credit rating firm and
Donnelley marketing and directory publishing businesses, has been
acquiring and selling businesses in order to focus more on its key
markets for information services.
   Dun & Bradstreet agreed to acquire IMS International Inc., a
major market research concern, last February in a stock swap valued
at $1.77 billion. The restructuring costs also include costs of the
termination of IMS International's South African operations.
   The company also has announced plans to acquire Commercial Credit
Co.'s American Credit Indemnity Co. business credit insurance
subsidiary for $140 million, and Chase Manhattan Corp.'s Interactive
Data Corp., a securities research firm for $140 million.
   Dun & Bradstreet posted a profit of $375.9 million, or $2.01 per
share, on revenue of $3.13 billion during the nine months ended
Sept. 30.

<TEXT>
   A $20 million settlement with the final defendant
essentially ends the Washington Public Power Supply System
securities-fraud trial, but the nearly six-year-old case is far from
over.
   The federal judge hearing the case still must decide whether to
approve the out-of-court settlements reached by defendants in the
class action suit, and then how to divide the roughly $750 million
among 24,000-plus plaintiffs and attorneys.
   Plaintiff attorney, Mel Weiss, said late Thursday in a telephone
interview from Florida that the settlement pool may not be dispensed
until late next year, or even later if disputes arise.
   The settlement by the final defendant, Blyth Eastman PaineWebber
Inc., a financial adviser to WPPSS, was announced Thursday.
   U.S. District Judge William Browning still must approve 16
separate settlements reached over much of the past year. Browning
already has approved four settlements, reached as early as September
1987.
   The legal action grew from WPPSS' 1983 default on $2.25 billion
in bonds sold to finance two nuclear power plants that were
abandoned before completion. The default was the biggest in the
history of the municipal bond market.
   Browning was hearing the securities fraud case in Tucson, Ariz.,
on a change of venue from Washington state.
   The more than 100 original defendants have agreed to pay about
$700 million to settle the case, and another $50 million could be
collected from contested insurance claims.
   Plaintiff bondholders had made total claims of $1.6 billion.
   The trial, which started Sept. 7, had been expected to take up to
a year. Browning now is expected to dismiss the jurors, who recessed
Dec. 1.
   In addition to approving the settlements, Browning must decide
how to divide the money among several classes of plaintiffs and
among dozens of attorneys.
   Attorneys said they hoped to get the notice of settlements to the
class of plaintiffs by Jan. 16, and to get approval for all of them
in a March hearing.
   Distribution of the money will be determined after Browning holds
fairness hearings, presumably in Seattle. If all the money is in
hand and there are no challenges, the award can be sent to
plaintiffs all at once, said Weiss.
   ``We hope that can be done by the end of 1989,'' he said.
   Some money still could be distributed if there is a dispute, with
the court withholding disputed funds.
   Defendants in the federal lawsuit, which incorporated dozens of
separate suits dating to Feb. 22, 1983, included the supply system,
the 88 utilities that contracted with WPPSS to build the two plants,
engineering firms, Wall Street bond underwriters, utility and WPPSS
directors and Blyth Eastman.
   The default was on bonds WPPSS sold to finance construction
starting in the late 1970s on its plants No. 4, at the Hanford
nuclear reservation, and No. 5, at Satsop, west of Olympia.
   WPPSS abandoned the plants in 1982 because of rising construction
costs and doubts about the need for the plants' power. Default
occurred in July 1983 after the Washington state Supreme Court ruled
that utilities participating in construction of the plants lacked
authority to sign contracts with WPPSS guaranteeing payment even if
no electricity was generated.
   There there has been little complaint about most of the
settlements, but a proposal by the state of Washington to pay $10
million to settle any claims that might be brought against it has
been criticized by plaintiffs in a state court lawsuit.
   Those plaintiffs claim the Washington state auditor failed to
audit the supply system and to examine bond resolutions prior to
bond sales, thus failing to protect investors. Plaintiffs are
seeking the return of their full $2.25 billion investment, plus
interest they would have received over the 30-year life of the
bonds, a claim that could total $7 billion.

   Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.'s historic
plea-bargain deal with federal prosecutors has had little effect on
the financial markets.
   News of the settlement of fraud charges caused nary a ripple
Thursday even in Drexel's own backyard, the market for high-risk,
high-yield ``junk bonds,'' which the investment firm pioneered.
   Conventional bonds as well as stocks also failed to register a
reaction.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials slipped 4.28 points to
2,160.36 Thursday.
   A ``flight to quality'' out of junk bonds and into conventional
securities, which had been predicted in some quarters as a result of
the Drexel debacle, failed to materialize.
   Treasury, corporate and municipal bonds had an uneventful trading
day, finishing mixed. The yield on the Treasury's closely watched
30-year bond slipped to 8.93 percent from 8.94 percent late
Wednesday.
   U.S. Attorney Rudolph W. Giuliani announced late Wednesday, after
the markets closed, that Drexel had reversed itself by agreeing to
admit guilt to six felonies and pay a record $650 million fine to
settle the biggest securities fraud case in history.
   Expectations of a Drexel settlement had grown in recent days, and
the markets weren't taken by surprise. In fact, they seemed relieved
that the business was over with and Drexel had decided not to wage a
risky fight.
   ``This one's been hanging around for some time,'' said Monte
Gordon, director of research at Dreyfus Corp.
   All the markets were quiet, at any rate, as trading slowed in
anticipation of the Christmas and New Year's holidays.
   ``The only surprise is that (the Drexel settlement) happened on
Wednesday,'' said Micheal Metz, a stock market analyst for
Oppenheimer & Co. ``At least for the moment, Drexel is still in the
arena and functioning.''
   Wall Street had already shown some support Wednesday for an
anticipated settlement, by lifting share prices of RJR Nabisco Inc.,
Polaroid Corp. and a few other takeover-related companies. Junk
bonds are widely used to finance debt-financed takeovers of
companies.
   The takeover stocks have been buoying the otherwise lackluster
market in recent weeks.
   Without the boost provided by those stocks, ``we've got no
performance at all, period,'' said Oppenheimer's Metz.

   Nearly a continent away from Wall
Street but dead center in its latest insider-trading scandal, junk
bond king Michael Milken works on an opulent avenue lined with tony
boutiques and stately hotels.
   The decision of his employer, Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., to pay
a record $650 million fine to settle criminal securities fraud
charges has reportedly split the company's ranks over the fate of
Milken. But there was little outward sign of that turmoil Thursday.
   Employees arriving for work _ the few who would acknowledge a
reporter _ refused to talk about the case. Attempts to get into
Drexel's unobtrusive offices were rebuffed by uniformed guards who
staff the reception desk of the building on Rodeo Drive, the
shoppers' Mecca.
   Milken has said through spokesmen that he is prepared to fight
criminal charges believed pending against him. According to some who
saw him socially during the many months the Drexel investigation has
been publicly unwinding, Milken appears to have retained his
customary enthusiasm for business and extensive charitable interests.
   ``He's not a defensive-type guy,'' said Richard Riordan, a Los
Angeles attorney and investor and friend of Milken's who last saw
him 10 days ago at a charity event.
   ``He acts like nothing has happened and his whole time and effort
is spent on the thing at hand,'' Riordan said. ``My guess is he's a
tough guy ... I think he's going to keep doing business as usual.''
   The very fact of Drexel's presence in this enclave of the rich
and famous is testament to Milken's importance to Drexel, and his
willingness to flout convention. Not only is Beverly Hills out of
Manhattan, it's a good 10 miles from the Los Angeles financial
district.
   Drexel's offices are spread through two low-rise gray marble
buildings that also house the aristocratic Gump's department store,
a clothing boutique and a savings and loan office.
   Across Rodeo Drive is the ornate Beverly Wilshire Hotel, where
Nancy Reagan stays when she's in town. Up the way are shops of
Cartier, Tiffany & Co. and Van Cleef & Arpels jewelers, where
President Reagan bought the first couple's wedding ring.
   Inside the office, Milken and his lieutenants line up buyers and
sellers of high-risk, high-yield junk bonds. Much of Drexel's junk
bond business depends on this network, with previous issuers of
bonds often being tapped to buy someone else's new issue.
   Milken is said to have tired of working in New York and to have
persuaded Drexel that the business could be done by telephone from
anywhere.

<TEXT>
   The government-appointed bank commissioner
investigating the biggest financial scandal in Greece's history,
died Friday from a heart attack.
   Spyros Papadatos' death occurred the day he was scheduled to
release a list of depositors, including state enterprizes, at the
Bank of Crete, as part of his ongoing investigation.
   Papadatos, a 53-year-old official of the central bank, was
appointed to investigate the widening scandal at the Bank of Crete
on October 18.
   In a preliminary report Papadatos had disclosed that at least
$300 million of bank funds were either missing or mismanaged and
accused the bank's chairman, George Koskotas, of fraud and
embezzlement.
   Koskotas was suspended as bank chairman, but fled the country on
Nov.6 and eventually went to the United States where he was arrested.
   The 34-year-old Koskotas, married to an American citizen, remains
in a Boston, jail awaiting an extradition hearing.
   The financial scandal has implicated ranking members of Premier
Andreas Papandreou's socialist government, prompting seven ministers
to leave. Several of the ministers quit to protest the government's
handling of the investigation alleging that a coverup was underway
in order to protect senior socialist party officials.
   Police said Papadatos was declared dead upon arrival at an Athens
hospital after he suffered a heart attack at home.

   Norway's oil put during the first half of
1989 will be cut by 115,000 barrels per day from earlier production
plans, the government told parliament Friday.
   The Ministry of Oil and Energy said daily production from January
to June will average 1.44 million barrels, down from the 1.55
million barrels called for in field operators' original plans.
   Daily production during the first and second half of 1988
averaged 1.03 million and 1.12 million barrels respectively.
   Though not a member of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries, Norway is voluntarily holding production down in order to
bolster prices.
   OPEC members agreed last month to cut production to 18.5 million
barrels a day.

   The central bank lowered Belgium's most
important interest rate Friday following last week's rate increases.
   The Banque Nationale de Belgique cut the rate on three-month
treasury certificates to 7.5 percent from 7.65 percent. It also cut
the rate for one- and two-month certificates to 7.4 percent from 7.5
percent.
   Last week's rate increases had been part of a concerted round
decided by a number of European central banks.
   A central bank official said the stability of the foreign
exchange markets and the strength of the Belgian economy and trade
balances had allowed the bank to lower the three-month rate.
   ``It is the policy of the bank to keep rates as low as possible
and the international environment allowed this,'' said the official,
who asked not to be named.
   Belgium raised its rates through much of last summer and lowered
them in a series of small steps this past fall in line with
international trends.
   Last week the downtrend came to an abrupt halt when the central
bank saw itself forced to act in concert with other central banks to
nip budding inflation with rate increases.

<TEXT>
   Texas Instruments Inc. and Hitachi Ltd. have agreed
to jointly develop technology for a new generation of computer
memory chips, Hitachi officials said.
   The agreement announced Thursday calls for jointly developing
16-megabit D-RAMs, or dynamic random access memory chips, by
exchanging technology.
   A 16-megabit DRAM can hold 16 million bits of information,
equivalent to about 64 pages of an English-language newspaper, and
16 times the size of the 1-megabit DRAMs commonly used in today's
high-performance computers.
   ``Each company will have access to the other's D-RAM technology
as it relates to 16-megabit development,'' Hitachi said in a
statement.
   ``We are very happy to enter into this relationship with
Hitachi,'' William P. Weber, Texas Instruments' executive vice
president, said in a statement. ``Both of our companies bring unique
technological skills in D-RAMs.''
   He said the agreement, which only covers technology related to
16-megabit chips, will be expanded to cover other future generation
technology. The three-year agreement is extendable, a Hitachi
official said.
   Kazuo Kimbara, Hitachi's group executive, said, ``This agreement
combines the 16-megabit development efforts of two of the world's
leading semiconductor technology companies.''
   Toshiba Corp. and Motorola Inc., both leading chip makers, signed
a similar agreement in May 1987. The two firms formed a joint
venture in Fukushima, northern Japan, to produce 256-kilobit DRAMs
and 1-megabit DRAMs.
   Analysts said each company will benefit from the agreement, with
Texas Instruments gaining Hitachi's leading technology in chip
production while offering its accumulated know-how in building
microprocessing units.

   Eastern Airlines and the Machinists union plan to
return to the bargaining table on Jan. 6 for intense federal
mediation aimed at ending a year-old contract snafu which management
claims is helping destroy the carrier.
   Federal mediator Harry Bickford said Thursday that the
negotiations were aimed at settling the dispute without declaring an
impasse that would trigger a 30-day cooling-off period.
   National Mediation Board Chairman Walter Wallace will participate
in the talks, which are expected to last at least a week at an
undisclosed location.
   Negotiations have bogged down over the Machinists' refusal to
accept any major pay cuts. Machinists leader Charles E. Bryan has
charged that Eastern management wants to provoke a strike as a
union-busting tactic.
   Eastern spokesman Robin Matell said management believes the best
way to reach a settlement with its largest labor union is by
imposing a 30-day deadline.
   ``We believe that mediation would have a much better chance if a
deadline were set,'' Matell said. ``The absence of a deadline has
been the most critical missing link.''
   Matell said Eastern will make a strong effort to reach a
settlement in the talks next month. ``We want it to succeed, and we
will work hard to make the negotiations successful,'' he said.
   Bryan declined to discuss the upcoming mediation.

<HEAD>Environmentalists Worry About Plan To Restart Offshore Exploration</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOYCE A. VENEZIA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The federal government is dusting off
its plans for offshore gas and oil exploration, much to the dismay
of environmentalists who are gearing up for another standoff along
the Atlantic.
   Ocean pollution incidents in the past two years have created a
hypersensitive environment for officials in the Department of
Interior, which hopes to renew drilling activity in the next several
years on the East Coast.
   ``The ecosystem is certainly as stressed as it can possibly be
without being in serious jeopardy from offshore drilling,'' said
Cindy Zipf, coordinator of Clean Ocean Action, a coalition of more
than 100 environmental groups based in Sandy Hook, N.J.
   Beth A. Millemann, director of Coast Alliance, a Washington-based
national coalition of environmental activists, reacted in like
fashion.
   ``My heavens, what do we have left to wash up?'' she said.
``About the only thing we don't have washing up yet is oil. Perhaps
they want to make it a full banquet of human waste.''
   Last year, the Interior Department published an inquiry in the
Federal Register to assess industry interest in again leasing and
exploring the offshore area. The proposed mid-Atlantic sale area
extends from Rhode Island south to North Carolina, covering more
than 71 million acres.
   It is not the first attempt to explore the region. Between 1976
and 1983, 32 exploratory wells were drilled in the mid-Atlantic
region. Only five produced hydrocarbons, indicating oil or gas, but
none in sufficient amounts to make it worth the investment in
bringing it ashore.
   Still, several oil companies have expressed an interest in more
exploration. The Interior Department is working on an environmental
impact statement, due to be completed early next year, said Marcia
Heimberger, a spokeswoman for the department. The eventual step
would be to lease tracts again so interested companies could drill
more exploratory wells, she said.
   In the meantime, concerned citizens should ``make sure _ right
now _ that their governor and congressional representatives take a
very firm stand against this, because the only thing the Interior
Department responds to is political pressure,'' said Sarah Chasis, a
senior attorney with the Natural Resources Defense Council in New
York.
   Already, several lawmakers have opposed the leasing plan.
   When U.S. Rep. William Hughes, D-N.J., found out about the
renewed lease program last year, he immediately called for
revisions. He said the new five-year program is too heavily weighted
toward drilling in environmentally sensitive areas, and does not
provide sufficient protections for marine and coastal resources.
   This month, Rep. James Courter, R-N.J., said he would ask
Congress to place a 10-year moratorium on oil and gas exploration
off the New Jersey shore.
   In the first attempt to drill for oil off the mid-Atlantic
states, consortiums that included giants such as Mobil, Shell, Sun
and Tenneco capped their wells after spending billions of dollars on
one too many dry holes. So why would the federal government _ and
the oil companies _ want to try to lease such tracts again?
   ``The most important reason is national security,'' Ms.
Heimberger said. ``We're all seeing stories about OPEC trying to
withhold production. It's an energy security issue for us,
particularly in the northern Atlantic states, one of the largest
users and importers of natural gas.''
   In addition, ``Even though the fields weren't commercially
producable 10 years ago, there have been a lot of technological
improvements,'' she said. ``It has changed by leaps and bounds,
actually. Companies are now able to work in much deeper water.''
   That could be the difference this time, according to Rutgers
University geology professor Warren Manspeizer.
   ``The target area in 1976 was a different sequence of rocks. They
didn't go down deep enough last time,'' he said.
   The real gamblers in the venture will ultimately be those who pay
for the right to explore again for oil and gas.
   ``But that's the nature of the business,'' said Joseph A.
Lastelic, spokesman for the Washington-based American Petroleum
Institute. ``If you quit because of a few dry holes, you may be
leaving a treasure behind.''
   Oil companies are also aware of the need to increase U.S.
production, he said.
   ``We're now importing 42 percent of what we use,'' Lastelic said.
``Our production continues to go down and consumption goes up.''
   Both the federal government and the oil companies realistically
expect opposition, however. Ms. Zipf and Ms. Millemann, for
instance, questioned why the United States is not working to find
other energy sources, and why the federal government relaxed
restrictions on vehicles that burn a lot of gasoline.
   ``There's much more we could be doing to conserve rather than
looking for potential new sources,'' Ms. Zipf said.
   She pointed to some of the potential dangers from offshore
drilling, including oil spills and dredge remains. Ms. Millemann
said that recent ocean pollution incidents have proven that currents
pull pollutants toward shore or into prime fishing grounds.
   ``The Coast Guard estimates they collect 10 percent or less of
oil from a spill,'' she said.
   Lastelic, in turn, explained that the last industry oil spill
occurred almost 20 years ago, ``and in that interim, we've made
great technological progress in drilling, and we now have a whole
set of environmental laws and inspections.''
   Although he acknowledged that drilling may sometimes stir up the
ocean bottom close to the platform, ``no one has been able to
conclude that it drifts far away. ... No one has been able to show
these muds have done any damage to fish.''
   In reality, the platforms usually attract schools of fish because
microscopic life clings to the bottom, Lastelic said.
   Ms. Millemann vehemently disagreed that oil drilling hardly
affects the waters.
   ``The process of extracting oil from underwater creates huge
quantities of pollutants,'' she said. ``Lubricating oils are needed
to keep the bit going into the ground, and they usually use diesel
oil, even though the Environmental Protection Agency has wanted them
to use mineral oil.''

<HEAD>Lucky Charms, Occult Goods A Serious Business</HEAD>

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Whether they come in the form of occult goods aimed
at teen-agers or as amulets sold at mainstream shrines and temples,
lucky charms are a staple of Japanese life _ and a profitable
business.
   Each year tens of millions of Japanese adults flock to Shinto
shrines and Buddhist temples to buy charms said to bring luck or
ward off nearly any kind of calamity imaginable.
   During the three-day New Year's holiday alone, priests at the
Tsurugaoka Hachiman Shrine in Kamakura, southwest of Tokyo, expect
to sell 300,000 lucky arrows, according to Atsushi Takahashi, a
shrine spokesman.
   ``The New Year's holidays are our busiest season, and we expect
nearly 2 million people to visit,'' Takahashi said.
   If all the lucky arrows are sold, at 800 and 2,000 yen ($6 and
$16) each, the Shinto shrine will take in over $2 million. And
arrows are just one of nearly a dozen charms sold at the shrine.
   Money made from sales of amulets is considered a contribution,
and the shrines and temples pay no tax on the income.
   ``Sales of charms are what keep many shrines in the black,'' said
a priestess at another Kamakura shrine. ``But sometimes I wonder
whether people who buy the amulets aren't missing the real point,
which is faith in the divine,'' she said, requesting anonymity.
   Tourist maps are sold at the Kamakura train station which show
the location of major temples and list each one's divine favors _
including business prosperity, improved eyesight and even the
prevention of cancer.
   Most of the charms are colorful, pocket-sized pouches which
contain a talisman or drawing of a deity.
   ``The popularity of amulets may be due to the abundance of money
in Japan and people's desire for material things,'' said the
business director of Kiyomizu-dera, a major Buddhist temple in
Kyoto, Japan's ancient capital.
   ``But we don't consider that as necessarily bad,'' he said,
identifying himself only as S. Aoki. ``The point is that if they
didn't have any faith at all, they wouldn't come here in the first
place.''
   Kazushi Sano of the Association of Shinto Shrines, which
supervises the nation's 80,000 shrines, said there are no written
rules regarding amulets, but added his organization discourages
their sale in department stores or other commercial outlets.
   ``That would be rude to the gods,'' Sano said.
   ``It's hard to judge whether the amulets are effective,'' he
said, ``because they involve divine powers that people can't always
understand.''
   Charms and the principle behind them, ``genze goriaku'' or
benefit in this world, can be traced back for centuries. They are an
integral part of Japanese religious faith.
   Most Japanese at times worship in both Shinto and Buddhist
settings, often holding weddings at Shinto shrines and funerals at
Buddhist temples. Having charms from both faiths at one's home is
common.
   But a recent increase in sales of occult amulets to junior and
senior high school girls has raised eyebrows in the mass media.
``We've been flooded by reporters in the past year,'' said Kazuo
Arai, an employee of Tokyo's ``Little Witch House.''
   Though not affiliated with either the Buddhist or Shinto faith,
the shop draws a steady flow of schoolgirls with nearly 200 kinds of
charms supposed to improve one's popularity or love life.
   ``Little Witch House'' itself is small, but is run by a company
which publishes ``My Birthday,'' a monthly teen magazine with a
circulation of roughly 400,000 nationwide. Much of the magazine is
devoted to explanations of fortune-telling, charms and incantations,
Arai said.
   ``The girls come here seeking help with problems they face in
their day-to-day lives,'' he said. ``They're young, inexperienced
and look to the charms to help them in situations they don't know
how to handle.''
   ``What the girls are doing is basically the same as what adults
do when they buy charms at shrines,'' Arai said, adding that they
may be imitating their parents, who can often be found at shrines
during the examination season buying amulets said to help students
pass.
   Most of the charms _ pendants, rings and brooches _ sell for less
than $10.
   ``They don't seem to be very serious about the charms' effects,''
he said, ``and I think they are finding a good balance'' between
reality and fantasy.
   Arai said visitors are told ``some problems can't be solved by
magic,'' and employees offer a sympathetic ear to girls who may just
need to talk about their troubles.

   The stock market headed higher today in light
pre-Christmas trading.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 6.43 to 2,166.79 in
the first half hour of the session.
   Gainers outnumbered losers by about 3 to 2 in nationwide trading
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 501 up, 335 down and
545 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 12.69 million shares as of 10
a.m. on Wall Street.
   Wall Streeters were expecting a quiet day as many investors opted
to get an early start on the long holiday weekend.
   Brokers also said money managers at investing institutions had
pretty much finished their maneuvering for the year.
   However, stocks did attract a few nibbles from buyers as the
market opened. There has been a lot of talk lately of accumulating
stocks before New Year's to try to benefit from the so-called
January effect.
   Academic researchers have published many studies about an evident
tendency of stock prices to rise in the first month of the year.
Whether that phenomenon will persist in 1989, of course, remains to
be seen.
   Gainers among the blue chips included USX, up [ at 28|; Sears
Roebuck, up [ at 41|, and American Telephone & Telegraph, up \ at
29\.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks rose
.23 to 155.73. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was up .32 at 300.65.
   On Thursday the Dow Jones industrial average dropped 4.28 to
2,160.36.
   Declining issues outnumbered advances by about 10 to 9 on the
NYSE, with 690 up, 773 down and 517 unchanged.
   Big Board volume totaled 150.51 million shares, against 147.25
million in the previous session.

   He said the company suspended with pay three of its executives
until a review of the financial results from a special committee of

   Ahearn declined to name the executives. However, an article in

   Grain and soybean futures opened mixed, then
turned slightly lower today in light, pre-Christmas trading on the
Chicago Board of Trade.
   Analysts predicted little price movement due to the absence of
many traders. The exchange was scheduled to close at noon CST and to
reopen on Tuesday morning.
   ``I predict it'll be a dull, quiet trade for the most part,''
said Victor Lespinasse, a trader with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. in
Chicago.
   Rain overnight in the Brazilian soybean belt lent a weaker tone
to all the markets, he said.
   But losses in the corn market were limited by the Agriculture
Department's announcement late Thursday that the Soviet Union had
purchased 1 million metric tons of U.S. corn.
   Wheat futures were supported by expectations that the USDA would
announce a wheat offer to the Soviets after Friday's close,
Lespinasse said.
   In early trading, wheat was unchanged to } cent lower with the
contract for delivery in March at $4.38} a bushel; corn was
unchanged to 1\ cents lower with March at $2.83\ a bushel; oats were
\ cent to 1 cent higher with March at $2.33 a bushel; soybeans were
unchanged to 2 cents lower with January at $7.91 a bushel.
   Livestock and meat futures were slightly higher in early trading
on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Live cattle were .30 cent to .40 cent higher with February at
74.20 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .12 cent to .45 cent higher
with January at 84.02 cents a pound; live hogs were .12 cent to .43
cent higher with February at 47 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies
were .18 cent to .40 cent higher with February at 44.40 cents a
pound.
   Livestock futures settled mixed on Thursday while pork bellies
finished sharply lower.

<HEAD>Arbitration On The Rise As Doubts About Litigation Grow</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Business Analyst John Cunniff is on vacation.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By PETER COY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Litigation will always be the bedrock of the
American judicial system, but many businesses are deciding it's not
for them.
   More and more, companies that can't resolve their differences by
negtiation are submitting them to impartial arbitrators who weigh
both sides and hand down binding decisions.
   Commercial arbitration cases rose 84 percent from 1983 to last
year and are still increasing, the American Arbitration Association
says.
   Arbitration makes sense in many situations. It saves time and
money and puts complex matters in the hands of trained experts
instead of untrained, unpredictable judges or juries.
   ``The idea of asking 12 uneducated, uninformed jurors to try to
decide an issue that is complex and requires technical training and
experience in an industry _ it just doesn't make sense,'' said
Robert Coulson, president of the arbitration association.
   In arbitration, Coulson said, ``You can pick an arbitrator who's
expert on the industry, or patent law, or whatever aspect of
technical information that is relevant to the case.''
   Arbitration gained credibility when computer rivals International
Business Machines Corp. and Fujitsu Ltd. used it to end a bitter
dispute over IBM's copyrights on mainframe computer software.
   IBM has a glorious history of victories in the legal system, so
some analysts said it was foolish of the company to surrender so
much control over its future to a law professor and a retired
railroad executive whose judgments are impossible to appeal.
   But choosing arbitration probably shaved tens or hundreds of
millions of dollars from IBM's _ and Fujitsu's _ legal fees while
removing crippling uncertainty over the terms of their competition.
   Even patent lawyers like the trend, mainly because they are so
overworked they don't mind the competition from arbitrators. Juries
simply can't grasp many patent issues, said Michael Blommer,
executive director of the American Intellectual Property Law
Association.
   ``When the Constitution was written, there weren't cases like
this where the average man couldn't understand the facts,'' Blommer
said.
   That was before the days of biotechnology and microelectronics.
   In a complex patent case today, Blommer said, ``If under
cross-examination somebody is forced to recant or change his
position, the jury might not understand that he even is changing his
position.''
   Federal judges do a little better, but not many of them studied
science or engineering, either. The judiciary took a step in the
right direction in 1982 by sending all patent appeals to the Federal
Circuit in Washington, where many judges are highly trained and have
expert clerks.
   Actually, most arbitration is on matters other than intellectual
property disputes. Labor grievances account for about a third of the
American Arbitration Association's business. Other big areas are
construction contracts, disputes between stockbrokers and clients,
insurance claims and supervision of elections of private
organizations.
   Many contracts are being written to include provisions that any
disputes over them will be submitted to arbitration.
   Non-binding arbitration, where decisions can be appealed to the
courts, is also growing in popularity. The Better Business Bureau
does it. So does the insurance industry. Courts in 20 to 25 states
and 10 federal districts have annexes that do arbitration to clear
out cases that don't need to go before a judge or jury.
   Trials, particularly trials by juries, clearly have a place.
Criminal cases are obviously not suited to arbitration. Arbitrators
are also unsuited to try cases where major societal questions are at
stake, such as the round of lawsuits against cigarette companies
over health damage from smoking.
   Even in areas where arbitration is well-suited, there is a cost
in civil liberties. The state of Massachusetts, in a first, is
trying to prohibit stockbrokers from requiring that their clients
agree ahead of time to settle disputes by arbitration.
   A federal judge last week threw out Massachusetts' regulatory
effort, but the state vowed to appeal.
   ``Compulsory arbitration or arbitration agreements entered into
by citizens who do not recognize they are forfeiting their
constitutional right to trial by jury is counter to the American
system of fair play,'' the Association of Trial Lawyers of America
said.
   Americans have not lost their taste for suing the living
daylights out of each other. Clearly, though, arbitration has plenty
of room to grow.
   ``It's exciting to let people take control of their own disputes
and use their innovation and ideas to resolve them in a practical
way,'' Coulson said.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   American Brands Inc.'s stock price was up 17
percent on the New York Stock Exchange today on rumors of a takeover
by Unilever, the British-Dutch consumer products conglomerate.
   Both companies declined to comment on the rumors, citing policies
against commenting on speculation.
   American Brands stock was up $9.87{ at $67.50 a share as of early
afternoon on Wall Street. At one point it had traded as high as
$70.25 a share, a 22 percent advance over Thursday's close.
   American Brands, based in Old Greenwich, Conn., makes tobacco and
liquor products as well as an assortment of golf balls, shoes and
office supplies.
   Unilever is mainly in the businesses of food and specialty
chemicals.

<HEAD>Dallas Investor Simmons to Boost Stake in Aerospace Firm</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CALABASAS, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lockheed Corp. said today it had
buttressed its takeover defenses following the disclosure that
Dallas investor Harold C. Simmons intended to boost his holdings in
the aerospace firm.
   Lockheed spokesman Bob Slayman refused to say if the changes in a
2-year-old ``poison pill'' shareholder rights plan were a direct
response to Simmons' move. Nor would he reveal if Lockheed, builder
of the Stealth fighter and other military hardware, had discussed
the investment with Simmons.
   Simmons did not immediately respond to a telephone request for
comment.
   According to Lockheed, Simmons' Valhi Inc. filed notice under the
Hart-Scott-Rodino Act that he intended to boost his Lockheed stake
beyond $15 million, the trigger point for the act's disclosure
provisions.
   As of the Dec. 7 filing, Valhi said it owned 375,000 of
Lockheed's 59.5 million outstanding shares, or 0.63 percent.
   A Lockheed board vote to tighten the firm's takeover defenses was
taken Thursday, two weeks after the filing, Slayman said.
   ``The amendment is intended to heighten the protection afforded
shareholders against abusive takeover tactics,'' the company said in
a news release.
   The revised plan allows present shareholders to buy newly issued
stock at a discount if an outsider buys 20 percent or more of the
common stock. Those rights can be canceled if the independent
directors determine the takeover bid is in the best interest of
shareholders, or if the company cancels the rights within 10 days of
the time outside holdings reach 20 percent.
   Such poison pill plans are intended to dilute the holdings of a
potential buyer, making a takeover prohibitively expensive.
   Lockheed, with headquarters in this Los Angeles suburb, has
88,000 employees in California, Georgia, New Jersey, Texas and New
Hampshire. The nation's fourth-largest defense contractor, Lockheed
had sales of $11.3 billion in 1987.
   In the first three quarters of this year, it reported a net
profit of $520 million on sales of $7.6 billion, with the profit
figure boosted significantly by sale of a subsidiary.
   Besides the F-117A Stealth fighter, its proojects include the
Trident II nuclear missile, the C-5B transport plane and work on
military communications, satellites, and the Strategic Defense
Initiative or Star Wars. The company also is a subcontractor for
design work on NASA's space station project.

<HEAD>Cup Of Coffee Will Soon Cost More</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Get ready to swallow an increase in coffee prices.
   Poor growing and harvesting conditions have pushed prices for
green, unroasted coffee beans to their highest levels in two years,
and roasters say they'll pass their higher costs along by raising
prices about 30 cents a pound.
   Procter & Gamble Co., the second-largest U.S. coffee roaster
behind Philip Morris Cos.' General Foods division, said Thursday
that it would raise wholesale prices of its ground roasted coffees
by 30 cents a pound on Jan. 23.
   P&G, which produces Folger's coffee, also plans increases of 27
cents a pound for its 11{-ounce special-roast flaked coffee and 4
cents an ounce for its instant coffees.
   ``All I can say is that coffee is a fluctuating market,'' said
P&G spokeswoman Belinda Baxter Welsh in a telephone interview from
her office in Cincinnati. ``We try very hard not to increase our
prices any more than we have to, but the price of green coffee went
up.''
   General Foods, maker of Maxwell House coffee, said it had no one
available to discuss coffee prices. But analysts said they expected
other roasters to follow P&G's lead.
   The rise in green coffee prices may filter down even more quickly
for those who prefer to buy freshly roasted beans from bins at
gourmet coffee shops, said David Siefer, manager of the Coffee & Tea
Exchange, a Chicago boutique.
   Siefer said he planned to raise prices by 30 cents a pound on
Dec. 26.
   ``It's going to hit the gourmet end of the business a little
sooner than it may be reflected in the major coffee companies,'' he
said.
   ``We don't have quite the capital the major companies have. They
buy by the (37,500-pound) container-load, but we generally have less
than 2,000 pounds on hand.''
   Cash prices for green coffee from Brazil, the world's largest
producer, have soared this month as the seasonal rise in North
American consumption focused attention on supply problems ranging
from drought conditions in Brazil to a rain-delayed harvest in
Colombia.
   In just the past two weeks, the price of Brazilian coffee in the
New York harbor surged to $1.45 a pound from $1.17 a pound. During
the same period, coffee for March delivery on New York's Coffee,
Sugar & Cocoa Exchange, leaped from about $1.27 a pound to about
$1.49 a pound.
   The tight-supply picture eased somewhat late in the past week. A
10-day Brazilian dockworkers' strike ended on Thursday and the
15-day moving average of overall coffee prices rose above $1.144 a
pound, triggering a 1-million bag increase in the amount of coffee
that producing countries are allowed to export under the rules of
the International Coffee Organization.
   But analysts say supplies of coffee remain very tight.
   In early 1986, under similar conditions, green coffee futures
prices rose to nearly $2.80 a pound.
   ``We are not up there yet but we may get up there,'' said Arthur
Stevenson, a coffee-market analyst with Prudential-Bache Securities
Inc. in New York. ``It depends how much further these weather
conditions bite into production.''
   But Stevenson said prices were unlikely to return to the levels
of 1976, when coffee futures peaked above $3.30 a pound.
   ``That was the year of a major frost in Brazil, a major
calamity,'' he said. ``The causes there were somewhat different.''

<HEAD>Grain, Soybean Futures Advance On Export Talk</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soybean futures made strong gains and grain
futures closed moderately higher Friday on the Chicago Board of
Trade amid rumors of new export business with the Soviet Union.
   After the close, the Agriculture Department announced a sale of
750,000 metric tons of U.S. corn to the Soviets, confirming one of
the rumors that swept the grain pits during the shortened session.
The markets closed at noon and will reopen Tuesday morning.
   Talk also circulated that the USDA was preparing to offer the
Soviet Union 2 million metric tons of U.S. wheat at subsidized
prices, and that the Soviets had already purchased as much as 1
million metric tons of U.S. soybean meal, analysts said.
   ``These rumors, although not necessarily believed, kept sellers
on the sidelines,'' said Victor Lespinasse, a trader with Dean
Witter Reynolds Inc. in Chicago.
   Soybeans advanced despite bearish predictions for weekend showers
in the South American soybean belt.
   ``The gains were rather impressive given the rain in the South
American forecasts, so I think the market's acting very well,''
Lespinasse said.
   At the close, wheat was } cent to 2\ cents higher with the
contract for delivery in March at $4.41 a bushel; corn was \ cent to
2\ cents higher with March at $2.84\ a bushel; oats were 3\ cents to
5 cents higher with March at $2.37 a bushel; soybeans were 5 cents
to 8 cents higher with January at $7.98 a bushel.

<TEXT>
   The Soviet Union has bought an additional
750,000 metric tons of U.S. corn for delivery under a recently
extended supply agreement between the two countries, the Agriculture
Department said Friday.
   The latest sales brought total corn sold to the Soviets to 8.78
million tons in the agreement's sixth year, which began Oct. 1. Last
year, U.S. corn sales to the Soviet Union totaled slightly less than
5.2 million tons.
   A metric ton is about 2,205 pounds and is equal to 39.4 bushels
of corn or 36.7 bushels of wheat or soybeans. The 750,000 tons of
corn would be about 29.5 million bushels.
   Corn prices have been averaging about $2.61 per bushel at the
farm level, according to USDA estimates, meaning that the latest
sale could have a farm value of around $77 million.
   Although no wheat has yet been sold for 1988-89 delivery under
the pact, the Soviets have ordered 500,000 tons of soybeans and
532,500 tons of soybean meal, plus 500,000 tons of grain sorghum.
   The United States and the Soviet Union on Nov. 28 signed an
extension of the previous five-year grain agreement, which had
expired Sept. 30. The extension of the previous pact will run
through Dec. 31, 1990.
   Under terms of the agreement, the Soviet Union is committed to
buy at least 9 million tons of U.S. grain annually, including a
minimum of 4 million tons each of wheat and corn.
   The Soviets have the option of buying the remaining 1 million
tons as wheat, corn or soybeans, with every ton of beans counting as
two tons of grain _ up to a maximum of 1 million tons of grain
equivalent.

   The stock market showed a small gain today in

   Government bond prices finished unchanged to
higher Friday in abbreviated pre-holiday trading.
   The Treasury's bellwether 30-year-bond rose about 5-16 point, or
$3 for every $1,000 in face value. Its yield, which moves inversely
to its price and is an important indicator of interest rate trends,
declined to 8.90 percent from 8.93 percent late Thursday.
   Trading was slow in the absence of any new economic data and with
many dealers getting an early jump on the Christmas holiday weekend.
The market closed several hours earlier than usual, at around 1 p.m.
EST.
   The financial markets will be closed on Monday in observance of
Christmas.
   In the secondary market for Treasury bonds, prices of short-term
government issues were unchanged to 1-32 point higher, intermediate
maturities rose 1-32 point to 5-32 point and 20-year issues advanced
9-32 point, according to figures provided by Telerate Inc., a
financial information service.
   The Shearson Lehman Daily Treasury Bond Index, which measures
price movements on all outstanding Treasury issues with maturities
of a year or longer, rose 0.83 to 1,137.04.

discount held steady at 8.16 percent. Yields on one-year bills
increased to 8.94 percent as the discount edged up 1 basis point to
8.27 percent.
   A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. The yield
is the annualized return on an investment in a Treasury bill. The
discount is the percentage that bills are selling below the face
value, which is paid at maturity.

   CSX Corp. said Friday it will sell its Texas Gas
Transmission Co. pipeline subsidiary and two related companies to
Transco Energy Co. for $646 million.
   The sale of Texas Gas, which operates a 6,000-mile pipeline
system extending from the Gulf of Mexico and East Texas through
eight other states, is part of CSX's continued restructuring.
   Transco agreed to pay $571 million for the natural gas pipeline
operations, plus an additional $75 million cash dividend to CSX
prior to closing.
   Transco is also assuming $256 million in debt, bringing the total
price tag to $902 million, according to Standard & Poors Corp.
   Houston-based Transco, through its Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line
Corp. subsidiary, operates a 10,000-mile natural gas transmission
system serving primarily the eastern United States with a capacity
of 3.1 billion cubic feet per day.
   Texas Gas serves 92 gas distribution utilities and three
interstate pipelines with mainline volumes averaging 600 billion
cubic feet per year. The company was purchased by CSX in 1983.
   George S. Slocum, president and chief operating officer of
Transco, said the Texas Gas purchase was part of the company's
de-emphasis of upstream oil and gas activities and renewed
commitment to the natural gas pipeline business and gas related
activities.
   ``Texas Gas provides an excellent strategic fit with Transco's
businesses that will provide immediate and long-term benefits in
operating efficiencies, market opportunities and an attractive
return on investment for Transco's stockholders,'' Slocum said.
   Transco plans to finance the deal with up to $350 million of
non-recourse, term debt, through Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co.,
and the sale of up to $200 million in preferred stock to Corporate
Partners, a private investor group, officials said.

   The dollar ended the week slightly higher Friday
against all key currencies except the British pound in abbreviated
pre-holiday trading.
   Gold prices also rose. Republic National Bank of New York said
gold closed at $418.25 a troy ounce, up 65 cents from late Thursday.
   Trading throughout the world was described as extremely quiet in
the absence of much market-moving news and with nearly all traders
getting an early jump on the three-day Christmas holiday weekend.
   ``Trading doesn't exist anymore,'' said one London dealer.
``Anyone who takes a position now is either very foolish or very
brave.''
   The dollar lost ground against the British pound.It cost $1.80125
to buy one pound in London, more expensive than Thursday's $1.7990.
Sterling fetched $1.8020 in New York, up from $1.79875.

<HEAD>Copper Posts Strong Gains On Supply Fears</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Copper futures prices surged Friday in a shortened, pre-holiday
session on New York's Commodity Exchange as concerns about tight
supplies strengthened their grip on the volatile market.
   On other futures markets Friday, precious metals, grains,
soybeans, energy, livestock and meat futures all advanced while
coffee fell slightly.
   Most markets closed at noon local time and will not reopen until
Tuesday morning. Trading activity was uniformly light as many
traders got an early start on the long Christmas weekend.
   Copper settled 1.1 cents to 3.2 cents higher with the spot
December contract at $1.605 a pound and the more actively traded
contract for delivery in March at $1.393 a pound.
   Prices advanced despite the Commodity Exchange's report of a
hefty increase overnight in its warehouse stocks of copper. Comex
copper stocks rose by 1,376 tons to 9,582 tons.
   Analysts said they expected the stocks report to put pressure on
the copper market, which saw the spot price hit a record high of
$1.6475 a pound Dec. 8 on tight-supply fears.
   Instead, said New York-based analyst Bernard Savaiko of
PaineWebber Inc., ``we closed stronger on lingering ideas that
there's supply tightness that is not going to go away, especially if
the economy remains resilient going into the first quarter of next
year, which is normally the strongest period from a consumption
standpoint.''
   He said market players believed the rise in Comex stocks was
temporary and that some traders were surprised the copper market was
not following last year's pattern of leaping higher each day as the
end of the year approached.
   ``But there's still a lack of production and strong demand, so
while the pattern may not be repeating last year's exactly, the
fundamentals are still strong,'' he said.
   Also on the Comex, gold settled 30 cents to 70 cents higher with
February at $421.60 a troy ounce; silver was .20 cent to 1.1 cents
higher with March at $6.275 a troy ounce.
   Soybean futures made strong gains and grain futures closed
moderately higher Friday on the Chicago Board of Trade amid rumors
of new export business with the Soviet Union.
   After the close, the Agriculture Department announced a sale of
750,000 metric tons of U.S. corn to the Soviets, confirming one of
the rumors that swept the grain pits during the shortened session.
   The USDA confirmed another rumor when it announced it had
targeted the Soviet Union for 2 million metric tons of U.S. wheat at
subsidized prices.
   And the USDA also said it had increased the amount of grain the
Soviets could buy annually under the two nations' long-term grain
agreement to 16 million metric tons from 12 million metric tons.
   One rumor that was not confirmed was that the Soviets had already
purchased as much as 1 million metric tons of U.S. soybean meal,
analysts said.
   ``These rumors ... kept sellers on the sidelines,'' said Victor
Lespinasse, a trader with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. in Chicago.
   Wheat settled 1 cent to 2 cents higher with March at $4.40{ a
bushel; corn was \ cent to 1} cents higher with March at $2.84\ a
bushel; oats were 3 cents to 5 cents higher with March at $2.37 a
bushel; soybeans were 3 cents to 8 cents higher with January at
$7.96{ a bushel.
   Coffee futures prices slipped on New York's Coffee, Sugar & Cocoa
Exchange on news that a Brazilian dockworkers' strike had ended. The
strike began Dec. 13.
   Despite the strike's end, though, analysts said near-term
availability of coffee remained extremely tight, a bullish factor as
cold weather in the Northern Hemisphere brings coffee consumption to
its annual peak.
   Coffee settled .02 cent to 1.73 cents lower with March at $1.4937
a pound.
   Oil futures prices gained more ground on the New York Mercantile
Exchange in light, pre-holiday trading.
   Market sentiment has been upbeat in recent days, with many
traders increasingly confident that OPEC members will abide by a
production-cutting agreement forged last month.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 12 cents to 19 cents
higher with February at $16.61 a barrel; heating oil was .46 cent to
.79 cent higher with January at 53.14 cents gallon; unleaded
gasoline was .29 cent to .72 cent higher with January at 46.86 cents
a gallon.
   On the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, live cattle settled .47 cent
to .67 cent higher with February at 74.37 cents a pound; feeder
cattle were .32 cent to .70 cent higher with January at 84.22 cents
a pound; live hogs were .05 cent to .73 cent higher with February at
47.30 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were .15 cent to .43 cent
higher with February at 44.50 cents a pound.

<TEXT>
   Lawyers for farmers who sued Chubb Corp. in a
dispute over 1988 drought insurance now have joined with Chubb
against the remaining defendant in the class-action lawsuit.
   Chubb, an insurer based in Warren, N.J., recently agreed to a $48
million settlement with lawyers representing 8,800 farmers in 10
states whose rain insurance applications were rejected this summer.
   Stanley Chesley, a lawyer for the farmers, said Thurday he and
Chubb lawyers have drafted a common plan of litigation against the
remaining defendant in the lawsuit, Good Weather International Corp.
   Good Weather insurance agents allegedly sold about $350 million
worth of Chubb drought-insurance policies that Chubb refused to
honor.
   The farmers' lawyers have asked unspecified damages against Good
Weather, saying it violated its contract with Chubb by overselling
policies.
   Chubb also has sued Good Weather separately for $68 million,
saying the policies should not have been sold.
   Chesley said the farmers and Chubb plan to split any settlement
award. Chubb would get a third of whatever it wins from Good
Weather, and the farmers would get two-thirds.
   The two lawsuits will be tried together early next year in
Cincinnati before U.S. District Judge Carl B. Rubin, who approved
the recent $48 million Chubb settlement.

   The stock market showed a modest gain today in
very quiet pre-Christmas trading.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 8.75 to 2,169.11 by
3 p.m. on Wall Street.
   Gainers outnumbered losers by about 3 to 2 in nationwide trading
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 810 up, 534 down and
546 unchanged.
   Wall Streeters were expecting a quiet day as many investors opted
to get an early start on the long holiday weekend.
   Brokers also said money managers at investing institutions had
pretty much finished their maneuvering for the year.
   However, stocks did attract a few nibbles from buyers as the
market opened. There has been a lot of talk lately of accumulating
stocks before New Year's to try to benefit from the so-called
January effect.
   Academic researchers have published many studies about an evident
tendency of stock prices to rise in the first month of the year.
Whether that phenomenon will persist in 1989, of course, remains to
be seen.
   American Brands, rumored to be a potential takeover target,
jumped 9[ to 66}. One unconfirmed report was that Unilever was
preparing to offer as much as $90 a share for the company's stock.
   Rexene Corp., which said Thursday that it was engaged in talks
with a possible acquirer, climbed 6 to 24\.
   Gainers among the blue-chip and technology issues included Philip
Morris, up 1] at 101\; American Telephone & Telegraph, up \ at 29\;
Digital Equipment, up 1\ at 97\, and International Business
Machines, up 1 at 123{.
   Lin Broadcasting rose 1} to 67| in the over-the-counter market. A

   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks gained
.55 to 156.05. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was up 1.18 at 301.51.

   Baldwin Securities Corp. said Friday it offered
to buy Fortune Financial Group Inc., a Florida savings and loan
holding company, for about $180 million.
   The $33-a-share offer by the New York investment firm includes
$27 in cash and $6 in senior preferred stock. It is conditioned upon
acceptance by Fortune's board of directors.
   The Baldwin offer is the third Fortune Financial has received
from a company or person with close ties to Singer Co., the defense
contractor that financier Paul A. Bilzerian took private about a
year ago.
   A federal grand jury indicted Bilzerian on fraud charges
Wednesday in connection with four unsuccessful takeover attempts,
none of which involved Fortune Financial.
   Baldwin Chairman Arthur G. Cohenis is a Singer director. Offers
for Fortune have been made in the past few months _ and later
withdrawn _ from Bilzerian, Singer's chairman, and Alex Spanos,
another Singer director.
   Also vying for the Clearwater, Fla.-based Fortune Financial is
the New York investment firm Dyson-Kissner-Moran Corp., which on
Wednesday disclosed a $170 million offer, which includes $27 in cash
and $4 in preferred stock.

   The Great Atlantic and Pacific Tea Co. Inc. has
agreed to buy Borman's Inc., a Detroit-area supermarket company, for
$75.6 million, the companies announced Friday.
   A&P will pay $27 a share in cash for each of Borman's 2.8 million
outstanding shares, the companies said in a joint statement.
   A&P's offer is subject to a number of conditions, including
approval by Borman's shareholders.
   Borman's operates 79 Farmer Jack food markets in the Detroit area.
   A&P, the nation's fourth-largest supermarket company, has 40
outlets in the Detroit area and a total of 1,183 supermarkets in 26
states and Canada.
   The merger would make A&P the dominant food retailer in
southeastern Michigan, giving it control of 119 stores and about 40
percent of the market.
   The next biggest chains in the Detroit market are Kroger with 25
stores and Great Scott! with 24 stores.
   Analysts have said A&P could achieve significant savings by
taking over its biggest competitor.
   Also Friday, Borman's reported a loss of $9.7 million in the
third quarter ended Nov. 5, on sales of $239.2 million. That
compared with a loss of $15.9 million, on sales of $219.9 million,
in the same period a year earlier.

<HEAD>American Brands Stock Shoots Up On Unilever Takeover Rumor</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER COY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   American Brands Inc. was closed Friday for the
Christmas holiday, but that didn't stop Wall Street from briefly
sending the tobacco company's stock up 22 percent on rumors of a
takeover by Unilever, the British-Dutch consumer products
conglomerate.
   Both companies declined to discuss the rumors, citing policies
against commenting on speculation. One rumor said Unilever might pay
as much as $90 a share for American Brands.
   American Brands got as high as $70.25 a share and was at $67.12{
in late trading on Wall Street, up $9.50, or 16 percent.
   Allan Kaplan, an analyst for Merrill Lynch & Co., said the rumor
was hard to substantiate. ``I've called a number of arbitragers that
are very well tuned in and nobody knows,'' he said.
   If it came through, a purchase by Unilever would continue the
trend of foreign takeovers as well as the trend of mergers in the
tobacco and food businesses. In one such case, Pillsbury Co. last
week submitted to a takeover bid by Britain's Grand Metropolitan
PLC, a liquor distiller.
   American Brands, based in Old Greenwich, Conn., is a perennially
mentioned takeover candidate. Earlier this year it fought off a
takeover bid by E-II Holdings Inc. with the ``Pac-Man'' defense, in
which it bought the would-be acquirer. It later sold most of E-II to
Riklis Family Corp.
   E-II's offering price for American Brands last spring was $55 a
share. But Kaplan said he estimated that the breakup value of
American Brands was about $95 a share, based on an estimate that
investors would be willing to pay about nine times its operating
cash flow minus debt.
   Unilever and American Brands met once before, in 1986, when
Unilever came in as a white knight to rescue Chesebrough-Pond's Inc.
from a $2.8 billion hostile takeover offer from American Brands. It
bought the company for $3.1 billion.
   American Brands, with revenue of about $10 billion a year, has a
broad product line but makes most of its profits from its cigarette
brands, which in the United States are Lucky Strike, Tareyton, Pall
Mall, Carlton, and the new Malibu. It owns Gallaher, the biggest
British tobacco company.
   In distilled spirits, American Brands sells Jim Beam and Canadian
Windsor whisky, De Kuyper cordials and Gilbey's gin and vodka. It
owns Franklin Life Insurance Co.; Master Brands, which makes Master
locks; Cushnet, the maker of Titleist golf balls; Acco World Corp.,
maker of Swingline staplers and Wilson Jones office supplies; and
Waterloo Industries, the biggest distributor of toolboxes.
   Unilever, with annual revenue of more than $30 billion, is one of
the world's biggest consumer products companies and has 300,000
employees worldwide, including 20,000 in the United States.
   In the United States, Unilever's main companies are
Chesebrough-Pond's, which makes Vaseline, Q-Tips and Ragu products;
Lever Brothers, maker of All, Surf, Wisk and Sunlight cleaning
products and Imperial, Promise and Shedd's margarines; Lipton, which
makes tea and soup; and National Starch and Chemical, which sells
starch for the food industry and specialty chemicals.

<HEAD>Report: Some Fares Much Higher After Northwest-Republic Merger</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MINNEAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Air travelers in the Minneapolis-St. Paul area
paid much higher fares to some destinations in the year after the
local market became dominated by one airline, according to a report
published Friday.
   In a review of 27 routes where competition was reduced by
Northwest Airlines' 1986 merger with Republic Airlines, average
fares rose on 23 routes, sometimes by more than 40 percent, the Star
Tribune reported.
   On all Northwest flights in and out of the Twin Cities, a
separate study shows the average fare rose 18.5 percent, six times
the national average, in the year after the merger, the newspaper
said.
   Northwest, based in Eagan, Minn., disputes the findings. Airline
officials said no broad conclusions could be drawn using isolated
fare comparisons. The airline generated new data showing that
Northwest flights were less expensive than similar flights from
other airports by other carriers.
   In addition, Northwest's study found, passengers flying to the
Twin Cities saved money over those connecting to other destinations.
Northwest also said that, like most airlines, it was earning thin
profit margins.
   Many factors help explain fare increases. But Alfred Kahn, the
architect of U.S. airline deregulation, said the broad pattern
indicated in the newspaper's study of Northwest's fares appears to
conform with ``every major study with which I am familiar.'' When
airline concentration increases, he said, fares tend to rise.

<HEAD>`Junk Bond' Market Watchful in Wake of Drexel Settlement</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARCY GORDON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The historic settlement of fraud charges by Wall
Street powerhouse Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. isn't expected to
bring a major shakeup in the market for ``junk bonds'' pioneered and
dominated by Drexel.
   Still, market players are taking a cautious, wait-and-see
attitude.
   U.S. Attorney Rudolph W. Giuliani announced this past Wednesday
that Drexel had reversed itself by agreeing to admit guilt to six
felonies and pay a record $650 million fine to settle the biggest
securities fraud case in history.
   Expectations of a Drexel settlement had grown in recent days, and
the $180 billion market for high-risk, high-yield junk bonds wasn't
taken by surprise. In fact, bond traders seemed relieved that the
business was over after dragging on for two years and the investment
firm had decided not to wage a risky fight.
   A ``flight to quality'' out of junk bonds and into conventional
securities, which had been predicted in some quarters as a result of
the Drexel debacle, failed to materialize.
   Prices of high-yield bonds were mostly little changed and even
slightly higher in some cases in quiet trading.
   But a sort of edgy calm appeared to hang over the market as
traders looked toward the new year and post-settlement prospects.
   ``Most people are taking a wait-and-see attitude,'' said Robert
Levine, president of high-yield asset management at Kidder Peabody &
Co.
   Market players are watching for further developments in the
government's investigation that could prompt some junk bond traders
at Drexel to leave the firm.
   ``This isn't over,'' said a market expert who asked not to be
identified. He noted anxiety that the investigation could envelop
some of Drexel's clients, who include many well-known takeover
strategists.
   Some of those clients said privately this past week they still
needed to review whether the plea-bargaining arrangement would
change their close business relationship with Drexel.
   That, traders fear, could potentially affect Drexel's ability to
continue to sell mammoth junk bond issues, such as the one being
used to help finance the $24.5 billion leveraged buyout of RJR
Nabisco Inc. by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co.
   The market points to the Nabisco issue as evidence that Drexel is
still a force to be reckoned with.
   The other players in the junk bond market _ notably Merrill Lynch
Capital Markets, Prudential-Bache Securities Inc., Goldman Sachs &
Co. and First Boston Corp. _ might lack the clout of dominant Drexel
in selling huge issues, some experts suggest.
   ``I don't really think we're going to see a sea change in the
market,'' said Ray Lemanski, director of high-yield securities
research at Prudential-Bache.
   There shouldn't be a major change in terms of the volume of junk
issues coming to market or their prices and yields, Lemanski said.
But he and other observers conceded that some segments of the market
could be affected by traders leaving Drexel.
   In addition to ``mega'' issues like Nabisco, junk bonds at the
other end of the spectrum, worth less than $100 million or so, also
could present a problem, analysts say. That's because the effort and
expense involved in researching the companies issuing small bonds
has kept all the players except Drexel from bothering with them.
   Some of the smaller issues ``could come under pressure,''
Lemanski said.

<HEAD>Dallas Investor Simmons Files to Boost Stake, Says No Takeover</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CALABASAS, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lockheed Corp. said Friday it had shored
up its takeover defenses after Dallas investor Harold C. Simmons
disclosed he might boost his stake in the aerospace company.
   But Simmons said he considered his stake in Lockheed, builder of
the Stealth fighter and other military hardware, an investment only.
   ``It's not that big a deal. ... We have no intention of trying to
buy the whole company,'' Simmons said in a telephone interview.
   Simmons' Valhi Inc. filed notice Dec. 7 under the
Hart-Scott-Rodino Act that he intended to boost his Lockheed stake
beyond $15 million, the trigger point for the act's disclosure
provisions.
   Lockheed spokesman Bob Slayman refused to say if changes in the
company's 2-year-old ``poison pill'' shareholder rights plan were a
direct response to Simmons' move.
   At the time of the filing, Valhi said it owned 375,000 of
Lockheed's 59.5 million outstanding shares, or 0.63 percent.
   Simmons said the filing was intended to give him leeway to buy
more Lockheed stock with money anticipated from the planned sale of
his Amalgamated Sugar Co. to a British firm. However, that $300
million deal fell through, he said.
   The investor said he had not discussed the matter with Lockheed
officials.
   A Lockheed board vote to tighten the firm's takeover defenses was
taken Thursday, two weeks after the filing, Slayman said.
   The revised plan allows present shareholders to buy newly issued
stock at a discount if an outsider buys 20 percent or more of the
common stock.
   Such poison pill plans are intended to dilute the holdings of a
potential buyer, making a takeover prohibitively expensive.
   Lockheed, with headquarters in this Los Angeles suburb, has
88,000 employees in California, Georgia, New Jersey, Texas and New
Hampshire. The nation's fourth-largest defense contractor, Lockheed
had sales of $11.3 billion in 1987.
   In the first three quarters of this year, it reported a net
profit of $520 million on sales of $7.6 billion, with the profit
figure boosted significantly by sale of a subsidiary.
   Projects include the top-secret F-117A Stealth fighter, the
Trident II nuclear missile, the C-5B transport plane and work on
military communications, satellites, and the Strategic Defense
Initiative or Star Wars. The company also is a subcontractor for
design work on NASA's space station project.

   Here are sales results for the seven major U.S.
automakers for Dec. 11-20.
   Percentage changes in sales are based on average daily sales
during each period rather than comparisons of straight totals. There
were eight selling days in the period this year and eight last year.
For the month, there were 17 selling days this year and 17 last year.
   Cars and trucks made in the United States by Honda, Nissan,
Toyota and Mazda are counted as domestic and appear in this table.
Mazda 10-day sales figures were not available and were estimated.
Mazda began assembling cars at its Flat Rock, Mich., plant in
October 1987.
   Cars and trucks imported for sale under the GM, Ford and Chrysler
names are counted as foreign. Sales of imported cars and trucks are
reported at the end of each month.

<HEAD>Drexel Deal May Exclude Insider Trading; Protect Individuals</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICK GLADSTONE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Speculation grew Friday that the historic plea
deal sparing Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. from a wide-ranging
indictment excludes insider trading charges and omits names of at
least some individual lawbreakers.
   Sources who spoke on condition they not be identified said the
pact was structured to minimize the investment giant's exposure to
private civil lawsuits and put the staggering securities fraud case
behind it for good.
   But few specifics of the settlement could be learned, and by late
Friday no formal document had been filed by the Manhattan U.S.
attorney's office. Drexel spokesman Steven Anreder said it was
unclear when details would be released.
   Drexel agreed to settle the biggest fraud case in Wall Street
history Wednesday by paying a record $650 million in fines and
restitution to the government and pleading guilty to six felony
counts.
   The New York Times, quoting unidentified Drexel employees,
reported Friday that the six counts would concern alleged
manipulations of stock in Stone Container Corp., Fischbach Corp.,
MCA Inc. and C.O.M.B. Co., as well as ``stock parking'' violations
in Phillips Petroleum Co. and Harris Graphics Corp.
   Stock parking involves hiding ownership of stock in someone
else's name to avoid Securities and Exchange Commission disclosure
requirements.
   Five of the transactions mentioned by the Times involved Drexel's
relationship with Ivan F. Boesky, the now-imprisoned inside trader
who implicated the firm and its high-yield bond financier Michael
Milken when Boesky himself was exposed more than two years ago.
   The C.O.M.B. transaction was said to involve Drexel's
relationship with Princeton Newport Partners, a small New Jersey
securities concern that was dissolved earlier this month because of
racketeering and fraud charges against five of its principals and a
former Drexel bond trader.
   Pleading guilty to manipulation and parking charges is considered
less serious than insider trading, which is the use of nonpublic
information to profit in securities dealings.
   Lawyers said these pleas likely would lessen Drexel's
vulnerability to multiple lawsuits by private investors, since it is
difficult to prove financial losses resulted from such wrongdoing.
   The Times asserted that none of the charges would specifically
name any people who committed wrongdoing, which could further
insulate the firm and the individuals from civil litigation.
   But sources reached by The Associated Press said it wasn't clear
whether individuals would be named, suggesting this was still an
unresolved matter.
   The plea agreement capped an investigation of the Wall Street
giant that snowballed into the biggest securities fraud probe ever
and raised disturbing questions about the extent of greed and
conflicts of interest among the big dealers in the investment
banking business.
   The agreement still requires approval from the Justice Department
and SEC, which has accused Drexel, Milken and other employees of far
more widespread and insidious charges in a civil suit filed nearly
four months ago.
   There was no word Friday on whether the SEC would seek additional
sanctions against Drexel before consenting to the plea agreement and
dropping the suit.
   But there was widespread speculation that the enforcement agency
would require the expulsion of Milken from the securities business
and would likely impose stiff restraints on the operations of
Drexel's West Coast high-yield bond department, which Milken
currently heads.
   Drexel's agreement to cooperate in the government investigation
greatly increases pressure on Milken himself to settle as-yet
unfiled charges against him, which reportedly include racketeering
counts that carry enormous fines and lengthy prison terms if he is
convicted.
   But spokesmen for Milken said Friday that he was still
maintaining his innocence, and if indicted he would vindicate
himself in court.

   Takeover news and rumors, plus some yearend
``bargain'' shopping by traders, enabled the stock market to post a
moderate gain in light pre-Christmas trading Friday.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 8.57 to 2,168.93,
finishing the week with a net gain of 18.22 points.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 7 to 4 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
851 up, 488 down and 579 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 81.76 million
shares, down from 150.51 million Thursday and the lightest total
since a 72.09 million-share day on Nov. 25, the Friday after
Thanksgiving.
   Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including
trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the
over-the-counter market, totaled 99.13 million shares.
   Wall Streeters had expected a quiet day as many investors opted
to get an early start on the long holiday weekend.
   Brokers also said money managers at investing institutions had
pretty much finished their maneuvering for the year.
   However, stocks did attract a few nibbles from buyers as the
market opened. There has been a lot of talk on the Street lately of
accumulating stocks before New Year's to try to benefit from the
so-called January effect.
   Academic researchers have published many studies about an evident
tendency of stock prices to rise in the first month of the year.
Whether that phenomenon will persist in 1989, of course, remains to
be seen.
   In addition to that kind of bargain-hunting, those traders who
were present had several hot takeover stocks on their hands.
   American Brands, rumored to be a potential takeover target, led
the active list and jumped 10[ to 67}. One unconfirmed report was
that Unilever was preparing to offer as much as $90 a share.
   Rexene Corp., which said Thursday that it was engaged in talks
with a possible acquirer, climbed 6\ to 24{.
   Cummins Engine shot up 8~ to 67. Hanson PLC said it bought more
than 8 percent of the company's stock for ``investment'' purposes,
and Cummins said it intended to remain independent.
   Lin Broadcasting rose 2[ to 68 in the over-the-counter market. A
group including McCaw Cellular Communications said it plans to ask
for regulatory approval to increase its stake in the company.
   Gainers among the blue-chip and technology issues included Philip
Morris, up 1{ at 101]; American Telephone & Telegraph, up [ at 29[;
Digital Equipment, up 1] at 97], and International Business
Machines, up ~ at 123].
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market increased $10.58 billion, or 0.39
percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks gained
.56 to 156.06.
   Standard & Poor's industrial index rose 1.39 to 321.28, and S&P's
500-stock composite index was up 1.00 at 277.87.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market added
.84 to 377.34. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index closed at 302.22, up 1.89.

   Ford Motor Co. reported a 35.9 percent leap in car
sales in mid-December as overall sales of U.S.-made cars and light
trucks jumped 14.4 percent ahead of the same period in 1987,
automakers reported Friday.
   U.S. makers and foreign companies manufacturing in the U.S. said
they sold an average of 34,919 vehicles a day in the eight selling
days from Dec. 11-20, up from 30,522 a day in the same period a year
earlier.
   The Big Three U.S. automakers alone reported selling at a
slightly slower 33,081 vehicle-a-day rate but that was up 15.3
percent from 28,689 a day in mid-December 1987.
   Sales moved at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 8.2 million
vehicles, up from 7.2 million a year earlier.
   A year ago, with the Oct. 19 stock market crash still fresh in
their minds, people were gun-shy about large purchases, said
Jeanette Garretty, analyst with Bank of America in San Francisco.
   ``Generally, things have been a lot more stable in these last few
periods of 1988,'' she said.
   In the latest period, Ford said it sold 6,764 cars a day, up from
4,977 a day a year earlier. Ford said its truck sales of 4,118 a day
were up 21.5 percent from 3,391 a day in the year-ago period.
   Chrysler Corp. reported the greatest increase in light-truck
sales, a 28.1-percent jump to 3,177 a day from 2,481 in the 1987
period. Chrysler said its car sales reached 3,375 a day, up 20.5
percent from 2,801 a day.
   General Motors Corp. said its car sales rose 4.7 percent to a
10,365-a-day average, up from 9,896 a year earlier, and truck sales
increased 12.7 percent to 5,282 a day from 5,144.
   Sales of all U.S.-made cars and light trucks reached 11,322,465
for the year to date.
   Sales, now in the final period of the calendar year, appeared
unlikely to approach the record 16.3 million of 1986, second-best
15.7 million of 1985 or third-best 15.4 million of 1978.
   ``I don't see a real kick in sales here at the end of December,''
Garretty said. ``But it's a good year. Everybody will take it.''

   The energy futures market ended the week on a
strong note, although trading was extremely quiet in advance of the
Christmas holiday.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the February contract for
West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark grade of U.S. crude, settled
at $16.61 a barrel Friday, up 12 cents from Thursday, when it rose
19 cents. Other contract months were higher.
   Among refined petroleum products traded on the exchange Friday,
the Jaunuary contract for wholesale home heating oil rose 0.66 cent
to 53.14 a gallon. On Thursday the contract gained 0.56 cent.
   January wholesale unleaded gasoline, which rose 0.87 cent in the
previous session, increased 0.29 cent to 46.86 cents a gallon.
   Market sentiment has been upbeat in recent days, with many
traders increasingly confident that OPEC members will abide by a
production-cutting agreement forged last month.
   Although new production quotas aren't scheduled to begin until
Jan. 1, some members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries already have begun to cut output, analysts say.
   The oil market received an added boost Friday after Norway, a
non-OPEC member, said its oil output during the first half of 1989
would be cut by 115,000 barrels per day from earlier production
plans.
