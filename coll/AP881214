   Israelis from both major parties reacted coldly
and sometimes angrily Thursday to the U.S. decision to open talks
with the PLO, and one official said Israel was given no advance
notice of the move.
   Avi Pazner, spokesman for Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir of the
rightist Likud bloc, was quoted by Israel radio as lamenting the
U.S. move. He said Palestine Liberation Organization chief Yasser
Arafat has not changed his position despite his more moderate
language of recent weeks, the radio reported.
   ``They are cheap words and nothing more,'' Pazner was quoted as
saying.
   Police Minister Chaim Bar-Lev, a senior member of the
left-of-center Labor Party, said Arafat had made a ``small step
forward'' in his recent statements but fell short of renouncing
terror and recognizing Israel, as Washington had demanded.
   He said he doubted a planned U.S.-PLO meeting in Tunisia would
lead to substantive agreement because of the PLO's declaration of a
Palestinian state.
   ``If there is a meeting, not much will happen because the United
States is familiar enough with the problem to know that a
Palestinian state is not a solution,'' he said.
   Alon Liel, spokesman for the Foreign Ministry headed by Labor
Party leader Shimon Peres, said the Ministry was studying the
situation.
   U.S. Secretary of State George P. Shultz, who announced the
decision Wednesday in Washington, said he had discussed it
beforehand with representatives of Israel.
   But one Israeli official said on condition of anonymity that
neither Shultz nor other U.S. officials had consulted Israel in
advance.
   Israel has shunned any contacts with the PLO regardless of its
statements on recognizing Israel, abandoning terrorism, and
accepting U.N. Security Council Resolutions 242 and 338. The
resolutions call for Israeli withdrawal from occupied lands and
guarantee the rights of all states in the region to have secure
borders.
   Israeli officials have contended Arafat did not fully renounce
terrorism because he praised the yearlong Palestinian uprising, in
which Arabs have engaged in violent riots and attacked Israelis with
firebombs and other makeshift weapons.
   Politicians from both Likud and Labor said Thursday they believed
the PO had not fulfilled all the U.S. conditions for a dialogue.
Likud supporters were clearly angered by the U.S. move.
   Benny Begin, a Likud parliament member and son of former prime
minister Menachem Begin, said the PLO was known to Israelis as ``a
bunch of killers,'' and their aim of destroying Israel has not
changed.
   ``From our point of view, a snake wearing a jacket and tie is
nothing but a well-dressed snake,'' he said. ``We shall not
negotiate with these people because no one is expected to choose the
method of his own execution.''
   Binyamin Netanyahu, a former U.N. ambassador and close associate
of Shamir, said the decision was a ``terrible mistake.''
   ``The United States has breached its policy (of not talking to
the PLO) and the credibility of the United States has been
compromised,'' said Netanyahu, a Likud bloc parliament member.
   ``The American government has been either duped or they are
deceiving themselves. The American government will regret what they
have done once they realize who they are dealing with,'' he said in
a telephone interview.
   The U.S. decision was welcomed, however, by a leading member of
the liberal Citizens Rights Movement, which was allied with the
Labor Party in the Nov. 1 parliament elections.
   ``It's a great victory for American policy,'' said Ran Cohen, a
parliament member of the small party. ``With this new success, we
are at the beginning of the peace process.''
   Wednesday's announcement in Washington could upset sensitive
negotiations under way between Labor and Likud over the formation of
a new coalition government.
   Peres and Shamir have been bitterly divided on the peace issue,
and their reactions to Arafat's U.N. speech in Geneva on Tuesday
showed they were also divided on the PLO.
   Shamir earlier issued an uncompromising rejection of the PLO and
of Arafat's peace bid, labeling the U.N. speech as double-talk.
   Peres, however, complimented Arafat for the peace bid by saying:
``He has learned to say peace, and I welcome this. He is learning.''
   Peres also called for a peace dialogue with Palestinians
``immediately and without the Jordanians, if they so decide, as long
as they don't shoot.''
   The Labor leader said, however, that Arafat should do more to end
terrorism.

<HEAD>Students In Pioneering Scholarship Program Beat National Graduation

   A pioneering private effort to help
underprivileged students get college scholarships has achieved a
graduation rate sharply above the national average, a study
concluded.
   The 21-year-old, privately financed Cleveland Scholarship
Programs released a study of its first two decades Wednesday showing
80 percent of those who got grants from the program and enrolled in
four-year colleges graduated.
   Nationally, about 50 percent of students who start college
receive their degrees, the program said.
   CSP has assisted more than 57,000 students, most from Cleveland
public high schools, since its founding. Last year 3,700 students
received specialized help applying for college admission and
scholarships, and 540 underprivileged students received grants
averaging $375.
   Under the program, counseling is available to all students but
only students from underprivileged economic backgrounds can qualify
for its direct grants.
   ``They really helped me a lot,'' said Dwight W. Newsom, 34, who
graduated from Bowling Green State University in 1976 and is now a
sales executive with a concrete supply company.
   Newsom, the first member of his family to attend college, said
CSP provided him with crucial help meeting an array of unfamiliar
college admission and scholarship requirements and deadlines.
   ``As far as filling out paperwork, it was totally new for me,''
Newsom said.
   Christina R. Milano, the program's executive director, said the
result of the survey showed that ``a private partnership can have a
major impact on assisting economically disadvantaged students. ...
They can go on to college and be very successful.''
   CSP has 21 part-time counselers who visit high schools and meet
with students to help them apply to college and seek financial
assistance from various sources. Follow-up counseling continues
through the campus years.
   The alumni study was conducted by Eugene S. Uyeki of Case Western
Reserve University among a random sample of 633 students out of the
8,205 who received direct CSP grants from 1967 to 1983.
   Eighty-five percent of those surveyed had average family incomes
of less than $25,000 and more than half were the first family member
to attend college.
   CSP calls itself the nation's oldest non-profit, privately
supported college financial aid counseling service. It has been used
as a model for similar programs in New York, Miami and other cities.

   Bill XXII, the Naval Academy's mascot goat,
has died. But the duty of goading the Midshipmen to victory on the
football field won't go to Bill XXIII, Bill XXIV or Bill XXV.
They're too ornery.
   Bill XXVI, who like his predecessors is a long-haired Angora
goat, was named the mascot after Bill XXII was found dead Tuesday in
his pen at the academy's dairy farm, said spokesman Jim Kiser.
   Bill XXII had just about reached the end of his normal life
expectancy and apparently died peacefully in his sleep, said Kiser,
who did not know how old the goat was.
   ``I hope he rests in peace after faithful service since 1979,''
the academy spokesman aid.
   Kiser said Bills XXII-XXV were retired prematurely ``because of
unfavorable dispositions.''
   That means they were normal, ornery goats and didn't have the
gentle disposition of Bill XXII or the new mascot, a youngster that
is 12 to 18 months old.
   A goat became Navy's mascot in 1893 when when El Cid was brought
from the cruiser USS New York for the fourth Army-Navy game. The
Midshipmen won that one 6-4.

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The chairman of Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Co.,
the world's biggest company, resigned Wednesday under fire for
alleged involvement in a major business and political scandal.
   The minister of posts and telecommunications, Masaaki Nakayama,
told a news conference he accepted the resignation of the company's
chairman, Hisashi Shinto.
   Nakayama said Shinto denied any personal involvement in unethical
stock trading but accepted responsibility for actions by his
personal secretary.
   Japanese press reports said prosecutors traced about $81,000 to
Shinto's bank account from proceeds of the sale of shares in
Recruit-Cosmos Co., a real-estate subsidiary of the Recruit
conglomerate.
   Shinto on Tuesday issued a statement denying involvement in the
share transaction and said it was carried out by his personal
secretary, Kozo Murata, in 1986. Murata has since resigned as
Shinto's aide.
   The so-called Recruit scandal last week brought the resignation
of Kiichi Miyazawa as finance minister and deputy prime minister. It
has rocked Japan's business and political worlds with allegations
that government figures bought Recruit stock at low prices and made
huge profits when the company went public.
   The Recruit company allegedly sought favors by distributing
shares in Recruit-Cosmos with a guarantee of easy, tax-free profits.
   Nippon Telegraph and Telephone, ranked as the largest corporation
in the world in terms of stock market capitalization, had business
links with Recruit, which bought two U.S.-made supercomputers from
the company and leased data communications circuits from it.
   As a former telecommunications monopoly, the company has been
partially privatized, but Shinto and all other officials of the
utility remain under regulations that it illegal for them to receive
cash or shares from private firms that it does business with.
   Shinto has been the chief executive of the telecommunications
giant since 1981 when it was still a government-owned monopoly. He
oversaw the privatization, which started in 1985, and then took the
title of president.
   He held that post until June this year, when he became chairman
and chief executive, and the title of president went to Haruo
Yamaguchi.
   Shinto's resignation would make him the most prominent victim in
the business world of the Recruit scandal. It has also brought the
resignation of news media executives and has broken several
political careers in addition to that of Miyazawa, who a year ago
was a major contender to be prime minister.
   Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita is on a list of prominent
politicians whose aides profited from owning Recruit-Cosmos shares,
but he and the others denied any knowledge or involvement in the
transactions. Among the others are former Prime Minister Yasuhiro
Nakasone and Shintaro Abe, secretary-general of the governing
Liberal Democratic Party.
   The roots of the scandal go back to 1986, when unlisted
Recruit-Cosmos shares were offered to the prominent figures or their
aides, often to be paid for with loans from a Recruit-linked finance
company. The shares were listed for sale over the counter in October
1986 and immediately skyrocketed in value, yielding tax-free profits
when they were sold.

   Before he was fitted with his new
automated arms, 12-year-old Armando Gutierrez pulled on his shoes
and socks with his teeth and wrote with his foot.
   Now, his new battery-powered arms are helping him learn to do
everyday tasks in a more conventional way.
   ``It's easy. Nothing to it,'' said Armando, who lives in Las
Cruces, about 180 miles south of Albuquerque and was born with arm
stubs.
   Armando's occupational therapist, Teresa Pollpeter, said the boy
started using the mechanical arms correctly minutes after they were
fitted on him Nov. 30 at Carrie Tingley Hospital in Albuquerque.
   ``We put them on him one day, and he immediately started using
them accurately,'' Ms. Pollpeter said Tuesday. ``He already had the
muscle control mastered.''
   Now all he has to do is work on improving his accuracy, she said.
   The arms flex up and down, and hooks open and close when Armando
moves his shoulders a certain way. Thin cables attached to a switch
on each arm make them move.
   Each arm weighs about 3 pounds and is strapped over Armando's
stubs and onto his shoulders with a small harness on his back.
Batteries power the arms during the day and are recharged at night,
said Eloy Padilla, Armando's prosthetist.
   Armando is the second child to be fitted with the $12,000 arms at
the hospital. This particular line of prostheses has been available
for four years.
   His last pair was not automated, and he had to push the forearms
against an object to get them to lock in a bent position. Many
things were easier by foot than by hand as a result.
   He wrote with his left foot, holding the pencil between his big
toe and second toe, and he used to pull on his shoes and socks with
his teeth.
   ``When I was 5, I saw my mom drop a fork and pick it up with her
toes,'' he said. ``That's how I got the idea for (holding) the
pencil. I only have four toes, so I put the pencil where the space
is. It's easy.''
   Ms. Pollpeter said eating with the new arms has been the priority
for Armando.
   ``It's not totally acceptable to have your feet at the table, so
this is really going to help him,'' she said. ``His parents like for
him to use the prostheses. That's why we were eager for him to
master that skill.''
   He will work at home on the other tasks, such as getting dressed
and writing, Ms. Pollpeter said.

<HEAD>U.N. Report: American Teen-Agers Have Most Abortions In Developed
World</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER JAMES SPIELMANN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>UNITED NATIONS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   American teen-agers have the highest rate
of abortion in the developed world, more than double that of
teen-agers in most European countries, according to a new U.N.
report.
   The report released Tuesday by the world body's Population
Division also found the United States to have the highest teen-age
pregnancy rate, contrasting with declining rates in almost every
other developed country.
   About 9.8 percent of U.S. females ranging in age from 15 to 19
are becoming pregnant on an annual basis, the highest rate among the
nations studied. Hungary ranked second at 8.5 percent.
   Japan was lowest overall at 1 percent. The Netherlands was lowest
in Europe at 1.2 percent, and most other European nations averaged
about 3.5 percent.
   In the United States, 4.4 percent of women in the age group
studied had abortions on a yearly basis, compared with 2.7 percent
in Hungary, 0.5 percent in the Netherlands and 0.6 percent in Japan.
   The report, entitled ``Adolescent Reproductive Behavior,'' deals
only with developed nations. The pregnancy and abortion rates it
cites represent the latest figures available for each country.
   ``Liberalization of abortion laws does not always bring about an
increase in abortion rates,'' the report says. ``In Sweden, a
liberalization of the laws in 1975 brought about only a small
increase in rates.''
   ``The one outstanding characteristic of teen-agers requesting
abortion is that the majority of them are unmarried,'' the report
found.
   ``The option to carry a pregnancy to term is becoming less and
less popular among pregnant teen-agers,'' the report says. ``The
proportion of pregnancies that end in abortion has increased since
the early 1970s.''
   Examining other sexual trends, the report found that cohabitation
has gained popularity among European men and women of all ages.
   ``In the past, couples frequently lived together for short
periods before marriage, but such unions have become more and more
common and may or may not result in marriage,'' it says.
   The survey covered Eastern and Western Europe, the Soviet Union,
the United States and Canada, Japan, Australia and New Zealand.

   Even while denying Yasser Arafat a U.S. visa,
the State Department tried through public and private diplomacy to
induce the Palestine Liberation Organization to renounce terrorism
in all forms and explicitly recognize Israel's right to exist.
   The prize held out to Arafat was a ``substantive dialogue'' with
the United States, a major step toward U.S. acceptance of the
Palestinian leader who only two weeks ago had been condemned by
Secretary of State George P. Shultz as an ``accessory'' to acts of
terrorism.
   With Arafat already accepted by a number of West European
governments, an end to U.S. diplomatic isolation would have
strengthened his hand in the Palestinian conflict with Israel and
assured him a voice in any Mideast negotiations.
   But U.S. officials declared that the speech Arafat delivered to
the U.N. General Assembly in Geneva on Tuesday failed to meet the
three U.S. conditions for U.S. acceptance.
   Diplomatic sources said the State Department was so sure that
Arafat would satisfy the demands, Shultz had notified Moshe Arad,
the Israeli ambassador, on Monday night that if the PLO leader
followed through, the United States was prepared to hold the
dialogue Arafat had long sought.
   Sweden had acted as an intermediary over the past few weeks,
relaying the U.S. conditions and receiving in return what was taken
as advance word on what Arafat would say.
   In the end, though, Charles E. Redman, the State Department
spokesman, credited Arafat only with ``some interesting and positive
developments'' and said the PLO leader had failed to meet the U.S.
requirements.
   These include explicit acceptance of Israel's right to exist and
renunciation of terrorism in all forms. The third requirement is
approval of U.N. Security Council resolutions affirming that all
Middle Eastern states are entitled to live within secure borders.
   On the third point, the State Department found some significant
movement by Arafat. Last month, the Palestine National Council, the
would-be parliament of the PLO, merely said a peace conference could
be held under the 1967 and 1973 resolutions.
   Still, Redman said, ``These issues must be addressed clearly,
squarely and without ambiguity. That did not happen.''
   President-elect Bush said, meanwhile, that his administration
will not meet with the PLO based on what Arafat said in Geneva.
``We've got to get a much clearer statement of everything,'' he said.
   U.S. policy prohibits negotiations with the PLO, which is
committed by covenant to dismantling Israel as a Jewish state. As a
result, diplomatic sources said, ``pieces of paper'' were exchanged
through Sweden, a neutralist country which has taken a sympathetic
stance toward the PLO and hosted a meeting of a handful of American
Jews with Arafat after Shultz barred him from speaking to the
General Assembly in New York.
   Asked if the State Department had suggested language for Arafat
to use in his speech, Redman replied: ``What we have done is to
respond to requests from third parties, people who said, `Would you
provide us, tell us in specific terms, exactly what your position
is, what your conditions are?' And that, of course, we are happy to
do.''
   Referring to the way Arafat dealt with the U.S. conditions in the
speech, Redman said there were ``problems with all three.''
   The spokesman called the ``overall tone'' of the speech positive
and said the United States saw ``some movement'' by Arafat on the
two U.S. resolutions, but he did not elaborate.
   James Zogby, executive director of the Arab American Institute,
said Arafat had met the three U.S. conditions. He called U.S.
rejection of Arafat's speech ``gratuitous,'' and said it was based
more on Shultz's ``stubborn pro-Israel reflex than on sound
diplomacy.''
   Geoffrey Kemp, a senior associate at the Carnegie Endowment for
International Peace, said Arafat is ``inching along.''
   But Kemp, who served on the National Security Council in the
first Reagan administration, said, ``The problem is he is not
declaring Israel has a right to exist.''

<HEAD>WASHINGTON TODAY: Slowdown In Bush Appointments Concerns Even Some
Supporters</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   After a quick start, President-elect Bush is
falling behind the pace set by his predecessors in filling the
Cabinet, causing consternation among even some of his loyalists.
   He once boasted about how swiftly he was naming his team in
comparison with other recent presidents, but Bush now has fallen
behind Presidents Eisenhower and Nixon, who had their Cabinet
selections completed by this point in their transitions.
   Bush transition sources said the president-elect will announce as
early as today that he wants Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter to
be his agriculture secretary and that he has chosen Samuel Skinner
of Illinois to head the Transportation Department.
   Even so, Bush will still fall behind President Kennedy if he
hasn't filled his Cabinet by Saturday; behind President Carter if he
isn't done by next Friday.
   Among the snags:
   _A long delay in completion of the FBI's investigation into the
background of former Sen. John Tower may have seriously weakened
Tower's prospects for Senate confirmation even if he is, as
expected, ultimately appointed defense secretary.
   _The inability of Bush's transition team to come up with a
suitable job for former Transporation Secretary Elizabeth Dole has
left the wife of Senate Republican Leader Robert Dole awkwardly
hanging.
   _The contention of Bush's vice presidential chief-of-staff Craig
Fuller that no current member of Congress will be appointed to the
Cabinet, so as not to thin GOP ranks in the House, has infuriated
more than a few GOP lawmakers, according to sources.
   Transition and congressional GOP sources said that the edict
appeared aimed at softening the blow of a no-job-offer to Rep. Lynn
Martin, R-Ill., a vigorous political supporter of the vice president
from the early days of his campaign.
   If so, it may have been a case of overkill, taking along a dozen
or so other GOP lawmakers who had figured prominently in recent
Cabinet speculation. With a lopsided Democratic majority of 259 to
175 in the House, one or two fewer Republicans wouldn't have made
all that much difference.
   The move had echoes of an announcement on July 30, 1964, by
President Johnson that ended widespread speculation that he would
name then-Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy to be his vice
presidential running mate in the coming presidential election.
   At a hastily arranged television appearance, Johnson said that
members of his Cabinet were too valuable to him and that it would be
``inadvisable to select any member of my Cabinet'' as his running
mate.
   Kennedy, who resigned later that summer after winning the New
York Democratic Senate nominination, accepted Johnson's rationale
philosophically but responded that he was sorry he had to take so
many good men overboard with him.
   In a recent interview, New Hampshire Gov. John Sununu, whom Bush
has picked to be his presidential chief of staff, defended the
delays and blamed them on the necessity of conducting thorough and
meticulous background checks on each candidate for a Cabinet job.
However, Sununu conceded, ``You always wish things could go faster.''
   He said delays were inevitable ``as we get more and more people
to be reviewed and more and more (of a) stretching resources thin.''
   Little more than a week after the election, Bush boasted to
reporters that he was off to a quick start compared to predecessors
dating back to Eisenhower.
   At that time, he had already designated four members of his
Cabinet _ secretaries of State, Treasury, Education and an attorney
general and had picked a chief of staff.
   At a similar point in mid-November after their elections to the
White House, former Presidents Eisenhower, Kennedy, Nixon, and
Carter and President Reagan had not even begun to name Cabinet
choices, according to a breakdown provided by the Bush transition
office and cited by Bush in his conversation with reporters.
   Since then, Bush also has designated a national security adviser,
a press secretary, a trade representative, a CIA chief, a U.N.
ambassador, a chief economist and a secretary of Commerce.
   Still, he has already dropped behind Dwight Eisenhower, who
finished his Cabinet by Dec. 1, 1952, and Richard Nixon, who
completed his choices by Dec. 11, 1968.
   John F. Kennedy had his entire Cabinet announced by Dec. 17;
Jimmy Carter, by Dec. 23, 1976. Ronald Reagan, by contrast, didn't
have his Cabinet selection completed until Jan. 1, 1980.
   Congressional sources, who spoke on the condition of anonymity,
said Bush's delay in naming a defense secretary, and his treatment
of Mrs. Dole and Mrs. Martin, had dispirited some of Bush's most
faithful loyalists on Capitol Hill.

   Researchers who hope to study the secrets of
nature at the government's planned $4.4 billion super collider may
first need protection from a venomous ant with a penchant for
munching its way through underground cables.
   A 10,000-page environmental impact statement on the project says
the Texas site chosen by the Energy Department for the research
center is in an area infested with the fire ant.
   The ill-tempered ant inflicts painful bites, is blamed by local
residents for disabling home and farm equipment, and has caused
power failures by chewing through underground cables, the department
reports.
   Plans call for the super collider to be built in a 53-mile tunnel
under what is now farmland in Ellis County, Texas. Subatomic
particles will be accelerated to astronomical speeds inside the
tunnel and studied by scientists hoping to learn more about the
fundamental nature of matter and energy.
   Scientists, however, have yet to find a way to eradicate the fire
ant.
   The Energy Department says special attention will have to be paid
at the super collider site to the design of electrical facilities
and other underground components; construction practices to protect
workers from the ant's painful sting; and development of an
environmentally sound pesticide policy.
   Texans who commented on the super collider project to the Energy
Department said fire ants ``routinely tunnel to water table depths
in search of water, chewing their way through underground cables and
insulation around wiring en route,'' the impact statement said.
   ``Fire ants appear to be attracted to electrical equipment and
can cause shorts by chewing through insulation and by crowding into
spaces around electrical contacts,'' the study said.
   The study said local utility companies and highway departments
have reported problems with damage caused by the ants.
   Thirty years of study by federal and state agriculture officials
still has not yielded an effective method of eradicating the ant,
only control procedures, the study said. A Texas Department of
Agriculture representative told the Energy Department that the
control programs were only 80 percent effective.
   Fire ants also pose a health risk since their bite is painful and
can sometimes lead to serious reactions in humans, the study said.
   For most people, a sting results in swelling, pain and itching
that lasts a week, the study said. For others, immediate medical
attention may be needed, especially for a few victims so sensitive
to the ants' venom they go into shock.
   The final environmental impact statement examined all seven sites
that had been in contention for the super collider, incorporating
6,000 pages of comments and letters received after the draft
statement was released in August. The Energy Department announced in
November it would locate the project in Texas.

<HEAD>INS Plan Called Attack on Asylum for Central Americans</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETE YOST</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An attorney for a legal rights group says the
government's proposals on Nicaraguan asylum-seekers constitute a
broad attack on asylum for Central Americans.
   The U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service proposals could
sharply reduce Nicaraguans' chances of obtaining work permits while
they await decisions on asylum applications.
   If implemented fully, the draft INS proposals also could result
in detention for Central Americans whose asylum applications are
rejected and who are awaiting final decisions on deportation.
   ``I regard this as a broad attack on asylum,'' Arthur C. Helton,
director of the political asylum project of the Lawyers Committee
for Human Rights in New York, said Tuesday. ``The first victims are
the Nicaraguans in south Texas who are to be deprived of the
opportunity to subsist. But tens of thousands of other asylum
applicants will face unnecessary hardship on account of these
measures.''
   He said that while ``the immediate inspiration'' for the
proposals is a huge increase in Nicaraguans seeking asylum who have
come across the border in Texas, ``this is not a measure solely
attributable to the arrival of Nicaraguans.''
   Asylum applications from Salvadorans rose from 2,700 in fiscal
1987 to more than 27,000 for fiscal 1988, which ended Sept. 30.
   Immigration officials acknowledged that the proposals would apply
to other Central American asylum seekers as well as to Nicaraguans.
But they denied they are trying to discourage the filing of
legitimate asylum claims by Central Americans who have a
well-founded fear of persecution in their homeland.
   ``We have to have an orderly immigration system,'' said
immigration commissioner Alan Nelson said. ``We want those with
legitimate claims to immigrate and get them approved, but we must
avoid abuses, and we're seeing evidence of that in south Texas.''
   Nelson said that in Harlingen, salesmen are offering phony
packets of asylum documents to Nicaraguans and other Central
Americans.
   Nicaraguans are particularly upset over the proposals because
work permits would be withheld until after immigration officers make
a determination of whether the asylum claim is legitimate.
   Under a July 1987 directive from then-Attorney General Edwin
Meese III, Nicaraguans in most instances were automatically granted
permits allowing them to work here legally while their asylum
requests were pending.
   The backlog of cases has risen steadily since then and Nelson
said the agency is increasing efforts to review some 22,000 pending
asylum claims from Nicaraguans, starting with the most recent
applicants.
   Canceling work permits issued to Nicaraguans or not issuing work
permits to new asylum applicants won't stop the influx of
Nicaraguans into the United States, said Roberto Arguello, chairman
of the public relations committee of the Nicaraguan American Bankers
Association in Miami.
   The INS steps are ``not going to stop people from coming,''
agreed Maritza Herrera, executive director of the Nicaraguan
American Foundation in Miami. ``They come here and they're going to
stay in the underground economy, underpaid.''

   The bottom is falling out of the weekly A.C.
Nielsen Co. prime-time listings now that CBS has dropped five of
last week's 10 lowest-rated shows.
   Gone from the schedule are ``Annie McGuire,'' ``The Van Dyke
Show,'' ``Raising Miranda,'' ``Dirty Dancing'' and ``Simon &
Simon,'' CBS announced Tuesday.
   At the other end, a repeat of NBC's ``Night Court'' returned to
Thursday night for a week and was the No. 1 show last week. Its
regular time period this season is Wednesday. The new show, ``Dear
John,'' was taking a night off.
   The rest of the top 10 were: NBC's ``The Cosby Show,''
``Cheers,'' ``A Different World'' and ``Golden Girls,'' ABC's
``Roseanne,'' CBS' ``60 Minutes,'' ABC's ``Who's the Boss?'' and
NBC's ``L.A. Law'' and ``Empty Nest.'' Some of the shine appeared to
be off ABC's ``Moonlighting.'' Its season premiere ranked 13th,
compared with last season's premiere at fifth. Another ABC season
premiere, ``thirtysomething,'' ranked only 29th.
   On Sunday, NBC ran the network premiere of the film ``Spies Like
Us'' against ABC's ``Roots: The Gift'' and came out at 17th to
``Roots''' 25th.
   NBC won the week for the 25th straight time. Its average,
prime-time rating was 15.1; ABC had 13.2; CBS 10.7.
   The news race was a virtual tie with less than half a rating
point separating the three broadcasts. The ``CBS Evening News''
edged the others with an 11.2 rating. ``ABC World News Tonight'' had
a 10.9. ``NBC Nightly News'' had a 10.8.
   Each rating point represents 904,000 households with television.
   The lowest-rated prime-time shows last week were: ABC's analysis
of President Reagan's news conference, ``Simon & Simon,'' ``Murphy's
Law,'' ``West 57th,'' ``Dirty Dancing,'' ``TV 101,''
``Knightwatch,'' ``Raising Miranda,'' ``The Van Dyke Show'' and
``Annie McGuire.''
   CBS canceled ``Van Dyke'' and ``Raising Miranda.'' ``Dirty
Dancing'' was put ``on hiatus.'' Mary Tyler Moore's ``Annie
McGuire'' and ``Simon & Simon'' were removed from the schedule but
might return. CBS said it would move ``TV 101'' from Tuesday to
Wednesday night.
   ABC already has canceled another of the bottom 10,
``Knightwatch.''

   State police arrested a 35-year-old New
Bedford man Tuesday and accused of kidnapping and raping a woman
along Interstate 195 in the same area where six bodies have been
found since July.
   Raymond Veary, an assistant district attorney in Bristol County,
declined to comment on a report by WBZ-TV in Boston that the man was
a suspect in the killings as well.
   Veary said the man, Neil Andersen, was scheduled for arraignment
Wednesday morning in New Bedford District Court on charges of
kidnapping and aggravated assault stemming from an incident in
August 1987 along Interstate 195 in the town of Dartmouth.
   The television station reported that the victim was a former
prostitute, but Veary declined to confirm or deny the report.
   State police officers attached to the Bristol County district
attorney's office made the arrest at 4:30 p.m., Veary said.
   The partially clad skeletons of the six women were found within a
few miles of each other along I-95 and Route 140 in Dartmouth and
Freetown. Just three of the bodies have been identified.
   The most recent discovery of a body occurred Saturday. Police say
the woman apparently had been dead since spring, longer than the
other five victims.
   District Attorney Ronald A. Pina has said he believed the six
killings were likely the victims of the same killer or killers. He
said it is believed the victims had ties to New Bedford's Weld
Square neighborhood, known for prostitution and drugs.

   Undercover wildlife agents have found
``flagrant'' poaching violations and ``unsporting practices'' by
waterfowl hunting businesses along the Texas coast that led to
charges against 210 people in seven states.
   The poaching violations come at a time when duck populations are
already hurt by an eight-year drought in their breeding grounds.
   ``Duck numbers already are near record lows because of the
drought and continued destruction of their natural habitat,'' said
Frank Dunkle, director of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. ``They
cannot long withstand additional losses from illegal harvest.''
   More than 100 wildlife service agents spent three years in an
undercover investigation of 41 commercial waterfowl hunting
businesses on the Texas coast, documenting more than 1,300
violations in one of the agency's biggest operations, officials said.
   ``During this investigation, service agents reported flagrant
violations of laws intended to protect waterfowl,'' Dunkle said
Tuesday. ``Law-abiding waterfowlers are outraged by these unethical
and unsporting practices that betray total lack of concern for the
status of waterfowl populations.''
   Agents from around the country went undercover to book hunts with
guides and owners of hunting businesses charging $65 to 500 a day
who were suspected of killing waterfowl illegally and encouraging
and helping customers to do likewise. Alleged violations occurred on
92 percent of the hunts, the service said.
   The agency said 23 hunting guides and owners were being arrested,
22 of them in Texas and one in Iowa. Indictments or charges
contained in a federal document named 50 others, and 137 people were
to receive misdemeanor notices of violation in Texas, Alabama,
Georgia, Maryland, Michigan and Oklahoma.
   Charges include shooting more than the legal limit; ``rallying,''
or stirring up waterfowl to drive them toward hunters; use of lead
shot in steel shot zones; failure to retrieve shot fowl _ wanton
waste; use of electronic calls; taking birds after the season has
closed or outside legal hunting hours; and tagging and
record-keeping violations, such as claiming birds belonged to
someone who had not hunted that day, or falsifying when birds were
shot.
   In several cases, the service said raptors, herons, ibises and
other non-game migratory birds were allegedly killed and sold to
undercover agents.
   Agents documented one case in which a dozen hunters in blinds
around a pond shot as many geese as they could, killing more than
200 birds _ 139 over their limit.
   Wildlife service spokeswoman Megan Durham said the agents went
undercover because the violations were occurring ``behind locked
gates and in remote areas and it's difficult to get information any
other way.''
   Maximum penalties for the misdemeanors could be six months to one
year in prison, and fines of $5,000 to $100,000 for individuals and
$10,000 to $200,000 for organizations, depending on the charge.
   Maximum penalties for felony violations could be two to five
years in prison and fines of $250,000 for individuals and $500,000
for organizations, depending on the charge.

   A director of a new U.S.-Soviet effort to help
American businesses sell everything from cosmetics to caviar in the
Soviet Union says he expects Moscow to relax its limits on foreign
ownership of companies early next year.
   Current Soviet law requires that joint business ventures be no
more than 49 percent foreign owned, but Randy Bregman of
Washington-based APCO Associates said he expects this to be
liberalized, possibly within the first three months of 1989.
   APCO is an affiliate of the law firm of Arnold & Porter, which
held a news conference Tuesday to announce that APCO had set up a
joint venture with INFEKS, a six-month-old Soviet consulting
cooperative affiliated with the U.S.S.R. Ministry of Foreign
Economic Relations.
   New Soviet efforts to open and restructure the country's economy
offer ``access to a market of 280 million highly educated Soviet
consumers with an enormous need for goods and technology,'' said
James Jones, the firm's managing partner.
   He said Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's policies are
``setting an exciting new course for East-West business
relationships.''
   Bregman, director of Soviet and East European services for APCO,
said the new venture will help American businesses set up joint
operations with Soviet cooperatives and other enterprises.
   Speaking before a Soviet and U.S. flag and with a direct
telephone hookup to Moscow, officials said the partners in the
venture would draw up final details and meet with prospective
clients later this week.
   Bregman said APCO hopes to double the number of U.S.-Soviet
ventures by the end of next year. Ten joint U.S.-Soviet business
agreements have been concluded to date, along with about 100 Soviet
ventures with businesses from other countries, he said.
   Bregman said he looks to the day when a Soviet citizen can buy
borscht made by Campbell Soup Co. He said Campbell is not one of the
companies now involved, but this is an example of the kind of
enterprise that might result from the new agreement.
   Bregman declined to name companies that might deal with the
Soviets through APCO, but he said they include about a dozen
companies involved in food processing, pollution control, medical
equipment, cosmetics, tourism and telecommunications. One U.S.
company even wants to get into caviar production, he said.
   Vladimir Gusinsky, INFEKS president, said from Moscow that the
Soviet enterprise is part of the economic ``perestroika,'' or
restructuring, under way in his country.
   ``We are looking forward to developing economic relations with
U.S. companies,'' Gusinsky said through a translator who also
translated the Washington news conference in Russian over the
telephone hookup.
   Gusinsky and other INFEKS officials were to arrive in Washington
later this week.
   APCO President Margery Kraus said the company, which also has set
up joint ventures with Japanese and Israeli businesses, would open
an office in Moscow early next year.
   She said the company would provide ``one-stop shopping'' for
companies wanting to do business in the Soviet Union, charging fees
for its services. She said there were no plans for APCO to share in
profits of the joint ventures it helps set up.

<HEAD>EPA Says Farming Responsible For Much Ground Water Pollution</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Environmental Protection Agency says ground
water has been contaminated by pesticides in parts of 38 states, but
it cautions that more study is needed before the full extent of such
pollution can be determined.
   The agency said Tuesday a review of 150 ground water studies over
the past 10 years found 74 different chemicals in 38 states. Similar
findings had been announced by advocacy groups using EPA documents
obtained under the Freedom of Information Act.
   The EPA has added new information: Farming has put 46 chemicals
in the ground water of 26 states and 32 chemicals got into ground
water in 12 states because of ``point source'' pollution, such as an
accidental spill.
   Unknown sources account for 28 chemicals in 12 states, not
necessarily the same 12 involved in point-source contamination.
   ``There are dangers'' in trying to draw national conclusions from
the data, which are ``not appropriate for assessing human
exposure,'' said Victor Kimm, acting assistant administrator in
charge of pesticides.
   ``Many agricultural areas have not been sampled and are not
statistically represented,'' he said.
   The studies sampled shallow sampling wells and aquifers used for
irrigation in addition to drinking water.
   The agency said concentrations generally were below its ``health
advisory'' levels for drinking water, but some were not.
   EPA is in the process of sampling 1,300 drinking water wells
nationwide to check for 125 different chemicals according to a
statistically based scheme that should yield national conclusions in
late 1989 or early 1990.
   The studies responsible for Tuesday's findings were conducted by
government agencies, universities and holders of pesticide licenses,
and EPA said it was still interviewing the authors to check the
validity of their work.
   Diane Baxter, staff scientist of the National Coalition Against
the Misuse of Pesticides, said she was not surprised by EPA's
findings. ``This is the tip of the iceberg. As more samples are
taken, we are going to find more instances of contamination.''
   John McCarthy, vice president for science and regulatory affairs
at the National Agricultural Chemicals Association, a pesticide
manufacturers' trade group, agreed that the results were not
appropriate for assessing human exposure, and said ``EPA's current
sampling is the kind of information we will look to as to whether
there's a health issue.''
   Until 1979, pesticides had been thought not to get into ground
water, but to remain bound to soil. Since then, concern has risen as
more and more contamination has been found.
   When EPA announced a proposed pesticides-in-ground water strategy
in February, it said it knew of 19 pesticides from farming in the
ground water of 24 states.

   Rising interest rates threaten to end a recent
letup in losses by savings institutions, some economists say.
   According to the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, losses for the
nation's 3,024 S&Ls had dropped to $1.6 billion in the
July-September period, down from $3.9 billion in both the first and
second quarters.
   Most of the improvement came in non-operating losses _ meaning
institutions wrote off fewer bad loans. They dropped from $3.6
billion in the second quarter to $1.4 billion in the third.
   James Barth, chief economist of the bank board, declined to
predict non-operating losses in the current October-December
quarter, but he said operating profits, which rose in the third
quarter, will be hurt because of rising interest rates this quarter.
   Rising interest rates narrow the spread between what an
institution has to pay for its money and what it can earn on loans
and other investments.
   ``Interest rates do not bode well for the future,'' said Martin
Regalia, chief economist of the National Council of Savings
Institutions, a trade group.
   The bank board released the loss figures for the third quarter
two weeks ago. On Tuesday, in a more detailed report, it said the
number of insolvent savings institutions continued to fall. But, it
said, even as government rescues soared, other institutions were
slipping.
   The bank board said 434 S&Ls were insolvent at the end of
September, down from 498 three months earlier and substantially
lower from the peak of 520 at the end of last year.
   However, regulators had to ``resolve'' the cases of 129 insolvent
institutions _ either through rescues or closures _ to whittle down
the insolvent list by 86 over the first nine months of the year.
That means 43 other institutions slipped into the red.
   In the third quarter, an additional 150 institutions were on the
edge of insolvency, with capital levels between zero and 1.5 percent.
   Losses for the first nine months _ $9.4 billion _ already surpass
last year's post-Depression record of $7.8 billion. As in the past,
the losses were heavily concentrated in Texas and in just a few
institutions in the third quarter.
   The 244 Texas thrifts _ 114 of them insolvent _ reported losses
of $1.7 billion. All thrifts outside of Texas managed a modest gain
of $45 million. The worst 20 institutions _ 14 of them in Texas _
lost $1.3 billion.
   ``It may be misconstruing it to say, `Hey, we're coming out of
the woods.' These numbers say, `Hey, you're still losing a lot of
money.' ... It's nothing to get euphoric over,'' Regalia said.
   ``The hole is still bigger, it's just not getting bigger as fast.
You can take some solace in that. I just wouldn't take too much
solace,'' he said.
   Barth said the quarterly loss would have been $2 billion without
the government actions, still a substantial improvement.
   But, Bert Ely, an analyst in Alexandria, Va., said a large
portion of the industry's operating income is coming from a flow of
assistance income to restructured institutions.
   Ely said the bank board made assistance payments of $528 million
in the third quarter, up from $466 million in the second quarter.
Payments on government promissory notes were $948 million, up from
$101 million, he said.
   ``There's a substantial amount of income support coming in. ...
It is adding to income level, it is adding to the bottom line,'' he
said.
   All three economists expressed concern about the effect of rising
interest rates on thrift earnings in the current quarter, which will
be released by the bank board in March.
   Also, Ely and Regalia noted that non-operating losses frequently
rise sharply in the final quarter of the year because institutions
often account for loan losses as they prepare their books for the
end of the year.
   The condition of S&Ls stands in stark contrast to the relative
health of commercial banking. Despite more than 200 bank failures so
far this year, banking as a whole posted record profits totaling
$16.4 billion in the first nine months of the year.

   Undercover wildlife agents have found
``flagrant'' poaching violations and ``unsporting practices'' by
waterfowl hunting businesses along the Texas coast that led to
charges against 210 people in seven states.
   The poaching violations come at a time when duck populations are
already hurt by an eight-year drought in their breeding grounds.
   ``Duck numbers already are near record lows because of the
drought and continued destruction of their natural habitat,'' said
Frank Dunkle, director of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. ``They
cannot long withstand additional losses from illegal harvest.''
   More than 100 wildlife service agents spent three years in an
undercover investigation of 41 commercial waterfowl hunting
businesses on the Texas coast, documenting more than 1,300
violations in one of the agency's biggest operations, officials said.
   ``During this investigation, service agents reported flagrant
violations of laws intended to protect waterfowl,'' Dunkle said
Tuesday. ``Law-abiding waterfowlers are outraged by these unethical
and unsporting practices that betray total lack of concern for the
status of waterfowl populations.''
   Agents from around the country went undercover to book hunts with
guides and owners of hunting businesses charging $65 to $500 a day
who were suspected of killing waterfowl illegally and encouraging
and helping customers to do likewise. Alleged violations occurred on
92 percent of the hunts, the service said.
   The agency said 23 hunting guides and owners were being arrested,
22 of them in Texas and one in Iowa. Indictments or charges
contained in a federal document named 50 others, and 137 people were
to receive misdemeanor notices of violation in Texas, Alabama,
Georgia, Maryland, Michigan and Oklahoma.
   Charges include shooting more than the legal limit; ``rallying,''
or stirring up waterfowl to drive them toward hunters; use of lead
shot in steel shot zones; failure to retrieve shot fowl _ wanton
waste; use of electronic calls; taking birds after the season has
closed or outside legal hunting hours; and tagging and
record-keeping violations, such as claiming birds belonged to
someone who had not hunted that day, or falsifying when birds were
shot.
   In several cases, the service said raptors, herons, ibises and
other non-game migratory birds were allegedly killed and sold to
undercover agents.
   Agents documented one case in which a dozen hunters in blinds
around a pond shot as many geese as they could, killing more than
200 birds _ 139 over their limit.
   Wildlife service spokeswoman Megan Durham said the agents went
undercover because the violations were occurring ``behind locked
gates and in remote areas and it's difficult to get information any
other way.''
   Maximum penalties for the misdemeanors could be six months to one
year in prison, and fines of $5,000 to $100,000 for individuals and
$10,000 to $200,000 for organizations, depending on the charge.
   Maximum penalties for felony violations could be two to five
years in prison and fines of $250,000 for individuals and $500,000
for organizations, depending on the charge.

   Jurors in Lyndon LaRouche's tax fraud
trial are being asked to decide whether items ranging from free
meals to free underwear should be considered taxable income.
   For four hours in an overheated federal courtroom Tuesday, as
jurors stifled yawns and a U.S. marshal dozed off, defense lawyers
and government prosecutors bickered over the arcane language of the
federal tax code.
   The issue was whether LaRouche, a perennial minor-party
presidential candidate, broke the law by failing to file federal
income tax returns for any year since 1978.
   LaRouche argues that he had no taxable income because all his
personal expenses were paid by various corporations he controls.
   ``Mr. LaRouche does not have to file income tax returns for 1979
through 1987 nor pay income taxes for that period,'' declared
Washington accountant Thomas E. Seay, who was hired by defense
lawyers to conduct a yearlong review of LaRouche's financial records.
   Seay argued that LaRouche was an employee of all the groups he
headed and that under the tax code, what he received from his
``employers'' as their business expense _ including meals, lodging,
plane flights, bodyguards, horseback rides and even the new set of
underwear during his campaign travels _ was ``non-taxable
compensation.''
   What if he accepted a free trim of ``such hair as he has,'' asked
defense attorney Odin Anderson, prompting a grin from the balding
LaRouche.
   The courtroom erupted in laughter when Seay responded that it
might be considered a ``fringe benefit'' from LaRouche's employers.
   Under questioning by government prosecutors, Seay conceded he had
been denied access to financial records prior to July 1985 which
were seized when federal agents raided LaRouche's Leesburg, Va.,
headquarters in October 1986.
   The accountant acknowledged he was relying on court testimony in
concluding that LaRouche had never received enough taxable income _
currently a minimum of $1,080 _ to require filing a tax return.
   Seay testified as defense lawyers pushed to wrap up their case
before the end of the fourth week of the trial in U.S. District
Court.
   Besides a charge of conspiring to defraud the Internal Revenue
Service, LaRouche and six associates are accused of mail fraud and
conspiracy for allegedly raising more than $30 million in loans from
supporters without any intention of repaying them.
   If convicted of all 13 counts against him, LaRouche would face a
maximum penalty of 65 years in prison and fines totaling $3.25
million.
   Another key defense witness Tuesday was Mayer Morganroth, a tax
lawyer from New York and Southfield, Mich., who said he advised
LaRouche in 1979 that he did not have to file any income tax returns.
   Morganroth said his opinion, endorsed at a second conference on
LaRouche's tax status in late 1984, was that the goods and services
provided to LaRouche were not payments but instead were intended to
yield benefits to his publishers and other LaRouche entities that
promoted his causes.
   San Francisco lawyer Richard Morris told the trial jury that he
had numerous contacts with LaRouche operatives while he was an aide
to former White House national security adviser William P. Clark in
1982-83.
   Morris said he considered their positions on such issues as
Soviet intelligence, terrorism and Third World debt, but never
divulged any information in return.
   He said he curbed those contacts when CIA and defense
intelligence officials warned him that LaRouche was ``a socialist, a
fascist, a communist, a member of the KGB and even a Democrat.''

<HEAD>Pay Raise Plan Comes with String Attached</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM DRINKARD</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A presidential advisory commission is proposing
a hefty pay raise for Congress, but it also is pushing lawmakers
toward a dilemma: whether to abandon income from speaking fees in
return for higher salaries.
   ``Members of Congress are caught in a vise between editorial
writers and reporters, who are opposed to honoraria, and voters, who
are opposed to pay raises,'' said Sen. George Mitchell, D-Maine, who
will be the Senate majority leader in the next Congress.
   ``It is apparent, however, that there is a serious perception
problem regarding honoraria, which Congress will have to consider
along with the salary issue early next year,'' Mitchell said in a
statement.
   The Commission on Executive, Legislative and Judicial Salaries
met on Tuesday and approved recommendations for pay increases
averaging 50 percent next year for the government's top 2,500
officials. That would send members of Congress from their current
pay of $89,500 to $135,000.
   But in an unusual move, the panel also included strong language
linking the pay boost to a ban on congressional speaking fees, which
reached a record $9.8 million in 1987. Such a ban would require
separate action by Congress.
   House leaders have spoken out in favor of such a ban. In the
Senate, where members are allowed to take home more in speaking fees
and are generally in greater demand as speakers, the issue is more
difficult.
   It is now up to President Reagan to decide whether to accept or
modify the commission's recommendations. He will include his
decision in the budget he sends Congress on Jan. 9, and any pay
raise would automatically take effect 30 days later unless both the
House and Senate vote to head it off.
   Mitchell was noncommittal on the pay raise, saying only that he
looked forward to reviewing the president's suggestions. Senate
Minority Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan., said he would meet with Mitchell
on the subject next week.
   In the House, leaders said they planned to support both the
increase that the president recommends and the ban on outside
speaking fees. ``Any honoraria known to mankind or yet to be
conceived should be covered'' by the ban, said Rep. Tony Coelho,
D-Calif., the No. 3 official in the Democratic leadership.
   But Coelho said leaders are braced for an onslaught of criticism
from the public and from lawmakers who fear the political backlash
of accepting such a large raise when their salaries already are far
higher than the average American's.
   It appeared likely that, as in 1986, the Senate would vote to
turn down the raise and the House would take the heat for allowing
the 30-day clock to run out without voting on the increase.
   Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist welcomed the pay-raise
proposal, saying it ``is bound to be encouraging to the nation's
federal judges.''
   ``The commission's salary recommendations would restore to those
judges the cuts in real income which have been caused by inflation
over the last 20 years,'' Rehnquist said.
   Commission chairman Lloyd Cutler said federal courts have been
particularly hard hit by the erosion in salaries caused by
inflation. ``Judges are leaving in droves,'' he said, because they
can make far more money in private legal practice.
   Ralph Nader, the self-styled consumer advocate, contested the
commission's argument that it was only seeking to restore purchasing
power lost by members of Congress and other federal officials over
the past two decades. He noted that in 1964, lawmakers were paid
$22,500. Two years ago they received a $12,100 increase to the
current level of $89,500.
   ``It sounds like members of Congress and their peers in the other
branches of government have kept up with inflation quite well,'' he
said. ``While members of Congress have been overly generous to
themselves, they have failed to act to increase wages for the 6.7
million workers who are at or below the minimum wage,'' Nader said.

<HEAD>Chinese Lab Could Boost Crop Production In United States</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Not only is China a big grain customer of the
American farmer, there's a new laboratory in Beijing that may help
develop trade with the United States in tiny organisms that protect
crops from destructive insects and weeds.
   The new research operation was announced Tuesday by the
Agriculture Department as a way to help find natural enemies of
insects and weeds that threaten crops in the two countries.
   Ultimately, the exchange of ``biocontrol'' organisms and
scientific information could help boost crop production in both
China and the United States.
   Orville G. Bentley, assistant secretary for science and
education, said the new Sino-American Biological Control
Collaborative Laboratory is located at the Chinese Academy of
Agricultural Sciences.
   Under a five-year agreement with the academy, three USDA
scientists will go to the laboratory next May and conduct research
there for six months each year. They will work in the United States
the remaining six months of the year.
   Richard S. Soper, biocontrol research leader in the department's
Agricultural Research Service, said the Beijing laboratory will be a
quarantine and research facility for exchanging potential biocontrol
organisms between the two countries.
   The targeted U.S. pests include: leafy spurge, a noxious
rangeland weed; two water weeds, hydrilla and watermilfoil; and the
Russian wheat aphid. Soper said the aphid is ``the most worrisome
pest.'' It was first spotted in the United States in 1986 and has
spread rapidly to wheat-growing areas.
   Pests of concern to China are: croftonweed, a weed so toxic to
horses that they can't be kept on certain land; scale insects; and
apple leaf mites.
   Next year the Chinese academy is expected to send scientists to
USDA laboratories in Fort Lauderdale, Fla.; and Buenos Aires,
Argentina.
   Soper said scientists at four agency laboratories in France,
Italy, South Korea and Argentina are searching overseas to find
biocontrols for U.S. pests. But until now, he said, scientists have
not been able to easily explore most of the vast Eurasian land area.
   ``The new lab takes care of much of Asia that we've missed, and
we're hoping we can develop similar arrangements with the Soviets,''
he said.
   Meanwhile, the USDA also announced that private exporters have
sold China an additional 400,000 metric tons of U.S. wheat at
subsidized prices for shipment in January and February.
   The sales, equal to about 14.7 million bushels, were handled by
four companies: Cargill Inc., 190,000 tons; Central States
Enterprises Inc., 40,000; Richco Grain Ltd., 40,000; and Ferruzzi
USDA Inc., 130,000.
   Melvin E. Sims, general sales manager for the department's
Foreign Agricultural Service, said the sales were part of an
authorized 1 million tons of wheat announced on Dec. 7 under the
Export Enhancement Program, or EEP. About 10,000 tons also remained
of an earlier EEP authorization.

   The Agriculture Department has granted 13
states a total of $2.9 million to help finance mediation efforts
between financially strapped farmers and their creditors.
   La Verne Ausman, acting administrator of the Farmers Home
Administration, said Tuesday the funds _ to be matched by the states
_ will be used to ``resolve differences between other lenders and
farmers'' who have loans from the USDA agency.
   The money, he said, ``will help make it possible for a neutral,
third party mediator to cast a fresh eye on the problem. Many
disputes are resolved in this manner.''
   For example, the FmHA and other lenders might agree to write
down, or reduce, a borrower's debt or in some other way work
together to help the farmer meet his obligations.
   The matching grants were authorized in the Agricultural Credit
Act passed by Congress last year.
   States qualifying for the FmHA grants in the fiscal year that
began Oct. 1 are: Alabama, $110,208; Iowa, $305,000; Kansas,
$431,150; Minnesota, $500,000; Mississippi, $75,040; Montana,
$75,000; Nebraska, $168,140; North Dakota, $250,000; Oklahoma,
$269,870; South Dakota, $97,000; Texas, $500,000; Wisconsin,
$87,440; and Wyoming, $25,000.

   The final $90 million in this year's budget for
a program to help promote U.S. farm exports has been allocated by
the Agriculture Department.
   Under the Targeted Export Assistance program, or TEA as it is
called, various trade organizations get government funds to carry
out overseas promotion of designated agricultural products.
   In most cases, the sponsoring organizations put up some of their
own funds in carrying out a specific project, although the amounts
of those contributions vary and are subject to negotiation with the
department.
   The level of TEA spending was set by the 1985 farm law at $110
million annually through fiscal 1988 and at $325 million in each of
the following two years. However, the USDA's appropriation act for
1989 reduced the level to $200 million.
   An initial allocation of $110 million was announced on Aug. 17,
and the $90 million announced Tuesday completes the program funding
for the 1989 fiscal year that began Oct. 1.
   The largest amount, $8.2 million, was reserved for applicants to
promote the overseas sales of almonds, followed by $8.1 million for
the U.S. Meat Export Federation. Other leading recipients include:
Cotton Council International, $7.1 million; American Plywood
Association, $5.9 million; and National Forest Products Association,
$4.85 million.

   This has been ``a decade of progress for women
on television'' _ especially for female characters in prime time _
but the industry must be monitored to ensure further gains, the
National Commission on Working Women said.
   The accolade and note of caution came Tuesday as the commission
released a report entitled ``Ten Years in Prime Time: An Analysis of
the Image of Women on Entertainment Television, 1979-1988,'' which
examined the portrayal of women and compared the fictional panorama
with the profile of real-life women during the decade.
   ``The 1980s mark a decade of progress for women on television.
Their portrayals have become more diverse and, for the most part,
more true-to-life,'' the report said.
   ``... The networks get a pat on the back,'' said the study's
author, Sally Streenland.
   The study said 60 percent of female characters on the 25 top
Nielsen rated shows in 1979 were portrayed as employed outside the
home. By 1987, that figure had risen to 75 percent.
   By comparison, 1987 population statistics from the U.S. Census
Bureau show that 56 percent of all women were in the labor force.
   Streenland's study also showed TV painting an unrealistically
rosy picture of the types of jobs held by women.
   In 1979, more than 40 percent of television's women were employed
in clerical or service jobs. By 1987 only 23 percent of the women on
TV had the lower skilled jobs and more than half had professional
careers.
   The real life situation is that 47 percent of working women have
clerical and service occupations and only 24 percent work in
professional or managerial jobs.
   The report also showed that black women have become more visible
on TV. In 1979 there was only one black female character on
television, but by 1987, 22 percent of women characters were black.

   Three environmental groups filed suit
Tuesday to force the U.S. Department of Energy to prepare an
environmental impact statement before restarting the three reactors
at the Savannah River Plant.
   Restarting the reactors constitutes a ``major federal action
significantly affecting the quality of the human environment,''
according to the suit filed in U.S. District Court in Washington and
announced here.
   Under terms of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, the
Energy Department must prepare an environmental impact statement if
such a condition exists, according to the suit.
   In another development, The New York Times reported in
Wednesday's editions that a key advisory panel told the Energy
Department that its plan to restart the plant is flawed.
   The department's principal scentific advisory committee said the
reactor at Savannah River should not be allowed to return to
operation until more complete inspections and analyses are made
about its ability to withstand a severe earthquake. Such study could
take months, the newspaper said.
   SRP is the only U.S. plant that produces tritium, a radioactive
isotope of hydrogen used to increase the explosive power of nuclear
warheads.
   None of the three reactors at the 300-square-mile facility near
Aiken has produced the critical weapons material since last April
because of scheduled maintenance and safety concerns.
   Last month, Energy Secretary John S. Herrington said continuing
safety questions would delay the restart of SRP until at least next
spring or summer.
   Tritium decays at the rate of 5.5 percent per year and Energy and
Defense Department officials have said that further idling of SRP
could endanger the nation's stockpile.
   Frances Close Hart, chairwoman of the Columbia-based Energy
Research Foundation, said Tuesday she did not believe an
environmental impact statement would push back restart efforts.
   ``Whether or not, if they started with an EIS now, it would delay
their schedule, I doubt very much,'' she said at a news conference
announcing the suit.
   The Energy Research Foundation was joined in the suit by
Greenpeace U.S.A. and Washington-based Natural Resources Defense
Council.
   Named as defendants were Herrington; Ernest E. Baynard III,
assistant energy secretary for environment, safety and health; and
Troy E. Wade II, acting assistant energy secretary for defense
programs.
   DOE spokeswoman Christina Sankey said the department had met over
the past few weeks with representatives of the three environmental
groups regarding an environmental impact statement.
   ``While we did not reach an agreement, the department does intend
to meet all of its obligations under the National Environmental
Policy Act,'' she said.
   Ms. Hart said there were ways to recycle tritium that would
stretch out the current supply. She also said a reduction in U.S.
nuclear weapons would eliminate the urgent demand for tritium.
   ``Anyone who proposes that we face a tritium crisis is either
irresponsible or Dr. Strangelove,'' she said.
   Ms. Hart said an environmental impact statement would aid restart
efforts.
   ``They can do it as quickly as they want to if they devote the
energy,'' Ms. Hart said. ``The reason we want to bring this suit and
have them begin the process is because they're obviously making
decisions now.
   ``They're making decisions every day, they're issuing reports and
the process of planning is moving along. The EIS should be part of
that process. We don't feel they should go any further without
starting this process.''
   The environmental groups are asking for an injunction that would
prohibit the Energy Department from restarting the Savannah plant
unless the agency conducts the environmental impact statement.

<HEAD>Pentagon to Seek Budget Increase of Two Percent For Next Year</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Pentagon is proposing a 2 percent boost in
spending next year, including a pay raise for military personnel,
with no new cuts in forces.
   The spending plan for the 1990 budget year, which begins next
Oct. 1, calls for a 4.1 percent pay raise for the 2.1 million
military personnel and sufficient money to maintain the level of
training approved for the current budget year, Dan Howard, chief
spokesman at the Defense Department, said Tuesday.
   The 1990 budget proposal is to be formally unveiled on Jan. 9. It
will disclose that there has been a one-year slip in production of
the new B-2 stealth bomber ``as a result of both fiscal and
technical considerations,'' Howard said.
   The spokesman declined to elaborate further on the stealth delay,
noting the program is still classified. The Air Force had said
previously it expected delivery of the first operational B-2 in
fiscal 1991.
   Howard's disclosure of fiscal 1990 budget details was unexpected
and unusual. The Defense Department normally declines to discuss any
of the administration's internal budget decisions before the entire
federal budget is submitted to Congress.
   The spokesman's willingness to discuss the matter, however,
appeared to reflect a desire on the part of Defense Secretary Frank
C. Carlucci to pressure Congress _ and for that matter,
President-elect Bush _ to reverse a four-year slide in defense
spending after inflation.
   Bush will be free after his inauguration on Jan. 20 to amend the
budget submissions, and he has indicated he might bow to
congressional calls that military spending be held at current levels
after accounting for inflation.
   Bush said Tuesday he would not make any decisions until he
assumes the presidency.
   Carlucci, in several recent speeches, has argued that zero growth
is unacceptable. Howard echoed that stand Tuesday.
   ``There are those who talk about zero-growth budgets,'' he said.
``We just want to make sure that everybody understands what that
means. If you move in the direction of zero growth, it means that
over (the next five years), you have to take out at least an
additional $100 billion'' because of projected inflation.
   President Reagan's last Pentagon request will total $305.6
billion in multi-year budget authority, up about $15.3 billion from
fiscal 1989, Howard said. That does not include military-related
nuclear programs under the Energy Department.
   The Pentagon increase will include about $1.1 billion for the
military pay raise, about $7 billion to cover inflation and $7.2
billion to provide a ``real growth'' increase of 2 percent, the
spokesman said.
   ``This means that we can sustain the military force that we now
have,'' said Howard.
   Rep. Les Aspin, D-Wis., chairman of the House Armed Services
Committee, said last week, ``I expect the Pentagon to ask for a 2
percent increase, but I think they'll have a hard time getting it.
Their best prospect is for a freeze. There's not much sentiment up
here (Capitol Hill) to increase defense spending.''
   To maintain readiness and avoid further personnel or program
cuts, Carlucci will propose a greatly expanded reliance on
multi-year purchase contracts during the next five years, Howard
said.
   Congress will be asked to commit itself to buy most of the
nation's biggest weapons under long-term contracts, instead of
debating production levels every year.
   Howard said ``there are proposals for multi-year budgeting on 32
programs. If all of this is adopted, it could result in savings of
about $8.5 billion over the terms of these procurements.''

<HEAD>CBS Pulls Mary Tyler Moore and Dick Van Dyke Shows</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JERRY BUCK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Dick Van Dyke and Mary Tyler Moore, who
starred together in one of the 1960's hottest situation comedies,
delivered little more than pratfalls in separate shows this season,
and are no longer on CBS' schedule.
   Van Dyke's new comedy ``The Van Dyke Show'' has been canceled and
Miss Moore's new show ``Annie McGuire'' will leave the air, possibly
only temporarily, CBS announced Tuesday in a major reshuffling of
its troubled prime-time schedule.
   The move eliminates two of the three CBS shows produced by GTG
Entertainment, the company established by former NBC chairman and
MTM Productions head Grant Tinker in partnership with Gannett.
Tinker founded MTM Productions with his then-wife, Miss Moore.
   The network also canceled ``Raising Miranda'' and shelved ``Simon
& Simon,'' its on-again, off-again detetive series, and ``Dirty
Dancing,'' adapted from the hit movie.
   It was the second schedule change this fall by the third-place
network, which earlier put ``Coming of Age'' on indefinite leave and
returned ``Kate & Allie'' to the air.
   The Moore and Van Dyke shows had problems from the start. Both
pilots were reshot and the Moore program was partially recast. They
then emerged to almost universally negative reviews, even though
their stars are two of the most popular sitcom performers ever.
   Van Dyke and Miss Moore co-starred as husband and wife in ``The
Dick Van Dyke Show,'' one of the trend-setting comedies of the
1960s, and Miss Moore starred as Mary Richards in another hit, ``The
Mary Tyler Moore Show,'' in the 1970s.
   But this fall ``Annie McGuire'' and ``The Van Dyke Show'' found
it impossible to make any headway against ABC's ``Growing Pains''
and ``Head of the Class,'' established hits that appeal to young
audiences. They also faced NBC's ``Unsolved Mysteries.''
   In last week's A.C. Nielsen Co. ratings, ``Annie McGuire'' and
``The Van Dyke Show'' had the lowest ratings among the three
networks.
   Similarly, ``Dirty Dancing'' and ``Raising Miranda'' were up
against two NBC comedy hits, ``227'' and ``Amen.'' ``Raising
Miranda'' was the third lowest-rated show last week, Nielsen said
Tuesday.
   ``Simon & Simon,'' which has had spotty showings since 1981, was
unable to challenge NBC's ``Golden Girls'' and ``Empty Nest.''
   CBS, however, held open the possibility that ``Annie McGuire,''
``Simon & Simon'' and ``Dirty Dancing'' could return. The network's
announcement said only that the last broadcast of ``Annie McGuire''
in its Wednesday time slot will be on Dec. 28 and ``Simon & Simon''
will have its final airing on Saturday on Dec. 31. No return dates
were set for either series.
   The network said ``Dirty Dancing'' will go ``on hiatus'' in
January.
   ``The Van Dyke Show,'' starring Van Dyke and his son, Barry, had
its final broadcast Wednesday, Dec. 7, and will not return.
``Raising Miranda'' will have its last showing on Dec. 31.
   In other CBS announcements:
   _``Dolphin Cove,'' a new show starring Frank Converse as an
American dolphin researcher who moves to Australia with his two
young children, will have its debut on Saturday, Jan. 21, in the 8-9
p.m. EST time slot. Among its creators is Peter Benchley, the author
of ``Jaws'' and ``The Deep.
   _``Tour of Duty,'' the Vietnam War drama set in 1968, returns for
its second season on Tuesday, Jan. 3, at 8-9 p.m. EST. To add female
interest to the show, Kim Delaney and Betsy Brantley have been added
to the cast.
   _``The Smothers Brothers'' will be back for four more shows
starting Saturday, Jan. 28, at 9-10 p.m. EST. The comedy-variety
shows starring Tom and Dick Smothers, will have its final telecast
on Feb. 18.
   _``TV 101,'' currently seen on Tuesday, will move to 8-9 p.m. EST
Wednesday on Jan. 4. CBS will rerun its premiere episode on Monday,
Jan. 2, at 8-9 p.m. EST, pre-empting ``Newhart'' and ``Kate &
Allie.''

<HEAD>Law Requiring DC To Change Its Human Rights Code Is Ruled
Unconstitutional</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge has ruled that a law compelling
the District of Columbia to permit religious organizations to
discriminate against homosexuals is unconstitutional.
   U.S. District Judge Royce C. Lamberth said Tuesday the law
violated the free speech rights of D.C. Council members.
   ``We are thrilled and we feel vindicated,'' said Michael
Greenberger, a private attorney who represented the council members.
   The law, known as the Armstrong Amendment for its sponsor, Sen.
William Armstrong, R-Colo., imposed on City Council members
``compelled speech'' that violated their First Amendment rights
under the Constitution, the judge declared.
   Under the provision, ``a majority of plaintiffs would be forced
to vote in favor of adopting the amendment, which presumably
requires a vote of `yea' or `nay.' The court finds that this vote is
of sufficient communicative value as to be protected by the First
Amendment,'' Lamberth said.
   ``Legislators do not generally leave their constitutional rights
at the statehouse gate, and the court does not see why First
Amendment rights should be an exception,'' Lamberth wrote.
   The case appears to be the first time Congress has attempted to
balance gay rights and religious freedom.
   The amendment, which would have forced the city to amend its
human rights code, was tacked onto the city's 1989 budget, along
with several other measures which were opposed by the district
government. Congress had threatened to freeze the city's $3.2
billion budget on Jan. 1 if the council failed to change the law.
   Armstrong had argued that the local law including gay rights
under the human rights code, forced schools such as Georgetown
University to go against its Roman Catholic tenets.
   The council members, acting individually, claimed their oaths of
office required them to uphold the laws of the city and protections
guaranteed by the Constitution. They argued that the congressional
order to weaken the code was unconstitutional.
   The council had been scheduled to modify the human rights code at
its Tuesday night meeting.
   Council Chairman David Clarke said at the Tuesday night meeting:
``We hope the Congress will recognize the dignity of the council as
a legislative body. We want to respect and work with the Congress
but there's a point beyond which we won't go.''
   During a Friday hearing, Assistant U.S. Attorney Curtis Hall said
Congress' ultimate authority over the district government allowed it
to force changes in city law.
   The judge, however, rejected that argument.
   ``That authority is not limitless,'' Lamberth said. ``Congress
may at any time exercise its authority as the legislature, but that
exercise of authority must be constitutional.''
   Armstrong proposed the amendment after a dispute between gay
student groups and Georgetown University. The D.C. Court of Appeals
ruled that Georgetown need not officially recognize the groups, but
must grant them the ``tangible benefits'' of recognition, including
student activity funds.
   The university complied, saying it was satisfied with the ruling.
Officials have said the university intends to follow the local law,
despite Armstrong's efforts.

<TEXT>
   A soldier was arrested Tuesday night in
connection with the fatal shootings of two taxi drivers by a gunman
who then bit a third driver on the hand and face during a robbery
attempt, authorities said.
   The suspect is stationed at nearby Fort Hood, said fort spokesman
Tommy Tucker, who would not release the suspect's name or give other
details.
   In this central Texas Army town, one of the Yellow Cab drivers
died after being shot in the head and another was unsuccessfully
shot at, then bitten on the hand and forehead; the third was shot to
death at Fort Hood, police said.
   Before the arrest, Becky Carroll, legal adviser for the Police
Department, said the nature of the robberies and shootings, which
spanned roughly six hours beginning about 8 p.m. Monday, led police
to believe the attacks were the work of one person.
   ``It seems they (the shootings) were connected but we can't say
for sure if they were,'' said Doris Mashburn, wife of cab company
owner Bob Mashburn.
   ``We're grieved and we're in shock ourselves but it's business as
usual,'' said Bob Mashburn, who has owned the Yellow Cab Co. here
for 18 years and who bought the town's other taxi company, Kelly
Cab, five years ago. There have been no other fatal attacks on
drivers, he said, but last year, a Yellow Cab driver was wounded by
a knife during an attack.
   Killeen, with a population of 46,300 people, is dominated by Fort
Hood, an Army base. About 39,000 soldiers are stationed there.
   The Mashburns identified the dead men as Christopher Fay, 20, a
soldier and part-time cab driver, and Bobby Sharbino, 44.
   Howard Harrison, 28, was treated for minor wounds caused when the
robber bit him, the Police Department report of the incidents said.
   Mashburn said he spoke with Harrison, but the cab driver ``was
incoherent when I talked to him.''
   Harrison told police the assailant was black, was 5 feet 8 or 9
inches tall, weighed 180 pounds and had short hair.
   In the first attack, the robber called a cab and asked to be
taken from Killeen to the Army post sometime between 8 p.m. and 9
p.m. Monday, investigators said. Inside the post, the gunman robbed
driver Fay of an undetermined amount and shot him to death, the
police report said. There is no checkpoint at the base.
   A man then called a Yellow Cab to take him from Fort Hood to
Killeen. He robbed the driver and shot him to death on a street in
the central Texas town. Sharbino's body was found in the cab about
12:30 a.m. Tuesday after police received a call that the cab had
been parked in one spot for several hours.
   A short time later, Harrison told police, a man attempted to rob
him and shot at him on a Killeen street.
   Harrison grabbed the gunman's hand, forcing the bullet to miss
him, said a Yellow Cab dispatcher in Killeen who would not identify
himself. The gunman then bit the driver on the hand and forehead,
the police report said.
   Harrison was treated at a hospital and released, said James
Kelly, an investigator with the Killeen Police Department.
   Authorities say they do not know how much money was taken in the
robberies. Military officers are investigating the first attack at
the base, while police are investigating all three incidents.

<HEAD>Tributes Pour In After Death Of Longtime Alabama Congressman</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID PACE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Tributes from members of Congress and the
Reagan administration are pouring in for Rep. Bill Nichols of
Alabama, who died suddenly at the age of 70.
   ``Bill Nichols was a patriot,'' Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole,
R-Kan., said Tuesday after learning of Nichols' death. ``He gave
selflessly and generously to his country, in times of war and peace.
It was an honor to have known him.''
   Nichols, a Democrat, had served in Congress for 22 years. He died
at Capitol Hill Hospital Tuesday morning.
   Press secretary Tom McMahon said the congressman suffered a heart
attack and collapsed in his House office shortly after arriving for
work at 7 a.m. He was rushed to the hospital, about 12 blocks away,
but was pronounced dead at 8:16 a.m.
   Rep. Sonny Alabama Callahan, R-Ala., said he was shocked by
Nichols' death.
   ``I think his entire history was dedicated to serving America,''
Callahan said.
   Defense Secretary Frank C. Carlucci said Nichols ``was a true
friend of the military and a respected member of the House Armed
Services Committee for many years. We will miss his support, his
leadership and his friendship.''
   Nichols' body was flown from Andrews Air Force Base to
Birmingham, Ala., Tuesday night. Funeral services will be held
Thursday at the First United Methodist Church in Sylacauga, Ala. The
Rev. J. Charles Boling, Nichols' minister and lifelong friend, will
officiate.
   Nichols is survived by his wife, the former Carolyn Funderburk;
two daughters, Margaret Vlachou of Athens, Greece, and Memorie
Mitchell of Birmingham, Ala., a son, Flynt Nichols of Dallas; and
three grandchildren.
   Nichols, who lost a leg in World War II, used his reputation as a
strong Pentagon supporter to become one of the most effective
leaders in the effort to reform the nation's military establishment.
   As chairman of the House armed services investigations
subcommittee, he joined with then Sen. Barry Goldwater, R-Ariz., in
1986 to author the ``Goldwater-Nichols Defense Reorganization Act,''
which provided for the most far-reaching overhaul of the upper
echelons of the military services in four decades.
   Nichols was born on a farm near Becker, Miss., but grew up in
Sylacauga. He earned an undergraduate degree in agriculture from
Auburn University in 1939 and a master's degree in 1941. He was
captain of the school's football team.
   During World War II, Nichols was injured in a land mine explosion
while fighting with the Army in Europe in 1944. He underwent 19
operations and eventually lost his left leg from the knee down. He
was awarded the Bronze Star and Purple Heart.
   After the war, Nichols returned to Sylacauga and served as
president of Parker Fertilizer Co. and Parker Gin Co. He entered
politics in 1959, winning election to the Alabama House.
   He was elected to the Alabama Senate in 1963, and served as the
floor leader for former Gov. George C. Wallace before his election
to Congress in 1966.

   Defense Secretary Frank C. Carlucci has sided

that 3,000 jobs be eliminated in the next three years at U.S.
military headquarters around the world.
   The Joint Chiefs of Staff had argued any reductions should be
limited to no more than 500 positions.
   But a statement from the Pentagon said Carlucci's decision to
follow with the recommendations of civilian manpower officials ``is
final.''
   ``The secretary of defense has adopted all of the recommendations
that he felt could be accomplished without hurting military
readiness,'' the Pentagon said in response to a query.

   Scientists from five nations are launching an
intensive effort to find out why the Earth's protective ozone layer
is thinning more than expected in the Northern regions of the globe.
   The $10 million, six-week research effort starting Jan. 1 will be
based in Stavanger, Norway, and involve scientists from the United
States, the United Kingdom, Norway, West Germany and Denmark.
   Satellite data show an ozone decline of between 2.5 percent and
6.5 percent in the northernmost areas. Scientific theory had
expected a drop of only about 1.5 percent, Dr. Dan Albritton of the
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said Tuesday.
   While the so-called ozone hole over the South Pole has attracted
the most media attention, Albritton said the northern depletion
could have a greater effect because more people live in the North.

   The late Gwendolyn Cafritz, philanthropist and
famed Washington socialite, has asked in her will that her landmark
home become the secretary of state's official residence, according
to a report published today.
   The Washington Post reported in today's editions the request was
confirmed by former Secretary of State William Rogers, an executor
of Mrs. Cafritz's will, and by Martin Atlas, executive vice
president of the Morris and Gwendolyn D. Cafritz Foundation.
   Mrs. Cafritz died Nov. 29 at age 78, and her husband died in 1964.
   The Post reported that Mrs. Cafritz left her 14,608-square-foot
1938 Art Moderne house and its property to the Cafritz Foundation,
which is charged with carrying out her wishes.
   A December 1987 appropriations bill for the State Department
prohibits it from acquiring an official residence for the secretary
of state.

   A man who was burned and scarred
when a bartender made a flaming drink that went out of control has
been awarded $1.25 million.
   Charles McCarthy, who has not worked for nearly three years,
cried when the jury's decision was announced Monday in Circuit Court.
   ``It was a horrible, unfortunate accident,'' said McCarthy's
attorney, Robert L. Spector. ``After the verdict came in, I saw him
crying in the hallway with his father.''
   McCarthy, a former roofer with a wife and two children, was
burned from the waist up after the February 1986 accident at Danny's
bar in Fort Lauderdale.
   The bartender was making a Russian Roulette, made of vodka,
Galliano, lemon, sugar and 151-proof rum, which was to be served
flaming.
   The flame from the drink glass ignited the rum bottle and sent
flames shooting at McCarthy, Spector said. McCarthy was burned on 30
percent of his body, scarring his hands, arms, chest and face,
Spector said.
   He can no longer work outdoors and suffers from psychological
problems, the attorney said.
   Jack Klingensmith, the attorney who represented Danny's, argued
that McCarthy could work.
   ``He can walk, talk, use his arms, hear and see. He has no brain
damage. I think that ought to be about everything you need to hold a
job,'' Klingensmith said.
   McCarthy, 38, had received an additional $250,000 in an
out-of-court settlement from the Seagram Co. Ltd.

<HEAD>Article Calling Chinese Lazy Causes Furor In Press</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN POMFRET</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An article accusing Chinese of being lazy is
causing a furor in the state-run press, sparking one paper to launch
its own attack on the work habits of one-quarter of mankind.
   ``Our offices have turned into free tea houses for tea tasting,
newspaper reading and gossip,'' went the editorial in the Worker's
Daily on Tuesday. ``Our workshops have become clubs for poker,
chess, reading and sweater knitting.''
   Another paper, Economic Information, has twice in the last week
printed batches of readers' letters about the article.
   ``Our system needs radical surgery if we are going to eradicate
this old disorder and dispose of this chronic disease,'' wrote one
reader.
   ``We must sweep away the old system that encourages this laziness
and push reform to its limits,'' wrote another.
   The article that started the ruckus was first published in
September in a Singapore newspaper and has since appeared in several
Chinese publications.
   It tells the story that in some Japanese companies, bosses warn
workers exhibiting slothful tendenices: ``Do not study the Chinese.''
   ``We have no choice but to admit,'' the article says, ``that
Chinese are the lazy bones of East Asia.''
   Chinese store attendants ignore customers, its workers read kung
fu novels on the job and its public officials spend the whole day
``blowing the ox,'' a Chinese expression for chatting, the article
says.
   ``To cure laziness,'' it says, ``we must push reform.''
   China is in the midst of reforms that aim to enliven its
once-stagnant, state-run economy and make it more responsive to the
market.
   One of the biggest problems the country faces in raising
productivity is that its workers have become accustomed to the
``iron rice bowl,'' the decades-old system of lifetime employment.
   Under that system, workers are paid the same no matter how hard
they labor and individual enterprise is looked upon as rocking the
boat. In addition, most college graduates are assigned jobs, sapping
their enthusiasm for work.
   Today, many Chinese complain that the country's biggest problem
is not its population of more than 1 billion but the fact that
talent and hard work are not rewarded by society or the state.
   ``It happens in almost every work unit,'' said the Worker's Daily
editorial. ``The young worker starts working actively but bit by bit
he learns to work like everybody else.''
   The government says it wants to solve this problem and has taken
halting steps to smash the ``iron rice bowl'' and allow more Chinese
to choose their own jobs. Workers also are regularly urged to
increase their productivity.
   But it remains to be seen how much government efforts will change
the state of labor if they are not accompanied by a fundamental
change in the way society views hard work.
   In its editorial, the Worker's Daily hinted at the necessity for
such a change although it did not say how such a change could be
effected.
   ``Our fundamental problem is that this society lacks a mechanism
to encourage people to succeed,'' it said. ``Chinese are not
inherently lazy ... but the environment has made them lazy.''
   Chinese people have for years thought of themselves as ``diligent
and brave,'' the paper said, but those adjectives no longer apply.
   ``Only when we build a mechanism that will encourage ... the
people to reach for their goals,'' the editorial said, ``will we
again be worthy of calling ourselves diligent and brave.''
   And then maybe, it said, ``Japanese bosses might even tell their
lazy workers, `You should study the Chinese.'''

   An undercover police officer and a suspected drug
dealer were shot to death late Tuesday in a parking lot and two
other suspects were wounded in a drug-deal-turned-gunfight,
authorities said.
   The officer, the fifth Dallas police officer slain this year, was
pronounced dead at Baylor University Medical Center about 10:30
p.m., 30 minutes after the shootout, said police Sgt. Jim Chandler.
   Two of the city's five officers killed this year were
moonlighting on security jobs. The others died in the line of duty.
   A 34-year-old man with chest and back wounds died at Parkland
Memorial Hospital, where two other suspects were taken, said
emergency room supervisor Randy Blanchard.
   A 17-year-old male suspect was in critical condition in surgery
with wounds to the chest and abdomen, Blanchard said. A 19-year-old
man with wounds to both lower legs was listed in serious condition.
   ``It is my understanding that it was a buy-bust situation _ a
drug buy _ and we had more than one officer at the scene,'' Police
Chief Mack Vines said outside Baylor hospital. ``Instead of the drug
deal reaching fruition, they were hijacked, as they say, shots were
exchanged and our officer was fatally wounded.''
   The officer was shot several times.
   Police spokesman Hollis Edwards said officers searched for at
least one other suspect.
   Vines said details were sketchy, but the undercover officers were
believed to be making a cocaine deal at the time of the shooting. No
other officers were hurt.
   Police Detective B.J. Watkins said officers were questioning
witnesses at the scene, a convenience store parking lot near
downtown. Nearly 100 people gathered there after the shooting.
   One witness said he believed the officer, whose name was
withheld, was shot in the head.
   ``These three people were just lying on the ground. The officer
was face-up on the ground. They were all screaming and then other
officers showed up and pointed guns,'' said Rusty Ross, 21, of
Dallas.
   Ali Dahii, another witness, said he heard up to 11 shots as he
used a pay telephone near the convenience store.
   Juan Kwak, owner of a food store across the street from the
convenience store, said he heard the shots and then ran to door of
his store to see the gunfight.
   ``Right up until that time, they fight each other with big guns
right out on the street,'' said Kwak, 57. ``When I looked over on
the street, people were running into each other and they were
shooting at each other.''

   Prince William, Britain's 6-year-old future king,
demonstrated a regal calm as he starred in his school's Christmas
carol concert.
   Without a trace of nervousness, the fair-haired son of Prince
Charles and Princess Diana sang ``Silent Night'' with two of his
schoolmates Tuesday. He and the class sang more than a dozen other
carols.
   William's parents and his 4-year-old brother, Harry, were in the
audience of 650 parents, families and friends at London's Palace
Theater, and joined in tumultuous applause at the end of the
concert. William started at Wetherby School in west London in
January 1987.
   The performance marked a contrast to his first stage appearance,
in 1986, when the little prince broke down in tears after spotting
his parents in the audience as he played the part of a wolf at his
nursery school.

   Former Apollo 8 astronauts Frank Borman and James
Lovell proudly observed the 20th anniversary of a voyage that Santa
Claus might have envied: the Christmas space flight that preceded
man's first steps on the moon.
   Apollo 8 is perhaps best remembered for the international
broadcast of the astronauts reading passages from the book of
Genesis on Christmas Eve 1968, with a stunning view of the Earth.
   ``Up to that point it was the largest audience that had ever
listened to a human voice,'' Lovell, who served as command module
pilot on the mission, recalled Tuesday.
   ``You have to remember the time span of when Apollo 8 went up,
which was the end of 1968 ... not a very stellar year here in this
country,'' Lovell, 60, recalled at the Museum of Science and
Industry. The spacecraft's command module is on loan there from the
National Air and Space Museum in Washington.
   ``Bobby Kennedy was assassinated, Martin Luther King ... the
Vietnam War was going on, the Democratic convention in Chicago ...
we had all sorts of riots,'' Lovell said. ``It was some sort of
project or an achievement that everybody could look up to.''
   Borman, 60, agreed, saying the flight that preceded the Apollo 11
moon landing in 1969 ``will always be the single-most highlight of
my professional life.''

   Rock superstar Tom Petty confesses he
felt like just another weak-kneed fan when he met music legend Roy
Orbison a year ago.
   ``I was always a tremendous fan of his,'' Petty said of Orbison,
who died of a heart attack at age 52 last week in Hendersonville.
``You're always nervous when you meet someone like that.''
   The singer and guitarist, known for songs such as ``Refugee'' and
``Don't Come Around Here No More,'' was among those who attended a
memorial gathering Tuesday night in Los Angeles planned by Orbison's
widow, Barbara.
   Petty and Orbison, with Bob Dylan, ex-Beatle George Harrison and
Electric Light Orchestra alumni Jeff Lynne, made up the Traveling
Wilburys, whose album of the same name was in the top 10 when
Orbison died.
   ``It was just a thrill. We were all in awe of Roy, and we told
him so every 10 minutes,'' Petty said. ``That's the one thing I feel
great about, that we loved him and hugged him all the time.''

Christmas party for the children of the diplomatic corps.
   The first lady, clad in a signature red dress, sat among the
squirming and giggling crowd of some 370 children on Tuesday and
watched as dancers, dressed as the California Raisins with red
noses, cavorted to and fro to the tunes of Christmas carols set to
Motown rhythm.
   ``We'll be thinking of you ... we'll both be thinking of you, and

   Debra Murphree, the tattooed prostitute who
said she posed nude for evangelist Jimmy Swaggart, was married in
jail to a man she met there before her recent release.
   Weaing a conservative white dress, the 28-year-old Murphree
became the bride of Samuel W. Travis, 32, of Metairie, in a ceremony
Tuesday in the Jefferson Parish jail in suburban New Orleans.
   ``Well, I'm happy, you know. I'm very much in love, and this is
what I wanted,'' Murphree told reporters after the wedding behind
bars.
   Travis is serving time for a 1986 conviction for cruelty to a
juvenile and is scheduled to be released in October.
   Murphree was released from the jail Nov. 16 after serving three
months on a prostitution charge unrelated to the Swaggart scandal.
The mother of three said she and her husband plan to start a new
life in her home state of Indiana.

   A federal appeals court ruled in favor of
actress Jane Fonda in a lawsuit by her former business manager, who
said he was entitled to 10 percent of her earnings from the movie
``Coming Home'' and other projects.
   Miss Fonda denied she had agreed orally to continue to pay
proceeds to Richard M. Rosenthal after firing him in May 1980.
   On Tuesday, the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled 3-0 that
an agreement, if it existed, was unenforceable because it wasn't in
writing.
   Lawrence Steinberg, a lawyer for Rosenthal, said the ruling lets
Miss Fonda ``subvert the claims of someone who worked for her as a
loyal confidant for 12 years.''
   Among other things, Steinberg said, Rosenthal made the
contractual arrangements for ``Coming Home,'' the 1978 film that won
Miss Fonda her second Academy Award as best actress.

   The ``Cheapskate Breakfast Couples''
will have to come up with a new name after deciding to buy a lottery
ticket over a 99-cent breakfast special that won a $28.6 million
jackpot.
   The five retired Delray Beach couples, who have met on a weekly
basis for the past six years, range from age 68 to 77. Two of the
couples are nearing their 50th wedding aniversary.
   Although they had purchased lottery tickets individually before,
they decided Friday to buy 11 tickets together when one of them
complained that he needed money to have a tooth fixed.
   The winners of Saturday's jackpot are: Carl and Mary Anderson;
Actavio and Josephine Caruso; Edward and Augustine Fiume; Luke and
Marion Lomartire, and James and Artea Molinari.
   The group said the $1,433,000 initial payment to be made Dec. 21
would be equally distributed by an attorney who is handling a trust
fund for the group.
   Each couple will receive approximately $230,000 a year, for 20
years, after taxes.
   The winners said they had no immediate plans for spending the
money, but hoped to take a cruise together.
   ``At this stage of the game, what ... more can we ask,'' said Ed
Fiume.

   Businesses are increasingly setting up shop
in funeral parlors in an undertaking that gives new life to the
structures.
   Attorney Don Harmening, who has an office on the first floor of a
19th-century home that for 54 years was the Boland Mortuary, said
it's ``more relaxing for me and my clients.''
   He and others are moving into majestic Peoria homes that were
funeral parlors in the early 1900s in former residential
neighborhoods that have since been swallowed by the expanding
downtown business district.
   The large, 1870-era structure that includes Harmening's office
easily accommodates several businesses, including an insurance
company and a secretarial service.
   Harmening has 14-foot ceilings, a marble-topped fireplace and
carved mahogany around him. He said it's much easier to relax there
than in the space he rented in a modern office tower.
   ``I got a lot more room for the money,'' the attorney said.
   ``The spaciousness and graciousness of this environment is just
right for inspiring the kind of work we do,'' said Marjorie Klise,
president of a video business that operates out of another one-time
funeral parlor.
   A couple blocks away is the former Wright & Salmon Mortuary,
which now houses the Peoria Community Correctional Center, including
a barracks-like dormitory and recreation room.

   It took 29 hours, 47 minutes and 12 seconds, but
when it was over, three subway buffs claimed to have passed through
more stations in a single trip than anyone else in transit history.
   They emerged from the underground Tuesday with tales of a sunrise
over Queens, pastry under Columbus Circle and a squalid ladies' room
in Coney Island.
   ``We're here, grubby but triumphant,'' said Richard Temple, trip
leader. ``And all on one token. We never left the system!''
   Because of subway delays, the three friends _ Temple, 28, Phil
Vanner, 25, and Tom Murphy, 29 _ finished almost three hours behind
schedule.
   Seizing an opportunity brought by the opening of three new subway
stations _ the first in 20 years _ the trio claimed to be the first
people to ride through every station of the newly enlarged system.
   With 466 stations and 232 miles of track, New York City's subway
system is easily the nation's largest. The 1988 Guinness Book of
World Records lists it as the subway system with the most stations.
   After the expedition ended, reporters asked the obvious question:
``Why?''
   ``Because it's there,'' Temple responded ``It's something I've
always wanted to do, being something of a subway junkie.''
   The trio said the low point of their trip came Monday night on
the trip to Coney Island, a one-hour, 45-minute ordeal on an
unheated train that often slowed to a crawl behind a trash
collection train.
   ``We were tired and frustrated,'' said Vanner. ``We were
questioning our sanity.''

   Excerpts from the speech by Palestine Liberation
Organization chairman Yasser Arafat to the U.N. General Assembly on
Tuesday. He spoke in Arabic, and the English-language text was
provided by the PLO:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   I am both proud and happy to meet with you today, here in Geneva,
after an arbitrary American decision barred me from going to you
there.
   I extend deep gratitude to all nations, forces and international
organizations and personalities who backed our people and supported
its national rights .... I also thank the Western European nations
and Japan for their latest stands toward our people and I invite
them to take further steps to positively evolve their resolutions in
order to open the way for peace and a just settlement in our region,
the Middle East.
   We set out in the Palestine Liberation Organization to look for
realistic and attainable formulas that would settle the issue on the
basis of possible rather than absolute justice while securing the
rights of our people to freedom, sovereignty and independence;
ensuring for everyone peace, security and stability; and sparing
Palestine and the Middle East wars and battles that have been going
on for 40 years.
   Israel's response to all this has been the escalation of its
settlement and annexation schemes; the fanning of the flames of
conflict with more destruction, devastation and bloodshed; and the
expansion of the confrontation fronts to include brotherly Lebanon,
which was invaded by the ocupation troops in 1982, an invasion
punctuated with slaughters and massacres perpetrated against the
Lebanese and Palestinian peoples, including the Sabra and Chatilla
massacres.
   It is painful and regrettable that the American government alone
should continue to back these aggressive and expansionist schemes as
well as Israel's continued occupation of Palestinian and Arab
territories, its crimes, and its iron-fist policy against our
children and women.
   It is painful and regrettable too that the American government
should continue refusing to recognize the right of 6 million
Palestinians to self-determination, a right which is sacred to the
American people and other peoples on this planet.
   Our people does not want a right which is not its own or which
has not been vested in it by international legitimacy and
international law. It does not seek its freedom at the expense of
anyone else's freedom, nor does it want a destiny which negates the
destiny of another people. Our people refuses to be better or worse
than any other people. Our people wants to be the equal of all other
peoples, with the same rights and obligations.
   While we greatly appreciate the free American voices that have
explained and supported our position and resolutions, we note that
the U.S. administration remains uncommitted to even-handedness in
its dealings with the parties to the conflict. It continues to
demand from us alone the acceptance of position which cannot be
determined prior to negotiations and dialogue within the framework
of the international conference.
   It (the Palestine National Council) has also reaffirmed its
rejection of terrorism in all its forms, including state terrorism,
emphasizing its commitment to its past resolutions in this regard,
and to the resolution of the Arab summit in Algiers in 1988, and to
U.N. Resolutions 42-159 of 1987 and 61-40 of 1985, and to what was
stated on this subject in the Cairo Declaration of 7 November 1985.
   This position, Mr. President, is clear and free of all ambiguity.
And yet, I, as chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organization,
hereby once more declare that I condemn terrorism in all its forms,
and at the same time salute those sitting before me in this hall
who, in the days when they fought to free their countries from the
yoke of colonialism, were accused of terrorism by their oppressors,
and who today are the faithful leaders of their peoples, stalwart
champions of the values of justice and freedom.
   The United Nations bears a historic, extraordinary responsibility
toward our people and their rights. More than 40 years ago, the
United Nations, in its Resolution 181, decided on the establishment
of two states in Palestine, one Palestinian Arab and the other
Jewish. Despite the historic wrong that was done to our people, it
is our view today that the said resolution continues to meet the
requirements of international legitimacy which guarantee the
Palestinian Arab people's right to sovereignty and national
independence.
   In my capacity as chairman of the PLO executive committee,
presently assuming the functions of the provisional government of
the state of Palestine, I therefore present the following
Palestinian peace initiative:
   First: That a serious effort be made to convene, under the
supervision of the secretary-general of the United Nations, the
preparatory committee of the international conference for peace in
the Middle East _ in accordance with the initiative of President
Gorbachev and President Mitterrand, which President Mitterrand
presented to your Assembly toward the end of last September and
which was supported by many states _ to pave the way for the
convening of the international conference, which commands universal
support except from the government of Israel.
   Second: In view of our belief in international legitimacy and the
vital role of the United Nations, that actions be undertaken to
place our occupied Palestinian land under temporary United Nations
supervision, and that international forces be deployed there to
protect our people and, at the same time, to supervise the
withdrawal of the Israeli forces from our country.
   Third: The PLO will seek a comprehensive settlement among the
parties concerned in the Arab-Israeli conflict, including the state
of Palestine, Israel and other neighbors, within the framework of
the international conference for peace in the Middle East on the
basis of Resolutions 242 and 338 and so as to guarantee equality and
the balance of interests, especially our people's rights in freedom,
national independence, and respect the right to exist in peace and
security for all.
   If these principles are endorsed at the international conference,
we will have come a long way toward a just settlement, and this will
enable us to reach agreement on all security and peace arrangements.
   I come to you in the name of my people, offering my hand so that
we can make true peace, peace based on justice.
   I ask the leaders of Israel to come here under the sponsorship of
the United Nations, so that, together, we can forge that peace.
   And here, I would address myself specifically to the Israeli
people in all their parties and forces, and especially to the
advocates of democracy and peace among them. I say to them: Come let
us make peace. Cast away fear and intimidation. Leave behind the
specter of the wars that have raged continuously for the past 40
years.

   Following are highlights of the speech by Palestine
Liberation Organization Chairman Yasser Arafat on Tuesday before the
special session of the United Nations General Assembly:
   _He presented a three-stage ``Palestinian peace initiative''
including: 1 _ a proposal to set up a committee to prepare an
international Middle East peace conference; 2 _ temporary U.N.
supervision of ``occupied Palestinian land'' by the United Nations,
deployment of a U.N. peacekeeping force, and withdrawal of Israeli
troops, and 3 _ a ``comprehensive settlement ... (within the
framework of the peace conference) among all parties concerned in
the Arab-Israeli conflict, including the State of Palestine, Israel
and other neighbors'' on the basis of U.N. resolutions 242 and 338.
   _He denounced Israel's ``inhuman practices'' but called on the
leaders of the Jewish state to join the international conference
``here so that together we can forge that peace'' in the Middle East.
   _He ruled out any further commitments at this stage by the PLO in
addition to last month's Algiers declaration by the PLO's National
Council, which implicitly recognized the existence of Israel. He
said Washington demanded from the PLO acceptance of positions
``which cannot be determined'' before the peace conference.
   _He reiterated the PLO's ``rejection of terrorism in all its
forms, including state terrorism.''

   Security Council Resolution 242, adopted Nov. 22, 1967, mainly
calls for withdrawal of Israeli armed forces from captured
territories and the end of all hostilities in the Middle East, with
all states recognizing the rights of the others to ``live in peace
within secure and recognized boundaries free from threats or acts of
force.''
   Security Council Resolution 338, passed Oct. 22, 1973, during the
Arab-Israeli war, calls for an end to the fighting; calls on all
parties to begin implementing Resolution 242; and most importantly,
calls for negotiations between the parties for ``a just and durable
peace in the Middle East.''

   The dollar closed slightly higher against the
Japanese yen Wednesday, while share prices rebounded on the Tokyo
Stock Exchange.
   The dollar closed at 123.35 yen, up 0.29 yen from Tuesday's close
of 123.06 yen. After opening at 123.35 yen, it ranged between 123.25
and 123.45 yen.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues, which lost 74.48
points on Tuesday, recouped 156.92 points, or 0.53 percent,
finishing at 29,754.73.
   Analysts said the Tokyo market rose because of optimism in
overseas markets that U.S. trade figures for October will show an
improvement. The Commerce Department is scheduled to release the
figures later Wednesday.
   In the foreign-exchange market, dealers said the dollar came
under modest downward pressure following speculative profit-taking.
   Currency dealers noted that Tokyo trading was slow ahead of the
U.S. trade figures. They said the market expects the report to show
an October trade deficit of $10 billion to $11 billion, close to the
$10.46 billion shortfall posted in September.

   From his wheelchair, John Moran is
reaching around the globe to help victims of the Armenian earthquake.
   Moran, a disabled Vietnam veteran, is one of few dozen ham radio
operators across the United States who are relaying information
between survivors in the Soviet Union and worried American relatives.
   With telephone lines either down or jammed with calls, ham radio
has become the fastest and most reliable way to reach people in the
cities of Leninakan, Spitak and Kirovakan, where a Dec. 7 earthquake
killed at least 55,000 people and injured 13,000.
   ``Right now, ham radio is the only way to actually make contact
with the stricken areas and have someone find out for you whether
your relatives are OK,'' said Dikran M. Kaligian, executive director
of the Armenian National Committee, based in the Boston suburb of
Watertown.
   Fueled by strong coffee and unfiltered cigarettes, the
53-year-old Moran is spending 20-hour days in his wheelchair at a
desk piled 3 feet high with electronic equipment.
   Though a paraplegic, he has full use of his arms and seems to be
in constant motion _ twirling dials, pecking at a computer keyboard,
answering the telephone and speaking into his prized, vintage-1953
microphone with the calm, authoritative voice of a former Air Force
officer.
   Since Friday, Moran has left his post for only three to four
hours of sleep a night.
   ``I've got about two more days before I crash,'' he said Tuesday
afternoon. ``Then somebody else will have to take over.''
   From a 70-foot antenna atop his house in this working-class
community north of Boston, Moran beams a high-frequency, 1,000-watt
signal to the Soviet Union and completes a chain of technology and
sympathy that stretches a third of the way around the globe.
   At one end of the chain are Armenian-American families who have
given the names and addresses of hundreds of relatives to the
Armenian Relief Society of North America, a 78-year-old organization
also based in Watertown.
   The society has passed the names on to the ham operators, who are
contacting colleagues throughout the Soviet Union in search of
information.
   For most of the past week, for example, Moran has been in nearly
constant contact with Viktor Goncharsky, a ham operator in the
Ukrainian City of Lvov who speaks English well and has a powerful
transmitter.
   Goncharsky, in turn, has been in touch with ham operators in
Armenia. And they have been gathering information in person, by
telephone or with hand-held radios used by rescue workers.
   So far, the news received here has mostly been good.
   ``It was a great relief,'' said John Gulbankian, 21, of
Southboro, who learned Sunday via the ham network that his
23-year-old sister, Carolyn, was unharmed. ``She sent us a telegram
to say she was OK, but we didn't get it for two days and we were
really worried.''
   While no deaths have yet been reported through the network, ``it
probably will not be long before we come to that,'' said John
Megerdichian, of the relief society.
   ``It's going to be a sad situation, but I think we're going to
have to tell (the relatives) either way, good news or bad.''
   Moran is no stranger to disaster relief efforts. In more than 30
years as a ham operator, he said, he has participated in several
similar efforts, including last summer's Jamaican hurricane and the
1985 Mexico City earthquake.
   Since a spinal injury from mortar fire in Vietnam gradually
worsened and left him in a wheelchair in 1977, he said, he has spent
most of his time either fighting for the rights of the handicapped
or talking on the radio frequencies set aside by the Federal
Communications Commission for amateur _ or ham _ operators.
   ``I personally never realized it until I got on the boat myself,
but there are a lot of people out there who are isolated at home,
and ham radio gives them a way to reach out to people around the
world,'' he said. ``A disaster like this is sad, but it gives you
the chance to show that Americans care.''

<TEXT>
   Maine's largest city beat its namesake in
Oregon in a fund-raising contest and snagged the prize of 100 pounds
of salmon.
   The United Way of Greater Portland and the Oregan United Way
sought to see which agency could increase its fund-raising this year
over 1987. At stake were 100 pounds of Maine lobsters and 100 pounds
of salmon.
   The Oregon agency raised $19.3 million, or 7.5 percent more than
last year. But that fell short of the Maine agency's total, which,
at $5.4 million, was 12 percent more than in 1987.
   The victory gave Mayor Cheryl A. Leeman bragging rights. The
contest, she said, proved once and for all that ``Portland, Maine,
was established first, has the best weather, the best scenery, the
best fishing, the best economy, the best businesses and the best
United Way volunteers.''
   A suggestion that the losing Portland would have to give up its
name prompted a denial from Robert E. Martin of the Oregon United

   ``That was just something that some reporters out here thought
up,'' said Martin, who moved from Portland, Maine, to Oregon three
years ago and extended the challenge last summer.

   Residents are tying white ribbons
around town to solemnly remember a tornado that killed six people a
year ago today and caused $35 million in damage but strengthened the
community's ties to each other.
   ``I think the greatest thing that has arisen from the tornado is
something that can't be measured,'' said Mayor Keith M. Ingram.
``The attitude and spirit of this community now is one that believes
in itself. It believes it can overcome anything that is put in its
path.''
   Barbara Smith's two-bedroom frame house was lifted from its
foundation just before the tornado touched down around 10 p.m. The
tornado destroyed 146 homes and 30 businesses, and damaged or
destroyed 200 apartments along a three-mile path. More than 200
people were injured.
   ``I heard the Lord's voice that night and he told me we would be
OK,'' said Mrs. Smith. ``And sure enough, we have come back. We made
it through.''
   The estimated $35 million in damage was exacerbated two weeks
later by heavy rains that flooded parts of West Memphis, which is
across the Mississippi River about 10 miles west of Memphis, Tenn.
And just after New Year's, the town was covered with a foot of snow.
   Residents in the city of 28,000 are recalling the death and
destruction this week by adorning trees and mailboxes with white
ribbon, some of it provided by the mayor's office.
   Mrs. Smith, 26, said the storm has left a deeper mark.
   ``We pulled together,'' she said Monday. ``We all helped each
other. We found love for our neighbors.''
   One of her neighbors, Diane Johnson relaxed this week with her
two young children in a remodeled living room. Before the storm, it
was a bedroom.
   ``That night, I grabbed my child's mattress and put it over us in
the hall. I still know right where that mattress is. A big tree fell
right on the bed where we had been sleeping,'' Mrs. Johnson said.
``Thank God we moved quickly.''
   The year of rebuilding has kept a 10-member city design and
review commission busy, Ingram said. The panel was established a few
months before the storm to devise long-term plans for uniformity of
new buildings.
   ``The idea was that it would be a very slow, evolutionary pace,''
he said. ``Needless to say, when the tornado came through, it
accelerated that evolution.''

   Authorities say they are investigating
reports a fire in a state prison that killed 20 inmates in an
overcrowded dormitory was sparked by paint thinner thrown during a
fight.
   Six prisoners were injured, three seriously, in the blaze Tuesday
at the Nuevo Leon state penitentiary in Monterrey, the state capital
and a northeastern industrial city of nearly 2 million residents.
   Raul Garza, state communications director, said a preliminary
investigation indicated the fire was an accident.
   Garza said it appeared a lighted candle ignited a curtain around
an altar to the Virgin of Guadalupe, patron saint of this
predominantly Roman Catholic nation. The blaze spread, he said.
   But authorities were looking into reports a prisoner threw paint
thinner during a fight inside the ward and another inmate ignited
the thinner to start the fire, Garza said.
   ``There were an extraordinary amount of candles in the ward
because we just celebrated the Virgin of Guadalupe festival,'' he
said.
   Prisoners were allowed to set up small altars near their beds on
the annual holiday, celebrated Monday, he said.
   Garza said 116 prisoners were housed in the ward, designed for 70
inmates, when the fire broke out at 3:00 a.m. Tuesday.
   ``The mattresses also caught fire and there was a lot of smoke.
The mattresses were made of a material that doesn't burn easily, but
unfortunately it creates a lot of toxic smoke,'' Garza said.
   ``Some of the prisoners lost consciousness and were consumed by
flames,'' he said.
   Alma Payton, prison personnel director, said in an interview that
it was ``unavoidable'' that prisoners smuggled paint thinner and
glue into the wards to use as inhalants.
   But, she said, ``The official version is that it was an accident
unless the investigators tell us differently.''
   Ms. Payton said 2,156 inmates were housed in the one-story
prison, which originally was designed for 800.
   Garza said a new penitentiary under construction is scheduled to
be completed by April.
   At least 60 soldiers and state police patrolled outside the
prison Tuesday night, but officials said the situation was calm.

<TEXT>
   The cast of the struggling Broadway play
``Checkmates'' got some dramatic news: The comedy was bankrolled in
part by an accused drug trafficker serving 28 years to life for
attempted murder.
   Michael Harris, a producer of the play at New York's 46th Street
Theater, is an inmate at California's San Quentin Prison, his
lawyer, Roger Rosen, confirmed.
   The play's manager, Roy Somlyo, said Tuesday he was shocked at
the news and had removed Harris' name from the marquee.
   ``It's quite unnerving to us all,'' Somlyo said in a telephone
interview before going to break the news to the cast.
   Harris, 26, who with a partner put up half the $770,000 it cost
to take the show to Broadway, was indicted Dec. 6 in a federal case
said to have cracked a multimillion-dollar international cocaine
ring.
   He is charged with conspiracy and possession of cocaine with
intent to distribute for being part of an organization that
stretched from Colombia to Detroit and Los Angeles, the U.S.
attorney's office here said.
   Harris and his partner, Hayward Collins, helped finance the play
first in Los Angeles and then on Broadway through their Los
Angeles-based Y NOT Productions, Somlyo said.
   Harris shared the financier's role with one of the biggest names
in theater. James Nederlander, whose organization owns more live
theaters than any other in the country, was a 50-50 partner with Y
NOT when ``Checkmates'' opened.
   Nederlander bowed out in September under a contract provision
that allowed him to abandon his investment if returns didn't justify
further participation, Somlyo said.
   Until Los Angeles television station KCBS reported on Harris'
background Monday night, those involved with the play thought of him
as just what the playbill says: A Louisiana native who has business
interests in Los Angeles.
   James Lester, the target of the murder attempt for which Harris
was convicted, said Harris accused him of stealing money from his
drug operation.
   ``He threw me out of the car and asked me, did I do it?'' Lester
said. ``I said `No.' He pushed me out and told me to run. I said,
`For what? I'm a guy, so why run?' He pointed a gun at me, told me
he was sorry. I said `For what? If you gotta do it, you gotta do
it.' And he shot me twice, and the gun jammed.''
   Lester said Harris left him for dead, but he recovered and
testified at the trial. Harris began serving his sentence in the
spring.
   Y NOT's lawyer, whose name, coincidentally, is Michael P. Harris,
says there was no sign the money to finance the play came from
illegitimate sources.
   ``He said he was in real estate and limousines, and I know he was
buying some hair salons,'' recounted the attorney, who met the other
Harris before he was incarcerated. ``He seemed like a legitimate
business guy.''
   ``The money always was in the form of a check,'' he said. ``If
drug money deals in greenbacks, I didn't see any of them.''
   Rosen, producer Harris' lawyer, declined to discuss his client's
role in the play or possible sources of income.
   There was no telephone listing for Collins.
   The show, meanwhile, goes on despite mostly negative reviews and
a somewhat disappointing turnout.
   The comedy, which opened Aug. 4, contrasts the lives of an
affluent young black couple _ Marsha Jackson and Denzel Washington,
who starred in the movies ``Soldier's Story'' and ``Cry Freedom'' _
with an older, more traditional black couple played by veterans Ruby
Dee and Paul Winfield.
   Ticket sales bring in enough to cover expenses, said Somlyo, who
predicted word-of-mouth endorsements would broaden the audience to
include more of the white, mainstream theater crowd.
   Harris was indicted along with 12 others in the drug trafficking
case.
   The man investigators described as ``Tall Mike'' who allegedly
``received 100-kilo quantities of cocaine and caused their
distribution and storage'' had seemed the perfect backer to the
manager of ``Checkmates.''
   ``Here I was sending him memos and letters,'' Somlyo said. ``I
sort of feel like I've been cheated by not being informed.''

   Her home destroyed by the Armenian
earthquake, Unara Alexanyan has been living in a beat-up jacket,
sleeping on rubble-strewn streets and keeping warming around
bonfires.
   ``I don't have anything _ no furniture, nothing,'' she said above
the bustle of families unloading bundles of their sole belongings at
the Leninakan airport.
   Mrs. Alexanyan was en route to an unknown destination as part of
the government's relocation efforts for the estimated 500,000 people
left homeless by the Dec. 7 quake.
   She said a sister and three grandchildren were missing and among
the dead.
   As the last survivors are being pulled from the wreckage of
apartment buildings, schools and factories, the focus is turning to
rebuilding the lives of people who, like Mrs. Alexanyan, lost
everything.
   Leninakan's streets were jammed last weekend with rescue
vehicles, trucks and buses, and private cars filled with people
fleeing for other parts of the republic.
   The dislocation aggravates an already serious refugee problem in
Armenia. More than 180,000 people fled to Armenia from adjoining
Azerbaijan in the three weeks before the tremor after at least 31
people were killed in ethnic violence.
   Soviet Premier Nikolai Ryzhkov said Monday that too many cars
were impeding the rescue effort and that the army had been ordered
to keep non-essential vehicles off tge roads into Leninakan and
nearby Spitak, which was nearly totally destroyed.
   The Tass news agency reported Tuesday that 7,300 people, mostly
women and children, were sent to sanitariums, vacation camps and
other places in Armenia and elsewhere in the southern Soviet Union.
   Soviet officials say 50,000 people can be accommodated in such
places and that evacuees will be cared for free of charge.
   Ryzhkov told a news conference the effort to move the homeless
out of damaged cities started slowly because no one wanted to leave
without knowing what happened to missing relatives.
   ``In the first three days we couldn't do anything to evacuate
people. We tried to tell people, `You have to take the children out.
You have to take the women and old people out.''' he said. ``The
first three days no one would listen. They still were in a state of
shock. Every family lost somebody.''
   Now, he said, people have started asking to be evacuated, or for
tents at least. Throughout, there has been enough food for the
homeless, and even those camped around bonfires in Leninakan all had
food with them, he reported.
   Many huddled and waited around bonfires made of cardboard and
debris. Anna Asatyan sat at a fire outside her home. The
130-year-old, single-story structure still stood, but she was afraid
to go back inside.
   Asked what she was going to do, she said: ``We are waiting.
Whatever the authorities say.''
   Ryzhkov has pledged the devastated cities will be rebuilt in two
years, despite the country's economic difficulties.

   Bombs set by suspected anti-government
militants ripped open a wall of a suburban prison, enabling more
than 200 convicts to escape, authorities said today. Two prisoners
were killed by guards.
   Tuesday night's prison break was the second in as many weeks and
the largest ever at Welikade Prison, which houses about 1,500
convicts.
   On Dec. 4, suspected Sinhalese extremists dressed in army
uniforms overpowered guards at a prison in central Sri Lanka and
freed six colleagues.
   A military spokesman, who cannot be identified under briefing
rules, said Tuesday night's escape apparently was engineered by the
People's Liberation Front, an extremist Sinhalese group trying to
topple the government and disrupt next Monday's presidential
elections.
   Heavily armed troops searched passenger buses and vehicles
entering the capital today. Police imposed an indefinite curfew in
northern neighborhoods near the prison and went house to house
searching for the escapees.
   The military spokesman said about 25 gunmen opened fire and threw
small bombs at the south wall of the prison. The explosions also
distracted guards in other sections of the facility, allowing other
inmates to scale the walls and escape, they said.
   ``It was a well-organized operation, pre-planned and possibly
done with inside connivance,'' the official said.
   Guards opened fire, killing at least two inmates, the spokesman
said.
   He said at least 220 prisoners escaped in six vehicles. Later,
they raided a laundry about a half-mile from the prison and switched
their prison uniforms for civilian clothes, the official said.
   At least 15 escapees were caught early today about seven miles
from the prison, he said.
   The spokesman said authorities believed other convicts reached
the town of Kelaniya, five miles north of Colombo, and escaped by
boats down the Kelani River.
   The front, which staged an unsuccessful coup attempt in 1971,
opposes the government's efforts to end the 5-year insurgency by
Tamil rebels fighting for an independent homeland in the north and
east of this Indian Ocean nation.
   The Sinhalese, who are predominantly Buddhist, make up 75 percent
of the island's 16 million people and control the government and the
military.
   The Tamils, who are Hindu and account for 18 percent of the
population, claim they are denied jobs and education by the
Sinhalese.

   A Jewish businessman interested in PTL's
real estate agreed to pay $65 million for the assets of the
scandal-plagued ministry, but refused to say if he would allow its
evangelical operations to continue.
   The head of Heritage Ministries, PTL's religious successor,
however, said the deal means merely a change in landlords and
purchaser Stephen Mernick told him he was ``sensitive'' to the
religious operation.
   Mernick, a nonpracticing Orthodox rabbi from Toronto, bought the
assets Tuesday for $10 million less than the value placed on it by
U.S. Banktruptcy Judge Rufus Reynolds, and only a little more than
half of what he offered a month ago.
   Reynolds approved the cash sale after polling major creditors at
a hearing. Most said it was the best deal they would get for what
once had been a $160 million empire.
   ``As far as I'm concerned, the jig is over _ I'm approving the
sale,'' the judge said.
   Mernick, a 34-year-old real estate magnate, on Monday bid $36.25
million at Heritage USA headquarters near Fort Mill, one week after
PTL founder Jim Bakker and three former associates were indicted on
fraud and conspiracy charges by a federal grand jury in North
Carolina.
   Mernick increased his bid to $65 million after meeting Tuesday
with attorneys for the ministry and creditors.
   ``We're excited,'' Mernick told reporters outside the courthouse
after Reynold's decision. ``We're very excited and happy we won. We
look forward to being here.''
   The Heritage USA theme park and accompanying satellite television
operation were left behind by Bakker in March 1987 after he admitted
he had a sexual liaison with church secretary Jessica Hahn and had
her paid to keep quiet about it.
   Mernick said he would consider keeping Heritage USA operating as
a Christian park. However, he would not answer questions about
whether Heritage Ministries would be able to continue leasing the
television ministry and church at Fort Mill.
   ``We are in the middle of ongoing discussions'' with Heritage
Ministries, Mernick said, adding that he would outline plans within
two weeks. The assets purchased include the satellite network
carried on more than 800 cable systems; 1,700 undeveloped acres in
northern York County; two 500-room hotels, one unfinished; and a
water park.
   Mernick said in October that he was interested in PTL ``purely as
a real estate deal.''
   Sources close to Mernick said he intends to hold onto the
undeveloped land for up to 10 years as its value rises, and to come
up with a plan for the hotels and TV network, The Charlotte (N.C.)
Observer reported today.
   The sources told the newspaper Mernick is prepared to absorb $12
million in operating losses on PTL in the first year alone.
   Sam Johnson, president of the nonprofit Heritage Ministries and
pastor of the church, said Mernick told him he was ``sensitive'' to
the religious operation. Johnson said Heritage Ministries still
wants to buy Heritage USA, or at least the church, hotel, television
network and studios.
   ``What we've done is switch landlords. Our future depends on
negotiations with the new landlord,'' he said.
   The ministry filed for reorganization under bankruptcy laws in
June 1987, and attempts to sell it had included two auctions before
Tuesday.
   Had no acceptable bid been submitted, PTL would have been broken
up and sold, trustee M.C. ``Red'' Benton said.
   ``After the fiasco we had yesterday in getting people to bid,
this is a relief,'' Benton said.
   In an Aug. 18 appraisal, Arthur Little & Co. of Atlanta said
PTL's assets would be worth $76 million to $85 million if sold
piecemeal. Reynolds said the property is worth $75 million.
   A month ago, Mernick offered $115 million, $50 million in cash.
But Reynolds rejected the bid, saying there were inadequate
assurances that Mernick would pay the remaining $65 million.
   The purchase price would pay in full the $40 million in claims of
secured creditors, those whose claims are secured by collateral such
as land or buildings. It would also pay $5 million in administrative
costs.
   The rest would be divided among three groups of creditors: the
Internal Revenue Service, which is claiming about $60 million in
taxes; the Lifetime Partners, or major PTL contributors, who are
seeking at least $20 million; and unsecured creditors, whose claims
total $10 million to $13 million.
   Bidders this week included Johnson, Michael Karas, president of
First Canadian Development Co. of Toronto; and Cy Bahakel, a former
North Carolina state senator who owns 15 television and radio
stations.
   Bakker, who previously submitted a bid, had no comment on the
sale.

   The first five-minute test for AIDS has been
approved by the U.S. government, and authorities said it is 99.6
percent accurate and offers the fastest results of any tests for the
deadly disease.
   The test was cleared Tuesday by the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration. Its maker, Worcester-based Cambridge Bioscience,
said it should be on the market in a few weeks.
   ``This technical advance should help make testing available to
all who want to be tested,'' FDA Commissioner Frank E. Young said in
Washington. ``It will also be particularly useful in remote areas of
the world that lack the facilities for earlier approved tests.''
   The results of those earlier tests _ now the mainstay of AIDS
screening _ frequently are not available for weeks.
   Gary Buck, chairman of Cambridge Bioscience, said the new test,
called the Recombigen HIV-1 Latex Agglutination Test, should be
useful anywhere that quick results are important.
   ``The big boon is that it's fast, and it will be useful in Third
World countries and places where lab facilities might be less than
ideal in order to screen large populations in a rapid, simple way,''
said Dr. Paul Skolnik, a virologist at New England Medical Center.
   The test is 99.6 percent accurate, Buck said. But the company
recommends that as with the current screening test, called the
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, or ELISA, blood samples that are
positive for the AIDS virus be confirmed by a time-consuming, backup
test called the Western blot.
   The speed of the Recombigen means those who are free of the virus
are likely to be given the good news immediately, Buck said. But
those who are probably infected will be told further testing is
necessary.
   Like other AIDS tests, this one checks for AIDS infection by
spotting antibodies to the human immunodeficiency virus, or HIV,
which causes AIDS.
   ``All of the present (ELISA) tests require, under the best of
circumstances, three to five hours,'' Buck said. ``This test
requires three to five minutes.''
   Unlike the ELISA, which requires labs and technicians, the new
test can be given under crude conditions where even refrigeration is
lacking. Experts believe this should make the test useful in places
like Africa, where acquired immune deficiency syndrome is widespread
and where blood is frequently not screened before transfusions.
   Teena Lerner, an analyst at Shearson Lehman Hutton in New York,
said the test also may be given in many settings in the United
States, such as venereal disease clinics.
   ``In a lot of the voluntary testing centers, there is a huge
proportion of people who don't come back to find the answer,'' she
said. ``The ones who are most likely to be positive are the ones who
are most likely to chicken out.''
   Other potential uses include testing trauma patients in emergency
rooms and checking organ donors before transplants.
   Buck predicted the test will account for 10 percent to 15 percent
of all AIDS testing during its second year on the market. It will be
sold to health care professionals for $10 per test, he said.
   Although other companies are working on quick AIDS tests, Lerner
said she believes it will be at least a year before Cambridge
Bioscience's nearest competitor wins approval.
   The new test is based on a portion of the protein that makes up
the outer jacket of the AIDS virus. This protein, which is made
through genetic engineering, is coated onto tiny white latex beads.
AIDS antibodies in blood are attracted to the protein, and when they
come together, the latex beads form clumps.
   AIDS is caused by a virus that damages the body's immune system,
leaving victims susceptible to infections and cancer.
   It is spread most often through sexual contact, needles or
syringes shared by drug abusers, infected blood or blood products,
and from pregnant women to their offspring.

<TEXT>
   The captain of an Indian merchant ship struck by
a Navy missile said he was told by the U.S. Navy his vessel was out
of a restricted training area before it was accidentally hit,
killing a crewman.
   ``I was being guided by the missile facility,'' said Capt. P.M.
Mirchandani, who spoke with reporters Tuesday after bringing the
550-foot Jag Vivek into port here for repairs.
   ``I heard a noise and saw splinters flying out onto the deck,''
the 34-year-old captain said of Monday's incident, which occurred
when his ship was about 80 miles north-northwest of the island of
Kauai.
   A Navy spokesman, Lt. Cmdr. Gary Shrout, said Mirchandani's
contention that his ship was being guided by Navy controllers at the
Pacific Missile Range was under investigation.
   ``Everybody has a little tiny piece of the puzzle and it's going
to take a while to put all these pieces together and figure out just
what happened,'' Shrout said at news conference at Pearl Harbor.
   Attorney Leondard Alcantara, representing the Jag Vivek's owners,
said controllers at the missile range radioed the ship at about 8
a.m. Monday that it was entering a restricted area.
   The Navy ``gave them a course to steer around it. They steered on
that course for approximately two to three hours and were then told
they were clear of the missile range, and 40 minutes later they were
struck by a missile,'' said Alcantara.
   The 12-foot-long, 1,000-pound unarmed Harpoon missile hit the
ship from the stern at about noon, tearing through the upper level
of the pilot house and emerging with sufficient force to put a large
dent in one of the ship's cranes before falling into the sea.
   The radio officer, K.T. Joseph, a 36-year-old Indian citizen, was
wounded by shrapnel and died after being carried to the bridge,
Alcantara said.
   An FA-18 attack fighter from the aircraft carrier USS
Constellation fired the missile at a derelict ship being used for
target practice, but it's infrared guidance system later locked onto
the Jag Vivek and it veered in that direction, Shrout said.
   At the time, the jet was 45 miles from the merchant ship, well
out of visual range, he said.
   Although the Navy has not accepted responsibility for the
accident, pending its investigation, the commander of the Pearl
Harbor Naval Base, Rear Adm. Stephen Chadwick, went aboard the Jag
Vivek as it approached Honolulu to express condolences to the
captain for the loss of his crewman, Shrout said.
   The Navy also has offered any assistance it can provide to the

   The Jag Vivek was expected to remain in Honolulu for a few days
to repair the demolished radio room before resuming it's voyage to

   Universal Pictures and Cineplex
Odeon will re-release ``The Last Temptation of Christ'' this spring,
months after the film was greeted by demonstrations and boycotts.
   The re-release of the film, which depicts Christ as a doubting
savior suffering from human frailties, is timed to coincide with
anticipated nominations for Academy Awards, Golden Globe Awards and
film critics' 10-Best lists, said Garth Drabinsky, chairman of the
Cineplex Odeon theater chain.
   When it opened in August, it was denounced by some conservative
Christians as being blasphemous. Several theaters showing the film
were vandalized and some U.S. theater chains refused to show it.
   ``We've had to deal with the outcry of people from time to time,
but we've never chosen to back down in matters that we believe
firmly are exemplary in the spirit of an enlightened democratic
country,'' Drabinsky said Monday.
   Although the movie opened to strong box-office business, it was
far from a commercial hit.

<HEAD>EPA: Beatrice Property In Woburn Highly Contaminated</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEFAN FATSIS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal agency says a property once owned by
Beatrice Foods Co. is highly contaminated, and lawyers for families
seeking redress for six cancer deaths say the report could help them
reopen a lawsuit against the food giant.
   The Environmental Protection Agency report, released Tuesday,
says the former Beatrice property contains the most contaminated
soil of any site near two wells in suburban Woburn. Eight families
claim polluted water from the wells caused the deaths.
   Jan Schlichtmann, a lawyer representing the families, said he
would attempt to introduce the report as evidence in hearings that
begin today in U.S. District Court in Boston.
   The hearings in the controversial, 6-year-old case are to
determine whether Beatrice intentionally concealed evidence during a
1986 trial in which it was cleared of liability for the pollution.
   Schlichtmann claimed the report marked the ``first time the EPA
said the Beatrice property polluted'' the two wells.
   EPA officials, however, said the report merely summarized
existing information and didn't blame any particular sites for
causing the well pollution. The report was based on surveys done in
the past six months.
   ``The material is not designed to bolster allegations of what
conditions were like 20 years ago,'' when the well contamination
first occurred, EPA Deputy Regional Administrator Paul Keough said.
   ``All we've done is to do an investigation of soil and
groundwater sampling as we begin to finalize a cleanup program'' for
the area of the wells.
   Jerome Facher, a lawyer for Beatrice, reiterated the company's
contention that pollution at its former site didn't contaminate the
wells.
   Beatrice owned a tannery on a 15-acre parcel of land from 1978 to
1983, when it sold the tannery and property to the John J. Riley Co.
   ``The property contains the most extensive area of contaminated
soil and the highest concentrations of contaminants anywhere within
the wells ... site,'' the report by the EPA's regional office in
Boston said.
   Among contaminants the EPA has identified in the area are
polychlorinated biphenyls, arsenic, mercury and cadmium.
   The two wells were shut down in 1979 after several toxic
contaminants were found. They had supplied water since 1964 to a
neighborhood in this city of 36,000 about 12 miles north of Boston.
   The report said the Beatrice property and five other nearby sites
``have contributed and are continuing to contribute to the
groundwater contamination in the aquifer supplying water'' to the
two wells.
   It does not conclude which sites were responsible for
contaminating the wells and said the sites currently pose no health
risk.
   A federal district court jury in July 1986 cleared Beatrice of
liability.
   U.S. District Judge Walter Jay Skinner last January denied the
families a new trial after their attorney learned of a 1983 report
that said dumping on the tannery property may have contributed to
groundwater pollution near the wells.
   But the 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Boston last week
ordered Skinner to hold new hearings to determine whether defense
lawyers ``knowingly and intentionally'' withheld the report from the
families.
   The original suit contended that four parties were responsible
for the pollution: Beatrice; Riley; W.R. Grace Co.; and Unifirst, a
uniform supply company. Unifirst settled before the trial and W.R.
Grace settled for a reported $8 million halfway through the trial.

<TEXT>
   An award-winning convict journalist who
gave authorities information about Louisiana's pardon-selling
scandal received a favorable clemency recommendation from the state
Pardon Board.
   The board recommended Tuesday that Billy Wayne Sinclair's life
sentence for a 1965 murder be reduced to 75 years in prison, with
parole eligibility after 25 years. Sinclair, who has served 23
years, could win his freedom in about two years if Gov. Buddy Roemer
goes along with the board's recommendation.
   Sinclair, 43, a former editor of the inmate news magazine The
Angolite at the Louisiana State Penitentiary, originally was
sentenced to die for the slaying of James C. Bodden, a Baton Rouge
convenience store clerk shot after a bungled robbery.
   His sentence was commuted to life imprisonment in 1972 after the
U.S. Supreme Court struck down the state's capital punishment law.
   Two years ago, Sinclair aided an investigation that led to the
conviction and imprisonment of former Pardon Board Chairman Howard
Marsellus Jr.
   After being approached by a corrections official who sought
$15,000 in return for a pardon, Sinclair went to federal authorities.
   The clemency request was opposed by the East Baton Rouge Parish
prosecutor and members of Bodden's family.
   ``I don't think he's rehabilitated enough to be out on the
street,'' said Sadie Bodden DeLee, Bodden's widow.
   Sinclair is the second editor of the prison magazine to come up
for clemency this month. Last week, the governor rejected a pardon
board recommendation for Wilbert Rideau, another killer who is still
editor at the Angola prison.
   Sinclair's wife, Jodie, said the Pardon Board's decision
``righted a great wrong'' since other convicts who gave information
to authorities about the pardon-selling scandal had been freed.
   ``I am so deeply grateful to the board for the forgiveness and
mercy they have shown,'' she said.
   Sinclair has been before the Pardon Board five times and received
four favorable clemency recommendations, but has been unable to
receive approval from the governor's office.

   The Israeli army is giving top priority to
training its troops to withstand nerve and mustard gas attacks,
fearing Arab enemies could unleash such weaponry at any time, senior
military commanders say.
   The commanders briefed reporters Tuesday at this base in southern
Israel during combat drills in which soldiers staged gun and tank
battles using live ammunition while wearing their new heavy
chemical-repellent gear.
   All soldiers have in the past year been issued the charcoal-lined
uniforms, gas masks, poison detection tape, rubber gloves and boots.
   They take it with them in their kitbags whether they are assigned
to combat duty in Lebanon or to police the occupied territories,
said Lt. Col. S., an organizer of the anti-chemical warfare
campaign. Under Israeli press regulations, commanding officers may
only be identified by the first letter of their first or last names.
   ``We are taking the threat of chemical war very seriously,
especially after the Iran-Iraq war,'' in which such weapons were
widely used, Lt. Col. S. said.
   Drills such as one in which two dozen troops stormed a mock
village of cement shacks nicknamed Chicago are taking up at least a
quarter of the average soldier's training time this year. Some
soldiers are ordered to wear the gear in almost every exercise the
army conducts, the officers said.
   The aim is to train the soldiers to protect themselves and fight
despite a rain of poisonous gas, they said.
   The gear is so uncomfortable that some of it, such as the gloves,
are not worn during drills to avoid shooting accidents, some
officers said. They said that in some cases commanders have to
prompt soldiers to put on their masks by hurling tear gas cannisters
near them.
   Israel's is concerned that Syria, Iran and Iraq have the
capabilities of carrying out chemical attacks, said Lt. Col. Y.,
another senior commander at the base.
   ``We know that Arab countries are investing a great deal in
creating chemical weapons,'' Lt. Col Y said. ``We don't ask
questions, we just prepare.''
   He said the army plans to distribute gas masks to civilians in
two Israeli towns later this month as part of a civil defense drill.
   The officers also showed reporters an array of equipment to
handle a chemical attack, including U.S. and Israeli-made portable
gas detection machines that look like automobile batteries and a
pocket calculator programmed to detect poisonous fumes.
   Also displayed were antidotes to chemical contamination such as
white pills that look like aspirin which are taken when there is
advance warning of an attack and atropine injections used after
contamination.

<HEAD>Dutch Woman Wounded In Nationalist Unrest Allowed To Leave Tibet</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A Dutch woman who was shot in the arm during a
bloody protest in the Tibetan capital of Lhasa and had her passport
confiscated is being allowed to leave the volatile region, a Dutch
diplomat said today.
   Chinese authorities returned Christa Meindersma's passport today,
two days after confiscating it, said Willem de Bruin, adminstrative
and consular attache at the Dutch Embassy.
   He said he did not know when Ms. Meindersma would leave Lhasa,
but her original intention had been to fly to Hong Kong on Thursday.
   Dutch officials had been trying without success to get
information on Ms. Meindersma's condition since she was shot during
a nationalist demonstration in Lhasa's central square on Saturday.
   De Bruin said the Chinese Foreign Ministry finally responded to
his queries today. The Chinese move came after the Dutch Foreign
Ministry in The Hague urged China to return Ms. Meindersma's
passport.
   De Bruin said he did not know whether the Chinese had returned
passports to other foreigners who also had their travel documents
seized. At least four other Western travelers had their passports
confiscated, said Ron Schwartz, a sociology professor from the
University of Newfoundland in St. Johns, Canada.
   Schwartz was contacted in Lhasa by telephone.
   China's official media has said one Tibetan Buddhist monk was
killed and 13 people injured when police fired on protesters
carrying a banned Tibetan flag near the Jokhang Monastery in the
city's central square.
   A West German tourist said Tuesday that he had seen the body of a
child carried into a hospital near the square. He said a friend saw
two children, lying dead in the market after the protest.
   The West German, who spoke on condition of anonymity, also said
Tibetans told him seven people were killed but this could not be
independently confirmed.
   Chinese reports have not mentioned arrests but tourist contacted
by telephone have reported witnessing some arrests and hearing
reports of others. The arrests could also not be independently
confirmed.
   Tibetan independence activists seek the return of Tibet's exiled
leader, the Dalai Lama, and an end to 38 years of Chinese communist
rule. Saturday's bloodshed marked the third time in 14 months that
Chinese security forces and protesters have clashed.
   At total of at least 38 people were killed in violent clashes
with police on Oct. 1, 1987 and March 5.
   In a telephone interview Tuesday, Ms. Meindersma said she had
been examined by a Swiss doctor and that he had written a letter to
Chinese authorities urging them to let her leave the country for
treatment in Hong Kong.
   ``The doctor said that if I don't leave soon for Hong Kong for
therapy there will be permanent damage to my arm and to my
muscles,'' she said.

   U.S. and Soviet scientists plan to study world
environmental problems and the devastating earthquake in Armenia
under joint agreements between researchers from the two countries.
   Sixteen U.S. earthquake experts will leave for Armenia in seven
to 10 days, Gail Porter, spokeswoman for the U.S. National Academy
of Sciences, said Tuesday in Irvine.
   The agreements were announced after meetings in Washington last
week and in Irvine this week between officials of the American
academy and a 17-member delegation from the Academy of Sciences of
the U.S.S.R., Porter said.
   The Dec. 7 quake in Soviet Armenia, centered near the
Soviet-Turkish border, measured 6.9 on the Richter scale and killed
at least 55,000 people, according to Soviet officials.
   The U.S. and Soviet academies also will form a new joint Academy
Committee on Global Ecology, which will ``assess global threats to
Earth's ecological well-being.''
   Among other problems, the committee will consider warming of
Earth's climate by the ``greenhouse effect,'' depletion of the
protective ozone layer, extinction of thousands of plant and animal
species, exhaustion of energy supplies and other natural resources,
and widespread pollution.
   ``The consequences of the rapid growth of our population coupled
with global economic development now pose a significant threat to
our continued existence,'' the academies said in a joint statement.
   The Americans will visit Armenia ``to improve scientific
understanding of such earthquakes, engineering knowledge of the
failure of structures and techniques for post-disaster assessment,
and to allow early application of this knowledge to reduce the
effects of such disasters in the future,'' said Frank Press,
president of the American academy.
   The U.S. team will include seismologists, architects, structural
and geotechnical engineers, and experts on industrial facilities,
rescue operations, emergency planning and utility lifelines, Press
said in a statement.
   Since 1964, the U.S. academy has organized similar teams to
conduct on-site investigations of disasters, including earthquakes,
in Alaska, Mexico City, central Greece, Algeria, Romania and Turkey,
the academy said.
   The committee will meet once or twice annually, with the first
meeting expected during the first half of 1989 in the Soviet Union.
   The group will monitor scientific and policy needs involving
environmental problems, identify way to better understand complex
ecological issues, emphasize subjects not receiving adequate
attention, and make periodic reports to both governments.
   The American team of earthquake experts visiting Armenia will be
led by seismologist John Filson, former head of the U.S. Geological
Survey's Office of Earthquakes, Volcanoes and Engineering, and
Mikhran Agbabian, chairman of the University of Southern
California's civil engineering department.

   The Vatican has hosted Russian Orthodox
clergymen and offered them assistance in hopes of capitalizing on
``glasnost'' to improve the lot of Roman Catholics in the Soviet
Union, a Vatican official says.
   In the past month, three Russian Orthodox officials have visited
the Vatican and met with Pope John Paul II. Two Roman Catholic
church leaders from Poland also visited the Soviet Union recently,
and the Vatican newspaper devoted two full pages to an effusive
report by one of them on a changed attitude to religion by the
Soviet leadership.
   ``The greater freedom the Russian Church receives could help the
Roman Catholic minority profit from `perestroika' and `glasnost,'''
said the Vatican official, using Soviet President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev's terms for reforming society and greater openness.
   ``Therefore, I have realistic hope _ not a fantasy _ that the
situation of the Roman Catholic church will be substantially
improved in the not distant future,'' said the official, who has
first-hand knowledge of the recent contacts. He spoke on condition
his name not be used.
   In June, the Vatican sent a top delegation to the Soviet Union to
help the Orthodox Church celebrate the 1,000 anniversary of the
Christianity's arrival in Russia.
   ``If the Vatican gives its support (to the celebrations) it is
worldwide support,'' the official said in an interview Monday.
   Starting in mid-November, three Russian Orthodox prelates paid
separate visits to the Vatican. Archbishop Pitirim of the Moscow
Patriarchate saw the pope on Dec. 1, accompanied by an official of
the Soviet news agency Tass.
   According to the Vatican official, Pitirim asked the Vatican's
help in supplying Bibles while another churchman, Archbishop
Alexander of the Zagorsk Theological Academy, wanted to know how the
Vatican organizes its universities and academies.
   Another Vatican official said such assistance in the past had
been ``sporadic'' but that it has now been increased and put on a
more formal basis.
   The Vatican's endorsement of the changed attitude was signaled by
an article carried by L'Osservatore Romano, the Vatican daily
newspaper, by Cardinal Jozef Glemp, the Roman Catholic primate of
Poland.
   Glemp wrote that he found it ``comforting'' that Soviet
authorities were ``abandoning'' the Stalinist policy of persecuting
the church.
   Glemp's trip was followed by a visit in early December by the
secretary of the Polish bishops conference, Bishop Jerzy Dabrowski.
   The Baltic states are the Roman Catholic strongholds in the
Soviet Union. At least 2 million of Lithuania's 3.5 million people
are Roman Catholics.
   The senior Vatican official made a distinction between Roman
Catholics and Ukrainian Catholics of the Eastern rite. The Ukrainian
church was brutally suppressed by Soviet dictator Jozef Stalin, who
ordered it absorbed into the Russian Orthodox Church.
   Ukrainian clerics say an estimated 4 million Ukrainian Catholics
operate an underground church that remains loyal to the pope.
   The Vatican official acknowledged the situation was more
difficult for them because of historic antagonism between the
Orthodox and Ukrainians.
   The Polish pontiff has often said he would like to visit the
Soviet Union but only if he could visit his flock throughout the
country.
   Last week, Italian Premier Ciriaco De Mita said Gorbachev will
visit Italy next year. That could set the stage for a historic
meeting between the pope and Communist party leader and discussions
about a possible papal visit.
   The Soviet ambassador to Italy paid a rare call on the pope in
July and last Saturday John Paul offered condolences to Gorbachev
for the deadly earthquake in Armenia. He also sent $100,000 to the
Orthodox patriarch of Armenia, Vasken I.

<HEAD>Nussbaum Says She Lied About Lisa's Injuries to Protect Steinberg</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SAMUEL MAULL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hedda Nussbaum testified she did not ``directly
observe'' her former live-in lover Joel Steinberg bruise their
6-year-old, illegally adopted daughter, but she assumed he had and
lied to police to protect him.
   During her seventh and final day of testimony in Steinberg's
murder trial, Nussbaum, 46, testified Tuesday that on the morning
Lisa Steinberg was taken unconscious from their Greenwich Village
apartment, she told detectives a playmate had hit the child in the
head a few days earlier.
   She said she also told them Lisa ``fell a lot while roller
skating.''
   Ms. Nussbaum admitted under cross-examination by Steinberg's
lawyer, Ira London, that these statements were either wholly or
partly lies. She said she really believed the injuries were
inflicted by Steinberg although she had not seen him hit Lisa the
night the prosecution says the fatal blow was struck.
   ``I was trying to create a cover story at the time for what Joel
had done to Lisa,'' she said.
   Steinberg, a 47-year-old disbarred lawyer, is charged with
beating Lisa the night of Nov. 1, 1987, causing her death three days
later. The death, occurring in an affluent, well-educated household,
shocked many and has become a nationwide symbol of abuse as a
problem that cuts across social strata.
   No testimony was scheduled today. Judge Harold Rothwax told
defense lawyers he wants them to file papers by Friday if they plan
to request permission to submit an insanity defense. London said
they would.
   As Tuesday wound down, Assistant District Attorney Peter Casolaro
proceeded with redirect examination in what appeared to be an
attempt to win back some of the sympathy Ms. Nussbaum lost under
London's quiet but painstaking questioning.
   During his fifth and final day of cross-examining Ms. Nussbaum,
London asked about what she told police: ``Were those statements
true when you made them?''
   ``No,'' Ms. Nussbaum replied. ``She (Lisa) said that a kid had
hit her a few days before and I _ she didn't fall a lot roller
skating. She was a good roller skater.''
   ``So that was a lie you told?'' London asked.
   ``That was a lie, yes.''
   As for the blow from the playmate, Ms. Nussbaum said she told
police the child had hit Lisa ``hard'' although Lisa had merely said
the other child hit her.
   London suggested that Ms. Nussbaum was really trying to protect
herself rather than Steinberg.
   ``Well, had you seen Joel hit Lisa on the head?'' the defense
lawyer asked.
   ``No, I had not seen that.''
   ``So who were you covering up for, Joel or you?''
   ``Well, any of the bruises that were on her body, I was assuming
came from Joel.''
   ``And yet you admit now that you don't know if those bruises were
a result of anything that Joel did, isn't that right?''
   ``I didn't directly observe him do it, no.''
   London has suggested that Ms. Nussbaum was perhaps as guilty as
Steinberg for failing to act for many hours as Lisa lay comatose on
the cold, tiled floor of their bathroom.

<HEAD>Snowstorm Strikes Long Island</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Snow fell in the Northeast and upper Midwest today after a heavy
snowstorm snarled traffic in New York and Connecticut and warm winds
pushed the mercury to record highs in the Great Plains.
   Snow advisories were in effect in sections of New York, Rhode
Island, Massachusetts, Connecticut, Vermont, North Dakota,
Minnesota, Wisconsin and Michigan. A blowing snow advisory was also
in effect in parts of northeastern North Dakota.
   Tuesday's storm dumped 9 inches of snow on Islip, 6 inches on
Massapequa, 5{ at Farmingdale and lesser amounts on other parts of
New York's Long Island, and left 6 inches in Bridgeport, Conn., and
3 to 4 in New Haven, Conn.
   The storm snarled evening rush-hour traffic in both states, and
caused minor accidents in Connecticut.
   ``The first time it snows, people forget how to drive,'' said
Connecticut State Police Sgt. Steven Bognar. ``Some nitwit will be
going 5 mph and another nitwit will be going 55 mph.''
   Vermont got 2 to 4 inches, and snowfall was expected to
accumulate to up to 6 inches in southern sections of the state
today. By early this morning, Dummerston, Vt., had received 4 inches
and the western Massachusetts town of Greenfield had gotten 5.
   In the Midwest, the storm stretching from northeastern North
Dakota to northern Wisconsin and Upper Michigan left 6 inches of
snow in Devils Lake, N.D., and 4 inches in Grand Forks, N.D.
   Strong, gusty winds blew through the northern Plains, with gusts
of up to 52 mph in Grand Forks.
   Snow was expected to develop today and Thursday in Colorado,
especially over the foothills of the Rockies. A winter storm watch
for Colorado's eastern foothills was to go into effect this
afternoon and remain posted through Thursday.
   Temperatures early today dropped into the 30s as far south as
northern Florida, where a hard freeze warning was in effect. The low
temperatures were expected to do little damage to the state's citrus
crop.
   A vicious cold spell in New York City on Sunday and Monday may
have been responsible for the deaths of five men, at least four of
whom were apparently homeless, authorities said Tuesday.
   On Tuesday, westerly winds along the Rockies' east slopes led to
temperatures in the 60s in the western Plains from Montana to Texas.
Record highs for the date were set in Rapid City, S.D., where it was
64 degrees and Goodland, Kan., where it was 73.

<TEXT>
   Yasser Arafat's appeal to Israel to join
U.N.-sponsored talks fell far short of what is needed from the
Palestine Liberation Organization chairman to achieve peace, U.S.
Jewish leaders say.
   ``It's sad that after all the years of bloodshed, all the hype
and theatrics and, yes, even the recent hope of change, Arafat still
could not bring himself to explicitly recognize Israel and reject
terrorism,'' Abraham H. Foxman, national director of the
Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith, said Tuesday.
   Arafat urged Israel to join in talks under the aegis of the
United Nations to produce a settlement based on security for all
nations of the region, including Israel and a Palestinian state.
   ``Yasser Arafat's speech in Geneva can only be described as
bitterly disappointing,'' said Rabbi Alexander M. Schindler,
president of the Union of American Hebrew Congregations.
   ``He failed to clarify the ambiguities of the Algiers declaration
and the hints he dropped in Stockholm,'' said Schindler. ``If
anything, his speech today was a retreat from his previous
statements.''
   Ira Silverman, executive vice president of the American Jewish
Committee, said there were ``some positive words'' in Arafat's
address, but he also called it disappointing.
   ``We still wait for clear-cut acceptance of Israel's right to
exist and for unconditional rejection of terrorism,'' Silverman
said. ``Let him match words with deeds.''
   ``Yasser Arafat had an opportunity to break with the past and
launch a new initiative. He blew it,'' said Morris Abram, chairman
of the Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish
Organizations.

<HEAD>Man Who Supported Sakharov Released from Internal Exile</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A man who was sentenced to seven years in a labor
camp and two years of exile for protesting the internal exile of
Nobel Peace Prize winner Andrei D. Sakharov has been freed, a
dissident source said today.
   Alexander Podrabinek, an editor of the human rights journal
Express-Chronicle, said Vazif Meilanov, a 50-year-old mathematician,
was freed from exile in Yakutia in Siberia by an clemency order of
the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet, the country's highest executive
body.
   He said Meilanov, who was convicted of hooliganism, had not asked
for clemency.
   Sakharov publicly raised Meilanov's case when he visited the
United States last month, noting that he was free and living in
Moscow once more while Meilanov still was in exile.
   In January 1980, shortly after Sakharov was sent into exile in
the closed city of Gorky for protesting the Soviet intervention in
Afghanistan, Meilanov held a one-man protest in his home city of
Makhachala on the Caspian Sea.
   He wore a sign around his neck saying, ``Free Sakharov.''
   Podrabinek said Meilanov had arrived in Moscow, but it was not
certain yet whether he would try to settle in the capital or return
to his aging parents in Makhachala.

<HEAD>Italy Sends North Africans Back to Tunisia</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TRAPANI, Sicily (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Refused entry at five Italian ports, 89
migrant vendors from North Africa have sailed back to Tunisia where
they started their voyage a week ago.
   The group of Algerians, Senegalese and Moroccans had sailed the
Mediterranean for more than a week aboard the ferry Petrarca while
Italian port authorities refused them permission to disembark.
   ``We can't let them disembark because they aren't in compliance
with Italian immigration laws,'' Giuseppe Torricelli, director of
border police in the Sardinian port of Cagliari, was quoted as
saying by the Turin daily La Stampa.
   After a second rejection Tuesday by authorities in Cagliari, the
North Africans boarded another ferry, the Carducci, bound for this
northwestern port city, where they had also been refused entry last
week.
   Frontier police here rejected the North Africans a second time,
saying they didn't have work permits, travel documents or means of
supporting themselves.
   The group, which departed Tunisia on Dec. 7, had also been
rejected in Genoa and at Olbia and Arbatax in Sardinia. Its odyssey
ended Tuesday when the Carducci left Trapani for Tunisia.
   Communist Party Senator Francesco Macis boarded the Petrarca in
Cagliari to check on the condition of the passengers, many of whom
had received medical treatment during the week.
   ``Certainly the problem is delicate,'' La Stampa quoted Macis as
saying. ``Italy is not in a position to accept the growing number of
immigrants.''
   In a recent study, Alberto Sobrero of the Institute for
Political, Economic and Social Studies estimated that between 70,000
and 100,000 illegal immigrants enter Italy each year.

<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The discovery of thousands of artifacts
dating to the Gold Rush represents the ``birthplace of Chinatown,''
said an archaeologist.
   The find is the ``most significant'' discovery of Chinese
material in California since the wreck of a 16th century Spanish
galleon carrying Ming Dynasty-era pottery was found at Point Reyes
north of San Francisco a few years ago, Clarence Shangraw, the chief
currator of the city's Asian Art Museum, said Tuesday.
   The artifacts were found during the past two weeks during
excavations of a site for a 20-story bank and will be displayed at
the Asian Art Museum. City law requires all construction sites to be
evaluated for their archaeological value.
   ``I am hoping that these things will really be able to add a
tangible dimension to early Chinese history in California,'' said
urban archaeologist Allen Pastron. ``They will help tell us how they
lived, what they did and their relationship to other parts of the
community.''
   Pastron said the discovery of bottles, pottery, coins and even an
opium pipe bowl, indicate the site was a store operated by Chinese
merchants in 1850 and 1851.
   The building is assumed to have burned or exploded in one of a
half-dozen fires that devastated San Francisco between 1849 and
1851, collapsing onto itself.
   ``What we have down here is a moment in time,'' Pastron said. The
store represents ``literally the birthplace of Chinatown,'' he said.
   After the discovery of gold in California, Chinese came to San
Francisco, then a tent city they called Gum San, or ``Big City of
the Golden Hill.''

<TEXT>
   More than 200 of Roy Orbison's friends,
including Kris Kristofferson and Graham Nash, turned out for a
private gathering to honor the late musician.
   Celebrity guests arrived Tuesday night by limousine, many of them
shunning reporters and slipping through a back entrance to the
Wiltern Theater.
   Orbison died of a heart attack Dec. 6 in Hendersonville, Tenn.,
at the age of 52.
   ``He was an unbelievable vocalist,'' said Nash as he went into
the theater. ``I'm here to pay tribute, to feel his presence, and to
say goodbye.''
   The evening was highlighted by performances from Bonnie Raitt,
J.D. Souther and Brian Setzer, playing with his band, The Stray Cats.
   But a reunion of the remaining members of Orbison's last band,
The Traveling Wilburys, did not materialize. Tom Petty and Jeff
Lynne, two of the Wilburys, watched the evening's performances but
did not take the stage, publicists said.
   Barbara Orbison, the singer's widow, delivered an emotional
recollection of the performer's life, saying Orbison was very happy
at the time of his death and appreciated the popularity of his music.
   At a memorial service last weekend in Gallatin, Tenn., 75 of
Orbison's friends attended a 30-minute tribute where he was
eulogized as a legendary performer with a world-wide following.
   Orbison was best remembered as a versatile singer-songwriter,
with a range from upbeat songs such as ``Oh, Pretty Woman'' to moody
ballads like ``Only the Lonely'' and ``Blue Bayou.''

<HEAD>Planeloads of Medical Supplies Head for Soviet Earthquake Survivors</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Three planeloads of medical supplies for earthquake survivors in
Soviet Armenia departed California and a Red Cross charter crossed
the country to pick up supplies donated by major drug companies as
relief efforts continued.
   Fifty cartons of medicine and equipment gathered by the Armenian
Relief Society in San Francisco left Travis Air Force Base Tuesday
night aboard an Aeroflot jetliner normally used by Soviet INF Treaty
inspectors, said Lt. Col. Jim Dilda.
   Two other relief planes left Los Angeles International Airport
earlier Tuesday for the stricken region where at least 55,000 are
believed dead and 13,000 injured.
   A Soviet Aeroflot Ilyushin C-76, the first permitted to land at
the airport in a decade, left for the Armenian capital of Yerevan
with 30 tons of orthopedic equipment, pharmaceuticals and other
medical equipment worth $600,000. The supplies had been donated by
the Monrovia-based World Vision International, a Christian relief
organization.
   ``We're sending whatever they need. We are collecting money,
medicine, whatever they need,'' said Archbishop Vatche Hovsepian,
prelate of the Western Diocese of the Armenian Apostolic Church.
   A Flying Tigers 747 carried 50 tons of medicine, burn kits,
splints, blankets and generators to the disaster area. The flight
also took about 70 doctors, nurses and medical technicians from
Medical Teams International of Portland, Ore.
   The American Red Cross charter departed Anchorage, Alaska, and
planned stops in Chicago and New York today to pick medicine donated
by pharmaceutical makers before heading for Yerevan.
   ``This was a rush job to get this whole thing put together,''
said Terry Gautier, a Red Cross spokeswoman in Washington, D.C.
   Eli Lilly Co. donated $1.25 million in antibiotics to the mercy
mission, and Indiana State Police troopers escorted the shipment
from the company's Indianapolis headquarters to O'Hare International
Airport while Red Cross officials held the plane.
   G.D. Searle & Co. said it gave 300,000 tablets of the
anti-infective drug flagyl worth $350,000. The drug is used to treat
diseases such as amoebic dysentery, which may result from
contaminated food or water.
   The flight, the fourth assembled by the American Red Cross this
week, eventually will carry 75,000 pounds of supplies worth $3
million, including syringes, intravenous solutions and plastic
sheeting for constructing emergency shelters, Gaultier said.
   Robert Vessey, the group's national director of disaster
services, is scheduled to meet the aircraft in New York and travel
to the Soviet Union, she said.
   Relief workers also were loading a charter plane in Maryland with
6,000 cartons of aid, including $1.3 million in drugs and medical
supplies donated by drug companies. The flight is scheduled to leave
Dulles International Airport Friday.
   ``The essential items _ the medicine _ will go first and whatever
room is left will be for blankets, shoes, baby food, peanut butter,
canned meat products and beans,'' Peter Petrossian, head of the
Armenian Association of Baltimore, said Tuesday evening. ``Whatever
we can't get on the first plane we'll put on the next planes Sunday
and Monday.''

   An explosion at a courthouse
slightly injured two policemen and a civilian near the Irish border
today. The outlawed Irish Republican Army said it was responsible.
   The Royal Ulster Constabulary, Northern Ireland's police force,
said the attack occurred in Newry as the two policemen in an armored
vehicle were preparing to open the courthouse for the day. Police
were not releasing information about the injured civilian.
   A police spokesman, speaking anonymously in keeping with British
custom, said their injuries were not serious.
   The outlawed IRA said in a statement to news media it used a
rocket-propelled grenade.
   The IRA is fighting to oust Britain from Northern Ireland and
unite the predominantly Protestant province with the Roman Catholic
Irish Republic.

<TEXT>
   Federal authorities have told a management
company to stop fining tenants of a low-income housing project $25
for sitting on their front porches.
   The loitering ban imposed several months ago at the Winter Green
Apartments was aimed at reducing drug trafficking, according to the
property manager.
   Under the policy, tenants who were fined three times for lounging
on a porch could face eviction. The fines were included in rent
bills.
   Robert Donovan, housing management director of the U.S.
Department of Housing and Urban Development in Hartford, said
Tuesday that Greater Hartford Realty Management Inc. was advised
last week that the charges were improper and that the company would
have to reimburse tenants for any fines that were collected.
   ``The porch is part of the unit they are renting and there should
not be an additional fee for the use of it,'' said Donovan. He said
he believes the policy violates federal housing rules.
   Ricard Weaver-Bey, general manager of Greater Hartford Realty
Management Inc., on Tuesday said his company had no comment.
   Eric B. Allen, who manages the 32-building, 160-unit complex for
Greater Hartford Realty Management, claimed the policy worked.
   ``We don't have the problems we used to have,'' he said. ``The
dope dealers are standing by, waiting for us to move out.''
   An employee of a community group working with Winter Green
tenants said a few people were fined under the policy, but he didn't
know how many.
   The worker, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said he didn't
think the property manager was still fining tenants but that some
had outstanding rent bills because their rents weren't accepted
without payments for the fines.
   A meeting between tenants and property managers last month over
the loitering ban and other matters dissolved into an shouting match.
   ``It's not right for them. They're violating the bill of
rights,'' tenant Albert J. Farmer, 73, said Tuesday.
   The area is plagued by drug traffic, said police Sgt. Robert
Cagianello. But while he wasn't familiar with the no-loitering
policy, he said, ``It doesn't make any sense. ... The dealers would
pay it. They can afford it.''

   A high school principal has resigned two
weeks after allowing a student to take a college entrance exam in
his son's name.
   Hempstead High School Principal Cliff Gilliard, who maintained he
was trying to make a point about lax security at exam sites,
submitted his letter of resignation Tuesday and was reassigned to a
teaching position.
   Superintendent Bill G. Caesar had said he did not believe
Gilliard's story.
   ``It's funny how one mistake erases all the good you've tried to
do in your life,'' Gilliard wrote in his resignation letter.
``Please let the school board know I'm truly sorry for the
embarrassment I've caused the school district.''
   Gilliard told the Houston Chronicle last week that he wanted to
test what he believed was loose security when he provided a student
with a fake ID to take the Scholastic Aptitude Test.
   The ID bore the name Reginald ``Bo'' Gilliard and the other
student's photo. After the test was completed, Gilliard said, he
wrote the College Board and canceled the results.
   ``They have to understand that this thing is happening every
day,'' said Gilliard, who has been with the district about eight
years. ``It's unfair to the youngsters.''

   Frigid, foggy weather and problems in the Soviet
supply line cost rescuers vital time today in their race to supply
Armenian earthquake survivors with food, medicine and shelter.
   All flights between Yerevan, the Armenian capital, and the
disaster area were halted by rain, snow and fog, and the forecast
was worsening. The weekend is expected to bring more snow and up to
45 mph winds.
   About 5,400 people have been pulled from buildings wrecked in the
Dec. 7 quake, which officials say killed at least 55,000 people,
injured 13,000 and left 500,000 people homeless.
   The survivors ``are almost totally isolated in the cold,'' said
Dr. Bernard Mankikian, who returned to Paris after visiting Spitak,
a city that was destroyed by the quake.
   The communist youth newspaper Komsomolskaya Pravda quoted Capt.
Sergei Bobylev as saying in one village that ``survivors are dying
from cold.''
   Trucks were struggling over snowy mountain passes to bring tents
and blankets to survivors, racing the onset of even worse weather.
   At least two relief planes bound for Armenia, a French Red Cross
plane with medical gear and a Belgian plane were held up in Moscow
early today due to fog in Yerevan.
   At the airport in Spitak, ``a huge quantity of goods desperately
needed in the disaster areas has piled up,'' the Communist Party
newspaper Pravda said.
   It said there was no regular supply of hot food to survivors and
that there were difficulties providing tents to survivors and
rescuers. Villages around Spitak, near the epicenter of the quake,
were among the hardest-hit places.
   George Reid, a spokesman for the Geneva-based League of Red Cross
and Red Crescent societies, said in Yerevan that Soviet officials
had asked for tents to set up housing and emergency medical services
in 48 villages.
   Soviet television on Tuesday night showed rows of tents near the
ruins of the town of Stepanavan, but it said many more were needed.
   ``There are not enough tents,'' the commentator said.
   In its Tuesday editions, Pravda gave the first indications that
looting and other crimes were becoming a problem in the disaster
area, reporting break-in attempts at a jewelry store and apartments
and the slaying of one person.
   It also said helmeted soldiers wearing bulletproof vests had
taken up positions in the streets of Leninakan to keep order.
   Premier Nikolai Ryzhkov, head of earthquake relief, said on
Monday that a ``special situation'' had been declared in Leninakan
and Spitak to give the Soviet army power to maintain peace.
   Michael Hurley, a spokesman for the U.S. Embassy in Moscow, said
today that Soviet rescuers had requested mass quantities of plastic
sheets for use as temporary shelters.
   Medical experts say it is already too late to help the countless
thousands of people who remain trapped under rubble and that relief
efforts must focus on the hurt and homeless. Ryzhkov has pledged to
keep searching for survivors as long as it was possible.
   In Nalbanb, with a prequake population of 4,200 residents have
already buried 2,800 of the dead.
   The reconstruction effort needed in areas flattened by the quake
will cost an estimated $8 billion, Ryzhkov said.
   In Tokyo, Japan has canceled plans to send a 19-member relief
team to earthquake-stricken Armenia after the Soviet republic
dropped its request for the rescue workers, the Japanese Foreign
Ministry said today.
   A ministry official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said
the Armenian government made the request but later dropped it
without giving any reason.
   Japan has donated $8 million to Armenia through the Japan Red
Cross and $813,000 worth of medical goods through the Japan
International Cooperation Agency, the official said.
   A Turkish Foreign Ministry spokesman said today in Ankara that
the Soviet government asked Turkey not to send helicopters to
Armenia to help with earthquake relief efforts because of heavy air
traffic in the area. Turkey announced on Monday that it was ready to
send 20 helicopters and 12 cranes.
   A team from Turkey's Red Crescent Organization traveled to
Armenia Sunday with six trucks carrying 10,000 blankets, medical
supplies and 50 tons of food.

<TEXT>
   A black South African who was denied
enrollment in school until he was 13 has been named a Rhodes scholar.
   Isaac Shongwe, who won the prestigious two-year scholarship at
Oxford University on Monday, never graduated from high school and
entered Wesleyan University without taking a college entrance exam.
He graduated in 1987 as president of his class.
   ``The scholarship is a great honor,'' Shongwe said in an
interview from Johannesburg, where he is working as a management
trainee. ``I got it by working hard, and more of us have to work
hard for education. We have to equip ourselves for the future.''
   Shongwe was born in the South African ghetto of Soweto. He was
raised by his mother until her death when he was 10. Two years
later, his grandparents moved away, leaving him alone in a hut with
no electricity. He paid rent and food bills by working odd jobs.
   When he was finally admitted into school, he had to walk 15 miles
from his home to attend a two-room school. He became the top student
in his class and by age 15 learned English.
   In 1980 at age 17, he was adopted by an Englishman who brought
him to Britain, where he attended a private school. He was
introduced to Steven B. Pfeiffer, a member of Wesleyan's board of
trustees who brought Shongwe to Wesleyan's attention.
   While at Wesleyan, he was captain of the soccer team. Following
his graduation, Shongwe worked at the Riggs National Bank in
Washington before returning to South Africa. He is a management

   The Rhodes scholarships were created by British philanthropist
Cecil Rhodes in 1903 in hopes of preparing Anglo-Saxon men to lead

<HEAD>Number Of Calls From Green River TV Show Exaggerated</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A TV special on the Green River serial murder case
generated only a fraction of the number of tips reported by the
show's organizers, police said.
   Organizers confused the number of telephone calls attempted with
the number of calls actually received, said Lt. Dan Nolan, spokesman
for the task force investigating the deaths of up to 48 young women
from 1982 to 1984.
   During the nationwide broadcast last week of ``Manhunt: A Chance
to End the Nightmare,'' viewers were urged to phone in tips on the
slayings or any other crimes.
   Earlier reports by the show's organizers and police said as many
as 60,000 calls were made to a special phone bank staffed by
investigators. But as of midnight Monday, Nolan said, investigators
had answered no more than 7,660 calls.
   U S West Communications, which handled the calls, said about
86,200 calls had been attempted on the toll-free number.
   Most callers, however, got busy signals, did not get through
because of technical problems or else apparently changed their minds
and ended their calls prematurely, Nolan said.
   Nolan said the 7,660 calls answered by police had yielded about
3,000 credible tips on the Green River murders and other crimes.
   The Green River killer is blamed for the deaths of up to 48
women, many of them prostitutes. Forty are known dead and eight
others disappeared.
   Despite the discrepancies reported in the number of calls, police
still have their hands full. Seattle Detective Myrle Carner said 27
investigators would work full time through the holidays sorting out
the calls.
   ``Obviously, we kind of stepped into uncharted waters on this,
but, quite frankly, it's been overwhelmingly successful,'' he said.

   Yellow fever has killed 220 people in
Nigeria's northeastern Bauchi state, a health official said.
   Dr. Garba Dagauda, Bauchi state commissioner for health, said
Tuesday that he had come to the capital, Lagos, to get more help to
deal with the epidemic.
   More than 65,000 doses of yellow fever vaccine already have been
sent to the region, he said.
   The infectious disease, which causes fever, jaundice and
vomiting, is transmitted by mosquito bites.
   Health authorities had predicted that this year's extremely heavy
rains would lead to outbreaks of diseases borne by insects and
contaminated water.

   A judge agreed that the decal on Glenn
Beasley's pickup was dirty but said it simply didn't violate
Florida's obscene bumper sticker law.
   Collier County Judge Eugene Turner on Tuesday dismissed the case,
one of the first of its kind, because the sticker's language is not
addressed in the law.
   The measure, which went into effect Oct. 1, says a sticker is
obscene if it depicts explicit sexual conduct. Referring to the
four-letter word on Beasley's sticker, Turner said the law makes no
reference to ``excretory functions.''
   Turner said his ruling ``in no way declares the bumper sticker to
be in good taste, socially acceptable, or unoffensive to parents who
attempt to educate their children beyond four-letter words.''
   The judge ruled correctly because the law ``simply does not cover
this bumper sticker in the definition of what is obscene,'' said
American Civil Liberties Union lawyer Francis Sams, who never argued
the constitutional issues of the case.
   Beasley, 25, a mechanic from East Naples, was arrested Oct. 12 on
the bumper sticker violation and numerous other traffic charges.
Under the bumper sticker law, a first offense carries up to two
months in jail and a $500 fine.
   Ironically, it was bumper stickers with the same language as the
decal in question that state Rep. Tom Banjanin said he had in mind
when he sponsored the law.
   ``I think it would be good if it were appealed so that we can get
a (Florida) Supreme Court ruling on how far the law does reach,'' he
said.

<TEXT>
   A group fighting Afghanistan's
Soviet-backed government offered to exchange three Soviet prisoners
held in a northern province for 25 rebel prisoners, a guerrilla-run
news agency said today.
   Ghulam Ghous Amir, of the Afghan News Agency, said the three
Soviet soldiers were captured about a month ago in Baghlan province
by the Hezb-e-Islami guerrillas.
   Amir, a member of the guerrilla group, said Moscow agreed to the
exchange but he could not say when it would take place. There was no
immediate reaction from Soviet officials in Moscow or in the Soviet
media.
   Soviet officials have said 312 Red Army soldiers are missing in
action, but Moslem guerrillas dispute the figure.
   A member of Hezb-e-Islami, who spoke on condition of anonymity,
said his group holds most of the Soviet POWs and has less than 50.
   The Hezb-e-Islami group belongs to a loose U.S.-backed guerrilla
alliance, which is based in Peshawar, Pakistan.
   Guerrilla officials met with officials from the Soviet Embassy in
Pakistan at the end of November, reportedly to complete a
prisoner-exchange deal.
   In early December, Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Yuli Vorontsov
and guerrilla leaders met in Saudi Arabia.
   A guerrilla spokesman, Abdul Hadi, says about 15,000 rebel
fighters or their sympathizers are being held in prisons in the
Afghan capital.
   There has been no independent confirmation of that figure.
   The Soviet Union sent troops and tanks into Afghanistan in 1979
to support Afghanistan's Marxist government.
   In April, the Soviet Union signed documents in Geneva agreeing to
withdraw its troops by Feb. 15, 1988. Soviet officials suspended the
withdrawal last month after complaining that Pakistan and U.S.
officials continue to arm the guerrillas. Nevertheless, the Soviets,
who have withdrawn about half their 100,000 soldiers, said they
would complete the withdrawal on schedule.

   A U.S. Air Force staff sergeant, who allegedly
defected to the Soviet Union in 1968 and later was convicted of
murdering his girlfriend with an ax, has escaped from the custody of
U.S. military police, authorities say.
   Jay W. Wright, 49, a native of New Orleans, escaped from Andrews
Air Force Base police Tuesday in a parking lot at Walter Reed Army
Medical Center in northwest Washington, according to an Air Force
spokesman.
   Wright had been taken to the medical facility for an appointment
with a podiatrist, said Air Force Master Sgt. Rick Fuller.
   Wright allegedly deserted from Barksdale Air Force Base in
Louisiana in February 1968, Fuller said, traveled to the Soviet
Union and made a short propaganda film opposing the Vietnam War.
   The Soviets allowed Wright to go to Sweden after the film was
completed, officials said.
   There he was convicted of murdering his live-in girlfriend with
an ax, according to Fuller, and was confined to a mental institution.
   Swedish officials turned Wright over to U.S. officials in West
Germany this year at his request, the Air Force spokesman said. He
arrived at Andrews on July 22 and was charged three days later with
desertion.
   Officials recommended he be tried by a general court-martial, and
psychiatrists have found him competent to stand trial.

   The verdict against Danny's Bar was in addition to $250,000
Charles McCarthy received in a settlement with Seagram Co. Ltd.
   A bartender was making McCarthy a Russian Roulette, a flaming
mixture of vodka, an Italian liqueur, lemon, sugar and Seagram's
Ronrico 151-proof rum, when flames from the glass ignited the rum
bottle and sent flames shooting at McCarthy, a former roofer, said
Robert L. Spector, McCarthy's attorney.
   McCarthy, 38, was burned on 30 percent of his body, and his
hands, arms, chest and face were scarred, Spector said. The former
roofer hasn't been able to work outdoors since the 1986 accident and
suffers from stress, the attorney said.
   Danny Chichester, the bar's owner, said he stopped serving the
cocktail after the accident.
   The verdict was handed down Monday.

   An earthquake shook northwestern Greece
near the Albanian border today, causing panic but no injuries or

   The Athens Seismological Institute said the quake measured 5 on
the Richter scale and occurred just before noon. It said the
epicenter was 230 miles northwest of Athens near the southern
Albanian coastal town of Sarande.
   ``There was a bit of panic because the earthquake was quite
strong and it shook the entire border area, but we've had no reports
of injuries or damage from any of the villages near the frontier,''
said a police spokesman in the northern town of Ioannina. He spoke

<TEXT>
   Police today detained a Swede with a
history of psychiatric illness and a previous manslaugher conviction
on suspicion of assassinating Prime Minister Olof Palme, officials
and news reports said.
   The Stockholm district court named a defense lawyer for the
41-year-old suspect, a court clerk said, an indication he faced
almost certain arrest after questioning in the Feb. 28, 1986 slaying.
   Palme, a four-term prime minister, was shot to death by a man who
fled down a darkened street and escaped. Palme was walking home
unguarded after seeing a late-night movie with his wife Lisbet, who
was grazed by a second bullet.
   Prosecutor Anders Helin was quoted by the TT news agency as
saying the suspect denied killing the Swedish leader.
   ``The man has been informed he is under suspicion for murder,
something which he denies,'' Helin told the news agency.
   He said the unidentified suspect has not been charged. ``He's
just been brought in for a routine interrogation about the Palme
murder.''
   The detention of a suspect was the first movement in the
investigation after a two-year standstill and despite an $8 million
reward offered by the government.
   Attorney Arne Liljeros went to the courthouse immediately after
he was named defense counsel and was not available for comment, his
office said.
   The suspect was questioned early in the case and admitted he was
close to the scene of the slaying on the night Palme was shot, news
reports said. He was released for lack of evidence.
   He came under scrutiny again during a police review and
reorganization of the probe that included 17,000 tips or leads, the
reports said.
   TT quoted police sources as saying the man had been under
surveillance as a prime suspect for several months. The reports said
Palme's widow would be brought in to try and identify the suspect.
   The reports by TT and two major tabloids, Aftonbladet and
Expressen, said the suspect was from Stockholm and had a criminal
record and a history of psychiatric problems.
   Swedish radio said the suspect had a previous conviction for
stabbing a drug addict to death in 1970 only a few blocks away from
where Palme was killed 16 years later. The Aftonbladet newspaper
said he was a known underground figure who had been treated in a
psychiatric ward for dangerous criminals.
   Only one other person has been arrested in the case since the
assassination and he was released without being charged. Police have
investigated dozens of theories but have failed to provide a motive.
   According to one theory that dominated the investigation for more
than a year, the slaying was carried out by Kurdish terrorists,
possibly under contract from the Iranian regime in revenge for the
cutoff of illegally supplied Swedish weapons.
   Several government commissions have condemned the police handling
of the case, beginning with the failure to seal off the area
immediately after the assassination and close the nation's borders.
   The slaying has had political aftershocks.
   Former Justice Minister Anna-Greta Leijon, a key figure in the
governing Social Democratic party, was forced to resign in June for
supporting an informal investigation that bypassed official
prosecutors and police.
   Palme, 59, was a controversial international figure and a leader
of the world disarmament movement. Sweden and the United States
clashed over his outspoken criticism of the U.S. involvement in
Vietnam.

   A Nigerian cargo plane carrying flowers to
Europe crashed early today near the ancient city of Luxor, killing
all eight crew members and a villager, police said.
   Police Maj. Gen. Salah Niazi of southern Qena Province said the
Boeing 707 plummeted to the ground on the outskirts of the village
of Karm Omran minutes after midnight, destroying three houses and
injuring five people.
   Karm Omran is 30 miles north of antiquities-rich Luxor.
   Niazi said in a telephone interview that the plane was flying
from Dar-es-Salaam, Tanzania, to Brussels, Belgium.
   The pilot tried to land at Cairo for refueling but was unable to
because of bad weather and poor visibility, and the plane was
diverted south to Luxor International Airport, Niazi said.
   ``The pilot told Luxor tower his fuel was running out. He said
his location then was about 30 miles from Luxor,'' Niazi said.
   He said the plane probably crashed after it ran out of fuel. ``I
am saying this because when the plane crashed and hit those houses,
there were no fires,'' he said.
   All eight crew members died in the crash, Niazi said. An elderly
woman from the village was killed, and five villagers were injured.
   In Lagos, Nigeria, a freight company called GAS Air Cargo said it
owned the plane and that its crew included at least three
unidentified foreigners.
   Niazi said he had no information on the crew.

   A mob figure received grocery bags full
of cash and hid money behind a hollowed-out tie rack in his closet
as mastermind of a betting ring that took in up to $2 million a
week, federal authorities charged.
   Vincent Matturro, 66, of Scarsdale was arraigned Tuesday on
charges of running the sports gambling operation, in which bets were
placed at a bar and a barber shop.
   Thirteen others, including a father and son and a husband and
wife, also were charged with gambling offenses carrying up to five
years in prison and $250,000 in fines.
   The ring allegedly took in between $1 million and $2 million a
week in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut.
   Matturro is an associate of the Gambino and Genovese crime
families, authorities said. Headquarters for at least five years was
his million-dollar home, the federal complaint said.
   As much as $250,000 in cash was brought into the house on a
single day, usually in grocery bags, the complaint said.
   In his home were extensive gambling records and $200,000 in cash
hidden in closets, underwear drawers and behind a hollowed-out tie
rack, the complaint said.
   Bail for Matturro was set at $1 million. Bail for the others was
set at between $25,000 and $250,000.

   A Tuscarora Indian who fled to a reservation
after being indicted on charges of taking up to 20 people hostage at
a North Carolina newspaper says he will fight extradition from New
York, where he was arrested.
   ``I think I'd be safer up here,'' Timothy Jacobs said Tuesday,
according to his attorney, Lewis Pitts.
   Jacobs was arrested Tuesday near Oneida, N.Y., after state police
tried to stop him for speeding and he crashed his car into the back
of an empty school bus, authorities said. No one was hurt, said Sgt.
Josephine Townsend.
   North Carolina authorities said extradition proceedings would
begin immediately.
   Pitts said he would fight extradition ``tooth and nail.'' He said
he hoped to get Jacobs released on bail and returned to the Onondaga
Indian reservation south of Syracuse, where police said Jacobs had
lived since last week.
   Jacobs, 20, was indicted Dec. 6 in the takeover in February at
The Robesonian newspaper in Lumberton. Eddie Hatcher, 31, who was
indicted on the same charges, was arrested the day the indictments
were returned.
   A jury acquitted the two Tuscarora Indians Oct. 14 of federal
hostage-taking and firearms charges, despite their admission that
they used two sawed-off shotguns to take over the newspaper office
for 10 hours.
   During the trial, they argued they had to take over the newspaper
to save their lives because of evidence they had of official
corruption in Robeson County and of law enforcement involvement in
drug trafficking.
   The siege ended after Gov. Jim Martin agreed to form a task force
to investigate their allegations.
   Later, however, the task force said there was little evidence to
substantiate their charges.

<TEXT>
   The World Food Program today announced that it gave
emergency aid to at least 14.5 million people in 31 developing
countries during 1988, and its director said the forecast for 1989
is bleak.
   The U.N. agency's director, James Ingram, said this year may be
remembered ``as the year of disasters.''
   ``Never before in WFP's history did we have to respond to so many
sudden calamities, primarily hurricanes and typhoons but also
devastating floods in all parts of the world,'' he said.
   The agency said the amount of emergency food aid delivered to
people in 1988 is expected to surpass the 820,000 tons delivered in
1987, the largest amount previously provided in its 25-year history.
   It said major operations in 1988 centered on large numbers of
refugees and displaced people in Pakistan, Iran, Malawi, Somalia and
Ethiopia.
   The agency said its assistance in 1988 reached 8.5 million of the
world's estimated 13 million refugees.
   The statistics do not include assistance to victims of the Dec. 7
earthquake in Soviet Armenia.
   Program officials also said they do not expect the demand for
emergency food aid to decline in 1989.
   Food pledged for 1989 already has been committed to the agency's
continuing emergency situations, it said.
   ``This past year has strained the program's resources to the
limit and the forecast for 1989 is bleak,'' Ingram said. ``Donor
governments must now realize the urgency of the situation and
respond with food pledges.''

<TEXT>
   West Germany's No. 2 Defense Ministry
official said today he is resigning because of a row with his boss
over a decision to suspend military training flights following the
crash of a U.S. attack jet.
   The clash between Defense Minister Rupert Scholz and his chief
deputy, Peter Kurt Wuerzbach, occurred after the crash of a U.S. Air
Force jet in a residential neighborhood in the city of Remscheid
last week.
   The crash killed five civilians and the American pilot and
renewed a public outcry over military training flights in West
Germany's crowded skies.
   Wuerzbach went on national television shortly after Thursday's
accident and announced the suspension of all West German military
training flights below 10,700 feet until the end of the year.
   His decision came at a time when Scholz was visiting the United
States. West German newspaper reports said Wuerzbach's decision was
made over the objection of Scholz, and his resignation was widely
expected.
   West Germany's NATO allies have also suspended tactical training
flights until Jan. 2 after the Remscheid accident.
   Wuerzbach, whose official title is parliamentary undersecretary
for defense, announced his resignation at the annual meeting of West
German military officers in Wuerzburg.
   Wuerzbach gave reporters the contents of his resignation letter
to Scholz, in which he said he no longer had confidence in his boss.

<TEXT>
   Inquiring minds want to know: who will buy
The National Enquirer, the supermarket tabloid whose mix of
celebrity gossip and reports of bizarre happenings has made it the
nation's best-selling weekly?
   The Enquirer, which grew from a small New York tabloid to a
checkout line fixture snapped up by 4.5 million readers each week,
is up for sale following the death of publisher Generoso Pope Jr.
   Pope, 61, died of a heart attack Oct. 2.
   The terms of Pope's trust allow for the Enquirer and its sister
tabloid, the Weekly World News, to be sold when practical, said
Jerome S. Traum, one of three trustees for the estate.
   Traum wouldn't reveal their asking price, but The Wall Street
Journal quoted an adviser to London media mogul Robert Maxwell as
saying that the Enquirer was ``a $400 million newspaper.''
   Traum said many people have expressed interest in the Enquirer,
but no negotiations had begun by Tuesday. ``We expect that all the
major (media) players will probably be involved in the selection of
the final purchaser,'' he said.
   Newspaper industry analyst Edward Atorino of Smith, Barney in New
York said the Enquirer's scandal-sheet image most likely would
discourage major media companies from bidding.
   The Enquirer has flourished despite being the target of several
celebrity libel suits, including an $800,000 judgment won by
comedian-actress Carol Burnett.
   Following Pope's death, the Enquirer's president and editor, Iain
Calder, was named chairman of GP Group Inc., which owns the
tabloids. The other trustees are Peter P. Peterson, a New York
investment banker, and Citibank.

   A Cuban exile charged with attempting to hijack a
TWA jetliner to Havana was having a hard time making ends meet here
as a cook and wanted to ``run away'' to his native land, a co-worker
says.
   An air-piracy warrant was issued Tuesday for Felix Sanchez
Rodriguez, who is being held in the Turks and Caicos Islands, the
FBI said.
   Sanchez, 26, was accused of passing a flight attendant a note
threatening to blow up the plane Sunday during a flight from San
Juan, Puerto Rico, to Miami.
   The plane carrying 128 people landed safely at Grand Turk Island,
where police convinced Sanchez he was in Cuba and arrested him, said
FBI spokesman Paul Miller.
   Sanchez was in Puerto Rico to see his estranged wife and two baby
daughters, whom he was trying to support, co-worker Pedro Garcia
told the Miami News.
   ``Felix could not make ends meet with the money he earned as a
luncheon cook, and he was beginning to feel that he was being choked
by a very short rope,'' said Garcia. ``The only thing Felix wanted
was to run away and be with his father and his twin brother. He
thought that was the solution.''
   The FBI said Sanchez should be extradited because the flight was
within U.S. jurisdiction during the attempted hijacking.
   If convicted, Sanchez could receive up to 20 years in prison.
   Garcia said Sanchez, who came to the U.S. in the 1980 Mariel
boatlift, went to Puerto Rico to patch things up with his wife.
   ``I guess it just didn't work,'' Garcia said. ``It's so sad.''
   It was the first attempted hijacking on a domestic flight since
1986, when a man commandeered a commuter jet en route to Medford,
Ore., and demanded to go to Phoenix. That plane landed at Hillsboro,
Ore., and the hijacker was arrested.

   Ten people were arrested at a TV station in
a protest against a ``Midnight Caller'' episode depicting a bisexual
knowingly spreading the AIDS virus.
   The NBC drama aired Tuesday night, following script changes and
several months of negotiations between the producer and a coalition
of AIDS groups.
   ``Nobody can deny that the producers are pandering to the lowest
common denominator _ they're exploiting the epidemic and the fear
around the epidemic,'' said Terry Beswick, a member of the AIDS
Coalition to Unleash Power, or ACT-UP.
   The episode prompted protests at NBC affiliates in Philadelphia
and San Francisco, where the program is filmed.
   About 250 people chanting ``Education, not sensationalism,''
demonstrated outside KRON-TV here. Ten people were arrested after
going into the lobby, locking arms and refusing to leave, police
said.
   In Philadelphia, ACT-UP members demonstrated for an hour at
KYW-TV. The group complained in a statement of the ``inciteful way
in which the show's character with AIDS is depicted.''
   Lorimar Productions publicist Barry Stagg defended the TV show as
``powerful and effective.''
   ``We think that a lot of good will come out of this episode and
that people will think more carefully about responsible sex,'' Stagg
said.
   ``This episode of `Midnight Caller' is not perfect, but we find
nothing in it that warrants our pre-emption,'' said KRON president
and general manager Amy McCombs. ``We do feel it raises questions
and issues that need to be addressed further.''

<HEAD>Judges Ask AIDS-Infected Inmates to Enter Pleas By Phone</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BIRMINGHAM, Ala. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Three judges have asked defendants
infected with the AIDS virus to enter their pleas by telephone, a
precaution advocates for AIDS victims say is unnecessary and
discriminatory.
   The Jefferson County judges said their actions were designed to
safeguard their staffs from the deadly disease and did not violate
defendants' rights.
   But David Gespass, an attorney for one of the defendants, said,
``Everyone has a right to face their accusers and the right to be
present in a court to be sentenced.''
   Judges Mike McCormick, O.L. ``Pete'' Johnson and Jack Montgomery
said they simply requested that AIDS-infected defendants in at least
three cases waive their right to appear in court, and all did so.
   The defendants feel they don't have a choice, however, fearing
they might anger the judge by refusing, Gespass said. The three
defendants pleaded guilty.
   McCormick and Johnson said their bailiffs don't want to handle
the prisoners for fear of contracting the AIDS virus. Montgomery
said he doesn't want himself or the people in his courtroom exposed
to defendants with the virus.
   The bailiffs and the judges were concerned about a violent
defendant, who could bite or bleed in a fight, McCormick said.
   Dr. Michael Saag, an AIDS specialist at University Hospital, said
it is very unlikely that a person could become infected with the
AIDS virus through a bite or during a fight.
   On April 29, McCormick used a telephone hookup to listen to the
guilty plea of John Louis O'Neal on a burglary charge, said Harry J.
Blalock, the lawyer who represented O'Neal at the time. McCormick
put him on probation.
   ``McCormick told me he didn't want him in there because he had
AIDS,'' Blalock said. ``What can I say? He (O'Neal) was out on bond;
there wasn't any reason he couldn't be there.''
   O'Neal, 30, said he wanted to go to court like anyone else. ``My
lawyer told me to do it over the phone because he didn't want to
make him (the judge) mad,'' said O'Neal in an interview with the
Birmingham Post-Herald.
   McCormick said the main reason he asked that O'Neal not be
brought to court ``was that my bailiffs didn't want to handle him.''
   Gespass, O'Neal's current attorney, has filed a petition to
overturn O'Neal's convictions because his client was not in court to
give his plea or to be sentenced.
   Charles Collins, a board member of the Birmingham AIDS Outreach,
a non-profit group that assists AIDS victims, said the judges'
actions make it difficult to educate people on the facts of the
disease.
   ``If a person in authority disregards our national health
officials, it makes it more difficult to convince the general public
not to discriminate against AIDS patients,'' he said.

   The army today blew up the home of a Palestinian
shepherd accused of killing two Israelis in the occupied West Bank.
   Jewish settlement leaders called on Israeli citizens to be
quicker to use firearms in clashes with Palestinians.
   The army said the shepherd bludgeoned a settler to death with a
rock Tuesday, then stole the dead man's rifle and killed a soldier
before being shot to death by Israeli troops.
   The violence occurred as PLO leader Yasser Arafat offered a new
Palestine Liberation Organization peace initiative to the U.N.
General Assembly in Geneva. Israeli leaders, including Prime
Minister Yitzhak Shamir, rejected the offer as insufficient and
dated.
   The settler's widow, Leah Pereg, called today for more Jewish
settlements in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   ``We will continue to build, to bring new homes and industry here
and develop the place _ that was his dream,'' Mrs. Pereg said on
Israel radio.
   Mrs. Pereg, who has three children and is pregnant with a fourth,
said: ``My children and I will continue to live here and build the
place ... even if they (the Arabs) want blood.''
   The army clamped a curfew on the shepherd's village of Burin near
the religious Jewish settlement of Berakha and the city of Nablus.
Israel routinely demolishes the homes of suspected guerrillas.
   Also today, soldiers shot and wounded an 18-year-old Palestinian
in the Bureij refugee camp in the Gaza Strip, Arab reports and
hospital officials said. The army said it was checking the report.
   The incident occurred shortly after the army lifted a curfew that
had confined 650,000 Gazans to their homes during Arafat's address.
   Gazans defied army orders, setting off fireworks and shouting
from balconies during and after the PLO leader's speech.
   In Nablus, masked youths filled the streets after the address,
chanting pro-PLO slogans as they danced and waved pictures of Arafat.
   The army said the Palestinian shepherd, identified by
Palestinians as Hamdan Najjar, 25, crushed the skull of settler
Yaakov Pereg with a rock. Najjar then stole the dead settler's
machine gun and shot at a passing military patrol, killing
41-year-old reserve soldier Arthur Herstog, the army said.
   The shepherd's family had been involved in a long-running land
dispute with the settlement of Berakha, and the clash took place on
a piece of land expropriated by the Jewish settlement, Israeli radio
said.
   Villagers from Burin had been fighting the expropriation in
court, the Jerusalem Post newspaper reported. Pereg was in charge of
supervising the disputed area and was patrolling it when the attack
took place.
   However, army commanders said it was unclear if the land dispute
was the motive for the slaying.
   Dozens of settlers demonstrated outside Prime Minister Yitzhak
Shamir's home late Tuesday, shouting, ``Jewish blood is not cheap.''
   Uri Ariel, general secretary of the Judea and Samaria Council for
Jewish settlement, called on Israelis living and traveling in the
area to be quicker to draw weapons. Judea and Samaria are the
Biblical names for the West Bank.
   ``I am telling all citizens who live in Judea and Samaria, as
well as those traveling in the area, that it is preferable to sit in
jail than in Beit Levinstein,'' a rehabilitation center for wounded
soldiers, Ariel said.
   He called on the heads of the military and defense establishment
to resign if they could not restore order in the occupied
territories, where Palestinians have been revolting against Israeli
rule for over a year.
   The latest deaths raised to 13 the number of Israelis killed in
the uprising. At least 323 Palestinians also have died.
   Throughout the uprising, there have been frequent clashes between
stone-throwing Palestinians and Jewish settlers, most of whom are
armed for self-defense.
   Last month, U.S.-born settler Israel Zeev was convicted of
manslaughter in the killing of an Palestinian shepherd who brought
sheep to graze near the West Bank settlement of Shilo where Zeev was
a guard.
   About 70,000 Jewish settlers live in more than 130 settlements in
the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip where 1.5 million Palestinians
live.

   The defense went on the offensive today at the
divorce-fixing trial of former Miss America Bess Myerson, telling
jurors that the prosecution presented an ``editorialized'' version
of the facts.
   After a daylong summation Tuesday by Assistant U.S. Attorney
Stuart Abrams, lawyers for Miss Myerson and her two co-defendants
began their closing arguments to the federal jury today.
   Jay Goldberg, attorney for Miss Myerson's lover, Carl ``Andy''
Capasso, said Abrams ``steered clear'' of discussing testimony and
instead presented an ``an incomplete picture'' in its summation and
an ``editorialized'' version of the facts.
   Goldberg promised jurors ``I'll give you chapter and verse'' of
the testimony of government witnesses.
   Miss Myerson, the city's one-time cultural affairs commissioner,
is accused of trying to influence former state Supreme Court Justice
Hortense Gabel, who was making alimony rulings in the divorce of
Capasso, Miss Myerson's lover.
   ``Their motives were greed and vengeance,'' Abrams said of Miss
Myerson, 64, and Capasso, 43, once a major city sewer contractor.
   In exchange for the cut Mrs. Gabel made in Capasso's support
payments to his estranged wife, Nancy, prosecutors charge, Miss
Myerson gave a $19,000-a-year city job to the judge's daughter,
Sukhreet Gabel.
   At issue, Abrams told the jury of six men and six women, is
``whether a city commissioner can use the public payroll as a
private little kitty.''
   Miss Myerson, Capasso and the 75-year-old former judge are
charged with conspiracy, fraud and bribe-related charges. Miss
Myerson, who was Miss America 1945, is also charged with obstruction
of justice.
   Miss Myerson faces up to 30 years in prison if convicted of all
charges. Her co-defendants could receive up to 25 years.
   ``Ladies and gentlemen, what did Bess Myerson think she was doing
when she hired Sukhreet Gabel?'' asked Abrams, his voice rising to a
shout.
   ``She knew exactly what she was doing,'' said the prosecutor, as
his voice fell to a whisper. ``She was trying to buy justice.''
   Abrams conceded that the testimony of the prosecution's star
witness, Miss Gabel, against her mother was ``not an easy thing'' to
watch. But he laid the blame on Miss Myerson and Capasso for
deciding ``this was the way to influence Justice Gabel, through her
daughter.''

   An undercover drug deal ended in the slaying of a
17-year police veteran, the fifth officer to die in the bloodiest
year in department history.
   A suspected drug dealer also was killed and two other suspects
were seriously wounded in the shootout Tuesday night, police said.
   Officer Lawrence R. Cadena, 43, was shot with an assault rifle,
possibly an automatic weapon, as he bought cocaine in a convenience
store parking lot, police said.
   Cadena, who joined the force in 1971 and had been a narcotics
officer since 1986, died at Baylor University Medical Center from
wounds to the chest, abdomen and arms, said Sgt. Jim Chandler.
   Police said they believe the shooting erupted after the suspected
dealers attempted to rob the plainclothes officer. Witnesses
reported hearing up to 11 shots.
   Cadena was the fifth Dallas officer shot to death this year.
Three died in the line of duty, more than in any other year; two
were killed while moonlighting on security jobs.
   A drug suspect, Hector Jacomino, 34, died at Parkland Memorial
Hospital, emergency room supervisor Randy Blanchard said.
   Two other suspects, Javier Surez, 17, and Fernando Fernandez, 19,
were in critical and serious condition respectively, Blanchard said.
   Police arrested two other suspects at a nearby apartment early
today, police spokesman Ed Spencer said. Their names were not
released.
   ``It is my understanding that it was a buy-bust situation _ a
drug buy _ and we had more than one officer at the scene,'' said
Police Chief Mack Vines. ``Instead of the drug deal reaching
fruition, they were hijacked ... shots were exchanged and our
officer was fatally wounded.''
   Vines said other officers were in the area as backup for the
planned drug bust but did not participate in the shootings.
   ``I heard three gunshots and then I saw a guy leaning on a
Camaro. Three people were lying on the ground,'' said David Zwaska,
32 of Dallas. ``I was just passing by here when I heard the shots.''
   Ali Dahii, another witness, said he heard up to 11 shots fired
while he used a pay telephone near the convenience store.
   Wan Kwak, owner of a food store across the street, said he heard
the shots and then ran to door of his store to see the gunfight.
   ``Right up until that time, they fight each other with big guns
right out on the street,'' said Kwak, 57. ``When I looked over on
the street, people were running into each other and they were
shooting at each other.''

<TEXT>
   The operating rate at U.S. factories, mines and
utilities in November rose to the highest level in nine years, the
government said today in a report likely to heighten concern about
inflation.
   The Federal Reserve Board said the use of industrial capacity
rose 0.2 percentage points to 84.2 percent last month, the highest
since 84.3 percent in November 1979. It was the seventh increase in
eight months.
   As capacity use edges toward 85 percent, economists fear
factories will have trouble producing enough goods to meet demand,
leading to shortages and price increases.
   But White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said the figures were
``good for steady growth in the economy.''
   In an accompanying report, the Federal Reserve said industrial
production climbed a brisk 0.5 percent in November following an
identical 0.5 percent rise in October.
   The Fed's industrial production index now stands at 139.9 percent
of its 1977 base, reflecting gains in light truck manufacturing and
production of equipment for businesses.
   The jumps in capacity use and the production index were in line
with economists' expectations. Most government statistics have
portrayed a robust economy in October and November, particularly in
the manufacturing sector, which has been bolstered by strong export
sales caused by the lower value of the dollar, which makes U.S.
goods more affordable on overseas markets.

   At manufacturing plants, the operating rate climbed to 84.5
percent last month, up from 84.3 percent in October. Producers of
both durable goods _ ``big ticket'' items ranging from bicycles to
battleships _ and non-durable goods reported higher rates.
   The rate at durable goods plants was 83.1 percent in November, up
from 82.9 percent. Non-durable goods producers recorded a 0.1
percentage point gain to 86.5 percent.
   The Fed said the operating rate for primary metals industries
jumped to 92.4 percent, the highest since December 1978. Most of the
increase was attributed to increases at steel mills.
   Use of motor vehicle and parts manufacturing capacity rose for
the fourth consecutive month to 85.4 percent, reflecting gains in
light truck production. Automobile plants, a subcategory, slipped to
76.7 percent, down from 77.0 percent.
   The operating rate at utilities was 81.0 percent in November, up
from 80.8 percent. It had hit a peak for the year in August of 83.9
percent because of a surge in electricity use for air conditioning.
   In the mining sector, which includes oil and gas drilling, the
operating rate increased to 82.2 percent last month. It was 81.6
percent in October.
   The Federal Reserve's production index has not declined since
September 1987, a reflection of the export-driven manufacturing
boom. A related surge in spending for capital equipment to expand
and modernize factories has accompanied the boom.
   Production in the manufacturing sector rose 0.5 percent in
November, following an even stronger 0.6 percent gain in October.
The Fed said automobiles were assembled at an annual rate of 7.6
million units, down slightly from October.
   But production of business equipment rose 0.4 percent following a
flat month in October and stood 8.8 percent higher than a year ago.
   Output at mines, which includes oil and gas drilling, rose 0.6
percent in November after three consecutive declines. Production at
utilities increased 0.4 percent, on top of a 0.6 percent jump in
October.
   Total output at factories, mines and utilities was 5.1 percent
higher than a year ago.

   A judge today set bail at $20,000 cash
for a man accused of raping a woman at knifepoint in an area where
the bodies of six victims of an apparent serial killer have been
discovered.
   Neil Anderson, 35, was arrested Tuesday at his home and charged
with aggravated rape, kidnapping, assault and battery in a 1987
attack along Interstate 195 in Dartmouth.
   Defense and prosecution attorneys stressed at a hearing before
District Judge John A. Markey today that Anderson should not be
connected with the deaths of six women whose bodies have been found
since July along highways near here.
   ``This is a case that involves aggravated rape, kidnapping and
assault and battery. And that's all it involved,'' Assistant
District Attorney Raymond E. Veary said.
   Public Defender James M. Quinn said, ``Here's a man that's
presumed innocent. He has been charged with only one crime. I think
that to try to link that to any other events is very unfair. ...
He's been charged with one crime, he's pleaded not guilty, and he
should be presumed innocent.''
   Raymond Veary, an assistant district attorney in Bristol County,
declined to comment on a report by WBZ-TV in Boston that the man was
a suspect in the highway killings.
   The Boston Herald today also quoted unidentified sources who said
Anderson was considered a suspect. ``He would go from a list of
loose suspects to the top of the list,'' said a source the newspaper
described as close to the investigation.
   ``We're not narrowing down our scope at all,'' a police source
told the Standard-Times of New Bedford.
   ``Anybody who is charged with something like that, of course
they're suspects,'' the newspaper quoted another source as saying.
``To say he's the one, we don't know that.''
   The partially clad skeletons of the six women have been found
since July in a six- to eight-mile radius along I-195 and Route 140
in Dartmouth and Freetown.
   District Attorney Ronald A. Pina has said he believed the six
killings were likely the victims of the same killer or killers and
that the victims all had ties to New Bedford's Weld Square
neighborhood, known for prostitution and drugs.
   Anderson lived with his mother and grandmother about 10 blocks
from the Weld Square area, the Boston Herald reported.
   The television station reported that Anderson's alleged rape
victim is a former prostitute, but Veary declined to confirm or deny
the report.
   State police dogs and a specially trained dog from Connecticut
have been searching for more victims in woods outside of New
Bedford, where the bodies have been found.

   South Korea's largest shipyard remained
closed for the third straight day Wednesday as about 18,000 workers
continued striking for more benefits and the reinstatement of fired
labor union leaders.
   A union leader said negotiations would continue Wednesday.
   Hyundai Heavy Industries Co., in the southeastern city of Ulsan,
closed Monday when most of its 19,500 workers went on strike.
   Company officials said the workers are demanding their yearly
bonus be increased from five times to six times their monthly pay.
They also demand the company hire back several union leaders who
were fired during protests last year.
   The shipyard is expected to lose $120 million this year, Hyundai
officials said.

   The trade deficit declined 3.1 percent in October from $10.67
billion to $10.35 billion. The improvement came from a 1.7 percent
drop in imports, which declined to $38.02 billion, on a seasonally
adjusted basis. That offset a 1.1 percent drop in U.S. exports, to
$27.67 billion.
   Through October, the merchandise trade deficit was at an annual
rate of $136.1 billion, 20 percent below the record $170.3 billion
last year.
   The government reported Tuesday that the deficit in the current
account fell to $30.89 billion in the third quarter. The current
account adds the value of investments and services to that of goods

<HEAD>FACTORY USE:</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   The operating rate at U.S. factories, mines and utilities rose
0.2 percentage point in October to 84.2 percent, its highest level
in nine years. That is likely to intensify concern about inflation.
As capacity use nears 85 percent economists fear factories will have
trouble producing enough goods to meet demand, leading to shortages
and price increases.

<HEAD>BUSINESS INVENTORIES:</HEAD>

   Business inventories on shelves and backlots rose a modest $1.2
billion, or 0.2 percent, in October to a seasonally adjusted $751.4
billion, while sales jumped a strong $6 billion, or 1.2 percent, to
$501.5 billion.
   Inventory accumulation was led by a 0.6 percent increase at the
manufacturing level; wholesale inventories edged up 0.3 percent,
while retail inventories, which had been rising in earlier months,
fell by 0.7 percent.
   In sales, retailers posted a strong gain of 1.6 percent while
wholesalers showed a 1.9 percent increase.

<HEAD>Sources Say CBS Outbids NBC For Baseball Rights</HEAD>

   CBS today won exclusive network rights to
televise major league baseball with a $1 billion offer that shocked
NBC, which has prided itself on its baseball coverage since 1947.
   The four-year contract allows CBS to televise the World Series,
the All-Star Game, the playoffs in both leagues and a 12-game
regular-season package beginning in 1990, industry sources said.
   The network has not televised big league baseball since the
mid-1960s, while NBC and ABC shared TV rights since 1975.
   CBS was stunned by NBC last month when it lost the U.S. TV rights
to the 1992 Barcelona Olympics. NBC won with a bid of $401 million,
topping CBS's offer by $40 million.
   Baseball is expected to award a cable package next month for
between $75 million and $100 million per year. Turner Broadcasting
System's TNT Network, ESPN and SportsChannel America are competing
for the package. Cable is expected to show four or five games a week.
   NBC had been expected to retain the major part of baseball's
network package. ABC had complained of heavy losses on its Monday
night package and will move its games to Thursday in 1989.
   Thep in
imports, which declined to $38.02 billion, on a seasonally adjusted
basis.
   This decline offset a smaller 1.1 percent drop in U.S. exports,
which edged down to $27.67 billion.
   Even with the small setback in exports, U.S. overseas sales
remained near record high levels. For the first 10 months of this
year, export sales are running 28.3 percent above the same period in
1987.
   This remarkable surge in export sales has been responsible for
almost half of America's overall economic growth this year as
American manufacturers have hired workers and stepped up output to
meet demand.
   Through October, the overall merchendise trade deficit has been
running at an annual rate of $136.1 billion, 20 percent below the
all-time high imbalance of $170.3 billion recorded last year.
   President-elect Bush cited this improvement during the
presidential campaign as proof that the Reagan administration's
policies of solving the country's trade woes were working.
   The administration launched an effort in September 1985 to drive
the value of the dollar lower to make American goods more
competitive on overseas markets while driving up the price of
imports.
   The effort took far longer to bear fruit than many had expected
and has to this day failed to halt the steady increase in imports,
which are running 8.3 percent higher so far this year over 1987.
   The $10.35 billion October deficit was the lowest since a $9.47
billion July imbalance. That had been the smallest deficit since
December 1984.
   The trade report, U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter said,
was ``good news on which to close out 1988. He added that the
deficit was now falling ``at a satisfactory pace.''
   Today's good news on trade followed a report Tuesday showing that
the deficit in the broadest measure of trade, the current account,
fell to $30.89 billion in the July-September quarter, the lowest
level in three years.
   The current account method adds the value of investments and
services to the value of goods reflected in today's report.
   Many economists are worried that despite the dramatic declines in
the trade deficit this year, the improvement is in danger of
stalling next year, a development that could push the country into a
recession.
   Some economists contend that the dollar must fall further to make
U.S. goods even more competitive and dampen Americans' appetite for
imports. Other analysts are urging the Bush administrative to waste
no time in launching an aggressive effort to open more foreign
markets to American products.
   The October report is likely to provide ammunition to these
critics because of a 34.1 percent jump in the trade deficit with
Japan. The trade imbalance with Japan, the largest with any country,
surged to $5.5 billion in October, the highest it has been in a year.
   The deficit with Taiwan was unchanged at $1.4 billion while the
deficit with Western Europe rose to $1.1 billion, $200 million
higher than in October.
   The deficits with individual countries are not adjusted to take
into account normal monthly variations in trade flows. Before the
seasonal adjustment, the overall deficit would have been $11.75
billion, reflecting the fact that October is a big import month as
retailers stock up for the Christmas season.

   A police official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said 18
Thai women in Japan on expired tourist visas were hired as hostesses
at Sato's night club and forced into prostitution.
   The three Japanese had made $407,000 this year by taking
commissions of $81 from the women's pay of $244 to $407 for each
service, the official said.
   Six Taiwanese women who were hired in July earned $203,000 from
prostitution, the police said.
   The maximum penalty for violating anti-prostitution laws in Japan
is two years in prison.

<TEXT>
   Gov. Rose Mofford has mailed 5,000 holiday cards
depicting herself as a saucy Goddess of Liberty, the winged statue
atop the Capitol dome.
   The card features a smiling caricature of the 65-year-old
beehive-coiffed Democrat poking a bare leg from a white Roman toga
slit up the side.
   ``Rose liked it. I showed a little knee,'' said Sherman Goodrich,
the San Diego artist who has been designing Mrs. Mofford's cards for
10 years and said did the latest one as a favor to her. ``She's a
sexy lady. What the hell?''
   He said the idea for Winged Victory was the governor's.
   The message inside the card reads: ``Seasons greetings, and my
heartfelt thanks for your help and trust in this my first year as
governor of the great state of Arizona.''
   The cards were sent to ``everyone on her massive Rolodex,'' as
well as to the state's newspapers and nation's governors, said
spokesman Vada Manager. Mrs. Mofford paid for the cards, which
required 35 cents postage, Manager said.
   Assuming a historical disguise is nothing new for Mrs. Mofford,
said Goodrich.
   ``I've depicted her as Uncle Sam. I've depicted her as Santa
Claus. I've depicted her as the Statue of Liberty,'' Goodrich said
Tuesday. ``I did her as Mae West one time, which is perfect.''
   ``I thought it was most attractive,'' said state Sen. Lela
Alston, a Democrat. ``This was a particularly delightful and
sensitive card.''
   Added Republican Rep. Jim Hartegen, ``I think they're kind of
unique in a way _ they're Rose.''

   The protesters demanded the right to visit political prisoners
and an international delegation to check the condition of the

   The legislature has given the president
the power to declare a state of insurgency for up to six months in
any part of the country, it was reported Wednesday.
   The law passed Tuesday by the National Resistance Council, which
is not an elected body, defined insurgency as ``open and active
revolt against the government and its organs,'' according to the New
Vision newspaper.
   The report said people suspected of insurgency would be tried
``within a reasonable time'' instead of being held indefinitely.
   Attorney General Joseph Mulenga said Ugandan law has not until
now provided for speedy trial. He cited the case of 800 rebels
captured betweeen August and September 1986 who were in prison
indefinitely because the soldiers who were to testify against them
were fighting other rebels.
   President Yoweri Museveni, who has waged a 5-year-old civil war
against forces led by former President Milton Obote, took power in a
February 1986 military coup against an army officer who had ousted
Obote.

<TEXT>
   A woman faces 20 years in prison for
force-feeding her 4-year-old daughter a fatal dose of salt as
punishment for stealing sugar.
   Charges against the woman's husband, who also was accused of
murder, were dismissed by the judge Tuesday.
   ``Jack Riggs is going to have to live with his conscience,''
Commonwealth's Attorney Skip Burkart said after Beth Michelle Riggs
was convicted of murder in the May 17 death of Heather Riggs, who
suffered heart failure caused by the salt.
   Burkart said he probably will seek the maximum prison term at
sentencing in February.
   Mrs. Riggs, 36, hoped to give her daughter a bad taste to stop
her from eating sugar and gave the 26-pound child more than enough
salt to kill a 170-pound adult, according to testimony.
   Witnesses described how a three-inch lump of salt in her adoptive
daughter's stomach was observed through X-rays to be shrinking as
the salt dissolved into her comatose body and her heart failed.
   ``There's no indication she intended to hurt that child,'' said
defense attorney James Swanson. ``We're dealing with table salt.
We're dealing with a substance available on every table in the
country. She had no idea of the lethal effect.''
   Mrs. Riggs entered a plea agreement that called for her to be
convicted of either second-degree murder or involuntary
manslaughter. After hearing the evidence, Judge Kenneth Trabue
convicted Mrs. Riggs of the more serious offense.
   Thomas Blaylock, the father's lawyer, successfully argued that
Riggs had nothing to do with the crime and that he immediately took
his daughter to the hospital after telephoning a poison hotline.
   Burkart said Heather Riggs was routinely locked in her room so
she could not get out and eat large quantities of sweets.

   Ever wonder what happens to teddy bears
after they stop getting hugs?
   Some get stuffed in attic trunks. Others simply sit in playrooms
and sulk. And a goodly number get thrown away.
   Now, thousand of teddy bears are getting back into the snuggle
business thanks to a local program that may be expanded nationwide
within a year.
   A cleaning company has volunteered to rescue the teddy bears and
other stuffed animals donated to the San Francisco Firefighters Toy
Program that were once considered too stained, tattered or tired to
pass along to needy children for Christmas.
   The workers at Coit Drapery, Carpet & Upholstery Cleaners, who
last year volunteered to clean blankets and sleeping bags for the
homeless, this year offered to clean and repair stuffed animals for
needy kids.
   The bears and their buddies are given a stitch or two if needed,
then they get scrubbed by hand. Finally, they're dried and their fur
is fluffed.
   The result is stunning: The program, which gave away 9,500 toys
last Christmas, will give away about 13,000 this year.
   ``We've always accepted the stuffed animals, but this is the
first year we've been able to give them all out,'' said Dorothy
Teupal, an assistant chairperson of the campaign. She said the Coit
employees' efforts ``at least trip day, although study after study has
pointed out
Pentagon flaws, little progress has been made in correcting the
situation. ...
   President-elect Bush says the job of improving military
purchasing policies is one of his top goals.
   Let's hope so. The Pentagon would hardly notice tighter budgets

   The incoming administration will soon learn that some of the
major problems facing this country before the presidential election
_ such as Gen. Manuel Noriega of Panama _ did not go away and still
must be dealt with in a decisive manner.
   The Reagan administration never did come to grips with Gen.
Noriega, who had been indicted by the United States for taking
bribes to convert his country into a safe haven for the notorious
Colombian drug cartel.
   The Senate Foreign Relations subcommittee had produced massive
evidence of Gen. Noriega's corruption and dealings with foes of the
United States. ...
   Gen. Noriega continues to demand that the U.S. pull out its
military forces in the area.
   The new administration should make it clear from the very start
that the U.S. is there to stay because the security situation
demands it. And, at no cost, should we allow the Panama Canal to
fall into the control of foreign forces.

   The Rapid City (S.D.) Journal on the B-1 bomber crashes:
   Flying involves some risk. That is particularly true with
military aircraft.
   Last month western South Dakota was stunned when one of the
nation's newest warplanes, a B-1 bomber from Ellsworth Air Force
Base, crashed short of the runway and was destroyed. The crash
closely followed another in Texas.
   Because of the controversial nature of the B-1, the two incidents
together raised questions about whether the airplane was inherently
flawed.
   The B-1 has shortcomings. But it would be unfair at this point to
say the airplane is not flightworthy.
   Perhaps it was just that the local accident caused us to pay more
attenton, but since then it has been clear that military aircraft of
all types crash at a rate that would close down commercial aviation.

   Instead of shaking fists and shouted abuse, listeners were

   Mikhail Gorbachev is showing once again what we already know:
That in the modern craft of public diplomacy, he is very nearly an
artist.
   Like President Reagan, he knows the way things are said _ the
tone, the emphasis, the subtle message or two _ is usually as
important, and sometimes more meaningful, than the rhetoric itself.

   NATO seems to have the right idea. The Red Army troop reductions,
assuming they come off at all, are but a small start in what must be
major cutbacks.
   As always, we should remain utterly skeptical of Soviet words

   The General Accounting Office, the research arm of Congress, says
the Internal Revenue Service has some serious deficiencies, such as:
   _ Its employees in some parts of the country are paid less than
workers at local hamburger and pizza emporiums.
   _ Its tax-collection process badly needs modernizing.
   _ Its computer capacity must be beefed up. ...
   You would think that by now Uncle Sam's tax collectors would have
been given whatever they needed to flush out deadbeats and tighten
loopholes in the system.
   Both the legislative and executive branches have a responsibility
to see that the agency's needs are met and that it does its job.
   The IRS won't be able to collect all of the billions owed the
Treasury. But with the proper resources, it could make a substantial
dent in the amount of tax money that remains unpaid each year.

   Seattle Post-Intelligencer on the budget deficit:
   Politically moderate economists and political leaders in both
parties generally agree that additional federal revenues will be
needed if President-elect George Bush is to reduce the federal
deficit.
   They are right.
   The question is how to accomplish the job. Candidate Bush said
read my lips, no new taxes. Well, the election is over and many
believe a way must be found for him to experience a change of heart,
or lips.
   Rep. Dan Rostenkowski, D-Ill., wants to help. He proposes a 10-or
15-cent per gallon federal gasoline tax, on top of the nine cents
now charged at the pump. This is a sensible proposal, but not the
only one that should be considered. A $1 a barrel oil import fee
also deserves review. ...
   Since we must have some tax boost, why not put it on gasoline, or
imported oil? Such a tax or fee would encourage conservation as well
as production of more fuel-efficient automobiles and that, in turn,
would reduce America's growing consumption of petroleum.

   The Honolulu Star-Bulletin on the response to the Armenian
earthquake:
   The generous response to the disaster stems from humanitarian
impulses. But it may also have been influenced by (Soviet President
Mikhail S.) Gorbachev's attempts to reduce world tensions.
   Americans and other Westerners now perceive the Soviet Union as
less threatening. That makes it easier to sympathize with and help
the earthquake victims.
   In turn, the relief effort may help convince the Soviet
leadership and people that the West doesn't seek their conquest or
destruction. If that happens, this natural disaster may help prevent
the ultimate political disaster of nuclear war.

   The Sun Herald, Biloxi-Gulfport, Miss., on Gorbachev's U.N.
speech:
   Mikhail Gorbachev is either a master manipulator of world opinion
or the most pragmatic Soviet leader in history _ or both.
   His U.S. visit ... demonstrated one thing: He is, for the time
being, the dominant personality on the world scene.
   Gorbachev's announcement before the United Nations (of a
reduction in Soviet troops and tanks) ... was a blockbuster. ...
   President-elect Bush must follow through by testing the
willingness of the Soviets to take further concrete steps in
reversing this massive military buildup.
   The U.S. interest in encouraging fundamental change in the Soviet
Union is, first and foremost, in enhancing the long-term prospects
for peace.
   But there is also an economic advantage to be gained: The less we
have to pay to counter the Soviet military threat, the more the U.S.
resources can be diverted from military use to research and
development that will make our own economy stronger and more
competitive.

   Statesman-Journal, Salem, Ore., on alcohol abuse by young people:
   Alcohol abuse is rampant among adults, but it also is a growing
problem among young people. ...
   In fact, the drinking problem of young Americans has become so
bad that the National Commission Against Drunk Driving has called on
parents to assume greater responsibility for keeping alcohol away
from their children.
   That is wise advice. Unfortunately, it's not much heeded by the
youngsters who see their parents and other adults using the same
drug, often to excess. ...
   Furthermore, drinking is depicted in our advertising and in our
entertainment media as the normal way of life. The terribly
expensive downside to the consumption of alcohol seldom is portrayed
realistically.
   One in six persons who start to drink alcohol develops a drinking
problem. Those are deadly odds to contemplate. ...
   The commission urges legislation to regulate such advertising.
That would be in the best interests not only of the young people but
also the entire nation.

   Wisconsin State Journal, Madison, Wis., on teaching cultural
diversity:
   University of Wisconsin-Madison Chancellor Donna Shalala repeats
some haunting stories about the experiences of black students at
UW-Madison.
   One black student told how a white freshman stared at him for the
longest time before asking, ``May I touch your skin?'' Another
recalled how a white student, after standing next to her for a
while, remarked with some surprise, ``Hey, you don't smell!''
   Are those the actions of hard-core racists, or young men and
women ... who grew up with little or no personal contact with
blacks, Hispanics and other non-white people? We hope and expect
it's the latter. ...
   The best time to teach young people about cultural diversity is
not when they show up as (college) freshmen ..., but when they're in
high school, middle school or elementary school and should have a
relatively color-blind view of the world.

   A citizens' group from two islands in
the Adriatic Sea demanded on Wednesday the government open the
tourist centers to foreigners, the official Tanjug news agency
reported.
   Authorities declared Vis and Lastovo, near the central Dalmatian
coast, off limits to foreign tourists in 1973 after the Yugoslav
navy started fortifying them.
   As a result of lower tourist revenues, many younger island
residents left and those remaining are mostly elderly, said the
group.
   Parliament last month proposed declaring the islands
underdeveloped areas, which would entitle them to federal economic
assistance.
   ``The citizens of our islands are especially irritated by this
proposal,'' said Tonko Mladineo, the president of the county of Vis.

<HEAD>North Korea Agrees To Postpone Talks With South Korea</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   North Korea on Wednesday accepted a
South Korean proposal to postpone to Dec. 29 the talks between both
countries on easing tensions, officials said.
   North Korean officials accepted the date of the meeting,
scheduled for Thursday, in a telephone coversation with National
Assembly Speaker Kim Jae-soon, said the officials, speaking on
condition of anonymity.
   South Korea said the delay was necessary because of changes in
its delegation. Two governing Democratic Justice Party lawmakers in
the five-member delegation were named to government and party posts,
making it necessary to name new representatives.
   Government officials said Wednesday that former National Assembly
speaker Chae Mun-shik will head the delegation, replacing Park
Joon-kyu, who was named the chairman of the governing party last
week.
   Kim Hyon-wook, a lawmaker from the Democratic Justice Party,
replaced Lee Han-dong, who became the new home minister, they said.
The South Korean delegation also includes three delegates from the
opposition.
   The Dec. 29 meeting, the seventh since August, is aimed at
finding measures to ease tension on the divided peninsula and
issuing a joint non-agression declaration.
   The two sides also are to sign an agreement to pave the way for
the legislatures of the two Koreas to convene for the first time
since their land was divided in 1945.
   In the sixth round of talks at the truce village of Panmunjom on
Nov. 17, the nations agreed to convene a joint meeting of their
legislatures in the North Korean capital of Pyongyang next year. The
meeting would be followed by negotiations between groups of 50
lawmakers from each side.
   North Korean also has called for discussions aimed at arms and
troop reductions on the Korean peninsula.
   In a telephone conversation Tuesday, Prime Minister Kang
Young-hoon indicated to North Korean Prime Minister Yon Hyung Muk
that the Seoul government may agree to open negotiations on military
matters.
   North Korea has proposed a phased withrawal of the 42,000 U.S.
troops stationed in South Korea by 1991 and a mutual reduction of
armed forces of the two Koreas to 100,000 troops by 1991.
   The Korean peninsula was divided into communist North Korea and
capitalist South Korea at the end of World War II in 1945. They
fought the Korean War in 1950-53 that left more than one million
people dead on both sides. The United States and 15 other Western
nations supported South Korea in the war.

<HEAD>Anti-Duck Residents Accused Of Running Down Muscovys</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ST. AUGUSTINE BEACH, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A fowl feud over the number of
Muscovy ducks waddling about has turned violent, with duck haters
being accused of running the birds down.
   ``They're using $20,000 cars to kill three-pound ducks,'' said
Marilyn Pryor, a member of the city's special advisory committee on
ducks.
   ``It is beyond my comprehension that any one could so hate ducks
or any animal that they would intentionally and maliciously run them
down,'' she said.
   She said some residents have been seen driving onto lawns after
the ducks, which are characterized by a large crest, red wattles,
and a wheezy sound.
   Muscovy ducks are common in many Florida towns and cities, and
have their friends and foes throughout the state.
   Anti-duck forces say the ducks are too aggressive, multiply too
quickly, tend to get into gardens, leave droppings underfoot and in
general tend to be a pain in the neck.
   Jan Cheney, manager of the St. Augustine Humane Society, which
has joined police in investigating the run-downs, said that
purposely running ducks over is cruelty to animals and could be a
violation of state law.
   ``According to three reported eyewitness accounts, the drivers of
various vehicles have purposely swerved their automobiles at an
accelerated speed to aim their cars at ducks which would not have
actually been in their path,'' she said in a recent letter to City
Commissioner Pat Dodson, who heads the duck committee.
   Assistant Police Chief Ray Blackaby said a flock of ducks was hit
early Monday morning. According to a report filed by a resident,
someone driving a blue car intentionally rammed into the ducks,
killing one and injuring another.
   Last year, after the duck population in the Woodland neighborhood
had swelled to 180, some neighbors chipped in and hired a company to
catch most of the ducks and relocate them to Georgia.
   The duck catcher was confronted by pro-duck forces who tried to
halt the project. He had to be escorted out of the area by police.
   The City Commission formed the duck committee from people in the
neighborhood after the issue began to dominate commission meetings.
It includes pro and anti-duck forces. In April, police were called
to ensure that one verbal exchange didn't lead to fisticuffs.

<TEXT>
   The wine harvest of 220 million bottles
from the Champagne area promises to produce wine and champagne of
``exceptional quality'' next spring, industry officials said
Wednesday.
   Viticulturalists says this year's harvest is ``average'' in size
compared with the 264.4 million-bottle yield in 1987, in line with a
production pattern where two good years are generally followed by a
poor or moderate season.
   On the eve of the harvest, stocks stood at 712 million bottles,
or more than three year's worth of sales, including a spillover of
123 million bottles from 1986 and 1987, the Interprofessional
Committee of Wines from Champagne said.
   The top quality of this year's returns had proved the merits of a
newly implemented system of multiple harvesting, officials added.
   The wines will be excellent because the Champagne region in
northern France had a week of full sun at the start of September at
a crucial period in the grapes' ripening process, the committee said.

<DATELINE>SPRING HILL, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Calls come in from across the country
asking about the postcard campaign for the Spring Hill boy with
cancer.
   The problem is he doesn't really exist, and those who know the
details of the misguided effort are pleading for an end to the
postcard frenzy.
   Bags and bags of postcards keep coming, and the holiday season
has stirred even more interest.
   People hear that a boy named David would like to make the
Guinness Book of World Records for receiving the most postcards, or
Christmas cards, depending on the story.
   A Spring Hill post office box, or sometimes a West Palm Beach
number, is given as a mailing address.
   The real story is that Mario Morby of Steely, England, has
cancer, but it is in remission and his name already is listed in the
1989 Guinness Book for having the world's largest collection of
postcards.
   Frances Keefe, founder of Florida Child's Wish Come True
organization in Spring Hill, decided this summer to help with his
effort.
   Aline Morin, a member of the Ladies Auxiliary of the Veterans of
Foreign Wars Post 3588 in Lake Worth latched onto the idea in August
as a special project and offered her West Palm Beach address as
another possibility.
   She says the Morbys asked that the name David be used to protect
their son, a report the Morbys deny.
   ``We never asked anybody to use that name,'' Mario's father,
whose name is David, said from his home this week. ``We don't even
know how that got started.''
   But the result has been thousands of pieces of mail addressed to
``David'' each day.
   Joseph Cerbone, mail supervisor in Spring Hill, said Wednesday
that about 50,000 pieces of mail arrive each day for David in the
Gulf Coast community about 50 miles north of Tampa.
   Ms. Morin, across the state in West Palm Beach, says she has
received about 165,000 postcards, and almost 5,000 are arriving
daily.
   Ms. Keefe, who runs her non-profit organization out of her
Hernando County home, is running out of space.
   ``I have a sunken living room that has 37 boxes of mail in it,''
she said Tuesday. ``I have a Florida room that has 48 letter trays
from the post office in it. I have a dining room table that's piled
high, so the only thing I have left is my kitchen, bathroom and
bedrooms.''
   In July, the Morbys directed the postal service to deliver the
postcards to an auction house in Nottingham, England, where the mail
is sold every two months. Stamp collectors and others buy the
postcards.
   Money from those sales is being donated to the Birmingham
Children's Hospital in England, where Mario received his
chemotherapy treatment. His case is in remission. The auctions have
raised about $4,000.

   The State Department has expressed concern to
Salvadoran authorities over the killing of a member of the ruling
Christian Democratic party during a voter registration drive, a
spokesman said Wednesday.
   Francisco Bonilla was alleged to have been killed Monday by a
policeman during an altercation in Soyapango, a suburb north of San
Salvador, the capital.
   ``We deplore any act of violence and have expressed our concern
over the killing to Salvadoran authorities,'' State Department
spokesman Charles Redman said.
   Fidel Chavez Mena, the nominee of the governing Christian
Democrats in the March 1989 presidential election, said Mayor
Antonio Vasquez of Soyapango was among several people who forced
Bonilla from his car before the shooting.
   Alfredo Cristiani, presidential nominee of the right-wing
Nationalist Republican Alliance (ARENA), said a party investigation
turned up nothing to link Vasquez to the killing. Vasquez is an
ARENA member.

<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The state-controlled media on Wednesday
harshly criticized a series of disturbances marking the seventh
anniversary of martial law, but newspapers praised some Solidarity
leaders for moderation.
   Thousands of anti-government protesters rallied in Warsaw,
Krakow, Wroclaw and at least three other cities to protest the
military crackdown ordered Dec. 13, 1981, by Polish leader Gen.
Wojciech Jaruzelski.
   Television showed scenes of masked students hurling stones and
radio carried the chants of protesters, saying, ``Down with
Jaruzelski!''
   ``They hide behind the gate of the university, the traditional
bastion of rationality in thought, ... where there should be no
place for brutality and violence,'' the government newspaper
Rzeczpospolita said, referring to student demonstrators who Tuesday
hurled stones at police in Warsaw.
   ``The program of confrontation, street confrontation, is a lost
cause,'' the newspaper said. ``Adventurous excesses ... are a proof
of lack of political imagination.''
   Most papers drew unfavorable comparisons between recent
conciliatory statements by Solidarity leader Lech Walesa and other
union leaders and the antagonistic actions and the chants of the
demonstrators.
   ``Recent events and especially Lech Walesa's remarks in Paris
indicate that a meeting of authorities with the constructive
opposition and other social forces ... is a real possibility,'' said
Warsaw's Zycie Warszawy.
   ``In such a situation, several thousand young people in a few
Polish cities went out into the streets with stones in their hands
and chants and banners saying, `Down with the Commune.'''
   In a separate editorial, the paper said, ``Do they realize that
by street brawls they support anti-reform forces, and to they really
want to?''
   The newspapers drew attention to remarks made by Walesa in Paris
over the weekend, making the first foreign trip he has been allowed
since martial law, in which Walesa said there were signs of positive
developments in Poland but that reform must be quickened.
   The official PAP news agency also noted approvingly that
Solidarity national spokesman Janusz Onyszkiewicz had condemned
stone-throwing by demonstrators in Gdansk on Sunday, and that the
Rev. Henryk Jankowski, a Walesa adviser, had asked parishioners not
to behave aggressively.
   Onyszkiewicz and Jankowski normally are targets of government
criticism.

<TEXT>
   Spain's first general strike in 54 years
shut down major industries, public transportation and state offices
today. Police reported sporadic violence and made at least 30
arrests.
   The strike ``succeeded beyond our greatest expectations,'' said
Jose Manuel de la Parra, spokesman for the Socialist General
Workers' Union, the country's largest which called the strike to
protest government austerity measures.
   Socialist Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez told a news conference
the strike was no reason to call elections before they are scheduled
in 1990. But a government communique acknowledged the strike
succeeded in much of the country.
   Parra estimated that 7.8 million of the 11.8 million employed
Spaniards stayed off the job.
   General Motors spokesman Rafael Casas said only 250
administrative workers showed up at their Opel plant, which employs
9,100 people in Zaragoza.
   Spain's three major business associations accused unions of using
``strong-armed tactics'' to force small businesses and offices to
close.
   There were reports of sporadic violence and at least 30 arrests
throughout Spain, especially at outlets of the leading El Corte
Ingles department store, where angry picketers tried to prevent
employees and shoppers entering.
   A store spokesman speaking on condition of anonymity said 90
percent of the chain's 31,000 employees showed up for work.
   At its main store in downtown Madrid, police charged
photographers covering a melee, beating them over the head with
clubs.
   Socialist leader Jose Maria Benegas said people joined the strike
out of fear and intimidation. But Madrid's Socialist Mayor Juan
Barranco said the government had to concede that the strike
succeeded in keeping most of the city's 4 million residents at home.
   In small towns and large cities, local radio stations reported
people stayed indoors, bars and restaurants remained shuttered and
cinemas and theaters were closed in this nation of 38 million people.
   In an unusual joint action, the General Workers' Union and the
communist-dominated Workers Commissions called the strike to protest
economic policies of Gonzalez's 6-year-old government and its
failure to satisfy demands for wage increases, unemployment benefits
and pensions.
   The disputed policies have reduced inflation nine points to 5.1
percent and led to a 5 percent annual growth rate. But they have
been unable to make a dent in Western Europe's highest unemployment
rate of 18.7 percent.
   Gonzalez told reporters he was not considering calling early
elections. Polls indicate the Socialists would win another majority
if elections were held now, and Gonzalez said the situation between
government and unions would be ``exactly the same.'' But he repeated
an offer to discuss with the unions ways to improve the economic and
social situation.
   Union branches in Barcelona called for a protest tonight in the
country's second largest city and both unions planned to march on
Madrid on Friday.
   An October 1934 general strike was put down violently by troops
led by Gen. Francisco Franco acting on orders of the ill-fated
Second Republic.

   President Reagan said Wednesday he is confident
that in the coming years the United States and China will ``forge
even stronger ties and build a safer and more prosperous world.''
   The White House said Reagan made the statement to Chinese
Ambassador Han Xu at a meeting marking the 10th anniversary of the
opening of full U.S. diplomatic ties with the mainland government in
Beijing.
   President-elect Bush attended the meeting in the Oval Office.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said Reagan voiced his
personal good wishes to the Chinese people and ``noted the
historically warm feelings of Americans for the Chinese people and
the major contributions that Americans of Chinese descent have made,
and continue to make, to the development of our country and the
enrichment of our heritage.''
   The actual 10th anniversary of full U.S.-Beijing relations is
Thursday. On Dec. 15, 1978, President Jimmy Carter switched formal
U.S. recognition of China to Beijing from the Nationalist government
on Taiwan. Since then, Washington has dealt with the rival Chinese
government in Taiwan on an informal basis.
   Wednesday's statement came just 10 days after a meeting in Moscow
between the Soviet and Chinese foreign ministers, which attracted
attention as a potential prelude to a Soviet-Chinese summit and a
warming of relations between the two former communist allies.
   Fitzwater said in his statement Reagan recalled that the three
previous American presidents ``of differing parties and viewpoints
had all worked with China's leaders to bring our nations and peoples
closer together,'' and he voiced ``satisfaction in having been able
to continue and expand on their efforts.''
   In 1972, President Richard Nixon made the opening breakthrough in
U.S. relations with the mainland, when he visited Beijing and a year
later established a diplomatic liaison office there headed by David
K. E. Bruce, a post subsequently held by Bush.
   Reagan ``looked back with pleasure on the warm hospitality he had
received during his own visit to China in 1984, when he had been
able to see first hand the great strides China was making to
implement reforms and better the life of its people,'' Fitzwater
said.
   The statement said Reagan ``expressed confidence that with our
relationship firmly grounded on the three U.S.-China joint
communiques of 1972, 1979 and 1982, China and the United States
would be able to work together in the years ahead to forge even
stronger ties and build a safer and more prosperous world.''

   A bank officer who was reported missing
a month ago after she withdrew a ``substantial amount of money'' was
found, naked and hysterical, outside a closed pizza parlor early
today, police said.
   Arlington police Sgt. Sharon Warms said 31-year-old Catherine
Thom apparently had been held against her will.
   Three men were being questioned today by the FBI and police in
the woman's Nov. 14 disappearance, said Arlington police spokesman
Dee Anderson.
   Restaurant employees found Ms. Thom slumped at the door shortly
after midnight, Warms said. The woman was taken to a hospital with a
cut over an eye and bruises on her arms and was released, said Fort
Worth police spokesman Doug Clarke.
   ``Her emotional state is such (that) she really hasn't been able
to tell us anything about the last 30 days,'' Anderson said. Ms.
Thom's mental state ``ranges from being very upset and emotional to
withdrawn.''
   Ms. Thom, an assistant vice president at First City Bank in
Arlington, was last seen in her car at a drive-in window of the
bank, police said. Police said she wrote a check for a ``substantial
amount of money.''
   Earlier this week, Arlington Detective Helen Schilling-Wallace
theorized the woman was trying to signal bank employees she was in
trouble when she wrote the check.
   Ms. Thom asked the teller how much she could withdraw and
included her driver's license for the transaction, even though she
was well known by the tellers.
   ``There's a good possibility that someone was in the car with
her, but we haven't been able to confirm that,'' Ms.
Schilling-Wallace said.
   On Nov. 16, the woman's car was found abandoned.
   Authorities said that a woman Tuesday night spotted a car with a
woman and three men inside and sensed something suspicious, noting
down the license number and calling police.
   Three men at the home where the car was spotted were asked to
come in for questioning, Anderson said. ``These three people have
been totally cooperative. They volunteered to let them search the
car, their house, whatever,'' Anderson said.

   Foreign Minister Shimon Peres praised PLO
chairman Yasser Arafat on Wednesday for having ``learned to say
peace,'' but asked why he wore an army uniform if he really meant it.
   Peres, who heads the left-leaning Labor Party, deviated from the
government's official response by failing to rule out the PLO as a
possible future negotiating partner.
   He made the remarks in a speech to the parliament in response to
Arafat's address a day earlier to the U.N. General Assembly in
Geneva.
   On Tuesday, Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir of the right-wing Likud
bloc issued an uncompromising rejection of the PLO and of Arafat's
peace bid, labeling the U.N. speech as double-talk.
   Peres, however, complimented Arafat for the peace bid by saying:
``He has learned to say peace, and I welcome this. He is learning.''
   Peres also called for a peace dialogue with Palestinians
``immediately and without the Jordanians, if they so decide, as long
as they don't shoot.'' The Labor Party had called for peace talks
with a joint Palestinian-Jordanian delegation, but Jordan's King
Hussein in July ruled out such a move.
   Peres criticized Arafat for not doing enough to end terrorism and
for wearing a military uniform at the United Nations.
   ``I have seen Arafat hold out the olive branch while holding a
pistol,'' Peres said. ``Yesterday he also wore a uniform. He says
he's effectively the head of a government, so what is he wearing a
uniform for?''
   Peres added: ``He said he condemns terrorism in all its forms but
then leaves himself two openings, the struggle against occupation
and the intefadeh.''
   ``Intefadeh'' _ Arabic for uprising _ is used to describe the
Palestinians' revolt against Israeli rule in the occupied West Bank
and Gaza Strip. More than 320 Palestinians and 13 Israelis have died
in the violence.
   Peres also rejected Arafat's suggestion of placing U.N. troops in
the occupied territories, saying such a move would pre-empt Israel's
right to peace talks.
   ``I would say that Arafat's speech was, at most, a rhetorical
success and, at its least, a political disappointment,'' Peres said.
``What is needed are political decisions.''
   Peres also reiterated the Labor Party's proposal of a partial
withdrawal from the disputed lands in exchange for peace.
   ``I am ready for a territorial compromise, for Palestinians to
live in honor and freedom under their own administration as long as
they don't endanger Israeli security,'' he said.
   Peres remarks were interrupted at times by members of the rival
Likud bloc.
   Likud legislator Michael Eitan shouted: ``In whose name are you
speaking?'' Eitan shouted at Peres.

<HEAD>Soviets Plan 50 Percent Devaluation, Incentives for Foreign
Factories</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ANN IMSE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Soviet government has decided to devalue the
ruble by 50 percent on some foreign trade deals in 1990, and to
allow Western capitalist companies to operate almost independently
on Soviet soil, a newspaper said.
   The ruble appears to be set for a slide from $1.60 to 80 cents,
dramatically cutting the price of Soviet goods to foreign buyers.
   It is the first step toward reducing the ruble's extreme
over-valuation under Soviet-set exchange rates. The black market
rate for the ruble is 20 cents to 25 cents.
   ``A lot of people have become very excited,'' said a Western
diplomat who declined to be identified. But he said the communist
nation reputedly has 3,000 different exchange rates depending on the
product and the partner, and the Soviets have not said which will
experience the full 50 percent drop.
   The devaluation will affect only foreign trade, not tourists and
Soviet citizens, he said.
   The changes are designed to encourage foreign firms to build
factories that will ease the Soviet Union's extreme shortage of
consumer goods and medical supplies, according to a policy statement
from the Council of Ministers published in several economic journals
in recent days.
   A spokesman for the Council of Ministers declined to clarify the
statement, but promised a news conference with Deputy Premier
Vladimir Kamentsev at a later date.
   The devaluation is set for Jan. 1, 1990, according to the
newspaper Socialist Industry. Western economists said they were
baffled by the delay, noting that it throws current trade
negotiations into chaos, as foreigners would gain by waiting for the
more favorable exchange rates.
   The newspaper termed the devaluation an interim step toward a new
set of exchange rates to be installed on Jan. 1, 1991.
   The Western economists, who declined to be identified, said the
timetable fits with Soviet plans to revamp wholesale prices, which
are set by bureaucrats and have no relation to costs. Retail price
reform is expected at a later date, as is a convertible ruble.
   The policy statement promised that foreign firms, now limited to
49 percent ownership of joint ventures, will be allowed to negotiate
their stakes, and even send in their own managers to run the
companies.
   ``It's a lot closer'' to major Western companies' desire for real
control, and at least 90 percent ownership, before they invest in
Soviet operations, said one American businessman in Moscow who asked
not to be identified.
   ``One of the reasons they've been cool toward the joint venture
law is they'd like to operate their own wholly owned subsidiaries in
the Soviet Union,'' he said.
   ``It's a psychological barrier,'' said a Western diplomat,
``because you can have what you want and the managing director can
be foreign.'' In addition, the joint venture will be allowed to pay
for housing and other services for its foreign employees out of its
ruble earnings, rather than be forced to spend additional hard
currency, he said.
   The policy statement also promised that firms manufacturing
consumer goods and medical products in the Soviet Union would be
allowed to take part of their profits home. Companies building
operations in the sparsely populated Soviet Far East would get three
years of tax-free operations.
   However, several businessmen said the changes don't eliminate the
greatest obstacles to Western firms. ``You've got to be able to
repatriate profits and guarantee a supply of materials locally,''
said John Burgess of Midland Bank PLC.
   The American businessman said Western interest in the Soviet
market is being driven more by ``the hype of perestroika and the
Gorbachev persona'' than by government policy.

   American industry is using more of its capacity
than at any time in nine years, the government said Wednesday,
heightening concerns that the economy will overheat and inflation
accelerate.
   The Federal Reserve said the operating rate at factories, mines
and utilities was 84.2 percent last month, up from 84.0 percent in
October. It was the seventh increase in eight months and the highest
rate since November 1979.
   In a related report, the Fed said its industrial production index
in November increased by 0.5 percent for the second month in a row.
It now stands at 139.9 percent of its 1977 base, reflecting gains in
most sectors, particularly light truck manufacturing and production
of business equipment.
   At the White House, spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said the figures
were ``good for steady growth in the economy.''
   But David Berson, an economist with the Federal National Mortgage
Association, said, ``We're starting to approach levels of capacity
utilization in some industries that will mean higher prices. If
growth continues at this rate, we'll soon find most industries
passing on higher prices and we'll see monthly increases in the
inflation numbers.''
   As capacity use edges toward 85 percent, economists fear
factories will have trouble producing enough goods to meet demand,
leading to shortages and price increases.
   A separate release by the Commerce Department supports the view
that economic growth, after moderating in the July-September
quarter, is rebounding.
   Business inventories rose a modest 0.2 percent in October as
sales shot up 1.2 percent. Economists said the combination likely
will spur an increase in orders to factories, placing greater strain
on capacity.
   ``The balance between inventories was so good and so lean that it
signals strong production in the months ahead,'' said Allen Sinai,
an economist with the Boston Co., an investment house. ``That's good
for economic growth ... but it is too strong for comfort on
inflation and interest rates.''
   A third report, on the merchandise trade deficit for October, ran
counter to the trend of the other statistics. The trade gap narrowed
by 3.1 percent to $10.3 billion as exports fell by $317 million and
imports dropped an even bigger $643 million.
   However, David Jones, an economist with Aubrey G. Lanston & Co.,
a government securities trader in New York, said improvement in the
trade deficit will slow in the months ahead. He said capacity
strains will make it difficult to manufacture more exports, and
strong domestic demand will suck in more imports.
   Jones said a monthly improvement in the trade deficit normally
would trigger a rally in financial markets, but bond and stock
prices fell in early trading because the other reports heightened
the fear that the Federal Reserve will nudge interest rates higher
to curb inflation.
   That decision could have been made Wednesday when a Fed committee
finished a two-day private meeting to set monetary policy, he said.
The committee does not disclose its decisions publicly.
   In the capacity report, the Federal Reserve said the
manufacturing operating rate climbed to 84.5 percent last month, up
from 84.3 percent in October.
   Producers of both durable goods _ ``big ticket'' items ranging
from bicycles to battleships _ and non-durable goods reported higher
rates. The rate at durable goods plants was 83.1 percent in
November, up from 82.9 percent. Non-durable goods producers recorded
a 0.1 percentage point gain to 86.5 percent.
   The Fed said the operating rate for primary metals industries
jumped to 92.4 percent, the highest since December 1978. Most of the
increase came at steel mills.
   Use of motor vehicle and parts manufacturing capacity rose for
the fourth consecutive month to 85.4 percent, reflecting gains in
light truck production. But automobile plants, a subcategory,
slipped to 76.7 percent, down from 77.0 percent.
   The operating rate at utilities was 81.0 percent in November, up
from 80.8 percent. It had hit a peak for the year in August of 83.9
percent because of a surge in electricity use for air conditioning.
   In the mining sector, which includes oil and gas drilling, the
operating rate increased to 82.2 percent last month. It was 81.6
percent in October.
   The Fed's production index has not declined since September 1987.
Production in the manufacturing sector rose 0.5 percent in November,
following an even stronger 0.6 percent gain in October.
   Automobiles were assembled at an annual rate of 7.6 million
units, down slightly from October. But production of business
equipment rose 0.4 percent following a flat month in October and
stood 8.8 percent higher than a year ago.
   Output at mines and oil wells rose 0.6 percent in November after
three consecutive declines. Production at utilities increased 0.4
percent, on top of a 0.6 percent jump in October.
   Total output at factories, mines and utilities was 5.1 percent
higher than a year ago.

   A public safety inspector and seven of his
deputies were questioned in the fireworks explosion that killed 68
people at a crowded street market, officials said Wednesday.
   Thousands of fireworks exploded Sunday in the downtown Corona
Street neighborhood, causing a fire that swept through the area
about a half mile from the Zocalo, or grand plaza.
   Police on Tuesday detained Manuel Quintanilla Velasquez, the
chief public safety inspector in the district where the market is
located, said spokeswoman Marcela Cleriga of the district attorney's
office.
   Seven deputy inspectors responsible for searching markets for
illegal fireworks also were detained, Cleriga said.
   Authorities were trying to determine what charges, if any, would
be filed against the eight, she said.
   Residents have reported the deputy inspectors accepted bribes
from vendors of fireworks that were sold without the required
permits, the district attorney's office said. Quintanilla Velasquez
allegedly received a percentage of the money.
   After the blaze was extinguished, city officials carted away
thousands of unexploded fireworks from stalls and a pedestrian
underpass adjacent to Corona Street.
   Angry residents on Monday led Mayor Manuel Camacho Solis to
stalls they said contained crates of unexploded fireworks. The mayor
announced a citywide ban on the sale and use of fireworks. Officials
said it appeared that none of the Corona Street fireworks vendors
had permits to sell them.

   Hundreds of mourners, many
armed with M-16 rifles, marched through this West Bank settlement
Wednesday to bury a Jewish settler bludgeoned to death by a
Palestinian shepherd.
   The army blew up the shepherd's home in the nearby Arab village
of Burin after ordering his family to evacuate immediately, Israel
radio reported. The radio broadcast the sound of the dynamite
charges exploding, punctuated by the screams of family members.
   Israel routinely demolishes homes of Palestinians suspected of
anti-Israeli activities.
   Also Wednesday, Israel deported three Palestinians into southern
Lebanon's Syrian-controlled Bekaa valley. An army spokesman said the
expulsions were not directly related to the year-long Palestinian
uprising because the men's offenses predated the unrest.
   The spokesman said two of the Arabs asked to be deported rather
than continue serving lengthy prison sentences for terrorist
activities. The third, he said, infiltrated illegally from Jordan in
1969.
   Thirty-three Palestinians have been deported for alleged
anti-Israeli activities since the rebellion began. Another 27 are
under deportation orders.
   Elsewhere in the occupied territories, troops shot and wounded
five Palestinians. Among them were a 14-year-old boy shot in the
right thigh and a 15-year-old boy hit in the shoulder.
   Also Wednesday, a military court sentenced four West Bank
Palestinians to three years imprisonment for their part in a
stone-throwing melee in which a teen-age Israeli girl was killed in
April.
   A Jewish settler guard opened fire wildly, killing the girl and
two Palestinian villagers, after he was hit with a stone during a
riot in Beita.
   The Palestinian shepherd, identified as Hamdan Najjar, 25,
crushed the skull of settler Yaakov Pereg with a rock on Tuesday.
Then he seized Pereg's rifle and killed a 41-year-old reserve
soldier and slightly wounded two others before troops shot him to
death.
   The deaths raised to 13 the number of Israelis killed in the Arab
revolt against Israel's occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
At least 323 Palestinians have died.
   The procession to Pereg's windswept burial plot was interrupted
Wednesday by mourners shouting insults at West Bank commander Maj.
Gen. Amram Mitzna.
   ``Mitzna is a bad general. He doesn't do anything to protect us.
The army is only concerned with politics and not defense,'' said
Michael Ben Horin of Nov, a collective farm in the Israeli-annexed
Golan Heights.
   Busloads of Israelis, many carrying weapons and Israeli flags,
attended the two-hour ceremony conducted under a steady rain. ``A
politicians' army means insecurity for settlements,'' read one sign
carried in the procession.
   Pereg's widow, Leah, who is pregnant with the couple's fourth
child, said she and her family would never leave the West Bank.
   ``If they want us to build it with blood we will. We will not
leave this place,'' Mrs. Pereg said.
   Also Wednesday, settlement leaders met Prime Minister Yitzhak
Shamir to demand that Arab stone-throwers be deported.
   ``Every time Jewish blood is spilled the Arab must immediately be
expelled from the land. It will teach Arabs not to lift up their
hands to Jews,'' Berakha security chief Itzhak Yamin told Israel
radio.

   Scrooges in Chautauqua County are about to
be visited by a modern day recreation of Charles Dickens' Spirit of
Christmas.
   Charles Ferraro, county commissioner of social services, has
compiled the names of 1,000 people who owe a total of $5.7 million
in overdue payments for child and family support.
   Ferraro's ``SCROOGE'' list _ Support Children, Remember
Obligations, Or Get Embarrassed _ will appear Dec. 20 in full page
advertisements in the county's two daily newspapers.
   ``It just made so much sense when you think about the story of
Scrooge and how in the end, he realized what he was doing and turned
out to be the good guy,'' Ferraro said. ``We are hoping that will
happen to a lot of these people.'' The penny-pinching Ebenezer
Scrooge finally got the Christmas spirit in ``A Christmas Carol''
and helped Tiny Tim and his family.
   Reaction from some of the delinquent parents, who have been
warned in a series of letters, ranged from anger to threats of
lawsuits, Ferraro said.
   ``Its rather amazing to me that a man who can't pay his child
support can afford to hire a lawyer to sue me,'' he said.
   The pay or publicity tactic has social service commissioners in
other counties waiting expectantly, he said. ``We've had many
inquires from other commissioners, and some of them have already
committed themselves to doing the same thing next year.''
   Judy Lamb, head of the Western New York Coalition of Women for
Child Support, said the idea was ``terrific.''
   ``It can take years to get a non-custodial parent to make support
payments, and if a woman decides to resort to a request for
incarceration for the delinquent father, it can take two to three
years before a hearing officer will even make a recommendation for
incarceration,'' Ms. Lamb said.
   Ferraro said the plan was conceived a year ago after he noticed
that overdue payments were increasing each year.
   The idea to print the names was an offshoot of the county's
practice of publishing names of delinquent property taxpayers and
the idea of SCROOGE popped up with a Christmas target date, he said.

   Broadway star Patti Lupone has married a
cameraman she met while filming a television miniseries, a publicist
confirmed Wednesday.
   The wedding was performed Monday on the stage of the Vivian
Beaumont Theater in Manhattan, where Lupone is starring in the
musical ``Anything Goes,'' said publicist Fia Palumbo.
   Lupone and Matt Johnston met while working on the miniseries
``LBJ.'' Afterward, the couple joined their 300 guests _ including
Lupone's ``Evita'' co-star Mandy Patinkin and actor David Keith _ in
the theater lobby.
   Lupone left immediately on her honeymoon, taking a leave from the
play until Dec. 28. The 39-year-old singer-actress won a Drama Desk
award this year for her performance in the ``Anything Goes'' revival.

   Darryl Roberts, the U.S. member of an
international team preparing to make a 650-mile trek to the North
Pole, wants to be the first American to reach the North Pole on foot.
   ``I thought, `What would be the greatest thing I could do on this
planet?''' said Roberts. ``I hate the cold, so I figured it would
have to be something with the cold.''
   Roberts, a 23-year-old teacher, will be part of a seven-person
team called Operation Icewalk, with representatives from Great
Britain, Australia, the Soviet Union, Japan and West Germany, to
start the walk March 5, 1989.
   The group is headed by Robert Swann of England, who is trying to
become the first man ever to reach the North and South poles on
foot. On Tuesday, Swann and Roberts attended a ceremony at the
Explorers Club where they received a flag once taken to the South
Pole by Adm. Robert E. Byrd.
   To get used to the cold, Roberts has already made two trips to
the Yukon and plans two more training missions with the team.
Temperatures at the start of the 65-day trip are expected to be at
94 below zero.
   Roberts, a native of Harlem who has been active in the Outward
Bound program, said he wants to demonstrate to inner-city children
that they can make their dreams come true.

   Gov. Rose Mofford has mailed 5,000 holiday cards
featuring a smiling caricature of herself poking a bare leg from a
white Roman toga slit up the side.
   ``Rose liked it. I showed a little knee,'' said Sherman Goodrich,
the San Diego artist who has designed Mrs. Mofford's cards for 10
years. ``She's a sexy lady.''
   The idea to model the governor's costume after the Goddess of
Liberty, a winged statue atop the Capitol dome, was Mofford's,
Goodrich said.
   The message in the card reads: ``Seasons greetings, and my
heartfelt thanks for your help and trust in this my first year as
governor of the great state of Arizona.''
   The cards were sent to ``everyone on her massive Rolodex,'' as
well as to the state's newspapers and nation's governors, said
spokesman Vada Manager. Mrs. Mofford, 65, paid for the cards, which
required 35 cents postage, Manager said.
   Assuming a historical disguise was hardly new for Mrs. Mofford,
said Goodrich.
   ``I've depicted her as Uncle Sam. I've depicted her as Santa
Claus. I've depicted her as the Statue of Liberty,'' Goodrich said
Tuesday. ``I did her as Mae West one time, which is perfect.''

   Heart transplants made Don Homrich and
Terri Nelson sweethearts, but a television show's interest in their
love story will make them some money.
   The couple agreed to accept $75,000 from the nationally
syndicated ``A Current Affair'' to talk about their romance on the
air. But the deal nearly fell through when producers urged the
couple to have a televised wedding.
   ``They were trying to force us into getting married just to
increase their ratings, and it didn't seem as though they cared
about us at all,'' Homrich said.
   Fox Broadcasting Co., which broadcasts the show, will pay for a
two-week vacation to the Bahamas the couple had planned over the
Christmas holidays. Fox may film some of the trip for the broadcast,
tentatively scheduled for New Year's Day.
   The couple first heard from the show's producers about 10 days
ago, after their story which was featured in the Thanksgiving
edition of The Grand Rapids Press.
   The couple met after Homrich read a newspaper account of Nelson's
September 1987 transplant and called to encourage her to attend an
organ transplant support group in which he is active. Homrich had a
heart transplant in April 1984.

following a six-month tour of duty on a Royal Navy destroyer that
rescued a boatload of Vietnamese refugees, his commanding officer
said.
   Andrew's ship, the Edinburgh, rescued 15 adults, three small
children and a 3-week-old baby from a tiny craft floating 250 miles
off the Vietnamese coast in early September, Capt. Alastair Ross
told a news conference.
   ``It was a very emotional moment,'' Ross said after the ship
arrived in its home port on Scotland's west coast.
   Ross gave no details of Andrew's role in the rescue. About 300
sailors serve on the Edinburgh, a guided-missile destroyer, which
sailed to Australia to participate in bicentennial celebrations.
   The prince, second son of Queen Elizabeth II, was allowed to
return home for the Aug. 8 birth of his daughter, Princess Beatrice,
who is to be christened on Tuesday.

   Business inventories in October climbed at the
slowest rate in five months, while sales surged a strong 1.2
percent, the government said Wednesday in a report suggesting robust
economic growth.
   The Commerce Department said inventories held on shelves and
backlots rose 0.2 percent to a seasonally adjusted $751.4 billion,
while sales jumped to $501.5 billion.
   Economists said the combination of a modest increase in
inventories and brisk sales is a sign of economic strength and,
possibly, inflation.
   With fewer goods in reserve relative to sales, retailers feel
compelled to place more orders, possibly overburdening factories,
leading to shortages and higher prices, they said.
   ``It looks as though we're getting a tendency for sales to get so
strong that they're pulling down inventories,'' said David Jones, an
economist with Aubrey G. Lanston & Co., a government securities
trader in New York. ``That will lead to an even stronger pickup in
orders to manufacturers. It reinforces the acceleration of the
economy in the months ahead.''
   The modest October inventory increase followed increases of 0.9
percent in September and 1.1 percent in August. Those jumps had led
some economists to believe the pace of economic growth was slowing.
   ``It looks like full speed ahead,'' Jones said. ``There had been
some concern that the economy was weakening in the third quarter,
but recent numbers suggest it is accelerating in the fourth quarter.
... Growth prospects are strong for at least the first half of next
year.''
   Inventory accumulation in October was led by a 0.6 percent
increase at the manufacturing level, where sales were the weakest.
Wholesale inventories edged up 0.3 percent.
   Retail inventories, which had been rising in earlier months, fell
by 0.7 percent. If not for a big 2.2 percent drop in auto dealers'
inventories, retail backlogs would have been down only 0.1 percent.
   In sales, retailers posted a strong gain of 1.6 percent, while
wholesalers showed a 1.9 percent increase. Sales from factories were
up a moderate 0.5 percent, but they have been generally strong all
year because of an export-driven manufacturing boom.
   An advance estimate of retail sales for November, released
earlier this week, showed a 1.1 percent gain, evidence that retail
inventories will continue to decline as goods are sold during the
holiday shopping season.
   The combination of a small increase in inventories and a big jump
in sales held the inventory-to-sales ratio to 1.50 in October, down
from 1.51 a month earlier. That means it would take 1.50 months to
exhaust inventories at the October sales rate. The ratio was also
1.50 from June through August.

   State-run radio Wednesday
hailed the Brazzaville peace agreement as ``one of the most
impressive feats of African diplomacy in many years,'' but
newspapers expressed mixed feelings about it.
   Cuban and Angolan officials also praised the agreement, signed
Tuesday by their countries and South Africa in the Congo capital of
Brazzaville. President Kenneth Kaunda of Zambia and Angolan
guerrillas also said they welcomed it.
   The accord provides for the phased withdrawal of 50,000 Cuban
soldiers from Angola by mid-1991, and independence for Namibia, also
known as South-West Africa, in about one year. The three countries
will sign a final treaty in New York on Dec. 22, concluding years of
U.S. mediation in the region.
   The accords, also supported by the Soviet Union, call for an end
to 73 years of South African control over South-West Africa,
Africa's last colony.
   They also will end 22 years of bush warfare in South-West Africa,
and will bar Cuban and South African forces from participating in
the 13-year-old civil war between Angola's pro-Soviet government and
U.S.-backed rebels.
   South African Foreign Minister R.F. Botha said the peace moves
also included a separate understanding between South Africa and
Angola. He said the details would become known as the regional
accords became effective.
   In Brazzaville, Cuba's deputy foreign minister said South Africa
has ``committed itself to ending aid'' to guerrillas battling
Angola's Marxist government.
   Ricardo Alarcon Quesada provided no details of his claim at a
news conference Tuesday night, and Botha's office did not confirm it.
   Angola's chief of staff, Antonio dos Santos Franca, said ``the
historic Brazzaville protocol ... will inaugurate a new era of peace
in southwestern Africa.''
   In Lisbon, Portugal, a statement by Angolan guerrillas called the
agreement ``historic'' but said Angolans will not have peace until
the Angolan government negotiates with the guerrillas.
   The National Union for the Total Independence of Angola said
without direct negotiations with the government, ``our people will
not benefit from the present historic Brazzaville accords.''
   The South African Broadcasting Corp. called the agreement a
diplomatic feat and said the accord justifies South Africa's
insistence that a regional settlement depended on linking the
independence of South-West Africa to a Cuban withdrawal from
neighboring Angola.
   Business Day, an independent daily, said the settlement offered
South Africa the prospect of ``a reduced military and financial
burden and reduced international pressure.''
   However, South Africa's pro-government daily The Citizen said:
``South-West Africa was virtually an integral part of South Africa
... Now this connection is to be severed.''
   In Windhoek, the territorial capital, the Democratic Turnhalle
Alliance welcomed the agreement. Chief Secretary Johan de Waal said
he hoped nothing would bar ``a peaceful and meaningful
independence.''
   The 10-party alliance of economic and political moderates appears
the main opponent in South-West African elections to the South-West
African Peoples Organization nationalist movement. The nationalist
movement is favored to win.

<HEAD>Judge Orders Early Release for Teen Jailed After Making Bad Grades</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HAMMOND, Ind. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A 17-year-old traffic offender sent to jail
for earning poor grades was released early by the sentencing judge,
who said he was moved partially by the harshness of the county jail.
   Hammond City Court Judge Peter Katic has been criticized by a
juvenile court watchdog group for sending teen-age traffic offenders
to jail with adult criminals, rather than to a youth center. He
started his practice of ordering teen-age traffic offenders to make
decent grades _ C or better _ or go to jail more than a year ago.
   Under the terms of the youth's sentence, he was to serve 60 days.
Katic on Tuesday ordered him released immediately, after 20 days,
partly because of harsh conditions at the jail, including a lack of
bedding.
   The judge said the teen-ager had served an adequate length of
time and cited a precedent of ``two days of good time for each day
served.''
   The now freed Hammond High School student had been convicted of
driving without a license, with expired plates and false
registration papers. Police had stopped him driving his father's
unregistered, uninsured vehicle.
   He previously served one week, his spring vacation, in jail, but
was ordered back to jail when he did poorly in a recent grading
period. He spent the days in a cell with no windows, bedding or
books.
   An attorney general's opinion states that even 18-year-old
traffic offenders can be sent to juvenile centers if there is room.
However, Lake County Juvenile Court Judge Darlene Wanda Mears has
refused to house Katic's student-offenders because, she says, state
law forbids housing people convicted in adult court with offenders
convicted in juvenile court.
   Katic defends his practice of good grades or jail, saying 86 of
the 111 students who've appeared before him have gotten sufficient
grades since.

<TEXT>
   After 22 years of Army service, Sgt.
Greenberry Hill retired and waited for his pension checks. And
waited.
   Finally, Hill received a check for $104,805.22 Tuesday,
representing 18 years of retroactive retirement pay plus interest.
   ``They claimed they lost my records or they burned up _ for at
least 16 years,'' Hill, 58, said. ``The first check should have come
in in October of 1970.
   A fire in his Houston apartment destroyed Hill's own records, and
a fire in July 1973 at the National Personnel Records Center in St.
Louis apparently destroyed part of his government records.
   After returning to Mississippi from an off-shore job in the Gulf
of Mexico, Hill sought the assistance of U.S. Sen. Thad Cochran,
R-Miss., in 1986 to recover the money he felt was owed him.
   ``I said, `I've got to have some help from somewhere.' And it
wasn't even within 30 days that (the senator's office) had part of
my records,'' Hill said.
   Even then, it took awhile to get the settlement from the Army,
Cochran said.
   ``Some people didn't even believe he was entitled to it,'' the
senator said. ``But the story he told us had a ring of truth to it.
   ``It was two years of hard work that led to the discovery of the
files. It seemed to us that it was a long time,'' he said.
   Cochran's staff assistant, Nehemiah Flowers Jr., searched ``in
basements after work and after midnight'' until he located part of
Hill's missing records.
   Hill, who served in Italy, Korea, Vietnam, Japan, and Germany,
said he was afraid his records had been mislaid or accidentally
thrown away when he left Fort Carson, Colo., in 1970.
   He had to attend a hearing in Washington and answer questions as
part of the interrogation into his past.
   ``I'm just happy everything's come out on my behalf,'' Hill said,
beaming, moments before accepting the check. In addition to the back
pay plus interest, he has begun receiving his monthly pension of
about $765.
   Hill, who is not married and has no children, doesn't expect the
lump sum to change his life much. He'll keep his job in a print
shop, ``but I will be buying a home or trailer and getting my little
self settled down,'' he said.
   ``I already know where $17,000 is going because I already have
the automobile. It's right outside,'' Hill said.

   A cold kitten squeezed inside a soft
drink machine outside an animal shelter and frustrated efforts to
free it, until a Pepsi-Cola distributor made a special trip to open
the machine.
   Humane Society-Calhoun Area Shelter officials named the
black-and-white kitten Pepsi after its ordeal.
   The kitten, apparently left outside the shelter Friday, climbed
inside the machine, drawn by the warmth of its motor. Shelter
Manager Pat Early heard the kitten mewing while at the shelter for a
night meeting.
   The next day, a cat came tried to coax the kitten out by slipping
food on a stick inside the machine. The kitten munched the food but
didn't budge.
   After trying for several hours to coax the kitten to leave its
warm spot, the humane society people called the distributor, who
freed the feline.

   A fire believed to have been started by squatters
living in the Grand Central subway station stopped rush-hour service
for an hour Wednesday morning and inconvenienced an estimated

   The fire burned rubbish and generated thick smoke in an unused

   Two Transit Authority police officers were treated for smoke
inhalation, but no other injuries were reported, TA spokesman Bob

<TEXT>
   Developers of a biological product that would
enable corn to grow its own pesticide say they will seek permission
from federal authorities to test the product in four states.
   The bioinsecticide was developed by Crop Genetics International
Corp. of Hanover, Md., and is aimed at controlling the European corn
borer, a pest estimated to cause more than $400 million damage to
the nation's corn crop, said John Henry, the company's president and
chief executive officer.
   A first round of tests was conducted in Maryland this year and
Crop Genetics plans to ask the federal Environmental Protection
Agency next week for approval to conduct tests in 1989, he said.
   Testing will be done on 12 acres of land, Henry said.
   EPA approval, which could take up to three months, is necessary
each time a test is planned, said Albert Heier, an EPA spokesman in
Washington.
   In addition to fighting the European corn borer, the
bioinsecticide also works against the Southwestern corn borer, Henry
said.
   DeKalb-Pfizer Genetics, a division of DeKalb Genetics Corp. in
DeKalb, Ill. has signed a contract with the Maryland firm to help
test, develop and market the product, said Robert Pritchard, a
spokesman for DeKalb-Pfizer.
   ``If this product works as well as the folks at Crop Genetics
think it will, it will be a major breakthrough in crop protection
against corn bores,'' Pritchard said.
   ``Corn borers are the No. 1 pest in the country's No. 1 crop,''
Henry said.
   ``They have a laboratory technique to impregnate the seed with
this vaccine and they've done it on a laboratory scale,'' Pritchard
said. ``We're working to try to develop the technology to do this on
a commercial basis.''
   DeKalb-Pfizer plans to test the bioinsecticide on land it owns in
Illiopolis in central Illinois, Pritchard said.
   In addition, Crop Genetics also plans to test the bioinsecticide
in Stanton, Minn., in Hooper and Hastings, Neb., and in Ingleside
and Beltsville, Md., said James Davis, the company's general counsel.
   To make the bioinsecticide, Crop Genetics scientists took a gene
from a single-cell soil bacterium that produces a protein and
spliced it into endophytes, microorganisms that live in plants,
Henry said. When the borer eats the plant the protein becomes toxic
and destroys the insect's stomach.
   ``It gives the insects permanent ulcers,'' he said.
   The Maryland tests showed the microorganism could not live
outside the corn plant, did not remain in the crop residue or soil
and posed no risk to humans, Henry said.

<HEAD>Bush Names Yeutter as Ag Secretary</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Updates with comments on arms talks; PLO, other details</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By RITA BEAMISH</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   President-elect Bush today named Trade
Representative Clayton Yeutter to be his agriculture secretary, the
latest in a long line of Reagan administration officials appointed
to high-level jobs in the incoming Cabinet.
   Bush said Yeutter, 58, ``knows farm policy domestically. He knows
it internationally.''
   At a personnel announcement that turned into a free-wheeling news
conference, the president-elect also hailed anew Soviet leader
Mikhail Gorbachev's plans to demobilize 500,000 troops, but said
neither he nor aides had yet had time to study the implications of
the move.
   Bush said there was ``no way'' the new administration would have
a ``detailed point-by-point program on arms talks'' by mid-February,
when the Reagan administration has proposed a resumption in arms
talks with the Soviet Union.
   ``We are going to start working vigorously and I will send
whatever signal it takes'' to convey that message, the
president-elect said. ``I am interested in progress but I want it to
be prudent. I want whatever steps we take to be lasting.''
   Bush also said there was ``some movement there'' toward
moderation in Palestine Liberation Organization leader Yasser
Arafat's speech this week, but ``not enough'' to warrant direct
dealings with the PLO by the United States. He said he wants
``clear, unmistakeable, unambiguous'' declarations that the PLO
renounces terrorism, recognizes Israel and will work within key
United Nations resolutions.
   On other issues, Bush:
   _Spoke highly of former Texas Sen. John Tower, long rumored to be
his top choice for defense secretary. Tower's appointment has been
hanging for several days pending completion of an FBI background
check, and the president-elect said he had no doubt the former
lawmaker could do an excellent job ``if I decide to go that route.''
   _ Sidestepped questions about funding for cleaning up troubles
U.S. nuclear weapons productions plants, saying he didn't know where
the money would come from.
   _ Said he hadn't yet addressed the problem of homelessness with
budget advisers.
   _ Said he would submit ethics legislation to Congress ``very very
early'' in his administration.
   _ Said Vice President-elect Dan Quayle would be a ``key player''
in national security affairs if he wants to be, and said there may
be specific assignments in other areas. He seemed to rule out naming
Quayle as the new drug czar in view of legislation that requires a
full-time appointee to that post.
   The president-elect said he would not propose any substantial
cuts in existing farm programs, although he didn't say what he meant
by substantial. He added, ``I do not believe we will balance the
budget eventually on the backs of the farmers.''
   Yeutter's appointment was solo _ even though transition sources
have said Bush is expected to appoint Illinois transit official Sam
Skinner as the secretary of transportation.
   Yeutter's appointment marked a turnabout from eight years ago.
Then, President Reagan passed over him in choosing his original
Cabinet. This time, Yeutter wanted to leave government at the end of
the Reagan administration, but said Bush was one of the few people
who could persuade him to change his mind.
   Yeutter is Bush's latest holdover from the Reagan White House.
Other veterans include James A. Baker III, former treasury
secretary, named secretary of state; Nicholas Brady, picked to stay
as treasury secretary; Dick Thornburgh, to stay as attorney general;
Lauro Cavazos, to stay as education secretary. William Webster will
stay as head of the Central Intelligence Agency and Marlin Fitzwater
will remain as White House spokesman.
   Officials say Bush hopes to round out his Cabinet by Christmas.
   Yeutter, 58, a former Nebraska farmer, was chief executive
officer of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, and served in the
Agriculture Department and as deputy trade representative in the
administration of President Ford.
   Yeutter has represented the United States at international trade
negotiations since July 1985, and has been point man for the Reagan
administration's so-far unsuccessful effort to abolish all farm
subsidies by foreign governments.
   Bush pledged to continue that effort, and called for a thorough
reform of international agriculture provisions by 1990.
   Earlier today, transition co-director Craig Fuller said the FBI
investigation into Tower's background should be finished by the end
of the week.
   Tower, the leading contender for the post, met today with C.
Boyden Gray, the transition's legal counsel, to go over some of the
findings of the background check, Fuller said.
   Several members of Congress have suggested the long process of
checking out Tower would weaken him politically if and when he is
chosen. But Fuller said he thought Tower would be strengthened by
the process because FBI agents have left no stone unturned.
   In another development, sources said Wyoming oil and gas
executive Warren Morton was in Washington and had met with top
transition officials concerning the search for an Interior Secretary.
   Morton is a former speaker of the Wyoming House of
Representatives, and while his background as an oil industry
executive would almost certainly spark controversy from
environmental groups, he is among a handful of candidates with the
backing of Western state Republican senators who met last week to
discuss the subject.
   Sources said others acceptable to the group include Richard
Richards of Utah, a former national GOP chairman, retired House
Republican Leader John Rhodes of Arizona and Rep. Barbara Vucanovich
of Nevada. She appears out of the running following Bush's decision
not to name any incumbent member of Congress to his Cabinet.
   Skinner could not be reached for comment Tuesday, although his
wife, Sue, said, ``I assume he probably will be'' given the
transportation job. ``But I don't think it's been totally confirmed
with him yet,'' she said.
   Skinner, 50, has served since 1984 as chairman of the Regional
Transportation Authority of Northeastern Illinois, the nation's
second-largest mass transportation system. A former U.S. attorney in
Chicago, Skinner was Bush's Illinois campaign director, a post he
also held in Bush's failed 1980 presidential bid.
   For energy secretary, Fuller said Tuesday that the Bush team was
``looking for somebody who has got the technical, scientific and
management background'' to deal with problems of nuclear safety and
waste storage. Peter Johnson, former head of the Bonneville Power
Administration, based in Portland, Ore., and Louisiana Rep. Henson
Moore are still strong contenders, he said.
   A black educator, Dr. Louis Sullivan, president of Morehouse
School of Medicine in Atlanta, is a strong candidate for secretary
of health and human services, said Fuller.
   Other people Fuller said are still in contention for various
positions are Rep. Jack Kemp of New York, a former presidential
candidate who did not seek re-election this fall, and former
Transportation Secretary Elizabeth Dole.
   Kemp is considered a contender for secretary of housing and urban
development, but Fuller raised the possibility he might also be in
the running for non-Cabinet jobs.
   Constance Horner, head of the Office of Personnel Management, is
on a ``short list'' for labor secretary, among other posts, Fuller
said.

   An emergency room nurse was credited by
fire officials Wednesday for helping to save nine people overcome by
carbon monoxide poisoning.
   Robert Beyers, 76, was taken to St. Agnes Hospital by his wife,
Nola, 67, who thought he was having a heart attack, Fire Capt. Pat
Flynn said.
   When nurse Joan Briggs realized that Beyers and his wife, too,
had been overcome by carbon monoxide fumes, she called the fire
department.
   Firefighters went to the Beyers' home, where they found seven
other people who were in bed and had been overcome by the fumes. All
the victims were expected to recover and ``may very well owe their
lives'' to Ms. Briggs, Flynn said.
   A clogged chimney prevented the fumes from the gas furnace from
escaping, Flynn said.

   Nancy Reagan paid her final Christmas visit to
Children's Hospital National Medical Center as first lady Wednesday,
but she left her name behind on adolescent recreation room.
   ``For Children's Hospital, for the children and the staff here
Christmas really begins when Mrs. Nancy Reagan comes and spends time
with our children,'' said Tom Walsh, the hospital's board chairman.
   About 25 children, their parents and hospital officials joined
Mrs. Reagan as she listened to traditional Christmas music sung by a
choir from Washington-Lee High School in Arlington, Va.
   The exchange of gifts began with Mrs. Reagan receiving and then
presenting to Walsh a $25,000 check. The donation, a portion of
proceeds from NBC-TV's upcoming ``Christmas in Washington'' show, is
designated for the renovation of the recreation room that will bear
her name. Suzanne Wright, wife of NBC President Robert Wright, gave
the first lady the check.
   Mrs. Reagan received an artist's rendition of the completed room
and visited the facility
   ``Even though I won't be here touring, I'll be thinking of you
and I hope that all children have for all the years to come a very
Merry Christmas and the best of health. ... And I'll miss you,''
said Mrs. Reagan in a brief statement.
   The first lady gave rag doll to two patients, 5-year-old Terhea
Dawkins and 8{-year-old Marc Amoroso. Marc, who is receiving
chemotherapy treatment for leukemia, gave Mrs. Reagan a silk screen
print of a horse he did during an earlier hospital stay.
   Mrs. Reagan's also delivered gifts to most of the children on the
hospital's fourth floor during her two-hour visit. Many of them gave
her handmade cards and signs in return.
   But the first lady was most moved during her visit with a
13-year-old severely injured girl who had tried to commit suicide.
   ``I'm happy to meet you,'' said the girl, communicating with Mrs.
Reagan in sign language as her father spelled out the words.
   ``Try to remember that life can be a really wonderful, beautiful,
great experience. And it's only given to us once ... so get all you
can out of it,'' counseled Mrs. Reagan.
   ``I understand that now,'' signed the young patient in response.
   ``Better late than never,'' said the first lady, grasping and
rubbing the girl's hand.

   Stuart Symington, a former U.S. senator
from Missouri known as a champion of military air power in his more
than 30 years of public service, died of heart failure at his home
early today, a son said. He was 87.
   The Democrat served in the Senate from 1953 until his retirement
in 1977 and held various posts in the Truman administration. He was
the nation's first Air Force secretary in 1947-50 and assistant
secretary of war for air in 1946-47.
   He was a favorite-son candidate for the Democatic presidential
nomination in 1956 and 1960, losing to Adlai Stevenson and John F.
Kennedy respectively.
   ``He'd been ill with angina and weakness of the heart,'' said his
son James Symington, a former Missouri congressman and lawyer in
Washington.
   An Army veteran and graduate of Yale University, was chairman
from 1938 to 1945 of Emerson Electric Co. in St. Louis before
entering government service.
   As Air Force secretary he urged development of a large air force
at a time when Defense Secretary James Forrestal and other officials
favored a balance with land and sea forces, and he quit in 1950 in a
protest on is survived by another son,
Stuart Symington Jr., a St. Louis attorney; six grandchildren and
six great-grandchildren.
   Funeral arrangements were incomplete.

   Six kidney dialysis machines were flown
Wednesday to victims of the Armenian earthquake, part of the
emergency airlift that is encountering little of the usual Soviet
bureaucratic delays.
   An Aeroflot cargo plane was packed ceiling-to-floor and
wall-to-wall with the blood purification devices donated by an
Armenian emigre group and two Belgian universities.
   Flying with the machines were four doctors specializing in kidney
ailments.
   The international ``air bridge of life'' has brought tons of
blankets, tents and medical supplies for victims of the Dec. 7
quake. Wednesday's flight, organized by the Belgian chapter of the
humanitarian group Doctors without Borders, also carried other
supplies, making a total weight of 33 tons.
   Doctors aboard the flight said hospitals in Yerevan, the Armenian
capital, were still short of the dialysis machines needed to save
victims with what doctors call ``crush syndrome.''
   Dr. Gert A. Verpooten of Antwerp sat aboard the cargo jet en
route to Yerevan reading a research paper on treating crush syndrome.
   When muscles are crushed such as by crumbled buildlings in an
earthquake, they release toxic substances into the bloodstream that
can slowly kill the victim if not removed by dialysis, Verpooten
said.
   Crush syndrome could take many lives of Armenian earthquake
victims, he said.
   Dialysis machines, like most modern medical equipment and drugs
are in short supply in the Soviet Union, and the country had little
choice but to look abroad for help.
   In arranging the aid, the normally security-conscious Soviet
government cut through mounds of red tape.
   When a disaster relief team already in Yerevan requested more
kidney dialysis machines Monday, the organization's Brussels office
contacted the Soviet Embassy and Aeroflot, notorious for delayed
flights and poor service. Arrangements were completed in one day,
with visas issued in hours.
   ``I think it's the enormity of the catastrophe,'' said Stephan
Van Praet, the team's leader, noting that the Soviets have been very
cooperative.
   But Van Praet said he was concerned the kidney dialysis machines
might be damaged because they sat aboard the parked plane for hours

   Eighteen citizen groups urged the Department of
Energy on Wednesday to develop and make public a comprehensive
assessment of environmental safety at the government's beleaguered
nuclear weapons production and research facilities.
   The groups, led by the Natural Resources Defense Council,
released a letter to Energy Secretary John S. Herrington urging
preparation of a ``programmatic environmental impact statement'' on
the entire complex, which involves 17 facilities employing some
100,000 people in 12 states.
   ``It is time to take the wraps off what has been in effect the
Department of Energy's `stealth' program and to compel meaningful
public scrutiny of its plans for the complex,'' said Dan W. Reicher,
an attorney for the council.
   Another attorney for the Washington-based group, Jacob Scherr,
told a news conference that ``we have seen a pattern of
mismanagement, excessive secrecy, deceit, illegality and neglect.''
   He asserted that ``at the heart of this crisis lies a growing
lack of public trust in our nation's nuclear weapons builders.
Fundamental questions are being raised _ and rightly so _ about the
capabilities and credibility of the Department of Energy to manage,
oversee and ensure the safety of this vast enterprise.''
   A DOE spokeswoman, Christina Sankey, said the department had no
immediate comment because officials had not yet seen the letter.
   The move came one day after the NRDC and two other groups filed
suit to compel the Energy Department to prepare an environmental
impact statement on its sprawling Savannah River plant in South
Carolina, before any of the three weapons reactors there can be
restarted.
   Savannah River is the only DOE facility capable of producing
tritium, a radioactive isotope of hydrogen vital to boosting the
explosive yield of nuclear warheads. Because tritium decays at a
rate of 5.5 percent a year, it needs to be replenished regularly.
   The head of an Energy Department advisory committee said
Wednesday that the panel is not supporting DOE's plan to restart one
of the reactors _ called the K reactor _ at Savannah River because
of continuing safety concerns. The restart is tentatively scheduled
for next summer.
   John F. Ahearne, chairman of the Advisory Committee on Nuclear
Facilities Safety, said the panel's position is stated in a letter
expected to be sent to Herrington later this week.
   ``The overall gist of the letter ... is that we're essentially
declining to endorse the restart strategy. ... We think it is
insufficient to be used as the basis to go ahead and restart,''
Ahearne said in an interview.
   Problems identified by the advisory panel, he said, include the
DOE plan's failure to include ultrasonic testing for potentially
dangerous reactor piping cracks and insufficient attention to
bolstering the Savannah River reactors so they can better withstand
earthquakes.
   In both instances the citizen groups demanding action by DOE
invoked the 1969 National Environmental Policy Act, which requires
environmental impact statements for any ``major federal action
significantly affecting the quality of the human environment.''
   Several members of Congress, in a separate letter to Herrington,
endorsed the call for a programmatic environmental study of the
weapons complex. They included Sens. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., and
Timothy E. Wirth, D-Colo., along with Reps. Les AuCoin, D-Ore.;
Albert Bustamante, D-Texas; Mike Synar, D-Okla.; Ron Wyden, D-Ore.;
Bill Green, R-N.Y., and Claudine Schneider, R-R.I.
   The citizen groups, in their letter to Herrington, noted that
``the nuclear warhead production complex is at a major crossroads in
its 40-year history.''
   Activities planned by DOE include ``construction of a variety of
new production facilities, major renovations across the complex,
decommissioning and decontamination of scores of facilities, and
cleanup of hundreds of waste sites,'' the letter said.
   It cited press reports that a classified DOE study expected to be
sent shortly to Congress will propose spending $50 billion over the
next 20 years for various renovation and upgrade programs.
   In addition to the Natural Resources Defense Council, other
groups joining in the letter were:
   Citizen Alert, Citizens Against Rocky Flats Contamination, Energy
Research Foundation, Environmental Action, Environmental Policy
Institute, Government Accountability Project, Greenpeace, Hanford
Education Action League, National Taxpayers Union, Northwest
Environmental Advocates, Northwest Nuclear Safety Campaign,
Palouse-Clearwater Hanford Watch, Physicians for Social
Responsibility, Puget Sound SANE, Sierra Club, Snake River Alliance
and Washington Physicians for Social Responsibility.

<HEAD>Text of U.S. Delegate at U.N. General Assembly on Palestine</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GENEVA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Here is the text of the statement by Ambassador
Vernon Walters, the chief U.S. delegate to the United Nations, at
the U.N. General Assembly's special session on Palestine on
Wednesday.
   The search for peace in the Middle East has been a constant
feature of United States policy. American efforts helped bring about
the disengagement of forces agreement between Israel and Egypt, and
between Israel and Syria. American efforts helped bring about the
Camp David accords and the Egyptian-Israeli Peace Treaty. The United
States remains an active, committed partner in the search for a
comprehensive settlement achieved through negotiations.
   In helping willing parties negotiate their differences, the
United States has always kept in mind a simple, but abiding reality
_ namely, that no outside party can want peace more than the parties
themselves want and need peace. As such, the United States has
always opposed efforts to impose solutions from the outside,
concentrating instead on eliciting movement from the parties on the
critical issues involved in the negotiations. It is for these
reasons that the United States will vote against the resolutions
submitted during this debate.
   In seeking to advance the prospects for negotiations leading to a
comprehensive settlement, this year the United States advanced a set
of proposals that represent the core requirements of a successful
process of accommodation:
   _The objective is a comprehensive settlement of the Arab-Israeli
conflict through negotiations.
   _There is no substitute for direct negotiations between the
parties concerned. The parties to negotiations must accept to
negotiate with each other.
   _An international conference may be useful insofar as it helps
launch and support direct negotiations, but a conference must not
preempt or substitute for the direct negotiations.
   _The United Nations Security Council established the basis of the
negotiating process in Resolutions 242 and 338. Each party may have
other positions and preferences that it wishes to bring to
negotiations, consistent with 242 and 338, but none can limit or
avoid accepting 242 and 338 as the basis of negotiations.
   _Negotiations must proceed in an atmosphere free of terrorism,
violence and intimidation.
   These are valuable and enduring principles that need to be at the
core of efforts to resolve the dispute. Additionally there should be
a period of transition between the status quo and a final
settlement. This transitional period will help build confidence
among the parties that negotiations work. It will give the parties
time to adjust to a new situation. It will allow the parties to deal
with each other differently, gradually, in light of an agreement
freely negotiated.
   Movement toward peace starts with movement by the parties. Each
side needs to adopt constructive policies aimed at realistic and
pragmatic progress toward peace.
   For Israel, the choice is clear, albeit difficult. In order to
achieve the security it deserves and requires, Israel must face up
to the need for withdrawal from occupied territories and to the need
to accommodate legitimate Palestinian political rights. The extent,
shape and form of these issues need to be hammered out through
negotiations, but they must be addressed squarely.
   For Palestinians, the choice is equally clear, and equally
difficult. In order to achieve the legitimate political rights they
deserve and require, Palestinian demands will have to accommodate
the reality of Israel's existence and security needs, and they will
have to commit themselves to negotiations with Israel.
   For the other Arabs, the choices are equally important. Jordan,
Syria and Lebanon have a conflict with Israel to resolve through
negotiations. Their conflict will not be solved otherwise. Other
Arab states can help by sending signals of acceptance and
reconciliation to Israel. They must talk to Israel. The absence of
dialogue means continued stalemate.
   For outside parties, support and encouragement are the necessary
elements. A role for outside parties in peace making is not a right,
it must be earned. It is time for the Soviet Union to restore full
diplomatic relations with Israel. It is time for the Peoples
Republic of China to recognize Israel. The parties need support to
bring them together, and the international community can provide
that support.
   These fundamental elements of a successful peace process can be
encouraged through accommodations and reconciliation between
Israelis and Palestinians. This is not an easy task to accomplish.
It is very difficult for the parties to overcome prejudices and
blind spots about each other, it is sometimes equally difficult for
the international community to lay aside political differences and
expediencies and to adopt a realistic course toward a comprehensive
settlement. But the international community must speak with a
realistic, pragmatic voice.
   We must tell the parties that their dispute is resolvable. We
must tell them that we are tired of this conflict and tired of their
unwillingness to make fair compromises. We must tell them the time
has come to agree that a negotiated settlement is required.
   So let us channel the energy that has gone into this debate in a
positive, realistic direction. Unbalanced resolutions are not the
answer. One-sided statements are not the answer.
   The answer is commitment to comprehensive peace. The answer is
negotiations based on Security Council Resolutions 242 and 338. The
answer is renunciation of violence and terrorism. My government
stands ready as always to assist in moving ahead in the search for
peace.''

   A faked car accident nearly covered up a
strangulation, say police, who now have the victim's husband in jail
on first-degree murder charges.
   A county medical examiner originally ruled Dawn Mancini, 27, died
of injuries from a Nov. 15 car accident, but the doctor said he knew
a police investigation was continuing and did not authorize the
hospital to release the body.
   Paul Mancini, 28, of Merrimack, is being held pending a
preliminary hearing Friday.
   Police would not say Tuesday what aroused their suspicions
following the late-night accident in Amherst. But according to a
police affidavit released earlier, tire marks contradicted Mancini's
story that he crashed after swerving to avoid a deer.
   ``I think that without some good work by the Amherst police and
by Dr. (Roger) Fossum, really, it's quite possible this would not
have come to light,'' Assistant Attorney General Steven Winer said
Tuesday.
   Dr. Jonathan Shaw, the Hillsborough County medical examiner who
examined the body, agreed in a telephone interview Tuesday that the
error would have gone undetected had it not been for a call from the
Amherst police reporting their suspicions.
   ``If the police hadn't called, then I think an error would have
been committed,'' Shaw said. ``On the other hand, the police did
their job.''
   The police call led to an autopsy by Fossum, the state's medical
examiner and a forensic pathologist.
   Shaw said he signed the certificate with the investigation in
progress because he wanted the body to be released promptly if the
probe yielded nothing suspicious.
   ``These are family tragedies, ordinarily, and there is often the
impulse to try not to hold things up for the families,'' said Shaw.
   He noted that while Fossum is a forensic pathologist, the county
medical examiners generally are not, serving part-time while they
practice in their own specialties.
   ``The rest of us are volunteers, so to speak,'' he said.
   Fossum agreed.
   ``To me, every death is a murder until proved otherwise,'' he
said. The other examiners are generally surgeons and ``are not
trained that way.''
   Fossum said he spotted pinpoint hemorrhages on the woman's face
and in the whites of the eyes, a sign of asphyxiation.
   ``I believe he noted them, but he wasn't quite sure what they
meant,'' Fossum said of Shaw. ``Within his context, they were part
of the accident. It's my job to think dirty.''
   Fossum's report said he also found bruises and what appeared to
be fingernail marks on her neck.

   An unemployed welder pleaded innocent
Wednesday in the knifepoint abduction and rape of a woman that took
place in the same area where the bodies of six women have been
discovered since July.
   The brief arraignment took place in a courtroom packed with
spectators and reporters stirred by the possible connection between
the attack and what is believed to be serial killings in the area.
But authorities stressed they had not established a link.
   Neil Anderson, 35, was arrested at his New Bedford home Tuesday
in an investigation triggered by a newspaper interview with his
alleged victim. He was charged with aggravated rape, kidnapping, and
assault and battery with a dangerous weapon. Bail was set at $20,000.
   ``Anderson has been charged with three offenses and that's all
he's been charged with and the investigation is ongoing,'' said
Thomas Gibney, a spokesman for Bristol County District Attorney
Ronald A. Pina. ``The search is still on, and investigators are
still running down leads.''
   Gibney said investigators have interviewed a list of suspects in
connection with the deaths of six women whose partially clad remains
have been found in a six- to eight-mile radius along Interstate 195
and Route 140 in Dartmouth and Freetown. He declined Wednesday to
say whether Anderson, who officials also said has worked as a
truckdriver, had been among those questioned.
   Pina has said he believed the six killings, the oldest of which
dates to the spring, were likely the victims of the same killer or
killers and that the victims all had ties to New Bedford's Weld
Square neighborhood, known for prostitution and drugs.
   ``He has been charged with only one crime. I think that to try to
link that to any other events is very unfair,'' said James M. Quinn,
the public defender representing Anderson.
   Judge John A. Markey scheduled a pretrial hearing Dec. 21 in New
Bedford District Court. Anderson will also appear at that time on
charges of assault and battery with a deadly weapon in an
``unrelated fight,'' Quinn said.
   Records show that Anderson, a divorced father of two who lives
with his mother and grandmother, was convicted in 1974 of assault
and battery and in 1981 of attempted breaking and entering.
   Authorities arrested Anderson 10 days after The Standard-Times of
New Bedford published an interview with a woman who accused him of
driving her against her will to a secluded area of Dartmouth and
raping her at knifepoint along Interstate 195.
   ``Anderson allegedly sought the victim out (after the interview
appeared) and followed her in a van, glaring in her direction,''
Markey said in a written statement released after the arraignment.
``She was able to get the license number. He was also identified by
a witness to the above event.''
   The woman, reportedly a former prostitute, identified Anderson's
photograph in a lineup on Dec. 8. She said she had not initially
gone to police out of fear no one would believe her.
   State police dogs and a trained dog from Connecticut continued
their search Wednesday for more victims in woods outside of New
Bedford, where the bodies have been found.

   Federal revenue agents said Wednesday they
are giving 4,400 pounds of sugar from a moonshine raid to an
orphanage, just in time for the chef to make extra holiday sweets
for the children.
   ``It couldn't be timed better,'' said Bobby Cobbs, a spokesman at
Virginia Baptist Children's Home and Family Services in Salem.
``Normally, families do a lot of baking at Christmas time that they
wouldn't do at any other time of the year. We'll go through this
sugar rather quickly. We've been doing a lot of dreaming, figuring
out what we can do with it.''
   U.S. District Judge James C. Turk filed an order on Wednesday
that will allow the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms to
dispose of the Dixie Crystal sugar, along with 100 pounds of wheat
bran, two pounds of yeast and 576 one-gallon jugs seized this fall
in a moonshine investigation.
   Defendants William Gray Stanley, Ricky Lee Dent and Michael Keith
Crook are to be tried Jan. 18 on charges of illegally running a
still and possessing mash and untaxed liquor. Lawyers reached an
agreement that will let the government use its sugar as evidence
even though it will have been given to the orphans.
   The federal agent in charge of the Roanoke bureau, Jim Silvey,
said federal authorities wanted to put the sugar to use instead of
letting it go to waste in a storage bin.
   ``What we've done in the past is dispose of it in the federal
penitentiaries, but the closest one is in West Virginia,'' Silvey
said. ``We figured if the moonshine was in Virginia, we could use it
here. We just wanted to do something with it other than let it get
hard. It wouldn't be fit for human consumption if it gets critters
in it.''
   The sugar will be turned over to orphanage workers Thursday.
   Cobbs said the orphanage has 72 children, with 10 to 20 expected
to stay there over the holidays as the others visit relatives. As a
general rule, the children have been taken from parents because of
such problems as sexual abuse.
   ``We call them `orphans of the living,' or `emotional orphans,'''
Cobbs said. ``For all intents and purposes, they are orphans,
although they have living parents.''
   The sugar, valued at about $1,500, will be quite a windfall for
the orphanage, which has an annual food budget of $106,000, Cobbs
said.

   A federal judge refused Wednesday to stop the
city from selling a house rebuilt on property where police attacked
and killed 11 members of the radical group MOVE.
   U.S. District judge Louis Pollak dismissed a lawsuit by Louise
James, who claimed the property still belonged to her.
   The row house is one of 61 rebuilt at a cost of more than $8
million after the city destroyed them with a bomb in a 1985 attempt
to evict MOVE members from their barricaded headquarters in Ms.
James' house.
   Ms. James, whose brother, MOVE founder John Africa, and her son,
Frank, died with nine others in the house, went to federal court
seeking a temporary restraining order to stop the city from selling
the building which has been unoccupied since it was rebuilt in
mid-1986.
   Pollak, noting Ms. James had accepted $2,000 plus $280 interest
13 months ago for the land her house stood on, said she waited too
long to file her lawsuit. He said the statute of limitations ran out
in June 1987.
   ``I am satisfied that the failure of a legal federal claim
requires me to dismiss the entire case,'' the judge said. ``The
request for a temporary restraining order falls by the wayside
because there is no controversy before me.''
   ``We can now proceed to sell the house which we intend to do,''
said City Solicitor Seymour Kurland.
   He said the case has nothing to do with whether Ms. James is
entitled to compensation, only whether she is entitled to the house.
   Kurland acknowledged that Ms. James' claim for compensation for
the burned down building is still alive, and that she is seeking $30
million.
   ``The amount she wants is ridiculous but it will eventually be
settled in court,'' he said, contending the value of the original
property was around $25,000 even though the cost to rebuild the
homes escalated to more than $125,000.
   Kurland said the judge's dismissal of Ms. James' claim will calm
fears of neighborhood residents who oppose return of MOVE, which
kept the area in turmoil for years before the fire.
   ``The neighbors who had been living in mortal fear that she'd
come back can now live in peace,'' Kurland said.
   Ms. James contended that selling the house would cause her
irreparable harm and deprive her of her constitutional right to her
property.
   MOVE was a self-styled religious organization that declined to
abide by city laws, including those involving sanitation, and used
threats and sometimes violence to harass neighbors.
   Federal and city grand juries declined to indict anyone,
including Mayor W. Wilson Goode who ordered the bomb dropped, in the
deaths of the 11 MOVE members, five of them children.
   Goode took responsibility but insisted his action wasn't criminal.
   Ms. James has branded the mayor ``a murderer'' and continues to
demand that he and the former police and fire commissioners, also
involved in the decision, be prosecuted.

   The Soviet Union has notified the United States
it is destroying radar facilities at Gomel that President Reagan
told Congress violated a superpower arms control treaty, the State
Department said Wednesday.
   However, the installation at Krasnoyarsk remains in dispute.
Department spokesman Charles E. Redman again called for its
destruction.
   Redman said the United States would not reciprocate for the
Soviet decision on Gomel. ``A violation is a violation,'' he said.
   Reagan claimed in his report to Congress last week that portable
equipment had been moved to the Byelorussian city in violation of
the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty. The treaty limits U.S. and
Soviet radar on the theory a nuclear attack is less likely to be
launched if devastating retaliation would follow.
   Redman said destruction of the Gomel radar ``when fully carried
out and verified will satisfy our concerns regarding the illegal
deployment of these radars.''
   The Soviets informed the United States that destruction of the
Gomel installation began last Friday, according to a U.S. official
who spoke only on condition of anonymity.
   Redman said the Soviet decision underscored the importance of
continuing the Reagan administration's policy ``of firmness'' with
regard to Soviet treaty violations.
   ``However,'' Redman said, ``the more crucial issue of the Soviet
violation at Krasnoyarsk remains unresolved. The Krasnoyarsk radar
is a significant violation of a central element of the ABM treaty,
which will continue to make it impossible for the US to conclude any
future strategic arms agreements.''
   The two sides had agreed in Geneva last month to resume work on a
treaty o sharply reduce long-range nuclear bombers, missiles and
submarines.
   Redman rejected again a Soviet proposal to turn the Krasnoyarsk
installation in Siberia into an international space research
facility. ``It would not remove the treaty-prohibited radar
capability,'' he said. ``Nor would it restore the lead time'' the
Reagan administration contends Krasnoyarsk would provide for
mounting a defense against U.S. ballistic missiles.
   ``What the Soviets propose would allow them to move forward with
work on the illegal radar, with no guarantees that the
`international scientists' could not be expelled at a moment's
notice,'' Redman said.

   Yasser Arafat, the PLO chairman, today said he
renounces terrorism and insisted that his past statements mean he
recognizes the right of Israel to live in peace and security.
   His comments came at a news conference one day after U.S.
officials said his speech Tuesday before the U.N. General Assembly
did not meet U.S. conditions for accepting the PLO in peace
negotiations.
   Those conditions are explicit recognition of Israel, renunciation
of terrorism and agreement with U.N. resolutions 242 and 338.
   ``I repeat for the second time that we totally and absolutely
renounce all forms of terrorism, including individual terrorism,
group and the state terrorism,'' he said of the Palestine Liberation
Organization.
   He said he made clear Tuesday the PLO accepts ``the right of all
parties concerned in the Middle East complex to exist in peace and
security, and as I have mentioned including the state of Palestine,
Israel and other neighbors.''
   He said the PLO accepts U.N. Resolutions 242 and 338, which call
for Israeli withdrawl from occupied lands and acceptance of the
right of all states in the Middle East to safe and secure borders.
   But Arafat showed impatience over a question asking him to say
``yes'' or ``no'' on whether the accepts Israel
   ``Didn't you read my statement?'' he asked. ``It's entirely
clear. What do you want? Do you want me to do a strip tease? It
would be unseemly.''
   Earlier today, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, Vernon
Walters, urged Israel to recognize the need to withdraw from the
territories it occupies and to accommodate legitimate Palestinian
political rights.
   The comment came in a speech by Walters that never explicitly
mentioned the PLO or Arafat. The speech reiterated longstanding U.S.
policy calling for Israel's withdrawal from occupied lands for peace
with its Arab neighbors.
   Earlier today, the Israeli delegate said the PLO remains
committed to the elimination of the Jewish state and can never be a
negotiating partner for it.
   Walters said there is ``no substitute for direct negotiations''
between the parties in the Middle East conflict and did not rule out
the PLO as participant. Palestinians, he said, ``will have to commit
themselves to negotiations with Israel.''
   Apparently responding to Arafat's call for an international
Middle East peace conference, Walters said such a meeting ``may be
useful insofar as it helps launch and support direct negotiations''
but cannot not substitute for them. ``We must tell them (the parties
involved) that we are tired of this conflict and tired of their
unwillingness to make fair compromises,'' he said.
   Before Walters spoke, Israel's U.N. ambassador, Johanan Bein,
said ``vague phraseology'' of the PLO's declaration of statehood
``cannot hide the PLO's commitment to the common denominator that
unites all its factions: the path of rejection, violence and
terror.''
   Therefore, Bein said, the ``PLO can never be a negotiating
partner'' with Israel. Several members of the PLO delegation walked
out during Bein's speech.
   Bein also made no reference to Arafat's speech, in which the PLO
leader appealed for direct, U.N.-supervised talks with Israel and
presented a three-stage ``peace initiative.''
   Arafat asked Israel and other nations ``to come here, under the
sponsorship of the United Nations, so that together we can forge
that peace.''
   Arafat's peace initiative called for starting with ``a serious
effort'' under U.N. guidance to set up an international Middle East
peace conference.
   He proposed that ``occupied Palestinian land'' be placed under
U.N. supervision, with an international force deployed to protect
the Palestinians and oversee withdrawal of Israeli troops. He did
not specify whether he was referring only to the West Bank and Gaza,
occupied by Israel in 1967.
   But Arafat upset some when he paid tribute to the yearlong
Palestinian uprising in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza
Strip. At least 323 Palestinians and 13 Israelis have died in the
revolt.
   The U.S. State Department said Arafat failed to recognize
explicitly Israel's right to exist, a Washington precondition for
recognizing the PLO.
   The State Department tried through public and private diplomacy
to persuade the PLO to renounce terrorism in all forms and expand on
its declaration of independence last month by explicitly recognizing
Israel's right to exist.
   On the issue of terrorism, Arafat said: ``I, as chairman of the
Palestine Liberation Organization, hereby once more declare that I
condemn terrorism in all its forms.'' But he immediately added he
also was saluting ``those sitting before me who, in the days when
they fought to free their countries from the yoke of colonialism,
were accused of terrorism by their oppressors, and who today are the
faithful leaders of their peoples.''

<TEXT>
   A nationwide strike called by communist and
socialist unions paralyzed Spain on Wednesday, halting work at major
industries, closing state offices and choking public transportation
to a trickle.
   Union leaders called Spain's first general strike in 54 years a
``complete success.'' Police reported sporadic violence and made at
least 30 arrests.
   ``The government has to bow to the evidence and accept with
elegance the fact that this strike has been a total success,'' said
Anton Saracibar, second in command of the socialist General Workers
Union.
   Jose Manuel de la Parra, spokesman for the Communist-dominated
Workers Commissions, said the strike succeeded ``beyond our greatest
expectations.''
   Parra and Saracibar estimated 7.8 million of 11.8 million
employed Spaniards stayed away from work to protest government
austerity measures.
   Government spokesman Miguel Gil said the strike call had been
heeded by ``a large sector of the population and has caused a
significant impact on labor activity, although in varying degrees in
different sectors.''
   The three major business associations accused union picketers of
``strong-armed tactics'' to force small businesses and offices to
close after they opened Wednesday.
   Socialist leader Jose Maria Benegas said people stayed away out
of fear and intimidation. Madrid's Socialist Mayor Juan Barranco
said people had to admit the strike succeeded in keeping most of the
city's 4 million people at home.
   General Motors spokesman Rafael Casas said only 250
administrative employees showed up at their Opel plant, which
employs 9,100 in Zaragoza.
   Spanish national railways spokeswoman Alicia Acebes said 7
percent of the company's 54,000 employees showed up in accordance
with minimum service agreements.
   In an unusual action binding them for the first time since Spain
returned to democracy 11 years ago, the General Workers' Union and
the Workers Commissions called the strike to force Prime Minister
Felipe Gonzalez' 6-year-old government to change its economic
policies and meet demands for wage increases, unemployment benefits
and pensions.
   The unions claim large groups among Spain's 38 million people
have not benefited from an economic boom that reversed once stagnant
growth rate to 5 percent a year and dropped inflation nine points to
5.1 percent.
   But this has not dented Spain's 18.7 percent unemployment rate,
the highest in Europe.
   In Barcelona, the country's second largest city, police said some
55,000 strikes marched in festive mood Wednesday evening.
   Thousands of demonstrators also marched peacefully in Vigo,
Gijon, Bilbao, Oviedo, Vitoria and Valencia.
   Unions called a similar march for Friday in Madrid.
   Gonzalez told a news conference Wednesday that he would not call
early elections because of the strike. General elections are due in
1990.
   Recent polls indicate if elections were held now, the Socialists
would win another majority. Polls also indicate 45 percent of
Spaniards felt the call for a general strike was justified.

   The health minister on Wednesday defended the
Soviet response to the Armenian earthquake, but said specially
trained emergency relief teams still must be set up to respond to
future such disasters.
   The Soviet Union needs to establish a special system of
helicopters, planes, mobile hospitals and personnel, said Health
Minister Yevgeny Chazov.
   Asked at a news conference about a report carried on official
Radio Moscow, Chazov denied he had said the response to the
earthquake showed the ``complete bankruptcy'' of Soviet civil
defense.
   The official Moscow News weekly also sharply criticized the lack
of an emergency force for dealing with disasters in the wake of the
Dec. 7 Armenian earthquake that has killed at least 55,000 people
   It said the Chernobyl nuclear power plant explosion and several
major railroad accidents had proven the need for such a force.
   ``We are thankful to all who flew in from abroad to save those
who were suffering in Armenia,'' Moscow News said. ``But we cannot
reconcile ourselves to the fact that our professionals did not
arrive on the scene of the disaster before them.''
   Chazov has been a serious critic of the quality of Soviet health
care, but he said medical services responded well to the emergency.
   The centralized Soviet system was able to quickly move doctors
and nurses into place, even though there was no specially trained
and ready force, he added.
   However, he said, ``I think we have to have a better effort of
channeling our efforts in specific directions.''
   Doctors conducted complicated operations in field conditions or
even in the open air during the first hours after the earthquake, he
said.
   More than 9,150 people were hospitalized, including almost 4,500
who are in Yerevan hospitals now and 275 of the most severely
injured people who have been sent to Moscow.
   Chazov said 242 people had died in Yerevan hospitals and eight
others had died in Moscow.

<HEAD>British Asks Ireland to Review Extradition Act</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Britain on Wednesday urged the
Irish government to review its extradition laws during a chilly
meeting following Ireland's refusal to extradite a priest suspected
of terrorism.
   In London, British officials said they were considering an Irish
request for evidence to prosecute the Roman Catholic priest, Patrick
Ryan, at a non-jury trial.
   In the House of Commons, British Attorney General Sir Patrick
Mayhew said the Irish decision not to extradite Ryan on grounds he
would not get a fair trial in Britain was ``regrettably offensive.''
   The clash over Ryan and British anger at what some officials see
as Irish government reluctance to extradite Irish Republican Army
suspects overshadowed a regularly scheduled meeting between
officials in Belfast.
   Northern Ireland Secretary Tom King, the top British official in
the province, said after the six-hour meeting that the Irish
government ``gave the undertaking that they would review the
operation of the (extradition) act and we shall now be requesting
them to do that.''
   The meeting was called as part of a review of the operations of
the 1985 Anglo-Irish Agreement, which gave Dublin a consultative say
in the British administration of Protestant-dominated Northern
Ireland.
   King dismissed speculation that Britain might scrap the accord
because of the present crisis, saying it was especially important as
a forum for the ``sort of blunt speaking that we did have today.''
   King met at Stormont Castle, his administrative headquarters,
with Irish foreign minister Brian Lenihan.
   Protestant politicians, long opposed to the agreement, said the
Ryan affair showed the accord wasn't working and demanded that it be
scrapped.
   Ryan, 58, was arrested in Brussels in June with a forged passport
and manuals on bomb-making. Belgium sent him back to Ireland Nov. 25
after he began a hunger strike to protest being extradited to
Britain.
   The Belgian government said the British extradition warrants were
too vague. They alleged conspiracy to murder and cause explosions,
and illegal possessing explosives unlawfully and with intent to
endanger life.
   Ryan has denied he was a member and fund-raiser for the outlawed
IRA, which is fighting to unite Northern Ireland with the
overwhelmingly Catholic Irish Republic.
   Irish Attorney General John Murray said Tuesday that Ryan would
not be extradited because British politicians and newspapers had
prejudiced the court case by attacking the priest ``in intemperate
language and ... extravagantly worded headlines.''
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher on Tuesday called the Irish
announcement ``a great insult to all of the people of this country.''
   Britain has complained that the Irish Republic has unilaterally
stiffened extradition reqiuirements by stipulating approval by the
attorney general, not by the courts.
   Ryan could be prosecuted in the republic under a 1976 law which
allows suspects to be tried in either country for some crimes
committed in the other. But he could not be tried on two of the
charges, conspiracy to murder and unlawful possession of explosives.
   Ryan, who is at an undisclosed place in the Irish Republic with a
religious order, has said if he were arraigned under this act he
would start another fast.
   Irish Prime Minister Charles Haughey's handling of the Ryan
affair has helped boost his popularity to a record 62 percent in an
Irish Times poll published Monday.

   A teen-ager convicted Wednesday of killing
a state lawmaker after the legislator left a late-night poker game
was described as ``a frightened young boy.''
   The testimony came as a jury was meeting to decide whether
18-year-old Bernard Williams should receive the death penalty or
life imprisonment after it found him guilty in the slaying and
robbery of Rep. William Telek, whose body was dumped on a suburban
street early on May 17. Williams was arrested later that day driving
Telek's car.
   The jury reached the verdict after six hours of deliberations
over two days.
   Telek was last seen alive in the Capitol garage by a friend who
dropped him off at his car following the poker game at a fellow
lawmaker's apartment, prosecutors said. The case prompted a review
of security at the Capitol.
   Prosecutors said Williams beat Telek in the head with a hammer,
dumped his body in the middle of a suburban Harrisburg street and
stole about $100 and the lawmaker's car. Police found the hammer in
Williams' bedroom.
   Williams testified he took the car from an acquaintance and found
the hammer in the car.
   As jurors weighed whether to impose the death sentence,
psychologist Stanley Schneider of Harrisburg said Williams presents
a false front of bravado but ``behind that is a frightened young
boy.''
   He said Williams was isolated and rejected during his life, which
included 13 or 14 stops in foster homes or detention centers.
Schneider said Williams was put in a foster-care program when he was
9, after a sibling was killed by one of his parents.
   After the verdict was announced, Williams' mother, Christine,
left the courtroom, sobbing.
   ``In my heart, I know he is innocent,'' she said. ``If that man
wasn't a state representative, you all wouldn't be here. I
sympathize with Mrs. Telek, but my son was not the killer.''
   Telek's wife, Leona Lee, left the courtroom surrounded by friends
and relatives and did not comment to reporters.
   Senate President Pro Tem Robert Jubelirer said, ``It's certainly
not a happy day. It simply highlights the tragedy of the situation,
when a very decent man was brutally murdered. I'm looking forward to
putting this behind us.''

<HEAD>U.S. Vetos Resolution Against Israeli Raid Into Lebanon</HEAD>

   The United States on Wednesday vetoed a
Security Council resolution deploring Israel's raid last week on a
Palestinian base camp in Lebanon in which an Israeli officer and
nine guerrillas died.
   Israel launched the raid Friday on the camp in the coastal town
of Naameh, nine miles south of Beirut, then mounted a massive air,
land and sea barrage to rescue four Israeli soldiers trapped by the
guerrillas.
   The draft resolution vetoed by the United States deplored the
attack, called on Israel to withdraw from all occupied Lebanese
territory, and to refrain from other attacks.
   Israel controls a six- to nine-mile-wide strip of Lebanese
territory along the border. The Israelis say they need to police the
zone to prevent Palestinian guerrillas from launching attacks into
Israel.
   U.S. Ambassador Patricia M. Byrne, the third-ranking diplomat at
the U.S. Mission, said the United States opposed the draft
resolution ``because it criticizes the actions of one party while
ignoring the attacks and reprisals that have originated on the other
side of the border.
   ``This resolution would deny to Israel its inherent right to
defend itself,'' she said.
   ``So long as extremist elements continue to use the area for
launching hostile attacks against Israel, southern Lebanon will not
enjoy stability,'' Miss Byrne added.
   Lebanese Ambassador Rachid Fakhoury told the council that
``mind-boggling details about the Israeli attack have been
revealed.''
   He said Israeli forces used dogs strapped with explosives and
tear gas canisters in last week's attack on guerrillas of the
Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General Command, an
extremist faction that opposes Yasser Arafat's mainstream Palestine
Liberation Organization.
   He said that since Israel attaches no importance to non-Israelis,
``how then could it be expected to give any importance or show any
mercy to animals?''
   Popular Front commander Ahmed Jibril said Friday the Israelis
used the dogs to flush the guerrillas out of their underground
tunnel network.
   The Israeli government had no comment on the Palestinian and
Lebanese reports of the methods used in the raid on Naameh.
   Israeli Ambassador David Matnai said his country's only
motivation was ``to protect its population from repeated attacks
emanating from Lebanese territory.''
   The Israeli ambassador alleged Popular Front guerrillas had sent
him a letter containing a bomb, but he did not say when.
   The resolution sponsored by the non-aligned nations drew 14
affirmative Security Council votes and no abstentions, but the
negative vote by the United States, a permanent member, was
sufficient to defeat it under council rules.
   The other permanent members of the Security Council are the
Soviet Union, France, Britain and China. The non-permanent council
members are Algeria, Argentina, Brazil, Italy, Japan, Nepal,
Senegal, West Germany, Yugoslavia and Zambia.

<BYLINE>`Clouds of Steel': Monument or Monstrosity?
^By JOHN ANTCZAK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It may be ``Clouds of Steel'' but it looks
like something that fell over. No, it looks like one of those
contraptions in a gravel quarry. No, it's an industrial pier. No,
it's art. No, it's ....
   Whatever it is, the design that won a competition for a proposed
multimillion-dollar West Coast Gateway monument leaves few observers
undecided about whether it would be a majestic answer to the Statue
of Liberty or a monstrous mishmash.
   The Gateway would be a scattering of structures shaped as
squares, cones and rectangles, containing museums, theaters, gardens
and aquariums, built over a downtown stretch of the Hollywood
Freeway to honor the city as the nation's center of modern
immigration.
   The design by Hani Rashid of New York and associate Lise Ann
Couture may be the latest rage in architecture _ deconstructivism _
or maybe not. But people know what they like and what they don't, no
matter what it's called.
   ``Los Angeles' answer to the Statue of Liberty ... belongs right
where much of its construction material will come from: the scrap
heap,'' said an editorial in the suburban Daily Breeze, Evening
Outlook and News Pilot.
   ``Brace yourself,'' radio station KNX editorialized. ``... Its
creators call it the West Coast Gateway, L.A.'s answer to the Statue
of Liberty, a monument to immigration. KNX just calls it ugly, real
ugly.'''
   ``It is unbelievably hideous, grotesque and monstrous,'' wrote
Herald Examiner columnist Gordon Dillow. ``And it must be stopped.''
   The Los Angeles Times liked the design but didn't think it should
be built in the ``miserable'' four-block stretch atop the freeway.
   The designers ``have offered innovative concepts celebrating the
ethnic diversity of the nation, the cultural roots of the community
that has been enriched by that diversity, and the need to bring into
the Civic Center an exciting focal point that bears witness to this
heritage as well as the vitality of contemporary life,'' the Times
said.
   ``Clouds of Steel'' was selected by a jury from 150 entries in a
competition initiated by Mayor Tom Bradley. The mayor has not made
any comment on the choice since it was announced Dec. 6.
   Nick Patsaouras, chairman of the Gateway project, on Wednesday
agreed that the mayor should leave such matters to his cultural
affairs commissioners and he criticized two City Council members who
had negative reactions.
   ``How can you express an opinion on such a fundamental vision
from a copy of a picture without seeing the model, without talking
with the artist to see his vision?'' Patsaouras said.
   But the furor shows that people are taking it seriously and as a
debate over the future of Los Angeles, he said. ``It's a project
that entails passion. ... Every place I go people are discussing
it.''
   The structure would cost $33 million but that does not include
other costs such as leasing airspace over the freeway from the state
Department of Transportation. Patsaouras had no estimates for any of
the other costs.
   The committee will begin seeking funding from private donors at
the beginning of the new year, he said. He hopes to have plans,
permits and construction on the first of four phases under way in 1{
to two years.
   Critics have pointedly noted that the designers are from New York.
   The suburban papers called it a ``meaningless pile of scrap'' and
suggested that funding for the ``praying mantis-like monstrosity,
designed by two New Yorkers'' could be better spent on housing and
food for the homeless.
   ``This atrocity was designed by New Yorkers, approved by an
elitist panel and will be financed by private donations,'' KNX said.
   The Gateway would contain an immigration museum, museums of the
Pacific and Atlantic oceans, the Park of Peace and Unity, a
performance theater called The Sphinx, a restaurant in a
construction called the Big Dipper, a Time Museum, sculpture garden,
a Musical Forest, liquid crystal display screens called Voices of
the People, a painting gallery, and a Food of the World section in
an area called the Little Dipper.
   Peter Frank, art critic for L.A. Weekly, had a positive initial
reaction but cautioned that the freeway site could hamper inevitable
design changes.
   ``I predict the whole thing will wind up less exciting (than)
it's proposed to be,'' he said.
   ``I think that it's a pretty exciting thing visually. I just hope
it's set up at a place where traffic tends to be slow so that it
doesn't cause any fender benders.''

   Iranians occupied the Iranian consulate and held
the consul and three other people hostage for five hours Wednesday
to demand an end to alleged repression in the Islamic nation, but
police stormed the building and arrested them, authorities said.
   A banner unfurled by the six occupiers read: ``10 Years of the
Islamic Republic. 10 Years of Famine and Torture.'' A masked man and
and another wearing a turban chanted ``Death to Khomeini!''
   The protesters, who live in various European cities, said they
belonged to the Organization of Fedayeen Guerillas of the Iranian
People, a Marxist group.
   They took the consul, two consular employees and another Iranian
captive, police said.
   Police stormed the third-floor consulate from adjacent windows,
arrested the six and confiscated an ax and a hammer, said police
spokesman Marcel Vaudroz. Two of those arrested later were released.
   Vuadroz said one police officer suffered foot injuries and a
consular employee was taken to the hospital with back pains.
   The group's spokesman, who declined to be identified, said the
protesters demanded an end to political executions in Iran, the
right to visit political prisoners in jail and an international
delegation to check the condition of political detainees.
   They also demanded a meeting with U.N Secretary-General Javier
Perez de Cuellar, who was in town for a U.N. General Assembly
session.

   Vietnam intends to return on Thursday what
could be the largest single group of remains of American servicemen
missing from the Vietnam War, the Pentagon said Wednesday.
   The Defense Department, in a statement, said the repatriation had
been scheduled in Hanoi and would include what the Vietnamese
believe were the remains of 38 individuals.
   The largest previous repatriation, which occurred in April,
totaled 27 individuals.
   The Vietnamese government also claims it will have other,
unspecified ``information'' to share with the United States about
the status of 12 additional cases of missing Americans, said Lt.
Col. Keith Schneider, a Pentagon spokesman.
   ``Arrangements have been made to receive the remains in Hanoi and
fly them to the U.S. Army Central Identification Laboratory in
Hawaii for subsequent evaluation in an effort to achieve individual
identification,'' the Pentagon said in its statement.
   ``The U.S. government appreciates the initiative taken by Vietnam
to repatriate these remains and hopes to continue the increasing
cooperation to resolve this long-standing issue.''
   The Pentagon said it had not received any information from
Vietnam on precisely where the various remains had been recovered or
the circumstances surrounding their discovery.
   Schneider added, however, that ``we understand the remains as
well as the information are related to incidents that occurred
(during the war) in the northern provinces.''
   ``That's all we know at this point,'' the spokesman said.
   Currently, 2,383 Americans continue to be listed as missing in
Indochina as a result of the Vietnam War, of whom 1,747 are listed
as missing in either North or South Vietnam.
   All told, the remains of 172 Americans have been repatriated to
the United States from Vietnam and subsequently identified by the
Army lab since the end of the war.
   The Pentagon, in its statement Wednesday, noted the upcoming
repatriation would be the seventh since a special presidential
mission was undertaken by retired Army Gen. John Vessey. The former
chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff went to Vietnam at President
Reagan's request in August 1987 with orders to seek greater
cooperation with the Vietnamese in resolving the cases of missing
Americans.
   In the past, remains repatriated by Vietnam occasionally have
included those of Vietnamese individuals. As a result, the Pentagon
routinely declines to predict whether all repatriated remains can be
individually identified by the Army laboratory in Honolulu.

   A 17-year-old boy was arrested after a predawn
bank heist Wednesday and police said he was part of a gang that has
been stealing coins from as many as 40 banks since July.
   Timothy Spurill of Brooklyn was charged with several counts of
burglary after officers found him in the vicinity of a smashed
window at a Manufacturers Hanover Bank in the borough of Queens,
said Officer Peter Phieffer.
   Spurill, who was suspected of acting as a lookout, had $30 in
coins in his pocket at the time of his arrest, Phieffer said.
   Police said two other suspects escaped. It was not known how much
money in coins were taken from the bank, police said.
   The three are believed to belong to a gang responsible for at
least 25 and as many as 40 similar heists at banks in Queens, said
Sgt. Thomas Delaney, head of the police-FBI Joint Bank Robbery Task
Force.
   Investigators estimate the gang averaged $1,000 in coins per
heist.
   Sometimes the burden of crime was too much for the gang to carry.
``At times they had problems getting it (the wrapped coins) out, and
they would leave it on the streets,'' Delaney said.
   Investigators said the robbery spree began in July, when the gang
staged three predawn bank heists in a week.
   ``They used a brick or a rock to smash the bank's plate glass
window,'' Delaney said, ``a very sophisticated means of entry.''
   Once the window was smashed ``they're in and out in 60 seconds,''
the sergeant said. ``They know in advance where they're going.''
   The gang specialized in stealing coins because ``that's all
that's in the bank at the time,'' since paper currency is usually
locked in vaults overnight, Delaney said. The coins were in tellers'
drawers that had to be jimmied open.
   The burglars would also take portable computers off bank
employee's desks if there weren't enough coins to carry, the
sergeant added.

   The State Department took a cautious stance
Wednesday on the possibility of a multimillion-dollar landmark home
being turned over as a gift for future secretaries of state to use
as their residence.
   ``If any such proposal were made to the department, we would need
to review it in the light of applicable law and policy,'' spokesman
Charles E. Redman said.
   Gwendolyn Cafritz, a Washington philanthropist and socialite who
died Nov. 29, had a provision in her will that her home could become
the official residence of the secretary of state, but an
appropriation bill sponsored by Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., might be a
barrier, said William P. Rogers, an executor of the estate.
   Mrs. Cafritz, who was 78, left the house on fashionable Foxhall
Road to the Morris and Gwendolyn D. Cafritz Foundation. Rogers said
the will was ``broad enough'' for the home to go to the secretary of
state or to be used as an adjunct to Blair House, the official
residence of prominent foreign visitors, or by scholars holding
seminars.
   Referring to the Helms bill, Rogers said by telephone from his
New York law office, ``It could be a problem.'' He said disposition
of the house was in a preliminary stage.
   The former secretary of state said ``nobody from the State
Department had anything to do with this. It's just what she wanted.
That was one of the possibilities that she had in mind.''
   Helms and his aides were out of town and could not be reached for
comment.
   Mrs. Cafritz's husband, Morris, died in 1964. He was a prominent
builder in the period when Washington was in the process of changing
from a small town to a high-powered city that is now one of the
world's most expensive cities to live in.
   The Cafritz house, a 1938 Art Moderne residence, is on a
seven-acre estate that is assessed for tax purposes at $3,567,650 by
the District of Columbia and could be worth considerably more.
   The appropriations bill passed by the Senate last December at the
urging of Helms contains a ban on honoraria for secretaries of state.

   Police arrested a suspect on Wednesday
in the assassination nearly three years ago of Prime Minister Olof
Palme, and news reports described him as a convicted killer with a
long criminal record.
   The arrest could be the first break in an investigation that has
been marred by internal squabbles and prompted accusations of
incompetence by parlimentary and independent commissions. No motive
or solid leads emerged despite the biggest manhunt in Swedish
history and an $8 million reward.
   Chief prosecutor Axel Morath decided to have the suspect formally
arrested after he was detained earlier Wednesday. He can be held for
two days and then either released or formally charged.
   During lengthy interrogation, the suspect denied he was the
person who shot Palme on Feb. 28, 1986, while the Swedish leader and
his wife were walking home from a movie without bodyguards, the
prosecutor said in a statement he read on on television.
   He said the man under arrest is ``reasonably suspected of having
committed the deed.'' Prosecutors and police refused to say why the
man is suspected or answer other questions on the case Wednesday.
   Under Swedish regulations, a suspect cannot be identified by name
even after charges are filed.
   Newspapers described the suspect as a man of 41 with a history of
violent crime, including a manslaughter conviction for stabbing a
drug addict to death with a bayonet in 1970 a few blocks from where
Palme was killed. State radio said he had been treated in a
psychiatric ward for dangerous criminals.
   The national news agency TT reported 63 offenses on the man's
record. It said witnesses were expected to be summoned to confront
the suspect, including Palme's widow, Lisbet, who was grazed by a
bullet in the attack.
   According to the media reports, the man was questioned and
released earlier in the investigation and came under renewed
suspicion when a new chief investigator, Hans Olvebro, took over the
inquiry 13 months ago and reopened old files for review.
   National radio said witnesses cast doubt on the man's assertion
he was in a nearby restaurant at the time of the shooting, and it
quoted the witnesses as saying he left earlier.
   He also has a limp, which fits accounts from witnesses that the
killer walked in a ``jerky'' way while following the Palmes for
several blocks after they left the theater, the radio reported. It
said he was detained at his home in the Sollentuna suburb and his
house was searched.
   Wednesday's arrest was the first movement reported in the case
since the former chief investigator, Hans Holmer, rounded up Kurdish
exiles two years ago and accused them of being part of an
international conspiracy. They were released without charges.
   The stalled case indirectly led to a political scandal this year
when ranking government officials approved an unofficial
investigation by publisher Ebbe Carlsson. Justice Minister
Anna-Greta Leijon was forced to resign.
   Palme, who served 11 years as prime minister in four terms, was a
controversial figure deeply involved in world disarmament issues and
served as a U.N.-appointed mediator in the Iran-Iraq war. He was the
first Swedish leader to die violently in two centuries.
   His murder was a severe jolt to a nation with a tendency to see
itself as immune to the terrorism, crime and assassination common in
other parts of the world.

<HEAD>Justice: Federal OSHA Law Doesn't Pre-empt State Job Safety Rules</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MATT YANCEY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   Employers whose workers are killed or injured
on the job can be prosecuted for murder, manslaughter or assault
under state laws and cannot seek refuge under federal workplace
safety laws, the Justice Department said in an opinion made public
Wednesday.
   The department, responding to a request from the House Government
Operations Committee, said criminal penalties in the 1970
Occupational Safety and Health Act do not pre-empt state and local
criminal laws.
   ``We see nothing in the (act) or its legislative history which
indicates that Congress intended for the relatively limited criminal
penalities provided by the act to deprive employees of the
protection provided by state criminal laws of general
applicability,'' the department said.
   The opinion, dated last Friday and released Wednesday by the
House panel's subcommittee on employment and housing, flies in the
face of several recent state court rulings throwing out criminal
convictions against employers whose workers were injured through
violations of federal job safety standards.
   Rep. Tom Lantos, D-Calif., the subcommittee's chairman, said he
welcomed what he called the ``long overdue'' statement dealing with
the issue.
   ``I am pleased that Justice agrees with us and squarely rejects
the position that the federal OSHA law shields employers who show
willful disregard for worker safety from state criminal
prosecution,'' Lantos said
   In a hearing before the subcommittee last February, prosecutors
from several states testified about indictments being dismissed and
convictions overturned because judges had ruled that the OSHA law
pre-empts state prosecution.
   Judges in Colorado, New York, Illinois, Texas and Michigan have
ruled that federal enforcement of safety standards pre-empts state
criminal prosecutions of employers. However, judges in Wisconsin
have ruled just the opposite.
   The issue is expected to reach the U.S. Supreme Court eventually,
possibly through a case now before the Illinois Supreme Court.
   In that case, Cook County prosecutors won indictments on criminal
charges of aggravated battery, reckless conduct and assault against
Chicago Magnet Wire Corp. and five of its officials for allegedly
exposing workers to phosgene and other toxic gases.
   However, before the case went to trial, the Illinois Appellate
Court dismissed the indictments as being a pre-emption of the
federal OSHA law.

<TEXT>
   Here is the text of a statement in English by
Yasser Arafat, chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organization, at
the opening of a press conference Wednesday:
   Let me highlight my views before you. Our desire for peace is a
strategy and not an interim tactic. We are bent to peace come what
may. Our statehood provides salvation to the Palestinians and peace
to both Palestinians and Israelis. Self-determination means survival
for the Palestinians. And our survival does not destroy the survival
of the Israelis as their rulers claim. Yesterday in my speech I made
a reference to the United Nations resolution 181 (on the partition
of Palestine) as the basis for Palestinian independence. I also made
a reference to our acceptance of resolutions 242 and 338 as the
basis for negotiations with Israel within the framework of an
international conference. These three resolutions were endorsed at
our Palestinian National Council session in Algiers.
   In my speech also yesterday it was clear that we mean our
peoples' right to freedom and national independence according to
resolution 181 and the right of all parties concerned in the Middle
East conflict to exist in peace and security and as I have mentioned
including the state of Palestine and Israel and other neighbors
according to the resolution 242 and 338.
   As for terrorism, I renounced it yesterday in no uncertain terms
and yet I repeat for the record that we totally and absolutely
renounce all forms of terrorism, including individual, group and
state terrorism. Between Geneva and Algiers we have made our
position crystal clear.
   Any more talk such as the Palestinians should give more _ you
remember this slogan, the Palestinians should give it more _ or it
is not enough, or the Palestinians are engaging in propaganda games
and public relations exercise will be damaging and counterproductive.
   Enough is enough. Enough is enough. Enough is enough. All
remaining matters should be discussed around the table and within
the international conference. Let it be absolutely clear that
neither Arafat nor any (one else) for that matter can stop the
intifadeh, the uprising. The intifadeh will come to an end only and
only when practical and tangible steps have been taken towards the
achievement of our national aims and the establishment of our
independent Palestinian state.
   In this context I expect the EEC (European Economic Community) to
play a more effective role in promoting peace in our region. They
have political responsibility, they have moral responsibility and
they can deal with it.
   Finally, I declare before you and I ask you to kindly quote me on
that: We want peace. We want peace. We are committed to peace. We
want to live in our Palestinian state and let live.

   Grieving relatives of an inmate who was
listed among the dead in a prison blaze were told he was alive in a
hospital as they gathered at a funeral home, a newspaper reported
Wednesday.
   The family was told Jesus Morales Sustaita was in serious
condition at the University Hospital.
   The charred body in the casket mistakenly had been identified as
Morales by his brother, who saw part of a tattoo on the man's chest,
the daily Monterrey newspaper El Norte reported.
   Relatives took the body to a funeral home and were mourning when
police informed them the 23-year-old inmate had been located at the
hospital, El Norte said.
   ``The family cheered up and forgot the other body, which was
returned to the morgue by the funeral home,'' the newspaper said.
   Three other prisoners also remain hospitalized in serious
condition from Tuesday's fire, which killed 19 inmates at the Nuevo
Leon state penitentiary. Authorities believe the blaze started when
a candle near an altar in a prison cell set a curtain on fire.
   Hospital spokesman Roberto Garza said Morales and the others were
in serious condition.
   Prisoners were allowed to set up shrines to the Virgin of
Guadalupe on Monday, a holiday honoring the patron saint of this
mostly Roman Catholic country.
   The University Hospital morgue Wednesday confirmed the death toll
stood at 19, although prison officials had earlier set it at 20,
including Morales.
   In another tragic twist, newspapers reported that Gilberto Valle
Coronado had been jailed on a first-offense charge of illegally
carrying a weapon, a three-inch knife, less than 24 hours before he
died in the fire. Valle had failed to come up with the $6.50 he
needed for bail, the report said.
   Officials said 116 prisoners were in the prison dormitory when
the fire broke out about 3 a.m. Tuesday. The ward was built for 70
prisoners.

   Former Sen. John Tower talked Wednesday with
President-elect Bush's legal adviser about the results of an
extensive FBI investigation into his background as transition aides
said the suspense over the Pentagon post could end this week.
   Bush told reporters he hasn't decided whether Tower will be the
new defense secretary but he was confident the former Texas senator
would do an excellent job ``if I decide to go that route.'' Bush
said he has not seen the FBI report.
   For weeks, Tower has been the rumored front-runner for the
Pentagon job but the post has remained vacant while the FBI
completed its investigation, which includes probing allegations of
womanizing and drinking that arose during Tower's 1987 divorce.
   Other areas of interest to the FBI were Tower's relationship with
defense contractors he represents as a private consultant, and his
use of campaign funds after he retired from the Senate in 1984.
   Craig Fuller, the transition's co-director, said the FBI ``has
just about concluded'' its probe. ``I would expect by the end of
this week we will reach a final conclusion about whether we can go
forward with a final recommendation,'' he said.
   Tower met with C. Boyden Gray, Bush's legal counsel, to discuss
the FBI's report. Gray said the probe hasn't been concluded, but
refused to say anthing further.
   Fuller said he and transition co-director Robert Teeter will
review the FBI's findings this week and then provide Bush with a
report. So far, there is nothing in the FBI investigation to
disqualify Tower, he said.
   Some members of Congress have said Tower's effectiveness, if he
is chosen, may be crippled by the lengthy selection process.
   But Fuller disputed that view, calling the FBI check prudent.
   ``You have to admire Sen. Tower's willingness to go through
this,'' Fuller said.
   Tower, a former chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee
and a one-time arms control negotiator in Geneva, Switzerland, is
known to want the Pentagon job, though he has not spoken out
publicly since speculation about his appointment began last month.
   Fuller also dispelled any notion that Tower would be denied a
hand in picking his top aides. Some reports indicated that Bush
intended to unveil an entire team of Defense Department officials at
the time he named the new secretary.
   ``I've heard the talk about the slate, but it didn't come from me
because there was never any determination made that we would present
to either Sen. Tower, should he be selected, or any other Cabinet
member, a complete slate of office-holders for the other positions
in the department,'' he said.
   Several people from industry are known to have rejected overtures
to serve in the No. 2 job at Defense, typically a post filled by a
manager. Among them are Paul O'Neill, the chief executive officer of
Alcoa, and Norman F. Augustine, the president of Martin-Marietta.

   British egg producers, whose sales have been hurt
by a salmonella poisoning scare, said Wednesday they will send up to
1 million surplus eggs to victims of the Armenian earthquake.
   One lawmaker called the gesture a ``poison chalice,'' but the Egg
Producers Association said the eggs were safe to eat.
   ``We feel we are helping in some small measure people who are
suffering a great deal at the moment,'' said Dennis Warren,
president of the association. ``We are satisfied from our own tests
that these eggs contain no salmonella.''
   Warren said demand for eggs in Britain has dropped 30 percent to
60 percent since Health Minister Edwina Currie said earlier this
month that most of the nation's eggs were tainted with salmonella.
   ``For us it's like the Wall Street crash,'' Warren said. ``We
would rather give these eggs away than dump them.''
   ``We asked the Russian Embassy what they thought of the idea and
they said they would welcome the eggs,'' he said. ``They are
arranging for the first load to go today.''
   Warren said he has donated 10,000 eggs from his farm and said
other producers would be donating a similar number.
   ``We are aiming to step this up and expect to send a million eggs
to Armenia within days,'' he said.
   George Foulkes, a foreign affairs spokesman for the opposition
Labor Party, said: ``This is the poison chalice ... It is something
of an insult to send to Armenia eggs which some people consider too
dangerous for home consumption.''
   Harry Greenway, a lawmaker in the governing Conservative Party,
called the donations ``a wretched irony.''
   ``It has the appearance of dumping on others what we are not
prepared to eat ourselves,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   Four years after contractors began
dismantling the nation's first commercial nuclear power plant, the
reactor vessel was hoisted from its underground site Wednesday for a
7,800-mile journey to a federal dump.
   The raising of the 1,000-ton reactor pressure vessel and
neutron-shield tank, packed with concrete, is the most dramatic,
although not necessarily the most critical, aspect of the five-year
decommissioning.
   The Shippingport Atomic Power Station, dedicated by President
Eisenhower in 1957, was retired in 1982 after generating about 6.5
billion kilowatts of electricity.
   Wednesday's big move was also the federal government's attempt to
prove that reactors can be dismantled safely and affordably,
providing a model procedure for utilities when their reactors have
outlived their usefulness.
   ``This really has been a demonstration for all of us,'' said
Karen Wheeless, spokeswoman for the Department of Energy, which owns
the Shippingport plant. ``You've got to take reactors from the
cradle to the grave. If you can't handle the burial, there's some
question of whether you should be handling a reactor at all.''
   The plant is the largest nuclear unit and only commercial reactor
in the world to be dismantled to date. Several nuclear plants have
been mothballed or entombed, including Peachbottom I in
Pennsylvania, Dresden I in Illinois and Indian Point I in New York.
   Even perfect success for the Shippingport operation won't solve
what is one of the biggest problems facing the commercial nuclear
power industry: what to do with highly radioactive waste.
   While waste from the federally owned Shippingport plant is going
to military dumps in Idaho and at Hanford, Wash., there is no place
to dispose of commercial high-level waste. A national repository for
spent fuel, which was to open in 1998, probably won't be available
until the next century, said Wheeless.
   ``This is a demonstration in terms of technology,'' she said.
``Where the fuel or the reactor pressure vessel go is not being
demonstrated. That has to be solved by the commercial nuclear
industry, and I think that's going to be one of the biggest issues
facing the United States.''
   Almost all of the 12,000 metric tons of spent uranium fuel from
private reactors is being stored in water-filled utility holding
ponds.
   The Energy Department estimates that 15 U.S. nuclear plants will
reach the end of their 30- to 40-year useful lives by the year 2000.
   The spent uranium fuel from the Shippingport reactor was removed
in 1984 and taken to a military dump in Idaho. Only low-level
radiation is left in the reactor, which poses no health risk,
spokesmen said.
   ``The radiation is trapped in the steel itself. The highly
radioactive stuff is gone,'' said Wheeless. ``Unless you attach it
to your body and wear it as an undergarment, there is no danger.''
   ``You get more radiation flying from Pittsburgh to Denver than
you would get standing next to the reactor,'' said Dan Butler,
another department spokesman.
   Federal officials say they intend to remove all radioactive
material so the Shippingport site, 30 miles northwest of Pittsburgh,
can be returned to unrestricted use. The decommissioning is expected
to be completed on schedule by 1990 at a cost of approximately $98
million.
   Officials estimate that at a rate of 25 feet per hour, it would
take about 10 hours to lift the reactor from the containment
building to a specially constructed flatbed transporter with 320
rubber tires. A special stationary crane was constructed to lift the
mammoth load.
   The reactor is composed of a pressure vessel with 8-inch thick
steel walls and an encompassing neutron shield with steel walls 1{
inches thick. Spaces within the assembly were filled with concrete
to stabilize it and further reduce radioactivity.
   The cylindrical reactor, 41 feet long, 30 feet high and 18 feet
in diameter, was lifted vertically 77 feet and was to be moved
horizontally, then lowered 47 feet onto the transporter.
   It will be rolled to the bank of the Ohio River and placed on a
200-foot-long barge in the spring and shipped via the Ohio,
Mississippi River, Gulf of Mexico, Panama Canal, Pacific Ocean and
Columbia River to the Hanford Reservation.

   Suspected anti-government militants
opened fire and threw bombs at a suburban prison, freeing 221
inmates, the government said Wednesday.
   Guards killed two prisoners during Tuesday night's jail raid at
the Welikade Prison, which prompted authorities to impose curfews in
parts of Colombo and to appoint an army officer to oversee the
country's prisons, the government said.
   The attack on the medium-security prison housing about 1,500
inmates was the second in as many weeks in Sri Lanka. On Dec. 4,
suspected Sinhalese extremists dressed in army uniforms overpowered
guards at a prison in central Sri Lanka and freed six inmates.
   A military spokesman who requested anonymity said Tuesday's
escape apparently was organized by the People's Liberation Front, an
extremist Sinhalese group trying to topple the government and
disrupt the Dec. 19 presidential elections.
   The military official said about 25 gunmen opened fire and threw
small bombs at the south wall of the prison. The explosions
distracted guards in other sections of the facility and allowed
inmates to scale the walls and escape, they said. Guards opened
fire, killing at least two inmates, the official said.
   ``It was a well-organized operation, pre-planned and possibly
done with inside connivance,'' he added.
   The 221 prisoners escaped in six vehicles, raided a laundry about
a half mile from the prison and changed their prison uniforms for
civilian clothes, the official said.
   At least 15 escapees were caught early Wednesday about seven
miles from the prison, he said.
   The official said authorities believe other convicts reached the
town of Kelaniya, about five miles north of Colombo, and escaped by
boat down the Kelani River.
   The justice ministry said army Lt. Col. Vipul Boteju was
appointed to oversee all prisons in Sri Lanka.
   On Wednesday, troops searched passenger buses and vehicles
entering the capital. Police imposed an indefinite curfew in the
northern neighborhoods and searched homes for escapees.
   The People's Liberation Front, which staged a coup attempt in
1971, opposes the government's efforts to end the 5-year-old
insurgency by Tamil rebels fighting for an independent homeland in
the north and east provinces.
   The Sinhalese, who are predominantly Buddhist, make up 75 percent
of the island's 16 million people and control the government and the
military. The Tamils, who are Hindu and make up 18 percent of the
population, claim they are denied jobs and education by the
Sinhalese.
   The front contends the government has offered too many
concessions to the Tamils in a peace accord signed in July 1987.
Since then, the Sinhalese militants have been blamed for the murders
of more than 900 people, most of them government supporters.

   Gen. Saw Maung on Wednesday met the first
senior visiting foreign dignitary since he seized power, and he told
journalists finally allowed into Burma that it is not ready for
general elections.
   ``We will definitely hold this multiparty democratic election,
there's no question about it,'' the general said in repeating
earlier promises.
   He spoke with reporters accompanying Thailand's army chief Gen.
Chavalit Yongchaiyudh on the first visit by a senior foreign
official since Saw Maung seized power in a Sept. 18 coup. His troops
killed hundreds of demonstrators supporting democracy.
   The visit broke an informal international understanding to
refrain from moves that might imply recognition of the Saw Maung
government. Japan, the United States and other countries have frozen
aid to Burma.
   Saw Maung said that before elections could be held, authorities
must ensure law and order, restore transportation and
communications, and provide food, clothing and shelter for the
people.
   ``There's been progress in these three main objectives but we've
got to wait for a while,'' he said when asked the polling date.
   ``The political parties are in the process of registration at the
moment. They are not ready yet,'' he added.
   On the day he toppled civilian President Maung Maung, Saw Maung
said he would ensure elections are held. He has allowed opposition
political parties to form but suppressed all other public
expressions of dissent.
   After returning to Bangkok today, Chavalit told a news conference
that his talks with Saw Maung focused on the Burmese government's
offensive against rebel groups, students who have joined the rebels,
and narcotics.
   After the coup, thousands of students joined ethnic-based
guerrilla groups on the border. The government has said the students
can come back without facing punishment.
   At a luncheon for Chavalit, Saw Maung said more than 1,500
students have returned home and authorities have arranged with
Bangkok the return of those staying in temporary Thai camps. Saw
Maung told reporters about 2,000 students remain at the border area,
but Thai officials put the figure at 7,000.
   On foreign relations, Saw Maung said ``there are a few countries
which look forward to consolidate friendship with us and on the
other hand some countries show less interest in cooperating with us
... our policy is to establish friendship with every country.''
   The Nation newspaper of Thailand criticized Chavalit's visit. In
an editorial, it said he ``can privately try to persuade Gen. Saw
Maung to hold the promised free and fair general elections as soon
as possible. Only his success in this effort _ which is so far most
unlikely _ could justify making a trip to Rangoon now.''
   The newspaper said that while Thai authorities try to portray the
trip as technical and military-related, the visit could send the
wrong signal both to Saw Maung and the rest of the world that
Thailand endorsed the massacres by Burmese troops.

   FERE-EN-TARDENOIS, France (AP) _ Khmer Rouge leader Khieu Samphan
met Prince Norodom Sihanouk on Wednesday and said his communist
organization fully backs Sihanouk as Cambodia's ``national leader.''
   Samphan's meeting followed November discussions in this northern
French village between Sihanouk, unofficial head of a coalition of
Cambodian resistance groups, Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen, and
Son Sann, leader of the non-communist Khmer People's National
Liberation Front.
   It is the first visit to France since 1975 by a ranking Khmer
Rouge leader. The movement was excluded from the November talks, but
Sihanouk met Samphan informally in July in Jakarta, Indonesia.
   Samphan told reporters after Wednesday's meeting that driving
Vietnamese troops from Cambodia should come before any other goals.
   ``We consider his royal highness Prince Norodom Sihanouk as our
national leader, the leader of all Cambodia,'' said Samphan,
speaking French and wearing a dark blue Western-style suit. ``The
great powers have a role to play in the search for peace in
Cambodia, but it is clear that we, the Cambodians, are the ones
mainly involved.''
   Asked about Pol Pot, who led the Khmer Rouge's four-year reign of
terror from 1975 until Vietnamese troops invaded and installed Hun
Sen's government, Samphan would say only that the despot was in
Cambodia and no longer played ``an active role.''
   Sihanouk made no statement after Wednesday's meeting. He has been
critical of the Chinese-backed Khmer Rouge but also says there can
be no settlement without them.
   Sihanouk blamed Hun Sen for the failed November meeting, charging
Hun Sen, who is backed by the Soviet Union, put foreign interests
before Cambodia.
   After that, Sihanouk said Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev and
Beijing authorities were the key to settling the Cambodian dispute.
   China wants Soviet concessions if it agrees to cut support for
40,000 Khmer Rouge guerrillas fighting Hun Sen's government.
   The Soviet Union wants assurances that when Vietnam withdraws its
120,000 troops, expected in 1990, the Khmer Rouge will not make
another bid for power.

<HEAD>Appellate Ruling Called Breakthrough for Fight Against Jet Noise</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal court ruling allowing the city to be
sued for damages blamed on noise from O'Hare International Airport
was hailed Wednesday as a breakthrough in the fight to cut the din
in suburban communities.
   ``It's one of the biggest victories we've had to date,'' said
John Geils, village president for west suburban Bensenville near one
of the world's busiest airports.
   The 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruling Tuesday reversed an
earlier decision that barred lawsuits against the city over its
airport operations.
   The ruling could prompt a flood of litigation in county courts
over airport noise or other nuisances, said Joseph Karaganis, the
attorney who filed the lawsuit.
   Karaganis, who called the decision a landmark in the decades-old
fight over O'Hare's impact, estimated 210,000 residents in 20 city
and suburban neighborhoods could sue Chicago under the ruling.
   ``The old ruling was used by the City of Chicago to beat the
suburbs,'' Karaganis said. ``Now the door to the court is open.''
   The lawsuit was filed for Lawrence C. Bieneman of Bensenville,
who seeks damages exceeding ``tens of thousands of dollars'' for
property damage and personal injury from O'Hare noise and air
pollution, Karaganis said. The case now goes to DuPage County
Circuit Court and may be consolidated with similar lawsuits.
   ``Perhaps it will give us an opportunity to negotiate outside the
courts ... and get Chicago to mitigate some of these concerns,''
said Geils, who serves on the O'Hare Advisory Board.
   City Corporation Counsel Judson Miner had not read the decision,
but said, ``I don't view it as a loss.''
   ``Studying the ramifications will take some time, so I don't know
if it opens any doors or not,'' he said.
   Since 1975, the 7th Circuit had barred lawsuits seeking to
collect damages from the city, which owns O'Hare, for complaints
resulting from airport operations. It said management of an airport
was a federally regulated activity, which pre-empted state law.
   Other federal courts disagreed.
   ``We must decide whether to maintain a go-it-alone position,''
appellate Judge Frank Easterbrook wrote in Tuesday's ruling.
   He said the court was convinced that its 1975 ruling was wrong
and that ``we should 'fess up to the error.''
   Geils said the impact of the jet-traffic racket on schoolchildren
``has been very significant ... there is constant distraction,
constant interruption of the learning process.''
   Past noise-abatement efforts have been financed by the federal
Airport Improvement Program trust fund overseen by the Federal
Aviation Administration, he said, and more funds are being sought
for the 12 remaining schools of 27 targeted for soundproofing in
several suburban communities.
   Bieneman said Wednesday his O'Hare-related problems began in 1970.
   He cited windows and walls cracked by vibrational stress from the
jet noise, landing lights that shine into one south-facing bedroom
and turn night into day, and other problems.
   ``Why should I move? I've been here since 1949 ... it's where my
kids were raised,'' said Bieneman.

<HEAD>LaRouche Lawyers Rest Their Case Without Putting Him on Stand</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDs: LEADS with 8 grafs to UPDATE with defense attorneys'
statements. Picks up 6th graf pvs, `Chief U.S.'</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT M. ANDREWS</BYLINE>

   Defense lawyers rested their case
Wednesday in the tax and mail fraud conspiracy trial of political
maverick Lyndon LaRouche without summoning him to testify, and then
described the government's case as ``garbage'' and a ``rotting
carcass.''
   In their closing arguments, government prosecutors said LaRouche
and six associates deliberately deceived supporters who lent his
controversial political movement more than $30 million but were
never repaid.
   They also said LaRouche, 66, a perennial minor-party political
candidate, conspired to defraud the Internal Revenue Service by
having his personal expenses paid by various corporations he
controls and pretending he had no taxable income.
   But defense attorneys told the trial jury of seven women and five
men that LaRouche and his aides were innocent of all charges and
hinted that they were victims of a vengeful government.
   ``These people are not crazy and they are not foolish,'' said
William Moffitt, attorney for defendant Dennis Small, a LaRouche
fund-raiser.
   LaRouche's lawyer, Odin Anderson of Boston, said the government
was charging some sort of ``voodoo conspiracy'' and told the jurors
``they don't want you to decide straightforward facts _ they want
you to decide garbage.''
   He added: ``The bad smell in the courtroom didn't come from
outside but from the rotting carcass of the government's case.''
   Defense lawyer James Clark said the trial was not about money but
``about a political movement with dedicated followers who want to
succeed and powerful enemies who want it to fail.''
   Chief U.S. District Judge Albert V. Bryan Jr. said he would send
the case to the jury Thursday morning after a 14-day trial. LaRouche
told a reporter he was not called to the witness stand because his
testimony would only ``gild the lily'' of the defense case.
   Bryan said the jurors would deliberate through Saturday, if
necessary, to reach a verdict.
   LaRouche and the six associates are charged with raising millions
of dollars in loans from supporters without any intention of
repaying them. In addition, LaRouche is accused of conspiring to
cheat federal tax collectors by allegedly concealing his true
income. He has not filed income tax returns for any year since 1978.
   If convicted on all 13 counts against him, LaRouche faces a
maximum penalty of 65 years in prison and fines totaling $3.25
million.
   Prosecutor John Markham told the jurors the charges contained in
a federal grand jury indictment returned on Oct. 14 had nothing to
do with LaRouche's political ideas.
   But, he said, they were based on the way the LaRouche
organization raised its money. ``The ends, however noble they may be
... is not the point and does not justify lying to people to get
their money,'' Markham said.
   At the same time one LaRouche fund-raiser was telling an elderly
woman he couldn't pay a dime on her overdue loan of more than
$100,000, Markham said, massive improvements costing much more were
being made at a 199-acre LaRouche farm outside Leesburg, Va.,
including a swimming pool, a pond, a guest house and a riding ring.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Kent Robinson said LaRouche conspired to
hide his income from the IRS by having his associates pay all his
personal expenses. ``He did a good job,'' Robinson said. ``We can't
figure out even today just what his income was.''
   Robinson dismissed defense attorneys' claims that LaRouche was an
employee of the various entities he controlled and that the goods
and services he received free represented non-taxable compensation.
   ``He's not an employee,'' Robinson said. ``And if he's not, his
meals and lodging are taxable.''
   Defense lawyer Moffitt said the LaRouche people were not foolish
enough to believe their money-raising efforts were certain to be a
failure, and denied that they had set out to deceive their lenders.
   To convict them of a criminal conspiracy, he said, the government
would have to prove that ``when they solicited the loans they never
intended to be successful ... and if they never intended to be
successful, then they intended to end up here, because they were
being watched.''
   Moffitt claimed that ``part of the reason we are here'' is an
anti-drug book published by one LaRouche organization which makes
accusations against money-laundering banks and people in high places.
   Henly Webster, attorney for defendant Ed Spannaus, said, ``This
political movement is not a polite one,'' but he urged the jurors to
protect it against ``an over-reaching government'' which is offended
by the LaRouche organization's political attacks.
   Webster said the LaRouche organization lacked a staff of
professional administrators, accountants and lawyers. ``If they'd
had a good office manager this might not have happened,'' he said.
   ``Why would you intentionally cut off your life blood by
defrauding these people?'' Webster said.

<HEAD>Three More Government Relief Flights Planned For Armenia</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Updates and adds details throughout</NOTE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Three additional U.S. government earthquake
relief flights will arrive in Soviet Armenia before the weekend,
carrying plastic sheeting, tents and other supplies, the State
Department said Wednesday.
   Two Air Force C-141s were leaving Wednesday and Thursday and a
civilian plane will depart Friday, department spokesman Charles
Redman said. The last flight, in addition to relief supplies, will
be carrying replacements for U.S. government personnel who are now
on site.
   The additional three flights will bring to eight the total since
the government relief effort began.
   Officials say the Dec. 7 quake killed at least 55,000 people,
injured 13,000 and left 500,000 homeless.
   The private assistance effort has included more than a dozen
flights carrying over $3 million worth of relief assistance,
including dialysis machines, medical supplies and orthopedic
equipment, Redman said.
   In addition, three Soviet cargo flights will arrive in the United
States over the next several days to airlift privately donated
supplies to the disaster zone.
   Redman said seven of the nine American citizens known or believed
to be in the affected area have been reported to be safe and well.
Continuing efforts are being made to learn of the remaining two.
   Meanwhile, eight firefighters from the United States and Canada
left Wednesday for Armenia to aid in the relief efforts.
   The team, organized through the International Association of Fire
Chiefs and the Spokane, Wash.-based People to People Program, is
expected to spend about two weeks helping in excavation and aiding
survivors.
   Douglas Pollington of Cambridge, Ontario, a member of the People
to People Citizen Ambassador Program team and former president of
the IAFC, said he hopes some people buried in the rubble are still
alive, as in the 1985 Mexico City earthquake where some survivors
were pulled out after 12 days.
   To aid in the search, team members are carrying a high-tech
device called a ``thermal imager'' that uses infrared light to
detect heat sources. Until now, rescue workers primarily have used
dogs to search for survivors.
   Also on Wednesday, U.S. architects offered to help architects in
the Soviet Union to rebuild cities devastated by the earthquake.
   ``We want to ensure that it doesn't happen as seriously again,
here or there,'' said Don Geis, a consultant on natural disasters
for the American Institute of Architects.
   ``We don't know, quite frankly, much about Soviet anti-earthquake
construction,'' Geis said, noting reports that poor construction may
have contributed to the high death toll.
   Geis said U.S. architects also could learn from the quake, as
they did in a visit to Mexico after the 1985 quake. He said rumors
that much of the destruction in Mexico City was caused by shoddy
construction proved to be exaggerated.

<HEAD>`Blood Will Be Shed,' Chairman Says of Farm Budget Cut</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE ROBINSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Congress will be forced to make painful cuts in
farm programs to meet deficit-reduction targets even if there is a
tax increase, the House Agriculture Committee chairman said
Wednesday.
   ``It's not going to be easy,'' Rep. E. ``Kika'' de la Garza,
D-Texas, told reporters. ``It's going to be very painful. There's
going to be blood shed or I guess marrow because it's down to the
bone. We're going to have to chop into bone.''
   The Reagan administration reportedly has been weighing a $3
billion reduction in farm spending in the fiscal year that starts
next Oct. 1. The Agriculture Committee is reckoning that cuts
totaling $1.5 billion would meet targets under the Gramm-Rudman
deficit-reduction law.
   De la Garza said the administration has not told him how much it
calculates will be needed to meet deficit-reduction targets.
   He said some farm cuts were ``inevitable, even with a tax
increase.'' He said an increase would help to preserve some
agricultural programs but stopped short of advocating one. ``It's
not easy to vote for a tax increase, it's very difficult ...,'' the
chairman said.
   Spending on farm programs operated by the government's Commodity
Credit Corp. peaked at $26 billion in 1986 but since has steadily
dwindled to an estimated $12 billion in the current fiscal year.
Much of the decrease is attributable to built-in reductions under
broad farm legislation approved by Congress in 1985.
   De la Garza complained, however, that the built-in reductions are
not counted against the amount of savings that lawmakers must find
to shoulder their share of the deficit-reduction burden.
   One method of cutting spending being mentioned is a further
reduction in target prices, set by Congress and used to determine
the size of so-called deficiency payments to wheat and feed grains
producers. The levels have gradually come down under the 1985
legislation.
   Deficiency payments should total about $7.4 billion in fiscal
1990 and about $3 billion of that will be payable in advance, by
Agriculture Committee reckoning. A cut in that amount also remains a
possibility.

<HEAD>Number of Calls From Green River TV Show Exaggerated</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A mistake by organizers of a television special on
the Green River serial killings led authorities to grossly
exaggerate the number of telephone calls they received with crime
tips, authorities said.
   Initial reports said as many as 60,000 calls were made to a
special phone bank that was staffed by investigators. During the
nationwide broadcast last week, viewers were urged to phone in tips
on the Green River killings or any other crimes.
   But in the first days after the broadcast, investigators had
answered no more than 7,660 calls, Lt. Dan Nolan, spokesman for the
King County police's Green River Task Force, said Tuesday.
   Blame for the inflated figures was put mostly on a mistake in
which the show's organizers confused the number of calls attempted
with the number of calls received.
   US West Communications, which handled the incoming calls, said
about 86,200 calls had been attempted on the toll-free number
broadcast during the show ``Manhunt: A Chance to End the Nightmare.''
   Most callers, however, either got busy signals, did not get
through because of technical problems or else apparently changed
their minds and ended their calls prematurely, Nolan said.
   In addition, ``there are other people who are talking to
different people in the media and it's all getting screwed up,'' he
said.
   Nolan said the 7,660 calls answered by police had yielded about
3,000 credible tips on the Green River killings and other crimes.
   One led Kent police to arrest two men, ages 27 and 17, in the
slaying of Alice Cecilia Worthing, whose body was found Oct. 26 in
the Green River. Police said, however, they don't think her
asphyxiation was related to the serial slayings.
   The Green River serial killer is officially blamed for the deaths
of as many as 48 young women, many of them prostitutes, between the
summer of 1982 and early 1984. Forty are known dead and the Green
River Task Force has held the killer responsible for the
disappearances of eight other women.
   Despite the discrepancies reported in the number of calls, police
still have their hands full. Seattle Police Detective Myrle Carner
said 27 investigators would work full time through the holidays
sorting out the calls.
   ``Obviously, we kind of stepped into uncharted waters on this,
but, quite frankly, it's been overwhelmingly successful,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   A bank officer was found Wednesday
naked, bruised and battered at the door of a pizza restaurant, one
month after she was kidnapped, authorities said.
   Police and FBI agents were questioning three men in connection
with the Nov. 14 disappearance of Catherine Thom, 31, of Arlington
but authorities would not say the men were suspects.
   Arlington police Sgt. Sharon Warms said Ms. Thom was discovered
as she leaned against the door of the restaurant shortly after
midnight, and employees let the woman in.
   Warms said Ms. Thom was described as hysterical.
   ``Her emotional state is such (that) she really hasn't been able
to tell us anything about the last 30 days,'' Arlington police
spokesman Dee Anderson said.
   Ms. Thom was treated and released from John Peter Smith Hospital
for a cut over her right eye, and bruises on both arms, according to
Fort Worth police spokesman Doug Clarke.
   Ms. Thom, an assistant vice president at First City Bank in
Arlington, was last seen the morning of Nov. 14 in her car at a
drive-in window at First City Bank Central.
   Arlington police Detective Helen Schilling-Wallace said Ms. Thom
may have been trying to signal bank employees she was in trouble
when she wrote a check for $1,000.
   Ms. Thom, who had previously worked as a bank teller supervisor,
asked the teller how much she could withdraw and included her
driver's license in the transaction for identification, even though
she works at the bank and was well known by the tellers.
   ``There's a good possibility that someone was in the car with
her, but we haven't been able to confirm that,'' Ms.
Schilling-Wallace said.
   She was reported missing by her family the next day. On Nov. 16,
her car was found abandoned in a K mart parking lot in Euless.
   David Israelson, an agent in the FBI's Fort Worth office, said
the first real break in the case came late Tuesday when a woman
reported to Fort Worth police she had seen a suspicious-looking car
with three men and a woman inside.
   The description of the woman she gave was similar to that police
had of Ms. Thom, Israelson said.
   When police arrived at the scene, three men were leaving the
residence, Anderson said. They agreed to talk to police, and the car
was impounded, Anderson said.
   Friends and neighbors were relieved that so many days after her
abduction, the ordeal ended with her escape.
   ``I kept having dreams, seeing her walk back through the gate,''
said a neighbor, Peggy Staker, whose four children often played with
Ms. Thom's 10-year-old son, Daniel.
   ``I was so happy that she was alive,'' said Margarita Rivers,
another neighbor. ``I just felt she wasn't dead the whole time. A
lot of people said, `Well, it's been too long.' I kept watch over
her house every night, hoping to see signs that she'd been back.
   ``Although she's in terrible condition right now, it's a joyous
thing they found her alive and her little boy will have her back for
Christmas,'' Ms. Rivers said. ``It's the best present ever.''

<HEAD>Rajneesh's Former Secretary Says She Will Return To India</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FRANKFURT, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ma Anand Sheela, the former
secretary of Indian guru Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh, said Wednesday
after being deported from the United States that she will return to
India but has no plans to see the guru.
   The Indian-born Sheela, 39, flew into Frankfurt from Los Angeles
after serving 2{ years for crimes ranging from attempted murder to
wiretapping.
   She was released from a prison in California on Tuesday and was
deported after pledging not to return to the United States for five
years.
   Sheela was sentenced to 4{ years in prison in July 1986, but was
released with time off for good behavior.
   ``I have no money,'' Sheela told reporters after arriving with no
luggage.
   Sheela, accompanied by her West German lawyer, immediately left
for the southern West German town of Baden-Baden.
   Authorities in Oregon complained that she left behind more than
$269,000 in unpaid fines and restitution.
   ``It's a heck of a lot harder to collect money from someone in
Germany or India or wherever she is than if she's in prison in the
United States,'' said Marla Rae, spokeswoman for state Attorney
General Dave Frohnmayer.
   Asked in Frankfurt about her future plans, Sheela said she will
go back to India but didn't think she would see the guru.
   After Sheela and several of her top aides fled to Europe in
September 1985, Rajneesh accused her of leaving the sect $55 million
in debt, plotting to kill him, tapping the commune's telephones and
trying to bomb the county courthouse. He since has publicly said she
is innocent of all those charges.
   Rajneesh, on whom followers bestowed more than 90 Rolls-Royces,
allowed Sheela to wield dictatorial control over as many as 4,000
followers who lived at the sect's now-defunct commune,
Rajneeshpuram, in central Oregon.
   She pleaded guilty to attempted murder, assault, arson,
electronic eavesdropping, immigration fraud and conspiracy. She now
says she is innocent and pleaded guilty only to protect Rajneesh,
who now is at a commune in India.
   The Oregon commune, started in 1981, collapsed after Rajneesh was
convicted of immigration fraud and deported in November 1985.
   Sheela was accused of trying to kill Rajneesh's doctor with a
poison-filled syringe, giving glasses of poisoned water to two
county officials, setting fire to the county planning office,
arranging more than 400 sham marriages so the guru's foreign
disciples could remain in the United States, creating an extensive
electronic eavesdropping system at Rajneeshpuram and conspiring to
spread salmonella bacteria on food in 10 restaurants in The Dalles,
a city 80 miles away.
   More than 750 people fell ill from the contaminated restaurant
salad bars, and a doctor and two county officials also fell ill.

   Yuli Kosharovsky, a 47-year-old radio
electronics engineer and the longest-standing Jewish ``refusenik''
in the Soviet Union, has been granted permission to emigrate to
Israel, an official of the National Conference on Soviet Jewry said
Wednesday.
   Kosharovsky, his wife Ina, 42, and their two children plan to
leave Moscow in about six weeks, Deborah Strober, spokeswoman for
the Jewish group, said after a telephone conversation with Mrs.
Kosharovsky.
   Kosharovsky had been seeking permission to emigrate since 1971,
but without success.
   Two weeks ago, in a policy shift, Soviet authorities told
Kosharovsky and more than 40 other Jews who wanted to emigrate that
their past involvement in work with security implications no longer
would prevent their departure.
   Shoshana S. Cardin, chairman of the national conference, said
``we are very encouraged that after so many years of torment
inflicted upon them because they sought to leave for Israel, the
Kosharovskys finally will be able to fulfill their Jewish
destinies.''
   The family plans to settle in Israel, said Jerry Strober, a
spokesman for the conference.
   The vast majority of Soviet Jews who emigrate with exit permits
for Israel change their destinations once they reach Vienna or Rome.
Most wind up in the United States.
   Kosharovsky was considered a leader in the Jewish refusenik
movement. He represented Soviet Jews wishing to emigrate in a
meeting last spring in Moscow with President Reagan.

   Former heavyweight champion Muhammad Ali denied
Wednesday that any surrogate imitating his voice had taken his place
in numerous telephone conversations with senators, congressional
aides and journalists this year.
   ``I've been making the calls,'' Ali told a news conference on the
east steps of the Capitol.
   Ali specifically denied that his attorney, Richard M. Hirschfeld,
had impersonated him in any calls, though he acknowledged in a
hand-written statement that the lawyer had arranged several
telephone conversations between himself and several members of
Congress, then-Attorney General Edwin Meese III, and others.
   A three-part story published Sunday through Tuesday by The
Atlanta Journal and The Atlanta Constitution questioned the
authenticity of the calls and quoted associates of both Ali and
Hirschfeld as saying the attorney is able to imitate the former
champion's voice.
   ``There's no truth in it,'' Ali said of the idea that someone
else had spoken for him. ``I did this because I had things I wanted
to say.''
   His written statement specifically cited calls to Sens. Orrin G.
Hatch, R-Utah, Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., Strom Thurmond, R-S.C.,
and John Warner, R-Va., as well as Meese.
   He also said he telephoned The Washington Post and gave an
interview to reporter Nancy Lewis.
   ``Now that I am not boxing, I want to fight poverty, world hunger
and etc.,'' his written statement said. ``I also campaign for people
I trust and believe in, like George Bush.''
   Asked how the story came about, Ali said Constitution sports
columnist Dave Kindred ``kept following me around, asking me did I
make phone calls to senators. He followed me so much, I just said,
`No. I haven't made no calls.' So, he wasn't writing and didn't have
no pen. I looked up and a week or two later and read in the paper
that Ali didn't make the calls.''
   ``I'm here to tell you, it was me,'' Ali said. ``I did make the
calls. And that's why we are here. I didn't know he was going to say
that someone was impersonating Ali.''
   ``I told him I didn't make the calls just to get him off my
back,'' he said.
   Pressed as to whether Hirschfeld had ever impersonated him, Ali
replied he never did. He called Hirschfeld ``the best friend a man
can have.''
   He also said he had never heard Hirschfeld imitate his voice and
didn't know whether he could.

<HEAD>Group Says Pentagon May Put Chemical Warheads on Cruise Missiles</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NORMAN BLACK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Military Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Washington environmental group on Wednesday
charged that the Pentagon is considering the use of long-range
cruise missiles to deliver chemical warheads and demanded a full
accounting of the program's possible impact on arms control.
   The group, the Foundation on Economic Trends, said the ``Deep
Fire'' program ``represents a unique threat to international peace.''
   Citing a little known provision of federal law, the foundation
filed a petition with Defense Secretary Frank C. Carlucci,
requesting ``the preparation of a full, complete, detailed and
public Arms Control Impact Statement for the chemical warfare
program called `Deep Fire.'''
   ``This program is designed to examine deep-strike delivery of
chemical weapons, including cruise-missile delivery of chemical
warfare agents. The program represents a dangerous escalation of the
chemical warfare arms race.''
   The petition was filed by Jeremy Rifkin, the foundation's
president, who added: ``If the incoming administration truly wishes
to stop the proliferation of chemical weapons, as was pledged during
the campaign, it should immediately eliminate this program.''
   According to Rifkin, recently declassified House Appropriations
Committee transcripts of a March 11, 1987, hearing contain the
following from the Pentagon:
   ``Alternative long-range standoff chemical weapons being
considered are the Army Tactical Missile System; powered GBU-15
glide weapon; air-launched cruise missile; ground-launched cruise
missile; sea-launched cruise missile; Tomahawk, Harpoon and Advanced
Interdiction Weapon System.''
   According to the group, the federal Arms Control and Disarmament
Act requires the Pentagon to prepare an impact statement whenever it
begins work on a ``program involving technology with potential
military application or weapons systems which ... may have
significant impact on arms control and disarmament policy or
negotiations.''
   The foundation asserted no such impact statement had been
prepared for the ``Deep Fire'' program.
   ``Clearly, research into deep-strike delivery systems for
chemical warfare agents could dramatically alter strategic options
for chemical warfare use. `Deep Fire's' impacts on disarmament
policy and negotiations must be fully assessed.''
   The Pentagon said Wednesday it did not know of any program
code-named ``Deep Fire,'' but acknowledged it had been conducting
``low-level studies of standoff chemical weapons since being
directed by Congress to do so in 1985.''
   ``There is no program to put chemical weapons on cruise
missiles,'' said Lt. Col. Rick Oborn, a Pentagon spokesman. ``And
we're not sure where this `Deep Fire' name comes from.
   ``We have been told by Congress to continue low-level studies of
what chemical weapons might follow (the current generation), and
that's what we're doing.''
   Given the nature of the work, Oborn said it was not clear the law
requiring an impact analysis should apply in this situation.
   The United States, citing production by the Soviet Union,
recently began making a new generation of toxic chemical weapons.
The weapons being made under that program, however, are either
short-range artillery rounds or a bomb for delivery by an airplane.
   Putting a chemical warhead on a cruise missile would make it
possible to deliver such a weapon more than 1,000 miles into enemy
territory and to launch it either from the air, sea or ground.
   The Foundation on Economic Trends is an environmental group that
long has focused its attention on the dangers of biological research
and genetic engineering.
   The group has enjoyed legal success against the Pentagon in the
past, succeeding in recent years in blocking construction of a new
aerosol biological warfare laboratory in Utah and forcing
preparation of an environmental impact study covering various
biological research programs.

   James Lawlor wants to wish Soviet leader
Mikhail Gorbachev and the Soviet people Merry Christmas in a big way.
   He's collecting what he hopes will be 2 million signatures for a
three-story Christmas card to be sent to the Kremlin at the end of
the month.
   The Christmas-tree-shaped card also features a greeting in
Russian:
   ``Dear Mr. Gorbachev, we citizens of the United States of America
wish to extend to you and the people of the Soviet Union our great
appreciation in the spirit of Christmas for your courage and
dedication to bring peace to the world. Merry Christmas.''
   ``I would like to have it hung in Red Square or someplace
public,'' said Lawlor, owner of Lawlor Manufacturing, a maker of
safety goggles in Fairfield.
   Lawlor said he means the card as a gesture of appreciation for
Gorbachev's peace initiatives.
   He is trying to get the signatures of musicians popular among
Soviet youths, such as Billy Joel, who has performed in Moscow, and
the group Bon Jovi.
   Already, he's received ``several thousand'' signatures on address
labels, including one from Iowa Gov. Terry Branstad. And he sent a
letter this week to President Reagan asking him to add his signature
to the project.
   Lawlor said interest has grown in the project since word got out.
   ``It's exploding,'' he said in a telephone interview. ``I'm still
optimistic about getting the 2 million signatures if this keeps up.
I wasn't totally certain that all the responses would be so
positive.''
   Lawlor said small photographs of people will be attached to the
card along with the signature labels.
   ``This is not politically motivated. My intention is good will
toward the Soviet people, and the people who have responded are
seeing it that way,'' he said.

   The head of the world's most valuable company
resigned Wednesday in a stock trading scandal that has inspired
outrage about the coziness of public servants with business in
Japan's traditional big-money politics.
   Hisashi Shinto, 78-year-old chairman of Nippon Telegraph and
Telephone Co., became the 16th person _ including Finance Minister
Kiichi Miyazawa _ to leave a high post because of links with the
insider-trading case.
   Shinto had led the company since 1981. He said he was resigning
because his secretary made a $163,000 profit on shares of
Recruit-Cosmos Co., a real estate firm at the center of a the
scandal that began last summer.
   Aides to Shinto, Miyazawa and other prominent people in politics
and business were given the opportunity to buy unlisted shares in
Recruit-Cosmos, a subsidiary of Recruit Co., at bargain prices, some
with loans provided by Recruit. They made profits by selling after
the shares were offered to the public in October 1986 and the price
more than doubled.
   Such insider transactions are legal in Japan, but the close ties
between politics and big business have come under increased criticis
since this one was exposed.
   A statement released by Shinto said: ``I have decided to resign
to take responsibility for causing trouble concerning NTT and the
Recruit affair and causing people to lose trust in NTT.''
   He also resigned as chairman of 16 subsidiaries of the
telecommunications giant, company officials said.
   NTT has the largest market value of any company in the world,
about $260 billion, or almost twice the combined worth of
International Business Machines Corp., General Motors Corp. and
American Telephone & Telegraph Co. Market value is the price of the
company's shares multiplied by the number of shares.
   Shinto, who has preached clean business and politics, was linked
to the scandal in October when it was revealed that the aide, Kozo
Murata, bought 10,000 unlisted Recruit-Cosmos shares.
   Media reports Tuesday said about $73,000 was transferred from
Murata's bank account to the account of his boss. Shinto said Murata
controlled the account in question, however, and denied personal
involvement.
   Haruo Yamaguchi, president of the giant company, told a news
conference: ``Mr. Shinto said the transaction may have taken place,
but he has no way of confirming it because Mr. Murata's whereabouts
are unknown.''
   The company is the world's largest in terms of capitalization. In
1987, it earned the most corporate profits in Japan, $4.1 billion.
   Miyazawa and Shinto were among those considered least
contaminated by traditional methods of using money for political
influence in Japan.
   An editorial Thursday in the newspaper Asahi indicated how
seriously the affair has shaken public confidence.
   It said, in part: ``Hisashi Shinto ... has resigned. Our
disillusionment is great. Shinto was always a well-respected
business leader who combined wisdom with a broadness and clarity of
vision ... What has become of Japan's leaders?
   Masaya Ito, a prominent political commentator, said many such
``clean'' politicians and company officials were unfamiliar with how
big-money politics is managed.
   ``They often leave this business entirely to their aides, and as
a result it leads to problems when something is revealed and they
can't give persuasive explanations,'' he said.
   Seizaburo Sato, a political commentator and Tokyo University
professor, said Finance Minister Miyazawa resigned ``not because of
his involvement in the scandal but because of poor management by his
aide. ... He is not the only one in the Cabinet involved .. . but he
is the only one who either lied to the public or was lied to by his
aide.''
   Hiromasa Ezoe, chairman of Recruit Co., resigned in September
after reports that he had sold 2 million unlisted shares in the
subsidiary to influential politicians and business leaders.
   His secretary, Hiroshi Matsubara, director of Recruit-Cosmos,
also resigned in September and has been charged with trying to bribe
an opposition member of Parliament to slow the investigation.
   Two legislators from opposition parties gave up positions in
October when their names were linked to the scandal.
   After those resignations, the Socialist and Komeito (Clean
Government) parties demanded that members of the govering Liberal
Democratic Party who were involved also take responsibility. That
led to Miyazawa's resignation.
   Two top newspaper executives also were among those who gave up
their jobs because of connections with the insider trading.
   Most prominent politicians tied to the deal have stayed in office.
   Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita, his predecessor Yasuhiro
Nakasone and governing party Secretary-General Shintaro Abe, a
former foreign minister, acknowledged some aides were in on it but
denied personal involvement.

<HEAD>U.S. To Continue Supplying Savimbi</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GENE KRAMER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United States will continue to support
guerrilla leader Jonas Savimbi as long as outside countries supply
the Angolan communist government, the White House said Wednesday.
   Presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater was asked by reporters
whether U.S. support for Savimbi would continue after finalization
of the U.S.-mediated agreement providing for the phased withdrawal
of 50,000 Cuban soldiers from Angola by mid-1991 and the
independence of South-West Africa in about one year.
   ``We continue to support Savimbi'' in his struggle against the
Angolan government, Fitzwater said. ``He has been supportive of this
recent agreement and we are hopeful that the issue between
(Savimbi's) UNITA forces and the government of Angola can be
resolved internally.''
   The agreement, reached in Brazzaville, Congo, will be signed
formally in New York on Dec. 22 by Cuba, Angola and South Africa,
which has ruled Namibia, a former German colony rich in mineral
resources, since the end of World War I.
   Fitzwater said the United States favors negotiations between
UNITA, Savimbi's National Union for the Total Independence of
Angola, and the government in Luanda, but he did not know the status
of possible talks.
   In any case, ``as long as the Angolan government is supplied by
outside countries, we continue to provide support for Savimbi,''
Fitzwater said.
   Savimbi himself has said President-elect Bush promised him both
before and after the November presidential election that U.S.
support to UNITA would continue until the Soviet Union stops
supplying the Angolan government and until after the Cuban troops
leave.
   U.S. aid to Savimbi last year has been estimated at $15 million.
   Secretary of State George P. Shultz planned to attend the session
in New York, department spokesman Charles Redman said, even though
the United States would not sign anything.
   ``We look forward to supporting the agreement in this concrete
fashion and to discussing and assisting the parties in resolving any
questions that may arise,'' Redman said.

   John Rowland borrowed to buy his young family a
home in Connecticut, borrowed to help pay for his first
congressional race and borrowed again to buy a house on Capitol Hill
after he won.
   ``I'm trying to live in the two most expensive places in the
United States _ Connecticut and Washington,'' said the 31-year-old
Republican congressman, who sold the home here last year because he
said he couldn't afford it _ not with his mortgage back home and the
hefty financial burden of raising three young children.
   He now rents a small apartment and sees his family on weekends
and when Congress is not in session. ``That's hard,'' he said
Wednesday. ``But the hardest part is trying to convince people it's
rough to live on $89,500.''
   That's the annual salary of rank-and-file members of Congress, a
wage that would increase 50 percent to $135,000 if President Reagan
endorses the recommendations of a study panel that concluded its
work Tuesday.
   Just talking about wanting more money can buy trouble.
   ``My appearance here kicks off my opponent's next campaign,
whoever he or she is,'' Rep. Vic Fazio, D-Calif., joked last month
when he urged the presidential commission to recommend higher pay
for Congress and federal judges.
   Rowland, now entering his third term, avoided taking a stand on
the salary recommendation but endorsed a related provision that
would ban lawmakers from accepting honoraria. ``I can live on
whatever the pay is,'' he said.
   The $135,000 figure suggested by the panel is more than nine
times the average personal income in 1987.
   Proponents of the raises say such comparisons are unfair. They
quickly point to the cost of living in Washington, where many
typical, family-sized houses sell for $200,000 or more.
   ``The average person back home just doesn't understand that if a
man brings his family with him down here, unless he has some
personal wealth, it's difficult for him to take on that kind of a
mortgage,'' said former Michigan Rep. Elford Cederberg, now
president of the Association of Former Congressmen. ``Especially in
politics, which is a rather unstable business.''
   The debate is not a new one. When the first Congress convened in
1789 its members were paid $6 for each day of the session.
Twenty-seven years later lawmakers raised their pay to $1,500 a year
but then quickly repealed the raises because of the public uproar.
   The opposition today is led by highly organized consumer groups
and advocates such as Ralph Nader, who called the latest
recommendations ``a salary grab.''
   But Cederberg and others say winning in Washington takes a toll
on the wallet.
   ``Republicans belong to the Capitol Hill Club and Democrats
belong to the Democratic Club,'' Cederberg said. ``And there are
other people and things you have to be seen around if you're going
to be influential and they cost money.''
   Others say opposition to the raises from constitutents often is
fueled by unfair images of Washington lifestyle.
   ``There are a lot of misconceptions about how we live in
Washington,'' said Ellen Proxmire, wife of retiring Wisconsin Sen.
William Proxmire. ``We're ordinary people whose husbands have
extraordinary jobs. We go to the grocery and we budget and we cook
our own meals most of the time and do just the same things that
everyone elese does.''
   Members of Congress do have to entertain and attend formal
functions, but also worry about the mortgage and day care and
college tuition, she said.
   ``There are many wealthy members of the Congress but for the
great majority of us who live on the salary it's not that easy,''
Mrs. Proxmire said. ``When we came here 30 years ago I didn't know
of a congressman's wife who worked. A lot of the wives work now.''
   She said the $135,000 recommended by the commission is ``fair''
but said there are ways to get by on $89,500.
   ``My husband still has the same tuxedo he came here with 30 years
ago,'' she said. ``And I don't even own a ball gown.''

<HEAD>Drought Effects Will Be Felt Next Year</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Even if depleted soil moisture is replenished,
the effects of the 1988 drought will continue to be ``very much in
evidence'' next year, the Agriculture Department said Wednesday.
   Net cash income, the difference between cash expenses and cash
gross receipts, is expected to be down somewhat from this year's
near-record $57 billion to between $48 billion and $52 billion.
   But the department's Economic Research Service said that would
still put 1989 net cash income at the fourth-highest level on record.
   Economists say net cash income was high in 1988 despite the
drought because so many farmers sold off commodities harvested in
earlier years, and because of large federal payments.
   Total crop and livestock receipts in 1989 are expected to rise
slightly from this year's record level, the report said.
   As a result of the drought and the draining of stored
inventories, farmers may boost crop plantings by as much as 30
million acres, but that will increase production costs. Government
payments are expected to decline 20 percent to 25 percent.

<TEXT>
   Eight Jewish organizations and a New York
congressman said Wednesday they are alarmed about slow U.S.
processing of Soviet Jews who want to come to the United States, and
suggested several steps, including a blanket grant of refugee
status, for dealing with the backlog.
   Rep. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., said increases in Soviet emigration
have strained the resources of U.S. agencies. But he said he and the
Jewish groups ``are concerned that the (Immigration and
Naturalization Service) has started recently to apply a new and
stricter definition of refugee in the case of Soviet emigres.''
   Schumer, a member of the Judiciary immigration subcommittee, said
in a statement that at least 177 Soviet Jews in Rome, the main
processing point for Soviet emigres, have been denied refugee status
in recent months. That development ``constitutes a departure from
longstanding U.S. policy,'' he said.
   ``For years, we have fought tirelessly together for the right of
Soviet citizens to emigrate,'' said Schumer. ``Now, when our efforts
have begun to bear fruit and the Soviet Union has finally begun to
open its gates, it is an unfortunate irony that the actions of our
own government, and not the Soviet, are creating new barriers to
these refugees' freedom.''
   Schumer and 34 other House members expressed similar concerns in
letters to Attorney General Richard Thornburgh and Secretary of
State George Shultz.
   The statement suggested that all Soviet Jews applying for refugee
status be granted it, if necessary raising the U.S. quota for
refugees, which is set at 24,500 for the Soviet Union and Eastern
Europe in the year that ends Sept. 30. Requests from the Soviet
Union alone have been running 2,000 a month.
   Schumer and the groups also proposed that the State Department
dip into its $30 million emergency refugee fund to meet the costs of
processing and resettling Jewish emigres and that Congress work to
replace the money later. Jewish refugee aid agencies ``are prepared
to meet their total financial responsibilities'' in partnership with
the government, the statement said.
   The backlog of visa applications in the Rome INS office has
reached more than 5,000, Schumer said. The INS should increase its
staff in Rome to expedite visas, the statement suggested.
   And the Reagan administration should restore its policy of
considering all Soviet Jews as refugees, Schumer said. To be
considered a refugee, U.S. policy states that indidividuals must be
at risk of religious or political persecution in their homelands.
   Despite reforms initiated by Soviet leader Mikahil Gorbachev,
Soviet Jews still suffer discrimination, anti-Semitism and limited
opportunities, the Jewish groups said.
   Last week, Thornburgh said he was expanding the government's
``parole authority'' to admit an additional 2,000 Soviet emigres per
month. The move came after Shultz requested it, and it was
characterized as an interim step.
   But many refugee applicants do not want the parole status,
because they lose the entitlement they otherwise would have to
federal aid for transportation and resettlement, and are barred from
later seeking citizenship or permanent resident status.
   The groups joining Schumer in the statement were the Council of
Jewish Federations, the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society, the National
Conference on Soviet Jewry, the Union of Councils for Soviet Jews,
the American Jewish Committee, the American Jewish Congress, the
Anti-Defamation League and the Coalition to Free Soviet Jews.
   The number of Jews permitted to leave the Soviet Union has grown
from 681 in 1986 to 15,640 in the first 11 months of 1988.

<HEAD>Soviet Report Says Saudis Now `Compromising' On Afghanistan</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MANAMA, Bahrain (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Soviet official said in an interview
released Wednesday that Saudi Arabia has softened its stance on
Afghanistan and agrees with Moscow that Moslem guerrillas have no
exclusive right to form a future government there.
   The chief of the Soviet Foreign Ministry's department for the
Persian Gulf, Alexander Ivanov Galitsyn, was interviewed by the
London-based newsletter Mideast Mirror.
   It quoted Galitsyn as saying Saudi Arabia's role in acting as
host at the first peace negotiations between the Soviets and the
Afghan guerrillas was possible because the Saudis amended their
demand for an unconditional Soviet pullout.
   ``The talks in Taif confirmed that Saudi Arabia, one of the most
influential Islamic states, had renounced the principle of
confrontation, and is helping facilitate the Afghan settlement on
the basis of balance of interests and reasonable compromise,''
Galitsyn was quoted as saying.
   The remarks quoted by the newsletter were telexed to The
Associated Press in Bahrain.
   Galitsyn was quoted as saying that the past Saudi stand at all
international forums was based on no compromise with the Kabul
regime and ``complete and unconditional'' withdrawal of Soviet
troops from Afghanistan.
   ``It looks however, as if the general global changes following an
improvement in Soviet-American relations, and the assertion of the
new political thinking, have had a certain impact on Riyadh's
outlook,'' the newletter quoted him as saying.
   The U.N.-brokered Geneva accords in April, where agreement was
reached on the pullout of an estimated 100,000 Soviet troops from
Afghanistan, coincided with the Soviet-U.S. summit and the
intermediate nuclear forces treaty.
   The guerrillas, known as mujahedeen, or holy warriors, were not
represented, but their backers, the United States and Pakistan,
concluded the agreement with the Soviets. The pullout was scheduled
to be completed by Feb. 15, although the Soviets have delayed
because the rebels continued their military operations.
   Galitsyn disclosed that Saudi Arabia helped ensure that the
Geneva accord would be accepted by the mujahedeen, the newsletter
said. He did not elaborate.
   Referring to a visit by Soviet Foreign Ministry officials to
Riyadh in early 1988, Galitsyn said the two sides noted that an
Afghan settlement would improve the political atmosphere in the
region and chart ways of eliminating other hotbeds of tension,
according to Mideast Mirror.
   ``As the talks continued, Saudi Arabia gave to understand that
the withdrawal of Soviet troops from Afghanistan and the settlement
of this problem in general would remove the chief element
undermining understanding between the U.S.S.R. and the Islamic
world,'' he was quoted as saying, in apparent reference to Saudis
linking diplomatic ties with the withdrawal from Afghanistan.

   President Reagan signed a proclamation
Wednesday that implemented tariff- and duty-cutting provisions of
the U.S.-Canada Free Trade Agreement.
   Reagan's proclamation was only a technicality, since the
legislation passed by Congress implementing the U.S. end of the
agreement stipulated that the president would have to sign such a
document 15 days before the commencement of tariff and duty relief.
   The phase-in of cuts in tariffs and import duties on a wide range
of Canadian products already was scheduled to take place on Jan. 1,
so Reagan had to act by 12:01 a.m. EST Thursday.
   The U.S. part of the agreement was consummuated with Reagan's
signature of the implementing legislation earlier this year. But the
agreement has yet to be approved by the Canadian Parliament.
   Prime Minister Brian Mulroney and Reagan both have formally
signed the historic agreement, expanding the world's largest trading
partnership but raising fears in Canada of U.S. domination.
   The agreement, if approved by the Canadian Parliament, would
eliminate tariffs over a 10-year period; dismantle many investment
barriers; free up trade in energy and services; and create
Canadian-U.S. panels to settle disputes.

   Approximately 8,600 employees of the Department
of Health and Human Services will be subject to random drug testing
under a plan announced Wednesday by HHS Secretary Otis R. Bowen.
   That works out to roughly 7 percent of the 118,000-member
workforce of the sprawling department that includes such agencies as
the Food and Drug Administration, the National Institutes of Health
and the Social Security Administration.
   ``This department, as the nation's leader in drug abuse
prevention, education, research and treatment, should take the
initiative to deter illegal drug use and to assist in the
rehabilitation of drug-using employees,'' Bowen said in a memo to
all employees.
   The HHS plan, adopted in response to an executive order by
President Reagan in 1986 requiring drug testing at all federal
agencies, identifies 80 job categories subject to random testing.
   Most of the categories involve employees in health care and
medical research, including those who provide direct patient care or
who handle hazardous or sensitive materials.
   Security personnel and those operating potentially hazardous
equipment also are included.
   The National Treasury Employees Union called the drug testing
plan ``a cruel holiday gift to thousands of innocent federal
employees and Ronald Reagan's parting shot at the constitutional
rights of those who labor for the government.''
   Robert M. Tobias, NTEU president, said the union was examining
the HHS program and would sue ``at the first drop if any members of
our HHS bargaining unit are included in the plan.'' He said the
union had succeeded in stopping similar drug testing in the
Department of Agriculture's food and nutrition division and is
confident it will win its case against the U.S. Customs Service.
   The plan also makes the department secretary and undersecretary
and other senior officials subject to testing.
   ``The decision to go forward with random testing was made only
after months of careful review and consideration of the privacy
concerns of our employees,'' Bowen said in his memo.
   The HHS plan calls for at least 10 percent of the 8,600 employees
subject to testing to be screened for marijuana and cocaine use
annually.
   The testing technically could begin as quickly as 60 days after
publication of Wednesday's memo, but department officials said it
probably will take longer.
   Each of the employees subject to testing will be notified in
writing that they are in that category at least 30 days before any
testing is carried out, the memo said.
   In addition to random testing for current employees, the plan
calls for drug tests to be administered to applicants for jobs in
the covered positions.

   A pilot who suffered a heart attack while his plane
was on the tarmac, waiting to depart, was quoted as saying he flew
his charter flight on to Spain rather than risk losing a takeoff
slot, a published report said Wednesday.
   The charter pilot's story was among 100 reports collected under
the Royal Air Force Institue of Medicine's confidential human
factors incident reporting program, the Daily Telegraph newspaper
said. The pilot and his employer were not identified, nor was the
date of the incident disclosed.
   The pilot reported feeling an intense pain high in his chest
while waiting to take off from Manchester in northern England.
   He reportedly asked his co-pilot to take over the flight to
Malaga and ``to keep an eye on me.''
   ``At that time of the morning in Manchester Airport there was no
one available to give medical advice at short notice,'' the pilot
was quoted as saying.
   ``I had 119 passengers already on the aircraft and a tight
departure slot, missing which would have meant a five-hour delay.''
   Despite further pain, the pilot accepted another flight the next
day.
   ``On return, I found I was not able to walk in from the aircraft
without the pain returning,'' he was quoted as saying.
   Three days later, the pilot said he collapsed during a cardiac
stress test at a hospital and suffered a massive heart attack.

<TEXT>
   A Roman Catholic priest's suit to regain his
theology chair at Catholic University went to trial Wednesday _
pitting claims of academic freedom against the church's right to
discipline its clergy.
   The Rev. Charles E. Curran claims the university breached his
contract by removing him from a tenured theology professorship
because of his dissent from church teaching.
   The university contends that it was merely enforcing the highest
authority of the Vatican, which had revoked Curran's right to teach
Roman Catholic theology.
   As an ordained priest, the university contends, Curran has an
obligation to obey the revocation of his ``canonical mission'' to
teach Catholic theology.
   The non-jury trial in Superior Court provides an unusual look at
the internal functioning of the Roman Catholic hierarchy,
particularly the steps taken to discipline a priest for holding
theological views at odds with those of the church.
   It will feature the testimony of two of the church's highest
officials in this country.
   The first witness to take the stand in Judge Frederick H.
Weisberg's courtroom was Cardinal James A. Hickey, the archbishop of
Washington and chancellor of Catholic University.
   Cardinal Joseph Bernardin, archbishop of Chicago and a former
chairman of the university's trustees, also is scheduled to testify.
   Curran's attorney, Paul Saunders, argued that his client was
illegally denied the rights of academic freedom that were
specifically adopted following a strike in 1967.
   ``If the notion of academic freedom in the specific context of
the present case means anything, it means the university guaranteed
a freedom in the face of public dissent from certain church
teachings,'' Saunders said in pre-trial arguments.
   Curran's disagreement with church teachings on homosexuality and
birth control and other positions he took in his book, ``Faithful
Dissent,'' prompted Vatican authorities to declare him unqualified
to teach Catholic theology.
   ``Father Curran thinks he hasn't an obligation to his church to
abide by this declaration,'' said Kevin Baine, an attorney
representing the university. Curran wants to transform Catholic
University into something that he ``wants it to be,'' Baine argued.
   Curran was, in effect, asking the university to join him in
defying orders from the Vatican, Baine said.
   The judge agreed with Baine's contention that he has no power to
decide whether Curran's dismissal was consistent with church law.
But Weisberg ruled that the issue in dispute was whether both sides
understood canon law governed Curran's contract to teach at the
university when it was signed and renewed.
   Curran, who rejected an offer to teach ethics outside the
university's religious faculty, contends he never was explicitly
conferred a ``canonical mission'' to teach theology.
   But in his testimony, Hickey rejected this claim, saying such a
mission was implicitly granted to Curran when he was hired in 1965.
   Hickey testified that revoking Curran's status on the theology
faculty was justified because ``the case of Father Curran had become
a widely known matter.''
   ``It has caused, in my opinion, a great deal of harm to the
church.'' the archbishop testified.
   It was particularly important that Curran be disciplined because
of the university's ``unique relationship both with the Holy See and
the Catholic Church in this country.''
   ``It seems inconceivable to the board of trustees of the
university that we could simply join in defiance on the part of
Father Curran,'' Hickey testified.
   Since his suspension from Catholic University in 1987, Curran,
54, has been a visiting professor at Cornell University. He
currently has a one-year appointment at the University of Southern
California.

<HEAD>Judges Ask AIDS-infected Inmates to Enter Pleas By Phone</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BIRMINGHAM, Ala. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Three judges say they asked defendents
infected with the AIDS virus to telephone in their pleas to protect
the court staff, but advocates for AIDS victims called the judges
paranoid and their action unconstitutional.
   Jefferson County District Judges Mike McCormick, O.L. Johnson and
Jack Montgomery said they simply asked that the defendants waive
their right to appear in court, and all did so. McCormick and
Johnson said their bailiffs don't want to handle the prisoners for
fear of getting acquired immune deficiency syndrome.
   ``I don't think we can ban them, but if I suggest (to their
lawyers) that maybe they don't want to be here, they waive their
rights,'' said Johnson.
   ``I'm not going to bring someone in here erupted with herpes or
tuberculosis. It's not just AIDS,'' Montgomery said. ``I'm not going
to have someone come down here and infect the general public and
me.''
   One of the inmates, John Louis O'Neal, said he wanted to appear
in court but was afraid he would anger the judge and receive a
harsher sentence if he did.
   ``My lawyer told me to do it over the phone because he didn't
want to make him (the judge) mad,'' O'Neal said in a Birmingham
Post-Herald interview published Tuesday.
   Steve Haeberle, a member of the state board of the Civil
Liberties Union of Alabama, said the judges were disregarding their
obligation to provide defendants with ``speedy, public trials.'' But
the judges denied any constitutional rights were violated.
   McCormick said no guidelines on courtroom handling of AIDS
defendants were available from the state Bar Association. ``I guess
we'll have to decide on a case-by-case basis,'' he said.
   The bailiffs and the judges were concerned about a violent
defendant, who could bite or bleed in a fight, McCormick said.
   But Dr. Michael Saag, an AIDS specialist at University Hospital
in Birmingham, said it was unlikely that a person could get infected
with the AIDS virus through a human bite or during a fight.
   ``To my knowledge it has never happened,'' he said.
   A report by the U.S. surgeon general on AIDS transmission says
that although the AIDS virus has been found in saliva, no instance
of transmission from saliva has been reported.
   McCormick used a telephone hookup to listen to the guilty plea
entered April 29 by O'Neal on a burglary charge. The judge gave him
probation, but O'Neal, 30, was back behind bars when interviewed
recently.
   Now locked up on third-degree theft and stolen property charges,
along with probation violation, O'Neal is being kept in medical
isolation with two other inmates who tested positive for the AIDS
virus.
   David Gespass, an attorney who now represents O'Neal, has filed a
petition to overturn O'Neal's convictions because his client was not
in court to give his plea or to be sentenced.
   ``Everyone has a right to face their accusers and the right to be
present in a court to be sentenced,'' Gespass said.
   ``They're so paranoid, they don't want anyone in who's even
thought to have AIDS,'' said Harry J. Blalock, who previously
represented O'Neal. ``I think it's a misunderstanding of how it can
be transmitted.''

<TEXT>
   A Supreme Court justice on
Wednesday sentenced a guerrilla commander and nine other mixed-race
men to prison terms of up to 15 years for grenade and mine attacks.
   About 200 people, mostly women, lined the streets outside the
courthouse and sang ``God Bless Africa'' after the decision. Some
protesters who followed the van leaving with the prisoners were
chased and bitten by police dogs.
   Justice Denys Williamson handed out prison terms ranging from two
to 15 years, but gave four of the men suspended sentences. After
they were freed, Anglican Archbishop Desmond Tutu hailed the four as
``heroes'' in the struggle against the system of apartheid.
   When the van carrying the 10 sentenced prisoners appeared, the
crowd ran down the street after it, and policemen with dogs chased
them. Several people were bitten and knocked down on the street by
the dogs, who were on leashes.
   Williamson said he had no quarrel with the broad political
beliefs of the accused but said they were being punished for the
means they used to achieve their aims. Six had admitted some degree
of complicity in the attacks, but they also said they had been
coerced into giving evidence.
   Ashley Forbes, 22, commander of guerrilla units in the Cape area,
was sentenced to 15 years in prison for terrorism and playing a
leading role in the armed wing of the outlawed ANC.
   Williamson described him as ``a dedicated terrorist.'' Forbes was
found guilty in September of setting a mine that exploded at a bus
shelter near the Cape Town home of President P.W. Botha and of
staging three grenade attacks on policemen's homes. Two people were
injured in the attacks.
   Peter Jacobs, 23, was sentenced to 14 years for the bombing of an
electrical pylon and staging a grenade attack. Nicklo Pedro, 20,
also received a 14-year sentence for acting as Forbes' contact.
   The other seven, all in their 20s, were sentenced to terms of two
to 12 years for storing arms and participating in grenade and
gasoline bomb attacks on policemen's homes.
   The four given suspended sentences received a standing ovation
when they entered St. George's Cathedral and were welcomed by Tutu
as ``our heroes.''
   ``In the history we shall write in this country your names and
the names of your sons will be written in letters of gold,'' said
Tutu. He said those who had been sentenced ``love freedom and
justice so much that they are prepared to pay the price for it.''
   The four were found guilty of failing to report a suspected
terrorist, hiding a grenade and failing to report an intended
gasoline bomb attack.
   Under apartheid, South Africa's 26 million blacks have no vote in
national affairs. The 5 million whites control the economy and
maintain separate districts, schools and health services.
   The ANC is fighting to end apartheid and replace the government
with a one-man, one-vote political system.

   Stuart Symington, the nation's first Air
Force secretary and a U.S. senator from Missouri for 24 years, died
Wednesday at his home of heart disease. He was 87.
   ``He'd been ill with angina and weakness of the heart,'' said his
son, James Symington, the late senator's son. His father died during
his sleep, Symington, a Washington, D.C., lawyer, said from his
father's home here.
   The elder Symington served in the U.S. Senate from 1953 to 1976,
deciding at that time not to seek re-election. A year later, he
married Ann ``Nancy'' Hemingway Watson of New Canaan and relocated
to the wealthy Connecticut community just north of New York City.
   He married his first wife, Evelyn Wadsworth Symington, daughter
of then-U.S. Sen. James W. Wadsworth of New York, in 1924. She died
in 1972.
   Symington, a Democrat, held six jobs in President Harry Truman's
administration from 1945 to 1952. Prior to entering government
service, Symington was a successful businessman. He was a ``favorite
son'' candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination in 1956
and 1960.
   In recent years, Symington occupied himself preparing his memoirs
and playing golf, James Symington said.
   ``He was very active later in life,'' his son said. ``He kept up
with current events. He was a sportsman all of his life.''
   ``Stuart Symington was a renaissance man,'' former U.S. Sen.
Thomas Eagleton, D-Mo., said in St. Louis. ``He could do anything,
in any discipline and do it very well: business, sports, executive
and legislative branches of the federal government. When I went to
the Senate in 1968, he became my political father.''
   Symington was born in Amherst, Mass., on June 26, 1901. He was
educated at Yale University, which he left in 1923, and entered
business. From 1938-45, he was president and chairman of Emerson
Electric Co. in St. Louis.
   Symington retired in 1976 after 24 years in the Senate. He was
re-elected handily in 1958 and 1964. In 1970, his margin dropped to
about 37,000 votes over then-Republican State Attorney General John
C. Danforth.
   He campaigned actively as a ``favorite son'' candidate before the
1960 Democratic convention but lost to John F. Kennedy.
   Symington was probably best-known as the watchdog of America's
armed forces for nearly 30 years of public service, not only in the
Senate but before that as secretary of the Air Force.
   In the Truman administration, Symington served as the nation's
first Air Force secretary from 1947-1950.
   In 1945, after Symington had become a millionaire industrialist
with a knack for troubleshooting ailing industries, Truman called
him to Washington, where he was surplus property administrator and
then assistant secretary of war for air.
   In 1947, when the Air Force became a separate service, Symington
became secretary under the reorganized Defense Department. He
subsequently was chairman of the National Security Resources Board
and head of the Reconstruction Finance Corp.
   Symington was regarded as a pragmatist and this outlook resulted
in dramatic changes of position over the years on two major issues:
defense spending and the Vietnam War.
   For much of his Washington career, Symington was known as a ``big
bomber and big-missile man,'' and in the early phases of the Vietnam
War, as a hawk. But as defense expenditures mounted in the late
1960s and early 1970s, he became a critic of ever-larger Pentagon
budgets and an opponent of a number of costly and elaborate weapons
projects.
   In the 1970s, he became increasingly concerned over the
proliferation of nuclear weapons and became a vocal advocate of arms
control.
   Symington served in World War I as an Army second lieutenant.
   In addition to his wife and son, Symington is survived by a
second son, Stuart Symington Jr., a St. Louis attorney, six
grandchildren and six great-grandchildren.
   A private interment service will be held at Saturday at the
Washington Cathedral in Washington, D.C., and a memorial service
will be held at the cathedral Jan. 10, James Symington said.

   Here is an explanation of U.N. Security

Palestine Liberation Organization had to accept before a U.S.-PLO
dialogue could begin:
   Security Council Resolution 242, adopted Nov. 22, 1967, mainly
calls for withdrawal of Israeli armed forces from captured
territories and the end of all hostilities in the Middle East, with
all states recognizing the rights of the others to ``live in peace
within secure and recognized boundaries free from threats or acts of
force.''
   Security Council Resolution 338, passed Oct. 22, 1973, during the
Arab-Israeli war, calls for an end to the fighting; calls on all
parties to begin implementing Resolution 242; and most importantly,
calls for negotiations between the parties for ``a just and durable
peace in the Middle East.''

   President Reagan said Wednesday he had
authorized the State Department to enter into ``a substantive
dialogue'' with the Palestine Liberation Organization. His
announcement came after PLO chairman Yasser Ara Bush was insisting on a
clear, unequivocal statement to clear the way for discussions.
   Bush's office said later that Bush would have no statement on
Reagan's decision.
   Shultz said he had discussed the decision with representatives of
Israel and he added, ``Our commitment to the security of Israel
remains unflinching.''
   Arafat's statement included this language on the equally
difficult question of PLO involvement in terrorist activities: ``I
repeat for the record that we totally and absolutely renounce all
forms of terrorism, including individual terrorism, group and the
state terrorism.''
   In response to a question, he said, ``I do expect and hope that
the United States will drop its veto so that the Middle East can be
discussed.''
   Shultz, asked if Bush was aware of Reagan's decision, said, ``The
president and the vice president both have followed these
developments closely and they have reviewed, each of them, this most
recent development, and they both agree that under these
circumstances the conditions for a substantive dialogue that we have
had in place since 1975 have been met and so we should state that we
are ready to undertake that dialogue.''
   At his news conference, Bush vowed to maintain a tough stand on
the PLO and insisted that Arafat make a definitive statement about
Israel's right to exist and a clear renunciation of terrorism.
   That means that the Palestine National Council, the legislative
arm of the PLO, must subscribe to the statement as well as Arafat,
he said.
   Bush also called on Israel to relinquish territory captured from
Jordan and Egypt in the 1967 Six-Day war. But while saying that
Israel ought to be ``pulling back'' in compliance with two U.N.
Security Council resolutions, the president-elect placed much
greater emphasis on the PLO.
   ``I want a clear statement on renunciation of terror,'' Bush
said. ``I want a very clear, unambiguous statement on the right of
Israel to exist as a state, and I want a clear endorsement of
Security Council resolution 242.''
   Bush cited the resolution's assurance that all states _ by
implication Israel as well as the Arabs _ have a right to live
within secure boundaries.
   ``If Mr. Arafat takes a step that brings us a little closer to
that, fine, we're glad that happens,'' Bush said. But, he went on,
``Before we have a dialogue with the PLO the signals have to be
clear, unmistakable, unambiguous ....''
   Bush and Arafat spoke almost simultaneously and it was not clear
whether he was aware of the PLO chairman's statements during the
news conference.
   Before Arafat's speech Tuesday to the U.N. General Assembly in
Geneva, Swedish diplomats passed the word that he was about to
satisfy U.S. demands. Secretary of State George P. Shultz notified
Israeli Ambassador Moshe Arad, but then in Shultz's judgment the
speech fell short.
   Bush, in his statement, subscribed to the three-point test set by
President Reagan and Shultz for a U.S. dialogue with the PLO.
   The three requirements are explicit recognition of Israel,
renunciation of terrorism in all forms and acceptance of the two
Security Council resolutions.
   Meanwhile, Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak urged Shultz by
telephone from Cairo to have ``a more positive reaction'' to
Arafat's latest moves, said a U.S. official who demanded anonymity.

   A wave of strikes swept Greece on Wednesday
when public sector employees, educators and hospital staff walked
out to protest the government's budget for next year.
   About 1,000 protesters marched through the capital shouting
slogans against the Socialist government's $27 billion budget _ the
highest in the country's history with a projected deficit of $9.2
billion.
   The demonstrators marched through the city center to Parliament,
where it is being debated by the lawmakers.
   Most of the strikers demand inflation-indexed salary increases
and higher basic salaries. Inflation is expected to reach 15 percent
this year.
   Some public transportation and ministerial services were hampered
as state engineers staged a strike, and employees of municipalities
in and around the capital began a six-day walkout.
   Officials asked the public to refrain from putting out their
garbage until the strike ended.
   Public schools ranging from elementary to university level,
closed down for the day as teachers and professors protested the
government's allocation for education.
   The educators want the government to allocate at least 15 percent
of the budget for education instead of the less than 10 percent
budgeted. The bigger allocation would cover an increase in salaries,
more books and improved educational facilities ranging from
laboratories to housing for university students.
   Public hospitals maintained skeleton crews for emergencies only
as doctors and staff staged a 24-hour strike to demand higher wages
and to protest the allocation in the budget for health services.
   The government said the budget deficit will be covered by
increased taxes on tobacco, alcohol and lottery tickets and through
domestic and foreign loans.

<HEAD>Witness Links Hamadi Case to 1987 Hijacking Of Air Afrique Jet</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A witness at the trial of
confessed TWA hijacker Mohammed Ali Hamadi on Wednesday linked
Hamadi's case to the commandeering of an Air Afrique airliner in
1987 in which a Frenchman was killed.
   ``Among the demands made by the Air Afrique hijacker (Hussein)
Hariri was the freedom of the Hamadi brothers in Germany,'' said
witness Theodor Heusele, a West German federal police investigator.
   Hamadi is charged with murder and air piracy in the hijacking of
TWA flight 847 on June 14, 1985 on a flight from Athens to Rome.
U.S. Navy diver Robert Stethem was killed and 39 Americans were held
hostage for 17 days.
   Heusele, 51, told the court he had been involved with the Hamadi
case since the Lebanese man was arrested at Frankfurt airport Jan.
13, 1987.
   Hamadi's brother, Abbas Hamadi, is serving a 13-year prison term
in West Germany for his part in kidnapping two German businessmen in
Beirut to try and gain his brother's release. The two Germans have
since been freed.
   Heusele was asked by the court if there was any connection
between Mohammed Hamadi and another Shiite Moslem, Hussein Hariri,
who is accused of last year's hijacking of the Air Afrique airliner.
   Hariri was arrested in Geneva, where he diverted the Air Afrique
jet on a flight from Rome to Paris on July 24, 1987. Swiss officials
say Hariri shot and killed a French passenger on the plane before
police overpowered him.
   Heusele noted that during the 1985 TWA hijacking, Hamadi and his
accomplice aboard the plane, identified as Hassan Ezzeddine,
demanded the release of all Shiite Moslem prisoners being held in
Israel. Israel later released 700 of the prisoners.
   ``Hariri was among those released by the Israelis,'' Heusele told
the court.
   But Heusele said investigators were unable to connect Hamadi or
Ezzeddine to other hijackings, although Hamadi has told the court in
previous testimony that his accomplice was involved in an earlier
hijacking. Ezzeddine remains a fugitive.
   Since Hamadi's trial began in Frankfurt on July 5, numerous
witnesses have said the hijackers on TWA flight 847 savagely beat
passengers and forced the plane to land three times in Beirut and
twice in Algiers.
   U.S. Navy diver Stethem, of Waldorf, Md., was shot and killed
when the plane landed the second time in Beirut early on June 15,
1985.
   Hamadi has admitted taking part in the hijacking, but has
repeatedly said his accomplice killed Stethem.
   The trial, in a high security courtroom in Frankfurt's
Preungesheim prison compound, was recessed until Dec. 20 when
another federal police investigator is scheduled to testify.

Government</HEAD>

   Labor Party leader Shimon Peres announced
Wednesday he is willing to become finance minister, removing a major
roadblock to forming a national coalition government with the
right-wing Likud, TV reports said.
   Peres, now foreign minister, said he would accept the finance
post on condition he have full freedom to deal with economic
matters, Israel television said.
   Peres aides were not available at offices or residences to
comment on the report.
   Negotiators from the Likud bloc and Labor have been holding
renewed talks since Monday in an effort to form a broad-based
government. The two leading parties have been jockeying for support
from smaller religious parties to form a government after
parliamentary elections on Nov. 1, when Likud won 40 seats to
Labor's 39 in the 120-seat parliament.
   Wednesday's announcement represents a major concession by the
left-of-center Labor Party leader, who wanted to be foreign minister
in a new government because it would allow him to pursue a Middle
East peace initiative.
   The move also could hurt Peres' popularity because Israel's
recession and high inflation could bring about unpopular economic
measures.
   In making his announcement, Peres said Labor should head a
parliamentary committee responsible for making key economic
decisions. The Likud bloc has said one of its own members should
head the committee.
   The television said Likud ministers ended a meeting late
Wednesday and reported that differences remained between Likud and
Labor, particularly over policy on Jewish settlements in occupied
territory.
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, who leads Likud, has pressed talks
with Labor in an apparent effort to avoid some far-reaching
concessions to the religious parties on sensitive issues, including
a law defining who is a Jew. U.S. Jewish groups have strongly
opposed the law.
   Labor has demanded two of the four key government posts o join a
broad-based government. Labor's defense minister, Yitzhak Rabin, is
expected to keep his post. Shamir is expected to remain prime
minister.
   Labor and Likud have governed jointly since inconclusive
elections in 1984.

<HEAD>Snow Blankets Michigan's Upper Peninsula</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Wintry weather was back in full force Wednesday as another surge
of cold, arctic air moved toward the nation's midsection, with gusty
winds bringing subzero wind chills. A blanket of heavy, wet snow
measured up to 16 inches in parts of Michigan's Upper Peninsula,
with more on the way.
   Gusty winds and temperatures in the single digits and teens
produced wind chill temperatures in the 15 to 25 below zero range
early Wednesday afternoon across North Dakota.
   Ironwood, Mich., had measured 12 inches by morning and Marquette
had 16 inches by afternoon. Two inches fell in one hour at Sawyer
Air Force Base in Marquette where winds gusted to 37 mph.
   Up to 8 more inches were forecast in parts of Michigan, and snow
was also falling in northern Wisconsin, Montana and Wyoming.
   The weather was expected to change markedly over the central
Plains and Rockies as the arctic cold hit. In the high Plains, areas
that had record temperatures in the 60s and lower 70s on Tuesday
were expected to have strong winds with snow and single-digit
temperatures by Thursday.
   After morning temperatures near freezing across portions of the
Gulf Coast region, temperatures had warmed into the 60s by afternoon.
   Elsewhere, skies were mostly clear across the West Coast states
and from the desert Southwest to the central and southern Great
Plains.
   Early afternoon temperatures were in the 50s and 60s in the south
Atlantic and Gulf Coast states and as far north as the lower Ohio
and middle Mississippi valleys.
   Temperatures around the nation at 2 p.m. EST ranged from 7
degrees at Devils Lake, N.D., to 79 degrees at both Harlingen and
McAllen, Texas. The early morning low in the nation was zero at
Alamosa, Colo.
   The forecast for Thursday called for snow from parts of Nevada
across the central and southern portions of the Plateau and Rockies
to sections of the central and southern Great Plains; snow showers
were expected from Michigan across the lower Great Lakes to the
northern and central Appalachians; and rain showers from
southeastern Texas across the Gulf Coast states and Tennessee Valley
to the southern Appalachians. A few thunderstorms were expected in
the central Gulf Coast region.
   Highs only in the single digits and teens were forecast from the
northern Great Lakes across the upper Mississippi Valley and the
northern half of the Great Plains to the central Rockies.
Temperatures were expected to remain below zero over northern
Minnesota and northeastern North Dakota. Highs were forecast in the
20s and 30s in northern New England, the lower Great Lakes, the Ohio
Valley, the middle Mississippi Valley, northwest Texas, much of the
intermountain West and western Montana. Readings were expected in
the 60s and 70s in the south Atlantic and Gulf Coast states and from
southern Arizona to portions of California. Elsewhere, highs were
expected in the 40s and 50s.

   President Reagan's decision allowing the State
Department to open a dialogue directly with the Palestine Liberation
Organization came after a day of intense consultations inside the
administration.
   The White House gave this chronology of events:
   _9:30 a.m. EST: Reagan's national security adviser, Lt. Gen.
Colin Powell, briefed the president and discussed PLO Chairman
Yasser Arafat's press conference and the possibility that the
``right language'' might be used, Fitzwater said.
   _1:30 p.m. EST: Secretary of State George Shultz met with Reagan,
his chief of staff Kenneth Duberstein, Powell and Duberstein's
deputy, M.B. Oglesby, and the president was told that Arafat was
definitely expected to make a statement. Reagan reaffirmed his
commitment to state he'd be willing to authorize a dialogue if
Arafat met the required U.S. conditions.
   _4:00 p.m. EST: Shultz called Powell to tell him that he had a
copy of Arafat's statement and that the State Department's initial
assessment was that the statement was acceptable.
   _4:25 p.m. EST: Powell briefed President-elect Bush and showed
him a copy of the Arafat statement.
   _5:12 p.m. EST: Powell and Duberstein called the president to say
that they had reviewed Arafat's statement, and that the assessment
of his top aides was that it met the U.S. conditions. They asked the
president for his final decision, and Reagan decided at that point
to authorize the dialogue.

   The Justice Department said Wednesday it had no
plans to delay the repatriation of some convicted Mariel Cuban
detainees to their homeland.
   Gary Copeland, a deputy associate attorney general, said no
change in the plans to repatriate Cubans was contemplated and that
the next load of detainees would be flown to Cuba shortly.
   The U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service released a
statement Wednesday night saying four Mariel Cubans would be
deported Thursday morning. The detainees were scheduled to board a
plane at the Birmingham, Ala., airport for the flight back to their
homeland.
   However, an aide to Auxiliary Bishop Agustin A. Roman of Miami,
who discussed the Cuban issue with top Justice Department officials
Wednesday, said Roman would pursue the matter further with State
Department officials.
   Rafael Penalver, a lawyer representing Roman, told reporters that
a 1984 agreement with Cuba under which the repatriation of some
detainees was resumed earlier this month involves ``very, very
serious foreign policy implications.'' He would not elaborate.
   Roman met with Attorney General Dick Thornburgh and Associate
Attorney General Francis Keating.
   Copeland said the ``basic argument'' of the Miami delegation was
that a Justice Department process of examining whether the detainees
should be repatriated was ``a paper review'' rather than a
full-fledged hearing with witnesses and presentation of evidence.
   The Justice Department review program has survived legal
challenges and ``we expect to continue in this manner,'' Copeland
said, although department officials agreed to consider specific
written complaints which the Roman delegation will submit.
   Some 400 Mariel Cubans are on a Justice Department list of people
who might face repatriation, and another 400 to 500 will be placed
on the list once they finish serving prison and jail terms.
   The Justice Department repatriation review process was
established in the aftermath of riots by Cuban detainees in Atlanta
and Oakdale, La., a year ago. The riots were triggered by plans to
resume repatriation of the prisoners to Cuba.
   The program finally resumed Dec. 2 with the return of five
detainees to Cuba. The five were among 125,000 people who had fled
Cuba in the so-called Mariel flotilla in 1980.

<HEAD>Yes, There Is A Santa Claus, Judge Rules</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JACK SCHREIBMAN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Santa Claus exists, a judge ruled on
Wednesday, after an appearance on the witness chair from a
rosy-nosed old gent in a red suit and white beard who rumbled a
familiar ``Ho, ho, ho!''
   ``I am going to make a determination that there is a Santa
Claus,'' decided Municipal Court Judge George T. Choppelas. He was
presiding at San Francisco's mock Court of Historical Review and
Appeals, a just-for-fun San Francisco tradition with a real judge
and lawyers.
   ``As long as there is love and generosity and gift-giving,''
Choppelas went on, ``this court is going to find that there really,
really is a Santa Claus.''
   In a grave tone, the judge said he was drawing partly on legal
precedent set in the old movie, ``Miracle on 34th Street,'' in which
a New York court found for the defendant _ Santa Claus.
   Choppelas made his own ruling after a rollicking, 90-minute
``trial'' to consider the question, ``Is There Really a Santa
Claus?'' Some 150 spectators and journalists listened to the
half-serious, half-comical ``testimony'' that talked about love and
heart and spirit and an open hand.
   The inquiry started with a radio announcer's dramatic reading of
Clement Moore's ``A Visit From St. Nicholas.'' Anti-Claus lawyer
Frank Winston objected to the poem.
   Pro-Claus lawyer Wendy Nelder, a city supervisor, then asked the
spectators which of them had never written a letter to Santa Claus.
The request outraged Winston, who advised the audience, ``Take the
Fifth Amendment.''
   Winston poked fun at a Santa Claus doll, which was introduced as
evidence. He flipped it upside down and said, ``Made in Taiwan,
hah!''
   ``There is no proof Santa Claus was ever in San Francisco,'' he
said, noting that his fingerprints have never been found by police.
He drew a retort that Santa was no criminal.
   Testifying for the pro-Claus side, U.S. Post Office
Communications Specialist Alan Wald displayed a large drawing of the
Santa Claus, Ind., postmark and said firmly that none of the
thousands of letters from children addressed to the gentleman were
``returned to sender.''
   Winston said, however, that it was not possible for Santa to be
in ``zillions of places'' at once around the world.
   ``He has helpers,'' said Nelder. ``He's talented.''
   Finally, ``Ho, ho, ho!'' boomed out from behind a door and Santa
himself, toting a sack with toys and a golf club, appeared and sat
down in the witness chair. Winston attacked him, but Santa quickly
put him in his place.
   Santa reminded Winston that ``I got a letter from you when you
were 6 years old.''

<HEAD>Panel Refuses to Endorse Energy Department's Plan to Restart
Reactor</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Weapons Reactors</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The head of a Department of Energy scientific
advisory committee said Wednesday the panel is refusing to endorse
the department's plan for restarting one of the three weapons
production reactors currently shut down at the Savannah River Plant.
   John F. Ahearne, chairman of the Advisory Committee on Nuclear
Facilities Safety, said of DOE's proposed strategy for restarting
the K reactor at the South Carolina plant: ``I think our main
concern with it is that it is quite incomplete. ... It's only a
first step.''
   The just-completed DOE report outlined more than 160 separate
tasks for restarting the reactor, calling for a complete overhaul of
training, safety, management, operating and inspection procedures.
   It concluded that national security demands will require startup
of the K reactor before long-term safety improvements are completed.
   The three reactors at Savannah River are the nation's only source
for tritium, a radioactive isotope of hydrogen vital to boosting the
explosive power of modern nuclear warheads. Because tritium decays
at a rate of 5.5 percent a year, it needs to be replenished
regularly.
   In an interview, Ahearne said his committee was sending a letter
to Energy Secretary John S. Herrington spelling out the panel's
concerns.
   ``The overall gist of the letter ... is that we're essentially
declining to endorse the restart strategy. ... We see a large set of
problems. ... We think it is insufficient to be used as the basis to
go ahead and restart,'' he said.
   Ahearne, a former chairman of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission,
voiced concerns in several areas, including:
   _Restart philosophy. ``We didn't see represented in the document
something that could be called an overall philosophy. In other
words, what kind of safety standards is the department trying to
achieve?''
   _Setting safety criteria. ``We didn't really believe that the
department had laid out clearly enough what must be done. There are
a number of descriptions in that document that have the character of
improving safety. ... But it's not clear what would be an acceptance
criterion. So how would you know that you've met what must be done
before restart?''
   _Ultrasonic testing of pipes and welds. The DOE report failed to
specify use of high-tech ultrasonic testing techniques to help find
potentially dangerous cracks in piping.
   _Seismic resistance. ``We don't see in reading the seismic
description any clear statement of what level (of earthquake
resistance) the reactors must be brought to.''
   _Management. ``We are concerned that the management approach that
has been taken has now got too many people telling Savannah River,
the plant people, what to do. It's confusing to try to get a clear
line of authority. And that, in the long run, we thought would be a
major problem.''

   In what was already the deadliest year for Dallas
police, a fifth slaying was added when an undercover police officer
was fatally shot in a drug sting operation that went awry.
   Officer Lawrence R. Cadena, 43, was killed Tuesday night while
trying to buy drugs from several suspects at a convenience store to
make a drug-buy arrest with his partner, police spokesman Ed Spencer
said. Another man was killed and two others wounded.
   Sgt. James Chandler described the department's mood as
``somber,'' following the fifth shooting death of an officer this
year.
   ``Four was unbelievable,'' he said. ``Five was just _ I don't
know. You don't know what to say.''
   Before 1988, the year with the most police killings was 1972,
when three officers died.
   Cadena, shot in the abdomen, chest and both arms, was pronounced
dead at Baylor University Medical Center in Dallas about 10:30 p.m.
Tuesday, about 30 minutes after the shootout.
   Hector Rodriguez Jocimino, 36, of Dallas died of gunshot wounds
to the chest and back at Parkland Memorial Hospital, emergency room
supervisor Randy Blanchard said.
   Javier Suarez Medina, 20, was in serious condition Wednesday at
Parkland with wounds to the chest and abdomen, and Fernando
Fernandez, 17, was in serious condition with wounds to both legs,
officials said.
   ``It is my understanding that it was a buy-bust situation _ a
drug buy _ and we had more than one officer at the scene,'' Police
Chief Mack Vines said. ``Instead of the drug deal reaching fruition,
they were hijacked, as they say, shots were exchanged and our
officer was fatally wounded.''
   Chandler alleged that Medina fired the shots that killed Cadena,
while Fernandez was ``definitely an active participant in this
robbery attempt and murder.''
   Both Medina and Fernandez have been charged with capital murder,
and Fernandez also was charged with unlawful delivery of a
controlled substance, police said.
   Police at the scene of the shootout recovered 107 grams, or about
4 ounces, of a white powder believed to be cocaine.
   Jacomino, who was in a car across the street from the Stop'n Go
when he was shot to death, drove Medina to the store for the drug
deal, Chandler said.
   Jacomino was fatally shot by bullets fired by backup police
officer Sgt. David McCoy, authorities said. Police said they do not
know whether Jacomino was armed.
   Cadena, with 17 years as a police officer, had been a narcotics
officer since 1986. He also worked in that division from 1976-81.
   The City Council observed 30 seconds of silence Wednesday in
honor of the slain officer.
   The other officers killed this year are: James Joe, while he
questioned two burglary suspects; John Glenn Chase, in a
confrontation with a homeless person; Gary McCarthy, during an
attempted robbery in a grocery store; and Walter Williams, while
answering a disturbance in an apartment complex.
   The department has been criticized by some council members and
community minority leaders, who have accused police of being too
trigger-happy.
   In the Chase shooting, a mentally ill man grapped the officer's
gun in scuffle. A witness told police that three men standing nearby
urged the man to shoot Chase.
   That incident prompted former Police Chief Billy Prince to accuse
council members of creating an anti-police sentiment that led to the
attack.

   PLO chairman Yasser Arafat said Wednesday he
renounces ``all forms of terrorism'' and recognizes Israel's right
to live in peace and security. Hours later, President Reagan said
the United States will begin a dialogue with the PLO.
   PLO spokesman Ahmed Abdel Rahman said the U.S. decision means
``we can speak about an era of peace in the Middle East.'' He also
said Israel now was ``isolated'' because of its policies.
   Reagan said in Washington he authorized the State Department to
enter into ``a substantive dialogue'' with the Palestine Liberation
Organization.
   Secretary of State George Shultz told a news conference, held
simultaneously with Reagan's statement, ``Our object is not a
dialogue, our object is peace.''
   The Israeli Embassy in Washington denounced the U.S. decision in
a statement: ``We regret the United States decision to establish
contact with the PLO. We do not consider that this step will advance
the peace process in the Middle East.''
   An Israeli government official, speaking early Thursday in
Jerusalem on the condition he not be identified, said neither Shultz
nor other U.S. officials consulted Israel before the move. ``Not at
all,'' he said.
   The official also said Israel believed Arafat failed to fulfill
conditions laid down by Washington for recognition of the PLO, both
in his speech to the U.N. General Assembly Tuesday and at a news
conference in Geneva Wednesday.
   Arafat later left Geneva for Berlin, according to Rahman.
   Arafat told reporters in response to a question, ``I do expect
and hope that the United States will drop its veto so that the
Middle East can be discussed,'' referring to the earlier U.S.
refusal to talk with the PLO.
   Shultz said Wednesday night that the United States ``does not
recognize the declaration of an independent Palestinian state,''
made by the PLO in Algeria last month, but that it would be a
subject of discussion.
   Shultz said the U.S. channel for dialogue with the PLO would be
the American ambassador to Tunisia, Robert H. Pelletreau Jr. In
Tunis, Tunisia, the duty officer at the U.S. Embassy, Henry Ensher,
said he had no immediate information.
   The PLO's Rahman watched Shultz on TV with Swedish Foreign
Minister Sten Andersson. Andersson was instrumental in arranging for
a delegation of American Jews to meet Arafat in Geneva and was
widely reported to have acted as go-between in the past few days for
American-Palestinian contacts in Geneva.
   Andersson smiled broadly and nodded when Shultz remarked during
the telecast that President-elect George Bush was consulted on the
proceedings in Geneva.
   Rahman later told reporters, ``I say that this is, this American
statement to open dialogue with the PLO, is a historic change in the
struggle in the Middle East. With this American decision we can
speak about an era of peace in the Middle East ... peace for us and
our enemies, also.''
   He said in reference to Israel: ``They are isolated. They are
alone at this moment because of their unrealistic policies. They
should recognize the right of the Palestinian state to exist like
their state.''
   The U.N. meeting in Geneva, scheduled to end Thursday, was held
in Switzerland after the United States refused to grant Arafat a
visa to speak at U.N. Headquarters in New York. It had made little
progress toward holding an international conference on Middle East
peace that Arafat wants.
   Arafat began his news conference with a statement in English,
calling on European nations to play a greater role in bringing about
Middle East peace and insisting the Palestinian desire for peace was
real.
   ``I repeat for the record that we totally and absolutely renounce
all forms of terrorism, including individual terrorism, group and
the state terrorism,'' he said.
   But the Israeli official in Jerusalem said Thursday that Arafat's
remarks were ``insufficient'' because the PLO did not rule out
violence associated with the year-old Palestinian uprising in the
Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip, which has left more than
320 Palestinians and 13 Israelis dead.
   Arafat said his speech to the General Assembly made clear the PLO
accepts ``the right of all parties concerned in the Middle East
conflict to exist in peace and security, and as I have mentioned
including the state of Palestine, Israel and other neighbors.''
   He said again that the PLO accepts U.N. Resolutions 242 and 338,
which recognize the right of all Middle Eastern nations to safe and
secure borders.
   The acceptance is one of three conditions set by U.S. law for
dialogue with the PLO. The other are a clear recognition of Israel
and renunciation of terrorism by the PLO.
   Speaking mostly in Arabic and some English in answering
questions, he showed impatience with a question asking him to say
``yes'' or ``no'' on whether he accepts Israel.
   ``Didn't you read my statement?'' he asked, referring to his
Tuesday speech. ``It's entirely clear. What do you want? Do you want
me to do a striptease? It would be unseemly.''
   In a speech before the world body on Wednesday, U.S. Ambassador
Vernon Walters said the world should tell Israelis and Arabs it is
tired of their long conflict.
   Walters urged Israel to ``face up to the need for withdrawal from
occupied territories'' and the Palestinians to ``accommodate the
reality of Israel's existence.''
   Diplomats from Arab nations, the Soviet Union, China and Sweden
backed Arafat's call for an international peace conference.
   U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar called Arafat's
address ``a new and very important contribution to the peace
process.''

   President Reagan, in a stunning reversal, said
Wednesday that he had authorized the State Department to enter into
``a substantive dialogue'' with the Palestine Liberation
Organization, which the United States has long denounced as a
terrorist organization.
   The announcement came after PLO chairman Yasser Arafat said in
Geneva that he was renouncing ``all forms of terrorism.''
   Reagan's decision put to an end decades of U.S. isolation of the
Palestinian group, which Secretary of State George P. Shultz less
than three weeks ago accused anew of terrorism.
   The move shocked the Israeli government. Even before the official
announcement, the Israeli embassy called the decision regrettable
and said it would not advance the cause of peace in the Middle East.
   ``Israel will pursue its policy of searching for peaceful
solutions to the conflict through direct negotiations with
Palestinian Arabs and with Jordan,'' the Israeli statement said.
   Hassah Abdul Rahman, the PLO spokesman, said the decision to open
a dialogue was ``the right thing to do.''
   Asked whether it was a defeat for Israel he told CBS, ``It's not
a victory for one party over the other.''
   ``Our object is not a dialogue, our object is peace,'' Shultz
told reporters simultaneous to the release of Reagan's statement.
``When there will be a meeting, I don't know.''
   Asked if he had changed his mind about the PLO and Arafat, Shultz
said: ``I didn't change my mind. They made their statements clear.''
   But Shultz said the PLO had issued a statement in which it met
all three U.S. conditions for a dialogue: acceptance of U.N.
Security Council resolutions affirming the right of all states to
live in peace, recognition of Israel and renunciation of terrorism.
   ``As a result, the United States is prepared for a substantive
dialogue with PLO representatives,'' the secretary of state said.
   In Geneva, Arafat spoke of the equally difficult question of PLO
involvement in terrorist activities: ``I repeat for the record that
we totally and absolutely renounce all forms of terrorism, including
individual terrorism, group and the state terrorism.''
   In response to a question, he said, ``I do expect and hope that
the United States will drop its veto so that the Middle East can be
discussed.''
   The Israeli ambassador, Moshe Arad, said in an interview with The
Associated Press that he did not detect anything new in what Arafat
said Wednesday. He said he hoped the U.S. decision would not lead to
recognition of the PLO.
   ``I am disappointed by this decision,'' Arad said. ``I am not
trying to minimize that. But on the other hand, I think we should
keep a perspective on the overall relationship between the two
countries.''
   Arad said Arafat's remarks at a Geneva news conference do not
supersede the PLO's covenant, which calls for Israel's destruction.
   James Zogby, executive director of the Arab-American Institute,
hailed the U.S. decision, calling it an ``important step forward in
movement toward a real peace process.''
   ``The dialogue should throw into sharp relief the failure of
Israel to say yes to the very issues that the PLO has now acceded
to. Our hope is that the dialogue is productive and that peace is
now possible.''
   Dr. George E. Gruen, director of Middle East affairs of the
American Jewish Committee, called on the United States to insist
that the PLO ``match words with deeds. Specifically, we call upon
them to end their attacks on Israeli civilians and all other forms
of terrorism ... and formally to change the PLO's Charter, which
still calls for the dissolution of the state of Israel.''
   Sen. Richard Lugar, R-Ind., a member of the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee, said in a statement that the opening offered by
Arafat's statements ``may be a blind alley, but an alley worth
treading with eyes open. This dialogue in no way mitigates our
steadfast support of Israel. But I hope Israel will at least be
willing to informally acknowledge this process as a worthy attempt.''
   The Simon Wiesenthal Center said that by its decision, the United
States is taking ``a major risk for peace.'' The center warned in a
statement that the road Reagan and Shultz ``have chosen to embark
upon is fraught with danger and may be sending the wrong message to
the world: that terrorism does pay.''
   Shultz said the United States would not attempt to steer Israel
to make a similar decision. ``It's totally for Israel to make its
own decisions,'' Shultz said.
   He said the United States ``does not recognize the declaration of
an independent Palestinian state,'' but that it would be a subject
of discussion. He said the channel for the United States would be
the American ambassador to Tunisia, Robert H. Pelletreau Jr.
   Shultz said he believes there should be direct negotiations
between ``the parties'' in the Middle East, but that he knew of
nothing to suggest this was imminent.
   Reagan, in a written statement, said the PLO had accepted U.N.
Security Council Resolutions 242 and 338, recognizing Israel's right
to exist, and had renounced terrorism.
   ``These have long been our conditions for a substantive dialogue.
They have been met. Therefore, I have authorized the State
Department to enter into a substantive dialogue with PLO
representatives,'' Reagan said.
   The announcement represented a turnaround from the U.S. position
24 hours earlier when it said Arafat had not made a clear acceptance
of U.S. conditions for talking to the PLO.
   ``Now that we see a change in the posture of the PLO all we're
doing is following through,'' Shultz told a hastily assembled news
conference that was carried live in the United States on the evening
newscasts.
   He spoke cautiously, picking each word with care and was quick to
reaffirm the American commitment to Israel and to stress that the
action does not recognized the PLO as an independent state.
   He said the United States' position had changed because Arafat
had declared explicitly that he recognized the right of Israel to
exist. He said the U.S. conditions had been well known since 1975
when the United States last held serious talks with the PLO.
   Arafat, at his Geneva news conference, insisted his past
statements mean he recognizes Israel's right to live in peace and
security. He spoke as President-elect George Bush was insisting on a
clear, unequivocal statement to clear the way for discussions.
   Bush's office said later that Bush would have no statement on
Reagan's decision.
   Shultz said he had discussed the decision with representatives of
Israel and he added, ``Our commitment to the security of Israel
remains unflinching.''
   Shultz, asked if Bush was aware of Reagan's decision, said, ``The
president and the vice president both have followed these
developments closely and they have reviewed, each of them, this most
recent development, and they both agree that under these
circumstances the conditions for a substantive dialogue that we have
had in place since 1975 have been met and so we should state that we
are ready to undertake that dialogue.''
   Bush and Arafat spoke almost simultaneously and it was not clear
whether he was aware of the PLO chairman's statements during the
news conference.
   At his news conference, Bush vowed to maintain a tough stand on
the PLO and insisted that Arafat make a definitive statement about
Israel's right to exist and a clear renunciation of terrorism.
   That means that the Palestine National Council, the legislative
arm of the PLO, must subscribe to the statement as well as Arafat,
he said.
   Bush also called on Israel to relinquish territory captured from
Jordan and Egypt in the 1967 Six-Day war. But while saying that
Israel ought to be ``pulling back'' in compliance with two U.N.
Security Council resolutions, the president-elect placed much
greater emphasis on the PLO.
   Bush cited the resolution's assurance that all states _ by
implication Israel as well as the Arabs _ have a right to live
within secure boundaries.
   ``If Mr. Arafat takes a step that brings us a little closer to
that, fine, we're glad that happens,'' Bush said. But, he went on,
``Before we have a dialogue with the PLO the signals have to be
clear, unmistakable, unambiguous ....''

   Yasser Arafat and the PLO launched a political offensive in the
last month to convince Washington and the world they are peaceful,
moderate, and worthy of representing Palestinians in the Middle East
peace process.
   That campaign, punctuated by three major statements, ended
Wednesday with the United States agreeing to talk to the Palestine
Liberation Organization.
   The first major move in the PLO campaign came Nov. 15 in Algiers,
Algeria, when the PLO's parliament-in-exile proclaimed a Palestinian
state. The Palestine National Council said the state would be
established on territory now occupied by Israel.
   At the same time, the council issued a political declaration
accepting U.N. Security Council Resolution 242, which calls for
secure borders for all the states in the region. That statement
amounted to implicit recognition of Israel.
   The declaration also rejected terrorism, restricting PLO
guerrilla action to military targets in the Israeli-occupied
territories.
   On Dec. 6, Arafat took the PLO drive a step further when he
elaborated on the Palestine National Council's action in his own
meeting with a group of U.S. Jews in Stockholm, Sweden.
   He told the Jews that his organization accepts Israel's right to
exist and condemns all forms of terrorism, including ``state
terrorism.'' The PLO uses that term to refer to Israeli military
action in the occupied territories.
   Finally, on Tuesday in Geneva before the U.N. General Assembly,
Arafat made a direct appeal to Israeli leaders to join peace talks.
   He offered a three-point peace plan calling for an international
peace conference, U.N. supervision of Israeli-occupied territory and
a ``comprehensive settlement'' involving all states in the region.
   Speaking to reporters Wednesday in Geneva, Arafat said again that
he renounces all terrorism and recognizes Israel's right to live in
peace and security.
   He also made a direct appeal for the U.S. to reverse its policy
of refusing to talk to the PLO. ``I do expect and hope that the
United States will drop its veto,'' he said.

<HEAD>Defense Attorneys: Officers Acted Recklessly While Chasing Soul
Legend</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: LEADS with 9grafs to UPDATE with Brown's testimony; picks up
7th graf, `North Augusta...'.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By MARY BROOKS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>AIKEN, S.C. (AP) </DATELINE>

   Soul legend James Brown testified Wednesday
that he didn't stop for law enforcement officers during a high-speed
chase because he feared for his life.
   ``I was scared to death,'' he said. ``I went to Vietnam and I
wasn't that frightened.''
   His attorneys also tried to show that authorities acted
recklessly during the pursuit.
   Brown, 55, was on trial for two counts of assault with intent to
kill and one count of failure to stop a motor vehicle when signaled
by a law enforcement officer. If convicted of all charges, he could
be sentenced to as much as 30 years in prison.
   He was arrested Sept. 24 after a chase through Augusta, Ga., and
North Augusta, which is across the state line in South Carolina. He
entered an innocent plea Monday, just before the trial began.
   Brown, known as ``the Godfather of Soul,'' allegedly tried to run
over two North Augusta police officers and failed to stop for a blue
light and siren.
   He testified that he didn't remember driving more than 80 mph and
didn't remember police initially trying to pull him over. But he
said he later became aware of officers pursuing him. When he did
stop, he said the officers scared him by shooting at his truck and
banging on the windows.
   The singer, wearing a gray suit and blue satin shirt, sat quietly
throughout most of the preceding testimony. His wife, 33-year-old
Adrienne Brown, sat across the aisle from her husband.
   North Augusta police officer Ronnie Delaughter testified that the
pursuit involved between 10 to 14 vehicles and reached speeds
between 60 mph and 85 mph.
   Brown, he said, refused to stop for authorities during the chase,
and on several occasions when he did appear to stop, he sped away
from officers.
   Police Lt. William Luckey testified that he nearly collided with
Brown ``when he swerved into my path.'' Brown led them in their
chase into lanes for oncoming traffic and onto the sidewalk, he said.
   ``It was pretty obvious that the truck wasn't going to stop, that
it wasn't going to pay any attention to anything in its way,''
Luckey said.
   Bill Weeks, Brown's attorney, asked Delaughter whether he was
aware of pedestrians, other cars and law enforcement vehicles during
the chase.
   ``I was more concerned with Mr. Brown and his shotgun than (with)
the other officers around me,'' Delaughter said. ``I was advised by
my lieutenant that he had a shotgun.''
   Delaughter also testified that several officers shot at the tires
on Brown's red and white pickup truck.
   In response to a question by Weeks, Delaughter said he was aware
of the other officers' positions when he fired at the tires.

   The Palestine Liberation Organization is
the umbrella for at least eight Palestinian guerrilla groups.
   It is governed by an executive committee made up of the factional
leaders and other independent Palestinians. Policy decisions are put
before the 450-member Palestine National Council for approval.
   Yasser Arafat, leader of the largest guerrilla group, Fatah, has
been PLO chairman since 1969. He has said in interviews that he
cannot control all the factions.
   Asked once whether he was fully in control of all Palestinians
under arms, he replied, ``No government can declare that they
control all their people.''
   The PLO groups include:
   _ Fatah: Founded by Arafat in 1959. Its leaders include a number
of his friends from college years. It is politically moderate and
has been based in Baghdad in recent years.
   _ The Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine. Formed in
1967 by Dr. George Habash, it follows a Marxist-Leninist ideology.
Headquartered in Damascus, Syria.
   _ Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine. The leader,
Nayef Hawatmeh, set up the group after he split with Habash's
Popular Front in 1969. Close to Moscow and based in Damascus.
   These three make up more than 80 percent of the PLO's strength.
The other groups are:
   _ Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine--General Command.
Led by former Syrian army Capt. Ahmed Jibril, it split with Habash's
group to form a more radical group with Syrian and Libyan backing.
It operates out of Damascus.
   _ Palestine Liberation Front. It split from Jibril's group in
1977. One leader is Mohammed Abbas, also known as Abul Abbas,
sentenced by an Italian court to life in prison for his role in
plotting the 1985 hijacking of the Achille Lauro cruise ship during
which an American passenger was shot to death.
   _ Arab Liberation Front. It was formed in 1969 by Abdel Rahim
Ahmed and is controlled by Iraq. Headquartered in Baghdad.
   _ Saiqa. This Syrian-controlled faction was formed in 1967.
   _ Popular Struggle Front. It is a small, radical group
established in 1967 by Samir Goshen, a lawyer, and is headquartered
in Damascus.
   Another group affiliated with the PLO is the Palestinian
Communist Party. It is backed by the Soviets and supports Arafat.
   Groups ostracized by the PLO include Fatah-Revolutionary Council,
a splinter terrorist group led by Abu Nidal, whose real name is
Sabry Al-Banna. He split with Arafat in 1972 and formed the group in
1976.
   Fatah-Uprising is led by Col. Saeed Mousa, or Abu Mousa. He
headed the Syrian-supported groups that rebelled against Arafat in
1983. He is based in Damascus.
   Atallah Atallah leads the small Fatah-Corrective Movement out of
Amman, Jordan. The former Arafat security officer seeks to oust
Arafat as PLO chairman.

   Barry Minkow, who once convinced Wall Street
and talk show hosts that he was a teen-age business genius, was
convicted Wednesday on all counts in the ZZZZ Best carpet-cleaning
securities fraud case.
   The 22-year-old Minkow, who was just 16 when he started his
business, was convicted on 57 federal counts of swindling investors
in a phony restoration business. He had contended he was the
terrified puppet of mobsters, but the jury believed prosecutors who
said he was a canny youthful con man.
   Minkow was calm as the word ``guilty'' was pronounced in the
courtroom 57 times. Once during the 40-minute reading of the
verdict, he reached over and clutched the hand of his attorney,
David Kenner.
   The panelists came to their decision shortly after they concluded
hearing a reading of the testimony of Minkow's co-defendant, Norman
Rothberg, an accountant who was charged with taking a bribe to cover
up the ZZZZ Best frauds.
   The jurors, who have been deliberating for five days, said they
had not yet reached a verdict on charges against Minkow's
co-defendant, accountant Norman Rothberg. After telling the judge
they were too emotionally drained to continue discussions Wednesday,
they recessed for the day and were to resume deliberations on
Rothberg on Thursday.
   The Minkow case was among the most bizarre developments to rock
the volatile money markets in recent years. The ZZZZ Best carpet
cleaning company had been one of the hottest items on Wall Street
before scandal erupted and the business collapsed.
   Large banks and brokerages lost millions along with small
investors, and it became clear that Minkow, once hailed as a
business ``whiz kid,'' was not the boy wonder he seemed.
   True, he was only 16 when he started a carpet cleaning business
in his parents' garage in the San Fernando Valley. But he admitted
during the four-month trial that his claim that ZZZZ Best made a
fortune on restoring fire and water damaged buildings was a lie.
   ``He sold investors on a business that for the most part did not
exist,'' Assistant U.S. Attorney James Asperger told jurors in
opening statements.
   He said Minkow's manipulations cost investors more than $25
million while the young entrepreneur lived in a $1 million house and
drove a red Ferrari.
   Sentencing for Minkow was set for Feb. 21, and Kenner said he
hoped U.S. District Judge Dickran Tevrizian would be lenient.
Theoretically, Minkow could draw up to 300 years in prison.
   ``Barry is a young man,'' Kenner said. ``He never said he didn't
do anything wrong. ... I would hope Barry will still be a young man
when he is released.''
   Kenner also confirmed that defense and prosecution lawyers had
been nearing a possible plea bargain agreement at the time the
jurors announced they had reached a verdict.
   The prosecutors would say only that they were pleased with the
verdict but would comment no further until Rothberg's section of the
case was resolved.
   Minkow, who had captivated the press and public with the story of
his youthful success, openly admitted that he had defrauded
investors out of millions. But he insisted it wasn't his fault.
   ``I was just a front man for the mob,'' he told jurors as part of
his risky defense of duress. He claimed that Mafia figures, stock
manipulators and thugs infiltrated his business, threatened him with
death and orchestrated the huge ZZZZ Best fraud.
   He named the late reputed mobster Jack Catain as a key figure in
his intimidation and said others, including a loan shark named Dan
Krowpman, used death threats to win his cooperation.
   ``I didn't resist anymore,'' he said. ``I was just a puppet. ...
I was out of objecting strength. It was over. I just did as I was
told.''
   But the prosecution portrayed Minkow as a shrewd con man who
defrauded others to satisfy his thirst for fame and fortune.
   ``Power, prestige and money are the three things most important
to Barry Minkow,'' said Assistant U.S. Attorney Gordon Greenberg.
   He called Minkow ``a pathological liar'' and said, ``This defense
of duress just doesn't fly.''
   Ten of Minkow's former associates, including Krowpman, have
pleaded guilty to various charges stemming from the ZZZZ Best frauds.

   A large creche the state erected in front
of the Capitol can remain despite objections that it amounts to
state sponsorship of religion, a federal judge ruled Wednesday.
   But the state was ordered to meet several conditions by Monday or
remove the barn-like structure with its manger and animal pens. U.S.
District Judge William O. Bertelsman said the state must come up
with private funding and post a large disclaimer stating that it is
not endorsing any religion.
   The American Civil Liberties Union had sought to force the state
to remove the creche, which is without figurines of the infant Jesus
and other humans. Its request for an injunction was turned down.
   Suzy Post, director of the Kentucky ACLU, said from her
Louisville office that she had not read the opinion.
   ``What we would have liked, obviously, is for the thing to be
taken down right now. ... On the other hand, what the judge has done
is acknowledge that there has to be a separation between church and
state,'' she said.
   The ACLU won't decide until next week whether to appeal the
ruling.
   Bertelsman's first condition was that ``all past and future
expenditures of public funds ... be defrayed by private
contributions.''
   The landscaped creche cost the state about $2,400, including
materials and the salaries of the state workers who put it up, court
papers showed.
   Kevin Hable, a lawyer for Gov. Wallace Wilkinson, said he
believed the state already had been offered enough money to recover
what had been spent on the creche to date and to pay for its
continued maintenance.
   Bertelsman's second condition was that the state erect a
prominent disclaimer, readable by anyone passing in a car.
   He dictated this wording: ``This display was not constructed with
public funds and does not constitute an endorsement by the
commonwealth of any religion or religious doctrine.''
   He also ordered the state to post a public notice that the area
around the creche is a ``public forum ... available to all
responsible citizens and civic and religious groups for holiday
ceremonies, pageants or displays.''
   Finally, Bertelsman said the state must adopt a policy on the
creche's use.
   Pat Abell, another of Wilkinson's lawyers, said he believed
Bertelsman's conditions were ``just and equitable'' and that he
would recommend the state accept them.
   Attorneys for Wilkinson contended the creche was only part of a
general Christmas display, a reminder of the holiday's religious
significance and, therefore, constitutional.
   The 30-foot state Christmas tree was about 100 yards behind the
creche.
   Elsewhere on the Capitol grounds, trees and lampposts have been
decorated with lights, ribbons and holly. And the state's large
floral clock behind the Capitol was decorated as a huge snowflake.
   But the ACLU said the creche was ``the dominant structure,'' the
first thing a visitor would see and had ``the primary effect of
sponsoring ... religion.''
   The judge disagreed, saying that the stable structure could be
interpreted ``not as an endorsement of religion or any religious
doctrine, but merely as a reminder of the religious origins of
Christmas,'' Bertelsman said.
   The creche, although without traditional human figurines for
legal reasons, was staffed on some nights by members of area
churches as a living nativity scene.

<HEAD>Congressional Panel Urges Increased Role for Schools</HEAD>

   Schools should be open longer and allow their
buildings to be used for community purposes such as alcohol and drug
counseling, a congressional panel recommended Wednesday.
   All American students should have access to early childhood
education, according to a report by the subcommittee on education
and health of the Joint Economic Committee.
   In addition, subcommittee Chairman James Scheuer, D-N.Y., said
more students should have a chance to go to college so they can
prepare to compete in today's complex work environment.
   ``It seems obvious that kindergarten through grade 12 education,
which was adequate for the work force of a predominantly
agricultural nation adapting to industrialization, is simply
obsolete in today's complex and sophisticated high-tech
environment,'' Scheuer said.
   ``It is clear to me that we must assure a higher education
opportunity for all eligible students just as we did for returning
soldiers after World War II,'' he said.
   The subcommittee's report, based on nine days of hearings,
proposed a longer school year and said schools should be kept open
nights, weekends, holidays and summers.
   Schools should be viewed as ``capital investments in the
communities'' and used for many civic needs such as drug and alcohol
counseling, adult literacy programs and job counseling, the
subcommittee recommended.
   Children should be taught ``higher order skills,'' Scheuer said,
``not only reading, writing and math but teaching children how to
think and how to learn.''
   Schools also should update vocational education programs and
increase the availability and quality of on-the-job training, the
subcommittee said.

<HEAD>U.S. Team Flies To Retrieve Largest MIA Remains Turnover</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER ENG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A U.S. military team flew to Vietnam
Thursday to receive 38 sets of remains believed to be those of
missing Americans in the largest such turnover since the Vietnam War
ended.
   During the repatriation ceremony scheduled Thursday at Hanoi's
Noi Bai Airport, the Vietnamese also were to turn over information
on 12 other cases of Americans listed as missing in action, or MIAs,
said Lt. Col. Thomas J. Boyd, a spokesman for the U.S. Pacific
Command.
   At the ceremony, a U.S. military honor guard will solemnly load
the remains, each in metal caskets topped with a folded American
flag, onto a U.S. Air Force plane for the flight to Guam and then
Honolulu. In Honolulu, the Army Central Identification Laboratory
will analyze the remains to determine if they belong to any of the
1,747 MIAs still listed from the Vietnam war.
   Vietnamese officials usually do preliminary analyses, but the
army laboratory sometimes finds among the remains those of
Vietnamese individuals.
   ``The U.S. government appreciates the initiative taken by Vietnam
to repatriate these remains and hopes to continue the increasing
cooperation to resolve this long-standing issue,'' Lt. Col. Keith
Schneider, a Pentagon spokesman, said in Washington on Wednesday.
   The Pentagon said it had not received any information from
Vietnam on precisely where the latest remains to be exchanged had
been recovered or the circumstances surrounding their discovery.
   Schneider added, however, that ``we understand the remains as
well as the information are related to incidents that occurred
(during the war) in the northern provinces.''
   Most missing Americans in the north were airmen shot down on
bombing or reconnaissance missions.
   All told, the remains of 172 Americans have been repatriated to
the United States from Vietnam and subsequently identified by the
Army laboratory since the end of the war.
   The previous largest turnover of remains believed to be those of
MIAs involved 27 sets handed over April 6. The most recent turnover
involved 23 sets repatriated Nov. 3.
   Thursday's repatriation will be the seventh since retired Gen.
John W. Vessey, acting as a special U.S. presidential envoy, reached
agreement with Vietnam's Foreign Minister Nguyen Co Thach to end
months of deadlock on the MIA issue. In all, 138 sets of remains
have been returned since the August 1987 agreement in Hanoi.
   The first American combat troops in Vietnam landed in Danang,
then in South Vietnam, in March 1965. The Paris Peace Accords in
January 1973 halted U.S. fighting in the conflict, which killed
about 58,000 Americans and ended in the communist victory over the
U.S.-backed South Vietnamese government in April 1975.
   Bitter political bickering between Hanoi and Washington has often
blocked accounting for the U.S. missing since then. The U.S.
government says it will not consider normalizing relations with
Vietnam until Hanoi withdraws all its troops from Cambodia and
resolves the MIA issue.
   Currently, 2,383 Americans are listed as MIA as a result of the
war: 1,747 are missing in Vietnam, 547 in Laos, 83 in Cambodia, and
six in China.
   In Laos, U.S. and Laotian officials were continuing Thursday a
joint excavation in southern Savannakhet province to try to
determine the fate of a pilot shot down in 1968. The excavation, to
be completed in a few days, is the fourth such joint project in Laos.

<HEAD>`1000 Airplanes' Opens in New York</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARY CAMPBELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   ``1000 Airplanes on the Roof'' begins with a
sound that gets louder, until a listener thinks a jet is about to
land in his or her vibrating stomach.
   It's the sound that M hears just before he gets a headache, then
goes into an out-of-body experience.
   Philip Glass, the minimalist or post-minimalist composer who is
America's most successful opera composer, wrote the music for ``1000
Airplanes.'' It's an opera for an actor who doesn't sing but speaks
in coordination with the rhythm of music by the eight-member Philip
Glass Ensemble, seated on the stage.
   The actor, Patrick O'Connell, is riveting in his 90-minute acted
monologue by playwright David Henry Hwang, whose ``M. Butterfly'' is
on Broadway. O'Connell walks around in the set, slide projections in
air from nine projectors, designed by Jerome Sirlin.
   The opera had its premiere in August in Hangar 3 at Vienna's
airport. It opened for eight performances here Wednesday night at
the Beacon Theater, usually a rock venue. A 38-city American tour
began Sept. 22 and will run through Feb. 28.
   As M begins his story, one wonders whether he is crazy, dreaming,
on LSD, getting shock treatments or the protagonist of a science
fiction story. Once, on a farm, he says, the heavens opened, the
sound came and alien beings took him away with them. Another time,
he grabbed a beehive, thinking from bee-sting pain he'd learn the
meaning of life.
   Now, in New York, taking a walk with a girl, his apartment house
disappears. He runs, steps outside time, looks into his own mind,
travels in a spaceship, sees the face of an alien and understands
why people seek soulmates. Coming to, he remembers being told to
deny his way-out and inner realizations or he'll be an outcast. He
regretfully does that, then really forgets, but fears that a
headache will start something again.
   Glass's music is enormously popular these days and one assumes it
is a larger attraction even than the story, symbolism and
holographic scenery.
   Small bursts of melody repeat for a brief time, often the
opposite of Indian music which has a drone underneath. Here, the
drone may be a soprano saxophone; the stabs of rhythm and melody
come in lower tones.
   There are many different, interesting melodies in ``1000
Airplanes.'' One doesn't feel, as was the case sometimes in the
past, that the entire opera is repeating one melody with slight
variations.
   Since imitation Puccini and jagged, unsingable intervals aren't
working in modern opera, maybe Glass has the answer.

<HEAD>Self-Described Skinhead Convicted of Attempted Murder</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SPOKANE, Wash. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A jury Wednesday convicted a self-described
neo-Nazi skinhead of attempted second-degree murder and malicious
harassment for a knife attack on a black man last summer.
   Billy Wayne Worl, 24, a transient from Bartlesville, Okla., had
been charged with attempted first-degree murder but was convicted of
the lesser charge for attacking Raymond Hill, 29, in a supermarket
parking lot July 30.
   The case was believed to be the first time a person has been
prosecuted in Washington state on a charge of malicious harassment,
which is defined as causing physical injury with the intent to
harass or intimidate someone because of race, color or ancestry.
   After a week of testimony, the Superior Court jury deliberated
about four hours before returning its verdict.
   Worl had come to the Spokane area a week before the attack
because, he said, he was attracted by the Aryan Nations white
supremacist church based in nearby Hayden Lake, Idaho.
   The prosecution had argued that Worl's attack was unprovoked and
motivated by racial hatred. Hill testified that Worl approached him
while he was sitting in his car, and that Worl stabbed and slashed
him with a knife.
   Worl was the only witness in his own defense. He testified
Tuesday that he approached Hill to panhandle for money, then rushed
Hill and slashed at him with a knife in self-defense because he
thought Hill had a gun.
   Defense attorney Maryann Moreno attempted to counter the claim of
racism in her closing arguments, telling jurors that Worl's beliefs
were not on trial.
   ``Skinheads aren't on trial,'' she said. ``White supremacy isn't
on trial. The Aryan Nations isn't on trial. Racism is not on trial.''
   The skinhead subculture and style of dress emerged in London in
the 1960s. Segments of the movement later took on Nazi overtones and
since have been associated with the white supremacist groups.
   No sentencing date was set. A juvenile co-defendant charged with
attempted murder and malicious harassment is scheduled to stand
trial next month in Juvenile Court.

   President-elect Bush, recruiting again from the
Reagan administration, named Clayton Yeutter as secretary of
agriculture Wednesday. He also said ``it would surprise me'' if an
FBI check had turned up anything to preclude John Tower from being
defense secretary.
   Bush said he was confident Tower could do an excellent job ``if I
decide to go that route.'' The former Texas senator met with Bush's
counsel, C. Boyden Gray, to review material developed by the FBI
during an extensive background check, and Bush officials said the
investigation was at an end.
   While Bush has promised to bring in a new team of players when
his administration takes office Jan. 20, Yeutter is the fifth
holdover from the Reagan administration, where he served three years
in the Cabinet-level post of U.S. trade representative.
   Yeutter's selection delighted farm-state lawmakers and others.
``Clayton is a pro,'' said Sen. Max Baucus, D-Mont. ``His experience
and knowledge on trade issues will be a big plus.'' American Farm
Bureau Federation spokesman John Lewis said Yeutter was an
outstanding choice who ``understands agriculture and its problems.''
   Bush, in a news conference, also said he expected to name a black
to his cabinet. Louis Sullivan, president of Morehouse College
School of Medicine in Atlanta, who is black, has been touted as a
leading candidate to head the Department of Health and Human
Services.
   The Washington Post reported in Thursday's editions that another
black, Julius W. Becton Jr., a retired three-star Army general who
now heads the Federal Emergency Management Agency, is the leading
candidate to head the Department of Veterans Affairs. The Post also
quoted sources as saying that Federal Trade Commissioner Patricia
Diaz Dennis, who is Hispanic, is a candidate to head the Labor
Department.
   Bush press secretary Sheila Tate said she had no information on
the possible appointments.
   Bush's freewheeling news conference focused heavily on foreign
policy issues. Fielding questions, he appeared relaxed and confident.
   He hinted his administration would seek a delay in February's
resumption of arms control talks with the Soviet Union. ``There is
no way that we are going to have by Feb. 15 or 16 a detailed
point-by-point program on arms talks,'' Bush said. ``We're not going
to have it.''
   ``We are going to start working vigorously and I will send
whatever signal it takes'' to convey that message, Bush said. ``I am
interested in progress but I want it to be prudent. I want whatever
steps we take to be lasting.''
   Bush said his advisers still have not completed assessing Soviet
President Mikhail Gorbachev's announcement of a 500,000 cutback in
Soviet forces, a reduction of about 10 percent in Red Army troop
strength.
   On another matter, Bush said there was ``some movement forward''
toward moderation in Palestine Liberation Organization leader Yasser
Arafat's speech this week, but ``not enough'' to warrant direct
dealings with the PLO by the United States.
   Bush said he wants ``clear, unmistakeable, unambiguous''
declarations that the PLO renounces terrorism, recognizes Israel and
will work within key United Nations resolutions.
   On other issues, Bush:
   _Said Vice President-elect Dan Quayle's role would be ``very much
like the Reagan-Bush relationship.'' He said Quayle would be a ``key
player'' in national security affairs if he wants to be and that
there may be specific assignments in other areas.
   _Said he has not considered how to pay for cleaning up U.S.
nuclear weapons production plants. Likewise, Bush said had not yet
addressed the problem of the homeless in America, which he called
``a national shame.''
   _Avoided commenting on whether there were ethical lapses among
members of Congress, but said he would send ethics legislation to
Capitol Hill ``very, very early'' in his administration.
   _Said he would not seek substantial cuts in existing farm
programs but didn't say what he meant by substantial. ``I do not
believe we will balance the budget eventually on the backs of
farmers.''
   Bush spent part of his day meeting with labor leaders and also
with women from inside and outside government. He said he was
``determined to have an administration that's broadly
representative'' of all groups.
   ``That clearly means that there will be active women in high
levels of the administration,'' Bush said.
   He also conferred with Lowell Weicker Jr., a Republican who lost
his bid for a fourth Senate term from Connecticut. Weicker was a
leading advocate on Capitol Hill for the National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration, and environmentalists and others are
promoting him as a possible head of the agency.
   Yeutter is Bush's sixth Cabinet nominee, joining Reagan
administration veterans James A. Baker III, former treasury
secretary, named secretary of state; Nicholas Brady, picked to stay
as treasury secretary; Dick Thornburgh, to stay as attorney general,
and Lauro Cavazos, who will stay as education secretary. The new
commerce secretary, longtime Bush friend Robert Mosbacher, is new to
the Cabinet.
   Officials say Bush hopes to round out his Cabinet by Christmas.
By many accounts, announcement could come soon on Samuel Skinner,
head of the Chicago-area Regional Transportation Authority, to be
transportation secretary.
   Yeutter, 58, a former Nebraska farmer, was chief executive
officer of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, and served in the
Agriculture Department and as deputy trade representative in the
administration of President Ford.
   Tower has been considered a top prospect for defense secretary
for years, but his expected appointment by Bush has been delayed by
an extensive FBI investigation of his dealings with defense
contractors and aspects of his personal life.
   Disagreeing with concerns raised in Congress, transition
co-chairman Craig Fuller said Tower would be strengthened by the
long background check because no stone has been left unturned.
   Several members of Congress have said the uncertainty and delay
has weakened Tower politically. After going through a difficult
divorce, Tower has been questioned about allegations raised by his
former wife, as well as his ties with defense contractors, sources
say.

   Medical experts say it is already too late to help
the countless thousands who remain trapped under rubble one week
after the Armenian earthquake and that relief efforts should now
focus on the hurt and homeless.
   Relief workers with blankets, warm clothes and tents have yet to
reach many of the survivors.
   ``We now consider the search and rescue phase as being over
because there is very little hope of finding anyone alive,'' said
Robert Gale, the U.S. bone marrow specialist who helped care for
victims of the 1986 Chernobyl nuclear disaster in the Soviet Ukraine.
   Prime Minister Nikolai Ryzhkov has pledged to keep searching for
survivors as long as it was possible. ``One of our most urgent tasks
is to rescue those people who are alive,'' Foreign Ministry

   President-elect Bush wants Trade Representative
Clayton Yeutter to be his agriculture secretary and Samuel Skinner
of Illinois to head the Transportation Department, Bush transition
sources say.
   Yeutter earlier had publicly expressed reticence about taking the
agriculture job, but on Tuesday he told reporters, ``I've learned
never to say never.''
   In a 1986 interview, Yeutter said he always wanted to be
agriculture secretary, but he abandoned that wish when he became
caught up in his role as the nation's No. 1 trade representative.
President Reagan named him to that post in 1985.
   For the Transportation Department job, sources from the Bush
presidential transition team said he has chosen Skinner, head of the
Regional Transportation Authority in the Chicago area.

   Eighteen citizen groups today called on the
Department of Energy to give the public a comprehensive assessment
of environmental safety at the government's trouble-plagued nuclear
weapons production centers.
   The groups, led by the Natural Resources Defense Council,
released a letter to Energy Secretary John S. Herrington urging
preparation of a ``programmatic environmental impact statement'' on
the entire complex, which involves 17 facilities employing some
100,000 people in 12 states.
   ``It is time to take the wraps off what has been in effect the
Department of Energy's `Stealth' program and to compel meaningful
public scrutiny of its plans for the complex,'' said Dan W. Reicher,
an attorney for the council.
   The move came one day after the NRDC and two other groups filed
suit to compel the Energy Department to prepare an environmental
impact statement on its sprawling Savannah River plant in South
Carolina before any of the three weapons reactors there can be
restarted.

   Researchers who hope to study the secrets of
nature at the government's planned $4.4 billion super collider may
first need protection from a venomous ant with a penchant for
munching its way through underground cables.
   A 10,000-page environmental impact statement on the project says
the Texas site chosen by the Energy Department for the research
center is in an area infested with the fire ant.
   The ill-tempered ant inflicts painful bites, is blamed by local
residents for disabling home and farm equipment, and has caused
power failures by chewing through underground cables, the department
reports.
   Plans call for the super collider to be built in a 53-mile tunnel
under what is now farmland in Ellis County, Texas. Subatomic
particles will be accelerated to astronomical speeds inside the
tunnel and studied by scientists hoping to learn more about the
fundamental nature of matter and energy.

   The first five-minute test for AIDS has been

percent accurate and offers the fastest results of any tests for the
deadly disease.
   The test was cleared Tuesday by the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration. Its maker, Worcester-based Cambridge Bioscience,
said it should be on the market in a few weeks.
   ``This technical advance should help make testing available to
all who want to be tested,'' FDA Commissioner Frank E. Young said in
Washington. ``It will also be particularly useful in remote areas of
the world that lack the facilities for earlier approved tests.''
   The results of those earlier tests _ now the mainstay of AIDS
screening _ frequently are not available for weeks.

   A Jewish businessman interested in PTL's
real estate agreed to pay $65 million for the assets of the
scandal-plagued ministry, but refused to say if he would allow its
evangelical operations to continue.
   The head of Heritage Ministries, PTL's religious successor,
however, said the deal means merely a change in landlords and
purchaser Stephen Mernick told him he was ``sensitive'' to the
religious operation.
   Mernick, a nonpracticing Orthodox rabbi from Toronto, bought the
assets Tuesday for $10 million less than the value placed on it by
U.S. Banktruptcy Judge Rufus Reynolds, and only a little more than
half of what he offered a month ago.
   Reynolds approved the cash sale after polling major creditors at
a hearing. Most said it was the best deal they would get for what
once had been a $160 million empire.

   Ed Ames is hoping a guest shot as a sheriff
gone bad on NBC's ``In the Heat of the Night'' will revive his
television career.
   Ames stars in the drama series next Tuesday as Sheriff Thompson,
an old friend of Police Chief Bill Gillespie (Carroll O'Connor), who
undergoes a change for the worse after the death of his wife.
   Ames is best known to television audiences for playing Mingo,
Daniel Boone's Oxford-educated Cherokee Indian companion on ``Daniel
Boone'' 20 years ago. After he left the series in 1968, Ames resumed
his singing career. In recent years he has worked mostly in regional
theater and performed in concerts.
   ``In the Heat of the Night'' stars O'Connor as chief of police in
fictional Sparta, Miss., and Howard Rollins as the chief of
detectives. The series was inspired by the Oscar-winning 1967 movie
of the same name that starred Rod Steiger as a Southern sheriff
forced to accept the help of a black detective, played by Sidney
Poitier, to solve a murder case.
   The series is in its second season.
   Ames plays ``a sheriff whose life kind of collapses,'' he said.
   ``He lets his personal problems influence his professional duties
and he begins to abuse his prisoners. He's Chief Gillespie's oldest
friend, and they end up on opposite sides of the fence.
   ``It starts when a black rookie policeman (from Sparta) arrests
an old friend who's fleeing Thompson's jail. He pleads not to be
sent back. When he is sent back and dies in Thompson's jail, the
black policeman has himself arrested so he can investigate the
charges.''
   The rookie officer, Wilson Sweet, is played by new cast member
Geoffrey Thorne.
   ``Gillespie has a hard time believing all this about his old
friend,'' said Ames. ``But his young policeman gets badly beaten in
my jail. What I like is that none of this violence is shown on
screen.
   ``I liked this script because it deals with police brutality. It
takes another look at ethnic prisoners and the police. It doesn't
make the guy into a monster. He was a man who had helped people, but
when he went bad there was no system in the community to deal with
it.''
   Ames has worked in regional theater in recent years, appearing in
such plays as ``Fiddler on the Roof,'' ``Man of La Mancha'' and
``South Pacific.''
   ``I've also been in `Shenandoah,' a musical adapted from the
movie with James Stewart,'' he said. He played Charlie Anderson, ``a
man who was indifferent to the Civil War until his family became
involved. The play's a metaphor for what's happening in the world
today. He's the little guy on the farm who's caught between the two
sides.''
   Ames did a guest shot on ``Murder, She Wrote'' a few years ago,
but otherwise had rarely appeared on television.
   ``I've decided I want to come back and do television and films
again,'' he said. ``I must confess that after `Daniel Boone' I
wanted to do some theater. I had a hit record come out, and it
started a whole new career for me again as a musical artist.''
   He had been a member of the Ames Brothers, a popular singing
group. He sang with his brothers Gene, Joe and Vic.
   After the group broke up he went to drama school and later played
the schizophrenic Indian in ``One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest'' on
Broadway with Kirk Douglas. The producers of ``Daniel Boone'' saw
him in that and offered me the role of Mingo.
   Ames also picked up two college degrees, including one in
directing from the UCLA Film School.
   ``I'd like to do another TV series,'' he said. ``I'd like to
direct, too.''

<HEAD>`A Very Brady Christmas' Indeed</HEAD>

   What do you do when you tell your friends you
can't have dinner with them because you have to watch ``A Very Brady
Christmas,'' and they are thrilled and come over with takeout blinis
to watch it with you?
   You sit down and watch ``A Very Brady Christmas.''
   The holiday movie isn't on until Sunday, but we had a review tape
from CBS. My friends were mightily impressed at getting to see ``A
Very Brady Christmas'' before anybody else in America.
   ``Yep, it's the same living room,'' one friend remarked as the
show began. She recalled the earth tones of the original Brady house
and exactly where the furniture was. ``Same kitchen,'' another
friend noted. ``The faucet's different. It's a washerless faucet.''
   I'm glad they noticed all this. I was never big on ``The Brady
Bunch'' myself. I preferred ``The Partridge Family.''
   My friends were just as quick to detect changes in the show's
25-year-old sensibility as they were to spot new upholstery on the
dining room chairs.
   ``There's definitely more sex in this one,'' said one. ``They
never had sex in the old one. Just kids.''
   Interesting observation. Might make a trend story.
   As the movie opened, we immediately learned that Christmas was
coming, and Carol Brady (Florence Henderson) was planning to
surprise Mike Brady (Robert Reed) with a trip to Greece. But Mike
was going to surprise Carol with a trip to Japan. What a
knee-slapper! This had all the makings of an extremely Brady
Christmas, indeed.
   What do the Bradys do? Flip a coin? Arm-wrestle? No way. They use
the money to send plane tickets to all the kids so Christmas can be
even Bradier.
   There are also subplots. One is a ``Towering Inferno'' kind of
thing. In another, Alice the maid (Ann B. Davis) is distraught
because her husband, Sam the butcher, has left her for a younger
woman.
   But we didn't especially care, because our real goal in watching
``A Very Brady Christmas'' was at hand: what do the kids look like
as adults?
   Greg, the oldest boy, is a doctor. He has a moustache and is
balding.
   Peter, the middle one, has turned into a yuppie.
   Bobby, the youngest one, is blond and races cars.
   ``I remember when he and his sister tried to break the world's
record by going up and down on that thing in the backyard,'' said
one of my friends, awash in sentiment. ``What's that thing that goes
up and down?''
   A teeter-totter?
   ``Yeah, the teeter-totter.''
   Yeesh. These reunion movies really raise the conversation level.
   Anyway, on to the girls.
   Marcia, the oldest one, looks pretty much the same.
   Jan, the middle one, looks pretty much the same.
   Cindy, the little one, looks remarkably the same considering
she's played by a different actress.
   Well, it turns out that every one of The Brady Bunch had A Very
Secret Reason for not wanting to come to A Very Brady Christmas.
   Greg's wife had gone off to see her family instead. Jan's husband
had moved out of the house. Marcia's husband has lost his job. Cindy
was tired of being treated like a baby. Peter didn't want the family
to know he was afraid of marrying his girlfriend because she's his
boss. Bobby had dropped out of graduate school.
   Detecting a philosophical facet of the script lost on me, one of
my friends noted, ``This is definitely what Christmas reunions are
about _ deception.''
   OK, we were Bradied out. We had seen the kids, and we had figured
out all the subplots. All that was left was for Sam the butcher to
show up.
   ``I can see it a mile away,'' snorted one of my friends.
``They'll all decide it's best to be honest.''
   In the end, they all decided it was best to be honest. And Sam
the Butcher showed up.

<HEAD>Greed, or Enhancement of Shareholder Values</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Just one year ago there existed a widely held
view that the feverish pace of mergers, acquisitions and leveraged
buyouts would begin fading like so many other fierce fads of
business.
   That assumption was no better than some of the economic forecasts
made at the time, which you will recall was just weeks after the
great stock market shock of 1987, which some people thought was a
forerunner of recession.
   Recession didn't come, and neither did an end to the pace of
takeovers. The latter defied the stock market shock, economic
uncertainty, ``poison pill'' takeover defenses and more. In fact,
the pace actually quickened.
   The New Year had scarecely begun, for example, when a $4 billion
takeover bid for Sterling Drug opened the flood gates for what now
appears to be a record year for mergers and acquisitions.
   Figures compiled by Wright Investors' Service, a Bridgeport,
Conn.-based international investment firm, show that transactions in
the first nine months amounted to $198 billion, or 35 percent ahead
of the 1987 pace.
   With an estimated $72 billion worth of deals announced early in
the fourth quarter, this year's activity should easily exceed the
record $204 billion reached in 1986.
   So, will the pace decline in 1989? Wright thinks so.
   Because of its sheer size, says Wright, the recent $24.53 billion
RJR Nabisco Inc. leveraged buyout deal received intense scrutiny,
``the end result of which was overwhelmingly negative public
opinion.''
   Despite management assertions about increasing productivity and
enhancing shareholder value, it asserts that ``RJR has heightened
the nearly universal perception that greed _ and not competitiveness
_ is the prime motivation behind most leveraged buyouts.''
   Greed is a sin, to be sure, but it is not officially a crime.
Criminal fads run up against the law and meet their demise. But
nowhere in the past is there substantial evidence that mere sinful
fads scored the conscience of the greedy.
   The reason must lie elsewhere.
   Wright agrees that while the Federal Reserve Board and Congress
are increasingly concerned about takeover activities, debt
financing, the reduction in equities and lost taxes, they are a long
way from taking effective action.
   That is, it might take those two bodies more than the time
alloted to the year 1989 to produce restraints on takeovers.
   What, then, will slow the pace?
   Wright thinks the answer might lie in the realities of the
marketplace. ``The economics of takeovers are not what they were
five years ago when the Dow Jones Industrial Average was 900 points
lower,'' it states.
   When combined with higher interest rates and other unfavorable
economic factors, Wright believes this relative lack of value argues
for a slowdown of takeover activity in 1989.
   It adds one more reason for such thinking, suggesting that while
the greed of managers hasn't necessarily lessened, their
self-interest might have become intensified by activities in 1988.
   Specifically, ``with the spectacular failure of management's bid
in the RJR Nabisco takeover, corporate managers may now think twice
before putting their companies into play,'' it states.

<HEAD>Many Are Homeless This Christmas As Was First Christmas Couple</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   At a Manhattan church this Sunday, that
commemorated Christmas pair, Mary and Joseph, will be portrayed in a
modern mode _ a homeless couple hunting for shelter.
   This has become the plight of hundreds of thousands of people
across America today, just as it was the plight of Mary and Joseph
2,000 years ago in Bethlehem.
   ``They also were homeless,'' says the Rev. Thomas F. Pike of
Calvary-St. George's Episcopal Church whose annual candlelight
service is presenting their situation as current rather than past.
   They, like many nowadays, ``had no place to stay,'' adds Pike,
who also heads the board of New York City's interfaith Partnership
for the Homeless. ``That family also was wandering the streets.
   ``They had to deliver the child in a backyard stable, a cave.
Then they faced persecution and had to flee. They had to leave for
another country. They were refugees.''
   In a similar way, he says the growing multitude of homeless
Americans is a ``crisis not just in the lives of individual victims,
but a crisis in the whole identification of this nation.''
   As chairman of an organization described as the nation's largest
private local program providing the homeless with food, shelter and
some permanent housing, Pike added in an interview:
   ``The growing callousness and willingness of people to live
side-by_side with this tragedy affects everyone. What we see is the
erosion of the worth of life, of the dignity of the human person.
   ``We see more and more tolerance of violence, a depreciation of
life. Our nation is really at a crossroads. If we don't resolve the
issue of homelessness, every cherished institution in American life
will be affected by cynicism and doubt.''
   Estimates have placed the number of U.S. homeless at up to 3
million, wandering the streets and byways of cities across the
country, crowding soup lines, hunting temporary shelter by night.
   Pike said President-Elect Bush's expressed hopes for a ``gentler,
quieter'' nation aren't likely ``if he doesn't listen to the cries
in the streets of the homeless.
   ``There's no way American society can be deaf and blind to this
crisis. Most people are hoping Bush provides leadership in dealing
with it.''
   Pike said that while the spreading severity of the problem may
represent the ``dark side'' of the picture, the massive volunteer
response to it represents the ``brighter side.''
   ``An incredible number of institutions are working on this
crisis,'' he said. ``Millions of volunteers of religious,
educational and philanthropic institutions are involved. It's a real
sign of hope.
   ``Literally every community and town on the face of this nation,
through individuals and groups, has mobilized support for hungry and
homeless people. If the President builds on that, we can have hope
that this terrible tragedy will be alleviated.''
   Pike, who estimates New York City's homeless at about 50,000,
said the inter-organizational partnership here has become a ``model
for places all over the country. Hundreds of them have picked it
up.''
   He said the ``the key to it is partnership,'' not only among
religious congregations, Protestant, Roman Catholic and Jewish, but
also with civic, labor and other organizations as well as city and
state agencies.
   ``We present a united response, cooperative and not
confrontational, that maximizes communication in dealing with the
system,'' he said.
   Pike, 51, who twice has been nominated unsuccessfully for
diocesan bishop _in Los Angeles and New York _ said that 400 New
York City churches and synagogues are involved in providing food and
shelter to the homeless.
   The congregations run 130 shelters that house about 2,000 people
per night _totalling 400,000 last winter with more than a million
meals served. About 24,000 volunteers have served in the program
since it began in 1982.
   It started then with only two churches _ Manhattan's St. Joseph's
Roman Catholic Church and Calvary-St. George's Episcopal Church, but
has since spread to a wide inter-religious network.
   Besides the sheltering and feeding program, the partnership also
runs a permanent housing operation, Project Domicile, which has
helped relocate 3,700 homeless people from shelters and welfare
hotels to permanent apartments.
   Pike, also a director of the New York Landmarks Conservancy that
helps fund restoration of historic sites, said a criticial need in
reducing homelessness is reform of the welfare system.
   It ``is not supportive of family life,'' he said. ``It ought to
support and encourage families to stay together and encourage
stability.''
   Under the circumstances, he said, ``Some of the most heroic
people in the country are women raising children.''
   Describing a sick, young woman with an eight-months-old infant
who fell into the subway tracks at Manhattan's Union Square and who
was lifted out just before a train roared in, he said:
   ``That's the New York Madonna.''

<HEAD>King Louis XVI Acquitted in French Retrial</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JEFFREY ULBRICH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A jury of French citizens has acquitted King Louis
XVI of ``conspiring against public liberty and national security,''
thus reversing one of the momentous events of French revolutionary
history. Unfortunately for Louis, it came a bit late.
   In a strange mixture of old and new, of the 18th century and the
modern, the private TF1 television network and Le Figaro Magazine
retried ``Louis Capet,'' using a combination of present-day lawyers
and costumed actors. Then the French people were asked to judge.
   This time around, 196 years after the real Louis went to the
guillotine for treason, the French of 1988 felt a little more
sympathetic to the man who in his time was a symbol of despotism.
This time he also had a hot-shot criminal lawyer.
   The mock trial, shown live for nearly 1{ hours on prime time
television, is part of the run-up to the bicentennial of the French
Revolution next July 14.
   At the end of the television trial, the viewers were given an
hour to cast their votes by telephone for acquittal, exile or death.
The result, announced at the beginning of the evening's last
newscast just before midnight, was 55 percent for acquittal, 27.5
percent for death and 17.5 percent for sending the monarch into
exile. In actuality, Louis was condemned to death by a majority of
one.
   The real Louis XVI, unable to control the revolution or escape
it, first was reduced to a figurehead, then finally put on trial by
the Convention, which later became the National Assembly. He was
convicted and beheaded Jan. 21, 1793. His wife, Marie Antoinette,
was guillotined the following October after her conviction of
treason.
   For the purposes of television, however, the king was retried in
a courtroom by a three-judge panel wearing blue, white and red
revolutionary plumes, costumed prosecutors and other court
personnel. The defense lawyer wore a dark business suit. The
audience was clearly amateur and 20th century.
   ``I reject in advance your judgment,'' the 39-year-old king told
the court before announcing he would not respond to questions.
``Only God can judge me.
   ``The republic does not exist. I remain king, even from my jail
cell,'' he said showing the great dignity history says he showed
during his actual trial.
   The show seemed an awkward confusion of part text, part
improvisation, bumbled lines and mixing of historical periods _ such
as when one accuser called the king, with great foresight,
``France's first collaborator.''
   Representing the king was Jacques Verges, a defense lawyer who
has made a career out of defending controversial figures, including
the Nazi war criminal Klaus Barbie. Among the accusers was Gilbert
Collard, one of the French legal profession's young golden boys.
   The public prosecutor was played by writer Jean-Edern Hallier,
whose role was mostly a matter of interjecting occasional demands
for Louis' head.
   The witnesses for the prosecution _ revolutionaries Georges
Jacques Danton, Jean-Nicolas Villaud-Varenne, Maximilien de
Robespierre and Pierre Daunou, and Thierry, the king's valet _ were
vague in their accusations but vehement in their beliefs.
   Weighing heavily against Louis was the fact that he tried to run
for it in June 1791, but was caught at Varennes. That was considered
proof that he was off to get a foreign army to help restore him to
power.
   The only witness for the defense, Chretien de Lamoignon de
Malesherbes, a minister under Louis who emigrated during the
revolution, praised the accomplishments of the reign.
   He testified that Louis was a man of peace who did well in war,
winning the only naval victory ever over England, and successful in
aiding the American Revolution. He said Louis also took France to
the heights of scientific advances, fostered a tolerance that
protected Jews and restored the civil rights of Protestants.
   Verges and Collard battled in modern-day courtroom style, some of
it obviously not programmed, prompting the judge to warn them not to
make it a ``personal duel.''
   ``Louis XVI was guillotined,'' said Prosecutor Antoine
Fouquier-Tinville, slipping down the historical path prematurely.
``You don't remake history. You don't repair accidents of history.
Louis Capet, you will be guillotined because you were guillotined.''
   Verges, in his real-life favorite tactic, accused the accusers,
asking why they did not abolish royalty in 1789 and establish a
republic.
   ``If Louis disappears, his son becomes king. Will you kill his
son too?''
   In the end, reasonableness and mercy prevailed. And when the
acquittal was announced, there were more than a few cries of ``Vive
le Roi!'' from the audience in the television theater.

   Christmas Week 20 years ago was
transformed into a magic and memorable occasion by three American
a had embarked on man's first visit to explore
another world, the riskiest and deepest penetration yet into the
void of his universe.
   Apollo 8 was to circle the moon 10 times in 20 hours on Christmas
Eve and Christmas Day, gathering navigational, photographic and
spacecraft performance data vitally needed before Americans could
attempt to land on the moon in 1969.
   The Christmas-time launch was a coincidence of orbital mechanics.
The constantly-moving moon is in position to receive visitors from
Earth only three or four days each month.
   The spacecraft performed perfectly. The men inside did not fare
as well. All three experienced slight motion sickness, and Borman
suffered insomnia and 24-hour intestinal flu. The next day they felt
fine, and, looking out the window, they saw, for the first time, the
Earth in its entirety, from 200,000 miles away.
   Overwhelmed, they transmitted to the television screens of
millions of homes this spectacular view of a gleaming marble-like
sphere of blues and greens and browns and whites.
   ``You're looking at yourself,'' radioed Borman, acting as a tour
guide.
   ``What you're seeing is the Western Hemisphere. In the center,
just lower to the center, is South America, all the way down to Cape
Horn. I can see Baja California and the southwestern part of the
United States.''
   Lovell continued, describing royal-blue waters, bright white
clouds and brownish land areas. ``What I keep imagining is, if I'm
some lonely traveler from another planet, what I'd think of the
Earth at this altitude _ whether I think it would be inhabited or
not.''
   Those television pictures had an overwhelming impact, giving
humans a new perspective of their planet. Many felt more than ever
that Earth was a beautiful planet, worth working to save. The
picture of this lonely, delicate celestial body became a rallying
point for environmentalists worldwide.
   Minutes after the astronauts signed off the television show,
Apollo 8 raced into the ``equigravisphere,'' a twilight zone where
the gravitational pull of Earth and moon are equal. Now, less than
40,000 miles from the moon, Borman, Lovell and Anders did what no
human had done before. They came under the prime influence of the
moon's gravity.
   The spacecraft, its speed gradually falling during the outward
journey, was traveling only 2,200 mph. Early on Christmas Eve day,
when Mission Control gave the go-ahead for lunar orbit, the moon's
gravity tug had accelerated the speed to 5,800 mph, fast enough to
swing the ship back toward Earth if a braking rocket failed to slow
the craft to orbital speed.
   The spacecraft moved around to the moon's backside, cutting radio
contact with ground control. For 36 agonizing minutes, the world
waited. Was the engine firing a success? Not until the ship emerged
around the moon's edge was the answer known.
   ``We've got it!'' shouted a voice in Mission Control amid a
bedlam of cheers. ``Apollo 8 is in lunar orbit!''
   Lovell, the first to expound on the moon from only 70 miles
distant, said, ``It looks like plaster of Paris, a sort of grayish
beach sand.'' He had answered the first of many questions about that
alien body that had awed humans since their beginning.
   During the next 20 hours would come answers to many more.
Throughout the day, the astronauts snapped thousands of photographs
and motion pictures. In the first of two telecasts from lunar orbit,
they relayed pictures of a wild and wondrous landscape pitted with
massive craters.
   ``It looks like a vast, lonely, forbidding place, an expanse of
nothing ... clouds of pumice stone,'' Borman said.
   Lovell saw the distant Earth as ``a grand oasis in the big
vastness of space.''
   The moonmen surveyed and photographed all five of the prime sites
being considered for the first Apollo manned landing mission. They
practiced identifying and tracking lunar landmarks and discovered
new ones. By evening, the astronauts were tired but so buoyed by
their achievements that they expanded a telecast from a planned 15
minutes to 37 minutes.
   While their camera scanned the lunar desert, blinding in the
sunlight, forbidding in the shadow, and with an estimated half a
billion people watching, some already celebrating Christmas, Anders
said, ``For all the people on Earth, the crew of Apollo 8 has a
message we would like to send you.''
   Silence fell over many households as, with the striking
television pictures as a backdrop, Anders began reading the story of
the creation from Genesis:
   ``In the beginning, God created the heaven and the Earth. And the
Earth was without form, and void and darkness were upon the face of
the deep. And the spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters.
And God said, `Let there be light.' And there was light. And God saw
the light and it was good. And God divided the light from darkness.''
   Lovell continued, ``And God called the light day. And the
darkness he called night. And the evening and the morning were the
first day. And God said, `Let there be a firmament,' and God made
the firmament and divided the waters which were under the firmament
from the waters which were above the firmament. And it was so. And
God called the firmament heaven. And the evening and the morning
were the second day.''
   From Borman: ``And God said, `Let the waters under the heaven be
gathered together into one place. And let the dry land appear.' And
it was so. And God called the dry land Earth. And the gathering
together of the waters He called seas. And God saw that it was
good.''
   Then, the emotion of the day in his voice, Borman ended the
telecast, saying: ``And from the crew of Apollo 8, we close with
good night, good luck, a merry Christmas, and God bless all of you,
all of you on the good Earth.''

   Dustin Hoffman shuddered. The screening room
projector flickered with ``rushes'' of his first day's work in
``Rain Man.'' Fighting off nausea, Hoffman knew his portrayal of an
autistic man stank.
   ``It was death,'' Hoffman recalled in an interview with The
Associated Press. ``It was the worst work I had ever done. ... I
said, `I can't do it.''' Defeated, the Academy Award-winning actor
suggested the producers try Richard Dreyfuss instead.
   Hoffman, whose past triumphs include playing a woman in
``Tootsie,'' was stumped by the part of Raymond Babbitt, a
middle-aged autistic savant.
   In ``Rain Man,'' opening Friday, the long-institutionalized
Raymond is largely incapable of basic human emotions and speech, but
gifted with superior mathematical and memorization skills.
   It's not an easy part. Having researched autism so intensively he
was buried in documents and videocassettes, Hoffman, 51, had to dump
his notes and observations in his dressing room and, well, act. No
plot contrivances offered shelter.
   As Hoffman tells it, all he could manage at first was a mish-mash
of his past work, mixing bits of the timid, near-sighted prisoner
Louis in 1973's ``Papillon'' and the sickly Ratzo Rizzo in
``Midnight Cowboy'' from 1969.
   Then, three weeks into filming, Hoffman and co-star Tom Cruise
were driving down a bleak highway near tiny Cogar, Okla. The
temperature, over 100 degrees, was matched by the humidity. In a
sweat-laced improvisation, Hoffman started talking about how much
Raymond missed his Hanes underwear. And he just wouldn't stop.
   With those cotton briefs, Hoffman figured it all out.
   ``It looked like to me that you could have talked about your
underwear forever,'' Hoffman said director Barry Levinson told him.
``And I suddenly realized that yes, this character is in the now,
and he is nowhere if he's not in the now. ...
   ``And I suddenly realized that I was playing off myself because I
know something about obsession and I'm comfortable being obsessive.
The rest of it just took care of itself.''
   ``Rain Man'' tracks Raymond's brother, Charlie (Cruise), a
coldhearted schemer whose father dies, leaving him none of the
riches he so desperately wishes to inherit. Instead, the $3 million
falls into a mysterious trust account, which Charlie discovers
benefits a brother he never knew he had.
   In an attempt to filch the inheritance and save his
bankruptcy-bound car business, Charlie abducts his newfound brother,
and the two set out cross-country, top down, in a 1949 Buick
Roadmaster convertible, their father's car.
   In a series of minor incidents along the way, the brothers reach
a remote, though improved, understanding of kinship. There are no
triumphant scenes of blissful revelation. ``Rain Man,'' whose title
comes from Charlie's earliest, dreamy recollections of a shared
childhood with Raymond, ends quietly. Some might say, indifferently.
   ``Rain Man'' survived not only Hoffman's panic but also a year of
screenplay revisions, the replacement of three directors, the
scriptwriters strike and the meddlings of various entertainment
industry know-it-alls. It emerges as a modest exploration of greed,
communication and familial understanding.
   ``I didn't think an easy ending was the right way to go,'' said
Levinson, the movie's fourth and final director. ``There had been a
bunch of endings where (the brothers) were going to live happily
ever after, but it didn't seem to apply.''
   Added producer Mark Johnson: ``What we ended up with was much
more simple than anything else that existed (in the scripts)
before.''
   It was precisely that intended lack of ornament that proved so
elusive.
   Martin Brest (``Midnight Run''), Steven Spielberg (``E.T. the
Extra-Terrestrial'') and Sydney Pollack (``Tootsie'') all were in
line to direct ``Rain Man'' at one point or another. For a variety
of reasons _ some personal, some professional _ the three came and
went. But all wanted to dress the story up.
   One script called for gangsters and FBI agents. Another suggested
a big snowstorm. The role of Charlie's girlfriend (played by Valeria
Golino) was either too big or not big enough. Raymond should be more
``retarded.'' Or maybe not retarded at all. Perhaps Raymond and
Charlie could become really close at the end? said some. Perhaps
not, responded others.
   ``They (the assorted kibitzers) felt that there had to be a
jeopardy in the story,'' Hoffman said. ``In other words, `What's
going to hold an audience if there's just two schmucks in a car?'''
   Levinson, the director of ``Good Morning Vietnam'' and ``Diner,''
suspected the audience could be held by just letting the schmucks be
schmucks. The final script, turned in by Ronald Bass just as the
five-month Writers Guild of America strike began, cut most of what
Levinson considered superfluous.
   ``I basically wanted to get it down to a conflict between two
people on the road,'' Levinson said. ``More and more of what we see
in the movies are mechanical plots. We pump them up instead of
saying, `Let's just deal with the people.'''
   Levinson's previous films have been marked by loosely organized
stories, and in ``Rain Man'' he predictably chose to let the
characters carry the narrative, rather than the other way around.
   Those familiar with Cruise's recent work (``Cocktail,'' ``Top
Gun'') might wince at abandoning the 26-year-old actor to his acting
skills in such a dramatic role.
   But Cruise shrugs it off.
   ``For myself it was a challenge. For myself, it was different.
For myself, it was the best role that I've had in my career to
date,'' Cruise said.
   ``I do feel that I have a better sense (of acting) every time I
go on from a picture. You get more confidence _ not cocky, like I
know what I'm doing _ but a confidence of trying scenes different
ways and not getting locked into one idea of how to play a scene.''
   Hoffman, as is his custom, made story suggestions throughout
filming. On several occasions, he checked with his autism experts to
ensure the film did not ``violate'' the truth, as Hoffman put it.
   When the script didn't withstand such challenges, it was revised.
Any behavior by Raymond that might come across as ``stupid,'' for
instance, was excised. Autism, Hoffman was told, is a mental
disorder, not retardation.
   Whether or not such attention to detail will attract audiences
remains to be seen.
   ``You have no idea what the audience is going to think,'' Hoffman
said. ``Underneath everything, there's a desire to have an impact on
the audience. I don't want them to get up afterward.
   ``Arthur Miller said to me when we were doing `Death of a
Salesman,' `You want to know when the play is really working? When
the curtain comes down and you don't hear anything.'''

   Amid the frozen farm fields of Iowa, Judy Shelly answered a cry
for help from a small wooden garage. Huddled inside were a mother
and three children. They'd lost almost everything _ including their
home.
   They had blankets, beds, a few sticks of furniture and a hot
plate, but no bathroom or refrigerator. No money either. Forced off
their farm, abandoned by husband and father, the family was
struggling to survive.
   Their predicament is a sad but increasingly common sign of hard
times in the heartland. As farmers lose their land, small-town
factories shut their doors and housing costs rise, growing numbers
of rural folks are joining the ranks of the nation's homeless.
   ``Rural homeless people are everywhere around us,'' said Louisa
Stark, president of the National Coalition for the Homeless.
``They're living in barns and chicken coops. They're doubled and
tripled up with families and friends. They're living under trees or,
in some cases, sleeping in caves.''
   Garages, too. The Iowa family had rented a nearby house after
losing their farm last winter, but when the pipes burst and the
landlord couldn't afford repairs, they moved into the garage because
it was cheaper to warm with a kerosene heater.
   Shelly, who works for a farmers-assistance group, helped find
them a place to stay. They moved on shortly after.
   People think rural America ``has been able to stand on its own
two feet ever since the Depression,'' Shelly said. ``(They think)
somehow they'll get by. They think you have the white picket fence,
mom and dad sit down at the table and eat with the kids. That's not
the way it is.
   ``The reality is urban life and rural life are not much different
anymore,'' she added. ``We have people going without food. We have
people going without heat.''
   And people going without roofs over their heads.
   Up to 3 million Americans are homeless, the national coalition
says. Some experts estimate 10 percent to 20 percent are in rural
areas, but nobody knows for sure because they aren't as conspicious
as people panhandling on city streets or sleeping on grates.
   ``Everybody calls the rural homeless invisible. In fact, they
are,'' said Melanie Roth of the Housing Assistance Council in
Washington, D.C., which deals with rural low-income housing needs.
   ``They don't wander the streets of small-town America,'' said
Keith Luebke, co-director of the Welcome Inn Transitional Living
Center in Mankato, Minn. ``They leave or they somehow hide
themselves or hide their problems. They don't want anyone to know.''
   Most of the newest rural homeless are working poor and farm
families, says a report by the Institute of Medicine, part of the
National Academy of Sciences. Compared with their urban
counterparts, the report says, they're younger families dependent on
two incomes; typically, one wage-earner loses a job and the
remaining income isn't enough to pay the rent. They most often live
in counties where employment is dependent on single troubled
industries.
   These people face a Hobson's choice of moving in with friends or
relatives _ or pulling up roots and leaving. The institute's report
said some rural areas have a five-year waiting list for public
housing.
   Though their numbers are just a fraction of those in the cities,
the rural homeless get much less help _ fewer shelters, fewer soup
kitchens, less money from charities.
   ``In short, the faint voice that has recently been given to the
homeless in urban America has been denied the homeless of rural
America,'' said a national coalition study on such problems in
Appalachia and the South.
   Several studies have examined rural homelessness. Among the
findings:
   _ More than three-quarters of community agencies responding to a
Housing Assistance Council survey last year reported increases in
rural homeless from 1981-82 to 1986-87. Of those, 38 percent said
the increase was significant.
   _ In Ohio, the proportion of women among the rural homeless was
twice that of urban homeless populations, according to a 1985 study.
That's partly due to the higher percentage of married people among
the rural homeless, 18.5 percent against 6.7 percent married among
urban homeless.
   _ In Minnesota, 36 percent of adults in shelters and transitional
living centers had jobs, compared with 24 percent in urban
Minneapolis, said a 1988 study by the Minnesota Coalition for the
Homeless.
   _ In Iowa, a study found one of the larger groups in danger of
losing homes was farm widows, many of whom live on just a few
hundred dollars a month.
   The count of rural homeless should also include people who live
in ramshackle houses or stay with friends and family, a common
arrangement among down-and-out farmers, the experts say. It may be
21 people living in one house, nine children and three adults
squeezed in a trailer or a family so crowded they sleep in shifts.
   ``You have people living on top of each other. Those are the
hidden homeless,'' said Luebke. ``These people no longer have their
own home or apartment. They have a roof over their head, but in real
terms they should be considered homeless.''
   Living conditions for others are so abysmal that social agencies
say it's tantamount to being homeless.
   ``When people have a home where the roof is constantly leaking
and the cold air can come in ... (and) there's no money to fix those
things, that's not a home,'' said Norma Dell, director of Bethany
House, a Kentucky social service center.
   Agencies around the country have files on people living in
rat-infested shanties, rotting houses without walls or shacks
without heat, water or toilets. Others describe a wheelchair-bound
man living under a bridge after being evicted, an Indian family
sleeping in an old school bus and drawing water from a horse trough,
a man who lived in an abandoned refrigerator.
   Stark said she's heard reports from California of farmworkers
living in groves of trees or taking shelter in caves.

   Much of rural homelessness is tied to economics: the slump in the
timber, agriculture, mining, meat and energy industries, the loss of
manufacturing jobs, farm foreclosures and the ripple effect on Main
Street.
   ``You're dealing with people four or five years ago who would
have been middle-class citizens,'' said Keith Swenson, who works at
a social service agency in Mora, Minn. ``They're chronically
underemployed. They're not much different than you and I.''
   The decade's farm crisis has fueled the decline. The government
estimates 274,000 farms disappeared from 1980 through this year, and
the number of people living on farms dropped from 6 million in 1980
to 5 million last year.
   Rural poverty increased by a third from 1978 to 1986, said a
report by Public Voice for Food and Health Policy, a
Washington-based consumer education and research group. In 1986, 9.7
million rural people lived in poverty, the group said.
   One consequence: people can't help themselves, much less each
other.
   ``Although communities very often try to band together to help a
person, it's becoming more and more difficult because so many people
are suffering,'' Stark said.
   Experts also say pride makes people reluctant to admit their
troubles.
   ``There's a real Midwest ethic: You don't get it unless you work
for it,'' said Ane Fitzgerald, organizer for the Des Moines
Coalition for the Homeless. And, she said, ``If you're homeless or
destitute in a big city, you can be anonymous. In a small town, you
can't.''
   Often, people hide their problems.
   ``You try not to let anyone else in the community know just how
hard it is,'' said Paula Neumann, who was homeless a decade ago in
Wisconsin. ``If you talk about it, it's your personal failure.
That's what you believe. You're of pioneer stock. ... You're left
with the feeling you've failed to do something that's worked
before.''
   Even if people acknowledge their problems, help may be many miles
away.
   ``Your survival in the city is easier,'' said Michelle Budzek,
director of a Kentucky shelter. ``If you're hungry, you can walk to
the soup kitchen. If you need medical attention, there are shelters
in almsot every city across the country. In rural communities, folks
are isolated. Even getting to services is real difficult.''
   Some places make an extra effort. A program covering 10
northwestern Minnesota counties tries to ensure food stamps are
available to the homeless and those in danger of losing their homes.
   Small towns in Ohio and other states are setting up shelters and
transitional centers.
   But housing remains a major problem.
   As far back as 1983, the Department of Housing And Urban
Development estimated that 1.8 million members of very low-income
rural households were living in severely inadequate or inadequate
housing.
   The problems of rural homelessness have been building for years
but only recently are gaining recognition.
   ``People have already been working on solutions in urban areas
the last eight years,'' said Barbara Ferraro, director of a West
Virgina center aiding the indigent. ``They've only begun to voice
the fact that (homelessness) may be in rural areas.
   ``What we see today as the problem of the urban homeless is
probably the tip of the iceberg of what we'd see if we look
critically at the rural areas,'' she added. ``The solutions are not
as easy to come by. We cannot Band-Aid the rural problem at all. .
.. We cannot just put people in shelters. That's not a solution.''
   ``As we begin to undercover more and more, you're going to see a
crisis has been there for many years,'' she said. ``It'll only get
worse if we do not do something about it.''

   Dwaine Vise rode the rails for years,
hopping off in tiny towns, getting drunk by day, going hungry and
homeless at night. He slept almost anywhere _ even a morgue. Then he
found refuge.
   It was on a farm, the kind of place where he was raised. When he
arrived, Vise had no home, no family and no future.
   ``They say you've got to hit rock bottom,'' said the ruddy
55-year-old Vise. ``I guess I was damn close. I just found out I had
to do something or I was going to die in the street or alleyway.''
   Vise lives at Terebinth Farmstead, 54 acres of solace and soil
that offer temporary and permanent housing for a small group of men
who've lived on the streets for years. Most are recovering
alcoholics. Many also were rail riders, sneaking onto freight
trains, living in box cars, moving from town to town.
   The western Minnesota farm, one of a small number of innovative
programs serving the rural homeless, is owned and operated by the
Dorothy Day House, a short-term shelter in nearby Moorhead named
after the Roman Catholic activist and journalist who co-founded The
Catholic Worker newspaper.
   The farm, which opened 17 months ago, follows Day's philosophy:
treat the poor with dignity and respect.
   Terebinth has two purposes, said Barb Martens, the farm's
director.
   ``For the long-term guest, it's their home _ a place they can
live and die and not drink themselves to death,'' she said. ``For
the short-term guys, it's just a safe place to be.'' She said
short-termers stay six months to two years.
   The pastoral setting _ the farm has a barn, lake, cow, rabbits,
cats and dogs _ was chosen to get the men, many of whom have rural
roots, back to the land.
   ``There's something about that place that is so healing,''
Martens said. ``It's not a place no one else wants. It's a place
where we're saying `We think you deserve the best. We're going to
give you the best.' It makes them something other than the least,
the waste of society.''
   The farm, named after the tree in the Bible under which Abraham
provided hospitality and shelter for the messengers of God, holds up
to 10 men. All must live at the Dorothy Day House before moving to
Terebinth. Moorhead attracts rail riders because it's on a freight
train route.
   All prospective Terebinth residents with alcohol problems must
undergo treatment before they come to the farm. Drinking is taboo
there. Martens said the residents' drinking problems were considered
when choosing a location. The nearest tavern is nine miles away.
   ``You don't have the temptations you do in town,'' Vise said.
``You feel like you're on your own, not in some institution. There's
not someone standing over you. You just do your own thing. Out here
you can keep busy.''
   Some men pick up work at nearby farms. They have a garden, can
vegetables and care for the animals. A Dorothy Day staffer lives
there full-time.
   Still, the presence of homeless men _ a few have criminal records
_ aroused fierce opposition. Martens said the program was rejected
in three communities before the farm outside Hawley was found.
   The five-bedroom house, replete with fireplace, den and woodshop,
is alien to men who've spent years scrounging for food, selling
blood to survive and sleeping under bridges, in sawdust piles or
hotel bathrooms.
   Even now, beds, hot meals and a roof don't guarantee success.
   Andy De Maio, a Terebinth resident who has been homeless many of
his 52 years, has never held a job an entire year. A fifth-grade
dropout, he says he has trouble reading and making change.
   ``It isn't as easy to turn your life around as people think,'' De
Maio said. Some say, ``All you do is get yourself a job. It'll cure
your problems. (But) you can't live on the streets and expect to go
to work everyday. You can't function well enough.''
   The farm ``gives you a good chance to get straightened out,'' he
added. ``I hope I do. I think it's going to be mostly up to me.''
   Although there's no followup program, Martens said about half of
those who've left the farm have succeeded in getting on with their
lives.
   For Vise, who came to the farm last summer, it's a fresh start.
Vise, who was divorced before his wife died, says he's been in
alcohol treatment programs four or five times.
   He said his life deteriorated when his drinking got out of
control. He couldn't hold a job and ended up on the streets. He was
too proud to panhandle and too embarrassed to let his three children
see him.
   ``When I got sober enough, I realized there was nothing,'' he
said. ``No family. No home. No nothing.''
   Vise doesn't intend to drink again.
   ``You never say that's it,'' he said. ``I won't say I won't but I
doubt it. I don't think I'll be on the streets again. I've learned a
lot since then. If you want to quit, you can quit. If you can get
your self-respect back, then you've got a chance.''

   When it opened, it was a blue and white miracle in
concrete and steel, built in a civic frenzy to bring major league
sports to the South.
   Twenty-three years later, Atlanta-Fulton County Stadium finds
itself a pariah among ballparks, a place that both its tenants _
baseball's Braves and football's Falcons _ are desperately trying to
flee even before the mortgage is paid off.
   Grumbling about the stadium has gone on for years.
   The round configuration isn't perfect for baseball, and for
football, everyone agrees, it's worse _ when the rectangular field
is fitted in beneath the circular stands, the usually desirable
50-yard-line seats are farthest away from the action.
   Dirty concourses and disgusting restrooms led some in recent
years to dub it ``Atlanta-Filthy County Stadium.'' The quality of
the playing field has drawn complaints from Atlanta players and
opposing teams alike. Narrow concourses leave little room for modern
concession areas.
   Still, the downtown stadium is structurally sound, repainted and
looking pretty good, although the restrooms can still get unpleasant.
   But 1988 may be remembered as the beginning of the end for
Atlanta-Fulton County Stadium.
   Both the Falcons and the Braves insist they will not sign up for
another hitch after their leases run out in 1990. It is now possible
that within the next decade, the city of Atlanta, once home to five
major-league sports franchises, will be down to one, its once proud
stadium bulldozed and the land sold to pay off the debts.
   ``I don't enjoy hearing things like that,'' said Ivan Allen Jr.,
the dynamic mayor of Atlanta from 1961-69 who still boasts of how he
and his city built a major league ballpark ``on ground we didn't
own, with money we didn't have, for a team we hadn't signed.''
   ``I walked around the stadium (at the Dec. 4 Falcons game) and it
was in excellent condition,'' Allen said recently. ``It could be
used, and be in good shape, for a long time.''
   But it appears it won't be.
   In 1986, a civic panel recommended two new stadiums: a domed
football arena adjoining the Georgia World Congress Center
convention facility downtown by 1990, and a new baseball park at the
present stadium site by '95.
   In 1987, Falcons owner Rankin M. Smith Sr., long fed up with a
lease that benefits the Braves, with a lack of luxury boxes and with
the stadium itself, said he would not renew it.
   Since then Smith has, at various times, discussed playing in the
proposed ``Georgia Dome,'' building an open-air stadium near the
team's suburban Gwinnett County training complex, 30 miles from
downtown Atlanta, and even moving the franchise to football-hungry
Jacksonville, Fla., and its 80,000-seat Gator Bowl.
   The Falcons are gone, concedes Reggie Williams, the stadium
authority's executive director since April 1987.
   ``I'd say so. ... I can understand that the football people here
need to leave to get into an environment where they can share in
other ... revenues.''
   Then, earlier this month, Atlanta Braves President Stan Kasten
dropped a bombshell: The Braves aren't staying either.
   The Braves, he said, are holding ``very serious discussions''
about moving to a proposed state-of-the-art baseball stadium in
Gwinnett County.
   Kasten, in a recent interview, said detailing the problems with
the stadium would take ``a laundry list.'' He mentioned specifically
the lack of modern amenities and the round configuration.
   ``Can you play baseball there? Sure you can,'' Kasten said. ``Can
you play football there? Sure you can.
   ``We just want a better place _ a place that is competitive with
the modern-day stadiums, built only for baseball. ... I'm not saying
it's unplayable. But we can do better, and if the Braves can, we
certainly should pursue that.''
   Kasten says the Braves would consider other metro Atlanta
locations, and would probably agree to stay in the current facility
until that new downtown baseball stadium _ ``which we were promised,
really'' in the 1986 plans _ can be built in the mid-90s.
   But the proposed $159 million football dome remains tangled in
financial and political haggling, and the subsequent $60 million
baseball stadium is not even under serious consideration yet.
   ``We're interested in getting a new facility,'' Kasten said.
``They (the city and Fulton County) don't want to talk about that.
So there's not much for us to discuss right now.''
   That leaves the Braves, in Kasten's words, ``very close to
getting into substantive, detail-type conversations'' with Gwinnett
officials. ``I've been very impressed with the enthusiasm and the
spirit I see among the people in Gwinnett,'' he said.
   The idea of the Braves and Falcons leaving Atlanta has yet to
spawn a great public outcry. The two teams have made the playoffs in
only five out of their 46 combined seasons in Atlanta, and cynics
suggest the city wouldn't miss them.
   And while most Atlanta officials are backing the dome plan for
the Falcons, they haven't exactly scurried to keep the Braves in the
city limits. Atlanta City Council President Marvin Arrington, while
accusing the Braves of racism in wanting to move to the white
suburbs, said the city would ``welcome other municipalities within
our community to shoulder more of the costs'' of pro sports.
   Both teams could be gone from the stadium by 1991 _ despite the
fact that the debts won't be paid off until 2000. The city, Williams
said, might wind up selling the land just to pay off the stadium
debts: ``The question becomes whether the value of the property is
equal to the amount of money owed.''
   All of this is a far cry from 1964, when sports in Atlanta meant
Georgia Tech or minor league baseball's Atlanta Crackers. It was
then that ground was broken for the stadium that would propel the
city _ literally and figuratively _ into the big leagues.
   Atlanta Stadium, with Ivan Allen at the whip, was built in just
51 weeks, with $14 million borrowed from booster-minded bankers. The
Braves moved from Milwaukee in 1966; the Falcons came that fall.
Within six years came basketball's Atlanta Hawks, who play in The
Omni downtown, and hockey's Flames and soccer's Chiefs, both since
departed.
   ``Twenty-five years after that stadium was built ... it's paid
for itself handsomely, with what it's done for Atlanta since then,''
Allen said. ``I certainly would have hoped it would have gone on for
a much longer time.''
   Sports in the suburbs, he said, ``would be better than not having
anything.'' But Allen thinks losing either team to the suburbs would
be a blow to the city.
   ``I think its preferable that they stay in the city of Atlanta,''
he said. ``That's the core of everything.''

<HEAD>Analyst Says Grain Imports Put Financial Burden on Soviet Economy</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The higher cash costs of importing U.S. grain
and soybeans have caused grumbling among the Soviet Union's
financial planners and are contributing to Moscow's huge economic
problems, says an Agriculture Department economist.
   For example, in the first nine months of 1988, about $1.2 billion
worth of U.S. grain was shipped to the Soviet Union. In addition,
about $362 million worth of soybeans and soybean meal was shipped.
   In all, counting sales by other countries, the Soviets may spend
around $16.5 billion on imports of agricultural products this
calendar year, up about $1 billion from 1987, says Kathryn Zeimetz
of the department's Economic Research Service.
   ``The bill for grain, the primary farm import for which the
Soviets pay hard currency, will increase over $1 billion from 1987's
$2.6 billion, mostly because import prices are up 35 percent,'' she
said.
   It is this drain that disturbs Moscow's planners most. The main
source of hard currency for the Soviet Union is from petroleum
sales, but oil prices are down and grain prices are up.
   ``Energy sales to the West usually account for 60 percent of
Soviet hard currency receipts,'' Zeimetz said in a recent report.
``Soviet oil export prices in the first nine months of 1988 averaged
below 1986. The 15 percent to 20 percent price increase in 1987 was
more than lost in 1988.''
   Zeimetz said Soviet agricultural import volume in 1989 may be
about at the same total level, except that grain imports may be
greater.
   Overall, the cost of imports next year could rise substantially,
with grain prices rising by as much as 20 percent, she said.
   ``The cost of increased agricultural imports _ coupled with
relatively low petroleum prices, deteriorating terms of trade, and
continued need for non-agricuturl imports _ could make Soviet
traders even more exacting in 1989,'' Zeimetz said.
   Much of the Soviet Union's economic problems stem from a lack of
quality food and other consumer goods, massive consumer subsidies
for food, and higher wages. As a result, she said, there has been an
excess of consumer demand and excess savings, despite both open and
hidden inflation.
   ``The Soviets have maintained the basic prices on most
state-distributed foodstuffs at 1962 levels,'' Zeimetz said. ``These
have resulted in massive consumer subsidies as production,
processing and marketing costs have risen.''
   In 1987, the subsidies cost about 60 billion rubles, or $94
billion, she said. And they continue to rise.
   ``Although small cooperatives and individual enterprises are now
encouraged, their output of goods and services is not yet
significant,'' she said.
   Meanwhile, the average Soviet's income during the first nine
months of 1988 was reported up 9 percent from a year earlier, when
the corresponding increase was less than half as much. Deposits in
the state savings bank rose 5 percent during the period.
   Zeimetz said the Soviets ``have built modestly on the 1986
breakthrough in agricultural production, when output increased 7
percent after years of stagnation or decline. Still, per capita
production has only regained its 1976-78 average.''
   Currently, she said, the Kremlin's focus is on improving farming
practices and management, increasing competition, and raising worker
incentives by decentralizing management and financial control.
   ``Decentralization's newest aim is to establish lease
collectives, predominantly on state and collective farms, but also
on land outside the socialized farm system,'' Zeimetz said. ``Small
groups can lease land from a farm, a government agency or an
industrial firm that controls it.''
   Although leasing has produced ``phenomenal increases'' in
production, efficiency and cost savings, Zeimetz said the results
may partly reflect the attention being given the few lease units in
operation.
   Zeimetz said the potential for big gains from leasing is limited
by a number of factors:
   _Administrator and farm manager resistance to giving up control.
   _Farm worker reluctance to take risks.
   _Inadequacies of Soviet farm supplies and infrastructure.
   _Doubts about the permanence of the lease program.
   _Lack of prices determined by market demands.
   _State reluctance to allow large income disparities.
   ``A recent poll showed that only about 15 percent of the adult
population favored cooperative and individual labor activities, to
which leasing is cl she said. ``Negative attitutes
about income disparities have led to vandalism,osely related,'' and are
limiting
success not only for improved agricultural production but also for
food processing and trade, and other consumer goods and services.''
   On another front, Zeimetz said the Kremlin has tried to improve
the storage, processing and distribution of farm commodities in
order to improve the quality of food and reduce losses after
harvest, which Soviet officials estimate may exceed 25 percent of
the harvest.
   ``Recently, 70 meat processing enterprises had no refrigerators,
and of the 850 refrigerators at other enterprises, 42 percent had
been in operation for 20 to 50 years,'' she said. ``Less than 20
percent of Soviet processing machinery was up to world standards,
and 60 percent was virtually worn New York the
instant she crosses the Hudson River, returned to L.A. to do another
sitcom.
   A few weeks before CBS decided to take her show off the air,
Moore was interviewed in her trailer parked outside Stage 3 at the
MTM Studios, the same trailer she used for ``The Mary Tyler Moore
Show'' and was also once used by Judy Garland. She's on a couch,
wearing a red warm-up suit. Her light brown hair is cut stylishly
short. Up close, despite her diabetic condition and too many years
spent exposing her skin to the California sun, she looks as good as
her bank account.
   She credits this to a change in lifestyle. She has quit smoking,
does light impact aerobics and has adopted a healthier diet.
   In ``Annie McGuire,'' Moore played a woman who works for the
Manhattan borough president, has a teen-age son and remarries a
structural engineer with a son and daughter. She has a mother
(Eileen Heckart) who's an ultra-liberal activist, and her new
husband (Denis Arndt) has a father (John Randolph) who's a staunch
conservative.
   The stories were a little different from the usual sitcom fare.
In one show she was held up by a man in a wheelchair, then felt
obligated to find him a job.
   In another, her husband admited to having had an affair with his
late wife's sister. Once, she had to clear her father-in-law's
reputation from an old accusation that food poisoning in his
restaurant cost Thomas E. Dewey the presidency.
   ``We're breaking a few molds,'' she says. ``We do some outlandish
things and conduct ourselves like adults having a great time.''
   It was Moore's first one-camera show without an audience since
she displayed only her legs as ``Sam'' on ``Richard Diamond, Private
Detective,'' in 1959.

<HEAD>In Eighty Eight, '88 Was the Year of Drought and Bush</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHARLES WOLFE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>EIGHTY EIGHT, Ky. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It was Eighty Eight's year in '88, when
the little farm town with the numerical name found its moment in the
spotlight as calendars flipped to 8-8-88.
   But once Aug. 9 dawned, Eighty Eight got back to the everyday
life of '88. And, as in thousands of small towns from coast to
coast, 1988 was a year for drought, George Bush and the timeless
rhythms of rural America.
   Eighty Eight has neat houses, a grocery, a tire company and two
churches stretching about a mile along a two-lane highway. Its 200
residents have no local government, no school, not even a traffic
light _ nothing, in short, that would be likely to attract attention.
   But for a few heady days in August, when the television networks
and newspapers and magazines were dispatching reporters and
photographers, and thousands of tourists were trooping to town, it
seemed the whole world was peeking in on Eighty Eight.
   ``That was a right exciting thing for this little area,'' said
David Dickerson, whose family's lumber mill is the largest local
employer.
   It was also a right unlikely thing.
   Local residents welcomed all comers with an ``88 Celebration'' on
Aug. 7 and 8. They put on a parade with an 88-year-old grand marshal
and cut a cake 8 feet, 8 inches long.
   They crowded in front of Rose Mary McPherson's 88 Market and
shouted, ``Good Morning, America!'' for ABC-TV.
   They staged The Wedding of the Century for a Wyoming couple _ Tom
Accardo and Deborah Muhlbeier _ at 8:08 p.m. on Aug. 8.
   Twenty-six thousand pieces of mail got the 8-8-88 postmark.
   Letters still arrive at the closet-size post office in one corner
of the grocery. But for the most part, ``everything is just real
quiet around here,'' said Donnie Sue Bacon, the postmistress. ``I'd
say in a week everything got back pretty much to normal.''
   That is to say Eighty Eight got back to dairy and tobacco
farming, conservative politics and lunch-hour crowds at the 88
Market, where Ms. McPherson still serves up hot meals or cold cuts
to the Dickerson Lumber Co. gang and other regulars.
   It remains a pleasant, unpretentious community.
   ``People still eat bologna sandwiches,'' said Dickerson. ``I know
I do.''
   Before and after the TV cameras came and went, Eighty Eight
mirrored rural America.
   In the spring, crops were planted and herds were turned out and
folks in surrounding Barren County, Kentucky's No. 1 dairy producer,
looked toward summer.
   But the rains stopped the first of June, pastures dried up and
hay that had been stored for winter feeding had to be hauled out
months early.
   In the fall, hopes rose with the excellence of the burley tobacco
crop.
   At the polls, Eighty Eight belied its mostly Democratic
registration and helped elect George Bush president. It also sided
with voters statewide in approving a constitutional amendment to
allow a lottery, although Barren County as a whole voted it down.
   Deep in July, Arnold Young, accustomed to gambles throughout a
lifetime of farming, had to take another.
   As a crippling drought dragged on and his cattle ate the hay he
had planned to feed them in October, Young had to decide whether to
follow some of his neighbors and dump his 57 head of dairy and beef
cattle on the market.
   ``I was beginning to think about it,'' said Young, 51, ``but I
didn't.''
   The gamble paid off.
   The rains returned by the end of July, early enough to coax
another crop of hay from the ground and to get his burley _ a
dry-weather crop, anyway _ off to a good start.
   ``This year the tobacco crop has turned out a whole lot better,''
said Young, who was in a decidely celebratory mood when he helped
park cars at the 88 Celebration.
   ``I thought it was nice. We got a whole lot of recognition,'' he
said. ``It won't happen for another 100 years. I don't think I'll be
parking cars at that one.''
   Forty years ago, voters in Eighty Eight were chronicled by
Ripley's Believe It Or Not when they split in the presidential
election _ 88 votes for President Harry Truman, 88 votes for
Republican Thomas Dewey.
   This year, the Eighty Eight precinct cast 88 votes for Larry
Freas, a Democrat from neighboring Simpson County, in a race for an
open state Senate seat.
   Democrats hold a 3-2 registration edge, but Republican Walter
Baker, from Glasgow, the Barren County seat, got 231 votes here and
won the election district-wide.
   Nor was Dickerson daunted by the Democrats' numbers as he lobbied
locally for the GOP ticket of Bush and Dan Quayle, which got 216
votes to 147 for the Democratic ticket of Michael Dukakis and Lloyd
Bentsen.
   ``It's still a rural precinct and the best way to campaign for
any candidate is just word of mouth,'' Dickerson said. ``You have to
do a selling job. It was particularly easy this year.''

<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>

   It was the year of a colossal flop and a colossal triumph on
Broadway, of strikes and turmoil in Hollywood, of a pop-music
bullseye in Dublin.
   Here are the best and worst in film, theater and pop music in
1988, as compiled by Bob Thomas, film critic and Hollywood reporter
for The Associated Press; Michael Kuchwara, AP drama writer, and the
AP's music critics:
</TEXT>
<HEAD>MOVIES</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   
   Best:
   _ `'' Drunks aren't funny anymore.
   _ ``Full Moon in Blue Water.'' A regional-theater
play-in-progress.
   _ ``The Lair of the White Worm.'' The pits from Ken Russell.
   _ ``The Seventh Sign.'' ``The Exorcist'' without brains.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>THEATER</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   
   Best:
   _ ``The Phantom of the Opera.'' The year's biggest hit and its
best musical. Andrew Lloyd Webber produced his most accomplished
score to date _ lush, romantic and sweeping music that perfectly
captured Gaston Leroux's passionate tale of love denied.
   _ ``M. Butterfly.'' David Henry Hwang's brilliant recreation of a
spy scandal and love affair involving a French diplomat and a
Chinese opera singer who turns out to be a man.
   _ ``Joe Turner's Come and Gone.'' August Wilson's story of the
search for identity among the children of slaves.
   _ ``The Road to Mecca.'' Athol Fugard's tale of one woman's
determination to remain independent.
   _ ``Speed-the-Plow.'' David Mamet's scathing look at Hollywood
greed and glory.
   _ ``The Cocktail Hour.'' A.R. Gurney's comic examination of
upper-class generational conflict.
   
   Worst:
   _ ``Carrie.'' An $8 million disaster, Broadway's most expensive
flop. It was based on the Stephen King horror novel about a dumpy,
awkward teen-age girl with telekinetic powers. Betty Buckley and
16-year-old Linzi Hateley, in the title role, sang their hearts out,
but nothing could save this dud.
   _ ``Chess.'' Another turkey that signaled that the British
musical domination of Broadway was over. Despite its good score by
Tim Rice and members of ABBA, it died because of a deadly book by
Richard Nelson and turgid direction by Trevor Nunn.
   _ ``Julius Caesar.'' Al Pacino and Martin Sheen brought Hollywood
glitz but nothing else to ``Julius Caesar.'' The two stars, along
with Edward Herrmann, massacred Shakespeare.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>POP MUSIC</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   
   Best:
   _ ``Rattle and Hum,'' U2. An ambitious, important and satisfying
record. The Irish superstars swing wildly at numerous musical
styles, and more often than not hit the mark in their part-live,
part-studio double album.
   _ ``Tracy Chapman,'' Tracy Chapman. Stirring songs of love and
social conscience from the year's most distinctive new voice. Sets
one to wondering if Chapman is An Important Artist For The 1990s or
a folkie with a few great songs who just got a break. Her big tour
didn't answer the question; her next album will.
   _ ``The Mona Lisa's Sister,'' Graham Parker. A fine comeback by a
brilliant artist all but given up for dead. Parker, one of the '70s
finest songwriters, is caustic, as ever, but this literate and
listenable record shows more facets of the man than anything he's
done in years.
   _ ``Talk Is Cheap,'' Keith Richards. No, Keith Richards can't
sing. But this is rousing, rocking, flat-out fun _ a raunchy,
whiskey-soaked collection of songs with not a single frill attached.
The only problem with ``Talk Is Cheap'' is that its release has
revived childish arguments over who's the coolest, Mick or Keith.
Well, we've always known it's Keith, haven't we?
   _ ``Conscious Party,'' Ziggy Marley. The son of reggae legend Bob
Marley delivers a sparkling debut. Ziggy appears to have his late
father's knack for sharp, topical songs that also are danceable.
   
   Worst:
   _ ``Baby I Love Your Way-Free Bird Medley,'' Will To Power. All
the worst memories of the '70s come rushing back, sort of like a bad
meal.
   _ ``Don't You Know What the Night Can Do,'' Steve Winwood. Is it
a song? Is it a commercial? Only his accountant knows for sure.
   _ ``Heavy Nova,'' Robert Palmer. He sold his soul for a hit, and
this is our payback.
   _ ``Brian Wilson.'' Far from the triumphant comeback some
proclaimed. Wishing doesn't make it so.
   _ ``Hysteria,'' Def Leppard. Nothing could be worse.

<HEAD>Meager Year for Musicals; Several New Plays Flourished</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL KUCHWARA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Drama Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It was a meager year for musicals, but a
half-dozen deserving new plays and several old ones managed to make
it to New York and flourish during 1988.
   ``The Phantom of the Opera'' was the year's biggest hit and its
best musical. Deservedly so. Andrew Lloyd Webber produced his most
accomplished score to date _ lush, romantic and sweeping music that
perfectly captured Gaston Leroux's passionate tale of love denied.
Michael Crawford was a heart-stopping and heart-breaking phantom,
Harold Prince's direction was impeccable, and Maria Bjornson
provided some eye-popping costumes and scenery.
   But after ``Phantom,'' which opened in January, nothing else
excited the musical theater for the rest of the year. There were
minor American musicals like the short-lived ``Mail'' and the two
one-act musicals about love operating under the title ``Romance
Romance.''
   The inevitable turkeys also took to the stage, particularly two
British gobblers, ``Carrie'' and ``Chess.''
   ``Carrie,'' in particular, signaled that the British musical
domination of Broadway was over. The show was an $8 million
disaster, Broadway's most expensive flop. It was based on the
Stephen King horror novel about a dumpy, awkward teen-age girl with
telekinetic powers. Betty Buckley and 16-year-old Linzi Hateley, in
the title role, sang their hearts out, but nothing could save this
dud.
   New York had better luck with plays, particularly new works by
American authors. Topping the list, and also taking the Tony award
as best play, was ``M. Butterfly,'' David Henry Hwang's brilliant
recreation of a spy scandal and love affair involving a French
diplomat and a Chinese opera singer who turns out to be a man. David
Dukes now plays the diplomat and gives such a compelling,
on-the-edge performance that the play seems even better than when it
first opened last March.
   Other notable new works by established playwrights included ``Joe
Turner's Come and Gone,'' August Wilson's story of the search for
identity among the children of slaves; Athol Fugard's ``The Road to
Mecca,'' a tale of one woman's determination to remain independent;
``Speed-the-Plow,'' David Mamet's scathing look at Hollywood greed
and glory, and ``The Cocktail Hour,'' A.R. Gurney's comic
examination of upper-class generational conflict.
   Lesser-known playwrights also had success. Off-Broadway's
``Reckless,'' by Craig Lucas, was a biting black comedy about a
woman's escape from her family after her husband announces he plans
to have her killed on Christmas Eve.
   Richard Greenberg's ``Eastern Standard'' offered another
fascinating evening. It opens on Broadway Jan. 5, direct from
off-Broadway's Manhattan Theater Club. The play follows several
yuppies as they try to grow up in New York during the late 1980s.
It's a witty, compassionate play about the most disliked group in
America.
   Several actors gave memorable performances this year.
   Among the best: B.D. Wong, whose gender switch in ``M.
Butterfly'' was nothing less than astonishing; Robin Bartlett, the
distraught wife in ``Reckless''; Yvonne Bryceland, the feisty,
independent sculptor in ``The Road to Mecca''; Ron Silver, oozing an
insincere charm as a smarmy would-be Hollywood producer in
``Speed-the-Plow,'' and Nancy Marchand as a diplomatic and wise WASP
matriarch in ``The Cocktail Hour.''
   But there were other performances that some actors might want to
erase from their Playbill biographies: Al Pacino, Martin Sheen and
Edward Herrmann massacring ``Julius Caesar'' in more ways than one;
Madonna, sleepwalking through her role in ``Speed-the-Plow''; and
Mariette Hartley coming to grief as a grief-stricken queen in
Shakespeare's rarely produced ``King John.''
   Most underrated performance: Sarah Brightman in ``The Phantom of
the Opera.'' Sure she isn't Sarah Bernhardt, but the woman has a
glorious, pristine voice that would be terrific to hear in some
classic musical comedy by Rodgers and Hart, Gershwin or Porter. And
Lloyd Webber wrote the role of Christine in ``Phantom'' for her. If
there's any doubt, listen to the singers who have followed her in
the New York cast. Not even close.
   Most overrated performances: Four of the five performers in the
revival of ``Ain't Misbehavin'.'' The show should have been called
``Are Misbehavin',' considering the extra histrionics _ vocal and
otherwise _ by Nell Carter, Ken Page, Armelia McQueen and Charlaine
Woodard. Only Andre De Shields managed to rein in the theatrics.
   The year produced three exceptional revivals: Peter Brook's spare
but satisfying version of Chekhov's ``The Cherry Orchard,'' done by
the Brooklyn Academy of Music at Brooklyn's Majestic Theater; Sean
O'Casey's ``Juno and the Paycock,'' in an atmospheric production
from the Gate Theater in Dublin; and the Lincoln Center Theater's
dark, brooding version of Thornton Wilder's ``Our Town.''
   Not hitting the mark was the year's most anticipated revival,
Samuel Beckett's ``Waiting for Godot,'' starring Steve Martin and
Robin Williams and directed by Mike Nichols at Lincoln Center. The
ticket demand was enormous. Most people, including some subscribers
to the Lincoln Center Theater, couldn't get in, but what they missed
was more post-modern burlesque than Beckett.

<HEAD>Paralyzing Strike and Furor over `Last Temptation'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BOB THOMAS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>HOLLYWOOD (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Furor over a film about Christ, corporate
turmoil and a paralyzing strike troubled the movie world in 1988.
But it was a year of record prosperity and cautious optimism about
the future.
   Major attractions in the holiday market guarantee that film
grosses will pass last year's record of $4.85 billion. After a
roaring summer and a slight dip after Labor Day, ticket sales boomed
over the Thanksgiving weekend with such movies as ``Scrooged,''
``Oliver and Company'' and ``The Land Before Time.''
   Two comedies, ``The Naked Gun'' and ``Twins,'' the drama ``Rain
Man'' and other December offerings will help swell the year's total,
demonstrating anew that America has an almost insatiable appetite
for movie entertainment.
   But not everything in Hollywood was coming up roses. Several film
companies that expanded their output when movies started booming
five years ago have now run into trouble.
   DeLaurentiis Entertainment Group, New World Pictures and the
Cannon Group suffered heavy losses and were struggling to survive.
After venturing disastrously into feature films, Lorimar
Telepictures hit the skids and merged into Warner Bros.
   Two of the greatest names of film history, the merged MGM-UA,
underwent a turbulent year, losing its production heads. Producers
Burt Sugarman, Jon Peters and Peter Guber tried to buy a portion of
the company, as did the Sony Corp. Both deals collapsed. By year's
end, the fate of MGM-UA was still in limbo.
   The merger of Tri-Star Pictures and Columbia Pictures into a
single entity, Columbia Pictures Entertainment, was also in an
unsettled state. The company suffered a $104 million loss earlier
this year, mostly in movie write-downs _ losses from movies that are
not released on schedule.
   Coca-Cola, which owns 49 percent of the new company, was rumored
to be seeking an exit from the movie business.
   ``The Last Temptation of Christ,'' Martin Scorsese's film about
what might have happened if Jesus had survived the cross, caused an
uproar that is still being played out around the world. Religious
fundamentalists staged a huge rally at Universal Studios, urging the
company to withdraw the film on grounds that it was sacrilege
because the movie features a dream sequence in which Jesus makes
love to Mary Magdelene.
   Universal remained firm, and ``The Last Temptation'' did fair
business, hampered by the refusal of some theater chains to book it.
The controversy continues as the film moves abroad. Greece is the
latest country to ban it.
   Having barely avoided a directors' strike last year, Hollywood
producers were struck by the Writers Guild of America in 1988. The
strike lasted 22 weeks and ended with a virtual standoff. Feature
production did not seem slowed by the walkout, but the opening of
the 1988-89 television season was postponed.
   The colorizing of black-and-white vintage movies continued to
rile movie buffs as well as the Directors Guild of America and its
members, but they could do nothing to stop the televising of tinted
versions of ``Casablanca,'' ``Boom Town'' and other classics. Ted
Turner, who owns the biggest supply of old movies, even threatened
to colorize Orson Welles' 1941 classic, ``Citizen Kane.''
   ``The Last Emperor'' was the big winner at the Academy Awards,
picking up Oscars for best picture and for Bernardo Bertolucci's
direction, but for none of the actors. The performance awards went
to Cher (``Moonstruck''), Michael Douglas (``Wall Street''), Sean
Connery (``The Untouchables'') and Olympia Dukakis (``Moonstruck'').
   The once-ailing Walt Disney Co. proved to be the year's success
story. With such attractions as ``Three Men and a Baby,'' ``Good
Morning, Vietnam'' and ``Who Framed Roger Rabbit,'' Disney deposed
Paramount as the top-grossing studio, capturing 20 percent of the
market.
   At year's end, Disney announced formation of Hollywood Pictures _
the studio's third movie production company _ to beef up its output
of feature films. The new company is scheduled to start up Feb. 1
and to be making 12 movies a year within three years.
   The new division was conceived as the most efficient way to
produce more movies to fill a void left by the failure of some
competitors and cuts at others.
   Not only did Hollywood find comfort in theater business, but the
cassette market also continued to boom, as evidenced by the
long-awaited release of ``E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial.'' MCA's first
shipment was a record 10.6 million units. That was more than twice
as many as the previous record holder, Disney's ``Cinderella.''

<HEAD>How Was Shroud Made? Where Are Whales Now? Who Were Those
Terrorists?</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   What finally became of Putu and Siku, those
celebrated whales? What is the truth about the Shroud of Turin? Who
bombed George Shultz's motorcade?
   As 1988 draws to a close, some nagging questions remain
unanswered:
</TEXT>
<HEAD>THE WHALES</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   On Oct. 7, a hunter off Point Barrow, Alaska, discovered three
California gray whales trapped by early Arctic ice. In an expensive
international operation, Eskimos cut breathing holes for the whales
with chain saws, and two Soviet icebreakers cleared a channel for
the whales to start their trip back to open water. One of the whales
apparently died in the process.
   The weary survivors, dubbed Siku (Ice) and Putu (Ice Hole), faced
a swim to the open sea of 200 ice-clogged miles, to join 21,000
fellow grays migrating 5,000 miles to warmer waters off Mexico. The
whales haven't been seen again and are unlikely to be spotted, but
hope is high for their survival.
   ``They had the will to live,'' says rescue coordinator Ron
Morris. ``They should make it.''
</TEXT>
<HEAD>THE SHROUD OF TURIN</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Science heightened the mystery surrounding the Shroud of Turin
Oct. 13 when the Roman Catholic archbishop of Turin announced that,
according to lab tests, the cloth is no more than 728 years old and
cannot be the burial cloth of Christ.
   The linen strip, 14 feet, 3 inches long and 3 feet, 7 inches
wide, bears the faded image of a scourged and crucified man.
   Scientists say they have determined the shroud was not the
product of an artist, but do not know how the haunting image was
made. Those who believed it was Christ's burial cloth had attributed
the image to a sudden blaze of light, fitting Biblical accounts of
the resurrection. Others suspect radiation, or an unexplained
chemical reaction between body secretions and the cloth.
   The bishop, Anastasio Balestrero, says carbon-14 tests on tiny
samples date the cloth to between 1260 and 1390. Although critics
are now quick to brand the linen a medieval fake, the church says
the cloth continues to be a venerated symbol of faith, and the
mystery of its origin remains.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>THE SHULTZ ATTACK</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Secretary of State Shultz escaped unharmed Aug. 8 when a bomb
exploded near his motorcade as he traveled to downtown La Paz,
Bolivia, from a nearby airport. The blast tore up pavement, damaged
three cars and blew out the car window next to Shultz's wife. No one
was hurt.
   Bolivian investigators said they believe a radical leftist group,
the Simon Bolivar Commando, was involved. Little is known about the
group, which claimed responsibility for targeting Shultz during his
10-day Latin American tour. The State Department was investigating
the attack but said it would not release its findings.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>THE CRUISE SHIP ATTACK</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   On July 11, terrorists fired guns and hurled grenades aboard the
Greek cruise ship City of Poros, killing nine people and injuring 98
other passengers returning from a day-long cruise on the Aegean Sea.
   The United States concluded that the Abu Nidal Palestinian group
probably mounted the attack, but the organization denied
responsibility. Anonymous callers claimed responsibility for a
variety of other groups.
   One theory was that the terrorists may have been seeking freedom
for Mohammed Rashid, a Palestinian jailed in Greece for entry on a
forged Syrian passport. Rashid is wanted by the United States on
charges he planted a bomb on a Pan Am jumbo jet in 1982 that killed
one person and injured 15.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>THE KUWAIT HIJACKING</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   A Kuwaiti Airlines jumbo jet with 112 passengers and crew was
hijacked April 5 on a flight from Thailand to Kuwait and rerouted to
Iran and Cyprus. Two Kuwaitis were killed before the last hostages
were freed in Algeria as the 16-day ordeal reached a negotiated end.
   Western intelligence sources said the nine hijackers were
believed to be pro-Iranian Shiite Moslems of the Lebanon-based
Hezbollah, or Party of God. But the identities of the hijackers were
never revealed.
   One published report said the hijackers were flown from Algeria
to Syria and later reached Lebanon by land. There was no independent
confirmation, but one diplomat, insisting on anonymity, said, ``The
men are believed to have gone underground with Hezbollah in a
largely Shiite part of west Beirut where their trail is easily
lost.''
</TEXT>
<HEAD>THE ZIA CRASH</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   A Pakistani military plane crashed just after takeoff Aug. 17
near Bahawalpur, Pakistan, killing President Mohammed Zia ul-Haq,
U.S. Ambassador Arnold Raphel and 28 others. A Pakistani report shed
little light on who may have been responsible for what investigators
concluded was probably an act of sabotage.
   The report ruled out accidental technical failure aboard the
sturdy C-130 transport, and said investigators found no evidence of
an anti-aircraft missile or a powerful bomb. But investigators
discovered residues of chemicals that could be used in an explosive
strong enough to cause a technical malfunction. If it was sabotage,
suspects included agents of Soviet-allied Afghanistan, angered by
Zia's support for Afghan rebels; Pakistani ethnic or religious
minorities; or agents of India, which has fought three wars with
Pakistan. The Soviet Union and India have denied any involvement.
   Some published reports suggested that if the Soviet Union or
Afghanistan is implicated, neither Washington nor Islamabad will
want to make such charges public, in order to avoid a confrontation.

<HEAD>`The Ultimate is Going to Have to Be Negotiation'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ED BLANCHE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two governments, deciding to deal, won
freedom for the last of their hostages in Lebanon in 1988.
   But 16 other Westerners remained captive, among them nine
Americans. And late in the year President Reagan acknowledged that
the United States, too, may have to deal.
   ``We're looking at every channel that we can find to try and get
them (hostages), and I imagine that the ultimate is going to have to
be somehow a negotiation with Iran, because they have control of
(the kidnappers),'' the U.S. chief executive told a news conference.
   Political and military developments in the region brightened the
outlook for the release of remaining hostages, most of whom are
believed held by Lebanese Shiite Moslem groups under the influence
of Iran.
   Iran's acceptance of a cease-fire in its 8-year-old war with
Iraq, Iranian moves to improve diplomatic relations with the West,
and Syria's moves to curb pro-Iranian Shiites in Lebanon _ all
combined to alter the backdrop to the long-running hostage drama.
   Both France and West Germany successfully negotiated with the
Tehran government over the past two years to free all 13 French and
West German hostages in Lebanon.
   Among those released in 1988 were Frenchmen Michel Carton, Michel
Fontaine and Jean-Paul Kauffmann, and West German Rudolf Cordes.
   The French government denied it made any deals. But informed
sources in Paris said France agreed to restore diplomatic relations
and repay $400 million to Iran, final segment of a $1 billion loan
made by the late Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi. The sources also said
$10 million, channeled through an Iranian businessman, was paid to
two terrorist factions in Lebanon.
   The West Germans, who have good contacts with Tehran, also denied
they made any deals.
   But informed Arab sources said millions of dollars were paid into
Swiss bank accounts, sanctioned either by the Bonn government or the
major firms employing two of the German captives, to secure the
men's release.
   Iranian leaders said several times recently that Tehran would use
its influence with the kidnappers in Lebanon to free their American
captives if Washington released Iranian assets worth several billion
dollars, assets frozen in 1979.
   Until his Dec. 8 news conference, Reagan had publicly rejected
any linkage between the hostages and Iranian assets, and dismissed
the notion of negotiation.
   The longest-held of the nine Americans is Terry Anderson, chief
Middle East correspondent for The Associated Press, kidnapped March
16, 1985.
   The other hostage Americans are educators Thomas Sutherland,
Frank Herbert Reed, Robert Polhill, Alann Steen and Jesse Jonathan
Turner, university comptroller Joseph James Cicippio, writer Edward
Austin Tracy and Marine Lt. Col. William R. Higgins.

trade shrank to $30.89 billion from July through September, the
smallest imbalance in three years, the government reported.
   The Commerce Department reported Tuesday that the nation's
deficit in its current account narrowed by 8.4 percent after an 8.6
percent drop in the second quarter.
   Half the improvement in the third quarter came from a decline in
the merchandise trade deficit, which dropped to $28.5 billion,
reflecting a record level of U.S. exports.

   The U.S. economy is likely to do better in 1989
than it has this year, because of growth in exports and capital
spending, the nation's purchasing managers said.
   Fifty-three percent of the purchasing managers surveyed felt
their businesses would be better in 1989 than in 1988, compared with
13 percent who expected it would be worse, the National Association
of Purchasing Management said Tuesday. The rest thought it would be
about the same.
   The report is based on a survey of purchasing executives in more
than 250 industrial companies in all 50 states.

   Consumers became more cautious about their
economic futures in November following the presidential election and
the renewed debate over the budget deficit, a business-financed
research group reported.
   The Conference Board said Tuesday its Consumer Confidence Index
declined to 113.1 in November from a revised 116.9 in October.
   The monthly survey, which covers 5,000 U.S. households, indicated
that although consumers showed more confidence in present employment
conditions last month than in October, they turned less confident
about the outlook for the next six months.

   The number of insolvent savings institutions
declined for the third consecutive quarter in the July-September
period, but even as government rescues soared other institutions
were slipping under water, regulators said.
   The Federal Home Loan Bank Board, which regulates federally
insured thrift associations, said Tuesday that 434 of 3,024 such
institutions were insolvent at the end of September, down from 498
three months earlier and substantially lower than the peak of 520 at
the end of last year.

billed for millions of dollars in questionable consulting fees,
officials said.
   The first investigation covered a dozen contractors, but the new
review will look at 18 more over the next 10 weeks, William Reed,
director of the Defense Contract Audit Agency, said Tuesday.
   The review was ordered by Defense Secretary Frank C. Carlucci in
the wake of the Justice Department's ongoing investigation of
possible fraud and bribery involving defense contractors.

$1.4 million for exposing workers to dangerous working conditions.
   The $1.384 million fine will be imposed if Pepperidge Farm does

   Financier Carl C. Icahn stoked the smoldering
takeover speculation about Texaco Inc., disclosing he had raised his
stake in the nation's third-largest oil company to 15.8 percent.
   Securities analysts said Tuesday that Icahn's move, which helped
boost Texaco's stock price, evidently reflected his impatience at
the pace of the company's post-bankruptcy restructuring aimed at
increasing the value of Texaco stock.
   Some said Icahn, Texaco's largest shareholder, probably had no
interest in acquiring the company himself but might be attempting to
induce another investor to make an offer.

   If projections by the nation's train, air and
bus lines are any indication, more Americans than ever will be
traveling during the Christmas and New Year's holidays in 1988.
   Greyhound, the nation's largest intercity bus line, says it will
carry 1.34 million passengers between Dec. 18 and Jan. 3, or 10
percent more than the 1.2 million people transported during the
holidays last year.
   In part, the bus line attributes the increase to a recent boost
in air fares and the limited availability of discount-priced seats
on the nation's major airlines, said Greyhound Chief Executive
Officer Fred G. Currey, who was in Cleveland on Tuesday to meet with
company employees.
   ``Airplane ticket prices are very substantially higher this year,
and they are a factor,'' Currey told reporters. ``And bus fares are
very moderately priced.''
   Currey's contention was disputed by organizations representing
airlines and the nation's travel agents.
   ``Most people buying at Christmas bought their tickets weeks and
months ago before fares went up,'' said Philip G. Davidoff,
president of Belair Travel of Bowie, Md., president-elect of the
travel agents' group.
   ``What's going to happen next year, I don't know. If the
increases are put into effect for January, it probably will mean
more people will take buses than ever before.''
   Bill Horn, a spokesman for the Air Transport Association, which
represents the nation's largest airlines, said a record 7 million
Americans traveled by air during the Thanksgiving holiday weekend.
   Between Dec. 17 and Jan. 2, U.S. airlines expect to transport at
least 22 million people, or about 500,000 more than for the same
period last year, he said. That would also be a record, Horn said.
   The nation's major airlines announced last month that they were
boosting most of their lowest discount fares and eliminating the
cheap fares that can be booked a few days before a flight. But a
week later, Eastern, Continental, Delta, and Northwest airlines
announced reductions in some of their fares.
   ``Those fare increases that were announced just prior to
Thanksgiving affected a very small percentage of the travel
market,'' Horn said in a telephone interview.
   Clifford Black, public relations manager for the National
Railroad Passenger Corp., better known as Amtrak, said the railroad
carried a record number of passengers in the fiscal year that ended
Sept. 30 and ``it shows no signs of letting up.''
   But limited capacity makes it difficult for the railroad to set
holiday records, he said.
   ``During the holiday seasons, they tend to sell out, making it
impossible to improve from year to year and from one holiday season
to the next,'' Black said.
   Denny Yatteau, Greyhound regional manager in Ohio, said he
expects 38,300 Greyhound tickets to be sold in the state for the
Christmas-New Year's season. That would be an increase of 12 percent
over a year ago.
   Black said space is limited on most Amtrak trains traveling from
Cleveland, Canton and Cincinnati this holiday season. Amtrak trains
traveling from Cleveland to Boston on Dec. 23 already are sold out,
he said.

   Inspired by better snowmaking technology and
growing attendance, ski resorts in the Northeast are spending
millions of dollars in what industry officials call the region's
greatest expansion since the 1960s.
   The smaller, forested slopes of New England, New York and
Pennsylvania also have embarked on a marketing campaign designed to
persuade skiers that skiing here is just as good as in the wide-open
slopes of the Rockies.
   ``The weather's been good and snow conditions have been
favorable,'' said Cal Conniff, president of the National Ski Areas
Association, based in Springfield, Mass. ``As a result, New England
ski-area operators have been plowing quite a bit of money into new
equipment.''
   In the country's largest skiing development project this year,
Waterville Valley in New Hampshire is spending $30 million to make
the resort set 10 miles inside a national forest the ``Aspen of the
East.''
   Waterville is adding restaurants, boutiques, tennis courts and a
high-speed detachable chair lift that cuts the trip to the top of
the mountain in half. It has 30 new acres of slopes and snowmaking
equipment to cover 96 percent of the trails.
   ``It's really an economic window of opportunity,'' said Gary
Kiedaisch, Waterville Valley's vice president. ``We've always had a
pent-up market but we wanted more capacity. We were often maxed out
in our capacity.''
   In other recent developments:
   _Stratton Mountain in Vermont spent $4.5 million to install the
largest ski lift in the country, a 12-passenger gondola able to
carry 2,400 people an hour.
   _Burke Mountain in East Burke, Vt., is making more than $1
million in improvements to the 25-year-old ski area, including
construction of 100 condominiums and a 20 percent expansion of
snowmaking capabilities.
   _Shawnee Peak in Bridgton, Maine, is spending about $1.2 million
to stimulate a money-losing operation by adding new lifts, rental
equipment, more lodge space and lights that will make it the largest
night skiing resort in New England.
   _After a $1.5 million overhaul, Ski Adventure in Ashby, Mass., is
expected to reopen in December, six years after the old Mount
Watatic ski area went bankrupt and closed.
   The 185 ski areas in the Northeast led the nation in expansion
this year, spending $60.9 million on improvements, compared with $56
million spent by Rocky Mountain resorts and $51 million in Far West
ski areas, according to the National Ski Areas Association. In 1987,
Northeast ski areas spent $92.1 million, 2{ times the 1985 level.
   Last year, the eight states in the Northeast reported about 15
million skier visits, compared with 17 million in the Rockies. In
the 1984-85 season, attendance was less than 12 million in the East.
   The East has a basic topographic disadvantage because its tallest
mountains are less than half the size of the 10,000- to 12,000-foot
peaks found in the Rockies. Mount Washington in New Hampshire is the
region's tallest mountain at 6,200 feet.
   The Rockies also offer complete resort areas with open skiing in
wide, snowy fields. In New England, most trails are cut through
woods and ski areas are typically limited to lodges and have few
other recreational opportunities.
   To meet the competition, New England skiing associations have
expanded on a national campaign _ ``Let's Go Skiing America'' _ by
pushing for vacations at local resorts and trying to broaden modest
increases in attendance over the last two years.
   ``It's not because they're losing market share to the Caribbean
or some non-ski service,'' said Phil Camp, executive director of the
New England Ski Areas Council, an industry group. ``The rate of
growth of the consumer market in skiing has not been rapid like it
was 15 or 18 years ago.''
   In Vermont, ski areas are teaming up to make the state's resorts
a destination. One new program allows interchangable lift tickets at
Smugglers, Jay Peak, Bolton and Sugarbush.
   The Vermont Ski Areas Association this year also began
coordinating fly-drive packages from Washington, Baltimore and
Philadelphia to build on the state's traditional bases of Boston and
New York.
   More man-made snow is being poured on slopes earlier than ever. A
2-year-old Eastman Kodak Inc. product called Snomax allows snow to
be made at temperatures 4 degrees to 8 degrees warmer than before,
as high as freezing.
   Thanks to more sophisticated snowmaking, Camp said more than 50
of the 72 public ski areas in the six-state New England region were
open last weekend, a ``quantum leap'' over previous years.
   Said Conniff: ``The technology that's come along has taken a lot
of the risk out of the business in the last three or four years.''
   The onset of cold weather also has encouraged area ski officials
hopeful that single-digit temperatures will persuade city dwellers
to head for the slopes.
   ``The most important thing this cold weather has given us is an
unprecedented jump on snowmaking efforts,'' said David Zemel,
general manager of the Powder Ridge Ski Resort in Middlefield, Conn.
``More slopes are opening faster than I've ever seen in the seven
years I've been here.''

<TEXT>
   Texaco Inc. is facing renewed pressure from
financier Carl C. Icahn, who has raised his stake in the
third-biggest U.S. oil company and hasn't discouraged speculation he
might resurrect a failed takeover bid.
   Icahn stoked the smoldering takeover speculation about Texaco on
Tuesday, disclosing he had increased his stock ownership to 15.8
percent of the company's 240 million shares outstanding.
   Securities analysts said Icahn's move, which helped boost
Texaco's stock price, evidently reflected his impatience at the pace
of the company's post-bankruptcy restructuring aimed at increasing
the value of Texaco stock.
   Some said Icahn, Texaco's largest shareholder, probably had no
interest in acquiring the company himself but might be attempting to
induce another investor to make an offer.
   ``I think ultimately he's looking for a way to cash in,'' said
George Gaspar, who follows Texaco for the Milwaukee-based investment
firm Robert W. Baird & Co. ``I think he's trying to stir up the pond
and attract some outside interest to take a look at Texaco.''
   Others did not rule out the possibility of a takeover attempt by
Icahn, who began acquiring Texaco stock while the company was under
federal bankruptcy court protection a year ago.
   Icahn declined to comment on why he raised his stake. Texaco
officials also declined to comment.
   Texaco stock rose 87{ cents a share Tuesday to $51.62{ in heavy
trading on the New York Stock Exchange, an indication that investors
believe either Icahn or someone else may try to win control of the
company.
   Last spring, Icahn made an offer for Texaco valued at $14.5
billion, or $60 a share, as part of a shareholder proxy fight to
oust the company's board. But his strategy was defeated by
shareholders loyal to the board, which promised to boost Texaco's
stock price through an aggressive restructuring.
   But since then, Texaco stock has not risen significantly, raising
the possibility that more shareholders would align themselves with
Icahn if he undertook another takeover attempt. Moreover, some
analysts said, the idea that Icahn could raise the financing for
such a takeover is not far-fetched.
   ``Last spring, nobody believed anybody could raise $14 or $15
billion for an acquisition,'' said Jack N. Aydin, an oil securities
analyst at the Cleveland-based investment firm McDonald & Co. ``This
year it's different.''
   The most notable example is the record $24.53 billion acquisition
of RJR Nabisco Inc. by the buyout firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co.
announced less than two weeks ago.
   Icahn said in a filing with the Securities and Exchange
Commission that he purchased 2.6 million shares of Texaco between
Dec. 7 and Dec. 12 for about $131 million, or an average of $50.37{
a share.
   Some Texaco analysts and takeover attorneys thought Icahn's move
signaled he was not interested in buying the company, because it
vaulted his stake over a 15 percent threshold that under some
circumstances triggers the anti-takeover laws of Delaware, where
Texaco is incorporated.
   Icahn would have to immediately raise his ownership to 85 percent
or wait at least three years before attempting any hostile
acquisition that would result in the company's breakup, attorneys
familiar with the Delaware law said.
   His latest move came against a background of resurgent rumors
that he was growing exasperated with Texaco's multibillion dollar
asset-shedding program and the company's failure to specify the date
of a promised $1.7 billion distribution to shareholders.
   Icahn is chairman of Trans World Airlines Inc., one of his
successful acquisitions. He widely is regarded as a shrewd financier
and takeover investor and has gone after some of the biggest U.S.
corporations, such as USX Corp. and Phillips Petroleum Co.
   He has been a thorn in the side of Texaco management, which has
been preoccupied with restructuring the company since it emerged
from bankruptcy protection several months ago after settling a
multibillion dollar dispute with Pennzoil Co.

<HEAD>IBM Announces Rolm Sale-Venture With Germany's Siemens</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER COY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   International Business Machines Corp. is reducing
its role in the telecommunications equipment business by selling
part of its money-losing Rolm operation to West Germany's Siemens AG
and putting the rest of Rolm into a joint venture with Siemens.
   The deal announced Tuesday marks another chapter in IBM's mixed
success with Rolm, a freewheeling Silicon Valley company that the
computer giant bought four years ago for an estimated $1.5 billion
to help it link computers through phone switches.
   Rolm is believed to have lost hundreds of millions of dollars in
recent years, but has grown into the nation's biggest seller of
office phone switches _ which route calls within buildings _ under
IBM's ownership.
   The purchase would make Siemens the world's biggest seller of
office phone switches. Siemens could consolidate its lead if it
manages to buy Italtel, an Italian phone company, and Britain's
Plessey Co., for which it is making a $3.1 billion hostile offer in
cooperation with Britain's General Electric Co.
   The price Siemens is paying was not disclosed, but IBM said the
deal would have no material effect on its income statement when it
is completed early next year. That was taken as positive news for
IBM, because there had been speculation the sale price would be so
low that IBM would be forced to take a large writeoff.
   John F. Akers, IBM's chairman and chief executive, said, ``I
would absolutely not characterize it as a scaling back of IBM's
interests in telecommunications.'' He said the combination with
Siemens would allow IBM to offer a wider range of products to its
customers than before.
   But analysts said IBM is turning over all responsibility for
development and manufacture of Rolm-branded products to Siemens and
is discontinuing work on a complex office switch for the European
market.
   ``For IBM, it's a very clean market exit,'' said Francis
McInerney of Northern Business Information-Datapro in New York.
   ``It is a graceful but not total retreat, no matter how you cut
it,'' said Frank Barbetta, a researcher for Probe Research Inc. in
Cedar Knolls, N.J.
   IBM will sell the development and manufacturing arm of Rolm, with
its 2,800 employees, to Siemens. It will become Rolm Systems Inc.
and include 700 employees now working for Siemens.
   IBM and Siemens jointly will own a marketing and services
company, known simply as Rolm, that will offer telecommunications
products for private networks in the United States. It will have
5,500 employees who currently work for Rolm and fewer than 100 now
working for Siemens.
   IBM gradually will phase out a Rolm manufacturing and development
plant in Colorado Springs, Colo., and offer jobs elsewhere in the
company to the 550 affect employees. Those who do not accept
transfers will be offered severance packages.
   Under IBM's ownership, Rolm has lost money steadily, but its
share of the U.S. market has risen to 18.1 percent from 14.2 percent
in 1984, according to Northern Business Information-Datapro.
   IBM had bought Rolm as insurance in case the trend in computers
was to connect them through office phone switches, according to
Kenneth Bosomworth, president of International Resource Development
Inc. of New Canaan, Conn. Instead, most office computers are
connected through special local area networks, an area in which IBM
is also strong.
   Rolm was vulnerable to competition because it does not make
switches for the central offices of phone companies, in contrast to
competitors such as American Telephone & Telegraph Co. and Canada's
Northern Telecom Ltd., Bosomworth said.
   Siemens does make central office switches. Phone networks are
being redesigned to handle computer data and video signals as well
as voice traffic, and companies that make central office switches
are at the cutting edge of work in the field, Bosomworth said.
   In a sign of the importance the companies attached to the deal,
it was announced jointly at a news conference by Akers, who rarely
appears at press conferences, and Karlheinz Kaske, president and
chief executive of Siemens.
   Rolm has development and manufacturing operations in Santa Clara,
Calif., and Austin, Texas. Siemens has telecommunications
development operations in Boca Raton, Fla., and manufacturing in
Cherry Hill, N.J.
   The companies said Rolm Systems Inc. would be headquartered in
Santa Clara, and would be expanded to include about 700 Siemens
employees based in Boca Raton and Cherry Hill.
   Rolm, the marketing company, will be based in the Stamford,
Conn., area and will include fewer than 100 people now working for
Siemens in addition to the IBM employees.

   The chairman of Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Co.,
the world's biggest company, resigned Wednesday under fire for
alleged involvement in a scandal that has spread wide tentacles
through Japan's political and business world.
   The minister of posts and telecommunications, Masaaki Nakayama,
told a news conference he had accepted the resignation of Hisashi
Shinto as NTT chairman.
   Nakayama said Shinto had denied any personal involvement in
dubious share trading but had accepted responsibility for actions by
his personal secretary.
   Japanese press reports said prosecutors had traced some 10
million Japanese yen, or around $81,000, to Shinto's bank account
from proceeds of the sale of shares in Recruit-Cosmos Co., a real
estate subsidiary of the Recruit conglomerate.
   Shinto on Tuesday had issued a statement denying involvement in
the share transaction, which was carried out by his personal
secretary, Kozo Murata, in 1986. Murata has since resigned as
Shinto's aide.
   The so-called Recruit scandal last week brought the resignation
of Kiichi Miyazawa as finance minister and deputy prime minister,
and has rocked the Japanese political and business worlds with
allegations that the Recruit company was seeking favors by
distributing shares in Recruit-Cosmos with a guarantee of easy,
tax-free profits.
   NTT, ranked as the largest corporation in the world in terms of
stock market capitalization, had business links with Recruit, which
bought two U.S.-made supercomputers from NTT and leased data
communications circuits from the telephone giant.
   As a former telecommunications monopoly, NTT has been partially
privatized, but Shinto and all other officials of the utility remain
under regulations which make it illegal for them to receive cash or
shares from private companies that NTT does business with.
   Shinto has been the chief executive of the telecommunications
giant since 1981, when NTT was still a government-owned monopoly. He
oversaw the privatization, which started in 1985, and then took the
title of president. He held that post until last June, when he
became chairman and chief executive, and the title of president went
to Haruo Yamaguchi.
   Shinto's resignation would make him the most prominent victim in
the business world of the Recruit scandal, which has also brought
the resignation of news media executives and has broken several
political careers in addition to that of Miyazawa, who a year ago
was a major contender to be prime minister.
   Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita is on a list of prominent
politicians whose aides profited from owning Recruit-Cosmos shares,
but he and the others denied any knowledge or involvement in the
transactions. Among the others are former Prime Minister Yasuhiro
Nakasone and Shintaro Abe, secretary-general of the governing
Liberal Democratic Party.
   The roots of the scandal go back to 1986 when unlisted
Recruit-Cosmos shares were offered to the prominent figures or their
aides, often to be paid for with loans from a Recruit-linked finance
company. The shares were listed for sale in the over-the-counter
market in October 1986 and immediately skyrocketed in value,
yielding tax-free profits when they were sold.

   The first fiber-optic telephone cable across the
Atlantic goes into service Wednesday, greatly increasing the number
of calls that can be placed to Europe at one time, according to a
published report.
   The New York Times, in Wednesday's editions, says the new cable
can carry 40,000 calls simultaneously by using pulses of laser light
to send voice and computer data.
   The three existing trans-Atlantic cables, made of copper, along
with satellites, can carry a total of 20,000 calls, the Times noted.
   The new cable was installed over six months at a cost of $362
million and illustrates the increasing pace with which
communications companies are stringing fiber-optic cables along the
ocean floor and across North America, Europe, Asia and Australia.
   The cable is a joint venture of 29 European and North American
telephone companies, including American Telephone & Telegraph Co.,
ITT Corp., British Telecommunications PLC, France Telcom and Western
Union. AT&T, which installed the cable, will also operate it.

   The nation's retailers lost nearly $2 billion last
year to theft and errors, including shoplifters, whose top three
light-finger items were ladies' apparel, consumer electronics and
recordings, according to a new survey.
   ``An Ounce of Prevention,'' the 10th annual survey of U.S.
retailers by the Arthur Young & Co. accounting firm, said Tuesday
that jewelry, shoes and men's clothing were at the bottom of the
list.
   ``Our survey shows that many of the nation's retailers have been
hit hard by theft and other losses,'' said Gerald Smith, head of
Arthur Young's retail group in Chicago, a management consultant for
the retail industry.
   The survey found companies lost $1.8 billion through shoplifting,
theft by employees or vendors and errors in paperwork in 1987,
compared with $1.5 billion in losses in 1986.
   The survey covered 119 retail companies operating in 47,000
locations around the country with combined total sales of $127.5
billion, Smith said. The research was conducted last spring and
summer.
   Companies participating in the survey included discount stores,
department stores and specialty stores. The names of the firms were
withheld.
   Discount stores were hit hardest last year, losing $1.2 billion
worth of merchandise while department stores lost $364 million and
specialty shops lost $233 million worth of goods, the survey said.
   For the five years from 1982 through 1987, the survey found the
following increases in shoplifting losses as a percentage of total
sales:
   _Discount stores: from 1.5 percent to 2.1 percent.
   _Specialty stores: from 1.7 percent to 2.2 percent.
   _Department stores: from 2 percent to 2.1 percent.
   The survey showed that 86 percent of department stores ranked
ladies' apparel as the first or second areas hardest hit by
shoplifters.
   ``There was a time when calculators were the hot items for
shoplifters, then it went to designer jeans, now it's designer
lingerie,'' said Lewis Shealy, vice president of loss prevention for
Marshall Field's, a department store chain.
   ``It's the highest theft department in the company,'' he said.
``We began putting designer lingerie in the department about two
years ago and this year most of the merchandise is designer.''
   Since then, inventory loss in the lingerie department nearly
tripled, Shealy said, declining to provide specific figures.
   ``We have suede bras and panties costing more than $400,'' he
said. ``These designer items are `gotta have but can't afford'
things and it's easy for a shoplifter to put a dozen bras or panties
in a large handbag.
   ``It's a combination of the designer label and the price that
excites them,'' he said.

   The Premier ``smokeless'' cigarette is drawing
less than rave reviews from some smokers and retailers, but RJR
Nabisco Inc. is not ready to scrap a two-state test of the product's
popularity.
   Despite consumer complaints about everything from the cigarette's
taste and smell to its price and unusual construction, RJR claims
Premier had ``the highest initial trial rate of any brand in recent
history, probably due to the amount of publicity that it received.''
   RJR spokeswoman Maura Payne said there are no plans for ending
the test run of the revolutionary high-tech cigarette introduced two
months ago in Arizona and Missouri.
   But the company said it had no figures on sales or consumer
acceptance of the device, which heats tobacco to release the flavor
but does not burn it.
   Negative consumer reaction is only one of the problems plaguing
Premier's test run. Public health advocates have called on the Food
and Drug Administration to regulate the product as a drug.
   A still greater threat to the product may lie in Kohlberg Kravis
Roberts & Co.'s proposed $24.53 billion leveraged buyout of RJR.
   RJR Chairman F. Ross Johnson has said Premier could cost $1
billion from drawing board to nationwide distribution. Analysts
believe that the high debt costs of the buyout puts Premier's future
in jeopardy. If the test-marketing lags, they say the new owners
would be more likely to allow the product to go up in smoke.
   Stores in St. Louis, Phoenix and Tucson, Ariz., where Premier was
introduced in October say the smokeless cigarette is not catching on
with consumers.
   ``They're terrible. They're nasty. They're beyond nasty,'' said
Mark Padgett, an employee at a 7-11 store in Phoenix.
   ``I wouldn't have them here on a death wish,'' said Jeff Meister,
manager of a south St. Louis Tinder Box shop. ``My representative
suggested them, but people try them and they don't want them.''
   Smokers who have tried Premier are convinced the new product will
attract few converts. They say it's not so much the higher price for
Premier _ 30 to 50 cents more per pack than regular cigarettes _ or
the annoying fact that they burn themselves out if left unattended.
The worst reviews come from the taste.
   But RJR officials say they are not discouraged.
   New videos which promote the product's lack of sidestream smoke
are being sent to stores in the distribution chain, Ms. Payne said.
They are not part of a crash program to save Premier, but instead
are one of several phases in the advertising campaign, she said.
   RJR's plan to test-market Vantage Excel 100s, a reduced-smoke
cigarette, in January also is unrelated to reports of Premier's
troubles, Ms. Payne said.
   One of RJR's key marketing assumptions was that consumers would
be so attracted to a low-tar cigarette that was less offensive to
non-smokers that they would take time to acquire a taste for the new
product.
   But people are not buying the two or three packs the company
believes is needed to get used to the differences in taste, aroma
and experience.
   Don Barnes, regional marketing director for Phoenix-based Circle
K, said Arizona sale figures through the chain of convenience stores
were confidential, but he characterized them as modest.
   John Spinck, who manages a 7-11 store in downtown Phoenix, said
he took on an inital inventory of 10 cartons and had sold three
packs, leaving 97 on the shelves.
   Ron Purcell, manager of a Tinder Box store in west St. Louis
County, said he stocked Premier initially but wouldn't reorder them.
``It seems like every sale is a one-shot deal,'' he said.

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar inched up against the Japanese yen today,
while share prices rebounded on the Tokyo Stock Exchange amid
optimism about an impending U.S. trade report, dealers said.
   The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average, which dropped 74.48 points
Tuesday, gained 156.92 points, or 0.53 percent, finishing at
29,754.73.
   The rebound followed the dollar's firming on the currency market
as traders anticipated a narrowing of the U.S. trade deficit for
October, said a dealer with Nomura Securities, Japan's largest
brokerage.
   ``The dollar's uptrend encouraged stock investors to buy
export-related issues such as Sony and Matsushita,'' said the
dealer, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   He said the same optimism first had pushed up the dollar on the
currency market, prompting the Nikkei to rise.
   ``Investors are now expecting the U.S. trade deficit to shrink to
about $9.5 billion,'' he added. September's U.S. deficit was $10.46
billion.
   The U.S. Commerce Department was to release the nation's trade
figures for October later Wednesday.
   Volume traded on the first section was estimated at 1 billion
shares.
   On the currency exchange market, the dollar closed unchanged from
the opening at 123.35 yen, up 0.29 yen from Tuesday's close of
123.06 yen. The currency moved in a tight range of 123.25-123.45 yen.
   A Mitsubishi Bank dealer said a majority of traders remained on
the sidelines to await the U.S. trade report.
   ``The dollar-yen rate today was barely moving in a cautious
mood,'' he said, adding that there was no other news to affect
market trends.
   If the U.S. trade deficit matches market expectations of about
$10 billion, the dollar-yen rate is unlikely to change soon from the
current level, he said.

<HEAD>Congressional Pay Subject of 200-Year-Old Argument</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN KING</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When the first Congress convened in 1789,
members were paid $6 a day _ while in session. Lawmakers created a
furor 27 years later when they decided to boost their pay to $1,500
a year, a raise that was quickly repealed.
   Two centuries after the first session the debate continues, with
many in Congress complaining that their $89,500 salary is too small
and President Reagan considering whether to offer them a sizeable
raise.
   Consumer advocates such as Ralph Nader were quick to criticize
when a presidential commission on Tuesday suggested a 50 percent pay
hike for members of Congress and other top federal officials, but
former Rep. Elford A. Cederberg, R-Mich., was more sympathetic.
   Cederberg, who is president of the Association of Former
Congressmen, said Nader, and more importantly the folks back home,
often don't realize the high cost of maintaining households both at
home and in Washington, where he estimated that lawmakers' houses
cost an average of $250,000.
   ``The average person back home just doesn't understand that if a
man brings his family with him down here, unless he has some
personal wealth, it's difficult for him to take on that kind of a
mortgage,'' Cederberg said. ``Especially in politics, which is a
rather unstable business.''
   When Cederberg came to Washington, he was paid $12,500. The
annual salary had climbed to $57,500 when he was voted out of office
in 1978 after serving 13 terms. He said he makes more money now as a
consultant.
   Winning influence also takes a toll on congressional wallets,
Cederberg said.
   ``Republicans belong to the Capitol Hill Club and Democrats
belong to the Democratic Club,'' he said. ``And there are other
people and things you have to be seen around if you're going to be
influential and they cost money.''
   The new recommendations, from a commission that weighs in with
its views on congressional pay after every presidential election,
would raise the salaries to $135,000 _ more than nine times the
nation's average personal income in 1987.
   Such comparisons are dismissed by proponents of pay hikes, who
point to Washington's high cost of living. And, just like the folks
back home, many members of Congress have to worry about babysitters
and tuition for their children, they say.
   ``I think some people think that congressmen and their wives go
around in limousines and live in big houses and go to the White
House,'' said Gretchen Poston of Washington Inc., a consulting firm
for social events and conventions. ``That's just not the day-to-day
life.''
   Ms. Poston, who was social secretary in the Carter White House,
said members of Congress and their spouses also are expected to
entertain and attend formal functions.
   ``They are supporting two households and worrying about
babysitters and at the same time they are invited out and asked to
do so many things,'' she said. ``They are expected to be all things
to all people.''
   Members of Congress are reluctant to vote themselves a pay hike,
and won't necessarily have to if Reagan accepts the commission's
findings or recommends smaller raises. If no vote is taken, the
raises take effect automatically.
   ``You've got an electorate that loves to take a bite out of your
leg,'' former Sen. Howard Baker, R-Tenn., said last month as he
nonetheless urged the commission to reward lawmakers with higher
pay. ``There's nothing closer to home than examining the pay of
public officials.''
   Critics such as Nader scoff at the reasons listed by pay hike
proponents.
   ``Money does not buy integrity, dedication and agreement,'' he
says.
   Members of Congress surely would agree. But they might quickly
add: It does buy a house. Or two.
   Supporting the higher pay can also buy trouble, a fact not lost
on the lawmakers.
   ``My appearance here kicks off my opponent's next campaign,
whoever he or she is,'' Rep. Vic Fazio, D-Calif., joked last month
when he urged the commission to recommend higher pay.
   Others argue that more money should come with the prestige of
serving in Congress. Rep. William Clay, D-Mo., complained during a
1987 debate on congressional pay that his pipefitter brother made
more money.
   Said Clay: ``I think something is amiss.''

   Here is a summary of the major recommendations
of the Commission on Executive, Legislative and Judicial Salaries,
which will be formally forwarded to President Reagan on Thursday:
   _Salaries for the top 2,500 federal officials _ including the
vice president, members of Congress, judges, cabinet members and
other senior exective-branch personnel _ should be increased by
roughly 50 percent in 1989. That amount would restore purchasing
power of those officials to 1969 levels. A member of Congress, for
example, would go from a salary of $89,500 to $135,000, as would
district judges. The vice president's salary would go from $115,000
to $175,000.
   _Congress should enact separate legislation to raise the
president's salary, which has been frozen at $200,000 since 1969, to
about $350,000. The increase could not take effect until Jan. 21,
1993, because of a constitutional ban on raising a president's pay
during his term.
   _Congress should pass legislation to abolish honoraria, the
speaking and writing fees paid to lawmakers primarily by
special-interest groups. The ban should go into effect at the same
time the pay raise is effective.
   The commission's report is only a recommendation. Reagan may
adopt or modify it when he submits his budget to Congress on Jan. 9.

   Share prices were lower in quiet trading at midday
Wednesday amid nervousness ahead of the afternoon release of U.S.
trade figures for October.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index was down 9.1
points, or 0.5 percent, at 1,743.5 at about 12:30 p.m., just 0.4
point above its worst level of the morning. The index touched its
best level, 3.2 points up, shortly after the opening.
   Shares opened on a positive note, as prices maintained the upward
momentum seen Tuesday in what dealers called a technical rebound
following the market's recent sharp falls.
   They were also boosted by news of a surprise drop in British
industrial production which could indicate a slowing in demand and
an easing of inflationary pressures.
   But sentiment was then hit by concerns that the recent hikes in
British interest rates, and the strong pound, are hurting corporate
profits. Traders also were nervous ahead of the 1:30 p.m. release of
the U.S. trade figures.
   Volume was light, with 263.6 million shares changing hands by
midday compared with 287.8 million shares at the same time Tuesday.

   Illinois has dropped administrative
charges against Chubb Corp. over the sale of drought insurance after
the New Jersey company agreed to pay a $50,000 fine and the $100,000
cost of a state probe.
   State Insurance Director John Washburn announced the action
Tuesday, four days after a federal judge in Cincinnati approved a
$48 million drought insurance settlement for 8,800 farmers in 10
states, including Illinois.
   ``Chubb has acted very responsibly in agreeing to settle this
entire issue in such an expeditious manner,'' Washburn said.
   ``As a result, the department's goal of obtaining coverage for
all of the farmers who applied for this coverage was achieved, and
we resolved our administrative proceedings and concluded this matter
at no expense to Illinois taxpayers,'' he said.
   Federal Insurance Co., a subsidiary of Chubb, was cited for nine
violations of Illinois law in administrative charges filed in
October.
   The company was accused of selling insurance against inadequate
rain to farmers who thought they were buying coverage for
drought-related crop losses. The policy is not allowed by state law.

<DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Belgium's central bank boosted all key
banking interest rates by 0.25 percentage points Wednesday,
reflecting the growing trend toward higher rates in the
international markets.
   The Belgian National Bank Wednesday said the discount rate was
raised to 7.5 percent and the Lombard rate to 7.75 percent.
   The discount rate is the interest the central bank charges on
loans to member commercial banks.The Lombard rate is what the banks
are charged for supplemental borrowings in which securities are used
as collateral.
   The National Bank had announced earlier it was raising one-, two-
and three-month treasury bills.
   The three-month rate, considered the most important in Belgian
banking, was raised to 7.4 percent from 7.15 percent, the one-month
rate to 7.35 from 7.1 percent and the two-month rate to 7.4 from
7.15 percent.
   All the moves take effect on Thursday.
   The National Bank said the rate changes came ``in recognition of
the recent evolution of interest rates on the international
markets.''
   Short-term rate levels have been rising in recent weeks in many
industrial countries, prompting speculation that both the West
German Bundesbank and the U.S. Federal Reserve might raise key rates
soon.
   Strong economic growth in major industrialized countries has
given rise to fears of a resurgence of inflation in many quarters.

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The chairman of the world's largest company resigned
today, becoming the most prominent business victim in a scandal that
also has brought the downfall of Japan's finance minister.
   Hisashi Shinto, 78, head of the telecommunications giant Nippon
Telegraph and Telephone Co. since 1981, formally resigned to the
minister for posts and telecommunications, Masaaki Nakayama.
   Nakayama told a nationally televised news conference that Shinto
had said he hadn't personally been involved in dubious share trading
but was resigning to take responsibility for transactions by his
then-personal secretary.
   On Friday, Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa resigned, giving up
the post of deputy prime minister as well, because of a similar link
to the scandal involving the Recruit Co., an information-based
conglomerate that did business with Nippon, the national telephone
utility.
   Shinto said in a brief statement, ``I have decided to resign to
take responsibility for causing trouble concerning NTT and the
Recruit affair and causing people to lose trust in NTT.''
   Aides to Shinto, Miyazawa and other prominent people in politics
and business received unlisted shares in Recruit-Cosmos Co., a
subsidiary of Recruit Co., at bargain prices or with Recruit-backed
loans.
   They then sold the shares after they were offered to the public
in October 1986 and the price more than doubled.
   The transactions were not illegal, but in the political cases
they have brought stern criticism of the links between politics and
big business.
   Haruo Yamaguchi, president of Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Co.,
was visibly shaken at the news conference, where he said Shinto's
secretary had complete control of the bank account in question.
   ``(Shinto) said the transaction may have taken place but he could
not confirm it because (the secretary's) whereabouts are unknown,''
Yamaguchi said. Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita, who also had a
former aide on the list of Recruit's beneficiaries, says he will
launch political reforms to try to rebuild public trust in
government.
   Japanese law forbids officials of a quasi-governmental
corporation like NTT from receiving personal donations from private
firms with which their company does business.
   Press reports quoted prosecutors as saying Shinto's secretary,
Kozo Murata, made $179,000 profit and that $73,000 had been traced
to the Nippon chairman's personal account. Shinto has denied reports
of his personal involvement.
   Japanese news media, especially television, have delighted in
showing political and business leaders changing their statements on
the Recruit scandal.
   Miyazawa, a contender for prime minister a year ago, gave at
least three differing versions of how a trusted aide had used the
finance minister's name to hold Recruit-Cosmos shares.
   Two other Nippon figures also have acknowledged owning
Recruit-Cosmos shares. One was Ei Shikiba, former head of the
utility's integrated network service, who has been demoted. The
other was Hisako Hasegawa, former head of a Nippon division who now
is a Recruit executive.
   Recruit's links with the telephone utility included buying two
U.S.-made supercomputers from Nippon and leasing data communications
circuits.
   Meanwhile, two business executives said they were resigning from
prestigious advisory posts in the wake of press reports linking them
to Recruit-Cosmos shares.
   Ken Morio, chairman of Chichibu Cement Co. Ltd., and Jiro Ushio,
chairman of Ushio Ltd., an electronics firm, said they would leave
senior positions with an advisory council called the Japan Committee
for Economic Development.
   The Recruit scandal has tarnished numerous careers since it
surfaced last summer.
   Three news media executives lost posts, a Socialist resigned his
seat in Parliament, and a former vice minister of education, Kunio
Takaishi, decided Tuesday not to run in the next parliamentary
election after their names were mentioned in connection with the
investigation.
   The scandal, however, hasn't hurt Recruit-Cosmos' business.
   On Monday, it announced its unconsolidated pretax profit for six
months through October was 57 percent higher than a year earlier, at
$74 million. The subsidiary's main business is selling condominiums.

   U.S. automakers said they would spend more than

pushed up health-care spending in 1988.
   ``It's the system in general, costs are escalating on all
sides,'' Ford spokeswoman Linda Becker said. ``It's not just coming
from the auto companies.''
   Becker estimated that Ford would pay out more than $1 billion for
health care in 1988, up from the $920 million it paid in 1987.
   GM spokeswoman Patricia Molloy declined to estimate how much the
No. 1 automaker would spend in health care, but said there is a
trend toward increasing costs. GM spent $2.9 billion on health care
last year.
   She said the price of the insurance and utilization of it ledto
the upward trend in costs.
   Chrysler's Lloyd Northard said comparing 1987 and 1988 costs was
difficult because Chrysler acquired American Motors Corp. in August
1987.
   Nevertheless, he said such costs were rising about 15 percent
annually, and Chrysler estimated it would spend more than $700
million for employee health care this year.

   The U.S. dollar fell against many major currencies
in Europe this afternoon after the U.S. government announced that
the trade deficit for October was only slightly better than many
economists had expected.
   The dollar, which had been mixed in light trading ahead of the
1:30 p.m. release of the trade report, dipped after the Commerce
Department announced that the deficit narrowed to $10.35 billion in
October, the smallest imbalance in three months, from a revised
September deficit of $10.67 billion.
   Market expectations for the trade deficit had varied widely, from
$12 billion to as low as $8.5 billion, but many economists had
expected the deficit to roughly match September's.
   In London, the British pound rose to $1.8250 after the report was
released from $1.8195 at midmorning. But it was stll lower than
$1.8280 Wednesday.
   Other dollar rates after the trade report, with midmorning rates
in parentheses, as compared with late Wednesday's rates, were:
1.7413 (1.7483) West German marks, up from 1.7410; 1.4670 (1.4700)
Swiss francs, down from 1.4705; 5.9525 (5.9765) French francs, down
from 5.9775; 1.9675 (1.9552) Dutch guilders, down from 1.9715;
1,285.50 (1,287.80) Italian lire, down from 1,286.50; 1.2005
(1.2020) Canadian dollars, up from 1.1995.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day begins,
the dollar rose 0.29 yen to a closing 123.35. Later in London, it
was quoted at 122.75 yen after the report and 123.35 yen before.
   London's five major bullion dealers fixed a recommended price for
gold of $419.60 a troy ounce at midmorning Wednesday, unchanged from
the opening bid but slightly lower than $420.75 bid late Tuesday.
   The bid price for gold was also $419.60 an ounce in Zurich, down
from $420.45 bid late Tuesday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold fell 16 cents to close at a bid
$421.38.
   Silver was quoted in London at a bid $6.15 a troy ounce, down
from Tuesday's $6.17.

   The U.S. trade deficit declined to $10.35 billion in October, the
smallest imbalance in three months, the government reported today.
   The Commerce Department said the merchandise trade gap between
what the United States imports and what it sells overseas fell by
3.1 percent from a September deficit of $10.67 billion.
   The decline, the second consecutive improvement, was slightly
better than many economists had been predicting.
   The dollar and bond prices were lower following today's
announcement.
   The October improvement came from a 1.7 percent drop in imports,
which declined to $38.02 billion, on a seasonally adjusted basis.
This decline offset a smaller 1.1 percent drop in U.S. exports,
which edged down to $11.75 billion.
   In another report today, the Federal Reserve Board said the use
of industrial capacity rose 0.2 percentage points to 84.2 percent
last month, the highest level since 84.3 percent in November 1979.
It was the seventh increase in eight months.
   An accompanying Fed report said industrial production climbed a
brisk 0.5 percent in November following an identical 0.5 percent
rise in October.
   On Tuesday, the government reported that November retail sales
jumped 1.1 percent, giving rise to more worries about inflation
while giving store owners more confidence about the outlook for the
holiday shopping season.
   ``It looks like the Christmas season will be better than people
feared and make an important contribution to growth,'' Commerce
Undersecretary Robert Ortner said Tuesday in releasing the report.
   Christmas sales provide general merchandisers with about half of
their annual profits. Retail sales are considered a key indicator of
economic growth because consumer activity accounts for about
two-thirds of gross national product.
   In other economic developments Tuesday:
   _The Commerce Department said the deficit in the broadest measure
of U.S. trade shrank to $30.89 billion from July through September,
the smallest imbalance in three years.
   _The Conference Board, a business-financed research group,
indicated consumers became more cautious about their economic
futures in November following the presidential election and the
renewed debate over the budget deficit.
   _The National Association of Purchasing Management said its
members expect the economy to do better in 1989 than it has done
this year, with continued growth and slower inflation.
   Bond prices fell on Tuesday in reaction to the concerns about
inflation raised by the retail sales report. The yield on the
Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond, which rises when the price falls,
edged up to 8.97 percent from 8.95 percent late Monday.
   On Wall Street, the Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which
lost 3.91 points on Monday, closed up 3.91 on Tuesday at 2,143.49.
Broader indicators of the market narrowly declined.

<HEAD>Report Says Drexel Facing Pressure to Accept Plea Deal</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. prosecutors are pressuring Drexel Burnham
Lambert Inc. to accept a plea-bargain settlement that would include
paying a $750 million fine and admitting guilt to at least five
felony counts to avoid prosecution for racketeering and securities
fraud, the Wall Street Journal said Wednesday.
   Quoting sources it did not identify, the newspaper said both
sides were close to an agreement late Tuesday that would end one of
the most intensive criminal securities fraud investigations in
history.
   A $750 million fine for securities fraud would dwarf the record
$100 million in penalties paid two years ago by Ivan F. Boesky, the
now-imprisoned stock speculator who turned state's evidence and has
been a key source of evidence against Drexel.
   The nation's fifth-largest securities firm has maintained
innocence throughout an investigation that has been colored by press
leaks and speculation.
   Drexel executives have said they are interested in a settlement
to avoid prosecution and a lengthy trial, but admitting guilt would
mark a stunning turnaround and open the firm to numerous civil
lawsuits by investors who allege they were defrauded.
   Steven Anreder, Drexel's chief spokesman, declined to comment on
the Journal story. Officials at the Securities and Exchange
Commission and Manhattan U.S. attorney's office, who have been
coordinating the Drexel investigation, also declined comment.
   Drexel is privately owned and is one of the most profitable Wall
Street firms, specializing in the market for high-yield, high-risk
debt securities commonly called ``junk bonds.''
   It has played a major role in some of the biggest corporate
takeovers of all time, including the record $24.53 billion
acquisition of RJR Nabisco Inc. by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co.
announced Nov. 30.
   Drexel is known to have set aside hundreds of millions of dollars
for a potential settlement with the government. The firm is eager to
avoid a racketeering indictment, which could seriously impair its
business and involve enormous fines if a jury found Drexel guilty.
   Three months ago SEC filed a massive civil lawsuit that accused
Drexel, its high-yield bond financier Michael Milken and three other
key employees of conspiring with Boesky to profit on inside
information, manipulate stock, defraud Drexel clients, keep phony
books and other violations.
   A federal grand jury has been expected to indict Drexel on
criminal charges as well, but the indictments repeatedly have been
delayed, evidently as a pressure tactic to convince the potential
defendants to reach plea-bargain settlements instead.
   While Drexel has expressed interest in settling, Milken has not
negotiated with government prosecutors and has vowed to vindicate
himself at trial.

<HEAD>Operating Rate at Factories, Mine and Utilities Highest in Nine
Years</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Adds last 11 grafs, At manufacturing, with breakdown</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The operating rate at U.S. factories, mines and
utilities in November rose to the highest level in nine years, the
government said today in a report likely to heighten concern about
inflation.
   The Federal Reserve Board said the use of industrial capacity
rose 0.2 percentage points to 84.2 percent last month, the highest
since 84.3 percent in November 1979. It was the seventh increase in
eight months.
   As capacity use edges toward 85 percent, economists fear
factories will have trouble producing enough goods to meet demand,
leading to shortages and price increases.
   In an accompanying report, the Federal Reserve said industrial
production climbed a brisk 0.5 percent in November following an
identical 0.5 percent rise in October.
   The Fed's industrial production index now stands at 139.9 percent
of its 1977 base, reflecting gains in light truck manufacturing and
production of equipment for businesses.
   The jumps in capacity use and the production index were in line
with economists' expectations. Most government statistics have
portrayed a robust economy in October and November, particularly in
the manufacturing sector, which has been bolstered by strong export
sales caused by the lower value of the dollar, which makes U.S.
goods more affordable on overseas markets.
   At manufacturing plants, the operating rate climbed to 84.5
percent last month, up from 84.3 percent in October. Producers of
both durable goods _ ``big ticket'' items ranging from bicycles to
battleships _ and non-durable goods reported higher rates.
   The rate at durable goods plants was 83.1 percent in November, up
from 82.9 percent. Non-durable goods producers recorded a 0.1
percentage point gain to 86.5 percent.
   The Fed said the operating rate for primary metals industries
jumped to 92.4 percent, the highest since December 1978. Most of the
increase was attributed to increases at steel mills.
   Use of motor vehicle and parts manufacturing capacity rose for
the fourth consecutive month to 85.4 percent, reflecting gains in
light truck production. Automobile plants, a subcategory, slipped to
76.7 percent, down from 77.0 percent.
   The operating rate at utilities was 81.0 percent in November, up
from 80.8 percent. It had hit a peak for the year in August of 83.9
percent because of a surge in electricity use for air conditioning.
   In the mining sector, which includes oil and gas drilling, the
operating rate increased to 82.2 percent last month. It was 81.6
percent in October.
   The Federal Reserve's production index has not declined since
September 1987, a reflection of the export-driven manufacturing
boom. A related surge in spending for capital equipment to expand
and modernize factories has accompanied the boom.
   Production in the manufacturing sector rose 0.5 percent in
November, following an even stronger 0.6 percent gain in October.
The Fed said automobiles were assembled at an annual rate of 7.6
million units, down slightly from October.
   But production of business equipment rose 0.4 percent following a
flat month in October and stood 8.8 percent higher than a year ago.
   Output at mines, which includes oil and gas drilling, rose 0.6
percent in November after three consecutive declines. Production at
utilities increased 0.4 percent, on top of a 0.6 percent jump in
October.
   Total output at factories, mines and utilities was 5.1 percent
higher than a year ago.

<TEXT>
   Nigeria Airways has dismissed 3,000
workers, a third of the work force, in a bid to keep the bankrupt
airline operating.
   Police surrounded the state airline's headquarters on Wednesday
to prevent attacks.
   Earlier this year, the airline sharply reduced its overseas
flights after accidents grounded some aircraft and two planes were
seized for non-payment of debts. Nigeria Airways has been denied
overflight rights by some countries for refusing to pay its bills.
   The airline reportedly owes creditors more than $1 billion.
   International flight attendants were replaced with attendants
from domestic flights this year after several attendants and flight
crew members were arrested on drugs charges in the United States,
Europe and Britain.
   Some senior officials were among those dismissed Wednesday,
including the director of engineering and maintenance.
   Retired Maj. Gen. Olu Bajowa, who was appointed administrator to
resolve the airline's financial problems, announced the dismissals.
   In addition to management problems, the airline suffered through
years of over-valuation of the Nigerian naira and its fares, set by
the government, which often were below cost.
   Some officials of the military government have predicted the
airline would be privatized.
   Last month, Bajowa ordered the airline to change the symbol on
its planes' tail sections from a flying elephant to an eagle.

   Alitalia canceled 28 national and six international
flights Wednesday due to a strike by pilots.
   The pilots decided to strike for two hours each morning on
Wednesday, Thursday and Friday to protest the lack of progress in
contract talks between union representatives and the state airline.
   The airline said 44 national and 10 international flights would
be canceled Thursday. The number of cancellations for Friday was not
immediately known.
   Negotiations between the pilots and the airline revolve around
salary disputes.
   Air traffic controllers had called a strike for the same period,
but Transportation Minister Giorgio Santuz ordered those workers to
remain on the job.

   The stock market gave ground today in an
unenthusiastic response to the latest news on international trade.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials dropped 6.58 to 2,136.91
in the first half hour of trading.
   Losers outnumbered gainers by about 7 to 5 in nationwide trading
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 367 up, 531 down and
540 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 17.33 million shares as of 10
a.m. on Wall Street.
   Before the opening the Commerce Department reported that the
nation's trade deficit in October came in at $10.35 billion, down
from a revised $10.67 billion in September and a shade below advance
estimates on Wall Street.
   But analysts said the difference between expectations and the
actual number wasn't great enough to stir up any significant
interest in stocks.
   In addition, they said, traders seemed concerned over separate
evidence of continued strength in the economy, which might help
induce the Federal Reserve to tighten credit further.
   Industrial production rose 0.5 percent in November, and the
industry operating rate rose to 84.2 percent of capacity, a
nine-year high.
   Among today's early volume leaders, International Business
Machines dropped \ to 120{; American Telephone & Telegraph slipped [
to 29[, and Unisys was down [ at 27~.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks fell
.36 to 154.88. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was down .15 at 295.67.
   On Tuesday the Dow Jones industrial average rose 3.91 to 2,143.49.
   But declining issues outpaced gainers by about 4 to 3 among
issues listed on the NYSE, with 540 up, 863 down and 576 unchanged.
   Big Board volume totaled 132.34 million shares, against 124.16

<HEAD>Wheat Production Could Reach New Levels, Council Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   World wheat production could reach a record 550
million metric tons in the 1989-90 season, the International Wheat
Council said Wednesday.
   This would be 5 million tons more than expected consumption and
would allow world stocks to rebuild, said the council, the
commodity's leading forecasting body.
   A decline in stocks after the estimated fall of 37 million tons
this season would leave an ``uncomfortably narrow margin of security
between world supply and demand,'' the council said.
   Stocks built up during the wheat glut of the mid-1980s are being
depleted this season because of the sharp drop in 1988-89 wheat
production caused by droughts in the United States and Canada.
   World wheat production for 1988-89 now is forecast by the council
at 500 million tons, 13 million below the previous season's figure
and 37 million down on the 1986-87 record.
   Tighter supplies this season have led to higher world prices
which are encouraging growers to increase plantings for 1989-90, the
council said.
   World production of coarse grains, principally corn, now is
estimated at 718 million tons for 1988-89, compared with 712 million
forecast in October and the 1987-88 output of 804 million, the
council said.
   The council has raised by 2 million tons to 33 million tons its
estimate of 1988-89 Soviet grain import needs. That's up from 32
million tons in 1987-88. Its estimates of Soviet wheat production
remained unchanged at 200 million tons compared with 211 million in
1987-88.

<HEAD>Sears Plans Should Bring At Least 1,400 Full-Time Jobs To
Louisville</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Plans by Sears, Roebuck & Co. for new
credit and catalog centers are expected to create at least 1,400
full-time jobs here, officials said.
   A credit-operations center will employ 600 to 700 people, while a
catalog-ordering center will employ about 800 full-time workers and
as many as 400 others part time during busy seasons, Louisville
officials said Tuesday.
   Jefferson County Judge-Executive Harvey Sloane said the county
will provide $250,000 in incentive money for the credit center, with
the county to recover the funds through increased occupational-tax
revenue.
   Becky Brown, Sloane's press secretary, said Tuesday that the
county also is discussing possible assistance for the catalog center.
   ``We've been working with Sears for months,'' Sloane said. ``This
is a major commitment by the No. 1 retailer in the world to
Jefferson County.''
   The credit operation will screen new applications for Sears
credit cards and review changes in credit limits for existing card
holders.
   The local operation will be separate from the Sears Discover
Card, which has a clearinghouse operation in Columbus, Ohio.
   NTS Inc. has a signed lease for Sears to open the credit center
at its Crossings project in eastern Jefferson County, said NTS
executive Burt Deutsch.
   Silliman Development Co. confirmed Tuesday that it has a signed
lease for Sears to open the catalog center at its Hunnington Park
project in Hurstbourne Acres off Hurstbourne Lane _ a project that
will be announced Monday.
   In Chicago, Sears corporate spokesman Bill Rule said that Sears
has scheduled a news conference for Monday at the Louisville Chamber
of Commerce on the catalog center.
   Last Wednesday the city council of Hurstbourne Acres approved
Silliman's plans for a one-story office building with 48,800 square
feet of space.
   And last Thursday, the city-county Planning Commission approved
plans by NTS for a two-story office building with about 75,000
square feet of space near Interstate 64.

<HEAD>Dock Strike Paralyzes Brazilian Ports</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Tens of thousands of striking dock
workers demanding higher pay have closed the nation's main ports,
officials said today.
   Portobras, the government agency that operates the ports, said
about 30,000 workers walked off their jobs Tuesday in 12 of Brazil's
30 ports, including Santos, Latin America's biggest port. The strike
continued today, but there were few details of how widespread it was.
   About $3 million has been lost in uncollected port fees, the
Portobras press office said.
   In Santos, 45 miles from Sao Paulo, the strike was causing daily
losses of about $1.1 million, officials said.
   About 52,000 tons of products a day, ranging from automobiles and
iron ore to soybeans and chemical products, ``are being left
unhandled aboard 25 ships that are docked in Santos,'' said Sergio
Coelho, a spokesman for the Sao Paulo State Dock Co.
   Carlos Eduardo da Silva, one of the directors of the Santos Dock
Workers Union, said in a telephone interview that workers were
demanding a 38 percent wage increase. Neither he nor Coelho would
say what the average salary of a dock worker was.
   Coelho said the dock company has not made any wage offers to the
strikers ``because we barely have enough money to pay December's
salaries.''
   Inflation in Brazil is running at more than 1,000 percent a year.
   On Nov. 23, workers at the nation's largest steel mill ended a
17-day strike marked by a clash with soldiers that left three
strikers dead and scores injured. The workers, at the state-owned
National Steel Co. in Volta Redonda northwest of Rio, voted to
accept a proposed wage increase.

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ With the make-it or break-it season in full swing

look at how two stores are handling the holiday rush in side-by-side
stories from New York City and Grand Rapids, Mich.

   Marcia Massa used to buy $280 sweaters to stock
her small Manhattan boutique Osidi, but her expectations about
holiday sales this year are slightly less ambitious.
   ``I'd shake if I took that in,'' said the store owner, explaining
how the long slump in apparel sales has colored her inventory
decisions for the season.
   While she did order a handful of $400 outfits _ with customers
shopping for New Year's Eve in mind _ the shop's fashion statement
this Christmas is stylish yet inexpensive.
   ``I think there's a big economic problem in the city,'' said Mrs.
Massa during a reporter's visit to Osidi in Gramercy Park, south and
to the east of midtown Manhattan.
   But she also predicted, ``The season is going to be OK _ I have
no doubt about that.''
   When you think of shopping in Manhattan, big stores like Macy's
or Bloomingdale's come to mind, or on a smaller scale, the scores of
trendy shops on Madison and Columbus avenues.
   Osidi is nothing like any of those retailers. It is a small
neighborhood store that caters to women who live in what is a
largely middle-class area.
   The bulk of Mrs. Massa's business comes from regular customers _
many of whom she knows on a first-name basis and who don't like the
big stores.
   They periodically stop by just to see what's new and maybe chat
and have a cup of coffee with the owner, an outgoing woman who
obviously loves what she's doing.
   The store sells casual clothing and outfits that could be worn to
work or to parties. Sweaters at Osidi go for $48 to $70, and two-
and three-piece wool jersey outfits range from about $220 to the low
$300s. At this time of the year, there are a number of party dresses
for about $200.
   Osidi does a lot of business in accessories: silver, antique and
costume jewelry; scarves; lingerie; belts and pocketbooks. These
``low-ticket'' items have been the boutique's biggest sellers so far
this season.
   Holiday sales at Osidi _ the store's name comes from the nickname
of one of Mrs. Massa's friends _ have been erratic this year.
   The Friday after Thanksgiving, in contrast to the mob scene
uptown at Macy's, Bloomingdale's and other big stores, Osidi was
quiet, but Mrs. Massa was unperturbed. Although that day was the
traditional start of the Christmas shopping season, it has never
been a big day at her store.
   Business picked up over the following weekend, but sales have
ebbed and flowed since then _ along with Mrs. Massa's outlook.
   When volume picked up several days into December, she was pleased
but realistic: ``It's nothing like it should be.''
   Like most other stores across the country, Osidi has had to lower
its expectations because of the nearly 2-year-old slump in retail
spending. Mrs. Massa, who has been a clothing retailer or
manufacturer for more than 20 years, said the 14 months since
October 1987 have been the worst retail season she's seen.
   She remembers painfully well Oct. 19 of last year _ the day of
the stock market crash. Osidi took in $30 in sales.
   Since then, her business has changed drastically. Some of Osidi's
customers _ who included stockbrokers _ lost their jobs. Others
became very wary _ ``they think twice,'' is the way Mrs. Massa puts
it.
   ``That customer's not there any longer,'' she said of the women
who used to spend freely.
   These days, she says, it is her regular customers who ``thank God
keep me in business.''
   She knows she's not alone, that other retailers have had the same
troubles over the past year. And she's heard via the merchant
grapevine that their Christmas season is going slowly.
   ``My suppliers say everyone's crying,'' she said.
   Mrs. Massa went into the last two weeks of the season complaining
that no one seemed to be in the Christmas spirit, yet she still
expected things to turn out all right, if not great.
   ``Normally, we're a late store,'' she said, explaining that the
bulk of her Christmas business comes in the final week, from
last-minute shoppers and people who couldn't find what they wanted
anywhere else or who couldn't contend with the uptown crowds.
   On the very last day of the season, Christmas Eve, she expects to
see mostly men buying a lot of jewelry.
   Will she be satisfied at the end, if and when those eleventh-hour
shoppers come through?
   No. ``The numbers just aren't there,'' she said, and added, ``No
matter what you do, people aren't going to spend money.''

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ With the make-it or break-it season in full swing
for the nation's retailers, The Associated Press takes an inside
look at how two stores are handling the holiday rush in side-by-side
stories from New York City and Grand Rapids, Mich.

   Back in February, just weeks after
holiday decorations were taken down, Lazarus department store
executives began designing ``the look'' for Christmas 1988: seahorse
planters surrounded by a red-and-gold decor.
   Now, 10 months later, there's anxious optimism that the perpetual
planning for the holiday season has helped shoppers get into the
spending mood and will translate into another color: green.
   ``We're way ahead of last year and I'm exceeding expectations for
this year,'' says a beaming Jean Hougard, manager for Michigan's two
Lazarus stores in downtown Grand Rapids and the suburb of Wyoming.
   And for retailers, those are the magic words.
   In the month between Thanksgiving and Christmas, many retailers
make about half their annual profit. And to make the most of the
profit potential, department store chains such as Cincinnati-based
Lazarus are thinking Christmas almost year-round.
   ``The planning begins in February _ the promotional calendar, the
merchandise we expect to introduce, how the stores are going to
look,'' says Jerry Gafford, senior vice president of corporate
affairs for Lazarus, which operates 43 stores in Ohio, Indiana,
Michigan, Kentucky and West Virginia.
   When the stores get the planning diagrams, merchandise schedules
and props from corporate headquarters, they make adjustments for
their individuals stores and begin the physical transition about two
months before Thanksgiving.
   ``I spend about a week on 12-foot ladders,'' says Jane Mauchmar,
visuals manager for both stores.
   Mauchmar figures she's trimmed nearly 100 trees, hung scores of
9-foot lengths of garland along with countless ``For Someone
Special'' signs from the ceiling, positioned thousands of
poinsettias and set up numerous special displays, many of which she
guesses ultimately will be altered by rambunctious youngsters. She's
worked many 11-hour days and six-day weeks to prepare.
   It's also up to Mauchmer to make those stacks of heated ice
scrapers for car windshields and golf ball monogrammers reach out
and grab the shopper's attention.
   ``It's my job to make that gift look appealing, to make it look
irresistible,'' she says with an exhausted laugh.
   Weather plays an important part, too. Hougard was happy with the
warmer-than-normal temperatures and sunny skies on the day after
Thanksgiving, traditionally the busiest shopping day of the year.
But she was even happier when it snowed Dec. 12, less than two weeks
before the holiday.
   ``People feel like shopping for Christmas presents when it looks
like Christmas outside,'' she says.
   Mood is important not just for the customers, but for employees
as well. At a recent meeting, the chain's top corporate executives
and the 42 store managers dressed up in Santa Claus beards and hats
for a group photograph.
   Though the hours are longer and the work more tiring, nearly
every level of Lazarus employee says the brisk business is uplifting.
   ``Everyone's spirits are high. When it's busy like this, the days
just fly by,'' said Ruth Alman, a sales manager in the Wyoming store.
   The mood in both stores is in sharp contrast to the past 2{
years, when employees were uncertain about their futures and
head-spinning takeovers became a topic of everyday conversation.
   The two stores used to be known as Herpolscheimer's, a
117-year-old fixture that was part of Allied Stores Corp. But in
December 1986, Allied was acquired in a hostile takeover by Campeau
Corp.
   The following month, the two Grand Rapids-area stores were
incorporated into Block's, a sister Allied division that was sold to
Federated Department Stores Inc. in April 1987.
   Federated, which owned the Lazarus chain, changed the Block's
name to Lazarus, and in November 1987, the Herpolscheimer's signs
came down and the bronze-and-white Lazarus signs went up.
   But the stores, which were changed from ``home'' stores with
houseware departments to apparel-and-cosmetics only, were far from
ready for the Christmas season.
   ``People didn't know who we were, stock levels were poor and we
didn't have the right merchandise,'' Hougard said. ``It took some
time for us to build up our reputation _ and get `Lazarized.'''
   The changes were traumatic, but they weren't over. In May 1988,
Campeau bought Federated and its department store chains, including
Lazarus.
   This year, there is upgraded merchandise, plenty of stock _ and
customers are responding. There are also plenty of incentives,
including such giveaways as a free stuffed teddy bear that other
department stores sell for up to $17.50 with a purchase.
   ``I see people walking in with gift lists and walking out with
bags galore,'' said Ann VanKoevering, a sales supervisor in the
downtown store. ``It's a challenge to keep the stock out.''
   What are they buying? Such non-necessities as silk men's pajamas
and boxer shorts at $24 a piece, Victorian-style lingerie, and
adult-style fashions for children.
   ``Instead of things they need, like warm socks and coats, they're
buying holiday sweaters with holly leaves,'' VanKoevering said. ``I
haven't seen that before and I think it's a good sign.''

   The stock market declined slightly today in an
unenthusiastic response to the latest news on international trade.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials dropped 3.91 to 2,139.58
by 11 a.m. on Wall Street.
   Losers narrowly outnumbered gainers in nationwide trading of New
York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 540 up, 586 down and 580
unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 41.01 million shares at
midmorning.
   Before the opening the Commerce Department reported that the
nation's trade deficit in October came in at $10.35 billion, down
from a revised $10.67 billion in September and a shade below advance
estimates on Wall Street.
   But analysts said the difference between expectations and the
actual number wasn't great enough to stir up any significant
interest in stocks.
   In addition, they said, traders seemed concerned over separate
evidence of continued strength in the economy, which might help
induce the Federal Reserve to tighten credit further.
   Industrial production rose 0.5 percent in November, and the
industry operating rate rose to 84.2 percent of capacity, a
nine-year high.
   First Fidelity Bancorp tumbled 8\ to 27\. The company said late
Tuesday that it will report a loss of $145 million to $190 million
for the fourth quarter arising from some problem loans.
   Caesars World jumped 4[ to 29]. Donald Trump, the real estate
developer and investor, asked for regulatory approval to buy 15

<HEAD>Costs for Health Care Rising for Automakers</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: repeat for all needing.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. automakers said they would spend more than
$4.7 billion this year insuring the health of their employees.
   Officials of General Motors Corp., Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler
Corp. say rising health care costs and use of insurance plans have
pushed up health-care spending in 1988.
   ``It's the system in general, costs are escalating on all
sides,'' Ford spokeswoman Linda Becker said. ``It's not just coming
from the auto companies.''
   Becker estimated that Ford would pay out more than $1 billion for
health care in 1988, up from the $920 million it paid in 1987.
   GM spokeswoman Patricia Molloy declined to estimate how much the
No. 1 automaker would spend in health care, but said there is a
trend toward increasing costs. GM spent $2.9 billion on health care
last year.
   She said the price of the insurance and utilization of it led to
the upward trend in costs.
   Chrysler's Lloyd Northard said comparing 1987 and 1988 costs was
difficult because Chrysler acquired American Motors Corp. in August
1987.
   Nevertheless, he said such costs were rising about 15 percent
annually, and Chrysler estimated it would spend more than $700
million for employee health care this year.

<HEAD>Yeutter Predicts U.S. Will Prevail On Agriculture Issue</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RUTH SINAI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United States will prevail in its fight
with Europe over agricultural subsidies because its position is ``on
the side of the angels,'' U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter
said Wednesday.
   Yeutter, who is being considered for the post of Agriculture
Secretary in the Bush administration, also said the United States
will retaliate against the European Economic Community if it
implements a Jan. 1 ban on importing hormone-treated meat.
   The United States has already decided it will strike against some
European imports, Yeutter told the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, ``and
that decision stands.''
   He said the United States has not found any evidence that
hormone-treated animals endanger consumers' health, ``and therefore
this is an illegal trade barrier.'' The ball is now in Europe's
court ``and time is getting short,'' he said.
   The 12-nation EEC said last week it intends to implement the ban,
which had already been put off for one year at the request of the
United States. The measure would affect some $170 million worth of
U.S. meat.
   One possible compromise offered by the EEC would exempt meat
which is used for pet food and which accounts for about 50 percent
of the imports. EEC officials have said the Americans rejected that
solution because they are determined to hold out for all or nothing
as a matter of principle.
   Prospects for a compromise appeared to dim last week as relations
between the two trading giants soured over an unrelated dispute
about government support for farmers.
   The impasse blocked other progress at an international trade
meeting of 100 nations in Montreal and left residues of bitterness
on both sides of the Atlantic. To avert collapse of the Montreal
meeting, which was a mid-term review of the four-year Uruguay Round
of trade negotiations, participants agreed to meet again in the
first week of April in Geneva.
   ``Let's hope reason will prevail'' in Geneva, Yeutter said. If
the agriculture issue is not solved, he warned, ``there's obviously
jeopardy to the entire Uruguay Round.''
   The controversy stems from a U.S. demand that all members of the
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) abolish their farm
supports which distort trade on the world market. The EEC, under
strong pressure from its large rural population, advocates reduction
in subsidies but not elimination.
   ``We're on the side of the angels on this issue,'' Yeutter said,
``and everyone, including our European allies, knows this.''
   The United States contends that elimination of farm supports will
lower government expenditure and ease the burden on consumers and
taxpayers around the world.
   Yeutter predicted political pressure on the Europeans would mount
between now and April, ``and political pressure can generate
political will'' to change positions. The pressure is expected to
come from agricultural exporters such as Argentina and Australia,
whose farmers are having trouble competing against the subsidized
European and American farm exports.

   Grain and soybean futures opened narrowly mixed
today on the Chicago Board of Trade with little fresh news in the
markets to influence prices.
   The quiet opening in the corn and wheat pits suggested traders
were still holding to expectations for large-scale export sales of
U.S. grain to the Soviet Union, analysts said.
   Reports of a pickup in soybean meal exports last week lent some
support to the soybean complex but buying interest was limited by a
change to wetter weather in the South American soybean belt, where
planting continues.
   ``We saw some reasonably good shower activity in Brazil yesterday
and over the next few days it looks like scattered light showers,''
said Dale Gustafson, a grain-market analyst with Drexel Burnham
Lambert Inc. in Chicago. ``That's keeping the market from getting
too strong here at the moment.''
   In early trading, wheat was unchanged to 1 cent higher with the
contract for delivery in December at $4.27 a bushel; corn was
unchanged to 1 cent lower with December at $2.65 a bushel; oats were
unchanged across the board with March at $2.20{ a bushel; soybeans
were unchanged to 2 cents higher with January at $7.65{ a bushel.
   Cattle futures were slightly higher while pork futures were mixed
in early trading on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Live cattle were .20 cent to .35 cent higher with Decem  The so-called
Montgomery Amendment was passed by Congress after
governors in some states began objecting _ and blocking _ deployment
of their National Guard units on training assignments to Central
America.
   Rep. G.V. ``Sonny'' Montgomery, D-Miss., who wrote the provision,
last week condemned the 8th Circuit ruling.
   ``If 50 governors are allowed to veto Guard missions because they
don't like the way our foreign policy is administered, it would have
an adverse impact on training and would raise questions about the
availability of the Guard to meet its considerable defense
responsibilities,'' he said.
   Pending the results of any appeal, the only states affected by
the ruling at those in the 8th Circuit: Arkansas, Iowa, Minnesota,
Missouri, Nebraska, North Dakota and South Dakota.

   Ford Motor Co. would support a phased-in
15-cent per gallon gasoline tax but only if other deficit reduction
measures fail, Vice Chairman Harold Poling said today.
   Poling said he wants to see President-elect George Bush's deficit
reduction plan before supporting a gasoline tax increase.
   ``As a part of a revenue-raising package, we would approve an
increase in the gasoline tax phased in over three to four years,
say, a nickel a year,'' Poling said.
   He also suggested a tax credit for low-income families to help
offset the effects of higher gasoline costs. He said a phased-in
approach could minimize effects on the automobile industry.
   On other matters, Poling said:
   _Ford is discussing a plan to produce its West German-made
Scorpio cars in the Soviet Union. He said details of the proposal
still are in the works.
   ``I think they're interested in a vehicle with the size and
performance characteristics of the Scorpio,'' Poling said, adding
the vehicle would be made at an existing plant near Gorky or at a
new plant probably in the Gorky area.
   _Talks on acquiring financially troubled savings and loan
institutions are continuing. The company would like to see decisions
on such acquisitions made before Jan. 1, when some tax benefits now
in effect would expire.
   Ford subsidiary 1st Nationwide Bank is the sixth-largest savings
and loan in the country. Poling said acquisitions now being
discussed could push Ford into ownership of the No. 1-ranked savings
and loan.
   _That 1988 should be the second-best sales year in automotive
history. Poling estimated that by year's end 15.6 million to 15.7
millions cars and light trucks be sold in the United States.
   Sales in 1989, he added, would be slightly lower, probably in the
15.4 million-vehicle range.

   Tenneco Inc. announced today it is reorganizing
its corporate office following the sale of Tenneco Oil Co. and the
retirement and resignation of two top executives.
   John P. Diesel, Tenneco Inc. president, elected to take early
retirement at age 62 and Joe B. Foster, 54, executive vice
president, resigned to pursue other interests, a company statement
said. Both also will resign from the Tenneco Board of Directors.
   Their resignations are effective Dec. 31.
   The corporate office now will be comprised of James L. Ketelsen,
58, chairman of the board and chief executive officer; Kenneth W.
Reese, 58, executive vice president and member of the board and
Allen T. McInnes, 51, executive vice president.
   ``The corporate office will continue to provide direction,
financial guidance and management assistance to help Tenneco's
industrial businesses maintain and further their industry leadership
positions,'' Ketelsen said. ``We will continue our policy of
allowing divisional companies substantial autonomy in the conduct of
their day-to-day operations.''
   In October, Houston-based Tenneco announced it had sold Tenneco
Oil Co. _ which had made up 22 percent of the corporation's total
revenue _ for about $7.3 billion to several buyers.
   Tenneco is a diversified industrial corporation with major
business interests in natural gas pipelines, farm and construction
equipment, automotive parts, shipbuilding, packaging, chemicals and
minerals.

and 800 services, by an average of 3.6 percent on Jan. 5.
   The nation's third-largest long-distance carrier announced last
month that it will lower its basic interstate residential and
business rates on Jan. 1 by an average of 3.8 percent.
   The reductions reflect lower costs for connecting to the local
phone network. US Sprint's two larger rivals, American Telephone &
Telegraph Co. and MCI Communications Corp., recently announced price
cuts of 3.8 percent and 3.9 percent, respectively.
   US Sprint said the business products rate cut applies to Dial 1
WATS, Sprint Advanced WATS Plus, Sprint Advanced WATS, Banded WATS,
Ultra WATS, Virtual Private Network, Direct 800 and Ultra 800
services.

<HEAD>Trump Indicates He May Seek Control Of Caesars</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Developer Donald Trump has notified
the federal government that he wants to buy 15 percent or more of
Caesars World Inc. stock and that he may seek controlling interest,
the hotel and casino company says.
   In a statement issued late Tuesday, Caesars officials said they
were notified that Trump has asked the government for a ruling on
whether his investment in Caesars would violate federal antitrust
laws.
   The disclosure sent Caesars' common stock sharply higher today.
In midday trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Caesars was up $4
a share to $29.25.
   But gaming analysts said Trump, who already owns two casinos in
Atlantic City and is building a third, would face regulatory
obstacles to a move on Caesars in both Nevada, where Caesars is
based, and New Jersey, which prohibits single ownership of no more
than three casinos.
   The Los Angeles-based Caesars owns the highly profitable Caesars
Hotel Casino here and the Caesars Palace and Caesars Tahoe casino
hotels in Nevada.
   Neither Trump's filing nor Caesars' statement indicated how much
Caesars stock Trump may already own. Tuesday's filing was made under
the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act, which requires companies or individuals
to seek such a ruling once they have acquired $15 million worth of
stock in a company.
   At Tuesday's closing price of $25.25 per share, that would
translate to about 590,000 shares, or about 2.4 percent of Caesar's
24.5 million common shares outstanding.
   Susan Heilbron, executive vice president of the Turmp
Organization, said Trump had no comment on the filing other than to
confirm that it was made. She declined to say how much Caesars'
stock, if any, Trump already owns.
   According to the Caesars' statement, Trump indicated he ``has the
good faith intention, subject to price, availability and necessary
approvals, if any,'' to acquire 15 percent of Caesar's stock.
   Trump's filing also said he ``may decide to seek control of
(Caesars) through the acquisition of 50 percent (or) more of the
outstanding voting securities.''
   ``Due to the confusing content of this notice, (Caesars) is
unable to ascertain Mr. Trump's plans at this time and has no
further comment,'' the company said in its release.
   One gaming analyst, Marvin Roffman of Janney Montgomery Scott
Inc. in Philadelphia, said he doubts that Trump is serious about
making a move to acquire Caesars, and said any such move would face
serious regulatory opposition in New Jersey and Nevada.
   ``The gaming board in Nevada has come out and said it does not
particularly relish hostile takeovers, and I can tell you that this
would be a hostile takeover because the company will vigorously
defend its independence,'' he said.
   New Jersey gaming regulators have also strongly opposed hostile
takeovers of casino companies.
   Trump now owns Trump Plaza and Trump Castle casino hotels in
Atlantic City and is building the massive Taj Mahal casino hotel,
which should be complete in 15 months.

<HEAD>Australian Company to Buy Second Texas Specialty Retailer</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In its second rescue of a troubled Texas retailer,
an Australian property and retail company has signed a letter of
intent to buy the Frost Bros. chain for an undisclosed sum.
   Hooker Corp. Ltd. bought 80 percent of the Houston-based Sakowitz
Inc. in November 1987, bringing it out of bankruptcy. Robert T.
Sakowitz, the chain's chairman and a member of its founding family,
held the remaining 20 percent.
   On Tuesday, Hooker announced that L.J. Hooker Group, its wholly
owned subsidiary, would fold the San Antonio-based Frost chain into
Sakowitz, operate all the stores under the Sakowitz name and put
Robert Sakowitz in charge of the combined operation.
   Both chains are high-priced merchandisers catering to wealthy
customers and emphasizing upscale women's apparel. Both also operate
four stores. All the Sakowitz outlets are in Houston, while Frost's
are in Houston, San Antonio and Austin.
   In a prepared statement, Hooker Executive Chairman George Herscu
said, ``The proposed expansion of Sakowitz Inc. is a rare
opportunity to bring together two of the finest names in Texas
specialty retailing targeted to the upscale and quality-conscious
customer.''
   Frost Bros. filed for protection from its creditors under Chapter
11 of federal bankruptcy laws in New York in April. The financially
troubled retailer had gone public in an effort to improve its
financial picture, but that plan fell through with the stock market
crash of Oct. 19, 1987.
   Sam Wyly and his wife, Torie Steele Wyly, of Dallas, had bought
the chain from Manhatten Industries of New York for an estimated $50
million in August 1986, and Wyly said at the time he would
concentrate on the ``Mercedes Benz niche'' in retailing.
   Between the purchase date and the bankruptcy filing, the number
of stores was cut from 13 to nine. More stores were closed after
filing, including two in Houston _ at the Galleria and Memorial City
shopping centers. Frost continues to operate its third Houston store
near the exclusive River Oaks neighborhood.
   The company had 1985 revenue of $120 million. More recent figures
were not available.
   Hooker, based in Sydney, Australia, is an aggressive buyer of
U.S. retailers and a real estate developer in the United States and
Australia.
   It bought 80 percent of Sakowitz in 1987 for $7.5 million under
an amended plan of reorganization filed in federal bankruptcy court.
   Sakowitz was the nation's last remaining high-fashion speciality
retailer controlled by a founding family member. It filed for
Chapter 11 reorganization protection in the wake of financial
troubles stemming partly from the economic slump in the Southwest.
   At the time of the filing in 1985, Sakowitz had 17 stores and six
boutiques in Texas, Oklahoma and Arkansas, a number of which since
have been sold.
   Other Hooker Corp. holdings include B. Altman and Co., the New
York-based department store chain which it acquired in October 1987
for an undisclosed price, and Parisian Inc., the Birmingham, Ala.,
specialty retailer which it acquired along with Parisian's major
shareholders in September 1987 in a $252 million buyout.
   Hooker also is developing four regional shopping malls in the
United States, averaging 1.5 million square feet each.

<NOTE>Eds: Subs 4th graf pvs, ``I think, to restore dropped word

<TEXT>
   The U.S. trade deficit narrowed to $10.35
billion in October, the smallest imbalance in three months, the
government reported today.
   The Commerce Department said that the merchandise trade gap
between what the United States imports and what it sells overseas
fell by 3.1 percent from a September deficit of $10.67 billion.
   The decline represented the second consecutive monthly
improvement. But many analysts were unimpressed, saying after
monthly fluctuations, the deficit has been essentially flat for
several months.
   ``I think the improvement in the trade deficit has stalled out,''
said Allen Sinai, chief economist of the Boston Co. ``We still have
a very heavy flow of imported goods, especially on the manufacturing
side.''
   The Reagan administration was more optimistic. Commerce Secretary
C. William Verity cited the progress made so far, noting that
exports have climbed by 28 percent over the past 10 months.
   ``While the trend continues to be favorable, our trade deficit is
still very large. Eliminating it, which is our goal, poses a major
challenge,'' Verity said in a statement.
   Financial markets, which in the past have reacted violently to
disappointing trade figures, for the most part shrugged off today's
report. The Dow Jones industrial average had fallen by about 5
points shortly before midday.
   In a separate report, the Federal Reserve Board said that the
operating rate at U.S. factories, mines and utilities rose 0.2
percentage point last month to 84.2 percent, its highest level in
nine years.
   That report, which was in line with economists' predictions, is
likely to intensify cononcern about inflation. As capacity use edges
toward 85 percent, economists fear factories will have trouble
producing enough goods to meet demand, leading to shortages and
price increases.
   The October trade improvement came from a 1.7 percent drop in
imports, which declined to $38.02 billion, on a seasonally adjusted
basis.
   This decline offset a smaller 1.1 percent drop in U.S. exports,
which edged down to $27.67 billion.
   Even with the small setback in exports, U.S. overseas sales
remained near record high levels. For the first 10 months of this
year, export sales are running 28.3 percent above the same period in
1987.
   This remarkable surge in export sales has been responsible for
almost half of America's overall economic growth this year as
American manufacturers have hired workers and stepped up output to
meet demand.
   Through October, the overall merchendise trade deficit has been
running at an annual rate of $136.1 billion, 20 percent below the
all-time high imbalance of $170.3 billion recorded last year.
   President-elect Bush cited this improvement during the
presidential campaign as proof that the Reagan administration's
policies of solving the country's trade woes were working.
   The administration launched an effort in September 1985 to drive
the value of the dollar lower to make American goods more
competitive on overseas markets while driving up the price of
imports.
   The effort took far longer to bear fruit than many had expected
and has to this day failed to halt the steady increase in imports,
which are running 8.3 percent higher so far this year over 1987.
   The $10.35 billion October deficit was the lowest since a $9.47
billion July imbalance. That had been the smallest deficit since
December 1984.
   The trade report, U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter said,
was ``good news on which to close out 1988. He added that the
deficit was now falling ``at a satisfactory pace.''
   Today's good news on trade followed a report Tuesday showing that
the deficit in the broadest measure of trade, the current account,
fell to $30.89 billion in the July-September quarter, the lowest
level in three years.
   The current account method adds the value of investments and
services to the value of goods reflected in today's report.
   Many economists are worried that despite the dramatic declines in
the trade deficit this year, the improvement is in danger of
stalling next year, a development that could push the country into a
recession.
   Some economists contend that the dollar must fall further to make
U.S. goods even more competitive and dampen Americans' appetite for
imports. Other analysts are urging the Bush administrative to waste
no time in launching an aggressive effort to open more foreign
markets to American products.
   The October report is likely to provide ammunition to these
critics because of a 34.1 percent jump in the trade deficit with
Japan. The trade imbalance with Japan, the largest with any country,
surged to $5.5 billion in October, the highest it has been in a year.
   The deficit with Taiwan was unchanged at $1.4 billion while the
deficit with Western Europe rose to $1.1 billion, $200 million
higher than in October.
   The deficits with individual countries are not adjusted to take
into account normal monthly variations in trade flows. Before the
seasonal adjustment, the overall deficit would have been $11.75
billion, reflecting the fact that October is a big import month as
retailers stock up for the Christmas season.

   The stock market lost ground today in a listless
response to the latest news on international trade.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials dropped 10.84 to 2,132.65
by 2 p.m. on Wall Street.
   Losers outnumbered gainers by about 4 to 3 in nationwide trading
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 557 up, 749 down and
586 unchanged.
   Before the opening the Commerce Department reported that the
nation's trade deficit in October came in at $10.35 billion, down
from a revised $10.67 billion in September and a shade below advance
estimates on Wall Street.
   But analysts said the difference between expectations and the
actual number wasn't great enough to stir up any significant
interest in stocks.
   In addition, they said, traders seemed concerned over separate
evidence of continued strength in the economy, which might help
induce the Federal Reserve to tighten credit further.
   Industrial production rose 0.5 percent in November, and the
industry operating rate rose to 84.2 percent of capacity, a
nine-year high.
   First Fidelity Bancorp tumbled 7~ to 27|. The company said late

   Share prices closed higher Wednesday after a late
flurry of activity in the oil sector provided a boost in an
otherwise dull trading session.
   A few minutes before the market closed, British Petroleum Co.
confirmed it was negotiating the sale of part of its minerals
business to RTZ Corp. Then the market was swept by an unconfirmed
rumor that London and Scottish Marine Oil PLC had completed the
long-awaited sale of its 25.2 percent stake in Enterprise Oil PLC.
   Share prices of the companies involved moved sharply higher,
providing a brief flurry of activity at the end of a quiet session.
   The index spent most of the day in negative territory, as the
market concentrated on its previous concerns about recent increases
in U.K. interest rates.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index rose 3.5
points, or 0.2 percent, to close at 1,756.1. At its low, the index
was down 10.9 points from Tuesday's close.
   Volume was a modest 447.1 million shares, up from 473.9 million

   The dollar fell Wednesday against all major
currencies in Europe after the U.S. government reported that the
nation's October trade deficit was only slightly narrower than
market forecasts.
   Gold prices fell in Zurich but were unchanged in London.
   Although the trade deficit narrowed to $10.35 billion in October
from $10.67 billion in September, the Commerce Department
announcement sparked a slight dollar sell-off, dealers said.
   ``The figures were actually quite good, but no one wants to buy
dollars,'' said a dealer at a large bank in Frankfurt, West Germany.
   In London, the British pound rose to $1.8335 from $1.8280 late
Tuesday.
   In Tokyo, where trading finished before the report was released,
the dollar rose 0.29 Japanese yen to a closing 123.35 yen. But later
in London, the dollar dropped to 122.60 yen.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Tuesday's
rate, included: 1.7365 West German marks, down from 1.7410; 1.4630
Swiss francs, down from 1.4705; 5.9350 French francs, down from
5.9775; 1.9590 Dutch guilders, down from 1.9715; 1,279.50 Italian
lire, down from 1,286.50; and 1.1986 Canadian dollars, down from
1.1995.
   Gold prices moved in a narrow range in light European trading.
   In Zurich, gold fell to a late bid of $420 a troy ounce from
$420.45 late Tuesday. In London, gold was quoted at a late bid of
$420.75 an ounce, unchanged from Tuesday's late bid.
   Earlier in Hong Kong, gold fell 16 cents to close at a bid of
$421.38 an ounce.
   Silver bullion dropped in London to a late bid of $6.16 a troy
ounce from $6.17 late Tuesday.

<TEXT>
   Dow Jones & Co. Inc., the publisher of the Wall
Street Journal, said Wednesday it expects its profit for 1988 will
be up 11 percent to 14 percent from last year due principally to
non-recurring gains.
   But Warren H. Phillips, Dow Jones chairman and chief executive
officer, said that if nonrecurring items were excluded, the
company's earnings would be down 6 percent to 10 percent from a year
earlier.
   He said the decline reflected year-long softness in financial
advertising linage and revenue at its business publications in the
wake of the October 1987 stock market crash.
   In remarks prepared for delivery to securities analysts, Phillips
said he expected the company would earn between $226 million, or
$2.33 a share, and $232 million, or $2.39 a share, this year.
   In 1987, Dow Jones earned $203 million, or $2.10 a share, on
revenue of $1.31 billion.
   The company expects nonrecurring gains of $68 million, or 70
cents a share, this year compared with $29.4 million, or 30 cents a
share, a year earlier.
   Excluding those gains, Phillips said Dow Jones' earnings for the
year would have fallen to between $158 million, or $1.63 a share,
and $164 million, or $1.69 a share.
   ``Dow Jones was affected more than most publishing comapnies by
the carnage in the financial community and among the investing
public that followed last year's market crash,'' he said.
   Phillips said he expects improved results at all of Dow Jones'
operations next year, ``barring a major recession.''
   In addition to the Journal, Dow Jones publishes Barron's
magazine, National Business Employment Weekly and American
Demographics magazine and offers Dow Jones News-Retrieval, a
computerized business and financial information service.
   It also owns Ottaway Newspapers Inc., which publishes daily
newspapers in 23 communities, and has a 67 percent stake in Telerate
Inc., a supplier of computerized financial information.

   Soybean futures closed sharply higher Wednesday on
the Chicago Board of Trade, in line with a strong late rally in
soybean meal linked to speculation about increased export sales,
analysts said.
   Corn prices also closed higher while wheat futures finished
narrowly mixed.
   Soybean meal traders noted recent purchases of U.S. meal by
Venezuela, ``and there were rumors of Soviet interest as well, and
that seemed to be the driving force,'' said Dale Gustafson, a
grain-market analyst with Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. in Chicago.
   ``The strength in meal allowed the beans to rally and was
successful in bringing up (soybean) oil as well,'' he said.
   Meal for delivery in January closed $5.10 higher at $250.20 per
metric ton; soybeans gained as much as 14} cents a bushel.
   Corn also was supported by rumors of Soviet buying interest but
wheat trading was light amid a lack of fresh news affecting that
market.
   At the close, wheat was 1 cent lower to { cent higher with the
contract for delivery in December at $4.26{ a bushel; corn was 1{
cents to 4{ cents higher with December at $2.66} a bushel; oats were

<HEAD>BP in Talks To Sell Minerals Operations to RTZ</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   British Petroleum Co. PLC said Wednesday it is
negotiating to sell its minerals operations to RTZ Corp. PLC, a deal
that analysts said could generate $3 billion to $4 billion for BP.
   BP said the talks were exclusively with RTZ, a British mining
company with interests worldwide, and exclude any minerals
businesses of BP Canada.
   Rumors of the talks have circulated for the last week and have
helped drive British Petroleum's shares up and RTZ's down.
   British Petroleum did not elaborate on the statement except to
say that a further announcement will be made in due course.
   Its minerals interests include activities in gold, silver, copper
and uranium mines in the United States, Australia, Papua New Guinea,
Mexico and South Africa.
   British Petroleum has considered selling off its gold operations
for some time. In September, it postponed indefinitely the pricing
date for an initial public offering of about 15 percent of the gold
subsidiary.
   As speculation about the talks mounted last week, some analysts
said British Petroleum would use the proceeds of the sale to buy
into existing businesses, possibly even including a bid for Unocal
Corp. of the United States.
   Other analysts noted that it could use the cash earned either to
reduce debt or buy back shares held by the Kuwait Investment Office.
The Kuwaiti government body currently owns 21.68 percent of British
Petroleum and has been told by the British government to reduce its
holding to 9.9 percent, within a provisional timetable of a year.
   The money could give British Petroleum flexibility in bargaining
with Kuwait over a sale price for some of the 700 million shares,
which at current market prices have a total value of about 1.8
billion pounds _ equaling about $3.3 billion at current exchange
rates.
   British Petroleum shares closed Wednesday at the equivalent of
$4.74 a share, up 11 cents. RTZ's shares fell 11 cents to finish at
$7.01 a share.
   Analysts said it could take weeks to complete negotiations over
the sale of the minerals businesses.

<TEXT>
   The board of Montedison on Wednesday approved
a joint venture with Italy's state-owned Enichem to create a
chemical company that is among the 10 largest in the world, with
annual sales equaling about $10 billion.
   The approval was the final hurdle for creating the new company,
Enimont, which is scheduled to begin operations Jan. 1.
   Montedison Chairman Raul Gardini told a news conference that
Enimont will have an initial six-month transitory regime that could
be phased out earlier if Parliament approves a legislation designed
to give Montedison a major tax break.
   Enichem, the chemical unit of Italy's energy group Ente Nazionale
Idrocarburi (ENI), and Montedison each will own 40 percent of
Enimont. The balance will be held privately.
   The merger of Montedison's bulk chemical interests with Enichem
into Enimont will play a key role in cutting Montedison's level of
consolidated debt. The private group, which is 42 percent owned by
Feruzzi Finanziaria of the Ferruzzi family, will transfer around
$2.9 billion of its debt to Enimont.
   At the same time, the proposed new tax legislation will cut to
$288 million the amount owed in taxes for the joint venture. Under
the present law Montedison would owe as much as $1.1 billion.

   Stock prices fell in light trading today in a
listless response to the latest news on international trade.
   Before the opening the Commerce Department reported that the
nation's trade deficit in October came in at $10.35 billion, down
from a revised $10.67 billion in September and a shade below advance
estimates on Wall Street.
   But analysts said the difference between expectations and the
actual number wasn't great enough to stir up any significant
interest in stocks.

evidence of continued strength in the economy, which might help

<HEAD>General Mills Second-Quarter Earnings Flat</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MINNEAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   General Mills Corp. on Wednesday reported its
second quarter net earnings were unchanged from a year earlier,
although sales edged higher during the period.
   The food and restaurant company posted a profit of $79.6 million,
or 97 cents a share. Earnings per share totaled 90 cents per share
in the year-earlier quarter because the average number of
outstanding shares was higher, the company said.
   Sales during the three months ended Nov. 27 rose to $1.4 billion
from $1.3 billion in the same period last year.
   For the first six months of fiscal 1988, including results from
discontinued operations, General Mills posted net earnings of $369.5
million, or $4.50 a share, compared with $156.8 million, or $1.77 a
share, in the first 26 weeks of fiscal 1987.
   Results from continuing operations for the first six months of
the year were $170.4 million, or $2.07 a share, compared with $155.1
million, or $1.75 a share, for the same period a year ago.
   Sales for the first six months increased to $2.79 billion from
$2.54 billion.
   Sales and operating profits from consumer foods grew 4 percent in
the second quarter, with breakfast cereals gaining market share in a
total market that grew 5 percent in volume, Chairman Bruce Atwater
said.
   Established Red Lobster restaurants posted an 8 percent increase
in unit sales in the second quarter. The company added 12 new Red
Lobsters converted from the 27-unit chain of Seafood Broiler
restaurants that it acquired in California.

<HEAD>First Fidelity Stocks Plummet In Wake Of Fourth-Quarter Loss
Announcement</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEWARK, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   First Fidelity Bancorp.'s stock plummeted
Wednesday following the resignation of two top executives and an
announcement that the big bank holding company expected a huge loss
in the fourth quarter.
   The company announced the departure of Harold W. Pote, its highly
regarded president and chief executive officer, and Bernard J.
Morgan, a vice chairman and chief executive of Fidelity Bank in
Philadelphia, late Tuesday.
   It also said it had fired Jean-Pierre Galy, a Fidelity Bank
executive vice president and head of its international department,
based in London.
   Robert R. Ferguson Jr., First Fidelity's chairman, will assume
Pote's duties.
   At the same time Tuesday, the company said it expected to lose
between $145 million and $190 million in the fourth quarter due to
problem loans. The company earned about $210 million, or $3.62 per
share, for the first nine months of 1988.
   Ferguson sought to reassure investors and customers after the
double-dose of negative news by issuing a statement promising, ``Our
business and that of our constituent institutions is sound.
   ``We have one of the finest banking franchises in the country and
within a short period of time our operating results will reflect
that.''
   But investors were wary nonetheless Wednesday.
   In closing trading Wednesday on the New York Stock Exchange,
First Fidelity's stock fell $8.50 per share to $27 in active trading.
   Gregg Novek, an analyst with Ryan, Beck & Co. of West Orange,
said the resignations ``have created a void in upper-level
management in the firm that people perceive as a real problem.''
   ``There's no way to prevent all the activity,'' Novek said of
Wednesday's trading. ``There are a lot of people who are looking at
this as a very good buy right now and a lot who are washing their
hands of the company.''
   The projected fourth-quarter loss was attributed to certain
commercial real estate loans and loans made to some international
commercial customers, said Fidelity spokesman Paul J. Levine.
   The losses in commercial and real estate projects were
concentrated among a small number of borrowers at Fidelity Bank, the
company's Philadelphia branch, with a large proportion of the
problem loans made to a single borrower, the company said.
   In its Wednesday editions, The Wall Street Journal identified the
borrower as Historic Landmarks for Living Inc., a major renovator
and syndicator of landmark buildings that is based in Philadelphia.
   Neither Historic Landmarks spokeswoman Deb Addis nor Levine would
comment on the report Wednesday.
   The Journal said the loans in question predated the $1.3 billion
merger completed in February 1988 of Newark-based First Fidelity
Inc. and Philadelphia-based Fidelcor Inc.
   The merger created one of the 20 largest bank holding companies
in the nation with assets of $30 billion.

<HEAD>Petroleum Imports Continued To Rise In November</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Petroleum imports rose sharply in November and
domestic crude oil production took its biggest monthly dip this
year, the American Petroleum Institute reported Wednesday.
   Imports jumped 14.1 percent to an average 7.95 million barrels a
day from 6.97 million barrels in November 1987, with imports of
gasoline and other refined products reaching their highest level
since 1974, according to API's Monthly Statistical Report.
   Daily domestic crude oil production fell 4.3 percent _ the
biggest decline this year _ to an average of 8.04 million barrels a
day, due mainly to a slowdown in output in the lower 48 states.
Alaska production remained steady at around 2 million barrels a day,
the report said.
   Analysts said strong demand in November continued to consume the
growing imports as total supplies of crude oil and refined products
declined 3.6 percent compared with the same time last year.
   The institute said lower world crude prices helped boost imports
for the first 11 months of 1988 to their highest level since 1980 as
the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries continued its
runaway production.
   However, OPEC members agreed last month to lower cartel
production in the first six months of 1989. World crude prices have
firmed slightly since the accord in anticipation of a cutback.
   In November, crude oil imports averaged 5.3 million barrels a
day, up 7.8 percent from November 1987, the report said.
   Product imports rose 29 percent to an average 2.7 million barrels
a day. Daily gasoline imports reached a new high of 630,000 barrels
for the month, up 80,000 barrels a day from a year ago. Distillate
and residual fuel oil imports also were strong.
   In the past three years, daily imports are up by 2.2 million
barrels, with increasing demand accounting for about two-thirds of
the increase and declining domestic production accounting for most
of the remainder, the API said.
   But despite high imports, total inventories fell by 5 million
barrels in November. API said inventories have fallen about 18
million barrels since July, or more than 50 million barrels after
accounting for seasonal factors.
   Combined deliveries surged more than 1.3 million barrels a day,
an 8.1 percent increase from the year-ago period.
   Gasoline deliveries rose 3.6 percent, or nearly 5 million
barrels, even as motorists began cutting back on travel. Gasoline
production rose 1.5 percent while gasoline stocks declined 6 million
barrels from last November.
   Distillate deliveries rose 7.3 percent despite continued mild
weather. Analysts said the rise probably reflected investors taking
advantage of weak prices.
   The report also said utilization of the nation's refineries
increased to 83.2 percent from 82.3 percent last November.

   The dollar retreated Wednesday, hurt by what
money dealers called rumors of a hike in West German interest rates
and a negative market reaction to the monthly U.S. trade report.
   Gold prices rose slightly in U.S. trading after easing marginally
abroad. Republic National Bank quoted bullion at $421 a troy ounce
as of 4 p.m. EST, up from $419.50 at the same time Tuesday.
   Foreign-exchange strategists said speculation that the West
German central bank would tighten domestic credit conditions on
Thursday raised demand for the West German mark and consequently
increased the supply of dollars in the market, pushing down the U.S.
currency's value.
   Pressure on the dollar intensified after the Commerce Department
said the U.S. merchandise trade deficit narrowed to $10.35 billion
in October from $10.67 billion the month before. Although the
shortfall was the smallest in three months, the market had
anticipated an imbalance of about $10.5 billion.
   ``The figures came out in line with expectations, and since
there's overriding bearish sentiment to the dollar, people just
resumed selling it,'' said Stuart Yannalfo, a trader at the New York
commodities futures firm Refco Inc. ``The only thing that could have
prevented it would have been a really good number, like $7 or $8
billion.''
   The monthly trade figures vary widely but have enormous potential
to affect the dollar's value because they are considered one of the
most visible indicators of U.S. competitiveness and economic
strength.
   A widening deficit suggests exports are weakening and the dollar
will fall, while a narrowing shortfall suggests exports are
strengthening and the dollar will rise.
   In Tokyo, where markets closed before the trade report was
released, the dollar rose 0.29 Japanese yen to 123.35 yen. Later in
London, the dollar dropped to 122.60 yen. By the time trading ended
in New York the dollar fetched 122.67 yen, down from 123.29 yen late
Tuesday.
   The British pound rose in London to $1.8335 from $1.8280 late
Tuesday. In New York sterling fetched $1.8295, up from $1.8190 late
Tuesday.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with rates late
Tuesday, included: 1.7374 West German marks, down from 1.7497;
1.4655 Swiss francs, down from 1.4717; 1.2020 Canadian dollars, up
from 1.1999; 5.9390 French francs, down from 5.9790; and 1,285.25
Italian lire, down from 1,288.71.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with rates late
Tuesday, included: 1.7365 marks, down from 1.7410; 1.4630 Swiss
francs, down from 1.4705; 5.9350 French francs, down from 5.9775;
1.9590 Dutch guilders, down from 1.9715; 1,279.50 Italian lire, down
from 1,286.50; and 1.1986 Canadian dollas, down from 1.1995.
   Gold prices moved in a narrow range. At the Commodity Exchange in
New York, gold for current delivery rose $1.70 a troy ounce to
$421.50. In London, gold fetched $420.75 an ounce, unchanged from
late Tuesday; in Zurich gold fell 45 cents to $420, and in Hong Kong
it fell 16 cents to $421.38.
   Silver bullion for current delivery rose 0.9 cent a troy ounce to
$6.177 on New York's Comex. In London, silver fell 1 cent to $6.16
an ounce.

<TEXT>
   Ford Motor Co. still is shopping for
financial industry acquisitions and hopes to land one before tax
breaks expire at year's end, Vice Chairman Harold Poling said
Wednesday.
   Poling said any acquisition, likely to be one or more savings and
loan institutions, could make Ford's wholly-owned subsidiary First
Nationwide Bank the nation's biggest savings bank. First Nationwide
now is the sixth-largest.
   First Nationwide in September failed in its bid to acquire
American Savings and Loan Association, of Stockton, Calif., the
nation's biggest insolvent thrift.
   The Federal Home Loan Bank Board instead provided $2 billion in
federal assistance to Robert M. Bass Group of Fort Worth, Texas to
acquire American in the largest government thrift rescue yet.
   ``We intend to continue to pursue diversification in the
financial services area,'' Poling said during an end-of-the-year
review with reporters. ``Our specific goal is to do a good job.
Becoming the largest isn't the objective. It's growth.''
   Poling also said it appears that 1988 will be the auto industry's
second-best sales year ever, with car and light truck sales at 15.6
million to 15.7 million. The industry record of 16.3 million in
sales was set in 1986.
   He said the 15.4 million estimate for the 1989 calendar year
would be ``down from this year, but still a good industry.''
   ``I'd be worried when our (market) share begins to run into
problems,'' he said. Ford's U.S. market share for cars is 21.7
percent, he said.
   During the meeting, Poling also said:
   _Buyer incentives would continue during the coming year, but ``I
don't see us leading the charge.'' He said Ford would remain
competitive when other automakers offer incentives.
   _Discussions are under way for assembly of a car, probably
modeled on Ford's West German-made Scorpio, in the Soviet Union. The
car probably would be made in an existing or new plant in the Gorky
area.
   Poling also said Ford's North American earnings likely will be
down from last year, resulting in smaller profit-sharing payments to
Ford employees early in 1989.
   Earlier this week, General Motors Corp. announced profit-sharing
payments of about $200 for each hourly and salaried worker, the
first time since 1985 that the nation's No. 1 automaker has made
such payments.
   ``I think it (Ford's profit-sharing payment) will be more than
$200,'' Poling said, smiling.
   Poling said a proposal for a 15-cent-per-gallon gasoline tax
increase should be considered by the incoming Bush administration
only if other deficit reduction measures, especially federal
spending cuts, prove unsuccessful.
   He said a 5-cent-a-year phase-in of such a tax increase would
soften the blow on the auto industry, and provisions such as tax
credits could be made for low-income taxpayers.

<HEAD>Sales Slump In Early December</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By FREDERICK STANDISH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sales of U.S.-made cars and light trucks fell 11
percent in early December compared with a burst of incentive-driven
sales in the same period a year ago, figures released Wednesday
showed.
   The companies said they sold an average of 29,610 vehicles during
each of the nine selling days in the Dec. 1-10 period this year,
compared with an average of 33,251 during the same period last year,
when there also were nine selling days.
   Car sales fell 10.5 percent and light truck sales dropped 11.7
percent in early December.
   Analysts said the declines weren't worrisome because of the
revival of incentives during the period last year.
   ``They started putting on some heavy-duty incentives'' in early
December last year, said analyst Kathleen Heaney of Nikko Securities
Co. International Inc. ``You've got a tough time to compare it
with.''
   Mary Ann Sudol of Fitch Investors agreed. ``That's hard to
read,'' she said. ``It's not surprising that they're down a little
bit, given that December is bad for auto sales anyway.
   ``In any (recent) 10-day period, you've had so much noise in the
period that it's hard to make a comparison,'' Sudol added. ``That
noise is incentives.''
   Both agreed that despite the early December slip, the industry is
healthy. As the calendar year draws to a close, the companies are
looking forward to what could be the second-best sales year in
history, behind the 16.3 million vehicles sold in 1986.
   For the year, sales by companies making cars and light trucks in
the United States have risen 6.9 percent in 1988 over 1987, going to
a daily rate of 37,949 this year compared with a daily rate of
35,499 last year.
   Among the Big Three, GM showed the largest early-December decline
in car sales, falling 12.9 percent to a daily rate of 8,906 cars in
1988 from 10,226 last year. GM's car sales were up 0.9 percent in
1988 over 1987 to a daily rate of 11,776 this year from 11,668 last
year.
   Ford's sales in early December fell 11.6 percent to a daily rate
of 5,582 this year compared with 6,316 in the same period last year.
But for the year, Ford's car sales have climbed 7.7 percent to an
average daily rate of 7,121 in 1988 compared with 6,612 in 1987.
   Chrysler said it sold cars at a daily rate of 2,673 in early
December this year compared with 2,979 during the same period last
year, a 10.3 percent decline. So far this year, Chrysler has sold
10.3 percent more cars, with a daily sales rate of 3,451 in 1988
compared with 3,130 last year.

<HEAD>Coffee Futures Hit 4{-Month Highs On Supply Fears</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Coffee futures prices rocketed to 4{-month highs Wednesday on New
York's Coffee, Sugar & Cocoa Exchange as a dockworkers strike in
Brazil ignited speculation about shriveling supplies.
   On other markets, prices of copper, precious metals, energy and
most agricultural futures also rose while stock-index futures
retreated.
   Coffee's day-long rally was ``an explosion'' featuring extremely
heavy volume, said Bert Ruiz, a coffee broker with Balfour Maclaine
Corp. in New York.
   Coffee settled 2.30 cents to 4.64 cents higher with the spot
December contract at $1.35 a pound and the heavily traded March
contract at $1.3342 a pound, the highest settlement price for either
contract since July 25.
   Analysts said the Brazilian dockworkers' strike, which began
Tuesday and halted shipments from the key coffee port of Santos, was
not expected to last long.
   But the strike focused the market's attention on dwindling
warehouse stocks of coffee just as consumption approaches its annual
peak, and on the steadily deteriorating crop-production outlook in
Brazil due to a drought in that country's major coffee-growing
regions.
   Ruiz said supplies that ordinarily arrive in the United States
from Central America at this time of year have been delayed by heavy
rains. And another 1 million bags of coffee recently authorized for
release onto the market by the International Coffee Organization's
price-support formula has not yet occurred, he said.
   Since June, Brazil's coffee-growing regions have received normal
monthly precipitation in only one month _ October, said Kim
Badenhop, an analyst wiht Merrill Lynch Capital Markets Inc. For the
year to date, precipitation in most of those areas is less than 50
percent of normal, he said.
   The dry weather has lessened the quality of the 1988-89 Brazilian
crop now being harvested and reduced projections for the 1989-90
crop from original estimates of more than 40 million bags to about
25 million bags.
   Copper futures rallied strongly on New York's Commodity Exchange
in technically inspired buying following two days of steep declines,
said Peter Cardillo, commodities trading adviser with Josephthal &
Co. in New York.
   Copper settled 2.20 cents to 4.20 cents higher with March at
$1.332 a pound.
   Platinum soared in a technical rebound from its recent lows while
gold and silver finished modestly higher, mainly in reaction to
platinum's gains and to strength in the energy market, Cardillo said.
   Platinum settled $9.50 to $14.50 higher on the New York
Mercantile Exchange with January at $604.50 a troy ounce. On the
Commodity Exchange, gold was $1.60 to $1.80 higher with February at
$425.70 a troy ounce; silver was 0.9 cent to 1.4 cents higher with
March at $6.305 a troy ounce.
   Energy futures prices surged on the New York Mercantile Exchange
following Norway's announcement that it would not increase
production of crude oil, informally supporting OPEC's new production
quotas designed to lift oil prices, analysts said.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 34 cents to 39 cents
higher with January at $16.37 a barrel; heating oil was 1.11 cents
to 1.86 cents higher with January at 51.13 cents a gallon; unleaded
gasoline was .34 cent to .88 cent higher with January at 43.72 cents
a gallon.
   Soybean futures settled sharply higher on the Chicago Board of
Trade in sympathy with a strong late rally in soybean meal linked to
talk of increased export sales, analysts said.
   Corn prices also closed higher while wheat futures finished
narrowly mixed.
   Wheat settled { cent lower to { cent higher with December at
$4.26} a bushel; corn was 1{ cents to 4{ cents higher with December
at $2.66} a bushel; oats were } cent to 2 cents higher with December
at $2.11{ a bushel; soybeans were 7{ cents to 14} cents higher with
January at $7.78\ a bushel.
   On the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, live cattle settled .15 cent
to .65 cent higher with December at 72.60 cents a pound; feeder
cattle were .30 cent to .57 cent higher with January at 84.30 cents
a pound; live hog futures were .03 cent to .68 cent higher with
December at 43.20 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were .20 cent
lower to .42 cent higher with February at 44.92 cents a pound.
   Stock-index futures retreated moderately on the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange, where the contract for March delivery of the
Standard & Poor's 500 index settled 1.20 points lower at 278.40.
Each point is worth $500.

   Steel imports rose 7.1 percent to 17.6 million
tons for the first 10 months of 1988, but strong domestic demand
held foreigners' share of the market near the goal of the U.S. quota
program, according to figures released Wednesday.
   Over 10 months of 1988, imports accounted for 20.4 percent of the
market, practically the goal set by the Reagan administration when
it introduced import quotas in 1984.
   Imports in October declined to 1.5 million tons from 1.64 million
tons in September and 1.61 million tons in October 1987.
   The figures, based on Commerce Department data, were released in
Washington, D.C., by the American Iron and Steel Institute.
   The rival American Institute for Imported Steel said that after
deducting 2.5 million tons of steel imports bought by domestic mills
for further processing, 10-month imports totaled 15 million tons, or
17.5 percent of the market. The percentage figure is well below the
18.5 percent target set for finished steel products.
   ``With (quotas) expiring in nine months and much being heard for
and against renewal, overriding factors in any decision in addition
to interest of domestic steel producers must also be those of
domestic steel users, fabricators and manufacturers of
steel-intensive products whose very existence creates the market for
both domestic steel producers and importers,'' said Erwin L. Klein,
president of the importers institute and vice chairman of the
importing firm Steelinter USA.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   CBS Inc. said Wednesday it tentatively had agreed
to buy two radio stations in Detroit, WWJ-AM and WJOI-FM.
   The stations are owned by Federal Broadcasting Co., a subsidiary
of Federal Enterprises Inc. which is based in Southfield, Mich.
   In a one-sentence statement, CBS said it had signed a non-binding
letter of intent to acquire WWJ-AM, a news and information station
that has been a CBS affiliate since 1975, and WJOI-FM, which uses an
easy listening music format.
   Terms were not disclosed, and CBS spokeswoman Helene Blieberg
said CBS hoped to have a signed contract for the purchase within a
month.
   A call was placed to Federal Enterprises, but a woman answering
the telephone said there was no one available to comment on the
announcement.
   Federal Enterprises owns television stations in Marquette, Mich.,
and Kirksville, Mo., and a radio station in New York City.
   CBS owns 18 radio stations, including seven AM and 11 FM outlets.
Federal regulations permit a company to own up to 12 AM and 12 FM
radio stations.

<HEAD>Pennwalt Tells Stockholders To Wait On Centaur Offer</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pennwalt Corp. told its shareholders
Wednesday to ignore an investor group's $100 a share buyout offer
until the chemical company's board of directors responds to it.
   Pennwalt spokeswoman Sue S. Kinard would not say when the board
plans to meet.
   The offer by Centaur Partners, whose principals are New York
financiers Abbey J. Butler and Melvyn J. Estrin, is worth about $765
million. Centaur already owns 12.7 percent of the company's
outstanding shares.
   On the New York Stock Exchange Wednesday,
   Pennwalt stock closed down 37{ cents at $98.25 a share Wednesday
on the New York Stock Exchange,
   Centaur Partners,owned 12.7 percent of the company's shares as of
Monday, when Centaur anounced the $100 per share offer.
   Some analysts have said the company, if sold piece by piece,
could be worth as much as $120 per share, or $900 million.
   Pennwalt has 9,000 employees and annual sales of more than $1
billion.
   Butler and Estrin, who have been courting the company for months,
have told Pennwalt Chairman Edwin E. Tuttle they have all the
financing needed to complete the deal.
   In its official tender offer submitted to the Securities and
Exchange Commission on Tuesday, Centaur Partners said it might sell
the company's agrichemical operations if their takeover succeeds.
   The partnership also said it would try to reduce overhead
expenses, which could mean layoffs. Centaur also said it would
follow through on Pennwalt's plan to sell the rest of its equipment
group.
   The partnership said it would review the company before
considering changes in Pennwalt's board of directors and corporate
structure.
   Six months ago, Centaur announced it had bought a large stake in
Pennwalt and in October said it had acquired 1 million shares, or
8.6 percent of the company.
   Pennwalt has responded to the offer by selling its drug and
equipment business and buying back about 40 percent of the
outstanding shares.
   On Tuesday, Moody's Investors Services Inc. said it was placing
Pennwalt's credit rating under review, saying it might downgrade it.
   ``The review is focusing on the changes in debt protection
afforded Pennwalt's bondholders and noteholders if the company is
acquired by Centaur or another entity,'' Moody's said.

<HEAD>Mexico Wants Reduced Debt Payment Level</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SERGIO CARRASCO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MEXICO CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mexico is asking its creditors to reduce its
annual foreign debt payments to the equivalent of 3 percent of its
gross national product from the present 5 percent, according to
Treasury Secretary Pedro Aspe.
   Aspe told federal senators and deputies on Tuesday that the new
administration of President Carlos Salinas de Gortari had outlined
the proposal to creditor banks in Europe and the United States.
   Aspe did not disclose details of the Mexican proposal, but the
Mexico City financial daily El Financiero on Wednesday said the
proposal would nearly halve Mexico's anticipated $16 billion debt
service bill in 1989.
   The Mexico City newspaper El Universal on Wednesday reported the
proposal won a sympathetic response from European bankers but ``has
encountered obstacles and resistance in the United States because of
the change of government'' there.
   The newspaper said U.S. bankers have adopted a wait-and-see
attitude toward the Mexican proposal, at least until President-elect
George Bush is inaugurated on Jan. 20.
   Salinas, who was sworn in Dec. 1, repeatedly has warned that
Mexico cannot continue to devote 5 percent of its gross national
product each year to service its $102 billion foreign debt, the
developing world's second-highest after Brazil.
   Mexico will pay an estimated $14 billion in interest and
principal on the debt in 1988.
   El Financiero said Aspe told a meeting of labor leaders on Monday
that Salinas' negotiating team wants a debt restructuring agreement
that would target a greater proportion of Mexican payments toward
debt principal.
   Salinas also wants creditor banks to acknowledge the real value
of Mexican debt paper as determined by the secondary market and to
reschedule Mexico's servicing payments accordingly, the newspaper
said.
   The secondary market has valued Mexico's debt at 50 cents on the
dollar.
   Mexico City newspapers on Wednesday reported that Aspe plans to
visit Washington in the next few days to take up the proposal with
Mexico's creditors.
   Creditor banks have balked this year on moves toward Mexican
debt-reduction proposals.
   Mexico did reduce its debt principal by $1.1 billion through a
U.S.-backed bond auction earlier this year, but the reduction was
far less than officials originally hoped for.
   Aspe's disclosure of the new reduction target came after Salinas
named former Treasury Secretary Gustavo Petricioli as the Mexican
ambassador to Washington, yet another sign of the president's
eagerness to achieve rapid progress in restructuring negotiations.

<HEAD>Texas Air Withholding Preferred Stock Dividends</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Texas Air Corp., parent of Continental and Eastern
airlines, said Wednesday it was withholding payment of preferred
stock dividends because its subsidiaries were not meeting earnings
objectives.
   The dividends, which Texas Air said would amount to about $5.2
million, affect 6.5 percent depository preferred stock, 12 percent
depository preferred stock, 6} percent cumulative convertible junior
preferred stock and 15 percent $20 cumulative preferred stock.
   Depending on the stock, dividends would have been payable between
Dec. 31, 1988 and Jan. 31, 1989.
   In a statement, Texas Air said its cash levels have been
substantial throughout the year and now exceed $700 million, but
provisions of the company's unsecured debt indentures incorporate
overall earnings objectives that have not been met.
   Texas Air singled out Eastern Airlines, which it said ``continues
to experience serious operating losses.
   Texas Air said the dividends would be paid later when profits
offset the cumulative effects of recent losses. The proposed sale of
assets such as the Eastern Shuttle also could aid in the resumption
of the dividend, the company said.
   Texas Air Chairman Frank Lorenzo is proposing that the shuttle,
one of the airline's few profitable divisions, be sold to New York
real estate developer Donald Trump for $365 million. The deal is
being fought by Eastern's unions, which have been at odds with
Lorenzo.
   Eastern has lost $1 billion in the last decade, including a $113
million loss in the third quarter.
   Texas Air lost $494 million in the first nine months of 1988,
more than double the $200 million in losses amassed during the same
period a year ago.

<HEAD>CBS Wins Baseball Network Broadcast Rights With $1 Billion Bid</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: ADDS 5 new grafs further comment, background.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By RONALD BLUM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Sports Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   CBS, a failure last month in its bid for the
Barcelona Olympics, shocked baseball and the television industry
Wednesday by winning network rights for $1 billion over four years.
   NBC, which has prided itself as beig the ``baseball network''
since 1947, said it was outbid by a substantial margin and accused
its rival of irresponsibility.
   The new contract is the largest ever awarded one network for
sports. It gives CBS the World Series in 1990 along with both league
playoffs, the All-Star Game and a 12-game package during the season.
   Brent Musburger, who hosts the network's coverage of major
events, was beaming.
   ``Today was like having an early Christmas and a dream come
true,'' said Musburger, who umpired in the Midwest League in 1959.
``I've worked for CBS for 20 years and it's the one sport we never
covered. Never in my wildest dreams did I think we'd get it all.''
   Baseball will award a contract for cable rights next month and
expects to earn an additional $75 million to $100 million a year.
   NBC and ABC, which have shared baseball since 1975, will televise
games next season for $240 million under the final year of the
current six-year, $1.1 billion pact.
   NBC did not release details of its bid and Arthur Watson,
president of NBC Sports, criticized CBS.
   ``We made every effort to keep it,'' Watson said. ``Regretfully,
someone bid far more than was responsible. Everybody evaluates
things differently. That bid was beyond our reach. Let them explain
that bid.''
   On the New York Stock Exchange, CBS closed at $169.25, up $1.37{
from Tuesday. General Electric, NBC's parent, dropped 87{ cents to
$45.
   Neal Pilson, president of CBS Sports, said losing the Barcelona
rights had nothing to do with his network's desire to wrest baseball
from NBC.
   Pilson and Watson continued a public squabble that began after
CBS spent $243 million for the Barcelona rights.
   Watson at the time said CBS overbid. But after NBC won the
Barcelona rights for $401 million, Watson implied his earlier
comments were intended to trick CBS into lowering its bid for the
Summer Games.
   Asked if he thought Watson's remarks were uncalled for, Pilson
said Wednesday: ``Art Watson can run his business and I'll run mine.
You can ask him what happened to NBC's bid on major league baseball.
   ``Looking at the numbers, I think we're better off spending a
billion dollars over four years than half a billion over two weeks.''
   Although Wednesday's agreement was approved unanimously in a
conference call of the 26 club owners, many details have not been
completed. Commissioner Peter Ueberroth, who wants to increase the
number of day World Series games, said that matter still had to be
negotiated.
   CBS officials said day games would be considered, but they also
said they were counting on baseball to improve the network's
last-place, prime-time schedule.
   Ueberroth said that on Monday, he sent the three networks a form
listing the different events they could bid for. The networks were
offered the playoffs, World Series, All-Star Game and regular-season
packages of 12 and 30 games. CBS and ABC bid for the 12-game package
and NBC bid for 30 games.
   The networks individually came to Ueberroth's office with their
bids on Tuesday. Pilson said he was asked back to explain details
and on Wednesday CBS learned it had won.
   Meanwhile, Ueberroth said he had narrowed the cable bidders to
four: ESPN, Turner Broadcasting's TNT Network, USA Network and
SportsChannel America.
   Phil Jones, general manager of KCTV in Kansas City, Mo., and a
former chairman of the CBS affiliates board, said the baseball
contract bolstered his confidence in Laurence A. Tisch, president
and CEO of CBS Inc.
   ``It demonstrates that Larry Tisch is in this business to win and
people ought to quit speculating about whether he will go after
premier events,'' Jones said.
   Thomas Winner, director of media at the Campbell-Mithun-Esty
advertising agency, was unsure CBS could make money on the deal.
   ``The important fact from their point of view is they have 12
months of quality sports programming,'' he said. ``They are
therefore the only network that can talk in that fashion.''
   CBS already has rights to broadcast the National Football League,
the National Basketball Association, the NCAA basketball tournament
and the U.S. Open tennis tournament.

<HEAD>Trump May Try To Get Control Of Caesars World</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOYCE A. VENEZIA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The price of Caesars World Inc. stock
surged Wednesday after developer Donald Trump surprised the gaming
industry by asking the federal government for a ruling on whether he
could buy a controlling interest in the hotel and casino company
without violating antitrust laws.
   Trump filed notice on Tuesday with the U.S. Justice Department
and the Federal Trade Commission of his desire to possibly purchase
more than 50 percent of Caesars World common stock.
   Although neither Trump nor Caesars will say how much Trump
already owns, the filing was made under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act,
which requires companies or individuals to seek such a ruling once
they have acquired at least $15 million worth of stock in a company.
   The filing was disclosed after the markets closed on Tuesday, but
Caesars Wolrld stock rose sharply in active trading on Wednesday.
   In consolidated New York Stock Exchange trading, Caesars World
rose $4.25 to $29.50 a share. At that price, its 24.5 million shares
are worth about $723 million.
   Caesars World officials refused comment on Trump's notice, which
it disclosed in a statement late Tuesday.
   The Los Angeles-based company said in the statement that ``due to
the confusing content of this notice, it is unable to ascertain
Trump's plans ...'
   Trump also declined comment. ``Such filings are very confidential
and he's been advised not to comment,'' said Susan Heilbron, a
spokeswoman for Trump.
   Caesars World owns three gaming halls: Caesars Hotel Casino in
Atlantic City and Caesars Palace and Caesars Tahoe in Nevada.
   In the filing, Trump said he ``has the good faith intention,
subject to price, availability and necessary approvals, if any, to
acquire such number of shares ... to hold in excess of 15 percent of
the outstanding voting securities'' of Caesars World.
   But he went on in the filing to say ``it is possible'' that he
may ``decide to seek control'' of Caesars by buying 50 percent or
more of its stock.
   Gaming analysts spent a good part of Wednesday pondering Trump's
latest move.
   Marvin Roffman of the investment firm Janney Montgomery Scott
Inc. in Philadelphia said Caesars is ``one of the best-managed
companies in the industry, and we felt it was worth up to $40 a
share.''
   But Roffman said New Jersey gaming regulators would probably
block any highly-leveraged hostile effort to acquire Caesars World.
   ``Donald Trump's style is not cash, it's to borrow,'' Roffman
said.
   Under New Jersey law, Trump can own only three gaming halls. So
far, he is licensed for two _ Trump Plaza and Trump Castle casino
hotels. A third, the massive Taj Mahal, is under construction and
expected to be completed in 1990.
   ``I think he'll sell one anyway in the future, because it doesn't
make sense to market three in Atlantic City,'' Roffman said. ``But
the bottom line with this Caesars notice is that Donald Trump is
interested in making money, not owning another casino. He simply
bought into an undervalued situation and will come out with a
profit.''
   This is not the first time that Trump has invested in a rival
casino company.
   He made a $30 million profit in Holiday Corp. stock and a $24
million profit on Bally Manufacturing Corp. stock. He also purchased
a small amount of stock in the Golden Nugget Corp., a move that his
competitor, Golden Nugget chairman Steve Wynn, called a ``publicity
stunt.''

   Owners of the vehicles will be notified by mail to take their

   Ford also said it would ask owners of about 200 vehicles built on

return the vehicles to dealers to have the front springs replaced.
   Front springs now in the vehicles did not account for the added

   The Environmental Protection Agency said
Wednesday it plans to crack down on stations that sell leaded
gasoline at far cheaper prices and allow motorists to put it in
no-lead cars.
   Lead disables pollution control equipment, causing increases of
up to 80 percent in emissions of pollutants, the EPA says.
   The agency said it had written refiners and marketers warning
that inspectors would pay close attention to stations where leaded
gasoline is priced significantly below unleaded regular.
   There are no federal penalties against individual motorists who
use the wrong fuel, but EPA may impose civil fines of up to $10,000
on stations that permit it. Some states, however, make it an offense
for individuals too.
   ``There really isn't any excuse for pricing unleaded above
leaded'' since leaded now costs more to make, said Richard Wilson,
head of the mobile sources division in EPA's air pollution program.
   The agency has only 20 inspectors of its own, but hires an
unspecified number through contractors. These inspectors for years
have been checking station tanks and, in cooperation with local
police deparments, making spot checks of cars on the road.
   Those checks consistently show that one car in five has used the
wrong fuel or had its pollution control devices tampered with at
some time. At present, EPA estimates that 6 percent of cars
requiring no-lead are using leaded gasoline, down from more than 10
percent a few years ago.
   Lead compounds have been added to gasoline since the 1920s
because they are the cheapest antiknock additive, by far. Until the
1970s, car engines also relied on the compounds for valve seat
lubrication. Some heavy duty engines did until the mid-1980s.
   Concern over pollution as well as lead toxicity led EPA in 1985
to order maximum permissible lead reduced by more than 90 percent,
from 1.1 gram per gallon to 0.1 gram.
   This means higher refining costs to produce a given octane.
Platt's Oilgram, a trade publication, on Monday reported wholesale
prices for leaded up to 2 cents a gallon higher than regular
unleaded except in the Rocky Mountains and farther west, where the
two grades generally were the same.
   Energy Department figures show leaded gasoline sold retail at 4.7
cents per gallon cheaper than regular unleaded for the first nine
months of 1988.
   Currently, leaded gasoline is 15 percent of the market compared
with 21 percent a year ago.
   Joe Koach, executive director of the Service Station Dealers of
America, said, ``EPA's threats to fine dealers $10,000 are
assinine.''
   Koach complained: ``It's difficult for dealers to control
misfueling. We've had reports of dealers threatened with violence''
for trying to stop customers from buying leaded.
   Independent dealers, he said, are pressured to adhere to retail
prices their suppliers decide on. ``Why is leaded gasoline still
cheaper? It's the oil companies' policy,'' Koach said.
   Ralph Stow of Amoco, a major national brand that has stopped all
leaded sales except in alcohol blends in five midwestern states,
said, ``Our dealers set their own prices.''
   In Ashland, Ky., Dan Lacy of Ashland Oil Co., a midwestern
marketer with 2,000 outlets, said leaded gasoline had been priced at
or above unleaded regular ``for several months now'' at stations his
company serves.
   The American Petroleum Institute, the largest industry trade
group, said in a statement that misfueling was declining and would
continue to do so, and EPA should ``ensure that both the service
station operator and the individual motorist are prevented from
(engaging in) this practice.''

<HEAD>Liggett Introduces New Low-Price Cigarette</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DURHAM, N.C. (AP) </DATELINE>

   Liggett Group Inc. announced Wednesday that
it is introducing a new cigarette called Pyramid, which will be
available to retailers at carton prices comparable to those of 1980.
   Liggett executives say Pyramid represents a new low-price
category that is a departure from the direction the tobacco industry
has been taking.
   ``Cigarette prices have climbed fairly steadily since 1981, with
the primary reason being the major excise tax increase by
Congress,'' said Hal A. Grant, senior vice president of Liggett
Group.
   The difference between the price of generic cigarettes and
full-price cigarettes is narrowing, he said, and the company felt
the time was right to establish a third tier of cigarettes.
   ``What we're going to offer smokers who are showing this clear
preference for branded-price-value cigarettes is the ability to buy
a quality product using their 1988 purchasing power at early 1980
prices _ that's what the Pyramid is all about,'' Grant said.
   He said the savings to consumers could range from $2.50 to $5 per
carton, depending on the state in which it is bought or the price of
the brand that it is being compared against.
   The cigarette industry today is as competitive as it was in the
early 1980s, Grant said, and Liggett, the smallest of the six major
cigarette manufacturers, has to be innovative.
   ``When faced with growing marketing pressures we began looking
for non-conventional ways to counter big-spending efforts by the
majors,'' he said.
   ``We can't outspend them, so we try and out-innovate them with
another new category.''
   The company began shipping Pyramid cigarettes on Monday.

<HEAD>Macy's Reports $19 Million Loss in First Quarter</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   R.H. Macy & Co. on Wednesday reported a $19
million net loss in its first quarter ended Oct. 29, compared with a
net profit of $6.4 million a year earlier.
   The first-quarter loss occurred despite a 20 percent increase in
sales, to $1.62 billion from $1.35 billion.
   The New York Times, in Thursday's editions, attributed the loss
largely to erratic business and the pressure to stimulate sales by
cutting prices. As the retailer sells its goods at an increasingly
slim profit _ or even at a loss _ profits have dropped and in some
cases vanished, the Times said.
   Macy's, which has been privately held for about two years,
recently acquired two California fashion retailers, Bullock's and I.
Magnin. It is burdened with around $5.3 billion in debt from the
leveraged buyout by management that took it private and the
California acquisitions.
   For its fiscal year ended July 31, Macy's posted a net loss of
$134 million, of which $106 million was incurred in the fourth
quarter.
