   Flood waters swept away two people in
a car and killed a third person struggling to save them during
seasonal rains that have forced the evacuations of 2,000 people,
news reports said.
   The two people in the car, a man and his 7-year-old son, were
traveling Thursday in the eastern state of Zulia about 400 miles
east of Caracas, local newspapers said Friday. They were washed
away by a creek that overflowed, the reports said.
   A man passing by tried to rescue them but was also swept away by
the water, the reports said.
   Seasonal flooding in the east has also left about 3,000 acres of
farmland under water.

   Two East Germans made a pre-dawn escape to the
West by swimming 500 yards across a river with their shoes on, West
Berlin police said.
   An East German patrol boat spotted the pair swimming across the
Havel River on Friday, but no shots were fired, said a police
official speaking on condition of anonymity.
   The Havel River flows through West Berlin into communist East
Germany.
   Police said the two drenched men hopped aboard a bus after their
swim and later reported to West Berlin officials. The bus driver
let them ride for free, police said.

   The government has begun a study of a rare cattle
disease that has worried the domestic industry and prompted two
countries to ban British livestock, officials said.
   The disease has not been documented in any other country, though
there have been anecdotal reports from the United States, said Dr.
James Hope, head of an independent research unit studying the
disease.
   Hope said 833 cases of the disease, which affects the animals'
central nervous system, were discovered since 1986 among 13 million
British dairy cows. It is more common in sheep.
   The government has launched an inquiry into the disease, known
as Bovine Spongiform Encephalopachy, officials said Thursday. They
said there was at present no evidence humans could catch it by
eating beef.
   Israel and Australia have banned imports of British cattle,
according to an official for the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries
and Food who spoke on condition of anonymity.

<HEAD>Defense Consultant Admits Paying Others, But Not Federal Employees</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former top Navy contracting official says
that as a private consultant he paid other consultants for
``technical information'' on contracts but denies he paid
government employees.
   William Parkin, who is at the center of the ongoing Pentagon
fraud investigation, said he began making monthly payments to
consultant Fred Lackner in late 1986 for information on a pending
Navy contract for special aircraft equipment.
   Parkin, who retired from the Navy in 1983 to set up his own
consulting firm, said he paid Lackner between $15,000 and $18,000
and that he then provided the contract information to his client,
Hazeltine Corp. of Greeenlawn, N.Y. on Long Island.
   ``I will say it wasn't secret material,'' Parkin said in a
telephone interview Friday with The Associated Press. ``It was
technical information.''
   A Hazeltine official speaking for the company on condition of
anonymity said Hazeltine had ``been assured by investigators that
neither it nor any current or former employee is a target of the
investigation, and has no knowledge of Parkin acquiring any
information unlawfully.''
   ``Hazeltine was aware that Parkin worked with other consultants,
but was not generally aware of the identity of those consultants,''
the official continued. ``And specifically, Hazeltine was not aware
that Fred Lackner was one of them. Lackner has never worked as a
consultant to Hazeltine.''
   The official said there was a ``standard'' clause in Parkin's
contract with Hazeltine `obligating him not to obtain inside
information by bribery.''
   The Justice Department has asserted in an affidavit for a search
warrant that wiretapped conversations showed Parkin ``served as a
middleman who paid government employees for inside information and
sold it to contractors.''
   ``I deny vehemently that I made payoffs to government
officials,'' Parkin was quoted as telling the Wall Street Journal
in an article published Friday. ``I bought information from
(consultant Lackner) and passed it to Hazeltine. That is where I
made an error.''
   Parkin is the second consultant this week to describe an
informal and extensive network of consultants, government officials
and defense contractors whose interests in passing information
often meshed.
   Thomas Muldoon, another consultant who, like Parkin, was named
in federal search warrants in June, was quoted by the Hartford
Courant in Connecticut on Sunday as saying he never asked about the
sources of sensitive information he received from other consultants
and neither did the companies to which he passed it.
   ``Companies never ask you where you get the information,''
Muldoon said. ``There was never any doubt what I was being paid
for.''
   Parkin, 64, of Alexandria, Va., first described his work as a
middleman in the defense industry during a series of interviews
with the Journal, which described him as one of the Navy's most
powerful contracting officers from 1966 to 1983.
   Parkin was hired by Hazeltine in 1986 to help win Navy work on
test equipment for systems that distinguish between friendly and
hostile aircraft. He was paid about $36,000 by the company over a
1{-year period.
   Parkin told the Journal his role was only to serve as a
``front'' for Lackner, now a California defense consultant who also
was the object of an FBI search warrant earlier this summer.
   Parkin said Lackner obtained the confidential information and
that he then passed it on without Lackner ever disclosing how he
got it.
   The information ``tells ahead of time what would be in the
`request for proposals' _ advance information so they (Hazeltine)
could start a proposal,'' Parkin said.
   Lackner was quoted by the Journal as saying the information he
gave Parkin was not inside information. He also told the paper he
had obtained information in the past from Stuart Berlin, currently
a Navy executive and another figure in the investigation but said
it ``was public knowledge.''
   Parkin also disclosed a lengthy list of dealings with various
consultants and others who now figure in the procurement fraud
investigation.
   Among those dealings were loans to an Air Force official whose
office was searched by the FBI and joint investments with William
Galvin, a defense consultant identified as a key figure in the
probe.
   The Justice Department investigation, which became public in
June, centers on allegations that defense contractors routinely
used outside consultants to obtain proprietary information on the
bids of competitors, and that the consultants may have paid bribes
to Pentagon employees.

   After a thunderous opening before thousands of
fans in London's Wembley Stadium, Amnesty International today takes
its star-filled rock show on a global road that runs from Argentina
to Zimbabwe.
   More than 65,000 people packed Wembley on Friday to hear artists
ranging from Bruce Springsteen to Sting sing for human rights.
   The six-hour concert climaxed with Springsteen leading the
cheering fans in ``Chimes of Freedom,'' a Bob Dylan classic
highlighting the theme of the show sponsored by Amnesty
International, a Nobel Peace Prize-winning human rights group.
   The show heads for a weekend concert in Paris and then to
communist Hungary, the first stops in a six-week journey to 20
cities across five continents.
   Organizers expressed delight at the sellout in London, launch
pad for the tour being held to mark the 40th anniversary of the
U.N. Universal Declaration on Human Rights.
   ``I couldn't be more pleased,'' said Jack Healey, Amnesty's U.S.
director and a prime organizer of the tour.
   ``We're selling out all around the world and we're feeling quite
confident about ourselves ... We have great artists, a great
audience here and, I think, the greatest cause in the world.''
   The crowd at Wembley was made up mainly youngsters attracted by
the big stars. They are the generation to whom Amnesty is making a
special appeal to back the human rights declaration, which is
widely endorsed but frequently ignored by governments.
   Springsteen shares a bill for the entire tour with British stars
Sting and Peter Gabriel, American folk singer Tracy Chapman and
Senegal's Youssou N'dour.
   From a podium surrounded by a turquoise and green global map
emblazoned with ``Universal Declaration of Human Rights'' in red
letters, the stars belted out well-known numbers. The crowd swayed
and applauded wildly.
   Spectators in the grandstands rose as Gabriel rocked the podium
with ``Sledgehammer'' and ``Don't Give Up,'' and then went wild as
Springstreen came on with his hit ``Born in the USA.''
   The organizers stress that the aim is not to raise funds, but to
stir the consciences of the young people in the cause of human
rights. Amnesty hopes the tour will break even.
   Thousands of fans signed slips of paper endorsing the human
rights declaration.
   Amnesty officials plan to hand over the signatures at the U.N.
headquarters in New York at the end of the tour.
   ``I'm a big fan of Sting, I guess I really came to hear him. But
it's also a very good cause,'' Ricky McCabe, a 21-year-old chef,
told The Associated Press after signing the declaration.
   Ticket prices vary between rich and poor countries _ $37.60 in
London and $3 in Budapest.
   Amnesty has had a tricky time getting the show to some countries
the organization has sharply criticized. It monitors human rights
abuses, particularly the plight of political prisoners, around the
world.
   Healey is still trying to get the Kremlin to agree to a show in
Moscow.
   ``I am hopeful that negotiations don't break down on our side or
on theirs,'' Healey said. ``We are very anxious to play in the
other superpower.''
   Among the more contentious negotiations was a date in Harare,
capital of Zimbabwe, whose government reacted angrily to Amnesty
reports several years ago of brutal suppression of the minority
Ndebele tribe. The date for Harare is Oct. 7 after what Healey
called ``a careful negotiation.''
   Other confirmed venues are Turin, Italy, on Sept. 8; Barcelona,
Spain, Sept. 10; San Jose, Costa Rica, Sept. 13; Toronto and
Montreal on Sept. 16-17; Philadelphia Sept. 19; Los Angeles Sept.
21; Tokyo Sept. 27; New Delhi Sept. 30; Sao Paulo, Brazil, Oct. 12;
Mendoza, Argentina, Oct. 14; and Buenos Aires, the Argentine
capital, for a finale Oct. 15.

<HEAD>Sasso at Dukakis' Side Again; Bush Vows To `Ban Ocean Dumping
Forever'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CARL C. CRAFT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Michael Dukakis, with his trusted but long-absent Democratic
campaign general reporting back for duty, predicts ``a battle royal
for the presidency.'' GOP nominee George Bush, firing a shot on the
clean-water front, vows to fight to ``ban ocean dumping forever.''
   John Sasso, a top Dukakis aide who quit last year in an uproar
over the ``attack video'' that helped destroy Delaware Sen. Joseph
Biden's campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination,
rejoined the Massachusetts governor's high command Friday in an
attempt to help Dukakis beat Bush on Election Day.
   While campaigning in California, Dukakis told reporters that
Sasso had ``paid the price'' for having ``made a very serious
mistake'' in the Biden video episode. It will be ``a battle royal
for the presidency of the United States,'' Dukakis added, decaring
he wants his warriors to be ``the strongest team I possibly can''
assemble.
   Bush, standing Friday on a New Jersey beach that has been closed
at times because sludge washed ashore after having been dumped off
the coast, continued blasting Dukakis on the environment.
   ``For almost two years, he fought to allow Boston's sludge to be
dumped off New Jersey's shore _ the very shore on which he had the
nerve to stand and promise clean water,'' Bush said. ``Nice guy _
yeah,'' he added sarcastically and asked: ``Why did you pledge a
clean ocean to the people of New Jersey when your own state applied
to pollute it?''
   While Dukakis applied in 1985 to have Massachusetts' waste
dumped 106 miles off New Jersey's coast, a later agreement allowed
Massachusetts to unload it out beyond the continental shelf.
   Bush said he would fight ``to ban ocean dumping forever'' and
would ``make the enforcement of Superfund, the prosecution of
polluters, and the cleanup of toxic waste a top priority.''
   Meantime, Bush avoided reporters' questions about Sasso's
return, saying at one point: ``I haven't thought about it.''
   Sasso left the Dukakis camp after admitting circulating a
videotape showing Biden borrowing a British politician's words
while failing to give attribution. On Friday he apologized for the
incident and said he had not intended to raise questions about
Biden's character.
   Biden's presidential campaign was born in June 1987 and died in
September of that year after being hit by admissions of plagiarism
and false claims about his academic achievements. In quitting the
race for the Democratic nomination eventually won by Dukakis, Biden
said the ``exaggerated shadow'' of his mistakes made it impossible
for him to continue.
   On Friday, Dukakis said Biden ``could not have been more
gracious'' when told Sasso was returning. Biden issued a statement
saying ``I continue to support Governor Dukakis.''
   Elsewhere along the campaign trail:
   _Dukakis, in Portland, Ore., ridiculed the idea of Dan Quayle,
the Indiana senator who is Bush's vice presidential running mate,
heading the war on drugs.
   Noting Bush had said he would put his vice president in charge
of the war on drugs, Dukakis said: ``Ronald Reagan tried that and
it failed.''
   ``Is there anybody here today,'' Dukakis asked, ``is there any
citizen in the United States of America, who thinks that Dan Quayle
is qualified to be the nation's drug czar?''
   _Quayle, in Montgomery, Ala., accused Dukakis of being ``flat
wrong'' on defense and foreign policy matters.
   ``We believe in a strong national defense to deter aggression
against America, and he does not,'' said Quayle, adding: ``On
matters of national defense and foreign policy, believe me, our
opponent is not even half right. He's just flat wrong.''
   _In Washington, , Quayle's office released a doctor's report
showing the candidate in excellent health and that he suffers only
from slightly high cholesterol levels and minor skin and nasal
problems.
   Dr. Robert Krasner, senior assistant attending physician at the
U.S. Capitol, said Quayle's ``marginally elevated'' cholesterol
level can be reduced by proper diet and exercise. He said Quayle
suffers from a minor nose bleeding problem and an unspecified
seasonal allergy that causes nasal swelling, for which he uses a
nasal spray.

   China's leading daily said today that poor
service on the state-run airline ``brings shame to the country and
its ongoing reforms.''
   The People's Daily criticism of the Civil Aviation
Administration of China came three days after a CAAC jetliner
skidded off the runway at Hong Kong's airport and crashed into the
harbor, killing six crew members and one passenger.
   It was CAAC's second fatal accident this year. In January, a
CAAC jet crashed near the southwestern city of Chungking, killing
all 108 people aboard.
   The newspaper did not mention the accidents, concentrating on
the ``deep-rooted problems'' in service.
   ``All CAAC employees, from leaders to ordinary staff members,
should feel ashamed. They should try hard to improve the situation
as quickly as possible if they have an iota of national
self-respect,'' it said.
   The daily, official voice of the Communist Party, said in one
instance the destination of a scheduled flight out of Canton in the
south was suddenly changed to Chengdu in the southwest without
notifying the passengers in advance.
   The Beijing office of a foreign company wrote four letters to
book tickets without getting a response, it said. ``If this service
is not poor, what is?''
   CAAC passengers also complain of frequent flight delays and
cancellations, poor food and the refusal of CAAC employees to say
when a delayed flight will leave, the report said.
   The daily said CAAC, which in recent years has initiated a
program of decentralization to make its operations more efficient,
is finally acknowledging the need for improvement.
   ``Admitting backwardness means that CAAC is waking up to the
realities,'' it said.

   About 2,500 rainbow trout bound for
Oklahoma waters ended up in the hands _ and probably the skillets _
of bystanders after the truck carrying the tasty fish overturned,
officials say.
   The truck from the Norfork National Fish Hatchery was traveling
down a northern Arkansas highway Friday with the load of trout for
Oklahoma when a vehicle headed the other way crowded the road, said
State Police Cpl. Bob Roten.
   The truck pulled to the right to give the oncoming vehicle some
room, but a rear wheel ran off the road and into a ditch, Roten
said.
   The driver's efforts to get the truck back on the road shifted
the load of 2,500 trout in a 1,000-gallon tank of water, and the
truck overturned, the corporal said. The tank, and the fish, fell
off the truck.
   In an agreement involving the Oklahoma Wildlife Department, the
hatchery and a state Game and Fish officer, authorities gave the
fish away to people at the scene rather than let them spoil.

   Swaying in rhythm with a lineup of rock stars,
tens of thousands packed Wembley Stadium on Friday for a concert
that kicks off a global tour launched by Amnesty International in
the cause of human rights.
   Bruce Springsteen, Peter Gabriel, Sting and others opened the
six-hour concert with a rendition of ``Get Up, Stand Up,'' by the
late reggae singer Bob Marley.
   Rain cleared shortly before the start of the concert and the
stars began belting out their songs from a podium surrounded by a
blue and green map of the world embossed with ``Universal
Declaration of Human Rights'' in red letters.
   The concert at the 100,000-capacity stadium begins a six-week
world tour which hopes to reach 20 cities on five continents to
mark the 40th anniversary of the human rights declaration by the
United Nations.
   Amnesty International, which monitors human rights worldwide and
won the 1977 Nobel Peace Prize, launched the $23 million
extravaganza to stir the consciences of the young.
   The good-natured crowd packing the arena below the artists
raised their arms to send human waves rippling around the stadium.
   Springsteen is sharing the bill for the entire tour with British
stars Gabriel and Sting, American Tracey Chapman and Senegal's
Youssou N'dour.
   The stadium exploded in applause as Springsteen, the last artist
to perform solo, led off with ``Born in the U.S.A.'' Thousands of
British youngsters rose in the grandstands and joined in.
   The finale, with all the performers joining in, was ``Chimes of
Freedom.''
   The rolling concert with its 200 participants, traveling in five
trucks and a chartered jet, moves to Paris on Sunday after one
night at Wembley and then to Budapest Sept. 6.
   The venues include African and Latin American nations that have
been sensitive to Amnesty's accusations against them.
   Jack Healey, head of the U.S. division of Amnesty International,
said the concert was still negotiating for a date in Moscow.
   ``I am hopeful that negotiations don't break down on our side or
on theirs,'' Healey said. ``We are very anxious to play in the
other superpower.''
   Among the more contentious negotiations was a date in Harare,
capital of Zimbabwe, whose government reacted angrily to Amnesty
reports several years ago of brutal suppression of the minority
Ndebele tribe. The organizers announced Friday that the date was
fixed at Oct. 7 after what Healey called ``a careful negotiation.''
   Other confirmed venues are Turin, Italy, on Sept 8; Barcelona,
Spain, Sept. 10; San Jose, Costa Rica, on Sept. 13; Toronto and
Montreal in Canada on Sept. 16-17; Philadelphia on Sept. 19; Los
Angeles on Sept 21; Tokyo, Sept. 27; New Delhi on Sept. 30; Sao
Paulo, Brazil, on Oct. 12; Mendoza, Argentina, on Oct. 14; and
Buenos Aires, the Argentine capital, for a grand finale on Oct. 15.
   Signatories to the U.N. declaration range from democracies to
dictatorships, and include many of the countries who are accused by
Amnesty International of human rights abuses such as political
murder, torture and racial persecution.
   More than a million people are expected to see the concerts
live, and the organizers estimate TV audiences may eventually reach
1 billion.
   Amnesty International stressed the tour aimed to raise
consciousness, not money.
   ``This tour is not about charity, it's about justice,'' Healey
said.
   He said he ``couldn't be more pleased,'' with the turnout at the
Wembley concert. Hundreds of young people took time out to sign

   Springsteen said before the start of the concert that at 38, he
no longer believed he could pick up a guitar and ``change the

   ``This is definitely not for fund-raising,'' said Healey, who
put together a two-week American tour called ``Conspiracy of Hope''
in 1986 featuring Gabriel, Sting and the Irish group, U2.
   U.S. membership rose by 100,000 to 250,000 in the following
year. Amnesty International's worldwide membership is 750,000.
   Every audience member will get a card with the text of the U.N.
declaration on human rights. Spectators will also be able to sign
slips of paper saying they uphold the declaration. At the end of
the tour, Amnesty plans to deliver these to the governments of the
countries visited.

   Federal regulators and representatives of the
Robert M. Bass Group of Fort Worth, Texas, are expected to resume
talks today on the rescue of American Savings and Loan Association
of Stockton, Calif., according to a government official.
   Karl Hoyle, a spokesman for the Federal Home Loan Bank Board,
said early today that face-to-face meetings between representatives
of the two parties had recessed but that negotiations had not
broken down. But, no announcement was forthcoming even though the
parties met late into the night.
   Speaking shortly after midnight, he said, ``I suspect we won't
talk again until later today.''
   On Thursday, the bank board had described the negotiations as
``intensive.''
   Industry sources say the two sides are discussing a proposal
that could become the largest rescue ever of a single S&L. Sources
say the proposal would have the Bass Group contribute $500 million
and the bank board adding up to $2 billion in assistance.
   To date the largest S&L bailout is the $1.3 billion infusion
last November into Vernon Savings and Loan Association in Texas.
   American is owned by the Irvine, Calif.-based Financial Corp. of
America, the second-largest thrift holding company in the nation
with $30.2 billion in assets as of June 30.

<HEAD>Defense Minister: U.S. Threat Remains After Defeat Of Contras</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRYNA BRENNAN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>SAN JACINTO, Nicaragua (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Defense Minister Humberto Ortega
said Nicaragua has defeated U.S.-backed rebels but will maintain
its large army because of the threat of an invasion by American
troops.
   Ortega said Friday the rebels are ``strategically defeated'' but
the government will not reduce it 80,000-member Armed Forces, the
biggest in Central America.
   ``We can't have a lesser level,'' he said, citing the presence
of rebel units across the border in Honduras and what he called the
threat of U.S. military intervention.
   A Contra director, meanwhile, said that a loss of U.S. support
for the rebels ``could mean the blood of American soldiers.''
   A transcript of a rebel Radio Liberation broadcast quoted
Enrique Bermudez as saying the Contras ``are fighting for democracy
in Central America.''
   But Ortega said the rebels, known as Contras, were in an
``irreversible situation'' with no hope for victory.
   The Contras began fighting the leftist government in 1981. The
Sandinistas came to power in July 1979 in the civil war that ousted
President Anastasio Somoza after 42 years of rule by the Somoza
family.
   Ortega spoke with reporters after addressing a crowd of soldiers
at an Army Day ceremony in San Jacinto, 25 miles north of the
capital of Managua.
   The defense minister said the rebels still hoped to obtain
renewed U.S. military aid, cut off at the end of February. He said
the Reagan administration was attempting to provoke a conflict
between Honduran and Nicaraguan troops to justify direct American
military intervention.
   The United States sent more than 3,000 soldiers to Honduras in
March in response to a Sandinista border crossing into Honduras,
but then withdrew the troops.
   The Sandinistas and the Contras signed a cease-fire pact March
23. But high-level talks to work out the mechanics of a permanent
truce in the 7-year-old war stalemated in June. Both sides accuse
the other of violating the March agreement to suspend offensive
military operations.
   The defense minister said that the Sandinistas were ready to
renew the talks but that they had to be held in Managua, the
capital. The Contras refuse to return to Managua, saying they were
barred from circulating freely.
   Ortega repeated the Sandinista government's estimate that there
are 6,000 Contras and he said 70 percent of them were in Honduras.
Rebel officials say more than 10,000 combatants are in Honduras and
about 2,000 remain in Nicaragua.

   The crew of downed Delta Flight 1141
called out that the jet's wing flaps were in the proper position
for takeoff, according to cockpit recordings released Friday,
adding more confusion to the crash investigation.
   National Transportation Safety Board member Lee Dickinson said
at a briefing Friday night that the statements captured by the
flight recorder seem to disagree with physical evidence found at
the scene of Wednesday's accident, in which 13 people died.
   Dickinson said the recording clearly indicates someone making a
pre-takeoff call out for flaps and someone responding ``15, 15.
Green light.'' He said that would seem to indicate both flaps were
shown to be in a matching angle of 15 degrees downward, a normal
takeoff position for a Boeing 727.
   Flight engineer Steven Judd also told the NTSB team Friday that
he also heard the crew's first officer say ``15, 15.''
   Flaps help provide the lift a plane needs to become airborne.
The Delta jetliner crashed as it tried to take off from Dallas-Fort
Worth International Airport.
   Investigators said the flaps in the wreckage appeared to be in
the up position, and the airplane's slats, on the wing's leading
edge, were found to be partly extended. The Boeing 727's slats have
``physical locking devices'' that would have prevented them from
being knocked far out of place by a crash, said Bernard Loeb,
deputy director of investigations for the NTSB.
   Officials said they have not determined which voices belong to
the specific crew members.
   Another inconsistency investigators noted was no visible sign of
damage to any of the plane's three engines. Dickinson said they
will have to wait until the Pratt & Whitney power plants are torn
down at the factory in Hartford, Conn., to learn more.
   Judd told investigators all three engines appeared to be
operating normally up until the time the nose wheel was lifting off
8,500 to 9,000 feet down runway 18L.
   Judd also said the right wing ``dipped severely'' after takeoff
and Capt. Larry Davis tried to correct the situation.
   The flight engineer said the plane had a very long wait for
takeoff and for a time shut down the right engine, which was
separated from the fuselage after the crash.
   Witness accounts that the engines flared during takeoff could
indicate ``compressor stall,'' a phenomenon in which air flow to a
jet engine's compressor is interrupted, Loeb said. But he said such
a condition could not be confirmed yet.
   Loeb said he would not care to speculate on what position into
which a pilot would have to move his flaps if the plane's ``nose
attitude'' was too extreme, as some witnesses told the NTSB earlier.
   The federal officials said they would continue to study the left
rear emergency door, near where many of the victims were found.
   Loeb said it took more than one person to open the door for the
first time after the crash. But he cautioned that no conclusion
could be drawn that people may have been trapped inside by a
troublesome door. The angle of the wreckage combined with
gravitational forces may have made the door difficult to open, he
said.
   Ninety-five of the 108 people on board survived, most by
scrambling out of emergency doors over the left wing and a crack
between the cabin and cockpit of the jet, which broke apart and
burst into flames as it plowed into a field of sunflowers at the
end of the runway.
   Investigators Thursday discovered an indicator of wing flap
position was stuck in a position not normal for most takeoffs.They
found the indicator in the ``up'' position, opposite of the proper
setting for takeoff, but stressed it could have been jarred during
the crash or by crew members during evacuation.
   The cockpit recording also showed that the ``shaker stick,''
which rattles a plane's steering mechanism when a problem develops,
sounded during takeoff, investigators said.
   The recording also indicated that the crew in the cockpit
discussed a possible engine problem during the few seconds of the
flight, and pilots in planes waiting on taxiways when Flight 1141
took off reported seeing a white flame or vapor from the plane's
left engine.
   Friday, a forklift picked up the plane's right engine, which was
found separated from the fuselage after the crash, and placed it on
a large flatbed truck, where it was secured with chains for
shipment to Pratt & Whitney.
   The Boeing 727 is designed to fly even if one of its three
engines is out, officials have said.
   Investigators hope the fact that the flight's cockpit crew
survived will help them more easily reconstruct the accident.
   The pilot, Capt. Larry L. Davis, 48, was in fair condition
Friday at Parkland Memorial Hospital, while 1st Officer Carey
Wilson Kirkland Jr., 37, was in stable condition at Northeast
Community Hospital at Bedford.
   John Mazor, a spokesman for the Air Line Pilots Association,
said Davis should not be interviewed until he has recovered more
and is no longer under the influence of painkillers.
   ``What you don't do is take someone out of a smoldering cockpit
and shove a tape recorder under their nose,'' Mazor said. ``The
account you get is going to be unreliable.''
   Dickinson said blood and urine samples had been taken from the
crew members shortly after they arrived hospitals Wednesday would
be tested for traces of drugs and alcohol. Such tests are routine
after accidents.
   As investigators continued studying the wreckage Friday, more
attention was placed on the closed emergency exit on the left side
of the plane toward the back, near the galley.
   Tarrant County Medical Examiner Nizan Peerwani said the bodies
of seven passengers and two flight attendants were found
``literally piled on top of one another in front of an exit door
that apparently could not be opened.''
   Federal safety investigators and Delta officials declined to
speculate on whether the unopened exit was a factor in the deaths,
but Dickinson said NTSB personnel are trying to determine whether
the door was jammed. Other exits are also being studied.
   Bill Berry, an Atlanta-based Delta spokesman, declined to
speculate on why the victims were unable to open the exit.
Ordinarily, he said, a door on a 727 can be opened manually in
about two seconds.
   The plane carried nearly a score of off-duty Delta employees, 10
of them flight attendants. Some passengers said their presence
contributed to the miraculous number of survivors.
   Several passengers credited Damon Berry, 37, of Sandy, Utah, an
off-duty Delta employee on the flight, with staying in the burning
plane to help others.
   ``I can't really say what was going through my mind,'' he said.
``You just do it. It just seemed like my responsibility to try and
help as many people as I could.''

   Former Rep. Mario Biaggi last year owed
somewhere between $30,000 and $100,000, according to his federal
financial disclosure form, but that's small change compared with
the roughly $8 million in fines he faces after two federal
convictions.
   Biaggi, a Democrat who represented part of the Bronx and
Yonkers, N.Y., in Congress for nearly 20 years, resigned his seat
Aug. 5 after being found guilty of extorting bribes from the
Wedtech Corp.
   Wedtech was a Bronx machine shop that grew into a
multimillion-dollar military contractor before being forced into
bankruptcy.
   Biaggi also was convicted on other charges, including that he
had filed false financial disclosure statements in the past by
failing to include the $50,000 cash and $3 million in stock he
allegedly demanded from Wedtech in exchange for his clout in
Washington.
   Biaggi reported income and assets totaling between about
$769,000 and $1.7 million last year on his financial disclosure
form. He listed debts of between $30,000 and $100,000 in 1987.
   Members of Congress are required to report annually on their
income and assets, but only within broad ranges.
   As in recent years, Biaggi's latest disclosure made no mention
of Wedtech stock and included no gifts to the congressman.
   His 1987 report, which had been due with the clerk of the House
of Representatives on May 15, was not received until Aug. 18. The
congressman had been granted three extensions in light of the
Wedtech trial, which began in March and ended Aug. 4.
   Biaggi continues to maintain his innocence and the verdict is
under appeal. Sentencing is scheduled for Nov. 18, at which time
the 70-year-old ex-congressman faces up to 146 years in prison and
$7,422,000 in fines. The judge also ordered Biaggi to forfeit
$350,000 in ill-gotten gains.
   In a separate trial last year, Biaggi was convicted of accepting
an illegal gratuity in the form of paid Florida vacations. He was
sentenced to 2{ years in prison and fined $500,000. Appeal of that
case was denied in early August, but Biaggi's attorneys have
petitioned for a rehearing.
   Biaggi's 1987 income included $7,000 in fees from his former law
firm, Biaggi and Ehrlich, for unspecified services. Biaggi and
Ehrlich also reimbursed the ex-congressman for an unspecified
amount of telephone expenses.
   Biaggi sold his partnership in the firm in 1979 for $320,000 to
be paid over time at 7 percent interest. He was supposed to receive
$30,000 per year for the period Jan. 1, 1980, through Dec. 31,
1988, according to his disclosure forms. But in 1987, Biaggi only
received between $2,501 and $5,000 from the agreement.
   Other members of the firm, namely Bernard Ehrlich and Biaggi's
son, Richard, also were defendants in the Wedtech trial. Ehrlich
was convicted of racketeering and Richard Biaggi was found guilty
of bribe receiving, mail fraud and tax fraud.
   The elder Biaggi, who was a New York City policeman from 1942 to
1965, collected $16,837 on his police pension last year, the form
also showed.
   Biaggi's stock holdings ranged from more than $505,000 to in
excess of $1 million. He also purchased stocks worth between
$20,000 and $85,000 in 1987 while he sold securities worth between
$10,000 and $30,000.
   The forms are not a very good indicator of net worth, however.
Members are not required to list holdings such as real estate,
unless it is sold or rented out during the year in question. They
also do not have to report cars, boats or other valuable assets.

<HEAD>KGB Chief: Foreign-Supported `Ideological Sabotage' Threatens
Soviets</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN-THOR DAHLBURG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The head of the KGB says foreign-supported
subversives are attempting to use the freer atmosphere in the
Soviet Union to undermine the system.
   ``They try to stimulate the organization of various kinds of
clandestine, semilegal and even legal associations in our country
which would act at their bidding,'' said Victor Chebrikov, who
referred to the actions as ``ideological sabotage.''
   In a rare glimpse into the Soviet secret agency Friday,
Chebrikov also said his agents caught 20 spies in the past 2{ years
and asserted that superpower intelligence agencies are still waging
a Cold War, despite improved East-West relations.
   ``Certain circles of imperialism have not abandoned the course
toward confrontation,'' said Chebrikov, head of the Committee for
State Security _ the KGB _ and a member of the ruling Communist
Party Politburo.
   Chebrikov also said in the lengthy interview in the party
newspaper Pravda that officials are in the process of trying to
define the KGB's role, adding that he is working on ``remolding
thinking and renouncing stereotypes'' within the KGB's ranks.
   He voiced support for the Kremlin's policy of ``glasnost'' or
greater openness, but said some of the KGB's acts must remain
secret.
   He said the agency's primary goal is to stop
intelligence-gathering and subversive activities by foreign secret
services, ``as well as hostile actions by anti-Soviet and
antisocialist-minded persons inside the country.''
   In what appeared to be his first interview, Chebrikov
acknowledged the Soviet secret police apparatus has been guilty of
repression on the domestic front. But he gave no details, other
than to mention some former officials of the security agency who
were killed for resisting repressions under dictator Josef Stalin.
   Chebrikov said more than 20,000 agents who resisted orders from
higher-ups to violate the law ``fell victim to repressions as a
result of false charges.''
   The agency now trains agents to adhere strictly to Soviet law,
he said.
   Chebrikov said the 20 captured spies included KGB officers
working as double agents. He said more than 50 diplomats and
correspondents from NATO-member countries were expelled from the
Soviet Union in 1986-87 for ``activities incompatible with their
diplomatic status.''
   Chebrikov also reported the discovery of nuclear-powered devices
to eavesdrop on a Soviet underwater telephone cable in the Okhotsk
Sea 37 miles off the Soviet east coast and north of Japan.
   ``The complex was designed for registering during a year all
information transmitted by the underwater communication cable.
There was also a beacon that helped the American intelligence
service to quickly detect it for taking in the accumulated
information,`` he said.
   The interview did not say when the devices were found. In 1986,
a former National Security Agency employee, Ronald W. Pelton, was
accused of giving the Soviets information about U.S. electronic
eavesdropping. One effort mentioned at Pelton's trial, called
Project A, was designed to intercept Soviet electronic data.
   The Washington Post quoted unidentified intelligence sources at
the time as saying the Project A equipment was placed in the Sea of
Okhotsk, off the Soviet Kamchatka Peninsula. An FBI agent testified
at Pelton's trial that Pelton told him he had told the Soviets
about Project A.
   Chebrikov, KGB chairman since 1982, became a voting member of
the 13-member Politburo in 1985 and has made public appearances in
connection with his post on the ruling body, but he has rarely
talked publicly about the workings of his secretive agency.
   The interview apparently was in response to recent calls for
more information about the roles of top Soviet leaders and the
state and party bodies they head.
   It may also have been intended to brighten the KGB's image,
which has suffered in recent press revelations about the show
trials and purges of the Stalin era. For many Soviets, the KGB
represented part of Stalin's repression.
   The KGB conducts espionage abroad, wages counterintelligence at
home, monitors the words and acts of Soviet citizens, guards the
country's borders, and protects top state and party figures.

   Sen. Dan Quayle, making a bid for the
farmers' vote and attacking Democrat Michael Dukakis as weak on
defense policies, got his best reception of the presidential
campaign from a group of college students that treated his
appearance as a pep rally.
   About 800 cheering students at the University of Central Florida
cheered Quayle on Friday as he stood near a school mascot with a
huge papier mache bust of George Bush and sounded themes of a
strong national defense, economic prosperity and a promising future.
   The students had their football season opener Friday night, and
gave Quayle the most enthusiastic crowd reception to date since he
became the Republican vice presidential nominee.
   GOP strategists are hoping the youthful senator will appeal to
college-age voters, and Quayle has said he hopes the younger
generation will identify with him.
   In one of the more exuberant exchanges, Quayle began to tell the
crowd that he had served on the Senate Armed Services Committee for
eight years.
   ``Eight proud years,'' interjected a voice from the crowd as the
audience cheered.
   An obviously delighted Quayle turned to the voice and shouted,
``Eight proud years.''
   The only negative notes of the day were sounded by a small group
of Dukakis supporters outside the rally who held signs reading
``Quayle Is a Turkey'' and ``Women Don't Vote for Men Prettier Than
They Are.''
   Quayle travels to Newnan, Ga., today for an appearance at an
arts and crafts fair, before going to Columbia, S.C., for a
football game tonight between the University of South Carolina and
the University of North Carolina.
   The Indiana senator appeared more confident Friday in his
campaign than at any time in the past two rocky weeks.
   At appearances in Montgomery, Ala., he attacked Dukakis, the
Democratic presidential nominee, as ``flat wrong'' on defense
issues, and made a strong appeal for the farm vote by telling the
Alabama Farmers Federation and Insurance Cos. that U.S. farmers
should not have to compete against ``illegal subsidies'' of goods
produced by other countries.
   ``As long as we can get that level playing field, the American
farmer will outproduce and be more competitive than any farmers in
the world,'' Quayle said.
   At a Montgomery rally, Quayle said the two tickets disagreed
most sharply in their approach to national defense issues.
   ``We believe in a strong national defense to deter aggression
against America; and he (Dukakis) does not. On matters of national
defense and foreign policy, believe me, our opponent is not even
half right; he's just flat wrong,'' Quayle said.
   Quayle said Dukakis needed ``some education about the defense of
America,'' because of his opposition to the Star Wars space-based
defense system, the MX missile and other weapons systems.

   Republican presidential nominee George Bush is
heading to the West Coast for more campaigning after an Eastern
swing in which he took his Democratic rival Michael Dukakis to task
on environmental issues.
   On this Labor Day weekend, the traditional symbolic beginning of
the election campaign, Bush arranged to meet with reporters today,
then go on Monday to California where he is to tour a San Diego
fish plant and visit Los Angeles. On Tuesday, he heads to Oregon
and Washington state.
   Bush spent Friday turning up the political heat on Dukakis,
trying to burn the Massachusetts governor on issues involving the
environment. The vice president stood on polluted New Jersey
beaches, went along on a Delaware River crab harvesting operation,
and worked the sidewalk crowds in New Castle, Del.
   Later Friday, he attended the wake for Prince George's County,
Md., policeman Mark Murphy, who was shot accidentally by a fellow
officer. Murphy was well known to Bush's Secret Service detail as
part of an emergency services team helping with security at Andrews
Air Force Base in Maryland.
   Bush went on the attack at the beach in Belmar, N.J., where
medical waste and sewage has washed ashore in the past and forced
it to be closed.
   In remarks to a few hundred supporters, the vice president
accused Dukakis of seeking to pollute New Jersey waters by asking
the federal government for permission to dump Massachusetts' waste
106 miles offshore in 1985. A later agreement allowed Massachusetts
to dump farther out to see, beyond the continental shelf.
   Bush said he had a question for Dukakis: ``Why did you pledge a
clean ocean to the people of New Jersey when your own state applied
to pollute it?''
   As for himself, Bush said, he would work to ``ban ocean dumping
forever'' while making ``the enforcement of Superfund, the
prosecution of polluters, and the cleanup of toxic waste a top
priority.''

   Millions of Britons watched television news
footage of two men being pummeled by police officers after their
car was pulled over for a traffic violation.
   Independent Television News said the incident was filmed by a
cameraman who said he was testing his equipment Thursday night in
the village of Brynsiencyn, Anglesey, North Wales, about 230 miles
northwest of London.
   The footage, first broadcast Friday on HTV in Wales, and later
in a national broadcast, showed four police cars with flashing
lights pull over a small car.
   Two men were dragged from the car. One lay curled up on the
pavement. As he tried to rise, officers pushed him to the ground.
Both men were kicked and punched repeatedly.
   Viewers of the Welsh broadcast could hear one screaming as an
officer sat on his chest and punched him in the face, according to
Press Association, the British domestic news agency.
   It said that when the police became aware of the cameraman, they
rushed toward him but he that escaped with the film.
   One officer was suspended and an investigation was launched into
the incident, said a spokesman for the North Wales Police in nearby
Colwyn Bay. The position of other officers will be reviewed as the
investigation progresses, the spokesman said.
   ``We would seek to bring this to an early conclusion,'' said
Assistant Chief Constable John Owen. He said the vehicle had failed
to stop and was being driven at a dangerous speed.
   The civilian men were identified Friday as Brian Owen, who was
charged with reckless driving, and Michael Williams, charged with
assault with intent to resist arrest. Both are in their early 20s
and residents of nearby Newborough.
   The pair have lodged a formal complaint against the North Wales
Police, said their lawyer, John Meredith.
   Meredith said Owen suffered bruising under the eye, a swollen
nose and injuries to the back. Williams was injured in the mouth
and face, he said.
   Ieuan Wyn Jones, the member of Parliament representing the area,
called for an independent inquiry into the beating.
   ``If I am not satisfied, I shall take the matter to the Home
Office,'' he said, referring to the government department that
overseas police procedures in Britain.

<HEAD>Hurricane Debby Brings Heavy Rains, Flooding</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TUXPAN, Mexico (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The first hurricane of the Atlantic season
struck the Gulf of Mexico coast with heavy rains and winds of up to
74 mph, knocking out power and flooding streets and homes.
   Hundreds of people sought refuge from flooding along the coast
before Hurricane Debby moved inland Friday and was downgraded to a
tropical storm. There were no reports of injuries.
   ``The worst is over,'' said Navy Capt. Domingo Rojas Cadenas
early today. But he said Debby still carried wind gusts of up to 56
mph.
   The storm center stalled on reaching the eastern Sierra Madre
mountain range 50 miles from the gulf coast, said the National
Weather Service in Mexico City. Heavy rains continued to fall in
parts of Veracruz and Tamaulipas states.
   ``We can say the storm is becoming disorganized,'' a weather
service spokesman said. He said winds would diminish to 30 mph
today and that ``the storm should disappear by Saturday night.''
   The service said Debby moved inland Friday afternoon at Tuxpan,
a city of 120,000 about 165 miles northeast of Mexico City. It said
at that time the storm was carrying winds up to 74 mph, the minimum
strength to be classified as a hurricane.
   The storm caused power outages in Tuxpan and Poza Rica, about 20
miles to the south, and dozens of people were evacuated from
low-lying areas in the two cities and near the Tuxpan and Tecolutla
rivers.
   Heavy rains and winds downed trees, left cars stranded on
flooded streets and blew roofs off homes in Tuxpan, Rojas said.
   ``Many streets are inundated, and the rivers are rising fast,''
said Red Cross worker Francisco Javier Cruz Balderas.
   Hundreds of people sought refuge in public shelters in Alamo, a
coffee-producing town about 20 miles west of Tuxpan, said Roberto
Martinez, editor of the newspaper El Mundo of Tampico.
   Dozens of residents had to be rescued from cars and flooded
homes in Poza Rica, a city of 300,000. Authorities closed streets
in some sections of the city because of flooding.
   ``(There's) a lot of trash in the streets and tree trunks are
blocking runoff,'' said Red Cross spokesman Alan Garcia in Poza
Rica. ``Even we can't get out _ we're trapped.''
   Martinez said there were power outages throughout the northern
Veracruz coastline and that some local roads were cut off by
flooding.
   Guadalupe Lopez, a spokeswoman with the Veracruz state
government in Jalapa, said there were no reports of deaths or
injuries. She said officials had no estimate of damages.
   Debby grew from a depression into a tropical storm early Friday
and then gathered strength, becoming a hurricane by afternoon when
it was just off the coast.
   It was the first hurricane of the 1988 Atlantic hurricane season
and the fourth named storm.

   A federal prosecutor recommended
members of a former ruling junta, including former President
Leopoldo Galtieri, be imprisoned from 15 to 20 years for starting
the 1982 Falklands War.
   Prosecutor Luis Moreno Ocampo told a Federal Appeals Court on
Friday that Gen. Galtieri, Adm. Jorge Anaya and Brig. Gen. Basilio
Lami Dozo were responsible for the loss to Britain of the 74-day
war and for the deaths of 712 Argentines killed in the conflict.
   In May 1986, the Armed Forces Supreme Council convicted all
three of misconduct for their command of the three military
branches in the war, which began after Argentine forces invaded the
disputed islands.
   The military court sentenced Galtieri to 12 years in military
prison, Anaya to 14 and Lami Dozo to eight. They were allowed to
keep their ranks pending the outcome of an automatic appeal to
civilian court.
   All three sought to have their convictions overturned, but
Moreno Ocampo asked for a 20-year prison term for Galtieri; 18
years for Anaya and 15 years for Lami Dozo.
   Also on trial are three lower-ranking officers who were
acquitted by the Supreme Council, Argentina's highest military
tribunal.
   Moreno Ocampo requested five years' prison for Vice Adm. Juan
Jose Lombardo; four years for Gen. Mario Menendez; and three years
for Gen. Omar Parada.
   Menendez was military governor of the Falklands during the war
and surrendered Argentine forces to the British on June 14, 1982,
at the capital of Port Stanley.
   Parada commanded army troops on the islands. Lombardo was
commander of navy forces in the South Atlantic.
   At issue is how the war was conducted. A military inquiry found
that Argentine troops were poorly trained, equipped and led.
   The inquiry focused in part on the decision by Anaya, a former
navy head, to virtually withdraw the fleet from combat after the
cruiser General Belgrano was sunk by a British submarine; and on
the strategy and tactics of Argentine soldiers on the islands.
   Since the appeal began July 26, Moreno tried to show that
Argentina's military rulers did not anticipate Britain's military
response, nor prepare for it.
   Defense attorneys argued that Argentina almost won the war, and
charges of incompetence were unfounded.
   Also, defense attorneys claimed Britain consistently refused to
negotiate the islands' return to Argentina, and such political
considerations should be taken into account.
   Britain's claim to the Falklands dates to 1833. Argentina claims
it inherited the islands, which it calls the Malvinas, upon
achieving independence from Spain in 1810.
   About 1,900 people, mostly sheep ranchers and fishermen, live on
the windswept islands.
   At war's outbreak, Argentina's economy was deteriorating and
opposition rising to the junta. The war was seen as a last-ditch
attempt by the military, in power since a 1976 coup, to gain public
support.
   The humiliating loss to Britain was followed by the military's
decision to turn over the government to an elected civilian leader.
In October 1983, attorney and human rights leader Raul Alfonsin was
elected president.
   A ruling by the four-man appeals court was not expected for
several weeks.

   Moviemaker George Lucas, known for creating
galaxies and planets far, far away, is getting into some
down-to-earth city planning.
   Part of his vision for Houston is a globe-shaped ``Lumisphere''
covered with glowing fiber optics and housing a theater that would
be the focal point of a $50 million downtown center adorned with
giant TV screens.
   The project by Lucas of ``Star Wars'' fame and Century
Development Corp. would transform the shell of the Albert Thomas
Convention Center into ``Luminaire Houston'' _ a complex of
restaurants, clubs, theaters and shops.
   ``This is a city that always goes for something futuristic and
something outstanding,'' Mayor Kathy Whitmire, citing the Johnson
Space Center, said Thursday.
   Completion of the project, which still requires City Council
approval, is scheduled by early 1992.
   Whitmire had named a task force to study renovating the Albert
Thomas center in 1985, and the group began exploring the notion of
a ``festival marketplace'' like the West End Market in Dallas or
Faneuil Hall in Boston.

   Actor John Mahoney has been in a spate of movies
as a heavy, but now he's getting a chance to play a good guy.
   He has turned up as the sinister judge in ``Suspect,'' the
drink-splashed teacher in ``Moonstruck,'' a bumbling U.S. consul in
``Frantic'' and a white supremacist farmer in ``Betrayal.''
   Now, he is portraying Chicago White Sox Manager Kid Gleason in
John Sayles' new movie, ``Eight Men Out.''
   ``He's a very decent man, and I haven't got to play too many of
those,'' the Chicago-based actor noted recently.
   Mahoney said he isn't certain why he often is cast as an
unsavory character, but thinks it may have something to do with the
role that first brought him to attention in the East.
   His New York stage debut was in ``Orphans,'' in a role that
Albert Finney later portrayed in the film version: ``A man you
could believe could smack you in two if he wanted to, but he was
also a very loving person.''
   After filming ``Eight Men Out,'' Mahoney is back to his old
tricks: playing a father who tries to break up his daughter's
romance in a movie called ``Say Anything,'' and ``a rotten, slimy
character'' in a miniseries called ``Favorite Son.''

   Gov. Wallace G. Wilkinson is getting his
middle initial back on highway signs welcoming travelers to the
Bluegrass State.
   Some of the signs at Kentucky's borders were missing the ``G.''
_ that stands for Glenn _ in Wilkinson's name.
   ``Obviously, it's not correct. That's not his name that he was
sworn in as governor,'' said Transportation Secretary Milo D.
Bryant, who is having the offending signs replaced.
   Bryant said an alert highway supervisor noticed that workers
were leaving out the ``G.'' Signs made since the discovery bear the

   Bryant estimated only 10 to 12 signs are being changed, at a
cost of perhaps $44 each.

   New York City Mayor Edward I. Koch, not
known for mincing his words, isn't shy about his gestures either.
   He answered a heckler with a vulgar gesture during a speech to
the New York City Police union's convention Thursday.
   The mayor was interrupted by a heckler who yelled an obscenity
as Koch spoke about last month's riot in a park on Manhattan's
Lower East Side.
   Koch responded by telling a joke. As part of the punch line, he
grabbed the crook of his right arm while lifting his right forearm.
``That's for you,'' he said to the heckler, prompting loud applause
and laughter.
   The convention, held in upstate Monticello, initially had given
a cool reception to Koch as he spoke about the Aug. 7 riot at
Tompkins Square Park, which broke out as police tried to enforce a
late-night curfew there.

   A tour bus with 42 people aboard rolled
off a muddy highway Friday in a remote area near the Canadian
border, killing one person and injuring at least 17, a state police
spokesman said.
   The accident near Eagle 110 miles east of Fairbanks near
Alaska's border with the Yukon Territory probably occurred shortly
before 3 p.m., when the bus ``went off a veritable cliff'' on the
Taylor Highway, State Troopers spokesman Bill Farber said in
Anchorage.
   One person died and 17 seriously injured people were taken to
Fairbanks Memorial Hospital, Farber said. Another 20 were in Eagle
awaiting transportation to an Army hospital at Fort Wainwright near
Fairbanks, where they were to be checked for injuries.
   Farber earlier said two people died and 15 were critically
injured, but said later that the conditions of the injured were not
known. He said communications with the accident scene were poor.
   The extent of injuries among the remaining five people on the
Gray Line of Alaska bus was not immediately known.
   Eight helicopters provided by the military, Alaska State
Troopers and a private company were sent to pick up victims, Farber
said.
   Fairbanks Memorial sent a team of doctors to Tok, which is 180
miles southeast of Fairbanks and 125 miles southwest of Eagle.
   A landing strip in the area was determined to be capable of
handling a C-130 airplane, and one of the aircraft was on standby
at Eielson Air Force Base in case additional help was needed,
Farber said.
   Rescuers were hampered by steep terrain, and three to four
people were required to carry just one accident victim up a hill,
he said.
   ``It's a real remote area,'' Farber said. He said the bus ran
off a serpentine stretch of highway pelted by rain for several days.
   Gray Line of Alaska said it sent an investigative team to the
scene and could offer no immediate information about the crash or
the passengers. A spokeswoman said most if not all of the
passengers were adults. The bus left Eagle Friday and was bound for
Tok on the company's Klondike Explorer tour.

   Utility and fire officials coping with downtown
Seattle's three-day power outage had a new worry Friday: what will
happen when the electricity goes back on, jolting equipment from
bank computers to appliances?
   ``It could be like opening floodgates,'' said Hugh McIntosh of
Seattle City Light, whose crews hoped by Sunday to relight a large
part of the city's retail and financial core, which has been
without power since Wednesday.
   Utility crews rigged lines from street lights outside the
affected area to provide street lighting Friday night for the first
time since the outage began. Traffic signals, however, remained
dark.
   If thousands of computers, lights, air conditioners and
appliances are on when power comes back, the load on the circuits
could cause a sudden voltage dip, McIntosh said.
   ``It would be like halftime during a ball game when everyone
flushes all the toilets and the water pressure drops,'' he said.
   That could damage computers and other appliances with
microprocessors, including videocassette recorders, televisions and
microwave ovens, he said. Further, it could trip sensitive
monitoring equipment at City Light's substation, causing another
blackout.
   ``The voltage drop can really foul up computers,'' McIntosh
said. ``It's not a fire threat, but we're concerned that it could
damage our equipment that controls power frequency _ and could
possibly cause the power to go back off.''
   McIntosh earlier said that refrigerator motors could be damaged
when power was restored, but said Friday evening he was
subsequently told that was not the case.
   Officials are concerned that if the extensively repaired
underground wiring has a short when power is turned back on, it
could lead to another fire like the one Wednesday that knocked out
power, McIntosh said.
   Officers at Great Northwest Federal Savings and Loan, located
one block south of where an underground electrical fire knocked out
power for hundreds of businesses, turned off their computer as a
precaution.
   ``We've turned off everything and intend to leave it that way
until things are back to normal,'' said Dianne Backus, division
manager.
   Like many downtown businesses, the savings and loan scaled back
operations in order to keep open at all. Ms. Backus helped staff a
card table where customers IDs were checked before they were let
into the saving and loan, two at a time, to make withdrawals for
the weekend.
   ``This is banking the way it used to be,'' she said. ``We're
taking down every transaction by hand and every couple of hours run
to one of our branches and enter everything into the computer.''
   Roy Davis, spokesman for the Seattle Fire Department, estimated
90 percent of the businesses were closed by the worst power outage
in city history.
   Regular checks were being made of fire alarm systems and at
apartment hotels where officials feared guests might be using
candles or gas-powered camping stoves.
   ``If we find anyone doing that we're going to cite them,'' said
Davis. ``Frankly this situation is new to us and we're a little
nervous. We've got several cars patrolling just to look for fires.''
   The party atmosphere of the first 24 hours without power faded
as hotel guests got over the novelty of being issued complimentary
flashlights and instead complained of 15-story climbs to rooms.
   ``I began to notice a little soreness in my calves yesterday,''
said Janet Hardin of Eaton, Ohio, a guest at the 40-story Westin
Hotel's south tower, which had just one of three elevators in
service.
   Westin officials tried to accommodate most guests in the hotel's
north tower where there was air conditioning to offset temperatures
in the mid-90s.
   ``Most people haven't complained about the heat,'' said Dior
Hill, public relations manager for the luxury hotel. ``To people
from Atlanta and Houston this is nothing unusual.''
   Downtown streets were slightly less crowded than usual. Sidewalk
generators drowned out the sounds of city buses and cars directed
by traffic cops standing in for powerless stoplights.
   By Friday afternoon' City Light crews had replaced about a mile
of cable burned by an unexplained fire in an underground vault.
Another mile still had to be replaced before the utility could turn
the power back on.
   Utility spokeswoman Julia Greenlee said superintendents of about
20 buildings would be asked to be on hand to turn their air
conditioning and other major equipment back on piece-by-piece to
help control surges.
   There have been no injuries reported during the power outage and
heavy police patrols have been credited with preventing break-ins.
   Police Lt. Al Lorette said 35 to 40 officers extra officers were
assigned to patrol the blacked-out area, in addition to about 40
officers who normally work downtown.
   ``You see what's on top of that car?'' Seattle police Officer
R.E. Lutz asked, gesturing to a police car with red and blue lights
on its roof. ``That's why there's no looting.''

<TEXT>
   A world-record lottery jackpot drew
entrants from as far away as England as 265 tickets a second were
sold for a shot at the $52 million Florida Lotto drawing tonight.
   ``We've got so many people running in and out of here. I had
somebody call at 6 o'clock this morning wanting to know if I was
open,'' Bill McMurtray, manager of the Sing convenience store and
gas station in Bradfordville near the Georgia line, said Friday.
   Lottery Secretary Rebecca Paul said she met a man from London
who read about the jackpot and flew to Florida to play.
   The record prize in the 4-month-old lottery also is attracting
droves of players from neighboring states.
   Eight of the state's top 10 ticket sellers are in the Panhandle
or northeast Florida counties bordering Alabama and Georgia,
neither of which has a legalized lottery, said lottery spokesman Ed
George.
   Half the sales at the Sing convenience store, about eight miles
south of the Georgia line, are to Georgia and Alabama residents.
One man purchased more than $500 worth of tickets Friday morning
for a lottery pool.
   ``He comes down every Friday,'' McMurtray said. ``The higher the
jackpot has been, the higher the influx of people from Georgia has
been.''
   The lottery's telephone hotline has been receiving calls from
out-of-state residents wanting to buy tickets without coming to
Florida. But Postal Service regulations prohibit selling lottery
tickets through the mail.
   Many Lotto players dreamed of what it would be like to win.
   ``Parties, trips, plays, travel. I'd throw a big party first
thing,'' said Gail Thomas, a Georgia juvenile detention officer who
bought her tickets in the border town of Iamonia.
   Pasco Donald, 74, said he would remember his 12 children, 60
grandchildren and more than 50 great-grandchildren.
   ``I'd give each of them $1,000,'' he said. ``Well, maybe some of
them. Not all of them.''
   Despite the 14-million-to-1 odds of winning, the $1 Lotto
tickets were selling at a rate of about 265 per second Friday, said
George.
   Last week about 32 million tickets were sold for a $32 million
jackpot. This week, officials expected sales to hit 40 million. The
pot has been climbing because no one has won since Aug. 6.
   Officials said half of any week's sales are usually made on
Saturdays before computerized ticket machines shut down at 10:30
p.m. for the 11 p.m. drawing, which is televised.
   California set the world lottery jackpot record in June with a
$51.4 million prize that went to two people, said Terri La Fleur, a
senior editor at Gaming and Wagering Business Magazine, a monthly
trade publication in New York.
   Sam Valenza, publisher of Lottery Players magazine in
Moorestown, N.J., agreed with La Fleur.
   California's biweekly numbers game took 20 months to produce the
prize. It took Florida only four months to break the California
mark. The increase in Florida's jackpot was aided by the stiff odds
against winning _ among the highest of any state lottery.
   Players select six numbers from 1 to 49 and mark their
selections on a computer card, which is read by a ticket machine.
   Spain's ``El Gordo'' lottery gave away $56 million in 1983, but
it was not a Lotto-style game.

<HEAD>Evangelist Oral Roberts Reaching Out For Followers' Soles</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TULSA, Okla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Television evangelist Oral Roberts is asking
his followers to follow in his footsteps in a plan to stamp the
name of Jesus on their soles _ of their footwear, that is.
   In a recent letter to contributors and ``prayer partners,''
Roberts encouraged them to write ``Jesus'' on the heels of their
shoes.
   ``As you put your foot down, know by your faith you're bruising
the devil's head,'' the evangelist wrote in the letter. ``The devil
should always see the sole of your shoe coming down on him.''
   ``I really get a kick out of doing this,'' Roberts says in the
letter.
   The recommendation is made to followers in a four-page mailing
in which Roberts also asks for contributions to maintain his
medical missions programs.
   Roberts provides a rectangle on one page for supporters to
outline the soles of their shoes with a pen.
   ``Then, right where the heel of your shoe is outlined, write the
word `Jesus,''' Roberts said in the letter.
   The shoe outline is ``a point of contact to release your faith
for your miracle,'' he said. ``I've done it and I want you to do
it.''
   But the name of Jesus shouldn't be limited to the paper outline,
Roberts said.
   ``Next, write `Jesus' on the bottom of your actual shoe heel.
You ought to see the bottom of my shoes _ `Jesus' is written on
them,'' he said. ``I'm serious about it.''

   A consumers advocacy group believes owners of
cars manufactured by Toyota should know about secret warranties the
Japanese company has on its vehicles and has asked the Federal
Trade Commission to order the automaker to directly notify
carowners.
   ``The Toyota documents clearly show that the company has an
internal policy that systematically reimburses consumers for
failure of specific components beyond the written warranty,'' said
Sam Cole of the Center for Auto Safety.
   ``Certainly ... every Toyota owner should be made aware,'' of
the policy, he said.
   The center, often critical of the automakers and their

<HEAD>800,000-Ton Corn Sale Reported</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Agriculture Department says the Soviet
Union has bought an additional 800,000 metric tons of U.S. corn for
delivery during the 1988-89 marketing year.
   The new purchase agreement announced Friday follows by one day
the kickoff of the marketing year and the sale of 100,000 tons of
corn to the Soviets, also for delivery in 1988-89.
   With corn prices currently averaging about $2.49 per bushel at
the farm level, the two sales could have a farm value of around
$88.4 million.
   A metric ton is about 2,205 pounds and is equal to 39.4 bushels
of corn or 36.7 bushels of wheat or soybeans. The 900,000 tons of
corn would be about 35.5 million bushels.
   Officials did not say whether the new sales would count under
the current five-year grain supply agreement between the two
countries that is set to expire Sept. 30.
   Negotiators are currently trying to work out a new pact, or an
extension of the current agreement, to take effect Oct. 1.

   Relatives of Americans who died in the Soviet
downing of a Korean airliner in 1983 marked the fifth anniversary
of the tragedy with a call for a full congressional investigation
into unanswered questions still surrounding the incident.
   ``It would be a dangerous precedent to let this matter fade into
oblivion,'' said Nan Oldham of Bethesda, Md., the mother of a
27-year-old man killed in the air disaster.
   ``It is fitting, indeed imperative, for Congress to conduct a
full-scale investigation,'' said Mrs. Oldham, co-chair of a family
members' organization, during a Friday news conference. ``Armed
with its subpoena power and the right to examine more than 1,200
still-classified documents, Congress can uncover the truth.''
   ``We feel betrayed by our government whose silence in this case,
rationalized by the questionable claim of national security
concerns, is beginning to resemble a deliberate cover-up,''she said.
   Sixty-three Americans were among the 269 people who died aboard
Korean Airlines Flight 007 when it was shot down on Sept. 1, 1983
after passing over Soviet territory while on a flight from
Anchorage. The plane had strayed more than 350 miles off course.

   President Jose Napoleon Duarte,
who has terminal cancer, told his countrymen he feels strong enough
to continue in his post.
   But in a Friday night address, he implied that if he becomes
incapacitated by his illness he will step down.
   ``I will continue working, continue governing, as long as I feel
I have the capability to do so,'' said Duarte, who looked gaunt and
whose voice sounded strained.
   ``If one day I feel incapable of doing that, my historic duty
would then be to make a decision,'' he said.
   ``I feel I have sufficient strength and capacity,'' the
62-year-old president said.
   Duarte's comments, broadcast nationwide on all radio and
television stations, were his first public statements since
returning Aug. 10 from Washington, where he received chemotherapy
for liver cancer.
   Duarte, who has lost 35 pounds during the past month and much of
his hair, spoke seated at a conference table surrounded by his
Cabinet ministers. He met with them for an hour Friday, the first
Cabinet session he has presided over in several weeks.
   Duarte's doctors said when the liver cancer was diagnosed in
June that he had between six and 18 months to live. The president's
five-year term ends June 1, 1989.

<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Opposition leader Kim Dae-jung said
today the military will never again seize power in South Korea, and
he said he is confident the nation will achieve political stability
after the Olympics.
   Kim also told The Associated Press that he doubted radical
students or communist North Korea would attempt to disrupt the
Olympic Games in Seoul.
   The head of the opposition Party for Peace and Democracy said
the political situation was complicated and uncertain, but he
believed democratic progress would continue after the Olympics.
   ``We feel that after the Olympic Games, our political situation
can be stable,'' he said.
   The armed forces will never rule the country again because the
South Korean people became too strong and mature to endure any more
military governments, Kim said.
   ``No general can dream of such a thing. Even if he takes power
through a military coup it cannot last long,'' he said.
   Kim played down concerns expressed by many Koreans about the
possibility of a government crackdown after the Olympics. Some
opposition leaders fear the government is being moderate to avoid
alienating world opinion during the Olympics but that there may be
a crackdown after the Games.
   South Korea has been ruled for most of its 40-year history by
authoritarian military and civilian leaders.
   The opposition leader said President Roh Tae-woo assured him
Wednesday that the military would declare its neutrality in
politics. ``We have agreed only democracy can solve our problems,''
he said.
   Kim did not say whether the opposition would try to force Roh to
hold a referendum on whether or not he should stay in power. Roh
said last year he would call for a refendum of some kind after the
Olympics.
   ``We are not in a hurry to expel him (Roh) from the political
arena,'' Kim said.
   Roh, a former general, defeated Kim and rival opposition leader
Kim Young-sam in December presidential elections. Roh replaced
former President Chun Doo-hwan, who took power with military
backing in 1980. The elections were called after massive
anti-government demonstrations.
   Kim said Roh must investigate and settle issues such as alleged
corruption in the Chun administration.
   The opposition leader also said he doubted radical students
would try to disrupt the Sept. 17-Oct. 2 Games with violent
demonstrations. ``The students know they will not be supported by
our people,'' he said.
   Kim said North Korea would not disrupt the Olympics because it
would be condemned worldwide.
   North Korea has said it will boycott the Olympics if it is not
allowed to be a co-host of the Games. The North's demand has been
rejected, but South Korean officials fear their communist archrival
may try to disrupt the Olympics.
   The one serious threat to the Olympics would appear to be
international terrorists, some of whom have ties with North Korea,
Kim said.

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   John Sasso, who had been there for Michael Dukakis
for a long time until about a year ago, is there again in time to
offer a familiar hand to his political friend.
   Dukakis once said Sasso is ``like a brother'' to him. ``He is a
very talented person,'' Dukakis told reporters Friday, adding:
``John didn't do anything that was illegal or dishonest. It was a
mistake in judgment.''
   ``I'm delighted to be back as part of the general election
team,'' Sasso said Friday, ``because I've always been committed to
Michael Dukakis.''
   Amid reports the campaign was sagging, Sasso returned to the
Dukakis fold as vice chairman of the Democratic presidential
nominee's effort after nearly a year away from the action.
   Sasso, one of the Massachusetts governor's most trusted aides,
resigned in the ``attack video'' incident that involved Sen. Joseph
Biden of Delaware who had been one of Dukakis' rivals for the
nomination.
   Sasso dropped out after admitting he had circulated a videotape
showing Biden using a British politician's words without credit.
Biden's campaign suffered and later ended following admissions of
plagiarism and false claims about his academic record.
   In coming back to work for Dukakis, Sasso apologized for the
incident and said he did not mean to raise questions about Biden's
character. Dukakis said Biden ``could not have been more gracious''
when told of Sasso's return. ``I continue to support Governor
Dukakis,'' Biden said in a statement.
   Sasso promised to ``adhere to the very high standards'' of
Dukakis and pay close attention to the words and actions of
Republican presidential nominee George Bush.
   ``There are contrasts and weaknesses that are issues in this
campaign,'' he said, adding: ``I will not shy away from pointing
those contrasts out.''
   Said Dukakis: ``Almost a year ago, John Sasso made a very
serious mistake.
   ``He's paid the price,'' the governor added.
   Sasso, 41, first met Dukakis on a train platform in 1978 at a
low point in the governor's political career. Dukakis, who had
sought renomination, had just lost to Democrat Edward J. King, and
Sasso offered to help if Dukakis ever decided to get back into
politics.
   Two years later, with Sasso aboard, Dukakis rode the comeback
train to win re-election in 1982. Dukakis installed Sasso as his
chief secretary, serving as his top contact with legislators and
handling media relations.

<TEXT>
   The nation's most powerful unmanned
rocket failed to lift a secret military satellite into the proper
orbit, effectively rendering it useless, according to a source
close to the space program.
   Engineers were trying to determine whether they could salvage
the satellite launched atop a 16-story Titan 34D Friday morning,
the source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said late Friday
night.
   However, the source was not hopeful anything could be done to
place it in the correct orbit.
   A civilian expert has said the booster carried a satellite that
could eavesdrop on Soviet military and diplomatic communications.
   A successful launch would have been the third in a row for the
Titan 34D, which was grounded for 18 months after two explosions.
   Lt. Col. Ron Rand, director of public affairs at the Eastern
Space and Missile Center here, said the Air Force had a policy of
not commenting on the results of military space launches.
   In Washington, Pentagon spokesman Maj. William O'Connell said he
knew of no problem with the launch.
   The three-stage Titan 34D roared away from its launch pad here
at 8:05 a.m Friday.
   The booster's third stage ignited correctly, putting the
satellite in a highly elliptical orbit ranging from 100 miles to
22,300 miles above the Earth, the source said.
   But the rocket failed to re-ignite, which would have put the
payload in a geosynchronous, or stationery, orbit 22,330 miles over
the Equator, said the source.
   A military reconnaissance satellite would be useless unless it
was in a geosynchronous orbit.
   The Air Force, following its practice of recent years, did not
announce the launch in advance, but issued a statement afterward.
   John E. Pike, a space policy expert for the Washington-based
Federation of American Scientists, said last month the payload
would be a satellite designed to monitor Soviet missile tests and
monitor radio, telephone, radar and other electronic military and
diplomatic communications.
   He said the satellite carried an antenna built to unfold to the
size of a baseball field.
   The launch was the third for the Titan 34D, which will remain
the nation's most powerful unmanned rocket until an upgraded
version, the Titan 4, makes its launch debut later this year, also
with a military satellite. Both are made by Martin Marietta Corp.
in Denver.
   A Titan 34D carrying a reconnaissance satellite was launched
successfully last October from Vandenberg Air Force Base, Calif.
Another blasted away from Cape Canaveral a month later and placed
into orbit a satellite to provide warning of a hostile missile
attack.
   Before the October launch, the Titan 34D had been grounded for
18 months following two straight explosions of the rocket.
   ``These two launches (from Canaveral) and last October's launch
(from Vandenberg) illustrate the success of America's return to a
more robust space-launch capability,'' the Air Force said in its
post-launch statement.
   During the long Titan 34D grounding, the Air Force was unable to
lift heavy military satellites into orbit because the only other
available carrier, the manned space shuttle, was grounded because
of the Challenger explosion in January 1986.
   That led to a critical backlog of military payloads waiting to
get into space. To help break that logjam, the Air Force is backing
development of Titan 4, Titan 2 and Delta 2 rocket systems. They
will make their first launches either late this year or early next
year, and are expected to see considerable use over several years.

   Authorities evacuated about 100,000
residents from low-lying areas in the outskirts of Dhaka today as
rising flood waters threatened new areas of the capital, officials
and witnesses said.
   Flood waters reached the streets of affluent residential
districts where most of the foreign diplomats live, witnesses said.
Many of the residents remained at home because flooded streets
prevent them from leaving.
   The U.S. Embassy building in the center of the city of 4 million
also was threatened.
   A security officer at the U.S. Embassy said the complex was dry,
but water was about ankle deep on the street in front of the
building. Water also was ankle deep around President Hussain
Mohammad Ershad's residence, said his press secretary, Toab Khan.
   At least 300,000 people have fled their homes in the countryside
and taken shelter in Dhaka after floods that inundated one-third of
Bangladesh. Floods are common each year in Bangladesh and last year
killed at least 1,500 people.
   The capital remained cut off for the second day because water
covered much of the airport's runway.
   The nationwide death toll from the annual floods that started in
June reached 842, news reports said. The government's toll,
regarded as understated, was 300.
   Independent Bengali-language newspaper, Sangbad, reported 84
people had died since Friday across Bangladesh. The paper said most
of the deaths were caused by collapsing houses.
   No deaths have been reported yet in Dhaka, where flood waters
range from a few inches in the center of the city to six feet in
the outskirts. Half of the city was affected.
   Many residents at relief camps set up in the city complained
that they were going hungry.
   ``We have been here for the past three days, there has been no
food nor any medicines from the government,'' said Saira Banu, who
has taken shelter in a relief camp along with her four children.
   On Friday, the Buriganga River, a tributary of the Ganges River,
was about three inches above the flood stage, its highest level in
34 years.
   The Flood Forcasting and Warning Center predicted today that the
river would rise another 5.2 inches.
   Residents were evaquated from low-lying areas near an embankment
that separates Dhaka from the Buriganga.
   Tens of thousands of people have taken shelter in schools,
government buildings and in 125 government-run relief camps in the
city. The influx triggered fears of food shortages in the capital.

<HEAD>Samurai Sales Hit Record In August Despite Rollover Concerns</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Boosted by rebates that could cut the sticker
price by almost 25 percent, U.S. sales of the Suzuki Samurai set a
record in August despite concerns about the four-wheel-drive
vehicle's safety.
   Official sales figures will not be reported until Tuesday, but
Douglas Mazza, general manager of Suzuki's automotive division,
said Friday he hoped the total would exceed 10,000 for the month.
   The surprising turnaround appears to be the result of the
generous dealer incentive program by the Japanese carmaker and
fading public concern about the rollover issue raised by Consumers
Union, publisher of Consumer Reports magazine.
   ``It will clearly be a record for our company, which is
impressive for 80 to 90 days from when our accuser first came at
us,'' Mazza said.
   Sales plummeted 70.6 percent in June to 2,199 after the June 2
report by Consumers Union. The group said the Suzuki Samurai's
center of gravity was too high, making it too likely to tip over
when the driver swerved sharply.
   American Suzuki produced its own tests and statistical evidence
to back its claim the Samurai was safe, and on July 13 announced
$2,000 incentives to dealers that made it possible for them to cut
a quarter of the Samurai's $7,995 base price.
   Samurai sales rose to 6,327 in July, about average.
   Sales from Aug. 1 through Friday, which is the end of the latest
reporting period, will smash the record of 8,365 set in July 1987,
said Laura Segall, of the public relations firm Rogers &
Associates, Suzuki's public relations agency.
   The dealer incentive program ended Friday, and the company and
its competitors will be watching closely to see whether the sales
momentum continues.
   Suzuki had been counting on a rebound in Samurai sales to create
a good atmosphere for the introduction this fall of two new
vehicles: a bigger, more powerful, more expensive sport-utility
vehicle named the Sidekick, and a passenger car named the Swift.
   The Sidekick is scheduled to be introduced this month. The Swift
will be introduced in October in a two-door hatchback version and
in November in a four-door hatchback model.
   The Samurai received a boost Thursday when the National Highway
Traffic Safety Administration turned down petitions to investigate
and recall the vehicle. The agency said the Samurai is no more
dangerous than similar vehicles made by other companies.
   The agency did grant a Consumers Union request to start a
rule-making procedure to establish a minimum standard for vehicles
to protect against rollovers.
   The Transportation Department agency said it had found 113
reported rollovers involving the Samurai and related vehicles made
by Suzuki, which resulted in 25 deaths and 120 injuries. But the
agency attributed many of the rollovers to unsafe driving, drinking
and unfamiliarity with the vehicles.
   American Suzuki, based in Brea, Calif., is the U.S. arm of
Japan's Suzuki Motor Co.

<TEXT>
   Four defiant Yonkers city councilmen held fast
to their refusal to bargain with a federal judge, sending their
troubled city toward bankruptcy for continuing to resist a
court-ordered desegregation plan.
   One day after he was given a green light by the U.S. Supreme
Court, U.S. District Judge Leonard Sand on Friday reimposed fines
on the city just north of New York that can soon amount to $1
million a day and bankrupt it in short order.
   The judge then unsuccessfully tried to work out a settlement in
informal talks with the recalcitrant councilmen, but the discussion
ended within an hour with the two sides apparently no closer to
agreement.
   In 1985, Sand found the city guilty of racially segregating
housing for four decades. The City Council has refused to approve
plans to build low- and moderate-income housing to aid
desegregation.
   The nation's highest court Thursday night affirmed the crippling
levy Sand imposed in his effort to bring the city into line with
the law.
   However, the court stayed the $500-a-day personal fines and jail
terms Sand had imposed on the four councilmen.
   Sand said that despite the stay, the councilmen ``still have a
responsibility to the citizens they represent who will bear the
brunt of these (city) fines.''
   Sand ordered the city to pay the fines accumulated over the
Labor Day weekend _ $192,000 _ on Tuesday. As previously promised
by Sand, more than $85,000 of the money will be earmarked for
Yonkers public schools and to guarantee the payment of interest on
city bonds. The balance will go to the U.S. Treasury and is
non-refundable.
   Sand then called on lawyers for all parties in the
long-simmering legal battle to meet with him privately ``to explore
informally some ideas we have for a possible solution of this
crisis.''
   Lawyers for both sides and city officials emerged tight-lipped
from the brief meeting in the New York courtroom.
   ``It was not successful,'' said Mayor Nicholas Wasicsko, who
favors complying with Sand's housing desegregation order.
   Michael Sussman, attorney for the National Association for the
Advancement of Colored People, said there was no progress and
called it a ``hostile discussion.''
   ``I haven't changed my position. I will do what I have to do,''
said Henry Spallone, one of the defiant councilmen.
   Sand told city attorney Michael Sculnick he could renew his
request that the judge stay the city fine ``if between now and
Tuesday when the $192,000 is due and payable, I am satisfied that
we have reached a point which makes it appropriate that the fines
be suspended or payments delayed.''
   The city's fine started at $100 on Aug. 2 and doubled daily for
a week until it was stayed pending appeals. The city has paid
$12,700 so far. The fine reaches its $1-million-a-day cap next
Friday.
   Gov. Mario Cuomo said he would direct the state's Emergency
Financial Control Board on Tuesday to begin making the substantial
reductions in city spending that will be required by Sand's order.
The board took control of the city's finances Aug. 9.
   Even with the cap on the fine, Yonkers, the state's
fourth-largest city with a population of 200,000, would be bankrupt
by mid-November, city officials said.
   Cuomo, who had been reluctant to get involved, said last week he
would initiate removal proceedings against the four councilmen if
the fines were reimposed against the New York suburb.
   The control board passed a resolution the same day saying it
would seek criminal charges against the four if the fines were
reinstated. The allegations would be that the four jeopardized the
city's fiscal condition, violating the law that established the
control board.
   However, Cuomo spokesman Gary Fryer said Friday that for the
time being the governor would not attempt to oust the councilmen.
   The Supreme Court's order late Thursday stayed a lower court
ruling that had upheld contempt citations against the four
councilmen, who had been paying their $500-a-day fines and would
have been subject to imprisonment this weekend.
   On Aug. 1, the council voted 4-3 against a desegregation plan
that would provide incentives to build 800 units of moderate-income
housing throughout the city. Sand found the councilmen in contempt
the next day and since then, three additional efforts to pass the
housing plan have failed.

   Hundreds of people, many wearing the uniforms of
three airlines, turned out to remember a veteran Delta Air Lines
flight attendant as funerals began for the 13 victims of the crash
of Flight 1141.
   ``Delta is just sort of a family,'' said Delta flight attendant
Karen Bounds. ``I'm coming out of respect.''
   Earlier Friday, more than 2,200 mourners gathered for services
for Phil and Thelma Vogel, who were instrumental in helping the
homeless in Dallas.
   About half of the approximately 300 people at the funeral Friday
night for attendant Rosilyn Marr were uniformed Delta flight
attendants and pilots, who were joined by a handful of flight
attendants from American Airlines and Braniff Airways.
   ``Ros was such a vivacious and outgoing kind of person and to
know her was to like her and to feel like you knew her well,'' the
Rev. Paul Ramler told mourners at Restland Funeral Home.
   Ms. Marr, 43, had flown with Delta since 1965 and was involved
in finding homes for stray pets, friends said.
   Three more funerals, including one for another flight attendant,
were scheduled today. Arrangements were pending in other cases.
   All 13 victims were from Texas.
   Ninety-five people survived when the Boeing 727, en route to
Salt Lake City, plunged to the ground and burst into flame seconds
after takeoff Wednesday at Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport.
   At the service for the Vogels, many of the mourners who filled
Congregation Shearith Israel synagogue said they knew the couple
personally.
   ``I look at you and I know you feel as I do. We feel ill
physically, spiritually, mentally, emotionally,'' said Rabbi Jordan
Ofseyer, who called the couple ``two of our finest, most useful
friends.''
   Vogel, 69, and his wife, 67, were traveling to Canada for a
vacation. They were remembered as tireless leaders of the Jewish
community and the city who worked quietly and without publicity.
   ``Even if she wasn't well, she called to see how you were
doing,'' said Geraldine Sobel, who knew the couple since 1962.
   In March 1987, the Dallas Jewish Coalition for the Homeless
opened a day-care center where homeless families searching for work
could leave their children. Mrs. Vogel was the driving force that
organized the coalition, a group of 26 Jewish organizations, while
her husband, a certified public accountant, helped with the group's
books.
   ``It's going to be hard without Thelma, but we can't let her
down because it was her dream,'' said Doris Budner, who with Mrs.
Vogel was co-coordinator of the coalition. ``I suppose we'll never
know, but I think the reason they are not here today is because
they were trying to help other people (out of the plane). That
would be like her.''
   Besides helping with the homeless coalition, Vogel was a member
of a number of civic, professional and religious organizations. He
was president of the Jewish Federation of Public Accountants and
president-elect of the Texas Association of Accountants.
   The couple had two grown sons.
   ``All of us are poorer for the tragic deaths we memorialized
this day,'' said Rabbi Gerald Klein. ``But, oh, how rich we are
because they lived among us.''

   Government officials have overestimated the amount
of meat available to the public for years by padding per capita
production statistics with animal fat and meat byproducts, Pravda
reported.
   In a lengthy article, the Communist Party daily reported serious
shortcomings in the country's meat production.
   Thursday's article told Soviets what most already knew, that the
Soviet Union doesn't produce enough meat to feed its people
properly. The story was part of a wider campaign launched since a
Communist Party meeting earlier this summer focusing attention on
food and consumer goods shortages and calling for a crash program
to improve supply and distribution.
   Pravda cited government statistics as claiming that each Soviet
consumed 141 pounds of meat last year, near the annual level of 154
pounds health officials recommend.
   It turns out the meat consumption figure for 1987 includes 1.6
million tons of animal fat and ``subproducts of a second category''
not containing meat, Pravda said. The ``subproducts'' include
heads, legs, ears and tripe. People were eating 13 pounds a year of
this kind of ``meat,'' Pravda said.
   The actual per capita consumption figure was closer to 128
pounds, Pravda said, but even that was unevenly distributed around
the country.
   The method of calculating the figure was drafted during the
``years of stagnation,'' the catchwords for the rule of Soviet
leader Leonid I. Brezhnev. The statistics were inflated to
``convince ourselves how well were were living,'' the newspaper
said.
   Under Brezhnev, and even before, government officials overstated
output of factories and farms they supervised to qualify for
bonuses and give the impression, often false, that they were
meeting government-set plan targets.
   The article was part of the campaign for ``glasnost,'' or
greater openness on some issues, encouraged by Soviet leader
Mikhail Gorbachev.

   The 51 contestants in this year's
Miss America Pageant checked out the competition as they spent
their first full day together.
   The competitors from the 50 states and the District of Columbia
were individually ushered around as they signed in Friday, posed
for photographers and chatted with reporters.
   Each day leading up to the Sept. 10 televised finale in the 62nd
pageant, the competition that starts Wednesday grows just a little.
   One of the first unofficial contests is the fashion parade upon
arrival.
   The outfits worn by the women as they arrived Thursday in this
seaside gambling resort were eye-catching, even if only the
hostesses and media were watching.
   Leather suits, stylish hats, patent leather high heels and belts
that emphasized tiny waists appeared to be the trend.
   But Friday was the big chance to make an early impression on the
other contestants, so even practice leotards were adorned with
jewelry and fingernails were perfectly manicured.
   Of course, most contestants don't openly admit they are sizing
up each others' chances at winning the crown and scholarship money.
   ``It's really neat. When you get a bunch of overachievers
together, we're all anxious to meet each other, not necessarily to
size up the competition,'' said Miss Iowa Tiffany Ann DiBernardo.
   ``We have a common bond,'' said Miss Nebraska Jodi Sue Miller.
``There were 78,000 girls in preliminary competitions narrowed down
to 51, so it's neat to compare goals _ and there are lots to
compare.''
   Miss North Carolina Lee Beaman said she was surprised ``at how
friendly the whole group was'' when the contestants met for the
first time. ``I was expecting a little more of conspicuously
checking out the competition.''
   Miss Vermont Julie Tidd conceded that the competitive spirit
``perhaps will come as time goes on this week.''
   The contestants already have had several opportunities to leave
marks of individuality. Each contestant wrote a greeting on a
wooden cutout of their state, which then was attached to a giant
wall map.
   Some focused on their talents, such as Miss Oklahoma Lori Lee
Kelley, a singer who wrote, ``Oklahoma is Opera-tunity!''
   Others focused on timely issues, such as Miss Iowa, who wrote,
``No drought about it _ success still grows!''
   In the middle of it all, three pigeons flew into the cavernous
Convention Center and decided to visit.
   In horror, the Miss America hostesses tried to shoo the birds
away, fearful that they would leave their ``calling cards'' on the
new pink carpet.
   ``If you do anything on this carpeting, I'll ...'' said hostess
Betty Frisch, chasing after a bird with a wagging finger.

   The position of wing flaps and slats on
the wreckage of Delta Flight 1141 conflicts with a crew member's
recollection and cockpit recordings indicating the crucial devices
were properly set for takeoff, investigators say.
   National Transportation Safety Board teams also have been
wrestling with a lack of physical evidence that would indicate the
Boeing 727 was having engine problems, as the cockpit recording and
witness accounts have suggested.
   Flight engineer Steven Judd, the first crew member interviewed
since Wednesday's crash, told investigators Friday that everything
aboard the jet seemed normal before takeoff.
   Thirteen people died when the jet crashed at the end of a
Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport runway and burst into
flames after what investigators said was an usually long takeoff
approach.
   Judd said the jet's right wing ``dropped severely'' as the plane
left the ground and that Capt. Larry Davis tried to take corrective
action. There were no abnormal engine sounds, Judd said, although
he recalled hearing the words ``engine failure.''
   That statement was picked up on cockpit voice recordings, as was
the preflight checklist of the wing flaps, NTSB member Lee
Dickinson said at a briefing Friday night.
   ``15, 15. Green light,'' Dickinson quoted a voice on the tape as
saying. That would seem to indicate both wing flaps were in the
proper 15-degree downward angle for takeoff, he said.
   Dickinson said Judd had the same recollection of the flaps'
position, which help provide the lift a plane needs to become
airborne.
   Investigators, however, said the flaps in the wreckage appeared
to be in the up position and the plane's slats, which are on the
forward edge of the wings, were found to be partially extended _
the opposite of the correct takeoff position.
   NTSB officials said locking devices on the slats likely would
have prevented them from being knocked out of position during the
crash.
   Investigators have also said the handle controlling the flaps
inside the cockpit was in the wrong position, but cautioned that it
could have been jarred out of place during the crash or the
evacuation of the crew.
   Federal investigators determined that the flaps and slats of a
Northwest Airlines MD-80 were not properly set for takeoff when
that plane crashed Aug. 16, 1987, at Detroit Metropolitan airport,
killing 156 people.
   Evidence also has not yet confirmed witness accounts that the
Delta jet's engines flared during takeoff, a phenomenon that could
indicate ``compressor stall'' within the engines, said Bernard
Loeb, the NTSB's deputy director of investigations.
   The plane left the gate at its scheduled departure time of 8:31
a.m., but did not take off for almost 30 minutes.
   Judd ``said he remembers that there were normal engine
indications'' and that other aspects of the takeoff were normal up
to and including the time the nose wheel left the ground, Dickinson
said.
   No signs of damage have been found on any of the plane's three
engines, which Dickinson said will be dismantled at the Hartford,
Conn., plant of their manufacturer, Pratt & Whitney.
   The engines were removed Friday and NTSB investigators were able
to get a better view, Dickinson said. ``They reiterated that there
was no visible evidence of any engine failure or any engine
problem,'' he said.
   Ninety-five of the 108 people on board survived, most by
scrambling out of emergency doors over the left wing and through a
crack between the cabin and cockpit.
   Nine victims found piled up at a rear door may have had trouble
opening the emergency exit, Loeb said. He said the problem may have
been the angle of the fuselage and the weight of the door, rather
than the design of the door.
   After the crash, it took more than one person to open the door,
Loeb said.
   Investigators hope the survival of the flight's cockpit crew
will make it easier to reconstruct the accident.
   They said they would wait until the pilot, Capt. Larry Davis,
and the first officer, Carey Wilson Kirkland Jr., were more fully
recovered before talking to them.
   Davis, 48, was in fair condition Friday at a Dallas hospital and
Kirkland, 37, was in stable condition at a suburban hospital.
   Services were held for three of the victims Friday. Three more
services were scheduled for today. All 13 victims were from Texas.

   Motorists in this western Massachusetts
town are faced with a whopping 400 percent increase in parking
meter costs _ from a penny to a nickel.
   Officials this week converted 425 penny parking meters to
instead require a nickel for the privilege of parking for half an
hour.
   The penny meters generated more than $8,000 anually in revenue,
said Department of Public Works Superintendent John Bean.
   Revenues are now expected to top $40,000 a year, Bean said.
   The conversion of the penny meters was first suggested by the
town's planning committee as a way to increase the turnover of
parking space, Bean said.
   The penny parking meters were believed to be among the last in
western Massachusetts.

   Robin Whelan is a real earth mother.
   Mrs. Whelan, who already has three sons born in quick
deliveries, gave birth to her fourth son on the hospital lawn when
she was unable to make it to the delivery room in time.
   Mrs. Whelan said that when she and her husband, Russell, arrived
at San Antonio Community Hospital on Wednesday night, nurses told
them their baby wasn't due until after midnight.
   ``I was afraid to go home for the mere fact I've had other
children so fast,'' said Mrs. Whelan, 26.
   So the Whelans sat in their van in the parking lot at the
hospital in San Bernardino County about 40 miles east of Los
Angeles.
   It wasn't long before the baby was on his way, so Whelan ran
back to the hospital to get help.
   ``I couldn't get back in the hospital because the door was
locked,'' said the 27-year-old father.
   Finally, he returned with a nurse. Mrs. Whelan, who found
herself unable to walk, was laid down on the lawn.
   A short time later, Chad Anthony Whelan, weighing 6 pounds, 10
ounces, was born. Mother and son were in excellent condition,
hospital officials said.
   When Whelan cut the umbilical cord, Mrs. Whelan and her baby
were covered with grass, he said.
   ``There I was, naked with all these people standing around,''
Mrs. Whelan said. ``I was just thankful it was at night and they
hadn't just watered the lawn.''

   A quiet, retiring giant panda, more inclined
to munch foilage than make a play for the spotlight, has become the
top draw at the Cincinnati Zoo.
   More than 60,000 people have tickets to see Chia Chia, the giant
male panda who goes on display today at the zoo, during his
three-month stay in a 5,000-mile journey to a breeding program in
Mexico.
   Chia Chia will be the most popular display ever at the zoo,
which will use profits from the exhibition for conservation of the
endangered pandas, the zoo said.
   ``It's the most charismatic and popular of all (the animals),''
said zoo Director Ed Maruska.
   The panda was flown from the London Zoo to Chicago, then taken
by van Friday to his temporary home in Cincinnati.
   The Toledo Zoo ran into opposition when it put two giant pandas
from China on display this summer, drawing charges it was
exploiting the animals. The World Wildlife Fund and the American
Association of Zoological Parks and Aquariums tried to prevent the
animals from being shipped out of Shanghai, but failed to get a
court order.
   Cincinnati's zoo avoided such controversy because it's only a
stopping-off point for an animal involved in a breeding program,
and because of its agreement to use money from the exhibit for
panda breeding and conservation programs.

   A train carrying soldiers rammed into a
stationary freight car in southern Zimbabwe, killing eight
soldiers, a newspaper said today.
   The crash happened late Thursday near Rutenga, about 260 miles
south of Harare, the Herald reported.
   The soldiers were traveling from Chicualacuala in neighboring
Mozambique, said the Herald, published by the state-owned Mass
Media Trust.
   No cause was given for the crash.
   Zimbabwe troops guard railroad installations in Mozambique
against attacks from right-wing rebels fighting to topple the

   A tour bus plunged 200 feet from a
muddy highway into a ravine in a remote area near the Canadian
border, killing a man and injuring at least 23 people, officials
said.
   The bus carrying 41 passengers and a driver left the Taylor
Highway 23 miles south of Eagle and 110 miles east of Fairbanks on
Friday after encountering a fuel truck while descending a hill,
State Troopers spokesman Bill Farber said here.
   Twenty-three passengers were hospitalized in Fairbanks,
including one person in intensive care, and the others were sent to
an Army hospital near Fairbanks for examination, Farber said.
   The driver, David Kasser, 24, of Anchorage, suffered superficial
injuries and shock, said Gray Line spokesman Dave Bean.
   Further information on the extent of the injuries and the
conditions of the injured was not immediately available.
   The accident near Canada's Yukon Territory probably occured just
before 3 p.m., when troopers in Anchorage learned of the crash,
Farber said.
   A physician and assistants from Tok 180 miles southeast of
Fairbanks were flown to the accident scene, Farber said. Eight
helicopters provided by the military, state troopers and a company
were dispatched to pick up the injured.
   The bus ``went off a veritable cliff,'' and rescue efforts were
hampered by the steep terrain, the spokesman said. Three or four
people were needed just to carry one victim up the hill.
   ``It's a real remote area,'' Farber said. He said the bus left a
serpentine stretch of highway pelted by rain for several days.
   The name of the man who was killed was not released. Gray Line
spokesman Dave Bean said the company would not release passengers'
names until relatives were notified of the accident.
   The company sent an investigative team to the scene. Kasser, who
has worked for Gray Line of Alaska for three years, was interviewed
by investigators after the accident, Bean said.
   The passengers were on the ninth day of a 15-day ``Klondike
Explorer'' tour of Alaska that included travel by boat, train and
plane, Bean said.

   Voters today chose a new generation of leaders
for this prosperous Asian city-state, but the prime minister since
1959 was not expected to retire from power.
   Voting was compulsory for those 21 or older and a heavy turnout
was expected before the polls closed at 8 p.m. (8 a.m. EDT). About
1.45 million people were eligible to cast ballots in the districts
contested. Election day was declared a national holiday.
   The governing People's Action Party was expected to win the
parliamentary election by a big margin. Prime Minister Lee Kuan
Yew, who will be 65 on Sept. 16, was expected to step down in favor
of First Deputy Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong, 46.
   Lee, who called the election ``truly a watershed,'' has been
prime minister since 1959 and more than half of the 2.6 million
people have known no other leader.
   Lee is to retain the powerful post as the governing party's
secretary-general, and, although he has expressed disinterest, is
still regarded as the most obvious candidate to be the country's
first elected president.
   The proposed elected presidency remained the key issue as the
nine-day campaign wound down Friday. It would replace the current
appointed ceremonial post with a president holding veto power over
spending the nation's ample financial reserves and nominations to
senior civil service and judicial positions.
   At stake in the election were 70 of the 81 seats in the recently
enlarged Parliament. The other 11 seats were captured unopposed by
the governing party when nominations closed Aug. 24.
   Nominees from seven opposition parties and four independent
candidates mounted a challenge. The last Parliament had 79 seats,
76 held by the governing party, one by the opposition and two
vacant when it was dissolved.
   There are 42 traditional single-member voting districts. But in
a new wrinkle, all parties entered in 13 constituencies had to
nominate a panel of three candidates _ at least one of whom had to
be from an ethnic minority group. Voters select a team of three,
each of whom gets a separate vote in parliament.
   The population is 76 percent Chinese, about 15 percent Malay and
6 percent Indians.
   Elections were called 16 months before a new election was
required.
   Diplomatic analysts said the government hoped to take advantage
of a booming economy and full employment with the early elections.

<TEXT>
   The first day of Florida's first legal
alligator hunt in 26 years netted about 130 gators across the
state, state game officials report.
   Thirty-eight of the huge reptiles were bagged in the Everglades
and 36 were taken near Lake Okeechobee, the Florida Game and Fresh
Water Fish Commission, which is supervising the hunt, said Friday.
   While some lucky hunters bagged animals as long as 9 feet, most
of the 230 people granted hunting permits were disappointed after
the first day of the monthlong gator season.
   The hunters selected at random from among about 5,000 permit
applicants set out at sunset Thursday with harpoons, nooses,
crossbows _ almost anything but a gun, which was forbidden.
   David and Jerry Navin, two novice hunters, snaked through a Dade
County canal in the darkness looking for the red-reflecting eyes
that give the reptiles away at night. But the gators refused to
play along.
   ``There's a few here, but they're not really doing what they're
supposed to,'' chuckled David Navin. ``They're a little tougher
than we thought.''
   Farther north on Lake Okeechobee, another of the designated
hunting areas, some gator pursuers fared better.
   Thomas Alpern, 25, of New York City, the only northerner to get
a permit, bagged a nine-footer despite worries he might not manage
to kill the animal even if he captured it.
   The meat and hide of a single alligator can fetch $300 to $500.
   The alligator population in Florida has about doubled to an
estimated 1 million since federal anti-poaching methods were
adopted in 1970. Nearly 1,000 gators have been captured in
experimental hunts since 1981.

   The prison terms handed a polygamist band
for a church bombing and police standoff that left a lawman dead
were blasted as overly lenient by Utah's top federal prosecutor.
   But Chief U.S. District Judge Bruce Jenkins, citing mandatory
sentencing guidelines, said Friday he had no choice but to set
prison terms of 15 years for clan ringleader Addam Swapp and five
years for Swapp's mother-in-law Vickie Singer.
   Swapp's brother, Jonathan Swapp, and Mrs. Singer's son, John
Timothy Singer, both 21, each received mandatory 10-year sentences
for a pair of firearms charges and five years probation on two
other counts.
   ``I've heard stronger sentencing comments (from a judge) in a
drunk driving case,'' said a livid U.S. Attorney Brent Ward, who
said he probably would appeal the sentences.
   ``Frankly, I was surprised,'' said Addam Swapp's attorney, John
Bucher.
   ``It was interesting, but it doesn't matter,'' Swapp said Friday
night. ``I've got little children who will be married in 15 years.
It might as well have been the death penalty to me.''
   Prosecutors said Swapp, 27, could have been imprisoned for 75
years and Mrs. Singer for 50 for their roles in the Jan. 16 bombing
of a Mormon chapel in Marion and a 13-day siege of their farm by
100 federal and state officers.
   ``I think once again that everyone involved in this whole
process continues to wonder why it ever occurred,'' Jenkins told
Mrs. Singer, 45, who tearfully begged him to free her.
   Jenkins said federal mandatory sentencing laws imposed by
Congress ``illustrate a crisis of the whole sentencing process.''
   As the defendants appeared before Jenkins in separate hearings,
the judge repeatedly stressed that their sentences were not the
decision of the court, but the will of Congress, ``which knows
nothing about this case.''
   The criticism of Congress infuriated Ward, who rose to defend
the statutes at the end of the day, then called a news conference.
   He said the sentences would be appealed on ground that Jenkins
declined to impose penalties on some counts and handed out what
prosecutors believe were less-than-minimum terms on others.
   ``There's no case I know of that more clearly shows the wisdom
of Congress in imposing minimum sentences,'' Ward said.
   If an appeal is filed, it could take as long as a year to
resolve the issue, he said.
   Such an action would not affect plans to file state murder
charges in the shooting death of state Corrections Lt. Fred House,
who was killed in the shootout that ended the siege Jan. 28, said
Ward.
   The family contended the bombing was ordered by God as a sign of
the impending collapse of the Mormon Church and all government, and
that it would trigger the return of patriarch John Singer, who was
slain by police nine years before for resisting arrest.
   A jury convicted the four clan members in May of 20 of 23 counts.
   Jenkins sentenced Swapp to consecutive, mandatory five-year
sentences for two firearms counts and for maliciously damaging the
church with a bomb. He stayed, pending successful completion of a
five-year probation, sentencing for attempted murder of federal
agents, forcibly resisting and assaulting agents and bomb
possession.
   He declined to sentence Swapp on a use-of-a-bomb count, saying
it duplicated the malicious damage count.
   Mrs. Singer's mandatory five-year term was for use of a firearm.
Jenkins declined to sentence her for bomb use. He stayed a
four-year sentence for malicious damage and a pair of two-year
sentences for forcible assault-resistance and bomb possession.
Violation of her five-year probation would force imposition of the
stayed sentences, a government attorney said.
   In addition to their mandatory 10-year terms on the firearms
counts, Jonathan Swapp and John Timothy Singer both received stayed
sentences for attempted murder and assaulting and resisting agents
pending successful completion of five years probation.

   A mother of five working in a Mister Softee ice
cream truck was shot to death by two men posing as customers as her
husband and two children watched, police said.
   Rosa Vera, 35, was at the sales window of the truck when gunmen
approached and signaled they wanted to buy ice cream Thursday
night, police said.
   When she opened the window, one of the gunmen fired, hitting her
in the head, police said Friday. She died five minutes later at St.
John's Episcopal Hospital, in the borough of Queens.
   ``She did not try to resist,'' said Detective Sgt. James
Harkins. ``Apparently the gunman fired right away.''
   Mrs. Vera's husband, Enrique, 34, who was driving the truck,
said he did not believe words were exchanged, but could not be sure
because of the noise from the truck's bells and music, Harkins said.
   Two of the couple's five sons, Pablo, 5, and Chris, 3, were at
their mother's side when she was shot, police said.
   There was no apparent motive for the killing, police said,
adding that no money was taken.

   Thunderstorms swept ahead of a slow-moving cold front across the
upper Great Lakes and middle Mississippi Valley today, bringing
heavy rain, strong winds and hail as big as golf balls.
   On Friday, the thunderstorms dropped heavy rain and hail in
parts of Wisconsin, Illinois, Iowa, Indiana and Missouri.
   In Wisconsin, golf ball-size hail pounded parts of Monona and
smaller hail hit spots in the northeast and south central parts of
the state.
   In southeast Missouri, thunderstorms brought heavy rain, leaving
some roads near Oran, Delta and southern Bollinger County under
water.
   Showers and thunderstorms hit western sections of Texas, as well
as the north and central parts of the state. Almost 3 inches of
rain fell in little more than an hour in Bonham, causing local
flooding. Some of the storms diminished in strength today.
   Thunderstorms also fizzled over northwest Arizona after whipping
up strong winds and heavy rains.
   Showers and thunderstorms were reported in eastern Texas,
Oklahoma, the Ohio Valley, the Gulf Coast, Florida, Alabama and the
lower Mississippi Valley.
   Today's forecast called for showers and thunderstorms from Texas
and the Gulf Coast to the lower Mississippi Valley, the Ohio
Valley, the eastern half of the Great Lakes and northern
Appalachians; numerous thunderstorms from northeast Texas to the
Ohio Valley and the lower Great Lakes; and scattered showers and
thunderstorms through Florida and mountainous areas of Arizona.
   High temperatures were forecast in the 70s through northeast
Minnesota and upper Michigan; the 70s along the Pacific Coast, as
well as in the northern and central Plains, western Texas, the
central and southern Rockies, most of the middle and upper
Mississippi Valley, the Great Lakes, the northern Appalachians and
northern New England; in the 90s in the Pacific Northwest; between
100 and 110 degrees over the desert Southwest and inland valleys of
California and Oregon; and in the 80s through the rest of the
nation.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 a.m. EDT ranged from 46
degrees at Yellowstone National Park, Wyo., to 94 degrees at Yuma,
Ariz.

   Hundreds of miners carrying a
Solidarity banner today ended a sit-in at a southern coal mine, and
workers in a northern port halted their strike, ending Poland's
worst labor unrest in seven years.
   About 250 dirty and unshaven workers left the July Manifesto
coal mine, where they had been holed up since Aug. 16. They carried
their belongings in plastic bags and sang the national anthem as
they walked through a heavy drizzle to a nearby church.
   Solidarity activist Jan Litynski said the miners agreed to halt
the strike early today after a night of talks with Solidarity
leader Lech Walesa.
   The end came on the eighth anniversary of the end of another
strike by Jastrzebie coal miners during the upheaval that gave rise
to Solidarity.
   Earlier, more than 2,000 port and transit workers in Szczecin
left the work sites they had occupied since Aug. 17. Artur Balasz,
a member of the strike committee there, said they ended the sit-in
despite worker allegations that the government had backed down on
promises of job security for strikers.
   The miners walked two miles to a Jastrzebie church, where a
priest celebrated Mass for them, their families and supporters from
other mines. Other miners waiting at the church chanted, ``Thank
you, thank you!'' as the July Manifesto miners arrived.
   A string of police vehicles pulled out of the city, road blocks
were dismantled and no strike banners remained at the mine.
   The nationwide strikes for legalization of Solidarity, higher
pay and better working conditons began at July Manifesto.
   At its peak, the unrest involved 20 enterprises employing
100,000 workers, including the Lenin shipyard in Gdansk where
Solidarity was born and where Walesa works as an electrician.
   On Wednesday, Walesa appealed for an end to the strikes so that
promised talks with the government could begin on the strikers'
demands. The July Manifesto workers demanded that Walesa explain
his appeal in person.
   The opposition and authorities were preparing lists of proposed
participants for the talks, said Roman Catholic mediator Jacek
Ambroziak in Warsaw.
   Walesa, who rose before dawn Friday and drove seven hours from
his Baltic coast home in Gdansk to the mine, pressed through the
afternoon until early today with miners to end the strike.
   A new round of negotiations with management was launched with
Walesa's participation and lasted into early today, said officials
at the mine.
   ``Everybody was very nervous throughout ... Walesa helped us out
a lot. He helped map the way out of our situation,'' said Grzegorz
Sawski, a member of the strike committee.
   The haggling concerned winning guarantees of job and personal
security for strikers, said a Polish journalist at the mine, who
asked not to be identified.
   The 1,800 dock workers and 600 bus depot workers in Szczecin
offered to end their strike as soon as job security was guaranteed
for strikers.
   ``This is an expression of support for Lech Walesa. We just
wanted to follow his suggestions,'' said Balasz, explaining why the
Szczecin workers were willing to end their strike.
   The Szczecin port and bus depot and the July Manifesto mine were
the only facilities still on strike as of Friday.
   Shipyard and port workers in Gdansk and steel workers in the
southeastern city of Stalowa Wola ended strikes Thursday after the
appeal from Walesa.
   At a meeting Wednesday with Interior Minister Czeslaw Kiszczak
and Alternate Politburo member Stanislaw Ciosek, Walensa's first
with senior authorities since 1982, they agreed to discuss
Solidarity's future and other issues shortly after the strikes
ended, Walesa said.
   Miners at the July Manifesto mine started to strike 19 days ago
after they received their paychecks. They demanded higher wages to
compensate for 60 percent inflation and incessant price inreases,
and they also demanded better working conditions.
   But like other strikers around the country, the No. 1 demand was
the restoration of Solidarity's legal status.
   Communist authorities first guaranteed the right to free trade
unions in an agreement signed Aug. 31, 1980, giving rise to
Solidarity. But the Soviet bloc's first independent trade union was
suppressed in the December 1981 martial law crackdown.
   Although formally outlawed in October 1982 it has survived,
first mainly as an underground organization and more openly in
recent years.

   A vaccine that blocks strep throat and
rheumatic fever has been successful with laboratory animals and may
be ready for human tests in six months, a medical researcher says.
   The vaccine is made through genetic engineering, by attaching
genes from streptococcal bacteria to a form of salmonella bacteria
rendered harmless in the laboratory.
   Edwin Beachey, a microbiology professor at the University of
Tennessee-Memphis, says mice given the vaccine withstood doses of
strep that were thousands of times greater than needed to trigger
an infection.
   He said Friday he is applying to the federal government and the
required review boards at the university to test the vaccine on
human beings.
   ``It's a new approach to vaccination with an engineered organism
and so it has to pass some standards that many review boards are
not quite used to,'' said Beachey, who also is director of research
at the Veterans Administration Medical Center in Memphis.
   Results of work on the vaccine were published last month in the
Journal of Experimental Medicine.
   The research was conducted by Beachey and Thomas Poirier of the
Memphis medical school and Michael Kehoe of the University of
Newcastle in London.
   They attached a strep gene to a weakened form of salmonella
bacteria that causes typhoid fever.
   The salmonella, which has been used for years in a typhoid fever
vaccine, was induced by the strep gene to produce a substance
called M protein, Beachey said.
   Given to laboratory mice, the salmonella died quickly in the
animals' intestines while the M protein led to the production of
antibodies for rheumatic fever.
   The weakened salmonella, genetically altered in 1985 by other
researchers, has been given to thousands of people to prevent
typhoid fever, but this is the first time it has been used to
transmit genetic material from another form of bacteria, Beachey
said.
   ``We're simply using it as a delivery vehicle where we can clone
another gene into it,'' he said. ``You sort of have a double barrel
here where you're not only vaccinating against typhoid but in the
same dose you're also vaccinating against strep sore throat and
rheumatic fever.''
   Rheumatic fever, which can cause fatal heart damage, is a major
health problem in Third World countries and incidents of the
disease appear to be on the increase in the United States, Beachey
said.
   ``It had declined over the last 20 years but in the last three
or four years it has been rising up again. Here in Memphis we used
to see maybe one or two cases a year and last year we saw 35,'' he
said.

   The most senior Shiite Moslem cleric in
Lebanon today blamed the United States for Parliament's failure to
elect a new president and said such a policy would backfire.
   ``If the Americans want to continue with their dangerous game,
then a force stronger than what they have known will explode in
their face,'' said the cleric, Sheik Mohammed Mehdi Shamseddin.
   ``What happened on Aug. 18 was an American-Israeli plot,'' said
Shamseddin, referring to the date on which Parliament failed to
muster the needed quorum of 51 members to elect a new president.
   The only serious candidate was Syrian-backed warlord Suleiman
Franjieh, 78. According to Lebanon's Constitution a new head of
state should be elected before Sept. 23, when the six-year term of
President Amin Gemayel expires.
   Parliament Speaker Hussein Husseini, a Shiite, adjourned the
abortive election session without setting a date for a new meeting
to elect a president.
   Syrian-backed leftist and Moslem factions have accused the
United States and the right-wing Christian Lebanese Forces militia,
which is sympathatic to Israel, of blocking Franjieh's election.
   Franjieh's backers have also accused the Lebanese Forces of
forcefully preventing deputies from attending the parliamentary
session to block the election of Franjieh, a personal friend of
Syrian President Hafez Assad.
   The Christian militia has denied the charge and said the
boycotters opposed Franjieh's election.
   A Lebanese Forces spokesman, who demanded anonymity, said there
will be ``no quorum as long as Franjieh remains a candidate.''
   This, in light of the present balance power, dimmed the
prospects of electing a new president.
   A U.S. State Department spokeswoman, Phyllis Oakley, has
attributed Parliament's failure to elect a new president for
war-torn Lebanon to the lack of a ``consensus candidate.''
   Shamseddin, addresing a news conference at his residence in
Moslem west Beirut, said the United States ``wants to end Syria's
regional (Middle Eastern) role to give Israel a free hand in
Lebanon.''
   ``We are determined not to succumb to the American stand,'' said
Shamseddin, who heads the Supreme Shiite Islamic Council in Lebanon.
   Syria, the main power broker in Lebanon, maintains 40,000 troops
in eastern and northern provinces as well as west and south Beirut.

   Firefighters held back flames threatening a town near
Yellowstone National Park, Utah homeowners cleared dry brush around
their property, and residents of Western states were warned to stay
out of the woods over Labor Day weekend.
   ``Ninety percent of the people out there this weekend will be in
areas where they shouldn't be building fires in the open,'' said
Kathy Albert of the U.S. Forest Service. ``They must be in
designated fire pits. We're pleading with people to be careful with
their fires.''
   Woods and fields also burned in Washington, Oregon, Montana,
Wyoming, Idaho and California as the worst wildfires in 30 years
raged on.
   In West Yellowstone, Mont., bulldozers, helicopters and
backfires stalled the advance of an 118,800-acre fire in the
neighboring park. Flames were a mile away Friday.
   Crews wrapped fire-retardant foil around the tiny town's
telephone poles, and rows of fire trucks tested their hoses in
parking lots.
   The firefighters received help from 50 farmers and others from
Ashton, Idaho, who hoped to lay two miles of pipeline, then pump
water from the Madison River to wet down the tinder-dry forest
floor between the town and the blaze.
   ``We shut our grain combine down to come up here,'' said Frank
Clark, 35, one of the volunteers. Despite losses the farmers will
suffer from being away at harvest time, ``it's never a hardship to
help out,'' he said.
   Although firefighters called their efforts a qualified success,
gusty winds swept a swath of flame south of town Friday, and a wind
change forecast for Monday also raised concern.
   Officials warned of a possible evacuation, and some guests in
the town's many motels checked out early. Most of the town's 750
permanent residents were sticking it out, though many filled gas
tanks and packed their cars in case.
   ``In my judgment this community is very defensible,'' Denny
Bungartz, the fire's incident commander, told a somber crowd of 60
townspeople Friday.
   The fire is one of six major blazes that have charred more than
550,000 acres of the 2.2 million-acre park this summer.
   Firefighters elsewhere in Montana mobilized to save a historic
dude ranch in the path of a giant fire north of Yellowstone. Fire
information officer Dave McMorran said three fire engines and a
20-member crew stood by at the Silvertip Ranch.
   In Utah, officials evacuated three mountain homes Friday night
and dug trenches around them as a runaway 550-acre brush fire raged
in a scenic canyon east of Salt Lake City. Residents of 40 other
homes were warned they may have to evacuate today.
   Many homeowners used chainsaws and weed trimmers to clear a
buffer zone around their homes. Others sat on their roofs, garden
hoses within reach.
   Officials asked residents in fire-prone states to stay out of
the woods this Labor Day weekend to reduce the danger of new blazes.
   In Idaho, the restrictions in certain forests included a ban on
firewood cutting for personal use and restrictions on chainsaws and
use of vehicles.
   Many forests in Oregon were closed to recreational use. Montana
officials urged residents to find alternatives to woodland
activities. Weyerhaeuser Co. and ITT Rayonier timberlands were
closed to the public in Washington.
   Smoke from fires in northeast Washington was so bad that a state
road was closed and another was limited to local traffic for 37
miles.

<TEXT>
   About 600 radical students denouncing
the ``war Olympics'' battled riot police today and hurled
firebombs, but troopers did not use tear gas because of a new
government ban.
   Communist North Korea, meanwhile, announced today it would
boycott the Sept. 17-Oct. 2 Olympics because its demand to be a
co-host had been rejected.
   The students, demanding the Olympics be shared with North Korea,
pelted troopers with scores of firebombs and rocks in a clash at
Sungkyunkwan University. Police hurled rocks and unexploded
firebombs back at the protesters, who also brandished iron bars and
wooden clubs.
   Several protesters and officers were injured, but police had no
figures.
   A declaration by the students said: ``If the Olympics cannot
help nurture a desirable atmosphere, they are nothing but divisive
Olympics, dictatorial Olympics and war Olympics.''
   Radical leaders claimed during a rally before the clash that the
Olympics were being used by the government to impose dictatorial
rule and increase the risk of war with the North.
   North Korea, in a report carried by its official Korean Central
News Agency, said the Olympics were being used to perpetuate the
division of the Korean peninsula and it urged other nations to back
its boycott.
   ``For us Olympic Games are important, but more important is the
future destiny of our entire nation. For this reason, we cannot
take part in the Olympic Games that is forced by single-handed
hosting,'' said the report, monitored in Tokyo.
   The agency, citing a statement released by the North's Olympic
committee, said the Games will be ``crippled'' by a boycott, but
only Cuba and Ethiopia have said they will back North Korea.
   The head of the Seoul Olympic Organizing Committee, Park
Seh-jik, said earlier today that Seoul would keep the door open
until the last day of the Olympics for North Korea to participate.
   The International Olympic Committee and South Korea said the
Games could not be shared because they are given to a single city.
Talks last month failed to produce an agreement between the two
Koreas on the Olympics.
   Park also said police would not use tear gas to disperse any
protests during the Olympics to avoid disruption. The gas used by
riot police during demonstrations often floats into residential and
business areas and the government does not want to spoil the Games.
   ``There will be no tear gas, even if one or two groups stage any
disruptive actions,'' Park said.
   Radicals have said they may stage protests during the Olympics.
The radicals, a small but powerful minority on campuses, lack
public support.
   Opposition leader Kim Dae-jung said today he doubted that the
radicals would attempt to disrupt the Olympics. ``The students know
they will not be supported by our people,'' Kim told The Associated
Press in an interview.
   Kim also played down any potential threat from North Korea.
   South Korean officials fear the North may attempt to sabotage
the Olympics. The two sides see the Olympics as a major symbol in
their struggle for dominance on the divided Korean peninsula.
   The peninsula was divided in 1945. The North invaded the South
in 1950 to start the Korean War and the border between the two
sides remains tense.

   A man who lost his $3,800 Rolex watch
when his Doberman pinscher puppy swallowed it a month ago got the
timepiece back _ still ticking.
   ``It had the right time and date,'' Scott Aszkenas said of his
timepiece Friday.
   The silver-and-gold watch disappeared about a month ago after it
popped off the newspaper photographer's wrist in his bedroom.
   Aszkenas said he suspected his 5-month-old Doberman, Sampson,
had swallowed the watch but couldn't feel it in his puppy's stomach
until Tuesday.
   ``I don't know how he swallowed it,'' he said.
   On Thursday, veterinarian Jim Grantham operated on the dog, and
retrieved the watch. The dog's stomach acids didn't damage the
Rolex.
   Grantham said he was a little surprised to spot the watch in an
X-ray Tuesday, but he's pulled a lot of things from pet stomachs _
like needles, tennis balls and pantyhose.
   ``If they chew them up, it's no problem. But large objects
always cause some damage going through,'' he said. He expects
Sampson will suffer from gastric ulcers for a few weeks.

halted international mail for the first time during the strike, the
workers' union said.
   The union representing 140,000 workers involved in sorting and
delivery mail is protesting pay bonuses that differ by regions and
the hiring of temporary employees to handle the mail backlog.
   Alan Tuffin, general secretary of the Royal Mail and the Union
of Communications Workers, said 15,000 of his members were off the
job Friday ``and by this morning that had risen to about 40,000.''
   A union spokesman said four large London sorting offices were
shut down by walkouts today, including Britain's largest foreign
mail depot.
   The spokesman, who demanded anonymously, said the dispute had
spread to Scotland, where about 3,500 postal workers walked out in
Glasgow after three colleagues were suspended for refusing to
handle letters brought in from strikebound Liverpool in northern
England.
   The union said all of south Wales and part of north Wales were
affected by the dispute, along with most of northwest and southeast
England. The post office later confirmed the union's information.
   Royal Mail receives about 50 million pieces of mail a day. A
backlog of more than 100 million pieces of mail began building
Wednesday with a 24-hour nationwide strike by sorters and
deliverers, the first since 1971.
   On Thursday and Friday, thousands of workers stopped work again
after Royal Mail brought in temporary employees to help clear the
backlog.

   Democratic presidential candidate
Michael Dukakis chided Republican rival George Bush today for
referring to the increase in the unemployment rate as
``irrelevant.''
   ``Yesterday, unemployment went up,'' Dukakis told an
early-morning rally. ``Another 200,000 people without jobs.
   ``The vice president said it was irrelevant. Those are people,
those are our fellow citizens. It's not irrelevant.''
   During campaign appearances Friday, Dukakis took aim at Dan
Quayle, the Republican vice presidential nominee.
   ``Dan Quayle doesn't know very much,'' Dukakis said when told
the Indiana senator had called him a big-spending liberal.
   In a brief exchange with reporters at the Sioux Falls airport,
Dukakis said: ``People like Quayle call themselves conservative.
They haven't voted for a balanced budget in their life.''
   In an interview with regional reporters at the airport in
Spokane, Wash., earlier in the day, the Democratic presidential
nominee responded sharply when asked if Quayle is qualified to be
vice president in an administration headed by Republican George
Bush.
   ``I don't know of anyone who thinks Dan Quayle is qualified to
be president,'' he said.
   ``Look at his record in the Congress, his lack of experience,''
said Dukakis. ``I don't think he was selected because he was
qualified to be president.''
   Dukakis was winding up a pre-Labor Day campaign swing with a
stop at Ellis Island, the first stop in America for his Greek
immigrant parents more than 75 years ago.
   Dukakis' father landed there in 1912 at the age of 16. His
mother was 9 when she arrive in America less than a year later.
   His mother, Euterpe, and New York Gov. Mario Cuomo were among
those joining Dukakis for the trip to the island in the New York
harbor where generations of immigrants landed.
   Dukakis' emphasis on his immigrant heritage is a major factor in
his bid for the support of blue collar voters, many of whom are
also first- or second-generation Americans.
   Although voters who retain strong identification with their
ethnic roots have traditionally been heavily Democratic in their
preference, they shifted allegiance to Republican Ronald Reagan in
1980 and 1984.
   The campaign swing included appearances in California, Oregon
and Washington and a brief sleep-and-refueling stop Friday night in
Sioux Falls.
   During stops in Portland, Ore., and Spokane, Wash., on Friday,
Dukakis ridiculed the idea of naming Quayle to head the war on
drugs in a Bush administration.
   ``Is there anybody here today, is there any citizen in the
United States of America, who thinks Dan Quayle is qualified to be
the nation's drug czar?'' he asked, drawing cheers and hoots from
partisan crowds.
   He repeatedly contrasted what he described as Quayle's
inexperience with the long career of Texas Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, the
Democratic vice presidential nominee.
   ``Isn't it nice to have a Democratic nominee for vice president
whose qualifications have never been questioned by anybody?'' he
said at a rally at a steelworkers union hall in Spokane.
   ``We're going to have a vice president who's been a leader'' in
the U.S. Senate, he told a rally in Portland, Ore.
   During a brief tour of a Kaiser Aluminum Co. plant in Spokane,
Dukakis wrote in big block letters on a roll of aluminum, ``MADE IN
USA.'' Workers cheered.

   A political foe of Prime Minister Rajiv
Gandhi was arrested today in connection with the slaying of India's
top badminton player after newspapers alleged he had an affair with
the sportsman's wife.
   Sanjay Singh, 32, was arrested in Lucknow, the capital of Uttar
Pradesh state, 250 miles southeast of New Delhi, said an official
of the Central Bureau of Investigation. The official cannot be
identified under briefing rules.
   The bureau, patterned on the United States' FBI, took over
investigations into the July 28 slaying of Syed Modi, the national
badminton champion, after a request from the Uttar Pradesh
government.
   Modi, 28, was gunned down by an assailant using a Colt
.38-caliber revolver as he stepped out of a Lucknow sports stadium
where he had gone for his customary evening round of practice.
   Newspapers, quoting unidentified sources in the Central Bureau
of Investigation, said last month that investigators had found
evidence of an affair between Modi's widow Ameeta and Singh. The
evidence followed days of searching for a motive to the slaying,
the sources said.
   On Aug. 16, an associate of Singh and three other people were
arrested on murder charges in Modi's death.
   Ameeta Modi was arrested on charges of conspiring to murder her
husband five days later. But she was released on bail by a
magistrate within three days when she said there was no one to care
for her 6-month-old daughter.
   In India, people charged with murder usually are not granted
bail.
   The allegations in the newspapers drew angry reactions from
Singh, a former Gandhi ally. ``This is the worst kind of political
vendetta,'' he said in New Delhi last week. ``The Prime Minister
and his coterie are using government agencies to intimidate the
opposition. Their plan is to discredit me in order to give Rajiv
Gandhi a victory in the next general elections.''
   Singh is not a political star outside Uttar Pradesh but he is
the scion of the former royal family of Amethi, Gandhi's
parliamentary constituency. Royal titles were abolished in 1971 but
members of ruling families still command considerable influence
over their former subjects.
   Singh was the campaign manager and chief architect of Gandhi's
mammoth victory from Amethi during the last national elections for
Parliament in 1985. The Prime Minister drew more than 90 percent of
the votes cast.
   But the two fell out last year. Singh resigned from the
governing Congress Party and vowed Gandhi will not win the next
election in Amethi.
   Singh's arrest follows several rounds of questioning by
detectives and a search of his Lucknow residence. The search drew
criticism from several opposition politicians because it was shown
on state-owned national television.
   ``They want to try Sanjay Singh through electronic media,'' said
Arif Mohammed Khan, who, like Singh, resigned from the Congress
Party year. ``They want to finish him.''

   As 18-year-old Dan Wolotsky unpacked his
clothes on orientation day at Wheaton College, he said he had
hardly thought about being in the first class of men admitted to
New England's oldest women's college.
   Until he received a letter from an upperclasswoman.
   ``She wrote me saying, `I hope you bring a stuffed animal
because everyone has one,''' recalled Wolotsky of Hightstown, N.J.
``That's when it dawned on me what I was doing. My uncle told me to
bring a bullfrog _ he said that'll scare them.''
   Wheaton is welcoming male students this fall for the first time
in its 154 years, a decision reached after a bitter stuggle with
alumnae who opposed the change. Seventy-five men will be in this
year's freshman class of 402.
   School officials said the decision to admit men to Wheaton is
part of the trend to make single-sex colleges coeducational because
newer generations of students demand it.
   ``The interest in going to a women's college has diminished,''
said Gail Weaver, director of admissions and student aid.
``Ninety-five percent of our women come from coeducational settings
where they've had the opportunity to be editor of the school paper
or class president and they've never felt discriminated against.
They feel there's no reason to buy into the argument that they need
to go to school with just women to succeed.''
   Weaver said fewer than 100 women's colleges remain in the
country. Almost half are small, church-related schools, she said.
   The transformation of Wheaton, which is 35 miles south of
Boston, to a coeducational school was rocky.
   Some alumnae balked when they learned of the January 1987
decision to admit men. They claimed that many alumnae donated to
the school in recent years without knowing of the plans eventually
to admit men.
   The matter went to court where, a probate judge ruled in June
that Wheaton must notify all donors that it will return their
donations if requested.
   ``It's a very sad day,'' said Mary Anne Marsh, 31, a 1979
graduate and one of the alumnae who protested. ``It's diminishing
what little opportunities are left to women who want to attend
small, liberal arts schools.''
   Administrators said little has been changed to accommodate men
on the idyllic 378-acre campus of brick buildings and a white
chapel.
   They were, however, forced to buy longer beds.
   And packages of toiletries distributed to incoming freshmen on
orientation day now include a separate package for men which,
several women noted, does not contain the laundry detergent given
women and has ``better razor blades.''
   The people most excited about men coming to Wheaton were, not
surprisingly, incoming women.
   ``I wouldn't be here if it wasn't coed,'' said Susan Howland,
18, of Lincoln, R.I., as she unpacked in her dormitory room
Thursday. ``I think it's going be fun. Maybe a little odd because
there aren't that many men.''
   ``I came basically because it was going coed,'' said Nadja
Drazien, 18, of Montreal. ``I think our society means that women
have to learn how to work alongside men.''
   School officials also had reason to be enthusiastic.
Administrators said enrollment has increased 30 percent since they
decided to admit men. The college will house 1,150 students this
year. Tuition is $16,700 a year.
   Like other men, Wolotsky is a little concerned that only one
sport will be available to men this fall: cross country. Officials
are building a new athletic facility that eventually will mean a
bigger sports program for men.
   Mark Sweet, 19, standing in line to register, said he wanted to
come to Wheaton because his two aunts and grandmother are alumnae.
He said he has endured some teasing from friends about being sought
after by women on campus.
   ``My first response is to tell them to shut up,'' said Sweet.
``I'm paying a lot to study and get a good education. My social
life is important but that's not what I'm paying $17,000 a year
for.''

   Michael Dukakis and a resurgent George Bush
are locked in an exquisitely close race for the White House as they
head into the fall campaign, according to an Associated Press
survey of the 50 states.
   ``It's going to be down and dirty to the very end,'' said
Republican State Rep. Tom Ryder of Illinois _ a key battleground
state where Republicans concede that Dukakis maintains a slight
edge.
   In Delaware, ``as in the rest of the country, there's been a
substantial shift in the last three weeks from Dukakis to Bush,''
said the state's GOP Gov. Michael N. Castle. ``I think it started
at the (Republican National) convention, as to be expected. But
since the convention, it's continued, even with the problems
surrounding the Dan Quayle candidacy.''
   The late-summer surge by Bush eroded Dukakis' earlier advantages
in key Electoral College battlegrounds from California to New
Jersey, with Illinois, Ohio and Michigan in between, say leaders in
both political parties. The result is a series of tight, big-states
races whose outcome will likely decide Ronald Reagan's successor in
the White House.
   Dukakis' selection of Texas Sen. Lloyd Bentsen as his vice
presidential running mate transformed Bush's adopted home state and
its 29 electoral votes into an instant toss-up. But Bush has
countered elsewhere: The vice president seemingly has moved ahead
in Florida, with 21 electoral votes, as well as making up ground in
the industrial Midwest. One poll in Massachusetts even rated
Dukakis' home state a toss-up, though the AP survey still found the
state to be solid ground for the Democratic nominee.
   In small states and large, the politicians who keep close tabs
on the presidential race report a close contest that is unlikely to
be decided until the final few days. Campaign debates and
unexpected international events could have a dramatic influence on
the race.
   ``I'd say right now it's a flip of the coin,'' said former Iowa
Democratic chairman Ed Campbell, reflecting the sentiment of party
professionals around the country. ``It could go either way.''
   Senior officials of the two campaigns pronounce themselves
pleased with the shape of the race.
   Said Susan Estrich, Dukakis' campaign manager, ``Nationally,
we're competitive. States will go up and down. It's exactly where
we thought it would be ... this is a very evenly matched contest.''
   ``We all felt like we'd be lucky if we were in the single
digits, meaning seven, eight, or nine points'' behind by Labor Day,
said Lee Atwater, Bush's campaign manager.
   Officials in both camps agree that the race is subject to sharp
swings, especially since neither candidate is an incumbent. That
heightens the importance of debates, currently the subject of
negotiations between the two campaigns. It also leaves the race
open to sudden shifts due to a mistake by either of the candidates
or their running mates, Democratic Sen. Bentsen and Republican Sen.
Dan Quayle, or to an unforseen international event.
   Rich Bond, a senior aide in the Bush camp, says the race shapes
up this way: ``Basically you've got a tight race with the South
looking pretty much George Bush's way. The West with the exception
of the Coast (California, Oregon and Washington) is heading our way
but can't be taken for granted.''
   Bond estimated that Bush heads into the race armed with a solid
150 to 200 electoral votes, principally from Southern and Rocky
Mountain States, and that Dukakis probably can count on a base of
150 electoral votes, largely from the Northeast.
   It takes 270 electoral votes to win the White House, and
Republicans have won four of the last five elections with solid
Southern and Western support. Jimmy Carter, a Southerner, is the
only Democrat to break the Republican string of victories in the
last 20 years.
   Democrats believe they can win electoral votes from each region
of the country and note that Bentsen's addition to the ticket makes
Texas and its 29 electoral votes an extremely competitive race.
Dukakis adviser Tom Kiley puts each candidate's reliable base
closer to 100 Electoral College votes.
   Even so, recent opinion polls indicate a dwindling advantage for
Dukakis is states he has long counted in his column, including
Maryland and West Virginia as well as Massachusetts.
   Charlie Baker, who is in charge of Dukakis field organization,
said the Democratic goal is to keep the race competitive in 45 or
46 states so that if the Republicans ``have a bad week they can
lose'' in any of them. ``And I think we can keep it that close,''
he said.
   With 10 weeks until election day, these are the straws in the
wind:
   _ California, the biggest state with 47 electoral votes, is
viewed by both sides as a key tossup state with a slight, initial
edge to Dukakis. The state was a tie in one recent poll. Dukakis
led in one recent poll in Oregon, and Washington was a tie in
another survey.
   _ Republicans express confidence they can virtually sweep the
Rocky Mountain region. Democrats hope to steal a state or two,
perhaps Colorado or New Mexico or Montana.
   _ The Deep South looks strong for the Republicans. Dukakis'
selection of Bentsen already has forced Bush to devote several days
to campaigning at home in Texas, but Republicans express confidence
they ultimately will win. Dukakis hopes to peel away a border state
or two, and maybe even challenge in North Carolina.
   _ The Northeast is Dukakis' home region and his strongest, from
New York to Massachusetts to Maryland. Both sides give the Democrat
the early edge in Pennsylvania. New Jersey and Connecticut have
recent Republican histories, but are key targets for both
candidates.
   _ The Midwest is wide open for both sides, although Quayle's
spot on the Republian ticket ended any talk of a Democratic
surprise in Indiana. Aside from Illinois, Michigan and Ohio,
Dukakis is viewed as the strong leader in Minnesota, and ahead less
convincingly in Wisconsin and Iowa. Bush led by 9 percentage points
in a recent Missouri poll, but Republicans rushed to say they
doubted either candidate could carry the state by that much.
Republicans expect to carry Nebraska and Kansas.
   Democrats say they have spent the past several weeks
methodically building a field organization, preparing television
commercials and mapping out their fall campaign, and that the race
won't be decided until the final days of the campaign.
   But where the Democrats sounded optimistic 10 weeks ago, now it
is the Republicans who have been heartened by their candidate's
late-summer offensive.
   Republicans concede Dukakis probably has the lead in Illinois
and a narrow advantage in Michigan and Ohio for the moment.
California was a dead heat in one recent poll.
   ``That's great news as far as I'm concerned,'' said the state's
GOP chairman, Bob Naylor. ``Three weeks ago it was looking peretty
grim.''

   Ralph Berthene looked forward to socializing
this weekend with 100 people from around the country who see things
the way he does _ from about 6 feet 5 inches up.
   ``It was a great experience to not have to stoop when you're
talking to somebody,'' the 32-year-old St. Paul man said of the
first time he went to a Twin Cities Tall Club event.
   The Minneapolis-St. Paul chapter is holding its annual weekend
get-together for members of the 50-year-old Tall Clubs
International, including a costume party, pig roast, dinner and
sightseeing tours.
   No basketball games were planned, says Chris Hager, president of
the Twin Cities' chapter, who just meets the women's height
requirement at 5-10. Men must be at least 6-2 to join.
   Members don't concentrate on activities celebrating their
tallness, but they do joke about it, and print the jokes on
T-shirts they sell, said Hager, 45, a heating company controller in
nearby Spring Park.
   ``One says `I may be the first to get rained on, but I'll be the
last to drown.' There's another one that says `No, I don't play
basketball. Do you play miniature golf?' The one I really like is
`Reach down and touch someone,''' said Hager.
   Berthene added quickly: ``We really don't have anything against
short people.''
   One chapter even has an annual baseball game with members of a
short people's club, Hager said.
   The tallest member in the clubs' history was the late Don
Koehler, an 8-foot-2 member from the Chicago area, said the clubs'
mere 5-foot-7 historian, Doris Chickering. The Highland, Md., woman
is an honorary member, ``married to a guy who is 6-2.''
   The 92-member Twin Cities chapter was founded 47 years ago and
serves Minnesota, Iowa and North and South Dakota.
   Having fun with other tall people was the main reason the
organization's founder, 6-foot-2 Kae Sumner Einfeldt, 72, of Santa
Cruz, Calif., started the Tip Toppers Club of Los Angeles.
   The retired free-lance commercial design artist, who worked on
``Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs,'' held the first meeting in
1938. She said she was inspired to start the ``world's highest
society'' by her work on Walt Disney's film.
   ``I like to tell people I got so sick and tired of looking at
dwarfs,'' she said. ``They used to call me the giant girl who
painted dwarfs for Disney.''
   Tall Clubs International claims 5,000 members and prospective
members in 50 clubs in this country and Canada. The 60 European
clubs have about 7,500 members.
   The clubs remain social organizations, but have begun working to
make life easier for a population that is growing taller, says the
past president of the international chapter, 6-foot-7 Carl Bouler,
52, of Phoenix, Ariz.
   Clothing and retail executives were invited to the clubs'
national convention last year to hear members' desires for better
selection among tall fashions, Bouler said.
   The clubs once urged an automaker to install telescoping
steering, and the company came out later with tilt steering wheels.
``I think we gave them the idea, although they never admitted it,''
Einfeldt said.
   Otherwise, gaining acceptance for attributes besides their
height has been a major accomplishment.
   ``It is very common when any number of us walk into a restaurant
or any other place that people turn and look at us because we are
tall. Tall people seem to be considered to have a lot of authority
by other people,'' Hager said.
   ``I don't think it's bad (but) I don't think a lot of us realize
we are treated as we are. ... We don't understand the authority we
are being given.''

   President Richard von Weizsaecker
today led mourners in a memorial service for victims of the
Ramstein air show disaster. Officials raised the death toll to 51
after two more people died.
   ``Pain and sorrow are tearing at the hearts of so many people,''
the Rev. Helmut Pflanz told about 400 West Germany, Italian and
American mourners crowded into the Roman Catholic Church of St.
Nicholas in Ramstein.
   ``We are deeply shocked by this catastrophe. So many people are
asking why this happened,'' Pflanz said. ``But there really is no
answer.''
   The service took place 1{ miles from the U.S. base, where the
disaster involving an Italian stunt-flying team occurred Sunday.
After three planes from the team collided, one fell into a crowd of
spectators and exploded.
   Hundreds of people stood in a light rain outside the small brick
church today before the German-American memorial service, which was
broadcast live on nationwide television.
   Several relatives of the dead, weeping and wringing their hands,
entered the church nearly an hour before the service started.
   Many Ramstein residents stood solemenly at their windows
watching the guests arrive. The skies over the town, usually filled
with military traffic headed towards Europe's largest military
base, were quiet.
   In addition to Weizsaecker, others attending the service were
U.S. Ambassador Richard Burt, base commander Gen. William Kirk and
Italian Defense Minister Valerio Zanone. Several relatives of the
victims also attended.
   ``Last Sunday, hundreds of thousands came to marvel at the
technology of flight and to admire those who have mastered it,''
Burt said.
   ``Sunday's tragedy has brought home to each of us the fragility
of life and made us recognize anew the limits to man's mastery of
his world.'' He added: ``We will ensure that such a tragedy is
never repeated.''
   The death toll climbed to 51 when Rhineland-Palatinate state
government spokesman Juergen Dietzen said two more West Germans
died. He said 165 people remained hospitalized and that more than
20 had life-threatening burns.
   Two Americans were among the dead _ a 9-year-old boy and his
mother. Air Force officials have identified them as Joshua Frymyer
and his mother, 36-year-old Army Pfc. Genevieve Riggs, who were
stationed in West Germany.
   Mrs. Riggs' husband, Army Sgt. Myron Riggs, was among the seven
people evacuated to the United States for treatment of burns. Ms.
White said the bodies of the mother and son were flown back to the
United States.

   Europe's largest aviation event, the Farnborough
Air Show, opens Sunday in southern England with daredevil
aerobatics scheduled to go ahead despite the air show disaster in
West Germany.
   ``If anything, the interest is greater,'' said Air Commodore Dan
Honley, spokesman for the organizers of the week-long show at
Farnborough, 35 miles southwest of London.
   ``Of course we are proud of the fact that our air displays are
the safest in the world _ we've been refining the rules for almost
40 years,'' Honley said in an interview.
   The British Red Arrows, the Royal Air Force's display team of
seven scarlet Hawk fighters, regularly thrill crowds at air shows
in Britain and abroad. They are to perform daily Wednesday through
next Sunday to a show that organizers say will attract about
350,000 visitors.
   But at Farnborough, among the world's biggest showcases of new
civil and military aircraft, air displays are a sideline to the
serious business of selling.
   This year 700 aerospace manufacturers from 24 countries,
including the United States and the Soviet Union, are showing their
wares. The organizers say sales could top $1.67 billion worth of
orders made during the last Farnborough show.
   For the first time, Soviet fighters are on display in the West.
   Two MiG-29s, the Soviet Union's newest and most advanced
warplanes, flew into Farnborough last week with a welcoming escort
of Royal Air Force Tornado fighters. They will go through their
paces daily, flying low over the Hampshire countryside.
   Also at Farnborough will be the latest versions of the U.S. F-16
and F-18 fighter-bombers and, making its air show debut, the U.S.
Marine Corps' Harrier 2.
   On the civil side, McDonnell Douglas is unveiling its MD-80
engine, whose representatives claim can save up to 40 percent in
fuel consumption.
   ``The aerospace industry is booming and the air transport
industry is booming,'' said Honley, deputy director of the
sponsoring Society of British Aerospace Companies.
   He predicted record orders for Farnborough, which alternates
with Le Bourget in Paris as host of the annual show.
   Farnborough opens under the shadow of last Sunday's disaster at
the Ramstein U.S. Air Force base when three aircraft of the Italian
Tricolored Arrows display team collided during a complex air
manuever.
   One of the aircraft crashed into the crowd and exploded.
Fifty-one people were killed, at least 170 are hospitalized and 15
remain unaccounted for.
   After the Ramstein disaster, West Germany suspended all air
displays amid growing calls for a permanent ban throughout the NATO
Western alliance.
   Honley said the Red Arrows operate under stringent safety rules
and are not permitted to perform directly over spectators or fly
toward them. The most hair-raising manuevers, when planes zoom
toward each other from opposite directions and then peel off, are
restricted to two aircraft.
   ``They'd never be allowed to do the sort of manuever that the
Italians did,'' Honley said. ``We'd never have five aircraft flying
one way, four the other and yet a third at a right angle to both
and that aircraft flying toward the crowds. In our opinion, that is
diabolical.''
   Farnborough, where pilots have to fly their displays in front of
a committee of experts before the show starts, has not had an
accident involving spectators since 1952, when a De Haviland jet
broke up in the air and killed 29 people on the ground.
   But with air shows in Europe claiming a rising toll, including
an Airbus crash in June that killed three people at Habsheim,
France, demands have grown for a ban on such events.
   Honley said: ``There are still sensible ways of flying displays.
The Red Arrows will put on a sensible display.''

<HEAD>FBI Looking For Woman Who Wrote To Ann Landers About Con Man</HEAD>
<DATELINE>EL PASO, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The FBI is looking for the woman who wrote
Ann Landers about a con man she married who could ``make you feel
like a million.''
   FBI agents say they may have the man.
   The FBI said it wants to contact the woman to see if she can
identify him as the tall, handsome military man who wooed her with
his smooth talk.
   The letter, signed ``Slow Learner'' of El Paso, appeared in Ann
Landers' advice column Aug. 30.
   The woman told Ms. Landers she realized the man had other wives
and was probably out to get her possessions, so she annulled the
marriage. She said she wrote to warn other would-be victims.
   ``I married a con man,'' the woman wrote. ``After the shame and
guilt subsided, I began to think a little more rationally. I wonder
how many others have had this experience. `I'm sure there are many,
but they are too embarrassed to admit it.
   ``He's a fabulous dancer, smooth talker and will make you feel
like a million. His line is irresistible, and his ultimate goal is
to `move in,''' she wrote.
   Agent Terry Kincaid of the FBI office in El Paso said that
agents in New Orleans arrested Byron Clovis Brant and that the man
sounds the one in the letter.
   The FBI reported Brant uses many aliases and may have victimized
women from California, Hawaii and the Midwest. Usually, he
impersonates a military officer but he also has impersonated a
doctor, the FBI said.
   ``He's a very accomplished dancer,'' Kincaid said Friday. ``He
has ... traveled throughout the country, preying on vulnerable
women.''
   The FBI called the Chicago office of the advice columnist but
the staff said the letter had no return address, Kincaid said. He
said the identity of the woman would be protected.
   The bureau knows of at least three women in their 40s who were
victimized and suspects there may be more, the FBI said.

<HEAD>Debate On Future Causes Friction Among Palestinians</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP Extra</HEAD>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>GAZA CITY, Occupied Gaza Strip (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Throughout the West Bank
and Gaza Strip, Palestinians are holding an intense and sometimes
violent debate on the wisdom of declaring a state and forming a
provisional government.
   Leading members of Yasser Arafat's Fatah faction of the
Palestine Liberation Organization have proposed recognizing Israel
and seeking international recognition for statehood on the West
Bank and Gaza Strip.
   These ideas are meeting surprisingly strong opposition from
Islamic groups and radical leftists.
   The misgivings prompted a recent decision to postpone until the
first week of October a meeting of the 447-seat Palestine National
Council, the PLO's parliament-in-exile.
   The debate also has touched off some inter-Palestinian violence.
Last month, for example, the car of a prominent Islamic
fundamentalist was firebombed in Gaza and PLO supporters were
blamed.
   Daoud Kuttab, a prominent journalist and leading advocate of the
provisional government idea, wrote in the weekly Al Sinara that
Palestinians ``should not hesitate'' or they would lose a golden
opportunity.
   ``One of the problems in the past has been that the PLO was too
tied to the principle of national consensus. You can't have total
agreement on every issue. The majority should decide. Having some
opposition, in fact, would be healthy,'' Kuttab said in an
interview.
   Kuttab argued a major benefit of changing from a guerrilla
organization to a provisional government would be an improvement of
the Palestinian image, especially in Western eyes.
   ``Instead of guerrilla fatigues, Arafat will be wearing a suit
and tie. It's a good idea to change the image of Palestinians as
revolutionaries, which is looked at negatively in the West,'' he
said.
   Kuttab said a provisional government also would have more
flexibility in negotiations and be able to change positions when
necessary in contrast with the PLO, which had to cling to
revolutionary ideals.
   Moslem fundamentalists of the Islamic Jihad (Holy War) and the
even harder line Hamas (Zeal) are opposed to the existence of a
Jewish state. They demand an Islamic state and remain outside the
PLO because it calls for a secular nation.
   ``I don't think it's the right time to establish a provisional
government or declare an independent state because the Palestinian
side is weak, and the weak are always commanded by the strong,''
said Ahmed Ismail Yassin, spiritual leader of the Islamic Jihad.
   Yassin, who is paralyzed and confined to a wheelchair, is a
charismatic figure who preaches in the Mujamaa Islami Mosque on a
dirt street in the run-down Sabra section of Gaza City. He was
released in a prisoner exchange in 1985 after being sentenced to 13
years in jail for financing Islamic militants.
   In an interview, Yassin said, ``If the PLO doesn't change some
of its ideas, there is no need for us to cooperate with them.''
   Yassin, who has hinted that fundamentalists may form an
alternative PLO if a secular state is declared, indicated he was
concerned about inter-Palestinian violence and warned it was a
``dangerous disease.''
   The Islamic militants broke off cooperation last spring with the
clandestine United National Leadership of the Uprising, which is
believed to be made up of representatives from the PLO factions.
   Both groups issue separate underground leaflets calling for
competing strikes and boycotts. They also proclaim their positions
in multi-colored graffiti that covers walls and shops throughout
the occupied lands.
   The slogans of the Islamic militants usually have a religious
theme: ``Our martyrs are in heaven, yours are in hell.''
   Criticism of Fatah's campaign also comes from the left.
   ``They (Fatah) are forcing the issue on which there is no
unanimity,'' said Haidar Abdel Shaafi, a prominent figure
associated with the Communists.
   Abdel Shafi, head of the Palestinian Red Crescent society, the
Moslem equivalent of the Red Cross, said he opposed for tactical
reasons making the concession of recognizing Israel in advance of
negotiations.
   ``The matter of recognizing the Jewish presence here is really
no longer in question. But how can I recognize Israel when Israel
does not recongize me, when Israel claims all of Palestinian to be
their territory,'' Abdel Shafi said.
   He said he hoped the Palestinian council would not take a
decison until after Israel's Nov. 1 elections so as to not to make
advance concessions.
   It is not known which group commands the most support, although
the conventional wisdom is that Islamic militants have the backing
of most of Gaza's 650,000 residents and Fatah controls most of the
West Bank's 850,000 Palestinians.
   Israel's Foreign Ministry has set up a special unit to monitor
the statements of prominent Palestinians on the issue, according to
sources who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   ``We are closely monitoring it. But it has com to the point
where we are taking seriously only decisions, not declarations,''
said one Foreign Ministry official.
   ``They always surprise us with their inability to decide, but
they are making a big mistake this time,'' he said. ``They are
going to disappoint people in the (occupied) territories.''

<HEAD>US Underestimated Soviets in Cuba During Missile Crisis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRYAN BRUMLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soviet scholars are shedding new light on the
1962 Cuban missile crisis, including the disclosure that Moscow had
twice as many troops in Cuba as the Kennedy administration
believed, says an American author.
   ``Startling new information will require a revision of
historical and analytic accounts of the events of the Cuban missile
crisis,'' Raymond L. Garthoff writes in the autumn edition of the
journal ``Foreign Policy.''
   Garthoff, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution and a
State Department participant in the crisis, based his article on
Soviet sources who under the policy of greater openness, or
``glasnost,'' are beginning to publicly discuss formerly taboo
subjects.
   Perhaps the most eye-opening revelation in Garthoff's article is
the presence in Cuba of 42,000 Soviet troops in the fall of 1962.
   ``While the United States had very good intelligence on the
missiles in Cuba in October and November 1962, its information on
the number of Soviet military personnel was weak,'' Garthoff wrote.
   ``Official U.S. intelligence estimates rose from 4,500 on
October 3, to some 8,000-10,000 by October 22, to 12,000-16,000 by
November 19, and finally to 22,000 in a retroactive estimate in
early 1963,'' he said.
   ``But, it turns out, this figure was still far too low. Years
later, Fidel Castro said the number was 40,000. Sergo Mikoyan (a
Soviet scholar) has now confirmed that the full Soviet military
complement in Cuba in October 1962 totaled 42,000 men,'' wrote
Garthoff.
   Among the other disclosures:
   _Nikita S. Khrushchev, then the Kremlin leader, decided to
secretly place nuclear-tipped SS-4 and SS-5 missiles in Cuba
without a formal decision by the ruling Politburo. Such
``voluntaristic'' actions led to Khrushchev's downfall two years
later.
   _Khrushchev considered running a naval blockade ordered by
President Kennedy, but was dissuaded by Anastas Mikoyan, then
deputy Soviet premier.
   _Khrushchev did not authorize a proposal by the KGB station
chief in Washington, Aleksandr Fomin, to U.S. journalist John Scali
that was long thought to have been the key to ending the crisis.
The deal, which was very close to the final resolution, called for
withdrawal of Soviet missiles from Cuba in return for removal of
U.S. missiles from Turkey.
   _Soviet leaders hurriedly cut a diplomatic deal to get their
missiles out of Cuba because they thought a U.S. invasion of the
Caribbean island was imminent.
   _The commander of Soviet forces in Cuba at the time was a
four-star general, Issa Pliyev, an odd choice because Pliyev was a
career cavalry officer unfamiliar with missiles and with only one
previous foreign assignment, in the Far East before and during
World War II.
   _The decision to shoot down a U.S. U-2 spy plane over Cuba
during the crisis was made by a Soviet one-star general on the
scene, Igor Statsenko, and surprised Khrushchev, helping spur him
to lower tension.
   Most of the new disclosures come from two intellectuals
associated with the reforms of Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev:
Fyodor Burlatski, who was a member of Khrushchev's inner circle,
and Sergo Mikoyan, who is the son of Anastas Mikoyan and is an
expert of Soviet-Cuban relations. Mikoyan drew on his father's
unpublished memoirs.
   Garthoff also quoted a number of unidentified Soviet officials
who he said are well-placed but not ready to step into the
spotlight.
   More disclosures are possbile at an international conference on
the Cuban missile crisis tentatively scheduled for January 1989 in
Moscow.
   Despite the disclosures, little is known about Soviet
decision-making in the crisis, prompting Garthoff to conclude that
``crisis management, even when handled well, is a poor alternative
to crisis prevention ... Glasnost, in policy as in politics and
history, can help avert new superpower crises.''
   And Garthoff said the Kremlin is placing more importance on
accurate historical analysis, a rarity before Gorbachev came to
power in March 1985.
   ``For nearly two decades before 1985 the name Nikita Khrushchev
... was absent from the brief, occasional and carefully
circumscribed Soviet accounts of the crisis,'' Garthoff wrote.
``Some writers even managed to address the topic without mentioning
the presence in and removal from Cuba of Soviet missiles.''
   He said more recent Soviet articles have been more balanced, but
added, ``New light on Moscow's key decisions in the crisis has
scarcely begun to appear in the Soviet media _ although it probably
will within the year.''

   A leak of chlorine gas from an
industrial plant forced the evacuation today of an estimated 20,000
people east of Los Angeles, and seven people were taken to
hospitals, officials said.
   The chemical cloud, measuring more than a half-mile long, formed
early this morning, said Los Angeles County Sheriff's Deputy Dan
Cox.
   Firefighters and sheriff's deputies evacuated 20,000 from
surrounding neighborhoods, about 10 miles east of downtown Los
Angeles, said Deputy Van Mosley. Wind was light and variable,
according to the National Weather Service.
   Wispy, smoky-gray fumes poured from the Grow Group Inc. plant,
which makes chlorine tablets for swimming pools, said Kim Marti,
plant manager.
   It was not immediately known if the leak had been stopped by
morning.
   Marti said a chemical reaction produced the chlorine, which can
be lethal in high concentrations but otherwise causes burning eyes
and sore throats.
   ``Until we get in there and identify what caused the reaction, I
can't tell you. I don't know,'' Marti said.
   The manager said the the plant was closed at the time of the
incident, which was reported to county officials at 12:19 a.m.
``The sheriff's department woke us up,'' Marti said.
   Three people were in stable condition at Santa Marta Hospital
and Clinic, said nursing supervisor Verna Brinson.
   Four others with respiratory complaints were treated at
County-USC Medical Center and released, said Norka Manning, a
hospital spokeswoman.
   Firefighters sent a hazardous materials unit, which requested
soda ash to stabilize the chemical, said Hubert Parker, a spokesman
for the county Fire Department.
   The area evacuated comprised several square miles in portions of
East Los Angeles, Monterey Park, Montebello and Commerce,
authorities said.
   ``We're evacuating the whole southern end of our city,'' said
Monterey Park police Officer Frank Valiente. ``We don't know when
we're going to allow them to come back.''
   Residents were sent to several high schools where the Red Cross
had set up emergency shelters.
   As the huge cloud began drifting to the southwest, it threatened
to close Interstate 5, one of the busiest freeways in Southern
California. The California Highway Patrol closed an exit ramp along
the freeway, the southern boundary of the evacuated area.

<HEAD>Cuba: A Thoroughly Militarized Country</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE GEDDA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Cuba has become one of the most heavily
militarized countries in the world, with more than 250,000
personnel under arms and another 1.5 million in militia units,
according to U.S. government and independent sources.
   By lavishing attention and resources on the military and with a
substantial assist from the Soviet Union, Cuba can send large
numbers of troops on foreign expeditions without sacrificing its
ability to defend its own territory.
   There are an estimated 60,000 Cubans serving in Angola, a figure
which exceeds by more than 20,000 the size of the army of the
military dictatorship that preceded President Fidel Castro's rise
to power almost 30 years ago.
   State Department figures indicate that in Latin America, only
Brazil _ with a population 13 times Cuba's _ has a comparable
military establishment.
   A recent article in the monthly magazine Atlantic said that Cuba
has 250 combat aircraft, mostly Soviet-made MiG's, compared with
only 45 for Canada, a country with 2{ times the population and a
vastly larger land area.
   Cuba also has about 950 battle tanks _ some in Angola _ compared
with Canada's 114, the article said. All of the equipment is
delivered for free by the Soviet Union.
   Cuba spent an estimated 10 per cent of its government budget on
the military in 1985, higher than all but a few countries worldwide.
   The Cuban troop presence in Angola has been a sore point for the
Reagan administration, which has been trying through diplomatic
talks to encourage a withdrawal.
   The talks have produced agreement on a statement of principles
by the parties, but critics point out there are 40,000 more Cuban
troops in Angola than when U.S. diplomats undertook their
initiative more than seven years ago.
   In ``The Evolution of the Cuban Military,'' Cuban affairs expert
Rafael Fermoselle wrote that Cuba has remained in a high state of
combat readiness since the early 1960s but starting in 1980,
``Castro has placed the whole country on a wartime footing without
parallel.''
   In that year, Castro began organizing the so-called Territorial
Troop Militias, known by its Spanish initials MTT, in response to
his stated concern that Ronald Reagan, a presidential nominee at
the time, posed a threat to the revolution.
   By incorporating most able-bodied citizens, including women,
into a national defense structure, Castro felt that no invading
force could conquer Cuba. The United States could defeat the Cuban
army but not an entire people, according to the theory.
   In his Atlantic article, author John Hoyt Williams estimated
that there were 1.5 million armed and trained men and women in the
MTT's by 1986, arrayed in about 1,000 regiments.
   ``Japan in the summer of 1945 was not nearly so well prepared to
resist invasion,'' Williams wrote.
   An added defense mechanism is the Committees for the Defense of
the Revolution, with a 1986 membership of 6.6 million. The
committees, set up on a block-by-block basis, watch for subversion
and counter-revolutionary activity.
   Most troubling to the Reagan administration has been Cuba's
willingness to deploy military forces abroad. Angola has been
Cuba's most ambitious venture but Cubans have been stationed in
Ghana, Algeria, Guinea-Bissau, Ethiopia, South Yemen, Syria and
elsewhere.
   In the Western Hemisphere, there are at least several hundred
Cuban military advisers in Nicaragua. Cuba also had a military
presence in Grenada until the 1983 U.S. invasion toppled the
leftist government there.
   A State Department report says that Cuba ``has developed an
extraordinary capacity to influence events'' in distant lands.
   ``Its ability to project power far out of proportion to its size
is directly related to its association with the Soviet Union and
Soviet support for the development of its military machine,'' the
report says.

   The Justice Department has officially ended
its inquiry into the assassinations of John F. Kennedy and Martin
Luther King Jr., finding ``no persuasive evidence'' to support
conspiracy theories, according to department documents.
   A Justice Department memo, obtained by a California
ophthalmologist through the Freedom of Information Act, was the
department's admittedly long-overdue response to the House Select
Committee on Assassinations' recommendation 10 years ago for
further investigation.
   William F. Weld, who was head of the department's criminal
division until he quit at the end of March, told Rep. Peter Rodino,
D-N.J., chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, that all known
leads have been checked.
   ``The Department of Justice has concluded that no persuasive
evidence can be identified to support the theory of a conspiracy in
either the assassination of President Kennedy or the assassination
of Dr. King,'' Weld wrote in the undated memo.
   ``No further investigation appears to be warranted in either
matter unless new information which is sufficient to support
additional investigative activity becomes available,'' he added.
   The Justice Department's response to the conspiracy theories
comes as no surprise. It is, however, the first time the department
has made a formal conclusion on the assassinations, said Justice
spokesman Dean St. Dennis.
   The House Assassinations Committee concluded in 1978 that
Kennedy was ``probably'' assassinated as the result of a conspiracy
involving a second gunman, a finding that broke from the Warren
Commission's belief that Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone in Dallas on
Nov. 22, 1963. The House panel also said there was a ``likelihood''
that King's slaying in 1968 was part of a conspiracy.
   The committee urged the Justice Department to investigate
several areas of the assassinations, and one year later the
department agreed to conduct a limited inquiry focusing on an
acoustical study presented to the committee by independent experts.
   The acoustical experts had concluded after studying a Dictaphone
recording of a Dallas policeman's open radio transmissions that
there was a second gunman on the infamous grassy knoll who fired a
fourth shot. That evidence was the key to the committee's
second-gunman conclusion.
   Justice officials instructed the National Academy of Sciences to
review that study and the Dictaphone recording, and academy
scientists concluded in 1982 that the independent experts were
wrong.
   Weld said the Justice Department had completed ``virtually all''
of its inquiry by the end of 1983, but delayed its response to the
House Judiciary Committee ``pending a complete review of all public
comment'' on the National Academy study.
   ``We have considered the review of all correspondence to be
potentially productive,'' he said. But he said there was no
``persuasive criticism'' of the academy report, so the Justice
Department has accepted its conclusions.
   Others, including Rep. Louis Stokes, D-Ohio, chairman of the
defunct assassinations committee, have stood by the committee's
conclusions and the acoustical evidence presented by the
independent team.
   Stokes could not be reached for comment Friday, but a former
select committee aide who has fought to have the panel's records
opened to the public blasted the department's response.
   ``All these years later we find out they've been doing
nothing,'' said Kevin Walsh. ``Members themselves had faith that
the Justice Department was going to pursue this, and now we see all
these years later that their faith was misplaced.''
   Walsh noted that the department did not follow through on
several parts of the select committee's recommendations.
   The ``most egregious sin,'' according to Walsh, was the
department's failure to obtain and analyze a bystander's film shot
just minutes before the Kennedy assassination. The film by Charles
L. Bronson scans the sixth-floor window of the Texas School Book
Depository, where Oswald was positioned.
   ``If you have film footage that bears on a murder case, you
subpoena it,'' Walsh said. ``They didn't even consider it.''
   Weld wrote that the department was unable to obtain the film
from the owner.
   The Justice Department conceded that the report to Rodino's
committee was ``long overdue.''
   ``One of the interesting features of employment with a large
governmental organization is that matters occasionally come
bubbling to the surface from the depths of the bureaucracy,''
Acting Assistant Attorney General Thomas M. Boyd wrote in a letter
to Rodino accompanying the Weld memo. ``An example of this
phenomenon is the enclosed report which relates back to the
activities of the Select Committee on Assassinations.''
   Boyd's letter to Rodino was dated March 28 and accompanied the
memo from Weld.
   The documents were sent to Dr. Louis P. Kartsonis, a San Diego
ophthalmologist, on a Freedom of Information Act request he made
through Sen. Alan Cranston, D-Calif., and Rep. Bill Lowery, R-Calif.
   Kartsonis said he has conducted research and delivered lectures
on the Kennedy assassination for more than 15 years. He, too,
criticized the Justice Department's inquiry, saying investigators
failed to answer the select committee's questions.

   Congress returns this week to a full agenda of
budget and spending bills, Contra aid, welfare reform and anti-drug
legislation, but eyeing an early adjournment so lawmakers can
campaign for re-election.
   The House and Senate aim to complete work by Sept. 30. All 435
House seats and 33 of the 100 Senate seats will be up for grabs on
Election Day Nov. 8.
   Despite the wide assortment of issues Congress has to deal with,
the agenda will be chiefly driven by attempts to enact a Pentagon
budget bill and 11 separate spending measures by the Oct. 1
beginning of the new fiscal year.
   Only two of the 13 appropriations bills needed to finance the
government have been passed and signed into law.
   ``Defense will certainly be the big thing that we have to agree
on. I'm pretty optimistic that everything else can be worked out,''
Sen. Pete Domenici, R-N.M., ranking Republican on the Senate Budget
Committee, said last week.
   Sen. David Pryor, D-Ark., agreed.
   ``I think the defense budget will be a large part of the agenda.
All the other issues will fall into place because people want to
get out for the election,'' he said.
   Reagan last month vetoed the first Pentagon budget bill sent him
by the Democratic-controlled Congress because he objected to arms
control restrictions and cuts in his proposed Star Wars budget.
   The Senate has passed a second defense budget, which includes
the same proposed Star Wars slashes but none of the arms control
limitations.
   When lawmakers return, a House-Senate conference committee will
try to write a compromise bill that Reagan might sign. One of the
conferees will be Sen. Dan Quayle of Indiana, the Republican vice
presidential nominee.
   The Senate version of the defense bill also includes a
Democratic-backed Contra aid proposal, which the House is likely to
approve with few changes. The current Contra aid plan expires Sept.
30, but the new plan calls for $27 million in non-lethal aid _
food, clothing, and shelter _ and sets up procedures for a
subsequent vote on releasing $16.5 million in frozen military
supplies.
   If Reagan requests the military aid, House Speaker Jim Wright,
D-Texas, has vowed not to stand in the way of a vote.
   The Senate is trying to avoid a large catch-all spending bill.
Last year's measure, known as a continuing resolution, merged all
13 appropriation bills and was 1,057 pages long. In his State of
the Union address in January, Reagan threatened to veto a
similar-size bill this year.
   ``I think we can avoid a big one this year,'' said Domenici.
``We may end up with a small one, but it won't be anything like
what happened last December.''
   The spending fights will be played out against the backdrop of a
presidential race in which two senators are the major party vice
presidential candidates. Sen. Lloyd Bentsen of Texas is the
Democratic nominee.
   ``If the Republicans try to dream up some vote to try to
embarrass Sen. Bentsen, they have to be aware that whatever they do
could also catch Sen. Quayle,'' Pryor said.
   While Quayle will be among the conferees on the defense bill,
Bentsen is one of the House-Senate negotiators nearing agreement on
a plan changing the way the government helps the nation's poor.
   The administration expressed reservations last month about the
way the compromise was shaping up, but congressional Democrats may
decide to send Reagan the bill and force him to decide whether to
veto it.
   The reform effort centers on a greatly expanded work, education
and training program for welfare recipients. The biggest stumbling
block is a provision requiring some recipients to do community work.
   Both chambers are also trying to come up with legislation
designed to halt the flow of illegal drugs. The House will begin
work on its version Wednesday, with the Senate to follow later.
   A proposal by House Democrats, which they hope will win GOP
votes, would add up to $2 billion a year to the $3.9 billion the
federal government spends anually fighting drugs.
   The legislation contains more money for education, treatment,
rehabilitation, and state and local law enforcement.
   The House has also tentatively scheduled a Sept. 14 vote on a
bill guaranteeing 10 weeks of unpaid, job-protected leave for new
parents employed by firms of 50 persons or more. The business
community opposes the bill, contending it would make companies
uncompetitive and the government shouldn't mandate employee
benefits.
   Another campaign issue, child care, is the subject of numerous
bills in both chambers. The fastest-moving bill is the
Democratic-backed $2.5 billion Act for Better Child Care Services.
   Reagan and other conservatives oppose the measure, but Democrats
have declined to compromise and a showdown could loom.

   The nation's past presidents may need more
advertising, judging from a survey that found youngsters able to
name more brands of alcoholic beverages than former chief
executives.
   The children, ages 8 to 12, were each able to name an average of
5.2 alcoholic beverages, but just 4.8 presidents, reported the
Center for Science in the Public Interest.
   The Center, a non-profit health advocacy group, said it surveyed
180 boys and girls in Washington, D.C., and suburban Maryland.
   ``This survey indicates the extent to which booze is part of the
daily life of children who cannot drink legally for another 10
years,'' commented Michael Jacobson, head of the Center.
   Among the findings of the survey:
   _A 10-year-old girl rattled off 14 alcoholic beverages but could
name only four presidents.
   _An 11-year-old boy, who could name eight brands of beer and
wine, said there are 16 inches in a foot.
   _Another 11-year-old boy correctly spelled Matilda Bay, King
Cobra and Bud Light, but rendered the presidents' names as
``Nickson'' and ``Rosselvet.''
   _And a 7-year-old boy who could name 10 brands of beer and wine
listed as presidents ``Aprilham Linchon'' and ``Ragon.''

   The USS Stark returned to a
low-key welcome at its home port Saturday after 10 months in a
shipyard to repair $90 million damage caused by two Iraqi missiles
in the Persian Gulf.
   About 100 people were on hand as the guided-missile frigate
docked at Bravo pier, where a memorial to the 37 sailors killed in
the May 1987 attack has been placed.
   It is the same pier from which the Stark left in February 1987
for what was to have been routine duty in the Persian Gulf.
   ``It's good to be a family again instead of a long-distance
family,'' said Jennifer Hayward, who with her three children waited
for her husband.
   She recalled how the crippled ship was greeted by hundreds of
people bearing balloons and welcome-home banners when it returned
after the attack last year. ``Last August, it was a a lot more
emotional,'' she said.
   Lt. Cmdr. Tim Taylor, a Navy spokesman, said that no ceremony
was scheduled for the return of the Stark from Ingalls Shipbuilding
in Pascagoula, Miss., where it underwent repairs.
   ``We want the Stark to be just like every other ship,'' said
Mayport's commanding officer, Capt. John Mitchell.
   Another ship, the USS Boone, also came home Saturday after a
one-year overhaul in New Orleans. ``It's no different, one from the
other,'' Mitchell said.
   The Stark left Mississippi on Wednesday with 16 officers and 174
enlisted men who spent the year in Mississippi helping with the
repairs or doing other Navy work.
   Before heading home, the ship passed trials of its guns, its
ability to track air and surface targets, its engines and its
steering. The repairs were completed on time and cost about $52
million less than estimated, officials said.
   The searing heat from the Exocet missiles destroyed the Stark's
berthing area and combat information center as well as radar
equipment rooms and other compartments.
   The Stark underwent temporary repairs in Bahrain after the
attack before the long voyage home a year ago.
   The government of Iraq, which claimed responsibility for the
attack, will be sent a bill for the repair costs. It also has
promised to compensate the families of the 37 sailors killed in
what it said was an accidental attack.

<HEAD>Sasso, Dukakis' Trusted Corner Man, Back For The Fall Fight</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In bringing John Sasso back to his campaign
Michael Dukakis, locked in an increasingly tough fight for the
presidency with George Bush, turned to his trusted corner man, the
alter-ego with whom he has fought _ and won _ many a battle before.
   The most telling remark about their relationship came from
Dukakis himself last year at their worst moment, when the governor
and then-longshot presidential candidate described his departing
campaign manager as ``like a brother.''
   Last week's announcement of his return as campaign vice chairman
immediately energized a campaign headquarters full of staffers
reading reports their effort was moribund.
   ``Now we've got the A-team,'' said Dukakis campaign issues
adviser Thomas Herman, a former Dukakis state aide brought into
that job by Sasso. ``There's no question that John is as close to
Michael Dukakis as anyone else is.''
   Dukakis and Sasso met on a train platform in 1978 shortly after
Dukakis suffered a humiliating defeat at the hands of Edward J.
King in the Democratic gubernatorial primary. Sasso, so impressed
that Dukakis kept a commitment to attend an event he had organized,
offered his assistance should Dukakis decide to venture back into
politics.
   Mindful of that promise, Dukakis in 1980 asked Sasso to manage
his 1982 comeback effort against King, a bruising campaign that
included an incident not unlike the ``attack video'' episode that
drove Delware Sen. Joseph Biden from the presidential race and
Sasso from the Dukakis presidential campaign.
   Sasso played for reporters what became known as the ``sex tape''
_ a parody that made fun of the King's wife's struggle against
polio. That same campaign included a Dukakis television ad in which
a supporter was shown cheering on Dukakis and referring to King as
a ``son of a bitch.''
   Dukakis won the nasty primary battle and coasted to victory in
the fall. Back in office, he installed Sasso as his chief secretary
_ his top liason with legislators who wanted little to do with
Dukakis in his first term.
   ``He's the hit man,'' said former House Minority Leader Royall
Switzler. ``John is the guy behind the scenes for Dukakis and has
proven himself to be the master of dirty tricks,'' said Switzler,
adding that it was Sasso who would negotiate legislative deals for
Dukakis by threatening votoes of pet projects to win votes for
controversial matters backed by the governor.
   Dukakis loyalists disputed Switzler's characterizations.
   ``He believes in playing the game with vigor but with fairness
as well,'' said John DeVillars, Sasso's former deputy who remains
at his Statehouse post.
   Sasso, 41, also assumed a role he came to relish: handling the
governor's media relations. Dukakis never goes off the record with
a reporter; Sasso would do so frequently, steering reporters to
what he considered stories.
   It was in that role that he distributed to reporters videotapes
showing Biden borrowing without attribution the rhetoric of a
British politician, a story that began a flurry of negative reports
that forced Biden from the race.
   That Sasso, described by one Dukakis aide as ``the man with the
best instincts in the business,'' targeted Biden was no surprise.
Only Biden was rivaling Dukakis in early fund-raising among the
Democratic presidential candidates and was about to get major
publicity in his role as chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee
during hearings on President Reagan's nomination of Robert Bork to
the Supreme Court.
   Sasso's role with the Dukakis campaign was not his first venture
into presidential politics. He had been a field organizer for Sen.
Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., in 1980 and also took a leave from
Dukakis' staff to manage Geraldine Ferraro's 1984 vice presidential
campaign.
   It was after the Walter Mondale-Ferraro ticket was defeated by
President Reagan that Sasso began promoting Dukakis as a 1988
presidential contender. Dukakis at first discouraged such talk,
asking Sasso and other aides to focus on his 1986 gubernatorial
re-election.
   In the midst of that campaign Sasso began drafting a memo
encouraging Dukakis to run, arguing that his record of achievement
in Massachusetts and optimistic approach was a winning combination
four years after charges of ``gloom and doom'' doomed Mondale.
   When Dukakis decided to run, he quickly installed Sasso as
campaign manager. Since his resignation last year, Sasso has spoken
to Dukakis frequently but has had no formal campaign role. He shied
away from reporters, and was described by friends as sullen,
unhappy on the sidelines.
   ``I'm delighted to be back as part of the general election
team,'' a beaming Sasso said Friday, ``because I've always been
committed to Michael Dukakis.''

   Two humane societies are urging consumers
to boycott a new stuffed toy called Krushed Kitty.
   The yellow-and-black striped toy _ a cat's bottom with hind legs
and tail _ is designed to be stuck out of car doors, hoods and
trunks. A card attached states that ``a portion of the profits are
donated to the Humane Society.''
   However, Phyllis Wright, a vice president with the Washington
D.C.-based Humane Society of The United States, denied any
connection to the item and said she doubts ``any legitimate humane
society would take one penny from this.''
   She and Gerri Bain of the Capital Area Humane Society in
Columbus called on consumers not to buy the stuffed toy, which
retails for $17.99.
   ``I think the onus is on the consumer,'' Ms. Wright said.
``Unless the public responds in a negative way and goes to a store
and threatens never to buy anything else there because of this
item, nothing will get done.''
   The attached card does not state how much will be donated, nor
whether the money will go to the national Humane Society or to
local humane societies, which are privately operated and not
affiliated with the national organization.
   The Krushed Kritter Kompany of Kalifornia, which lists its
address as Tarzana, Calif., could not be reached to comment Friday.
No telephone listing was available.
   The toy's packaging said the cat parts are registered in at
least five states _ Ohio, Maine, Pennsylvania, Florida and Texas.
   The packaging urges the purchaser to ``Krush your kitty in your
car, work or home!'' and to write to the company to ``tell us your
favorite place to krush your kitty. And vote for who or what you
would like to see KRUSHED next.''
   ``This will do for kittens what `Jaws' did for sharks,'' Bain
said. ``This is not only disgusting and irreverent, but it is
misleading.''
   ``I think the best way to stop this disgusting product is for
consumers to just not buy them. Let them (the manufacturer) eat
their Krushed Kitties,'' she said.

<HEAD>Soviet Maps Have Been Falsified, Distorted For 50 Years:
Cartographer</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Roads, rivers and towns were moved or removed on
Soviet maps for 50 years by order of the secret police, who were
trying to throw off aerial bombers and spies, the Soviet Union's
top cartographer said.
   Those inaccuracies are now being corrected, said the
cartographer, Viktor R. Yashchenko.
   ``People didn't recognize their own homeland on maps,''
Yashchenko told the government newspaper Izvestia in an interview
published Friday. ``Tourists in vain tried to orient themselves to
locations.''
   Yashchenko, head of the government's Main Directorate of
Geodetics and Cartography said the falsifications began in the
1930s under now-disgraced dictator Josef Stalin and continued until
this year.
   Stalin's policy of revising historical records to suit his
political needs has been severely criticized under Soviet leader
Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   But Yashchenko implied criticism of every successor of Stalin in
saying that skewing of maps continued even after Gorbachev took
power in March 1985.
   Gorbachev has promoted a policy of ``glasnost,'' or openness,
that has uncovered previosly taboo subjects, known in the Soviet
Union as ``blank spots.''
   Yashchenko said the blank spots on maps were overwhelming and
that they began when his agency was put under the control of the
NKVD, the predecessor of the KGB state security apparatus.
   ``The atmosphere of mistrust and espionage was reflected on the
production of cartographers as well,'' he told Izvestia.
   Orders would come down for cartographers to remove from maps
certain locations or change those of others, he recalled.
   Under Stalin, airbrushing to remove the faces of purged
``enemies of the people'' was routine and references to such
disgraced figures were removed from books, newspapers and magazines.
   Yashchenko said even tourist maps were highly inaccurate.
   Many foreigners in Moscow use a CIA-produced map of the capital
because Soviet-made maps omit many streets.
   ``On the tourist map of Moscow, the contours of the capital are
only partly true,'' the map maker said.
   He said the absurdity of inaccurate maps had increased in recent
times, when the Soviet Union has extremely detailed photographs
taken from satellites in space.

<TEXT>
   Mars will move to within about 36 million miles
of Earth this month _ the closest its been in 17 years _ and dozens
of ``Mars watches'' are planned to view the red planet named for
the Roman god of war.
   The planet will come closest to Earth on Sept. 22, but the best
time to see it is the next few nights, said Norman Warns, an
astronomy professor at South Suburban College in South Holland, a
Chicago suburb.
   ``It's a perfect time to see because the moon doesn't come up
until late at night,'' Warns said Friday. ``It's a definite orange
bright spot in the southeastern sky at about 10 at night.''
   The Planetary Society, an amateur astronomy group, plans about
50 Mars watches this month, said Linda Low, the group's Illinois
regional coordinator. Thousands of smaller, informal Mars parties
also will be held, she said.
   On Saturday, outer-space buffs were encouraged to bring Mars
bars and other earthly delights to a Mars watch, picnic and jazz
concert at the college.
   The last time Earth and Mars were so close was in 1971, Warns
said. He said viewing conditions this time are better because the
planet is much higher in the sky.
   ``It'll appear the brightest during September. Then it'll get
dimmer as the two planets move away,'' he said.
   Warns said that unless Mars watchers look at the planet through
a high-powered telescope, ``it might look to some people like a
star.''
   ``You won't see any Martians no matter what size telescope you
have, but the larger the telescope you have, the more you'll see,''
he said.
   ``You actually need a small telescope to see a disc ... and with
a medium-size telescope you can actually see surface features,''
Warns said. ``Under favorable conditions you would even see a white
spot which marks the polar ice cap.''
   Observers also should be on the lookout for dark spots, massive
dust storms on the planet, he said.
   With a very powerful telescope, they might also see the Valley
of the Mariner, a five-mile-deep, twenty-mile-wide canyon that
would stretch from New York to Los Angeles if it were on Earth.
   Astrologer Del O'Connor said even those who pay no attention to
Mars will be affected by it.
   She warned that people should be more careful and not make any
rash decisions because of the unusual influence this month of the
planet said by astrologers to have high energy.
   ``Whatever is going on during this period will happen with
greater intensity because Mars as a planet represents raw energy,''
Ms. O'Connor said.

   A man was convicted of murder despite the
testimony of two witnesses who identified the interpreter sitting
beside him as the killer.
   Jurors deliberated less than 20 minutes Thursday before
convicting Mariano Medina, 45, in the 1986 slaying of Pablo
Rodriguez. Judge Miron Love sentenced Medina to 20 years in prison.
   Two elderly witnesses had pointed to court interpreter Sammy
Garcia as the man they saw gun down Rodriguez.
   Garcia, who was seated beside Medina through the trial, said the
misidentification reminded him of ``something you see on `Perry
Mason.'''
   Mike Roe, the assistant district attorney, had stressed in final
arguments that the witnesses did identify Medina in a photo lineup
shortly after the slaying. ``Don't reward him for changing his
appearance,'' he told the jurors.
   Roe said that in the past two years, Medina has lost 20 pounds,
grown a mustache and put on glasses. Both Medina and Garcia have
dark complexions and dark, wavy hair.
   One of the witnesses had provided police with the license number
of the car driven by Rodriguez's assailant, leading authorities to
Medina. One of Medina's neighbors also testified she saw him load a
revolver shortly before hearing shots nearby.
   Prosecutors argued that Medina shot Rodriguez because he
suspected him of burglarizing his apartment.

   U.S. Rep. Stephen J. Solarz said Saturday
he would meet with government and opposition leaders to see how the
United States can encourage democracy after 26 years of
authoritarian rule.
   Small groups of anti-government protesters met in the capital,
but there were no rallies after a week of major demonstrations
against the one-party rule of the Burma Socialist Program Party.
   ``I've come in order to assess the situation and its
implications for American interest in the region,'' Solarz said
after arriving Saturday in Rangoon. He was reached by telephone
from Bangkok, Thailand.
   Solarz said he wanted to ``see what, if anything, the United
States can do to facilitate the peaceful emergence of a genuine
democracy.''
   Sources said Solarz would meet separately with President Maung
Maung; with Aung Gyi, Burma's best-known dissident, who was
recently freed from a month's detention; and with Tin Oo, a former
defense minister who re-emerged to lead calls for multi-party
democracy.
   Solarz, D-N.Y., chairs the Asian and Pacific Affairs
Subcommittee of the House Foreign Affairs Committee. He has spoken
out against against repressive policies of former Philippine
President Ferdinand Marcos and the ultra-radical Khmer Rouge that
ruled Cambodia until 1978.
   Diplomats say the international community has limited influence
over Burma because it is a strictly neutralist nation without close
allies. Burma also is extremely sensitive to what it considers to
be foreign interference.
   Japan and West Germany are the biggest aid donors. The United
States has a relatively modest aerial spraying program aimed
largely at helping Rangoon combat opium production in the so-called
``Golden Triangle.''
   Hundreds of thousands of people marched through major cities
Friday, demanding immediate democracy and rejecting Maung Maung's
appeal to be patient in their quest.
   Students and other protest leaders called for large-scale
demonstrations on Sept. 8 to press for an interim government to
oversee the transition to democracy. Strikes and protests have been
virtually daily events.
   The government has not backed down from its original plan for
party leaders to meet Sept. 12 to consider calling for a popular
vote on ending one-party rule. The protesters want an interim
government formed before then, but Maung Maung has rejected that
for constitutional reasons.
   Burma has been under single-party rule since Gen. Ne Win led the
1962 military coup that toppled an elected government.
   Ne Win resigned on July 23 and proposed a referendum on ending
one-party rule. But the party rejected that and picked hard-liner
Sein Lwin to succeed him.
   Massive protests followed, and by official count at least 112
people were killed in clashes with security forces in Rangoon
before Sein Lwin resigned Aug. 12.
   Maung Maung, the first civilian leader in 26 years, succeeded
him a week later, lifted martial law and freed political prisoners.
But pro-democracy demonstrations continued and a general strike has
crippled government services and administration in many areas.
   On Friday, a Western diplomat in Rangoon cited reports that
protesters have taken over about 40 town governments in recent
weeks.
   Another indication of the breakdown in order has been several
jail riots, after which authorities freed thousands of inmates.
State-run Radio Rangoon said 486 prisoners were freed Saturday in
the central city of Mandalay.

<TEXT>
   President Augusto Pinochet has seized the
initiative in a carefully orchestrated campaign for eight more
years of military rule, extending highly publicized olive branches
to critics of his authoritarian government.
   But the Chilean opposition remains confident of defeating the
72-year-old army commander at the voting booth in a presidential
plebiscite scheduled for Oct. 5.
   In two adept moves, made 48 hours after fellow military
commanders nominated him Tuesday as sole candidate in a
presidential referendum, Pinochet broadcast a conciliatory appeal
for opposition collaboration and authorized the return of all 430
remaining political exiles.
   Leaders of the local Roman Catholic Church lauded both measures
as helping national reconciliation. ``We have to be truly happy
with these positive steps,'' said the country's cardinal, Juan
Francisco Fresno.
   It was rare praise from the church hierarchy, which has been
consistently critical of Pinochet since he seized power in a bloody
1973 coup. The church's pronouncements carry much weight with
Chile's predominantly Catholic population.
   Coupled with the lifting last month of all states of emergency
for the first time since Pinochet took power, even the opposition
leaders said Chile was moving toward greater political freedom.
   They denounced the timing of the actions, however, as a cynical
bid for publicity and voter support, and they predicted this could
backfire for the government.
   ``It creates a greater sense of security in the country,'' said
Genaro Arriagada, general secretary of a 16-party opposition
coalition. This could make many Pinochet opponents feel safe from
reprisal if they vote against him in the referendum, Arriagada said.
   The opposition's campaign, which consists largely of festive
rallies and door-to-door visits, is focused heavily on overcoming
fears that citizens might lose government jobs or benefits, such as
housing subsidies, if they vote ``no.''
   A campaign slogan, used extensively by opposition leaders in
rallies, is ``say yes, but vote no.''
   If Pinochet wins a majority in the referendum, he begins a new
eight-year term in March. He already has governed the country
longer than any predecessor.
   Even if a majority of voters rejects him, he will remain
president until 1990, when open elections will be held. Elections
for Congress, disbanded by Pinochet when he seized power, are
planned for the same year.
   Pinochet trails badly in many polls, including those that
foreign diplomats describe as the most reliable. His new attempts
at the image of peacemaker appear aimed at making headway with the
many Chileans offended by his harsh, strong-arm image.
   Pinochet rejects the poll indications, favoring pro-government
surveys that give him a slight edge. But even if he were to
conclude that the opposition held a commanding lead it now appears
too late to back out and, for instance, call open elections that
might split the opposition.
   It also appears too late for the opposition, despite its
complaints that the government enjoys an unfair advantage, to
withdraw from the competition.
   ``This (referendum) is a path from which it would be difficult
for Pinochet to stray,'' Arriagada said. ``And, to be honest, from
which it would be difficult for us to stray, either.''
   The opposition maintains that Pinochet is spending millions of
dollars in public money on pro-government publicity and providing
logistical support, such as municipal stadiums free of charge, to
political groups campaigning for him.
   The pro-Pinochet campaign's central message is that a loss in
the referendum would bring back social and political chaos of the
early 1970s, when an elected Marxist, Salvador Allende, was
president. Allende's government was toppled, and he died, in the
1973 coup.
   A major anti-Pinochet rally was planned for Sunday in Santiago,
and organizers say they are doing their best to make sure it and
future demonstrations are peaceful, designating chaperones to keep
order and control any rowdy groups.
   ``Any violence helps Pinochet,'' said Patricio Aylwin, leader of
the centrist Christian Democratic Party, the country's largest, and
official spokesman for the opposition coalition. ``We must do all
we can to prevent it.''
   Aylwin tried to take the campaign initiative Thursday by
challenging Pinochet to a televised debate. It was considered
unlikely the president would agree.

<HEAD>Reagan Threatens Veto Of Welfare Bill</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SANTA BARBARA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>

   President Reagan said today he will
veto any welfare bill sent him by Congress that ``replaces work
with welfare expansion.''
   In his weekly radio address, delivered from his mountaintop
ranch north of here, the president said the economic expansion
under his administration has enabled nearly three million Americans
to escape poverty.
   ``But this week we got a warning,'' he added. ``While we learned
that last year family income went up and that the poverty rate
dropped slightly, we also learned that some groups lagged behind in
the last year.''
   ``There are still some Americans whom our expansion has passed
by: those caught in the welfare trap,'' he said.
   ``It's time to return hope to those on welfare, which is why our
administration has worked to reform our welfare system,'' the
president said.
   He said nearly half of the 50 states have either instituted or
proposed experimental welfare plans under an administration program
designed to foster steps to get people off welfare.
   ``Now, Congress appears to be close to a decision about welfare
reform,'' he added. ``And I have a message for them: I will not
accept any welfare reform bill unless it is geared to making people
independent of welfare.
   ``If Congress presents me with a bill that replaced work with
welfare expansion and that places the dignity of self-sufficiency
through work out of the reach of Americans on welfare, I will use
my veto pen,'' he said.
   The Senate has passed a bill that does contain a work
requirement, but the measure passed by the House does not. The two
bills are being considered by a House-Senate conference committee.
   ``While others have talked about good jobs at good wages, we've
delivered,'' the president said. ``Now it is time for Congress to
join with us in making sure that the opportunities created by this
prosperity reach into every American home.''
   The president began his speech by saying that ``just yesterday
we learned that in August as great a proportion of us had jobs as
ever before.''
   The Labor Department reported Friday that unemployment rose to
5.6 percent in August from 5.4 percent in July. In May,
unemployment had reached a 14-year low of 5.3 percent.

   Radical students demanding that North
Korea be allowed to co-host the Olympics pelted police Saturday
with rocks and firebombs, but the communist nation said it would
boycott the Games and asked other countries to stay away too.
   Police carrying iron bars and wooden clubs hurled back rocks and
unexploded firebombs at about 600 students in the clash at
Sungkyunkwan University in Seoul, but they used no tear gas because
of a new government ban.
   Several protesters and police were injured, but authorities had
no figures for injuries or arrests.
   A declaration by the students said: ``If the Olympics cannot
help nurture a desirable atmosphere, they are nothing but divisive
Olympics, dictatorial Olympics and war Olympics.''
   North Korea announced Saturday it would boycott the Sept.
17-Oct. 2 Olympics because its demand to be a co-host had been
rejected. It has said for months that it would stay away from the
Games if the demand was not met.
   North Korea, in a report carried by its official Korean Central
News Agency, said the Olympics were being used to perpetuate the
division of the Korean peninsula, and it urged other nations to
back its boycott.
   ``For us, Olympic Games are important, but more important is the
future destiny of our entire nation. For this reason, we cannot
take part in the Olympic Games that is forced by single-handed
hosting,'' said the report, monitored in Tokyo.
   The agency, citing a statement released by the north's Olympic
committee, said the Games will be ``crippled'' by a boycott, but
only Cuba and Ethiopia have said they will back North Korea.
   South Korean officials fear the north may try to sabotage the
Olympics. The two sides see the Olympics as a major symbol in their
struggle for dominance on the divided Korean peninsula.
   The peninsula was split in 1945. The north invaded the south in
1950, starting the Korean War, and the border between the two sides
remains tense years after the 1953 armistice.
   In its announcement Saturday, North Korea lashed out at the
United States, Japan and South Korea, charging they conspired to
hold the Games in Seoul to keep the two Koreas apart.
   ``By holding the Olympiad in Seoul, they tried to give the
impression (that) South Korea, the complete colony, military base
of the United States, was an `independent state' and legalize the
occupation of South Korea by the U.S. troops.''
   The formal deadline for entering the Olympics expired Friday.
But the head of the Seoul Olympic Organizing Committee, Park
Seh-jik, said earlier Saturday that Seoul would keep the door open
until the last day of the Olympics for North Korea to participate.
   The International Olympic Committee and South Korea said the
Games could not be shared because they are given to a single city.
Talks last month failed to produce an agreement between the two
Koreas on the Olympics.
   Park also said police would not use tear gas to disperse any
protests during the Olympics because authorities want to avoid
disruption. The gas used by riot police during demonstrations often
floats into residential and business areas, and the government does
not want to spoil the Games.
   Radicals have threatened protests during the Olympics. A small
but powerful minority on campuses, they lack widespread public
support.
   Opposition leader Kim Dae-jung said Saturday he doubted that the
radicals would attempt to disrupt the Games. ``The students know
they will not be supported by our people,'' Kim told The Associated
Press in an interview.
   Kim also played down any potential threat from North Korea. He
said it would not disrupt the Olympics because it would be
condemned worldwide.
   The one serious threat appears to be international terrorists,
some with ties to North Korea, Kim said.
   Some opposition leaders say the government is being moderate to
avoid alienating world opinion during the Olympics but that it may
crack down after the Games.
   But Kim said that was unlikely. He said President Roh Tae-woo
assured him Wednesday that the military would declare its
neutrality in politics. ``We have agreed only democracy can solve
our problems,'' he said.
   Roh, a former general, defeated Kim and rival opposition leader
Kim Young-sam in December presidential elections. Roh replaced
former President Chun Doo-hwan, who took power with military
backing in 1980.
   South Korea has been ruled for most of its 40-year history by
authoritarian military and civilian leaders.

   The government today released
a convicted Irish Republican Army killer to attend the funeral of
his brother, an IRA guerrilla who was slain in a British army
ambush.
   Across the province in Londonderry, family and friends buried
two people who were killed by an IRA bomb, and Roman Catholic
Bishop Edward Daly said he did not ``want to hear any more
apologies from the IRA or anyone else.''
   In Crossmaglen, meanwhile, a town near the border with Ireland,
a mortar attack on a military base damaged some nearby buildings
but caused no injuries. Police said three mortars exploded and that
other shells failed to exploded.
   Earlier today, hundreds of police and soldiers in riot gear
formed an almost unbroken circle around the home of slain IRA
guerrilla Brian Mullin at Sixmilecross, 50 miles west of Belfast
before his funeral.
   Mullin's elder brother Patrick, serving a life sentence for the
IRA murder of a school bus driver, was given a day's compassionate
leave to attend the funeral and was released in the custody of a
local priest and driven from Maze prison in Belfast by members of
Sinn Fein, the IRA's political wing.
   Patrick Mullin was delayed at a security checkpoint, and the
cortege of 2,000 mourners did not leave the farm at Sixmilecross
for nearby Dunmoyle until about noon, one hour later than scheduled.
   A previous report said the delay occurred because family members
demanded the security forces leave the vicinity of the house before
they would come out.
   More than 200 police and soldiers later accompanied the hearse
carrying Mullin's coffin which was draped with the Irish tricolor
flag.
   Mullin was killed along with two other men in an ambush by
British soldiers. Police say Mullin, 26, and brothers Gerard Harte,
29, and Martin Harte, 21, were known IRA members who were armed and
masked when they were killed at Drumnakilly 50 miles west of
Belfast on Tuesday.
   News reports said the three guerrillas were about to try to kill
an off-duty member of the Ulster Defense Regiment when soldiers
lying in wait riddled their stolen car with bullets. The IRA said
the three men died ``on active service,'' a euphemism for gun and
bomb attacks.
   The Harte brothers were buried Friday, and Mullin's funeral was
scheduled for today before the standoff began between security
forces and his family.
   In Londonderry, Bishop Daly presided at the funeral of Sean
Dalton 55, and Sheila Lewis, 60, who were killed by a booby-trap
bomb Wednesday when they went to examine the apartment of a
neighbor they had not seen in several days.
   Dalton broke into the apartment and triggered a bomb rigged to
blow up an army squad. The IRA apologized, saying the operation
went ``tragically wrong.''
   Daly told the congregation he wanted to hear no more apologies.
   Before the Mullin funeral, Protestant lawmaker Ken Maginnis said
Patrick was going to be let out of prison to attend the funeral.
   Maginnis, a member of the Protestant Official Unionist Party,
said the British government's Northern Ireland Office told him it
would allow Mullin's brother to attend the funeral. The office, the
British government department responsible for the province's
affairs, refused to comment.
   Patrick Mullin is serving a life term for the 1977 killing of
Roman Catholic bus driver Frank Canavan. The IRA said at the time
that Canavan was mistaken for a part-time member of the Ulster
Defense Regiment, a locally recruited unit of the British army.
   The mainly Catholic IRA, which is fighting to end British rule
in Northern Ireland, apologized for what it called Canavan's
``tragic death.''
   ``It is an absolute scandal that this man (Patrick Mullin), who
is one of a committed IRA family, should be released, or paroled or
whatever it is called,'' Maginnis said. ``The concession for the
funeral of a terrorist involved in the murder of eight young
soldiers exactly 14 days ago is a concession to IRA terrorism quite
beyond comprehension.''
   Police arrested Brian Mullin after an IRA bomb blew up a
military bus on Aug. 20, killing eight soldiers and injuring 27
others. He was questioned and released after five days without
being charged.
   The bombing occurred at Ballygawley, eight miles from where
Mullin and the Hartes were killed. ``We know he (Mullin) was in the
same (IRA) unit that carried out the (bus) bombing,'' Maginnis said.

   Oil prices could fall sharply if Iran and
Iraq increase production to raise cash for post-war reconstruction.
   A glut in world oil supplies drove the price below the $18 a
barrel level set by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries even before the Aug. 20 cease-fire in the Persian Gulf
war. Prices now stand at around $15 a barrel.
   OPEC's efforts to curb output depend on whether it can persuade
Iran and Iraq not to use their newly regained export capacity.
   The cartel already is plagued by overproduction by some of its
13 members states, mainly Iraq and the United Arab Emirates.
Current total output is estimated at around 20 million barrels a
day, around 3.5 million barrels above the cartel's quota ceiling.
   OPEC's Secretary-General, former Indonesian Energy Minister
Subroto, recently visited Tehran and Baghdad to persuade Iran to
allow Iraq a quota equal to its own, 2.36 million barrels a day.
That's far less than what both countries pumped before the war
broke out in September 1980.
   Iraq refused an earlier OPEC quota of 1.54 million barrels a day
and demanded parity with Iran. Iraq failed to win that during the
war, leading it to pump as much oil as it could, about 2.8 million
barrels a day.
   It is not known how successful Subroto's mission was. But Iraq's
Oil Minister, Issam Abdul-Rahim al-Chalabi, voiced support Friday
for OPEC and for ``acceptable and just solutions to the problems
facing the organization.''
   Iran and Iraq desperately need revenues to rebuild their
economies. Each depends on oil for about 90 percent of its foreign
earnings. Both have both made developing their oil facilities a top
priority. Iran's long-term production target is 4.5 million barrels
a day, around its prewar level.
   During the war, Iraqi air raids on Iran's oil facilities and
tanker routes forced exports down to an average 1.5 million barrels
a day.
   Iran's deputy oil minister, Khazempour Ardebili, recently said
Tehran will stick to OPEC rules for the time being and work to
prevent overproduction.
   Repairing Iranian oil installations damaged in Iraqi air raids _
and in recent months by the U.S. Navy warships _ will take time.
Development will cost both states billions of dollars.
   Iraq could boost its exports by as much as 1 million barrels a
day within months through makeshift terminals now that its ships
can sail the gulf again.
   During the war, Iraq built pipelines through Turkey and Saudi
Arabia that allow it to export about 2.5 million barrels a day.
Another 200,000 barrels a day is trucked through Jordan and Turkey.
   Another pipeline due for completion next year, and reopening its
gulf ports will push Iraq's export capacity to about 5.5 million
barrels a day by 1995, oil analysts said.
   Iraq plans to build a north-south pipeline within its borders,
repair its southern gulf terminals and develop new oilfields.
   It badly needs increased oil revenues to pay off its foreign
debt, estimated at between $70 billion and $85 billion, and to
finance its ambitious development plans. The $12 billion to $14
billion it earns a year from oil make it difficult to do both,
diplomats said.
   Iran earns around $9 billion annually.
   Diplomats said Iraq's expansion plans are aimed mainly at
diversifying its oil export lines so it will never again be trapped
by the closing of its gulf ports and tanker routes, as it was at
the outbreak of the war.
   Baghdad-based diplomats said they expect Iraq, second only to
Saudi Arabia in oil reserves, to try to abide by OPEC quotas,
largely because it is in Iraq's own interests to help hold up oil
prices.
   But several sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said
Baghdad might be tempted to overproduce if Iran does, or if oil
prices and revenues fall so much that its development plans are
endangered.

   A secret new spy satellite circled
the globe in a useless orbit Saturday, leaving the United States to
continue relying on aging systems for eavesdropping and warning of
missile attacks.
   The satellite, said to be designed for intercepting Soviet
communications, was propelled into a successful preliminary orbit
by a $65 million Titan 34D rocket launched here Friday.
   But a source close to the project said the spacecraft failed to
achieve a desired stationary orbit 22,300 miles high when the upper
stage of the rocket failed to re-ignite.
   The source, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the
satellite remained in a sharply elliptical orbit ranging from about
100 to 22,300 miles above Earth.
   He said the payload was useless on that course and there was
little hope of salvaging the mission.
   The Air Force, as is its custom with military launches, did not
announce the liftoff in advance. Several minutes after launch, with
the Titan apparently working well, it reported a successful start
to the mission.
   Asked about the reported failure, Air Force Lt. Col. Ron Rand,
director of public affairs at the Eastern Space and Missile Center
here, said the Pentagon had a policy of not commenting on the
results of military space flights.
   John E. Pike, a space policy expert for the Washington-based
Federation of American Scientists, said the satellite was
code-named Vortex, a series designed to monitor Soviet missile
tests and military and diplomatic electronic communications.
   It was intended to replace a satellite that has been in use for
several years and is showing signs of wear, the source reported.
   Aging is a problem with many of America's military satellites
and is causing concern among military planners, who over the last
two decades have relied heavily on space-based systems for
reconnaissance, communications, electronic eavesdropping,
missile-attack alert and navigation.
   Since the space shuttle Challenger explosion and a Titan 34D
blowup, both in early 1986, the Pentagon has been limited in its
ability to lift heavy satellites into orbit to replace older
systems, many of which continue to operate long past their
anticipated operational lifetimes.
   The Titan 34D, the United States' most powerful unmanned rocket,
was grounded for redesign for 18 months following its 1986 failure.
   Flights resumed late last year with two straight successes _
deployment of reconnaissance and missile attack warning satellites,
the only two heavy U.S. military payloads launched successfully in
the last 2{ years.
   Friday's launch was the first for the Titan 34D since those 1987
flights, and it had been delayed several months by technical
problems.
   Only three more Titan 34Ds remain in the inventory, with the
rocket to be replaced starting later this year by the more powerful
Titan 4.
   The redesigned space shuttle is scheduled to resume flights late
this month or in early October, and the Pentagon has booked
critically needed military satellites on five of the first nine
missions.
   Even before Challenger, the Defense Department realized it was
depending too much on the shuttle for access to space and began
developing the Titan 4 over the objection of the National
Aeronautics and Space Administration.
   The Air Force is shepherding the construction of 50 Titan 4s and
a large number of smaller Delta 2s and Titan 2s to launch a family
of military satellites over the next several years, gradually
cutting back on its use of the shuttle.

   A quarter million school-age children across
America won't be returning to the classroom this month.
   Instead, they'll learn reading, writing and arithmetic at the
same table where they eat breakfast, and Mom and Dad will be the
teachers.
   The U.S. Department of Education estimates more than 260,000
children are being taught at home, more than twice as many as in
1985, primarily for religious reasons.
   Other motivations range from doubt about the abilities of public
school teachers to shielding children from peer pressure.
   ``I see it as a reaction of one part of the population to the
over-institutionalization of the child,'' said Patricia Lines, a
research analyst at the Department of Education.
   Red Balfour, who heads a home-schooling program for Orange
County in southern California, said he gets at least five calls a
day from parents interested in the growing movement.
   Parents taking such action could face legal problems. Some
states do not have statutes that specifically address the practice,
and disputes have developed over who is qualified to teach their
children at home.
   The Home School Legal Defense Association, based in Great Falls,
Va., provides legal advice and representation to its more than
9,000 members, said attorney J. Michael Smith, the group's vice
president.
   Smith said his group intervened in two cases during the 1987-88
academic year, and both were dismissed in court.
   A couple in the Covina Valley district east of Los Angeles lost
a case last year in which officials claimed the child didn't have
structured lessons. The district also complained the parents had
only a high school education.
   In California, where some 2,100 home schools are registered,
requirements for home teaching are vague, said Fred Fernandez,
consultant for non-public schools at the state Department of
Education. No statute provides guidelines for home teaching; the
law mandates only that instructors be ``capable of teaching,'' he
said.
   Micki and J. David Colfax of rural Boonville have become
national heroes in the home school movement. Their oldest son,
23-year-old Grant, graduated magna cum laude from Harvard in 1987,
and his brothers Drew, 20, and Reed, 18, now attend the university.
   ``I think public schools, especially high school age children,
are mostly a holding operation,'' Mrs. Colfax said. ``I think
there's an enormous waste of time.''
   The Colfaxes, both former teachers, began teaching their
children in 1973 when they moved to a ranch about 100 miles north
of San Francisco. Mrs. Colfax said she wasn't impressed with the
public education in the area.
   Parents who choose to keep their children at home for religious
reasons point to the teachings of veteran educator Raymond Moore,
who runs the Hewitt Research Foundation in Washougal, Wash.
   His foundation supplies lesson plans for more than 5,000
students, who he claims average significantly higher on
standardized achievement tests than the public school norm.
   Ms. Lines said federal data on students taught at home confirm
Moore's claim.
   ``Home schoolers enjoy tremendous advantages,'' Moore said.
``They are positively socialized instead of being peer-dependent,
narcissistically socialized.''
   Moore, who often appears on Christian broadcasts, said bad
teaching is the enemy, not public schools.
   Sharon Weir, a Seventh Day Adventist from Downey, Calif., said
she taught her two older daughters at home during their early
elementary years and plans to teach her 4-year-old when she reaches
school age.
   ``I wanted to keep my children away from any negative
influences,'' she said. ``When you're home-schooling, it's just the
mother and child one-to-one. You know if your child is getting the
material.''
   Support groups have sprung up throughout the country for parents
to meet and exchange ideas and for children to have an opportunity
to interact with each other.
   Gary McIntire, 7, of Yorba Linda, Calif., is one of a few dozen
children in Rainbow Kids, a group made up of home-taught youngsters
and their parents who meet once a week to work on projects or go on
field trips.
   His mother, Sue McIntire, said she prefers to teach him at home
because she doesn't like the socialization that children face at
public schools. And she believes Gary can learn better with the
special attention.
   ``Where he's strong we can go at the speed he's ready for, and
where he's not we can slow down,'' she said.

<HEAD>90,000 Kurds Huddled Along Border After Fleeing Iraq</HEAD>

<DATELINE>CUKURCA, Turkey (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   About 90,000 Kurdish refugees, many sick
and exhausted, have fled fighting in Iraq and resettled with
bedding and household utensils under trees in Turkish camps.
   They are huddled along small, tree-lined creeks with their sheep
and goats grazing nearby in eight encampments along a 60-mile strip
near the Iraqi border.
   Many children and old people are suffering from exhaustion and
diarrhea, said doctors screening the refugees Saturday.
   Next week, Turkey will start moving the refugees about 60 miles
inland to tent cities being set up north of the Syrian border in
Diyarbakir province and near the Cizre and Silopi townships, local
officials said Saturday.
   Thirty trucks to be used in the move have been sent to a camp
near Cukurca, known as Cukurca Yayla, where 11,000 refugees have
taken shelter, said town Mayor Macit Piruzbeyoglu.
   The doctors, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said 18 people
died in the Cukurca Yayla camp on Friday. They did not appear to be
victims of chemical bombs, the doctors said, but relatives would
not allow autopsies so it was not possible to know for sure.
   Kurds in northern Iraq have been fighting for an independent
homeland and received help from Iran during the eight-year
Iran-Iraq war. Soon after the warring nations agreed to a
cease-fire on Aug. 20, Iraq launched an offensive against the
Kurdish guerrillas, known as Peshmergas.
   About 20 million Kurds live in the mountains where the borders
of Turkey, Iran and Iraq meet, and Syria and the Soviet Union also
have small Kurdish enclaves. About 3.5 million Kurds live in Iraq.
   The Iraqi refugees say they fled when Iraqis dropped mustard gas
bombs, outlawed under international accords.
   Serbest Omar, 25, carrying a gas mask, said, ``On the way over,
I personally buried 15 dead from our group.
   ``Some died from hunger and illness and others from chemical
bombs,'' he said.
   He said only 800 of the 1300 residents of Tirvanish, his village
in the Dohuk township of northern Iraq, had survived.
   Amnesty International has backed up the Kurdish charges, saying
Iraqis have used chemical weapons against them in a campaign of
extermination.
   Iraq has denied using chemical weapons against the Kurds, though
it has said it was provoked to use them against Iran after Iran
used them first. Iraq considers the refugees traitors who
collaborated with Iran during the war.
   Ahmed Mohammed, 35, from another village in Dohuk township, said
refugees waited four days while the Iraqi army blocked their way.
They slipped through the blockade at night and then walked six days
to the Turkish border, he said.
   His mother and father died en route, he said.
   The refugees in the Cukurca Yayla camp have separated into
groups of nine or 10 people, each group taking shelter under a tree.
   Women make flat bread from flour distributed by the Turkish
government and brew tea. Some of the refugees cut down tree
branches to make hammocks and rock little children to sleep on them.
   Turkey announced Wednesday it would accept the refugees
temporarily on humanitarian grounds. The refugees and local
officials say the influx started earlier.
   ``They started coming in the middle of August,'' said Mayor
Piruzbeyoglu. He said groups of refugees had previously crossed
into Turkey in 1962 and 1975, during heavy fighting between the
Iraqi army and the Kurds, but he said the numbers were much smaller
then.
   Turkey hesitated to accept the refugees because its military is
fighting its own battle in southeastern Turkey with guerrillas
known as the Kurdish Labor Party.
   The rebels, who want to set up an independent, Marxist Kurdish
state, are not popular with the 10 million Kurdish residents of the
region. The guerrillas have slain several hundred villagers whom
they accused of cooperating with government forces.
   Since 1984, about 700 troops and 700 guerrillas have died in the
struggle.
   Premier Turgut Ozal's decision to give refuge to the Iraqi Kurds
has boosted his popularity among Kurdish residents in the
southeast, many of whom have relatives among the refugees, local
politicians say.
   This could serve him well in a Sept. 25 referendum on a
constitutional amendment to move up the date of municipal elections.
   Officials also hope the move will improve Turkey's image in the
West. Ozal has said Turkey's refugee policy is the best answer to
criticism of this country's human rights record or its treatment of
the Kurdish minority.

   Jennifer McJunkin put up with three years
of struggling with food stuck between her braces and knew just what
she needed on her menu: Practically Chewless Chili and Tin Grin
Torte.
   Those recipes and many others went into Ms. McJunkin's ``Teen
Cuisine: A Cookbook for Young People Who Wear Orthodontic Braces.''
   ``Orthodontists always tell you what you can't eat but they
never tell you what you can, and that's what we're trying to do
here,'' said Ms. McJunkin, now 20 and a junior at Drew University
here.
   Ms. McJunkin isn't the first one in her family to do battle with
braces, nor the first one to cook up a solution. Her parents
published a cookbook for adults with braces after her mother wore
them for several years.
   ``A lot of foods are so hard to eat because they're crunchy and
hard,'' Ms. McJunkin said. ``A lot of things get stuck in your
teeth, like salad and corn. These are alternatives to those.''
   The cookbook also is designed to help wearers avoid food that
bend their braces or pulls the hardware from their mouths. It
emphasizes soft foods such as pasta, and some recipes rely on
chopped, pureed or softened ingredients.
   In addition to the chili and torte, the 66-page book lists such
gourmet choices as Painless Pizza Soup and Metal Mouth Munchies, a
``mild and gentle'' snack of Chex cereal softened with margarine
and teriyaki or Worcestershire sauce.
   Most of the recipes came from her family, including Aunt
Geneva's Foolproof Fudge, Cousin Derek's Cereal Sundae and
Jennifer's Favorite Lemon Bars.
   Ms. McJunkin said she spent 2{ years testing the recipes on
every braces-wearing person she knew.
   Ms. McJunkin was a fifth-grader when she got braces to correct
an overbite and a gap between two front teeth. Even worse, her
family had just moved to Indiana.
   ``It was awful to be the new girl and to have braces,'' she
said. ``I really felt I kind of stuck out in the crowd. I told my
mother that I'd never smile again.''
   The McJunkins discussed the cookbook idea with the family's
orthodontist, who offered the manuscript to Straight Status Inc. of
New Castle, Ind., which produces greeting cards, stationery and
novelty items for orthodontists, dentists and their patients.
   The cookbook came off the press in January. It is being
distributed by the mail order company and may soon be available in
hospital gift shops and book stores.

<HEAD>Reagan Promises to Veto Welfare Reform Without Work Requirement</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By W. DALE NELSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SANTA BARBARA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Reagan warned Saturday
that he will veto any welfare legislation Congress sends him that
does not contain a work requirement.
   ``The best way to learn to work is to work,'' the president said
in a Labor Day weekend radio address from his vacation ranch 20
miles north of here.
   Rep. Thomas J. Downey, D-N.Y., in the Democrats' response, said
that quiring welfare recipients work may be necessary, but he said
such requirements should be controlled by state and local welfare
officials, not the federal government.
   Reagan mingled talk of welfare reform with celebration of his
administration's economic record, saying Friday's unemployment
figures showed that the jobless rate ``hovered just above the
lowest it's been in 14 years.''
   The figures from the Labor Department showed unemployment of 5.6
percent, up from 5.4 percent in July and from the May figure of 5.3
per cent, which was a 14-year low.
   ``But there are still some Americans whom our expansion has
passed by _ those caught in the welfare trap,'' he said.
   To deal with this, he said, his administration launched a
program encouraging states to come up with their own plans to get
people off the welfare rolls.
   ``Nearly half of the states have implemented or proposed
widespread welfare reform plans that build upon some good old
common sense _ that the best way to learn to work is to work,'' the
president said.
   ``Now, Congress appears to be close to a decision about welfare
reform and I have a message for them,'' he said. ``I will not
accept any welfare reform bill unless it is geared to making people
independent of welfare.''
   A House-Senate conference committee currently has before it a
Senate-passed bill that contains a work requirement and a
House-approved measure that does not.
   ``Any bill not built around work is not true welfare reform,''
the president said. ``If Congress presents me with a bill that
replaces work with welfare expansion and that places the dignity of
self-sufficiency through work out of the reach of Americans on
welfare, I will use my veto pen.''
   Downey said that while more people than ever before are working,
``the fact is that the typical worker in America is no better off
today than he or she was 10 years ago; in fact things have gotten
worse.''
   The poorest 40 percent of American families, with incomes
adjusted for inflation, are worse off today than they were 10 years
ago; the richest 5 percent are better off than they were a decade
ago; and 32.5 million Americans remain mired in poverty, he said.
   The House bill, with training and education programs as well as
health and child-care benefits, would make welfare parents who work
better off than those who do not, said Downey, acting chairman of
the Ways and Means subcommittee on public assistance and
unemployment compensation.
   ``Yes, requiring a welfare recipient to work may be necessary,
but those requirements should be controlled by state and local
officials who administer our welfare programs, not federal
bureaucrats,'' Downey said.

<HEAD>Justice Minister Seeks Charges Against Rightist Leader For Pun</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHARLES CAMPBELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The justice minister asked a local prosecutor
Saturday to file charges against extreme-right leader Jean-Marie Le
Pen for making a play on words linking a Cabinet minister's name to
Nazi death camp ovens.
   Le Pen refused to apologize for his remark, saying it was up to
others to judge if the pun was ``in good taste or not.''
   Justice Minister Pierre Arpaillange said Le Pen should be
prosecuted under an 1881 law that makes it a criminal offense to
insult a Cabinet minister, a ministry statement said.
   Local prosecutors work under the Justice Ministry's direction,
and while the minister does not have authority to order a
prosecution his wishes are unlikely to be disregarded.
   Le Pen's reference to Michel Durafour, minister for the public
service in the government of Socialist Premier Michel Rocard, as
``Durafour-crematoire'' brought criticism and revulsion from
politicians, Jewish organizations and civil rights groups.
   ``Four'' is the French word for oven, and the crematoriums of
Nazi death camps are called ``fours-crematoires'' in French.
   Durafour said he had ``an infinite amount of contempt'' for Le
Pen, leader of the extreme-right National Front, who won 14 percent
of the vote in presidential elections April 24.
   ``I can see he regrets the passing of the good old days of the
Nazis, and wishes he could see them come again,'' Durafour said.
   Le Pen replied at a news conference, ``In that case, Mr.
Durafour is not just an imbecile but a dirty bum as well.''
   As for his pun, Le Pen said, ``Everyone can judge for himself
whether it was in good taste or not. It's not my problem.''
   Le Pen, who had fallen out of the political spotlight in recent
months, got the attention back Friday in a speech to a National
Front rally. He made repeated sarcastic references to Durafour, a
centrist who served as a Cabinet minister in conservative
governments in the 1970s.
   Durafour has said he decided to accept a post in Rocard's
Socialist-led government in part because of the rising influence of
the National Front on the right. He has been outspoken in calling
for all other political parties to refuse electoral alliances with
Le Pen.
   The anti-racism group SOS-Racism issued a statement saying Le
Pen ``continues to blow on the flames of antisemitism in our
country.''
   Henri Bulawko, vice president of the Representative Council of
Jewish Organizations of France, said Le Pen, ``carried away by his
fantasies, did not hesitate to insult the memory of the victims of
Nazism.''
   Politicians from the right and the left joined in blasting Le
Pen's remark.
   ``There are things one cannot let go. There are words with which
one does not make jokes,'' said Alain Juppe, secretary-general of
the conservative Rally for the Republic Party.
   ``Mr. Le Pen is showing what he is at heart: a racist and an
antisemite,'' said Jean-Jack Queyranne, spokesman for the Socialist
Party.
   The leftist newspaper Liberation and the rightist Le Figaro used
identical front-page headlines Saturday: ``Le Pen Does It Again.''
   Last year, Le Pen drew harsh criticism for calling the Nazi gas
chambers ``a detail of World War II history.'' He is often accused
of being racist and antisemitic, but denies the charges, saying he
is simply pro-French.
   Le Pen's voting strength poses a delicate problem for the
rightist and centrist parties, especially in municipal elections
next spring.
   Control of dozens of cities and regional councils could depend
on whether the National Front supports center-right candidates or
opposes them. If the National Front splits the traditional rightist
vote, the Socialists and Communists could win large numbers of city
council posts and mayoral races.
   National Front leaders have been calling for an open alliance
with the right.
   But many conservative leaders say their parties will do better
if they ignore Le Pen and hope his backers come around, while
others support making local tactical pacts with the National Front
to keep the left out of power.
   Leftist leaders have urged the traditional right to make a clean
break with Le Pen.

   The Cleveland National Air Show opened Saturday
with heightened safety rules in effect to protect spectators in the
aftermath of the West German air show disaster.
   The Coast Guard banned boats from the lakefront area during
performances running through Labor Day along Lake Erie.
   The Federal Aviation Administration _ even before the Aug. 28
disaster _ required high-speed aircraft at air shows to operate at
least 1,500 feet from spectators. That will put aircraft several
hundred feet out over the lake this weekend.
   Organizers gathered an array of vintage and late-model aircraft
for the city's 59th air show, including the British supersonic
Concorde, the B-1B bomber, a sail plane, the Harrier vertical
takeoff jet fighter, radio-controlled models and the 12-foot-long
BD-5 jet, the world's smallest.
   The Navy's Blue Angels precision flying team will take part.
   A spokesman for the Blue Angels, whose performances highlight
each afternoon of the show, said there had not been unusual public
interest in the team's appearance despite the disaster at Ramstein,
West Germany.
   In that disaster, three Italian jets collided during a
high-speed stunt, sending a flaming aircraft plunging into the
crowd of 300,000. Fifty-one people died, 15 remain unaccounted for
and more than 160 are hospitalized.
   One of the newest members of the Blue Angels, Lt. Cmdr. Mark
Ziegler, prepared for the weekend performances with two days of
practice flights across the lakefront.
   Ziegler, an 11-year Navy veteran who joined the Blue Angels in
October, said their maneuvers, with a maximum of six planes in the
air at a time, were breathtaking but less risky than the 10-plane,
three-direction maneuver that ended in disaster at Ramstein.
   ``There's no risk I perceive in this at all,'' he said, noting
that the Blue Angels have ``clear air space for every maneuver,''
allowing pilots room to operate if one of their FA-18 Hornets or a
pilot has a problem.
   Even a maneuver designed to appear as though two aircraft are
flying straight at one another at twice the speed of sound actually
has them 200 feet apart on opposite sides of a runway, he said.
   Such tactics intended to make a maneuver look risky without
taking a major risk are called ``cheats'' among the unit's 16
officers and 95 enlisted personnel, who are based at Pensacola, Fla.

<HEAD>Bush on Dukakis: He's A Better Debater</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TOM RAUM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Republican George Bush said Saturday he is
standing firm on his proposal for just two presidential debates
even though Democratic rival Michael Dukakis, whom he called a
``better debater,'' wants three.
   ``We've made a strong proposal that calls for two debates at
this level and one at the vice presidential level and we're going
to stay with it,'' Bush told reporters. ``I think it's the right
amount of this kind of campaign activity.''
   So far, the Bush and Duakakis camps have been unable to agree on
debate details with a deadlock over timing and number of debates.
Bush forces insist on no more than two debates, to be held between
Sept. 25 and Oct. 17.
   Bush labeled the Democratic presidential nominee ``a good
debater'' and recalled Dukakis' role in moderating the Public
Broadcasting System televison debate show, ``The Advocates,'' from
1971-73.
   ``He's probably a better debater,'' Bush told reporters he had
invited to lunch at his residence at the U.S. Naval Observatory.
   He added quickly, tongue-in-cheek: ``I'm lowering
expectations... My wife Barbara, when I practice debating, she
falls asleep. And I've got to do something different about that.''
   Barbara Bush, who was sitting on the grass among reporters at
the outdoor news conference, told reporters Bush's comments were
``not true.''
   Bush, who had no campaign events scheduled Saturday or Sunday,
begins a week-long campaign swing on Monday with several Labor Day
events planned in San Diego and Los Angeles. The vice president
said he would stress the economy and jobs in his Labor Day
appearances.
   On another subject, Bush said he was not concerned over
disclosures that the political consulting firm of Stuart Spencer
had been paid more than $350,000 in l985 and 1986 to assist the
Panamanian government headed by Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega.
Spencer is the chief political strategist for Indiana Sen. Dan
Quayle, Bush's running mate.
   ``Panama's a friendly country,'' Bush declared. ``And as he
(Spencer) made clear, I think, (Eric Arturo) Delvalle was the
president under which he was hired. So I have no concerns about
that. And I think he explained it pretty well.''
   Delvalle, the former civilian president of Panama, was
hand-picked by Noriega to run the country but was ousted by Noriega
in February. Bush did not elaborate on whether he thinks Panama is
still a friendly country.
   Responding to reporters' questions, Bush said that while he
disagreed strongly with Dukakis' veto of a Massachusetts bill
requiring teachers to lead students in the pledge of allegiance, he
would not propose such a law nationally.
   ``I happen to be a `federalist,''' Bush said, suggesting that
such matters should be left up to the states.
   When asked whether he would favor state laws that might punish
teachers _ including jail sentences _ for refusing to lead students
in the pledge, Bush said:
   ``I don't know if it's a jail offense. I think each state should
make that determination certainly. So I'm not advocating putting
any (teachers) in jail. What I am advocating is what I think of as
a fundamental value: that teachers ought to lead the kids in the
pledge of allegiance.''
   When pressed on the matter, and asked why he wouldn't advocate
jail terms for teachers who refused to follow such laws, Bush
snapped: ``I'm not going to make any punishment. I told you I'm
going to leave this matter to the states. I think states should
support their own laws. That's all that I have to say on that one.''
   Dukakis has said he vetoed the Massachusetts legislation after
being told by the state Supreme Court and other legal advisers that
it was unconstitutional. Bush has said Dukakis should have signed
it anyway.

   Flooding caused by the heaviest rains in
two decades have left 13 people dead and 7,000 homeless, the
minister of animal and water resources said Saturday.
   Boukar Ousmane, giving reporters an estimate of damage from
rains that have drenched most of the Sahel, also said more than 610
miles of roads were impassable and that the flooding washed out an
unknown number of bridges.
   He said the water covered about 250,000 acres of land and killed
at least 15,000 animals, including goats, cattle and sheep.
   But the heavy rains raised the Niger River to its highest levels
since record-keeping began in 1928 and promised to bring the best
harvests in 20 years. The rains continued Saturday morning in the
capital, Niamey.
   Officials were concerned, however, that portions of the crop
were threatened by a massive influx of crickets.

   Former Atlantic City Mayor Michael J.
Matthews changed prisons last week, and he did it all on his own.
   Matthews, who is serving a 15-year term for extortion, was
permitted to travel by himself Wednesday on a commercial flight
from Texas to Pennsylvania.
   No handcuffs, no shackles, no chaperones.
   After he arrived at the airport in Allenwood, Matthews took a
cab to the federal prison here.
   ``Two shocks in one day,'' the former mayor said Thursday night.
``First they told me I was going back, then they told me I was
going back on my own.''
   Matthews has been seeking a transfer to a prison closer to
Atlantic City since his 1984 sentencing.
   There was no answer at the warden's office Saturday and a
correctional officer said no one was available to comment.

   Singer-songwriter Tracy Chapman, whose hit debut
album chronicles the lives of the poor and disenfranchised, says
many in her audiences don't come for her politics.
   ``I think lots of people come because they love the music, they
love the way the record sounds, or they love my voice, and they

   Sen. William Proxmire hasn't missed a Senate
roll call since April 1966. That's more than 10,000 roll calls,
surpassing the record of 2,941 held by former Sen. Margaret Chase
Smith of Maine.
   ``You're elected to vote,'' the Wisconsin Democrat said. ``Of
course, some people would say the country would have been better
off if I'd missed them all.''
   Proxmire, who turns 73 in November, soon will see the streak
end. He announced last year he would retire when his term ends in
January.
   The senator has gained much of his fame for his monthly ``Golden
Fleece'' awards for government projects Proxmire considers wasteful.
   ``My primary role has been a watchdog over spending,'' said
Proxmire. ``I'd like to leave a legacy of people thinking about how
much things cost.''

   Former screen siren Hedy Lamarr
has reported the theft of $250,000 in jewelry from her home here,
but police aren't hopping on the case.
   Detectives said the home showed no signs of a forced entry, and
they haven't received a list of the items taken.
   ``The last time she saw it was two or three months ago,''
Detective Frank DeAlimi said Friday of Ms. Lamarr's jewelry.
   He said the investigation is on hold until he receives a call
from Tiffany & Co. jewelry store in New York to confirm that the

   Federal regulators said Saturday that talks
with a Texas investment group on the rescue of American Savings and
Loan Association, Stockton, Calif., would continue through Monday.
   ``Discussions ... continue and a further announcement is planned
for Monday,'' said Karl Hoyle, spokesman for the Federal Home Loan
Bank Board.
   The regulators have been negotiating with the Robert M. Bass
Group of Fort Worth, Texas, over the rescue of the nation's largest
insolvent savings institution.
   According to industry sources, the proposal under discussion
involves a contribution of about $500 million from the Bass Group
and about $2 billion in assistance from the bank board, which would
make it the largest rescue ever of a single savings and loan.
   American is owned by Irvine, Calif.-based Financial Corp. of
America, the second-largest thrift holding company in the country
with $30.2 billion in assets as of June 30.
   Hoyle declined to characterize the discussions or identify the
issues that have been holding up resolution of the talks since
Thursday.
   The FCA rescue would be the latest in a series of large
transactions since mid-August cleaning up insolvent thrift
associations. Since Aug. 18, the bank board has committed $10.2
billion in aid to rescue 46 savings institutions, including 21 in
Texas and 14 in Oklahoma.

<HEAD>Union Spokesman Says They'll Eventually Win Case To Stop Layoffs</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>

   A Machinists official said the union will fight a
federal appeals court ruling allowing Eastern Airlines to lay off
4,000 employees as soon as the money-losing carrier posts a $4.7
million bond.
   ``This is not the end of the world,'' Bob Taylor, head of
Eastern's Machinists local in Atlanta, said of the U.S. Court of
Appeals ruling Friday night. ``I still feel confident that we will
be proven right'' in a higher court.
   The court in Washington, D.C., granted Eastern's request to set
aside an injunction barring the layoffs, said Clark Onstad, a vice
president at Eastern's parent company, Texas Air Corp. of Houston.
   Eastern lawyer John J. Gallagher in Washington said it was
unclear when the carrier could post the amount and begin layoffs.
   Miami-based Eastern has lost about $1 billion in the past decade.
   It has been locked in battle with its unions to cut labor costs,
which the airline contends are responsible for its losses. The
Machinists are to vote Sept. 15 on a company proposal for $161
million in annual wage concessions.
   Unions contend Texas Air is cannibalizing Eastern in favor of
the company's non-union Continental Airlines.
   Eastern planned to layoff the workers and eliminate service to
14 cities last week to help return to profitability.
   The unions sued, and U.S. District Judge Barrington Parker ruled
Tuesday in Washington that Eastern could reduce its flight schedule
by 12 percent as planned but could not undertake mass layoffs
without negotiating with its unions.
   Eastern appealed, and its request was granted by Judges James L.
Buckley and Stephen F. Williams of the U.S. Court of Appeals.
   ``As we hoped, the Court of Appeals wasted no time in
overturning the order of the lower court, which we believed was
wrong as a matter of law,'' said Eastern spokeswoman Karen Ceremsak.
   Eastern contended a federal judge should not be able to restrict
management's ability to make cost-cutting moves it deems necessary.
   The layoffs had been scheduled to take effect Wednesday, when
the service was dropped. Employees in Kansas City, Mo.; Atlanta and
the metropolitan New York area were to be the most seriously
affected.
   Eastern eliminated its hub at Kansas City and sharply curtailed
service to the West. Remaining are its routes in the East, the
Caribbean and South America.

   Here is the text of President
Reagan's weekly radio address delivered Saturday.
   My fellow Americans, Labor Day weekend is a time to remember the
importance of work and family in our nation's life. And on this
Labor Day, we Americans have much to remember and to give thanks
for.
   Yes, today more of us have jobs than ever before, and just
yesterday we learned that in August, as great a proportion of us
have jobs as ever before and that the unemployment rate hovered
just above the lowest it's been in 14 years.
   Since our recovery began, America has created more than 17.5
million jobs, 2.5 times more jobs than France, Britain, Germany,
Italy, Canada, and Japan put together. Our expansion has created
jobs in nearly all sectors of the economy, more than a million in
manufacturing, more than a million in construction, millions more
still in services from banking and insurance to computer
programming.
   And you can find these new jobs in every region, from the
industrial Midwest, where new industries are springing up and old
industries are running at full capacity, to the South, where the
economy is strong and getting stronger, to our coasts, where our
success in opening international markets is helping America export
more than ever before in history, and these rising exports and the
declining trade imbalance will create even more jobs all around the
nation in the months ahead.
   But not only do we have more jobs, we have better jobs at better
pay. On average, the jobs created in our expansion pay more and
require a higher level of skills than the jobs that existed when
our expansion began.
   This is just one of the reasons why. If your family is like most
families between 1977 and 1981, after taking out the sky-high
inflation of those years, you saw your income fall almost seven
percent. But since 1981, that is, since the year we came to office,
your real income has soared more than ten percent.
   To give one example of what this means, in the year we took
office, the average family made only about 70 percent of what it
needed to buy a new home. Today, that family makes 110 percent of
what it needs and it can afford to buy the house.
   Leaders all over the world have asked how we achieved this
growth and prosperity. Well, my answer is simple: less government,
more freedom, and moving toward a more open and equitable
international economy.
   Thanks to our expansion, nearly 3 million Americans have escaped
poverty, but this week we got a warning. While we learned that last
year family income went up and that the poverty rate dropped
slightly, we also learned that some groups lagged behind in the
past year. We've assisted many of our fellow citizens through the
Job Training Partnership Act. Sponsored chiefly by Senator Dan
Quayle, this legislation has been very effective in retraining
citizens to become productive wage earners again.
   But there are still some Americans whom our expansion has passed
by, those caught in the welfare trap. Programs that were intended
to help poor citizens, have instead made them dependent on
government checks, unable to break away and become productive
workers in a growing economy. In the name of compassion, too many
Americans on welfare have been robbed of the one priceless item
with which they could build a future -- hope.
   It's time to return hope to those on welfare, which is why our
administration has worked to reform the welfare system. For
starters, we took a simple principle _ that Washington doesn't know
everything _ and instead of dictating reforms, we told the 50
states that we'd approve any experiment intended to reduce
dependency. Our only conditions: that needs would continue to be
met, that there'd be no net increase in federal costs, and that
results could be measured. One state after another responded, until
now, nearly half of the states have implemented, or proposed,
widespread welfare reform plans that build upon some good old
common sense. That the best way to learn to work, is to work.
   Our administration is trying to join with Congress to take what
we've learned with the states, and establish work requirements into
the federal law. Now, Congress appears to be close to a decision
about welfare reform _ and I have a message for them _ I will not
accept any Welfare Reform Bill unless it is geared to making people
independent of welfare. Any bill not built around work, is not true
welfare reform. If Congress presents me with a bill that replaces
work with welfare expansion, and that places the dignity of
self-sufficiency through work out of the reach of Americans on
welfare, I will use my veto pen.
   While others have talked about good jobs and good wages, we've
delivered. Now, it's time for Congress to join with us in making
sure that the opportunities created by this prosperity, reach into
every American home. Until next week, thanks for listening, and God
bless you.

   Here is the text of the Democratic response
delivered Saturday to President Reagan's weekly radio address. The
speech was delivered by Rep. Tom Downey, D-N.Y.
   This is Congressman Tom Downey from Long Island, New York. This
weekend we celebrate the working men and women of America and their
families who have done so much to make this country great.
   Just as we began the summer by commemorating those who gave
their lives to defend our nation, it is fitting that we close by
honoring the accomplishments of those who work so hard to make this
nation worth defending.
   American workers have toiled long and hard to produce what we
enjoy today. They have bent their backs and their minds to whatever
tasks were at hand. They built the roads, tamed the plains, raised
the great cities; and, along the way, they stopped to raise their
families, educate their children, and create a strong sense of
national pride.
   No one has done more for the working men and women of this
country than the Democratic Party. We have fought for the right to
organize and bargain collectively. The struggle for a fair day's
wage for a fair day's work was the Democratic struggle. The
Democratic Party led the fight to improve working conditions and to
make health and safety a primary concern in the workplace. The
Democratic Party has worked with working men and women for improved
education, for affordable housing, for better healthcare, and for a
strong national defense.
   Together we have achieved a great deal, but there is much that
remains to be done. Today there over 115 million of us working.
Never before have so many of us been working, and we are justly
proud of that fact, but we ask whether all of us are better off
today.
   Not too long ago, President Reagan reminded us that ``facts are
stubborn things,'' and just this week, the Census Bureau released
the figures on wealth and poverty for 1987. The results are
disappointing for working Americans.
   The fact is that the typical worker in America is no better off
today than he or she was ten years ago. In fact, things have gotten
worse. The gap between the rich and the working poor threatens to
become a chasm. Since the Census Bureau began collecting income
data in 1947, the gap between rich and poor families has never been
so great. The fact is that adjusted for inflation, the poorest 40
percent of American families are worse off today than they were ten
years ago. At the same time, the richest five percent are better
off today than they were ten years ago by an average of over
$16,000.
   We must wonder why an administration which prides itself on
producing so much wealth has such a dismal record when it comes to
working people. The facts tell us that five years of the
president's economic boom has done nothing to reduce poverty in the
United States. Despite a low unemployment rate, 32.5 million
Americans remain mired in poverty. Imagine everyone living in the
states of Pennsylvania, Missouri, Florida and Arizona being poor.
That's what 32 million people represent.
   In fact, the poverty rate is higher than at any time in the 70s.
In 1987, there were 8 million more poor Americans than there were
in 1978. Clearly, economic growth alone will not help these people.
   These Census figures reveal that there are a million and a half
more children living in poverty now than there were when President
Reagan was elected in 1980. Today one child out of every five lives
in poverty. That is unacceptable.
   Tragically, poverty rates have been higher, on average, during
President Reagan's administration, than they were in the Nixon,
Ford, or Carter administrations. This President has done less than
any other recent president to help those who are struggling so hard
to make their way. Is it any wonder that so many people believe
this adminstration has turned its back on the working poor of this
country.
   Democrats are concerned about those Americans who are working
hard to provide a good life for their families. Democrats in both
the House and Senate have passed a Family Welfare Reform Bill that
helps poor families move off welfare. This bill would give families
the training and education they need to find work. The bill would
also provide health and childcare benefits so that they can keep
the jobs they find.
   Democrats believe in the simple proposition that work should
make a person better off. This bill provides incentives so that
welfare parents who work are better off than those who do not.
   Unfortunately, this administration seems more eager to punish
the poor. Yes, requiring a welfare recipient to work may be
necessary, but those requirements should be controlled by state and
local officials who administer our welfare programs, not federal
bureaucrats.
   This bill is paid for. We have compromised and walked the
additional mile to gain the President's support. On behalf of those
mothers who are struggling to care for their children and get off
welfare, I strongly urge the President to help us pass the
compromise version of this bill and put more American families to
work.

   President Reagan warned Saturday
that he will veto any welfare legislation Congress sends him that
does not contain a work requirement.
   ``The best way to learn to work is to work,'' the president said
in a Labor Day weekend radio address from his vacation ranch 20
miles north of here.
   Rep. Thomas J. Downey, D-N.Y., in the Democrats' response, said
that requiring welfare recipients work may be necessary, but he
said such requirements should be controlled by state and local
welfare officials, not the federal government.
   Reagan mingled talk of welfare reform with celebration of his
administration's economic record, saying Friday's unemployment
figures showed that the jobless rate ``hovered just above the
lowest it's been in 14 years.''
   The figures from the Labor Department showed unemployment of 5.6
percent, up from 5.4 percent in July and from the May figure of 5.3
per cent, which was a 14-year low.
   ``But there are still some Americans whom our expansion has
passed by _ those caught in the welfare trap,'' he said.
   To deal with this, he said, his administration launched a
program encouraging states to come up with their own plans to get
people off the welfare rolls.
   ``Nearly half of the states have implemented or proposed
widespread welfare reform plans that build upon some good old
common sense _ that the best way to learn to work is to work,'' the
president said.
   ``Now, Congress appears to be close to a decision about welfare
reform and I have a message for them,'' he said. ``I will not
accept any welfare reform bill unless it is geared to making people
independent of welfare.''
   A House-Senate conference committee currently has before it a
Senate-passed bill that contains a work requirement and a
House-approved measure that does not.
   ``Any bill not built around work is not true welfare reform,''
the president said. ``If Congress presents me with a bill that
replaces work with welfare expansion and that places the dignity of
self-sufficiency through work out of the reach of Americans on
welfare, I will use my veto pen.''
   Downey said that while more people than ever before are working,
``the fact is that the typical worker in America is no better off
today than he or she was 10 years ago; in fact things have gotten
worse.''
   The poorest 40 percent of American families, with incomes
adjusted for inflation, are worse off today than they were 10 years
ago; the richest 5 percent are better off than they were a decade
ago; and 32.5 million Americans remain mired in poverty, he said.
   The House bill, with training and education programs as well as
health and child-care benefits, would make welfare parents who work
better off than those who do not, said Downey, acting chairman of
the Ways and Means subcommittee on public assistance and
unemployment compensation.
   ``Yes, requiring a welfare recipient to work may be necessary,
but those requirements should be controlled by state and local
officials who administer our welfare programs, not federal
bureaucrats,'' Downey said.

<TEXT>
   Solidarity leader Lech Walesa succeeded in
stopping Poland's strongest wave of strikes in seven years Saturday
when 250 coal miners ended a sit-in and 2,400 bus and dock workers
cut short a strike.
   The 19-day wave of strikes, which involved 100,000 employees
nationwide, ended in a whirlwind of appeals and arm-twisting.
Walesa urged supporters to end local disputes so that promised
roundtable talks could begin on union pluralism and legalizing
Solidarity.
   The labor unrest was the strongest challenge to communist
authorities since they crushed the Soviet bloc's first independent
labor federation with the 1981 martial law crackdown.
   Walesa said the strikes were a warning to authorities to meet
workers' demands and that if they fail, ``all this will be repeated
again ... stronger and more dangerous, and that problem will be
even more difficult to solve.''
   Walesa said he had had to convince the striking miners ``that
despite everything Polish problems can be resolved only when the
hand is outstretched for reconciliation.''
   Strikers at the July Manifesto coal mine near the southern town
of Jastrzebie, where the nationwide strikes began Aug. 16, carried
a Solidarity banner as they marched out in a steady rain at about 6
a.m. after 15 hours of negotiations among Walesa, strikers and
management.
   In the Baltic port city of Szczecin, about 1,800 dock workers
abandoned a strike at 12:15 p.m. and 600 bus workers about an hour
earlier. The port and the city's main bus depot had been occupied
by strikers since Aug. 17.
   During the strikes, Poland's two biggest ports were virtually
shut down and production of coal from the Silesia region, a vital
source of hard currency, was sharply reduced. Authorities claimed
losses of tens of millions of dollars.
   Police ended some strikes, but the final breakthrough came when
the government agreed to the first high-level meeting between
Walesa and authorities since 1982.
   After that meeting Wednesday and the promise of further talks,
Walesa put his personal reputation on the line to end the strikes
despite opposition from many strikers.
   Solidarity and authorities are readying lists of proposed
participants for the roundtable, which could start any day, said
Roman Catholic mediator Jacek Ambroziak in Warsaw.
   ``Lech is really pushing for it. He would like talks to begin
next week and hopes to be ready then,'' said Solidarity adviser the
Rev. Henryk Jankowski of Gdansk, who returned Saturday with Walesa
from Jastrzebie.
   Weary, unshaven miners walked two miles in the rain to a church
where a priest celebrated Mass for strikers, their families and
supporters from other mines. They carried their belongings in
plastic bags and sang the national anthem.
   Miners from other Jastrzebie-area mines awaited the strikers at
the church and chanted, ``Thank you, thank you.''
   ``Everybody was very nervous throughout, but all the strikers
acted responsibly, and that's the most important thing,'' said
Grzegorz Stawski, a member of the strike committee. ``Walesa helped
us out a lot. He helped map the way out of our situation.''
   Miners had demanded that Walesa come in person and explain why
they should end their stoppage, and when he arrived the discussions
were ``very hot and tense'' said Jankowski.
   Guaranteeing strike organizers would not be fired was the last
stumbling block in talks to end the strike, said Jan Litynski, a
Solidarity adviser who was at the mine.
   The strike ended exactly eight years after the government signed
accords with striking coal miners in Jastrzebie during the upheaval
that gave rise to Solidarity.
   A string of police vehicles pulled out of the city Saturday
morning, road blocks were dismantled and no strike banners remained
at the mine.
   Port and transit workers in Szczecin offered early Friday
evening to stop their strikes as soon as job security was
guaranteed for strikers at the bus depot, said strike committee
member Artur Balasz.
   Management said it would meet the demands but then withdrew its
promise, he said. But workers decided to leave the port and
strikebound bus terminal anyway and await Walesa's talks with the
government.
   ``We state that we will continue our struggle,'' workers said in
a communique issued by the committee.
   Balasz said the workers ended their strike as ``an expression of
support for Lech Walesa. We just wanted to follow his suggestions.''
   Shipyard and port workers in Gdansk and steel workers in the
southeastern city of Stalowa Wola ended strikes Thursday after the
appeal from Walesa.
   On Wednesday, during Walesa's first meeting with senior
authorities since 1982, Interior Minister Czeslaw Kiszczak and
Alternate Politburo member Stanislaw Ciosek agreed to discuss the
union's future and other issues at the roundtable as soon as
strikes ended. Church and representatives of official trade unions
were also expected to take part, said Solidarity sources.
   Miners at the July Manifesto mine started the wave of strikes,
disgruntled by paychecks that they said fell short of promises.
They demanded better working conditions and higher wages to
compensate for inflation of about 60 percent.
   But like other strikers around the country who quickly joined
the strikes, their No. 1 demand became legalization of Solidarity.
   Communist authorities guaranteed the right to free trade unions
in an agreement signed Aug. 31, 1980 in Gdansk, opening the way to
legal registration of Solidarity.
   Even after it was suppressed in the December 1981 martial law
crackdown and outlawed in October 1982, it survived, first mainly
as an underground organization and more openly in recent years.

   Call it the lost summer. Call it the biggest
beach scare since Jaws hit town. ``Just call it over and let's get
on with it,'' said New York's top parks official.
   The fact that the summer of 1988 has ended is the only good
thing many can say after Northeast beaches were sullied by medical
waste and sewage.
   ``You can write off the summer of '88,'' said city Parks
Commissioner Henry Stern. ``It turned out to be the year of the
plague.''
   With one of the hottest summers in 119 years _ the temperature
in Manhattan passed the 90-degree mark 32 times _ it should have
been a banner year.
   But the tide turned in June when the first wave of medical
debris, AIDS contaminated hypodermic needles, appeared in Bayonne,
N.J.; and then Long Island, and Staten Island and Coney Island, and
a string of beaches on the Jersey shore.
   Medical waste also turned up on beaches in Connecticut, Rhode
Island and Massachusetts and at Lake Erie's Cleveland Lakefront
State Park in Ohio.
   John J. Gaines, president of the Narragansett Chamber of
Commerce in Rhode Island, believes the state benefited from the
mess when tourists from New York and Connecticut headed north. He
said tourism was up as much as 24 percent.
   Connecticut also was plagued by hypodermic needles, syringes and
high coliform counts at the beach, but the local economy did not
suffer greatly; a majority of the beaches are privately owned.
   In New Jersey and New York, vacationers and day visitors stayed
away by the hundreds of thousands, and everyone from motel owners
to local fishermen and parking lot attendants was hard hit.
   ``It was like a great shark scare,'' said Stern. ``People stayed
away from the beaches waiting for the all clear signal, and it
never came.''
   More than 1,000 pieces of medical debris were scooped up at city
beaches from the Bronx to Staten Island, said Stern.
   An investigation failed to pinpoint the source of the problem. A
state report said it was probably caused by sewer runoff, illegal
dumping and a laundry list of other reasons.
   ``The possibility is that we will never know,'' said city
Sanitation Department spokesman Jim Hart.
   New Jersey merchants estimate it will cost the $7.7
billion-a-year shore industry more than $1 billion in lost revenue.
State officials said figures aren't complete.
   The Long Island tourism board estimated business was off at
least 20 percent. In Brighton Beach, Brooklyn, a seashore community
that depends on a hearty summer to survive, business plummeted 40
percent to 60 percent.
   ``We were only closed for two days in July, just two days,''
said Ben Liederman, of the Brighton Industrial Development Group.
``But the scare alone ...''
   The incidents were isolated, but everyone seemed to pay the
price. ``They closed six beaches out of 480; four miles out of
1,600 miles of coastline,'' said David J. Lee, vice president of
the Long Island Tourism Commission. ``It was minuscule.''
   New Jersey officials tried to counter the bad publicity by
spending an extra $575,000 in advertising to attract visitors, said
Liz Thomas, deputy director of the Department of Travel and Tourism.
   Some merchants plan aggressive advertising campaigns to lure
beachgoers back, while others will continue pushing elected
officials to make sure the issue is not dropped once the headlines
_ and the summer _ fade.
   ``I didn't ever want to get involved,'' said Jeff Konner, owner
of the Sea Spray Motel in Shipbottom, N.J. ``But now I'll take a
day off and go up with a group to Trenton.''
   ``This is my life here,'' he said. ``Everything I own is
invested in this place.''
   Officials are considering laws aimed at tracking medical waste
from its point of origin and requiring labels on all hospital and
laboratory debris.
   But, said National Park Service spokesman Manny Strumpf, ``Even
assuming the beaches are going to be clean next year ... it's going
to be one hell of a selling job,'' to get the public back.

<HEAD>Former Turkish Prime Minister Dead at 82</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ANKARA, Turkey (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former Prime Minister Ferit Melen died
Saturday of heart trouble, the semi-official Anatolia News Agency
reported. He was 82.
   Melen served as finance minister in several governments and was
named prime minister in 1972 during a succession of ``above party''
governments after a military takeover resulted in several
appointments to the Turkish cabinet.
   In the October 1973 general elections, Bulent Ecevit was elected
prime minister to replace Melen as part of a coalition government.
Turgut Ozal is the current prime minister.
   Melen also served as defense minister in the late 1970s. In 1986
he cofounded a minor political party that stressed closer Turkish
ties to the United States and the Western world.

   Republican vice presidential nominee Dan Quayle
defended his campaign manager Saturday, saying he saw no reason for
him to step aside just because he had once lobbied for the
government of Panamanian Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega.
   At a news conference, Quayle gave his first detailed response to
revelations that his campaign manager, Stuart Spencer, had done
consulting work for the government run by Noriega. Quayle said
Spencer, a longtime GOP strategist and Reagan intimate, was ``a
political pro'' whose advice he needed.
   ``I believe that his political experience and political guidance
has been and will be valuable to me,'' Quayle said.
   The New Republic this week said that a public relations firm run
by Spencer was paid $350,000 in 1985-86 to lobby for Noriega,
Panama's military strongman and reputed drug kingpin.
   According to the article, the firm lobbied against drug
investigations of Noriega and defended him against allegations of
killing Dr. Hugo Spadafora, one of Noriega's most outspoken
critics, in September 1985.
   Quayle said he met Spencer for the first time last month when he
became George Bush's running mate and Spencer, a veteran of both
Reagan presidential campaigns, came to handle his campaign.
   ``I did not know about this'' at the time, Quayle said,
referring to Spencer's lobbying for Noriega.
   However, Quayle noted that Spencer's consulting contract had
expired several years ago and that Spencer had advised Panama's
civilian president at the time, Eric Arturo Delvalle, that Panama
should be run by a civilian rather than military government.
Noriega ousted Delvalle in February.
   ``They'd be in a much better situation had they accepted his
advice on that. That's about all I know,'' Quayle said.
   Quayle reaffirmed his position that ``Noriega has got to go ...
the sooner the better.'' When asked whether that statement also
applied to Spencer, Quayle replied, ``No.''
   Bush, meeting with reporters outside his Washington residence,
also defended Spencer. ``Panama's a friendly country,'' Bush said.
``And as he made clear, I think, Delvalle was the president under
which he was hired. So I have no concerns about that. And I think
he explained it pretty well.''
   Quayle was also asked to elaborate on his comment Friday that
the decision of Democratic presidential nominee Michael Dukakis to
rehire former top aide John Sasso as his campaign vice chairman
meant that Dukakis' campaign was in serious trouble.
   Sasso resigned in September 1987 after admitting that he
circulated a videotape of Sen. Joseph Biden using a British
politician's rhetoric without attribution.
   ``I guess you would say that the liberal furlough policy of the
governor of Massachusetts is still in place,'' Quayle said, a jibe
at the state's weekend prison-release program. Dukakis signed a
bill cutting back the program after a murderer on a weekend
furlough raped a Maryland woman.
   At an arts and crafts fair in Newnan, Ga., a reporter asked
Quayle if he was concerned that Georgia voters might be swayed by
Sen. Sam Nunn, a Democrat and Dukakis supporter, when it came to
their presidential choice. Nunn is chairman of the Senate Armed
Services Committee, a committee on which Quayle serves.
   ``This is a pro-defense state. The pro-defense presidential
choice is is George Bush, not Michael Dukakis,'' Quayle said.
   During his visit to the fair, Quayle was given a rocking chair
and a sketch depicting a turkey-calling contest. On the sketch, in
a reference to the news media, was an inscription which read, ``No
matter how loud they gobble they are still turkeys.''
   Quayle and his wife Marilyn have said they feel reporters have
been overzealous in pursuing various controversies about the
senator's military service, academic record and personal life.
   After the Georgia appearances, Quayle traveled to Columbia,
S.C., where he attended the University of South Carolina football
season opener against the University of North Carolina.

Exports</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: SUBS grafs 6-7, The chamber, to clarify that bills included
notification for mass layoffs and plant closings; SUBS grafs 11-12,
But private, with three grafs to add background on earlier drafts
of trade bill</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By MARTIN CRUTSINGER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   American businesses are mobilizing to take
advantage of the new trade law while economists still fret that
even in its watered-down form the measure could spark harmful
retaliation against U.S. exports.
   The three-year battle to get the landmark legislation through
Congress marks only the beginning of a bigger fight to make sure
that the law is fully utilized, supporters contend.
   To that end, lobbying organizations for both business and labor
groups are briefing their members on the details of the 1,000-page
bill, which President Reagan signed into law on Aug. 23.
   The U.S. Chamber of Commerce has prepared a detailed guide to
acquaint business leaders with a law that Chamber President Richard
Lesher calls a ``turning point in U.S. economic history.'' In
addition, the chamber is preparing a videotape and will offer
seminars both in the United States and abroad.
   ``We have prepared a very extensive program to inform U.S. and
foreign businesses of the impact of this legislation on current
operations and its implications for long-range planning,'' Lesher
said.
   The chamber and many other business groups opposed the trade
bill as it was first passed, objecting to a provision that would
have required companies to give workers advanced notice of mass
layoffs and plant closings.
   Reagan vetoed the original trade law primarily because of the
plant closing section but reversed course later and allowed a
separate bill with just the layoffs and plant-closing legislation
to become law without his signature.
   The chamber's guide seeks to explain the complex trade law in
laymen's language and at the same time explode what the business
group believes are myths about the legislation.
   ``There has been an enormous amount of misunderstanding about
what this trade bill is,'' said William T. Archey, the chamber's
top trade expert. He blamed this on the fact that the legislation
took three years to emerge from Congress with much of the early
attention focused on heavily protectionist provisions that were
jettisoned from the final product.
   ``I think those who would argue that it is protectionist should
be required to read it first,'' Archey said.
   But private economists still worry about provisions, made less
stringent in the final version of the bill, that will make it
easier for the United States to impose import curbs in retaliation
for alleged unfair trading practices by other nations. They contend
that this could prompt other countries to retaliate by raising
barriers against U.S. products.
   Earlier drafts of the measure contained langauge that would have
given the president no discretion in retaliating against unfair
trade practices by countries running large surpluses with the
United States, such as Japan.
   Private economists note that foreign reaction to the greater
possibility of import curbs has been overwhelmingly negative from
both the Far East and Europe.
   ``We have made a lot of people overseas mad and there is always
the risk that they will react negatively to the pressure we are
applying to get them to open up their markets,'' said David Wyss,
of Data Resources Inc., a Lexington, Mass. economic forecasting
firm.
   Since the legislation gives the president a large amount of
leeway in deciding whether to retaliate, both presidential
candidates are being watched carefully for clues on how they would
handle the new law.
   ``The law by itself is not going to solve the trade problem. But
it provides the tools to an executive who wants to address the
problem forcefully,'' said Mark Anderson, an economist with the
AFL-CIO.
   Anderson said that Vice President George Bush would likely
continue the free-trade emphasis of the Reagan years while
Democratic nominee Michael Dukakis has pledged a more forceful
attack on the country's huge trade deficits. The AFL-CIO has
endorsed Dukakis.
   Other economists agreed that Dukakis would be more activist on
trade matters than Bush, but they said that even a Democratic
administration would not utilize the full powers of the legislation
for fear of retaliation.
   ``Both of these candidates are basically internationalists.
Dukakis would be tougher than Bush, but I don't think the risk of a
trade war is that great because I don't think Dukakis is going to
push the bill to its limit,'' Wyss said.
   The first sign of the new administration's intention is likely
to come next April when the legislation requires the U.S. trade
representative, an appointee of the president, to produce a list of
targeted countries along with a plan for negotiations aimed at
removing trade barriers.
   Countries with large surpluses such as Japan, West Germany and
Korea are likely candidates to be on the list.
   Long before then, however, the trade law should have a positive
impact on exports of such high-technology equipment as computers.
The law substantially reduces licensing requirements for these
exports.
   While the original rules were designed to prevent
defense-related equipment from falling into the hands of the Soviet
Union or its allies, supporters of the change contended that
American businesses were losing $9.3 billion annually in sales
because of unnecessary licensing requirements. The change is
expected to eliminate the need for more than 25,000 export licenses
a year on products deemed to be of little use militarily.

<TEXT>
   Federal authorities arrested a political
foe of Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi on Saturday and accused him of
conspiring to murder India's top badminton player after having an
affair with the sportsman's wife.
   Opposition leaders said the suspect, Sanjay Singh, was the
victim of a political vendetta. He also was defended by the wife of
the badminton star.
   Singh, 32, was arrested in Lucknow, the capital of Uttar Pradesh
state, in connection with the July 28 slaying of Syed Modi, India's
top-ranked badminton player, said an official of the Central Bureau
of Investigation.
   Authorities have evidence that Singh had an affair with Modi's
wife, Ameeta, and conspired with her to murder the sportsman, said
the official. The official, based in New Delhi, cannot be
identified under briefing rules.
   Under Indian law, formal charges must be brought within 90 days
and a prosector must explain the grounds Singh's arrest within 24
hours.
   Soon after the arrest, Mrs. Modi, 24, said the killer was still
free. ``I cannot believe Sanjay Singh could murder my husband,''
she told the United News of India news agency in Lucknow. ``He was
Modi's closest friend.''
   The arrest also drew criticism from Jan Morcha, or People's
Movement, an opposition group to which Singh belongs. ``I am not
surprised at the arrest,'' said Arun Nehru, a party leader and
Gandhi's cousin. ``It is the natural culmination of a motivated
investigation.''
   Jan Morcha broke away from Gandhi's governing Congress Party and
is highly critical of the prime minister. Singh is not a
politically powerful outside Uttar Pradesh but he commands
considerable influence in Amethi, the prime minister's
parliamentary constituency.
   Singh was a close ally of Gandhi and his campaign manager during
the last elections to Parliament in 1985. Singh is the scion of the
former royal family of Amethi, and although titles were abolished
in India in 1971, former maharajahs and princes still have a large
following.
   Singh fell out with Gandhi last year after differences with the
Uttar Pradesh chief minister. When Gandhi sided with the chief
minister, the highest elected official in the state, Singh quit the
Congress Party. He has vowed not to let Gandhi win any further
elections from Amethi.
   Modi, 28, was shot with a Colt .38-caliber revolver as he
stepped out of a Lucknow sports stadium, where had gone for his
customary evening round of practise. The Uttar Pradesh government
asked the Central Bureau of Investigation, patterned on the FBI, to
take over the case on Aug. 2.
   On Aug. 16, bureau detectives arrested four people, including an
associate of Singh, on murder charges. Ameeta Modi was later
arrested on charges of conspiring in the murder after unidentified
sources in the bureau told newspapers they had evidence that she
had an affair with Singh.
   Mrs. Modi was released on bail when she said she had no one to
care for her 6-month-old daughter. In India, people arrested on
murder charges usually are not released on bail.
   Singh was questioned several times by investigators in recent
weeks. On a visit to New Delhi last week, he told reporters: ``This
is the worst kind of political vendetta. The Prime Minister and his
coterie are using government agencies to intimidate the opposition.
Their plan is to discredit me in order to give Rajiv Gandhi a
victory in the next general elections.''
   His Lucknow residence was also searched by detectives of the
bureau, and the search drew sharp criticism after it was televised
on state-owned national television.
   ``They want to try Sanjay Singh through electronic media,'' said
Arif Mohammed Khan, also a Jan Morcha leader. ``They want to finish
him.''

<TEXT>
   A woman walks aimlessly through
the information center at Ramstein U.S. Air Force Base calling out
``Hans,'' the name of her missing husband.
   In a hospital in nearby Kaiserslautern, the mother of a young
child screams and faints when she realizes the boy's face has been
burned away.
   At an emergency burn center near Mannheim, a mother weeps
quietly and says, ``It would be better if our daughter does not
survive.''
   These are scenes from the aftermath of the Ramstein air show a
week ago, when three Italian jets collided during a stunt and one
crashed into a huge crowd of spectators and exploded.
   Fifty-one people died, 15 remain unaccounted for and more than
160 are hospitalized.
   Within an hour after Sunday's crash, volunteers set up a
casualty information center in the base theater to help locate the
missing.
   ``People were crying and in a panic,'' recalled Airman Stoney
Glover, a volunteer who was working at the center shortly after the
disaster.
   ``They were shaking and looking desperately to find their
relatives,'' Glover said. A few hours after the crash, ``one woman
just wandered through the hall in a daze, calling out the name of a
missing relative,'' he said.
   About 300,000 people attended the show and watched in horror as
three Italian jets collided during a high-speed stunt, sending one
flaming aircraft plunging into the crowd.
   Hundreds of spectators rushed to the information center
immediately after the crash, Glover said.
   ``By then the area at the crash site had been sealed off,''
Glover said. ``They had no where else to turn to.''
   Glover, of Orlando, Fla., said after word of the accident
spread, the center was flooded with calls from worried relatives in
the United States.
   ``People were calling in hysterics, trying to find out the
whereabouts of sons or daughters stationed here,'' Glover said.
   As volunteers at the center worked frantically to reunite
families and friends, relatives of the severely injured faced grim
emergency ward scenes.
   ``Relatives who arrived after the accident were confronted with
sights that no one can prepare for,'' said Werner Overbeck, head of
surgery at Kaiserslautern City Hospital, where 98 victims were
treated.
   ``Many patients had suffered burns that made them unrecognizable
to their families,'' Overbeck said.
   ``It was pandemonium here'' the day after the crash, said an
emergency room receptionist. ``I saw a woman scream and faint when
they brought her son in on a gurney. His face was gone.''
   One young mother, after visiting her daughter at the burn unit
in a hospital near Mannheim said: ``It is difficult for parents to
say, but it would be better if our daughter does not survive.''
   The woman told the Frankfurt Abendpost newspaper that the child
had suffered burns over 70 percent of her body, including her face.
It was not known if the girl survived.
   Two Americans were among the dead. Most of the dead and hundreds
who were injured at the air show were West Germans.
   Alfred Witt of Trier found out Friday his 16-year-old son Mario
was dead after discovering the boy's housekey among long rows of
items found on the bodies of victims who had been so mutilated they
could not be identified, the Bild newspaper reported.
   ``They wouldn't let us see the dead,'' the father said.
   Days after the accident, some families were still waiting for
word about missing relatives.
   ``Every time the phone rings our emotions sweep from hope to
despair,'' the Abendpost quoted Gerd Wagner of Nuremberg as saying.
   Twelve-year-old Andreas Wagner had left the rest of the family
to get a closer look at the aerobatic display, his father said.
   ``I thought to myself, `Nothing can happen to him,''' Wagner
said.
   In the turmoil after the accident, many injured family members
were sent to different hospitals.
   ``We are treating the parents of a seriously injured girl here
in Kaiserslautern,'' Overbeck said. ``The little girl is fighting
for her life in a hospital near Ludwigshafen.''
   Overbeck and other specialists said many of the most severely
burned probably will die of complications over the weeks to come.
   While grief for lost loved ones is enormous, Overbeck said
relatives of the maimed and the victims themselves will face unique
psychological burdens long after they leave the hospital.
   ``These people must now deal with the pain of disfigurement and
loss of function for months and years to come,'' Overbeck said.
   Jeffrey Nelson, a psychiatrist stationed at Ramstein, said
attendance at a special grief clinic on base soared after the
accident.
   ``What we are seeing is a classic disaster response,'' Nelson
said. ``At first, people were too stunned to talk. Now they are
moving through other stages of guilt, anger, depression and
anxiety.''
   ``Anyone who has gone through such an experience has their sense
of life's predictability and security taken away,'' Nelson said.
   He said the sessions are open to Americans and West Germans and
are being expanded to include all personnel at the base.
   ``We need to move quickly to get them to talk about it before
they close up and withdraw,'' Nelson said.
   At Ramstein's busy west entrance, the only sign of the tragedy
is a flickering red candle and bouquet of flowers placed along the
roadside by an unknown mourner.

<HEAD>Bush, Dukakis Wind Up Pre-Labor Day Campaigns</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD L. VERNACI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   The presidential candidates wound up their pre-Labor Day
campaigns Saturday with Democrat Michael Dukakis paying a
sentimental visit to Ellis Island and Republican George Bush
pointedly praising his opponent's debating skills.
   ``He's probably a better debater,'' Bush said of the
Massachusetts governor, adding quickly: ``I'm lowering
expectations.''
   In an outdoor news conference followed by a picnic for reporters
at his vice presidential residence on the grounds of the U.S. Naval
Observatory in Washington, Bush refrained from the fiery attacks
that dominated his campaign speeches last week.
   However, Dukakis started his day by attacking Bush's
insensitivity to the plight of the unemployed.
   Bush on Friday called an increase in the jobless rate from 5.4
percent in July to 5.6 percent in August ``statistically almost
irrelevant.''
   Dukakis seized on that Saturday, telling supporters outside his
hotel in Sioux Falls, S.D., that the increase meant ``another
200,000 people without jobs.''
   He continued his criticism of Bush's remark later, adding it to
a speech at Ellis Island in New York.
   ``We must never forget _ although some already have _ that no
one in America is irrelevant,'' Dukakis said. ``In America everyone
matters; we stand by our neighbors.''
   Dukakis' trip to Ellis Island was a sentimental and symbolic
journey on which he was accompanied by his 85-year-old mother,
Euterpe. An immigrant from Greece, she landed there 76 years ago on
her arrival in the United States.
   ``America's story is the immigrants' story,'' Dukakis said.
``Newcomers arriving, some on slave ships to our lasting shame;
some on converted coal ships like my mother, immigrants from every
corner of Earth, drawn by the torch of freedom.''
   Dukakis also was accompanied by New York Gov. Mario Cuomo,
himself the son Italian immigrants, who hailed the Democratic
nominee for standing ``on the edge of realizing the immigrant
fantasy: He is about to become the president of the United States
of America.''
   Cuomo was among some dozen political leaders who were expected
to be named this week as co-chairmen of the Dukakis campaign.
Others included Sen. John Glenn of Ohio, Sen. Sam Nunn of Georgia
and Gov. Madelyn Kunin of Vermont, according to a campaign source
who demanded anonymity.
   Politically, the trip to the island was a reminder of Dukakis'
ethnic roots as the Democrats try to win back the ethnic voters who
cast Republican ballots for Ronald Reagan in 1980 and 1984.
   Bush, meanwhile, said a two-day break in campaigning this
weekend is ``a good time to take stock of where things stand.''
   He said he was not concerned about questions arising over Stuart
Spencer, campaign manager for vice presidential running mate Dan
Quayle. Spencer's lobbying firm was paid more than $350,000 in l985
and 1986 to assist the Panamanian government headed by Gen. Manuel
Antonio Noriega.
   Quayle, campaigning in Atlanta, also defended Spencer.
   ``I believe that his political experience and political guidance
has been and will be valuable to me,'' Quayle said.
   On the presidential debates, Bush said he had no intention of
changing his stand on the number of face-to-face encounters between
the candidates. Bush has agreed to two televised debates, while
Dukakis wants three.
   ``We've made a strong proposal that calls for two debates at
this level and one at the vice presidential level and we're going
to stay with it,'' Bush said. ``I think it's the right amount of
this kind of campaign activity.''
   ``He's favored in the debates, there's no doubt about it,'' Bush
said of Dukakis. ``My wife Barbara, when I practice debating, she
falls asleep. And I've got to do something different about that.''
   In debates, as elsewhere in politics, a candidate's performance
is measured by how well he was expected to do. Bush clearly was
trying to lower the expectations for his performance while raising
the stakes for Dukakis.

   Michael Dukakis, in a visit with
strong personal and political overtones, was touring Ellis Island
Saturday with his immigrant mother Euterpe, and he declared ``we
are one nation, one people, one community.''
   One day short of her 85th birthday, Mrs. Dukakis was living the
ultimate American dream, visiting the island where she landed more
than 75 years ago as a 9-year-old Greek immigrant, with a son who
was the Democratic candidate for president of her adopted land.
   Panos Dukakis, who would later meet and marry Euterpe, passed
through Ellis Island a year before her.
   ``Their story is your story, it is our story, it is the story of
America,'' Michael Dukakis said to a gathering of first-generation
Americans.
   Among those joining them for the occasion was New York Gov.
Mario Cuomo, the son of Italian immigrants.
   Cuomo introduced Dukakis as someone who ``stands on the edge of
realizing the immigrant fantasy, he is about to become the
president of the United States of America.''
   Cuomo is among as many as a dozen political leaders expected to
be named this week as co-chairmen of the Dukakis campaign. Others
included Sen. John Glenn of Ohio, Sen. Sam Nunn of Georgia and Gov.
Madelyn Kunin of Vermont, according to a campaign source who
demanded anonymity.
   Dukakis' visit to the island had more than personal
significance. It also was designed to strengthen his identification
with ethnic voters in the presidential election.
   Many voters who retained strong identification with their ethnic
roots traditionally supported Democratic presidential candidates in
the past. But large numbers shifted their allegiance to Ronald
Reagan in the 1980 and 1984 elections.
   Now Dukakis is trying to win them back to the Democrats.
   ``America's story is the immigrants' story,'' he said.
``Newcomers arriving, some on slave ships to our lasting shame;
some on converted coal ships like my mother, immigrants from every
corner of earth drawn by the torch of freedom.''
   The Massachusetts governor said, ``We must never forget that we
_ like those who built our nation _ must have our minds on the
future.''
   He said the choice between him and Republican George Bush in the
presidential election was ``between accepting the world as it is
and accepting our responsibility to make it better.''
   ``We must never forget _ though some would have us do so _ that
the dream belongs not just to the privileged few, but to all of
us,'' he said.
   ``We must never forget _ though some would have us do so _ that
today the rich are getting richer; the poor are getting poorer; and
those in the middle must work twice as hard just to stay in place.
   ``We must never forget _ though some would have us do so _ that
we have a responsibility not to be satisfied; not to be complacent;
not to be weary; not to rest until all our citizens are full
shareholders in our shared dream.''
   Dukakis said that when he looks at the American flag, ``I see a
quarter of a billion faces of all ages, all colors, all shapes and
all sizes; I see a nation dedicated to a belief in individual
rights, strengthened by a commitment to family values; united by an
understanding that for all our diversity, we are one nation, one
people, one community.''
   Dukakis spoke from a podium facing the large brick building his
mother passed through when she arrived in America.
   When he finished speaking Dukakis turned around and walked to
his mother who was seated behind him and kissed her.
   The Ellis Island stop was the end of a three-day pre-Labor Day
campaign trip to California, Oregon, Washington and South Dakota.
   At an early morning rally in Sioux Falls, S.D., Dukakis chided
Bush for calling an increase in the unemployment rate
``irrelevant.''
   The Labor Dempartment announced on Friday that the jobless rate
for August was 5.6 percent, up from 5.4 percent in July.
   Bush called the increase ``statistically almost irrelevant.''
   ``Another 200,000 people without jobs,'' said Dukakis. ``The
vice president said it was irrelevant. Those are people. Those are
our fellow citizens. It's not irrelevant.''
   Dukakis inserted into his Ellis Island speech another reference
to the unemployment figures, saying, ``We must never forget _
although some already have _ that no one in America is irrelevant.
In America everyone matters; we stand by our neighbors. ...
   ``It's so troubling to have a high ranking official of our
government say that these folks are statistically irrelevant.''

<HEAD>Palestinians Clash; Shiite Leader Blames US For Election Impasse</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rival Palestinian factions with mortars
and rocket-propelled grenades clashed in a south Beirut refugee
camp Saturday, killing three people and wounding nine, police said.
   In another development, the most senior Shiite Moslem cleric in
Lebanon blamed the United States and Israel for Parliament's
failure to elect a new president and said it will ``explode in
their face.''
   Guerrillas of George Habash's Marxist Popular Front for the
Liberation of Palestine fought Syrian-backed fighters of Col. Saeed
Mousa's Fatah-Uprising for five hours.
   A police spokesman said the clash at the Bourj el-Barajneh
refugee camp stopped after neutral guerrilla groups called a
cease-fire.
   ``Police patrols couldn't enter the camp to launch an
investigation,'' said the spokesman, who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
   He said the casualties were evacuated to hospitals in west
Beirut.
   The Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine operates under
the umbrella of Yasser Arafat's Palestine Liberation Organization.
   Mousa broke away from the PLO in 1983 and established
headquarters in Damascus, the Syrian capital.
   Guerrillas of Arafat's mainline Fatah group evacuated Bourj
el-Barajneh, their last foothold in Beirut, on July 8 after the
camp fell to Mousa's followers.
   The Shiite leader, Sheik Mohammed Mehdi Shamseddin, said said an
``American-Israeli plot'' was behind Parliament's failure on Aug.
18 to muster a quorum of 51 members to elect a new president.
   ``If the Americans want to continue with their dangerous game,
then a force stronger than what they have known will explode in
their face,'' he said.
   The only serious candidate was Syrian-backed warlord Suleiman
Franjieh, 78. According to Lebanon's Constitution, a new head of
state should be elected before Sept. 23, when the six-year term of
President Amin Gemayel expires.
   Parliament Speaker Hussein Husseini, a Shiite, adjourned the
abortive election session without setting a date for a new meeting
to elect a president.
   Syrian-backed leftist and Moslem factions have accused the
United States and the right-wing Christian Lebanese Forces militia,
which is sympathatic to Israel, of blocking Franjieh's election.
   Franjieh's backers have also accused the Lebanese Forces of
forcefully preventing deputies from attending the parliamentary
session to block the election of Franjieh, a personal friend of
Syrian President Hafez Assad.
   The Christian militia has denied the charge and said the
boycotters opposed Franjieh's election. But a Lebanese Forces
spokesman, speaking privately, said Parliament will have ``no
quorum as long as Franjieh remains a candidate.''
   U.S. State Department spokeswoman Phyllis Oakley has blamed
Parliament's failure to elect a new president on the lack of a
``consensus candidate.''
   Shamseddin, addressing a news conference at his residence in
Moslem west Beirut, said the United States ``wants to end Syria's
regional (Middle Eastern) role to give Israel a free hand in
Lebanon.''
   ``We are determined not to succumb to the American stand,'' said
Shamseddin, who heads the Supreme Shiite Islamic Council in Lebanon.
   Syria, the main power broker in Lebanon, maintains 40,000 troops
in eastern and northern provinces and in west and south Beirut.

Police said seven people were killed and 11 injured.
   A police official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said

<HEAD>`Casual' Firefighters Become Essential In Scorched West</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID FOSTER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>YELLOWSTONE NATIONAL PARK, Wyo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Staff Sgt. Steven Rifkin
was looking forward to a little R&R after a blistering, 60-mile
march at the Army's Fort Lewis near Seattle.
   But his feet are hot again. For a week he has tramped through
Yellowstone's scorched forests, learning a brand of warfare that 12
years in the Army did not prepare him for. Learning, for example,
to watch your feet.
   ``In some burns, you'll be standing there and your feet start
cooking,'' Rifkin said Friday as he stood guard by a park road,
watching for flying embers.
   Rifkin is one of 2,400 Fort Lewis soldiers who have joined the
fight against what officials say is the West's worst summer of
forest fires in at least 23 years.
   Fires raging out of control in nine states have stretched
regular firefighting crews so thin that officials are depending on
unprecedented numbers of novice firefighters from the military and
from civilian unemployment lines.
   Most of these so-called ``casual'' firefighters, like Rifkin,
have never fought a fire before, and they're being sent into the
woods with as little as five hours of training. But fire officials
say the newcomers have become an indispensable part of firefighting
teams this summer.
   Nearly 3.6 million acres have burned this summer in Western
states and Alaska, said Mike Ferris, a spokesman at the federal
Boise Interagency Fire Center in Idaho.
   That's the most since the center was created in 1965, and it's
nearly three times the area burned last year at this time, he said.
Some fires are expected to continue burning well into October.
   About 25,500 firefighters and support personnel are battling the
far-flung fires, Ferris said.
   Normally, crews are shuttled from one state to another as blazes
flare up. But local firefighting officials in many states are
keeping crews close to home this summer, worried that more fires
will break out in the persistent drought.
   As a result, officials have had to scramble for extra manpower
in areas such as Yellowstone, where six major blazes have charred
more than a half-million acres of the 2.2 million-acre park.
   The Army started sending soldiers to the fires of Montana and
Wyoming about two weeks ago.
   Last week, the Forest Service started hiring inexperienced
firefighters through local Job Service offices throughout the West.
About 1,340 of those casual firefighters hit the forests this
weekend, Ferris said.
   The employment agencies were swamped with applicants, many of
whom were weeded out because they failed physical exams and aerobic
fitness tests.
   It is the first time that Fort Lewis soldiers have been called
on to fight forest fires, said Lt. Bob Brewer, an Army spokesman in
Yellowstone.
   ``They're doing a lot of good, productive work together,'' said
Sandie Hand, a National Park Service spokeswoman.
   The soldiers received five to 10 hours of training in fire
behavior, use of tools and safety, Brewer said.
   Additional training had to wait for the field. Before being
allowed near active fires, the first wave of Army firefighters
spent a week working ``cold lines,'' hacking fire breaks through
the woods far from flames.
   But in recent days, as the fires spread and the soldiers gain
respect for their abilities, the apprenticeship time has shrunk,
Brewer said. New recruits may spend only two days on the cold
lines, he said.
   The soldiers' safety record has been excellent _ no fire-related
injuries had been reported by Friday in Yellowstone, Brewer said.
   The hefty meals served at the Forest Service fire camps appeal
to soldiers accustomed to more pedestrian Army fare. On Friday,
Pvt. 2nd Class Terry Harp was still savoring the T-bone steak
served up two nights before.
   ``I think this is the best I've eaten since I've been in the
Army,'' he said.

   Paul Tavilla stood at the base of Boston's
60-story John Hancock Tower, head back, mouth open, as grapes
rained down around him at 110 mph.
   Some hit the building. Quite a few splattered on the concrete.
But shortly after noon Saturday, on about his 70th try, the
gray-haired, 54-year-old Tavilla finally caught one in his mouth _
and about 150 spectators burst into applause.
   Chalk up another grape-catching record for Tavilla. At 788 feet,
it easily topped his previous best, recorded by the Guinness Book
of World Records as 660 feet from the top of the Sumitomo Insurance
Building in Tokyo, Japan, on March 1, 1986.
   Catching grapes is no picnic, insists Tavilla, a produce
merchant from Arlington.
   ``It's very, very dangerous if you don't know what you're
doing,'' he warned. ``You could put out an eye.''
   Then there's the neck strain.
   ``It absolutely kills me,'' he confessed.
   So why does he do it?
   ``I was always good at catching things in my mouth when I was a
kid,'' he said. ``It's fun. Plus they taste good.''

   Though he helped raise goats as a boy,
Mayor Bill Harris proved udderly helpless in the goat-milking
contest at the Nebraska State Fair.
   Harris pumped out barely more than a mouthful of the stuff
Friday and placed last in the competition.
   Eight men had two minutes to milk their Nebraska-bred goat. The
winner was Larry Hudkins of rural Malcolm, who squeezed out two
quarts.
   ``It was a tough race. But I had a good goat,'' Hudkins said.
   Harris blamed his last-place performance on his goat, as well.
   ``With a name like Sam, what can you expect?''

<DATELINE>DUNMOYLE, Northern Ireland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Armed soldiers lined narrow
roads in this remote village Saturday as thousands of mourners
followed the funeral cortege of an IRA guerrilla, one of three men
killed in an ambush by British soldiers.
   A Protestant leader bitterly protested the presence at the
funeral of the dead man's brother, another IRA guerrilla who was
released from prison to attend the service.
   Across the province in Londonderry, family and friends gathered
to mourn a man and a woman who went to check on a neighbor but
instead stumbled into an explosive booby trap laid for British
soldiers.
   The Irish Republican Army apologized for the bombing deaths of
Sean Dalton, 55, and Sheila Lewis, 60, but the clergyman who gave
their eulogies had a bitter reply.
   ``We do not want to hear any more apologies from the IRA or from
anyone else,'' Edward Daly, the Catholic bishop of Londonderry,
told the mourners.
   ``We want an end to all this death and destruction, which is
destroying our city and destroying our people and destroying the
chances for the young people coming along for work, for
opportunity,'' Daly said.
   Dalton broke into the neighbor's apartment on Wednesday and
triggered a bomb rigged by the IRA, which had kidnapped the
occupant and planned to blow up any army squad that came to check
on the missing man. The IRA apologized, saying the operation went
``tragically wrong.''
   As the families of the dead mourned in the two towns, a British
military base in Crossmaglen near the South Armagh border came
under mortar attack. Police said two of the three shells that
exploded landed inside the heavily fortified base but that there
were no injuries and little damage.
   In Dunmoyle, police and soldiers stood guard as mourners
followed the cortege of 26-year-old Brian Mullin, one of three IRA
men shot to death Tuesday by the waiting army as the guerrillas
drove along a country road on what the IRA called ``active duty.''
   News reports said Mullin and brothers Gerard Harte, 29, and
Martin Harte, 21, were about to try to kill an off-duty member of
the Protestant Ulster Defense Regiment when soldiers lying in wait
riddled their stolen car with bullets.
   The Harte brothers were buried Friday.
   Among the mourners at Dunmoyle was Mullin's elder brother,
Patrick, released on a day's compassionate leave from Belfast's
Maze prison, where he is serving a life sentence for the 1977 IRA
murder of a school bus driver _ another mistaken killing for which
the IRA apologized.
   Ken Maginnis, a member of the Protestant Official Unionist
Party, expressed outrage over the release.
   ``It is an absolute scandal that this man who is one of a
committed IRA family, should be released, or paroled or whatever it
is called,'' Maginnis said.
   ``The concession for the funeral of a terrorist involved in the
murder of eight young soldiers exactly 14 days ago is a concession
to IRA terrorism quite beyond comprehension.''
   Maginnis is among those who believe Brian Mullin was involved in
the bus bombing that killed eight British soldiers Aug. 20 and
injured 27 others _ the worst incident so far of the IRA's
heated-up campaign to drive the British out of the predominantly
Protestant province and unite it with the Roman Catholic Irish
Republic.
   Patrick Mullin was delayed at a security checkpoint and the
cortege of about 2,000 mourners did not leave the family farm at
Sixmilecross, 50 miles west of Belfast, until about noon, an hour
later than scheduled.
   More than 200 police and soldiers accompanied the hearse
carrying Mullin's coffin, which was draped with the Irish tricolor
flag, along four miles of winding country roads from Sixmilecross
to Dunmoyle for the funeral and burial.

   Authorities held a Florida man in the city
jail on Saturday after he was arrested on charges of threatening to
kill the nine justices of the U.S. Supreme Court.
   George Thomas Haley, 38, was arrested without incident Friday
afternoon in the Washington suburb of Arlington, Va., said Bill
Dempsey, spokesman at the Alexandria, Va., field office of the U.S.
Marshal's Service. He is scheduled to be arraigned on formal
charges Tuesday in U.S. District Court in Washington.
   Haley, whose last address was in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., will be
formally charged with writing threats to assault or kill a U.S.
judge and verbally threatening to kill the nine Supreme Court
justices, Dempsey said.
   Haley originally threatened the justices in May, while still
living in Fort Lauderdale, according to the spokesman.
   Haley later told an unidentified minister and an unidentified
Supreme Court employee of ``similar intentions,'' said Dempsey.
   Haley was arrested by the U.S. Supreme Court police and agents
of the U.S. Marshal's Service and the FBI.

<TEXT>
   Moscow authorities opened a suicide prevention
center and set up a telephone hotline for troubled teen-agers after
a surge in suicides among young people, including a 7-year-old, the
government newspaper said Saturday.
   Izvestia drew a link between a rise in suicides and increased
alcohol and drug abuse.
   ``Among teen-agers, the abuse of alcohol and cigarettes, drug
and toxic substances ... is spreading,'' the newspaper said. It
said specialists regarded the growing abuse as proof of ``conscious
or unconscious striving toward physical and moral
self-destruction.''
   In one case, a 7-year-old killed himself, the newspaper said.
   The Moscow center, which opened Sept. 1, will be staffed by
medical personnel skilled at easing stress and depression, Izvestia
said. It said specialists believe the hotline, or ``telephone of
trust,'' is the most effective means of offering psychological
counseling.
   Moscow has more than 20 psychological aid centers where people
can seek help anonymously. It also has had a ``telephone of trust''
for 15 years.
   But now teen-agers will have a hotline of their own that they
can call if they want counseling.
   Izvestia did not give the number of the teen-agers' hotline or
say how capital residents could get it. It said the teen-age
suicide rate for Moscow was ``closed information.''
   In June, the weekly newspaper Arguments and Facts reported that
the national suicide rate for people of all ages was about 20 per
100,000 members of the population. That would be about 56,000
suicides a year.
   According to a 1985 U.N. report, the suicide rate in the United
States in 1982 was 12.2 per 100,000 residents.
   The more recent candor about the suicide problem in the Soviet
Union is a consequence of Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev's
endorsement of ``glasnost,'' or greater openness, in the discussion
of selected social issues.

   A California supplier of bolts that were
to be used on a piece of equipment aboard the space shuttle was
indicted on charges of mail fraud and making false statements to
NASA.
   Arthur O. Sammons, contacted by telephone at his home in Los
Angeles, said Saturday that he had not been informed of the
43-count indictment, returned by a grand jury Friday.
   ``I don't know anything about it. Let's just say no comment on
that one,'' he said. Sammons declined to discuss his business but
said he was the only person with his name in the Canoga Park
section of Los Angeles.
   The grand jury charged that Sammons, identified as a
manufacturer and distributor of aerospace fasteners, signed false
certifications saying that bolts supplied under a contract to
Teledyne Brown Engineering in Huntsville had been tested as
required by NASA standards.
   In fact the bolts, used on a piece of equipment known as Astro
I, were not properly examined, the charges state. Astro I was to be
installed in the space shuttle, said the indictment.
   Last fall, in a schedule of planned shuttle flights from 1988 to
1990, NASA said Astro I was one of the pieces of scientific
equipment that would be used on a flight during that period. The
schedule described it as an ultraviolet observatory.
   Engineers with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration
estimated the cost of identifying, removing and replacing the
suspect bolts on Astro 1 at $1 million.
   Sammons was indicted on 26 counts of making false statements to
NASA, said U.S. Attorney Frank Donaldson. He also was indicted on
17 counts of mail fraud stemming from bills he sent to Teledyne
Brown for the parts, the prosecutor said.
   If convicted of all charges, Sammons would face up to 215 years
in prison and a $7.83 million fine, said a spokesman for
Donaldson's office. Sammons' arraignment is scheduled for Sept. 15.

<TEXT>
   Pakistan on Saturday rejected an
Afghan proposal for another international conference to discuss the
U.N.-backed agreement calling for the withdrawal of Soviet troops
from Afghanistan.
   Afghanistan suggested another conference of representatives from
Pakistan, Afghanistan, the United States and the Soviet Union to
follow the pact signed April 14 in Geneva, with the United States
and Soviets serving as guarantors.
   A key provision of the Geneva pact was the withdrawal of about
115,000 Soviet military personnel from Aghanistan. The Soviets sent
troops into the neighboring country in December 1979 to help the
Marxist government battle anti-communist rebels.
   Western diplomats in Islamabad said it appeared the Afghan
government wants a followup conference because of increased rebel
attacks on the withdrawing Soviet troops and Afghan security
forces. The Kremlin has said half of the Soviets had been pulled
out by the stipulated date of May 15 and all will be out of
Afghanistan by Feb. 15.
   Pakistan's Foreign Affairs Ministry issued a statement Saturday
rejecting the Afghan proposal for a second conference. It said ``it
should be noted that the Geneva agreements contain provisions with
respect to implementation'' of the accords.
   The statement said the pact and an accompanying memorandum of
understanding provide procedures ``to consider alleged violations
and to work out prompt and mutually satisfactory solutions to
questions that may arise in the implementation of the instruments.''
   Abdul Wakil, the Afghan foreign minister, suggested a new
conference in a letter last week to U.N. Secretary-General Javier
Perez de Cueller.
   Both Afghanistan and Pakistan accuse each other of violating the
April agreement.
   Afghanistan and the Soviet Union claim Pakistan and the United
States continue to provide support to the rebels in volation of the
accord. Pakistan and the United States accuse the Soviet and Afghan
forces of terrorist activities and bombings in Pakistan. Washington
on Friday protested the bombing of Kunduz in northern Afghanistan
by Soviet aircraft.
   A U.N. mission established under the Geneva agreement is
operating in Afghanistan and Pakistan and both countries have filed
complaints with the mission.
   The Pakistani Foreign Ministry statement said that is the proper
procedure for complaining about violations.
   It said Afghanistan's request for another conference on
implementation of the accords ``appears to be no more than a
propaganda measure designed to acquire international recognition
and legitimacy.''
   The statement said that on Sept. 1, soon after Afghanistan
proposed the conference, five Afghan aircraft violated Pakistani
airspace and bombed two villages, ``killing a number of civilians.''

   Reports that a 9-year-old boy was handing
out $100 bills at a suburban shopping mall led police to charge a
woman and four juveniles in the theft of $36,000 in cash from a
neighbor's car.
   The boy, Joseph William Yates, was seen giving out the money to
other children at the Westerville Mall last week and was carrying
$12,726 when he was apprehended, Westerville police said.
   Patricia A. Phillips, 39, of Blendon Township, was charged with
grand theft, said Keith Thatcher, township police chief.
   Joseph,, his 12-year-old brother and two other boys, aged 13 and
14, were charged with delinquency counts of grand theft, police
said. Ms. Phillips is an acquaintance of the boys' families,
Blendon Township police detective Terrance Adair said Saturday.
   The theft victim, George A. Stone III of Blendon Township, said
he had accumulated the cash to lend to his brother, who is buying a
house.
   ``It kind of caught me by surprise, especially after living in
this neighborhood all of my life,'' said Stone, 34.
   Stone said he left the money unguarded Monday in a bank bag
under the seat of his locked car, which was parked next to his
business, Westerville Service Center.
   Some airplane navigational charts and equipment, a pilot's
license and receipts from his business also were taken, he said.
   Stone said police and neighborhood children told him someone had
told the children when to burglarize his car and what to look for.
He thinks the thieves initially took only his flying gear and the
receipts, then returned for the cash.
   About $20,000 has been recovered, including about $7,000
returned to Stone by a youngster who was not charged, police said.

<HEAD>Biologists Thrilled To Find Pregnant Bat</HEAD>

   Biologists were thrilled to find a
species of bat that some feared had slipped into extinction, then
they were ecstatic to learn the tiny Florida mastiff bat was
pregnant.
   ``This means there's not just one, but three _ mom, dad and
baby,'' wildlife biologist Frank Mazzotti said after an X-ray
examination disclosed the pregnancy.
   No Florida mastiff bat, found only in southeastern Florida, had
been identified since 1978.
   The 5{-inch flying mammal bat turned up early last week on the
balcony of a Coral Gables office and was handed over to specialists.
   Bat specialist Mark Robson of the state Game and Fresh Water
Fish Commission was thrilled to see the animal, but alarmed that it
appeared so sick.
   ``It didn't try to fly or bite. We speculated that it ran into
the building the night before and sort of got stunned, and when it
lay there all day it got worse,'' Robson said.
   Its blood sugar and body temperature were dangerously low and
the bat was pronounced in critical condition.
   Robson rushed the bat to the Pembroke Pine Animal Clinic, where
it was treated for dehydration.
   By Friday, it weighed a robust one and one-third ounces and
experts planned to let it fly away at dusk. That plan changed when
they discovered the advanced pregnancy.
   The rare bat was given a place in a maternity basket at the
clinic while wildlife experts search for more of her kind.

   A man accused of giving an undercover cop
money and a gun to shoot and cripple a former girlfriend has been
charged with conspiracy to commit first-degree assault.
   John Joseph Kotowski of Roseville, reported to be in his late
20s, was arraigned Friday before Ramsey County District Judge
Margaret Marrinan. He was ordered held Friday on bail of $100,000.
   Kotowski was arrested Thursday in a St. Paul parking lot after
allegedly giving a .32-caliber handgun, 41 rounds of ammunition,
$670, photographs of the woman and addresses she frequented to a
man he thought was a professional ``hit man,'' according to a
complaint filed by authorities.
   The man, D.G. Owens, actually was an agent of the Minnesota
Bureau of Criminal Apprehension.
   The complaint says Kotowski told the agent he wanted the
29-year-old woman put in a wheelchair for life because she was
``vain'' and had stolen an ounce of cocaine from him.
   The agent was asked ``to severely injure the unidentified female
by shooting her in the back and hopefully paralyzing her for
life,'' the complaint says.
   Kotowski also allegedly told the agent that he would have done
the shooting himself if he could have found a gun with a silencer.
   Kotowski and Owens had a series of meetings and phone calls over
3{ months before the arrest, according to the complaint. Owens
warned Kotowski that it would be difficult merely to wound the
woman and that she might be killed.
   ``Kotowski indicated that he understood and told Owens to go for
broke,'' the complaint says.

<TEXT>
   Mourners at a memorial service for
the victims of the Ramstein air show disaster wept Saturday as the
U.S. ambassador promised that the tragedy would not be repeated.
   The death toll from the Aug. 28 accident reached 51 when a young
West German died in a hospital in Ludwigsburg, officials said.
   The service took place 1{ miles from the Ramstein U.S. Air Force
Base, where an Italian air force stunt team jet collided with two
other jets and crashed into a crowd of spectators. More than 160
people remain hospitalized, many of them in serious condition with
severe burns.
   Relatives of the victims wept uncontrollably throughout the
two-hour service, which included the funeral march from Beethoven's
Third Symphony. West German President Richard von Weizsaecker led
the memorial service, televised live nationwide.
   Two elderly women who appeared nearly unable to walk because of
their grief were helped to their seats in a section reserved for
members of victims' families.
   As about 500 West German and American mourners entered the red
brick Church of St. Nicholas, a light rain fell on about 15
protesters from a local women's peace group. The skies, usually
filled with the roar and whine of warplanes heading to the
sprawling air base, were quiet and empty.
   ``I promise you that we will learn from events, and we will
ensure that such a tragedy is never repeated,'' the U.S. ambassador
to West Germany, Richard Burt, told mourners in this southwestern
German town.
   Since the accident, many West Germans have criticized the United
States for allowing dangerous stunt-flying at its annual Ramstein
military air show. West Germany and its NATO allies have since
suspended military air shows in West Germany.
   Burt recalled several examples of bravery and willingness to
help that followed the world's worst air show disaster.
   ``Dozens of off-duty German and American medical personnel
rushed to volunteer their services,'' he said. ``Sixty French
soldiers traveled here together to donate blood. Two medics,
themselves bleeding victims of the crash, their clothes burned off
their backs, worked together to rescue others even more severely
injured.''
   Eyewitnesses earlier spoke of a U.S. helicopter crew that
touched down virtually in the middle of the inferno.
   Bernhard Vogel, governor of the West German state where Ramstein
is located, told the mourners: ``Ramstein must not become
synonymous with catastrophe.''
   The Rev. Helmut Pflanz, the local Roman Catholic priest, opened
the service and said: ``Pain and sorrow are tearing at the hearts
of so many people. We are praying for the dead and injured of the
tragedy, especially for the children.'' The church, on the main
street of this town of 7,000 people, is named after the patron
saint of children.
   Two of the dead were Americans _ a U.S. Army private and her
9-year-old son.
   Rhineland-Palatinate state government spokesman Juergen Dietzen
said about 20 of the hospitalized are suffering from
life-threatening burns.
   Pope John Paul II sent a telegram expressing ``deep sympathy for
the relatives of the victims,'' Bishop Anton Schlembach of nearby
Speyer announced.
   Among those gathered outside the church to follow the service by
louspeaker was Ramstein Sgt. Paulo DaSilva of Pawtucket, R.I.
   ``Some people on the base don't want to talk about it because of
the horror they saw,'' the 27-year-old airman said.
   ``People who came very close to the crash site are having
trouble expressing their shock,'' DaSilva said. ``It was hell.
Period.''
   About 15 protesters from a local peace group held up small
banners calling for a ``return to life'' and a banning of ``weapons
of mass destruction.''
   ``We kept warning of the dangers of the air show,'' said group
leader Pastor Angelika Keller. ``We kept asking for a cancellation
of the show. But our warnings were not heeded.''

<HEAD>Half Of Jurors Say They Were Wrong In Awarding Money In Tobacco
Suit</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Half the jurors in the first tobacco
liability suit to result in a judgment against a cigarette company
for a lung cancer death say they were wrong in awarding money,
according to a report Saturday.
   They hope an appeals court overturns their verdict, according to
early Sunday editions of The Philadelphia Inquirer.
   Three of the six federal jurors said in separate interviews over
the last two weeks that they shouldn't have ordered the Liggett
Group Inc. to award $400,000 to Antonio Cipollone, whose wife,
Rose, died of lung cancer after smoking for more than 40 years.
   The trial judge, H. Lee Sarokin, affirmed the verdict two weeks
ago.
   The jurors said they believed Rose Cipollone was responsible for
her own actions, that the tobacco commpanies never forced her to
light up and that they never should have been held liable.
   But they said they compromised after two of the jurors who
insisted on finding the tobacco companies liable wore down the
others through five days of intense deliberation and heated
arguments in a cramped jury room in Newark, N.J.
   ``As I look back on it today, I don't think I did the right
thing,'' said Marie Mickens, who was the jury forewoman. ``I hope
they (Liggett) win on appeal. I really do.''
   Ms. Mickens and the others who were interviewed by the newspaper
said they wish they had simply told the judge they could not reach
a conclusion _ that they were a hung jury _ and that the case
should be retried.
   When their verdict was read in court on June 13, juror Barbara
Reilly wept.
   ``I was crying because I gave in,'' she said. She said she
believed the decision was wrong and that she should have stood her
ground in the jury room.
   Another juror, Ralph Eliseo said he also thought he should not
have compromised and that the verdict should be overturned.
   ``There are nights I lay awake wondering, `Did I do something
wrong that's going to affect mankind for years?''' said Eliseo, the
lone smoker on the jury.
   The other three jurors declined to discuss the case, the
Inquirer reported.
   Cipollone's attorneys had argued that Liggett, which makes
Chesterfields, the brand Mrs. Cipollone smoked most of her life,
made false health claims in its 1950s advertising. That advertising
was essentially a false warranty that smoking was safe, the lawyers
claimed.
   But the heart of their case, the lawyers said, was their claim
that Liggett conspired with Philip Morris Inc. and Lorillard Inc.,
which made other brands of cigarettes Mrs. Cipollone smoked, to
keep secret what the companies knew about the health hazards of
smoking.
   The plaintiffs' attorneys introduced hundreds of secret industry
documents from the 1950s. It was the first time those documents had
been used in a tobaccco liability trial, and Cipollone's attorneys
argued they illustrated a decision by cigarette makers to hide what
they knew about the dangers of smoking.
   The jury, Ms. Mickens said, wasn't impressed by the documents.
   ``It's just how you interpret it,'' she said. ``We didn't see
how they were so damaging.''
   Attorneys for both Cipollone and Liggett said Friday they were
not surprised that the jurors had compromised, but that their
statements would have little or no part in the appeal that the
cigarette company plans to file later this month.
   ``What the jurors, with their comments, seem to indicate is that
they accept the proposition that a person who smokes in the '40s,
'50s or '60s understands what they're doing and voluntarily chooses
to smoke,'' said James Kearney, an attorney for Liggett.

   Pupils given A's and B's for their
self-esteem and then told they had flunked third grade will be
allowed to attend fourth grade this fall after all, school
officials say.
   The fight started after a teacher at Alum Creek Elementary
School, who has since quit, flunked 13 of 18 third-graders at the
end of the school year. Some of the children had received A's and
B's and even had made the honor roll.
   Angry parents demanded to know how their children could
seemingly do so well and still flunk.
   Jo Ann Litton, a Kanawha County elementary schools director,
said the school had given the youngsters good grades and honors to
avoid giving them ``a poor self-concept.''
   The county agreed to put the children in the fourth grade if
they passed comprehensive tests. All eight of the students taking
the tests last week did well enough to be promoted, said Alum Creek
acting principal Eulah Mae Fleming.
   Litton said she decided that the rest of the students should be
promoted also, though only on a nine-week, probationary status.
   ``They were sent into the fourth grade with a very competent
teacher, and we think she'll do a lot for them,'' Ms. Fleming said.

   China will accept foreign aid for three provinces
hit hard by natural disasters that have taken 500 lives and caused
nearly $2 billion in damages, the official Xinhua news agency said
Saturday.
   Severe weather in Zhejiang, Heilongjiang and Hubei provinces
also affected the lives of more than 25 million people, according
to a report from the Ministry of Civil Affairs, the agency said.
   In an indirect appeal for aid, Xinhua said, ``The Chinese
authorities have taken various measures to help the disaster areas.
... Help from foreign countries and international organizations
will be accepted.''
   It said the three provinces lack money and supplies including
edible oil, grain, cloth, cement, fertilizer, medicine and material
for rebuilding houses and factories.
   The report did not give any amount of money or supplies needed.
   Xinhua said the coastal Zhejiang province was struck by floods,
droughts and typhoons while grain output in Hubei province will be
reduced by 3 million tons because of a drought that has affected
much of central China.
   Floods in northeastern Heilongjiang province have inundated
nearly half of the crop land, the agency said.
   Xinhua reported earlier that flooding in coastal and
northeastern provinces had claimed a total of 1,406 lives by
mid-August.

<TEXT>
   Walking where their ancestors toiled and
played, nearly 2,000 descendants of slaves sought their roots and
celebrated black history Saturday on the grounds of a restored
antebellum plantation.
   From as far away as New York and Seattle, they converged on
Somerset Place _ once a thriving rice and lumber plantation on the
banks of Lake Phelps, about 50 miles from the Atlantic Coast in
northern North Carolina. It was the second homecoming for people
descended from the labor force of Josiah Collins III's estate.
   The two-story, 14-room Collins mansion and several outbuildings
have been restored and are a state historic site. The slave
quarters gradually disappeared as the plantation fell into
disrepair after the Civil War.
   ``I'd heard about this, but to actually be here _ it's just
mind-blowing,'' said Judy Smith, 33, the great-great-granddaughter
of slaves Joe and Ellen Collins.
   Ms. Smith, of nearby Plymouth, said she was glad her mother
persuaded her to attend. ``I've met family I never knew I had. It's
a great feeling to know I belong,'' she said.
   The reunion was the idea of Dorothy Spruill Redford, a Creswell
resident whose decade-long quest for her roots led to records that
told the story of the Collins plantation and the slaves who built
it.
   At her invitation, 2,000 descendants of the original 21 slave
families attended the emotional first reunion two years ago.
   Mrs. Redford is now employed by the state to do research and
coordinate black history projects at the plantation site. A book
she wrote about her search for her family history goes on sale this
month.
   Attendees at Saturday's reunion watched a performance about
abolitionist Harriet Tubman and a dance ensemble perform the ``John
Kooner'' dance, which is said to have originated at Somerset.
   ``We don't agonize over slavery,'' said Clarence Blount, 67,
majority leader of the Maryland state Senate. ``We who are
descendants of these slaves are not here to mourn. What we are to
do is rise from the ashes of slavery ... to celebrate, walk
proudly.''
   Blount's great-grandfather was a slave at Somerset.
   Other entertainment included the colorful re-enactment of a
slave wedding and ragtime and jazz music. Between performances,
people toured the restored buildings, ate Southern foods ranging
from pork barbecue to jambalaya, studied genealogical records and
examined slavery-era crafts.
   ``This is exciting,'' said Alonzo Mitchell, of Bainbridge, Ga.,
who decided to make the trip after seeing television news accounts
of the 1986 homecoming and was struck by Mrs. Redford's resemblance
to his sister.
   ``I'd never known anything about my family history before
that,'' he said.

   A 16-year-old boy who friends called
``Little Rambo'' told police he ``just wanted to get away from
everything and kill somebody'' when he drove to a neighboring state
and shot to death a woman he didn't know, authorities said.
   Chris Swatzell, described by friends as a well-behaved boy with
an interest in military lore, was in custody Saturday in a
Nashville, Tenn., mental health center for tests to see if he is
competent to stand trial.
   He faces capital murder charges in the killing of Carolyn
Kilpatrick, 41, who was found dead Monday in a shop behind her home
near Linden, Tenn.
   Police said the boy, who had never been in trouble with the law,
turned himself in and confessed to killing Mrs. Kilpatrick, 41. She
was shot four times with a high-powered rifle.
   ``To look at him, you would just picture him as an all-around,
all-American boy,'' said Betty Kelso, manager of a Hardee's
restaurant where Swatzell worked as a cook.
   ``He wasn't a 16-year-old who was out to conquer the world.
Something must have happened.''
   Perry County, Tenn., Sheriff Thomas Ward said the killing
occurred about 2 p.m. Monday, about five hours after Swatzell left
unexcused from Caldwell County High School in Princeton.
   Ward said the teen-ager went home, got two of his stepfather's
high-powered, military-type rifles and drove southward into
Tennessee.
   Recounting Swatzell's confession, Ward said the boy passed Mrs.
Kilpatrick's home, six miles west of Linden, Tenn., which is about
120 miles from Princeton.
   Mrs. Kilpatrick was working in a furniture refinishing shop
behind her house, Ward said. Swatzell drove into the driveway,
walked to the doorway of the shop and shot her four times with a
semi-automatic AR-15 similar to a deer rifle.
   ``He said he just wanted to get away from everything and kill
somebody,'' Ward said. ``He said he had been wanting to do it for
about three months.''
   Swatzell hitched a ride to Parsons, Tenn., where he turned
himself in, about the time Mrs. Kilpatrick's husband found his
wife's body.
   Police found the AR-15 rifle and a second, similar rifle in the
boy's abandoned car, and found a bayonet and gun-cleaning kit in
his military-style knapsack.
   Ward said Swatzell's stepfather, David Braden, a Kentucky prison
officer, collected military-type guns, and Swatzell often went to a
firing range near Princeton.
   The sheriff said the boy's friends nicknamed him ``Little
Rambo'' and ``G.I. Joe'' because of his interest in military gear,
but the boy's behavior did not suggest he was a fanatic about such
things.
   His mother ``told us he liked Rambo, but he wasn't obsessed with
that sort of thing,'' Ward said. ``He seems to be a very average
boy, never in any trouble. It's strange.''
   Brenda Stephens, Caldwell County High School's guidance
counselor, said Swatzell used to often wear fatigues _ but so did
many other students his age.
   ``Lately, he wasn't projecting that image,'' she said. ``He wore
blue jeans and T-shirts.''
   Ms. Stephens said she didn't meet often with Swatzell because
his grades were average to good and he had no disciplinary problems.
   ``He wasn't a joiner,'' she said. ``He had a very close circle
of friends and just minded his own business.''

   Passengers on a tour bus were showered
with broken glass when the bus slipped off a muddy highway and
plunged 200 feet down an embankment in a remote area, a passenger
said.
   One passenger was killed and 29 remained hospitalized Saturday
in Fairbanks, about 110 miles west of the crash site near the
Canadian border.
   The bus traveling down a muddy stretch of the Taylor Highway, 23
miles south of Eagle, went off the road Friday afternoon after
meeting a fuel truck on the windy, unpaved roadway, Alaska State
Troopers said.
   Gray Line of Alaska said Saturday that 43 people were aboard the
bus. The company initially said the coach was carrying 41
passengers and a driver.
   ``It was a narrow stretch of road and we met a tanker truck,''
said Weldon Smith, a passenger from Waco, Texas.
   Passengers were lying or sitting in broken glass when the bus
came to a stop, said Frank Hochstein, 69, of New London, Conn. He
estimated rescuers reached the remote site about one hour after the
crash.
   Killed in the accident was Walter Meyerhoff, 57, of Vancouver,
British Columbia. Meyerhoff was traveling with his wife, Penny, who
was hospitalized in stable condition.
   Elizabeth Lambert of Ozark, Ala., said she saw the fuel truck
coming, felt a crunch as the bus left the road and ``the next thing
I knew I was thrown out of the bus, I guess through the front
window.'' She suffered facial cuts.
   Of the 29 people admitted to Fairbanks Memorial Hospital, one
was in critical condition and nine were in serious condition,
nursing supervisor Susan McLane said Saturday.
   The driver of the bus, David Kasser, 24, of Anchorage, suffered
superficial injuries and remained in Eagle, 23 miles from the crash
site, to meet with investigators, said Dave Bean, a spokesman for
Gray Line.
   The passengers were on the ninth day of a 15-day ``Klondike
Explorer'' tour, which included travel by boat, train and plane,
Bean said.

<TEXT>
   Solidarity leader Lech Walesa risked his
reputation with supporters by halting a series of strikes in
exchange for a vague government promise to discuss legalizing his
banned union movement and allowing union pluralism.
   But the stakes in the upcoming talks also are high for the
government. After strikes this spring and summer, Poland appears
doomed to recurring episodes of costly labor unrest unless the
government can find a way to build social confidence, or at least
patience, for austerity measures to fix the ailing economy.
   Church mediator Jacek Ambroziak said Saturday the ``roundtable''
talks on broad social and political issues could begin very soon.
After a preliminary meeting with authorities Wednesday, Walesa won
a promise that Solidarity would be on the agenda.
   But many pro-Solidarity workers, distrustful of government
promises, feared Walesa agreed too easily to end the strikes
without a firm agreement from authorities to legalize Solidarity or
at least some form of independent unions.
   Solidarity, the only independent union federation in the Soviet
bloc, was crushed with martial law in 1981 and banned the following
year.
   Walesa was unsmiling when asked about opposition among workers
to ending the strikes. The question was put shortly after a tense
late-night meeting Wednesday with strikers in Gdansk.
   ``I have always trusted my instincts,'' he said emphatically.
``And my instincts tell me I am right.''
   Walesa spent the next two days going to shipyards and ports in
Gdansk and to a coal mine in Silesia to persuade strikers to return
to work, and he delivered the same message by phone to the Szczecin
port and the Stalowa Wola steel mill.
   In the end, he bent all the strikers to his will, but workers
who considered the strikes the best way to pressure the government
appeared likely to hold Walesa responsible if the talks failed to
produce concrete results.
   Although the government could easily undercut Walesa by
torpedoing the talks, the Solidarity leader may be calculating that
the government has just as much to lose as him if they fail.
   As a political scientist who advises Polish leader Gen. Wojciech
Jaruzelski suggested in a prominently published interview Friday,
the meeting could be key for marshaling support for hard economic
choices.
   It is easy to stir strikes, said Antoni Rajkiewicz, but ``very
difficult to persuade people to do things ... demanding patience,
endurance and thrift.''
   He said the government needs through the talks not only to reach
a working consensus with the Roman Catholic church and Solidarity
activists, but also to stimulate the imagination and mobilize the
mass of people now caught up in ``tides of hopelessness.''
   The extent of the hopelessness was revealed in a poll of high
school students. The poll, released Friday, said 64 percent
believed they lacked chances to realize their life goals in Poland
   Meanwhile, there were growing signs in the press of a possible
government shakeup to try to increase public support for the
economic reform program, which so far has led to strikes and
inflation expected to top 60 percent this year.
   ``The lack of confidence in the government is a political
fact,'' the influential communist party weekly Polityka commented
this week.
   Changes in the government ``will not deliver more money to our
pockets or more goods to our shops,'' it said. ``However, they will
give radical reform a boost.''

   Iraq's foreign minister said Saturday that the
10-day-old Persian Gulf peace talks were stalled at their starting
point, and he blamed Iran for the delay.
   Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz spoke to reporters at the U.N.
building in Geneva after a nearly two-hour meeting with U.N.
mediator Jan Eliasson.
   ``We are still at square one,'' Aziz said. ``We have not gone
beyond that square because the other side, the Iranian side, has
not yet shown any substantive sign that ... they realize their
commitments vis-a-vis the cease-fire.''
   He said those commitments had to do with freedom of navigation
and with the Shatt-al-Arab waterway, Iraq's main outlet to the sea.
Iran has insisted it has the right to stop vessels in the gulf and
share control of the waterway.
   The dispute over the waterway is one of the key issues in the
talks.
   Aziz also accused Iran of using ``their traditional art of
procrastination'' in the talks. ``Maybe they were betting that
procrastination would make people fed up and then give up. We
don't.''
   He said Iraqi delegates would stay at the talks as long as
necessary.
   Iran made no immediate response to his comments.
   Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati later held a nearly
three-hour meeting with Eliasson that lasted until after midnight.
As Velayati left, he told reporters the talks were constructive.
   Iran's foreign minister said ``we do hope that we can continue
our talks during the next day or the day after tomorrow'' and added
that ``we should see how things are going'' after the weekend. He
declined further comment.
   Earlier Saturday, Eliasson told reporters he was working hard to
find a format to advance the talks. However, an Iranian delegate
speaking on condition of anonymity said the problem was substance,
not form.
   The talks are aimed at agreeing on follow-up measures to the
U.N.-sponsored cease-fire that took effect Aug. 20. The Iran-Iraq
conflict, which began in September 1980, has claimed about 1
million lives.
   Eliasson said, ``We are working hard and we hope that we will be
advancing.'' But he reported little movement.
   He spoke shortly before meeting with Aziz and other members of
the Iraqi delegation.
   Eliasson, named special representative Thursday by U.N.
Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar, met separately with both
ministers Friday. Perez de Cuellar left Geneva on Thursday, after
mediating the first week of the talks.
   Perez de Cuellar said before he left Geneva that the main
problem in the talks was that the two sides did not trust each
other.
   On Friday, the Iranian mission in Geneva released a list of 47
alleged Iraqi violations of the cease-fire. On Saturday, the Iraqi
mission distributed a copy of an Iraqi News Agency report that also
accused Iran of committing 47 cease-fire violations.
   Iran has called for the immediate withdrawal of troops behind
their respective borders. It also calls for quick implementation of
the provisions of the U.N. Security Council's cease-fire
resolution, particularly establishment of an independent inquiry to
establish which side started the war.

<HEAD>Officials Say Ship Can Unload Toxic Cargo In Britain</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A wayward freighter carrying toxic wastes can
unload its unwanted cargo in Britain if it is properly contained
and documented, environmental officials said Saturday.
   ``If what was on the Karin B, or any other waste, is properly
identified, safely packaged, got the approval of waste disposal
authorities, is properly documented and complies with our laws,
there will be no problem,'' said an Environmental Department
spokesman in London, speaking anonymously in keeping with British
custom.
   In France, meanwhile, authorities said five sailors on the Karin
B have become ill but do not need immediate hospital treatment.
   The ship, with its leaking cargo, was turned away from Britain
last week and now is anchored in international waters off France's
Normandy coast.
   The Italian government announced Friday the ship would be
allowed to unload its cargo in Italy, probably at an unspecified
military port.
   France, Britain, Spain, West Germany, Belgium and the
Netherlands all refused entry to the Karin B, carrying 2,100 tons
of toxic wastes originally shipped from Italy and dumped illegally
in Nigeria.
   A statement issued Friday night by the maritime prefecture in
Cherbourg said a French navy doctor was taken by helicopter to
examine the crew members aboard the ship.
   The maritime prefecture statement said the five sailors
complained of pain in the chest and abdomen, while the rest of the
10-man crew, including the captain, reported no health problems.
   It said there would be further examinations of the ailing crew
members, but did not make clear whether they would sail with the
freighter to Italy.
   Italian officials have said they do not know the precise content
of the cargo, which may have originated from as many as 10 European
countries. The load was dumped secretly in Nigeria, whose
government insisted Italy remove them, and seized an Italian ship,
the Piave, last July to enforce its demands.

<NOTE>Eds: LEADS with three grafs to restore dropped word, percent, in
3rd graf; picks up 4th pvs: Lee, 64...</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By KENNETH L. WHITING</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>SINGAPORE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew led his People's
Action Party to its eighth straight election victory since 1959,
winning 80 seats in the recently enlarged 81-member Parliament.
   There had been no doubt that the People's Action Party would
win. When counting was completed Sunday, the party had won 69 of
the 70 seats contested in Saturday's balloting and 11 seats in
which its candidates were unopposed.
   Lee's party won 64.6 percent of final vote tally, compared with
64.8 percent in the previous election in 1984.
   Lee, 64, has been prime minister since 1959 when Singaore, a
former British colony, became self-governing. He is expected to
step down within the coming months and be succeeded by First Deputy
Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong.
   ``I take great satisfaction from the results .... The transition
is complete. The future is up to my younger colleagues,'' Lee told
a news conference.
   Lee was re-elected easily in his constituency, defeating lawyer
M.G. Guru who ran as an independent 14,043 votes to 3,167.
   The last Parliament had 79 seats. PAP held 76, two were vacant
and Chiam See Tong, leader of the Singapore Democratic Party had
the other.
   Candidates from seven opposition parties and four independents
failed to win any seats.
   Seven constituencies were abolished recently and nine new ones
created because of population shifts.
   Chiam, who won the only seat Saturday not claimed by the
governing party, immediately challenged Lee to hold a referendum on
Lee's proposal to replace the country's largely ceremonial
presidency.
   The president now is selected by the prime minister and his
Cabinet. Under the Lee's pln, the president would be elected and
would have veto power over spending from the nation's financial
reserves and appointments to senior civil service and judicial
positions.
   The president would have access to all government departments
but would not have full executive power.
   Lee said a president with veto powers could guard the nation's
financial reserves if future governments tried to use the money
unwisely.
   It has been suggested Lee might run for the office in a
presidential election and he was asked about that at his news
conference.
   ``The proposal has not been tailored for me,'' he said. ``I'll
campaign in support of it but I don't want the job.''
   Another issue stressed by the PAP is the planned creation of
town councils in each parliamentary constituency to manage public
housing. About 86 percent of Singapore's 2.6 million people live in
government-built apartments that are now administered by civil
servants.
   PAP candidates told voters that inept legislators controlling
the civil service could neglect rubbish collection, elevator
repairs and other routine but chores.
   Chaim said the town-council concept was ``part of the PAP's
overall plan to reduce the role of Parliament, to pave the way for
an executive president.''
   The Internal Security Act, which allows the government to detain
suspects indefinately without charges, had not been a major issue.
   Critics claim the measure was abused by the government to deal
with people opposed Lee's policies.
   The law was used to jail 22 alleged Marxists last year and hold
opposition lawyer Francis Seow for 72 days this year. Seow was
accused of dealing with U.S. diplomats to recruit lawyers to oppose
PAP parliamentary candidates.
   Voting was compulsory for those 21 or older and more than 90
percent of the 1.45 million eligible cast ballots in the contested
distsricts.

<HEAD>South African Official Warns of Crackdown on Clergy</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Minister of Law and Order
Adriaan Vlok warned that the government may soon begin a crackdown
on outspoken anti-apartheid clergymen.
   ``We must clip their wings, as we clipped those of the 19
revolutionary and activist organizations,'' Adriaan Vlok said,
referring to the government's February decision banning most
leading anti-apartheid groups.
   Vlok acknowledged that restrictions against church leaders would
bring a ``deafening condemnation,'' but he added, ``This is all
part of the propaganda plan against South Africa.
   ``The time has come for us to tear off the masks so that people
can see who are their friends and who are their enemies,'' he said
in his statement to Parliament on Friday.
   Vlok cited no religious leaders by name. Previously, he has been
harshly critical of anti-apartheid churchmen such as Archbishop
Desmond Tutu, winner of the 1984 Nobel Peace Prize; and Rev. Allan
Boesak, president of the World Alliance of Reformed Churches.
   Vlok also said authorities have arrested 18,911 people without
charge for more than 30 days during a 26-month-old state of
emergency. He said the figure includes 802 people detained since
June 10.
   Anti-apartheid groups say about 30,000 have been held for some
length of time.
   By law and custom, apartheid establishes a racially segregated
society in which the 26 million blacks have no vote in national
affairs. The 5 million whites control the economy and maintain
separate districts, schools and health services.

<HEAD>Tanker Hits Bottom, Leaks Tarlike Oil Into Mississippi River</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW ORLEANS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A tanker scraped the bottom of the
Mississippi River on Saturday, rupturing the hull and spilling
about 1 million gallons of thick, heavy oil into the channel, Coast
Guard officials said.
   Coast Guard Lt. Pat Galvin said the tanker, Esso Puerto Rico,
dragged the bottom of the river at about 5 a.m. The accident left a
10-by-4 hole in the ship's hull, damaging one tank aboard, he said.
   Galvin said the vessel was carrying a cargo of carbon black
feedstock oil, which is also known as aromatic tar. The leakage
wasn't discovered until the ship began to list about 3{ hours later
becaus the oil doesn't float, he said.
   The vessel, which is owned by Exxon Shipping Co., was bound from
the Exxon dock at Baton Rouge, La., to Rotterdam, The Netherlands.
   Exxon spokesman Les Rogers said the oil-product solidified when
it leaked into the river.
   ``We understand that there's no health threat. There's nothing
floating in the water,'' he said. ``We will be responsible for
whatever cleanup measures are taken. We always assume the
responsiblity when it's our vessel and our product.''
   A Coast Guard pollution-response team said a preliminary survey
indicated a loss of more than 23,000 barrels, or more than 1
million gallons, Galvin said.
   Rogers said the ship was fully loaded with about 185,000 barrels
when the accident occurred. ``Everything drained out of that one
compartment,'' Rogers said. ``There's nothing leaking now.''
   The ship was docked Saturday at Belle Chasse, La., which is
located about 20 miles down river from New Orleans.

<HEAD>Soviet Port of Vladivostok to Become Open City, Newspaper Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government will soon allow foreigners into the
Pacific coast city of Vladivostok, which serves as home port of the
Soviet navy and has been closed to non-Soviets for decades,
Izvestia said Saturday.
   ``This is no accident,'' the government daily newspaper said in
announcing the change. ``First of all, it is a result of the new
political initiatives of our country.''
   Vladivostok has in recent years become a scene and a symbol of
new Soviet efforts for better relations with the country's eastern
neighbors. In 1986, Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev gave a major
speech there, calling for increased cooperation with Asian and
Pacific nations.
   Izvestia did not say when Vladivostok would become an open city.
But later this month, an international symposium on problems of the
Asia-Pacific region is to be held in the city.
   According to Vladivostok's first deputy mayor, K. Dulov,
Gorbachev told former Japanese prime minister Yasuhiro Nakasone
during their Moscow meeting in July that the Soviets were thinking
of allowing foreigners into the city of 565,000 people.
   Dulov, in an interview with Izvestia, said the international
Asia-Pacific symposium was proof of the ``serious intention to open
the city to all.''
   ``Of course, today many limitations still exist, as in any
border city,'' Dulov said. ``Questions are being formulated about
how to remove them. This will take time....''
   Izvestia quoted Dulov as saying it already did not merit the
label ``closed,'' since 300 foreign delegations visited last year,
as compared to only 14 in 1985.
   Izvestia said there were also plans to create joint ventures
with foreign firms and a ``free economic zone'' in the Vladivostok
area, which would presumably be impossible if the city retains its
closed status.
   According to a Soviet Foreign Ministry note delivered to Moscow
embassies in January 1978, the entire Pacific Maritime Region where
Vladivostok is located is off-limits to foreigners, save for the
cities of Khabarovsk and Nakhodka and the section of the
Transsiberian railway linking them.
   Elsewhere in the Soviet Union, vast tracts are closed to
foreigners, including most of the territory of the Baltic republics
of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, and frontier areas adjacent to
China, Afghanistan, Iran, Turkey, Finland and Norway.

<DATELINE>CANBERRA, Australia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Voters on Saturday rejected proposed
changes in the constitution that opposition leaders said would have
benefited the present Labor Party government.
   One amendment would have have extended legislative terms for the
House of Representatives from three to four years, which would have
extended the current government's term by one year.
   With one-third of the ballots counted, Attorney General Lionel
Bowen conceded the four questions had been defeated. ``The saddest
thing is that it is likely to mean the end of any further move for
constitutional reform for at least a decade,'' he said.
   Bowen did not give any figures.
   There were 10.3 million eligible voters, but the final results
and turnout will not be known until Sunday because of the time
difference between the east and west coasts.
   Voters cast either ``Yes'' or ``No'' votes on each proposal.
   The opposition Liberal Party had campaigned against the
referendum, saying the changes would give more power to the federal
government of Prime Minister Bob Hawke.
   ``The Australian people have protected their constitution from
Labor's tampering,'' said Liberal leader John Howard. ``The whole
referendum campaign by the government has been a disgraceful waste
of the taxpayers money.''
   Voters cast ballots on the following proposals:
   _Setting four-year terms for members of both the House of
Representatives and Senate with elections to be held simultaneously
for the two chambers. At present elections for the house are held
every three years. Senators are elected for six-year terms with
half of the members elected every three years. _Change election
rules to provide each vote with the same value. Under the present
alignment of electoral districts, especially in the states of
Queensland and Western Australia, the vote in sparsely populated
rural districts has the same weight as the vote in populous urban
districts.
   _Constitutional recognition of local governments.
   _Constitutional guarantees to trial by jury, freedom of religion
and fair compensation for land owners whose property is acquired by
any government.
   Australia's constitution was adopted in 1901 when the country, a
former British colony, became an independent federation.
   There were no local governments at that time and the proposal
would have granted local governments constitutional recognition.
   Hawke had argued strongly for the changes in legislative terms,
saying four instead of three years was essential for any
administration to carry out its policies.

   Leftist guerrillas killed 18 peasants in a
revenge raid against a farming hamlet that had organized security
patrols to protect against insurgents, police reported Saturday.
   They said about 60 guerrillas of the Shining Path movement
entered the hamlet of Chullos, rounded up the inhabitants and
killed 18 after accusing them of partipating in anti-insurgency
patrols.
   The guerrillas then ransacked and burned many homes in the
hamlet that has a population of about 200, according to police.
   They said the attack occurred Monday but was not reported for
days because Chullo is isolated in the Andean mountains. The hamlet
is 50 miles from the provincial capital of Ayacucho, which is 225
miles southeast of Lima.
   The military and police have organized citizens' patrols in
villages in the central Andes as protection against the guerrillas.
   In an attack Thursday against a civilian patrol near Parihuanca,
135 miles east of Lima, Maoist guerrillas killed a local politician
and a farm administrator, police said.
   They identified the slain patrol leader as Parihaunca Councilman
Humberto Calderon but did not give the identity of the farm
administrator.
   The Shining Path rebels began their campaign eight years ago
from strongholds in Ayachuco province.
   Since then more than 15,000 people have been killed in violence
related to the insurgency including hundreds of members of village
patrols, according to government reports.

   A dead whale 76 feet long, tentatively

washed up on a beach near the southwest edge of San Francisco,
possibly early Saturday.
   ``It appears to be an adult blue whale,'' said Dr. Ray Dieter, a
veterinarian and chairman of the Coast Wildlife Society. He
estimated the whale's weight at over 150,000 pounds.
   Dieter said the creature was decomposing, and probably died last
week of undetermined causes. An attempt would be made to cart the
entire skeleton to a museum, possibly the California Academy of
Sciences in Golden Gate Park, he said.
   The Wildlife Society is conducting a marine mammal death and

   Federal police said Saturday they have broken
up an international drug ring that had planned to fly more than
1,500 pounds of cocaine to California this weekend.
   They displayed the drugs and presented nine suspects, including
two Californians, at a news conference.
   Police said the seizure of 1,583 pounds of cocaine was one of
the largest hauls of cocaine in Mexico in recent years, although in
raids in December about 4,410 pounds were confiscated.
   A plane from the United States was scheduled to pick up the
cocaine from a warehouse at an airstrip in central Michoacan state
and fly it to California during the weekend, according to police.
   They said the Californians were arrested last week in
Guadalajara and identified them as Mike Baldrike of Santa Cruz and
Patrick Henry of Olympic Valley.
   Police said four Mexicans, a Colombian and a Nicaraguan also
were arrested during the investigation.
   They said the cocaine was from Medellin, Colombia, headquarters
of the Medellin cartel that is one of the largest cocaine
trafficking operations in the world.

   A mother who went screaming to neighbors
that someone was stabbing her two children was later charged with
murdering them, police said Saturday.
   Angelinta Urena, 32, was charged in the deaths of Kelly America
Pena, 4, and her brother, Pershi ``Pepsi'' Pena, 8, detective Capt.
Bernard Gannon said.
   He said she would be arraigned Sunday if a judge was available.
   Ms. Urena, who was led from the slaying scene in handcuffs,
originally told police that a man had killed her children, Gannon
said.
   ``She became a stronger suspect in various phases of the
investigation as it went along, and that led to the charges,'' he
said.
   Gannon declined to specify what led police to suspect Ms. Urena
and he declined to speculate on a motive.
   Neighbors told television station WLNE they learned of the
slayings about 7 a.m. when Ms. Urena ran across the street naked
and screaming for help, saying someone was attacking her children.
   ``She came here and she wanted to use the phone, but they were
asking her, why, why, and she wouldn't answer. She would just say
that she needed to call police, that they were killing her
children,'' neighbor Maria Gomez told television station WJAR.
   The girl was found on her bed and the boy was on the floor of
the upstairs bedroom of their apartment, Gannon said.
   ``We don't know if they were stabbed in their beds or carried
there or what,'' he said. Only Ms. Urena and the children lived in
the home, Gannon said.
   Kelly was dead at the scene, but rescue crews detected a slight
pulse and rushed Pershi to Rhode Island Hospital, where he died,
Gannon said.
   Gannon said the children suffered multiple stab wounds. A fire
department dispatcher said rescue crews reported the boy may have
been stabbed as many as 15 times.

   Long before Oprah, Phil and Geraldo, there was
Bughouse Square, an open-air talk show where bohemian
intellectuals, freethinkers and religious fundamentalists spoke
from soapboxes in a city park.
   That free speech tradition came to life again Saturday as about
300 people turned out for a revival of the Bughouse Square debates,
which faded from the scene in the 1950s with the coming of the
television age.
   ``Bughouse Square was and is a symbol of free speech ... and
it's a matter of honoring and reviving that tradition,'' said Leon
Despres, 80, the former city council parliamentarian, who was named
the informal master of ceremonies of this year's debates.
   ``It's a chance to get away from the whole TV-radio portrayal of
events,'' said Jennifer Jeffris, a spokeswoman for the Newberry
Library, sponsor of Saturday's debates.
   Organizers said they couldn't find any wooden soapboxes, but
they did scrounge up some library footstools and made a speaker's
platform out of a plastic milk crate and a wooden board.
   Julius Lucius Echeles, a prominent Chicago attorney, argued for
decriminalizing drugs, as some in the crowd shouted, ``We want to
keep drugs out of the country'' or ``What's the going price for
coke?''
   Other speakers held forth on such topics as the 1968 Chicago
Democratic convention riots, nationalized health care and the new
generation.
   Alderman Luis Gutierrez, who staged a surrogate Bush vs. Dukakis
presidential debate with Thomas F. Roeser, the founder of the
conservative Republican Assembly of Illinois, said he expected more
heckling.
   ``It's a lot calmer than a (Chicago) City Council meeting,''
said Gutierrez.
   The debates were revived as a once-a-year event in 1986 by the
Chicago Bar Association and the Newberry Library, which sits
opposite Bughouse Square, officially known as Washington Square
Park.
   Bughouse Square still attracts the occasional religious soapbox
preacher, but the library would like it once again to be a place
for debates on a regular basis, said Ms. Jeffris.
   One version of how the square got its name is that many park
frequenters were residents of nearby ``bughouses,'' a slang term
for flophouses, said Terry Sullivan, a Newberry Library spokeswoman.
   Despres said he wanted to revive another Bughouse tradition _
heckling.
   ``Nowadays, people are so respectful ...,'' said Despres, an
independent alderman from 1955-75 in a council dominated by Mayor
Richard J. Daley's Democratic machine. ``But you really have to
remember that from time to time a speaker should be challenged if
he makes an outrageous statement.''
   The Bughouse Square tradition, modeled after Speaker's Corner in
London's Hyde Park, got its start in the 1920s, although the park
itself is nearly 150 years old.
   Arthur Weinberg, a 72-year-old author and social historian, said
he often spoke there on labor struggles in the 1930s.
   At the time, Weinberg recalled, the speakers would be out seven
days a week during the summer. Chicagoans would to there on dates,
and tourists came as well.
   ``You got the same thing in Bughouse Square as on shows like
(Phil) Donahue,'' said Weinberg.
   ``But the freedom that happened there was really remarkable. I
can't think of one incident when the police interfered.''
   Weinberg said Bughouse Square was like ``an open-air adult
education school.'' Many of the speakers would research their
topics in the Newberry Library by day, before taking the soapbox at
night.
   But Bughouse Square died with the anti-radical mood of the
McCarthy era and the advent of television in the 1950s, he said.
   ``What Bughouse Square offered _ that radio and TV can't _ is
the touch and closeness of the speaker. You can listen to Dan
Rather, but you can't get close to him.''

   A cloud of toxic chlorine gas leaked
from an industrial plant and forced a 7{-hour evacuation of up to
15,000 people east of Los Angeles on Saturday. At least 37 people
were taken to hospitals.
   A half-mile long gas cloud formed just after midnight outside a
plant that makes chlorine tablets for swimming pools, authorities
said. The chemical reaction that caused the cloud was brought under
control about nine hours later.
   Residents were told they could return home after getting the OK
from the Los Angeles County Department of Health. There were no
reports of serious injuries.
   An estimated 550 gallons of a chemical used to make the chlorine
tablets apparently became contaminated, setting off the reaction,
said Sheriff's Deputy Van Mosley.
   The air was permeated with the smell of bleach from the the
wispy, smoky-gray gas that billowed from the Grow Group Inc. plant.
Chlorine can be lethal in high concentrations but otherwise causes
burning eyes and sore throats.
   An estimated 10,000 to 15,000 people were evacuated, Los Angeles
County sheriff's Deputy Eric Smith said late Saturday.
   ``This was based on estimates made at the operations command
post,'' Smith said, adding that earlier estimates made during the
emergency may have been inaccurate.
   The Sheriff's Department initially put the estimate of evacuees
at up to 27,000, while a press release from the Montebello Police
Department said an area of that city encompassing up to 19,000
people was ordered evacuated.
   The American Red Cross said about 3,000 people went to shelters.
   Three people were in stable condition at Santa Marta Hospital
and Clinic, said nursing supervisor Verna Brinson. Four others with
respiratory complaints were treated at County-USC Medical Center
and released, said Norka Manning, a hospital spokeswoman.
   Beverly Hospital in Montebello was flooded with patients, but
only admitted one elderly person for observation, said emergency
room nurse Chuck Nemejc.
   ``We got about 30,'' he said. ``Most complained of throat
tightening, difficulty breathing, vomiting, headaches.''
   At the Pioneer High School gym, where hundreds of evacuees
waited, many said they were notified by neighbors or knocked on
doors themselves to rouse people.
   Grace O'Brien of Montebello said she bundled up her 89-year-old
mother when they left her home.
   ``I tried not to take deep breaths,'' she said. ``I told my
mother to roll up the car windows, and I made an illegal U-turn _ I
didn't think the deputies would stop me.''
   Like many other residents, Ms. O'Brien said she didn't smell
anything or see the chemical cloud.
   ``Didn't bother me. I've been through so much... tornadoes,
things like that,'' said Ms. O'Brien's mother, Marguerite Secrist,
a former Texas resident. The area evacuated comprised several
square miles in sections of East Los Angeles, Monterey Park,
Montebello and Commerce, authorities said. Residents were sent to
several high schools where the Red Cross had set up shelters.
   The plant was closed at the time of the leak, said plant manager
Kim Marti. ``The sheriff's department woke us up,'' Marti said.
   Sheriff's Deputy Sam Jones said the exact cause of the toxic
cloud was undetermined, but one possibility was that moisture
seeped into the containers in the plant and activated the dry
chemical, releasing chlorine gas.
   ``The prime suspect is moisture ... some moisture from
condensation from the high humidity we've been having,'' said Les
Wilde, president of Grow Group's Consumer and Professional Products
Group.
   However, the specific cause may never be known because of the
process by which authorities neutralized the chemical reaction, he
said.
   Firefighters sent a hazardous materials unit, which requested
soda ash to stabilize the chemical, said Hubert Parker, a spokesman
for the county Fire Department.
   The cloud drifted to the southwest, threatening to close
Interstate 5, which runs the length of the state and is one of its
busiest freeways. Police closed an exit ramp along the freeway, the
southern boundary of the evacuated area.

   Dangerous fumes from burning toxic chemicals kept
firefighters at bay Saturday as they struggled to douse a
four-alarm warehouse blaze that took 14 hours to bring under
control, officials said.
   ``There were some chemicals in there, one of them was toluene.
It is a flammable. What makes it bad as a health hazard is the
fumes and exposure to it,'' said Metro-Dade Fire Department
spokesman John Carroll.
   No injuries were reported.
   The fire began about 4 a.m. at the warehouse in an industrial
area near Miami International Airport, and was brought under
control at 6 p.m. Two of the 100 firefighters on the scene were
treated for heat exhaustion.
   ``We really don't have a potential (toxic) cloud problem now,''
Carroll said, adding that environmental officials were at the scene.
   The cause of the fire was under investigation. No damage
estimate was immediately available, but Carroll said walls blew out
and items inside the warehouse were heavily damaged.
   The warehouse was used to store items awaiting U.S. Customs
clearance.
   While the fire spewed little smoke, its toxic fumes kept
firefighters away, said Carroll. Toluene is a poisonous, colorless
liquid used in making dyes, explosives or solvents.
   ``We had to cut holes in the roof for ventilation, and part of
the roof is sagging badly,'' he said.
   Officials at first thought the tons of merchandise in the
warehouse included 150 55-gallon drums of toluene but Carroll said
there may have been more.
   ``Literally a myriad of things are in there, like stereos and
some containers that are sealed, we don't know what's in there,''
he said.
   The department planned to bring in heavy equipment to dig
through the material to get to the fire, Carroll said.
   Several blocks around the warehouse were closed to traffic.
   ``But it's a non-residential area and no one was working that
time,'' he said. Officials weren't sure who owned the warehouse.

   Heavy rains from two tropical storms
spawned flash floods and deadly mudslides near coastal regions
Saturday, forcing more than 50,000 residents to flee their homes
and killing at least three people, officials said.
   Rains from Tropical Storm Debby caused mudslides that buried two
homes and killed three people in Papantla, about 16 miles from the
Gulf of Mexico coast and 150 miles northeast of Mexico City, said
Veracruz state official Alfredo Algarin Vega.
   Another person was swept away and presumed drowned when the
Hueleque River overflowed its banks in Poza Rica, police Chief
Rosell Olivares Hernandez said. The government news agency Notimex
said more than 500 people lost their homes.
   Rains caused a flash flood in the town of Alamo, but about
30,000 people evacuated safely, according to Enrique Estrada, head
of the Red Cross in the nearby gulf city of Tuxpan. About 5,000
homes were flooded by the Tuxpan-Pantepec River there, he said. No
injuries were reported.
   Estrada said the river overflowed its banks shortly after
midnight.
   ``In a few minutes, it inundated most of the town,'' he said in
a telephone interview. However, he said residents were evacuated to
schools and office buildings on high ground before the flood.
   Alamo, a coffee-producing town of about 40,000, is 25 miles
inland from Tuxpan in the southern state of Veracruz about 300
miles south of the Texas border.
   Rivers and creeks overflowed their banks and destroyed homes in
the nearby towns of La Antigua, Cazones, Coatzintla and La
Palmilla, Notimex said.
   The government oil company Pemex said flood waters from the
Cotaxtla River ruptured nine oil and natural gas lines in Cotaxtla,
about 285 miles east of Mexico City.
   Workers were able to shut down the pipelines, which supply the
Matapionche petrochemicals plant with 3,600 barrels of crude and
gas daily, Pemex said.
   Another tropical storm, Kristy, doused the Mexico's Pacific
Ocean coast on Saturday, the Weather Service said. Rivers in the
southern states of Chiapas and Oaxaca overflowed in the heavy rains
ahead of the storm.
   Chiapas state Gov. Absalon Castellanos Dominguez declared a
state of emergency after 20,000 people evacuated their homes
because of flooding.
   Thousands of people were evacuated from Huixtla, Escuincla,
Pijijiapan, Arteaga and Tonala when the Cuatan Grande and the Chico
rivers flooded, the Excelsior news service said.
   Huixtla is about 10 miles inland from the gulf of Tehuantepec on
the Pacific Coast and about 550 miles southeast of Mexico City.
   In Oaxaca, an official for the state government told Excelsior
that the Salado River flooded about 150 homes along its the banks.
   The weather service said Kristy was about 450 miles southwest of
San Jose del Cabo, a city in the state of Baja California Sur, late
Saturday night and moving west at about 4 mph with winds of between
35 and 40 mph.
   Weather officials downgraded the system to tropical-depression
status.
   Debby, the first hurricane of the 1988 Atlantic season before it
was downgraded to tropical storm status, had broken up by Saturday
morning, weather officials said.
   But heavy rains were still falling in parts of Veracruz and
Tamaulipas states Saturday night, National Weather Service
spokesman Candido Alvarez said by telephone.
   Debby hit the coast at Tuxpan, a city of 120,000, on Friday
afternoon as a hurricane. It flooded streets and caused power
outages in the area about 160 miles northeast of Mexico City. The
city's port remained closed Saturday.
   It weakened several hours after striking land. It continued to
lumber inland Saturday.
   Debby was the first hurricane of the 1988 Atlantic hurricane
season and the fourth named storm.

   Hurricane Uleki resumed its march toward the
Hawaiian islands Saturday, slightly weakened but still posing a
considerable threat, forecasters reported.
   ``We hope it will weaken, so when it gets close, it will have
lost much of its punch,'' said meteorologist Clarence Lee of the
National Weather Service.
   At 2 p.m. (8 p.m. EDT) the storm was centered 325 miles south
southwest of Honolulu, or 345 miles south of Lihue, Kauai, with
maximum sustained winds of 100 mph and gusts to 120 mph, the
weather service said.
   Uleki was moving to the north at 2 to 3 mph, but that was
expected to pick up slightly to about 5 mph, Lee said.
   The storm had wind gusts up to 150 mph when it stalled about 360
miles south southeast of Honolulu on Friday night after making a
surprise turn towards the islands earlier in the day.
   ``Yesterday, the storm had a small, tight center. Today, it's a
large sprawling center. That's ususally an indication it is
weakening,'' Lee said.
   Even if Hawaii is spared the storm's worst winds, Uleki probably
will bring strong winds and rain to the islands sometime Sunday,
Lee said.
   ``Uleki is still a dangerous hurricane. Everyone should be
prepared,'' he said.
   A tropical storm watch was posted for the islands of Oahu, Kauai
and Niihau, meaning wind speeds of 39 mph to 73 mph were possible
through Sunday morning. A high surf advisory was posted for the
southern coasts of all islands.
   It was the second storm in a month to threaten the islands.
Hurricane Fabio was on a course toward the islands in early August
but then veered off and weakened, producing only some heavy rain on
parts of Kauai.

   Federal investigators said Saturday that
the co-pilot in the crash that killed 13 people here had no
recollection of the crucial moments in the aircraft's cockpit.
   A spokesman said investigators still had some work to do at the
muddy wreckage site, but some members of the National
Transportation Safety Board team were being sent back to
Washington, D.C.
   ``We're satisfied that we have documented the information we
need to collect,'' said NTSB member Lee Dickinson at a news
briefing Saturday night. ``Our field phase is winding down.''
   Dickinson said team members interviewed co-pilot Wilson
Kirkland, but he had no recollection of the Wednesday morning crash
of Delta Flight 1141, from the time the plane left the gate at
Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport until Thursday night in the
hospital.
   Kirkland was released from a suburban hospital Saturday. The
NTSB has not interviewed Capt. Larry Davis, who was flying the
craft.
   Davis, 48, was in fair condition at Parkland Memorial Hospital,
but Dickinson said Davis' doctor had not given investigators
permission to talk to him. ``My information is he is not medically
fit to talk to,'' he said, but later added they hope to interview
Davis in three or four days.
   NBC News on Saturday and The Washington Post's Sunday editions
reported that the cockpit crew talked, as they taxied to the end of
the runway, about the 1985 Delta Flight 191 crash that killed 137
at the airport.
   The newspaper's source, who listened to the jet's cockpit voice
recording, said the crew talked about politics and a recent
controversy about a portion of a cockpit recording in the crash of
a Continental Airlines jet last November in Denver.
   Dickinson said Saturday night that he had not heard the cockpit
voice recording nor read the newspaper's report, but added ``if in
our analysis we decide that's pertinent information, we'll analyze
it.''
   Dickinson said the noise of the engines going to full power are
the last sounds heard on the cockpit recorder before impact.
   Investigators Saturday also determined the plane had a normal
takeoff roll, using about 50 percent of the 11,300-foot runway.
Earlier, the NTSB said the plane's short flight may have been
affected by a long takeoff roll.
   No signs of damage have been found on any of the Boeing 727's
three engines, which were shipped Saturday to Pratt & Whitney in
Hartford, Conn., Dickinson said. One of the engines wound up
separated from the fuselage in the crash.
   Cranes and trucks hoisted engines and the cockpit from the
wreckage Saturday afternoon as some 30 people in hip boots and bib
overalls slogged through ankle-deep mud searching for clues.
   Ninety-five people survived when the plane, en route to Salt
Lake City, crashed and burst into flame on takeoff.
   The accident represented the first real-life test of a plane
fitted with seats and carpets made of new fire-blocking materials
required by the Federal Aviation Administration, experts said.
   While it is not known how large a role the fire-resistant
materials played in buying time for the 95 survivors, they may have
helped, said John Mazor, spokesman for the Air Line Pilots
Association in Washington.
   ``Just looking at the airplane _ the scorch marks and the way it
broke up on impact _ typically you might have expected a greater
number of fatalities out of an accident like that,'' he said. ``We
won't know how we were so lucky until we get more factual
information and some analysis.''
   The wreckage was visible to passengers of planes landing or
taking off, but its Delta logo had been covered with white paint
Saturday.
   Funerals for three of the victims were held Saturday. Services
were held Friday for a Dallas couple and a veteran Delta flight
attendant.
   The NTSB teams concentrated on inconsistencies regarding the
plane's wing flaps and engines.
   Evidence has not yet confirmed witness' accounts that the
engines trailed flame during takeoff, said Bernard Loeb, NTSB
deputy director of investigations.
   No signs of damage have been found on any of the engines, which
will be shipped to Pratt & Whitney in Hartford, Conn.,
investigators said.
   Although cockpit instruments told crew members that the wing
flaps were in proper position for takeoff, inspections of the
wreckage found that the flaps and slats appeared to be in the
opposite of the correct position, investigators said.
   NTSB officials said locking devices on the slats probably would
have prevented them from being knocked out of position during the
crash.
   Flight engineer Steven Judd, interviewed in his hospital room
Friday, told investigators he remembered pilot Larry Davis saying,
``15 15 Green,'' indicating the instruments showed the flaps were
at the proper 15 degree angle for takeoff, Dickinson said.
   Dickinson said the inspectors would review Delta's operations
procedures to see if the flaps might have been brought up as a
response to emergency engine failure. He said they also needed to
reconstruct the history of the crew: how much rest the members had
before the flight, if they had worked together before, and other
factors that may have affected performance.

   Heavy rain fell over the lower Mississippi Valley on Saturday
and extended northeastward up the Ohio Valley, and thunderstorms
were scattered across the upper Midwest.
   The Northwest, meanwhile, had temperatures 20 degrees or more
higher than normal.
   Record high temperatures were set Saturday in Kalispell, Mont.,
97; Medford, Ore., 107; Missoula, Mont., 98; Reddig, Calif., 116;
Reno, Nev., 100; San Diego, Calif., 92; Spokane, Wash., 98 and
Yakima, Wash., 100.
   Abundant moisture flowing northward from a tropical disturbance
anchored over the northwestern Gulf of Mexico collided with a cold
front extending from the Great Lakes into northern Texas, producing
locally heavy rain.
   Rainfall amounts Friday night and Saturday morning ranged from 2
to 5 inches across the region.
   Thunderstorms produced locally heavy rain along coastal areas of
Texas and Louisiana. Galveston, Texas, reported 5.91 inches of rain
from midnight to early afternoon.
   A flash flood watch was posted through the night for
southwestern Louisiana and northeastern Texas.
   Thunderstorms were widespread over Louisiana. A tornado was
spotted in the Whisperwood subdivision of northern Slidell, but
only minor damage and no injuries were reported.
   Showers and thunderstorms also spread northeastward through the
lower Mississippi Valley, with rainfall amounts ranging from 1 to 3
inches over southeastern Oklahoma. Natural Dam, Ark., reported 4.6
inches and 3.44 inches of rain was measured at St. Francis, Ark.
   Many areas of Indiana reported over an inch of rain with
Alexandria measuring 2.36 inches.
   Rain and thunderstorms spread across Ohio and Kentucky, with
rainfall amounts generally around an inch. However, Lexington, Ky.,
measured 2.08 inches in just over an hour during the afternoon.
   Strong thunderstorms also developed over southern and eastern
Wisconsin during the afternoon, with one-inch hail reported in
Green Lake County.
   Other showers and a few thunderstorms were scattered over parts
of southern Minnesota and the western half of Iowa.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 57
degrees at Rhinelander, Wis., to 110 at Palm Springs and El Cajon,
Calif. The low for Saturday was 30 degrees at Gunnison, Colo.
   For Sunday, rain and thunderstorms were forecast from the Great
Lakes to western New England and the Atlantic states, and over the
western Gulf Coast. Scattered showers and thunderstorms were
forecast over the southern Atlantic states and the lower
Mississippi Valley.
   Highs in the 60s were predicted from the upper Mississippi
Valley through the northern Great Lakes region and the northern
half of New England; in the 90s over much of Florida; from the mid
90s to 105 from the continental divide over western Montana across
Idaho and into the Great Basin of Nevada and western Utah, and the
desert Southwest into southern California; between 105 and 115 over
the northern California valleys; and in the 70s or 80s across much
of the rest of the nation.

   Smoke from Idaho's fires caused dangerous pollution Saturday,
fires near Yellowstone National Park threatened to merge and burn
into two Montana towns, and firefighters throughout the West
battled blazes in record or near-record heat.
   About 25,500 firefighters and support personnel are battling the
fires in the West, which have burned nearly 3.6 million acres this
summer, said Mike Ferris, spokesman at the federal Boise
Interagency Fire Center in Idaho.
   Fires also raged in Utah, Oregon, Washington and Wyoming.
   Idaho's Air Quality Bureau on Saturday placed the entire
southern part of the state under an air stagnation advisory,
because of limited visibility and air pollution caused by a pall of
smoke from the forest fires.
   ``The fires are funneling smoke along the entire Snake River
Valley,'' said bureau spokesman Orville Green. The advisory banned
outdoor burning and cautioned people with heart or respiratory
ailments to remain inside or curtail activity.
   Authorities knocked on doors of more than 150 recreation cabins
threatened by a forest fire in the Island Park area of northeastern
Idaho Saturday afternoon, warning residents to start packing for a
possible evacuation.
   In Montana, forest officials told residents of Cooke City and
Silver Gate near the Yellowstone Park boundary to prepare to leave
their homes as two fires burning in rugged, timber-covered terrain
approached.
   ``Things didn't go very well on the line today,'' fire
information officer Nick Tafoya said Saturday evening.
   The 57,000-acre Storm Creek fire was burning in
``firestorm-type'' conditions Saturday less than three miles from
Silver Gate and Cooke City, officials said.
   Forest Service spokesman Pat Kaunert said the several hundred
residents of these two gateway communities might have to evacuate
by early Sunday, leaving firefighters behind to fortify the area.
   On the nearby Hellroaring Creek fire, shifting winds Saturday
prompted postponement of plans to start backfires, spokesman Bill
Timko said. The 200-acre fire is expected to merge with the Storm
Creek blaze sometime this holiday weekend.
   That blaze forced officials Saturday to close the road from the
park's northeastern entrance.
   Winds largely pushed fires to the southwest Saturday, away from
West Yellowstone, Wyo., where volunteers put down 2 miles of
irrigation pipe to moisten the ground between the flames and the
tourist town.
   However, forecasts called for the winds to come from the
southwest again by Monday, which could blow the fire back toward
West Yellowstone.
   Park spokeswoman Amy Vanderbilt said firefighters placed an
emphasis on extinguishing a spot fire near West Yellowstone
Airport, as winds did not push the main body of the fire any closer
to the community than 1 mile.
   In Utah, four air tankers and a helicopter dropped chemical
retardant on a 1,500-acre brush fire Saturday as flames moved to
within 1,000 yards of more than 50 homes in Killyon Canyon east of
Salt Lake City.
   The homes were among more than 70 evacuated in the area late
Friday as high winds pushed flames through heavy scrub oak, said
Kathy Jo Pollock, spokeswoman for the Interagency Fire Center.
   ``Our top priority is to keep the fire away from those homes and
that's exactly what we're doing,'' said Pollock.
   Oregon officials hoped a forecast of lightning wouldn't come
true. They said the state's parched forests and rangelands would
erupt with new wildfires if lightning strikes.
   ``You could bet your house on it, really,'' said Don Ferguson, a
spokesman for the multiagency fire command center in Portland.
``There's probably a 90 percent ignition potential, meaning that
out of every 10 fire sources, nine of them will ignite a fire.''
   The National Weather Service said temperatures in the Northwest
were 20 degrees higher than normal on Saturday. Record high
temperatures were set in Kalispell, Mont., 97; Medford, Ore., 107;
Reddig, Calif., 116; Reno, Nev., 100; San Diego, Calif., 92; and
Yakima, Wash., 100.
   Fires burned Saturday on about 15,000 acres in seven parts of
Washington, said Ron DeHart of the U.S. Forest Service. Most were
caused by lightning in the northeastern part of the state.
   Despite progress in battling the blazes, officials feared the
effect of the heat.
   ``All these fires are real worries because any one of them can
blow up,'' DeHart said. ``Firefighters really have their work cut
out for them.''
   A 7,500-acre fire burning in Washington's Colville National
Forest jumped a highway at Sherman Pass, threatened a power line
and moved to within 10 miles of Republic, a town of about 1,000
people. Residents of a handful of rural homes northeast of town
were asked to leave, and officials drew up contingency plans to
evacuate the entire town, Ferry County Sheriff Richard Baldwin said.

   Dreams of riches churned out of Florida Lotto
machines at a rate of more than 850 a second Saturday as fortune
hunters rushed for a chance to win the nation's largest-ever
lottery jackpot, an estimated $52 million.
   ``We've gotten calls from London, Australia and Spain asking
about the Lotto game,'' said state Lottery Secretary Rebecca Paul.
   The payoff was estimated at $52 million, officials said. The
previous record jackpot of $51.4 million was set in California in
June; two winners split that one.
   Players turned to psychics, gimmicks and other formulas to beat
the 14 million-to-1 odds of picking the six winning digits out of
49.
   The six numbers drawn Saturday night were 3-27-19-35-20-5.
   Lottery officials did not expect to know if anyone matched the
six numbers until sometime Sunday.
   At times Saturday, tickets were going at a pace of 859 a second,
said Mrs. Paul. By 11 p.m., sales for the day were $14.60 million,
and $44.78 million for the week. The previous week, total sales
were $24.2 million.
   ``Frantic isn't the word,'' said James Salvatore, owner of Lotto
News in Miami, which has sold more than 40,000 of the $1 tickets
since last Sunday. ``It's madness.''
   There hasn't been a winner in the drawing since Aug. 6. That
boosted the jackpot with each passing week. A week ago, the jackpot
was at $30 million.
   ``The public is going wild,'' said James Stephen, manager of the
Stop'n'Go convenience store in Riviera Beach. ``They are lined up.
They are standing in line 30 minutes, an hour. It doesn't matter.
It's totally crazy.''
   Mrs. Paul said the heavy pace of ticket sales, which may exceed
40 million for the week, could boost the jackpot above $53 million.
   Mrs. Paul touts the lottery as a way to attract tourists to
Florida, and people were spilling over the borders in search of
tickets.
   David Kelley, owner of the Interstate Lottery Courier Service in
Stafford, Va., drove 700 miles to Jacksonville on Thursday to buy
4,000 tickets. By Friday evening, all the tickets were sold for
$1.75 each.
   Kelley was scheduled to return Saturday evening on a flight from
Jacksonville with 2,300 more tickets, said his wife, Judy. ``And
about 700 to 800 of those are already reserved,'' she said.
``People want that prize.''
   Hundreds of players also traveled from Georgia and Alabama,
which do not have lottery games.
   ``There are times when the parking lot looks just like a
drive-in theater,'' said Donnie Trednick, a regional manager for
Jax Liquors chain. ``Almost everyone's from Georgia. It's just a
big social event.''
   Those who don't want to bet on a string of relatives' birthdays
in their quest for Lotto luck can turn to other sources for their
numbers.
   For Lotto players at Frank Russo's Tampa newsstand, 25 cents can
be put in a machine that coughs up six numbered balls. Russo also
has sold out of 500 Pocket Picks, a $1.89 plastic device attached
to a key chain that dispenses six pellets marked 1 through 49.
   ``People went nuts for them,'' Russo said.
   Personal computer users can buy a program to select numbers
randomly the high-tech way.
   For $25, psychic Madame Ann will pick the digits.
   ``When I concentrate on the numbers for them, I may get one,
two, three or 15,'' she said. ``Unfortunately, I haven't met any
psychic who could pick numbers to benefit themselves. The gift I
have is to help other people with.''

<HEAD>Transsexual Christine Jorgensen Battling Cancer</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN CLEMENTE, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Christine Jorgensen, the ex-G.I.
whose sex change operation nearly four decades ago led to a career
as a nightclub entertainer and writer, is battling spreading cancer.
   On Friday, she started a new round of chemotherapy treatments at
Mission Hospital Regional Medical Center in Mission Viejo in an
effort to stave off the cancer that has spread from her bladder to
her lungs.
   Fighting the disease is ``all-consuming and incredibly
inconvenient,'' she told The Orange County Register.
   Ms. Jorgensen, 62, learned she had cancer last year.
   The day Ms. Jorgensen learned she had the same disease that
killed her mother in 1967, Ms. Jorgensen went home and took a long
look at herself in her bathroom mirror.
   ``I said to myself, `Look, you've coped with a lot already. You
can handle this, too. So you might as well get on with it.''
   Because of the expensive chemotherapy and two operations to
remove tumors, Ms. Jorgensen had to sell her 3,000-square foot
Laguna Niguel home. She and her 7-year-old terrier, Bonnie, have
been living in a three-bedroom apartment here.
   Ms. Jorgensen's story made world headlines 37 years ago when she
went to Copenhagen, Denmark, as George Jorgensen Jr. and returned
as Christine Jorgensen.
   With the unanticipated limelight, she joined the lecture and
nightclub circuit, authored books, met royalty and celebrities,
found new gentlemen friends and ended up with enough money, jewels
and furs to provide a comfortable lifestyle.
   Ms. Jorgensen insists she has no regrets about the operation and
is proud to have been part of the sexual revolution.
   She acknowledged time has taken its toll. ``Getting myself
together takes a little more effort these days.''
   But it's also had its advantages, she said. ``I'm not that
recognizable anymore. I can actually go into a supermarket and
people don't know who I am, which is just wonderful and suits me
just fine.''
   Despite her time-consuming treatments, Ms. Jorgensen said she
still has time for reading and preparing her second autobiography.
   She hopes to work with other cancer patients someday, she said,
but added: ``Cancer is quite unforgiving. It's the kind of thing
that prevents you from making terribly long-range plans.''

<HEAD>Safety Probe Reported Into Boeing Ball Bearings</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal officials are investigating whether
airline safety has been threatened by more than 2,000 ball bearings
used in Boeing 737, 747 and 757 jetliners manufactured in the last
two years, it was reported Friday.
   A lawsuit filed in federal court last week by an airplane parts
manufacturing company alleged the ball bearings were counterfeit.
   ``Is there a safety problem?'' David Duff, a Federal Aviation
Administration spokesman in Seattle, told the Los Angeles Times in
an article published Friday. ``That is our main concern. If we
identify anything in that area, we will take care of it
immediately.''
   Boeing spokesman William Clark acknowledged that FAA
investigators had met with Boeing officials Thursday, but declined
to reveal details.
   ``Beyond that, you're going to need to go to them to find out
their future plans,'' he said.
   Boeing has declined to say how many jets manufactured after July
1, 1986, contain the allegedly bogus bearings, or which airlines
bought the planes.
   Since July 1, 1986, Boeing has manufactured 490 Boeing 737, 747
and 757 aircraft, the company said. That works out to about 20
percent of the Boeing planes of these types in use worldwide.
   The Boeing jet that crashed Wednesday in Dallas was a 727.

<TEXT>
   Engines similar to those on the Delta Air
Lines jet that crashed in Dallas have malfunctioned 28 times in the
past five years but have not caused any accidents, Federal Aviation
Administration records show.
   The Pratt & Whitney JT8D Model 15 engines have failed on
liftoff, suffered minor explosions during takeoff and vibrated in
flight, according to records provided Friday by the FAA's office in
Oklahoma City.
   Investigators of Wednesday's crash at the Dallas-Fort Worth
International are studying the Boeing 727 jet's three engines and
the position of its wing flaps as they search for the cause of the
crash that killed 13 people.
   Bobbie Mardis of the FAA's public affairs office said the FAA
records covered five years. ``We asked for a printout of accidents
or incidents where the JT8D-15 was a contributing factor to
whatever happened,'' she said.
   On the printout, drawn from the FAA's accident-incident report,
each example was listed as an incident.
   ``There were no accidents as a result of engine problems,''
according to the computer, Ms. Mardis said.
   In one case, takeoff was aborted when a Douglass DC-9 leaving a
New York airport in June 1983 lost power in the right engine,
causing smoke and flames to come out of the engine. The report said
the cause was ``third stage turbine failure.''
   As a Boeing 727 was taking off from an Ohio airport in April of
this year, a loud bang was heard. ``The number three engine turbine
had failed with parts spraying on runway. Takeoff aborted. No
fire,'' the report said.
   In April 1984, an explosion occurred in an engine during the
takeoff and initial climb of a Boeing 727, causing a loss of the
hydraulic system.
   In November 1983, a Boeing 727 jetliner in New York had its No.
3 engine fail on liftoff. After returning, mechanics found the rear
turbine blade broken off and the engine was replaced, the report
said.
   Other problems listed were engines overheating, engines shutting
down for various reasons and oil pressure fluctuation.

<HEAD>America West Airlines Jetliner Nearly Lands at Wrong Field</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DURANGO, Colo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An America West Airlines jetliner carrying
38 passengers nearly landed at a small airport before the pilot
recognized the mistake and pulled out 1,000 feet above the narrow
runway, it was reported Friday.
   The Boeing 737 landed safely Thursday night at the larger
Durango-La Plata County Airport, its correct destination, five
miles to the east of Animas Air Park.
   The Federal Aviation Administration began investigating the
incident involving Flight 1240 after inquiries by the Durango
Herald, which reported the mixup.
   America West also is investigating the incident, said Kathy
Christianson, manager of corporate communications for the
Phoenix-based airline.
   The Durango airport has no tower, so the two pilots were
following instruments, she said. ``The pilots did what we call a
fly-around and landed at the Durango airport.''
   John Ford, an apprentice mechanic at Animas Air Park who was an
eyewitness, said it appeared the aircraft was going to land at the
air park.
   Ford said air park officials didn't radio the jet but the pilot
pulled out of the landing pattern himself, apparently realizing the
mistake.
   The runway was clear at the time and a landing posed no danger
to people on the ground. However, the wide-bodied jet would have
encountered severe complications if it tried to land, Ford said,
noting the runway is only 50 feet wide and shorter than the
commercial airport's.
   ``If he knew what he was doing he could have pulled it off,'' he
said, but the landing would be possible only if the pilot were
aware of the runway's smaller size.
   Sue vonKersburg was walking her dog near Animas Air Park when
she noticed the plane's lights in the distance.
   ``I realized it was quite a large plane. I could see writing on
the fuselage. ... Then I heard him start to give it power. I knew
he had made a mistake before he did,'' vonKersburg said.
   She said she called America West at the Durango-La Plata County
Airport to report the incident and was told the airline already had
received five calls.

   An 84-year-old woman delivered a World
War I hand grenade to police Friday under Britain's month-long
amnesty program designed to collect illegal firearms.
   ``Can I turn this in, please?'' the woman asked officers as she
removed the grenade from her shopping bag at the Dorset police
station in Ferndown, 117 miles southwest of London.
   Police did not identify the woman but quoted her as saying the
grenade, which still was intact with explosives and the activator
pin, had been on the mantelpiece in her home for years. They did
not say how or when she had acquired the deadly device.
   The amnesty is intended to give people a chance to surrender
illegal weapons before new laws take effect that would strengthen
Britain's present weapons-control measures, among the toughest in
the world.
   Other weapons turned in since the amnesty program began Thursday
included a submachine gun and a crossbow.

   Barge traffic moved smoothly but slowly on
the lower Mississippi River on Friday, prompting the Coast Guard to
relax restrictions on towboat loads imposed because of low water.
   ``We've gotten to the point where we have a very stable
channel,'' said Michael Donohoe, commander of the Coast Guard
district from Caruthersville, Mo., to Greenville, Miss.
   Towboat operators, restricted to a maximum of 16 barges since
June, will likely increase their loads to 20 barges and some may go
to 25, Donohoe said.
   Towboats on the lower Mississippi often push 25 barges this time
of year and in high water can handle 30 to 40. Barge operators say
they will lose $200 million this year because of the low water
caused by this year's severe drought.
   The Coast Guard also limited barges to drafts of 8.5 feet,
meaning the weight of their loads had to be limited. The barges
generally draw nine feet of water.
   The drought caused the river to drop more than 20 feet below
normal at Memphis in July.
   It still was 12 feet below normal Friday at Memphis, but Donohoe
said dredging by the Army Corps of Engineers and successes in
keeping towboat traffic moving have reduced the worst shoaling in
the river.
   The shipping channel is at least 11 feet deep throughout the
375-mile Memphis district, he said.
   The Coast Guard said 126 groundings have been reported in the
Memphis district since the first of June, with 41 occurring in a
single week in July.

   Solidarity leader Lech Walesa succeeded in
stopping Poland's strongest wave of strikes in seven years Saturday
when 250 coal miners ended a sit-in and 2,400 bus and dock workers
cut short a strike.
   The 19-day wave of strikes, which involved 100,000 employees
nationwide, ended in a whirlwind of appeals and arm-twisting.
Walesa urged supporters to end local disputes so that promised
roundtable talks could begin on union pluralism and legalizing
Solidarity.
   The labor unrest was the strongest challenge to communist
authorities since they crushed the Soviet bloc's first independent
labor federation with the 1981 martial law crackdown.

Republican State Rep. Tom Ryder of Illinois _ a key battleground
state where Republicans concede that Dukakis maintains a slight
edge.
   In Delaware, ``as in the rest of the country, there's been a
substantial shift in the last three weeks from Dukakis to Bush,''

   A secret new spy satellite circled

continue relying on aging systems for eavesdropping and warning of
missile attacks.
   The satellite, said to be designed for intercepting Soviet
communications, was propelled into a successful preliminary orbit
by a $65 million Titan 34D rocket launched here Friday.
   But a source close to the project said the spacecraft failed to
achieve a desired stationary orbit 22,300 miles high when the upper
stage of the rocket failed to re-ignite.
   The source, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the
satellite remained in a sharply elliptical orbit ranging from about
100 to 22,300 miles above Earth.
   He said the payload was useless on that course and there was
little hope of salvaging the mission.

   Throughout the West Bank

violent debate on the wisdom of declaring a state and forming a
provisional government.
   Leading members of Yasser Arafat's Fatah faction of the
Palestine Liberation Organization have proposed recognizing Israel
and seeking international recognition for statehood on the West
Bank and Gaza Strip.
   These ideas are meeting surprisingly strong opposition from
Islamic groups and radical leftists.
   The misgivings prompted a recent decision to postpone until the

   President Augusto Pinochet has seized the
initiative in a carefully orchestrated campaign for eight more
years of rule, extending highly publicized olive branches to
critics of his authoritarian government.
   But the Chilean opposition remains confident of defeating the
72-year-old army commander at the voting booth in a presidential
plebiscite scheduled for Oct. 5.
   In two adept moves, made 48 hours after fellow military
commanders nominated him Tuesday as sole candidate in a
presidential referendum, Pinochet broadcast a conciliatory appeal
for opposition collaboration and authorized the return of all 430
remaining political exiles.
   Leaders of the local Roman Catholic Church lauded both measures
as helping national reconciliation. ``We have to be truly happy
with these positive steps,'' said the country's cardinal, Juan

   By lavishing attention and resources on the military and with a
substantial assist from the Soviet Union, Cuba can send large
numbers of troops on foreign expeditions without sacrificing its
ability to defend its own territory.
   There are an estimated 60,000 Cubans serving in Angola, a figure

<HEAD>Early Complex Civilizations Explored in Documentary</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JERRY BUCK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prehistoric American civilizations were not
built by transplanted Egyptians or wandering ancient astronauts,
says archaeologist Wilburn ``Sonny'' Cockrell of Florida State
University.
   The origin of the mound builders of North America and the
pyramid and city dwellers of Central and South America is explored
on ``The Search for Ancient Americans'' on public television
Wednesday night.
   ``A number of people, particularly in this century, have come to
an almost racist view of the American Indians,'' said Cockrell.
``They look at the high civilizations these ancient people built,
at their complex cultures and monumental achievements, and refuse
to accept that they were American aboriginals.
   ``Popular writers from the 18th century on looked at the mounds,
at the Anasazi pueblos in New Mexico, at the ruins of cities in
Central and South America and said they must have been built by
some vanished race. Later writers came up with the notion of
Egyptians and ancient astronauts.''
   Cockrell says the early Americans crossed a land bridge that
connected Asia and western North America in the Ice Age.
   ``Due to the mile-thick continental glaciers, the oceans were
300 feet lower, allowing these first immigrants to enter the New
World,'' Cockrell said in a telephone interview from Warm Mineral
Springs, Fla., where he is director for FSU's archaeological
research project.
   ``There were several waves of immigrants, and this show depicts
what scientists know about these people and their descendants. We
survey them over a wide geographic range and over a long temporal
range and look into questions as to why particular cultural
manifestations arose and why they disappeared.''
   The one-hour documentary is part of ``The Infinite Voyage''
series and will appear later on some commercial stations. The show
is a joint venture of PBS and the National Academy of Sciences and
was produced by WQED-TV in Pittsburgh.
   Cockrell is serving as spokesman for the show, although he
appears on the broadcast only in sequences about his project,
recovering the 12,000-year-old remains and artifacts of
Paleo-Indians from a sink hole.
   ``The Search for Ancient Americans'' will be followed in
subsequent weeks by reruns of four shows from last season.
   ``The celestial observations of the native Americans,
specifically Central Americans, were more sophisticated and had
greater accuracy than those of Western civilization,'' he said.
``Their understanding of astronomical events and the
interrelationship of celestial movements extends back at least one
millennium before the birth of Christ and probably earlier.
   ``They had the concept of the zero before Westerners. The
Post-Classic Mayans had libraries full of books called codices
which extensively documented Mayan culture. These libraries were
destroyed by the Spanish, who assumed that since these Indians
weren't Christian their ability to read and write was in conflict
with the Spanish concept of God.''
   The documentary ranges from the now-submerged land bridge
between Siberia and Alaska to the jungle-covered pyramids in
Central America. The trek of the first immigrants from Asia is
re-created by a group of Native Americans.
   The program then moves ahead to Warm Mineral Springs, where
Cockrell heads the archaeologists and paleontologists recovering
remains of the Paleo-Indians. Inland from Cape Canaveral, Fla.,
another FSU group led by Dr. Glen Doran is shown excavating a
7,000-year-old cemetery from the Archaic period.
   ``The recovery of the skeleton of a 16-year-old male who
suffered from spina bifida indicates that the people were
compassionate and economically stable enough to care for a helpless
member of their group throughout his life,'' he said.
   The show then goes to Chaco Canyon, N.M., where National Park
Service archaeologists and their colleagues are looking into the
complex civilization of the vanished Anasazi culture.
   ``Archaeologists are careful to use the term culture,'' said
Cockrell. ``People don't vanish, but cultures vanish. People live
on but adopt or become participants in other cultures. It's rare
that an entire population vanishes, such as the concept of Atlantis
falling into the sea.
   ``The civilization of Atlantis did not vanish into the sea. The
myth refers to the dissolution of the culture of the Minoan Crete,
probably by the eruption of a volcano. The people remained to
become the inhabitants of the Greek islands and classical Greece.''
   Cockrell said non-profit educational institutions are encouraged
to videotape the show. The Digital Equipment Corp. has distributed
25,000 teaching guides to schools.

<HEAD>Drought Hasn't Dried Up Political Punch of Farm Bloc in Congress</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE ROBINSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   American farmers, dwindling in number,
stricken by drought and plagued by chronic money woes, are proving
they can still produce a bumper crop of political power on Capitol
Hill.
   ``Farmers have got the votes and they get pandered to because
they've got the votes,'' says Rep. Sam Gibbons, D-Fla., one of just
29 House members who voted against this summer's $3.9 billion
drought relief legislation.
   Most lawmakers said farmers deserved help after drought wrecked
37 percent of the corn crop, 23 percent of the soybeans and tore
into the harvest of spring wheat. Most also agree the price tag
looks bigger than it is _ because it falls within the amount the
government stands to save because of drought.
   Three factors powered the bill from the hopper to the
president's desk in less than a month. One was the traditional
American generosity toward hard-pressed family farmers. Lawmakers
cited it repeatedly.
   ``In this country we have a tradition of helping someone who
through no fault of his own winds up behind the eight ball,'' says
Rep. Edward R. Madigan, R-Ill., the top Republican on the House
Agriculture Committee.
   ``There is the presumption that farming as a way of life is
somehow morally superior,'' Rep. Barney Frank, D-Mass., a critic of
farm spending, declares caustically.
   Another factor that fuels farm bills, officials said, was a keen
awareness that blocs of farm voters can swing close elections in
many states. Politicians often trace the 1986 unseating of Sens.
James Abnor, R-S.D., and Mark Andrews, R-N.D., to dissatisfaction
with the farm economy.
   ``Every senator has some agriculture in his state,'' observers
House minority counsel Hyde Murray, a longtime observer of farm
politics. He says lawmakers who must pay close heed to the wishes
of such voters number well over 100 in the 435-member House.
   Such pressures were at work not only in shaping the drought
legislation but a wide-ranging 1985 blueprint for snapping the farm
economy out of stagnation that plagued it throughout the early
1980s.
   While revitalizing markets, the measure also sent the cost of
subsidies to a 1986 peak of $26 billion and sent million-dollar
payments to corporate farmers.
   Widespread complaints about the cost resulted in a decision by
Congress to cap most individual payments at $50,000 and a few
exceptions at $250,000. Approval of programs was preceded by heavy
lobbying among producers groups.
   Likewise, the drought bill signed by President Reagan on Aug. 11
contains an about-face in dairy policy that will cost taxpayers an
estimated $185 million to $200 million. Approval of the provisions
represented a distinct victory for dairy farmers.
   Such measures are as old as Congress. Indeed, farm programs go
back to colonial times and the marble columns resembling corn
stalks and tobacco plants in the Capitol vestibule suggest
farming's special place.
   Price supports _ a floor under crop prices with government
serving as the buyer of last resort _ arrived with the Depression
and now form the bedrock of U.S. farm policy. Since then, Congress
also has spawned income supports, conservation payments and export
subsidies to keep farmers afloat.
   As farm numbers have dwindled, however, some farm groups have
increasingly adopted campaign contributions to help make their
voice heard in Washington.
   ``I think statements that farmers always get their way are
overblown,'' says agricultural consultant William Lesher. ``But
there are exceptions.''
   ``Sugar and dairy are two tough ones,'' he says. ``They just
seem to do their jobs and get their way. I think it has to do with
campaign contributions and I think it has more to do with the size
of their campaign contributions than with their persuasiveness in
making their case.''
   Huge dairy cooperatives have led all of agriculture in campaign
contributions for a decade and plunged millions of dollars into
House and Senate races. In the last two years, the Dallas-based
Associated Milk Producers Inc. has contributed $349,950 to 195
candidates.
   It gave a total of $891,950 to candidates in the 1986 election
to rank 23rd among the 3,187 groups registered with the Federal
Election Commission.
   By comparison, the National Association of Realtors, reported
$2,751,588 in contributions to 1986 campaigns to rank No.1, and 16
groups in all handed out $1 million or more in political donations
that year.
   The No.2 co-op, Mid-America Dairymen Inc., has contributed
$241,400 to 225 candidates over the last two years. It donated
$467,500 to 1986 campaigns to rank 47th among groups registered
with the Federal Election Commission.
   Four of the five top cooperatives contributing to 1986
candidates were dairy groups. They gave a total of $1,680,168.
Sixteen of the top 50 cooperatives were dairy groups, according to
commission records.
   ``Our dairy farmers out there have a lot of cows,'' says
Mid-America lobbyist Frank Vacca. ``And those cows are their
producers. I like to say that I've got 535 producers up here'' on
Capitol Hill.
   ``We're here to represent our constituents who are good
producers and if we have some good producing congressmen and
senators and presidents and we can help them by contributing to
their campaigns, what's wrong with that?''
   Congress produced for dairy farmers in the drought bill,
canceling a cut in price supports of 50 cents for each 100 pounds
of milk and imposing instead a temporary, three-month increase of
50 cents per hundredweight.
   Critics also often grumble that campaign contributions are vital
in helping sugar producers to maintain import restrictions that
raise prices considerably for American consumers.
   ``There's little question that campaign contributions have
sweetened the pot of support for the sugar program in Congress,''
says Ellen Haas, executive director of Washington-based Public
Voice for Food and Health Policy.
   She noted in a report issued in 1986 that on a key vote to ease
import curbs 263 members voting against the measure had received
received a total of $743,021 in campaign funds from 18 sugar-grower
organizations over the previous four years. The 142 voting to lift
restrictions had reaped only $85,300 in such contributions.
   Votes on the auction block? Nonsense, farm lawmakers say.
   ``It's totally absurd and insulting, really, to those of us who
have been friends of the sugar industry,'' says House Agriculture
Committee Chairman E. ``Kika'' de la Garza, D-Texas, some of whose
homefolks are cane producers.
   ``If I have to choose between the Rio Grande Valley and some
foreign country, you can imagine which one I'll choose,'' he adds.
   Reagan administration efforts since then to budge sugar tariffs,
however, have come to nought.
   ``Nothing has happened with our bill,'' says Richard W.
Goldberg, acting undersecretary of agriculture for international
activities and commodity programs. ``There's just insufficient
support to get it moving.''
   He says the reason is that so many Agriculture Committee members
have sugar producers in their district and almost all of them have
constituents who grow corn _ whose price is closely linked to that
of sugar.
   ``They kind of help each other,'' says Goldberg.

<HEAD>A Vision Shared: Woody Guthrie, Leadbelly Tribute Record</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARY CAMPBELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   He was the spiritual father of American folk
music, an artist with a social consciousness who captured the
hopes, dreams, joys and sorrows of a nation in such political
anthems and protest songs as ``This Land Is Your Land.''
   His name was Woody Guthrie, and he inspired generations of
singers and composers, including Pete Seeger, Bob Dylan and his
son, Arlo Guthrie.
   But if Guthrie was the spiritual daddy of folk music, then
Leadbelly (Huddie Ledbetter) was its granddaddy.
   The two heroes who carved a music for the common people are
celebrated on a new album, ``Folkways: A Vision Shared,'' subtitled
``A Tribute to Woody Guthrie and Leadbelly.''
   The album, the brainchild of Bob Dylan, features performances of
Guthrie and Leadbelly's work by such artists as Dylan, Seeger,
Bruce Springsteen, Arlo Guthrie, U2, Little Richard, John Cougar
Mellencamp, Willie Nelson, Sweet Honey in the Rock, Emmylou Harris
and Taj Mahal.
   Royalties from the LP will be donated to the Smithsonian
Institution which bought Folkways Records last year from the estate
of its founder, Moses Asch. The Birch Tree Group of Princeton,
N.J., now manages marketing and distribution. Folkways was a label
that championed folk music and its stars and is perhaps the most
complete library of folk music in existence.
   Asch, son of novelist Sholem Asch, founded the Folkways label in
1947 with recordings of Leadbelly and such country-blues musicians
as Jack Dupree, Big Bill Broonzy, Sonny Terry and Brown McGhee.
``Mo'' Asch, who died in 1986 at the age of 81, was interested in
documenting traditional music and sounds from around the world.
   Folkways recorded Guthrie and Seeger as well as jazz,
Appalachian music, gospel, spoken words _ speeches, poetry and
plays, children's songs, ragtime, environmental sounds _ from
street noises to the conversation of frogs, and traditional music
from around the world. Asch produced more than 2,100 records during
his 50-year career and tried to keep them all available for sale to
the general public and as a reference resource for scholars.
   Showtime will air a special about the project on Sept. 17, with
footage from some of the recording sessions and an interview with
Springsteen, who often includes a Guthrie song or two in his
concerts. In October, ``A Vision Shared'' will go on sale in video
stores.
   Springsteen sings ``I Ain't Got No Home'' and ``Vigilante Man,''
both written by Guthrie. Brian Wilson sings Leadbelly's ``Goodnight
Irene.'' Dylan sings Guthrie's ``Pretty Boy Floyd.''
   Dylan was fascinated by Guthrie from the first time he ever
heard one of his records growing up in Minnesota. He visited
Guthrie in the hospital during his last days, and cheered the
composer by singing his songs to him. Guthrie died at Creedmoor
State Hospital in New York in 1967 at the age of 55 following a
13-year battle with Huntington's Chorea.
   Dylan wrote a Guthrie-style talking blues for his first record
album. When the Smithsonian bought Folkways, which included
recordings by Guthrie (1912-1967) and Leadbelly (1885-1949), plus
the Woody Guthrie Archives, it was suggested to Dylan that he give
a benefit concert to help pay for it. He suggested more might by
raised by a recording.
   Joe McEwen, artists and repertory director at Columbia Records
and one of four executive producers of ``A Vision Shared,''
recently talked about the significance of the record.
   ``I think the fact that these songs can still be translated into
the 1980s shows that this music, its passions and experiences, are
universal,'' he said. ``The fact that contemporary artists are
interpreting these songs shows they're still as vital today as when
originally written.
   ``These are great American folk songs, part of a tradition that
will always be with us. I think it's encumbent upon us to keep
reinvestigating this tradition.''
   McEwen couldn't predict how the LP, released Aug. 23, would sell.
   The executive producers made a list of some 40 performers _
giving no preference to those signed to Columbia Records _ to be
invited to perform.
   ``Dylan had done his song. That gave the project some
credibility,'' McEwen said. Most artists chose the songs they
performed. Executive producers made sure they didn't duplicate and
sometimes suggested tunes.
   ```This Land Is Your Land' was obviously designated for Pete
Seeger from the beginning. And `Rock Island Line' seemed to make a
lot of sense for Little Richard. It sounded like his kind of song.''
   Doc Watson plays guitar with Seeger, who sometimes performed on
the same bill with Guthrie and Leadbelly in his youth and, at 69,
continues to sing songs by both of them. The Los Angeles rock
group, Fishbone, performs with Little Richard.
   ``We wanted a real cross-section of different styles of music. I
think we achieved that,'' said McEwen.
   Asking performers and getting responses was quick, he said, so
fast that there wasn't time to take volunteers. Performers and
their own producers then went into recording studios around the
country during a year and a half. U2, the Irish superstars and only
non-American participants, used the Sun studios in Memphis, Tenn.,
during an American tour.
   The general idea in recording, McEwen says, was ``simplicity _
to maintain the integrity of the original sound while doing a
personal interpretation.
   ``Brian Wilson's `Goodnight Irene' doesn't sound like
Leadbelly's. It's probably the most different from the original, on
the album.''
   McEwen has been asked why there isn't one cut each by Guthrie
and Leadbelly. ``I didn't think of it and it was never brought up
in conversations any of us had,'' he said.
   ``I think the Smithsonian is doing a record of the original
versions of these same songs.''

<TEXT>
   With a cease-fire in place, Iran and
Iraq can turn to rebuilding their war-damaged oil industries,
raising the prospect of a fresh surge in oil production and a fal
in crude prices, some analysts say.
   But others argue the newly enacted truce will help bring an end
to squabbles within the Arab-dominated Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries, enabling the oil cartel to strengthen its grip
on world markets.
   ``If OPEC is politically stronger than it was during the war,
then its capacity for controlling oil prices will be stronger
also,'' said Pierre Terzian, editor of the Paris-based oil
publication, Petrostrategies.
   This past week, Subroto, the secretary-general of the cartel,
capped off a series of meetings with oil producers by visiting
officials in both Iran and Iraq. The aim of the meetings was to win
cooperation in curbing production by OPEC members to bolster
sagging prices.
   Although the meetings produced no immediate results, Subroto
promised to continue his search for a solution to the cartel's
overproduction problems.
   Terzian predicted prices would firm in the coming months in the
range of $16 to $18 a barrel. OPEC's target price is pegged at $18
a barrel, but prices on the spot market have been running $3 to $4
below that level.
   London oil consultant Paul McDonald, however, looks for prices
to slide in a market already awash in crude.
   ``The pressure is going to be on Iran and Iraq to produce more
oil because they need more money,'' he said.
   ``A cease-fire means increased oil production,'' said Peter
Gignoux, director of the international energy department at the
Shearson Lehman Hutton brokerage in London.
   Iraq already plans to expand its export capacity with a new
pipeline through Saudi Arabia to the Red Sea.
   ``They're planning to export more oil,'' McDonald said.
``They're not building the ... pipeline for fun. They're going to
use it.''
   A key to controlling any increased production, analysts said, is
OPEC's ability to bring Iraq back into the fold of the 13-nation
cartel.
   Iraq has in the past ignored its OPEC production quota of 1.54
million barrels a day, demanding a share equal to Iran's 2.37
million barrels a day. Iraq pumps an estimated 2.8 million barrels
a day in defiance of the quotas, analysts say.
   In his meetings, Subroto tried to persuade Iran to allow Iraq a
higher quota.
   ``There's no longer any obstacle for Iraq to get back in the
quota system,'' said Terzian.
   Nick Antill, oil analyst with the London brokerage County
NatWest, said, ``If Iraq can be reintegrated on quota parity with
Iran, there's no real reason why prices can't be manipulated up''
to OPEC's $18 a barrel target.
   The 8-year Persian Gulf war caused widespread damage to the two
countries' oil industries.
   Petro-Logistics, a Geneva-based oil consulting firm, estimated
war damage to Iraq's oil facilities at $8.5 billion and destruction
to Iran's operations at $25 billion.
   Both countries are turning out oil well under their pre-war
highs of about 6 million barrels a day for Iran in 1974 and 3.5
million barrels a day for Iraq in 1979.
   Petro-Logistics estimates Iran could boost production to 3.2
million barrels a day in a year and to 4.2 million barrels in five
years. Iraq's output could climb to 3.7 million barrels a day by
mid-1989 and 5 million barrels in 1993, it said.
   During the war, Iraq, aided by money from its gulf neighbors,
built pipelines through Saudi Arabia and Turkey to carry out its
export oil, bypassing war-ravaged facilities on the gulf.
   ``Iran is likely to face a much tougher task than Iraq in
boosting its post-war output and production capacity,'' said
Petro-Logistics.
   ``Some major onshore fields have been irreparably damaged over
the past 10 years due to mature age, neglect and war damage,'' it
said.
   ``They've probably lost billions of barrels of reserves,'' said
McDonald.
   Kharg Island, Iran's key tanker terminal in the Persian Gulf,
was badly pounded by Iraq's powerful air force as were refining
facilities and oilfields.
   Indeed, Iran, which once exported refined oil products, was
forced to turn to other countries to meet its internal demand.
   ``It's an oil-rich society that cannot refine its own internal
needs,'' said Gignoux.
   With the war winding down, the two countries must decide whether
to restore their oil industries to their pre-war might.
   ``If they want to go back to what they were, that will require
billions and billions of dollars of investments in the coming
years,'' said Terzian.
   ``They will have the financial ability,'' he said. ``They have
the technical ability. Foreign service companies are eager to get
contracts. ... There is a golden opportunity for them in Iran and
Iraq.''

<TEXT>
   In other business and economic news this past week:
   _The government reported statistics that suggested the economy
is slowing down, easing fears of inflation in the financial
markets. Unemployment in August rose to 5.6 percent; new home sales
in July suffered the steepest drop in seven months; July factory
orders fell 3.5 percent; and the July Index of Leading Indicators,
an important forecasting gauge, fell 0.8 percent. On the other
hand, Agriculture Department figures showing a 2.1 percent rise in
farm prices in July, partly caused by the drought, suggested
inflation is rising. And quarterly productivity dropped for the
first time in two years.
   _The nation's largest retailers reported another depressed sales
performance for August, which industry analysts blamed on
abnormally hot weather and widespread dissatisfaction with the
latest women's fashions.
   _Two well-known entrepreneurs agreed to merge their companies in
a $1.65 billion deal expected to create a major force in the
financial services industry. The agreement between Commercial
Credit Group Inc. Chairman Sanford Weill and Primerica Corp.
Chairman Gerald Tsai is expected to help resurrect Primerica's
struggling brokerage subsidiary, Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Co.
   _Elsewhere in corporate takeovers, it was relatively quiet,
although a few significant developments were announced. Nippon
Mining Co. of Japan said it would acquire debt-laden electronics
maker Gould Inc. for $1.1 billion; Resorts International Inc.
stockholders approved entertainer Merv Griffin's offer to buy the
gaming and real estate company; Banca Commerciale Italiana SpA
withdrew its friendly bid for Irving Bank Corp. because of a
regulatory hurdle; and Macmillan Inc., target of an unsolicited
$2.34 billion offer from Maxwell Commications Corp., said it had
discussed a takeover of part or all of the company with the British
concern.
   _The airline industry was battered by a deadly accident, labor
hostility, security lapses and conflict over alleged abuse of
frequent-flier mileage bonuses. A Delta Air Lines jet crashed in
Dallas; financially troubled Eastern Airlines faced a legal battle
over its attempt to lay off 4,000 workers; Trans World Airlines
flight attendants sought a government inquiry into Chairman Carl
Icahn's fitness to run the carrier; the government fined 32
airlines more than $1 million for faulty passenger screening
procedures; and American Airlines sued discount travel agents to
halt what it called the improper bartering of frequent flier
coupons that is costing many airlines millions of dollars.
   _Alleged and real ethical lapses in business kept making news. A
federal judge in Chicago sentenced two former bank officers to
prison for contributing to the near-collapse of Continental
Illinois National Bank & Trust Co. in the early 1980s; Pacemaker
manufacturer Cordis Corp. pleaded guilty to concealing thousands of
defective units, and four former executives were indicted; and a
class-action suit was filed against the Chicago Board Options
Exchange and some of its traders, accusing them of overcharging
more than 1,000 investors who lost at least $40 million the day
after the Oct. 19 stock market collapse.
   _The Energy Department approved an agreement with Texaco Inc.
calling for $1.25 billion in payments to the government over 5{
years to settle accusations of overcharging for price-controlled
crude oil. The settlement approved Monday is the second largest
behind a $2.1 billion settlement with Exxon Corp. in the
government's long campaign to recover overcharges in the years from
1973 to 1981, when crude oil was subject to price controls.
   _Federal regulators took control of 14 failing savings
institutions in Oklahoma and pledged up to $1.9 billion in aid to
restore the state's savings industry.
   _A federal law guaranteeing customers of banks, savings
associations and credit unions timely access to money they deposit
by check took effect, though confusion arose about some of the
changes in the new law.
   _International Business Machines Corp. fired its longtime ad
agency, which created the campaigns that featured a Charlie
Chaplin-lookalike and the characters from the ``M-A-S-H''
television series. The decision was the latest blow to Lord Geller
Federico Einstein Inc., which is losing its biggest client and has
been wracked by internal turmoil for much of the year.

<HEAD>Market Cheered by Signs of Slower Economic Growth</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The bond market is getting a powerful lift from
signs that the pace of economic growth is slowing, but some
analysts worry that a decline in the dollar could spoil the party.
   The government's report on Friday that the nation's civilian
unemployment rate jumped to 5.6 percent in August from 5.4 percent
in July was the catalyst for one of the bond market's most forceful
rallies of the year.
   What heartened the market was not so much the widely-anticipated
increase in the unemployment rate but the accompanying statistics
that indicated a slowdown in new job creation and little if any
increase in wages.
   Trading volume in the bond market had slowed to trickle in
advance of the report as some bond dealers suspected it would
confirm their worst fears _ that the economy was growing so rapidly
that it would ignite inflation and force the Federal Reserve to
restrain it.
   But the report had only pleasant surprises for many bond
analysts.
   By midafternoon Friday, prices of some 30-year Treasury bonds
were up about $25 for every $1,000 in face value. That gain was the
biggest since a $26 per $1,000 in face value rise on Jan. 15, the
market's best day of 1988.
   The price rise trimmed yields on the 30-year issue, often viewed
as an indication of broader interest rate trends. At midafternoon,
the 30-year bond yielded 9.05 percent, down from 9.30 percent late
Thursday and from 9.43 percent at the end of trading in the
previous week.
   Some analysts said the unemployment report may mark a turning
point from which interest rates will trend lower through the end of
the year.
   Elliott Platt, director of fixed-income research for Donaldson
Lufkin & Jenrette Securities Corp., said, ``There is a very good
chance that rates have peaked.''
   Platt said the trade deficit contraction and business spending
on equipment are slowing. He noted that earlier this past week the
government reported a 0.8 percent decline in its leading indicators
index for July and a 3.5 percent drop in manufacturing orders to
factories. He said the unemployment report ``suggests that the
slowdown may be here.''
   He expects long-term yields will sink to 8.5 percent by yearend.
   But many economists say it is too early to call a turning point
in rate trends and expect rates will head higher.
   Harold Nathan, senior financial economist at Wells Fargo & Co.
in San Francisco, said he expects long-term yields could reach 10
percent by the end of the year and 10.5 percent next year.
   Nathan said the unemployment report ``showed some weakness in
the labor markets that we have not seen in some time,'' but added
it does not reflect a sharp economic slowdown.
   ``We are growing at a more sustainable but strong pace of
activity. The bottom line is that there is still enough strength to
put inflationary pressures on the economy,'' he said.
   Sung Won Sohn, chief economist for Norwest Corp. in Minneapolis,
said the unemployment report takes pressure off the Fed to push up
short-term rates.
   But he said the economy ``is still doing fairly well'' and as a
result feels ``this is a temporary pause, not a peak, in interest
rates.''
   Sohn said foreign central banks have raised their interest rates
by much more than the U.S. central bank has this year, and that the
dollar will probably come under pressure because of that.
   A declining dollar could reduce foreign demand for securities
denominated in dollars such as Treasury notes and bonds. That could
result in increasing pressure to raise rates to find buyers for the
issues.
   Sohn expects 30-year bond yields of 10 percent by the end of the
year.
   William V. Sullivan Jr., director of money market research for
Dean Witter Reynolds Inc., said he thinks it is too early to say if
the unemployment report marks a turning point for the credit
markets.
   ``If the dollar plunges in reaction to signs of an economic
slowdown it is possible that the bond market has to give up some of
these gains,'' he said.
   In the meantime, he said he expects bond professionals are
``reconsidering their exposures'' just in case the slowdown turns
out to be lasting.

<HEAD>Cocoa Glut Lends Crisis Tone To International Meeting</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Will be followed later in session with an ADD containing
weekly price trends</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Commodity traders are betting on a breakdown of the glutted
cocoa market's sputtering price-support machine as the 38
nation-members of the International Cocoa Organization prepare for
two weeks of talks in London.
   With cocoa prices at 12-year lows, supplies at an all-time high
and the world's top producer threatening to pull out of the
price-support agreement, a crisis atmosphere likely will prevail at
Monday's opening session of the ICCO's semi-annual meeting,
analysts said.
   Blend in the ICCO secretariat's recommendation to suspend levies
on cocoa sales _ the primary financial support of the
producer-consumer cooperative _ and ``things are looking pretty
awful'' for cocoa bulls, said Sandra Kaul, cocoa market analyst
with Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. in New York.
   ``There are expectations that these meetings are going to break
down, that they will come up with no new means of price support and
that they are going to suspend the call for producer levies,'' she
said.
   Cocoa prices generally have been falling since early 1984, when
it became apparent that production during the October
1983-September 1984 crop year would significantly exceed demand.
   The surplus has risen each year since then. Arthur Stevenson,
cocoa market analyst with Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.,
estimated that world cocoa stocks on Sept. 30, the end of the
current crop year, will stand at 705,000 metric tons, compared with
594,000 metric tons last year.
   Stocks are expected to increase to nearly 900,000 metric tons,
an all-time high, in the upcoming crop year, he said. A metric ton
is about 2,205 pounds.
   ``That is a massive, massive burden overhanging the market,''
Stevenson said in a telephone interview. Cocoa consumption,
meanwhile, ``has been going up only very slowly,'' he said.
   The surplus has weighed heavily on prices. The price for
near-month delivery of cocoa on New York's Coffee, Sugar & Cocoa
Exchange has fallen from about $2,800 a metric ton in early January
1984 to $1,202 on Friday.
   The drop in cocoa prices has had little impact on chocolate-bar
prices because cocoa is a relatively small ingredient in chocolate
confections, Stevenson said. Candy bar prices also reflect
manufacturers' costs for milk, sugar, packaging and marketing.
   Besides, Stevenson said, ``if people eat one chocolate bar a
week, they're not going to start eating five chocolate bars a week
because prices are marginally lower.''
   Yet cocoa-growing countries keep increasing their output, hoping
to make up for lower prices by selling more.
   The ICCO is supposed to help support prices by buying surplus
cocoa and keeping it off the market in a ``buffer stock.'' But the
current ICCO agreement, which began in 1987 and runs through
September 1990, limits the buffer stock to 250,000 metric tons and
it is already at that level, Stevenson said.
   Even if ICCO members should agree to increase the buffer-stock
limit, the organization would still be strapped for cash with which
to buy the cocoa.
   The agreement requires cocoa-producing countries to pay the ICCO
a $30 levy on every ton of cocoa they export. But the largest
producers, including the Ivory Coast and Brazil, have stopped
paying the levies.
   Producers owe the ICCO about $70 million in levies, of which at
least $48 million is owed by the Ivory Coast, analysts said.
   The ICCO secretariat has proposed to do away with the levies, a
suggestion that will be debated at the London meeting. But analysts
say the secretariat's proposed alternative _ selling some of the
buffer-stock cocoa to finance ICCO operations _ would only drive
prices down further and exacerabte the problem.
   Stevenson said some producer nations have suggested that all
producers withhold some cocoa from the market to drive up prices.
That idea is not likely to fly, he said, because it is opposed by
other producers, including No. 2 Brazil.
   The Ivory Coast is the world's top cocoa producer. Last year, it
produced 590,000 metric tons of cocoa, or 29 percent of the world
supply.
   This past week, Ivory Coast officials reportedly said the ICCO
was dying and that unless solutions to the market's dilemmas were
found, it would withdraw from the ICCO at the end of the current
agreement.
   But analysts saw no easy solutions.
   ``The ICCO agreement simply cannot circumvent supply-demand
realties,'' Stevenson said. ``The agreement does not have control
where it is most needed. It cannot cut back on production, nor can
it boost consumption.''

^Purchasing Managers Say Growth Slowed In August</NOTE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The economy's vigorous growth slowed in August,
but new orders remained high enough to assure robust growth through
the third quarter, the nation's purchasing managers said in a
report released Monday.
   The Purchasing Manager's Index slipped to 56.2 in August from
59.0 in July and a yearly peak of 59.3 in June, the National
Association of Purchasing Management said.
   An index above 50 percent generally indicates an economy is
expanding.
   If the August level continued for the rest of the year, it would
be consistent with economic growth of 3.7 percent, said Robert
Bretz, chairman of the organization's Business Survey Committee.
   The purchasing managers' report is closely watched by economists
because it gives solid clues to the direction of the economy. In a
change this month, the report includes indexes for each of six
specific economic indicators as well as the composite index.
   New orders expanded for the 39th consecutive month, but less
rapidly. The index fell to 59.9 from 62.1 in July and a peak of
62.7 in June.
   Production expanded for the 25th consecutive month, taking
seasonal factors into consideration, but the index was down sharply
to 58.2 from 62.7 in July and 63.1 in June.
   Deliveries by vendors slowed, but the rate of slowing was less
than reported in previous months. The proportion of members
reporting faster deliveries, 7 percent, was the highest since May
1987. Slow deliveries are a sign that suppliers can't keep up with
strong demand. The index fell to 58.1 from 58.8 in July.
   Inventories fell in August after rising in July, considering
seasonal factors. The index fell to 48.6 from 55.1 in July.
   Prices rose, but there was a hint that the rate of increase may
be slowing. The index fell to 78.7 from 81.1 in July and was the
lowest since 74.1 in March. Slowing increases in metals were offset
by rapid increases for farm products caused by the drought.
   Employment increased, considering seasonal factors, for the
third consecutive month after three months of decline. The index
fell to 50.7 from 51.7 in July.
   On buying policies, purchasing managers ordered production
materials farther ahead of time to cope with the slowdown in vendor
deliveries. Lead times of 30 days or less for production materials
were reported by 51 percent of purchasers, down from 56 percent in
July.
   Lead times were about the same for capital expenditures and
somewhart shorter for maintenance, repair and operating supplies.
   The report is based on surveys of purchasing executives in more
than 250 industrial companies in 21 industries in all 50 states.
The organization has nearly 30,000 members.

   Wall Streeters are hoping for some extra cause
to celebrate with the arrival of the traditional ``business New
Year'' at Labor Day.
   First of all, they would like to see investors and traders, back
from the diversions of summer, helping to pick up the tempo from
the anemic pace of activity in recent weeks.
   In addition, they see some preliminary signs of relief from the
constant talk lately of too-rapid economic growth, revived
inflation and credit-tightening by the Federal Reserve.
   Spirits in the financial community got a big boost on Friday
when the Labor Department reported slower-than-expected employment
growth for August, and revised downward its figure for July as
well. Both the stock and bond markets responded quickly with strong
gains.
   That, of course, put traders in the familiar but still awkward
position of seeming to applaud an increase in the unemployment
rate, in this case to 5.6 percent in August from 5.4 percent in
July.
   But the standard interpretation of the data among financial
analysts was that it signaled moderating growth in the economy and
less cause to worry about inflation.
   Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve, has made clear
with both words and action his concern of late that inflationary
pressures were building.
   Moves by the Fed to restrain those pressures by tightening
credit conditions have produced a steady increase in short-term
interest rates.
   In the view of many analysts, the new employment data raise the
possibility that the central bank won't feel obliged to tighten
credit any further at least through the November elections.
   The latest evidence ``suggests the current structure of
short-term rates is too high,'' said Tom Carpenter, chief economist
at ASB Capital Management in Washington.
   ``A couple more months of moderate earnings gains should cause
short rates to go down.''
   Joseph Feshbach, an analyst at Prudential-Bache Securities,
argues that ``September should cool off the bond market's
overheated anxieties.
   ``I believe that before the year is out we'll see a very sharp
bond rally as it becomes evident that the fear of inflation has
been blown out of all proportion,'' he said in a commentary
published before Friday's report.
   Thanks to the rally on Friday, the Dow Jones average of 30
industrials finished the past week with a net gain of 37.16 points
at 2,054.59.
   The New York Stock Exchange composite index rose 2.42 to 149.66;
the NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market gained
2.08 to 376.51, and the American Stock Exchange market value index
was up 1.75 at 295.62.
   Volume on the Big Board averaged 128.48 million shares a day, up
from 117.29 million the week before.
   ``The rise in interest rates here and overseas should eventually
begin to cool demand,'' says David Resler, chief economist at
Nomura Securities International in New York.
   ``So far, available data suggest that the late second-quarter
surge in demand may have subsided a bit.''
   Resler also noted that while U.S. and European policymakers have
been moving to head off inflation, those in Japan haven't felt the
need to do so.
   ``Even though the Japanese economy is growing rapidly, the Bank
of Japan has given no hint that it intends to raise its discount
rate.''
   The 0.5 percent increase reported for the Japanese consumer
price index over the past year, Resler added, ``serves as a
reminder that there is nothing INHERENTLY inflationary about strong
growth.''

   Energy futures prices finished sharply lower, as
traders continued to react negatively to reports of a worldwide oil
glut.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, contracts for October
delivery of West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark U.S. crude oil,
fell 29 cents per 42-gallon barrel to close at $14.79 Friday. Other
contract months also dropped.
   Analysts said the near-month contracts for crude oil slid to
seven-week lows Friday, breaking a key support level of $15.10 a
barrel, and dragging other contract months down.
   Contracts for refined petroleum products also finished down
sharply. Wholesale unleaded gasoline for October delivery fell 0.73
cent to finish at 43.98 cents a gallon. Contracts for other months
also lost ground.
   Wholesale heating oil for October declined 0.58 cent to 42.88
cents a gallon while other contract months also declined.
   Analysts said the market eroded steadily all week after reports
that some members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries were continuing to ignore production quotas, increasing
the world's oil supply and further weakening prices.
   ``The market continued to fall under pressure primarily on news
that OPEC is continuing to overproduce,'' said Richard Redoglia, a
trader with Merrill Lynch Energy Futures. ``The fact that the
market reacted to new contract lows is not a good sign.''
   Reports this week indicated that the United Arab Emirates and
Iraq are exceeding their OPEC quotas by several million barrels a
day.
   Analysts said that uncertaintly over the outcome of this week's
talks among OPEC Secretary-General Subroto and several OPEC members
over cutting production also pushed the market down.
   ``What weighed on the market were failure of Subroto to secure
an agreement between Iran and Iraq to share equal quotas, and two
reports of contintued high OPEC production ... and no sign of a
cutback in September,'' said Andrew Lebow, senior broker and
analyst at E.D.&F. Man International Futures Inc.
   Some analysts said that Friday's higher U.S. unemployment
figures indicating a possible economic slowdown also affected the
oil markets.

   A setback for job seekers was good news for
investors as a rise in the unemployment rate eased inflation fears
and sent stock and bond prices sharply higher.
   The Labor Department's report Friday of a rise in the civilian
jobless rate to 5.6 percent in August stirred the biggest rise in
the Treasury bond and note market since Oct. 22, a few days after
the stock market crash.
   The higher jobless rate calmed a market that has been worried
for months that the economy was growing too quickly and might go
into an inflationary spiral.
   ``It's bad news, I guess, for job searchers, but it's not
necessarily bad news for consumers in general,'' said George
Iwanicki, an associate economist for Kidder, Peabody & Co.
   Stock prices leaped and the Dow Jones average of 30 industrial
stocks rose 52.28 points to 2,054.59, its biggest increase since a
74.68-point gain on May 31.
   The rise of more than 50 points triggered a restriction on
member firms' use of computers for a form of program trading. The
restrictions were designed to avoid chaotic swings in stock prices.
   While the overall Treasury market had its biggest rise of 1988,
the Treasury's closely watched 30-year bond staged its
second-biggest rally of the year.
   The price of the Treasury's 30-year bond rose $25.90 per $1,000
face amount, driving its yield down to 9.04 from 9.30 percent late
Thursday. The only bigger rally of 1988 was a $26.25 price increase
on Jan. 15, after the government reported a big drop in the trade
deficit.
   The bond market is highly sensitive to inflation and takes
weaker growth as good news. When bond prices rose, investors moved
to the stock market in search of bargains.
   In the long run, a slight increase in joblessness could mean
more stable, prolonged growth, said David Bennett, a market analyst
at Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.
   In spite of the uptick in the jobless rate, from 5.4 percent in
July and a 14-year low of 5.3 percent in May, the economy continues
to be expanding and the nation is not far from full employment,
Iwanicki said.
   ``Fundamentally, the economy is quite strong,'' said Helen
Hotchkiss, a senior economist at Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.
   Analysts said the slight increase in the jobless level eases
pressure on the Federal Reserve to move before the election to
raise its discount rate, which is the interest rate it charges on
loans to member banks.
