   Starting New Year's Day, new state laws impose harsher penalties
on drunken drivers, allow certain convicts to serve sentences at
home, increase AIDS testing and designate not one, but two official
dances in California.
   In California alone, 1,659 new laws and voter-approved
initiatives take effect Sunday, including naming the Square Dance
and the West Coast Swing Dance, a.k.a. the jitterbug, as official
dances.
   California's cigarette tax goes up a hefty 25 cents per pack as a
result of an initiative appproved by voters in November despite
heavily financed opposition from the tobacco lobby. Proceeds will go
toward promoting health.
   States such as Rhode Island and California will implement laws
expected to increase testing for the AIDS virus.
   Rhode Island's new statute requires testing of convicts and of
prostitutes and intravenous drug users who are arrested. The state
also will offer voluntary AIDS tests to, among others, hospital
patients, marriage license applicants and prenatal-care patients.
   In California, doctors may disclose a patient's positive AIDS
antibody test results to other health care providers without written
consent. And a new law makes it a felony for an AIDS victim aware of
his illness to donate blood or commit a sex-related crime.
   Both Illinois and California will start allowing certain
non-violent convicts to serve part or all of their sentences at
home. Inmates will be monitored electronically.
   Gasoline taxes rise a penny in South Carolina, and two cents in
Iowa and Oregon.
   Four Arkansas communities make state history with new laws
allowing Sunday sales of mixed drinks: Little Rock, North Little
Rock, Garland County and Wiederkehr Village.
   Those caught drunk behind the wheel in some states face stiff new
sanctions. New Year's revelers in Illinois arrested for drunken
driving will have their cars impounded by police for up to six hours
even if the driver has posted bond.
   ``Before this law change, there was no provision putting brakes
on a violator getting his car back,'' said Sgt. Charles Schwarting,
spokesman for the Illinois State Police.
   South Carolina's Highway Safety Act doubles fines for drunken
driving and requires police to confiscate the vehicles of repeat
offenders.
   In California, drunken drivers can be billed up to $1,000 by the
California Highway Patrol for the cost of responding to accidents
caused by their driving. And teens convicted of alcohol- or
drug-related crimes could lose their driver's licenses.
   New York State will begin restricting beer sales at sports arenas
including Yankee and Shea stadiums and Madison Square Garden.
   In Kansas, county clerks will no longer have to squint over fine
print now that the Legislature is requiring all state documents to
be printed in type no smaller than eight point, the type size of
typical newspaper text.
   Litterbugs in Illinois face stiffer penalties after New Year's:
six months in jail instead of 30 days.
   And starting Sunday, Missourians will pay state and local sales
taxes on video rentals, with proceeds to go toward satellite
equipment for educational broadcasts to schools.
   ``It will be nice that we'll finally get some educational benefit
from Rambo III,'' said the law's sponsor, state Sen. Jay Nixon.
   Among other state law changes:
   _ Illinois parents ordered to pay child support face automatic
payroll withholding.
   _ Louisiana gets a tough new campaign finance law limiting
individual and political action committee contributions for the
first time.
   _ California parents of suspended students may be required to
spend time attending the child's school. And to curb drug sales at
schools, a new law prohibits students from carrying paging beepers
except for health reasons.
   _ New York lawmakers' salaries will rise 34 percent, from $43,000
to $57,500, making them the highest paid in the nation.
   _ Psychotherapy patients in Illinois will be able for the first
time to sue therapists to recover damages for sexual exploitation.
   _ A ``returnable pet law'' takes effect in New York. If a
veterinarian certifies that a cat or dog purchased at retail is
unfit, its owner can return it or receive reimbursement for
veterinary care.
   _ California department stores will be able to charge any
interest they want on installment accounts or credit cards until
1992, but can no longer charge annual fees for their cards.
   _ In Florida, a strengthened ``lemon law'' on defective cars sets
up state-run arbitration boards in eight cities to hear appeals from
consumers.
   _ In Connecticut, the state will have the power to withhold and
pay child support and alimony payments from lottery winnings under
specified circumstances.
   _ Washington stateraises its minimum wage from $2.30 to $3.85 as
a result of a voter initiative passed in November.
   _ New York will become the first state to keep track of
prescriptions of Valium, Librium and other tranquilizers in order to
identify doctors who may be overprescribing them.
   _ In Massachusetts, a major auto insurance reform bill could mean
about $200 million in savings for motorists who pay among the
nation's highest premiums.
   _ A new California law bans manufacture and sale of plastic guns,
unless they show up on X-ray machines at airports and other security
detectors. A second California statute imposes $10,000 civil
penalties for making or selling realistic toy guns.

<HEAD>Plaque Marking Brezhnev's Residence Removed</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A plaque marking the apartment house where Leonid
I. Brezhnev lived for 30 years was removed on Kremlin orders in the
latest blow at the legacy of the disgraced Soviet leader.
   The plaque _ which called Brezhnev a distinguished figure of the
Soviet Communist Party, the Soviet government and the world
socialist and workers' movements _ was hanging on the building at 26
Kutuzovsky Prospekt when the Kremlin issued its directive Thursday
evening.
   By Friday morning it had been removed, leaving only a blank wall
outside the sand-colored apartment building.
   ``They took it away in the middle of the night. I thought they
would,'' said an elderly woman who paused to look at the wall.
   ``They did the right thing,'' said the woman, who did not want to
be identified.
   The Kremlin decree ordered that everything still named after
Brezhnev and former leader Konstantin U. Chernenko be renamed
because the two were responsible for a period of stagnation and
corruption. It ordered that plaques marking the homes of both
leaders be taken down.
   Brezhnev ruled for 18 years before he died in 1982. After his
death a city, streets, city squares and state-run enterprises were
named after him. Soviet officials started removing those names in
January.
   Brezhnev was succeeded by Yuri V. Andropov, mentor of Soviet
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev. Andropov lived in the same apartment
building as did Brezhnev, and a plaque in his memory remained on the
building Friday.
   Chernenko ruled for 13 months between Andropov and Gorbachev, and
was ill much of the time.
   The TV news program ``Vremya'' said a city in the republic of
Moldavia and another in the Krasnoyarsk region of Siberia that had
been named for Chernenko would be rechristened.

   The 1988 business year was like the season after
a television cliffhanger: The plot twists that followed last year's
stock market crash never matched Black Monday for dramatic effect.
   Those expecting to see recession, bread lines and massive
business failures in the wake of the October 1987 crash were proved
dead wrong.
   Like Bobby Ewing on TV's ``Dallas,'' the market emerged from the
shower alive and well.
   But for some in the business world, the nightmare continued in
1988. Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. was finally charged with
securities fraud in the government's ongoing Wall Street probe; RJR
Nabisco Inc.'s chief executive Ross Johnson tried and failed to pull
off the biggest leveraged buyout in history; and Japanese officials
learned what it was like to feel the heat of an insider trading
crackdown.
   While there was more than enough grist to run the business mill
in the year just ended, good news was certainly in short supply.
   Scores of savings and loans were added to the ranks of the
insolvent; retailers suffered through the second year of a sales
slump; the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries threatened
to end consumers' love affair with low oil prices; and the dollar
sagged again in foreign exchange trading.
   The market, for all its resilience, was only a shadow of its
former bullish self. The Dow Jones industrial average of blue chips
finished well below its pre-crash peak, and remained mostly
uninspired by the election of Republican George Bush to succeed
President Reagan as the champion of free enterprise.
   Still, there were high points. The Baby Bells turned 5 years old,
and the nation celebrated increased choice and higher technology in
the unfettered telecommunications field.
   Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev embraced a bit of capitalist
thought _ even fast food _ in an effort to spur his troubled economy.
   Donald Trump, the biggest capitalist of them all, bought Eastern
Airlines' profitable shuttle service for $365 million and promised
to paint his name on the planes.
   Media mogul Rupert Murdoch paid $3 billion to acquire Triangle
Publications and its showcase TV Guide, the most widely read
magazine in the country. Another publishing tycoon, Robert Maxwell
of Britain, succeeded after three tries in acquiring the Macmillan
publishing empire.
   Sophie Mirman, a British secretary turned entrepreneur, brought
socks to the masses with a worldwide chain of Sock Shops and a
rallying call worthy of any ambitious Working Girl: ``I didn't find
the typing pool particularly stimulating,'' she said in an interview
with The Associated Press.
   Indeed, expanding one's horizons was what the year was all about
for those with hefty credit lines. The investment firm Kohlberg
Kravis Roberts & Co., led by master dealmaker Henry Kravis, pulled
the rug out from under Nabisco's Johnson, after the boss made an
admittedly ``low-ball'' offer to take the company private for $17
billion. After weeks of punch and counterpunch, Kravis scored a TKO
with a deal worth nearly $25 billion, the biggest buyout ever.
   Kravis made headlines on the society pages while he was at it, by
keeping an ambitious social schedule along with his fashion designer
wife, Carolyne Roehm. Their jet-set lifestyle on the party circuit
set mouths to watering, but the power couple flatly denied rumors
they pipe the smell of fresh-baked croissants into guest rooms at
their Connecticut estate.
   A host of other names also made news during the year:
   Remington Shavers magnate Victor Kiam liked the New England
Patriots so much that he bought the National Football League
franchise for $85 million.
   New York investor Asher Edelman soured on the American takeover
scene and said he planned to spend most of his time looking for
deals in Europe.
   Canadian Robert Campeau won a tug of war against R.H. Macy & Co.
Inc. for Federated Department Stores Inc. in April. But the victory
cost $8.8 billion, prompting Campeau to sell off some of Federated's
assets and take a multimillion-dollar package of high-yield junk
bonds to market.
   Chicago industrialist William Farley, once a dark horse
presidential hopeful, sought a marriage of towels and underwear by
pursuing a merger of textile giant West-Point Pepperell Inc. with
his Farley Industries, which includes Fruit of the Loom.
   Corporate raider Carl Icahn had a busy year taking Trans World
Airlines Inc. private and increasing his stake in Texaco Inc.
Although he lost a protracted battle to unseat Texaco's harried
management team, Icahn was still banging on the oil giant's pipes at
year's end, nagging management to sell assets and distribute the
proceeds to shareholders like him.
   The biggest, and least expected, coup of the year probably
belonged to Pillsbury Co. Chairman Philip L. Smith, who lost a $5.7
billion takeover battle against Grand Metropolitan PLC but earned a
nifty $8 million for himself for less than four months work at the
helm of the Minneapolis food giant.
   When the British firm takes control of Pillsbury sometime early
in 1989, Smith, who came to Pillsbury from General Foods Corp., will
depart with a small fortune in stock and salary benefits.
   Among those on top of the world, the Japanese remained foremost.
Despite a stock trading scandal that forced the resignations of some
top government and business leaders, Tokyo's equity market hit a
record high on the last trading day of the year.
   In customary fashion, the high-flying traders on the Tokyo
exchange gave themselves a round of applause.

<HEAD>National Computer System Will Track Doctors' Records</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JERRY ESTILL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A record of malpractice suits and disciplinary
actions taken against doctors and dentists will follow them from
state to state as part of a new national computer data bank being
set up by the federal government.
   ``No longer will incompetent health professionals be enabled to
move from hospital to hospital or from state to state while
withholding adverse information,'' Dr. Otis R. Bowen, secretary of
the Department of Health and Human Services, said Friday.
   His remarks came at a news conference announcing the award of a
five-year, $15.9 million contract to the Unisys Corp. to operate the
computer bank ordered by Congress in 1986.
   The system is expected to be up and running by mid-summer, said
Bowen, but it will not contain files of actions taken against health
care providers prior to its start.
   The information will not be available to the general public, but
rather to state licensing boards and employers of medical personnel,
such as hospitals.
   In fact, hospitals will be required to check the data base before
hiring a doctor not known to them and to routinely run their medical
staff's names through the computer every two years.
   The idea is not to create a consumer handbook, but rather an
in-house tool to help the medical profession weed out incompetents.
   That is not enough for one activist, Dr. Sidney Wolfe, who
founded Public Citizen Health Research Group with Ralph Nader.
   ``Congress must amend this legislation to require public
disclosure of this vital publicly-funded information about
incompetent doctors which could save many patients from being taken
`care' of by the small fraction of demonstrably dangerous doctors
still practicing in this country,'' said Wolfe.
   The lead authors of the legislation, on the other hand, praised
their own handiwork and the health department's implementation of it.
   ``With this contract, we will finally have a national system to
keep track of the disciplinary records of licensed health
professionals,'' said Rep. Ron Wyden, D-Ore. ``In the past,
incompetents have been able to slip through the cracks and inflict
poor medical care on the American consumer.''
   Rep. Thomas J. Tauke, R-Iowa, called the contract award ``both an
end and a beginning.''
   ``We are taking the final step on what has been a long and
difficult road to fully implementing'' the legislation, said Tauke.
``We are taking a major step forward in protecting and strengthening
the quality of health care in our nation.''
   The legislation requires state medical licensing authorities to
report all their disciplinary actions to the federal computer file
and also requires the reporting of malpractice suits lodged against
doctors and dentists.
   Eventually, the data bank is to be expanded to include nurses and
any other health care providers that must be licensed in order to
practice their trade.
   Bowen said it would not be fair for the bare-bones material in
the data bank to be directly available to the public in a new
location even though the case might have received extensive
publicity where it originated.
   He said the filing of a malpractice suit, or even a malpractice
judgment, does not necessarily mean a physician is not fully
competent to practice.
   For example, he used the case of a patient with a crushed elbow
and a sharp lawyer.
   ``No matter how good the doctor is and how good a job he does,
you're probably going to have a stiff elbow,'' he said. ``You wave
that in front of a jury and you're (the doctor) probably going to
lose the case.''
   At the same time, Bowen said there are a few incompetent doctors
and that the data base is important because ``we (doctors) need to
be sure we have our own house in order.''

   While well-known economists discussed weighty
topics at a major economics convention this week, the meeting's real
business took place in hotel suites rented by universities.
   There, doctoral students groveled before academic deans and
professors, resumes in hand, trying to line up teaching posts once
they receive their degrees this spring.
   ``Although what the press seems to be covering here are the
meetings themselves, those are really a minor part of what is going
on here,'' said George Daly, dean of the business school at the
University of Iowa.
   ``It's really a labor market,'' Daly said. ``We're all
recruiting.''
   Of the 8,000 people who attended the American Economic
Association convention, 1,500 to 2,000 were seeking jobs, said Elton
Hinshaw, the association's secretary.
   Demand for economists is strong, boosted by the popularity of the
major at universities and the competing demand for economists at
corporations and government agencies, Hinshaw said Friday.
   ``There are a lot of vacancies,'' he said.
   And the annual convention, scheduled during the collegiate
Christmas break, has become the best place to look for a job for the
700 or so doctoral students who graduate each year, as well as for
economists wanting to change positions, said Hinshaw and others at
the gathering.
   Realizing the convention has become a labor market, organizers
set aside two large hotel rooms for jobs seekers: one where
employers list their vacancies on bulletin boards and in loose-leaf
notebooks, and another lined with dozens of tables for interviews.
   Among employers listing jobs were schools ranging from Dartmouth
College to Slippery Rock University, government agencies such as the
Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., and private employers such as
BellSouth Corp.
   But interviews for the more prestigious jobs _ primarily
assistant professorships at better-known universities _ were held in
suites scattered among the six hotels used for the convention.
   Most of those interviews were scheduled weeks before the
convention, based on applicants' resumes, research, recommendations
and where they are getting their degrees, said Hinshaw, a professor
at Vanderbilt University.
   ``They rent a suite and the kids go in there for three days, one
after the other,'' he said.
   Saranna Robinson, a 30-year-old doctoral candidate at
Carnegie-Mellon University, said she managed to set up about a dozen
interviews before the convention.
   Ms. Robinson, who is seeking a professorship at a ``small,
prestigious'' liberal arts college, said she was optimistic about
her chances.
   ``Some of them (the interviewers) would wink as you went out the
door and say they'd see you later,'' she said.
   She and others hope the colleges will call them back for a second
round of interviews, held on campus, in which faculty and students
grill the applicants on their research and teaching skills.
   Ms. Robinson said she squeezed in a few conference sessions
during her four days at the convention, but concentrated on finding
a job _ a goal backed by her university, which paid her convention
fees.
   But getting to the interviews was hard work.
   ``You're running all around midtown Manhattan, from hotel to
hotel,'' she said. ``I was here eight weeks ago for the New York
City Marathon. I can't decide which one is more strenuous.''
   Starting salaries for assistant economics professors vary little
from college to college, Hinshaw said, with most offering $35,000 to
$40,000.
   Ms. Robinson said she could double that salary by taking an
economics job on Wall Street.
   ``It was tempting for a minute,'' she said. ``But I love
teaching.''

<HEAD>TV Viewers Confused as Florida Stations Switch Network Affiliations
^Eds: Also in Saturday AMs report.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAN SEWELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Television viewers are ready with remote control
channel changers and TV Guides to find their favorite shows as five
stations in south Florida switch network affiliations Sunday and a
sixth makes its debut.
   ``This is about as confused as a market can get,'' said Allen
Shaklan, a CBS television vice president of programming sent from
New York to run Miami's WCIX, an independent station becoming a CBS
affiliate.
   The swaps have created enough mind-boggling situations to fill a
made-for-television movie.
   For instance, standing amid the holiday decorations in the lobby
of television station WTVJ, a CBS network affiliate since 1949, is a
life-size cardboard cutout of Bill Cosby, the star of NBC's
programming lineup.
   Meanwhile, WPEC, an ABC affiliate, has rented billboards
promoting Bob Newhart, a CBS star.
   Just before the opening sequence of ``LA Law,'' the popular NBC
show beginning at 10 p.m. Thursday, Miami station WSVN urges viewers
to start watching the news _ at 10 p.m.
   Confused? Just stay tuned.
   Industry veterans say this Sunday's network swaps are the biggest
affiliation switch in history.
   ``It's absolutely incredible,'' said Robert Ware, vice president
and general manager of Palm Beach Gardens station WPBF, which goes
on the air Sunday morning.
   The changes in the Miami metropolitan television area, the
nation's 14th largest with 1.26 million homes with televisions, and
West Palm Beach, the 50th largest with 490,100 TV households,
affects more than the millions of viewers.
   The two large stations keeping the same network affiliations are
trying to capitalize on viewer confusion; independents are planning
improved programming to lure channel-switching viewers; and cable
companies are adding stations to make sure their subscribers have
all of the networks.
   Making the new TV picture even fuzzier is the signal delivery
problem for the new Miami CBS affiliate WCIX and the overlap of the
two markets.
   Miami television station WPLG, keeping its ABC affiliation, may
pick up viewers in Palm Beach County where it can be viewed in many
homes, for example, while West Palm Beach's WPEC, changing from ABC
to CBS, is stepping up the battle for the 522,000 TV households in
Broward County. Broward lies between Palm Beach and Dade counties
and is counted as part of the Miami market.
   The announcement in January 1987 of the $275 million purchase of
WTVJ from private owners by NBC's parent corporation, General
Electric, set corporate wheels turning and the affiliation dominoes
clicking.
   ``That set the ball rolling. This gives us the opportunity to do
some of the things we always wanted to do,'' said Alex Dryfoos Jr.,
owner-president of WPEC in West Palm Beach.
   The moves after the NBC purchase of CBS' WTVJ in Miami were:
   _ Miami's WSVN, the NBC affiliate, couldn't work out a deal with
CBS and became independent.
   _ CBS instead bought WCIX, the leading Miami independent, for $59
million.
   _ WPEC, the Palm Beach area ABC affiliate, decided to switch to
CBS so it could expand south into Broward, where new WCIX has the
signal problems.
   _ WTVX, a Fort Pierce-based CBS affiliate, becomes independent.
   _ New station WPBF took the unusual step, in an industry in which
the networks court affiliates to carry their programs, of going to
ABC and paying it a reported $1 million to become an ABC affiliate.
   After gaining ABC programs, the new station delayed plans to
begin last Oct. 1 as an independent.
   Unchanged are the respective local-news rating leaders, ABC's
WPLG in Miami and NBC's WPTV in West Palm Beach.
   The stations are taking different promotional approaches.
   Miami's WTVJ, which for the past year has been in the odd
position of running CBS programs while being part of the NBC
ownership family, is most active with what promotions director Linda
Button calls ``a saturation campaign'' built around the theme of
``Don't Worry, Be Happy.''
   The ``Operation Peacock'' campaign, costing at least an estimated
$3 million, has NBC stars cavorting with WTVJ's news team to Bobby
McFerrin's special revision of his pop hit tune ``Don't Worry, Be
Happy.'' WTVJ has a toll-free viewer information line and ran a
half-hour phone-in special Thursday night.
   But television executives acknowledge programming confusion will
scramble the television picture for many viewers, at least for
awhile.
   ``The reality is we have a long, hard road,'' said CBS' Shaklan.
``But we're going to make it work. It's all going to shake itself
out.''

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mayor Marion Barry, under federal investigation
for visiting the hotel room of a man suspected of dealing drugs, has
acknowledged, ``I'm guilty of poor judgment, no question about it.''
   Barry on Friday denied he used drugs and said he would submit to
a drug test ``under the right conditions'' _ but not a series of
tests _ to try to end what he acknowledged is an embarrassment to
the nation's capital.
   ``This human being stands here ready to say I'm sorry for the
poor judgments that have happened to me,'' Barry told reporters in
an interview on public television station WETA.
   The mayor's contrite tone contrasted with a statement Thursday
blaming the media for much of his troubles. ``I have been tried,
convicted, sentenced and doing time by some members of the media,''
Barry said then.
   The Justice Department announced it would aggressively
investigate whether Barry has committed a crime stemming from his
relationship with Charles Lewis, a former employee of the District
of Columbia government.
   Two detectives were recalled from a hotel as they were attempting
to make an undercover drug buy from Lewis last week. At the time,
Barry reportedly was visiting Lewis in his room in a Ramada Inn in
an area of the city plagued by drug dealing and prostitution.
   Lewis has denied involvement with drugs and apparently has
dropped out of sight since last week.
   Barry said Friday he made three or four visits to the hotel room
of Lewis, a man he has known for eight or nine years, out of
``compassion'' after Lewis asked to see him.
   ``I have a tendency to go to people rather than have them come to
me,'' Barry said. ``That's my sense of compassion.'' He said a
``distressed'' Lewis wanted to talk about ``job opportunities.''
   ``I have a tendency to get too close to people that obviously I
shouldn't get too close to,'' Barry said.
   Police sources have said they investigated Lewis after receiving
complaints he offered to sell drugs to a hotel maid.
   Lewis, who worked for the District of Columbia government until
1982, was fired last spring by the governor of the Virgin Islands
after questions were raised about Lewis' use of government funds.
Lewis served as coordinator of a $260,000 contract awarded by the
Virgin Islands to the District of Columbia to improve the island
government's personnel system.
   Barry, without offering specifics, said Friday he has been guilty
of poor judgment four or five times before.
   There were allegations in 1982 he used cocaine at a nightclub. In
1984 there was an inquiry into whether Barry bought drugs from
former city official Karen Johnson, who was convicted of cocaine
dealing.
   A young aspiring model said in 1987 that Barry repeatedly tried
to visit her at home against her wishes.
   The mayor, who is married, vacationed in the Bahamas a few months
later with a woman who worked for a city contractor.

<HEAD>US Credits Moscow For `Significant' Progress On Human Rights</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Reagan administration is crediting the
Soviet Union with ``significant progress'' in improving treatment of
political prisoners and Jewish refuseniks.
   A State Department spokeswoman said Friday the Soviets have
released more than 600 political prisoners in the last two years,
including all the monitors of the 1973 Helsinki agreement aimed at
improving the human rights situation.
   Phyllis Oakley, the department spokeswoman, said all prisoners
charged with violating political or religious constraints are now
free. Jewish emigration soared to 2,400 last month, and less than a
dozen of 120 cases of Soviet citizens denied permission to join
family members abroad remain unresolved, she added.
   The Soviets have stopped jamming U.S.-sponsored radio broadcasts,
and President Mikhail S. Gorbachev in his speech Dec. 7 to the U.N.
General Assembly pledged that laws bearing on human rights would be
changed, Mrs. Oakley said.
   ``They have made significant progress,'' she said. ``I think
that's clear from the examples I've given.''
   On the other hand, a U.S. official said, the Soviets have not
cleared up questions about the cases of some 30 citizens the Soviets
say are in prison as criminal offenders. State Department officials
suspect the prisoners may be political victims.
   But the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said
``We're developing a process. It just hasn't jelled yet.''
   The Soviets also have given the United States a list of about 50
Jewish refuseniks who will be granted exit permits for Israel.
   The Reagan administration has held off opening negotiations
between the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the Warsaw Pact
on cuts in troops and arms in Europe until it is satisfied with
Soviet performance on human rights.
   Being held up, as well, is the completion of a 35-nation
conference in Vienna reviewing compliance with the Helsinki
agreement.
   Also, the Reagan administration has withheld its consent to the
holding of a review in Moscow in 1991. Gorbachev wants the
conference held in his capital to demonstrate a new openness in the
Soviet Union. Reviews are scheduled next year in Paris and in 1990
in Copenhagen.
   In Palm Springs, Calif., where President Reagan is spending the
New Year's holiday, White House spokeman Roman Popadiuk said, ``No
decisions have been made. We are considering the Moscow conference
in light of improvements taking place in Soviet human rights
performance and Soviet guarantees of access and openness to anyone
who wants to attend such a meeting.''
   Popadiuk said he was unable to say whether Reagan would make the
decision or leave it to be made by President-elect Bush.
   Once the roadblock is removed, the East-West arms control talks
are expected to begin. The goal is the reduction of conventional
troops, tanks and artillery across Europe.
   ``The Soviet Union has taken a number of significant, positive
actions on human rights in recent months,'' Mrs. Oakley said. ``No
decision has been made on whether we should agree to include the
proposed Moscow human rights conference as one of the three
post-Vienna human rights meetings.''
   She added that it was ``premature'' to talk of closing the Vienna
meeting, although the Austrian government has tentatively invited
foreign ministers to be on hand Jan. 17-19.

   Spare change burning a hole in your pocket?
   Caesars Palace may have come up with an answer _ slot machines
that swallow specially minted $500 tokens.
   The new machines were unveiled Friday afternoon, just in time to
catch the New Year's holiday crowd flocking to this gaming capital.
The city is expecting 110,000 visitors over New Year's,
traditionally one of the resort's biggest weekends.
   The first customer was no stranger to Caesars. Mike Matuk of
Bakersfield, Calif., who won $1.28 million on a Caesars slot machine
Christmas Day, played a number of coins.
   He was followed by John Abruscato of New York City, who played a
little longer.
   Both won a few, lost a few and left empty-handed. Matuk, however,
returned a short time later and repeated his Midas act of Christmas.
He pulled the machine's first big jackpot, $25,000.
   Caesars officials say the new machines are the first in the world
to accept $500 tokens. Numerous resorts have machines that accept
$100 tokens.
   ``We're not expecting a great amount of volume, but we expect
there will be customer interest,'' said Caesars spokeswoman Debbie
Munch. ``We're not putting them out there just for show.''
   The slots were designed for Caesars by Universal Manufacturing
Co. of Tokyo. Each of three machines accepts one $500 token for each
pull of the handle.
   The machines feature a top jackpot of $250,000 _ not much of a
bargain when compared with the $1 million-plus payouts offered on
nearby $1 machines.

   Former Republican presidential candidate Pat
Robertson's campaign committee has agreed to pay $25,000 in fines
for violating federal election laws, officials said.
   Federal Election Commission spokesman Fred Eiland said Friday the
Robertson campaign had agreed to penalties assessed for three major
violations.
   ``The campaign had failed to file as a candidate in a timely
fashion and had failed to file a statement of organization and had
failed to file campaign finance reports in a timely fashion,'' said
Eiland.
   Eiland said the commission's action came in response to a
complaint filed earlier this year by Harvey Furgatch, a California
resident, concerning a three-hour Washington, D.C., rally in
September 1986 attended by about 3,000 people.
   The complaint ``stems from the fact that while the campaign was
claiming it was testing the waters, Robertson had a rally in
Constitution Hall in which several millions of dollars were
raised,'' said Eiland.
   During the rally supporters made $100 and $200 contributions
using a ``personal gift form'' supplied by rally organizers. The
event, billed as an appeal for support for Robertson, was broadcast
via closed-circuit television to 216 locations nationwide.
   Robertson didn't officially declared his candidacy until October
1, 1987.
   ``That is where the problem was,'' said Eiland. ``The very nature
of the activity where prominent people referred to him as a
candidate and asked support, both financial and other for him,'' is
what raised the question about whether Robertson was a candidate at
the time of the rally.
   ``A candidate is defined by federal law as someone who has raised
or spent more than $5,000 in a year toward his candidacy. He must
register a statement of candidacy within 15 days and a statement of
organization of a principal campaign committee within 10 days,''
said Eiland. ``They failed to do that.''

   Actor-director Leonard Nimoy, the logic-loving
part-Vulcan of the ``Star Trek'' television show and movies, plans
to follow his heart and get married on New Year's Day.
   The actor, who transformed the pointy ears of the alien Mr. Spock
character on the ``Star Trek'' television series into a pop culture
artifact, will wed Susan Bay, a film production executive.
   The small, private ceremony will be in the Los Angeles area, said
a spokeswoman for Nimoy.
   Nimoy, 57, recently completed work on ``Star Trek V: The Final
Frontier'' for Paramount Studios. He directed the 1987 film ``Three
Men and a Baby'' through the Walt Disney Co. subsidiary Touchstone
Pictures, and ``The Good Mother,'' starring Diane Keaton, which was
released in November.

   Actor Kenneth Earl Holliday, who plays an
investigator on the television series ``Matlock,'' was arrested on a
drunken driving charge after hitting a parked car, police said.
   Holliday, 39, of Sherman Oaks was freed on his own recognizance
after appearing in court on a misdemeanor driving citation, said Los
Angeles County sheriff's Lt. Charles Schultz.
   The actor was arrested after his car crossed the center line on a
street just outside the Los Angeles city limits and hit a parked car
late Thursday, said California Highway Patrol Officer Diane Vickers.
   Holliday, alone in the car, was unhurt, Ms. Vickers said.
   After failing a field sobriety test, the actor was taken to the
county sheriff's station and booked for investigation of misdemeanor
drunken driving, Ms. Vickers said. Results of a blood alcohol test
weren't immediately available, the officer said.
   The actor, whose screen name is ``Kene'' Holliday, plays Tyler
Marshall on the NBC series, which stars Andy Griffith as an Atlanta
lawyer.

   The Firehouse Dinner Theater, in financial
distress, got a ``real shot in the arm'' when Carol Burnett,
Christopher Reeve, Van Johnson and Ellen Burstyn sent telegrams of
support, its producer says.
   Earlier this week, Firehouse producer Dick Mueller said the
theater's future may be in doubt. The 17-year-old theater is in
bankruptcy reorganization.
   But by Thursday, Mueller said, he had received telegrams from 11
entertainers.
   In addition to Miss Burnett, Reeve, Johnson and Miss Burstyn,
notes of encouragement came from Jane Powell, Imogene Coca and the
cast of Broadway's ``Phantom of the Opera,'' he said.
   ``This is a real shot in the arm,'' Mueller said. ``It's nice to
know that the world, on a national level, cares about what we're
doing.''
   ``It was a surprise,'' he said. ``They came out of the woodwork.''
   Mueller said the management of the Actors' Equity Association,
the actors' professional organization, may have helped spread the
word of the theater's financial plight.

   Former President Gerald R. Ford will
offer insights into how a retired president spends his time at a
conference here next fall, officials at the Herbert Hoover
Presidential Library say.
   Former presidents Richard Nixon and Jimmy Carter and President
Reagan also have been invited, said library director Richard Norton
Smith.
   ``I've always been fascinated by the ex-presidency,'' Smith said.
``What do you do? It's an undefined job.''
   Hoover spent the most years as a former president, from 1933,
when he left office, until 1964, when he died at age 90.
   After George Bush is inaugurated, there will be four living
former presidents, the second highest number in history, Smith said.
At the beginning of the Civil War, there were five living former
presidents.
   The Hoover Library and the Gerald R. Ford Presidential Museum in
Grand Rapids, Mich., are co-sponsoring the event Oct. 18-19, Smith
said.

<HEAD>Year-end Farm Prices Up 14 Percent From 1987</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prices paid to farmers for raw products ended
the year 14 percent higher, on average, than at the close of 1987,
according to government figures.
   The Agriculture Department's agricultural statistics board said
Friday in its final report of the year that preliminary figures
showed December's prices were up 0.7 percent from November.
   In part driven by the summer's drought, prices received by
farmers rose throughout most of 1988 until September, when the
increase leveled off, and then dipped in October before rising again
in November and December.
   Officials said higher prices for hogs, lettuce, oranges and
cattle in December were partly offset by lower prices for tomatoes,
turkeys, sweet corn and strawberries.
   ``Hog prices increased substantially from last month's relatively
low levels, while cattle, milk, broiler and egg prices each
increased slightly,'' the report said.
   ``The all-wheat price was at the highest level since May 1981.
Soybean and corn prices increased slightly since November,'' the
report added.
   Further, revised figures showed the price index also increased
0.7 percent in November from its October average. A month ago, the
preliminary figures showed a decline.
   Prices of livestock and livestock products as a group were up 2
percent from their November average and were up 9.2 percent from
December 1987, the report said.
   Prices of feed grain and hay as a group rose 0.8 percent from
November and averaged 46 percent above the year-earlier level.
Commercial vegetables were down 2.1 percent from November and
averaged 21 percent less than in December 1987. Sharp declines for
tomatoes and sweet corn more than offset a large increase in the
price of lettuce.
   Although the projections are subject to change, USDA economists
say net cash income of farmers may be in the range of $55 billion to
$60 billion this year, compared with the record level of $57.1
billion in 1987. That is the difference between cash receipts and
cash expenses during the calendar year.
   Preliminary figures show that 1988 retail food prices rose an
average of about 4 percent and that a similar increase is expected
in 1989.
   The report said:
   _Cattle averaged $67.30 per 100 pounds of live weight nationally,
up from $66.70 in November. The price was $62.20 in December 1987.
Those are averages for all types of cattle sold as beef.
   _Hogs averaged $40.50 per 100 pounds, compared with $36.20 in
November and $40.30 a year earlier.
   _Corn, at $2.54 a bushel, was up from $2.51 in November and $1.72
in December 1987.
   _Wheat prices at the farm, according to preliminary figures,
averaged $3.89 per bushel, compared with $3.88 in November and $2.70
a year earlier.
   _Rice averaged $6.72 per 100 pounds, unchanged from November but
down from $7.37 a year earlier.
   _Soybeans were $7.48 per bushel, compared with $7.43 in November
and $5.63 a year earlier.
   _Upland cotton was reported at 56.1 cents per pound, down from
56.7 cents in November and 64.6 cents in December 1987.
   _Eggs were 59.7 cents per dozen, compared with 59.4 cents in
November and 48.6 cents a year earlier.
   _Milk was $13.50 per 100 pounds, compared with $13.40 in November
and $12.70 a year earlier.
   _Broilers were 35.5 cents per pound, live weight, compared with
35 cents in November and 24.6 cents a year ago.

<TEXT>
   Eight Thai journalists were killed this
year, some of whom were assassinated after exposing corruption or
criticizing the military, a leading human rights activist said today.
   Thongbai Thongpao said some of the journalists who were slain
died in activities outside their work, and that two other newsmen
were shot and wounded after criticizing military, police and
government officials, he said.
   Few arrests have been made in these cases, Thongbai said without
elaborating.
   ``I want to issue these facts to the government so that it
realizes there are still influential people who threaten the lives
of journalists in Thailand,'' the lawyer and former journalist told
The Associated Press.
   Thongbai won the 1984 Ramon Massaysay award, sometimes called
``Asia's Nobel Prize,'' for public service. He is active in both
Thai and Asian human rights organizations and often takes up the
causes of Thailand's poor.
   Thailand has developed a press widely regarded as freer than most
in Asia. But some influential businessmen and officials, especially
in provincial areas, have reacted to journalistic investigations of
their activities by hiring gunmen to assassinate reporters.

<HEAD>US Rejects Libyan Offer For Outside Inspection Of Chemical Plant</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The State Department has rejected a Libyan
offer to permit foreign inspection of a plant that the United States
claims is designed to produce chemical weapons.
   The United States said it has evidence that the factory, which
the Libyans call Pharma-150, is on the verge of producing chemical
weapons. Libya claims the newly built facility near Rabta, 50 miles
southwest of Tripoli, is a pharmaceutical plant.
   ``A one-time inspection could not be conclusive in this regard,''
State Department spokeswoman Phyllis Oakley said Friday in rejecting
the offer made last week by Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi.
   ``A CW plant could easily be modified to appear as a legitimate
industrial chemical plant such as a pharmaceutical or fertilizer
facility,'' she said.
   ``All traces of chemical weapons production could be erased from
a plant on extremely short notice,'' she added.
   President Reagan said last week that the United States had
discussed with other NATO members possible military action against
the plant, and had urged the allies to withhold from Libya technical
expertise that could be used for chemical weapons production.
   Companies from Italy, Japan and West Germany are believed to have
helped Libya build the plant or the adjacent industrial complex.
Japan told the United States its nationals believed they were
involved in the construction of a fertilizer plant.
   CIA Director William Webster said recently that the Libyan plant
is on the verge of production. Mrs. Oakley said Friday it was not
yet operational.
   The United States also makes chemical weapons but says they serve
only as a deterrent against a possible chemical attack from the
Soviet Union. U.S. counterterrorism officials have expressed concern
that Gadhafi might give chemical arms to one of several terrorist
groups which make their headquarters in Tripoli.
   The Libyan plant will be discussed next week at an international
conference in Paris on plans to stem the proliferation of chemical
weapons around the world. The U.S. delegation will be led by
Secretary of State George P. Shultz.
   Foreign ministers at the Paris meeting also will discuss claims
by South Korea that North Korea has chemical weapons capability.
   Mrs. Oakley said U.S. information shows the communist North does
have limited chemical weapons capability using equipment supplied by
the Soviet Union.
   But she said the United States could not confirm or deny the
existence of production or storage facilities in the North because
its most recent information was from 1986.
   The United States does not have any indication that North Korea
plans to use chemical weapons against the South, but the Pyongyang
government has a good defense system against chemical weapons, Mrs.
Oakley said.

   The Coast Guard has called off its search for the
six crewmen missing since their Bermuda-bound cargo ship sank in a
storm Wednesday night off New Jersey.
   After rescue planes spent Friday scouring 9,300 square miles of
ocean in the North Atlantic in a vain search, the rescue mission was
officially suspended.
   The decision to suspend the search was made after two of the
three survivors said one of the vessel's two lifeboats was still
lashed to the container ship Lloyd Bermuda when it sank, Coast Guard
Petty Officer Ellen Harrington said.
   Five crewmen were plucked from the sea but one died on the way to
the hospital and one was dead by the time he was found. Three
survivors were recovering from hypothermia Friday.
   Nine planes were involved in the search. Earlier it was believed
the lifeboat might be at sea and the men inside it.
   ``After the time passed, and based on the eyewitness accounts,
we're assuming there are no survivors,'' she said.
   The Lloyd Bermuda, a 254-foot container ship carrying provisions
for the island nation of Bermuda, capsized and sank Wednesday night
amid 25-foot waves and violent winds 160 miles south of Nantucket
and 200 miles east of New Jersey.
   Rescue workers Friday dropped radio signal-emitting buoys to
track water currents, but found only debris.
   ``It's like we're searching for a Volkswagen in the state of New
Hampshire,'' Coast Guard Petty Officer Ken Arbogast.
   Two of the rescued crewmen were identifed as Asmi Amvar and Jorge
Montoya, 31, according to Harold Halpin of Lamorte Burns, of
Greenwich, Conn., a representative of the ship's owners. He would
not disclose their nationalities.
   The third survivor, Dario Macio-Lopez, 35, of Honduras, was
recovering from hypothermia in the intensive care unit at Falmouth
Hospital. Macio-Lopez had lashed himself to a piece of floating
wooden debris and rescuers had to pry his fingers from the wood,
authorities said.
   The ship's captain was American and the crew was a mix of
nationalities, John W. Moore of the Meyer Agencies Inc., the ship's
agent in Bermuda, said in an interview from Hamilton.
   A memorial service was held in Port Newark, N.J., Friday for the
crew members who perished.
   ``A seafarer is a brother to every other seafarer,'' said the
Rev. Barbara Crafton, an Episcopal priest and maritime chaplain who
knew the men.
   The Lloyd Bermuda, registered in Cyprus, left Port Elizabeth,
N.J., Tuesday night bound for Bermuda with a cargo that included
food and domestic goods.
   The captain radioed a distress signal at 7:10 p.m. Wednesday,
saying the ship's load had shifted and the vessel would soon
capsize. Survivors said they abandoned ship within minutes and
watched it sink from their lifeboat.

<HEAD>Shah's Son Says Khomeini May Be `Frantic' About Opposition</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: SUBS graf 10 to clarify</NOTE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The heir to Iran's defunct throne said that if
Iranian terrorists were responsible for last week's bombing of Pan
Am Flight 103 it would show the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini was
``frantic'' about opposition to his continued rule.
   Investigators probing the Pan Am wreckage in Scotland have
concluded that a bomb caused the Dec. 21 crash, but they have
reported no evidence that Iran was involved.
   Reza Pahlavi, the oldest son of the late Shah of Iran, issued a
statement Friday after several news organizations in London received
anonymous telephone demands that the United States deport him or
risk another terrorist bombing like the one that destroyed the Pan
Am jet. All 259 people aboard the plane were killed.
   The caller claimed to represent a terror group known as Guardians
of the Islamic Revolution, which, in similar calls last week, took
responsibility for the air disaster over Scotland.
   ``If this is true, it is clearly a fresh indication that
Khomeini's terrorist agents are still hard at work around the
globe,'' Pahlavi said.
   ``It is also another indication that the Khomeini regime, faced
with growing popular resentment, is becoming increasingly frantic
about its future,'' the statement said. It cited a recent wave of
executions of dissidents in Iran as further evidence.
   In a related development Friday, a U.S. official speaking on
condition of anonymity, said an Iranian intermediary has approached
the United States offering to reopen diplomatic talks between the
two countries. The official said the State Department was holding
out for ``a substantive, up-front'' proposal.
   The official said the offer was channeled through an
Iranian-American professor.
   The United States and Iran have had no diplomatic relations since
1979 when militants seized and sacked the U.S. embassy in Tehran,
taking the Americans there hostage.
   Iranian authorities appear uneasy about a recent campaign by the
28-year-old Pahlavi seemingly designed to foment opposition to the
Khomeini government.
   West Germany recently denied Pahlavi permission to enter the
country for a speaking engagement, after a request from Iranian
authorities to German Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher.
   Earlier this month Iran complained to the British Broadcasting
Corp. about a broadcast by Pahlavi on Dec. 2.
   ``I am confident that the United States government as well as
other governments ... will stand firm and will never surrender to
terrorist pressure,'' Pahlavi's statement said.
   Pahlavi lives behind a veil of secrecy and security at a palatial
home in suburban Washington, on the same street as Saudi Ambassador
Prince Bandar and Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass. It is also near the
Central Intelligence Agency's headquarters.
   Pahlavi, a trained jet fighter pilot, knows he is vulnerable to
terrorist threats.
   ``When you know you are the number one target of the number one
terrorists in the world, that doesn't make you really very
comfortable,'' said Pahlavi in a recent interview.
   The young prince left Iran in 1978, eight months before his
father was ousted by Khomeini's Islamic revolution. Pahlavi, who
declared himself the legitimate monarch of Iran when his father died
of cancer in 1980, has been rallying exiled supporters in recent
months in the United States and Europe.
   ``If you believe in me as a leader, then help me,'' he told some
1,100 Iranians at a World Affairs Council dinner in Los Angeles
three months ago. ``The time has come. It's time to move.''
   Pahlavi, who has a degree in political science, wants to see the
monarchy restored in his ancient land, with himself as head of state
rather than head of government. He has cited Spain as an example of
how he would like to fashion the monarchy in Iran.
   Pahlavi has been accused by opponents of being a tool of the CIA,
which openly supported his father for many years.
   Pahlavi's mother, the Empress Fara Diba, and his three younger
siblings, also live in the United States. The family fortune has
been estimated as high as $15 billion, including real estate in
California.

<HEAD>Campesino Leader Slain By Rancher In Southern Mexico</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TUXTLA GUTIERREZ, Mexico (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A campesino leader in southern
Chiapas was slain when a rancher who blamed him for land takeovers
shot him at point-blank range at a gas station, a state official
said.
   Sebastian Perez Nunez, a former state legislator who led the
Independent Center of Agricultural Workers and Campesinos, was in a
pickup truck waiting to buy gas outside this state capital when the
rancher arrived in a pickup, also to buy gas, state government
spokesman Higinio Garcia said.
   Garcia said campesinos had been occupying 120 acres of the
rancher's 740-acre landsite since Aug. 30, demanding it be turned
over to them.
   ``Because of that situation, he went to fight with Perez Nunez,
because he accused him of being the leader of the invasions,''
Garcia said by telephone.
   ``They talked and he took out a pistol. He shot 12 bullets at
him,'' the spokesman said.
   Perez Nunez was killed and his driver wounded in the ankle, he
said. Perez Nunez' wife, who was sitting in the middle, was not
injured, he said.
   The rancher, Roberto Zenteno Rojas, has fled, Garcia said.
   Under Mexican law, landholdings that exceed the legal limits or
are left idle may be expropriated and given to groups of campesinos
to use as an ejido, a type of communal farm.
   Disputes between landless campesinos and large landholders and
between leftist and government-aligned campesino groups are common
in Chiapas, Mexico's southernmost state.

   Parliament approved a historic free-trade
agreement between the United States and Canada, clearing the last
legal hurdle for the pact between the world's largest two-way
trading partnership to begin at midnight tonight.
   The Senate vote on Friday ended three years of often heated
debate. President Reagan and Prime Minister Brian Mulroney signed
the treaty last Jan. 2, but the pact required Canadian legislative
approval.
   In between, the free-trade issue became the focal point of the
national elections, won on Nov. 21 by Mulroney's Progressive
Conservatives. Opponents claimed the agreement would cost Canadians
their jobs and make them an economic underling to their financially
stronger southern neighbor.
   Others claimed the pact would ultimately cost them their economic
freedom.
   ``Even though we intend to acquiesce and the bill will become
law, our concerns have not disappeared,'' Allan MacEachen, the
Liberals' leader in the Senate, said during the debate. ``The
government has chosen the hard discpline of the market. We will have
to monitor whether the market does its job.''
   Mulroney _ who in 1983 called free-trade a threat to sovereignty
_ touted the deal as assuring future Canadian prosperity by
guaranteeing access to the larger, richer U.S. market. Canada
already has a $200 billion annual trade relationship with the United
States.
   The Economic Council of Canada expects it will produce 250,000
jobs over 10 years.
   ``Years from now, I believe it will be said of this generation of
Canadians that we made the right choice,'' Trade Minister John
Crosbie said.
   ``All that we cherish about Canada, all that makes us unique as a
country, will be enhanced as Canadians excel and prosper under the
free-trade agreement,'' the Senate leader of the Conservatives,
Lowell Murray, said in the final debate.
   The approval in Ottawa was by voice and not tabulated, although
senators abstained from the opposition Liberal Party.
   Over the next 10 years, the deal will phase out tariffs and
border restrictions on banking, investment, energy and services.
   The actual start of the agreement will be marked only by an
exchange of diplomatic notes. Few signs of it will be visible
immediately to travelers or consumers.
   The U.S. Congress completed its legislation in September for the
agreement, but the opposition in Canada delayed it.
   The Conservatives used their majority in the House of Commons to
impose rare limits on debate and approve the legislation 141-111 in
a special session Dec. 24. Several members of the opposition Liberal
Party sang the national anthem, ``O Canada,'' as they cast their
losing votes.
   The Liberals control the non-elected Senate and had tied up the
legislation there last fall, forcing Mulroney to call the election.
They promised, however, not to repeat their action if he won a
majority government.

   Oliver North is trying to get President Reagan
and President-elect Bush to testify at his trial, an unprecedented
legal maneuver Reagan reportedly considers another attempt to get
him to pardon the former Marine charged in the Iran-Contra scandal.
   White House and Justice Department officials said the subpoenas
were received Friday and that until a thorough review by
administration attorneys it would be ``premature to speculate'' how
Reagan and Bush will respond.
   North, the fired White House aide charged with conspiracy for his
role in the Iran-Contra affair, called for testimony from the
nation's two highest-ranking elected officials in subpoenas
delivered to the Justice Department.
   North's trial is scheduled to start Jan. 31, or 11 days after
Bush takes over for Reagan.
   While declining to state directly whether they would contest the
subpoenas, spokesmen for the White House and Bush signaled they
would not automatically accept them. The Washington Post today
quoted unidentified Justice Department and White House officials as
saying they would fight them.
   The Post also quoted a White House official as saying that Reagan
viewed the subpoena as an attempt to prod him into pardoning North.
But Reagan, urged by some conservatives to pardon North, has not
changed his view that the case should be decided at trial, the
newspaper quoted the official as saying.
   The newspaper, quoting sources it did not identify further, said
State Department and National Security Agency officials have also
received subpoenas from North's attorney.
   Statements from the White House and Bush's office called it
``unprecedented'' for a sitting president to testify in court, said
they were reviewing the legal issues, and noted that historical
precedent would call for the witnesses to testify in writing rather
than take the stand.
   In Palm Springs, Calif., where Reagan is on vacation, a White
House statement acknowledged North's subpoena, ``seeking the
president's testimony at the criminal trial of Oliver North. The
subpoena also seeks the discovery of certain personal records of the
president.''
   The subpoenas were anticipated, it said. Aides to both Reagan and
Bush told them Friday morning that the documents would come that
afternoon, their spokesmen said.
   White House spokesman Roman Popadiuk said Reagan had known of the
likelihood since Wednesday.
   ``It raises significant legal and constitutional questions which
are currently being reviewed by the Department of Justice and
counsel to the president,'' the White House said in language similar
to a statement released by Bush spokeswoman Sheila Tate.
   ``It would be unprecedented for a president to appear as a
witness at a criminal trial and it's premature to speculate on the
final decision that will ultimately be taken, but historical
precedent suggests any relevant information could be provided
through written questions and answers.''
   North, a retired Marine lieutenant colonel who worked for Reagan
as an aide to the National Security Council, faces trial Jan. 31 for
charges stemming from the U.S. arms sales to Iran and diversion of
proceeds to the Contra rebels in Nicaragua.
   He is charged with conspiring with former national security
adviser John Poindexter and arms dealers Albert Hakim and retired
Air Force Maj. Gen. Richard Secord to illegally divert more than $12
million in U.S.-Iran arms-sales profits to the Contras.
   Justice Department spokesman Loye Miller said the subpoenas were
received at mid-afternoon, ``one for the president and one for the
vice president,'' by Robert Ross, executive assistant to Attorney
General Dick Thornburgh.
   Tate said Bush legal counsel Boyden Gray was reviewing the
matter, but that the vice president was going ahead with a long
weekend of relaxation at Camp David, Md., and planned no meetings to
discuss the trial matter. Bush and his wife Barbara arrived at Camp
David on Friday and planned to stay until late Monday.
   Bush takes office as president on Jan. 20, and could claim
executive privilege to avoid testifying on matters of national
security, which much of the North case involves.
   North's attorney, Brendan Sullivan, appearing on ABC News on
Friday, was asked why he issued the subpoenas. He said, ``a defense
lawyer has an obligation to issue a subpoena for every person who
has relevant information about a matter in court ... The president
himself has indicated he has relevant information.''
   In 1973, President Nixon received a subpoena to turn over White
House tape recordings in the Watergate scandal. He was not required
to testify, but the Supreme Court ordered him to release the tapes.
   The subpoena could force Bush to disclose information he
previously has kept secret.
   Bush repeatedly has refused to discuss his private discussions
and advice to Reagan on the Iran-Contra affair, other than to say he
expressed reservations about U.S. arms sales to Iran.
   The congressional Iran-Contra investigating committees concluded
last year that there was no evidence Bush knew of the diversion plan.
   Bush also said he was unaware of North's secret operation to
supply the Contras during the congressional ban on aid, although his
national security adviser Donald Gregg was well informed on the
matter, and Bush met three times with Felix Rodriguez, a North
operative in the operation.
   Other questions continue on how much Bush knew about the
arms-for-hostages aspect of the Iran matter. He has said he did not
know about it until late 1986, but his chief of staff indicated that
Israeli operative Amiram Nir briefed Bush on the matter in May 1986.
   Bush said he was told about what the Israelis were doing, not the
U.S. participation.

<HEAD>Court Calls For More Study Of Offshore Oil Threat</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Reagan administration did not adequately
study the protections needed for migratory wildlife before adopting
a plan last year for offshore oil and gas leasing through 1992, a
federal appeals court says.
   The U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals on Friday ordered the Interior
Department to conduct a more thorough study. The ruling does not
immediately impede the leasing program.
   The wildlife at issue include the gray whale and salmon that
migrate in the north Pacific between California and Alaska, and
various migratory birds.
   The appeals court's unsigned, 64-page opinion rejected all other
aspects of a challenge against the five-year plan adopted by
Interior Secretary Donald P. Hodel in July 1987.
   The previous five-year plan survived all court challenges.
   The latest plan was challenged by the National Resources Defense
Council, other environmental groups and the states of California,
Massachusetts, Oregon and Washington.
   An Interior Department spokesman said the agency welcomed the
ruling and would comply with it.
   The first possible lease offering that could be affected is
scheduled in Alaska for December 1989.

<HEAD>China Cleared To Buy More Subsidized U.S. Wheat</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   China has been authorized to buy an additional
1 million metric tons of U.S. wheat at subsidized prices.
   Acting Agriculture Undersecretary Milton J. Hertz said Friday the
wheat will be available to China under the department's Export
Enhancement Program, or EEP. A metric ton is about 2,205 pounds and
is equal to 36.7 bushels of wheat.
   Under EEP, private exporters can sell U.S. commodities at reduced
prices in order to meet foreign competition in selected overseas
markets and then collect free government surpluses of grain or other
commodities as bonuses, or subsidies.
   The subsidies have ranged from less than $20 to more than $40 per
ton of wheat, or in the range of 54 cents to $1.09 per bushel.
   Under previous EEP authorizations, China has bought more than 6
million tons of wheat for delivery in 1988-89. Only 10,000 tons
remained in the previous authorization issued on Dec. 7.

<HEAD>Mercedes-Benz Pays Record $20.2 Million Fine for Gas-Guzzlers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mercedes-Benz paid a record $20.2 million fine
assessed because its 1986 cars guzzled too much gasoline, the
National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said.
   The luxury German automaker was fined because the 86,020 cars it
sold in the United States in the 1986 model year fell 4.7 miles per
gallon short of meeting that year's required fleet average minimum
mileage, 26.0 mpg, said Tim Hurd, spokesman for the agency.
   The law requires a fine of $5 for every tenth of a mile per
gallon that the standard is missed _ $235 a car in this case _ times
the number of cars sold.
   Manufacturers may apply credits earned by doing better than the
minimum in other years, but Mercedes exhausted all its credits in
the 1985 model year.
   An administrative law judge has proposed to fine the company
about $5.5 million for 1985, when the company's U.S. fleet averaged
23.6 mpg and the requirement was 27.5 mpg. Without credits, the 1985
fine would be nearly $18 million, Hurd said.
   The largest previous fine was $8.8 million paid by Jaguar in 1987
for shortfalls in 1985. Jaguar also paid about $6 million in 1986
for 1984 cars.
   Mercedes has 10 days to appeal the proposed 1985 fine, Hurd said.

<HEAD>Weddings, First Night Celebrations Bring in New Year</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Revelers will count down the seconds, pop corks on bottles of
bubbly and holler ``Happy New Year'' while some say ``I do'' at a
mass wedding and an undertaker hopes to hear ``No, thanks'' to his
free funeral offer.
   So-called First Night celebrations focusing on the arts will mark
the ripping of the last page from the calendar in 23 U.S. cities.
   Parades and fireworks also will ring in 1989, as police brace for
drunken driving, crowded streets and hearty partying that goes
overboard.
   More than 500,000 people are expected to mill around Boston's
streets today as 1,000 artists take to public plazas and storefront
stages in the 13th annual First Night celebration.
   The festivities, originally launched in 1976 to close out the
year's bicentennial events, have spawned similar festivals across
the nation.
   ``A lot of people are tired of New Year's Eve and have nothing to
do. I know I never did,'' publicist Lisa Jacobson said. ``But this
is a unique and educational way to ring in the new year.''
   Officials portray the event as an urban celebration with a
small-town bent.
   The marathon begins this afternoon with a family festival that
includes dance, theater, puppetry and storytelling. It extends into
the evening with a costumed procession and late-night avant-garde
exhibitions that will include neon sculpture, Chinese acrobatics, a
multimedia installation on Boston City Hall's facade and 16-foot ice
sculptures.
   Miami will welcome the New Year with the King Orange Jamboree
Parade tonight followed by some salsa dancing in downtown Miami
overlooking Biscayne Bay. And those who can afford it will fork up
$750 to hear Spanish singer Raphael at Miami Beach's Fontainebleau.
   In Woonsocket, R.I., people will gather on Social Street to watch
a glittering ball drop down the city's tallest building, while in
New York the most famous ball will be dropped at the stroke of
midnight in Times Square before an anticipated crowd of 400,000.
   This year, however, things will be different in the Big Apple.
   The wrought-iron ball replaces the red apple used in recent years
``because it's a more universal symbol,'' said Tama Starr, president
of Artkraft Strauss Sign Corp., which created the new ball.
   The Empire State Building will offer an hour-long light show
beginning at the stroke of midnight; not to honor the new year but
to celebrate the centennial of the Eiffel Tower.
   President Reagan and his wife, Nancy, will be spending their 21st
New Year's holiday at the desert estate of publisher Walter
Annenberg in Palm Springs, Calif. President-elect George Bush and
his wife, Barbara, were spending a long weekend at Camp David, Md.
   In Tennessee's Smoky Mountains, at least 100 couples are planning
to start off the New Year by getting hitched, according to the Rev.
Ed Taylor, dubbed the ``marry-thon'' minister of the Smokies.
   ``This takes the cake,'' said Taylor, who performed 113 marriages
last Valentine's Day. ``This weekend has turned into the second
busiest time of the year.''
   Bob Neel's New Year's Eve offer, on the other hand, is a bit more
sobering.
   For the past 10 years, he has offered a free casket, funeral
service and burial to anyone killed in a drunken driving accident
during the year-end celebrations.
   Neel, chairman of Woodlawn Memorial Park & Funeral Home in
Orlando, Fla., started the practice as a way of alerting people to
the dangers of drinking and driving _ and possibly saving a life or
two.
   So far, he's had no takers.
   ``I can't prove it with statistics, of course, but I get so many
calls and letters you wouldn't believe,'' Neel said. ``They tell me
it's made them more aware of drinking. I know it has me and my
friends. The publicity, I'm sure, has done some good.''

   President Corazon Aquino today refused
again to allow Ferdinand Marcos to return to the Philippines after
the former president was admitted to a Honolulu hospital and
administered last rites.
   ``There are reports that the former President would like to
return to the Philippines in the light of his alleged failing
health,'' Mrs. Aquino said.
   ``Considerations of national welfare and interest'' caused her to
reject a return for Marcos, who ruled the Philippines for 20 years
but has lived in Hawaii since he was ousted in a popular uprising in
February 1986, she said.
   ``For my part, I offer my prayers for his good health and
well-being,'' Mrs. Aquino added.
   Vice President Salvador Laurel said today in a radio interview
that Marcos' wife Imelda telephoned him Friday to ask that he
intercede with Mrs. Aquino to allow the former president to return.
   Laurel said Mrs. Aquino she promised only to study the matter.
   ``I think (Marcos) should be allowed home. ... Every Filipino
should be allowed to return home,'' Laurel said.
   Marcos entered a Honolulu hospital Thursday for the second time
in three weeks.
   Joe Lazo, president of the Friends of Marcos group, said the
former president was administered last rites by a Roman Catholic
priest and that his followers would urge President Reagan to allow
him to return as a ``dying wish.''
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Debra Livingston said Thursday that a
hearing had been set for Jan. 19 to decide whether Marcos was
healthy enough to travel to New York and face arraignment on U.S.
racketeering charges.
   Tomas Gomez III, the Philippine consul general in Hawaii, said
Honolulu reporters had been informed in advance about Marcos' plan
to enter the hospital.
   Gomez repeatedly has accused Marcos of feigning poor health in an
attempt to gain public sympathy and stall the case against him.
   Marcos, 71, who contends he is too ill to travel to New York, was
reported in guarded but improving condition Friday after suffering
``the second severe episode of congestive heart failure in a
month,'' according to Norma Kop, spokeswoman for St. Francis
Hospital.
   Ms. Kop said earlier reports that Marcos was also suffering from
pneumonia were wrong. A Marcos spokesman said he was expected to
remain hospitalized for several days for more tests.
   Marcos spent nine days at St. Francis earlier this month after
having trouble breathing. Results of his medical tests were not
released.
   Marcos and his wife face U.S. racketeering charges accusing them
of diverting more than $100 million from their homeland to U.S.
investments. Mrs. Marcos pleaded innocent to the charges Oct. 31.
   Cardiologist Francis Weld said in October that although Marcos
had various ailments, he was healthy enough to fly to New York. Weld
also said Marcos faked pain during a physical.

   Ferdinand Marcos' second hospital stay in three
weeks has not changed plans for a hearing on whether the deposed
Philippine president is well enough to travel for a court
appearance, a federal prosecutor said.
   ``We were in court yesterday (Thursday) to set a date for both
sides to present all the medical evidence they have as to his
ability to travel,'' Assistant U.S. Attorney Debra Livingston said
from New York. ``As far as we're concerned, we'll proceed.''
   The hearing, scheduled for Jan. 19, is to determine whether
Marcos must appear in a New York court for arraignment on federal
racketeering charges.
   Marcos, 71, was admitted to St. Francis Medical Center on
Thursday.
   He was in guarded condition Friday afternoon after suffering
``the second severe episode of congestive heart failure in a
month,'' according to hospital spokeswoman Norma Kop.
   Marcos was expected to remain hospitalized for several days for
more tests, said Marcos' aide Arturo Aruiza.
   ``We pray for him,'' Aruiza said.
   Marcos spent nine days in the hospital earlier this month after
complaining of trouble breathing. His doctors said Marcos suffers
from congestive heart failure, which means the heart is unable to
pump the amount of blood required by the body.
   Livingston refused to comment on requests that Marcos be allowed
to travel to Manila. But John Bartko, an attorney for Marcos,
downplayed the requests.
   ``You have to realize those remarks and desires are coming from
family members and friends who are concerned about his health and
what is best for him,'' said Bartko. ``That's based on emotion, not
on legal aspects of the case.''
   Marcos and his wife, Imelda, are accused of stealing more than
$100 million from their homeland and stashing it in the United
States. Mrs. Marcos traveled to New York and pleaded innocent to the
charges Oct. 31.
   The Marcoses have been living in exile in Hawaii since they were
ousted in a civilian-military revolt in February 1986.
   A court-appointed physician, Francis Weld of New York, determined
that although Marcos suffers a number of ailments, he was healthy
enough to make the trip. Weld also said Marcos faked pain during the
examination Oct. 31.
   Tomas Gomez, the Philippine consul general in Hawaii, charged
Marcos was faking his illness to gain public sympathy and stall the
case against him.
   Livingston said she did not know whether Marcos would undergo
another physical by court-appointed doctors.

<TEXT>
   Sculptor Isamu Noguchi, whose work bridged East
and West and included delicate paper lamps, massive boulderlike
sculptures and serene gardens, has died at age 84.
   Noguchi, the son of a Japanese poet and an American writer, died
early Friday at New York University Medical Center of heart failure.
   ``He was a paramount and essential figure in the evolution of
20th-century sculpture,'' said Martin Friedman, director of the
Walker Art Center in Minneapolis. ``He was a person of incredible
vitality and restless curiosity, constantly seeking to generate new
projects and ideas.''
   Noguchi caught a bad cold in Italy early this month and suffered
complications, said Allen Wardwell, director of the Isamu Noguchi
Garden Museum in New York, which opened in 1984 and where the artist
maintained a studio.
   Noguchi was best known for his distinctive sculptures, often of
smooth rock in natural shapes that recall primitive crafts, and for
some surrealistic paintings.
   ``Isamu Noguchi stood for perfection,'' said Thomas Messer, the
retired director of the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum in New York.
``His art, deeply rooted in tradition, kept reiterating the
underlying wisdom and the verities of life.''
   In his sculpture, Noguchi maintained a reverence for the
materials with which he worked. Whether designing furniture and
lamps, stage sets for modern dance, gardens, fountains or
playgrounds, his sensitivity to surroundings was legendary.
   ``For me it is the direct contact of artist to material which is
original, and it is the earth and his contact to it which will free
him of the artificiality of the present and his dependence on
industrial products,'' he wrote in 1985.
   His works included the spacious Hart Plaza on Detroit's
riverfront, the UNESCO garden in Paris, the Billy Rose Sculpture
Garden in Jerusalem and two bridges for Hiroshima's Peace Park.
   In New York, his works include a 28-foot red cube that stands on
its corner in front of a lower Manhattan bank, the Sunken Garden at
Chase Manhattan Plaza and the stainless steel bas relief of five
journalists, installed above the door of The Associated Press
Building in Rockefeller Center.
   Noguchi's work is included in the permanent collections of many
of the world's major museums.
   At the time of his death, he was working on several large marble
sculptures and other projects, including the Bayfront Park in Miami,
a memorial to the Challenger astronauts.
   Noguchi was a New Yorker, but spent much of his time in Japan,
including his formative years.
   He was born in Los Angeles on Nov. 17, 1904, but two years later
went to Tokyo with his family. He returned alone to the United
States in 1918 and went to school in Indiana.
   After studying briefly with Gutzon Borglum, the sculptor of Mount
Rushmore, Noguchi entered Columbia University as a premedical
student in 1922, but dropped out in favor of sculpture studies at
the Leonardo Da Vinci Art School, now defunct.
   He moved to Paris in 1928 and worked as a studio assistant for
Constantin Brancusi for six months. Noguchi returned to New York in
1929 and had his first one-man show at the Eugene Schoen Gallery.
Later fellowships allowed him to travel to Japan and China, where he
studied drawing, ink-brush painting and pottery.
   He designed the first set used by the Martha Graham Dance Company
in 1935, beginning a lifelong collaboration. Ms. Graham once said,
``Whatever he did in those sets he did as a Zen garden does it, back
to the fundamental of life, of ritual.''
   During his long, prolific career, Noguchi worked in many
materials, including wood, ceramic, iron, bronze and galvanized
steel. But his major sculptures are made of stone: basalt, granite
and marble.
   Noguchi was married briefly in the 1950s to Japanese actress
Yoshiko Yamaguchi. They had no children. He is survived by a sister,
Ailes Spindem of Santa Fe, N.M., and two half-brothers, Michio
Noguchi and Tomiji Noguchi of Japan.

<HEAD>U.S. Serviceman, Boy Killed In Firecracker Explosion</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MANILA, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A homemade firecracker exploded in a
home, killing a U.S. serviceman and a 10-year-old Filipino boy,
police and U.S. officials said today. Four others were wounded.
   Col. Cecil Ross, spokesman for the U.S.-run Clark Air Base, said
the accident occurred late Friday just outside the base, about 50
miles northwest of Manila.
   Ross would not release the name of the 29-year-old serviceman or
his hometown pending notification of next of kin.
   But police in Angeles City, adjacent to the base, identified the
dead as Sgt. Michael Kaleda, assigned to Clark's Aircraft
Generations Squadron, and Gilbert Gaspar, a relative of the
serviceman's Filipino wife.
   The wounded included the serviceman's 7-year-old son Kevin and
three of his wife's relatives, police added.
   Police Lt. Col. Cesar Ocampo said Kaleda was making a firecraker
at home, apparently for use during New Year celebrations, when it
exploded prematurely. Ocampo said the firecracker, packed with
gunpowder, was about three inches in diameter and a foot long.
   On Thursday, an explosion at a clandestine firecracker factory in
the nearby province of Bulacan killed 11 people and injured dozens
more.
   Earlier this month fire engulfed a ferry boat with more than 200
people aboard after a cargo of fireworks exploded. One woman was
killed, officials said.
   The manufacture and sale of firecrackers were banned in 1966
after a fire that started in a fireworks factory killed 26 people in
the Bulacan town of Meycauayan.
   Despite the ban, the manufacture and sale of fireworks continue
openly. Officials say they cannot enforce the ban because the use of
fireworks is a tradition among Filipinos to usher in the New Year
and celebrate other feasts.

<TEXT>
   The government must rely on more than
undocumented suspicions before testing for drug use, said a judge
who barred a federal testing program for 3 million interstate truck
and bus drivers.
   U.S. District Judge Marilyn Hall Patel on Friday said she found
no conclusive evidence of drug use ``to support the broad, sweeping,
intrusive'' random testing that was to become mandatory next
December.
   ``The mere fact that there's a perceived problem doesn't mean the
government can use a scattershot approach'' that isn't narrowly
drawn to attack documented misconduct, Patel said. She said the
government's only evidence of drug use was ``anecdotal and
impressionistic'' reports, plus one flawed study.
   She issued a preliminary injunction against plans for random drug
testing and mandatory testing of drivers involved in accidents. She
did not block other regulations that will require pre-employment
testing, drug testing at periodic physical examinations, and testing
based on a reasonable suspicion that a driver is using drugs.
   Patel's order does not immediately forbid any drug testing,
because mandatory testing under the Department of Transportation
program was not to take effect until Dec. 21, 1989. Before then, her
ruling may be tested in the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, and
could also be affected by pending Supreme Court decisions in two
other drug testing cases.
   But the judge also blocked some of the department's regulations
from taking effect, and lawyers for truck drivers said the action
would have a short-term impact on testing programs set up
voluntarily by trucking companies.
   For example, said attorney Jeffrey King, under department rules
that were to take effect last week, any trucker who refused to take
a drug test under a company testing program would be prohibited from
driving for any interstate hauler. Those rules were blocked by
Patel's order, he said.
   Justice Department lawyer Brian Kennedy had a different
interpretation, telling reporters that any voluntary program that
would have been authorized by the new federal rules was already
permitted under previous law.
   The programs cover the majority of more than 4 million
transportation workers who would be affected by drug testing
programs announced Nov. 14 by Transportation Secretary James Burnley.
   The remaining 1 million-plus workers are in the airline, railroad
and maritime industries, along with in-state bus drivers. Railroad
unions have filed a separate suit against their testing program.
   The programs for interstate truck and bus drivers were challenged
by the Owner-Operator Independent Drivers Association of America, a
group of 9,000 owners and drivers of heavy-duty trucks and small
truck fleets.
   As in other suits against drug programs, the truckers contended
that testing without evidence that an individual driver is impaired
by drugs violates the constitutional ban on unreasonable searches.
   ``We are most concerned with random testing because random
testing assumes that a person is guilty,'' said Michael O'Connell, a
lawyer for the owner-operators.

were in the apartment house at the time of the fire. According to
Kyodo News Service, most of the residents were elderly.
   The police official said two residents were hospitalized with
injuries.

<HEAD>Authorities Reconsider Expulsion Order For Kurds</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MATTI HUUHTANEN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>HELSINKI, Finland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bowing to pressure from humanitarian
groups, authorities agreed to reconsider their order to expel eight
Turkish Kurds seeking political asylum, refugee officials said.
   Amnesty International and the Finnish Red Cross joined appeals on
behalf of the Kurds, who were on a hunger strike in jail.
   Finnish television and several newspapers said Friday that the
authorities agreed to study the case again. Refugee officials, who
spoke on condition of anonymity, confirmed the report but declined
to elaborate.
   The eight Kurds ``would face certain persecution if sent back to
Turkey,'' said Tuula Kojo, spokesman for a group formed to keep the
Kurds in Finland, which has one of the strictest immigration
policies in Europe.
   Kojo said all had a history of trouble at home, which should
justify their asylum requests. He did not say if the Kurds were
members of the outlawed Kurdish Labor Party, which has fought a
four-year guerrilla war to set up an independent Marxist state in
parts of eastern and southeastern Turkey.
   Kurds are a stateless minority of about 20 million living mainly
in Iraq and Turkey.
   The eight Kurds arrived in Helsinki by ferry from Poland on Nov
1. They were allowed to stay in a suburban refugee center until
Tuesday, when the Aliens Office decided to deport them. The Kurds
refused to leave the center, and were jailed.
   Seppo Tiitinen, head of the security police _ which reviews all
asylum applications _ said earlier this week the Kurds had not
``been able to demonstrate in any way that they had reason to fear
persecution if returned to their own country.''
   The director of the Aliens Office, Matti Backman, refused
comment, saying, ``It could endanger the persons in question.''
   Leading Finnish politicians and public figures have been critical
of Finland's refugee policy in the past. Last year the archbishop of
the Finnish Lutheran Church, John Vikstrom, accused the government
of being ``two-faced over the issue of refugees.''
   The Finns, a people of 4.9 million in a country the size of
Britain, have granted political asylum to four cases from 60
applicants this year. Eleven were given residence permits, 13 cases
were pending and the rest were rejected or withdrawn, the Aliens
Office said.
   Neighboring Sweden, by contrast, gave political asylum to 16,000
refugees.

   The remains of two U.S. Army
privates who died in the bombing of a Pan Am airliner over Scotland
arrived early today and were honored at a brief ceremony.
   An eight-man U.S. Air Force honor guard carried the flag-draped
coffins of Spec. 4 Michael G. Stinnett and Spec. 4 Douglas E.
Malicote, and loaded them into hearses after the base chaplain read
Scriptures and said a prayer.
   Malicote and Stinnett were among the 259 passengers killed when
the jetliner bound for the United States exploded and crashed Dec.
21.
   The remains were the first two military victims from the crash to
arrive at Dover Air Force Base, the largest mortuary operated by the
military.
   In a suburb of Dayton, Ohio, about 250 mourners on Friday filed
past caskets decorated with flowers and photographs of a professor,
his wife, and their two grandchildren, who perished in the crash.
   Stinnett, 23, of Wiesbaden, West Germany, was born in San Diego,
Calif. He was assigned to headquarters command, 12th Aviation
Battalion. His wife, Charlotte, and stepdaughter, Stacy Bell, were
also killed in the crash but their remains have yet to be identified.
   Malicote, 22, of Lebanon, Ohio, had been stationed with the
Army's 94th Signal Battalion in Mannheim, West Germany, for four
years. His wife, Wendy, 21, was also on board. Her remains have not
been identified.
   The remains were brought to Dover to be prepared for burial. The
mortuary handles the bodies of servicemen and their dependents who
die in Europe, the Azores, Iceland and Greenland.
   In Kittering, Ohio, solemn Indian music played Friday as mourners
wept during services for home for Om Dikshit, 55, his wife, Shanti,
53, and their grandchildren, Suruchi Rattan, 3, and Anmol Rattan, 2,
of Detroit. Dikshit, a native of India, was a professor at Central
State University in Wilberforce.
   In Westminster, Calif., the flight engineer of Pan Am Flight 103,
Jerry Avritt, 46, was eulogized Friday at a funeral Mass as a
devoted family man.
   Avritt's brother-in-law Jerry Nibler said people should dismiss
any ``eye-for-an-eye and a tooth-for-a-tooth'' sentiments. The Rev.
Bill Vohsing also dismissed thoughts of revenge for terrorists,
saying, ``It's easy to love your family but hard to love your
enemy.''
   Thirteen bodies have been returned to the United States since
Wednesday.

   Bitter cold set in from northwest Wisconsin to eastern North
Dakota and in parts of the Rockies, with readings below zero in many
places.
   Mild 60-degree weather prevailed across the Gulf Coast, where
rain was heavy in places. Meridian, Miss., recorded 1.84 inches of

   Rain and fog covered much of the South today from Texas across
the Gulf Coast to Georgia and northern Florida, and extended as far
north as the Middle Atlantic states.
   A moist Pacific air mass was bringing precipitation into the Far
West and northern Rockies Friday evening. Moderate rain fell along
much of the Pacific Coast. The rain was mixed with snow in the
inland valleys of Northern California while snow alone was falling
at higher elevations in the coastal states.
   Snow advisories were in effect for the western Nevada mountains,
the northern Sierra Nevada in California and the Cascades and
Siskiyous of Oregon, as well as the mountains and southwest valleys
of Idaho and the mountains of northwest Wyoming. Up to 10 inches was

   Snow also was reported in North Dakota and northern Michigan.
   A freeze warning was in effect for the deserts of southwest and
south central Arizona this morning.
   The high in the nation friday was 85 degrees at fort myers fl.
   Today's forecast called for scattered showers and thunderstorms
from the Gulf Coast across the Tennessee Valley to the southern
Atlantic Coast, and along the West Coast. Snow was expected to
extend from parts of Nevada, Idaho and Oregon across the northern
Rockies to North Dakota and northern Minnesota, as well as in
northern New England.
   Highs were predicted to be in the single digits and teens from
Montana to Upper Michigan and in northern Maine; in the 20s and 30s
in the Plateau region, the central Rockies, and from the northern
Plains across the Great Lakes to southern New England; in the 60s
and 70s from southern South Carolina across the Gulf Coast states to
southern Texas, and in southwest Arizona; and in the lower 80s in
the southern tip of Texas and the southern half of Florida. Highs
elsewhere were forecast to be in the 40s and 50s.
   At 2 a.m. EST, temperatures ranged from 11 degrees below zero at
Grand Forks, N.D., to 74 degrees at Key West Naval Air Station, Fla.

   Airports across Asia have tightened
security after a warning that Palestinian terrorists plan to attack
a commercial airliner in the region by Jan. 10, officials said today.
   The heightened security follows the Dec. 21 bombing of Pan Am
Flight 103 over Scotland that killed 270 people. Suspicion has
centered on radical Palestinian or pro-Iranian groups.
   Rolando Estabillo, spokesman for Philippine Air Lines, said Air
India informed regional carriers last week that terrorists may try
to hijack or blow up an Asian plane.
   Air India and the Indian government's Civil Aviation
Administration declined comment on the report. But airports in New
Delhi, Calcutta, Bombay and Madras were placed on maximum alert.
   Stricter security measures also were reported at airports in
Manila, Tokyo, Hong Kong, Taipei, Taiwan and Dhaka, Bangladesh.
   At Tokyo's Narita Airport, an Air India official, speaking on
condition of anonymity, said the information came from Indian
government intelligence sources.
   Mauri Leppala, head of the Tokyo airport's Airlines Operations
Committee, said the threat was not directed against a specific
carrier but was being taken seriously because of the Pan Am bombing.
   He said the names of about 10 people identified as potential
terrorists had been distributed to airlines and immigration
officials.
   Gen. Cyril Ranatunga, chairman of the Sri Lankan airports
authority, said the warning identified the potential terrorists as
Palestinian.
   NBC News reported Friday that the alleged terrorists were linked
to Abu Musa, whose real name is Said Musa, a Syrian- and
Libyan-backed Palestinian leader who broke with PLO chief Yasser
Arafat in 1983.
   In Hong Kong, a police spokesman said security had been increased
at Kai Tak Airport ``in light of reports received,'' but did not
elaborate.
   Lu Shen-Fang, a public relations officer for Taiwan's China
Airlines, said security had also been tightened at Taipei airport
although she added the airline had received no specific threats.
   But an official of China Airlines in Hong Kong, speaking on
condition of anonymity, said the airline security division alerted
its stations to be on the lookout for passengers carrying passports
from India, Pakistan and Middle Eastern countries.
   In Manila, Brig. Gen. Carmelito Beltran said an additional
Special Weapons and Tactics Team had been deployed at Ninoy Aquino
International Airport and additional security checks begun for all
international flights.
   ``There are persistent reports of a possible bomb attack on an
Asian airport,'' Beltran said. ``We cannot pinpoint which group is
going to do the attack. These are international terrorists. We are
prepared.''
   Beltran said Filipino authorities received a tip that a ``known
terrorist'' may have slipped into the Philippines within the past
two weeks. But he said authorities were unsure of the person's
nationality or affiliation. An estimated 40,000 Palestinians reside
in the Philippines.
   In Washington, State Department spokeswoman Phyllis Oakley said
the department was aware of the reported warning, which she said was
one of hundreds received by the airlines.

<TEXT>
   South Asian leaders today ended a
three-day summit pledging to remedy some of the world's worst
poverty, while talks between leaders of rivals Pakistan and India
raised hopes of regional peace.
   The seven nations of the South Asia Association on Regional
Cooperation, with a combined population of 1.1 billion, took aim at
spiraling military costs, growing protectionist sentiment among
developed nations and a burgeoning drug trafficking problem.
   The group released a declaration on a regional plan of action
that promised visible results by the year 2000 on these issues,
including the harsh poverty that affects much of the impoverished
area.
   Dominating the summit, however, was the meeting between
Pakistan's Benazir Bhutto and Indian Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi.
One Indian official said the two were ``getting along famously,''
but few details emerged from their talks.
   Gandhi is the first Indian leader to meet a Pakistani prime
minister in Pakistan since his grandfather Jawaharlal Nehru met
President Ayub Khan in 1960.
   Relations between the two nations have been volatile since
partition in 1947. They have fought three wars since then, and
maintain tens of thousands of soldiers along their border.
   Ms. Bhutto, 35, promised to move Islamic Pakistan and mainly
Hindu India onto friendlier footing through trust and goodwill.
   ``I don't doubt the intentions of my neighbor and in fact I think
that there is a wonderful opportunity for giving peace momentum,''
she said before the summit began.
   The Indian official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the
two leaders agreed not to attack each other's nuclear facilities.
The official also said they agreed to increase cultural exchanges
and reduce trade barriers.
   The Pakistanis had no comment on the talks.
   India's known nuclear weapon's program and Pakistan's suspected
nuclear arms capability have been a major stumbling block to
friendlier ties.
   The alliance's declaration supported an end to the nuclear arms
race and elimination of nuclear weapons, but it did not refer to
India and Pakistan by name.
   The statement also urged rapid completion of studies such as one
on the causes of natural disasters and the environment.
   Bangladesh's president, Hussain Muhammad Ershad, called for
regional efforts to cope with natural disasters, such as the floods
and cyclones that killed an estimated 3,000 people in his country
this year.
   ``Your personal role and contribution to this process cannot be
over-emphasized,'' Ershad said.
   The seven nations in the alliance are Bangladesh, Bhutan, India,
the Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka.

   Young, 24, and Sharp, 25, met while attending a meeting of the
Nebraska Society of New York, a group of former Nebraskans who get
together monthly.
   They were to be married today at First-Plymouth Congregational
Church. Young's father, the Rev. Otis Young, will officiate.
   Young, a graduate of Lincoln Southeast High School, has degrees
in engineering and computer science from the University of Southern
California. He took a job in 1987 with AT&T's Bell Labs in Holmdel,
N.J.
   Sharp, a Lincoln High graduate, attended the University of
Nebraska-Lincoln, then went to the New York City area two years ago
for a summer job as a nanny. She stayed and became a legal assistant.
   The two attended their first Nebraska Society meeting in the hope
of finding a friendly face in the big city.
   ``New York is a very difficult place to meet people,'' said
Sharp, adding that the Nebraska Society provided a place for people
with common values and backgrounds to get together.
   After the wedding, they plan to stay in the New York City area
and continue their membership in the Nebraska Society. But they
haven't given up on the idea of returning to the Midwest someday.

   The worst Christmas for Richard Nichols
turned into one of the best when he learned that two brothers had
found nearly $4,000 in Christmas gifts and belongings that fell off
his family's car.
   ``I just about died,'' Nichols recalled when he heard the message
on his answering machine that the items and the rack on which the
belongings were carried had been found.
   The rack and its cargo had spilled from his 1984 Ford Bronco
Monday night as the family drove 80 miles between relatives' homes.
   They checked the rack once en route, but when they arrived, it
was gone.
   Nichols retraced the route in the back of a pickup truck with a
spotlight.
   No luck.
   He asked the Washington State Patrol and the state Department of
Transportation to look for his belongings.
   Again, no luck.
   On Tuesday evening, he called into his home answering machine for
messages.
   ``I couldn't believe it,'' he said.
   Chris Moore, 18, and his brother, Joe, 23, were driving in the
area no more than 15 minutes after the mishap and picked everything
up. One piece of baggage carried Nichols' telephone number, which
they called.

   A policeman was fatally shot through the
armhole of his bulletproof vest as he tried to serve an arrest
warrant, and the suspect was in critical condition today after a
second shootout with police, authorities said.
   Officer Porfirio Soto Jr., 25, died Friday at Tampa General
Hospital, about an hour after he wrestled with the suspect.
   Soto and another officer were attempting to serve Jackie Lewis
Simpson with an arrest warrant charging him with armed robbery,
aggravated battery and carrying a concealed firearm in connection
with a Christmas Day incident.
   Police said Simpson pulled a .38-caliber revolver and shot Soto
as they struggled. Officer Charlotte R. Johnston exchanged gunfire
with Simpson before he fled in an auto.
   Less than four hours later, police arrested Simpson after a chase
during which Simpson's vehicle rammed two police cars before
stalling.
   Simpson, 36, allegedly started shooting at an officer who pulled
in front of him, and police returned fire, The Tampa Tribune
reported.
   He was in critical condition early today at Tampa General
Hospital, with gunshot wounds to his left shoulder, lower buttock
area and abdomen, hospital officials said.
   Soto, who had been on the force since July 1987, was the first
on-duty policeman killed in five years. He was the 19th Tampa
officer to die on the job.

<TEXT>
   Supporters of Jean Harris, the headmistress
serving time for the 1980 murder of Scarsdale Diet author Dr. Herman
Tarnower, vowed to fight on for her release despite a denial of
clemency by Gov. Mario Cuomo.
   ``If she doesn't die of a broken heart or have another heart
attack, we'll be back again next year begging for mercy,'' said
Michael Kennedy, Harris' Manhattan attorney.
   Harris, 65, has suffered at least one heart attack while serving
15 years to life for slaying her lover.
   Kennedy said he talked to Harris Friday afternoon shortly after
she learned her clemency plea had been denied.
   ``Oh, my God, Michael. I'm so sad,'' he quoted her as saying.
   But the lawyer said Harris was determined not to give up.
   Friends and relatives of the former director of an exclusive
Virginia girls' school had mounted a 25,000-signature petition
appeal on her behalf.
   Cuomo, who regularly grants clemencies during the Christmas-New
Year's season, received 526 applications and granted clemency for
two state prison inmates, both serving 15 years to life on drug sale
charges.
   Cuomo spokeswoman Anne Crowley declined to discuss the Harris
case except to say clemency had been denied. Harris is eligible to
reapply for clemency in one year.
   ``I feel bad for her,'' said Russell Leggett, the retired state
Supreme Court judge who sentenced Harris and had recommended her for
clemency.
   ``She committed one violent act in her whole life and it was
committed under extreme emotional disturbance. ... Society does not
gain a thing by her continued confinement,'' he said.
   Harris has maintained she meant to kill herself and not Tarnower
on March 10, 1980. Upset because he had taken up with a younger
woman, Harris wound up shooting Tarnower four times and said it was
an accident.
   During her almost eight years in prison, Harris has been active
in its Children's Center, has taught fellow inmates and has written
two books.
   David Harris, the eldest of her two sons, called Cuomo's denial
``a political decision'' connected to what he said were the
governor's presidential ambitions.
   ``I think when he sees her name, he sees Willie Horton,'' the son
said. ``If he's going to be president, from a political standpoint,
she could be a liability.''
   Horton is the Massachusetts state prison inmate who, while out on
furlough, raped a Maryland woman and beat her husband. Vice
President George Bush used the Horton furlough issue in his
presidential campaign against Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis.
   Alice Lacey, secretary of the Monroe, N.H.-based Jean Harris
Legal Defense Committee, said Harris was ``deeply discouraged'' when
they spoke after news of the denial.
   ``We'll work with all our hearts for the next time,'' Lacey
pledged.

   Michigan, home of the Big Three automakers,
will no longer invest state pension funds in two of the automobile
companies because they have business ties to South Africa, said
state Treasurer Robert Bowman.
   Bowman said General Motors Corp. and Ford Motor Co. are among 172
firms from which $5 billion in state pension funds must be withdrawn
over the next five years because of a state law restricting
investments in companies with ties to South Africa.
   ``Ford and GM have both taken large steps in the last few months
to move closer to disassociating themselves with the Republic of
South Africa, but it will indeed curtail our investments both in GM
and Ford,'' he said Friday, adding he hopes the law will lead the
firms to change their practices.
   ``We are adding our voice, a large voice, to a growing chorus of
those who say something has got to change over there.''
   Bowman said the third automaker, Chrysler Corp., has no
operations in South Africa.
   General Motors spokeswoman Karen Longridge said the company would
have no comment until Tuesday.
   Ford spokesman Tom Foote said the company would not have any
reaction to the state's announcement.
   A sponsor of the new law downplayed the impact on the two large
employers and the state's economy.
   ``The fact is by and large those companies have been moving jobs
out of Michigan, decreasing employment in this state,'' said Rep.
Perry Bullard, D-Ann Arbor, adding that state funds will be freed
for investment in other Michigan firms.
   The state currently has $1.25 billion invested in Ford and
General Motors which must be sold over the next five years because
of the law, Bowman said.
   In addition to requiring divestiture of current investments, the
law, which takes effect Sunday, also bans new investments in firms
doing business in South Africa until the companies drop their
associations in South Africa or the country ends its apartheid
policy.
   Besides General Motors and Ford, Bowman said Michigan-based
Kellogg Co., Unisys and Upjohn Co. are on the list of firms known to
have South African ties, but he said state investments in those are
small.
   Bowman said state officials will urge the companies to end
operations in South Africa.
   ``We're not telling them they are doing something evil or
malicious. We're telling them we'd like them to change and until
they do change, we're not going to be able to invest in them,'' he
said.

<HEAD>Political Vacillation Brought Down Government, Paper Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SLOBODAN LEKIC</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A leading newspaper today criticized
Premier Branko Mikulic, saying his ``vacilliating policies'' led to
economic ruin and political unrest.
   Mikulic's 31-member Cabinet tendered its resignation earlier
Friday in reaction to increased opposition to its handling of a
crisis that has sent annual inflation soaring to 250 percent and the
foreign debt to $21 billion.
   The demise of the government, unprecedented since the Communists
came to power after World War II, came two days after Parliament
refused to pass a law that would have sharply curbed public spending.
   ``The government had (actually) lost the support of the political
structures from which its premier had emerged,'' said Radio
Ljublijana on Friday.
   The Belgrade daily Politika in today's editions offered a harsher
assessment.
   Mikulic's ``vacillating policies have led to the impoverishment
of the economy and have thrown a significant segment of the
population to the edge of intolerable'' poverty, it said.
   Politika customarily reflects the views of Serbia's Communist
leader Slobodan Milosevic, a man hailed by supporters as the strong
politician Yugoslavia needs to get it out of its present crisis.
   The annual inflation rate has tripled from 84 percent in 1986,
when Mikulic came to power. The real value of the average monthly
salary has dropped, and living standards have plummeted to half the
1980 level.
   A record number of strikes have plagued Mikulic's term in office.
   In Yugoslavia's complicated political system, the federal
government is generally responsible for economic policy while the
presidency, which appoints the premier, dictates defense and foreign
policies.
   In order to fend off raising public discontent, the leaders of
Yugoslavia's six republics have increasingly taken to attacking
Mikulic and his cabinet and blaming them for economic ills.
   ``Numerous public statements by political officials have offered
the public a way out (of the crisis) through the resignation of the
government,''said Mikulic in his departing address to parliament on
Friday.
   ``But what programs do the others have to offer?'' he asked.

   Some homeless people could face arrest after a
federal judge rejected an American Civil Liberties Union contention
that police were selectively enforcing misdemeanor laws to get the
poor off the streets.
   ``The police are going to do their duty and follow the law,''
said Assistant City Attorney Leon Firtel, who argued against the
ACLU in court. ``If they have probable cause to arrest someone, they
will go ahead and do that.''
   The ACLU had argued that the homeless were being harassed by
police before weekend Orange Bowl activities so that the city would
look good for tourists and on national television for the Orange
Bowl Parade today.
   ACLU attorney Valerie Jonas had sought the injunction to block
police from enforcing misdemeanor laws she said were being used
selectively.
   ``When someone is sleeping on a piece of cardboard, they can be
arrested for littering,'' she said.
   But U.S. District Judge C. Clyde Atkins denied the injunction
Friday.
   Firtel said the decision probably did not allow time for an
appeal before the weekend.
   An estimated 10,000 homeless people live in Miami, and the city
offers no public shelters, though a new Miami Rescue Mission
building is preparing to open in January with beds for 250 men.

<HEAD>Dan-Air Flight Returns Safely To Gatwick After Smoke Spotted</HEAD>

   A Dan-Air jetliner with 268 passengers on board
returned safely to Gatwick Airport near London after smoke was
spotted in the galley during a flight to the Canary Islands, the
airline said today.
   The airport south of London was put on full emergency Friday
night after cabin crew on Dan-Air Flight 1802 smelled something
burning at the front of the Airbus A300, where food is stored, the
airline said.
   The smoke was spotted about 15 minutes after the plane left
Gatwick for Tenerife, one of the Spanish-ruled Canary Islands about
60 miles off the coast of North Africa, the airline said.
   ``In the interests of safety the captain decided to return,''
said a spokesman for the privately owned British carrier, who spoke
on condition of anonymity.
   The plane landed safely and the problem was traced to an
electrical fault, the spokesman said.
   In another incident today, a cargo plane landed safely at
Stanstead Airport north of London after its landing gear developed
problems, airport officials said.
   Thirty firefighters stood by as the four-man crew landed without
problems after a flight from Montpelier, France.
   Police said an inspection of the undercarriage revealed several
small parts _ including two three-inch bolts _ were missing.
   But Malcolm Ginsberg, a spokesman for the owners, Heavylift
Cargo, said: ``We haven't been able to establish anything at all
about parts being missing.''

<HEAD>Mubarak Says Shamir's Stance Rules Out Visit To Israel</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CAIRO, Egypt (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Hosni Mubarak was quoted in an
interview published today as saying Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak
Shamir's position on Middle East peace rules out an Egyptian-Israeli
summit.
   But Mubarak was also quoted in the state newspaper Al Messa as
saying he would be prepared to go to Israel should Shamir change his
stance.
   Mubarak cited Shamir's opposition to an international conference
as a framework for Arab-Israeli peace talks and his refusal to
relinquish any part of the territories Israel captured from Egypt
and Jordan during the 1967 war as the obstacles preventing such a
visit.
   In Kuwaiti and Japanese newspaper interviews this month, Mubarak
said he was prepared to go to Israel if this would help solve the
Palestinian problem. He did not at that time detail what he believed
Israel should do.
   In today's interview, he was more specific.
   ``I still say that I am ready to travel to Israel on condition
that this leads to real progress in the process to resolve the
Middle East issue,'' he was quoted as saying.
   ``For the visit to Israel to take place, Prime Minister Shamir
must say clearly what he will give to (solve) the problem. There
must be flexibility in the Israeli position and agreement on
convening an international conference.''
   Shamir opposes a proposed international conference with the
participation of the five permanent members of the U.N. Security
Council. He contends such a parley could force Israel into too many
concessions.
   ``Shamir has said `no' to an international conference and
declared his country will not give up an inch of the territories it
occupies,'' Mubarak was quoted as saying in Al Messa. ``On what
basis, then, shall I go to Israel? I cannot possibly go to concur in
the Israeli Prime Minister's statements.''
   Mubarak noted, however, that Egyptian-Israeli contacts at lower
levels ``are in existence and the dialogue has not been ruptured.''
   The two countries signed a peace treaty in 1979, the first
between an Arab country and the Jewish state. Mubarak has not
visited Israel since taking office in 1981.
   Israel conquered the West Bank and Gaza, where 1.7 million
Palestinians presently live, in the 1967 war. The West Bank included
East Jerusalem, which Israel has annexed.
   The Palestine Liberation Organization last month proclaimed an
independent state but the boundaries were never specifically noted.
   State Minister for Foreign Affairs Butros Ghali, in a statement
to reporters last week, made a Mubarak visit to Israel also
conditional on the Jewish state agreeing to open talks with the PLO,
something Israel has vowed never to do because it says the PLO is a
terrorist group.
   Mubarak did not mention the PLO in today's interview, but the
Egyptian position always has been that the organization should
participate in any peace talks.
   Recognition of Israel's right to exist and renunciation of
terrorism by PLO leader Yasser Arafat this month resulted in the
United States agreeing to open a dialogue with the PLO. Israel
condemned the American move.

<HEAD>Salvadoran Rightists Copy Chilean Leftist Anthem</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DOUGLAS GRANT MINE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An anthem used to defeat
right-wing President Augusto Pinochet of Chile has been copied by
Salvadoran rightists for March elections _ without the permission of
its creators.
   The ``use of elements from the campaign to defeat Pinochet are
completely unauthorized,'' said Andres Zaldivar, vice-president of
the Chilean Christian Democratic Party.
   The Republican Nationalist Alliance, or Arena, modified the
lyrics of ``We're going to say `No!''' to fit the Salvadoran
context, asking voters to reject five more years of Christian
Democratic rule. But it appropriated the tune and the catchy refrain
without the slightest change.
   Zaldivar objected to the change ``more so because Arena and
(presidential candidate) Alfredo Cristiani have clear connections
and sympathies with the Pinochet regime.''
   The song was the broadcast in the heart of the campaign to
prevent Pinochet from retaining Chile's presidency until 1997.
Chileans rejected Pinochet in the November referendum.
   ``We never thought they (the Christian Democrats) would get so
upset about that (the copying),'' Christiani said.
   Arena, which is leading the incumbent Christian Democrats in
polls before the March 19 presidential election, also copied a
Chilean opposition video, which shows people shaking their heads and
wagging their finger to indicate dissent.
   The Arena version used local citizens, but in poses and
situations virtually identical to those employed in the original.
   Christiani said his party's use of the Chilean material was ``a
satire to demonstrate the Christian Democrats' lack of creativity.''
Cristiani said the Salvadoran Christian Democrats routinely used
foreign ideas ``with slight changes'' in local campaigns.
   ``It is intellectual, political and ideological theft,'' said
Roberto Viera, Salvador's communications minister.
   Salvadoran political parties traditionally incorporate popular
songs into their campaigns by changing the tunes' lyrics. Both Arena
and the Christian Democrats have engaged in the practice.
   Viera made a distinction between the use of pop songs and Arena's
use of the Chilean jingle.
   ``The `No' song is one of definite ideological and political
commitment. It can be used only by those who have the same political
and ideological commitment,'' he said.
   Cristiani has held up Pinochet's Chile as a model of economic
development that El Salvador would do well to emulate.
   Viera contended that, because the Christian Democratic Party is
an an international organization, local Christian Democrats were in
effect part owners of the song Arena was now using against them.
   The Christian Democrats have for the past two nights broadcast
television spots denouncing the copycat propaganda.
   The Chilean and Arena versions are presented one after the other,
with a legend flashed across the bottom of the screen reading: ``No
to Pinochet equals No to Cristiani ... No to the robbery and
plagiarism of Arena.''

<HEAD>Murder Suspect In Palme Killing Ordered Kept In Detention</HEAD>
<DATELINE>STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A 41-year-old suspect in the killing of
Swedish Premier Olof Palme was ordered kept in detention today for
further questioning.
   The Stockholm district court approved the prosecutor's request
that Christer Pettersson be held until Jan. 13 awaiting formal
charges. He was arrested Dec. 14 and arraigned two days later,
bringing hopes that a hunt lasting almost three years had finally
produced a murder suspect.
   The hearing this morning was delayed almost 90 minutes when the
suspect refused to leave the jail in Osteraker, about 25 miles
outside Stockholm.
   Defense counsel Arne Liljeros said his client told him he did not
want to appear in front of the media.
   Pettersson, who has pleaded innocent, asked to be released.
   But after a hearing lasting less than 10 minutes behind closed
doors, the court said it approved chief prosecutor Anders Helin's
request for formal charges to be postponed two weeks while the state
completes its case. Prosecutors can extend his detention further by
showing cause.
   Liljeros said after the hearing that he felt the prosecutor's
evidence at present was not strong enough for them to go to trial,
the national news agency TT said.
   Palme, a four-term prime minister, was killed Feb. 28, 1986,
while walking home unguarded with his wife Lisbet from a late movie
in central Stockholm.
   According to accounts in the Swedish press, witnesses, including
his wife, have picked Pettersson out of a lineup as the man who was
loitering outside the movie theater, and then followed the couple
down the street and shot the premier at close range.
   But press reports indicate police have been frustrated in their
search for more proof, including the missing murder weapon, believed
to be a .357-caliber Magnum revolver.
   Public records show Pettersson has a history of psychatric
treatment, drug and alcohol abuse and other troubles with the law.
   His record includes a manslaughter conviction. He stabbed a drug
addict to death with a bayonet on a Stockholm street in 1970.

<DATELINE>SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A commission on self-esteem that gave
the nation another reason to poke fun at California when the panel
was created two years ago is finally getting some respect.
   Research, a growing mailing list and testimony by educators,
counselors, police, AIDS victims and gang members are lending
legitimacy to the commission's founding premise:
   Poor self-esteem is closely linked with alcoholism, drug abuse,
crime and violence, child abuse, teen-age pregnancy, prostitution,
chronic welfare dependency and failure of children to learn.
   Since the laughter died over Garry Trudeau's ``Doonesbury'' comic
strip naming the ``Boopsie'' character to the panel in early 1987,
the task force has started a series of public hearings, nurtured the
formation of 42 local commissions and served as a clearinghouse for
information on self-esteem.
   A survey of research by seven University of California professors
has been accepted for publication by the university press.
   ``I think we're now gaining a great deal of credibility,'' said
Bob Ball, executive director of the three-year, $750,000 California
Task Force to Promote Self-Esteem and Personal and Social
Responsibility.
   Forty-two of California's 58 counties have formed local
self-esteem task forces, including conservative rural counties in
the Sierra Nevada and the farm belt of the Central Valley.
   Trudeau's ``Boopsie,'' called the task force ``the first official
study of New Age thinking.''
   But legislation forming the task force received the blessing of
Republican Gov. George Deukmejian, a former state attorney general
with a tough-on-crime and ``common sense'' administration.
Republicans comprise a slight majority of the task force's 25
members.
   The task force's second annual report to the Legislature is due
Jan. 15. Its final report in January 1990 will make public policy
recommendations.
   Wilbur Brantley, a Sacramento real estate agent, former police
officer and one of 13 Republicans on the task force, said the panel
has no illusions about curing all social ills, but may recommend new
policies and programs that address low self-esteem as a cause of
many problems.
   ``You're going to find a lot of people who say, `We knew that all
along.' but if we really knew it why do we keep pouring money down
the so-called rat holes?'' he said. ``We keep spending money on
crime and violence. We keep spending money on drug abuse.''
   The panel's hearings have drawn testimony by small-business
owners in the timber-fishing town of Eureka near the Oregon border,
AIDS patients in San Francisco, and masked members of rival street
gangs in Los Angeles.
   Backers of the task force talk about its mission in a combination
of self-help psychology, social reform and bottom-line economic
terms.
   ``To settle for simply treating symptoms ... is to abandon
hope,'' Assemblyman John Vasconcellos said when he sponsored
legislation to create the task force.
   According to the 1986 bill, the state's 2 million adult
alcoholics and its $3 billion illicit drug trade cost the state
millions of dollars in medical expenses, lost productivity, law
enforcement and corrections.
   The state attorney general estimated that crime cost Californians
$6 billion in 1985. California has the nation's second highest
teen-age pregnancy rate of 14 percent, and highest teen abortion
rate, 6.9 percent.
   Susie Lange, a state Education Department representative to the
panel, said even task force members were skeptical about its
usefulness until the divergent group agreed on a definition of
self-esteem.
   ``We're not talking about selfishness,'' Lange said. ``If you
hate yourself you're going to have real trouble being helpful to
anyone else. If you reduce it to a much more simple understanding of
self-esteem, then you can get over that initial hurdle.''

<HEAD>Government Rejects Claim That Bomb Originated in Frankfurt</HEAD>
<HEAD>With PM-Crash, Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BONN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A government spokesman today rejected a
London newspaper report claiming the bomb that blew up Pan Am Flight
103 was put on board at Frankfurt airport.
   Interior Ministry spokesman Michael A. Butz dismissed the report
carried by today's Times of London as ``incorrect,'' and charged the
claim was based on speculation.
   The Times of London quoted anonymous sources as saying
investigators had determined that the baggage compartment where a
bomb exploded on Dec. 21, killing all 259 people aboard the
ill-fated flight, contained luggage loaded in Frankfurt. Another 11
people were missing and presumed dead on the ground.
   The newspaper said the investigation now is focused on Frankfurt,
``where a Palestinian terrorist cell is known to have been operating
for more than 18 months.''
   Butz told The Associated Press by telephone the newspaper's claim
was not grounded in fact.
   ``There is no indication that the explosives could have been put
on board at Frankfurt airport,'' Butz said.
   An official of the Bonn government, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, claimed investigators have made no determination that the
bomb originated in Frankfurt.
   He pointed out that the Frankfurt-to-London leg of the Pan Am
flight was one of more than 10 planes from which baggage was
transferred to the Boeing 747 that later exploded over Scotland.
   An Iranian extremist group has claimed responsibility for the
terrorist act, contending it was in retaliation for the U.S.
destruction in July of an Iranian passenger jet.
   West German investigators, however, have said other terrorist
groups are under suspicion, including Palestinian groups.

<HEAD>Brezhnev Relative Convicted in Bribery Trial, But Spared Death
Penalty</HEAD>

   Former President Leonid I. Brezhnev's son-in-law
has been convicted of bribery, but his lawyer expressed satisfaction
with the 12-year sentence, saying the Soviet Union is on the way
toward being a society based on law.
   The nearly four-month trial of Yuri Churbanov and eight of his
cronies focused on sensational allegations of wrongdoing stretching
all the way to the Kremlin's former first family.
   The tribunal on Friday found Churbanov guilty of taking nearly
$145,000 in bribes, but dismissed some charges, spared him the
firing squad and sentenced him to 12 years in a labor camp.
   Churbanov, 52, declined to talk to reporters afterward, but his
lawyer, Andrei Makarov, expressed satisfaction with the decision.
   ``You can agree or disagree with the sentence, but in substance
the throwing out of most of the charges leveled by the prosecutors
is indisputable,'' the lawyer told reporters.
   Makarov said the court's decision showed that the Soviet Union is
on the way to a society based on law. In an apparent reference to
trials under dictator Josef Stalin in which trumped-up charges were
used to get rid of real or perceived enemies, Makarov told reporters
this case proved that politics no longer has a place in the Soviet
courtroom.
   ``The trial rejected attempts to create a political trial from a
criminal case, and to replace evidence with hullaboo around the case
and attempts artificially to fire up public opinion,'' Makarov said.
   Churbanov served as first deputy Soviet interior minister, which
put him in the ranks of the few officials in charge of the nation's
police, for two years before Brezhnev died in 1982. He continued in
the job until 1984 and was arrested in January 1987.
   Under President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, Brezhnev has been harshly
criticized for fostering corruption and economic and cultural
stagnation during his 18-year rule. On Thursday, the Kremlin took
another swipe at Brezhnev by ordering that a plaque be removed from
his former home and that factories and schools be stripped of his
name.
   Churbanov married Brezhnev's daughter, Galina, in 1971 and was
accused of using his family ties to advance his career and extort
bribes.
   Churbanov originally faced the death penalty on charges he
accepted bribes of more than $1.1 million.
   But the military tribunal threw out some of the charges and
reduced the amount of bribes Churbanov was accused of taking to
about $145,000. The court also convicted Churbanov of siphoning more
than $16,000 in Interior Ministry funds to construction of a cellar
in his summer home.
   Prosecutors had recommended a 15-year sentence.
   Churbanov had pleaded guilty to abusing his office but innocent
to bribe-taking. In his one day of testimony, he said he kept a
briefcase handed to him stuffed with $160,000 because he ``felt
awkward'' about returning it.
   Churbanov's eight co-defendants were police officials from the
Central Asian republic of Uzbekistan, the focus of many reports of
rampant corruption.
   Six of the co-defendants were sentenced to labor camp terms
ranging from eight to 10 years.

   Mayor Edward I. Koch said he thought it was
necessary to punish Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. after it pleaded
guilty to securities fraud charges, so the city barred the firm from
co-managing a $500 million bond sale.
   The announcement came Friday, one day after a federal judge in
Boston stalled a Drexel-financed $970 million takeover effort of
Prime Computer Inc., because of what he called the disturbing
implications of a firm facing a $650 million criminal penalty acting
as investment banker for such a huge, debt-laden deal.
   Koch told reporters at City Hall that ``when a financial firm
that we do business with has been convicted because of financial
dealings, we ought to take some kind of action to show displeasure
and have them lose some money by being omitted from dealings with
the city on a one-time basis.''
   ``After that, they're back in contention like anybody else,''
Koch said. ``We've done it before and we're doing it now.''
   Drexel was to have been one of 16 participants in the New York
City bond sale, tentatively scheduled for February.
   The suspension is expected to cost Drexel about $300,000 in fees
and commissions, but the impact could be greater if other cities
follow New York's example.
   Drexel spokesman Steven S. Anreder called the action a
``temporary suspension'' that was in keeping with city policy, and
said there was no indication other cities would follow suit.
   Drexel received the first blow to its business in the wake of its
plea bargain on Thursday, when U.S. District Judge A. David Mazzone
in Boston said the $650 million proposed settlement of fraud charges
raised questions about Drexel's financial condition and its ability
to assist MAI Basic Four Inc.'s bid for Prime.
   Anreder said that Drexel was confident it could allay Mazzone's
concerns.
   Last week, Drexel agreed to plead guilty to six counts of mail,
wire and securities fraud to avoid a more serious indictment for
racketeering stemming from its relationship with the now imprisoned
financier Ivan Boesky.
   The company had said it had already lost $1.5 billion in business
and spent $175 million because of investigations by the Securities
and Exchange Commission and the U.S. attorney's office.

   Maria DeSillers says a nightmare is behind her now
that the state has dropped its criminal investigation into her
alleged misuse of almost $700,000 donated for her late son's liver
transplants.
   The state looked at charity solicitation statutes, as well as
grand theft and embezzlement laws, and decided Ms. DeSillers could
not be prosecuted, said Dade County State Attorney Janet Reno.
   ``We can't prove that when she solicited the funds, she intended
to defraud anyone,'' Ms. Reno said. ``And she and her ex-husband are
the legal heirs.''
   Ms. DeSillers' son, Ronnie, died last year at Children's Hospital
of Pittsburgh while awaiting a fourth liver transplant. His
condition and news that money collected for him was stolen from his
school quickly put the 7-year-old into the national spotlight.
   But controversy ensued as allegations surfaced that Ms. DeSillers
had spent the money collected on behalf of her son for jewelry,
clothes and a 1985 BMW car, as well as $79,000 in cash and payments
directly to herself, according to prosecutors.
   ``I might have made mistakes, nobody's perfect,'' Ms. DeSillers
said Friday. ``But it's the end of a nightmare.''
   Ms. Reno said that the case shows that new laws are needed to
prevent misuse of such donations.
   ``The laws just simply don't cover the situation that occurred
here,'' said Ms. Reno, who has urged for tough criminal penalties
and better procedures for cases like that of Ronnie DeSillers.
   Ms. DeSillers' attorney Roy Black welcomed the decision, saying
there had never been any evidence that Ms. DeSillers had tried to
defraud contributors to her son's fund.
   ``That's the end of the matter,'' Black said. ``Now you won't
hear from Maria DeSillers for a while.''
   The prosecutor's closing memo showed that Ms. DeSillers withdrew
$322,000 of the funds between Ronnie's death in April 1987 and March
1988.
   Along with the $79,000 in payments to herself, Ms. DeSillers
spent $35,500 on cash and payments to friends, $19,000 on
auto-related payments, $3,100 on a mobile telephone, $10,800 on
jewelry, $8,900 on clothes, $5,500 on furniture and $5,100 on her
apartment rent, the memo said.
   The memo also said she made $42,700 in payments on behalf of the
Ronnie DeSillers Foundation, $43,400 to sick children or their
families, $25,000 in legal fees and various other expenses.
   After Ronnie died, Ms. DeSillers refused to pay Children's
Hospital some of its bill, and her alleged misuse of the funds
became public.
   In subsequent civil actions, she was forced to relinquish many of
the items bought with the funds, including the car, and pay the bulk
of the hospital bill.

<HEAD>Soviet Union To Join Afghan Troops In Cease-Fire</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ANDREW KATELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Soviet Union announced today its troops will
join a cease-fire in Afghanistan on New Year's Day, but U.S.-backed
rebels vowed to keep fighting.
   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev had called for the truce in an
address to the United Nations, but the United States rejected it.
   On Friday, Alexander Bessmertnykh, a first deputy Soviet foreign
minister, met U.S. Ambassador Jack Matlock in Moscow to make another
push for U.S. support.
   ``The hope was expressed that the American side will look with
utmost attention at the new opportunities opening for Afghan
settlement,'' the official Tass news agency said of the meeting.
   Tass said Bessmertnkh also made the pitch to the ambassador from
Pakistan, which with the help of the United States supplies arms to
rebels fighting Afghanistan's Marxist government.
   Afghan President Najib on Friday offered the anti-communist
guerrillas a truce beginning Jan. 1, and the Soviet Foreign Ministry
said today in a statement carried by Tass that Moscow's troops will
follow suit.
   ``The Soviet Union fully supports this peace move of the Afghan
leadership and is stating, for its part, that all units of Soviet
troops that still remain in Afghanistan will cease fire from the
same date,'' the Foreign Ministry said.
   A rebel spokesman in Islamabad, Pakistan, dismissed the truce.
   ``We did not start our fight because he asked us to,'' said
Masood Khalili. ``And we won't stop because he asked us to.''
   The statement did not make clear how long Soviet troops would
hold their fire if the rebels don't stop shooting. Najib, however,
said Moslem insurgents will be given four days to accept the truce.
If they refuse, government troops will start shooting again, he said.
   Khalili belongs to the Jamiat-e-Islami guerrilla group whose
leader, Burhanuddin Rabbani, met in December with Soviet Deputy
Foreign Minister Yuli Vorontsov.
   The U.S.-backed guerrillas have been fighting Kabul's troops for
10 years. In December 1979, Soviet troops marched into Afghanistan
to bolster their allies.
   The Soviet Foreign Ministry said both sides should stop aiding
their allies in the war.
   ``Addressing specifically the United States, the Soviet side
again reaffirms its readiness on the basis of reciprocity to
discontinue all supply of arms to the warring sides in Afghanistan
from Jan. 1,'' the statement said.
   Secretary of State George P. Shultz has rejected the proposal,
noting that the Soviets rejected prior U.S. offers for mutual
cessation of outside aid. He said the rebels were justified in
trying to seize territory as the Soviets withdraw ``because the
people of Afghanistan, broadly speaking, do not accept the fact that
the puppet regime is entitled to hold certain areas of that
country.''
   A senior Western diplomat said the Soviets poured a huge amount
of military supplies into Afghanistan in preparation for the New
Year's aid cutoff and cease-fire.
   The seven-party Afghan guerrilla alliance, whose headquarters are
in Pakistan, rejected a cease-fire when Gorbachev offered it Dec. 7
in New York.
   Najib also declared a cease-fire that began Jan. 15, 1987, but
the insurgents ignored it and fighting continued.
   On May 15, the Soviet Union began withdrawing its estimated
100,000 soldiers from Afghanistan under a U.N.-brokered agreement.
Half of the Soviet troops have left the country and the remaining
half are to pull out by Feb. 15.
   But Soviet officials say they have suspended their troop
withdrawal temporarily because of continuing U.S. and Pakistani aid
to the rebels.

   What's expected to be the last edition of The Miami
News rolled off the presses this morning, after no last-minute deals
were made to keep the city's oldest daily newspaper alive.
   ``It's over,'' said Howard Kleinberg, the News' editor and an
employee for 38 years. ``I think we gave it a good effort.''
   ``Farewell, Miami,'' said the banner headline, and that was the
champagne toast led by publisher David Kraslow as corks were popped
in the newsroom when the last-edition copies were distributed to
dozens of staffers who gathered for the end shortly after 7 a.m.
   The only apparent way to give the News a reprieve would be a U.S.
Justice Department injunction. The department hadn't sought such an
injunction, but the newspaper, in a story on its own situation,
quoted spokesman Mark Sheehan as saying, ``Anything we can do today,
we can do tomorrow.''
   The afternoon daily publishes its Saturday editions in the
morning and has no Sunday edition. Kraslow said nearly two-thirds of
the newsroom staff had new jobs or other commitments to go to next
week. The newsroom staff numbered a little more than 100 in the
paper's final weeks.
   The owner of the News, Cox Enterprises of Atlanta, announced in
October that the afternoon newspaper would be closed Dec. 31 if it
was not sold. Cox cited finacial and circulation losses.
   A Cox official Friday defended efforts to sell the 92-year-old
paper.
   ``We sent out prospecti to 50 people,'' said David Easterly, who
heads Atlanta-based Cox's newspaper division. ``We made
presentations to 34.''
   Easterly said Friday there was no deal made with a Chicago
newspaper consultant representing a group of investors.
   U.S. District Judge Stanley Marcus on Friday also denied a
request for a preliminary injunction to keep the paper open.
   Meanwhile, a Justice Department investigation was under way
focusing on a joint operating agreement since 1966 between Cox and
Knight-Ridder Inc., owner of The Miami Herald, in which profits were
shared even if the News shut down.
   ``That amendment would make it financially beneficial to both
parties if the News goes out of business,'' wrote Charles F. Rule,
head of the antitrust division. ``Therefore the investigation deals
not only with how vigorous a search was made for potential buyers by
Cox, but how seriously negotiations were conducted once a potential
buyer was found.
   ``A conclusion that serious efforts by Cox would have resulted in
the sale of The Miami News could provide the basis for an antitrust
suit,'' his memo said.
   ``Press releases are not law,'' Easterly said. ``What they've
said is they're continuing to look into it.'' He said he had no
objection to that.
   Knight-Ridder officials said they were going over Rule's memo and
had no immediate comment.
   A last-ditch federal lawsuit to keep the paper open failed Friday
when Marcus rejected arguments from community newspapers who claim
closing the News will result in a monopoly for the Herald. The
plaintiffs also include readers and distributors of the News.
   ``The question is whether the government has the power to compel
a newspaper to publish if it wishes to be silent,'' Marcus said
during a two-hour hearing. The judge also questioned whether the
plaintiffs could show they stood to lose because of the paper's
closing.
   ``I'm disappointed the judge didn't see our point,'' said Michael
Miller, editor of the community newspapers. ``It's going to be a
pretty sad day come tomorrow.''
   Since the joint operating agreement began, the News' circulation
has dropped from 112,000 to 48,000. Under the agreement, the morning
Herald provides printing, circulation, advertising and promotion
services for the News.

   Troops killed a Palestinian during clashes with
mobs in a West Bank village and a 14-year-old boy died today after
an earlier clash. Ten people were reported wounded at his funeral.
   In the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip, residents observed a
general strike ordered by the Moslem fundamentalist group Hamas, the
chief rival of pro-PLO leaders of the Palestinian uprising.
   In the West Bank village of Beit Rima near Ramallah, residents
attacked an army patrol, an army spokesman said. Troops opened fire,
killing one man, he said, but did not give further details.
   Officials at Ramallah Hospital said they no one from Beit Rima
was brought there, and it was not clear what happened to the body.
   In Arab east Jerusalem, 14-year-old Anwar Buhti of the West Bank
village Shuweikah died early today at Mukassed Hospital, doctors and
army officials said. Buhti was shot in the head during a clash with
troops Dec. 7.
   In Shuweikah, hundreds of residents, some of them masked, joined
Buhti's funeral procession, Arab witnesses said. They chanted
pro-PLO slogans, and some hoisted black flags of mourning and
outlawed Palestinian flags.
   The boy's body was wrapped in a Palestinian flag, and his head
was covered by a black-and-white checkered keffiyeh, a traditional
headdress seen as a symbol of Palestinian nationalism.
   Troops opened fire to disperse the crowd, wounding 10 Shuweikah
residents ranging in age from 16 to 31, Arab hospital officials
said. The army confirmed eight wounded.
   The army later imposed a curfew on Shuweikah, 40 miles north of
Jerusalem.
   The two deaths brought to 344 the number of Palestinians killed
in the nearly 13-month-old uprising against Israeli occupation.
Fourteen Israelis have also died.
   Streets were deserted and stores shuttered in the occupied lands
as residents complied with the Hamas strike, called to express
solidarity with Palestinian detainees and deportees.
   The compliance marked a victory for Hamas, which has repeatedly
challenged the pro-PLO Unified National Leadership of the Uprising.
   In Gaza City and the southern town of Khan Yunis, activists glued
posters of PLO chief Yasser Arafat on walls.
   The army clamped a curfew on the Gaza Strip's eight refugee camps
and several villages, confining nearly 300,000 people to their homes.
   In the West Bank, masked Hamas followers marched through the
business district of Bethlehem and stuck pieces of wood into store
locks to prevent merchants from opening their shops.
   In Nablus, Palestinians spray-painted dozens of Palestinian flags
on walls.
   Wall graffiti in English read ``Long live the uprising'' and
``Let January 1 be a day of escalation against the Zionists.''
   Jan. 1 is known among Palestinians as ``Fatah Day.'' On Jan. 1,
1965, the mainstream Fatah faction of the PLO carried out its first
attack against Israel.
   In a leaflet issued by pro-PLO leaders, Palestinians were urged
to mark Fatah Day on Sunday with ``violent actions, stones,
firebombs and demonstrations against the occupation army.''

   Investigators say the bomb that detroyed a Pan Am
jumbo jet was placed aboard the doomed flight in Frankfurt, West
Germany, a British Newspaper reported today. West Germany denied the
report.
   ``There is no indication that the explosives could have been put
on board at Frankfurt airport,'' said Interior Ministry spokesman
Michael A. Butz.
   Also today, officials said security at Asian airports has been
increased after a warning that Palestinian terrorists plan to attack
a commercial jetliner in that region by Jan. 10.
   Crews extended their search for bodies and wreckage to the Solway
Firth estuary between Scotland and England, near where the Boeing
747 fell to earth Dec. 21. All 259 people aboard were killed, and an
estimated 11 people on the ground died.
   The Times of London, citing unidentified sources, reported that
investigators told Scottish police a bomb with two separate
detonating systems was put on Flight 103 in Frankfurt.
   It said the use of two detonators was to frustrate decompression
chambers installed at some airports, including Frankfurt, to
neutralize air pressure-sensitive devices.
   Investigators are certain that luggage loaded in Frankfurt and
flown to London's Heathrow Airport was transferred at Heathrow to
the forward cargo hold of the jet, The Times said. Flight 103
originated in Frankfurt, changing planes at Heathrow.
   Butz said British and West German investigators called the Times'
report contradictory to the evidence gathered.
   The newspaper said scientists established that the bomb exploded
in the hold, causing the New York-bound jumbo jet to disintegrate
Dec. 21.
   The newspaper said the hunt for those responsible centers on
Frankfurt, ``where a Palestinian terrorist cell is known to have
been operating for more than 18 months.''
   The newspaper said the cell is known to be part of Ahmed Jibril's
hard-line Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General
Command and to have carried out two bombing attacks on U.S. military
trains that serve Frankfurt.
   It said police were expected to be given access to a Palestinian
man arrested by West German security forces two months ago.
   The newspaper did not identify the man but said he is suspected
of being a senior figure in the Popular Front for the Liberation of
Palestine-General Command.
   The group, in a statement in Damascus on Friday, denied
involvement.
   Several British papers including The Daily Telegraph, The Times
and the Daily Express, said the FBI was investigating whether Kahlid
Jaafar, a 21-year-old Lebanese-born student killed in the crash, may
have been the unwitting carrier of he bomb.
   An unnamed associate of the Jaafar family was quoted as saying
Jaafar's mother, who lives in Damascus, is a first cousin of Syrian
President Hafez Assad.
   Jaafar lived in Frankfurt with a number of Lebanese-Arab
expatriates whome he did not know well, the Telegraph said.
   ``His are exactly the type of relationships that we will be
analyzing,'' The Times and The Telegragh quoted Neil Gallagher, head
of the FBI's counter-terrorism section as saying.
   Jaafar's father, Nazir Jaafer, dismissed the newspaper reports.
``I think that's outrageous and (a) totally false rumor,'' he said
in an Independent Television News interview.
   In Manila, Philippines, a spokesman for Philippine Airlines said
the airline received information from Air India on Dec. 21, the day
of the Pan Am bombing, warning Palestinian terrorists may try to
hijack an Asian airliner early next month.
   The spokesman, Rolando Estabillo, said the airline relayed the
report to its offices worldwide.
   Officials in Manila, Hong Kong and Taipei, Taiwan reported that
security had been tightened.
   American news agencies received a call Friday repeating a claim
that the pro-Iranian Guardians of the Islamic Revolution terrorist
group bombed the plane and threatened further attacks.
   The unidentified male caller said unless the United States
deports Reza Pahlavi, son of the late Shah of Iran, ``there will be
another present in the New Year for America.'' Pahlavi, 28, lives in
suburban Washington.
   The day after the jet crashed, a caller claimed the same group
took the action in retaliation for the downing of an Iran Air
airliner by a U.S. Navy cruiser in the Persian Gulf in July.
   In Kuwait, the daily Al-Seyasseh said today the PLO is
considering a U.S. request for help to help track down the bombers.
   Quoting an unidentified Palestinian source, the paper said the
U.S. request was addressed to Palestine Liberation Organization
chairman Yasser Arafat during in recent days. It did not elaborate.

   Sudanese ended a bloody four-day general
strike and returned to work today after the government canceled
steep price increases. Up to four people were reported killed during
the unrest.
   The Sudanese Workers' Trade Union Federation, with about 2
million members, ordered the return to work late Friday.
   The federation had demanded revocation of price increases of up
to 500 percent and a 15 percent across-the-board sales tax imposed
Monday. It also demanded that salary increases of 50 percent to 300
percent, decreed last week for public- and private-sector employees,
be retroactive to July 1 instead of Dec. 1 as the government wanted.
   In an emergency session Thursday, Prime Minister Sadek Mahdi's
Cabinet met the demands, but the demonstrations and strike continued
and spilled into Friday.
   Western military and diplomatic sources cited reports of up to
four dead and more than 26 wounded. The most serious incident was an
unexplained shooting in which witnesses said four men fired
submachine guns from a roof into a protesting crowd.
   No arrests were reported.
   The focus of the unrest turned to Mahdi's failure to endorse a
tentative peace accord that the Democratic Unionist Party, a junior
partner in the coalition Cabinet, signed with southern rebels Nov.
16.
   The agreement called for a constitutional peace conference to be
convened Dec. 31, with an immediate cease-fire in the 5{-year-old
civil war and suspension of Islamic law.
   The prime minister refused to bring the accord before the Cabinet
or the Parliament, fearing it would lead another coalition partner,
the fundamentalist National Islamic Front, to quit the government.
   The Front opposes any tampering with Islamic law, which is
opposed by many of the rebels.
   Electricity, water and air and land transportation services were
down during the general strike. Markets were empty, and bread and
vegetables disappeared. Both state television and radio were off the
air, and telephone and Telex communications were cut.
   As the dusty streets of the capital slowly returned to normal,
signs of the turmoil remained _ glass shards from smashed car
windshields, pieces of cement blocks and blackened remains of burned
tires.
   Khartoum International Airport reopened Friday. Telex lines were
restored this morning, but international telephone operators in
Cairo, Egypt, said telephone lines were still down.
   A Western military source said the army rejected a request by
el-Mahdi that army troops join riot police in quelling the
disturbances.
   ``There are many angry and frustrated generals in the army,
because the constitutional peace conference has not been held as
scheduled,'' the military source said. ``Even in the heat of the
demonstrations, they refused to intervene.''
   Besides Khartoum, rioting and the general strike hit other
provincial centers including Port Sudan, Gedaref, Kassala, Wad
Medani and Atbara.

   A tanker truck loaded with 43,000 pounds of
a hazardous chemical caught fire, forcing the evacuation of a
residential area in this New Orleans suburb and the closure of a
12-mile stretch of interstate highway today, authorities said.
   ``We have people from the hazardous material division and DEQ
(Department of Environmental Quality) on hand. It looks like it will
just have to burn itself out, though,'' said State Police Sgt. John
Adams.
   There were no reports of injuries.
   The truck was carrying sodium hydrosulfite, a material that can
produce irritating or poisonous gas as it burns, Adams said. He said
the material, even when it is not on fire, can burn the skin and is
harmful if inhaled.
   The truck driver, Richard C. Blanton of Nashville, Tenn., was
headed west on Interstate 12 about midnight when a motorist flagged
him down and told him the truck's trailer was on fire, state police
said. Blanton pulled over and unhitched the trailer, leaving it
beside the highway.
   Police said both lanes of the east-west interstate highway, which
runs north of Lake Pontchartrain, were still closed this morning.
   Residents within a one-mile radius of the fire were evacuated,
according to a spokesman for the Covington Sheriff's Office. Two
hospitals not far from the roadway were put on standby but had not
been evacuated as of daylight.
   Authorities did not have an immediate estimate of the number of
people affected by the evacuation order. The area evacuated is
mainly residential with some apartment complexes.
   The fire was expected to burn until at least early afternoon,
state police said.
   The chemical belonged to the Virginia Chemical Co., of
Portsmouth, Va., and was loaded at the Bucks, Ala., terminal, Adams
said.

   Communist China and the United States are
beginning a second decade of diplomatic relations in which exchanges
in every field have become routine but cultural and ideological
differences remain acute.
   It was Jan. 1, 1979, that Washington switched its recognition
from the Nationalist Chinese in exile on Taiwan to the Communists in
Beijing.
   The result has been an avalanche of exchanges, from dance to
trade to military consultations.
   Chinese now line up outside the U.S. Embassy visa office and
inside the Kentucky Fried Chicken on Tiananmen Square, dramatizing
the extent to which the United States, more than any other country,
has come to represent the outside world.
   Taxi drivers are more likely to be playing tapes of Madonna than
Peking opera. High officials are rumored to be fans of the American
television show ``Hunter,'' shown Thursday nights on Chinese
television.
   Tens of thousands of Chinese students have caught ``English
fever'' and most try to cultivate American accents.
   ``The United States has an influence not matched by any other
country,'' said Zi Zhongyun, director of the Institute of American
Studies at China's Academy of Social Sciences.
   The fascination runs both ways.
   More than 300,000 American tourists came to China in 1988, along
with one high school marching band, two Alaska musk oxen, dozens of
trade-hungry governors and mayors and more than 100 Santa Clauses
from an American volunteer group.
   But the terms of the relationship are changing even as the United
States gains in George Bush a president who Chinese hope will
understand them better than his predecessors. Bush was U.S. liaison
officer in China in 1974 and 1975.
   China is rapidly mending its nearly 30-year-old quarrel with the
Soviets, ending any U.S. thoughts of playing one Communist power
against the other.
   Chinese-U.S. disputes over Taiwan, human rights and trade reveal
a deep residue of cultural misunderstanding and nationalistic
resentment.
   ``On the U.S. side, there is what I would call the superpower
mentality,'' Ms. Zi said. ``The United States always thinks it is
the final judge of what is right and what is wrong.''
   She and other Chinese scholars say most Americans don't
understand China.
   But whatever ill feelings linger are slight compared to the
mutual hostility before President Richard Nixon's visit to China in
1972, Ms. Zi said. China and the United States had fought in the
Korean War, and most Chinese accepted Chairman Mao Tse-tung's
appraisal of the United States as an imperialist threat.
   Mutual fear of the Soviet Union brought the former enemies
together.
   ``Mao didn't want to have two enemies at once, so he decided that
the Soviets were more dangerous and that relations should be
improved with the Americans,'' said Ms. Zi.
   The United States wanted to discourage healing of the
Chinese-Soviet rift and use better relations with China to press
Moscow to open detente.
   Under President Mikhail Gorbachev, however, the Soviet Union has
tempered its aggressive stance and increased friendly exchanges with
both Washington and Beijing.
   The first Chinese-Soviet summit since 1959 is likely to take
place in 1989.
   U.S. Ambassador Winston Lord said improved Chinese-Soviet
relations are no threat to the United States.
   ``They have racial and historical tensions and geopolitical
competition in Asia and elsewhere,'' Lord said. ``At best, their
relationship is going to be an ambivalent one.''
   He and Ms. Zi said China and the United States still need one
another even without any threat from the Soviets.
   The Chinese want U.S. technology, investment and cooperation in
keeping peace in Asia so China can focus on development, not defense.
   Washington has a stake in helping China become more modern and
moderate.
   ``The greater role the United States plays in China's
modernization ... the easier it will be for the United States to
exert its influence in the fast-growing Asia-Pacific region,'' Ms.
Zi said.
   Certain problems can be expected to persist.
   China wants the United States to end military sales to the
Nationalists on Taiwan and promote reunification with the mainland.
Lord said the United States won't ``help or hinder'' reunification.
   Trade also is a perennial problem, with each side accusing the
other of protectionism.
   Human rights issues have aroused the greatest emotion.
   Washington has criticized China's violent suppression of
independence protests in Tibet and has withheld dues from the United
Nations that it says would support China's strict birth control
policies, including reported forced abortions.
   Mei Renyi, an associate professor at Beijing University of
Foreign Studies, said such quarrels illustrate the limits of
U.S.-Chinese ties.
   ``We are friends, not allies,'' he said. ``Our systems are
different, our ideologies are different. Our expectations should be
realistic.''

   Americans and Chinese have carried out exchanges
in hundreds of fields over the past decade, from alligator research
to choreography. Here are a few examples:
   TRADE _ Two-way trade totaled $10.4 billion in 1987, with a U.S.
deficit, according to U.S. figures. Chinese figures say the total
was $7.8 billion with a Chinese deficit. The discrepancy arises from
goods that pass through third countries. The United States, China's
second-largest trade partner after Japan, buys mainly clothing and
textiles and sells mainly machinery.
   INVESTMENT _ U.S. businesses have set up more than 500 joint
ventures with committed investment of about $3.25 billion. The
largest is the Occidental Petroleum Corp.'s Antaibo coal mine in
north-central China. China has set up more than 140 enterprises in
the United States, most of them trade-related.
   EDUCATION _ More than 56,000 Chinese students and scholars have
gone to the United States for varying periods over the past decade.
The U.S. Embassy estimates more than 1,000 Americans are studying in
China.
   CULTURE _ Hundreds of exchanges have occurred, affecting millions
of people. For example, a Chinese government loan of hundreds of
imperial treasures in 1987 was expected to draw more than 1 million
viewers in Seattle and Colombus, Ohio.
   Thousands of Chinese saw the massive abstract canvases of
American artist Frederick J. Brown in a show at the National Museum
of the Chinese Revolution in June.
   Countless books have been translated from Chinese to English and
visa versa. Dance and theater troupes and musicians have traveled in
both directions.
   MILITARY _ The United States has sold China $648 million worth of
hardware, including helicopters and electronic equipment. U.S.
companies also have helped upgrade Chinese fighter planes' avionics.

   Advocates of the Canada-U.S. free trade agreement
taking effect Sunday believe the pact will bring major benefits and
eventual changes to both countries.
   But Canadian critics, who almost succeeded in scuttling the deal,
remain just as convinced that arguments over it will last as long as
the agreement.
   Squabbling over the agreement continued as the Senate on Friday
passed the legislation removing the last remaining trade barriers
between the two nations. The pact was approved by the House of
Commons on Dec. 24.
   Prime Minister Brian Mulroney believes the pact, ardently
supported by Canadian business looking to the larger export market,
will produce a net increase of about 250,000 jobs in Canada in the
next 10 years.
   But it also will bring restructuring in some industries and plant
closings, proof to the agreement's critics that the need to compete
will force Canada to abandon its traditions of social protection for
its people.
   How is it, International Trade Minister John C. Crosbie was asked
by a legislative opponent, that Canada and the United States are
still arguing about trade after completing such a landmark deal?
   Crosbie replied, with a touch of irritation, that the agreement
was never intended to eradicate all disputes between the two
nations. ``It just means we will have a better way of defending
ourselves in the future,'' he said.
   The agreement, signed by Mulroney and President Reagan on Jan. 2,
1988, phases out all remaining tariffs between Canada and the United
States over a 10-year period starting Sunday.
   The two countries already form the world's strongest bilateral
trade relationship _ about $150 billion each year, of which 80
percent already was tariff-free before the agreement.
   The trade pact also frees up investment barriers and trade in
energy and services, and creates Canadian-U.S. panels to settle
disputes. It dismantles special protections that had been provided
for such areas as the U.S. sugar industry, Canadian brewers and
Canadian cultural industries.
   Supporters of the agreement believe that moving toward a North
American trade zone of more than 275 million people will prove an
important counterpoint to the European Economic Community's 1992
target for a unified market.
   Canadian critics failed to stop Mulroney from winning his second
consecutive majority government in Nov. 21 elections, which gave him
the madate to go ahead with the agreement. But they still fear that
Canada's 26 million people could be overwhelmed by the nearly 10
times larger American market.
   ``If the process of rationalization and harmonization takes place
at a relatively quick pace, then it may be too late to reverse it,''
said Mel Hurtig, publisher of ``The Canadian Encyclopedia'' and one
of the agreement's most ardent opponents.
   Supporters say the criticism will die down as benefits become
clear, just as those who spoke against the auto pact between Canada
and the United States in 1965 watched it bring increased prosperity.
   The auto agreement, which remains in place under the free trade
agreement, helped boost the Canadian automotive industry to its
current level of employment, more than 130,000 people.
   The Canadian government has been giving special training to
customs agents on handling any changes that take place under the new
agreement, although little will be visible to the typical traveler
or consumer.
   ``We doubt very much the average consumer will notice very much
in January, or even over the next decade,'' Bob Best, policy adviser
to the Consumers' Association of Canada, told the Toronto Star daily.
   Among the few items whose tariffs will be lifted immediately are
yeast, calculators, furs, motorcycles, skates and telephones.
Tariffs on most items covered by the agreement _ generally higher in
Canada than in the United States _ are to be reduced in stages over
five or 10 years.
   The announcement by Gillette Co. just after the election that it
was closing two Canadian plants employing 600 people produced a
firestorm of criticism, although the company denied the changes were
related to the trade pact.
   The Canadian government has said current retraining programs are
adequate to handle displaced workers.
   Ross Johnson, the Canadian who rose to prominence as the head of
RJR Nabisco Inc., is one of the supporters of the pact.
   ``We'll have fewer and bigger plants,'' he said in an interview
in the January issue of Report on Business, published by Toronto's
Globe and Mail daily.
   ``You've got to take risks or you don't get anywhere,'' he said.
``And after all, free trade is not Armaggedon.''

   An Associated Press writer recently returned to
New York from Frankfurt via London on Pan Am Flight 103. Here is her
report on the new security precautions.
</TEXT>
<BYLINE>By THEASA TUOHY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Pan Am check-in counter was cordoned off with
rope. A West German officer in khaki and green stood by, cradling a
submachine gun. Next to him, a colleague sported a sidearm.
   None of the other counters at the Frankfurt airport resembled
battle stations. The previous week, boarding an Austrian Airlines
flight from the same airport for Salzburg, I encountered no armed
officers, no item-by-item inspection of my hand luggage.
   But this flight Thursday was special. It was Pan Am 103,
originating in Frankfurt with a brief stop in London, then on to
John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York. Eight days
earlier, Flight 103 made it only as far as Lockerbie, Scotland,
where it exploded in the air, killing all 259 aboard and an
estimated 11 persons on the ground. And the previous day,
authorities announced that they had concluded that the explosion was
the work of a bomber.
   Just to reach the Frankfurt check-in counter, I had to get past
two airline security guards, backed up on their left by the German
police officers and on their right by three other unidentifiable
observers.
   ``Did you pack your own luggage?''
   ``Yes.''
   ``Do you have any gifts or packages whose contents are unknown to
you?''
   ``No.''
   ``Where are you going. Where have you been?''
   As I tried to check in, it was discovered that a checked bag had
been mistakenly sent from Munich only to Frankfurt, instead of
through to New York. This was enough out of the ordinary to cause
someone wearing an official-looking plastic badge to lean over the
clerk's shoulder and read about my reservations.
   My hand luggage was gone through. Out came my house shoes, the
white ski hat, then the cosmetic kit that everything falls from as
soon as the zipper is touched.
   The day had only just begun. We went through the usual
walk-through metal detector and X-ray check as we entered the
international boarding area, along with a personal frisk with a
hand-held detector.
   We were quizzed again at the boarding gate about what we were
carrying and who had packed for us.
   At London's Heathrow Airport, the 26 of us continuing on Flight
103 to New York aboard a Boeing 747 jumbo jet were walked in a group
to a holding area with British security guards leading, walking
alongside, and bringing up the rear.
   At an X-ray machine guarding that area, my giant handbag didn't
pass muster. Out came the blue house shoes, the slippery cosmetic
kit _ this time my nail brush clattered out onto the counter. It was
decided the metal hooks of my apres-ski boots had sounded the alarm.
   The guard who escorted me to the next boarding area seemed
uncomfortable with questions about the extraordinary security.
   ``Lightning usually doesn't strike twice in the same place,'' he
said reassuringly.
   Five minutes after my handbag was searched, item by item, and a
security guard had escorted me to the new area _ he, English and a
gentleman, carrying my bag _ the bag was gone through again.
   Out came the blue house shoes. This time, my nasal spray was
opened, the pages of my paperback copy of ``Prince of Tides'' were
riffled, my datebook was examined, and I had to show the guard how
to work the spring on my leather coin purse.
   Finally, we boarded. As we began to lift off, I opened my book
and wondered how long it would take us to be over Lockerbie.
Authorities there were still identifying the bodies and collecting
the wreckage of Clipper Maid of the Seas, that other Flight 103,
blown out of the sky Dec. 21 by a bomb apparently brought aboard in
luggage.

<DATELINE>PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ten years ago, returnees from the
Khmer Rouge killing fields, emaciated, diseased, dressed in black,
scoured the streets for scraps of food. Phnom Penh was a virtual
ghost city, and in its suburbs one stumbled across bones of victims
from the reign of terror.
   Today, the city's population approaches 1 million. Markets brim
with domestic produce from record harvests and imports shipped up
from Singapore on the ``Mekong Express.'' Private restaurants thrive
and business ventures are being launched with Japanese and overseas
Chinese investors.
   But despite evident progress, the Phnom Penh government has yet
to answer its most crucial question: Can it prevent a second victory
by the Khmer Rouge without the Vietnamese military shield it has
enjoyed over the past decade?
   ``People are asking themselves: `Is this the end of the Khmer
Rouge or are we in the eye of the hurricane?''' said one Western
relief official with several years experience in Cambodia.
   As the internationally shunned, pro-Hanoi government prepares to
mark its 10th anniversary Jan. 7, leaders express confidence that a
``people's war'' in the countryside can keep the tough guerrillas at
bay _ even if ongoing negotiations for a political solution fail.
   ``Vietnamese assistance ... is considered very important, but
final success depends on the Cambodian people,'' Prime Minister Hun
Sen told foreign reporters recently. ``We still have another two
years (before a total Vietnamese withdrawal), which we think is
reasonable to build our forces.''
   Analysts say Phnom Penh would like to preserve the current
People's Republic of Kampuchea, PRK, but invite participation by
Prince Norodom Sihanouk, head of the three-party guerrilla coalition
that includes the Khmer Rouge, the prince's group and another
non-communist group. The inclusion of the internationally
prestigious prince, Phnom Penh believes, would bestow legitimacy on
the government and undermine the Khmer Rouge.
   But Cambodian officials indicate Phnom Penh may gamble on being
able to go it alone as Hanoi moves to a promised total military
pullout by 1990.
   The PRK has some grounds for optimism. Western aid officials here
say Cambodia, which in 1979 barely warded off famine thanks to a
major international relief effort, is approaching self-sufficiency
in food with an annual production of 2 million tons of rice and
supplementary crops.
   Vietnamese Ambassador Ngo Dien says not a single village in
Cambodia has fallen under full guerrilla control and that only about
5 percent are under partial influence of the Khmer Rouge or their
allies.
   In 1979, when the Khmer Rouge fell to a Vietnamese invasion
force, Cambodia had fewer than 50 doctors and the education system
had been obliterated. The Phnom Penh government says its schools now
are attended by more than 2 million and that health care, although
often woefully inadequate, extends to the grass roots.
   Cambodia is still one of the world's poorest nations, but the
economy appears to have been spurred by what one Soviet diplomat
calls ``silent perestroika,'' a reference to Moscow's efforts to
restructure its economy away from dogmatic Marxism. Phnom Penh has
virtually abandoned all attempts to communalize farming and is
debating the restoration of private land ownership. Taxes on
mushrooming private businesses and trade are low.
   For the past year and a half, the battlefields have been
relatively quiet and security has improved for the PRK side. The
Khmer Rouge operate in small groups, strike in remote areas and in
1988 killed about 100, mostly lower-ranking government officials,
according to Phnom Penh sources.
   Vietnam and Phnom Penh say this low level of activity mirrors the
weakness of the guerrillas. But some Western analysts believe it
means the resistance is focusing on political organization and
stockpiling weapons for a showdown.
   From most accounts, the Phnom Penh army _ said by Western
diplomats to number about 44,000 troops _ has proved a lackluster
fighting force.
   ``I'm worried. Disciplined armies win wars, and the only
disciplined ones around are the Khmer Rouge and the withdrawing
Vietnamese,'' said a Western aid official.
   Vietnam says it has only 50,000 troops left in Cambodia from a
high of 200,000. The Khmer Rouge strength is estimated at 30,000 to
40,000, while the non-communist groups field about 27,000 fighters.
   In addition to combatting the guerrillas, the government is
threatened by problems that helped bring the Khmer Rouge to power in
1975: corruption, inefficiency and a widening gap between prospering
Phnom Penh and the impoverished countryside.
   Phnom Penh officials say they are aware of the problems.
   Some decision-making has been decentralized and emphasis
reportedly placed on a 50,000-member militia whose members would
defend their own villages against the Khmer Rouge. Over the past 18
months, the government has tripled the price at which it buys rice
from farmers, both improving their lot and making it harder for the
guerrillas to purchase food in the countryside.
   The murderous record of the Khmer Rouge, and evidence that they
remain brutal extremists, plays into the hands of the government as
does the fact that the guerrillas will lose their key propaganda
thrust if Hanoi leaves Cambodia. A withdrawal of the Vietnamese may
force the army to get tougher.
   Negotiations and debates are continuing in Beijing, Bangkok,
Paris, Moscow and Jakarta that could decide the future of Cambodia's
8 million people.
   Those hoping for a peaceful solution see some welcome signs,
including an apparent desire for normal ties between China and the
Soviet Union. China has recently indicated it would reduce its
supply of weapons to the guerrillas as the Vietnamese withdrew.
Moscow, the major arms supplier to Vietnam and Phnom Penh, has
repeatedly said it wants to see a resolution.
   The Cambodian conflict, cited as the chief stumbling block for
normalized ties, will come up for discussion in 1989 at the summit
between Moscow and Beijing.

   Fighting broke out between police and
African students when authorities came to arrest a Ghana student
today in connection with a Dec. 26 brawl with Chinese students,
sources said.
   African student sources said there were injuries among both
students and police when officers arrived at an isolated guest house
outside Nanking, where the students were being kept following a wave
of racial violence. The extent of the injuries was not known.
   The official Xinhua News Agency said police arrested Alex Dzabaku
Dosoo of Ghana, a student at Hehai University, for an attack on
university employee Zhang Jitao.
   Xinhua said three other foreign students, presumably African, had
been summoned for interrogation in connection with the Dec. 26 fight
in which 11 Chinese and two Africans were injured.
   Zhang, the only person to sustain serious injuries in the fight,
remains in intensive care, according to sources in Nanking.
   The fight was followed by two days of violent and often racist
demonstrations in which thousands of Chinese youths destroyed
property in the African students' dormitory and marched through the
streets chanting such slogans as ``beat the black devils.''
   The brawl at Nanking's Hehai University began when the African
students tried to bring Chinese women to a school dance.
   Meanwhile, African students in the eastern city of Hangzhou
locked themselves in their dormitory to protest allegations they
were carriers of AIDS, students said. Officials denied the
allegations.
   Kong Xiangyou, vice president of Zhejiang Agriculture University,
said in a telephone interview it also was untrue that the Africans
were not being allowed to leave Hangzhou. He urged the Africans to
return to classes.
   The Africans locked themselves in their dormitory on Monday after
learning a university switchboard operator was telling incoming
callers the Africans were infected with the deadly disease.
   Vincent Ongas, of Kenya, told The Associated Press today that the
students would not end their boycott of classes until the university
promised it would ``stop spreading propaganda against us.''
   In Nanking, about 140 African students were still being kept in
isolation a week after a fight between Africans and Chinese sparked
large anti-African demonstrations.
   Chinese authorities have confined them to a guest house about 50
miles outside the city, but have refused to connect phone calls to
them or let foreign reporters speak to them.
   Liang Ruiju, president of Nanking's Hehai University, said today
that the Africans had ``established an independent kingdom'' at the
guest house.
   ``The action of the students has gone completely beyond the
limits of the law,'' he said.
   There are an estimated 1,500 Africans from 40 nations studying at
Chinese universities. China has long provided scholarships for
Africans in a show of solidarity with developing African states, but
social tensions, which Africans attribute to ingrained racial
prejudices against blacks, have on occasion flared into violence.
   In Hangzhou, about 140 miles southeast of Nanking, the Africans
say they are victims of pervasive discrimination against black
Africans.
   ``They are trying to isolate us completely,'' Ongas said in
explaining why university officials were allegedly accusing them of
having AIDS.
   One African student at the school was sent home in November after
testing positive for AIDS, but all other Africans there tested
negative, Martin Ayuk of Cameroon said Friday.
   Ongas said 56 Africans were participating in the boycott.

<HEAD>Medicare, Pensions Among Changes To Take Effect With New Year</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MATT YANCEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ringing in the new year are dozens of changes
in federal laws and regulations, many of them aimed at quenching
Americans' thirst for security and a few that will make life a
little more expensive.
   Among the most significant of the Jan. 1 changes are a vast
expansion of Medicare to cover catastrophic illnesses, faster
pension fund vesting that will benefit millions, particularly women,
and tax changes reducing the government's subsidizing of purchases
on credit.
   Others occurring slightly before the end of 1988 or scheduled
early in 1989 include a ban on lie detector tests by private
employers, 60 days advance notice of plant closings and large
layoffs and a new law prohibiting landlords from discriminating
against the handicapped and families with children.
   A few of the changes are a little more esoteric but their impact
eventually may be felt by the entire population.
   For example, Environmental Protection Agency regulations
implementing the 46-nation ozone treaty take effect Jan. 1. The
regulations don't require chemical companies to actually do anything
until next July, but then they must cut their production of
chloroflourocarbon or CFC compounds by an estiamted 20 percent back
to 1986 levels.
   The treaty is aimed at halting the depletion of the ozone layer
15 to 25 miles up protecting the earth's surface from ultraviolet
rays. CFC compounds also contribute to the ``greenhouse'' effect
that is warming the planet.
   As a result of the regulations, consumers may notice fewer
plastic food containers from fast-food outlets, thicker insulating
panels and possibly even slightly harder seat cushions.
   The biggest of the immediate changes is the Jan 1. expansion of
Medicare coverage for 32 million Medicare beneficiaries to include
catastrophic health care costs.
   Prior to passage of the measure last summer by Congress _ the
first major expansion of Medicare in its 22-year history _ the
program paid full hospital bills for no more than 59 days a year.
   With the changes going into effect Sunday, the beneficiary still
will have to pay the first-day deductible of $560. But that charge
will be assessed no more than once a year no matter how many times
the patient has to be hospitalized. The other 364 days are fully
paid.
   That fundamental change in the hospital benefit was the
cornerstone of the Medicare expansion set in motion by President
Reagan in his 1986 State of the Union message.
   ``Let us remove a financial specter facing our older Ameicans _
the fear of an illness so expensive that it can result in having to
make an intolerable choice between bankruptcy and death,'' he said
then.
   Medicare enrollees will pay for the new benefits through a flat
increase in the premium deducted from their monthly Social Security
checks and an additional sliding scale premium for approximately 40
percent of the elderly who pay federal income tax.
   The flat increase will be $4 a month effective immediately,
climbing to $10.20 monthly in 1993. The sliding scale premium is
projected to rise from a maximum of 15 percent of regular income tax
liability in 1989 to about 28 percent in 1993.
   Many of the Jan. 1 changes grow out of the 1986 Tax Reform Act.
The biggest new benefit from that law going into effect Sunday is
faster vesting in pension plans.
   The maximum waiting period for employees to become fully invested
in a pension is being cut in half from 10 years to five years.
   However, employers can adopt an option that denies full vesting
until seven years. To do so, they have to offer 20 percent vesting
after three years and an additional 20 percent vesting annually
until the seventh year, when it reaches 100 percent.
   The Employee Benefit Research Institute estimates that the
pension changes will provide a retirement stake to 2 million more
workers a year.
   ``We'll especially see more women being vested than in the past
because they tend to be in the workforce or with the same employer
for shorter periods,'' said Stephanie Poe, a spokeswoman for the
institute.
   Another tax change is that only 20 percent of personal interest
payments on everything from car and student loans to credit card
charges will be deductible in 1989, compared with 40 percent last
year.
   And while the government is now raising tax brackets, exemptions
and standard deductions to keep cost-of-living raises from bumping
people into higher brackets, it also is taking more Social Security
taxes.
   The 7.51 percent Social Security tax took a maximum $3,380 out of
employee paychecks in 1988. This year the maximum amount of income
subject to the tax rises from $45,000 to $48,000, raising the
maximum Social Security tax that can be collected from an individual
employee to $3,605.
   The latest change came about just last Thursday, when the Federal
Aviation Administration ordered airlines, effective Jan. 1, to
either inspect by hand or X-ray all luggage checked aboard U.S.
airline flights from western Europe and the Middle East.
   The new inspections, prompted by the bombing of a Pan Am jet over
Scotland on Dec. 21, are expected to delay passenger check-ins by
about an hour.
   Other changes taking effect slightly before or after New Year's
Day include:
   _ The use of polygraph or lie detector tests by private employers
to screen job applicants was outlawed, with some exceptions,
effective last Tuesday. The American Civil Liberties Union estimates
the law will effectively eliminate about 80 percent of the 2 million
polygraph exams now administered annually.
   _ A 47-year-old ban on homework in five apparel trades is being
removed on Jan. 8, unless unions which support the prohibitions win
a court stay first. Affected are an estimated 50,000 to 75,000
workers in fields such as mittens and gloves, embroideries, buttons
and buckles, handkerchiefs and some jewelry trades. They will be
able to work legally at home for the first time if their employers
obtain a certficate from the Labor Department after pledging to
abide by minimum wage and other federal labor standards.
   _ A law requiring employers to provide 60 days advance notice of
plant closings or layoffs affecting 50 or more people officially
takes effect Feb. 4. However, there are different interpretations on
whether companies are required to have provided 60 days notice
beforehand if they close a plant on that date. The Labor Department
advised in early December that, to avoid potential liability, they
should.
   _ Regulations implementing a law passed by Congress last summer
forbidding landlords from discriminating against the handicapped or
families with children take effect March 12. Violators can be fined
up to $10,000 for a first offense, $25,000 for a second violation in
a five-year period and $50,000 for two or more violations within a
seven-year period.

<HEAD>Surge in Drug Killings Made 1988 Bloodiest Year in D.C. History</HEAD>

   In the nation's capital, where the federal
government's war on drugs is mapped out, young Washingtonians
fighting over drugs pushed the number of murders in the city to a
record one a day during 1988.
   The District of Columbia's drug problems dramatize the two
different Washingtons _ the Capitol, the White House and other sites
visited by millions of tourists each year, and the squalid
neighborhoods tucked away from the traditional seats of power.
There, a more vicious power struggle is contested among teens drawn
to the status and money that come from selling drugs.
   In 1988, 366 people had been killed in the nation's capital as of
Dec. 30, far surpassing the previous high total of 287, set in 1969.
Police blame drugs _ particularly the arrival of crack cocaine _ for
about 60 percent of the slayings. As recently as 1986, drug-related
killings accounted for just one-third of the city's homicide total.
   Although final population and homicide figures have yet to be
compared, Washington and Detroit had the two highest per-capita
murder rates in America in 1988, meaning the nation's capital could
earn the dubious honor of being the nation's murder capital as well.
   The absence of organized crime in Washington may be a factor in
the city's murder rate, officials say. Law enforcement officials say
that in cities where organized crime factions control the drug
market, there are fewer drug-related slayings.
   ``What you have here is a lot of young entrepreneurs fighting
among themselves for drug turf,'' said Police Chief Maurice T.
Turner. ``They are just working for themselves.''
   Stemming the city's drug tide has become an increasingly tough
battle for Turner and his 3,800 officers.
   Earlier this year, police decided they will switch to .9mm
semiautomatic handguns out of fear that weapons commonly found on
the street were outclassing the standard .38-caliber six-shot
revolver officers have been carrying.
   The new weapons, which allow officers to fire an extra 10 shots
before reloading, were ordered after drug raids frequently resulted
in the seizure of Uzi submachine guns and other sophisticated
weaponry. Surveying the weapons at a March news conference, Turner
called the district's streets ``something out of the wild, wild
West.'' Officers will have their new guns by 1990.
   And police have learned that simply arresting more drug suspects
hasn't sated the city's appetite for narcotics. A highly-touted
anti-drug program, Operation Clean Sweep, has produced more than
46,000 arrests since its August 1986 inception.
   However, Turner has complained that the program, which sends
swarms of officers through drug-infested neighborhoods to make
arrests, has done little more than further clog the city's already
overcrowded jail and court systems.
   For each drug dealer arrested, another springs forward, according
to Turner.
   ``A lot of these kids are high school dropouts with few skills,''
Turner said. ``They can make up to a $1 million a year selling
drugs. What would you do?''
   Jay B. Stephens, U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia, who
can prosecute both local and federal crimes, announced in December
that he is assigning five senior prosecutors to work solely on
drug-related killings in the district.
   Turner also has called on city officials to spend more money on
drug education, prevention and treatment programs. Currently, a
three-week wait is common for people wanting to enroll in the city's
treatment centers.
   As for the future, police believe that as markets are more firmly
established for crack, a highly-addictive cocaine derivative, the
murder rate will decrease.
   ``This is one of the last major cities in this country to have an
infusion of crack,'' Turner said. ``When crack arrived in other
cities, like New York, murder rates went up there, too.''

<HEAD>Commission's Recommendations Will Result in Minuscule Savings</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRYAN BRUMLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   After spending seven months reviewing 4,200
military properties, a commission found 86 that could be closed, for
savings that amount to one fifth of a penny on every dollar spent by
the Pentagon.
   ``There was no dollar goal for savings,'' said Hayden Bryan, the
executive director of the 12-member base closings panel, which said
its recommendations would save the government $693 million a year,
or $5.6 billion in current dollars over two decades.
   Much of the annual savings will take up to six years to be
realized, because of the cost of transferring personnel, cleaning up
and disposing of the facilities.
   The base closings are expected to be approved by outgoing Defense
Secretary Frank C. Carlucci, and congressional leaders say Congress
is not likely to stop them. By law, neither Carlucci nor Congress
can reject specific closures without scrapping the whole package of
recommendations.
   Cutting more bases than those recommended would be politically
tough and likely would not make much more of a dent in the $300
billion Pentagon budget, Bryan said in a telephone interview last
week.
   However, the commission report and the chairmen of the House and
Senate armed services committees both urged the next defense
secretary, former Texas Sen. John Tower, to press for further base
closings.
   ``I would like to have seen more,'' said Sen. Sam Nunn, the
Georgia Democrat who heads the Senate Armed Services Committee.
   Rep. Les Aspin, D-Wis., Nunn's counterpart in the House, called
the list ``too modest'' and said it could have been a third again as
large.
   Aspin said he thought that members of Congress could not be
persuaded to go along with another independent commission to order
mass base closings for at least another decade.
   Instead, he urged the incoming administration of George Bush to
use a 1985 law and submit as part of its annual defense budget a
list of bases to be closed.
   The Reagan administration never made use of the law, said an aide
to Aspin. Caspar W. Weinberger, President Reagan's defense secretary
until late 1987, submitted several lists of bases to be closed but
could not reach an agreement with Congress over procedure or which
bases should be included.
   ``I would hope that the next secretary of defense would take this
job very, very seriously ... there's is money to be saved,'' said
Abraham Ribicoff, co-chairman of the commission and a former
Democratic senator from Connecticut.
   The base closing commission that submitted its report to Congress
and the Pentagon on Thursday was appointed by Carlucci on May 3,
1988. He has until Jan. 15, five days before he leaves office, to
approve or reject the whole package.
   Congress last Oct. 24 passed legislation designed to insulate the
commission from the type of political pressure that has prevented
the federal government from closing any major bases since 1977. To
block the package, both houses must pass resolutions against it. The
closings would begin January 1, 1990 and be completed by September
30, 1995.
   The government is not likely to repeat the commission's effort,
which was designed in part to break a logjam caused by passage of a
law in 1977 giving Congress the power to block closure of any base
with 300 or more Defense Department civilian employees.
   Instead, the commission urged the Pentagon to take a close look
at military bases with fewer than 100 employees or those used by
reserve units or as military laboratories. The commission did not
have the time or the authority to review those facilities, said
Bryan, the executive director.
   ``In the Defense Department, the real savings come through the
reduction of personnel,'' said Bryan. And reducing the number of
people in the Armed Force, he said, is a matter to be settled by
Congress and the administration. The commission recommendations
include transfers of personnel from closed facilities to those that
will remain in operation. Altogether, 145 facilities would be
affected by closure, partial closure or realignment.
   ``We did not get into force structure,'' Bryan said.
   For the commission, the main guideline for closing a base was
whether it served the national security, Ribicoff and panel
co-chairman Jack Edwards told reporters.
   ``And if a base had a military value, then we didn't bother it,''
said Edwards, a former Republican congressman from Alabama.
   The main criteria for determining whether it was economical to
close a base that does not have military value was whether the
government could save as much in six years shutting it as it would
cost to relocate the employees, clean up any toxic waste or
munitions, and dispose of the site.
   ``The biggest constraint ... is the six-year payback,'' said
Edwards. ``We found a lot of facilities that had 10-year paybacks,
12-year paybacks, even 20-year paybacks, where we could have made
some major savings over a longer period of time.''
   The commission had been expected to recommend the closing of Fort
Monroe, Va., commissioned in 1823 and now virtually abandoned, but
found that it would take too many years and too many dollars to
clean up munitions there.
   ``I personally went to Fort Monroe to look at it,'' said Edwards.
``And I saw the moat and ... the old historic buildings.''
   ``I also saw what would amount to around $900 million in cleanup
costs to get rid of the old shells that had been lobbed ... on that
fort for the last 200 years or however long it was,'' he said. ``It
was more like a 20-year payback at best.''

<HEAD>Miami's Cuban Exile Community Mixed on Future</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The dream of overthrowing Fidel Castro remains alive
for many Cuban exiles here even as the Communist leader Sunday marks
the 30th anniversary of his takeover of the island 90 miles south of
Florida.
   But the strategies for dumping Castro have been changing for all
but a few diehards since the early years of invasion plots hatched
in Miami restaurants and guerrilla training in the Everglades.
   Many Cubans interviewed here in recent weeks see their role as
lobbying U.S. politicians to keep up the pressure on Castro and, if
his Communist rule ends, helping reconstruct post-Castro Cuba
without actually moving there.
   ``The Cuban community is more pluralistic today,'' said Jaime
Suchlicki, Cuban-born University of Miami director of Interamerican
Studies. ``Some people want relations, some people don't. Some
people want visas to travel there, some people want no travel there.
   ``It's natural. People have new lives here. There are people who
have grown up here, another generation that was born here,'' said
Suchlicki.
   The nearly 1 million Cubans who left their homeland comprise one
of the most successful immigrant groups in U.S. history. Some
560,000 have settled in the Miami-Dade County area, a third of the
population.
   They transformed Miami into a hub for Latin American commerce,
culture and politics. Cubans own an estimated 25,000 businesses and
are represented heavily in nearly every occupation. Miami's mayor
was born in Cuba, as were the Miami city manager and Dade county
manager, and visitors to many sections of Miami are more likely to
hear Spanish than English.
   The issue of how to deal with Castro still stirs emotion here,
although not like that of the late 1970s when some Cuban exiles who
established a dialogue with Castro were labeled Communist
sympathizers and were subject to threats, and even bombs.
   Andres Nazario Sargen is among the holdovers from early 1960s
anti-Castro intrigues who stick to the hard line.
   ``There is no change. The struggle continues for Cuba,'' said
Nazario Sargen, head of Alpha 66, a militant anti-Castro group
active for nearly three decades. ``Castro has the power and the
military force, but Cuba is its people. And he has lost control of
the Cuban people.''
   In the years after the disastrous U.S.-assisted Cuban exile
invasion at the Bay of Pigs in 1961 and the 1962 Soviet-U.S.
agreement ending the Cuban Missile Crisis, U.S. backing of exile
militants ended. But Nazario Sargen said his group, which he says
has as many as 2,000 supporters, includes members within Cuba and
keeps up military training here so it can help if armed rebellion
breaks out.
   But Nelson Diaz, who came here in 1981, said he sees no benefit
in continuing efforts to isolate Castro with a trade embargo and a
refusal to establish full diplomatic ties. It's the Cuban people,
such as the 16-year-old daughter he left behind, who suffer most,
Diaz said.
   A Gallup Poll conducted in early 1988 for an independent policy
research group indicated continued strong feelings against Castro
among Cuban-Americans, with 96 percent of those polled saying Castro
is a ``bad thing'' for Cuba. But 41 percent said they would favor
U.S.-Cuban talks on normalizing relations, with 47 percent opposed
in the poll's sampling, which had an 8 percent to 9 percent margin
of error.
   In this decade, influential Cuban exiles led by Miami businessman
Jorge Mas Canosa have built the Cuban American National Foundation,
which has full-time lobbyists in Washington, and pushed there for
Radio Marti. Since 1985, the U.S. radio station has broadcast news
and other programs into Cuba.
   Many Cuban-American leaders hope that Television Marti will
follow this year, and they reject calls for improving Cuba
relations, suggested last November by Senate Foreign Relations
Committee Chairman Claiborne Pell of Rhode Island after he visited
Castro.
   ``Establishing relations would help Castro at a time when I think
he's having a lot of problems internally,'' said Mayor Raul Martinez
of the heavily Latin Dade County city of Hialeah.
   The Cubans have rebuilt their lives in Miami while building a
generation of Cuban-Americans who see themselves as interested in
Cuba, but with no aspirations for moving there.
   ``The United States is my home, my future,'' said Maria
Fernandez, a 17-year-old student. ``I would love to go visit, to see
where my parents grew up, but I can't see myself living there. All
my friends say the same thing. We can't do anything to change what
happened 30 years ago.''
   Still, the mayor of Hialeah said, Cuban-Americans have a
responsibility to their homeland he compared to the support many
Americans Jews give to Israel.
   ``You should never forget your roots,'' Martinez said. ``I would
not move there, but I would go there to help reconstruct Cuba.''

<HEAD>Pakistan, India Agree Not To Attack Nuclear Plants</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By EARLEEN FISHER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   India and Pakistan agreed Saturday not
to attack each other's nuclear facilities, a move hailed by their
prime ministers as the first step toward easing their countries'
often hostile relations.
   ``I think that in both our countries there is a groundswell for
peace,'' Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto of Pakistan said. ``An
extremely important step has been taken toward improving relations
between India and Pakistan.''
   Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi of India said he hoped this week's
talks with Ms. Bhutto ``will help normalize things to come.''
   The two leaders, who met for eight hours, spoke to reporters
after Indian and Pakistani officials signed the no-attack pact. The
two nations also agreed to cultural exchanges and to end double
taxation in bilateral trade.
   ``A momentum for peace has begun,'' Ms. Bhutto said.
   Gandhi, turning to Ms. Bhutto, noted the agreements were the
first to be signed between India and Pakistan since 1972, when
``your father and my mother'' signed an accord calling for a gradual
normalization of relations.
   Ms. Bhutto is the daughter of Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, the former
Pakistani prime minister who was hanged in 1979. Gandhi is the son
of Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, who was assassinated in 1984
by her Sikh bodyguards.
   The meeting between Ms. Bhutto and Gandhi offers the hope that a
new generation of leaders can ease the hostility between their
nations, which have gone to war three times since gaining
independence in 1947. Moslem Pakistan and predominantly Hindu India
were created out of British colonial India and were partitioned
along religious lines.
   ``For a very long period, the relations between India and
Pakistan were flawed,'' said Ms. Bhutto, who took office Dec. 2
after Pakistan's first free elections in 11 years.
   The main sticking points between India and Pakistan have included
wariness of each other's nuclear capabilities, the dispute over
their border in Kashmir and violence by Sikh extremists in the
Indian state of Punjab.
   India contends the Sikh separatists, blamed for the deaths of
more than 2,400 people in Punjab in 1988, have obtained arms and
training in Pakistan. Pakistan has repeatedly denied the accusation.
   The agreement not to attack each other's nuclear installations
was reached verbally in 1985, when Pakistani President Mohammed Zia
ul-Haq visited New Delhi. The cultural and taxation agreements were
drafted and initialed a year ago.
   The nuclear agreement, proclaiming a commitment to ``durable
peace,'' said Pakistan and India ``will refrain from undertaking,
encouraging or participating indirectly or directly in any action
aimed at causing the destruction or damage to any such (nuclear)
installations or facilities in the other country.''
   The agreement covers nuclear power and research facilities, as
well as uranium enrichment plants and other nuclear-related
facilities. India operates nuclear power plants and has also
conducted a nuclear test, while Pakistan says its nuclear
installations are for energy uses.
   India, along with foreign experts, has long believed Pakistan is
working to develop nuclear weapons, although Pakistan has denied
this.
   The agreement says India and Pakistan will notify each other
annually on Jan. 1 of the exact location of their nuclear facilities.
   Both Gandhi and Ms. Bhutto have spoken in public this week of
Pakistan's new era of democracy as offering hope for better
relations.
   The Nov. 16 elections that enabled Ms. Bhutto to form a
government were Pakistan's first multiparty elections since 1977,
when her father was prime minister. Zia, an army general, ousted
Prime Minister Bhutto in a coup later that year. Bhutto was
subsequently hanged after being convicted of what he said was a
trumped-up charge of conspiracy to murder a political opponent.
   Gandhi was the first Indian prime minister to meet a Pakistani
leader in Pakistan since 1960 when his grandfather, Prime Minister
Jawaharlal Nehru, met President Ayub Khan.

<HEAD>Lawmakers Return to Capitol Hill This Week to Open 101st Congress</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID ESPO</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The 101st Congress opens for business this week
with majority Democrats pledging cooperation with President-elect
Bush while insisting he take the politically risky first steps on
budget cuts and other contentious issues.
   The first, largely symbolic sign of accommodation will come
shortly after lawmakers are sworn in on Tuesday when incoming Senate
Majority Leader George Mitchell of Maine clears the way for
committees to begin confirmation hearings on the Republican Cabinet
appointees before inauguration day on Jan. 20.
   The fireworks won't be long in erupting. President Reagan is
expected to propose a congressional pay raise of as much as $45,000
annually a few days after Congress formally convenes.
   The partisan wrangling will come later, as the Democratic
majorities in the House and Senate and the new Republican president
tackle the deficit and legislation dealing with the Pentagon's
purchasing system, minimum wage, clean air, health care, and ethics.
   ``We both know there will be things on which we can't agree,''
says Jim Wright, D-Texas, embarking on his second term as Speaker of
the House.
   One obvious candidate is the deficit. Bush spoke during his
campaign of using a ``flexible freeze'' to reduce the red ink. He
favors increasing Pentagon spending to keep it current with
inflation and has said repeatedly he won't stand for higher taxes.
   ``We look forward to receiving his plan,'' says Mitchell, leader
of a 55-member Democratic caucus in the Senate.
   Wright presides over a huge Democratic majority in the House,
260-175, after a gain of two Democratic seats in last November's
elections. The party's leaders are waiting to see how Bush converts
his campaign rhetoric into legislative proposals.
   ``We welcome his getting on the wagon'' on issues such as child
care and the environment,'' jabbed Democratic whip Tony Coelho of
California. ``And we intend to see what he wants to do.''
   Minority Republicans already have signaled their intention to be
more aggressive than in the past.
   ``I believe we must clearly define our ethics rules and then we
have to enforce them,'' House GOP Leader Bob Michel of Illinois said
last month. ``The record of enforcement in this House is a national
disgrace,'' he added in remarks widely viewed as directed at a probe
into alleged ethical lapses on Wright's part.
   Mitchell represents change for Democrats in the Senate, their
first new leader in a dozen years.
   Sen. Robert C. Byrd of West Virginia stepped down from his
leadership and becomes chairman of the Senate Appropriations
Committee in one of the numerous switches that occurs each time
Congress begins a new session.
   Both houses will have new Budget Committee chairmen, Rep. Leon
Panetta of California in the House and Sen. Jim Sasser of Tennessee
in the Senate. The two already have made their dissatisfaction known
with Bush's campaign pledge to avoid new taxes to reduce the
deficit. ``You have to raise revenues,'' says Panetta, who has
immersed himself in the budget for years.
   Sen. Don Riegle of Michigan and Rep. Henry Gonzales of Texas are
new Democratic chairmen of the banking committees. Their panels will
grapple with legislation dealing with the ailing savings and loan
industry, changes designed to address corporate buyouts and, most
likely, many of the elements in a conservative war on poverty that
HUD Secretary-designate Jack Kemp has promised.
   The House includes 33 newcomers and the freshmen senators number
11. They most likely will walk into a situation that most employees
can only dream of, with Reagan expected to propose pay raises of as
much as $45,000, the figure recommended by a federal commission.
   Whatever Reagan recommends would take effect automatically 30
days later, barring a vote to overturn it in Congress. Wright is
expected to try to avoid having the roll called on the issue, but
has said he would seek an immediate vote on legislation prohibiting
honoraria for members of Congress.
   Despite the changes in key leadership positions, many of the
issues that Congress grapples with this year are well known.
   The deficit aside, Mitchell lists minimum wage, child care,
health care, environmental bills and affordable housing as part of
his legislative agenda.
   Many bills dealing with those issues died when the old Congress
expired last fall, but Mitchell says he intends to try again.
   ``One ought not to be discouraged by the fact that legislation
wasn't enacted within a few months after it was first proposed,'' he
said.

<TEXT>
   President Corazon Aquino refused
Saturday to allow Ferdinand Marcos back in the country even though
the former president reportedly was administered last rites in a
Honolulu hospital.
   Mrs. Aquino, who became president after the popular and military
uprising that ousted Marcos in February 1986, has remained steadfast
in her refusal to allow him to return.
   ``There are reports that the former President would like to
return to the Philippines in the light of his alleged failing
health,'' Mrs. Aquino said.
   ``Considerations of national welfare and interest'' caused her to
reject a return for Marcos, who ruled the Philippines for 20 years.
   ``For my part, I offer my prayers for his good health and
well-being,'' Mrs. Aquino added.
   Vice President Salvador Laurel said Saturday in a radio interview
that Marcos' wife Imelda telephoned him Friday to ask that he
intercede with Mrs. Aquino to allow the former president to return.
   Laurel said Mrs. Aquino promised only to study the matter.
   ``I think (Marcos) should be allowed home. ... Every Filipino
should be allowed to return home,'' Laurel said.
   Marcos entered a Honolulu hospital Thursday for the second time
in three weeks.
   Joe Lazo, president of the Friends of Marcos group, said the
former president was administered last rites by a Roman Catholic
priest and that his followers would urge President Reagan to allow
him to return as a ``dying wish.''
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Debra Livingston said Thursday that a
hearing was been set for Jan. 19 to decide whether Marcos was
healthy enough to travel to New York and face arraignment on U.S.
racketeering charges.
   Tomas Gomez III, the Philippine consul general in Hawaii, said
Honolulu reporters were informed in advance about Marcos' plan to
enter the hospital.
   Gomez repeatedly has accused Marcos of faking poor health in an
attempt to gain public sympathy and stall the case against him.
   Marcos, 71, who contends he is too ill to travel to New York, was
reported in guarded but improving condition Friday after suffering
``the second severe episode of congestive heart failure in a
month,'' according to Norma Kop, spokeswoman for St. Francis
Hospital.
   Ms. Kop said earlier reports that Marcos was also suffering from
pneumonia were wrong. A Marcos spokesman said he was expected to
remain hospitalized for several days for more tests.
   Marcos spent nine days at St. Francis this month after having
trouble breathing. Results of his medical tests were not released.
   Marcos and his wife face U.S. racketeering charges accusing them
of diverting more than $100 million from their homeland to U.S.
investments. Mrs. Marcos pleaded innocent to the charges Oct. 31.
   Cardiologist Francis Weld said in October that although Marcos
had various ailments, he was healthy enough to fly to New York. Weld
also said Marcos faked pain during a physical.

<HEAD>Millennium Society Says Bush May Attend 1999 Bash in Egypt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President-elect Bush is spending this New
Year's holiday at Camp David, Md., but in 11 years he may be in
Egypt.
   Organizers of the Millennium Society say he's already committed
to ushering in the next century at the Great Pyramids of Cheops in
Giza, Egypt.
   The society, founded in 1979 by New York attorney Edward McNally,
holds annual balls in several cities around the world, with ticket
contributions channeled to charity.
   But those parties are just a warm-up for the big bash in 1999 at
12 noon, Greenwich Mean Time, outside Cairo.
   McNally, who was a student at Yale University when he conceived
of the society, nine years ago invited Bush to attend the 1999,
black-tie ceremony. At that time, McNally was at Notre Dame law
school.
   Bush, in a tongue-and-cheek vein, responded to McNally in a
hand-written note dated Jan. 7, 1999.
   ``Dear Ed,'' Bush wrote.
   ``The last two decades have been rough, but you are doing well on
the Supreme Court. We are still fine. I think back to Jan. 21, 1980,
when we did well in Iowa. (We did _ didn't we.) I'm getting older,
but we still miss you.
   _George Bush''
   In 1985, Bush, then the vice president, prepared a statement that
was read at the society's New Year's Eve balls here and in Beijing,
China.
   ``Barbara and I wish you the best of luck in the next year, and
we're looking forward to your celebration in Egypt in 1999,'' Bush
said.
   He said he and his wife ``fervently support the society's
dedication to education, international understanding and world
peace.''
   The society, which charged $70 for tickets, is a non-profit group
that donates money to an international scholars program. The
students are selected to attend the United World Colleges, a
worldwide group of colleges headed by the Prince of Wales.

   Federal regulators, brushing aside charges of
giant government giveaways, announced the takeover of three more
insolvent savings and loan institutions today as regulators
completed a final batch of rescues.
   Working against a midnight deadline when tax breaks for the
purchasers of the sick S&Ls will be cut in half, the Federal Home
Loan Bank Board announced takeover of three insolvent institutions
in the San Francisco area, bringing to 213 the number of failed S&Ls
which have been closed this year.
   By midnight tonight, the bank board said it expected to have
committed a total of about $38 billion in government funds to assist
in rescuing the largest number of S&Ls declared insolvent in 50
years.
   The newest deals involved $243.3 million in government aid
provided to Home Federal Savings and Loan, a large S&L based in San
Diego, to acquire the three S&Ls.
   Home Federal put up $25 million in new capital to make the
purchases of the insolvent Columbus Savings and Loan, San Rafael;
Cal American Savings and Loan, Walnut Creek, and First Security,
Pleasant Hill. The institutions will be reopened Tuesday as branches
of the new Columbus Savings.
   The board, which regulates the nation's 3,100 S&Ls, saved some of
the biggest bailouts for last, including three billion-dollar-plus
packages announced late Friday night. One of those deals will result
in the formation of the nation's second largest S&L business owned
by a subsidiary of Ford Motor Co.
   Federal regulators and prospective buyers rushed to beat a
year-end deadline after which the tax breaks for purchasers of S&Ls
would be effectively cut in half. That proved to be a powerful
inducement to reach agreement, but it has led to mounting criticism
of the bank board's handling of the S&L mess.
   Critics charged that the deals, involving some of the biggest
insolvent institutions, had been unnecessarily generous to the
buyers, who have included such wealthy investors as Texas
billionaire Robert Bass.
   Various members of Congress complained that the deals were
saddling taxpayers with billions of dollars in open-ended
obligations. Specific objections were raised to the tax provisions
which in many cases will give the investors more in tax breaks than
they are putting up to purchase the S&Ls.
   Rep. Toby Roth, R-Wis., called on Attorney General Dick
Thornburgh to investigate whether the bank board was acting
responsibly in carrying out the latest round of S&L deals.
   ``It's incredible that a federal agency would enter into the
biggest sweetheart deal in history,'' Roth said in a letter to
Thornburgh. ``What we have are multibillion-dollar savings and loans
being sold for 1 percent cash down, coupled with tax breaks that are
worth even more.''
   But Lawrence White, a member of the bank board, defended the
agency.
   ``We are not squandering the taxpayers' money,'' he said Friday.
``I think we are being exceedingly responsible in the way we are
looking at the transactions.''
   Bank Board Chairman M. Danny Wall had hoped to complete 222 deals
by midnight Saturday, but bank board officials late Friday scaled
back the estimate to 216 or 217.
   That would still far surpass the 48 institutions which were
closed in 1987 and approach the all-time record of 277 set in 1938
during the Great Depression.
   Among the institutions closed on Friday were S&Ls in Colorado,
Florida, Illinois, Iowa, Montana, Ohio, Oklahoma and Texas, and the
deals included three of the largest bailouts the bank board has
agreed to.
   One of those involved $1.6 billion in government aid to First
Nationwide Financial Corp., a Ford Motor subsidiary, to assist it in
purchasing two failed S&Ls in Colorado and one each in Chicago and
Cleveland.
   The four insolvent institutions have assets of almost $8 billion
and they will be merged eventually into Ford's huge savings and loan
subsidiary, the First Nationwide Bank of San Francisco.
   The completed deal will give the automaker the nation's second
largest savings and loan business, with assets exceeding $34
billion. Ford will put up $170 million to acquire the four S&Ls.
   In another large bailout, the bank board said it was providing
$1.37 billion to assist in the purchase of United Savings
Association of Texas, one of the state's largest S&Ls with $4.4
billion in assets. It was being sold to Hyperion Partners, an
affiliate of a New York investment firm, which agreed to put up $200
million to make the purchase.
   In the third large package announced Friday, the bank board said
it was providing $1 billion in assistance for Golden West Financial
Corp. of Oakland, Calif., to manage two insolvent Florida S&Ls.
   Under the agreement, Golden West will manage the institutions and
will have the option to buy one of them, Beach Federal Savings and
Loan of Boynton Beach, at a later date. The other S&L which will be
managed by Golden West is New Metropolitan Federal Savings and Loan,
headquartered in Hialeah.

<HEAD>Woman Says Cave Isolation Intrigues Her</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HOLDEN LEWIS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>CARLSBAD, N.M. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An Italian interior designer says the
prospect of aiding science is what prompted her to volunteer to
spend up to five months in a cave, out of the sunlight and away from
the sound of another human voice with only 400 books to keep her
company.
   If she succeeds, Stefania Follini, 27, of Ancona, Italy, will set
a women's duration record for isolation in a cave. But her interest
is in the scientific value of the experiment that NASA officials
will monitor to draw parallels with the isolation experienced in
lengthy space flights.
   ``I understand there will be a lot of scientific interest in
this, and I want to add my contribution,'' she said Friday through
an interpreter.
   Ms. Follini was scheduled to enter the 21-foot-deep Lost Cave in
southeast Carlsbad on Sunday morning, but problems in getting
computers through Italian customs has pushed back the starting date
about a week, project organizer Maurizio Montalbini said.
   The purpose of the cave marathon is to find out how a woman's
body and psyche will react to the prolonged isolation. The only
voice Ms. Follini will hear will be her own, and she will not have a
clock or calendar.
   Montalbini once spent seven months in a cave, and other men have
spent up to six months underground. But Ms. Follini, who is hoping
to stay at least four and possibly five months, would be the woman's
record holder if she succeeds. The current cave-sitting record for a
woman is one month.
   Ms. Follini said she was fascinated by news of Montalbini's
seven-month underground stay, and decided to volunteer when she
heard that his Frontier Explorations and Researches Group wanted to
send a woman into a cave.
   Ms. Follini, who will not be paid for her role in the experiment,
said she likes the ambience of caves, the way she feels far away,
yet secure.
   ``I feel very excited and I want to go down there,'' she said.
   She is bringing along 400 books _ histories, novels and a book of
English grammar. The holder of a brown belt in judo plans to keep
fit by practicing judo, lifting dumbbells and doing gymnastics.
   Although she won't be able to see or hear another human,
scientists will be able to monitor her via a video camera and
microphones.
   But she won't have much chance to engage in her profession _
interior design _ because her living quarters will be a
100-square-foot, Plexiglas-enclosed module at the end of the
250-foot-long, 50-foot-wide cave.

   An estimated 246.9 million people are living in
the United States as 1989 begins, according to the Census Bureau.
   Demographers at the Commerce Department agency said the New
Year's Day estimate of 246,879,546 represents a 9 percent increase
over the April 1980 census count of 226,545,805.
   The Jan. 1, 1989, total is almost 2.3 million higher than the
1988 New Year's Day figure. The population is projected to grow by
2.2 million during 1989.
   The record for net population growth in a single year is 3.1
million, recorded during the baby boom year of 1956, when the U.S.
population was about 168 million.

   A Boston man charged with stealing a wedding
limousine tried to escape from custody using a fake gun made out of
soap, but he was foiled by a karate-trained deputy sheriff,
authorities said.
   Michael Callahan, 35, was being taken from a holding cell in the
basement of Dorchester District Court on Friday when Callahan pulled
out the bogus gun, officers said.
   Suffolk County Sheriff Robert Rufo said Callahan brandished the
``gun'' and told Deputy Frederick Pollini, who was escorting him:
``Get up against the wall.'' The deputy began to back off, then
knocked the bogus weapon out of his hand with a karate chop. Pollini
and a court officer then subdued Callahan.
   The sheriff said the soap gun was ``very realistic, especially
when he cupped it in his hand and all that showed was a four-inch
barrel.''
   Rufo said Callahan will face new charges in the escape attempt.
   Callahan is charged with robbing a tailor shop Dec. 17, then
stealing a limousine while the bride and three members of the bridal
party were inside.
   The chauffeur of the limousine had stopped at convenience store
and gotten out when a man jumped in and drove off with the other
four occupants. A short time later, the four were left in front of
the church.

engine ran over his head, police said Saturday.
   Shawn James Schultz, 21, of Escondido was with a group of friends
Friday evening when he lay down on the tracks while the others
watched, police said.
   Schultz apparently was playing ``chicken'' with the train, which
was traveling at about 30 to 40 mph on its route from Los Angeles to
San Diego, said Police Sgt. Richard Derouen.
   The friends did not help because ``the object of the game is to

   The engineer did not realize the train had been in an accident

<HEAD>For Rodino, Fairness Was The Quest During 40 Years In Congress</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEWARK, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The man who wept after the committee he led
voted articles of impeachment against former President Richard Nixon
wants to be remembered for one quality during his 40 years in
Congress: fairness.
   ``No one wants to pull down a president. There was only one thing
we needed to do, and that was to assure that our system of
government worked,'' recalled retiring Rep. Peter Rodino of New
Jersey. ``At a time when our country was in crisis, it was Rodino
that was at the helm, upholding the Constitution.''
   Packing up memorabilia in his Newark office recently, the
79-year-old Democrat who is stepping down after 40 years in the
House proudly displayed photos of himself with John and Robert
Kennedy, Lyndon Johnson and the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.
   On his desk, last among the items to be packed, were hefty, bound
transcripts of the 1974 impeachment hearings of President Richard
Nixon, which Rodino chaired.
   ``I believe in fairness and decency,'' the 79-year-old Democrat
said. He gives credit to two inspirations: his immigrant father and
the Constitution. His father, a tradesman, insisted that fairness be
``a part of my life,'' Rodino recalled.
   Rodino, who makes a habit of quoting the preamble to the
Constitution, said, ``In those 52 words, we have captured the
framework of a society that not only is strong and great, but is
caring and compassionate.''
   He was a drafter of the watershed 1964 Civil Rights Act, and
helped secure House passage of immigration reforms in 1965 and a
fair-housing law in 1966. Rodino has served as chairman of the
influential House Judiciary Committee since 1974.
   ``He sets an extraordinarily high standard ... for all who aspire
to public service,'' Sen. Bill Bradley of New Jersey said when
Rodino announced his retirement.
   But not all legislators would agree with Rodino's assessment of
himself.
   Some accused him of a common congressional trick: When he didn't
like a bill before his committee, he refused to act on it.
   Yet Rodino still sees himself in some ways as the young lawyer
from this city's North Ward, who was just back from the war in 1948
when fate and the votes of his fellow Italians put him into Congress.
   ``As you look back, you have to wonder: Why me?'' Rodino said.
   Rodino had failed two years earlier to oust veteran Rep. Fred
Hartley, coauthor of the Taft-Hartley labor law. When Hartley
retired a term later, Rodino's dream became a reality.
   Four decades later, Rodino is stepping down in the face of
another reality: Just as Italians once held power here, the city now
belongs largely to its black and Hispanic voters.
   The emerging minorities pressured Rodino to retire, but he
resisted. He was challenged in a 1986 primary election, and the Rev.
Jesse Jackson came to the state to campaign for Rodino's black
opponent. He won the nomination easily, hinting he would step down
after a final two years in Congress.
   Rodino's successor, Democrat Donald Payne, will be New Jersey's
first black congressman when he takes office this month.
   While sometimes seeming bitter about pressure to retire, Rodino
says he has been ready. His official reason for staying has been to
counter the presence of his ideological opposite, President Reagan.
   The centerpiece of Rodino's long career came in 1974 when, just
months after he became chairman, the Judiciary Committee was called
upon to hear charges on Nixon's role in the Watergate coverup.
   He recalled the admonition from Sen. John Stennis of Mississippi,
who told him, ``Fate called on you.''
   ``I said, `Don't tell me that. That's terrifying,''' Rodino
recalled.
   He also remembers the chaotic moment right after the Judiciary
Committee voted articles of impeachment. Rodino fought his way past
reporters into a cubbyhole office. He telephoned his wife, and wept.
   But though the hallmark of his reputation, Watergate was only
several months out of 40 years in Congess.
   Immigration has been a key Rodino issue, rooted in his own past.
In helping pass the 1965 reforms, Rodino said, he ended the
nationality-based quota systems he had seen as a boy keep families
apart.
   Rodino has accepted a visiting professorship at the Seton Hall
University School of Law here, which will name its new library in
his honor. He said his first priority will be to write a book of
memoirs. He'll also join his son's New Jersey law firm.

   Here is the text of President
Reagan's radio address Saturday:
   My fellow Americans, tonight we celebrate the coming of a New
Year, a time of expectation and promise. I believe it's going to be
a very good year indeed. Our economy is healthy, our defenses our
strong, and our policy of peace through strength is paying off in
spades.

be a great day for world peace.
   I'm also confident about 1989, because in just three weeks,
George Bush will be sworn in as the 41st president of the United
States, and a superb president he's going to be. He has handled
skillfully the selection of his cabinet and the transition process
is proceeding well and smoothly.
   So, the news is good this New Year's Eve. Of course, we still
reel in shock and horror from the bombing of Flight 103 over
Lockerbie, Scotland, and we extend our sympathy to the bereaved.
Now, if it seems likely our terrorists have crawled out of their
hole to threaten American lives, I can promise them this _ the
pledge we made to seek out the truth and punish the guilty is a
sacred one which George Bush shares.
   Indeed, President-elect Bush knows as thoroughly as anyone in the
world today the nature and problem of terrorism. As chairman of this
administration's Task Force on Terrorism, he oversaw a report that
is the toughest statement to date on the need for strong action,
including when warranted, military action against terrorists. That
report ought to be giving some people sleepless nights right about
now.
   That crime aside, however, there is little to disturb us about
the overall state of the nation as we join together to make merry
and sing ``Auld Lang Syne.'' But still during these days, when you
turn on the television or read through the newspaper, you might get
the idea that what faces George Bush upon his assumption of the
responsibilities of the presidency of the United States will be
nothing but a series of impossible choices, heartaches, and just
general trouble.
   Now I'm sure most of this talk is simply evidence that we're
about to go through a change of leadership, a moment in time that
does funny things to people particularly in Washington. For some,
this is a time to put in their bids on the agenda of the future; for
others, this is a time for the jitters, because they try to imagine
what the future will bring and find it a little confusing.
   These jitters have been overcome with courage and vision in both
the United States and Canada as the way has been cleared for an
historic new free trade agreement to take effect tomorrow. And I
want to assure you as we do take this time together to look ahead
that there is not a single major problem facing this country today
that cannot be solved when we come together to solve them. What it
takes is the political will to solve them _ rather like a successful
New Year's resolution.
   Now here are a few New Year's political resolutions I think could
be accomplished in 1989. I think we should resolve to keep within
the Gramm-Rudman targets and eliminate the deficit entirely by 1993.
I'll be telling you more about our budget for the next fiscal year
over the next few weeks. But let me just say that this new budget
represents a serious and dedicated effort to produce a realistic
plan for meeting our responsibilities to reduce the deficit,
maintain our defenses, and help the needy. I've said it before and
I'll say it again: all this can be done without raising taxes.
Higher taxes mean slow economic growth. And economic growth combined
with budget realism is the key to eliminating the deficit.
   George Bush's lips have been eloquent on this subject, and it
sure would be a great New Year if we continue the progress we made
this year _ putting an end to those mammoth continuing resolutions
and work with a real budget again.
   We can continue to improve relations with the Soviet Union in
1989 if we remember that the key to improved relations thus far has
been our strength and resolution. We must remain sober in our
estimation of our negotiating partners and without illusion. We know
about their goals and aims. Whether we're talking about bilateral
relations with the Soviet Union or efforts to achieve a negotiated
settlement in the Middle East, the lesson is the same.
   To achieve further reductions in international tensions, the
incoming administration will need appropriate levels of defense
spending _ not to mention support from Congress for their foreign
policy initiatives. Trust me, I know.
   Have a very happy New Year. And until next week, thanks for
listening, and God bless you.

   President Reagan said today he and
President-elect Bush have made a sacred pledge to identify and
punish whoever bombed Flight 103 and the possibility of military
action against terrorists ``ought to be giving some people sleepless
nights.''
   Despite some good news at the end of the year, including the
expected pullout of Soviet troops from Afghanistan, Reagan said in
his weekly radio address, ``we still reel in shock and horror from
the bombing of Flight 103,'' the Pan American jumbo jet that crashed
in Scotland last week killing 270 people.
   ``If, as seems likely, our terrorists have crawled out of their
hole to threaten American lives, we can promise them this: the
pledge we make to seek out the truth and punish the guilty is a
sacred one which George Bush shares,'' the president said.
   He said Bush, as chairman of a task force on terrorism, ``oversaw
a report that is the toughest statement to date on the need for
strong action, including, when warranted, military action, against
terrorists.''
   ``That report ought to be giving some people sleepless nights,
right about now,'' the president said.
   Reagan expressed confidence in his New Year's Eve broadcast from
the estate of publisher Walter Annenberg that the Soviet Union will
meet its Feb. 15 deadline for withdrawing all troops from
Afghanistan.
   ``I believe it's going to be a very good year, indeed,'' Reagan
said.
   ``In six weeks time the Soviet Union is due to pull its remaining
forces out of Afghanistan,'' he said. ``I`m confident the Soviets
will stick to their timetable and be out by the 15th of February,
which will then be a great day for world peace.''
   Reagan also said he looked forward with confidence to Bush's
inauguration, saying the vice president ``has handled skilfully the
selection of his Cabinet, and the transition process is proceeding
well and smoothly.''
   Reagan also said that the budget he will submit to Congress on
Jan. 9 ``represents a serious and dedicated effort to produce a
realistic plan for meeting our responsibilities to reduce the
deficit, maintain our defenses and help the needy.''
   ``All this can be done without raising taxes,'' he added.
``George Bush's lips have been eloquent on this subject,'' Reagan
said.
   The president planned to attend an annual New Year's Eve party at
the Annenberg estate.

   Swiss police on Saturday freed a Turkish
businessman reported kidnapped in Geneva and said they were holding
three Turkish nationals as suspects.
   Police spokesman Marcel Vaudroz told a press conference that
28-year-old Mehmet Reyhan was freed unharmed shortly before noon in
a Geneva apartment following a tip from a Geneva resident.
   Vaudroz said Reyhan was found in one room and that he was under
guard by two of the suspects who were in another room. He said they
had no firearms but carried knives. A third suspect was detained at
another unspecified location.
   The abductors, who had demanded $3.3 million ransom, were
identified by Vaudroz as Turkish nationals who had been in
Switzerland for several years pending a decision on their request
for political asylum. Their names were not disclosed.
   Vaudroz said it was too early to say whether the alleged
kidnappers were affiliated to any group opposed to the Turkish
government. Reyhan's family said the abductors identified themselves
in telephone calls as members of a group called ``Vengeance
Brigade'' of the outlawed Kurdish Labor Party, who are seeking to
set up an independent Kurdish state.
   ``I am very happy to free again,'' Mehmet Reyhan told reporters.
``At some point I feared for my life.''
   He said he was held up at gunpoint on Tuesday after he had
stepped out of his downtown hotel and then was taken away. He said
that attackers spoke Turkish but declined to say more about their
identity.
   He looked pale but in good health as he spoke briefly at the
police press conference where he was joined by his father, Ugur
Reyhan, and his twin-brother, Ali, who had come to Geneva at the
demand of the kidnappers.
   Ugur Reyhan is a member on the executive board of the
conservative Istanbul daily Tercuman, which broke the story of the
kidnapping. Mehmet is based in Luxembourg but travels to Switzerland
frequently on business.

   North Dakota should recognize the honeybee
because the ``little critter'' does so much for the economy, says a
senator pushing a bill to make the striped stinger the state's
official insect.
   Sen. Corliss Mushik said she would sponsor the legislation during
1989 on behalf of the North Dakota Beekeepers Association. The
legislature convenes Wednesday.
   ``I didn't even realize it was an insect,'' Mushik joked Friday.
``People in the beekeeping association want to recognize this little
critter that contributes a lot to the economy of North Dakota.''
   North Dakota historically has ranked among the top three states
in honey production, the state Agriculture Department said. North
Dakota produces an estimated 30 million pounds of honey each year
worth $20 million.
   State Bee Inspector Judy Carlson said the American Beekeeping
Federation wants Congress to designate the honeybee as the national
insect, but other groups are promoting the monarch butterfly.

   A real yellow brick road will be built
as part of a seven-day bash to celebrate the birthday of Judy
Garland, who was born Frances Gumm in this north-central Minnesota
town in 1922.
   Townspeople have celebrated Garland's June 10 birthday for about
15 years, but want to make the 67th anniversary of her birth special
because it coincides with the 50th anniversary of the release of
``The Wizard of Oz.''
   Organizers say they'll have parades of ``Oz'' characters daily,
and local actors will stage a nightly production of the musical. A
talent contest, celebrity dinner and free film festival also are
planned.
   They're trying to arrange appearances by Garland's daughter Liza
Minnelli; Mickey Rooney, who costarred in many of Garland's movies;
and some of the actors who played Munchkins in ``The Wizard of Oz.''
   The project is getting a $35,000 boost from a local foundation,
and townspeople say more money is being raised.
   Garland was the third daughter of Frank and Ethel Gumm,
performers and theater managers who moved from Grand Rapids to
California when Judy was 4.
   ``Growing up I always heard Judy Garland lived here when she was
young, but nothing special had been done to remember her,'' said
Jackie Dingmann, a Grand Rapids resident who got the Judy Garland
celebrations going in the mid-1970s. ``I believe she's one of the
greatest entertainers that ever lived. ... I think this is really
good for Grand Rapids.''
   Not everyone in the town appreciates Garland, who died in 1969.
Some recall her once saying that the town was ``a nice place to go
for a laugh.'' But Dingmann said Garland also referred to Grand
Rapids as ``a beautiful town.''

   A mustard yellow paint job on the house
considered the birthplace of the Episcopal Church in the United
States has been a sore point for years. New gray paint may have
finally quelled the dispute.
   ``It's a compromise,'' said Kate Sawyer, director of the historic
Glebe House.
   The new paint job on the building, which was in progress off and
on throughout the fall, is an attempt to strike a balance between
historical realism and modern taste, she said.
   ``The focus is still that it's an 18th-century site,'' she said.
The switch back to a more popular color allows that focus to come
across while ``giving the best presentation to the public.''
   In 1783, when Congregationalism was virtually the law of the
land, priests of the Church of England risked the wrath of
revolution-minded neighbors and secretly met there to elect the Rev.
Dr. Samuel Seabury the new nation's first Episcopal bishop.
   The house was owned at the time by the Rev. John Rutgers
Marshall, the first Episcopal priest to live in Woodbury.
   In 1980, the group that maintains the historic house commissioned
an analysis of the coats of paint worn by the house over the years.
The goal was to learn what color the house was when Marshall lived
there in order to make the site as authentic as possible.
   With the first strokes of yellow that followed the analysis, many
residents had a ``big negative reaction,'' said Mary Beth Baker, who
was the museum's curator at the time.
   Critics said the mustard yellow was garish and too conspicuous in
the historic neighborhood known as the Hollow.
   The gray paint job will be completed in the spring. Clapboards
near the roof peak are still mustard yellow.

<HEAD>Reagan Hails US-Canada Free Trade Agreement</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PALM SPRINGS, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Reagan on Saturday
authorized an exchange of diplomatic notes to put the U.S.-Canadian
free trade agreement into effect and called it ``an example for the
world on how eliminating trade barriers can benefit all peoples.''
   The president telephoned Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney
from the estate of publisher Walter Annenberg, where he is
vacationing, to congratulate him on the final approval of the pact
Friday by Canada's Senate.
   Reagan also took action under the law, through an executive
order, to permit the export to Canada of up to 50,000 barrels per
day of crude oil. The order affects oil that has been transported by
pipeline and oil from the naval petroleum reserves.
   Deputy White House Press Secretary Roman Popadiuk said the
exchange of diplomatic notes would put the agreement into effect as
of Sunday.
   ``The Free Trade Agreement established the world's largest free
trade zone involving two countries,'' Popadiuk said.
   The United States and Canada are each other's principal trading
partners, with two-way trade of nearly $150 billion in 1988.
   The agreement eliminates all tariffs between the two countries
over a 10-year period and eliminates or reduces many non-tariff
barriers.
   ``The agreement will also enhance energy security, improve the
investment climate, and significantly increase opportunities in the
services sector, including financial services,'' Popadiuk said.
   ``While the free trade agreement will not eliminate all trade
issues between our two countries, it gives us the framework to
manage them and the basis for expanding our economic relations,''
the White House spokesman said.
   Popadiuk quoted Reagan as saying, in his telephone call to
Mulroney, ``Together, our governments have set an example for the
world on how eliminating trade barriers can benefit all peoples.''

   The Soviet Union said Saturday its troops in
Afghanistan will cease fire on New Year's Day and appealed to the
United States to support the truce, but U.S.-backed rebels vowed to
keep fighting.
   The Foreign Ministry said ``all units of Soviet troops that still
remain in Afghanistan'' will lay down their arms on Jan. 1 and the
Soviets also are ready to stop supplying weapons to the Kabul
government. Afghan President Najib on Friday committed his forces to
the truce.
   ``The Soviet Union fully supports this peace move of the Afghan
leadership,'' the Foreign Ministry said in a statement.
   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev called for the truce in a Dec. 7
address to the United Nations, but the United States rejected it.
   On Friday, Alexander Bessmertnykh, a first deputy Soviet foreign
minister, met with U.S. Ambassador Jack Matlock to make a bid for
Washington's support.
   The official Tass news agency said Bessmertnykh also made the
pitch to the ambassador from Pakistan, which with the help of the
United States supplies arms to rebels fighting Afghanistan's Marxist
government.
   ``Hope is expressed in the Soviet Union that the Afghan
opposition and all countries ... first of all the United States and
Pakistan, will choose peace and through concrete actions respond to
the peaceful intentions of the Republic of Afghanistan and the
Soviet Union,'' the Foreign Ministry said in Saturday's statement.
   The statement, carried by Tass, did not make clear how long
Soviet troops would hold their fire if the rebels don't stop
shooting. Najib, however, said Moslem insurgents will be given four
days to accept the truce. If they refuse, government troops will
start shooting again, he said.
   Afghanistan's first deputy defense minister, Lt. Gen. Mohammad
Nabi Azimi, noted in a Tass interview Saturday that the rebels had
not adhered to previous truces.
   ``If the opposition does not agree to the cease-fire once again,
the army will deal powerful strikes at extremists in several areas
of the country after Jan. 5,'' Azimi warned.
   A rebel spokesman in Islamabad, Pakistan, dismissed the truce.
   ``We did not start our fight because he asked us to,'' said
Masood Khalili. ``And we won't stop because he asked us to.''
   Khalili belongs to the Jamiat-e-Islami guerrilla group whose
leader, Burhanuddin Rabbani, met in December with Soviet Deputy
Foreign Minister Yuli Vorontsov.
   The U.S.-backed guerrillas have been fighting Kabul's troops for
10 years. In December 1979, Soviet troops marched into Afghanistan
to bolster the Kabul government.
   The Foreign Ministry said both sides should stop aiding their
allies in the war.
   ``Addressing specifically the United States, the Soviet side
again reaffirms its readiness on the basis of reciprocity to
discontinue all supply of arms to the warring sides in Afghanistan
from Jan. 1,'' the statement said.
   Secretary of State George P. Shultz has rejected the proposal,
noting that the Soviets snubbed prior U.S. offers for mutual
cessation of outside aid.
   He said the rebels were justified in trying to seize territory as
the Soviets withdraw ``because the people of Afghanistan, broadly
speaking, do not accept the fact that the puppet regime is entitled
to hold certain areas of that country.''
   A senior Western diplomat, explaining why the United States will
not go along with the aid cutoff, said the Soviets poured in a huge
amount of military supplies to Afghanistan in preparation for the
New Year's peace moves.
   On May 15, the Soviet Union began withdrawing its estimated
100,000 soldiers from Afghanistan under a U.N.-brokered agreement.
Half of the Soviet troops have left the country and the remaining
half are to pull out by Feb. 15.
   But Soviet officials say they have suspended their troop
withdrawal temporarily because of continuing U.S. and Pakistani aid
to the rebels.

   Bobbing and prancing, pumping their elbows,
cake-walking in gold-painted shoes, 22,000 marchers will strut their
sequins and silks in a time-honored city funfest, the New Year's Day
Mummers parade.
   They are mostly men, these merrymakers in their costumes and
dresses of many colors and their fancy wigs. Unless weather pushes
back the parade a day, they will preen and parade for more than 12
hours Sunday, much of the time to the tune of ``Oh, Dem Golden
Slippers.''
   Mummery, the prancing and wearing of masks and costumes for the
sheer fun of it, traces its origins back 2,400 years to the Greek
god Momus. In Philadelphia, the first formal parade was in 1901, but
neighborhood parades go back to at least 1877.
   The parade, which will include all ages from children pushed in
decorated carriages to folks in their 80s, follows a 2{-mile route
up Broad Street to City Hall.
   A total of $286,470 in city prizes will be awarded to the best,
funniest and most handsome costumes and to string bands with the
sweetest music. In 1901, the city put up $1,725.
   The money, then and now, doesn't come close to covering costume
costs which, under Mummer rules, must be new every year except for
outfits worn by comics, who may reuse materials from past years.
   A string band with some 60 members spends nearly $50,000 for
their outfits, far short of the $7,030 first prize. These days, such
outfits are made mostly by professional costumers.
   ``Clubs make up the difference by fund-raising events, like
raffles, cake sales and dances, throughout the year,'' said Fred
Calandra, president of the New Year Shooters & Mummers Association.
``The string bands travel the country performing, and that's how
they pay their costs.''
   If the weather cooperates, a million people are expected to crowd
the sidewalks to watch the cavorting Mummers.
   Special attractions are the 24 string bands and the 18 fancy
brigades and the thousands of comics who do their special strut in
gold-painted shoes as they satirize and ridicule, mimic and jeer,
mostly to the parade's theme music, ``Oh, Dem Golden Slippers.''
   Until a decade ago, the Mummers Parade was all-male. Under threat
of a lawsuit, women were allowed on the street. Some of the ``gals''
are still the female impersonators who brave the generally freezing
temperatures in bare-armed evening dresses and fancy wigs.
   Over the centuries, the spirit of mummery has been adapted. Latin
laborers marched masked while exchanging gifts, the Celts used
``trick-or-treat'' variations.
   The British, Swedes and Germans, among the early American
immigrants, brought the heraldry to this birthplace of independence.
They would powder or blacken their faces, beat on pots to chase away
the devils in the new year.
   Now, rich and poor, lawyers, doctors and teachers all join in.
   Even priests: Brother John this year portrays an Egyptian. Before
that he was a jungle dancer and an Indian and boasts proudly, ``I'm
a pretty good dancer.''
   ``My religious life comes first,'' Brother John says. ``But this
(Mummery) is for relaxation.''

<HEAD>Arafat Seeks Results Soon From U.S., Faction Warns Of Trap</HEAD>

   PLO chairman Yasser Arafat declared
Saturday he expects results from his talks with the United States
soon. But a Marxist Palestinian faction warned him not to make too
many concessions.
   The statement from the Democratic Front for the Liberation of
Palestine underlined the fragility of Arafat's peace initiative even
within the Palestine Liberation Organization.
   Radical factions within the movement have stressed they do not
believe that moderation will succeed in persuading Israel to accept
the independent Palestinian state proclaimed in the Israeli-occupied
West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   Arafat boasted in a statement broadcast by the Baghdad-based
``Voice of the Palestinian Revolution'' radio: ``We were able to
impose our will on the United States to recognize the Palestinian
reality.
   ``We are looking for the results of this dialogue in the region
shortly,'' he stressed.
   Arafat's statement, broadcast on the eve of the 24th anniversary
of the first attacks against Israel launched by his Fatah guerrilla
movement Jan. 1, 1965, did not elaborate.
   But the PLO is seeking through the talks, which began Dec. 16 in
Tunisia, to pressure Israel to negotiate a peace settlement at an
international Middle East conference and win wider recognition by
the Americans.
   Washington lifted a 13-year ban on talks with the PLO only after
Arafat explicitly recognized Israel and renounced terrorism in
Geneva Dec. 15, despite reservations by radical PLO factions and
opposition from extremist Syrian-backed dissident groups.
   Arafat's statement hailed the year-old Palestinian uprising in
the West Bank and Gaza Strip, where the PLO has called on the 1.5
million Palestinians there to mark ``Fatah Day'' with ``violent
actions, stones, firebombs and demonstrations'' against the
Israelis, who captured the territories in 1967.
   Arafat said the uprising will continue ``until the occupation is
ended and an independent state is established.''
   He declared there would be no peace in the occupied zones until
``the national rights of our people are recognized.''
   The leader of the Democratic Front for the Liberation of
Palestine, Nayef Hawatmeh, called for an escalation in the uprising.
   But in a statement telexed by the faction's headquarters in
Damascus to The Associated Press in Cyprus, Hawatmeh said that
``maneuvers to stop the uprising under slogans of a partial truce or
deals with occupation forces will never succeed.''
   He added: ``We warn the PLO to beware of becoming a victim of
this trap.''
   Another major PLO faction, the Marxist Popular Front for the
Liberation of Palestine led by George Habash, split from Arafat with
other radical factions in a Syrian-backed mutiny to protest Arafat's
increasing moderation.
   But the two factions reconciled with the PLO leader in Algiers
last year, seriously weakening a Damascus-based opposition front.
These two factions and Arafat's mainstream Fatah group make up 80
percent of the PLO's guerrilla force.
   Habash reluctantly went along with a resolution passed last month
by the Palestine National Council, the PLO's parliament-in-exile,
implicitly recognizing Israel.
   But he said he did not believe moderation will pay and told
Arafat that if his initiative collapsed the council would be
convened to endorse a more militant policy.

   Talk about an inequality. 1988 was the year
that a post-Depression record number of banks failed with hardly
anyone taking note, while virtually the same number of savings and
loans failed with a thud that is shaking the walls of the Oval
Office.
   The answer to that puzzling disparity is really the story of two
insurance funds, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. and the Federal
Savings and Loan Insurance Corp. The FDIC and the FSLIC.
   Those letters are emblazoned at the entrances of thousands of
financial institutions across the nation as a beacon of assurance
for the institution's depositors. It wasn't always that way.
   Before there was federal deposit insurance, economic downturns
were not called recessions but panics, because that is often what
worried depositors did. At the first whiff of trouble, they would
form long lines at the teller windows to withdraw their money.
   During the Great Depression of the 1930s, hundreds of banks
closed, wiping out not only depositors who couldn't get to the bank
in time but bank stockholders as well. For that reason, Congress
stepped in and created the FDIC, to insure deposits at commercial
banks, and the FSLIC, to do the same at savings and loan
associations.
   The mission of both agencies is the same: to put the government's
backing behind deposits, now insuring up to $100,000 in each account.
   But while the mission is identical, the economic fortunes of the
two funds are not.
   L. William Seidman, chairman of the FDIC, noted in a year-end
message that the banks' insurance fund had handled a post-Depression
record of 221 bank failures and assistance packages in 1988, up from
203 in 1987.
   That figure is very close to the 216 S&Ls that the Federal Home
Loan Bank Board, which oversees the FSLIC, expected to close by
midnight Saturday.
   But while the FDIC closings have proceeded in a business-as-usual
atmosphere largely out of the limelight, despite the large number,
the FSLIC closings have grabbed headlines and triggered a spate of
congressional investigations. The problems is also occupying a good
deal of the time of President-elect Bush's transition team.
   The difference is a disparity in the two fund's ability to pay to
mop up the problems.
   The wave of failed banks translated into an estimated loss for
the FDIC of between $3 billion and $4 billion in 1988, the first
year the fund's assets have failed to grow. But even with that
decline, the fund is expected to end the year with a tidy nest egg
of $15 billion, down from $18.3 billion a year ago.
   And Seidman predicted that the FDIC fund would begin growing
again in 1989 as the number of bank failures start declining. What
that means is that the turmoil in the banking industry caused by
financial deregulation in the 1980s can be handled by the insurance
fees assessed on the industry, without the need to resort to tapping
general revenues. It also means the FDIC can shut down insolvent
banks on a timely basis.
   That's not the case with the FSLIC fund, which has been forced to
keep hundreds of insolvent S&Ls open because it did not have the
money to deal with the problem, which keeps growing at a rate of $1
billion a month.
   Presently, the estimates of the ultimate cost of cleanup for the
S&L crisis range from a low of $50 billion, made by the Federal Home
Loan Bank Board, to a high of $112 billion, the latest projection
from the General Accounting Office, the auditing arm of Congress.
   But the expectations of revenues the FSLIC will be receiving to
deal with the crisis, primarily from assessments on healthy S&Ls,
amount to only about $30 billion.
   That means that even under the most optimistic assumptions,
Congress and the incoming Bush administration will have to find a
way to bridge a gap of about $20 billion.
   The Bush team _ led by Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady, who is
staying on in the new administration, and incoming Budget Director
Richard Darman _ is already focusing on the problem.
   Reports indicate that the new administration is currently
focusing on proposals that would limit the impact on the budget by
resorting to various off-budget financial schemes and other
accounting gimmicks.
   However, many believe that this would be the wrong approach to
take, compounding problems created by the Reagan administration when
it delayed facing up the full extent of the S&L crisis.
   ``The Bush administration will be committing political suicide if
it doesn't candidly address the problem immediately after taking
office,'' said Bery Ely, a financial consultant in Alexandria, Va.
   But crafting a politically acceptable solution will not be easy,
given the magnitude of the final cost to taxpayers.
   ``The bailout to come will be the largest ever in the history of
the United States. It will be far bigger than the combined cost of
the assistance given, after intensive congressional scrutiny, to
Chrysler, Lockheed and New York City,'' retiring Sen. William
Proxmire observed in a recent speech. ``To make the bad news even
worse, the longer Congress waits to appropriate the money, the
greater the ultimate cost will be to the nation's taxpayers.''

   Five weeks after making the boldest move in the
28th Chess Olympiad, the Soviet chess player and the captain of the
American team she secretly married are focused on their goal for the
new year.
   Newlyweds Elena Akhmilovskaya and John Donaldson are trying to
get Soviet authorities to allow her 7-year-old daughter, Dana, to
come to the United States, specifically to Seattle where they are
looking to buy a home.
   As she adjusts to her American life, the third-ranked woman chess
player in the world is making plans to play competition chess for
the United States, where she is the No. 1 ranked woman. She also is
applying for a ``green card'' as a permanent resident.
   But Ms. Akhmilovskaya, 31, said during an interview Friday that
she won't feel totally at home until her daughter is with her.
   Her lawyer said Friday from New York that he is optimistic the
Soviets will release the child.
   After Ms. Akhmilovskayaer and Donaldson married Nov. 25 during
the Chess Olympiad in Greece, they left the country with the entire
U.S. men's and women's chess teams escorting them through the
airport, scouting for trouble.
   Ms. Akhmilovskaya said she wanted to stay until the end of the
tournament, but after news of the marriage leaked, she and Donaldson
feared the Soviets would refuse to let her go.
   Donaldson, 30, said that Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev spoke on
his recent trip to New York about finding ``human solutions for
human problems.''
   This is a case where the human solution is clear, Donaldson said.
Ms. Akhmilovskaya's ex-husband in the Soviet Union also wants the
girl to live with her mother, Donaldson said.
   While she waits for her daughter, Ms. Akhmilovskaya is settling
into a life in Seattle that is far different from the one she left
behind. The couple met at a chess match in Cuba in 1985.
   As a leading chess celebrity in Soviet Georgia, she could walk
down the street and be recognized by autograph-seekers and fans who
knew of her ability to withstand and win grueling six-hour chess
matches. Here, she's unknown except to chess players.
   Donaldson, an international master ranked among the top 400 men
players, is associate editor of Inside Chess, a magazine for serious
chess players that features move-by-move accounts of major games.
His wife is now helping him in the magazine's small Seattle office
where a large wooden chess board shares space with personal
computers.
   But the two have never played each other, Donaldson said, both in
the interest of marital harmony and because they know so much about
each other's games from long discussion that it would almost be
``like playing yourself.''
   Donaldson said that most women would not consider a man's
collection of 700 chess books as a great asset.
   ``But Elena, she's different,'' he said.
   She said she tries to study about four hours a day to sharpen
skills she began to learn at the age of 11. Her mother was an
accomplished amateur player. Ms. Akhmilovskaya said she takes great
joy in the game and is looking forward to the chance to compete
against men.
   She recently played twice against grand master Yasser Seirawan,
the top-ranked man in the United States.
   ``Of course he beat me, but I will improve,'' she said.

   A former aide to Indian guru Bhagwan Shree
Rajneesh has returned to Oregon following her release from prison in
California, where she served time for food-poisoning and wiretapping
convictions.
   Ma Anand Puja, former secretary of the Rajneesh Medical Corp.,
was convicted of helping cause a 1984 salmonella epidemic that
sickened about 750 people in the town of The Dalles. She was also
convicted of helping install a wiretapping network at Rajneeshpuram,
a ranch in the high desert of central Oregon that served as the
guru's world headquarters until he was deported in 1985.
   Puja, 40, also known as Diane Yvonne Onang, was released Thursday
from the Federal Correctional Institution at Pleasanton, Calif.,
after serving 39 months.
   She spent Thursday night at a halfway house in Portland pending
her release, according to David Looney, supervising U.S. probation
officer in Portland.
   She still has three years of probation to serve, said Baron C.
Sheldhl, an assistant U.S. attorney in Portland.

   Air travelers worldwide welcomed
stringent security checks imposed after the bombing of Pan Am Flight
103 and took a ``better safe than sorry'' attitude Saturday when
faced with brief delays resulting from extra precautions.
   Some even complained that security wasn't strict enough, while
others boarded with a more fateful attitude _ that no matter how
tight security is, it can't always prevent a terrorist attack.
   Light traffic was reported at most airports New Year's Eve, and
few complaints about inconvenience were heard by airport workers
ordered to carefully check all luggage and passengers.
   Closer security checks were ordered at airports around the world
in response to the Dec. 21 bombing of Pan Am Flight 103, which
killed all 259 people on the jet and left about 11 people on the
ground in Lockerbie, Scotland missing and presumed dead.
   ``Better safe than sorry,'' said American traveler Paula Hampton
when asked about short delays reported at Frankfurt Airport. The
wife of an American serviceman stationed at Baumholder, Ms. Hampton
said she had expected even longer waits.
   A TWA employee said on condition of anonymity that the airline
took extra precautions at Frankfurt but she could not discuss them.
She said little change was needed because of existing policies on
baggage and passenger checks.
   Airports across Asia tightened security after a warning that
Palestinian terrorists plan to attack a commercial airliner in the
region by Jan. 10.
   At Tokyo's Narita Airport, an Air-India official said on
condition of anonymity that the information came from Indian
intelligence sources.
   Stricter security measures also were reported at airports in New
Delhi, Calcutta, Bombay, Madras, Manila, Hong Kong, Taipei, Taiwan
and Dhaka, Bangladesh.
   At Rome's Leonardo da Vinci Airport, a policeman standing guard
at an entrance to the international departures terminal did random
checks on entering passengers and visitors.
   ``It doesn't matter what they look like. I search men, women and
children. I make them open their bags,'' he said, putting a finger
on the trigger of his automatic weapon when approached by a young
man.
   An Associated Press reporter wandering the airport to interview
people was questioned by a policeman who wanted to know what he was
doing.
   Nevertheless, American businessman Frank Nicosia of Los Angeles
said he was disappointed by the the level of special security
measures at Rome. ``I was routed through Madrid, where I find
security is tighter these days,'' he said.
   Officials at many airlines said security has long been tight.
   ``You can't maximize the maximum,'' said Aqel Biltaji, senior
vice president for airport services at Jordan's Queen Alia
international airport.
   Most passengers at British their airports have been very
cooperative, according to airline officials.
   ``Only one or two have complained, but they became very
embarrassed when it was pointed out that we are trying to prevent
another disaster like Lockerbie,'' said a Pan Am agent at London's
Heathrow Airport.
   Businessman Peter Meyer of Detroit, flying from London to New
York on Pan Am, said the airlines should do whatever is necessary to
protect passengers.
   ``If that means delay at the check-in or more inconvenience, so
be it. No one wants a repeat of the disaster,'' he said before
leaving London.
   American student Cassie Howell, 19, returning to Berkeley,
Calif., after spending Christmas in England, said she was glad the
checks were so thorough.
   ``They wanted to know all about my itinerary, where I had been
and where I was going. They also asked if I had any gifts in my
luggage that other people had given me to pass on, or if I had
packed all my bags myself,'' she said.
   Officials at Israel's Ben-Gurion Airport near Tel Aviv said no
new security measures were necessary because of already stringent
measures.
   At Madrid's Barajas Airport, director Francisco Garcia also
reported little change from what he described as already strong
anti-terrorist measures.
   He said security surrounding arrivals and departures of U.S. jets
has long been tight, with X-rays of all luggage, prohibition of all
non-passengers from boarding areas and restrictions around planes
loaded with baggage.
   Security was visibly stepped up at Glasgow airport in Scotland,
according to travelers there, with close inspection of all hand
luggage.
   Airports in the Persian Gulf region have long had some of the
tightest security measures, but travelers at Bahrain airport said
they noticed even closer checks are being made of baggage now.
   One passenger said on condition of anonymity that restrictions on
carrying appliances or equipment using dry-cell batteries would
complicate travel for those who use lap-top computers.
   In Rome, a 22-year-old American woman looked nervous as she
clutched her U.S. passport while waiting for a flight to Paris.
   ``If I were going to the States, I wouldn't fly an American
airline,'' she said, refusing to give her name.
   William Heller of Boston was taking British Airways from Rome to
London, where he planned to take a flight on Northwest Airlines to
the East Coast.
   ``I can't be too worried because no matter how good the security
is, it (terrorist attack) can still be done,'' he said.

   Mel Gibson said he was torn between becoming a
journalist or a chef after graduating from high school when his
sister submitted an application in his name to a drama school.
   Now, the 32-year-old Gibson said, ``My sister wants 10 percent.''
   The Australian-born star of the recently released film ``Tequila
Sunrise'' said in the Jan. 12 issue of Rolling Stone that he was
``terrified'' on the set of ``Mad Max,'' the 1979 low-budget film
that made more than $100 million worldwide and catapulted him to
stardom.
   Gibson played down his good looks, for which People magazine
named him ``Sexiest Man Alive'' in 1984, and called his craft ``the
art of lying well.''
   ``With acting you can do extreme things,'' he said. ``It's kind
of good to be able to supersede human nature by becoming someone
else in a film. ... I'm paid to tell elaborate lies.''

   Despite a reputation as one of the
nation's rising young conductors and guest appearances with the New
York Philharmonic and other major orchestras, Raymond Harvey says
strangers still ask what railroad he works for when he is introduced
as a conductor.
   ``There are times when you just wish people's minds were more
open,'' said the 37-year-old director of the Springfield Symphony,
who calls it an ``embarrassment'' that he can still count the number
of black symphony conductors on the fingers of one hand.
   ``It just takes a confidence in your own abilities and courage to
do what you think is right and what you are talented for, whether or
not there are a lot of role models around,'' he said.
   Harvey, who holds a doctorate from Yale, was associate director
of the Buffalo Philharmonic before coming to Springfield.
   ``I consider myself a conductor, who happens to be black, and not
a black conductor,'' Harvey said. ``I have a rule that the first
time I appear with an orchestra it will not be in a Martin Luther
King or Black History Month concert. I like doing those kinds of
concerts, but not for the first time I appear with an orchestra.''

   Red bow ties will be the order of the day
Friday in honor of Thad Eure's 19,009th and final day as North
Carolina's secretary of state.
   Gov. Jim Martin has been asked to proclaim Friday ``Red Bow Tie
Day'' in honor of Eure and the trademark tie he has worn to work
every day for 52 years.
   The 89-year-old Eure is the nation's longest-serving secretary of
state, having taken office Dec. 21, 1936.
   Martin will be among those sporting a red tie at a Capitol
Rotunda reception Friday sponsored by Elon College to honor Eure,
who has been a member of the college's Board of Trustees since 1946.
   ``Thad Eure is North Carolina's most beloved statesman,'' said
Elon President Fred Young. ``We are pleased to join others in

   The Rev. Jesse Jackson returns to radio in
February with twice-daily 90-second vignettes focused on issues that
affect blacks, it was announced Friday.
   ``The Jesse Jackson Commentary'' premieres Feb. 1 and is
scheduled for syndicated broadcast on more than 120 radio stations
coast-to-coast, said Bob Dockery Jr., president of Syndicate It
Productions.
   ``We are excited to have someone as dynamic as Jesse Jackson back
on the air,'' Dockery said in a press release. ``Certainly there is
no more eloquent spokesperson for Americans than Jesse Jackson. He
transcends race, color and creed, and has a true understanding of
the problems that face us all.''
   Jackson did a similar radio program from 1985 to the summer of
1987 before he suspended the show to run for the Democratic
presidential nomination that went to Massachusetts Gov. Michael
Dukakis.

   Police attacked 140 mostly African students
with truncheons and cattle prods Saturday in five hours of unrest
near a house where the foreigners were isolated after a week of
racial violence, witnesses said.
   Officers moved in to arrest a student from Ghana in connection
with a Christmas Eve campus brawl that sparked five days of
anti-African protests in this eastern Chinese city, a student source
said.
   About 300 to 400 police officers surrounded the restaurant of the
guest house outside Nanking to arrest Alex Dzabaku Dosoo, a student
at Hehai University accused of beating a university employee in the
fight.
   Police ordered the students to come out, then burst into the
building, striking them with truncheons and shocking them with
electric cattle prods, according to two African students and a
Nepalese student.
   The witnesses, interviewed separately, spoke on condition of
anonymity, saying they feared for their lives.
   The 140 students were herded into a field near the guest house,
and police demanded they get on buses. The witnesses said that when
the students resisted by holding onto each other, police divided
them into groups according to the college they attended.
   ``They were taking them by force and beating them,'' said one of
the African students. ``When we walked out, I personally saw one
Congo student being beaten by _ I don't know _ six or seven
policemen.''
   He said he saw one student with a large gash above his eye, but
the number or extent of other injuries was not known.
   Police used loudspeakers to order the students to return to their
schools.
   ``We tried to tell them that it was not safe to go back,'' said
one of the Africans. He said the students were waiting for diplomats
from their countries, with whom they had met at the guest house
Tuesday.
   Police forced 16 students to return to their colleges, nine to
Hehai and seven to Nanking Polytechnic Institute, the witnesses said.
   Seven or eight others were isolated as ``troublemakers,'' the
witnesses said. It was unknown where they or the rest of the
students were taken.
   An American television crew that approached the guest house
Saturday was stopped by police accompanied by members of the
People's Armed Police, China's paramilitary force.
   On Monday, the 140 foreign students had fled to the railway
station in Nanking to try to leave the city, but were forced by
police to move to the factory guest house outside the city.
   Liang Ruiju, president of Hehai University, said Saturday that
the students had ``turned the guest house into an independent
kingdom.''
   ``They have girlfriends in there. I feel bad about saying this,
but some white women, maybe they're their wives or something, are
not willing to leave the Africans,'' Liang said.
   He said students barricaded the entrance to the building since
Wednesday to prevent Chinese officials from entering.
   But the African students said: ``That's crazy. There was nothing
like that. We were completely isolated from the outside.''
   An Associated Press reporter was prevented from entering the
building on Wednesday, and switchboard operators have refused to
connect calls to the students.
   The students isolated as ``troublemakers'' were from Benin,
Congo, Ghana and Zambia. The others were from various African
countries, Japan, Western Europe, Nepal, Bangladesh and Pakistan.
Five Americans left the guest house before Saturday's unrest.
   The Dec. 24 fight, which broke out when African students brought
Chinese girlfriends to a dance, was followed by violent protests in
which thousands of Chinese youths destroyed property in the
students' dormitories and marched through the streets chanting such
slogans as ``Beat the black devils!''
   Zhang Jitao, a university employee, suffered serious injuries in
the fight and remains in intensive care, said sources in Nanking.
Eleven Chinese and two Africans were injured, a student source said.
   China long has provided scholarships for African students in a
show of Third World solidarity, and about 1,500 Africans from 40
nations are studying in China.
   In past years, however, violence has broken out between Africans
and Chinese, who resent the better living conditions provided foreign
   A confrontation between African students and Chinese also broke
out in Hangzhou, 143 miles southeast of Nanking. Fifty-six Africans
locked themselves in their dormitory to protest what they said was
their university's attempt to link them to the deadly disease AIDS.
   The Africans on Monday drove Chinese employees out of their
dormitory at Zhejiang Agriculture University and began boycotting
classes. They said the telephone switchboard operator was warning
incoming Chinese callers that all the Africans had acquired immune
deficiency syndrome. Kong Xiangyou, vice president of the
university, denied the students' allegations.
   But Vincent Ongas, of Kenya, told the AP the students would not
leave the dormitory until the university promised it would ``stop
spreading propaganda against us.''
   One African student at the school was sent home in November after
testing positive for AIDS, but all other Africans there tested
negative, a Cameroon student said Friday.

   A report overseen by President-elect
Bush advocating possible military action against terrorists ``ought
to be giving some people sleepless nights'' in the wake of the
bombing of Pan Am Flight 103, President Reagan said Saturday.
   In his weekly radio talk, broadcast from the estate of publisher
Walter Annenberg in nearby Rancho Mirage, Reagan said he believes
1989 ``is going to be a very good year indeed.''
   ``Our economy is healthy, our defenses are strong and our policy
of peace through strength is paying off in spades,'' he said.
   Nevertheless, said the president, ``we still reel in shock and
horror from the bombing of Flight 103.''
   ``If, as seems likely, our terrorists have crawled out of their
hole to threaten American lives, I can promise them this: the pledge
we made to seek out the truth and punish the guilty is a sacred one
which George Bush shares.''
   ``Indeed, President-elect Bush knows as thoroughly as anyone in
the world today the nature and problem of terrorism,'' he said. ``As
chairman of this administration's task force on terrorism he oversaw
a report that is the toughest statement to date on the need for
strong action, including, when warranted, military action against
terrorists.''
   ``That report ought to be giving some people sleepless nights
right about now,'' the president said without elaboration.
   Reagan also said that he is confident the Soviet Union will meet
its Feb. 15 target date for withdrawing all of its troops from
Afghanistan.
   He renewed his commitment to having a balanced federal budget by
1993, and said the budget he will submit on Jan. 9 will be a step in
that direction.
   Giving the Democratic response to Reagan was New York Sen. Daniel
Patrick Moynihan, who said changes undertaken together by Congress
and the Reagan administration have put Social Security on a strong
financial footing _ contrasting with early 1980s predictions that
the system was going bankrupt.
   ``Social Security is the most successful program for fighting
poverty ever devised in our land,'' Moynihan said, contending that
without Social Security almost half the elderly would be poor.
   The president and first lady Nancy Reagan planned to see the new
year in as usual at a party attended by about 100 guests at the
Annenberg estate. Other invited guests included Secretary of State
George P. Shultz and his wife, Helena, and others from Reagan's
official family.
   In the afternoon, the president and Shultz scheduled a round of
golf with the legendary golfers Lee Trevino and Tom Watson on the
private course at the Annenberg estate, Sunnylands.

   Here is the text of the Democratic response to
President Reagan's weekly radio address delivered Saturday:
   This is Senator Pat Moynihan of New York wishing all of you a
Happy New Year and asking you to join me in a very special wish for
President and Mrs. Reagan.
   He and I have been having at each other in these Saturday
broadcasts on and off for eight hears now. They have been fair
fights from first to last, and well, Mr. President, I'm going to
miss them. Come to think, our first go-around had to do with Social
Security, which is what I'd like to talk about today.
   Back in the beginning of the 1980s, many people thought Social
Security was finished. The new budget director said it would soon be
bankrupt. A lot of people new to government simply panicked, and in
April 1981, huge benefit reductions were proposed.
   Well, there is no need for that, and the Senate put a stop to it.
The system did need some changes, and two years later, we agreed to
them. Let me be clear, Mr. President, you share the credit for those
changes. They've been in place now long enough to measure the
results. Let me give you then a year-end report on your Social
Security finances.
   I can report that the trust funds are in fine shape, in great
shape. They are rising by $109,440,000 the day. The actuaries tell
us they will continue building up for the next 40 years. And that's
the good news, so much that of a sudden we are hearing there is too
much money in Social Security and that much of it goes to people who
don't need it.
   Happily, this week, a revolutionary new study by the Bureau of
the Census put an end to this proposition. The Census counted every
penny of personal income and government benefits for the whole
population, enabling us to judge just how well off people are with
Social Security and how badly off they would be without it. Pretty
bad is the answer. Without Social Security, almost half of the
elderly would be poor today. With Social Security, Medicare and
other government programs, the number of elderly poor has all but
disappeared.
   Let us then hear no more about ``middle-class entitlements.''
Social Security is the most successful program for fighting poverty
ever devised in our land.
   I wish I could report that the new census study concluded the
same for children. It did not. Save for those who receive survivors
insurance, government benefit programs hardly touch child poverty.
The new Census report tells us what we have suspected for a long
time, but never seen actually computed. This is that there are two
kinds of children in America, and they live in two kinds of
families. Children in two-parent families, as near as makes no
matter, will never be poor. By contrast, children who live in
single-parent families will almost always be poor sooner or later.
And their numbers are staggering. As many as one-third of our
children live this way today.
   We've become the first industrial nation on Earth in which
children are the worst off group. This has become a fact which
distinguishes America from other democracies. In some of those
countries they would no more allow a child to remain poor than they
would allow one to remain sick when there was a cure for the
illness. That is why leaders such as Governor Mario Cuomo have
declared a ``Decade of the Child.'' It is the great challenge before
us. If we get to work, it will really be a happy New Year.
   This is Senator Pat Moynihan, and thank you for listening.

   Israeli troops killed two Palestinians on
Saturday as Arabs marked the 24th anniversary of the first PLO
attack against Israel. A boy died of injuries from an earlier clash,
and 10 people were wounded at his funeral, Arab reports said.
   Nine more people were reported hurt in clashes with soldiers in
the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip, where residents observed a
general strike called by Moslem fundamentalists.
   The army imposed a curfew on the occupied Gaza Strip, confining
650,000 Palestinians to their homes in anticipation of increased
violence on ``Fatah Day.'' Sunday is the anniversary of the first
attack against Israel by the Palestine Liberation Organization's
Fatah faction on Jan. 1, 1965.
   The army brought reinforcements into the occupied lands and
ordered nearly 1,200 West Bank schools closed for a week.
   In Gaza City and the West Bank towns of Bethlehem and Nablus,
residents shot off firecrackers and chanted ``Allahu Akhbar'' in
early celebrations of Fatah Day, Arab reporters said.
   In Nablus, four soldiers in uniform commandeered a Mercedes with
local license plates and later opened fire from the car on youths
gathered on the street outside the home of 22-year-old Saki Teeti,
witnesses told an Arab reporter.
   The shots struck Teeti in the chest, and he later died at the
city's Al Ittihad Hospital, Arab doctors said.
   An army spokeswoman said the incident was under investigation.
   In Arab east Jerusalem, 14-year-old Anwar Buhti of the West Bank
village Shuweikah died at Mukassed Hospital, doctors and army
officials said. Buhti was shot in the head during a clash with
troops Dec. 7.
   In Shuweikah, hundreds of residents, some masked, joined Buhti's
funeral procession. They marched behind the body wrapped in an
outlawed Palestinian flag and a black-and-white keffiyeh headdress,
both symbols of Palestinian nationalism.
   Mourners chanted pro-PLO slogans, Arab witnesses said. Some
hoisted Palestinian flags and black flags of mourning.
   Troops opened fire to disperse the crowd, wounding 10 Shuweikah
residents ranging in age from 16 to 31, hospital officials said. The
army confirmed eight wounded.
   In the West Bank village Beit Rima near Ramallah, residents
attacked an army patrol, an army spokesman said. Troops opened fire,
killing one man, he said, but did not give further details.
   The three deaths brought to 345 the number of Palestinians killed
since the start of the uprising nearly 13 months ago. Fourteen
Israelis also have died.
   In other clashes, nine other Palestinians were wounded, Arab
hospital officials said. The army was checking the reports.
   Left-wing Israeli legislator Yossi Sarid said troops killed 31
Palestinians and wounded more than 400 in December in what he said
was a monthly record for the uprising.
   Sarid blamed the increase on what he called the unrestrained use
of plastic bullets. He demanded that the army no longer use the
ammunition, introduced in August to help reduce fatalities.
   ``Soldiers use it more freely than standard ammunition,'' said
Sarid, of the Citizens Rights Movement.
   Under army orders, soldiers may use plastic bullets only if their
lives are in danger or to disable organizers of violent protests,
said Defense Ministry spokesman Eitan Haber.
   Haber denied Sarid's charges. ``The bullets are used according to
the law. There are a lot of limitations,'' Haber said.
   Streets were deserted and stores shuttered in the occupied lands
as residents complied with a general strike called by the Moslem
fundamentalist group Hamas, a rival of pro-PLO Unified National
Leadership of the Uprising. Hamas called the strike to express
solidarity with detainees and deportees.
   The compliance marked a victory for Hamas, which has repeatedly
challenged the pro-PLO uprising leaders.

<TEXT>
   A runaway train barreled through the
Bavarian countryside for 12{ miles on Saturday after the engineer
left it unattended to go to the bathroom, officials said. No one was
hurt.
   The commuter train was finally intentionally derailed when it was
switched to a buffer stop, police said.
   The train traveled from Ebersberg to Wasserburg in upper Bavaria,
roaring through 20 regular passenger stops during its 20-minute run,
police said. The train averaged more than 37 mph, they said.
   The train was at the end of its usual commuter run and no
passengers were left on board, police said.
   Bavarian state railroad authorities said they were investigating
the incident and questioning the engineer who left the train running
without setting the brake while he went to the men's room at the
Ebersberg train station.
   Police said the engineer reported that he forgot to set the brake
and saw the train leaving the station when he returned to the
platform.
   Warning lights were automatically activated at all 20 crossings
the train sped through during its run across the hilly countryside
southeast of Munich, police said.
   Authorities estimated damage caused by the incident $562,000,
although it was not known if the train or the trian stations were
damaged.

   A blaze swept through two barges in
dry dock in the port of Chittagong on Saturday, killing at least 33
people, fire officials said.
   The fire began during welding operations on the barge and spread
to another barge, the officials said on condition of anonymity. They
said both vessels sank.
   One official said an explosion preceded the fire.
   The dead included at least 15 dock workers, the officials said.
Chittagong is the largest port in Bangladesh.

   Staff members of The Miami News bid ``Farewell,
Miami'' with their final banner headline and a newsroom champagne
toast Saturday morning as Miami's oldest daily _ older than the city
itself _ shut down.
   ``It's over,'' said Howard Kleinberg, the News' editor and an
employee for 38 years. ``I think we gave it a good effort.''
   ``This isn't just another newspaper dying. It has a rich and
proud history,'' publisher David Kraslow said. ``Our influence far
exceeded our circulation.''
   Along with sadness, there was relief from the uncertainty of
last-minute efforts to sell the newspaper or get a court injunction
to block its closing.
   ``It's been real stressful,'' said Bonnie Anderson, a News
columnist. ``This is a very dignified 92-year-old woman, and she
deserves to die with some honor, not to keep her on life-support
systems.''
   The circulation of the crusading newspaper, winner of five
Pulitzer Prizes, had declined 57 percent in a little more than two
decades to about 48,000. The owner, Cox Enterprises Inc. of Atlanta,
said it was unable to sell the News and was losing about $28,500 a
day.
   The Justice Department has said its antitrust division will look
at the closing and whether Cox made a serious effort to sell the
newspaper. But a federal judge Friday denied a private coalition's
effort to get an injunction against the closing.
   The only apparent way to give the News a reprieve would be a
Justice Department injunction. The department hadn't sought such an
injunction, but the newspaper, in a story on its own situation,
quoted Justice spokesman Mark Sheehan as saying, ``Anything we can
do today, we can do tomorrow.''
   Cox announced in October that the newspaper would be closed Dec.
31 if it was not sold. Under a recent amendment to a 1966 joint
operating agreement with The Miami Herald, Cox would have become
responsible in 1990 for the News' operating losses.
   But Cox will continue to share in profits of the Herald, a
Knight-Ridder newspaper with circulation of more than 400,000,
through 2021 even with the News closed. Cox will earn an estimated
$300 million through the agreement, the News reported Saturday.
   The news staff, which numbered about 105 in recent weeks, is the
main staff affected by the shutdown, since the business operation is
shared with the Herald's under the joint agreement. More than half
of those people already have other jobs, officials said.
   A Cox official Friday defended its efforts to sell the paper.
   ``We sent out prospecti to 50 people,'' said David Easterly, who
heads Cox's newspaper division. ``We made presentations to 34.''
   But Chicago newspaper consultant John R. Malone, representing a
group of potential buyers, and an earlier would-be buyer, Michigan
attorney Gary Frink, both criticized Cox for not trying harder.
   ``Cox has made sure there's no way anybody can save that paper,''
Frink said, calling its efforts to sell the publication a ``sham.''
   A federal lawsuit to keep the paper open failed Friday when U.S.
Distirct Judge Stanley Marcus rejected arguments from community
newspapers who claim closing the News would give the Herald a
monopoly. The plaintiffs included readers and distributors of the
News.
   Since the 1966 joint operating agreement, the News' circulation
dropped from 112,000 to 48,000. Under the agreement, the Herald
provided printing, circulation, advertising and promotion services
for the money-losing News, which gave up its Sunday edition.
   The Herald's circulation has grown from about 250,000 to more
than 400,000 since then.
   Kleinberg said while many News veterans blame the operating
agreement for ``strangling us for 22 years, it kept us alive for 22
years.''
   The News was born May 15, 1896, two months before the city was
incorporated, as The Miami Metropolis. It lost some readers in the
1960s with its early, vigorous criticism of the Vietnam War.
   Even with its employees job-hunting, the News broke several
stories in its final days and was in the lead in reporting the
Justice Department investigation and criticism of its own parent
company.
   ``It was a damn good newspaper,'' said columnist Mort Lucoff,
cleaning out his desk at age 59 after 25 years. He was hospitalized
twice for chest pains blamed on the stress of the last two months.
``It's pretty wrenching. I put a quarter-century of life into this
newspaper.''

   The FBI questioned the father of a
Lebanese-born man killed in the crash of a Pan Am airliner over
Scotland about reports his son unwittingly carried a bomb that
destroyed it, the father said.
   Newspapers in Washington and London have quoted unidentified
sources as saying Khalid Jaafar, 21, of suburban Detroit may have
carried the bomb in his luggage without knowing it.
   His father, Nazir Jaafar, who filed a $50 million suit against
Pan Am on Thursday, said two FBI agents questioned him Friday about
reports that members of his family believed someone may have placed
the bomb in his son's luggage.
   Jaafar said Friday he told the FBI agents he had no idea where
the report came from and that the agents told him they had no leads,
either.
   ``They haven't found anybody who made that statement,'' he said.
``They also said they have no evidence against my son. They didn't
have any indication he was involved.''
   He said his son did not check any luggage at the airport and
carried only two bags, both onto the plane with him. ``There were no
packages, no briefcases,'' Jaafar said.
   He said he knows this because he telephoned a friend of his son's
in Frankfurt immediately after hearing about the son's death and was
told by the friend that no one gave Jaafar any packages to take with
him.
   ``Nobody sent anything with him,'' Jaafar said. ``I know (the
friend) and his family. They are nice people.''
   Jaafar said his son was also smart enough to avoid being used by
terrorists. ``He was very careful, very careful,'' Jaafar said.
   The FBI's Detroit office declined to comment on the reports about
the younger Jaafar, as did a spokesman on duty Saturday at FBI
headquarters in Washington.
   The Boeing 747, bound from London to New York, exploded and
crashed in Lockerbie, Scotland, Dec. 21. All 259 people aboard
Flight 103 were killed and 11 others on the ground are presumed dead.
   On Thursday, Nazir filed a $50 million lawsuit in U.S. District
Court in Detroit, accusing Pan Am of ``carelessness and negligence''
in the crash.
   The suit, which seeks $15 million in actual damages and $35
million in punitive damages, contends the airline knew of a threat
to blow up a plane but withheld news of the danger from the public.
   On Thursday, Nazir said the report that his son may have had a
role in the crash ``shocks me more than my son's death. It's false,
fabricated. Nobody from the family would say such a stupid thing.''
   Thursday's editions of The Washington Times quoted an
unidentified relative of Khalid Jaafar as saying the young man had
been living in Frankfurt, West Germany, with several other Lebanese
expatriates who may have alerted terrorists about his planned trip
home to Detroit on Flight 103.
   Several British papers, including The Daily Telegraph, The Times
of London and the Daily Express, reported Saturday that the FBI was
investigating whether the young man may have been the unwitting
carrier of the bomb.
   American news agencies received a call Friday repeating a claim
that the Guardians of the Islamic Revolution terrorist group bombed
the plane.

   The English language would be
considerably improved if the terms ``catastrophic health
insurance,'' ``forced relaxation,'' and ``spin doctor'' were
banished.
   That's according to a list put out Saturday by Lake Superior
State University, which gathers expressions annually for its
Dishonour List of Words Banished from the English Language.
   Language watchers submit terms they consider misused, overused
and generally useless, the university's statement Saturday.
   George Bush's ``read my lips'' quote prompted Michael Locke of
Mount Clemens to write, ``If it had been banned last year, we would
not have had to listen to this throughout the 1988 campaign. In the
interest of forging a kinder and gentler nation, I am withdrawing my
1987 suggestion that the lips of all political candidates be
fattened up for easier reading.''
   Others objected to expressions they thought should be shortened.
   ```Soft-wheel infrastructure system' is bureaucratic lingo gone
mad,'' said Chris Thompson of Duluth, Minn. ``Why not call them what
they are: highways?''
   Though Australia may be growing in popularity among tourists, one
Canadian contributor to the list saw fit to issue an ``Aussie
Alert.''
   Terms such as ``mate,'' ``spark up the barbie,'' and ``too
right'' are ``creeping like crocodiles into North American
English,'' said Susie O'Donnell of Willowdale, Ontario.
   Keith Krahnke of Paradise decided to battle the media industry
singlehandedly by pointing out terms he thinks should be eliminated.
   Krahnke thinks the word ``infotainment,'' an
information-entertainment program, sounds like a government policy
to stem the spread of communism by flooding Third World countries
with free copies of Readers' Digest.
   ``Dramedy,'' a hybrid of a comedy and drama, sounds like a camel
with the shingles, he added.
   M. DeChant of Newberry thought ``spin doctor'' more appropriately
describes a terrific slam dancer with a medical degree or a nifty
move to the hoop by Julius Erving than a person who determines the
slant of news coverage.
   Kari Zipf, of Walla Walla, Wash., who submitted the term
``catastrophic health insurance,'' said, ``I sure don't want
insurance to make certain that I acquire catastrophic health. I have
enough problems as it is.''

   A rancher who allegedly threatened
an ecologist fighting to save the Amazon forest is a prime suspect
in the environmentalist's slaying, a police investigator said
Saturday.
   Francisco Mendes, 44, was killed Dec. 22 outside his home in
Xapuri, a jungle town located 2,600 miles northwest of Rio.
   Darly Alves da Silva, a Xapuri cattle rancher, reportedly made
threats against Mendes, who was seeking to halt indiscriminate
development of the vast Amazon.
   Three of the cattleman's sons are in jail and one of them has
confessed to the slaying, but authorities said Saturday they believe
the father is the main suspect.
   ``Without a doubt, all of our investigations up until now show
that the man not caught is the man who shot Mendes _ Darly Alves da
Silva,'' said Nilson Alves de Oliveira, a special federal
investigator.
   He said authorities were searching the jungle for ``at least one
more main suspect.''
   Mendes was leader of a local union of rubber tappers that fought
against clearing the Amazon for cattle grazing.

   Geraldo and Oprah may heat up their TV talk
shows with controversial guests, but many cable channels are aflame
these days as white supremacists use public-access channels for
their own programs.
   Dubbed ``hate TV'' by some, shows such as ``Race and Reason''
with host Tom Metzger, a former grand dragon of the Ku Klux Klan,
are popping up on public- access cable channels nationwide.
   The programs, usually featuring guests with the same views as
their outspoken hosts, are triggering debates on free speech and
race relations, according to a recent study by the Baltimore-based
National Institute Against Prejudice and Violence.
   ``Race and Reason'' is seen in 55 cities, said Metzger, a
Southern California TV repairman and a leader of the White American
Political Association.
   Other groups, such as the KKK, are also trying to move from the
soapbox to the tube, using cable access channels set aside to be
theoretically open to anyone and causing chagrin among local cable
operators and government officials.
   In Kansas City, Mo., the city council shut down its public-access
channel rather than show ``Klansas City,'' a local KKK program that
was proposed after ``Race and Reason'' was rejected.
   In response, the American Civil Liberties Union will represent
the Klan in a lawsuit challenging termination of the channel, said
the ACLU's Dick Kurtenbach.
   In Florida, the Klan unsuccessfully sued a local cable system for
$2,500 after company officials refused to show the KKK-produced
``Florida Klan News,'' said Tony Pupo of Storer Cable Communications
near Orlando.
   The show opened with pictures of a burning cross.
   ``Derogatory terms like nigger, honky, spook and cracker may be
used,'' Tony Bastanzio, grand wizard of the Knights of the Ku Klux
Klan, said of the show. ``But we won't allow any profanity.''
   ``It's not a debate. They are advocacy programs. There is no
controversy at all,'' said J. Allen Moran, grand dragon of the
Missouri White Knights of the Ku Klux Klan, who has seen 53 ``Race
and Reason'' tapes.
   Metzger, who began ``Race and Reason'' in 1984, calls it ``a
small island of free speech in a sea of controlled and managed
news.''
   Moran said the Missouri KKK is turning to cable ``because the day
of the street walk is over. If we're on the street and are attacked,
it seems that the news media like to take pictures of us defending
ourselves under the headline `Klan Violence.'''
   ``With electronic media, those who oppose us cannot physically
attack us,'' Moran said in a telephone interview. ``Cable allows us
the unique opportunity to present our side of the story.''
   Lorraine Meyer of the American Jewish Committee in Cincinnati
said such groups ``don't need a lot of members to get their message
across. The use and abuse of technology to spread extremist hate
rhetoric has a disturbing potential.''
   Human rights and cable access groups coalesced in Cincinnati
after the White American Skin Heads cablecast a video ``bulletin
board'' message, ``Join the American Nazis and smash Red, Jew and
Black power,'' the National Institute Against Prejudice and Violence
reported.
   Moran terms his views ``racialist,'' not racist.
   ``We chose the term `racialist' because the word `racist' in the
dictionary is one who hates,'' Moran said. ``A racialist loves. We
love our race. We are proud of our heritage.''
   He advocates ``a separate country'' for whites, adding ``the
Pacific Northwest is what we have our eyes on.''
   The Northwest Knights of the Ku Klux Klan have a cable program in
Spokane, Wash. ``Race and Reason'' and ``Ernest Zundel on National
Socialism'' are shown on the public-access channel.
   In Pocatello, Idaho, counterprograms were used, said Randy Ammon,
access coordinator for Pocatello Cablevision 12.
   ``The very first installment of `Race and Reason' was followed by
a film of Bill Cosby on stage in an antiprejudice film that was
followed by a live call-in discussion,'' said Ammon. ``The community
spoke out against the racism advocated in `Race and Reason' and for
the First Amendment.''
   Likewise in Sacramento. Randy Van Dalsen of the Sacramento Cable
Foundation said the controversy ``served as a sparkplug, as an
instigator, for other programming.''
   ``Sacramento and Pocatello each utilized the access channel to
invite everyone in the community to answer the hatred of the Klan,''
said Michael Meyerson, a University of Baltimore communication law
professor. ``When you censor them (Klan members), you make their
argument correct.''

a Navy spokesman said Saturday.
   The spokesman, Cmdr. Mel Sundin, said the ship movement involving
the nuclear-powered aircraft carrier Theodore Roosevelt was a
``previously scheduled, routine deployment to the U.S. Sixth Fleet.''
   Sundin said it marks the first operational Mediterranean
deployment since the Roosevelt, the Navy's newest nuclear-powered
carrier, was commissioned in October 1986.
   The carrier battle group is commanded by Rear Adm. David B.
Robinson, commander of the Norfolk-based Cruiser-Destroyer Group 8.
The ships left Norfolk on Friday, Sundin said.

   President Reagan and Soviet President
Mikhail Gorbachev said in an exchange of New Year's messages
Saturday that problems remain in the relations between their
countries but great progress is being made.
   ``Despite our disagreements, we have been able to find some
common ground,'' Reagan said in a speech to be broadcast with a
voice-over translation on Soviet television.
   ``Americans seem to be rediscovering the Soviet Union _ and we
are rediscovering America,'' Gorbachev said in a message made
available to U.S. television networks on the same basis.
   An English-language text of Gorbachev's message, along with the
text of Reagan's, was distributed by the White House as Reagan
vacationed at the estate of publisher Walter Annenberg near this
desert esort.
   It was the third exchange of televised New Year's greetings by
the two leaders. They started the custom in 1986, skipped it in
1987, and renewed it last year as relations between their two
countries again improved.
   Reagan's message was taped on Dec. 15 in the White House Map
Room, which was used as a staff room where key agreements were
reached during the Reagan-Gorbachev summit in Washington in December
1987.
   ``I am confident that relations between our two countries will
continue on the positive course they have followed in the year just
ending,'' the president said.
   Reagan said he and Gorbachev had ``advanced our mutual
understanding on the vital issues of human rights, arms reductions,
regional problems, and bilateral relations.''
   ``In all of these areas, these improvements represent only the
beginning of a long, difficult road to better understanding and
cooperation,'' he said.
   Reagan added, ``We are ready to continue moving along this road.
Important differences remain between our two counties and will
continue for years to come.''
   Looking forward to the inauguration of President-elect Bush on
Jan. 20, Reagan said, ``The American people have chosen him in part
because he represents continuity in the policies _ foreign and
domestic _ that the United States has pursued over the past eight
years. I know that Mr. Bush will continue on the same course with
equal commitment.''
   Gorbachev, speaking also of U.S.-Soviet relations, said, ``We
have become closer, and we have come to know each other better.''
   ``Fears and suspicion are gradually giving way to trust and
feelings of mutual liking,'' the Soviet leader said.
   ``We in the Soviet Union are in favor of the most wide-ranging
ties between our peoples,'' he said.
   Gorbachev said the treaty on reduction of short- and medium-range
nuclear missiles that went into effect in 1988 was ``a great turning
point in world affairs.''
   In addition, he said, ``The Afghan issue is close to a
settlement. Hostilities have ceased between Iran and Iraq. Real
opportunities are emerging for resolving painful and complex issues
in Southeast Asia and Southern Africa.''
   ``But the Soviet Union and the United States also have some
common problems,'' he said. ``I am convinced that today, on the
basis of growing mutual understanding and trust, we can solve them
better than we could yesterday.''
   Gorbachev made no reference to Central America, where the Reagan
administration has accused the Soviets of fostering communist
rebellions.
   Reagan, on the other hand, told the Soviets, ``Perhaps your
country will join ours in the effort to bring peace, democracy and
security to Central America.''

<HEAD>Khomeini Strips Top Council Of Some Powers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ANWAR FARUQI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini on Saturday
stripped some powers from a high-ranking council established in
February to speed up Iran's decision-making process, Tehran Radio
reported.
   Following criticism from parliamentary deputies and other
radicals that formation of the 13-member Expediency Council was
unconstitutional, Khomeini declared that it will no longer be
allowed to legislate independently of Parliament.
   The official radio, monitored in Nicosia, said Khomeini urged a
return to constitutional law now that the need for a speedy
decision-making process has decreased since the Aug. 20 cease-fire
in the war with Iraq.
   The Mujahedeen Khalq, or People's Holy Warriors, the main Iranian
opposition movement, said in a statement that Khomeini's move
underlined that ``the ruling clique's internal conflicts are
intensifying.''
   Khomeini set up the Expediency Council 10 months ago, while the
war was still raging, to resolve differences between the
radical-dominated Parliament and the 12-member Council of Guardians,
which is dominated by conservative clerics and screens legislation
to determine if it conforms to Islamic law.
   The Expediency Council, a mix of reformists and conservatives,
included senior political figures such as President Ali Khamenei,
Parliament Speaker Hashemi Rafsanjani and Prime Minister Hussein
Musavi as well as six members of the Council of Guardians.
   The Council of Guardians had repeatedly blocked sweeping reforms
that would give the government tight control of the economy and
redistribute land, much of it held by the clergy.
   Soon after it was formed, the Expediency Council began
independently ratifying a number of laws on its own, including one
ordering the death sentence for drug traffickers.
   It takes effect Jan.21.
   The radio said Khomeini decreed that bills already passed by the
Expediency Council will remain in force.
   ``Beyond that, action must only be taken in cases where there are
differences between the Majlis (Parliament) and the Council of
Guardians,'' Khomeini said.
   He called on the Council of Guardians, composed of six clerics
and six legal experts, to ``be more broad-minded in vetting Majlis
legislation so that it would not require further consideration by
the Expediency Council.''
   ``While the Guardians must prevent any un-Islamic bills from
becoming law, they should make full efforts to ensure that in the
economic, military, social and political realms, Islam is not
discredited and accused of being unable to manage the world,'' he
said.

<TEXT>
   Here is a White House text of Soviet
President Mikhail Gorbachev's New Year's message to the people of
the United States:
   On this first day of the new year, I am pleased to have the
opportunity to convey, on behalf of the Soviet people and on my own
behalf, our best wishes to the American people, and to every
American family.
   Seeing out a year gone by and ushering in a new year is always a
moving experience. Each time we take stock of the past year _ happy
about some things, sad about others, and hoping that many of our
concerns will be left behind as we cross the threshhold of the year
and that our wishes will be fulfilled in the coming year.
   Last year was rich in momentous events. It also brought many good
changes in relations between our people and countries. Today they
are more dynamic and more humane. We have become closer, and we have
come to know each other better.
   Americans seem to be rediscovering the Soviet Union _ and we are
rediscovering America. Fears and suspicion are gradually giving way
to trust and feelings of mutual liking.
   I could see all of this for myself in my meetings with Americans
in Washington and quite recently in New York. We regard the warmth
and goodwill shown to the Soviet delegation during those days as
something very important for our relations.
   I think President Reagan, too, will remember his meetings with
Soviet people during his visit to the Soviet Union.
   We in the Soviet Union are in favor of the most wide-ranging ties
between our peoples. I hope you are, too. And that means we can look
ahead with optimism to the future of our relations. This is what we
talked about with President-elect Bush.
   1988 is memorable for all of us as a year when we began reducing
the most terrifying weapons _ nuclear weaons. That alone is enough
for it to go down in history as a landmark, a great turning point in
world affairs.
   Many other facts, too, prove that changes for the better, very
important for all of us, are taking place in the world. The Afghan
issue is close to a settlement. Hostilities have ceased between Iran
and Iraq. Real opportunities are emerging for resolving painful and
complex issues in South East Asia and Southern Africa. The situation
in the Middle East is also changing. All this is very encouraging.
   And let me mention one thing in prticular.
   You know how much misfortune and suffering was caused by the
earthquake in Armenia, how great was the human tragedy it wrought.
   I went to see the ruins of the devastated Armenian towns. You
can't even look at what the forces of nature have done without
shuddering.
   All Soviet people took the misfortune of the people of Armenia as
their own. In this hour of grief they extended a helping hand to
them, as brothers. The devastated towns and villages will be reborn
_ that is the will of all the peoples of the Soviet Union.
   Armenia's tragedy has evoked great sympathy throughout the world.
We are grateful to the American people and to all peoples who have
come to our aid.
   Seeing all this, one cannot help thinking that all people who
live on this Earth, all of us _ however different _ are really one
family.
   I am sure we will find enough wisdom and goodwill to establish
together a true period of peace for all humankind.
   If we are capable of a new way of feeling then we must surely be
capable of a new way of thinking.
   If we are capable of a new way of thinking then, instead of
merely surviving, we can live in a new way _ on the basis of equal
rights, justice, trust, humanism and wide-ranging cooperation.
   This is the message I wanted to convey in addressing the United
Nations in New York.
   There are, of course, still many problems in the world, and they
are intricate and complex. But that only heightens the need to solve
them together _ as we say in our country, with everyone pitching in.
It is good that we understand this and, moreover, that we are taking
the first steps in that direction.
   Both our countries have a lot of problems. Quite naturally, you
know your problems better, and we know ours. We intend to solve our
problems in the course of perestroika.
   But the Soviet Union and the United States also have some common
problems. I am convinced that today, on the basis of growing mutual
understanding and trust, we can solve them better than we could
yesterday.
   Once again I salute you, citizens of a great nation, once again I
wish all of you peace, good health and well being.
   May there be more happiness and joy in your life, may your best
hopes be fulfilled.
   May our common achievements shine brighter and brighter, filling
every Soviet and American home and all our planet with an abiding
will for peace, development and construction.
   A happy New Year.

   A treasured item among Cuba's dissident community
these days is a recent speech by a leading figure not normally
identified with counterrevolutionary thoughts: Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   Elizardo Sanchez, president of a small, independent human rights
group here, proudly displayed to a reporter several copies of the
speech the Soviet president gave last month to the U.N. General
Assembly.
   Sanchez said the Cuban press gave perfunctory treatment to the
speech, highlighting only passages that coincided with the official
view. Eager for a complete account, Sanchez obtained copies of the
speech from the Soviet Embassy.
   Although his opinion can't be corroborated, Sanchez said he
believes the government here felt uneasy about calling attention to
a speech that once again underscored Soviet-Cuba differences during
the Gorbachev era.
   While playing down the Gorbachev speech, Cuba's
government-controlled television provided full coverage of remarks
last month by Pik Botha, South Africa's foreign minister and
normally the leading villain in Cuba's pantheon of enemies. Botha
spoke on the recent agreement calling for the withdrawal of Cuban
forces from Angola.
   Gorbachev's speech was notably non-ideological in tone,
contrasting sharply with President Fidel Castro's emphasis on
revolutionary purity. Marxist sloganeering was almost totally absent
from the speech.
   Sanchez, expressing a view shared by Western diplomats here, said
Castro is disquieted by Gorbachev's policy of open discussion
because pressures for official candor could emerge in Cuba as well.
   In his speech, Gorbachev said that given current international
realities, ``it is highly unlikely that closed societies can be
preserved.''
   The comment could be taken as a slap at Cuba, with which the
Soviets have been closely aligned for two decades.
   Gorbachev also endorsed the principles of the U.N. Human Rights
Declaration, a document not held in high esteem by Cuban authorities
because of its stress on civil liberties.
   Cuba has always maintained that few countries do a better job of
fulfilling aspects of the declaration dealing with economic rights,
including the right to employment.
   No Latin American country employs a higher percentage of its work
force than Cuba, Castro maintains, insisting that any system that
has produced as much social progress as Cuba has in the past 30
years should not be tampered with.
   But Sanchez, who works out of a small, cramped office at his
Havana home, accused the government of violating at least 25
provisions of the U.N. Declaration.
   Dec. 10 was the 40th anniversary of the Human Rights Declaration,
and this weekend is the 30th birthday of the triumph of Castro's
revolution.
   It was on New Year's Day 1959 that Castro ousted a rightist
dictatorship in a revolution remarkable for both its durability and
the magnitude of the changes it wrought.
   Castro is expected to mark the anniversary with an appearance
Sunday night in the east coast city of Santiago.
   Until recently, independent human rights groups in Cuba have been
virtually unknown. Now there are several, all of which Sanchez
claims are closely monitored by the government.
   Sanchez, whose group is known as the Cuban Commission of Human
Rights and National Reconciliation, said international pressure has
induced the government to pay more heed to human rights issues.
   As an example, he said there are no known cases of Cuban
political prisoners having been executed for at least two years.
According to Western diplomats, more than 200 Cuban political
prisoners have been released over the past year.
   ``International public opinion is probably what most protects
us,'' Sanchez said.

<HEAD>Gunman Who Took Hostages in Beauty Salon Had Firebomb</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A gunman who took eight hostages in a beauty
salon, releasing all but one before he was killed by a police
sniper, had a bomb that ``could have put the whole building in
flames,'' police said Saturday.
   Michael Fane, 21, of Iowa City, Iowa, was shot and killed by a
SWAT team sniper Friday afternoon as the last hostage, Darla
Lordemann, was bending over to pick up a package police left in the
salon doorway.
   The explosive that Fane warned police he had in a suitcase during
the 24-hour siege turned out to be a firebomb, authorities said
after the device was dismantled.
   ``That bomb could have put the whole building in flames,'' police
spokesman Joe Crinklaw said Saturday.
   Fane did not get a chance to detonate the bomb, which was
controlled by a switch and a walkie-talkie, Crinklaw said. The
hostages were unharmed, police said.
   Debbie McQueen, a beautician who was one of the hostages, said
she was cutting a friend's hair when Fane entered the salon Thursday
afternoon.
   ``He yelled, `I'm taking over!' Then I saw he was swinging a gun
and we all hit the floor,'' she said.
   Fane then told four of the hostages, including a 5-year-old boy,
to leave.
   Mrs. McQueen, who was held until 8 a.m. Friday, said Fane pulled
a small suitcase from the bag and ordered Mrs. Lordemann and Denise
Rue, 26, to attach their wrists to the suitcase handle and lie on
the floor.
   Police would not disclose what Fane's demands were, but Mrs.
McQueen said he told hostages he was building a machine for God.
   ``He said God sent him there, God showed him the way,'' Mrs.
McQueen said. ``He said `There was no message. I just have to build
a machine. It's something God wants done and I will do it.'''
   Police said their negotiations with Fane deteriorated around 6
a.m. Friday when they discovered he could have a bomb or the makings
of a bomb.
   Police said they also believed Fane had a 9mm pistol, but later
discovered he had a 9mm look-alike pellet gun. Police said Fane
probably could not have killed anyone with it.
   Fane, who had been under psychiatric care, began to have severe
mood swings after Ms. Rue was released in exchange for a pack of
cigarettes about 3 a.m. Friday, according to Mrs. McQueen.
   When negotiators told Fane they would have to cut the phone, heat
and gas lines if he didn't release more hostages, Fane became angry,
Mrs. McQueen said.
   She said he warned negotiators if they killed him, ``we're all
going to go up.''
   At about 8 a.m. Friday, negotiators apparently said they would
meet his demands, including Plexiglas, a saw, duct tape and arc
welder and insulation, if he would release two hostages.
   Fane agreed and the three women decided who would be freed by
drawing different colored ``perm rods'' used to wave hair, as if
they were drawing straws.
   Mrs. Lordemann pulled the rod with the lightest color and
remained as the lone hostage as Sherri Kuhlmann and Mrs. McQueen
escaped, Mrs. McQueen said.
   London would not say what the package sent in to the gunman had
in it, but said it contained one of his demands.
   Fane's family said they blamed drugs for the actions of their
son, who had dropped out of the University of Iowa. His father, Dr.
Larry Fane of El Compo, Texas, said that his son recently received
psychiatric treatment.
   His mother, Kathy Fane, said she was in Nebraska in early
November to ask the Sarpy County Mental Health Board to commit her
son for psychiatric treatment, but the board declined to act.

<HEAD>Milkman Calls It Quits After 64 Years</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SPRINGFIELD, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   For Randy Stremsterfer, the milk run is
over.
   The 72-year-old Springfield dairyman, who remembers horse-drawn
wagons and milk prices of 7 cents a quart, went on his last milk run
Wednesday.
   ``A lot of people look forward to retirement,'' Stremsterfer
said. ``I don't. But age is creeping up on me. I guess 64 years is
long enough in the milk business.''
   Stremsterfer's father, Charles, was a dairy farmer who started
distributing his milk locally in 1909. By the time Stremsterfer was
8, he was working at the family dairy. When he was in high school,
he would get up at 3 a.m., deliver his milk, then begin classes at
7:45.
   ``During my dating days,'' said Stremsterfer, ``I used to get up
at 1:30 in the morning and start delivering at 2 o'clock. ...
Sometimes I'd just take my date home and go back out on the milk
route. I was tired all the time.''
   Stremsterfer Dairy wagons were pulled then by two horses named
Kate and Molly. Each horse knew the route so well that when there
was a change the driver had a tough time keeping the horse from
going the way she was used to.
   ``We had those horses trained,'' Stremsterfer said. ``My brother
took one side of the street, I took the other. Then we'd whistle for
the horses and they'd come to the end of the block.''
   In 1933, horsepower of a different kind replaced the Kates and
Mollys of earlier years. A new truck came to Stremsterfer Dairy. The
dairy had grown, more customers were added, and the job was getting
too big for the horses.
   ``I wore three of them out,'' Stremsterfer said.
   Being on the streets regularly in the middle of the night, a
milkman sees all sorts of things. After the dairy got its truck,
Stremsterfer frequently gave people rides as he made his rounds.
   ``A lot of times, you'd meet couples out late, walking along. I'd
take them home. It used to be a saying about being out late, `We
rode home with the milkman.' That was true.''
   As the dairy grew, Stremsterfer gradually took over for his
father. At its biggest, Stremsterfer Dairy had three drivers and put
out 75 cases of milk a day. It also bottled milk for two smaller
dairies in the area.
   The customer who goes back the farthest with Stremsterfer is H.B.
Hollis, who has been in the insurance business as long as
Stremsterfer has delivered milk.
   ``I started to take milk from him before I was married, and I was
married in 1937,'' Hollis said. ``I don't think we got over six
gallons of sour milk in 50 years. ... We always left the house
unlocked and he'd come in and put the milk and things in the
refrigerator for us.''
   But after so many years, the Hollises will have a new milkman.
   ``They said they'd probably get some young guy now,''
Stremsterfer said. ``I said he may be younger than me, but he won't
be as good-looking.''

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President-elect Bush, on a private holiday
weekend with his wife in the Maryland countryside, spent most of
Saturday on the telephone with the people he has tapped to lead his
new administration, his spokeswoman said.
   Bush press secretary Sheila Tate said she spoke to him by
telephone about his weekend activities. But she declined to disclose
what he had to say about the subpoenas he and President Reagan
received Friday calling them to testify for the defense in the
Iran-Contra trial of Oliver North.
   ``He told me to stick to the guidance I had,'' which was a brief
statement issued Friday, Tate said. The statement said lawyers were
examining the legal and constitutional issues involved in the
subpoenas and indicated it was premature to say whether the White
House would contest the subpoenas.
   Bush is spending a three-day holiday at the presidential retreat
of Camp David.
   ``He has called every member of his new Cabinet to wish them a
happy new year,'' said Tate. She said Bush had also placed a call to
President Reagan who is spending his traditional New Year's eve with
friends at the Rancho Mirage, Calif., estate of his longtime friend,
publisher Walter Annenberg.
   Bush, who left unanswered when he left Washington Friday the
question of who he wants to fill two final Cabinet-level jobs, also
was going running Saturday, she said.
   His son Marvin, with his wife and child, were to join their
parents on Sunday at Camp David. The Bushes planned to attend church
services performed by a Navy chaplain on the Camp David grounds and
then watch the bowl football games on television, said Tate.
   Bush aides have said there would be no new Cabinet announcements
from Bush before he returns to Washington on Tuesday.
   He has yet to select a secretary of energy or a person to fill
the new Cabinet-level job of drug czar.
   As Bush left town on Friday, speculation centered on former
Carter administration Energy Secretary James Schlesinger and former
Rep. Henson Moore, R-La., as top contenders for the energy post.
   Meanwhile, Bush spokesman David Prosperi said the president-elect
has picked Air Force Col. Antonio Lopez of Covington, Tenn., to
oversee military ceremonies for the White House, honor guards, and
communications for presidential trips.
   Lopez, 54, was deputy director of research for the Bush campaign.
A Vietnam war pilot decorated with the Distinguished Flying Cross
and 12 other medals, he was tapped by Bush's transition office as an
adviser on veterans affairs.

   Toys, jam, clothes and other gifts poured into
Armenia for survivors of the earthquake that killed an estimated
25,000, but the New Year's glee that swept the rest of the Soviet
Union was largely missing, Tass reported Saturday.
   ``Never before have Armenian children received so many New Year
gifts from Father Frost and Santa Claus from all over the world. And
never before was this favorite children's holiday so sad,'' the
official Soviet news agency reported in a dispatch from the Armenian
capital Yerevan.
   Tass said its reporter asked one boy whose mother was killed in
the quake in the city of Spitak what he wanted from Father Frost,
the plump bearded man who brings gifts during New Year's.
   ``Let him return my mother,'' replied Armen Kazaryan, 8, who was
hospitalized for a concussion.
   An undetermined number of children were orphaned by the Dec. 7
quake that ravaged northwestern Armenia. A 40-day period of mourning
was declared, so the traditional New Year's spirit is missing, Tass
reported.
   ``Thousands of people come these days to Yerevan hospitals and
clinics bringing for the quake survivors toys, jams, fruit, sweets
and clothes,'' the news agency said.
   An International Red Cross official reported from Yerevan to his
home office in Geneva that volunteers made sure all 4,500
hospitalized earthquake victims received traditional New Year's
gifts.
   A party comprising Armenian, British, Russian, Finnish and
Hungarian Red Cross workers left in a fleet of Austrian, West
German, and Soviet vehicles to help in the distribution, according
to George Reid of the League of National Red Cross and Red Crescent
Societies.
   Dolls and teddy bears were among the gifts distributed to the
children at Yerevan's traumatological hospital, Reid reported, while
adult patients got gifts from Christmas hampers shipped in by the
British Red Cross.
   A journalist with the official Armenian news agency Armenpress
said authorities called off a dusk-to-dawn curfew in Yerevan for New
Year's Eve. The curfew was imposed and tanks and troops were sent in
late November to quell ethnic unrest in the southern republic.

   More than 125 activists demonstrated
Saturday to protest the restart of the Pilgrim nuclear power plant,
which the federal government once called one of the worst-run in the
country.
   Plymouth Police Capt. George Madsen said 27 protesters were
arrested on trespassing charges.
   The plant shut down nearly three years ago.
   On Friday, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission cleared the way for
the low-power testing of the 670-megawatt reactor for up to 5
percent of its capacity and the plant started low-power testing. It
should be at full power in four months.
   The protesters, members of the groups Citizens for Responsible
Energy and Pilgrim Alliance, gathered at Duxbury High School on
Saturday morning and positioned themselves at the entrance to one of
two main gates around noon.
   ``It was a symbolic show of our frustration, of our determination
not to go away,'' said protester Donald Muirhead. ``There's a lot of
anger and frustration here with local and federal government.''
   Families and teen-agers, wearing signs reading ``Where's the
Duke?'' and ``Mr. Edison will be Back,'' sang ``God Bless America''
as the crowd listened to several speakers.
   ``Why are they still making these wasteful products with no place
to dump them?'' asked protester Priscilla Dean Hatton of West
Yarmouth.
   The demonstrators who were arrested were to be relased later
Saturday, police said.
   State officials have called Pilgrim's plan to be at full power
within four months inadequate. The state has vowed to do everything
possible to keep the plant from operating.
   Pilgrim had been shut since April 1986, at which time the NRC
called the reactor ``one of the worst-run'' nuclear plants in the
country.
   State officials, including Gov. Michael S. Dukakis and Attorney
General James Shannon, have maintained evacuation plans for those
living near the plant are inadequate despite utility revisions, and
have said the plant should not reopen until a new study of leukemia
rates in the population surrounding the plant is complete.
   Boston Edison has spent about $200 million since the shutdown to
replace nearly all of the plant's top management, remedy mechanical
problems and fight skepticism by the NRC and a growing anti-nuclear
movement among nearby residents.
   Last month, Massachusetts voters rejected a referendum question
that would have permanently closed Pilgrim and the Yankee plant in
Rowe by outlawing commercial production of nuclear waste in the
state.
   If the plant's restart schedule is followed, consumers can
receive power from Pilgrim when it hits 10 percent operating
capacity sometime next month.
   By the end of January, the plant should be at about 25 percent of
power, producing 100 megawatts daily, or enough electricity to power
160,000 homes, said Boston Edison spokeswoman Elaine Robinson.
   The Pilgrim plant must undergo another review by the NRC before
it is granted permission to operate at full power, a process that
could take months.

<HEAD>Maryland Firm Gets FDA Approval for Cervical Cancer Test</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BALTIMORE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Food and Drug Administration has approved a
test that can detect the sexually transmitted virus believed to be
linked to the development of cervical cancer, a Baltimore newspaper
reported Saturday.
   The test, the first of its kind to gain FDA approval, screens for
the presence of the human papilloma virus and is expected to be used
by physicians and medical laboratories along with the Pap smear,
which detects pre-cancerous and cancerous cells on the cervix, The
Sun reported.
   The test has been awaited in the medical field, where surveys
indicate as many as 50 percent of the 40 million Pap smears
conducted each year are either misread or yield incorrect results.
   Sales of ViraPap could bring in as much as $35 million for its
maker, Life Technologies Inc. of Gaithersburg, Md., which makes
diagnostic equipment and other supplies, analysts say.
   Company officials have declined comment on the FDA approval, but
have scheduled a news conference Wednesday in New York City.
   Charles H. Kyper, director of the pre-market approval staff of
the FDA's Office of Device Evaluation, confirmed Friday that final
approval was sent to the company Dec. 23.
   Some physicians estimate as many as 10 percent of American women
may be infected by HPV, which causes venereal warts in both men and
women and has been linked to cancerous cell changes of the genital
tract.
   ``Right now, we can't detect this virus readily and in an easily
accessible fashion,'' said Dr. Gay M. Guzinski, chief of benign
gynecology at the University of Maryland Medical Center. ``If we
could detect this virus early, then we would have a group of
patients that we ought to pay very close attention to.''
   The company expects to sell the tests to physicians and
laboratories for $9 each; patients probably will pay $35 to $40 for
the test.

<HEAD>Text of Reagan New Year's Message to Soviet Union</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PALM SPRINGS, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Here is a White House text of
President Reagan's new year's message to the people of the Soviet
Union:
   On behalf of the American people, I send you greetings on the
coming of the New Year.
   In your country and mine, the New Year is a time of hope and
renewal. Never have these qualities of the spirit been more
necessary than now, as Soviet Armenia begins to heal from its wound.
You have our deepest sympathy. You have our prayers. And you have a
personal hope from my wife, Nancy, and me that in the effort to
rebuild what was shattered, you will find your solace.
   I am confident that relations between our two countries will
continue on the positive course they have followed in the year just
ending. And despite our disagreements, we have been able to find
some common ground. When I visited Moscow and met with President
Gorbachev, we advanced our mutual understanding on the vital issues
of human rights, arms reductions, regional problems, and bilateral
relations.
   Although much remains to be done, we are making progress in all
of those areas. In Moscow, we signed the documents of ratification
for the treaty eliminating an entire class of U.S. and Soviet
intermediate-range nuclear missiles; and the implementation of that
historic treaty has proceeded smoothly.
   Soviet and American negotiators continued to discuss a 50 per
cent reduction in strategic nuclear weapons. And we are preparing to
enter into new negotiations about conventional military forces in
Europe. President Gorbachev, during his recent speech to the United
Nations, announced significant reductions in Soviet conventional
forces; this is certainly a step in the right direction of
correcting the imblanaces in the European military situation, but
much more remains to be done. Thus, while much has been accomplished
in the areas of arms control and reductions, we must continue
efforts to ensure a lasting peace.
   In human rights, progress is being made in re-unification of
families, freedom of people to travel as they please, and in other
areas. The cessation of jamming is also a positive step; for if we
are to understand each other better, we must be able to talk freely
with each other _ and listen freely as well.
   In bilateral relations, for example in cultural and educational
exchange, improvements mean that the barriers that artificially
separated our peoples are slowly being lowered.
   And in regional issues, from Afghanistan to the Persian Gulf and
Southern Africa, solutions are being found to conflicts of many
years' standing. Perhaps your country will join ours in the effort
to bring peace, democracy and security to Central America.
   In all of these areas, these improvements represent only the
beginning of a long, difficult road to better understanding and
cooperation. We are ready to continue moving along this road.
Important differences remain between our countries and will continue
for years to come. But I am confident that we have been witness in
1988 to progress that, if we are careful and diligent, can continue
next year and during the years to come.
   President Gorbachev's visit to New York _ cut short by the
catastrophe in Armenia _ gave us a chance to meet once more during
my term as president. On January 20, George Bush will be sworn in as
my successor. The American people have chosen him in part because he
represents continuity in the policies _ foreign and domestic _ that
the United States has pursued over the past eight years. I know that
Mr. Bush will continue on the same course with equal commitment.
   This is my final message to you as president, and so, let me
close by saying this: I believe the world is safer than it was a
year ago, and I pray it will be safer still a year from now. I wish
you, the Soviet people, well in the New Year. Thank you and may God
bless you and keep you all the days of your life.

<HEAD>Wet New Year's Eve In Southeast, Snow In West</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Parts of the southeastern United States had a wet New Year's Eve,
while a cold front brought snow from Montana to the mountains of
southern Calfornia.
   Heavy rains fell Saturday across parts of Louisiana, Mississippi
and Alabama. Two inches fell in a six-hour period ending at 1 p.m.
in Meridian, Miss., while an inch and two-thirds was recorded at
McComb, Miss.
   In the West, snow advisories were in effect for south-central
Montana, northwestern Wyoming, southeastern Idaho and the southern
Sierra Nevada range of California.
   Light snow also fell across much of North Dakota and Minnesota.
   Skies were sunny from the southwestern deserts to the central
Rockies and the Great Plains. It was also sunny in the Great Lakes
region and along the middle and northern Atlantic Coast.
   Clouds were over much of the rest of the nation, with fog over
the valleys of California and Idaho and from the southeastern states
into the middle Mississippi Valley.
   Dense fog covered some areas, including Soldier Field in Chicago
where the Chicago Bears played the Philadelphia Eagles in a National
Football Conference playoff game. The Bears won 20-12, but most fans
and the public address announcer couldn't see the action after the
second quarter, when the fog rolled in.
   ``This is the best game I've never seen,'' said Tom McKee, a
32-year-old fan who watched from the upper deck.
   In east-central Illinois, dense fog caused a series of accidents
on Interstate 74, killing six people and injuring at least 15
others, police said. Fog also was blamed for accidents involving 19
vehicles on Interstate 95 near Cocoa Beach, Fla. Police said an
unspecified number of motorists were injured, but no deaths were
reported.
   Temperatures were below freezing Saturday afternoon from the
northern Plains to the Upper Great Lakes and across northern New
England.
   Temperatures were in the 60s across south-central Texas, in the
70s over the central Gulf Coast and northern Florida, and in the 80s
in southern Florida.
   Temperatures around the nation at 2 p.m. EST ranged from 1 degree
at Havre, Mont., and International Falls, Minn., to 86 degrees at
Fort Myers, Fla.
   The nation's low Saturday morning was 14 degrees below zero at
Warroad, Minn.
   For New Year's Day, the National Weather Service forecast snow
from the northern high Plains to the Upper Great Lakes and from
Minnesota to Upper Michigan. Snow will also be over the central
Plateau region. Rain will extend from the eastern half of the Gulf
Coast region to the middle Atlantic Coast states, with snow and
freezing rain across parts of the Atlantic Coast.
   Thunderstorms will be over the southeastern states. Rain will
also extend across southern and central California into southwestern
Arizona. Partly sunny skies will prevail across much of the rest of
the nation.
   Temperatures will remain below freezing all day from the northern
Plateau and the Great Basin through the Great Lakes region to New
England, with highs in the teens and single numbers from the
northern high Plains to northern Minnesota and northwest Upper
Michigan. Temperatures will warm into the 50s and 60s from the
southern and central coast of California to southern Arizona and
across the southern Plains to the southern Atlantic Coast. Readings
will be in the 70s and lower 80s from Florida to south-central Texas.

   A mother and her 2-year-old daughter remained in
critical condition Saturday from injuries suffered when a fire
erupted in their apartment, while another daughter was seriously
injured.
   Firefighter Adam Long found 2-year-old Patricia Pettus lying
unconscious on the floor of the second-story apartment covered with
soot and broken glass after the fire broke out Friday morning, he
said.
   ``I ran down the stairs with her and took my mask off so I could
give her mouth-to-mouth'' resuscitation, he said.
   Patricia was in critical condition at Children's Hospital, a
hospital spokeswoman said, while her 4-year-old sister, Nicole, was
listed in serious condition.
   The girls' mother, Mary Ann Bridgett, 21, escaped from the
building and remained in critical condition in Barnes Hospital, a
hospital spokeswoman said.
   All three suffered burns and smoke inhalation, officials said.
   Becky Timpe of Cahokia, Ill., was on her way to work when she
drove by the building before firefighters or ambulances arrived and
saw Nicole standing outside naked in sub-freezing weather.
   ``I just picked her up, and we took her to the hospital,'' Timpe
said. ``I ran every stop light and stop sign.''
   The fire was reported about an hour after the girls' father,
Shane Pettus, 24, had left for work.
   An investigator said the fire started in a couch, possibly as a
result of careless smoking or a child playing with a lighter.
   Two firefighters were treated at a hospital for minor injuries
and released.

<HEAD>U.N. Talks on Namibia Peacekeepers Bog Down</HEAD>

<DATELINE>UNITED NATIONS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Talks aimed at creating a U.N. force to
monitor South-West Africa's transition from South African rule to
independence bogged down Saturday in a dispute over the estimated
$700 million cost.
   The U.N. Security Council's five permanent members, including the
United States and Soviet Union, tried to slash the budget for the
9,500-member force. The permanent members will pay most of the
peacekeeping bill.
   But the Nonaligned Movement, with six members on the 15-nation
council, objected to the move and said the force should remain as
proposed to prevent South Africa from interfering in elections.
   Rebels fighting South African forces in South-West Africa, also
known as Namibia, say the force should be increased and not reduced.
   A week of negotiations to create the peacekeeping force, to be
known as the U.N. Transition Assistance Group, were snarled Saturday
but are to continue Tuesday.
   The force is to be in place before April 1, when a seven-month
transition period leading up to elections begins.
   The five permanent members of the Security Council argue that a
force of 7,500 soldiers, backed by 2,000 civilians and police, is
unnecessary because tension has eased since the signing earlier this
month of regional agreements among Angola, Cuba and South Africa.
   Under those pacts, South Africa will grant independence to
Namibia in 1991 in exchange for withdrawal of about 50,000 Cuba
troops from Angola to be completed the same year.
   The U.N. peacekeeping force will be the biggest since a
19,800-man U.N. contingent was deployed in the Congo from 1960 to
1964.
   The five permanent members include Britain, China and France, all
with veto power over any resolution. The other council members are
Italy, Japan, West Germany, Argentina, and the Nonaligned nations of
Brazil, Algeria, Nepal, Senegal, Yugoslavia, and Zambia.
   U.S. Ambassador Patricia M. Byrne, deputy represenative, said the
five permanent members were ready to adopt a resolution directing
U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar to ``identify
tangible cost-saving measures'' in the force.
   ``But then the Nonaligned Group presented new amendments,'' she
said without elaborating.
   Other diplomats said the amendments countered efforts at
cost-cutting.
   Ms. Byrne said the amendments will be considered Tuesday.
   Hidipo Hamutenya, information secretary of the Southwest African
People's Organization, which has been fighting South African forces
said: ``If there ever was a need for a strong U.N. military presence
... it is now.''
   Jeremy Shearar, the South African U.N. ambassador, said
cost-cutting was very important ``because anything we can save ...
would better be used for the benefit of the inhabitants of Namibia.''
   Shearar also said that the Namibian force will not be
peacekeepers in the strict sense because Namibian police forces will
keep law and order before and during the elections planned for Nov.
1.
   The five permanent council members are assessed 57 percent of
peacekeeping costs. The United States, which is assessed one-quarter
of the regular U.N. budget, would be expected to pay about 30
percent for Namibia and other operations.

<HEAD>Takeshita Takes Responsibility for Cabinet Resignations</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita accepted blame for
the resignations of four Cabinet ministers and acknowledged his
scandal-scarred government has lost public confidence, in New Year's
comments released Sunday.
   Takeshita also said he wanted to expand relations with the Soviet
Union and other Asian countries and hoped Soviet leader Mikhail S.
Gorbachev will visit Japan in 1989.
   Two of the ministers resigned in a major stock scandal that has
roiled Japan and prompted the resignations of more than a dozen
government and business leaders.
   ``I am solely to blame for four ministers resigning,'' Takeshita
said in a New Year's news conference held Friday but embargoed until
Sunday. ``Somehow we have to regain the public's trust.''
   He did not make specific proposals.
   Takeshita has apologized indirectly for the scandal before,
saying every politican must conduct himself ethically. However, this
was the first time he has laid the blame solely and explicitly on
himself.
   Takeshita's Cabinet has taken a beating in recent weeks despite
the prime minister's success last month in pushing sweeping tax
reform legislation through Parliament.
   Justice Minister Takashi Hasegawa resigned Friday _ only three
days after he was appointed in a Cabinet shakeup _ after it was
revealed he received political donations from a company embroiled in
the stock-trading scandal he was appointed to investigate.
   Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa stepped down early December
after repeatedly changing his explanation of a close aide's purchase
of unlisted shares of the company's real estate subsidiary at
bargain prices.
   The director of the National Land Agency stepped down in May
after he created a controversy by claiming Japan was not responsible
for World War II, and the chief of the Defense Agency resigned to
take responsibility for a navy submarine's collision with a fishing
boat in July which left 30 people dead.
   In foreign affairs, Takeshita pledged to keep U.S.-Japanese
relations at the center of his foreign policy, but he said he would
extend Japan's diplomacy toward the Soviet Union, Asia and the
Pacific region.
   Tokyo and Moscow never signed a peace treaty officially ending
hostilities after World War II largely due to a territorial dispute
over a group of Soviet-held islands off northern Japan.
   Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze visited Japan last
month. The two sides did not reach agreement on the occupied
territories but vowed to discuss the matter further.
   Takeshita said at the news conference that he hoped Soviet
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev will come to Tokyo this year for the
first visit to Japan by a top Soviet leader.
   He also said he was looking forward to an early meeting with
President-elect Bush in Washington but he gave no date.
   Earlier plans for Takeshita to visit Washington in January were
canceled, ostensibly because of domestic political scheduling.
However, the stock trading scandal and 87-year-old Emperor
Hirohito's prolonged illness may have been additional factors.
   At his news conference, Takeshita did not mention the emperor,
who has been bedridden since Sept. 19 with internal hemorrhaging.

   A tanker trailer carrying thousands of
pounds of a hazardous chemical burst into flames along an interstate
highway, forcing the evacuation Saturday of several hundred people,
officials said.
   No one was injured, Interstate 12 was closed. Officials said the
evacuees were allowed to return home late Saturday.
   Two hospitals in the area had been put on standby for possible
evacuations, but patients were not moved.
   The truck carried 43,000 pounds of a granular form of sodium
hydrosulfite, which is used as a commercial cleaner. It burst into
flames on Interstate 12 about 25 miles north of New Orleans about
midnight, said State Police Sgt. John Adams.
   The cause of the fire was not immediately determined.
   Sodium hydrosulfite can produce irritating or poisonous gas as it
burns, Adams said. He said the material, even when it is not on
fire, can burn the skin and is harmful if inhaled.
   At midafternoon, the fire had ebbed but was still smoldering.
Adams said the cleanup was not expected to be finished until late
Saturday.
   ``They brought in a front-end loader. They'll wash the remaining
chemical into the median, dam it up, and then vacuum it into tanker
trucks that will haul it away,'' he said.
   State police said the two lanes of the interstate, which were
closed about 12:30 a.m., would probably not be opened before early
evening or later. The interstate runs east-west, north of Lake
Pontchartrain.
   ``We aren't going to open it until we have the area cleaned up
and are sure there's no danger,'' Adams said. ``We're routing
traffic onto state highways. So far it's not causing any problems.''
   The driver of the truck, Richard C. Blanton of Nashville, Tenn.,
said he was headed west on the interstate about midnight when a
motorist flagged him down and told him the truck's trailer was on
fire. Blanton pulled over and unhitched the trailer, leaving it
beside the highway.
   ``I looked back and saw flames shooting out of both sides of the
trailer. It seemed like instant fire, I hadn't seen anything before
the lady hollered at me,'' Blanton said.
   Blanton said the rig was owned by Chattanooga Orient Express, a
trucking company out of Chattanooga, Tenn.
   ``It took me about 30 seconds to unhook and get out of there. I
went about a quarter of a mile down the highway. I didn't know if
that would be far enough. I don't think a full state is far enough
away right now,'' Blanton said as he watched his burning rig.
   Blanton said he had hauled hazardous chemicals before, but never
sodium hydrosulfite.
   ``I saw a training film while it was being loaded,'' he said.
   The chemical belonged to the Virginia Chemical Co., of
Portsmouth, Va., and was loaded at the Bucks, Ala., terminal, Adams
said.

   Investigators believe the bomb that destroyed a Pan
Am jumbo jet was smuggled onto the flight in Frankfurt, possibly by
a Lebanese passenger duped into carrying it, British newspapers
reported Saturday.
   The West German government said there was no evidence to back up
the reports.
   The father of 21-year-old student Khalid Jaafar said FBI agents
in Michigan questioned him Friday about reports his son, who died in
the explosion, unwittingly carried the bomb that destroyed the jet.
   Nazir Jaafar of Dearborn, Mich., said the FBI told him ``they
have no evidence against my son. They didn't have any indication he
was involved.''
   The Times of London reported that sophisticated explosive
equipment similar to that believed used in the bombing was found
during a raid in West Germany.
   Crews searched the Solway Firth estuary between Scotland and
England on Saturday looking for more wreckage and 29 bodies still
missing from the crash in Lockerbie, Scotland, that killed 259
people on the plane and left 11 people on the ground missing and
presumed dead.
   A police spokesman said helicopters and coast guard teams turned
up nothing.
   The Times reported that investigators told Scottish police the
bomb that destroyed the Boeing 747 was placed on board the flight in
Frankfurt. The Times did not name its sources.
   The flight originated in Frankfurt with a Boeing 727 and switched
to the Boeing 747 at London's Heathrow Airport for the trip to New
York.
   The Times said a Palestinian terrorist cell, known to be part of
the hard-line Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General
Command, has been operating in Frankfurt more than 18 months and
carried out two bombing attacks on U.S. military trains.
   British investigators will be shown evidence of the terrorist
cell and given access to an unidentified Palestinian man arrested by
West German security forces two months ago and suspected of being a
senior figure in the PFLP-GC, the paper said.
   The Syrian-backed PFLP-GC has denied involvement in the bombing.
   A series of raids Oct. 23 in the city of Neuss, about 100 miles
northwest of Frankfurt, turned up a barometric detonator and other
sophisticated equipment for making explosives, The Times quoted
unidentified West German officials as saying.
   The barometric device, set off by altitude, is similar to the one
being blamed for the Lockerbie disaster, the paper said.
   In response to the reports, West German Interior Ministry
spokesman Michael A. Butz said, ``There is no indication that the
explosives could have been put on board at Frankfurt airport.''
   He said investigators described the Times' report as
contradictory to evidence gathered.
   The Telegraph said some members of Khalid Jaafar's family
suspected he may have been used to plant the bomb and had provided
details of his background and movements in Europe to the FBI.
   In Washington, the FBI refused comment on the report.
   In his weekly radio message broadcast Saturday from a friend's
estate in Palm Springs, Calif., President Reagan talked of the
``shock and horror'' of the jetliner bombing.
   He made reference to a report overseen by President-elect Bush
that advocates military action as an option against terrorists. He
said the report ``ought to be giving some people sleepless nights''
but did not elaborate.
   An unidentified associate of the Jaafar family was quoted as
saying Jaafar's mother, who lives in Damascus, is a first cousin of
Syrian President Hafez Assad. The Telegraph also said Jaafar lived
in Frankfurt with some Lebanese-Arab expatriates whom he did not
know well.
   ``His are exactly the type of relationships that we will be
analyzing,'' Neil Gallagher, head of the FBI's counterterrorism
section, was quoted as saying.
   ``They asked me if I knew the guy who made that rumor,'' the
elder Jaafar said of the FBI agents who interviewed him. He said he
told the FBI agents he had no idea where the report came from and
that the agents told him they had no leads either.
   Jaafar filed a $50 million lawsuit against Pan Am on Thursday
alleging negligence.
   Czechoslovakia offered to send experts to help identify the
explosive that blew up the jet following suggestions it might have
been Semtex. Semtex is an orange-colored plastic explosive
manufactured in Czechoslovakia.
   The Czechoslovak Foreign Ministry also denied Czechoslovakia ever
provided explosives to terrorists.
   Airports across Asia tightened security after a warning that
Palestinian terrorists plan to attack a commercial airliner in the
region by Jan. 10.
   About two weeks before the Pan Am crash, a caller claiming to
speak for a terrorist group led by Abu Nidal warned the U.S. Embassy
in Helsinki, Finland, that a Pan American World Airways jetliner
flying from Frankfurt to New York would be attacked. However, U.S.
officials have said the call was a hoax and its timing was a
coincidence.
   In Seattle, a Boeing Co. spokesman said the plane that crashed
carried 950 pounds of slightly radioactive ``depleted'' uranium in
its tail section.
   Spokesman Craig Martin, responding to reports in London that the
plane contained uranium, said the heavy metal used as a
counterweight in 550 747s could have given off some airborne
radiation for a short time if it oxidized in a four-hour fuel fire.
He said such a fire would be ``exceptionally unusual'' and did not
occur in the crash of Flight 103.

   Two people were killed and four others wounded
in separate shootings blamed on a single gang, police said Saturday.
   The deaths occurred in Los Angeles' gang-dominated south side
Friday night, and police said the attackers got away.
   Raymond Smith, 21, and Adam Lopez, 16, were killed in separate
drive-by shootings within 15 minutes, said police Sgt. Stacey Coon.
   Police blamed gang rivalry, but had made no arrests.
   In three other attacks Friday night and Saturday morning four
people were wounded, two critically, and police blamed members of
the Rockwood gang, said Sgt. Sam Layton.
   Edward Enrique Moran, 21, was wounded in the leg by a bullet
fired from a stairwell crowded with alleged gang members. Moran was
driving in his car when he was struck, Layton said.
   Moran was able to continue driving to a hospital where he was
treated and released, the sergeant said.
   A gang challenge and shouted profanities similar to those in the
Moran shooting preceded the second attack an hour and a half later
on Raymon Gomez, 24, Layton said.
   Gomez was hospitalized in serious but stable condition.
   Mary Lou Vega, 19, and a teen-age boy suffered critical wounds in
the third alleged Rockwood gang shooting on a street corner early
Saturday, Layton said.
   Ms. Vega underwent emergency surgery for a gunshot wound to the
shoulder and was listed in critical but stable condition.
   The 15-year-old boy, whose name was withheld because of his age,
suffered wounds to the back and arm and was also listed in critical
but stable condition, a nursing supervisor at County-USC Medical
Center said. All three victims were at the medical center.

   Cuban President Fidel Castro met Saturday with
a papal envoy to discuss the possibility of a visit by Pope John
Paul II, the official Cuban news agency Prensa Latina said.
   Cardinal Roger Etchegaray of France said improving relations
between Cuba, which is celebrating the 30th anniversary of Castro's
communist revolution, and the Roman Catholic Church make a papal
visit a real possibility.
   The cardinal, who was attending a religious conference in Havana,
spoke at a news conference after his meeting with Castro. The report
on his comments by Prensa Latina was monitored in Mexico City.
   Etchegaray said no date has been set for what would be the first
papal visit to Cuba, which has been officially atheist since the
revolution.

   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev said in his New
Year's message to the Soviet people that his reform program is
proceeding slower than hoped and told them not to expect ``manna
from heaven.''
   In a televised address delivered 10 minutes before the Kremlin
chimes struck midnight, Gorbachev cited improvements in national
income, labor productivity, housing, food supply and in making
Soviet society more democratic.
   The 57-year-old Kremlin leader said ``perestroika'' _ the Russian
word for restructuring used to describe his reforms _ improved the
country's economic, political, social and spiritual life.
   But he added: ``Economic reform did not yet come into full play.
And the results cannot satisfy us. Shortages and other difficulties
in our daily lives are still making themselves felt. Demand still
outstrips supply, especially when it comes to quality goods.''
   Overall, he said his reform program was sluggish.
   ``Perestroika gave rise to great expectations in society, but
changes are not coming as fast as we all would like them to,'' the
bespectacled Gorbachev said as he sat at a desk with four white
telephones and a lamp in what appeared to be his office.
   ``We are not awaiting and are not promising manna from heaven,
knowing well that the burden of unresolved issues is heavy, and our
road is difficult,'' he said.
   In a New Year's message to the American people, Gorbachev said:
``Americans seem to be rediscovering the Soviet Union _ and we are
rediscovering America. Fears and suspicion are gradually giving way
to trust and feelings of mutual liking.''
   He cited global movement toward peace, saying that ``1988 is
memorable for all of us as a year when we began reducing the most
terrifying weapons _ nuclear weapons,'' according a text released by
the White House. He said progress was made in the Afghan civil war,
in the Persian Gulf war, in the Middle East and in other parts of
the world.
   The Soviet leader also thanked the American people and others
around the world for help in relief efforts after the December
earthquake in Soviet Armenia.
   In the message to his own people, Gorbachev, after a year at the
helm of a country that faced ethnic unrest, political trouble in the
Baltics and other domestic problems, took a deep breath and paused.
He said the end of 1988 was ``darkened by anguish'' over the
earthquake in Armenia which leveled dozens of villages and cities
and is estimated to have killed about 25,000 people. He said the
Dec. 7 quake was ``our common misfortune'' and promised the
devastated area will be rebuilt.
   The Communist Party chief said improvements in the nation's
economy will come in 1989 with expansion of a system in which
factories and other businesses must become financially
self-sufficient, and widening of the nationwide network of
cooperative, or privately run, businesses.
   Gorbachev and the Kremlin leadership launched a major campaign in
mid-year to improve the supply and quality of food and consumer
goods. Shortages of these items have led to notoriously long lines
at shops, to hoarding and corruption.
   Gorbachev got a taste of the people's anger over the shortages
during a trip to Siberia in September. Residents shouted complaints
to him about shortages of everything from meat to hot water.
   The shortages were still felt acutely at New Year's, the most
joyous of Soviet holidays when people try to prepare lavish feasts
and exchange gifts. Among the hard-to-find staples of holiday meals
were chicken, coffee, sugar, yeast and candy. Soviets were having a
hard time finding certain toys, cheap bath soap and other consumer
goods.
   Angry Soviets flooded newspapers with complaints. One angry woman
wrote to the Literaturnaya Gazeta newspaper on Thursday that the
absence of some goods in stores is ``clear sabotage'' and said those
responsible should be put on trial.
   Gorbachev's New Year's message was quite similar to the last one.
On the eve of 1988, Gorbachev said ``immense and hard work'' lay
ahead in his drive for economic change.
   On international affairs, Gorbachev said the Cold War is winding
down and that the Soviet Union has learned to listen to the opinions
of other countries.
   In his message to the Soviet people, he did not mention any
specific accomplishments in world affairs in 1988 _ such as the
agreement with the United States to destroy all medium- and
shorter-range nuclear missiles _ or goals for 1989, such as working
out an agreement with the United States to slash arsenals of
long-range nuclear weapons by 50 percent.
   Soviet television followed Gorbachev's speech by shots of the
Kremlin's Spassky Tower as its chimes rang 12 times at midnight.
``1989'' flashed on the screen in pink, and the camera panned a
snowy Red Square, where the temperature was 18 degrees.
   President Reagan was scheduled to address the Soviet people on
television Sunday.

   Fifty anti-abortion protesters were
arrested at two abortion clinics Saturday as they blocked the
entrances by lying down and praying, police said.
   Behind the protesters were a large group of pro-choice activists
holding signs reading ``Stand Up for Choice'' and ``Hands Off Other
People's Bodies.''
   Many of those arrested were dragged or carried by their feet and
legs into police paddy wagons. They were charged with disorderly
conduct and trespassing, said Officer Ronald Patterson.
   The Pro-Life Action Network staged the protests. The group is
affiliated Operation Rescue, a New York-based group that has
organized protests since this summer at abortion clinics around the
country.
   Helene Weitzenkorn, a representative of the National Organization
For Women (NOW), said the pro-choice activists heard about the
protest early Saturday morning and mobilized.

   Venezuela declared a moratorium on much
of the nation's $35 billion foreign debt Saturday and announced new
refinancing talks beginning in January.
   President Jaime Lusinchi, in his traditional year-end speech,
said amortization of the nation's foreign bank debt, included in a
$20.34 billion refinancing pact, will be suspended as of January 17.
He said new talks will begin in the first days of January.
   The president said his decision was due to continued low oil
prices and the ``broken promise'' by creditor banks to provide
Venezuela with voluntary new loans.
   The move came a day after Colombia for the first time suspended
payments on its $16.5 billion foreign debt for three months while it
awaited a new loan to help meet the payments.
   ``I gave precise instructions to the finance minister, Dr. Hector
Hurtado, to officially notify creditor banks that from January 17,
1989 onwards we will suspend amortization payments on all the
foreign bank debt outstanding as of 1983,'' Lusinchi said in his
half-hour televised address.
   The president also said he asked Hurtado to schedule
restructuring talks ``so that it can be repaid by Venezuela without
affecting its development needs.''
   Venezuela, Latin America's fourth-largest debtor nation, is
scheduled to pay $700 million in principal next year under its
current refinancing agreement, its second since its debt crisis
began in 1982.
   It is one of the few major debtors to pay capital as well as
interest, and one of the few to avoid adopting an International
Monetary Fund austerity program.
   In 1988 it paid around $5 billion in principal and interest on
public and private foreign debts, while its total foreign exchange
income is estimated to reach just $10.1 billion, including $8.15
billion from oil industry exports.
   Lusinchi placed Venezuela among those debtor nations which
consider themselves incapable of repaying their foreign debts under
the current plan promoted by the United Statess, in which debtors
adopt market-oriented economic reforms in return for financial help
in paying off old debts.
   ``The fall in oil prices, the failure of the refinancings done up
to now by debtor nations, and the selfish lack of understanding on
the part of creditor nations has put us all in an unsustainable
situation which we cannot tolerate any longer,'' he said.
   ``The debt can never be repaid with more debt,'' he said.
   President-elect Carlos Andres Perez, who will be inaugurated in
February, has called for a common Latin American framework for
future debt talks which would link debt payments to exports.
   Perez advisers have called for a new refinancing pact that would
stretch out payments over up to 25 years and include several years
of grace. Under its current 14-year agreement, Venezuela would have
to pay back its debt by 1999.
   Regarding the national economy, Lusinchi said Venezuela's total
output of goods and services in 1988 grew by 4.2 percent, a
one-percent increase over 1987 growth.
   He said unemployment fell to 7 percent. Inflation, which was
running at 26.8 percent for the first 11 months of the year, remains
``one of the fundamental problems'' of the Venezuelan economy, he
said.

   President Reagan and President-elect Bush will
likely fight having to testify in Oliver North's defense by using a
separation-of-powers argument and by contending that their testimony
is not relevant, sources said Saturday.
   Bush's legal counsel, Boyden Gray, said he expects motions to
quash North's subpoenas will be filed soon, with legal briefs
stressing the separation-of-powers issue and the precedent that no
U.S. president has ever been required to take the stand in court.
   ``I think that's going to happen,'' he said when asked if the
White House would fight the subpoenas that were delivered to the
Justice Department on Friday.
   He said the issues of executive privilege and protection of
classified materials would be part of the arguments if the decision
for a motion to quash is made. Much of the information in the case
involves national security matters, and the government's desire to
protect that is seen as a plus for North's case.
   In addition, government attorneys, who have been preparing for
the likelihood of the subpoenas for several months, would also
contend that testimony from Reagan and Bush is not relevant to
North's defense, according to sources who spoke on the condition of
anonymity.
   In Palm Springs, Calif., where Reagan was spending New Year's
eve, Deputy White House Press Secretary Roman Popadiuk would say
only that ``the subpoena is currently under review.'' He said he did
not know whether attorneys were conferring on the subject over the
holiday weekend.
   Popadiuk said Reagan, staying at the desert home of publishing
magnate Walter Annenberg, was told by his chief of staff, Kenneth N.
Duberstein, on Friday that the subpoena had been served. He said
Reagan had been told in advance that it was coming and therefore was
not surprised.
   The Washington Post quoted a White House official as saying,
under the condition of anonymity, that Reagan viewed the subpoena as
an attempt to prod him into pardoning North before he leaves office
Jan. 20.
   Popadiuk, asked about this, said, ``I will not speculate on Mr.
North's counsel's motives.''
   One North attorney Saturday told CBS News that other prominent
figures in the Iran-Contra affair also would be subpoenaed to
testify.
   Asked if he would name former national security advisers John
Poindexter and Robert McFarland as among those likely to be called,
the unidentified lawyer said, ``No, I can not, but they'd be the
obvious ones that are involved in this matter.''
   During the congressional Iran-Contra hearings, North and his
superior, Poindexter, said they had no direct orders from Reagan or
Bush, then vice president, to carry out the secret Contra aid plan.
   However, one White House official close to the case acknowledged,
``It would be very useful for North to have Ronald Reagan's
testimony ... to say that he wanted the Contras supported.''
   Constitutional expert Laurence Tribe of Harvard University said
that in calling Reagan, North's challenge would be ``to show he was
carrying out specific orders of the president'' in his secret Contra
supply operation.
   North's trial is to begin Jan. 31 on charges stemming from the
U.S. arms sales to Iran and diversion of proceeds to the Contra
rebels in Nicaragua.
   He is charged with conspiring with Poindexter and arms dealers to
illegally divert more than $12 million in arms-sales profits to the
Contras.
   White House legal counsel A.B. Culvahouse Jr. declined comment on
the matter Saturday.
   Reagan remained out of reporters' range as he vacationed in
California where he traditionally spends New Year's Eve partying at
the Rancho Mirage estate of publisher Walter Annenberg, his longtime
friend.
   Bush also was in seclusion, spending a long holiday weekend with
his wife, Barbara, at the presidential retreat of Camp David, Md.
   Spokesmen for the two declined comment on the personal reactions
of Bush and Reagan to the subpoenas.
   Bush press secretary Sheila Tate said attorneys were ``looking at
some very serious legal and constitutional issues,'' and there would
be no comment. The White House said Friday it would be premature to
respond.
   Written questions and answers, however, apparently would not be a
problem for Reagan and Bush. The White House statement said
historical precedent would point in that direction rather than court
appearances.
   Tribe contended that Bush, who will be president by the time the
trial starts, would have a better chance than Reagan to fight off
the subpoena.
   Bush's argument could be ``fairly plausible,'' on two fronts,
Tribe said in a telephone interview from Denver.
   First, Reagan was North's boss, while Bush has said he was ``out
of the loop'' on most of the matters in question.
   Second, as a sitting president, Bush might invoke an executive
privilege stating that involvement in the trial would interfere with
his national duties.
   Regarding Bush, Tribe said, North ``would have to make a very
strong showing which I think is very unlikely.
   ``Almost anything he would have to prove through Bush could be
shown through pre-existing documents or written answers. And second,
any alleged need to cross-examine the president would necessarily be
quite speculative in light of the president-elect's own assertion
that he was out of the loop.''
   Reagan, on the other hand, will no longer be president when the
trial begins, and thus would have a harder time making the executive
privilege argument.
   ``I think there's a very good chance he'll have to testify,''
Tribe said.
   A White House official told The Washington Post that Reagan
viewed the subpoena as an attempt to prod him into pardoning North.
Reagan has said, however, that justice should be allowed to take its
course and the case should be decided at trial.
   One attorney close to the case said the ``institution of the
presidency'' and the reticence to set a precedent of having a
president testify are central to arguments against the subpoenas.
   The case could pose a nettlesome issue for Bush early in his
presidency, reviving questions that dogged him through much of his
presidential campaign.
   The congressional Iran-Contra investigating committees concluded
last year that there was no evidence Bush knew of the diversion plan.
   But questions have continued to crop up on how Bush could not
have known about North's secret operation to supply the Contras
during the congressional ban on aid when his national security
adviser, Donald Gregg, was informed on the matter.
   The Iran-Contra committees concluded Gregg was told of North's
operation in August 1986, but he testified he did not consider the
matter worthy of Bush's attention, even after a supply plane piloted
by Americans was shot down by the Nicaraguans and the U.S.
government disavowed any connection with it.
   In addition, Bush met with former CIA operative Felix Rodriguez,
a Gregg associate and an operative of North's in the Contra
operation, according to committee testimony. But they said they
discussed Rodriguez' activities in El Salvador, not the Contras.

   More than 220 oil-coated sea birds
were found Saturday, the highest one-day number since 70,000 gallons
of oil spilled from a damaged barge, a U.S. Fish and Wildlife
Service official said.
   The growing numbers and worsening condition of some birds at a
treatment facility in the Ocean Shores Convention Center may require
that more be euthanized, said Don Kane of the Fish and Wildlife
Service.
   Searchers had found more than 220 live oil-coated birds by
mid-day Saturday, bringing the total number of birds awaiting or
receiving treatment to about 1,500.
   Kane said officials were monitoring the birds' condition on a
daily basis to see if more should be euthanized. Spokesman Mark
Stewart of the state Division of Emergency Management said 350 birds
were euthanized Friday.
   Kane said they considered not just the condition of the birds,
but how sensitive each species is to oil and the resources available
to treat them at the center. He said 348 of the birds were murres
and two were grebes.
   At the center, volunteers were scrubbing the birds with detergent
to remove the oil. Those that regain their buoyancy eventually are
returned to the wild.
   More than 1,000 other birds that had already died from the spill
have been collected along 200 miles of coastline, from Newport,
Ore., to Jefferson County, Wash., including wilderness beaches of
Olympic National Park.
   The spill occurred Dec. 22 when an oil barged collided with a tug.

   Harold W. Zancanata, a scientist and
pioneer in the U.S. space program who developed some of the first
booster rockets for testing the atmosphere, has died of a heart
attack at age 70.
   Zancanata died Wednesday at Florida Medical Center.
   For more than 30 years, Zancanata developed rockets and launched
them from sites in several states, including Cape Canaveral in
Florida and White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico.
   ``He was the project officer responsible for instrumenting
rockets used to study the physics and chemistry of the upper
atmosphere,'' said William Dean, a retired Army mathematician who
worked closely with Zancanata.
   In 1952, Zancanata combined a German V-2 rocket captured during
World War II with a U.S. Corporal rocket and launched the missile
250 miles, a record at the time, said a son, Rodney Zancanata, of
Oakland Park.
   Zancanata and a team of scientists fired rockets in the ealry
1960s from Christmas and Johnson islands in the Pacific Ocean to
study the effects of nuclear blasts on the atmosphere.
   He got a degree in electrical engineering from the Milwaukee
Institute of Technology and spent the next few years working in the
federal Civilian Conservation Corps.
   He joined the U.S. Army as a research scientist in 1941.
   Zancanato is survived by his wife, two sons, two daughters, a
sister and four grandchildren. Funeral services were pending.

   A hospital overrode a Jehovah's Witnesses'
objections to a blood transfusion despite protests that it went
against her religion. Her lawyer called the hospital's action
``medical rape.''
   The hospital said it was in the patient's best interest.
   Three people were arrested at the woman's bedside when they tried
to stop the transfusion.
   Jehovah's Witnesses base their objection to blood transfusions on
a passage in the book of Leviticus that reads: ``Whatsoever man ...
eats any manner of blood, I will cut him off from among his people.''
   Denise Nicoleau delivered a healthy girl on Thursday but
developed complications later. The family had requested _ prior to
the Caesarean delivery _ that no transfusions be performed, even as
a life-saving measure.
   The Brookhaven Memorial Hospital obtained a court order to give
the transfusion.
   Don Ridley, an attorney for the Nicoleau family, called the
hospital's action ``medical rape.''
   Ed Kornrieche, a lawyer for the hospital, said the welfare of the
mother and child prompted the hospital to seek the order.
   ``We believe the transfusion was in accordance with the law, and
we obtained a court order granting that,'' he said.
   Mrs. Nicoleau, who is in her 30s and lives in Moriches, was in
critical condition Saturday, said hospital spokesman Richard Semple.
   The court order was obtained Friday, and hospital officials tried
unsuccessfully that afternoon to convince the family to permit the
transfusion.
   Fifteen people surrounded Mrs. Nicoleau's bed about 5:30 p.m.
Friday and ``would not allow hospital personnel to administer the
transfusion,'' said Lt. Martin Joyce.
   Police were called and three people, including Mrs. Nicoleau's
husband, Herriot, were arrested for second-degree criminal trespass,
he said.
   All three were released on $25 bail and court dates were set.

   Federal regulators, working against a midnight
deadline, wrapped up the final rescue packages for insolvent savings
and loan associations Saturday, completing bailout deals for all of
1988 that will likely cost the government in excess of $38 billion.
   In just the final 48 hours of frenzied negotiations, the Federal
Home Loan Bank Board accepted packages that provided almost $6
billion in assistance, the bulk of that coming in $4 billion
bailouts involving some of the sickest S&Ls in the country.
   The final tally of insolvent S&Ls closed by the government and
taken over by new investors totaled 217 for the year. That put the
number of failed S&Ls at a 50-year high, exceeded only by 277
institutions that were closed in 1938 during the Great Depression.
By contrast, only 48 institutions were closed in 1987.
   Five of the institutions closed on the final day of 1988 were in
California, one was in Florida and another was in South Dakota.
   Negotiators wrapped up the final bailout only hours before a
midnight deadline that would effectively cut tax breaks in half for
purchasers.
   The final S&L closed in 1988 was one of the largest, the Beverly
Hills Savings and Loan Association, a giant California institution
which had plagued regulators for years.
   Beverly Hills had been the first institution placed in the
agency's management consignment program, where the sickest
institutions were warehoused because the agency could not find
buyers but did not have the funds to close the institutions and pay
off depositors.
   The bailout packaged called for the government to provide $983
million in assistance in the sale of Beverly Hills to Michigan
National Corp., a bank holding company in Farmington Hills, Mich.
For its part, the Michigan bank agreed to put up $52 million to
purchase the giant S&L.
   Attorneys representing the government and the Michigan bank had
haggled for most of the day over details of the complex sale. In
another buyout which had taken several hours to complete the
government agreed to inject into a Florida deal $151.1 million in
aid for the purchase of the insolvent Broward Federal Savings and
Loan of Sunrise, Fla., by a subsidiary of the Los Angeles-based
California Savings and Loan Association.
   Bank Board Chairman M. Danny Wall said he believed the deadline
had been a good thing for the government in its effort to finally
close the books and stop the hemorrhage of funds at S&Ls that have
been technically insolvent for years.
   He said the shutdown of the sick S&Ls should have a beneficial
effect on the industry as a whole by lowering the cost of funds for
healthy institutions that had been competing against the high rates
weak S&Ls were forced to pay to attract depositors.
   Wall defended his agency against charges by critics that the
agreements represented ``sweetheart deals'' that had been
unnecessarily generous to the buyers, who have included such wealthy
investors as Texas billionaire Robert Bass, Revlon cosmetics
chairman Ronald O. Perelman and the Ford Motor Co.
   ``These are not precipitous actions,'' he said. ``This has been a
very extensive and exhaustive process'' culminating in the final
decisions.
   Wall said the cost of simply closing down the S&Ls and paying off
depositors up to the $100,000 insurance limit would have been far
more xpensive than the $38 billion in projected costs for all the
agreements reached in 1988.
   But the S&L crisis will present President-elect Bush with one of
its first headaches as he is forced to come up with ways to boost
government spending to clean up the mess while at the same time
trying to fulfill his campaign pledge of lowering the budget deficit
without raising taxes.
   The bank board saved some of the biggest bailouts until last,
announcing commitments within a space of two hours on Friday night
that will transfer close to $4 billion in government aid to three
investment groups.
   In the largest transaction, First Nationwide Financial Corp., the
S&L subsidiary of the Ford Motor Co., received $1.6 billion in
government assistance in the purchase of four failed S&Ls in Denver,
Chicago and Cleveland.
   The failed institutions had assets of $8 billion and when they
are merged into the First Nationwide network, the automaker will
have the country's second largest S&L business, with assets
exceeding $34 billion.
   The largest S&L is Home Savings of America, based in Irwindale,
Calif.
   The other two big takeovers announced late Friday involved the
purchase of the insolvent United Savings Association of Texas, one
of the biggest troubled Texas S&Ls, by a group headed by New York
investment banker Lewis Ranieri, who received $1.37 billion in
government assistance in making the purchase.
   The third megadeal involved a pledge by the government to provide
$1 billion to assist Golden West Financial Corp. of Oakland, Calif.,
in managing two large insolvent Florida institutions, Beach Federal
Savings and Loan in Boynton Beach and New Metropolitan Federal
Savings and Loan of Hialeah.

<TEXT>
   President Daniel Ortega blamed the
United States, capitalism, and Hurricane Joan for Nicaragua's
shattered economy in his year-end speech to the nation Saturday and
rejected new talks with the rebels.
   Ortega also was quoted Saturday as saying astronomical inflation
will get worse before it gets better.
   Nicaragua suffers 21,000 percent inflation, one of the highest
rates in the world, Ortega was quoted as saying. ``While we are in
war, the inflation will continue to rise,'' Ortega told Barricada,
the official newspaper of the ruling Sandinista party.
   U.S.-backed rebels known as Contras have been trying to oust the
leftist government of Nicaragua since 1981, two years after the
revolution in which the Sandinistas took power from the rightist
Somoza family dictatorship.
   Most of the Sandinistas' promises of a more just society remain
unfulfilled because of poor economic management and the war, which
Ortega says has killed 29,113 people and done more than $12 billion
in economic damage.
   A cease-fire and cutoff of U.S. military aid to the rebels have
reduced fighting to small skirmishes most of this year, but talks on
a permanent peace broke down in September.
   In his nationally broadcast speech to diplomats, state workers,
and others at a military school in the capital, Ortega rejected the
latest Contra proposals for peace talks, including one for a January
round in Washington.
   ``This is an unburied monster,'' he said of the rebels. ``It
gives off a stench in all directions. It tosses out one reeking
proposal here and another there. One can't tell which is from the
United States, which ultimately is the one that arms this monster
and doesn't know where to bury it or how to bury it.''
   But he also said the Sandinistas were unilaterally extending the
cease-fire another month and that Nicaragua is ready to ``look for
ways to coexist with the enemies of the revolution.''
   Bosco Matamoros, a Contra spokesman, called Ortega's speech
``lamentable.''
   ``We thought that with the new year we could open the hopes for
peace and democracy in Nicaragua,'' he said in a telephone interview
in Washington. ``Apparently Mr. Ortega's concern for the process of
negotiation seems to be once again only his desire to remain in
power.''
   The Sandinista government and the Contras agreed March 21 to
suspend offensive operations, but talks aimed at a permanent end to
the 7-year-old war stand at an impasse.
   Ortega said the United States is still arming the Contras despite
the official end to overt military aid in February, the month before
the cease-fire agreement was signed.
   He blamed the ``sustained aggression'' of the United States, the
capitalism of developed nations, and the devastating October
hurricane for Nicaragua's worsening economic crisis.
   Hurricane Joan, which Ortega called the most dramatic moment of
his presidency, struck the Atlantic Coast, destroying several cities
and scores of villages before sweeping across the country. Ortega
said it did $828 million in direct damage.
   Ortega ended his two-hour speech with a tirade against President
Reagan, describing him as a ``terrorist'' and ``obsessed.'' He
repeated his assertion that the United States might invade Nicaragua.
   He said the 1989 Sandinista economic policy would use continued
subsidies on rice, beans and sugar for government workers and
military families.
   The average Nicaraguan worker earns about $10 a month, which is
insufficient even for basic food needs.
   Ortega also promised a cut in defense spending, which is about 60
percent of the national budget, in 1989. The vast majority of
Nicaragua's military and economic aid comes from the Soviet Union
and its allies.
   He said imports will be severely restricted in a money-saving
measure. ``We aren't going to import even one more typewriter,''
Ortega vowed.
   In the Barricada interview, Ortega said Nicaraguans must wait for
prosperity until the government is secure against the rebels.
   Official sources who spoke on condition of anonymity said Ortega
is going to Cuba for the 30th anniversary celebration of the Cuban
revolution. The sources did not say when he was leaving. The
anniversary is Sunday.

<HEAD>Scientist: Recently Discovered Memo Casts Doubt Over Plant's
Figures</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CINCINNATI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A recently discovered 1964 memo concerning
leaks at a federally owned uranium processing plant ``throws all the
plant's data into doubt,'' a scientist said.
   The memo, written by the staff of the Feed Materials Production
Center at Fernald, Ohio, said a study by plant operators in 1961
found emissions of up to 1,000 pounds each month that year _
possibly 12,000 pounds _ from Fernald's Plant 8.
   That total is nearly 24 times the U.S. Department of Energy's
estimate of 462 pounds of uranium emissions from Plant 8 in 1961.
   The memo's discovery follows the government's admission in
October that the complex had released 54,000 more pounds of uranium
than its estimates showed _ after those estimates already had been
revised upward in 1985, 1986 and 1987.
   Lawyers representing Fernald-area residents said Friday they
found the memo among 30,000 documents submitted by the federal
goverment.
   ``This is a truly extraordinary document,'' said Arjun Makhijani,
a Maryland environmental scientist. His 1987 study of Fernald
emissions concluded that government reports severely underestimated
the problem.
   The memo was written by the engineering staff of National Lead of
Ohio, the plant's operator from 1951 through 1985, as part of an
internal investigation of unexplained losses of uranium from one
part of the complex.
   The plant, which National Lead operated under contract with the
federal government, processes uranium for the U.S. nuclear weapons
program.
   U.S. Rep. Thomas Luken, D-Ohio, said he would hold more
congressional hearings on the plant because of the discrepancy
between the newly discovered data and the most recent federal
figures.
   James Reafsnyder, DOE site manager at Fernald since 1985, said
the memo's numbers may be included in revised estimates that will be
released in the next few months. He declined to comment on the memo.

   Opposition parties mounted a rally of
thousands of Sudanese late Saturday in the wake of four days of
anti-government unrest, and they demanded that the government seek
peace with rebels in the south.
   ``There is no northern Sudan without southern Sudan, there is no
south without north,'' chanted the crowd of several thousand, many
dressed in traditional flowing robes, in a dusty square of Omdurman,
just north of the capital.
   Khartoum itself began returning to normal earlier in the day
after the anti-government strikes and street violence crippled
communications, hampered sea and air travel and virtually paralyzed
key cities.
   The strikes ended after the financially strapped government
agreed to roll back huge price increases that went into effect on
Monday.
   Up to four people died and 26 were wounded during the four days
of demonstrations and strikes, Western military and diplomatic
sources said.
   As Khartoum's dusty streets slowly returned to normal, signs of
the turmoil remained _ glass shards from smashed car windows, pieces
of cement blocks and blackened remains of burned tires.
   Leaders of Saturday's opposition rally, which also marked the eve
of the anniversary of national independence in 1956, said the strife
stemmed from the people's desire for peace, not just from
dissatisfaction over the econony.
   ``It is not just the issue of raising the price of sugar that
made the people take to the streets; the issue is peace, the
Sudanese people came to the streets to demand peace, and without
peace there can be no Sudan,'' Amin Okasha Mohamed, a member of the
Democratic Unionist Party told The Associated Press.
   He said his party would join several other groups, including
Communists and southern-based parties, to push for peace in the
nation's civil war.
   Some members of the rally demanded a national reconcilation
government to bring together squabbling factions. Some called for
early parliamentary elections, now scheduled for April 1990.
   The 2 million-member Sudanese Workers' Trade Union Federation,
which had called the general strike last week, ordered the return to
work late Friday because of the government's backdown on price
increases.
   The federation had demanded revocation of commodity price
increases of up to 500 percent and a 15 percent across-the-board
sales tax. It also wanted salary increases of 50 percent to 300
percent, decreed a week ago for all public and private employees, to
be made retroactive to July 1 instead of Dec. 1.
   In an emergency session on Thursday, Prime Minister Sadek Mahdi's
Cabinet met the two requests.
   But the demonstrations and strike evolved into protests over
Sudan's civil war. Demonstrators protested Mahdi's failure to
officially endorse a tentative peace accord the Democratic Unionist
Party, a junior partner in his coalition Cabinet, signed with
southern rebels on Nov. 16.
   The agreement called for a peace conference to be convened on
Dec. 31, with an immediate cease-fire in the 5 {-year-old war and
suspension of Islamic law, which the Christian and animist rebels
oppose.
   The prime minister refused to bring the accord before the Cabinet
or Parliament, fearing it would lead another coalition partner, the
fundamentalist National Islamic Front, to quit the government. The
Front opposes tampering with Islamic law.
   The Democratic Unionists, second-largest Cabinet and
parliamentary party after Mahdi's Umma, pulled out of the Cabinet on
Wednesday, protesting the premier's price and peace policies.
   Mahdi held consultations on Saturday to form a new coalition
government with the Islamic Front.
   Government sources speaking on condition of anonymity said a new
government is expected to be announced on Tuesday. They said Mahdi
will also ask for a parliamentary vote of confidence on Wednesday.
   Mahdi left Khartoum on Saturday for Obeid in southwestern Sudan
in an attempt to ensure the people that the situation was under
control, the government sources said.
   From Obeid, he will address the nation Sunday morning for the
independence anniversary, the sources said.
   Western diplomats and military sources said demonstrators on
Thursday broke into Mahdi's office compound, smashing parked
government cars and writing anti-government slogans on the walls.
The demonstrators demanded that the prime minister, who was inside,
come out and talk to them, but he refused.
   Electricity, water and air and land transportation services were
down during the general strike. Markets were empty, and bread and
vegetables disappeared. Both state television and radio were off the
air, and telephone communications were cut.
   In addition to Khartoum, rioting and the general strike hit other
provincial centers including Port Sudan, Gedaref, Kassala, Wad
Medani and Atbara.

<TEXT>
   More than 6,000 students in Chicago's elementary
and high schools attended classes without instructors on an average
day this fall, due to teacher absenteeism and a lack of substitutes,
according to a published report.
   The average of 6,540 students in classrooms without teachers each
day during the first four months of the school year is a drastic
increase over the average found in the early months of the 1987-88
school year, when 2,340 students were without regular teachers or
substitutes on a typical day, the Chicago Tribune reported in
Sunday's editions.
   Chicago teachers take an average 11 sick days a year, one more
than is provided under their labor contract without losing pay,
nearly double the national average, the Tribune said.
   Chicago Teachers Union spokesman Chuck Burdeen disputed those
figures Saturday, but acknowledged, ``There is a high level of sick
leave ... if it's higher in Chicago, that's something we'd have to
look at.''
   ``The solution is to find out what causes the illnesses and to
recognize too that teaching as a profession has a high level of
illness. That goes with the territory,'' Burdeen said.
   ``One of the problems is the (Chicago School) Board has not been
able to develop a substantial day-to-day substitute base,'' he said.
``You're dealing with a situation that's just characteristic of
teaching in Chicago,'' with salary disputes and other friction with
the school board, Burdeen said. ``Substitutes say, `Why should I
teach in a city where they don't respect teachers?'''
   School Board President Frank Gardner promised to look into the
problem when it was disclosed in a series of Tribune articles this
past spring.
   But Gardner said last week the investigation into classrooms
without teachers has taken a back seat to more pressing matters,
like the recently enacted school reform package, the newspaper said.
   The Tribune said its investigation found that about 6 percent of
the district's approximately 28,000 teachers missed school on any
given day this fall, compared with 5.5 percent last fall.
   Gardner said that by working with representatives of the teachers
union, ``we might be able to strengthen the program, where teachers
are rewarded to teach, and lessen the need for sick time.''
   Officials say the problem is aggravated by substitutes' ability
to refuse assignments to specific schools.
   But the Tribune said Sharon Goldberg, director of the public
schools' substitute teacher center, and her boss, Assistant
Superintendent Charles D. Almo, were off work last week for the
holidays and unavailable to explain the increase in absenteeism.

   Doctors say former Philippines President
Ferdinand Marcos won't be leaving the hospital where he is being
treated for heart problems for at least a few days, according to a
hospital spokeswoman.
   Marcos, 71, was admitted to St. Francis Medical Center on
Thursday, suffering ``the second severe episode of congestive heart
failure in a month,'' according to spokeswoman Norma Kop.
   He was confined for nine days earlier in December for treatment
of congestive heart failure, which means the heart is unable to pump
the amount of blood required by the body.
   ``He's not going home today,'' Ms. Kop said Saturday. ``It will
be a few days before he's released from our hospital.
   ``Doctors are fine-tuning his medication,'' Ms. Kop said. ``He
still remains in satisfacotry condition and improving.''
   Earlier Saturday, doctors had considered discharging Marcos on
Saturday or Sunday, she said.
   ``They said he looks good,'' she said. ``One of the doctors said
he's in satisfactory condition, so that's an improvement.''
   Marcos had been reported in guarded condition.
   Marcos and his wife, Imelda, face federal racketeering charges
accusing them of plundering more than $100 million from the
Philippines and stashing it in the United States. Mrs. Marcos
pleaded innocent to the charges Oct. 31 in New York.
   A hearing has been scheduled Jan. 19 in federal court in New York
City to determine if Marcos is healthy enough to face criminal
charges. He was allowed to skip an earlier hearing when his
attorneys contended he was too frail to make the trip.
   The Marcoses have been living here in exile since they were
ousted in a civilian-military revolt in February 1986.
   Also Saturday, Philipines President Corazon Aquino refused to
allow Marcos to return to is homeland.
   ``There are reports that the former president would like to
return to the Philippines in the light of his alleged failing

   ``Considerations of national welfare and interests'' caused her
to reject a return for Marcos, who ruled the island nation for 20
years.

<HEAD>Baby With Rare Disorder Receives New Liver, Small Intestine</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MADISON, Wis. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A 14-month-old Florida boy who suffered from
a rare disorder received a liver and small intestine Saturday during
experimental surgery that hospital officials said was successful.
   Calvin Oliveira was listed in critical but stable condition at
the University of Wisconsin Hospital and Clinics.
   ``The operation went smooth and well,'' said hospital spokesman
Mark Hendrickson.
   Calvin has a condition known as Short Bowel Syndrome, which left
only 5 percent of his small intestine functional. Calvin's liver was
deteriorating as a result of the intravenous feeding the condition
required.
   The chief surgeon was Dr. Munci Kalayoglu, director of the
pediatric liver program. He flew Friday to the East Coast to pick up
the donated organs.
   Calvin and his parents, of Deerfield Beach, Fla., flew by air
ambulance to Wisconsin after the organ donors were found Friday in
Rochester, N.Y., and Philadelphia.
   ``We're very optimistic,'' said Calvin's tearful father, Carlos
Oliveira. ``Everybody thought there wouldn't be any hope any more,
but there was always hope for us.''
   Hospital officials did not identify the organ donors or their
families.
   Doctors said 10 days ago the boy might not live until Christmas
because of frequent bouts with internal bleeding.
   The operation is expected to cost about $300,000. More than
one-third of that has been raised by friends and family and a plea
for money by Florida Gov. Bob Martinez.

   The condition of Japan's ailing Emperor Hirohito
took a turn for the worse Sunday while his son presided over New
Year's ceremonies at the imperial palace.
   The 87-year-old monarch, who has been bed-ridden since he first
hemorrhaged Sept. 19, lost a ``substantial amount'' of blood through
his bowels and needed a transfusion of 0.9 pints, palace officials
said.
   Hirohito received 0.4 pints of blood on Saturday. Combined with
the latest transfusion Sunday, Hirohito has been given a total of
more than 64 pints of blood since he fell ill.
   The emperor was also running a slight fever of 98.8 degrees
Sunday, up from 97.3 the previous night, a palace official said on
condition of anonymity.
   His systolic, or upper, blood pressure reading dropped to 76
Sunday from Saturday evening's level of 106.
   The systolic reading, usually averaging 120 for a healthy person,
indicates the pressure of the blood against artery walls when the
heart is beating. Doctors say a sustained reading under 100 can lead
to brain damage.
   The emperor missed for the first time the annual New Year's
ceremony on Sunday.
   Crown Prince Akihito, 56, the emperor's elder son and heir to the
throne, officiated at the event attended by imperial family
relatives, Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita, Cabinet ministers,
regional governors and other leading government officials.
   Hirohito marked the beginning of his 63rd year as emperor on Dec.
25, anniversary of the death of his father, Emperor Meiji. Hirohito
is the longest reigning monarch in the world.
   Under the post-World War II constitution, Japan's emperor holds
only symbolic power.

   Shelby Coffey III became editor of the Los
Angeles Times on Sunday, replacing William F. Thomas, who retired
after 17 years.
   Coffey, 42, a former editor at The Washington Post, said he will
work to continue giving readers comprehensive news coverage and will
emphasize quality writing and analysis.
   ``We will continue to give broad national and international
coverage and to intensify our strong local coverage in Southern
California,'' he said.
   Times Publisher Tom Johnson said Coffey, who has been known to
inspire reporters by reciting poetry and philosophy, is ``one of the
most literate, intelligent people I have ever met.''
   Coffey becomes the eighth editor in the paper's 107-year history.
   He will oversee an editorial staff of 1,206 at the Times, which
has a daily circulation of 1.1 million and a Sunday circulation of
1.4 million.
   Coffey graduated from the University of Virginia in 1968 and
spent 17 years at the Washington Post, starting out as a
sportswriter. At age 25, he became editor of the paper's Sunday
magazine and in 1976, he was appointed editor of the Style section.
   He was later named a deputy managing editor, and in 1984 took
charge of the Post's national news department.
   Coffey left the Post in March 1985 to become editor of U.S. News
& World Report, where he stayed less than a year.
   He was hired as editor of the Dallas Times Herald, which had been
owned by the Times Mirror Co. The company also publishes the Times.
He stayed at the Times Herald for seven months, when the paper was
sold.
   He joined the Times in 1986 as deputy associate editor and in
April became executive editor, putting him in line to succeed Thomas.
   Thomas, 64, took part in the newspaper's expansion and encouraged
a style of journalism in which reporters were given a freer reign to
write longer, more in-depth stories.
   Under Thomas's leadership, the paper doubled its staff size,
opened six foreign bureaus and five domestic bureaus, started three
new sections and won nine Pulitzer Prizes.
   Thomas also directed the launching of separate editions in San
Diego and the San Fernando Valley and greatly expanded the Orange
County edition.

   New Year's revelers gathered from London's Trafalgar Square to a
Tokyo stadium for a rock `n` roll concert, while earthquake victims
in Armenia received gifts from around the world.
   Presidents Reagan and Mikhail S. Gorbachev sent New Year's
messages to each other Saturday, hoping for still more progress in
U.S.-Soviet relations. Polish leader Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski said
talks with the opposition are ``ever more urgent,'' and South Korean
President Roh Tae-woo looked toward better ties with communist North
Korea.
   As Big Ben struck midnight, an estimated 100,000 New Year's
revelers jammed Trafalgar Square Sunday to ring in 1989, police said.
   Police arrested 88 people for public order offenses, mainly
drunken and disorderly behavior, a spokeswoman said.
   The London Ambulance Service said 15 people were hospitalized,
but none with serious injuries. It reported at least 87 others were
treated on the scene for minor injuries.
   Scotland Yard said the turnout was the largest since a violent
New Year's celebration six years ago, when two women were killed in
a surging crowd in the central London square, the traditional focal
point of celebrations for Londoners.
   In Manila, Philippines, hospitals reported at least 500 people
were injured by illegal fireworks during various New Year's
festivities. Fireworks also ignited at least six fires in the city,
where most homes and businesses are made from wood.
   Fireworks have been illegal in the Philippines since 1966, but
the ban is widely ignored because of local custom.
   In Japan, as thousands thronged to shrines to usher in the new
year, thousands of teen-agers welcomed 1989 singing and dancing to
the music of U.S. rock bands at a concert in downtown Tokyo Saturday.
   About 51,000 young Japanese people packed the Big Egg stadium for
the seven-hour show featuring Bon Jovi, Britany Fox, Kingdom Come
and Ratt.
   ``I will go to the shrine to pray after the concert so that I
will pass my exams,'' said Miwa Toyama, a 15-year-old junior high
school student who came dressed in a kimono.
   New Year's is usually observed with trips to the local shrine of
the animistic Shinto religion to pray for good luck in the coming
year.
   Victims of the earthquake in the Soviet republic of Armenia
received toys, jam, fruit, sweets and clothes as New Year's gifts
from around the world, the official Soviet news agency Tass reported.
   Red Cross workers handed out presents to 4,500 victims
hospitalized after the Dec. 7 quake that killed an estimated 25,000
people. Dolls and teddy bears were among the gifts distributed to
the children at Yerevan's traumatological hospital, a Red Cross
official said.
   Gorbachev, in a televised New Year's speech to the Soviet people,
called the earthquake ``our common misfortune'' and promised the
devastated area will be rebuilt. He also said his program of
economic and political ``perestroika,'' or reform, is not moving
quickly enough, but also said not to expect ``manna from heaven.''
   In a message to Reagan, he said: ``Americans seem to be
rediscovering the Soviet Union _ and we are rediscovering America.''
   Reagan, in a speech to be broadcast New Year's Day with a
voice-over translation on Soviet television, said: ``Despite our
disagreements, we have been able to find some common ground.''
   Reagan cited progress in human rights, arms reductions, regional
problems, and bilateral relations.
   Jaruzelski said in a New Year's Eve television address Saturday
that elections in 1989 should produce a national Parliament which
represents a wider range of views. Jaruzelski also said proposed
round-table talks with the opposition toward a permanent ``council
of national agreement'' had become ``ever more urgent.''
   Lech Walesa, head of the independent trade union movement
Solidarity, and other opposition figures have refused to take part
in the proposed talks until communist authorities confirm their
willingness to legalize the union banned after the 1981 military
crackdown.
   President Roh said 1989 will be a ``watershed year'' in South
Korea's march toward democracy and improving relations with North
Korea.
   ``If exchanges of visits and trade are initiated between the
South and the North, national unification before the end of the
present century will become a definite possiblity,'' he said.
   The two Korean states have been bitter rivals since their land
was divided in 1945.

   A confessed killer whose testimony led to the
convictions of seven of his former associates in a gang that
terrorized New York City has been released on probation.
   Francis ``Mickey'' Featherstone was released Dec. 23, two days
after U.S. District Court Judge Robert W. Sweet gave him a suspended
sentence with five years of probation on a federal racketeering
charge.
   The judge, who could have sentenced him to a minimum of 20 years
in prison, said his sentence balanced ``a violent past, a redemptive
present and an uncertain future.''
   Featherstone and his family were placed in the government's
witness protection program.
   In pleading guilty to the racketeering charge, Featherstone
admitted his participation in four murders, five murder conspiracies
and additional acts of loan-sharking, drug dealing and other crimes.
   Prosecutors said the gang, the ``Westies'' terrorized the West
Side of Manhattan through the 1970s and into the 1980s.
   Featherstone testified as a major witness in a trial that
resulted in the conviction this year of seven members of the
Westies, including James Coonan, the gang's leader, who received a
sentence of 75 years in prison.

   Fog-shrouded stretches of highway in Illinois and Florida on
Saturday led to a series of accidents, setting off fires and causing
cars to stack ``like pancakes.'' The Illinois accidents killed six
people and injured 18, officials said.
   At least 23 vehicles piled up along a five-mile stretch of
Interstate 74 in east-central Illinois, police said.
   ``They're having to pull them (the cars) out separately. I guess
they're just stacked in there like pancakes,'' said Sgt. Jerry Culp.
   Authorities said identities of the six victims would not be
released until Sunday, after relatives were notified.
   Officials said the highway was reopened by late afternoon. It was
closed in both directions between St. Joseph and Ogden, about 120
miles south of Chicago, after the accidents about 9 a.m. All traffic
during that time was re-routed to U.S. 150, Culp said.
   ``Several of the vehicles were all burnt up,'' Culp said. ``There
were 10 vehicles in the main accident, so you're talking about eight
to 10 vehicles that are all burnt.''
   The highway was littered with wreckage until late afternoon, said
State Police Sgt. Ron Haring. He said authorities were not sure how
the accidents developed.
   ``There may have been a car that went out of control,'' Haring
said.
   ``I believe there were a couple of semis involved. How it went
down exactly I don't know yet,'' Culp said. ``It was extremely foggy
at the time.''
   Gerald Sappenfield, chief of the Ogden-Royal Fire Protection
District, said cars at the scene were ``just sandwiched one on top
of the other.''
   ``It looked like it was straight out of the movies _ one of them
you see about multi-car accidents out in California,'' Sappenfield
said. ``They just kept running underneath each other and piling into
the car that was in front of them.''
   Seven accident victims were admitted at area hospitals, spokesmen
said, adding all were in fair or stable condition. Eleven other
people were treated and released, they said.
   In Florida, 19 vehicles piled into each other on a foggy stretch
of Interstate 95 near Cocoa Beach.
   Northbound lanes of the highway near the accidents remained
closed for more than two hours after the 8:30 a.m. chain-reaction
collision involving a tractor-trailer rig and 18 other vehicles, a
Florida Highway Patrol spokeswoman said.
   An earlier pileup on the same stretch of the interstate had been
cleared before the 19-vehicle accident, police said.
   Police said an unspecified number of motorists were injured in
the accidents, but no deaths were reported.

   The heir to Iran's defunct throne said that if
Iranian terrorists were responsible for last week's bombing of Pan
Am Flight 103 it would show the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini was
``frantic'' about opposition to his continued rule.
   Investigators probing the Pan Am wreckage in Scotland have
concluded that a bomb caused the Dec. 21 crash, but they have
reported no evidence that Iran was involved.
   Reza Pahlavi, the oldest son of the late Shah of Iran, issued a
statement Friday after several news organizations in London received
anonymous telephone demands that the United States deport him or
risk another terrorist bombing like the one that destroyed the Pan
Am jet. All 259 people aboard the plane were killed.
   The caller claimed to represent a terror group known as Guardians
of the Islamic Revolution, which, in similar calls last week, took
responsibility for the air disaster over Scotland.
   ``If this is true, it is clearly a fresh indication that
Khomeini's terrorist agents are still hard at work around the
globe,'' Pahlavi said.

   Parliament approved a historic free-trade
agreement between the United States and Canada, clearing the last
legal hurdle for the pact between the world's largest trading
partners to begin at midnight tonight.
   The Senate vote on Friday ended three years of often heated
debate. President Reagan and Prime Minister Brian Mulroney signed
the treaty last Jan. 2, but the pact required Canadian legislative
approval.
   In between, the free-trade issue became the focal point of the
national elections, won on Nov. 21 by Mulroney's Progressive
Conservatives. Opponents claimed the agreement would cost Canadians
their jobs and make them an economic underling to their financially
stronger southern neighbor.
   Others claimed the pact would ultimately cost them their economic
freedom.
   ``Even though we intend to acquiesce and the bill will become
law, our concerns have not disappeared,'' Allan MacEachen, the
Liberals' leader in the Senate, said during the debate. ``The
government has chosen the hard discpline of the market. We will have
to monitor whether the market does its job.''

   A record of malpractice suits and disciplinary
actions taken against doctors and dentists will follow them from
state to state as part of a new national computer data bank being
set up by the federal government.
   ``No longer will incompetent health professionals be enabled to
move from hospital to hospital or from state to state while
withholding adverse information,'' Dr. Otis R. Bowen, secretary of
the Department of Health and Human Services, said Friday.
   His remarks came at a news conference announcing the award of a
five-year, $15.9 million contract to the Unisys Corp. to operate the
computer bank ordered by Congress in 1986.
   The system is expected to be up and running by mid-summer, said
Bowen, but it will not contain files of actions taken against health
care providers prior to its start.

   Sculptor Isamu Noguchi, whose work bridged East
and West and included delicate paper lamps, massive boulderlike
sculptures and serene gardens, has died at age 84.
   Noguchi, the son of a Japanese poet and an American writer, died
early Friday at New York University Medical Center of heart failure.
   ``He was a paramount and essential figure in the evolution of
20th-century sculpture,'' said Martin Friedman, director of the
Walker Art Center in Minneapolis. ``He was a person of incredible
vitality and restless curiosity, constantly seeking to generate new
projects and ideas.''
   Noguchi caught a bad cold in Italy early this month and suffered
complications, said Allen Wardwell, director of the Isamu Noguchi
Garden Museum in New York, which opened in 1984 and where the artist
maintained a studio.

   Investigators believe the bomb that destroyed a Pan
Am jumbo jet was smuggled onto the flight in Frankfurt, possibly by
a Lebanese student duped into carrying it, British newspapers
reported Saturday.
   The father of 21-year-old student Khalid Jaafar said FBI agents
in Michigan questioned him Friday about reports his son, who died in
the explosion, unwittingly carried the bomb that destroyed Pan Am
Flight 103.
   Nazir Jaafar of Dearborn, Mich., said the FBI told him ``they
have no evidence against my son. They didn't have any indication he
was involved.''
   The Times of London reported that sophisticated explosive
equipment similar to that believed used in the bombing was found

   Air travelers worldwide welcomed
stringent security checks imposed after the bombing of Pan Am Flight
103 and took a ``better safe than sorry'' attitude Saturday when
faced with brief delays resulting from extra precautions.
   Some even complained that security wasn't strict enough, while
others boarded with a more fateful attitude _ that no matter how
tight security is, it can't always prevent a terrorist attack.
   Light traffic was reported at most airports New Year's Eve, and
few complaints about inconvenience were heard by airport workers
ordered to carefully check all luggage and passengers.
   Closer security checks were ordered at airports around the world
in response to the Dec. 21 bombing of Pan Am Flight 103, which
killed all 259 people on the jet and left about 11 people on the
ground in Lockerbie, Scotland missing and presumed dead.

   President Reagan and President-elect Bush will
likely fight having to testify in Oliver North's defense by using a
separation-of-powers argument and by contending that their testimony
is not relevant, sources said Saturday.
   Bush's legal counsel, Boyden Gray, said he expects motions to
quash North's subpoenas will be filed soon, with legal briefs
stressing the separation-of-powers issue and the precedent that no
U.S. president has ever been required to take the stand in court.
   ``I think that's going to happen,'' he said when asked if the
White House would fight the subpoenas that were delivered to the
Justice Department on Friday.
   He said the issues of executive privilege and protection of
classified materials would be part of the arguments if the decision
for a motion to quash is made. Much of the information in the case
involves national security matters, and the government's desire to
protect that is seen as a plus for North's case.

   Ringing in the new year are dozens of changes
in federal laws and regulations, many of them aimed at quenching
Americans' thirst for security and a few that will make life a
little more expensive.
   Among the most significant of the Jan. 1 changes are a vast
expansion of Medicare to cover catastrophic illnesses, faster
pension fund vesting that will benefit millions, particularly women,
and tax changes reducing the government's subsidizing of purchases
on credit.
   Others occurring slightly before the end of 1988 or scheduled
early in 1989 include a ban on lie detector tests by private
employers, 60 days advance notice of plant closings and large
layoffs and a new law prohibiting landlords from discriminating
against the handicapped and families with children.

   The 101st Congress opens for business this week
with majority Democrats pledging cooperation with President-elect
Bush while insisting he take the politically risky first steps on
budget cuts and other contentious issues.
   The first, largely symbolic sign of accommodation will come
shortly after lawmakers are sworn in on Tuesday when incoming Senate
Majority Leader George Mitchell of Maine clears the way for
committees to begin confirmation hearings on the Republican Cabinet
appointees before inauguration day on Jan. 20.
   The fireworks won't be long in erupting. President Reagan is
expected to propose a congressional pay raise of as much as $45,000
annually a few days after Congress formally convenes.
   The partisan wrangling will come later, as the Democratic
majorities in the House and Senate and the new Republican president
tackle the deficit and legislation dealing with the Pentagon's
purchasing system, minimum wage, clean air, health care, and ethics.

   The dream of overthrowing Fidel Castro remains alive
for many Cuban exiles here even as the Communist leader Sunday marks
the 30th anniversary of his takeover of the island 90 miles south of
Florida.
   But the strategies for dumping Castro have been changing for all
but a few diehards since the early years of invasion plots hatched
in Miami restaurants and guerrilla training in the Everglades.
   Many Cubans interviewed here in recent weeks see their role as
lobbying U.S. politicians to keep up the pressure on Castro and, if
his Communist rule ends, helping reconstruct post-Castro Cuba
without actually moving there.
   ``The Cuban community is more pluralistic today,'' said Jaime
Suchlicki, Cuban-born University of Miami director of Interamerican
Studies. ``Some people want relations, some people don't. Some
people want visas to travel there, some people want no travel there.

   Advocates of the Canada-U.S. free trade agreement
taking effect Sunday believe the pact will bring major benefits and
eventual changes to both countries.
   But Canadian critics, who almost succeeded in scuttling the deal,
remain just as convinced that arguments over it will last as long as
the agreement.
   Squabbling over the agreement continued as the Senate on Friday
passed the legislation removing the last remaining trade barriers
between the two nations. The pact was approved by the House of
Commons on Dec. 24.
   Prime Minister Brian Mulroney believes the pact, ardently
supported by Canadian business looking to the larger export market,
will produce a net increase of about 250,000 jobs in Canada in the
next 10 years.

   When the Black Widow went down in a sheet of
flame, luck was riding along.
   That's the consensus at a Strategic Air Command base in northern
Michigan, where base personnel have survived two fiery plane crashes
in three months.
   ``They're saying God's area code is 906,'' said Terry Prout, a
civilian who manages the airfield at the K.I. Sawyer Air Force Base.
   Black Widow was the nickname of the B-52H Stratofortress bomber
that crashed Dec. 6 on Sawyer's main runway. The plane, the
military's largest bomber, is designed to carry nuclear bombs, but
the Air Force said no weapons were aboard.
   All eight Sawyer airmen survived the explosive crash, though six
remain hospitalized with broken bones and related injuries.
   On Oct. 11 at a sister SAC base, Wurtsmith, in Michigan's
northern Lower Peninsula, a KC-135 Stratotanker refueling plane
crashed, killing six crewmembers based there. But 10 others aboard,
all from Sawyer, escaped from the burning wreckage.
   ``For all 10 (from Sawyer) to survive Wurtsmith, and for all to
survive here, somebody's looking out for us,'' Prout said.
   Although, in the words of Col. Eldon Joersz, commander of the
410th Bombardment Wing at Sawyer, the base ``pressed on without a
hiccup,'' the crashes affected everyone. ``It's a very personal
thing,'' he said.
   On a snowy afternoon at Sawyer recently, six men being briefed
for a B-52 flight were headed out for a routine two-hour mission.
But what about the crash just a few weeks before?
   Lt. Col. Gordon Platt shrugged in his heavy flight jacket.
   ``The best thing to do is to get back up in the air,'' he said.
Otherwise, ``it's hard to get your feelings squared away.''
   Personally, the flight crew leader was unconcerned.
   ``I like to be flying again. Part of our job is to fly,'' he said.
   Over and over, people at the base repeat that philosophy.
   ``If they were scared, they're certainly not showing it. There's
an importance of getting back into the saddle,'' Prout said from his
office in the control tower.
   Master Sgt. David Derouin agreed. The airfield manager has seen
many crashes in 17 years with the Air Force. He said the B-52 crash
was the worst.
   It occurred at 1:15 a.m. as a flight crew came back from a
seven-hour mission that had taken them west, most likely through
Montana, Wyoming or the Dakotas, and back to their home base by Lake
Superior. They practiced touch-and-go landings before calling it a
night.
   As the 160-foot Stratofortress swooped into the air, it exploded.
Witnesses say the B-52 burst into flames and broke apart about 50
feet off the ground.
   Any higher, the fall to the runway would have killed the
crewmembers, Derouin said. Any lower, the explosion would have
crushed them, he said.
   He was at the scene within 20 minutes, as crew members still were
being pulled from the wreckage. The B-52 was scattered along
thousands of feet of runway. Much of it was burning.
   ``That surprised me, that they were alive,'' Derouin said.
   The Air Force listed the value of the plane at $54.1 million.
``My first comment was, `Everyone was alive, so that airplane means
nothing,''' Derouin said.
   Those who saw the crash say it was preceded by a brilliant flash
of light, then the blast from the explosion, before the bomber
dropped to earth.
   ``They said it was a large plume of flame moving down the
runway,'' Derouin said.
   The crash sent waves throughout the Strategic Air Command, which
keeps the bombers on alert to respond to any nuclear attack.
   SAC officials temporarily grounded the nation's B-52 fleet of
about 250 planes, for extensive fuel system checks. Sawyer's wing
remained idle for nine days while military investigators poked
through the charred wreckage scattered on the runway.
   There is no official word on the cause of the crash, but Sawyer's
B-52 flight crews have been ordered to watch for overheating fuel
pumps.
   Undamaged is the confidence among Sawyer pilots in the B-52, even
though the 26-year-old plane is older than many of those aboard.
   ``I enjoy flying the B-52. It's a venerable old lady,'' said Lt.
Col. John Walther, the assistant deputy commander of operations at
Sawyer, as he sat in his flight suit, ready to go out.
   But he, too, saw the wreckage, and knew the people who had been
aboard. ``I couldn't believe anyone lived,'' Walther said. ``I
realized we, in fact, had a miracle.''

<HEAD>Surprising Finds in `Dinosaur Hunt' on PBS</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KATHRYN BAKER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>

   Dinosaurs are a kiddie rage these days. There are
dinosaur toys, books, T-shirts, games, party favors.
   ``The Great Dinosaur Hunt,'' tonight on PBS' ``The Infinite
Voyage'' and next week in syndication, is not a kids' show, though
some dinosaur-crazy youngsters might find it interesting.
   This fascinating documentary is taken up not with childish
fantasies, but more adult considerations, such as the history of
dinosaur study and present-day scientific methods that have produced
remarkable new theories about the ex-critters.
   The new theories, rather than drying out the subject, give new
life to the dinosaurs of childhood imagination. According to various
scientists, the vast array of dinosaur species were active hunters,
aggressive fighters, nurturing mothers, sociable herd members,
scavengers and sophisticated communicators.
   ``Nature's special effects,'' they are called, by museum curator
Robert Bakker, a Harvard Ph.D. scientist and author of ``The
Dinosaur Heresies,'' whose waist-length hair and a beard symbolize
his maverick ideas. Bakker believes that, contrary to long-held
popular and scientific belief, dinosaurs were not stupid,
cold-blooded reptiles, but a unique, warm-blooded, active animal.
   Bakker supported his theory by studying dinosaur tracks
discovered in a riverbed near Glen Rose, Texas. By comparing the
estimated height of the animal's leg with the distance between the
tracks, Bakker concluded that it traveled at a brisk 8 mph or so,
faster than a pack of wolves, not at the sluggish speed of a
cold-blooded reptile lazily foraging for food.
   ``Their world was not one of the cold-blooded shuffle, but of the
hot-blooded cruise,'' he says.
   Phillip Currie studied mysterious ``bone beds'' in Alberta,
Canada, and developed the theory that they were the remains of
members of a dinosaur herd who died trying to ford a river en masse,
as herding animals still sometimes do today. Later, another species
of dinosaur fed on the remains _ Currie found bite marks on the
bones _ and added more fossils to the bone beds.
   Paleontologist Jack Horner's study of dinosaur eggs revealed that
some species emerged fully developed and ready to run off in search
of food, while others needed lengthy nurturing in the nest. They
later became predator and prey.
   David Weishampel studied the unexplained hollow crest that topped
the heads of some dinosaur species and concluded that it provided an
amplification tunnel between vocal box and snout. By reconstructing
the crest with plastic tubing, he produces a low-frequency bellow
that the animals probably used more than 70 million years ago to
communicate with each other. A low-frequency noise, not unlike the
bellow of an elephant, would have carried a long distance, but been
difficult for a predator, such as Tyrannosaurus rex, to locate.
   Bakker believes that rather than dying out completely, dinosaurs
were the predecessors of today's 8,400 species of birds. By studying
a species of dinosaur closely related to ``T. Rex,'' as he
affectionately calls the mega-lizard, Bakker concluded that the
structural similarities between dinosaurs and modern birds made them
obvious relatives.
   ``So when you look at your canary, you're seeing a bit of T.
Rex,'' Bakker says.
   The demise of the dinosaurs remains a mystery. They could have
died of a widespread virus, or they might have been the victims of a
sudden cataclysm, such as a collision between Earth and a giant
meteor.
   Evolutionary biologist Stephen Jay Gould of Harvard University
says the dinosaurs ruled the Earth for 140 million years while
mammals were small creatures that occupied the nooks and crannies of
their world. So there's no reason that they might not have continued
their reign another 60 million years, leaving mammals to be inferior
and dominated.
   Lest we look back with pity on the poor, long-dead dinosaur,
Gould cheerfully points out, ``All species eventually become
extinct.''

   For stock market investors, 1988 was a sort of
scavenger hunt.
   Traditional investment profits were harder to come by during the
year than they had been all through the great bull market of 1982-87.
   But picking among the debris left by the crash the previous
October, traders were able to find some profitable bargains.
   To no one's surprise, the list of the year's biggest winners is
dominated by stocks that attracted takeover and buyout bids.
   For example, Borman's, the Detroit supermarket chain that caught
the fancy of the Great Alantic & Pacific Tea Co., tripled in price.
   RJR Nabisco, subject of the biggest bidding competition ever in
this country, doubled from $45 at yearend 1987 to around $90 in the
waning days of 1988 as the buyout firm of Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &
Co. prepared to take the company over.
   Pennwalt, Holly Farms and Del Webb Corp. chalked up gains ranging
from 103 to 133 percent.
   And any compilation of winners from the list of stocks that are
still trading does not show issues of companies swallowed up before
yearend, such as Kraft and Federated Department Stores.
   Takeover news and speculation helped the overall market finish
the year sporting some respectable numbers.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, after slipping 0.36 to
2,168.57 in the past week, closed out 1988 with a net gain of 229.74
points, or 11.85 percent.
   That marked the first time the average finished a year above
2,000, although it remains far below its Aug. 25, 1987 reading of
2,722.42.
   Other readings for the week showed the New York Stock Exchange
composite index up .20 at 156.26; the NASDAQ composite index for the
over-the-counter market up 4.04 at 381.38, and the American Stock
Exchange market value index up 3.79 at 306.01.
   Volume on the Big Board averaged 114.15 million shares a day,
against 140.57 million the week before.
   The Dow's 1988 rise qualified as ``above average,'' since it
topped the long-term standard benchmark of 9 percent a year. But
that showing failed to inspire many investors who had been scared
off by the crash.
   For the first time since 1977, trading volume declined in all the
major markets.
   On the NYSE, activity was off nearly 15 percent from its record
pace in 1987. At the Amex, the decline was about 29 percent.
   That went a long way toward explaining the lack of enthusiasm
most brokers felt about the market's performance.
   ``For the vast majority of us in the investment business, 1988
has been far from `above average,''' said Edward Nicoski at Piper,
Jaffray & Hopwood in Minneapolis.
   The financial community, which has endured periodic bouts of
layoffs ever since the crash, is braced for more job losses if
business doesn't pick up early in 1989.
   The yearend forecasts of several leading brokerage houses lack
their usual upbeat sparkle, focusing on prospective ``trading
ranges'' for stock prices and slower growth in the economy and
corporate earnings.
   It doesn't help Wall Street's morale much that in the Tokyo stock
market the bulls are still thriving. Japan's Nikkei index climbed 42
percent over the year, passing a milestone at 30,000 and closing at
a new peak of 30,159.00.
   Still, amid the gloom in the U.S. markets, some analysts see
opportunities for a pleasant surprise.
   ``As long as investors are nervous, expect higher prices,''
declares Norman Fosback, editor of several investment advisory
letters published in Fort Lauderdale, Fla.
   ``Here's why: When investors are rampantly bullish, everyone is
most likely to have bought, and with buying power exhausted, stock
prices have nowhere to go but down. But when everyone is nervous and
afraid to buy, buying power builds by the day.''
   ``Stocks are on the soundest fundamental footing in several
years,'' Fosback concludes. He recommends ``buying and owning stocks
to profit from the bull market rally that is still to come.''
