<HEAD>'60s Drug Guru Timothy Leary to Have Head Frozen After Death</HEAD>

   Sixties drug guru Timothy Leary said he's
signed up to have his head removed and frozen after he dies for
possible resurrection, but he admits the technology is ``a long
shot.''
   ``I don't want to just go belly-up when my Blue Cross runs
out,'' said the 67-year-old former Harvard psychology professor who
once advised the youth of America to ``tune in, turn on and drop
out'' with mind-altering drugs.
   Leary said Thursday he's formalizing a $35,000 agreement to have
his head preserved for posterity in so-called ``cryonic
suspension'' by the Alcor Life Extension Foundation in Riverside.
   ``It's the second dumbest idea in the world,'' Leary said of
cryonics, the practice of freezing the recently dead. ``The first
is that you go to the worms. It's a long shot but it's worth a
try.''
   Alcor is best known for a long-running battle with authorities
about whether an elderly woman client was actually dead when her
head was surgically severed and immersed in liquid nitrogen. A
judge backed Alcor in its refusal to turn in the head for tests,
and the matter remains at a standoff.
   Leary, who recently has been appearing at colleges and
nightclubs after years of relative obscurity, said he has followed
developments in cryonics since 1976, when he wrote a paper on 22
alternatives to ``involuntary, irreversible death.''
   ``He's been interested the last 30 years in any cutting edge
technology,'' explained his agent, Eric Gardner. ``And this, if
you'll pardon the expression, is cutting edge technology.''
   For his $35,000, Leary, who says he is perfecly healthy, would
become a member of the non-profit Alcor foundation. That gives him
the right to have his head surgically removed after death and
immersed in liquid nitrogen at minus 320 degrees Fahrenheit.
   Alcor also freezes entire bodies, but Leary said he couldn't
afford the $100,000 price.
   Mainstream scientists scoff at cryonics, but adherents believe
the essence of a person's mental or spiritual being resides
physically in the brain. That essence could someday be transferred
to a mechanically produced or biologically cloned body, said
Alcor's president, Carlos Mondragon.
   ``There's about as good a chance that they'll be able to bring
you back in 50 years than there is that we'll get a good president
of the United States, or that they'll find a cure for the common
cold,'' Leary said.
   Leary doesn't think his much-publicized drug use ruined his
brain for revival, but is prepared: ``I'd be very happy, if they
don't bring me back, to have it turned over to the neurologists.''
   Alcor has six heads and two complete bodies frozen in concrete
vats of liquid nitrogen, Mondragon said. He said 109 members signed
up to be suspended after they die. The controversy over the head of
85-year-old Dora Kent boosted interest in membership and Leary's
endorsement may do the same, said Mondragon. ``A lot of people may
have negative reactions to Dr. Leary, but people without open minds
don't generally come to us anyway,'' said Mondragon.

<HEAD>Allis-Chalmers Agrees to Pay $4.5 Million Penalty For Pollution</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Allis-Chalmers Corp. has agreed to pay the
federal government $4.5 million to clean up 13 hazardous waste
sites in seven states, the Justice Department announced Friday.
   The payment agreement was filed in New York City, where
Allis-Chalmers, a Milwaukee-based farm equipment manufacturer, is
reorganizing under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code in U.S.
Bankruptcy Court in New York. The $4.5 million payment is subject
to approval by the federal court.
   The agreement was the result of the Justice Department's program
to make sure certain environmental cleanup issues are addressed
when companies reorganize under federal bankruptcy law, said
Assistant Attorney General Roger J. Marzulla of the Land and
Natural Resources Division.
   Marzulla said the firm pledged to pay the government regardless
of other obligations under the reorganization proceedings.
   The $4.5 million will be distributed to the following sites:
Maxey Flats Nuclear Disposal Site, Morehead, Ky., $325,000; Bluff
Road Landfill, Columbia, S.C., $15,000; Peak Oil, Tampa, Fla.,
$25,000; Conservation Chemical Co. landfill site, Gary Ind.,
$40,000; Northside Sanitary landfill-Envirochem, Zionsville, Ind.,
$30,000; Schmalz Dump Site, Harrison, Wis., $2 million; Ninth
Avenue Dump Site, Gary, Ind., $625,000; Muskego Sanitary Landfill,
Muskego, Wis., $375,000; Brookfield Sanitary landfill (Loth
Disposal Site), Brookfield, Wis., $125,000; Lenz Oil, Lemont, Ill.,
$295,000; U.S. Scrap, Chicago, $625,000; Interstate Transformer,
Ellwood, Pa., $10,000; and Lee's Lane Landfill, Louisville, Ky,
$10,000.

   Near the end of two days of scholarly talk
about the ramifications of allowing intentionally aborted fetuses
to be used for medical research, a National Institutes of Health
advisory committee member sharpened the issue with a simple
question:
   Will there ever be a medical benefit ``great enough'' for
anti-abortionists to drop their opposition to using tissue from
induced abortions?
   ``No,'' Kay James, public affairs director of the National Right
to Life Committee, told Joseph B. Martin, chief of neurology at
Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston.
   `No,'' said Judi Brown of Stafford, Va., president of the
American Life League.
   A few minutes earlier, Robin Chandler Duke, co-chairwoman of the
Population Crisis Committee based in New York City, had
acknowledged the strong opposition of anti-abortionists and said
she wished there was some way to reach accommodation over the
transplant issue.
   ``But to hold a nation hostage to a minority group who are
opposed to abortion is a tragedy,'' she said. ``They must know that
even if it (abortion) became illegal, it would still be done. It's
just not going to go away. It has been with us since the written
word.''
   Another member of the panel of witnesses, Sam Gorovitz, dean of
the college of arts and sciences at Syracuse University, told
Martin he empathized with his effort to find common ground but
suggested the ``intractable polarity'' of positions just outlined
by his fellow panelists showed that would be impossible.
   In the end, Gorovitz predicted, the special advisory committee
will simply have to settle on ``the position for which the
arguments are best,'' with the realization that one group or the
other will be unhappy.
   ``There is no way out of that,'' Gorovitz said.
   Retired federal appeals court judge Arlin M. Adams of
Philadelphia, the advisory committee chairman, broke the 21-member
committee into smaller groups for informal discussions Thursday
night and again today.
   He planned to bring them together late today in hopes they could
reach consensus on whether to recommend federal approval of using
fetal tissue from induced abortions for research and, if so, what
guidelines to recommend to guard against abuses.
   Adams said he hoped the committee could agree enough by the end
of the day to allow a rough draft of a document that would be
circulated for further discussion with an eye toward having a
formal recommendation ready in time for presentation Dec. 1 to a
standing NIH committee.
   Father Don McCarthy, a Roman Catholic church leader from
Cincinnati, drew a clear distinction between induced abortions and
natural abortions in expressing his opposition to using tissue from
the former.
   ``One might say that the American public becomes accomplices
after the fact for these induced abortions'' if its institutions
embrace policies that could tend to give a medical value to having
an abortion, he said.
   Several committee members used the term ``custom pregnancy'' as
a short way of raising the concern that some woman might become
pregnant just to produce an aborted fetus for research _ either for
financial gain or in an effort to help a sick relative.
   ``I don't think people are as callous about abortion as that
premise suggests,'' said Thomas H. Murray, director of the Center
for Biomedical Ethics at Case Western Reserve University. ``If we
get to that point, I'm deeply worried.''
   Murray said he was convinced that guidelines could be drawn to
ensure that a woman's decision to have an abortion would be kept
totally separate from the decision to allow the remains to be used
for research.
   Robert J. Levine of the Yale University School of Medicine told
the committee his institution has drawn its own guidelines that
would exclude transplanting the tissue of a fetus into a relative
of the mother.
   He said that was done out of safety considerations _ that
whatever caused the disease in the relative might somehow be
present in the offspring's genes _ but coincidentally also serves
to negate concern about ``custom pregnancies.''

<HEAD>EPA Says Emission Controls May Be Better Than Planned</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Environmental Protection Agency says
regulations to control the volatility of gasoline and the recovery
of gasoline fumes could be twice as effective as originally
expected.
   As a result, cities close to complying with federal clean air
standards will get a greater than expected reduction in ozone when
EPA adopts the new rules.
   Implementation of the regulations had been expected to help
anti-pollution efforts, but EPA Administrator Lee M. Thomas said
Thursday the benefit would be much greater than previously believed.
   Earlier EPA calculations had indicated the gasoline regulations
would reduce the emission of urban hydrocarbons to the atmosphere
by 10 percent to 15 percent, Thomas said.
   ``It could be as much as twice that,'' Thomas said.
   Some cities are so close to complying with the standard that
they had been expected to come into compliance simply through the
retirement of older, more-polluting vehicles. Thomas said he did
not know how many cities would benefit from the new findings.
   But those helped the most will be areas where peak readings of
ozone are ``in the 0.14 (parts per million) range'' and below, he
said. Some cities may find that measures such as pollution
inspections of cars will be unnecessary.
   There are 38 cities with peak readings of 0.14 ppm or below on
EPA's list of the 68 urban and rural areas that have failed to meet
the nation's ozone standard.
   Gasoline fumes react in sunlight with nitrogen oxides from all
fuel combustion to produce ozone, which is harmful to the lungs.
Ozone is the constituent of urban smog that makes the chest feel
tight.
   The federal standard calls for limiting peak ozone to 0.12 parts
per million and limiting excursions above that to no more than one
hour per year.
   Gasoline vapor emissions to the atmosphere will be reduced more
than expected because the planned regulations will sharply reduce
what analysts call ``running losses,'' or the evaporation of
gasoline from the tank and other fuel system components while the
car is moving.
   Current cars must meet strict standards for emission of unburned
gasoline vapor out the tailpipe and for evaporation.
   Evaporation is controlled by a vapor recovery system which
stores gasoline vapor in a cannister of activated charcoal until
they can be recycled to the tank. It is tested by collecting vapor
emitted when a car is stationary, and for this, the agency uses a
test fuel whose volatility has remained unchanged since 1975.
   Actual volatility has increased sharply since then, and on hot
days it can overwhelm the cannister.
   In such circumstances, the car can emit to the atmosphere 25
times more gasoline vapor than is permitted out the exhaust.
   The volatility standard will reduce these emissions and the
vapor recovery regulation will ensure that more of them are
captured, agency officials say. The EPA says this would remove a
large source of urban ozone that the agency had not known was there.

<TEXT>
   Boston University rejected student protests and
issued strict new rules prohibiting students from having overnight
guests of the opposite sex and reducing the amount of alcohol in
dormitories.
   The rules were released Thursday, a day after 2,000 students
converged on campus for a three-hour demonstration against the
visitation policy.
   ``All of life after 11 p.m. has been banned at BU,'' Jamie
Sanbonmatsu, a senior at the College of Liberal Arts, told the
crowd. ``The administration is stunting our growth and development
by denying us the right to make decisions.''
   Under the new guidelines, some of which go into effect in late
fall and others during spring, guests must display identification
cards and leave the dormitory by 11 p.m. on weekdays and 1 a.m. on
weekends.
   Overnight stays by members of the same sex will be allowed if
roommates agree. But members of the opposite sex will not be
allowed overnight.
   The amount of alcohol allowed into the dorms will be limited to
a six-pack of beer and a liter of other alcoholic beverages for
students over age 21.
   Kevin Carleton, a university spokesman, said Wednesday's protest
did not faze BU officials.
   ``I don't think any demonstration would have an effect,'' said
Carleton. ``What can have an effect is a reasonable discussion.''
   Officials said they based their decision on ``concerns stated by
students, staff and parents that residences too often have failed
to provide the kind of environment where an individual can quietly
study and have his or her right to privacy respected.''
   BU officials cited problems such as parties, late-night group
study and peer pressure to put up with overnight guests. There are
8,700 students housed in university residence halls.
   Parietal rules were dropped by many American colleges and
universities, including BU, in the 1960s and '70s.

<HEAD>Engines Test OK From Delta Crash; More Scrutiny of Possible Pilot
Error</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By H. JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal investigators say the engines from the
Delta Air Lines jetliner that crashed last month in Texas show no
evidence of mechanical failure _ a finding that is focusing more
attention on possible pilot error.
   The National Transportation Safety Board said Thursday the
evidence shows ``that all engines (on the plane) were running as
commanded and capable of producing full power at the time of
impact.''
   Early speculation after the Aug. 31 crash at Dallas-Fort Worth
International Airport, in which 14 of 108 people aboard Delta
Flight 1141 died, was possible engine failure because witnesses
reported fire coming from an engine.
   The cockpit voice recorder tape also included a reference by a
crew member to ``engine failure'' seconds before the crash.
   But the NTSB said that after the three Pratt & Whitney JT8D
engines were disassembled at the manufacturer's facilities in
Connecticut ``there was no evidence of pre-impact failure'' in any
of the engines.
   The findings also seemed to rule out the possibility that an
object or bird was sucked into an engine since that would have
caused damage or been determined when the engines were disassembled.
   While the safety board is continuing to examine the possibility
that there was a compressor stall because of improper air flow
through an engine, investigators believe that would have to have
been caused by some other irregularity.
   Proper air flow can be disrupted through an engine if a plane is
in an unusual angle that restricts the flow of air across the wings
or fuselage, according to aviation experts.
   Investigators have said the cockpit voice recorder tape includes
at least five noises that could be engine compressor stalls, but
all of them occur after the plane already was having serious
problems remaining aloft.
   The engine findings, according to one source close to the
investigation, have caused investigators to focus more closely on
the possibility that an error by the pilots _ such as improperly
configuring the aircraft for takeoff _ was the cause of the crash.
   Investigators, for example, have been puzzled by conflicting
evidence as to the setting of the plane's wing flaps. According to
the recording of cockpit conversation, the co-pilot acknowledged
during the preflight checklist that the flaps had been set at the
proper 15 degree extension.
   But investigators found that the flaps, which help provide more
lift for takeoff, were almost completely retracted and that the
flaps lever in the cockpit was in the retracted position. Further
tests may show whether the crash impact might have contributed to
the positioning of both the flaps and the lever or whether a
mechanical failure caused the flaps not to slide into proper
position.
   Meanwhile, the cockpit crew members, all three of whom survived
the crash, have yet to provide information that might shed light on
the cause of the accident.
   Earlier this week, Capt. Larry Davis, who was at the controls
during the takeoff, told investigators he recalls one of the other
pilots stating the flaps were properly extended, but doesn't recall
checking the flap indicators to verify if they indeed had been set.
   He said he recalls two ``loud bangs or explosions'' _ possibly
engine compressor stalls caused by improper air flow _ seconds
after liftoff and that the plane began to roll, according to NTSB
officials.
   The co-pilot, Carey W. Kirkland, has told investigators he
doesn't remember anything after the aircraft left the gate, while
the flight engineer, Steven Judd, gave only sketchy information.

<HEAD>Ford Says War Powers Provisions Alterned None Of His Decisions</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Former President Gerald R. Ford says the legal
restrictions of the controversial War Powers Act never caused him
to change any of the decisions he made during his presidency.
   ``I did what I felt had to be done,'' the former president told
a Senate subcommittee.
   Ford's comment came Thursday in response to a question from Sen.
Larry Pressler, R-S.D., about whether any of Ford's national
security decisions were affected by the executive branch
restrictions contained in the 1973 law.
   Ford is a strong opponent of the law, as have been all
presidents since the measure was enacted over President Nixon's
veto. The law was a congressional attempt to check some of the
power which legislators felt had greatly deepened the American role
in the Vietnam War.
   The law directs the White House to send Congress a report within
48 hours after U.S. military personnel are sent to areas of
imminent hostilities. Those forces must then be withdrawn within 60
days, or in some cases 90 days, unless Congress votes to allow them
to remain.
   Ford told the Foreign Relations subcommittee set up to study the
War Powers Act that he and his successors sent 19 reports to
Congress under the law, although the documents weren't submitted
under provisions of the act that could trigger the 60-day
withdrawal period.
   He added, ``in the 15 years of the War Powers Resolution, it's
never been implemented, never. ... It's a dormant piece of
legislation. It ought to be repealed.''
   But Ford added that ``I'm practical, I don't think it will be
(repealed). I support the kind of amendments'' proposed in a reform
backed by leaders of both parties.
   The changes would eliminate the 60- or 90-day automatic
withdrawal period and would replace the reporting requirement with
a requirement that a president consult with House and Senate
leaders about major national security decisions.
   The latest War Powers fights have centered on President Reagan's
policy of protecting reflagged Kuwaiti tankers in the Persian Gulf.
   Reagan has refused to invoke the law. There have been seven
votes in Congress on attempts to force the administration to comply
with the law, but all have failed.
   Abraham D. Sofaer, the State Department legal adviser, also
argued that the law is unconstitutional.
   ``It incoporates a view of the relative powers of the political
branches of our government, and of their proper roles, that is at
odds with the Constitution's scheme and with over 200 years of
relatively consistent experience,'' Sofaer said.
   Sofaer also objected to the 60-day restriction because ``the
imposition of arbitrary and inflexible deadlines interferes with
the effective and successful completion of the initiative
undertaken by the president.''
   ``Such limits may signal a divided nation, giving our
adversaries a basis for hoping that the president may be forced to
desist, or at least feel pressured to do so,'' he explained.

   Michael K. Deaver had been drinking up to a
fifth of Scotch whisky a day when he first sought treatment for
alcoholism only several weeks after he left President Reagan's
staff, according to testimony.
   Deaver's wife, Carolyn, told a doctor that her husband drank
``bottles and bottles of wine'' the weekend before he was
hospitalized on June 3, 1985, for alcohol detoxification, Dr.
William Argy testified Thursday at a court hearing on the former
presidential aide's medical condition.
   Deaver is trying to get a lenient sentence for lying under oath
about his lobbying activities by presenting evidence that his
memory was impaired by alcoholism when he gave sworn testimony
before a grand jury and a House subcommittee in 1986.
   Argy said Deaver was drinking as much as a bottle of wine or a
pint of vodka a day when he was hospitalized in October 1986 for
detoxification.
   The former deputy White House chief of staff and longtime friend
of the Reagan family faces a possible five-year term and a $6,800
fine for each of three perjury convictions when he appears Sept. 23
for sentencing by U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson.
   Deaver was found guilty of two counts of lying by telling the
grand jury he couldn't recall contacting former Reagan
administration colleagues on behalf of high-paying lobbying
clients. The third conviction stemmed from his denial to the House
Energy and Commerce subcomittee that he helped a South Korean trade
envoy get an appointment to see the president.
   At Thursday's hearing, defense lawyer Randall J. Turk told
Jackson that evidence would show that Deaver was an alcoholic ``at
all times relevant to the case'' and therefore his memory was
impaired both during the events in question and when he was asked
about them under oath.
   But independent counsel Whitney North Seymour Jr. argued that
records of Deaver's hospitalization for alcoholism in June 1985 and
again in October 1986 show ``nothing to support any finding that
his memory was impaired.''
   ``Mr. Deaver's ability to recall was absolutely functioning, it
was just that he decided to select what he wanted to recall,''
Seymour argued.
   Medical experts for both the defense and prosecution were
expected to testify when the hearing resumed.
   A Roman Catholic priest who runs an alcoholism treatment center
in Havre de Grace, Md., where Deaver spent a month following his
second hospitalization said the former presidential aide complained
of memory blackouts when he was first admitted.
   Prosecutors showed the Rev. Joseph Martin a treatment notation
stating that during his stay Deaver ``enjoyed a nightly game of
Trivial Pursuits'' _ a game that challenges players' memory of
facts about popular culture and other subjects.
   ``Many of us have a little storehouse of useless information,
you can show it in a game like that,'' Martin said.
   Martin said Deaver came to realize that his drinking problem
occurred because he ``abused power and money.''
   Argy, who had earlier treated Deaver for kidney failure,
testified that the former presidential aide called him on May 30,
1985, to seek help with alcoholism. On June 3, 1985, Deaver was
admitted to Georgetown University Hospital for detoxification.
   The defense tried to use this testimony to show that Deaver was
not lying when he said he couldn't recall telephoning
then-Transportation Secretary Elizabeth Dole or White House aide
Rogert Porter from his hospital bed on behalf of Trans World
Airlines.
   The calls were made ``while he was going through acute alcohol
withdrawal and while he was sedated'' by tranquilizers, Turk argued.
   Argy said Deaver received between 120 and 140 milligrams of
Valium to counteract the effects of alcohol withdrawal during his
three-day hospital stay.
   But Seymour was able to show that Deaver did not receive any
Valium until 45 minutes after he had telephoned Mrs. Dole on June 3.
   According to Argy, Deaver was given his first tranquilizer _ a
25-milligram dose of Librium _ 45 minutes before the 5 p.m. call to
Dole, which was documented by a telephone log produced at the trial.
   The call to Porter was the next day.
   The medical testimony about Deaver's alcoholism was not offered
during the trial because defense lawyers rested their case without
calling any witnesses.

<HEAD>Handgun Legislation Dropped From Anti-Drug Bill</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Ignoring a lawmaker's plea to ``show how tough
we are'' by opposing the firearms lobby, the House has likely
killed for this year an attempt to force Americans to wait a week
before buying a handgun.
   By a 228-182 bipartisan vote Thursday, the House eliminated from
an anti-drug bill a seven-day waiting period along with an optional
police background check of the purchaser.
   The vote substituted a plan _ to be devised by the Justice
Department _ that would allow gun dealers to quickly identify
convicted felons seeking to buy pistols. Sponsor Bill McCollum,
R-Fla., said the amendment was his own idea and the major pro-gun
group, the National Rifle Assocation, came to him with its support.
   The waiting period language was named symbolically after
presidential press secretary James Brady, who was shot along with
President Reagan in the March 30, 1981, assassination attempt
against the president by John W. Hinckley Jr.
   Brady's wife, Sarah, vice chair of Handgun Control Inc., called
the vote ``disappointing and discouraging.'' She added, ``We came
close. Twenty-four more votes would have made a difference.''
   The NRA's chief political operative, Wayne LaPierre, predicted
that any attempt to resurrect the waiting period in the Senate this
year would fail because sentiment there was ``even stronger''
against the waiting period.
   To change the House result, 24 members would have to reverse
course _ a seemingly insurmountable number for such a politically
sensitive issue.
   The three-million-member NRA, which once faced little opposition
in its lobbying against gun control, was up against a formidable
foe this time: a coalition of gun control groups and law
enforcement organizations that was better organized than ever
before.
   Supporters of the waiting period believed they had a better
chance of winning their legislation by making it part of a popular
anti-drug bill near election time.
   But they guessed wrong, and the coalition's predictions of a
razor-close vote proved inaccurate. NRA supporters were able to
muster backing from 101 Democrats and 127 Republicans. Opposing
were 137 Democrats and 45 Republicans.
   The overall drug bill would add some $2 billion to the nation's
$3.9 billion drug fighting effort. A final House vote is expected
next week. The Senate still has to consider its own drug fighting
bill.
   In the closing moments of debate, waiting period supporter Rep.
William J. Hughes, D-N.J., urged members to ``show how tough we are
when it comes to bucking the National Rifle Association and the gun
lobby.''
   NRA backer Rep. Harold Volkmer, D-Mo., said after the vote that
those comments backfired.
   ``Taking on the NRA is one thing and taking on gun owners is
another,'' Volkmer said. ``There's no question the NRA had a lot to
do with it,'' he said, but attributed most of the substitute's
support to individual gun owners who contacted their lawmakers.
   Both sides brought police officers to Washington to lobby for
their positions.
   The McCollum amendment would order the Justice Department to
develop _ within 180 days _ a system that would allow gun dealers
to check whether the applicant is a convicted felon.
   McCollum has said the system, which would be submitted to
Congress, could include a telephone check such as the one that
stores use to verify that credit cards are valid.
   His language also requires that probation be revoked for anyone
found in possession of firearms.
   Dewey Stokes, president of the Fraternal Order of Police, said,
``I don't mind losing a fight when it's fair, but we were outgunned
on this, and by outgunned I mean dollar bills. It's a shame when
our congressmen have to listen to a single-shot issue group'' like
the NRA.
   Supporters of the waiting period had argued the device was
effective in the 22 states that had it, citing figures that
California screened out more than 1,500 ineligible gun applicants
in 1986; and New Jersey stopped an average of 500 felons each year
from buying guns.
   But Rep. Harley O. Staggers Jr., D-W.Va., said a National
Institute of Justice study ``says criminals actually avoid going
through legal channels'' to obtain guns. The institute is a Justice
Department research agency.

<HEAD>Administration Plans To Cut Security Force In Panama</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NORMAN BLACK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Military Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Reagan administration has decided to
gradually withdraw small numbers of the servicemen sent to Panama
last spring on temporary security duty, administration officials
say.
   The decision was made because a feared threat to U.S. bases in
Panama has not materialized, according to the sources, who spoke
Thursday on condition of anonymity.
   The sources said the move was recommended by Gen. Frederick F.
Woerner Jr., head of the U.S. Southern Command. It was blessed by
the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Defense Secretary Frank C. Carlucci and
the White House after a review that focused on ``political
sensitivities, not military requirements,'' the officials added.
   The sources declined to say exactly how many of the extra 2,200
security personnel sent to Panama since last spring would be
included in the first withdrawal. One source indicated the number
would be fewer than 500, while another official said about 200
would be involved.
   ``This is a sensitive thing, because our opposition to the
government of (strongman) Gen. Manuel A. Noriega hasn't changed and
we don't want this to be misinterpreted,'' said one official. ``But
there's no sense keeping extra soldiers in the country if you don't
need them.''
   Separately, State Department officials said Thursday the
administration has decided to reduce the size of its diplomatic
presence in Panama because of what one official called a
``potentially confrontational situation'' in that country.
   The extent of the diplomatic cutback was not immediately
determined, but one official said up to 160 jobs could be affected.
   Officials who disclosed the planned withdrawal of U.S. security
forces from Panama said the cutbacks will be carried out gradually.
   ``They will come out over a period of time,'' a source said.
``We don't want to fly in empty aircraft and load them up all at
once and have Noriega claiming he won.
   ``The situation has not improved, but these people aren't needed
for the mission they were sent in for.''
   Said another official: ``Most of these security personnel were
put on as guards at the military installations, and we haven't been
experiencing harassment in that area.
   ``We've been having problems with other things besides gate
security. So if you don't have enough for them to do, there's no
reason to extend their tour or to replace them with fresh units.''
   The sources said the decision to begin drawing down the extra
security personnel amounted to acknowledgement of a standoff with
Noriega that features harassment but no direct threat to U.S.
facilities.
   ``The Panamanian Defense Forces continue to hassle Americans
when they travel off-base, and we still have occasional intruders
at our (oil) tank farm,'' said one official. ``But the bases
themselves have really not been threatened.''
   The United States has been pressing economic sanctions against
Panama for months now in a bid to oust Noriega. The Panamanian
general has been indicted by two federal grand juries in Florida on
drug trafficking charges.
   Last March and April, citing growing ``instability in Panama and
the heavy-handed tactics of Noriega in dealing with the
situation,'' the Pentagon began sending Army, Marine and Air Force
military police and security specialists to the Central American
nation.
   Panama _ besides being the site of the Panama Canal _ is the
home of the U.S. Southern Command, the organization responsible for
all U.S. military forces in Central and South America. About 10,000
American servicemen and a like number of dependents are stationed
there permanently.
   Over the course of the two-month build-up this spring, the
Pentagon moved an extra 2,200 servicemen into Panama on temporary
duty status to augment the roughly 600 security personnel assigned
there permanently.
   The issue of withdrawing those servicemen and replacing them
arises now because under military regulations, a temporary duty
assignment cannot last more than 180 days.

   The gunshot that killed Palau President
Lazarus E. Salii on Aug. 20 was self-inflicted, the government said
Friday.
   ``The inescapable conclusion is that the cause and manner of
death was instantaneous by self-inflicted perforating gunshot wound
of the head,'' said the report issued by the offices of Palau's
attorney general and director of the Bureau of Public Safety.
   The report cited ballistic tests conducted at the FBI laboratory
in Washington, D.C., an autopsy report from forensic pathlogist Dr.
Hee-Yong Park on Guam and statements from witnesses.
   Salii, 51, was the second elected president of the tiny island
republic in the Western Pacific. He was elected in August 1985 to
succeed Haruo I. Remeliik, who was assassinated two months earlier.
Three Palau men convicted at trial in connection with Remeliik's
death were acquitted on appeal.
   Salii's wife found his body slumped in his chair in a small
sitting room in their house, the report said.
   A .357-caliber Magnum revolver that Salii had borrowed from a
police officer about four months earlier was found on the floor by
his feet, it said.
   The autopsy report said Salii placed the gun muzzle at his left
temple and fired. The bullet passed through his head.
   Palau, about 4,500 miles southwest of Hawaii and 600 miles east
of the Philippines, has been beset by economic and political
problems, including a lengthy legal dispute over its future
political status with the United States.
   Palau, with a population of 15,000, is the last political entity
of the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands and has yet to
conclude an agreement on a proposed Compact of Free Association
with the United States.

   Four U.S. tourists lost $173,000 worth of
jewelry purchased during a two-month European tour when their car
was broken into and their luggage stolen, police said.
   The two retired couples from Palm City, Florida, had left their
valuables in a car Wednesday while sight-seeing in Bath, the
ancient Roman spa city 100 miles west of London, said Inspector
Graham Cawley of the Avon and Somerset police.
   The couples were at the end of a two-month tour of Europe during

including bracelets, rings and brooches, most of it gold, Cawley
said.
   Cawley would not release the tourists' names. He said he did not
know whether the jewelry was purchased for personal use or for
resale in the United States.

<DATELINE>GALVESTON, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The incessant surf rolled in a little
higher than normal and even though it was late summer, the peak
time for tropical storms, people weren't too concerned.
   After all, this was Galveston, the largest and most prosperous
town in Texas, the Wall Steet of the Southwest, and it had
weathered storms before.
   In September 1900, in the days before radio and satellite
photographs, people had no idea that out in the Gulf of Mexico a
monster storm was brewing that would change Texas history and bring
death and terror on a scale that never has been seen before or
since in the United States.
   On Sept. 8, 1900, Galveston was home to nearly 38,000 people.
   When the sun rose the next day, nearly one-sixth of the city's
residents were dead, victims of buildings toppled by winds and
waves, drowned in the 15-foot storm surge, mangled by flying debris
or washed out to sea.
   The death toll was put at 6,000, but it's uncertain how many
thousands of others were lost.
   ``Nobody knows the complete story of what happened at Galveston;
nobody ever will know,'' John Edward Weems wrote in his classic
account of the storm, ``A Weekend in September.''
   Ironically, the book, written in 1956, was re-released this
month to mark the 88th anniversary of the great Galveston storm.
   ``Most of them wanted to talk,'' Weems says now, recalling his
conversations with storm survivors. ``The tragedies were still with
them, but enough time had passed so they could talk about them.
   ``I got the idea some of them might be paying respect to their
dead friends and relatives by talking about them.''
   Although Weems believes all the hundreds of survivors he
interviewed have died since, Jennie Graham Karboski is among the
few still living who were there. And what she remembers most is the
water, angrily rising _ and the bodies, floating everywhere.
   Mrs. Karboski is now 100 and lives with her daughter in Houston.
She was 12 and growing up in Galveston when the storm hit.
   ``They tried to have mass burials at sea, but the next morning
many floated back in on the surf,'' she told the Houston Chronicle
this week. ``The men had to dig trenches and burn them. My dad said
they kept the work crews drunk. They had to.''
   After a harrowing journey by rowboat and horse cart, Mrs.
Karboski's family found shelter in a Catholic seminary.
   Others who survived huddled in a lighthouse or a storm-tossed
ship or crammed inside the upper stories of their homes. Others
clung to wreckage until the waters receded.
   Perhaps the most lasting monument to the 1900 storm is the
Galveston seawall, a concrete embankment 17 feet above mean low
tide built after the great storm to ward off future huge storm
surges. It has helped to moderate damage from hurricanes since.
   A more significant effect, however, was that many businessmen
who considered Galveston the hub of activity for Texas decided they
would not put themselves through another such storm.
   They moved inland about 50 miles to a mosquito-infested swamp
town called Houston, which 88 years later is the nation's
fourth-largest city.

<HEAD>New TV Season Starts With ABC, CBS Struggling Against NBC's
Olympics</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Also in Friday AMs report.</NOTE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   But for the summerlong writers' strike, the fall
television season would have begun Monday with typically fervent
competition among the three networks and an advertising blitz for
their new shows.
   But network competition has been sidelined for the next couple
of weeks as the 1988 Summer Olympics play in prime time on NBC,
while ABC and CBS _ their new fall shows delayed for weeks by the
strike _ basically twiddle their thumbs.
   CBS is even hoping the Olympics do well for NBC.
   ``We face, absent the Olympics, an audience that's going to be
more restless than usual,'' said David Poltrack, CBS vice president
for marketing. ``If they're going to find a place to be diverted to
while waiting for the season to be launched late, the Olympics is
where I'd like to see them go, not to independent stations or cable
networks.
   ``So at this point in time, we'd like to get the majority of the
audience that the Olympics don't get, but I'd like to see the
Olympics do well.''
   CBS is also hoping good NBC numbers will help when CBS sells
advertising in the 1994 Winter Olympics. CBS is also seeking rights
to the 1992 summer games.
   ABC is counter-programming the Olympics with half-hour comedies,
but it, too, has basically forfeited the lion's share of television
viewers to NBC.
   ``We tried to do it with a little bit of fun, a sense of
humor,'' said Alan Wurtzel, ABC's vice president for marketing.
``Recognize something comes along every four years, and we know
we're not going to beat it.''
   CBS is running movies and first-run sitcoms against the Olympics
in an effort to draw as many kids and older people, the groups
least likely to be avid watchers of the Olympics.
   ABC has decided that if the Olympics are high drama, they'll
counter-program with laughs. The network has scheduled a month of
repeats of top ABC sitcoms, plus comedy movies and specials.
   ``What we did was, we looked at basically what did best against
us when we had the Olympics in the past, how our competitors
fared,'' said Wurtzel. ``What we learned was people kind of dipped
in and out of the Olympics. They don't necessarily like every
event. Programs that did best were half-hour comedies.'' NBC is
predicting it will average about a third of the prime-time viewing
audience with Olympics.
   Because of the strike delay, the networks are at odds over when
the new television season should be declared open.
   Advertisers buy commercials based on viewership of individual
shows, so they don't care who wins the seasonlong horse race in the
A.C. Nielsen Co. ratings. But it is an image contest.
   Not surprisingly, NBC believes the new season should begin
Monday, since it will have undoubtedly big ratings for the Olympics
which would count on the season.
   ``We did not have the start-time problem that some other people
may have, so we're taking the traditional outlook and starting on
the 19th,'' said Jeff Boehme, director of audience measurement at
NBC.
   ``Several broadcasters don't have original programming. I'm sure
they would prefer to start it at a later time. From our
perspective, we have our programming in place, and we don't think
it would be fair to us to delete first-run programming from the
season,'' he said.
   Wurtzel says ABC is marking the new season from about Oct. 24,
the week in which it will have half its new programs on the air.
Poltrack said CBS would also have the season start Oct. 24 for the
same reason.
   If the late start is confounding the networks, viewers could
benefit. Even though the television season is starting late, the
networks have nevertheless put in orders for a full season's supply
of episodes for most series.
   That means fewer reruns next spring.

<TEXT>
   With Yellowstone National Park's
wildfires still burning, the famous tourist attraction's gateway
cities already are planning ways to lure visitors to the charred
landmark next summer.
   ``The geysers are still there, the waterfalls are still there,
the elk and bison and bears are still there, the streams and fish
are still there,'' said Suzanne Young, executive director of the
Jackson, Wyo., Chamber of Commerce.
   ``Our job will be to get out the message that `Yes, there is
still the Yellowstone you love and remember, despite the forest
fires.'''
   While the key landmarks are still there, so is a mosaic of
charred trees as a dozen enormous fires have blazed across nearly
half of Yellowstone's 2.2 million acres in the past two months. The
flames forced frequent evacuations of campgrounds and lodging
facilities, and blanketed thousands of square miles with smoke.
   The park's tiny gateway communities are vitally linked to the
giant wilderness, which in a normal year attracts 3 million
visitors. Towns with economies strongly dependent on Yellowstone
include Gardiner, Silver Gate, Cooke City and West Yellowstone in
Montana; Jackson and Cody in Wyoming; and, to a lesser degree,
Driggs and Victor in Idaho.
   Officials say that so far this year, tourist visits to
Yellowstone are down 12.5 percent from last year's figures, a loss
of more than a quarter million visitors.
   Many merchants and innkeepers are wondering about the long-term
economic impact of the worst fires in Yellowstone in 300 years.
   ``A month after the fires are out, or at least after they're off
the TV nightly news, we want a market research firm to do attitude
perception surveys to find out what people think about a vacation
in Yellowstone,'' said Young.
   ``Will they be interested? What will they expect to see? Our
guess is that memory is short. Nobody can even remember a hurricane
name from last week. My hunch is, people will want to come see what
happened here.''
   Steve Tedder of park concessioner TW Services, which runs
Yellowstone's lodging, restaurants and transportation services,
expects sales to be down $4 million to $5 million _ a 25 percent
drop from last year.
   ``It certainly has been an interesting summer,'' he said wryly.
``July and August traditionally are our biggest months, when we
make up for the losses of our winter operation. It has been very
dramatic _ devastating from a visitor standpoint and an operations
standpoint. To date, we've had to give early release to about 800
employees. I think it was by the grace of God that we have not lost
any major structures.''
   John Olson, TW Services' marketing director, said the fires have
had a strong effect on the entire region.
   ``We have got a big job this fall just convincing the local
people to come back,'' he said. ``Then we have to look at the
national and international markets. I know we've got a heck of a
problem.''
   Olson is busy accumulating videotape and photographs showing
that many areas of the park are unaffected by the fires ``so we can
be sure we're telling the true story.'' He already has traveled to
London to talk about Yellowstone with key tour group operators and
newspaper travel editors.
   In addition, some University of Wyoming students are using
computer lists to contact tourists who canceled their reservations
at Yellowstone, and find out why.
   Rick Wilder, executive director of the Cody, Wyo., Chamber of
Commerce, hopes the federal government will step in to help, noting
that a portion of profit from concessions within the park goes for
park improvements.
   ``We're not looking for a handout or a giveaway, but it's going
to be very difficult to add on any extra expense,'' said Wilder.
``The federal government is spending $100 million to fight the
fires, so it doesn't seem unrealistic to think an extra $2 million
could be spent to get people to come back to Yellowstone.''
   John Wilson, head of Montana's tourism promotion effort, said
Montana Gov. Ted Schwinden and Wyoming Gov. Mike Sullivan will be
asked by their states' travel and tourism officials to seek federal
disaster money for the park's gateway communities.

   Captain James T. Kirk of the starship Enterprise
looks skyward from a lonely, wind-blown planet and says:
``Entapuraizu, riku kara tenso shite kure.''
   For those listening to the English version of ``Star Trek,''
Captain Kirk would have said ``Enterprise, beam me up.''
   Dubbed in Japanese, ``Star Trek'' is just one of many vintage
American TV programs boldly exploring the late-night Tokyo airwaves.
   During a typical week, insomnia-stricken viewers in the Tokyo
area can watch ``Burke's Law,'' the 1960s adventure show starring
Gene Barry as a debonair Los Angeles police chief; Rod Serling's
``The Twilight Zone,'' the acclaimed science fiction series;
``Bonanza,'' one of television's longest running Westerns, starring
Lorne Greene; ``The Beverly Hillbillies,'' the antics of a
backwoods family in Los Angeles' elitist neighborhood; ``Mission:
Impossible,'' the acclaimed Bruce Geller adventure series; and
``The Addams Family,'' a sitcom based on Charles Addams' bizarre
magazine cartoon characters.
   ``I don't have any statistics on this,'' said Yoshihiro Mishima
of the TV Tokyo network, ``but we think the people who stay up to
watch these programs are looking for a bit of the good old days,
when they might have been too young to watch the original
broadcasts.''
   Mishima said the viewers are mainly college students or adults
in their 30s. ``It's part of the `retro boom,''' he said, referring
to a recent trend among some Japanese to seek out things from the
past.
   But American TV shows are nothing new to the Japanese audience.
``There have been American programs on Japanese TV for decades,
going back to `Ben Casey' and `Rawhide,''' Mishima said. ``They've
lost popularity to domestic programing, but people still watch them
to get a look at America.''
   Yuji Tagami, an editor with TV Station magazine, added, ``They
can develop devoted fans, but ratings for late-night American
programs in general are not very high.''
   Limited viewership did not stop the Tokyo Broadcasting System
from putting the ``Nostalgic American TV'' series on its schedule
last October. Since March, the series has included: ``Surfside 6,''
a '60s detective series set in Miami Beach, starring Troy Donahue
and Van Williams; ``Combat!'' the longest of the World War II
adventures, starring the late Vic Morrow; and ``Superman,''
starring George Reeves.
   ``Ratings aren't a good way to judge late-night television
shows' popularity. In that time slot, viewership is small and more
personal. Viewers are more attached to what they watch,'' said
Masato Ueda, TBS producer of the series.
   To young viewers, the appeal of the rejuvenated old programs is
in their ``newness,'' Ueda said.
   ``We decided to go with the series when we went on the 24-hour
broadcasting schedule, and though the `retro boom' was a part of
the decision, we wanted to give young people something completely
new, which to them these programs are.''
   Many of the American programs also feature bilingual broadcasts,
with the original English-language dialogue simultaneously aired on
a subchannel available on specially equipped TV sets.

   When President Reagan switched the other day
and decided to release overdue payments to the United Nations, it
was another sign that as far as U.S. foreign policy is concerned
his views have undergone extensive alteration since he entered the
White House nearly eight years ago.
   Presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater explained the surprising
switch on the dues as based on a determination by Reagan that the
United Nations had ``reformed its operation.''
   That doesn't alter the fact, however, that one of the tenets of
the political philosophy that nurtured Reagan and gave identity to
his pursuit of the presidency was severe skepticism of the United
Nations.
   Conservatives always have complained that the United States paid
a disproportionate share of the U.N. bills while serving as a
convenient target of the Soviet bloc and the so-called non-aligned
countries.
   But Reagan told the State Department to ante up, and another
corner was turned. In his twilight months in the White House only
his commitment to guerrillas trying to overthrow the Sandinista
government in Nicaragua remains uncolored by the pragmatic fact
that the Contras are not making much headway.
   On arms control, after campaigning in 1980 against all major
accords with the Soviet Union and putting negotiations on a back
burner for months, Reagan gradually adopted a stance that even
diehard opponents grudgingly acknowledged was far friendlier to
arms control than they had expected.
   They still are worried he may try to unravel the 1972
Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty before heading home to California,
but the new 1987 accord to ban intermediate-range nuclear missiles
is safely on the books.
   It stands as the only U.S.-Soviet agreement to eliminate an
entire category of nuclear weapons, and it was negotiated on
Reagan's watch.
   Meanwhile, four summit meetings with Soviet leader Mikhail S.
Gorbachev have produced a conciliatory stance in the White House
that is in striking contrast to early Reagan rhetorical flourishes
that included castigating Moscow as an ``evil empire.''
   Until November 1985, he was the first American president since
Herbert Hoover not to have met with a Soviet leader. Now he has
held more one-on-one superpower summits than any of them.
   Ironically, Reagan has moderated his arms control policy to such
an extent that Michael Dukakis, who is a liberal Democrat,
suggested this week in outlining a nuclear missile strategy agenda
that his views were not that far from the president's.
   The biggest difference is over Reagan's Strategic Defense
Initiative. Dukakis said he would ``stop pouring billions and
billions of dollars'' into the pursuit of a space-based defense
against Soviet ballistic missiles. But he said he would continue a
modest research program into possible missile defenses.
   The Republican candidate, Vice President George Bush, who
projected himself in 1980 as a moderate alternative to Reagan's
deep conservatism, is working overtime, meanwhile, to align himself
with Reagan's foreign policy initiatives. His pitch essentially is
that he would continue along the same course if he is elected.
   Having been part of the administration, Bush's job in lining up
with Reagan policies is hardly as difficult as the task confronting
Dukakis.
   But the Democratic candidate's agenda on weapons moved him
closer to Reagan.
   Dukakis has voiced concerns about the costs of the B-1 bomber
and the Midgetman missile, but he endorsed production of the
Trident II submarine-launched missile and four other weapons.
   More significant, perhaps, was his vow that ``We'll use force
when it's necessary to protect our territory, our citizens or our
vital interests; to meet our treaty commitments; and to deter or to
respond to terrorist attacks.''
   The words were Dukakis's but if you close your eyes and let your
mind drift back to 1980 they might just as well have been Ronald
Reagan's.

   Ladies and gentlemen, sharpen your scalpels. The
show that dares to comment on Patti LuPone's diction, Madonna's
acting ability, Nell Carter's figure and Sarah Brightman's overbite
has returned with malice and entertainment for all.
   ``Forbidden Broadway 1988,'' which arrived Thursday at
off-Broadway's Theater East, is the latest edition of Gerard
Alessandrini's vest-pocket musical revues that mercilessly spoof
the Broadway theater. And it's the best version of the show yet.
   In more than 25 musical sketches, a hard-working company of
four, plus pianist Philip Fortenberry, takes aim at some of
Broadway's biggest hits including ``Les Miserables,'' ``The Phantom
of the Opera,'' ``M. Butterfly,'' ``Speed-the-Plow,'' ``Anything
Goes'' and ``Into the Woods.'' They score a bull's-eye nearly every
time.
   Alessandrini, who devised the show and supplied the new lyrics
as well as the direction, is a master at deflating bombast.
Consider his blitz of ``Les Miserables'' _ a mock mini-musical that
deflates the big Broadway blockbuster. It's not easy simulating
Trevor Nunn's turntable staging, but Alessandrini comes up with
credible and hilaroius copy of it here. But then he also supplies a
chandelier for something called ``The Phantom of the Musical,'' a
duet for a masked Andrew Lloyd Webber and a buck-toothed Miss
Brightman.
   The author is equally effective at lancing big-time
personalities. There's a narcissistic Miss LuPone mushmouthing a
Cole Porter-style ditty called ``I Get a Kick Out of Me.'' Or an
exasperated David Mamet, author of ``Speed-the-Plow,'' singing, to
the tune of ``The Rain in Spain,'' ``We strain in vain to train
Madonna's brain.''
   The performers, particularly the two women, are superb mimics.
Toni DiBuono does a terrific LuPone, and a powerhouse Ethel Merman
who battles it out on stage in a duet with a relentlessly perky
Mary Martin, played by Roxie Lucas. Miss Lucas also lacerates
Elaine Stritch, parodying her ``Ladies Who Lunch'' number in
``Company'' with a song called ``Ladies Who Screech.''
   The evening reaches the height of demented lunacy when Miss
DiBuono and Michael McGrath take on Kiri Te Kanawa and Jose
Carreras and the practice of using opera stars to record famous
Broadway scores. Here Alessandrini has them singing a song from the
rock musical ``Grease.'' Equally effective is McGrath's explanation
of the bizarre plot of ``M. Butterfly,'' done to the strains of
``Poor Butterfly.''
   David B. McDonald lends his booming voice to an effective sendup
of Joseph Papp, called ``Papp the Knife,'' and Papp's practice of
butchering the classics. He also leads the audience in a Sondheim
sing-along called ``Into the Words.''
   ``Forbidden Broadway'' seems to renew itself every season with
the influx of new shows. Right now, you can imagine Alessandrini
looking forward with glee to ``Jerome Robbins' Broadway'' and Peter
Allen in ``Legs Diamond,'' both big musicals scheduled to open this
season. They should provide particularly good material for his
special brand of merry meyhem.

<HEAD>Farming Town Resists Immigrants, Raising Questions Of Racism</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP Extra</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SJOBO, Sweden (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The nation's heartland is challenging
Sweden's generous refugee policy, raising fears that latent racism
may be bubbling to the surface.
   It's happening in Sjobo, a small southern farming town where the
tallest building is three stories high, downtown is one street, and
everyone knows just about everybody else.
   The 15,000 citizens of the town and the surrounding district are
holding a referendum Sunday on whether to accept about 30 refugees.
   It is a local issue, but the question is drawing national
attention and is dominating the final weeks of the campaign for the
parliamentary election on the same day.
   Government figures say that from 1983 to 1987, 62,600 people
sought political asylum in Sweden, a country of 8.4 million people,
making it the highest per capita rate in Europe.
   Last year 245 of Sweden's 284 municipal districts took in 18,000
newcomers as the government tried to spread them outside Stockholm
and other cities where housing is scarce.
   When the request came to Sjobo, the town council balked. It
voted last autumn by 25-24 to put the question to a popular vote.
   Residents say the issue has split families, friends and even the
town's only church. Distrust and anger stop people from talking
about it any more, and a sullenness has fallen on the town.
   ``A lot of people are very ashamed. It's terrible,'' said
Madeleine Ramel, head of the local Social Welfare Board. ``The town
has changed.''
   Mrs. Ramel said the fight in Sjobo may spread to other
communities that have been reluctant to take in refugees but that
have been too afraid of public scorn to refuse.
   ``It is dangerous to ignore signals, and what is happening in
Sjobo is one of the signals,'' said Mrs. Ramel.
   The immigration department has said Sjobo could have a say in
which immigrants would be sent. The decision has been postponed
until after the referendum.
   An influx of immigrants from Iran, Lebanon and South America has
spawned a right-wing backlash in France, Denmark and other European
countries, but that has not happened in Sweden.
   ``A lot of Swedes have a negative attitude toward immigrants. It
is normally surpressed, but having a referendum is bringing it to
the surface,'' said Anders Sonnerstedt, a political scientist at
nearby Lund University.
   ``Swedish people are afraid to speak about the refugee question
today, because anyone who speaks out is called a racist,'' said
Per-Ingvar Magnusson, a fertilizer dealer who favors keeping the
immigrants out.
   Magnusson, chairman of the Sjobo branch of the Center Party,
denied he is motivated by racism. He said the town lacks housing
and jobs for its own young people who are moving away, and he
professed astonishment at the attention the town has received.
   ``They make us out to be stupid, fools, farmers who live in
isolation,'' he said in an interview. The town simply wants to take
care of its own first, he said.
   Mrs. Ramel, whose welfare board would handle the immigrants if
they came, dismissed Magnusson's argument. ``It's a silly question.
Why can't 15,000 people take care of 30 more people. I think they
(the opponents) just don't want foreigners here.''
   The nay-sayers in Sjobo have been roundly condemned by national
leaders, the media and the public. One waitress complained that a
customer passing through asked rudely if the restaurant ``has
racism on the menu.''
   Magnusson said he gets hundreds of letters of support from other
Swedes. Many of them ``don't even dare to sign their names'' for
fear of being branded as a racist.
   Sweden's few openly racist groups are dismissed as an
insignificant fringe. But the fight in Sjobo involves farmers who
represent Sweden's roots, and a political party with long and
illustrious history.
   The issue was an embarrassment to the national Center Party
during its election campaign, and party leader Olof Johansson
threatened to expel the Sjobo members. ``They have made their last
mistake in the Center Party,'' he said in a television interview.
   The center-right party governs the local council in a coalition
with the Conservative Party. On the national level, it is in the
opposition against the governing Social Democratic party.
   Set serenely among woodlands and wheatfields, Sjobo seems hardly
the scene for a national confrontation. The town of 4,000 is laid
out in neat rows of single-story homes with well-trimmed gardens.
   The Immigration Department has said the state would pay for
housing and educating the immigrants.
   But Magnusson said the problem goes deeper. He said the
government must curb an unchecked flood of immigrants.
   Magnusson cited police reports that more than half the refugees
seeking to live in Sweden destroy their passports on their way here
to make it difficult to deport them.
   Police say as many as 25,000 people may be in Sweden under false
identities and that as many as 15 wanted terrorists move here every
year.
   Among them were a Palestinian who was killed by a car bomb in
Athens, Greece in July, and a wanted terrorist from the Irish
Republican Army who was arrested in August by Dutch police while
traveling through the Netherlands.
   ``There are terrorists, drug dealers and criminals coming in,''
said Magnusson. ``If the government had more control of handling
refugees, there would be no need for a vote in Sjobo.''

<TEXT>
   Richard Bowden of London came to this
Caribbean resort to get a tan. He ended up spending a dark day in a
rented car, reading a horror story as he rode out Hurricane
Gilbert, the worst storm on record.
   ``There was a lot of corrugated material flying about all over
the place,'' said Bowden, 35. ``It was like being in an aircraft in
turbulence. You felt the wind was going to lift you away.''
   Other tourists crammed into Cancun's hotels and shelters were
becoming impatient by Thursday, the day after Gilbert blasted the
Yucatan Peninsula with 160-mph winds and driving rain.
   Food was in short supply, power was still out, the airport was
closed and roads out of the city nearly impassable.
   ``Hysterical,'' one hotel receptionist said of the stranded
vacationers.
   About 6,000 tourists were trapped in Cancun when this normally
idyllic resort of sandy beaches and warm, clear waters turned into
a fury of waves and wind in the predawn hours Wednesday.
   Bowden drove into Cancun Tuesday, only hours before the storm
hit.
   By then, tourists at the beachfront resorts were being moved
into shelters and hotels in the old part of the city, about six
miles away.
   As the hurricane neared, Bowden also sought refuge in the city,
but was turned away by hotels already jammed with guests from the
luxury resorts.
   As Gilbert roared into Cancun, Bowden said he curled up in his
car with a book, a horror story involving a magic carpet.
   ``I got sick of it. If I'd had some postcards I would have
written them to send to people, but I did not have any,'' he said.
   Bowden said he watched as airborne debris zipped past his car.
But even worse was the sound of two support lines of a radio
transmission tower twanging ``like a badly tuned guitar'' in the
wind.
   Shortly after dawn, the storm still raging, he said left the
car, looking for some place to get a cup of coffee. Unsuccessful,
he returned to the vehicle.
   About 150 tourists who were given refuge at city hall had
nothing but milk and cookies to eat.
   ``I think everyone's nerves are starting to get shot now,'' said
Joseph Camuccio of Philadelphia, who had arrived in Cancun Sunday.
   ``Everyone is going to the same bathroom,'' he said. ``There is
no water or electricity. They (the toilets) don't flush or
anything. Everybody wants to get out.''
   Some tourists said they were given virtually no warning that a
dangerous storm was on the way.
   Maggie Frederick of Petaluma, Calif., said she had just gotten
dressed to go out for the evening Tuesday when there was a knock
her hotel room door and a voice said: ``You're being evacuated.''
   ``I started laughing thinking they were joking,'' she said.
   Tom Long of Effingham, Ill., who speaks no Spanish, said the
language barrier added to the confusion. He and his wife, Jackie,
were in Cancun to celebrate their fifth wedding anniversary.
   Nabil Nachawati, of Arlington, Texas, said his two children,
ages 3 and 5, took the storm well. When the sky began to darken,
the two children curled up and went to sleep.

<HEAD>Court Clears Lindy Chamberlain After Sensational Murder Case</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Also in Friday AMs report.</NOTE>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SYDNEY, Australia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A woman who said a wild dog snatched
and ate her newborn child has been found innocent of murder.
   The court decision closes the book on an 8-year-old case that
divided Australia and captured headlines worldwide.
   The Northern Territory Court of Criminal Appeal in Darwin on
Thursday overturned Lindy Chamberlain's sentence of life
imprisonment with hard labor. She spent about four years in jail.
   It also quashed the conviction of her husband, Michael, a pastor
for the Seventh Day Adventist Church, on charges of being an
accessory to murder.
   Mrs. Chamberlain, who was born in New Zealand, became a
household name in 1980 when she said a dingo, or native Australian
dog, carried off her 6-week-old daughter Azaria while the family
camped in the Outback near Ayers Rock, a sacred aboriginal site.
   Replete with rumors of black magic and a suicide that led to a
break in the case, the Chamberlain story made Page 1 in newspapers
across Australia and elsewhere. All Australians seem to have an
opinion on the woman's story.
   In 1987, she was pardoned but her conviction was not overturned.
Thursday's innocent verdict finally sealed the case shut.
   Gasps filled the courtroom when the decision was announced.
Michael Chamberlain clasped his hands to his head and wept. His
wife, who had been staring at the judges, slumped in her seat.
   ``The law of the land holds the Chamberlains to be innocent,''
said the ruling.
   The Chamberlains' defense attorney had accused the Northern
Territory government, which originally prosecuted the pair, of
waging a ``modern-day witchunt.''
   The lawyer, Stuart Tipple, said the Chamberlains were waiting to
see whether the government would pay the couple compensation before
deciding on any civil action. Earlier, he said the couple was
seeking about $750,000.
   After the verdict, Mrs. Chamberlain, a tiny woman in high-heeled
red shoes, was thronged by curious onlookers as she strode with
straightened shoulders from the courthouse.
   The crowd clamored for a closer look as the couple made their
way through the large crowd to their car. Construction workers
nearby downed tools and whistled while others jeered.
   The Chamberlain drama began on a cold night in August 1980 when
Mrs. Chamberlain cried out at the family camp side at Ayers Rock,
central Australia, ``A dingo's got my baby!''
   At first, the Chamberlains' story was believed. But when the
couple went to court, Mrs. Chamberlain was accused of slitting her
baby's throat.
   The baby's body was never found, but bloodstains were found in
the couple's tent.
   On Oct. 29, 1982, the Chamberlains were found guilty and Mrs.
Chamberlain was sentenced to life in prison, where she to gave
birth to a second daughter, Kahlia. Her husband was sentenced to a
suspended 18-month sentence.
   The couple has two other sons, Aiden and Reagan. Although the
prosecution never alleged black magic as a motive, many Australians
have linked the death of baby Azaria to witchcraft and satanic
rites, believing the children have mystical names.
   The family denied rumors that the name Azaria meant ``sacrifice
in the wilderness.'' Many Australians also thought it significant
that the death occurred at Ayers Rock, sacred to aborigines in one
of the most remote parts of Australia.
   In February 1986, a remarkable breakthrough in the case came
when a British tourist jumped off the huge monolith to his death.
   Aboriginal trackers investigating the suicide found the tattered
remains of Azaria's jacket, which Mrs. Chamberlain swore the baby
was wearing the night she vanished.
   The discovery of the jacket proved that Mrs. Chamberlain had not
been lying about at least one aspect of her baby's death and
prompted officials to reopen the case.
   Five days after the jacket was found, Mrs. Chamberlain was
released from prison. On June 2, 1987, a federal judge pardoned her
and said Mrs. Chamberlain may have told the truth when she said the
dingo snatched and ate the baby.
   ``Indeed, the evidence affords the view that a dingo may have
taken her,'' federal Judge Trevor Morling wrote in his opinion.
   But under Australian law, the pardon was as far as Trevor could
go and the Chamberlains returned to court to overturn the
conviction.
   ``There is no satisfaction, no joy, knowing they still believe
you are guilty,'' Mrs. Chamberlain said at the time.
   Although the court case is over, the Chamberlain story will
continue.
   American movie star Meryl Streep recently finished filming a
movie on the case based on a book titled ``Evil Angels.'' The
American release is provisionally called ``A Cry In The Darkness.''

<HEAD>Peruvians Buy Hard Goods as Currency Loses Value</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LIMA, Peru (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   With their currency losing ground rapidly in a
spiraling inflation, Peruvians are buying up refrigerators and
other durable goods not likely to lose value as fast as their paper
money, the inti.
   After two years of prosperity, Peruvians are seeing an economic
turnaround that is fueling the fastest increase in consumer prices
ever seen here.
   Independent economists conservatively estimate that inflation
will pass 500 percent this year. Two years ago inflation was 63
percent.
   ``The country is shipwrecked in a sea of paper money,'' said
Sen. Enrique Chirinos, an independent. ``This is a horrifying
perspective and never known before in our history.''
   Consumer prices shot up 30.9 percent in July alone.
   Peruvians are trying to adjust. They say they eat less, work
more and worry a lot.
   ``Now I have to buy less chicken. I use it first for broth and
then stew. It's the only way,'' said housewife Carmen Alegre, while
shopping in Lima's working-class La Aurora market.
   Nearby, tennis shoes costing 500 intis early last year were
selling for 3,000 intis, equivalent to about $25 or half the
minimum monthly wage.
   Cigarettes, often sold singly because many Peruvians cannot
afford entire packs, cost 10 intis each or seven times the January
price.
   Analysts are now concerned that Peru's inflation could boil into
four-digit figures next year.
   The middle class has begun renting spare rooms, tutoring,
knitting and sewing piece work and selling home-cooked food such as
meat-filled ``empanadas'' in streetside stands to make ends meet.
   But Peru's poor, the vast majority of the population, have been
affected the hardest.
   ``The poorest paid people in Peru are earning less money than at
any time since records have been kept,'' The Andean Report, an
economic monthly, said in July.
   An old man begging in the shadow of Lima's downtown government
palace complained recently that inflation was making him poorer.
   ``This fills up fast but the intis are worth nothing,'' he said,
jiggling the dirty plastic cup he waves to passers-by.
   Antonio Reyes, manager of an appliance store, said he telephones
wholesalers every day to get revised prices for the television
sets, stoves and toasters he sells.
   But business has been good, Reyes said, noting customers have
pulled cash from bank accounts where the annual interest is frozen
at 130 percent to buy durable goods, whose value very well could
rise in an inflation.
   ``The only option a saver has with his money is spend it,'' said
the news magazine Caretas. ``Those who do not have the ability to
save will simply have to seek a second job.''
   Guillermo Fernandez, 42, a married accountant with three
children, said he recently began moonlighting as a curbside money
trader on ``Wall Street,'' the name given by Peruvians to Jiron
Ocona, a narrow downtown street where thousands of people every day
now buy dollars as a hedge against inflation.
   He said many of his competitors are also professionals seeking
to supplement inflation-pinched incomes with the small but quick
profits offered by the dollar trade.
   Analysts say Jiron Ocona is also a financial barometer, and the
recent stampede for dollars reflects Peruvians' waning confidence
in the government's ability to improve economic conditions.
   In a recent survey, Peruvians rated the economy as the No. 1
problem, replacing a vicious leftist insurgency that was ranked
first a year ago.
   President Alan Garcia imposed a ceiling on foreign debt payments
on taking office three years ago and then used the money owed
creditors abroad to finance a consumption-based economic
reactivation that pulled Peru from its worst depression of the
century.
   But heavy government spending with an expected deficit of at
least 12 percent and a growing shortage of dollar reserves to
subsidize imports have plunged the nation into recession this year.
   Manufacturing has fallen sharply, while speculation in consumer
and industrial goods is rampant.
   Prosperity reflected by well-stocked stores two years ago has
now been replaced with repeated and prolonged shortages of
medicines, auto parts and basic foods, such as milk and sugar.
   Garcia, a populist whose term ends in 1990, recently installed a
``war economy,'' aimed at holding down wage increases while
allowing prices to rise.
   But economists maintain the measures are not sufficent and
predict inflation will continue to soar.
   ``When inflation hits 500 percent, it could very easily get out
of hand,'' said one leading independent economist, Alejandro Toledo.
   ``This is my biggest concern. There will be a very high social
cost and Peru is not a stable country.''

   Thousands of coastal residents from
Mexico to Louisiana fled to higher ground Thursday as fierce
Hurricane Gilbert sent the first of its storms against Texas after
thrashing the Yucatan Peninsula.
   ``This is a killer storm,'' said Gordon Guthrie, director of the
Florida Division of Emergency of Management. ``I feel sorry for
anybody wherever this hits.''
   The death toll from the storm's onslaught through the Caribbean
islands and the Yucatan was at least 47, and damage estimates
reached $8 billion. Jamaican Prime Minister Edward Seaga declared a
one-month public emergency.
   By late evening, a torrential rain was falling in Brownsville.
   At 11 p.m. CDT, the storm center was near latitude 22.8 north,
longitude 94.4 west, or about 275 miles southeast of Brownsville,
moving west-northwest between 12 and 15 mph, with maximum sustained
winds of 120 mph and accompanied by a 5- to 10-inch rainfall,
according to the National Weather Service.
   ``If this motion continues, the center of the hurricane will
cross the coast near the Texas-Mexico border on Friday evening,''
the weather service said. ``If a northwest turn should occur, the
landfall could be further up the Texas coast.''
   The weather service issued a hurricane warning for Mexico's
northern coast and the southern half of the 370-mile Texas coast
from Brownsville to Port O'Connor, including 250,000-resident
Corpus Christi. A hurricane watch remained in effect for the
remainder of the Texas coast, from Port O'Connor north to Port
Arthur near the Louisiana border.
   The weather service said warnings might be extended northward,
depending on the path of the 450-mile wide storm.
   Texas Gov. Bill Clements sent National Guard units to Alice,
McAllen and Corpus Christi, the first such deployment for the
hurricane, to assist in communications and rescue duties.
   Clements also issued an emergency proclamation allowing local
authorities to suspend laws ``to preserve the health, safety and
welfare of the public,'' including such things as the direction of
travel on highways.
   Grocery stores ran low on bottled water, batteries, canned tuna
and bread as people laid in supplies. Homeowners covered windows
and doors with plywood and shatter-proofing hurricane tape.
Offshore oil workers left their rigs in the Gulf of Mexico.
   On Galveston Island, City Manager Doug Matthews recommended
Thursday evening that the city's 62,000 residents start evacuating.
   ``We are dealing with people's lives therefore at 8 o'clock we
are recommending evacuation of the island. We feel that we cannot
wait until the morning to make that decision,'' Matthews said,
adding that roadblocks would be set up at midnight on Interstate 45
to limit access to the island.
   In Brownsville, Texas' southernmost city, winds began to pick up
around noon under overcast skies. Police said they were asking
residents to consider evacuating, but were not ordering it.
   ``We've never evacuated the city and the point is, where are you
going to move 100,000 people?'' said Sgt. Dean Poos.
   A Greyhound-Trailways bus spokesman said the company was
doubling its schedule of outbound buses to accommodate those
fleeing the storm.
   Lorena Curry, who has lived in Brownsville since 1935, said she
plans to ride out the storm. ``I've been through them before. I'm
going to stick around at my home.'' But she added, ``I could get
along without a hurricane very well.''
   Gilbert surged into the gulf after battering the Yucatan
Peninsula in Mexico with 160 mph winds, forcing tens of thousands
to flee.
   After crossing the peninsula, Gilbert's winds weakened to 120
mph, but forecasters predicted the storm would intensify again as
it moves over open water.
   ``The shower and thunderstorm activity that we see taking place
around the hurricane itself is getting better organized, more
vigorous, so we think it's starting to strengthen,'' said Bob
Sheets, director of the National Hurricane Center in Miami.
   Sheets said the hurricane's sustained winds would ``certainly
increase to 130, 140 miles per hour.''
   In the coastal resort of South Padre Island, about 25 miles
southeast of Brownsville, the mayor ordered its 1,000 residents to
evacuate.
   ``We can't force them to leave, but it doesn't make any sense to
stay,'' said Mayor Bob Pinkerton Jr., adding that water and
electricity would be turned off Thursday afternoon.
   Tropical storm force winds, at least 39 mph, extended outward up
to 250 miles to the north and 200 miles to the south of the center.
   The storm's first landfall earlier this week left at least 26
people dead in Jamaica, five in the Dominican Republic, 10 in Haiti
and the six in Mexico. It also left a half-million people homeless
in Jamaica and caused widespread damage to the Cayman Islands.
   The storm barreled into the Yucatan coast at dawn Wednesday,
thrashing beaches with 23-foot waves, uprooting trees, knocking out
electricity and water supplies and severing telephone lines.
   In Campeche, the state capital on the peninusula's west coast,
boats and seaweed littered the streets of hundreds of yards from
the shore after Gilbert passed through.
   ``The whole city is flooded. Everything is dark,'' said Ramon
Castillo, a watchman at the newspaper Novedades de Campeche. ``I've
lived here all my life and I have never seen bad weather like this.
People are scared.''
   Mexican officials reported six deaths, including two babies who
drowned, and at least seven people were injured, but authorities
were unable to reach many isolated villages.
   Gilbert pounded the provincial capital of Merida and the gulf
port cities of Puerto Progreso, Campeche and Ciudad del Carmen,
closing airports and roads and knocking out communications and
power and flooding streets and highways.
   About 20,000 people were evacuated from Puerto Progreso and
other coastal towns, a spokesman for the Interior Ministry in
Mexico City said by telephone Thursday. Hundreds of homes were
destroyed, he said.
   On Mexico's northern coast, people were evacuated from fishing
villages and towns into shelters in Matamoros, a city of 400,000
about 12 miles inland near Brownsville.
   The hurricane center said Gilbert at one point was the most
intense storm on record in terms of barometric pressure, which was
measured Tuesday at 26.13 inches, breaking the 26.35 inches
recorded for the 1935 hurricane that devastated the Florida Keys.
   The storm, spawned Saturday southeast of Puerto Rico, appeared
to have hit Jamaica the hardest. Seaga said it destroyed about
100,000 of Jamaica's 500,000 homes. He estimated damage at $8
billion.
   Seaga said in a nationwide radio broadcast Thursday that the
one-month ``period of public emergency,'' including a dawn-to-dusk
curfew to prevent looting, was put into effect ``to enable normalcy
to resume in the shortest possible time and to allow the rebuilding
process to begin.''
   On Wednesday, Gilbert was classified as a Category 5 storm, the
strongest and deadliest type of hurricane. Such storms have maximum
sustained winds greater than 155 mph and can cause catastrophic
damage.
   By Wednesday night, the National Hurricane Center downgraded it
to a Category 4 and to a Category 3 by Thursday morning.

   Singer Paul Simon has donated $375,000 from his
appearance on ``Live at the Hard Rock'' to the mobile medical unit
he founded to give free medical treatment to homeless children.
   Before agreeing to do the show, Simon got its sponsor,
Coca-Cola, to agree to give the children's medical service a
minimum donation of $250,000 for his performance with John Cougar
Mellencamp in Los Angeles.
   That, coupled with his $125,000 salary, makes the New York
Children's Health Project $375,000 richer, Dan Klores, a spokesman
for the project, said recently.
   Simon founded the New York Children's Health Project, which
gives free health care to more than 12,000 homeless children in the
city, last November. The mobile medical vans are run by doctors
from the New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center.

   Actor Tom Berenger says he enjoys bringing out
the human side of the bad-guy roles he's played, including a
sadistic sergeant in the Oscar-winning ``Platoon'' and a racist in
his new movie, ``Betrayed.''
   The exception, he says, was the maniacal slasher he portrayed in
``Looking for Mr. Goodbar.''
   ``It was such a slimy character with no redeeming qualities,''
Berenger told US magazine in its Oct. 3 issue. ``To me it was like
playing Charles Manson. I had nightmares after I finished shooting.
I felt dirty.''
   Yet when working on a role, Berenger said, he doesn't think
about his character's bad nature. ``You can't think that you're
playing a villain or you'll end up with a cartoon.''
   Berenger recently completed a script about an Irish rebellion
and included a part in it for him: ``the bad guy. Or, at least, the
insensitive one.''

   Hurricane Gilbert stole the show
from Frank Sinatra, Liza Minnelli and Sammy Davis Jr. in Texas this

   The three had been scheduled to open Saturday at Houston's
Summit Arena but uncertainty over the storm's direction forced them
to shift to a show Sunday at Arizona State University in Tempe,
spokeswoman Susan Reynolds said Thursday. The Houston appearance

   Sinatra has performed with Miss Minnelli and Davis, but all
three have never performed together, Ms. Reynolds said.
   The trio have been rehearsing at Davis' California home for

   Former tennis champion Arthur Ashe was released
from a hospital after taking antibiotics to relieve pressure from a
``severe bacterial infection'' in his head, his agent said.
   The infection put pressure on nerves, causing numbness in the
arm of the 45-year-old former Wimbledon and U.S. Open champion,
according to Ted Ewanciw, a spokesman for ProServ, Ashe's agent.
Antibiotics ``relieved the pressure considerably,'' Ewanciw said.
   Myrna Manners, a spokeswoman for New York Hospital, said Ashe
was released Thursday after a weeklong stay during which his
condition was satisfactory throughout.
   Ashe retired from professional tennis in 1980, the year after he
underwent quadruple bypass surgery following a heart attack. He had
a heart attack and double bypass surgery four years later.
   In a telephone interview from his hospital room Monday, he said
the tests he was undergoing were unrelated to his earlier heart
problems.

<TEXT>
   Vacationers fled Gulf Coast beaches
Thursday, property owners boarded up homes and businesses, and
emergenc workers filled sandbags and readied shelters as powerful
Hurricane Gilbert took aim at the southern tip of Texas.
   Tens of thousands of schoolchildren from Brownsville to Corpus
Christi were given an unexpected holiday so families would have
time to evacuate, and northbound highways were jammed Thursday
afternoon.
   By 11 p.m., the center of Gilbert was about 275 miles southeast
of Brownsville and a torrential rain was falling. The storm, with
maximum sustained winds of 120 mph, was expected to continue with a
gradual turn toward the northwest expected later, the National
Weather Service reported.
   Brownsville police said they were requesting residents to
consider evacuating, but were not ordering them to leave.
   ``We've never evacuated the city and the point is, where are you
going to move 100,000 people?'' said Sgt. Dean Poos.
   In the coastal resort of South Padre Island, about 25 miles
northeast of Brownsville, the mayor ordered the 1,000 residents to
leave by 4 p.m.
   ``We can't force them to leave, but it doesn't make any sense to
stay,'' said Mayor Bob Pinkerton Jr., adding that water and
electricity would be turned off Thursday afternoon.
   ``It sounds facetious, but people can stay as long as we can
fingerprint them so we can identify them later,'' he said.
   The town's government workers were packing up and moving to
higher ground, at a hotel in McAllen, about 75 miles to the west.
   ``Guests are checking out in an orderly manner, boats and
trailers are leaving the island,'' said Dick Bushnell, spokesman
for the South Padre Island Visitor and Convention Bureau.
   On Galveston Island, City Manager Doug Matthews recommended
Thursday evening that residents start evacuating.
   ``We are dealing with people's lives therefore at 8 o'clock we
are recommending evacuation of the island. We feel that we cannot
wait until the morning to make that decision,'' Matthews said,
adding that roadblocks would be set up at midnight on Interstate 45
to limit access to the island.
   Even in Houston, north of the most likely landfall and about 50
miles inland, the threat of Gilbert had an effect. Residents who
remembered the damage from 1983's Hurricane Alicia taped up
windows, stockpiled food and water and removed tall billboards
along freeways.
   While some Houstonians bought bottled water, tuna fish, canned
fruits and bread, residents of the exclusive River Oaks
neighborhood stocked up on canned crab and lobster and jars of
caviar to weather the storm in style.
   Promoters there even decided to postpone Saturday night's
sold-out show featuring Frank Sinatra, Liza Minnelli and Sammy
Davis Jr. until Oct. 9.
   Military aircraft from bases along the Gulf of Mexico were flown
inland to wait out the storm at places like Midland International
Airport in West Texas, ideal because it's ``high and dry,'' said
airport spokeswoman Marcy Blauvelt.
   Brownsville was given a 27 percent probability of being the spot
where Gilbert will hit land Friday, though a hurricane watch was in
effect along the entire Texas coast as well as the northeastern
Mexican coast from Tampico.
   The National Weather Service estimated maximum sustained winds
at 120 mph and said some strengthening was likely with Gilbert
headed out over the open waters of the Gulf of Mexico. The
hurricane, spawned last week in the Caribbean, caused at least 36
deaths in three island nations and Mexico's Yucatan and left nearly
one in four Jamaicans homeless.
   In Brownsville, at least 30 emergency shelters were being set
up, with the Civic Center boarded up and designated as the first to
be used.
   ``We are getting some sandbags ready with some volunteers in
case the agencies need them,'' said Timo Hinojosa, civil defense
volunteer coordinator for Cameron County.
   A Greyhound-Trailways bus spokesman said the company was
doubling its schedule of outbound buses to accommodate those
fleeing the storm.
   In Corpus Christi, about 170 miles up the coast, residents
seemed more prepared for Gilbert than for previous storms,
officials said.
   Nueces County Commissioner J.P. Luby said workers removed heavy
objects from open areas, and many residents were stocking up on
emergency items.
   Many grocery stores in Corpus Christi, the largest city on the
Texas Gulf Coast, had run out of bottled drinking water and some
canned food. Plywood was sold out in some places.
   Southwestern Bell Co. asked cellular phone customers in South
Texas to try to keep the airwaves clear to allow emergency and
relief workers plenty of communication space.
   The company loaned 100 cellular phone units to Corpus Christi
officials and 100 more to cities in the Lower Rio Grande Valley,
said Pat McGeeney, a Southwestern Bell spokesman in San Antonio.
   Two people in Galveston were arrested on charges of
price-gouging, and Attorney General Jim Mattox said he has a task
force to prosecute people caught raising prices to take advantage
of Texans preparing for Gilbert.
   ``They are doubling and tripling prices for the products. It is
unconscionable for persons to take advantage of others who are in
desperate need,'' he said.
   On Wednesday, Gov. Bill Clements issued an emergency
proclamation allowing local authorities to temporarily suspend
``applicable rules, regulations and statutes to preserve the
health, safety and welfare of the public,'' including such things
as the direction of highways.

   Movable panels of sound-absorbing material
should improve the sound of music from the stage of Carnegie Hall,
say officials of the famous concert hall.
   The beige, cloth-covered fiberglass panels were unveiled at a
news conference Thursday as a response to complaints from some
critics and musicians about acoustics since the hall's major
renovation two years ago.
   The panels, in nine sections that can be carried on or off stage
by stagehands, cost a total of $30,000, officials said.
   Isaac Stern, president of Carnegie Hall, said the panels are
designed to absorb mid-to-high-range sound.
   ``The result is that you can feel the wood quality of a great
violin and of a piano and woodwinds,'' Stern said, adding he thinks
orchestral blend also will be improved by the panels.
   ``The challenge was to provide a modest amount of absorption
that would absorb only in a certain frequency range,'' said
Lawrence P. Goldman, Carnegie Hall vice president and director of
real estate planning and development.

<HEAD>Campaign '88: Bush Opposes, Dukakis Favors Waiting Period for Gun
Buyers</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   George Bush, who has made law-and-order a
centerpiece of his presidential campaign, finds himself on the
opposite side of law enforcement officials on the controversial
issue of a mandatory, national waiting period for gun purchases.
   Democrat Michael Dukakis' prescription for cracking down on
crime includes tougher gun controls, including waiting periods for
handgun purchases.
   A provision calling for the handgun waiting period was
eliminated Thursday in the House from a bill calling for a
multi-billion dollar increase in the federal war on drugs. The
House already voted overwhelmingly last week in favor of a Bush
campaign promise to seek the death penalty for drug killers.
   Bush opposed the so-called Brady amendment to the drug bill
which would have required a federal waiting period. The National
Rifle Association waged a pitched battle against it.
   Bush, a lifetime NRA member, told the National Association of
Police Organizations in a recent survey: ``I am opposed to federal
waiting period legislation; as I have stated in the past, this is a
matter for the states to decide.''
   Twenty-two states have laws requiring waiting periods. The House
amendment is being pushed by Sarah Brady, wife of White House press
secretary James Brady, who was one of four people shot during John
Hinckley's March 1981 attempt to assassinate President Reagan.
   Mrs. Brady's lobbying group, Handgun Control Inc., wants a
seven-day wait on handgun purchases from licensed dealers.
   Under the amendment, a dealer would have to send law enforcement
authorities a sworn statement including the gun's serial number and
description and the buyer's name, address and birth date. The
police, at their option, could perform a background check.
   Dukakis told the police organizations: ``I support legislation
that allows law enforcement officials adequate time to review the
criminal record or competency of anyone applying for a handgun
permit.''
   Dukakis' record in support of gun control, including a proposed
ban on cheap ``Saturday Night Specials'' used in many street
robberies, has angered gun owners in his home state of
Massachusetts. Signs at the state's borders call attention to its
mandatory prison sentences for illegally carrying a gun.
   Dukakis says government should respect the right of citizens to
use firearms for hunting and target shooting, and ``to own firearms
to protect their homes and businesses, subject to the regulation of
state and local governments.''
   But the governor says ``there are too many illegally owned
handguns across this nation, and we must act strongly to control
the use of handguns by criminals.'' He says homicides committed
with handguns claim 22,000 lives each year.
   Bush, in his campaign literature, says, ``I have always opposed
federal gun registration or licensing of gun owners.'' But he adds
that ``we must balance the legitimate interests of gun owners with
the rights of society. ... We must do all we can to keep guns out
of the hands of convicted criminals.''
   In a debate with other Republican candidates before the Gun
Owners of New Hampshire last Feb. 2, Bush said, ``I'm not only a
hunter but I'm a lifetime member of the NRA. I do have a deep
appreciation for the Second Amendment rights'' to keep and bear
arms.
   He assured the gun owners he would, as president, veto a bill
drafted by Sen. Howard Metzenbaum, D-Ohio, that would ban
undetectable plastic handguns as a security hazard, but he urged
gun owners to work with police organizations to fashion a
compromise.
   ``I'm making a pitch here for reason on the part of hunters,''
Bush said. ``The last thing you want to do is find yourself opposed
by those that are on the cutting edge of fighting narcotics,
fighting against international terror and trying to protect
international safety.''
   A compromise later was reached on the plastic gun issue. The
House and Senate passed separate but similar measures, now awaiting
final action in a conference committee. Both candidates say they
support restrictions on undetectable firearms.
   Dukakis running mate Lloyd Bentsen, in an example of his many
policy differences with the top of the ticket, opposes a
nationally-mandated waiting period for handgun purchases. ``I
believe it ought to be done on a state-by-state basis,'' the Texas
senator said Thursday.
   Bush's No. 2, Sen. Dan Quayle, also opposes legislation that
would mandate the waiting period on the national level.
   Hubert Williams, president of the Police Foundation, told
reporters last month that letting states decide on waiting periods
``fails to recognize the immediate danger to our police posed by
the drug gangs.''
   Williams said Bush ``has taken a position that is diametrically
opposed to the interest of law enforcement.''
   ``We are particularly concerned because Vice President Bush has
attempted to make law enforcement issues a central plank in his
platform. ... '' said Williams. ``Bush cannot equivocate or stand
with both the police and the NRA on this one.''

   Justice Sandra Day O'Connor says she at
times yearned to escape the media attention she drew in her initial
year as the first female member of the U.S. Supreme Court.
   O'Connor told the annual meeting of the Oregon State Bar on
Thursday she became an instant novelty in 1981, the year she was
appointed, and that the press followed her everywhere.
   ``My first year on the court made me long at times for
obscurity,'' she said.
   O'Connor said she was surprised about her appointment to the
Supreme Court. She was a state appeals court judge in Arizona at
the time.
   ``I had never expected or aspired to be a Supreme Court judge,''
she said.
   She said she had plenty to learn because she had little
experience with federal law or the federal court system.
   ``It was several years before I felt confident in granting or
denying petitions'' that seek to have the Supreme Court hear
appeals, she said.
   She said although people probably perceive the court as being
insulated from the rest of society, she thinks it's a good place to
get an overview of the nation's concerns because of the variety of
cases it handles.

   Les Black isn't one to shirk his
responsibilites, but then he also didn't count on them entailing
any heavy lifting.
   The lawyer, who earned the job of field driver by dint of being
the town's most recently married man, refused to round up a stray
800-pound bull calf when called to perform his task.
   ``I said I was off duty,'' he joked Thursday. ``I consider the
position of field driver to be a desk job.''
   Black was married May 7, a few weeks before he was appointed to
the post at Town Meeting according to a 200-year-old tradition in
this central Massachusetts town of 600 people.
   ``I suppose 200 years ago, when everybody knew something about
cows and bulls, it made more sense,'' he said.
   He was called to the job Monday for the first time, when a calf
was discovered in a back yard.
   ``I don't know one end of a cow from another,'' he said. ``I was
very lucky there was someone there who did.''
   David Young, the selectmen's chairman, and employees of Young's
lumber company corralled the calf.
   Black said he was called only as a courtesy.
   ``Nobody really calls the field driver and expects him to chase
a bull,'' he said. ``A couple of chickens I could handle, but
that's it.''

<HEAD>Singapore Crackdown on Porkers Benefits U.S. Poultry Producers</HEAD>

   The tiny island nation of Singapore has turned
into a prime market for American poultry, particularly cut up parts
of chickens, an Agriculture Department trade analyst says.
   Peter Kurz of the department's Foreign Agricultural Service,
until recently the agency's trade officer in Singapore, said the
country's decision to eliminate pig farms is behind the poultry
boom.
   ``In a drive for a cleaner environment, Singapore has increased
the tempo in eliminating all pig farms,'' Kurz said. ``Since many
Singapore pig farms also have poultry operations, the number of
poultry farms also has declined sharply.''
   Consequently, poultry production has dropped, causing
Singapore's poultry imports to rise to record levels.
   Kurz, who now is serving with the USDA agency in Washington,
writes about the Singapore poultry boom in the October issue of
Foreign Agriculture magazine.
   Imports of chicken parts were up 20 percent, with the United
States accounting for more than half, nearly 25,000 metric tons.
That was about six times the level of imports from Thailand, the
nearest rival.
   Meanwhile, Singapore's imports of frozen whole chickens dropped
14 percent last year, reflecting a local preference for live
poultry imported from Malaysia, Kurz said. Subsidized shipments of
frozen whole chickens from the European Economic Community have
held U.S. competition to a minimum.
   ``However, export opportunities for U.S. suppliers may lie in
the emerging market for breakfast meats, particularly turkey roll
and turkey meat,'' Kurz said.
   U.S. shipments of chilled and frozen ducks, geese, turkeys and
guinea fowl also have increased and ``occupied a commanding
position'' in the Singapore market in 1987, he said.
   Is there a future for American poultry producers in Singapore, a
country less than a fourth the size of Rhode Island and a
population of 2.5 million?
   ``Everyone involved in this market, from breeders to retailers,
believes that Singapore's poultry consumption _ especially chicken
meat _ will rise, although prices appear to be headed upward,''
Kurz said.
   The price hikes and the conversion to a pig-free environment
``do not deter optimistic forecasts as more fast-food outlets and
the restaurant trade boost the consumption of chicken,'' he said.

   Limited feed supplies could slow China's
ambitious drive to boost livestock and poultry production, an
Agriculture Department report says.
   The current five-year plan for increasing the output of meat 18
percent from 19.3 million metric tons in 1985 to 22.75 million
metric tons by 1990 is meeting with some success, the report by the
department's Foreign Agricultural Service said Thursday.
   ``The limiting factor in Chinese livestock and poultry
production gains will be feed supplies,'' the report said. ``In
turn, feed grain imports will be constrained in the next two to
three years by China's ability to earn sufficient foreign exchange
for these purchases.''
   China is an important but sometimes erratic market for U.S.
farmers, and the livestock sector is watched closely for signs that
more grain and feed sales may be developing.
   One of the problems cited in the report, which was included in
the October issue of Foreign Agriculture magazine, is this year's
rise in world grain prices, caused by tighter supplies resulting
primarily from the U.S. drought.
   ``Should world commodity prices remain high, the Chinese
government is likely to squeeze exports of corn and soybeans out of
the domestic market in order to earn badly needed foreign
exchange,'' the report said.
   In 1985-86, it said, China exported more than 6 million tons of
corn from its northern provinces while importing 400,000 tons into
the south.
   ``As in the past, China will continue to export soybeans for
foreign exchange and barter with Japan, the U.S.S.R. and other
Asian countries,'' the report said.

   The Agriculture Department is seeking
permission from the Environmental Protection Agency to field-test a
genetically engineered bacterium to control a serious disease of
wheat.
   Officials said Thursday that the test, if approved by EPA, would
begin next month on a 1.5-acre site at Washington State Unversity's
agriculture facility near Pullman, Wash. The test would be
conducted by USDA, Monsanto Co. and the university.
   The test would involve a USDA-discovered strain of a bacterium,
pseudomonas, which controls the wheat disease called ``take all.''
The bacterium was genetically altered by Monsanto so it can be
tracked easily in the field.
   ``Before the bacterium can be turned into a commercial product
for use by farmers to control take all, we need to know exactly
what happens when it is released into a field,'' said R. James Cook
of the department's Agricultural Research Service.
   Cook said that among other things, scientists need to know
whether the bacterium spreads into surrounding plants or water, or
if it survives into the following season.
   Cook and his colleagues at the agency's Root Disease and
Biological Control Research Laboratory in Pullman discovered the
bacterium strain and conducted seven years of tests to prove its
ability to control the wheat disease, the department said.

   A government proposal for a voluntary testing
program for Salmonella enteritidis _ a bacteria responsible for at
least 11 deaths from Grade A table eggs since January 1985 _ is
drawing fire from the poultry and egg industries.
   ``I'm an egg farmer. I like my job and I don't want to make
anybody sick,'' Richard McGrath, president of the U.S. Egg
Marketers association, told a panel hearing comments on the program
designed to wipe out the national increase in salmonella
enteritidis.
   Ken Looper of the United Egg Producers said voluntary programs
don't work because, ``One state might implement the program and the
neighboring state would not. This creates marketing problems.''
   Another problem, he said, was, ``One-half of the hens in a state
might be tested and these birds could then be reinfected by
untested birds.''
   The federal Centers for Disease Control recently reported a
sixfold increase in the cases of salmonella enteritidis infections
in humans from 1977 to 1986, said Dr. Robert V. Tauxe of the
Atlanta-based CDC. He noted that between January 1985 and May 1987,
more than 2,000 cases, including 11 deaths, were reported.
   Outbreaks this year in the Northeast prompted health officials
to halt sales of eggs from at least one supplier and the formation
of a joint task force of the Food and Drug Administration and
Department of Agriculture which issued a four-point voluntary
program to reduce contamination, FDA Commissioner Dr. Frank E.
Young said.
   Young and Dr. Kenneth A. Gilles, assistant secretary of
agriculture for marketing and inspection services, conducted
Thursday's hearing on the program.
   Gilles said that while the regulatory program was distributed
``in a voluntary form, federal agencies are prepared to adopt a
mandatory alternative if the voluntary approach proves
unsuccessful.''
   McGrath and Looper were among several industry representatives
who pushed the government to make mandatory the testing and
monitoring of egg farms, slaughtering of infected laying flocks and
diverting of any healthy eggs from such flocks to breaking plants
for pasteurization as dry eggs.
   The industry representatives also urged implementation of a
compliance mechanism, research and public education.
   Looper noted the unprofitability of selling eggs for
pasteurization, and said the USDA should use its statutory powers
to enforce the regulations by seizing and eliminating the infected
flocks. However, he said he was not advocating the clause in the
law which gives the USDA the power to jail the non-complying
farmers.
   ``Shell egg consumption has decreased in the second quarter of
1988 by 7 percent,'' Looper said.
   ``Our concern for the public safety and the confidence we need
from the consumer has prompted us to take extensive action within
our industry,'' he said, noting that one egg association invested
$1 million into research.''
   Egg industry representatives also expressed concern about the
possible effect of news media coverage of the problem.
   Young replied: ``We`re not saying not to eat eggs at all, but
there is a problem at this time.''
   ``The most susceptible are the very old, the very young, those
ladies who are pregnant and people whose immune systems are
compromised _ those people with AIDS and other acquired immune
diseases,'' Young said.
   The bulletins advise high-risk consumers to avoid eating raw
eggs, lightly cooked or runny eggs and food containing raw eggs
such as homemade Caesar salad dressing, Hollandaise sauce, ice
cream, eggnog and mayonnaise. Commercial forms of these products
are safe because they are made with pasteurized eggs.
   Consumers seeking more information on handling eggs safely can
call USDA's toll-free meat and poultry hot line, 1-800-535-4555,
between 10 a.m. and 4 p.m. EDT. Washington, D.C. residents are to
call (202) 447-3333.

<HEAD>Taxpayers Will Have To Bail Out Federal S&L Insurance Fund, GAO
Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The cost of bailing out failed savings
institutions has risen so high that Congress will have to provide
regulators with more money, according to the General Accounting
Office.
   Frederick D. Wolf, director of the finance division of the
congressional watchdog agency, said he now estimates the cost of
eliminating insolvent S&Ls at $45 billion to $50 billion, up from
the $26 billion to $36 billion estimated by the agency in May.
Private analysts have estimated the cost will hit $80 billion or
more.
   Moreover, Wolf said the Federal Home Loan Bank Board's revenue
projections are ``highly optimistic,'' adding ``there is a strong
likelihood they will prove incorrect.''
   He testified to the House Banking Committee on Thursday as
debate intensified over whether taxpayer money will be needed to
bail out the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp., which is
funded currently by an assessment on the S&L industry.
   ``At this point, I would say flat out that Congress is going to
have to do this. FSLIC resources under any conceivable scenario
will not be adequate,'' he said.
   The latest estimate of red ink by the bank board, which
regulates 3,000 S&Ls, is $31 billion, well within the agency's $42
billion projection of its revenue over the next 10 years.
   Bank board chairman M. Danny Wall last week promised to release
an updated cost estimate after the fiscal year ends Sept. 30.
   A private consultant, Bert Ely of Alexandria, Va., told the
committee that the bank board already has committed itself to spend
more in aid to insolvent S&Ls in the form of promissory notes or
guarantees against loss than it can pay for through the premiums
collected from healthy institutions.
   Wolf, Ely and Rep. Fernand J. St Germain, D-R.I., chairman of
the committee, called on the bank board to issue more realistic
projections.
   ``There's no question that getting it all on the table is the
first requisite to dealing with the problem. Until the bank board
is more willing or able to lay out the problems, it's going to
fester,'' Wolf said.
   St Germain said, ``The bank board's shifting tote board is doing
nothing to enhance confidence.''
   Karl Hoyle, a spokesman for the bank board, said, ``We will
continue to be, as we have been, forthcoming with the numbers as we
derive them.''
   Hoyle also said bank board revenue projections are conservative
because they do not include any return from the agency's ownership
stake in rescued institutions.
   Wolf and Ely criticized many of the transactions in a spate of
rescues _ $13 billion worth over the last month _ as thin deals
that bring little new private money to ailing institutions.
   ``Merging several insolvent institutions into a larger entity
which remains thinly capitalized does not necessarily represent a
final resolution,'' Wolf said. ``Whether or not such institutions
can become viable entities without further assistance remains to be
seen.''

   Twenty-five years ago, a Sunday school
lesson about forgiveness ended with the blast of a bomb planted by
a Ku Klux Klansman, and four black girls lay dead. Since then,
Birmingham has learned much about forgiveness.
   The bombing at the 16th Street Baptist Church sparked outrage
that helped fuel the 1960s civil rights movement, which eventually
eased the bitter racial divisions in this city, speakers noted at a
memorial service on the anniversary Thursday night.
   ``There has been a turnabout in human relations in this city,
which now has an improved image,'' the Rev. John H. Cross told a
racially mixed congregation of 1,400 people gathered to remember
Cynthia Wesley, Addie Mae Collins and Carol Robertson, all 14, and
Denise McNair, 11.
   ``Twenty-five years ago the only blacks at City Hall were
elevator operators and janitors. Now we have Richard Arrington as
mayor,'' Cross said.
   Cross was the church's pastor on Sept. 15, 1963, when the bomb,
planted beneath basement steps, exploded after a Sunday school
lesson on the theme of a love that forgives. The girls were killed
as they were preparing to take part in a youth day program.
Twenty-two other people were injured.
   More than 40 earlier bombings had occurred in Birmingham during
the civil rights struggles of the late 1950s and early 1960s, but
no one was killed in those.
   In a service that featured freedom songs of the civil rights
movement, Arrington, who is in his third four-year term, said ``the
torch that we raise tonight is raised by two hands _ one black and
one white.''
   ``We have the power to transcend that tragic event,'' he said.
``We are determined it will have a redeeming quality.''
   Cross told the audience that he has never preached the sermon he
prepared for the morning of the bombing, and doesn't intend to.
   He said he had planned to tell young people at the church to
``anchor their lives to the solid Rock _ Jesus Christ _ the same
yesterday, today and forever.''
   A plaque in the church contains pictures of the four girls with
the inscription: ``May men learn to replace bitterness and violence
with love and understanding.''
   All lower-level windows of the church now are covered with steel
mesh, a sharp contrast to 1963, when glass shards from the windows
covered virtually every square foot on the side of the building
where the bomb exploded.
   Prior to the memorial service, black and white church
congregations served food to people gathered in Kelly Ingram Park,
a rallying spot for civil rights marches led by the Rev. Martin
Luther King Jr. in the early 1960s. Nearby is the site of a civil
rights museum planned by the city under Arrington's impetus.
   All visible racial barriers are gone in Birmingham, which has
six blacks and three whites on its City Council.
   The current pastor of the church, the Rev. James E. Young, said
Birmingham ``has provided spiritual and moral leadership to the
world for the past quarter century.''
   A retired automobile mechanic and Ku Klux Klansman, Robert
Edward Chambliss, was convicted in 1977 of murdering Miss McNair.
He died in prison after eight years.
   Miss McNair's father, Chris McNair, a former state legislator
and now a Jefferson County commissioner, said he still is not
satisfied. Although segregation in politics and business has ended,
it bothers him that most churches still are either white or black.
   ``Mankind needs the church or the synagogue,'' he said. ``This
is part of man's inner being. If they can't come together at that
time, then how are they going to come together in genuineness at
any other occasion? I have to doubt it.''

   From Aruba to Zanzibar, from Australia to
Zaire, the 1988 Olympic Games will be a television event.
   Pictures of the Games will be beamed from Seoul to virtually
every country on the globe and are expected to be seen by an
estimated 80 percent of the world's population, officials of the
International Telecommunications Satellite Organization said.
   ``With just about every country participating in the Games and
picking up the feed, the summer Olympics from Seoul will be the
most watched event in world history,'' said Tony Trujillo, a
spokesman for Intelsat.
   Intelsat is a non-profit international consortium whose global
satellite network will provide pictures of the Olympics to all 161
countries that will be represented at the Games in the next two
weeks and several others not participating.
   Trujillo said nine of Intelsat's 15 satellites will be used to
carry the feeds of hundreds of broadcasting companies and
organizations back to their home countries, where the pictures will
distributed through domestic networks.
   ``We started about seven years ago planning the international
coverage of the Games, shortly after the site for the '88 Games was
announced,'' said Arnie Meyers, Intelsat's manager of broadcast
services.
   And plans likely will be changing throughout the Games as
broadcasters from countries whose athletes are doing better than
expected request additional feeds on the satellite network, he said.
   The last event of such international viewing proportion was the
1984 summer Olympic Games in Los Angeles, when Intelsat carried
pictures of the competition on eight satellites to about 150
countries, Trujillo said.
   Technological advances this year will permit a transmission to
Japan carrying the opening and closing ceremonies in high
definition television, which produces superior picture quality and
sound.
   Japanese officials plan to use the feed to demonstrate the
technology, called HDTV, at locations in about 50 cities throughout
Japan. HDTV broadcasts are scheduled to begin in 1990 in that
country, beamed via satellite to small receiving dishes in viewers'
homes.
   All of the pictures from the 19-day competitions that are sent
outside South Korea will use the Intelsat network, including the
pictures sent by NBC-TV, which plans to telecast 179{ hours from
Seoul to American viewers.
   Most of the pictures NBC sends back to the United States will
come from the network's cameras, but ``a significant portion'' will
come from the Korean Broadcasting System, the host broadcasting
company which will provide the world feed, said Doug Kelly, an NBC
spokesman.
   Intelsat's 115 member countries own and operate the global
satellite system that is used for international video, data and
voice communications and by some countries for domestic
communications. Some 57 other countries, including the Soviet
Union, are non-member users of the network.

<HEAD>White House Sets Out Priorities for Regulatory Changes</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MATT YANCEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Reagan administration, claiming credit for
eliminating or easing thousands of federal regulations over the
past 7{ years, has 451 more ``significant'' changes it wants before
leaving office.
   But White House officials do not expect a repeat of the flurry
of new regulatory proposals that sprang from federal agencies in
the last days of President Carter's administration in January 1981.
   ``You won't see any midnight regulations, I don't think,'' White
House Budget Director James C. Miller III said Thursday.
   Miller made the comment after unveiling a 603-page report to
Congress on the status of ``rules'' that federal agencies write and
enforce for assuring everything from pizzas having enough cheese to
encouraging pharmaceutical companies to come up with a vaccine for
AIDS.
   The largest areas of anticipated regulatory activity concern
environmental and work place matters, with 98 of the proposed
actions in the Environmental Protection Agency and 91 in the Labor
Department, most of them in the Occupational Safety and Health
Administration.
   EPA, the Labor Department and the departments of Transportation
and Health and Human Services account for about 60 percent of the
anticipated regulatory activity this year, the report said.
   Of the 451 actions listed the report by the White House Office
of Management and Budget, 87 have congressionally or court-mandated
deadlines.
   Miller and other OMB officials could not say how many would cut
regulatory burdens and how many would increase them.
   ``Some of it is deregulatory in the clear sense, but that is a
relatively small part this year,'' said S. Jay Plager, the new
administrator of the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs
at OMB.
   In an opening statement at the front of the report, President
Reagan bragged that he and George Bush have ``weeded out and
eliminated wasteful, unnecessary and intrusive'' federal
environmental, safety and other regulations costing American
consumers tens of billions of dollars.
   Unlike a year ago when the White House report on the same topic
never mentioned Bush, Reagan this year shared credit with his vice
president and a task force that Bush chaired for eliminating
``unnecessary regulatory costs.''
   ``The steady but enormous progress the vice president and I have
made over the past 7{ years to improve the way government regulates
has been one of our administration's proudest achievements,'' the
president said.
   OMB officials quipped Thursday that the omission of Bush's name
in last year's report ``probably was an oversight.''
   David Plocher, an attorney for OMB Watch, a research and
advocacy group that tracks the White House budget office's role in
federal regulations, said most of the work by the Bush-chaired task
force was accomplished between 1981 and 1983.
   ``It was resurrected in 1987 to give George Bush something else
to put on his resume,'' Plocher said, ``but there has been
virtually no evidence that the resurrected task force has
accomplished anything. He got the title but he actually hasn't done
the work.''
   Miller acknowledged that the Bush task force had been relatively
inactive until the past year. But he said Bush has been the key
player in making the more than 100 agencies that issue and enforce
regulations carry out Reagan's policies.
   ``While OMB carries a great deal of clout,'' Miller said, ``it
was really the vice president whose clout mattered in getting
things done, getting agencies to turn around and look at regulatory
matters in ways they hadn't looked at them before.''

   You don't preserve a forest by putting out all
fires, ecologists observe in defending the ``let it burn'' policy
of the National Park Service.
   The forest will keep changing as plant and animal species kept
down by periodic natural fires establish themselves, and, ``You're
going to culminate in a few species that can out-compete the
others,'' said Jonathan Roughgarden, professor of biological
sciences at Stanford University.
   ``It must be understood that nothing is preserved by stopping
burning,'' said Roughgarden, who was a member of a panel for
reporters organized by the American Association for the Advancement
of Science on Thursday.
   The panel was trying to call attention to ecology, the science
that studies the relationships of organisms with their
environments. Today's issue of Science, the weekly scientific
journal of the association, has a special section on the subject.
   The word ``ecology'' is not properly a synonym for
``environment,'' Roughgarden observed at one point: ``It is not
something you should be for or against. It is simply there.''
   Others on the panel _ who were quick to point out they were not
specialists in fire ecology _ said government agencies should not
return to the days of trying to put out all fires and the Forest
Service was widely using its anti-fire cartoon symbol of Smoky the
Bear.
   However, they said revisions in the ``let it burn'' policy might
be desirable in light of the burning of half of Yellowstone
National Park this summer.
   ``A backlash returning us to Smoky the Bear would be a larger
disaster than the fires,'' said Henry Wilbur, professor of zoology
at Duke University.
   ``The worst possible thing that could happen would be to go back
to a total fire-suppression policy,'' said Robert V. O'Neill, a
research ecologist at Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Tennessee.
   Fire suppression brings ``reduced landscape diversity, which can
cause the transmission of disturbances such as fire, or a pest,''
said O'Neill. The loss of diversity is ``a brand-new problem ... a
new area of research.''
   ``There remains a good ecological basis for the plan of
controlled burning'' that government agencies follow, said
Roughgarden. ``Without fire you simply obtain an entirely different
vegetation type.''
   Though the National Park Service has been using controlled
burning in some parks, it had not been used in Yellowstone.

   Jimmy Carter say he was displeased that his
former national national security adviser, Zbigniew Brzezinski, has
become an adviser to Republican candidate George Bush.
   ``I don't like it at all,'' Carter told students at Emory
University, where he is a professor, but he praised Brzezinski for
not criticizing Carter's policy after Carter left the White House.
   Brzezinski announced Monday that he was joining the Bush
campaign.
   Carter also told the students Wednesday night that Dukakis, the
Massachusetts governor, was ``taken aback'' and ``caught by
surprise'' when Bush criticized him for vetoing a proposed law that
would have required teachers to lead students in the pledge.
   ``I think he is in a hole now,'' said Carter, a co-chairman of
Dukakis' Georgia campaign. ``If he can explain it away, it could
give him a victory or it could cost him.''

<HEAD>Kentucky Polls Gives Bush Healthy Support Among Democrats</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Republican George Bush is drawing the
support of nearly one-third of the likely Democratic voters in
Kentucky, says a new state poll that puts the vice president and
Democrat Michael Dukakis in a virtual dead heat.
   That kind of Democratic suppport for the other party's candidate
has helped Republican candidates win in six of Kentucky's last
eight presidential elections.
   The Bluegrass State Poll, published in today's Louisville
Courier-Journal, shows Bush edging Dukakis 47 percent to 45
percent. Bush also had the support of nearly 80 percent of likely

<HEAD>Actor Sheen Calls Off</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Martin Sheen called off a protest Thursday
aimed at Democratic presidential nominee Michael Dukakis during a
fund-raiser after being told such a demonstration would be in bad
form, a spokeswoman for the actor-activist said.
   The Massachusetts governor was in town to attend a fund-raiser
and a celebrity summit at the home of television producer Norman
Lear.
   Hours before the event, Sheen spokeswoman Valerie Sklarevsky
said Sheen and members of the United Farm Workers wanted Dukakis to
clarify his stance on the grape boycott and would be picketing. The
UFW contends that workers are being exposed to dangerous pesticides
in the vineyards.
   Ms. Sklarevsky then called back about an hour later and said the
protest was canceled because state Assemblyman Tom Hayden talked to
Sheen and arranged a private meeting with the actor and Dukakis.
   ``He (Sheen) was told it wouldn't look good,'' Ms. Sklarevsky
said.

   The carefully choreographed steps by the
government and opposition toward a broad-based national dialogue
represent the most significant opening in Poland's political
impasse since the 1981 martial law crackdown.
   But serious obstacles remain before any ompromise can be reached
that would bridge the chasm dividing Polish authorities from the
East bloc's largest and best-organized opposition movement.
   After their second working meeting in 16 days Thursday,
Solidarity leader Lech Walesa and Interior Minister Gen. Czeslaw
Kiszczak indicated that efforts toward round-table talks _
broad-based discussions on Poland's future _ were on track.
   Another meeting today involves for the first time other
Solidarity representatives and members of the official trade union
alliance OPZZ.
   Opposition activists appeared satisfied that authorities are
willing in principle to re-legalize Solidarity in a form yet to be
negotiated.
   ``I would say that both sides are not terribly far apart as far
as basic things are concerned,'' said pro-Solidarity journalist
Krzysztof Sliwinski.
   What remains to be seen, he said, is how different the new
Solidarity would be from the mass social movement of 1980-81.
   Ludwig Krasucki, an editor of the Communist Party monthly Nowe
Drogi, said in an interview there was a better than 50 percent
chance that union pluralism would be allowed.
   ``It cannot be easy,'' he said. ``It needs some time. And then I
think we will open a process'' of negotiation.
   The government overtures after seven years of deadlock comes
amid signs that communist authorities are psychologically prepared
to accept the permanent existence of an organized political
opposition.
   Some officially published commentaries have even gone so far as
to praise the effects of an active opposition movement.
   ``States having a strong political opposition keep developing,
while the socialist states are sinking in crisis,'' said one
particularly startling commentary in the officially published
weekly Odrozenie.
   After struggling without marked success to govern alone, the
ruling Polish United Workers (Communist) Party led by Gen. Wojciech
Jaruzelski is hoping through round-table talks with Walesa to tap
the energy of the opposition that it crushed in 1981.
   But there is a catch: whatever formula is devised, it must
somehow guarantee that the Communist Party keeps the dominant role.
   Proposals have been floated in the press, such as reserving a
significant minority of parliament seats for the opposition, or
creating a new upper chamber of parliament with limited powers
which would not have a guaranteed majority of communist deputies.
   But it is highly uncertain whether Poland's skeptical and
pragmatic opposition would ever accept anything that smacked of
tokenism or being co-opted by the system.
   Krasucki said the majority of party membership is ready for a
``big compromise'' in political reform, and that he thought
Jaruzelski would bring about the changes.
   But a grand old man of the Polish opposition movement, Socialist
Jan Jozef Lipski, said he was skeptical of any speedy promises of
reform.
   ``The direction of changes will get deeper, that's for sure,''
he said. ``But it will take much more time.''
   The government's decision to enter into talks, taken in the
midst of last month's strikes and signs that Poland's downward
economic spiral is worsening, gives the appearance of a country
coming full circle.
   Poland was also in dire economic straits in 1980 when strikes
lifted the then unknown Walesa into the role of spokesman for an
entire society's grievances.
   A tide of social unrest forced authorities then to deal with
Walesa, but over the next 15{ months it was confrontation, not
acceptance that characterized government actions toward the union.
The December 1981 martial law crackdown was merely the final blow.
   Outlawing Solidarity and detaining thousands of its supporters
only exacerbated the government's problems. The economy continued
to falter and the government had little domestic support to draw
upon when mounting foreign debt forced it into unpopular austerity
measures.
   Solidarity in turn has been frustrated by its outlaw status,
which has hampered its effectiveness as a trade union by subjecting
members to legal reprisals and preventing them from working openly
to organize factories.
   Both sides, tired and fed up with the status quo, would like to
see a change.
   Possible outlines of a compromise emerged in the first interview
with Walesa published in the official Polish press since the
martial law crackdown.
   Since authorities will not totally abandon the official trade
unions set up after Solidarity, a major question is how both
Solidarity and those unions can exist in the same workplaces.
   Speaking to the monthly Konfrontacje, Walesa cited the example
of West Germany, where multiple unions co-exist in a single factory
and negotiate jointly with management through elected workers'
councils.

<TEXT>
   Textile-state lawmakers, racing to gain
approval of their embattled import-limiting bill before Congress
adjourns, confess anxiety over fresh delays being threatened in the
House.
   ``They could outdistance us, we just don't have that much time
in this Congress,'' Sen. Ernest F. Hollings, D-S.C., said Thursday
after the Senate approved the bill 59-36 in a rerun of action it
took last week.
   Designed to protect American industry from foreign competition,
the bill won approval last week only to remain bottled up in the
Senate when opponents seized on a technicality to delay it.
   Thursday's vote freed the bill from that snarl and sent it to
the House.
   The bill would freeze textile and apparel imports at 1987 levels
and limit growth to 1 percent annually starting next year. It would
hold nonrubber footwear imports to 1987 levels and ban further
increases in foreign producers' share of the U.S. market.
   Congress has been fighting over new import curbs for three
years, with sponsors saying they are needed to save both American
jobs and an industry that is vital to the nation's defense. Critics
concede apparel companies have problems but say the textile
industry is flourishing.
   Indeed, opponents credit stepped up competition from overseas
with prodding the textile industry to modernize. They attribute a
wave of layoffs since the early 1980s to increased automation.
President Reagan vetoed an earlier version of the bill in 1985,
saying it would narrow consumer choices and cost more jobs than it
would save.
   The current version is moving slowly forward amid threats of
another presidential veto.
   ``The president's going to veto it, fortunately, and I hope that
we have the votes to sustain the veto,'' Sen. Bob Packwood, R-Ore.,
told the Senate. ``America cannot turn its back on the world. It's
going to be part of it, and, frankly, I'd rather participate in
it.''
   Textile forces had hoped that the House would give swift
approval to the four changes that the Senate made since the House
passed the bill a year ago.
   But the House Ways and Means Committee voted Wednesday to
negotiate the differences in a House-Senate conference committee.
   ``A conference just delays the time,'' Hollings complained to
reporters Thursday after the Senate's action.
   The Ways and Means action Wednesday appeared to dash textile
supporters' hopes that the Senate changes would get a stamp of
approval and a quick trip to the White House. But House Speaker Jim
Wright, D-Texas, said it was not certain the measure would go to a
conference committee.
   The president can prevent a bill from becoming law when Congress
is not in session merely by not signing it. This is called a pocket
veto. Textile forces are trying to avoid one, saying it would lower
the political price paid by the administration with elections
coming by keeping the spotlight off the issue.
   The House and Senate have set an adjournment target date of Oct.
5.
   Avoiding a pocket veto and forcing Reagan to actually use his
veto pen also just could give textile forces a chance to try for an
override and pass the measure into law over the president's
objections.
   The bill has not demonstrated that it can gain the two-thirds
support needed for an override, but Hollings said that he could
produce enough votes in the Senate if it came to a showdown.
   There are only four differences between the House and Senate
versions.
   _The House bill would freeze imports at 1986 levels and textile
forces already have said they are prepared to change that to the
1987 levels specified in the Senate version.
   _A provision of the House bill would set up a one-year pilot
program under which the government would auction off import
licenses to U.S. importing firms.
   _To muster farm support, the Senate attached a provision that
would guarantee textile-exporting nations greater quotas in the
U.S. market if they increased their purchases of American farm
goods.
   _The Senate bill would establish a special quota for imported
silk neckties; the House version has no such provision.

<HEAD>Mystery Solved: The Wishbone Is a Spring</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DANIEL Q. HANEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Harvard scientist wanting to know why birds have
wishbones believes he has found the answer.
   ``The wishbone turns out to be a spring,'' said Farish A.
Jenkins, of Harvard's biology department.
   In a report published today in the journal Science, Jenkins
described a new way of studying the inner mechanics of birds in
flight by taking movies of them with X-ray cameras. And he detailed
his first discovery with this tool _ the function of the wishbone.
   At the University of Pittsburgh, researcher Robert Raikow was as
impressed by the possibilities of X-ray movies as he was by their
initial revelation.
   ``It's a pioneering new method of studying birds,'' he said.
``We can actually see the movement of the skeletal elements during
flight. That's pretty exciting.''
   Jenkins and two colleagues, Kenneth P. Dial of Harvard and
George E. Goslow Jr. of Northern Arizona University, took X-ray
films of starlings flying in place against 20-45 mph winds in a
wind tunnel.
   The movies allowed the scientist to look at the birds' insides
and see how the various bones work during flight.
   Until now, researchers have tried to figure out such functions
by looking at the skeletons of dead birds or the outsides of live
ones.
   In their report, the researchers described the way the wishbone
bends each time a bird flaps its wings. At rest, the upper ends of
the starling's wishbone are 11 or 12 millimeters apart. But when
the wings descend, that distance stretches to 18 to 20 millimeters.
   Just why it bends this way is not clear. Jenkins said the spring
doesn't seem to help the bird beat its wings more efficiently.
Instead, he theorized that it helps the bird breathe in more air
during flight so it can burn the extra energy it needs to stay
aloft.
   When a bird breathes, air flows first into air sacs scattered
throughout its body and then into its lungs. Among these sacs is
one between the two arms of the wishbone.
   The researchers speculate that as the bird beats its wings
downward, the wishbone spreads apart, opening the air sac so it
fills with air. Then, on the upswing, the bird's sternum squeezes
the air out again.
   ``What we suspect is that there is an alternating bellows
mechanism drawing air in and out of the sac and possibly in and out
of the lung,'' said Jenkins.
   Not all birds have wishbones _ hummingbirds and some parrots are
among the exceptions _ but Jenkins believes that the starling's
wishbone spring is typical of most feathered creatures, including
the turkey.
   Until now, scientists had assumed that the bone was simply a
strut between the bird's shoulders. However, Jenkins conceded that
the wishbone's springiness is obvious to Thanksgiving Day wish
makers.
   ``This is well known to everybody in the world,'' he said.
``It's only scientists who discover the obvious.''

<HEAD>Panel Recommends Confirmation Of Cavazos As Education Secretary</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Laruo Cavazos, president of Texas Tech
University, is just one step away from becoming the nation's top
educator and the first Hispanic member of a president's Cabinet.
   The Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee on Thursday
unanimously recommended that Cavazos be confirmed as the next
education secretary. A vote by the full Senate is expected next
week.
   ``I would be very surprised if anybody voted against Larry,''
said Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas.
   Cavazos, the 61-year-old son of a south Texas cattleman and a
registered Democrat, would serve until the next president takes
office in January, although Gramm said he believed Cavazos would
stay on if George Bush wins the November election.
   President Reagan nominated Cavazos last month to succeed
outgoing Education Secretary William Bennett.
   Cavazos testified before the Senate committee last week that he
would push for increased education spending.
   ``It is vital we have a Department of Education that speaks up
for every citizen in the area of education. There is not a problem
in the United States that could not be solved with education,''
Cavazos said.
   Cavazos is the first Hispanic to serve as president of Texas
Tech, and is also the school's first graduate to hold the post. He
is president of the Texas Tech medical school, although he is not a
medical doctor.

<HEAD>Credit-Repair Clinics Draw More Attention</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TOM SEPPY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Credit-repair companies, little known before
the 1980s, have increasingly become the target of law enforcement
agencies because of their deceptive practices, say federal
officials.
   The companies promise to help remove derogatory information from
individuals' credit files, and charge as much as $2,000 for the
service.
   Ms. L. Jean Noonan, an official in the Federal Trade
Commission's bureau of consumer protection, told a House
subcommittee Thursday ``it appears that a substantial segment of
the industry engages in deceptive advertising and sales practices.''
   Kenneth P. Walton, inspector-deputy assistant director of the
FBI's criminal investiative division, told the panel of a recent
case involving Credit-Rite Inc of Palmyra, N.J., which defrauded at
least 9,000 consumers of $2.3 million in a credit-repair scheme in
15 states and the District of Columbia.
   The investigation resulted in three convictions with the
founder-president, James T. Gray, being sentenced to seven years in
prison, Jeffrey Roberts, former director of franchising, receiving
a prison sentence of 15 months, and David Gray, credit-repair
manager, receiving three years probation.
   The clinics take advantage of the law that gives consumers the
right to challenge the information about them that credit bureaus
have on file. This provision requires a credit bureau to verify the
information upon request, generally within 30 days. If verification
is not completed on time, the disputed data must be deleted.
   Under the law, individuals who feel their credit records have
inaccuracies can go directly to a local credit bureau and ask that
they be corrected. However, accurate derogatory information can
remain as part of an individual's credit history for seven years
or, in the case of a bankruptcy, for 10 years.
   Walter R. Kurth, president of Associated Credit Bureaus Inc., a
trade association representing over 1,200 consumer credit bureaus,
said, ``The wrong being committed by credit clinics is the promise
held out to intimidated consumers, that by some magic a credit
clinic can accomplish things that the consumer cannot accomplish
and that false promises, rooted in half truths, will cost the
consumer several hundred dollars or more.
   ``The illness of a poor credit history can only be cured by time
and careful reconstruction of a consumer's payment history with
creditors in the future,'' Kurth told the House Banking consumer
affairs subcommittee.
   The subcommittee is considering legislation, introduced by
Chairman Frank Annunzio, D-Ill., which would restrict the practices
of credit-repair clinics.

<TEXT>
   The nation's first college croquet
court will be dedicated next week to the professor who raised
$16,000 to build it, despite what he described as Smith College's
embarrassment by the playing field.
   ``My level of enthusiasm (for the dedication ceremony) is not
particularly high by this time,'' said Richard B. Young, a
literature professor emeritus. ``The playing court has been around
for months.''
   The 105-by-84-foot manicured lawn is the first regulation
croquet court on an American college campus. It was built last year
with donations from alumnae and friends.
   College President Mary Maples Dunn will shoot the first wicket
at the Sept. 24 ceremony naming the court after Young. Smith's team
will give a demonstration of the sport, which evokes images of
gentry in white dress.
   The field's first tournament opened to little fanfare last April
at the 2,000-student school, and Young said at the time that the
school was embarrassed by the court.
   ``I'm told that this court promotes the idea that Smith is
elitist,'' he said. ``If it weren't, they'd be out of business.''
   The dedication ceremony planned for that tournament was
postponed because Dunn was out of town, college spokeswoman Debra
Bradley said.
   She said Thursday that the ceremony was rescheduled for
September because Dunn ``wanted the dedication to coincide with a
tournament so people could see the field being used.'' The ceremony
kicks off a weekend tournament involving New England Collegiate
Croquet Association teams.
   The college has denied that the dedication delay had any
connection to a survey that found many students and staff consider
the school elitist.
   Young, 66, who lost one leg and suffered a crippling injury to
his other foot during World War II, had given up on sports until he
discovered croquet and founded the Smith team.
   He said he was ``of course extremely pleased by the naming of
the field,'' but added: ``The timing doesn't galvanize me.''

<HEAD>Cable From Jamaica: `Emergency Conditions. Total Devastation'</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Television commercials still were inviting
viewers to ``come back to Jamaica'' on Tuesday when a Madison
Avenue advertising executive managed to get a telex from Kingston
to his home office.
   ``Emergency conditions. Total devastation. ... Cancel all TV and
print advertising. Appeal as a national disaster.''
   Account supervisor Edward Daley's dramatic cable to Young &
Rubicam Inc. was one of the first attempts by the tourism industry
to deal with the devastation wrought by Hurricane Gilbert, the
century's strongest storm.
   There were few attempts at boosterism Thursday as tourism
officials attempted to assess the damage and help stranded tourists
get home.
   Travel agents, tour operators and airline spokesmen said they
were offering rebookings or refunds to anyone who had booked trips
for this week or this weekend. For trips farther into the future,
policies varied.
   A surprising number of tourists did not want to reschedule.
   ``It's amazing. People think the storm just came and went and
not much really happened,'' said Sisi Gulmez, president of
Magnatours Inc., which specializes in Mexico's Cancun. ``Our future
bookings may have slowed down but they have not stopped by any
means.''
   In Beverly Hills, Calif., travel agency employee Bradley Jones
said he was holding his reservations for Cancun this Tuesday, at
least for now.
   ``I'm thinking of just landing and see what it's like,'' Jones
said. ``I was thinking of doing some camping anyway.''
   Despite the proliferation of television and newspaper reports
from Jamaica, tourism officials said the island remained largely
cut off from the outside world.
   ``We have been answering questions, but it's very perplexing for
us _ the frustration because we don't know what's going on,'' said
Louise Munsch, director of operations and reservations for Sunburst
Holidays, one of the major bookers of trips to Jamaica.
   Sunburst was offering refunds to anyone who had bookings for the
next 10 days. Munsch said most customers with later bookings seemed
to be waiting for more information before deciding whether to
cancel.
   Still, she said, ``I'd be lying to you if I said I wasn't
concerned.''
   Most of the damage so far was in Jamaica, the Cayman Islands and
Mexico's Yucatan peninsula, raising the possibility that other
Caribbean resorts could benefit from the spillover.
   On Thursday, for example, two cruise ships docked unexpectedly
in Puerto Rico's San Juan harbor. But Lauren Yankus, a spokeswoman
for Puerto Rico Tourist Co., said the organization did not want to
seem to encourage such detours for fear of seeming to take
advantage of others' misery.
   One consolation was that tourism is relatively light in
September, largely because people don't like to visit the islands
during hurricane season, said Jack Bloch, owner of JB's World
Travel Consultants in New York.
   Commercial flights out of Jamaica resumed Thursday on a limited
basis. Only daytime flights were possible because electricity was
not fully restored at either airport, said Dinaz Boga, a
spokeswoman for Air Jamaica in New York.
   There were plans for about seven flights today, she said.
   In Mexico, Mexicana Airlines spokeswoman Ruth Shari reported
late Thursday she had received word there was no major damage to
hotels.
   Club Med Inc. had planes standing by waiting to carry home
guests from its Cancun resort as soon as airports reopened, said
Jean-Luc Oizan-Chapon, the chief operating officer.
   Ms. Shari said there was a chance the airport in Merida, about
four hours by car from Cancun, could open by today.
   Hurricane Gilbert did not seem to upset Continental Airlines,
which chose Wednesday to announce its first expansion into the
Caribbean, including daily flights to Jamaica. The service begins
Dec. 16.
   One man still stranded in Jamaica on Thursday was Daley, the ad
man. The roof blew off Daley's hotel Monday night and the phones
were dead, but associates at Young & Rubicam said he managed to
find a Japanese employee of the Mitsui & Co. trading company who
cabled his message here Tuesday.
   After taking care of business, Daley wrote, ``Tell family father
is OK. Home this weekend (hope).''

   The head of the Environmental Protection
Agency said he won't issue any last-minute ``midnight regulations''
as the Reagan administration comes to a close.
   EPA Administrator Lee M. Thomas, in remarks to reporters
Thursday, named only four major regulations he would try to
complete before leaving office in January.
   Thomas said he also would try to nail down arrangements for an
international conference in the next administration to strengthen a
treaty limiting chlorofluorocarbon emissions.
   ``I'm trying to make decisions that are logical and natural, not
speeding it up or slowing it down,'' Thomas said.
   The four major regulations he said he would press for are:
   _New controls on gasoline volatility.
   _Requiring larger gasoline vapor recovery systems on cars.
   _Eventually banning the manufacture or import of asbestos and
asbestos products.
   _Revising the major regulation governing the ``Superfund'' toxic
waste cleanup program.
   Thomas said he was hoping to see the approval of several pieces
of legislation, including a revision of the Clean Air Act setting
new deadlines for cities to comply with federal clean air standards.
   He also held out hope for these other legislative actions:
   _A revision of federal pesticide laws setting deadlines for the
agency to review old chemicals and abolishing the requirement that
the agency pay for inventories of banned products
   _A bill providing $10 million to aid state programs dealing with
radon pollution in the home.
   _A bill clarifying the agency's authority over medical waste.
   ``These are the natural kinds of things for me to complete,''
Thomas said.
   In 1981, the incoming Reagan administration accused Douglas
Costle, EPA administrator for President Carter, as well as heads of
other agencies of hastily putting out regulations and making other
decisions to pre-empt what the new administration could do.
Reagan's appointees revoked several of those actions.
   ``We're not going to wield the signature machine all night long
on Jan. 19,'' Thomas said.

   As vice presidential candidate Lloyd Bentsen took
the stage carrying Michael Dukakis' message for the South, the
event resembled a reunion for Democrats who once worked together
and won the White House.
   The Texas senator was flanked by Tennessee's top elected
officials _ Gov. Ned Ray McWherter and Sens. Albert Gore and James
Sasser. The audience was filled with cheering local sheriffs,
school board members and party activists.
   ``I know what's happened the last two presidential elections,''
Bentsen told the Shelby County Democratic Party fund-raiser
Thursday night. ``You've seen some of our Democratic friends go
into that voting booth, pull that curtain, and vote for Ronald
Reagan.
   ``Now, we understand that, and we respect that,'' he said,
pausing before the punch line: ``But now we're saying, `Democrats
who voted for Reagan, welcome home, welcome back to our party.'''
   The crowd roared.
   The Dukakis campaign knows that Bentsen can repeat that scene in
the South and Southwest, and it can only hope that the effort will
help score a win on Nov. 8 for the Democratic ticket.
   Tad Devine, who watches the polls and directs the vice
presidential campaign from Dukakis-Bentsen headquarters in Boston,
says Bentsen is ``an effective tool'' for convincing conservative
Democrats they can vote for the Massachusetts governor.
   ``I expect that he'll continue to sort of `credential' Governor
Dukakis before these audiences,'' Devine said in a telephone
interview. ``Everywhere he's been so far, he's been very well
received in terms of the political impact,'' including extensive
coverage and interviews with the local press.
   But there are doubts outside the campaign.
   ```Credentialing' is an academic approach to saying the fella
can't stand on his own two feet,'' said Claibourne Darden, an
Atlanta-based pollster and consultant whose clients include Sen.
Sam Nunn, D-Ga. ``It's like getting a Ph.D. because you can't get a
job.''
   While it's smart for Bentsen to focus on the South and Southwest
_ ``You fish where the fish bite,'' he said _ the vice presidential
candidate can only open the door for the presidential candidate to
walk through.
   ``The question is, how capable is Michael Dukakis at walking
through these doors in the South? The answer so far is not so
good,'' Darden said in a telephone interview.
   Larry Harrington, the Dukakis-Bentsen campaign's Southern
regional director, said the evidence was to the contrary. In the
Memphis hotel ballroom, he pointed out local officials who wouldn't
be caught near the two previous Democratic tickets.
   ``They call them leaders, but really they tend to follow the
voters,'' he said. ``They're still moving toward the ticket.
They're with the ticket.''
   But Harrington acknowledged that Bentsen's easy popularity with
Southern Democrats who voted for Reagan wasn't enough.
   ``You're definitely going to see Dukakis follow up'' with more
Southern trips himself, he said, citing the governor's previous
Southern swings. ``I don't think he (Bentsen) closes the deal.''
   Harrington declined to say which Southern states the Democrats
believe they are capable of winning but Bentsen's schedule this
week follows the scenario the campaign acknowledges privately.
   Besides his native Texas, which is a neck-and-neck battle,
Bentsen was hunting for votes in Louisiana, Tennessee, North
Carolina and Florida. He was in Southern California just last
weekend.
   Lance Tarrance, a Houston-based political consultant for the
GOP, said Oklahoma, Arkansas and Louisiana also were states where
Bentsen helps the Democratic ticket.
   ``But let's be frank _ it's California and Texas,'' with their
47 and 29 electoral votes, the Democrats were after, Tarrance said.
   And although Bentsen had a lot of pride tied up in the Texas
race, ``California is the one that really hurts the Republicans if
it goes to the Democrats,'' he said. Bentsen helped in Southern
California in areas where Dukakis was weak, he said.
   The deep South, especially states such as Alabama, South
Carolina and Mississippi, was very unlikely to produce a win for
the Democrats.
   ``The South because of the Reagan presidency is very strong for
Bush,'' Tarrance said, and Bentsen's strength was more to the West
in oil-producing areas.
   Harrington said it was too early to write off any state,
although he said obviously some were tougher for the Democrats than
others.
   For cautious Southerners, Bush's choice for his running mate,
Dan Quayle, presented problems for the GOP and an opening for
Bentsen and Dukakis, he said.
   ``You can say `President Quayle' in a room full of people and
you get a combination of laughter and look of fear,'' he said.
``Every so often, the vice president tragically has to take that
office.''
   Darden said that while Quayle was unquestionably not as
palatable a vice presidential candidate to Southerners as Bentsen,
he doubted the Texan's presence was having a major impact. He said
people also tended to overestimate the impact of having
locally-elected officials back the ticket.
   ``A lot of people overplay the importance of the
establishment,'' he said. Bentsen ``appeals to that upper middle
class Southern white, and it's hard to peel off that vote from a
Republican.''
   Devine said he expected Bentsen to continue to focus on Texas
and the South and Southwest.
   ``He's not going to just campaign in the South, however,'' he
said. Trips elsewhere ``reinforce his standing as a national
candidate'' and that plays well in Texas and elsewhere, he said.

<HEAD>President Hosts `Simple, 14-Course Supper' For Lawmakers</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: SUBS 3rd, 24 grafs to correct punctuation</NOTE>

<TEXT>
   As Tom Foley said, it was just ``a simple,
14-course picnic supper'' as President Reagan played host for a
congressional barbecue laced with tart lyrics by a troupe of former
Capitol Hill aides.
   Foley, the Democrat from Washington state who is House majority
leader, traded pleasantries with Reagan at the conclusion of the
annual event on the White House lawn Thursday, which will be the
last for the president and first lady Nancy Reagan.
   As lawmakers and administration officials dined on food from
four tents _ giving them their choice of seafood, Cajun, Western or
Mexican cuisine _ entertainnment was provided by the Capitol Steps,
a group formed six years ago at a Capitol Christmas party.
   The Reagans joined in the applause as the Steps aimed their
satire both at the Reagan administration and Vice President George
Bush.
   The president laughed heartily, for instance, as a member of the
troupe impersonating the Republican presidential nominee, who has
been charting an increasingly independent course, sang:
   ``I sorta ... kinda ... remotely ...
   ``Distantly wanna be like you.''
   In another skit, a singer representing Bush sang to the tune of
``September Song'':
   ``Try to remember
   ``That date in September
   ``The day Japan
   ``Attacked Pearl Harbor.''
   The audience erupted in laughter at the reference to Bush's
speech at an American Legion convention in Louisville on Sept. 7,
in which he said that that day, instead of Dec. 7, was the
anniversary of the attack that plunged the United States into World
War II.
   Democratic nominee Michael S. Dukakis did not get off scot free,
either, as the singers hymned a presidential campaign pitting the
``Duke of Dullness'' against ``Sir George of Kennebunkport.''
   Reagan even burst into laughter at what was probably the
harshest satire of the evening, one in which he was represented as
musing upon his place in history and intoning:
   ``Well ...
   ``Don't know much about history
   ``Don't know much about geography
   ``Don't know much about World War II
   ``Don't know much about who fought who
   ``But I know it followed World War I
   ``If we only fought in the wars we won
   ``What a wonderful world this would be.''
   In his concluding remarks, the president said, ``I want to thank
the Capitol Steps for showing such _ mercy. Now you're all under
arrest.''
   Noting that it would be the last such affair he would host, the
president said, ``After 6 o'clock, we all take off the cleats and
come together as friends and colleagues.''
   Foley told the president, ``Unanimously, we wish you and Mrs.
Reagan thanks, first of all for your many courtesies, and secondly,
as you go in, not to a retirement but a different part of your life
in which I know you'll be concerned as you have been for the future
of this country and for its role in the world, the best of every
happiness, success and satisfaction.''

   The first American tourists back from Jamaica since
it was overrun by Hurricane Gilbert were thankful to escape though
they conceded they got out relatively unscathed.
   ``The tourists were much more fortunate than most of the
Jamaicans,'' Charles McKenney said Thursday after clearing customs
at Miami International Airport.
   ``There are some people there who haven't had food or water for
several days. But most hotels took care of their guests.''
   ``The worst part was not being able to contact anyone to let
them know how you were,'' said the New Smyrna Beach resident's
wife, Joanna.
   With their luggage, passengers arriving here brought tales of
devastation in the villages and inconveniences in the resorts.
   ``There were no lights, no running water,'' said Eileen Veskey
of Detroit, who stayed in her 14th-floor Montego Bay hotel room as
the hurricane blew through the island Monday.
   ``We were going to the pools for water to flush the toilets.''
   But tourists who arrived here Thursday on an Eastern Airlines
flight said few hotels or resorts were without some drinking water
or food.
   As the Miami-bound plane lifted off the Montego Bay runway,
cheers rang out, and when it landed here, tourists were still
celebrating.
   ``We're home,'' said Dr. Paulette Roy, 65, of New York City.
``Oh yes, we're very happy to be back.''
   Gilbert, one of the century's strongest hurricanes, passed over
Jamaica with 175-mph winds that destroyed homes and farms and cut
off electricity and communication throughout the island, where at
least 26 people were killed. The Montego Bay airport reopened
Thursday.
   ``The island is still in pretty bad shape,'' said Jim Cullipher,
one of 44 Palm Beach County travel agents who had been trapped in
Montego Bay by the storm. ``It seems we won't be sending people to
Jamaica for a while.''
   But in the Cayman Islands, W. Norman Bodden, the tourism
minister, said visitors can begin returning to the three-island
chain that was spared serious damage from Gilbert. Resorts and most
of the homes on the islands received only minor damage, he said.
   ``Things should be back to almost normal for visitors by Monday
or Tuesday,'' Bodden said at a news conference. He flew to Miami
after waiting out the hurricane in the Caymans.
   He said government officials next week will examine whether the
hurricane damaged the islands' reefs, one of the Caribbean's most
popular diving spots. Bodden estimated tourism, the country's
biggest industry, brings about $145 million annually.

   Here is the 228-182 roll call Thursday by
which the House deleted from a drug bill a provision requiring a
seven-day waiting period for the purchase of handguns, substituting
instead a vaguely defined system for identifying convicted felons
seeking to buy handguns.
   A ``yes'' vote is a vote to eliminate the waiting period from
the bill.
   Voting yes were 101 Democrats and 127 Republicans.
   Voting no were 137 Democrats and 45 Republicans.
   X denotes those not voting.
   Present denotes those who voted they were ``present'' at the
time of the vote but did not vote ``yes'' or ``no'' on the issue.
   There are three vacancies in the 435-member House.

<HEAD>Emergency Planners Step Up Preparations For Gilbert</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal emergency planners say they've moved
into high gear in preparing to help remedy whatever damage is
inflicted on south Texas by Hurricane Gilbert.
   Trucks, equipment and personnel were readied Thursday for quick
dispatch to Texas as Gilbert, with maximum sustained winds of 120
mph, marched on across the Gulf of Mexico.
   ``We are bringing every resource we have up to maximum
operational capability in preparedness of relocating and mitigating
this problem,'' said Grant C. Peterson, in charge of the natural
disaster program at the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
   The Pentagon said aircraft at naval air stations all along the
Texas coastline were dispatched to a civilian airport in Midland,
Sheppard Air Force Base and Biggs Army Airfield, all in Texas.
   Navy personnel and dependents were sent to Lackland Air Force
Base, 130 miles inland.
   Naval ships in the Gulf of Mexico were sent out to sea to avoid
the storm.
   Army Maj. Gen. J.D. Smith said procedures were streamlined to
ensure ``this is not a bureaucratic slow-moving turtle.''
   The Pentagon agreed to dispatch active duty military personnel
to back up the Texas National Guard if necessary.
   ``I think it is fair to say that we recognize that we face the
greatest weather threat that we have ever faced in our part of the
country. We want to be certain our preparation is up to the
challenge,'' said Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas.
   Peterson and Gramm said paperwork had already been prepared to
allow President Reagan to almost immediately issue a disaster
declaration and set relief efforts in motion, cutting through the
five to seven days usually needed.
   Peterson said federal agencies would dispatch Spanish-speaking
personnel and Spanish-language forms and pamphlets to help
communication with the sizeable Hispanic population along the coast.
   The American Red Cross said it also had begun sending emergency
supplies to four hurricane ``watch'' districts at several Texas
cities.
   The Red Cross said thousands of blankets, cots, comfort kits and
cleanup kits were on their way to Corpus Christi, Harlingen,
Houston and Beaumont, Texas. In addition, volunteers and staff
members were sent to San Antonio, Texas, and Birmingham, Ala.,
staging areas for deployment after the storm hits.

<HEAD>Reagan Expected To Sign Spy Satellite Bill</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Reagan is expected to sign a bill to
modernize the nation's spy satellite network as part of
intelligence agency activities over the coming year,.
   Precise provisions of the measure, which was approved by
Congress on Thursday, have not been revealed.
   The Senate approved by voice vote a compromise measure which the
House had passed a day earlier.
   The Senate Intelligence Committee initiated the major
modernization program for electronic spying after concluding that
U.S. photo and eavesdropping satellites are growing outmoded. The
nation's spy capabilities in space have not been substantially
updated in a decade.
   In reviewing how well the United States could verify Soviet
compliance with the new Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces, or INF,
treaty, the panel found that monitoring technology would be
inadequate if the superpowers reach later agreement on deep cuts in
long-range nuclear weapons.
   A compromise was reached with the Reagan administration on the
amount of money needed for the program, but it was uncertain
whether Congress will appropriate the funds.
   That issue is tied up in a dispute over a separate Pentagon
appropriations bill.
   The House Appropriations Committee opposes the initiative,
saying it has been too hastily conceived and would not
substantially enhance U.S. treaty-monitoring ability.
   The exact amounts for the spy satellite program and the overall
intelligence budget are secret, but total spending on U.S.
intelligence programs reportedly is approximately $25 billion.
Nearly all of the money is hidden in the Pentagon's budget.
   Among other provisions in the intelligence bill:
   _Stronger language prohibiting the government from aiding
Nicaragua's Contra rebels unless specifically authorized by
Congress. The issue became controversial during the Iran-Contra
affair when the Reagan administration insisted prohibitions on
intelligence agencies aiding the rebels did not extend to the
president's National Security Council staff. The new legislation
bars any ``entity'' of the government from unauthoried aid to the
Contras, which would include the NSC.
   _A requirement that the Central Intelligence Agency report to
Congress about the activities of the agency's internal inspector
general, who investigates allegations of wrongdoing. The provision
also would require the CIA director to tell congressional overseers
any time he bars the inspector general from undertaking a specific
investigation.
   The only dollar amounts mentioned in the unclassified version of
the intelligence bill were a $23.7 million authorization for the
244-member intelligence community staff, which serves the CIA
director in his role of coordinator of all government intelligence
activities; $15.1 million for FBI counterintelligence activities in
keeping tabs on Soviet inspectors at U.S. weapons sites under the
INF treaty; and $144.5 million for the CIA's retirement and
disability fund.

   They were told to bring their own
food, drinks and blankets, but warned to leave their pets, booze
and guns at home. And they did.
   As Hurricane Gilbert, perhaps the most-feared storm of its kind,
approached the Texas coast, residents fled their homes, taking
bedrolls and food supplies to Red Cross shelters on higher ground.
   In this southernmost Texas city, where the eye of Gilbert was
predicted to pass sometime this evening, 750 people filled the
civic auditorium to its capacity within four hours, while hundreds
of others crowded into schools.
   For some, their flight to the shelters was reminiscent of
Hurricane Beulah, which struck Brownsville in 1980 and Hurricane
Allen, which landed north of Brownsville the same year.
   ``We brought food, water, some milk, but my husband forgot the
stereo and all our medicine, but I think we will be all right,''
said 77-year-old Maria Cardenas, a diabetic in a wheelchair.
   Families staked out perimeters on the floor of the civic center,
placing blankets, sheets and pillows on the floor next to bags of
food and ice chests filled with meats and soft drinks.
   Some children brought their plastic toys and some brought their
teddy bears while others turned on their small radios and tuned in
to news of the storm.
   ``Most of the people who come here or to other shelters in the
(Rio Grande) Valley are those who don't have transportation to go
north,'' said Ersel Lantz, head of the Red Cross effort at the
civic center.
   ``We have all kinds of people here, from those that need
Pampers, to those that need wheelchairs,'' he said.
   Frank Sanchez, 19, said he boarded up the home of mother and
grandparents in nearby Olmito and drove them to the civic center.
   ``We just decided this was the best place to be because of all
the predictions of damage it could cause,'' Sanchez said.
   Maria Elena Silva, 34, brought her children to the shelter
because she feared staying in her second-story apartment.
   ``We know that there might be an emergency and we don't have a
car and we knew we could come here where there are a lot of people
and if something happened, we knew we could get something if we
needed it,'' Ms. Silva said.
   Ricky Saldierna, 7, said would rather be at home.
   ``I think this hurricane is very bad because it could hurt
somebody, especially some kids like me,'' he said. ``I wish we were
in school now and I wish we were back in our own house.''

<HEAD>Two Losing Candidates Get Seats In Parliament</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KENNETH L. WHITING</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SINGAPORE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Only one opposition candidate was elected
earlier this month, but two of the losers will be appointed to join
him in Parliament under a controversial measure designed to ensure
opposing voices are heard.
   The measure, whereby the two members will get
``non-constituency'' seats, was introduced before the last polls in
1984 by amending the constitution to create limited opposition,
after the People's Action Party won every seat in the four previous
general elections.
   The PAP has been in power since 1959 under Prime Minister Lee
Kuan Yew.
   Lee said that in two years of Cabinet discussion such
alternatives as proportional representation and a second chamber in
Parliament were considered and rejected as unsuitable for this
island republic of 2.6 million people.
   Opposition politicians condemned the new measure as a means of
perpetuating PAP rule.
   Chaim See Tong of the Singapore Democratic Party was the only
opposition candidate to win at the polls on Sept. 3. The PAP took
80 of 81 seats _ 11 of them unopposed _ and 64.6 percent of the
valid votes cast.
   Chaim, who was first elected in 1984, repeated his rejection of
non-constituency seats Sunday.
   According to the measure, the seats are offered to the three
best performers among the opposition losers. If one or two
opposition candidates manage to win at the polls, as Chaim did,
extra seats are added up to a total of three.
   Those appointed must have polled at least 15 percent of the vote
in their constituencies and must belong to a political party.
   They enjoy most of the rights and privileges of the other 81
Parliament members and can speak on any issue. But they cannot vote
on no-confidence motions, proposals to amend the constitution or
bills to supply funds to the government or tax money from the
people. They represent no constituency.
   Opposition parties rejected the one appointment offered after
the 1984 election when Chaim and Workers' Party leader J.B.
Jeyaretnam were voted into Parliament.
   Jeyaretnam denounced the measure then as ``a ruse to try to keep
the electorate thinking of the PAP as the only government,
providing for everything, including opposition MPs.''
   Jeyaretnam still heads the Workers' Party but was ousted from
Parliament and disqualified for five years from 1986 for allegedly
falsifying party records.
   After a week of heated intra-party debate, Jeyaretnam announced
Saturday that two of its losers would accept the offer to enter
Parliament. If he had said no, seats would have been offered to the
next two highest-polling losers.
   Jeyaretnam said his party remained opposed to the concept of
non-constituency seats and its acceptance of them should not ``be
regarded as a precedent for the party's decision in future cases.''
   The Workers' Party will be represented by lawyer Francis Seow
and a physician, Lee Siew Choh.
   Seow, 59, a former solicitor general and president of the Law
Society, is a newcomer to party politics and was widely expected to
run as an independent.
   He was released on July 16 after 72 days in jail under the
country's Internal Security Act, which permits detention without
trial. The government alleged that Seow conspired with U.S.
diplomats to increase the parliamentary opposition to the
government.
   However, he has since been accused of income tax evasion and
faces trial in December. If convicted, Seow would lose his
Parliament seat.

<HEAD>New Warhol Jewel Cache Discovered in Hidden File Drawers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A year-and-a-half after his death, Andy Warhol
has sprung another surprise: hundreds of diamonds, sapphires and
other jewelry worth $1.2 million and found hidden in a file cabinet.
   Curators uncovered the secret cache at the artist's Manhattan
townhouse, Sotheby's announced Thursday.
   The value of the jewelry was put at $1.2 million. But as last
spring's auction proved, anything associated with Warhol is likely
to sell for far more than its book value.
   Sotheby's said two curators were moving file cabinets at the
townhouse in June when they discovered the jewels stashed in
false-bottom drawers.
   The find included hundreds of diamonds, dozens of sapphires and
a 300-carat emerald, Sotheby's said. There also were 96 watches by
such makers as Patek Philippe, Rolex and Cartier.
   The jewelry will be auctioned Dec. 4, with proceeds going to the
Andy Warhol Foundation.
   At the earlier auction, jewelry that had been valued at
approximately $500,000 brought in $1.9 million as a frenzy of
Warholmania sent prices of his art and belongings soaring.
   The flat file cabinets with the jewels had been used by Warhol
to store unframed drawings and prints. They had been examined
before last spring's auction, but no one noticed the hollow
bottoms, Sotheby's spokesman Matthew Weigman said.
   The curators discovered the false bottoms only after they
removed the bottom drawers to lighten the cabinets before moving
them, he said.
   Warhol died in February 1987 at age 58.

   Hurricane Gilbert's growth from a harmless low
pressure zone off Africa to a ferocious killer in the Gulf of
Mexico was fueled by a combination of heat, moisture and wind that
baffles forecasters.
   ``It's a matter of getting everything together in the right
place in the right time,'' Gil Clark of the National Hurricane
Center said Thursday. ``It doesn't happen very often. How it
develops, we don't know.''
   Gilbert came to the attention of center forecasters Sept. 3 as a
dry low pressure trough moving west out of Africa.
   ``We get 50 or 60 of these off Africa every summer. About one of
six develop,'' said Clark.
   By Sept. 8, the system became a depression. It reached tropical
storm status by Saturday and a hurricane Sunday.
   A tropical wave becomes a depression when winds start swirling.
When sustained winds reach 39 mph, the system becomes a named
tropical storm. It reaches hurricane status when sustained winds
hit 74 mph.
   Why Gilbert organized and strengthened while other systems
didn't ``is a mystery more or less,'' said University of Miami
meteorology Professor Rainer Bleck.
   ``The first part of the summer we were biting our nails,
wondering why these (other) disturbances didn't develop,'' he said
Thursday. ``That's something meteorologists would like to know more
about.''
   But the scientists do know what fuels a budding storm once
development begins. And they know that development is sparked when
winds converge, and that growth is affected by time and place.
   ``If that happens in an area where there's plenty of moisture in
the lower atmosphere (the bottom 10,000 feet or so), this
convergence may lead to upward motion and cloud formation,'' Bleck
said.
   ``If clouds form, the heat of condensation in the clouds
occasionally provides `positive feedback' to the convergence
pattern. That strengthens it,'' he said, adding that storms can
begin budding only off the equator because of the Earth's rotation.
   Eventually, a vortex is created.
   ``Any time you contract an air mass, they will start spinning.
That's what makes the tornadoes, hurricanes and blizzards, those
winter storms,'' Bleck said.
   Hurricanes ``are useful to the climate machine. Their primary
role is to transport heat from the lower to the upper atmosphere,''
he said. ``The sun puts energy into the water, the top of the
oceans and lowest part of the atmosphere. That has to be
distributed from the bottom to higher levels of the atmosphere.''
   When the depression that would become Gilbert neared Barbados,
warm Atlantic waters nurtured it.
   ``This time of year in the northwest Caribbean is best for
development,'' Clark said. ``If you get a storm in this area in
September, when the water's warmest, it can just explode. This is
where Camille formed and exploded,'' referring to the 1969 storm
that slammed into the Gulf Coast.
   ``It is an exciting thing to watch. If you're on the beach
watching the storm surge, it's a different story,'' he said.
   The hurricane center said Gilbert was the most intense storm on
record in terms of barometric pressure, measured at 26.13 inches
Tuesday night. That broke the 26.35 inches of the 1935 hurricane
that devastated the Florida Keys.

   Prime Minister Edward Seaga ordered
police to ensure that gasoline stations and stores open today after
Hurricane Gilbert pounded the island, killing at least 26 people
and leaving 500,000 homeless.
   Seaga declared much of the island a disaster area Thursday night
and invoked special emergency powers to push forward with an
enormous cleanup effort. The powers allow the government to
requisition private vehicles and heavy equipment to distribute
vital supplies to the hardest hit areas.
   ``The purpose of this period of public emergency is to ensure
the restoration of normality as quickly as possible in the most
affected areas,'' Seaga said in a nationwide radio broadcast.
   Gilbert pounded into Jamaica's east coast Monday, its 145 mph
winds smashing the length of the island, severely damaging or
destroying 80 percent of the country's 500,000 homes. Seaga
estimated damage at $8 billion, and officials estimated the death
toll could rise when they regain communications with the interior.
   Five people were reported killed in the Dominican Republic and
10 in Haiti, where the military government declared its own state
of emergency on the southern peninsula.
   The disaster area contains more than 1 million of this Caribbean
island nation's 2.3 million people and embraces four of Jamaica's
14 parishes, or counties, on the badly hit east coast _ Kingston,
St. Andrew, St. Catherine and St. Thomas.
   Seaga also authorized the police to see that gasoline stations
and stores selling food, hardware, drugs and fuel were opened for
business by 8 a.m. today.
   Even before Seaga's action, people were on the move, cleaning up
the damage. Telephone crews replaced snapped utility poles and set
up hundreds more that had lain toppled alongside or across just
about every street in Kingston, the capital.
   Phone service was re-established by midmorning in the Kingston
area, though lines destroyed in the island's eastern region were
expected to take months to replace.
   The Jamaican Defense Force, police, firefighters and rescue
crews were joined by thousands of volunteers in clearing streets
and sidewalks of debris _ trees, rocks, glass shards, bricks,
pieces of smashed furniture.
   Hundreds of foreign tourists stranded on the island by Gilbert
filled Kingston's battered Norman Manley Airport as commercial
flights resumed. At Montego Bay on the island's north side, the
international airport also resumed service.
   The prime minister appeared to acknowledge the volunteer spirit,
saying ``I expect full cooperation from the public so that none of
the emergency powers will have to be used. With full cooperation, I
expect that the period of public emergency will be brief.''
   Seaga said the government's top priorities are to provide
shelter for the homeless and assure adequate food supplies.
   Few downtown Kingston buildings escaped unscathed. The National
Gallery's windows were blown out, exposing paintings to passers-by
on the street.
   ``People are trying to do what they can do,'' said Kingston taxi
driver Samuel Alice. ``They're trying to get some food and trying
to get some shelter.''
   At the Pegasus, one of Kingston's luxury hotels, workers fished
deck chairs and tables from a swimming pool, while another crew
cleared the smashed remnants of its mammoth satellite dish.
   Nearby, two regulars determined to resume their daily routine
cleared away the blown-out roof of the hotel tennis clubhouse and
played three quick sets.
   With electricity still out Thursday night, stranded tourists in
Kingston sat in muggy, candlelit bars, sipping warm drinks and beer.
   Gilbert strengthened from a tropical storm into a hurricane
Saturday night 160 miles south of Puerto Rico. It skirted the
Dominican Republic and Haiti on Sunday, plowed straight through
Jamaica on Monday, brushed past the Cayman Islands Tuesday and
slammed into the Yucatan Peninsula Wednesday morning. The hurricane
today headed toward northern Mexico and southeastern Texas.

   When Republican vice presidential
candidate Dan Quayle told reporters he ``didn't live in this
century,'' some thought for a moment they really had a scoop.
   But it was just the latest example of Quayle's occasional
tendency to garble his words when, as is his wont, he speaks
extemporaneously rather than from a written text.
   On Thursday, Quayle got wrapped up at a news conference in a
question about the Holocaust. What was his opinion of that time, in
which six million Jews were executed under Adolf Hitler, he was
asked.
   ``It was an obscene period in our nation's history,'' Quayle
replied.
   When a reporter suggested that perhaps he had not meant to say
``our nation's,'' Quayle tried to explain that he had meant ``in
this century's history.''
   ``We all lived in this century _ I didn't live in this century _
in this century's history,'' he said. ``We did not have _ as a
matter of fact, we fought _ Hitlerism. The Holocaust is a critical
point in history that we should as a nation understand.''
   History lessons notwithstanding, reporters following the Indiana
senator have long observed his propensity for malapropism.
   Last week in Springfield, Ill., Quayle told his audience that
George Bush's day care proposals would give parents more freedom in
determining what kind of care their children would have. The
result, he intended to say, would promote a better parent-child
relationship.
   This is what came out:
   ``We understand the importance of having the bondage between the
parent and the child.''
   Quayle's aides say the senator's verbal stumbling is not a major
campaign concern.
   ``Not everybody has a golden tongue. Everybody makes mistakes
from time to time,'' said David Prosperi, Quayle's press secretary.
   Such instances usually occur when Quayle is not speaking from a
prepared text. In fact, he is known to be much more comfortable
speaking extemporaneously, with only a few notecards as a prop.
   But last week, when he discarded his prepared text on defense
issues in a speech before a Chicago audience, out came a confusing
paraphrase of Indiana University basketball coach Bobby Knight.
   ``Bobby Knight told me this: `there is nothing that a good
defense cannot beat a better offense.' In other words, a good
offense wins,'' Quayle said.
   And on Thursday, Quayle responded to a question about negative
campaigning by saying it was ``an unfortunate aspect as the
campaign unravels.''
   Prosperi noted that misspeak has plagued a number of candidates
this season, such as when Democrat Michael Dukakis' inadvertently
referred the other day to Bush's ``terrorism'' instead of
``patriotism.''
   ``If malapropism were a liability,'' Prosperi said, ``there
would be no politicians left to run for office.''

   The U.S.-backed Contra rebels accepted
a government proposal to hold a preliminary meeting next week that
could lead to high-level talks on ending the 7-year-old civil war.
   Roberto Ferrey, one of seven Contra board members, said Thursday
in a telephone interview that the rebels would go to Guatemala
Monday to ``discuss the possiblity'' of resuming cease-fire talks.
   The leftist Sandinistas and the Contras signed an agreement
March 23 to seek a negotiated settlement to the fighting, which has
caused more than 28,000 deaths. But the talks broke off June 9, and
each side accuses the other of cease-fire violations.
   Ferrey said the decision to hold the preliminary meeting
proposed by the government did not mean the high-level summit would
be renewed.
   ``We are not going to negotiate anything,'' he said. ``It's a
contact to see if we can overcome obstacles.''
   For example, he said, further high-level talks cannot be held
unless political opposition figures are released from prison.
   Sandinista police arrested more than 40 opposition figures July
10 after an anti-government demonstration in the southern city of
Nandaime.
   The agreement to seek a negotiated settlement came three weeks
after the United States cut off all military aid to the rebels. The
pact surprised Washington and caused deep division among the rebels.
   In Washington, a U.S. official on Thursday endorsed the Contras'
acceptance of the Sandinista offer.
   ``They are asking the Sandinistas to be reasonable,'' said the
official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   The Reagan Administration has backed the Contra rebels since
1981 in their fight to oust the Sandinista government. The
Sandinistas came to power in 1979 in a popular revolutionary war
that deposed the dictatorship of Anastacio Somoza.

   More than 1,500 animals at the Gladys
Porter Zoo were included in the preparations for Hurricane Gilbert.
   ``All the animals will have some kind of shelter. Tender birds
or those capable of flight in high wind are locked up first,''
General Curator Jerry Stones said Thursday.
   ``We try to wait until the last minute to do this because it
puts a lot of stress on the birds and we don't want to have them in
there too long or longer than we have to.''
   Workers also will place extra hay and feed in zoo buildings,
check generators and secure equipment from high winds.
   The zoo was already prepared for a hurricane, with a year-round
cache of supplies, including flashlights, batteries, boots, lumber,
food, water and generators, said Stones.

   Hurricane Gilbert has similarities to Allen,
which had winds up to 200 mph but diminished before it reached the
Texas coastline in 1980, meteorologists say.
   Allen caused heavy flooding and two deaths, but its assault on
Texas in August 1980 was far less serious than had been feared.
   Allen _ one of the most powerful hurricanes then on record _
slammed across the Caribbean with lethal force and built to
Category 5 strength.
   Gilbert also built to the same strength before weakening as it
passed over Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula.
   Allen, with a diameter of more than 600 miles, rapidly built in
intensity and crossed the gulf on Aug. 7 with winds near 200 mph.
   It sent hundreds of thousands of people on an exodus from the
coast but its rush toward land suddenly stalled as a high-pressure
ridge fended it off.
   By the time Allen crashed into the coast early Aug. 10, its
winds had diminished to around 100 mph and it was classified as a
Category 3 hurricane.
   At least 67 people were reported killed in Haiti after Allen
raced over the Caribbean island of Hispaniola.

   NASA's Johnson Space Center employees were sent
home for the weekend to secure their homes, get supplies or leave
the area as Hurricane Gilbert approached the coast.
   Normally, the space center is closed to visitors only on
Christmas Day. But it shut down at noon Thursday and employees were
told they didn't have to return until normal work times Monday,
spokesman James Hartsfield said.
   At the space center, about 25 miles from the coast, there are
3,382 civil employees and 5,665 workers from companies contracting
with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.
   A core group will remain throughout the weekend at Mission
Control, the strongest building at the center and the place where
shuttle flights are controlled, Hartsfield said. Mission Control
has concrete walls and no windows.
   ``If the storm hurts that (Mission Control), we're really in
trouble,'' he said.
   If the space center withstands substantial damage, Hartsfield
said the expected launch of the first post-Challenger flight at
Cape Canaveral, Fla., wouldn't be affected.
   But NASA officials on Wednesday decided not to set an exact date
for the long-waited launch of Discovery because of the storm.

   The dollar edged up against the Japanese yen, while
share prices rose moderately on the Tokyo Stock Exchange at the
close of trading here Friday.
   The dollar closed at 133.76 yen, up 0.31 yen from Wednesday's
finish of 133.45 yen. The currency was traded in a range between
133.58-133.80 yen, after opening at 133.65 yen.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues, which closed at
27,866.38 points, gained 60.71 points or 0.22 percent from
Wednesday's close. The market's most widely used index rose in the
afternoon after a moderate fall in midmorning trading.
   A foreign exchange dealer with Mitsubishi Bank said the
dollar-yen rate was hardly moving after Thursday's national holiday
and ahead of the weekend.
   Investors in Tokyo traded currencies after observing the dollar
seesaw between 133 yen and 135 yen in New York following
Wednesday's release of the U.S. trade figure for July, which
indicated the U.S. trade deficit narrowed to a four-year low of
$9.5 billion for the month.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues, a 11.51-point
winner Wednesday, ended the morning session up 0.67 points at
27,806.34. The index climbed to 27.871.80 shortly after trading
began but declined moderately in mid-morning activity.
   Despite a lower Dow Jones index overnight on Wall Street, the
Tokyo market was stable throughout the morning session, said a
Nomura Securities analyst.
   ``Steels attracted investors and made their trading very active.
That's the way the market should be,'' he said, speaking on
condition of anonymity.

<TEXT>
   A man was convicted of criminally negligent
homicide for smashing his car into a limousine during a drag race,
killing a newlywed couple and the best man, but the victims'
families found slim solace in the verdict.
   ``I just want him to pay for my pain,'' 22-year-old Debra
Zagorski said Thursday after the Nassau County jury convicted
21-year-old Vincent Laezza.
   Miss Zagorski was the maid of honor for her sister, 24-year-old
Carol Zagorski-Phillips, who died after 18 days in a coma. The
April 1987 crash left Miss Zagorski with a permanent limp.
   ``My body is scarred and I want him to be scarred for the rest
of his life,'' she said, tears running down her face outside the
courthouse.
   Laezza, who was free on $75,000 bail, was handcuffed and
remanded as his parents looked on with tears in their eyes. He
could be sentenced to a maximum 19 years in prison. Sentencing is
scheduled for Oct. 14.
   Police said Laezza was apparently drag racing at speeds up to
100 mph when his car crashed broadside into the limousine as it was
turning into a catering hall parking lot for the wedding reception.
   Killed instantly was the groom, Peter Phillips, 27, and his
brother and best man, 29-year-old John Phillips.
   Laezza was convicted of criminally negligent homicide but
acquitted of the more serious charge of manslaughter. He also was
convicted of one count of assault for seriously injuring Miss
Zagorski and was acquitted of assault in connection with the
limousine driver's injuries.
   ``This is really nothing but a terrible, terrible auto
accident,'' said Laezza's attorney, Eugene Schaffer. ``It was not a
crime.''
   Laezza, a carpenter from the Long Island community of Selden,
testified during the two-week trial that he did not remember the
accident: His only recollection was stopping for a red light and
waking up three days later in a hospital.
   The defense blamed the limousine driver, who suffered minor
injuries in the accident, charging he caused the accident by
cutting across Laezza's lane.
   The verdict was returned on what would have been the groom's
29th birthday.
   ``No matter what they do to (Laezza) it is not going to bring
those kids back,'' said the groom's father, John Phillips. ``I've
been waiting 17 months to see him led away in handcuffs.''

   A helicopter crashed during a search for
marijuana patches, killing the pilot and seriously injuring a
sheriff's deputy, authorities said.
   The copter crashed Thursday in a soybean field about 10 miles
west of Batesville after apparently hitting power lines,
authorities said.
   The 46-year-old pilot, Lawrence P. Klein, flew for a Memphis,
Tenn., aviation service, the Independence County Sheriff's
Department said.
   Lt. Bill Hall was in serious condition Thursday night in a
Little Rock hospital, said dispatcher Roger Williams.
   The helicopter was leased by the sheriff's department for aerial
searches of rugged countryside suspected of containing marijuana
fields, Williams said.
   Williams said he did not think the pair had located any
marijuana fields during the search.

<HEAD>Aquino Hails Formation of Pro-Government Party</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By EILEEN GUERRERO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MANILA, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Corazon Aquino today hailed
the formation of a new political party organized by her supporters
but said the move must not divide democratic forces into
``permanent hostile camps.''
   Formation of the new party is the latest step in a realignment
of forces which ousted leader Ferdinand Marcos in February 1986 and
swept Mrs. Aquino into power.
   Mrs. Aquino made her remarks in a speech to the opening session
of the first national convention of the new party, the ``Struggle
of the Democratic Filipino.''
   Rep. Ramon Mitra, speaker of the House of Representatives, was
elected president of the party, which organizers hope will bring
together pro-government forces under a single banner and serve as
the president's own party.
   But some pro-Aquino politicians have attacked the new party as a
bid by the president's relatives and others to consolidate their
own power in advance of the 1992 presidential election.
   Mrs. Aquino, who has vowed not to seek re-election, told the
5,093 delegates she hoped the new party was founded ``not only for
the 1992 elections but to help our people face and overcome their
problems.''
   Mrs. Aquino acknowledged the country must reinforce its newly
won democracy by establishing disciplined national parties. Parties
here have traditionally formed around personalities of their
leaders rather than ideology.
   ``Without the organization of political beliefs and programs
into disciplined parties, we would have only a riot of conflicting
opinions but no effective action,'' Mrs. Aquino said.
   She said political factionalism enabled her ousted predecessor,
Ferdinand Marcos, to impose eight years of martial law in 1972.
   Mrs. Aquino said the current political realignment was creating
disenchantment among the Filipino public, who fear a return to the
old-style politics of bickering and infighting that led to martial
rule.
   Delegates to the inaugural convention included 108 of the 202
members of the House of Representatives, six of the 23 senators, 42
provincial governors and more than 1,170 city and town mayors.
   Sen. Neptali Gonzalez, convention chairman, said he was not
disappointed by Mrs. Aquino's reluctance to give the party a
ringing endorsement or to join its ranks.
   ``You don't expect the president to say, `this is my party,''
Gonzalez said. ``I think her presence here is enough inspiration to
add membership to the party.''
   Mitra said Mrs. Aquino avoided a clearcut endorsement of the
party as the principal administration party because ``she might be
accused of playing politics.''
   He told reporters the party was organized to consolidate
political support for the government and establish a grass-roots,
mass movement behind Mrs. Aquino.
   ``But there are others who do not believe in this thinking,''
Mitra said. He was referring to the refusal of 18 Liberal Party
members in the House to join the new party.
   The Liberals, led by Senate President Jovito Salonga, are among
six parties united in the government coalition. But the Liberals
have disagreed with other pro-government parties and with some of
the president's politically influential relatives.
   Last month, Vice President Salvador Laurel and opposition Sen.
Juan Ponce Enrile announced formation of a new opposition party.
Mrs. Aquino ran under Laurel's United Nationalist Democratic
Organization in the 1986 presidential election, but the two fell
out over differences in philosophy and personal rivalry.

<HEAD>Government Moving Toward Final Ban on Hairspray Propellant</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Food and Drug Administration is close to
banning a chemical that once was used widely as a propellant in
hairsprays, according to the agency's director.
   ``We feel all the evidence indicates it is a hazardous
substance,'' said Dr. Frank E. Young at a hearing of the House
Small Business Committee's regulation subcommittee on Thursday.
   ``Just the introduction of this for just a few seconds in the
air in the bathroom every morning'' is a risk, Young told the
lawmakers.
   The cosmetics industry has conceded that the chemical is
hazardous for cosmeticians who might use it several times a day,
but has argued that it is safe for consumers.
   The FDA proposed banning use of methylene chloride in 1985
because the agency believes it is causes cancer.
   The agency should announce its final decision on the substance
by the end of the year. Other government agencies also would have
to consider the proposal before it becomes official.

<HEAD>Judges Plan Videotape Experiment</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. Judicial Conference has announced an
experiment that could eliminate court stenographers.
   The Judicial Conference, a 28-judge board which sets policy for
the nation's federal courts, announced Thursday that it has
approved a two-year experiment for some federal courts to videotape
their proceedings.
   The experiment marks a radical departure for the federal
judiciary because, unlike many of their state counterparts, the
federal courts ban all electronic coverage of courtroom proceedings.
   The experiment, to be conducted in six trial courts and two
appeals courts which have not been identified, is designed to find
out whether videotapes should replace written documents as official
records of trial and appellate court proceedings.
   Public access to the videotapes is ``something that has not been
determined yet,'' said conference spokesman David Sellers.
   The experiment, which will be supplemented by stenographic
record, will be monitored by a committee led by U.S. District Judge
Richard M. Bilby of Tucson, Ariz.

<HEAD>Senate Panel Votes To Acquire Site Near Civil War Battlefield</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Senate panel has voted to give the federal
government authority to seize a development site adjacent to a
Civil War battlefield in suburban Virginia.
   The Energy and Natural Resources Committee on Thursday voted
11-8 to approve a measure that would authorize Congress to acquire
the 542-acre William Center Development tract near the Manassas
National Battlefield Park.
   The measure, introduced by Sen. Dale Bumpers, D-Ark., is
identical to a bill that passed the House last month and allows for
purchase of the land and up to $30 million in construction of new
roads around the park.
   The panel rejected a compromise measure offered by Sen. John
Warner, R-Va., under which only part of the parcel would be
acquired.
   ``If we don't act to preserve that property, you can go down
there three weeks from now, and it will be gone, for all intents
and purposes,'' Bumpers said, maintaining the entire tract was
historically significant. ``It'll be a shopping mall.''
   Committee chairman Sen. J. Bennett Johnston, D-La., said he
hoped the bill would reach the Senate floor by next week. President
Reagan has threatened to veto any legislation similar to the
Bumpers bill.

<HEAD>Count Of Inactive Waste Sites At Nuclear Facilities Doubles</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Department of Energy has more than doubled
its count of inactive waste sites at nuclear weapons production
facilities across the country, according to the General Accounting
Office.
   The inactive waste site figure went from 1,447 to 3,276,
according GAO reports released by Sen. John Glenn, D-Ohio, chairman
of the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee.
   ``DOE's disarray in counting and assessing its inactive waste
sites is further evidence of this and earlier administrations'
willingness to place the public's health and safety at risk in
their rush to produce nuclear weapons,'' Glenn said.
   ``The fact that DOE doesn't know how many inactive waste sites
it has, or how hazardous they are, suggests that this cost estimate
is low,'' Glenn said, noting that DOE previously had estimated it
would cost $60 billion to clean up the waste sites.
   Glenn said that ``if we add all these costs up, the bill will be
at least $175 billion over the next half century.''

<HEAD>House Committee Approves Expanded Territorial Limit</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The House Merchant Marine and Fisheries
Committee has approved legislation that would extend the U.S.
territorial limit to 12 nautical miles.
   Thursday's voice vote approving the measure would make the first
change in the three-mile protection zone along the U.S. coast since
1793 when President Thomas Jefferson instituted it.
   The panel also approved legislation that would require that
foreign fishing vessels stow their gear when passing through the
200-mile U.S. economic zone and carry transponders so satellites
could track their location.
   Those proposals were attached to a new U.S.-Soviet fishing
treaty and were sought by Washington state lawmakers after seven
Japanese trawlers were videotaped fishing in American waters off
Alaska in January.
   The expansion of the territorial limit will allow the United
States to exercise complete control over a broader area that would
``enhance our nation's ability to intercept and board vessels which
may be carrying contraband or drugs off our coast,'' and ``the
ability of Soviet ships to monitor and detect the movement of U.S.
submarines is lessened,'' said Rep. Mike Lowry, D-Wash., sponsor of
the bill.

<HEAD>Many Doctors Misinform Patients In Nicotine Gum Use</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WILLIAM C. HIDLAY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Doctors often incorrectly instruct patients on
using nicotine gum or fail to prescribe it at all even though it
can help heavy smokers quit, according to studies published today.
   ``Most internists prescribe nicotine gum to fewer than 25
percent of patients who try to quit smoking,'' said one of five
smoking-related studies in today's Journal of the American Medical
Association. ``There is a widespread need for physician education
about how to use nicotine gum more effectively.''
   For instance, nearly 40 percent of 208 internists surveyed in
the study said they would prescribe nicotine gum to help patients
cut down on smoking, violating a key guideline for using it. The
manufacturer's guidelines call for patients to stop smoking
completely before using it.
   And one-fourth of the internists surveyed said they had recently
prescribed sedatives to help patients stop smoking, although
``there is no evidence that sedatives are useful'' for that
purpose, said the study by Dr. Steven R. Cummings and colleagues at
the University of California Medical School in San Francisco.
   ``I would guess that the confusion and difficulties with using
the gum are very widespread,'' Cummings said.
   Nicotine gum, a prescription drug marketed under the trade name
Nicorette by Lakeside Pharmaceuticals of Cincinnati, can be an
effective tool to help some people quit smoking, particularly heavy
smokers, concluded three other studies in the journal.
   But one study found that 34 of 538 patients, or 6.8 percent, who
were given nicotine gum to help them quit smoking were still
chewing it after a year.
   Those long-term gum chewers also represented 25 percent of the
patients who succeeded in staying off cigarettes for a year, said
the report by researchers at the University of London.
   ``I don't think physicians ought to supply it just
willy-nilly,'' said Dr. Stephen P. Fortmann, an assistant professor
at the Stanford University School of Medicine. ``Most people who've
quit smoking did it before the gum was available. ... So we're by
no means advocating it.
   ``The gum shouldn't be seen as either a miracle or as a
necessity, but as a useful adjunct.''
   Another study in the journal found that heavy smokers _ those
who consume more than 25 cigarettes daily _ are more physically
addicted to nicotine and have a harder time quitting than people
who smoke no more than 15 cigarettes a day.
   That study suggested nicotine gum might better help heavy
smokers overcome withdrawal symptoms caused by their physical
addiction when they stop.
   Lakeside spokesman Bill Donaldson said the manufacturer
estimates 2 million people have quit smoking by using nicotine gum
as part of a stop-smoking program since Nicorette was introduced in
1985.
   He said the company had no reports of patients becoming addicted
to nicotine from the gum itself. Any dependence on the gum ``is a
transference'' of the patient's nicotine addiction from smoking and
``is part of the weaning process,'' Donaldson said.

   The dollar held its ground against the Japanese yen
today, while share prices on the Tokyo Stock Exchange rose
moderately.
   The dollar closed 0.31 yen higher at 133.76 yen. It opened at
133.65 yen and fluctuated in a narrow range of 133.58-133.80 yen.
Spot volume was estimated at $4 billion amid directionless trading.
   ``Because the Tokyo market opened at almost the same level as it
closed before the release of U.S. trade figures and a Japanese
national holiday Thursday, it was difficult for investors to figure
out whether they should sell or buy the dollar,'' said a dealer at
the Bank of Tokyo, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   Monthly trade data released in Washington Wednesday showed the
U.S. trade deficit in July shrank to $9.53 billion from $13.22
billion in June, the biggest monthly improvement in almost six
years.
   On the stock exchange, the Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected
issues closed higher at 27,866.38 points, up 60.71 points or 0.22
percent from Wednesday's close of 27,805.67. Volume on the first
section was a heavy 1.1 billion shares.
   ``Steels initiated the trading today, and trading was active all
day,'' said a stock dealer with Daiwa Securities. Electronic and
high-tech issues also advanced.
   The better-than-expected U.S. trade deficit as well as a stable
yen-dollar rate were boosting the stock market's performance, he
added.

   Dorothy Eber says her children and grandchildren
respect her strong views but they don't want to see her go to
prison, even though that's where the 63-year-old activist may be
headed.
   ``They wish it was somebody else doing it but me,'' the suburban
Villa Park mother of four and grandmother of 11 said Thursday.
   Ms. Eber faces six months and 3{ years in prison for her part in
the Missouri Peace Planting, in which she and 13 others entered 10
missile sites and planted flowers or trees.
   ``It was the first time I saw a missile silo and it was
devastating,'' Ms. Eber said, recalling her first protest Aug. 15
out on the grassy plains. ``To me it looked like a monster.''
   After writing peace slogans with her own blood on the silo
cover, Ms. Eber said, she sat down and waited nearly two hours for
police.
   For her trouble, she was given a ``ban and bar letter,'' which
forbade her to enter missile sites again.
   But she and some others went back _ three times during the next
two weeks.
   And for that, Ms. Eber is scheduled to be tried Oct. 24 in
Kansas City on four counts each of criminal trespass and damage of
property less than $100.
   ``All I did was cut the padlock,'' she said. ``It can't be worth
more than 50 cents.''
   Ms. Eber, whose husband died two years ago, began her activism
in the wake of the civil rights movement, when her youngest son
started high school in 1967. She began tutoring children in an
inner city parish, and then started a program in which high school
students from the suburbs came into the city to tutor.
   But she felt her efforts were not changing very much, and that
she needed to concentrate on changing the system itself. So she
began civil disobedience, and was arrested four times in 1983 for
demonstrating at the plants of several local defense contractors.
   For that, she said, she got 30 days of court-ordered supervision.
   ``It really didn't mean much,'' she said.
   Now, unless the charges against her are reduced, she faces a
mandatory minimum sentence of six months in jail if she is
convicted. And she expects a conviction.
   Her son Fred Eber, 46, supports his mother in her activism but
doesn't entirely agree with her goals of nuclear disarmament. He
said he has come to realize that ``it's more than a possibility''
his mother might go to prison.
   His four children, ages 16 to 25, also are worried but they
respect the fact that she's willing to stand up for her beliefs,
Eber said.
   ``I try and make a lesson about it that all we can do is be true
to ourselves,'' he said. ``Sometimes I wish there was something I
felt so strongly about.''
   Ms. Eber said she doesn't push her views on her grandchildren.
But if they ask, she tries to explain why she is risking
incarceration.
   ``I tell them that they must always question and never close
their minds,'' she said.
   And while she will miss her family if she does go to prison, she
has no regrets about her activism.
   ``For me it's going to be very lonely, to be separated from my
family,'' she said. ``But I feel I'm doing it for them.''

<HEAD>`Moonlighting' Executive Producer Reported Out</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Glenn Gordon Caron, the producer whose
creative genius powered the comic eccentricities of the ABC-TV
series ``Moonlighting'' has left the show, the Hollywood newspaper
Daily Variety reported.
   Jay Daniels, who had been working as co-executive producer on
the Emmy-award winning show during the past two seasons will take
over as executive producer, the trade publication reported Thursday.
   The newspaper attributed Caron's departure to the network.
   Variety said reports were circulating that Caron had told ABC
network officials they would have to decide whether they wanted him
or actress Cybill Shepherd to return to the show, but ABC denied
this.
   Miss Shepherd, who co-stars with actor Bruce Willis, plays
Maddie Hayes, a financially devastated glamour queen who returns to
run a detective agency she had purchased as a tax-shelter.
   ``Moonlighting'' satirized the TV detective genre, often turning
the conventional end-of-the-show chase scene into a campy
free-for-all. The show also broke ground by deliberately mocking
its own television format.
   The show was energized by the hot-and-cold relationship between
Miss Shepherd's sensual princess and Willis' irreverent,
street-wise character, David Addison.
   Their banter sometimes evolved into witty dual monologues, with
each character talking without listening to the other.
   Caron, a reputed perfectionist, often worked on the scripts
himself and frequently pushed beyond deadlines for the show.
   He also directed ``Clean and Sober,'' the critically acclaimed
Michael Keaton film currently in release.

   A 140-pound man with a brick who tried to
rob a law office has proven no match for a 280-pound lawyer.
   A man walked into Raymundo Pena's law office Wednesday night,
holding a brick he apparently picked up outside the door, according
to police.
   The robber told Pena he wanted the keys to his car.
   ``I kept trying to get closer to him,'' Pena said. ``He was just
out of range.''
   Pena, who wrestled for his high school and played football in
college, waited until he saw the man fiddling with the keys.
   ``I grabbed his wrist that had the brick in it, hit him in the
chest with my shoulder, then, as he was falling back, I did an
ankle sweep,'' Pena said.
   Pena wrapped matters up with an arm bar and a half nelson.
   His sister-in-law, Tammy Lopez, pitched in by planting her knee
on the robber.
   Police arrived and arrested the pinned man, 24-year-old Ronnie
Cantu of Rupert. Cantu was charged Thursday with aggravated
assault, first-degree robbery and first-degree burglary,
authorities said.

   A hotel bellhop honored for saving a
handicapped man from his burning apartment after a fireman had
given up says he doesn't want to be recognized as a hero, ``Thank
you was more than enough.''
   Nonetheless, Thomas J. Cathcart was among 20 Americans and
Canadians honored Thursday for their heroism by the Carnegie Hero
Fund Commission. Two of the heroes died in the performance of their
deeds.
   Cathcart, who works at a Catskill mountains hotel, said he was
walking home in Ellenville, N.Y., on July 22, 1987, when he heard a
woman screaming that her handicapped brother was trapped in a
burning apartment.
   ``I thought to myself, `Someone do something,''' Cathcart
recalled in a telephone interview Thursday. ``A volunteer fireman
said he couldn't make it. Instead of getting all riled up, I tried
to figure out what to do.''
   Cathcart picked up a dirty towel from the ground, put it over
his mouth, and went to the fiery second floor for Dennis DeJesus,
33.
   ``He was trying to get himself up with his crutches. I put him
up on my shoulders and ran down the steps. A lot of things were
going to my mind, but I wasn't thinking of my own health,''
Cathcart recalled.
   ``I didn't want to be recognized as a hero. Myself, I just felt
good inside for helping another man. Thank you was more than
enough. I know I'll always have a friend.''
   Heroes receive $2,500 and a medal from the Carnegie Hero Fund
Commission, which was established by industrialist Andrew Carnegie
in 1904 to recognize heroism by civilians in the United States and
Canada. It has honored 77 people this year and 7,258 people since
1904.
   Others recognized Thursday were:
   _Jeffrey G. Chipley, 17, of Estevan, Saskatchewan, who died
helping in the rescue of a 16-year-old boy in an abandoned mine on
Nov. 11, 1987.
   _James Michael Paradis, 28, of Chelsea, Mass., who died of stab
wounds after saving a woman from an assailant who had broken into
her apartment in Lynn, Mass., on Oct. 26, 1987.
   _Fred A. Thomas Jr., 18, of Wilkes-Barre, who saved a 3-year-old
boy from his burning apartment on Oct. 26, 1987.
   _Bruce Dobbs, 46, of Fairfax Station, Va., who saved a man from
drowning in the Potomac River on Dec. 22, 1987.

exposure in a river near Galetta, Ontario, on April 11, 1987.
   _Guy A. Keally, 36, of Johnson City, Tenn., who saved a woman
from a burning car on Oct. 16, 1987.
   _Larry B. Pulai, 26, of Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, who saved a
20-month-old girl from being struck by a train on May 20, 1987.

   Hundreds of radical students shouting
``Yankee go home!'' mounted protests against the Olympics today on
the eve of Games and burned an effigy of President Reagan.
   Students staged protests at three schools in Seoul to demand the
Olympics be shared with communist North Korea and to denounce the
government of President Roh Tae-woo. The Olympics start Saturday.
   ``Oppose dictator's Olympics!'' and ``Crush military
aggression!'' students yelled.
   About 300 protesters armed with firebombs and clubs marched out
of Kookmin University to fight riot police after burning effigies
of Reagan and Roh, as well as a U.S. flag. But riot police watched
from a distance and did not intervene as the protesters repeatedly
blocked traffic.
   Students, one of whom hurled a single firebomb at a passing
police truck and missed, tired of taunting police and dispersed.
   About 500 students took part in a similar protest at Seoul
National University in the south of the capital. They marched to
the gate and burned an effigy of Roh.
   Riot police in green combat fatigues and black, visored helmets
watched but did not intervene. The students made no move to attack
the police.
   The protesters then marched to a gym on the campus where Olympic
table tennis events are to be held and yelled anti-Olympic slogans
outside the building before dispersing.
   A small anti-Olympic protest was also held at Yonsei University
with less than 100 students taking part.
   Anti-Olympic protests have been small by Korean standards, and
the radicals have failed to attract support. Violent clashes with
riot police have dropped sharply in recent days as the number of
students taking part has dwindled.
   A few onlookers even shouted abuse at protesters at Kookmin,
accusing them of trying to wreck the Olympics. ``Go home. You are
shaming our nation,'' screamed an angry old man.
   The radicals are demanding the Olympics be shared with North
Korea to promote reunification of the Korean Peninsula, divided
since 1945.
   Radicals also contend the Roh government is a front for military
rule and is using the Olympics to cement its rule with aid from the
United States.
   The great majority of Koreans, including most students, want the
Olympics to be a major success. ``Students know the people are
against these demonstrations,'' a student leader said today.
   North Korea is boycotting the Olympics because its demand to be
a co-host of the Games was rejected. The International Olympic
Committee said the Games are awarded to a single city and cannot be
shared.

<BYLINE>Debacle Encompassed All, Says Attorney For Engineers

<TEXT>
   Accusations against 19 defendants in the
fraud trial over the Washington Public Power Supply System's
default on $2.25 billion in bonds amounts to ``fraud by
hindsight,'' a defense lawyer says.
   ``There is no evidence to support charges of conspiracy,'' Peter
Nickles, representing the engineering firm of Ebasco, said in
opening statements Thursday.
   Jurors were told by other defense attorneys that utility
officials who sat on the system's board of directors were part-time
public servants who relied on experts and had nothing to gain by
misleading investors who bought bonds in the two nuclear plants.
   ``These people always acted in good faith,'' said Al Malanca,
who represents 12 of the 16 public utilities that are among
defendants. ``They had no motive to do wrong.''
   Malanca opened the defendants' case by disputing plaintiff
attorneys' arguments that utility members of the WPPSS board
controlled the supply system and plotted to defraud bond buyers.
   Defendants, including another engineering firm and a financial
adviser to WPPSS, are accused of making misrepresentations and
withholding crucial information from investors who bought bonds to
finance construction of two nuclear power plants.
   Plaintiffs include more than 24,000 bond buyers in the case,
which resulted from the 1983 default by WPPSS on the $2.25 billion
in bonds. It was the biggest default in the history of the
municipal bond market.
   The trial began last week. The judge excused jurors until
Monday, when opening arguments by defense attorneys were to resume.
   Nickles said what happened to the WPPSS projects was happening
to the entire nuclear industry by the late 1970s.
   He said plant-construction prices dramatically escalated because
of inflation and required changes to make nuclear plants safer. And
the 1979 Three Mile Island accident, he said, ``wrecked the nuclear
industry.''
   Malanca told jurors that the plaintiffs would have them believe
the 16 utility defendants had the power to control federal and
state agencies, and were able to induce major engineering and
financial firms to knowingly make false claims on official bond
statements.
   But the utilities were relatively small, and were far down on
the pecking order among the energy powers in the Northwest, he
said. The federal Bonneville Power Administration, he said,
dominated the region.
   While WPPSS in the 1970s, with five nuclear plants under
construction, was also a major player in the energy scene, said
Malanca, the utility officials that directed it were part-time
participants.
   He said they considered their appointments to the board a matter
of civic duty, went to meetings only periodically, hired the best
experts they could find, and generally followed directions of those
experts and WPPSS.
   The supply system staff had more power in directing WPPSS and
board members were not even to speak to the media as
representatives of WPPSS, he said.
   ``If they did anything wrong, they were acting as board members
of the supply system, not of the utilities,'' he said.
   He stressed that public utility officials are not paid,
receiving only per diem allowances for their work.
   Dennis Bromley, another defense lawyer, said utilities from the
23-member WPPSS board sent one representative each to the supply
system.
   But, he said, the utilities had no control at all over how that
representative voted and didn't stand a chance of controlling the
supply system.
   The supply system was created in 1957 to build and operate major
power-generating facilities in the Northwest.

<HEAD>Rain, Wind, Tides Herald Gilbert's Approach in Texas; Rain in
Plains</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Heavy rain, gusty winds and high tides heralded the approach of
Hurricane Gilbert along Texas' southern Gulf Coast today while
unrelated showers and thunderstorms soaked parts of the Plains.
   Showers and scattered thunderstorms also extended to the lower
Mississippi Valley, the central Gulf Coast and Florida.
   Hurricane warnings were in effect along the southern Texas coast
from Port O'Conner to Brownsville and south along the Mexican coast
to Tampico. A hurricane watch was in effect eastward from Port
O'Conner to Port Arthur, Texas, near Louisiana.
   The first major rains from Gilbert hit Brownsville late
Thursday, accompanied by wind gusts up to 40 mph, and Corpus
Christi reported tides 3 to 4 feet above normal.
   Out in the gulf today, the hurricane packed maximum sustained
winds of 120 mph and 10- to 15-inch rainfall. Tides were expected
to run 7 to 11 feet above normal when Gilbert makes landfall.
   A band of thunderstorms lashed the area from north Texas to
northwest Missouri with heavy rains, strong winds and hail
Thursday. Power lines were downed, and golf ball-size hail pelted
Ponca City, Okla. By early today, the storms had dropped 1 to 2
inches of rain in several locations.
   Showers also dampened Iowa, Minnesota and the eastern parts of
South Dakota and Nebraska. Cloudy skies covered the Pacific
Northwest, but it was clear in most other parts of the country.
   Early morning temperatures dipped into the 30s and 40s in the
northern Atlantic Coast, with frost warnings in effect for Vermont
and eastern New York state.
   Today's forecast called for numerous showers and thunderstorms
from Hurricane Gilbert over southern Louisiana and Texas, with
strong gusty winds in southern Texas and the northern Rockies;
showers and a few thunderstorms from South Carolina to the Gulf
Coast states, from the Tennessee, lower Ohio and Mississippi
valleys to the eastern Plains, and over northern Michigan, northern
Wisconsin and eastern Minnesota; and widely scattered showers from
the Pacific Northwest to northwest Montana.
   Highs were forecast in the 70s and 80s over most of the nation;
in the upper 50s and 60s in New England, the northern Appalachians,
from northern Michigan to eastern Minnesota, and from northwest
Montana to the Pacific Northwest and down part of the California
coast; in the lower 90s in Florida, Mississippi and parts of the
southern Plains; and up to 105 degrees in the desert Southwest.
   At 3 a.m. EDT, temperatures ranged from 34 degrees at Watertown,
N.Y., to 84 degrees at Homestead, Fla.

   The dollar was trading steadily in thin
late-morning trading in Europe today, with players saying they
expected the dollar to stay in a narrow range throughout the
session.
   Gold prices moved lower.
   Foreign exchange dealers in Italy said that volume was limited
and that there were few commercial orders as activity wound down
for the weekend.
   They said that the market remained bullish about the dollar due
to the narrower-than-expected U.S. July trade deficit reported
Wednesday. But they cautioned that the general opinion was that the
world's major central banks appeared content with the dollar's
present levels, and that any attempt to push it much higher would
invite intervention.
   ``I see the dollar gaining ground, but nobody wants to be the
first the try stepping over 1.88 (West German) marks,'' said a
trader in Milan with a major Italian commercial bank. He predicted
that the dollar would trade within a range of between 1.87 marks
and 1.88 marks today.
   In Tokyo, where the business day ends before Europe's begins,
the dollar rose 0.31 yen to a closing 133.76 yen. Later, in London,
it was quoted at 134.10 yen.
   Other dollar rates at mid-morning, compared with late Thursday:
   _1.8741 West German marks, down from 1.8775
   _1.5810 Swiss francs, down from 1.5820
   _6.3735 French francs, down from 6.3790
   _2.1133 Dutch guilders, down from 2.1160
   _1,397.25 Italian lire, down from 1,398.87
   _1.2235 Canadian dollars, up from 1.2225
   In London, the British pound rose to $1.6755, compared with
$1.6675 Thursday.
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $417 a troy ounce, down
from $417.75 bid late Thursday. At mid-morning Friday, the city's
five major bullion dealers fixed a recommended price of $417.30.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $417.20, down from $417.50 bid late
Thursday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold fell $3.61 to close at a bid
$419.84. Silver was quoted in London today at a bid price of $6.46
a troy ounce, up from Thursday's $6.44.

<HEAD>Study Says Trees' Contribution To Ozone Has Been Ignored</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN A. BOLT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Scientists trying to get to the root of America's
ozone pollution should reconsider the role trees play, researchers
say.
   Trees contribute such a high amount of hydrocarbons to the
atmosphere, pollution-control efforts would be more effective if
they sought to limit nitrogen oxide instead, according to research
by Georgia Tech faculty members.
   Aware of Ronald Reagan's ``killer trees'' theories of 1980,
Georgia Tech geophysicist W.L. Chameides hastens to say that trees
don't cause ozone pollution any more than the sun does.
   Chameides concedes the conclusions place him and his colleagues
out on a scientific limb, but said Thursday, ``I think there are
other scientists that are coming along with us.''
   He said he expected that the conclusions would be accepted,
despite what he called ``institutional inertia.''
   Ozone is produced by the combination of sunlight, hydrocarbons
and nitrogen oxides. It protects the Earth from harmful radiation
at high atmospheric levels, but can harm humans and crops at low
levels.
   All three ingredients must exist before ozone can be formed, and
``no one has inferred from that that the sun was a polluter or that
we should put a big screen over the United States to protect it,''
Chameides said.
   During the 1980 presidential campaign, Reagan angered
environmentalists by suggesting that trees and other parts of
nature were the chief culprits of air pollution. The idea led to
jokes about ``killer trees'' and the appearance of protesters who
dressed themselves as trees and carried signs saying, ``Chop Us
Down Before We Kill Again.''
   Chameides stressed that the researchers do not suggest cutting
down trees, but instead believe pollution control efforts should
center on nitrogen oxides, which are produced by many of the same
processes that emit hydrocarbons.
   Chameides led a team of Georgia Tech researchers who studied the
production of hydrocarbons, or hydrogen-carbon compounds, in
Atlanta, a heavily wooded city that frequently fails to meet
federal air-quality standards.
   The study found that vegetation, principally trees, emit as many
hydrocarbons as cars and factories, and on a hot day can provide
enough hydrocarbons on their own to form illegal levels of ozone.
   Published in today's edition of Science magazine, the study says
the Environmental Protection Agency's decision to attack ozone
through limiting hydrocarbons is therefore doomed to failure.
   The Clean Air Act has sought to limit ozone through devices on
cars and in factories that reduce the emission of hydrocarbons,
paying little attention to nitrogen oxide, Chameides said.
   ``We've pursued the hydrocarbon strategy for about 10 years or
so, and I think it's pretty clear that for some reason we have not
been successful,'' Chameides said. ``We need to re-evaluate what
we're doing instead of continuing down the same garden path.''
   EPA spokesman Chris Rice agreed that air-quality rules have not
succeeded in reducing ozone levels significantly. But he said, ``We
estimate that in the absence of control programs, (hydrocarbon
levels) would be close to 80 percent higher than they actually are.
We've basically treaded water in the '80s.''
   During the creation of ozone, natural hydrocarbons are used up
faster than man-made hydrocarbons ``and thus can have a significant
effect in spite of their low concentrations,'' the study says.
   Chameides said his findings ``should be viewed cautiously,'' but
he added, ``Just because there are some uncertainties, you don't
ignore a source of 50 percent of hydrocarbons. We've got to include
all of the scientific evidence that's available.''
   He said he is anxious for other scientists to check his work and
for research to be conducted in other cities.

<HEAD>State Appellate Court Overturns Tax-Limiting Proposition 62</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SANTA ANA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A state appellate court has overturned
a 1986 initiative sponsored by tax activist Howard Jarvis that
requires voters to approve all taxes imposed by local governments.
   In declaring Proposition 62 unconstitutional, the 4th District
Court of Appeals ruled Thursday that requiring voter approval
constitutes a ``gross interference with the fiscal responsiblity of
local governments.''
   ``It's a sad day for the California taxpayer,'' said Joel Fox, a
spokesman for the California Tax Reduction Movement in Los Angeles.
The anti-tax group campaigned for Proposition 62 after Jarvis died
on Aug. 12, 1986. The measure was approved by state voters in
November 1986.
   The appellate court reversed a decision by a Santa Ana Superior
Court judge in January, who upheld Proposition 62 against a legal
challenge brought by the city of Westminster and said the measure
was ``constitutional and enforceable.''
   The initiative sponsored by Jarvis, the self-styled tax
reformer, requires local governmental agencies to stop collecting
any new tax imposed after July 31, 1985, unless it is approved by
the voters by Nov. 5, 1988.
   Javis drafted Proposition 62 several months before he died. He
said it was needed to plug loopholes in the landmark Proposition
13, the statewide initiative passed in 1978 that Jarvis backed and
which sharply curtailed property taxes.
   Agencies failing to comply with Proposition 62 would face the
loss of an equivalent amount of property tax revenue.
   Westminster is among 45 municipalities in California that faced
a potential loss of property tax revenue under the measure, state
and county officials said.
   The unanimous appellate court ruling, written by Justice Thomas
F. Crosby Jr., found that Westminster has the authority to impose a
utility users tax without a citywide vote.
   Just what effect the ruling will ultimately have is unclear,
however, because a similar case in Sonoma has been appealed to the
1st District Court of Appeals in San Francisco.
   Fox said his organization would appeal the 4th District ruling
to the state Supreme Court. If the high court chooses not to accept
the case on appeal, Fox said his group would consult with others to
consider mounting another initiative campaign.

<TEXT>
   U.S. and Vietnamese experts will
conduct unprecedented joint field investigations this month, asking
villagers about U.S. servicemen lost in Vietnam more than 15 years
ago, a U.S. official said.
   Lt. Col. Joe Harvey said Thursday that the two sides agreed in
talks earlier this week to form two joint teams to search a broad
area roughly 38 miles north of Vietnam's capital, Hanoi.
   The search will begin Sept. 25 and last about 10 days, Harvey
said. It would be the first time U.S. specialists will be allowed
to interview villagers in the countryside and the first joint field
activity since the two sides in late 1985 unearthed the wreckage of
a U.S. B-52 bomber near Hanoi.
   Harvey, commander of the U.S. Joint Casualty Resolution Center,
headed the U.S. side at this week's talks.
   ``We're going to do joint investigations of incidents, not just
crash sites, but places where people were last thought to be but we
don't know exactly what happened to them,'' Harvey said in a
telephone interview from Honolulu.
   ``I think it's a very significant development,'' he said. ``We
think this will be the first of many such joint activities,'' he
said.
   The United States wants to account for nearly 1,800 servicemen
and civilians listed as missing in action, or MIA, from the war
that cost about 58,000 American lives until U.S. forces withdrew in
1973.
   Since communist North Vietnam defeated U.S.-backed South Vietnam
in April 1975, ending the war, progress on the MIA issue has been
hampered by frequent bickering and the lack of diplomatic relations
between Washington and Hanoi.
   Harvey said each joint search team will include three U.S.
experts drawn from the casualty resolution center and the Army
Central Identification Laboratory, both Honolulu-based units
entrusted with resolving the fate of missing U.S. servicemen.
   The teams will talk to local government officials and villagers
who may have witnessed the incidents in which the American soldiers
were lost, he said.
   Harvey said the teams would focus on several of the 70
``discrepancy cases'' that the United States has asked Vietnam to
resolve urgently.
   In these cases, the United States says there is strong evidence
the men survived and were captured or otherwise came under
Vietnamese control, and Vietnamese authorities should have
information about them. They include cases where downed airmen
failed to emerge from prisoner-of-war camps.
   ``Potentially all the (discrepancy) cases could be resolved''
through a series of joint investigations, Harvey said.
   A special U.S. presidential envoy, retired Gen. John W. Vessey,
gave Foreign Minister Nguyen Co Thach the list of 70 names in
August 1987, when the two men reached agreement on accelerating
cooperation on the issue.
   In July this year, Thach pledged to try to resolve the 70 cases
by year's end.
   In return for cooperation on the MIA issue, the United States
has sent medical teams to Vietnam and encouraged private relief
organizations to help the impoverished nation. The sixth such
medical team visited Hanoi Sept. 6-7.

<HEAD>Emergency Laws Invoked To Tackle Insurgency</HEAD>

   The government closed all schools for
the day today, saying anti-government rebels planned to use the
children to provoke civil unrest on this war-torn island.
   ``The closure ... is a precautionary measure taken by the
government to prevent those groups committed to violence using
innocent schoolchildren to forment civil disturbances in the
country,'' a government statement said.
   On Thursday, the government imposed emergency laws to curb
strikes by Sinhalese militants who oppose an accord aimed at ending
five years of bloodshed in the northern and eastern provinces.
   President Junius R. Jayawardene's government invoked the
emergency laws declaring all shops, transport and health agencies
as essential services.
   Any essential services that close without the government's
permission may be indefinitely shut down or seized, it said.
   The moves follow a nationwide strike Monday called by the Janata
Vimukti Peramuna, or People's Liberation Front, to protest the
death of a Sinhalese lawyer while in police custody.
   The strike paralyzed businesses and public transport nationwide.
The government contends most businesses closed because of threats
by Sinhalese militants.
   The front is the most militant Sinhalese group. It has vowed to
kill anyone who supports the peace agreement that would grant
Tamils limited autonomy in the northern and eastern provinces and
end their war for a separate nation.
   At least 500 people, including members of the governing United
National Party, have been killed by Sinhalese militants.
   Sri Lanka last week merged the two provinces, which the Tamils
claim as their homeland, and said a provincial council would be
chosen later to take over administrative duties now handled by the
federal government.
   The merger is a key provision of the peace accord, signed by
India and Sri Lanka in July 1987. India, which has an estimated
47,000 troops stationed on the island, became involved in the
conflict because 60 million Tamils living in southern India are
sympathetic to the rebels' cause.
   Sinhalese militants contend the accord grants too many
concessions to the Tamils, who comprise 18 percent of the island's
16 million people.
   Tamils, mostly Hindu, claim they are discriminated against by
the Sinhalese, mostly Buddhists, who make up 75 percent of the
population and control the government and the military.

<HEAD>Top Labor Leaders Sent Into Internal Exile</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Riot squads used tear gas and a water
cannon to disperse daylong protests in downtown Santiago after
Chile's two top labor leaders were sent into internal exile.
   An undetermined number of protesters were taken into custody
during the demonstration Thursday, which was prompted when Manuel
Bustos, president of the United Workers Federation, and Arturo
Martinez, federation vice president, were exiled for 1{ years for
allegedly violating security laws by calling a violence-marred
national strike.
   Bustos was sent by police car to Parral, 210 miles south of
Santiago, and Martinez was flown in a police plane to Chanaral, 600
miles to the north.
   Each must spend the next 541 days within those city limits.
   Jack Joyce, president of the International Bricklayers Union,
said he and other U.S., Canadian and European unionists were
``viciously attacked'' by military police when they joined the
protest march and were caught up in the confrontation.
   Joyce said through a spokeswoman, Mary Dresser, at union
headquarters in Washington that union leaders from North America
and 10 European nations had joined a protest march to the Palace of
Justice when they were ``caught in a melee'' between demonstrators
and police.
   Joyce said he and William C. Doherty of the AFL-CIO's American
Institute for Free Labor Development were knocked down and
tear-gassed by police.
   Joyce said six other U.S. members of the delegation also were
roughed up. Dresser indicated that none of the Americans required
hospitalization.
   Bustos and Martinez were found guilty and sentenced Aug. 20 by
the Supreme Court, which reversed a lower court acquittal. The high
court also gave federation strike coordinator Moises Labrana a
60-day suspended jail sentence.
   The three were convicted of breaking Chilean internal security
law by calling for a general strike last Oct. 7 to protest the
right-wing military government's economic policies and to support
demands for wage increases.
   The strike received limited support, but set off street
disturbances in which three people were killed.
   The two union leaders had been free pending an appeal, which was
unsucessful.

   Demonstrators against government austerity
measures smashed store windows with rocks, looted shops and clashed
with riot police. Officials said leftist guerrillas infiltrated the
downtown protest.
   Thousands of pedestrians trying to escape the riots Thursday ran
through streets filled with tear gas fired by police. Most were
unable to find shelter because stores and restaurants closed their
doors when the violence started.
   The government gave no report on the number of injured, but two
protesters were seen bleeding from the head. Police made 30 arrests.
   Small groups of demonstrators blocked traffic Thursday afternoon
and shouted insults against harsh anti-inflation austerity measures
announced last week by the center-left government of President Alan
Garcia.
   The measures included price increases of as much as 300 percent
for food staples and gasoline to eliminate costly government
subsidies that were contributing to inflation expected to top 900
percent this year.
   In addition to the protests against the steep price increases,
about 300 striking civilian workers from a navy shipyard clashed
with police troopers who fired tear gas grenades to keep the
strikers from reaching the government palace.
   Police said members of the Maoist-inspired Shining Path
guerrilla movement infiltrated the demonstrators and urged them on
to violence. Men in hoods were seen among the protesters.
   Police said the protesters smashed store windows and looted a
book shop and a clothing store only two blocks from the government
palace.
   Riot police regained control in the downtown area after several
hours.
   In other violence Thursday, police said an assassination team of
Maoist rebels fired on a navy captain as he was driving his young
daughter to school in an upper-class neighborhood, wounding him
twice in the stomach and twice in the left leg.
   Police said the daughter, whose age was not available, was not
hurt in the attack.
   Four suspected members of the Shining Path armed with three
revolvers and sticks of dynamite were arrested as they tried to
escape on foot, police said.

   Mario Biaggi, whose congressional career ended
last month after he was convicted of racketeering, saw his
electoral career end with a defeat in the Democratic primary he
said he did not want to win.
   New York voters Thursday gave two other prominent politicians
tainted by political scandal the chance to remain in office as they
seek to clear their names.
   State Senate Minority Leader Manfred Ohrenstein and Rep. Robert
Garcia both survived Democratic primary challenges in districts
where winning the primary is tantamount to election.
   Biaggi, who had quit his seat after his conviction in the
Wedtech scandal, was still given a good chance because of his
popularity. But the voters turned instead to state Assemblyman
Eliot Engel.
   With 97 percent of the vote counted, Engel had 12,831 votes, or
50 percent, to 6,538, or 25 percent, for former state Assemblyman
Vincent Marchiselli and 6,405, or 25 percent, for Biaggi.
   Though Biaggi will be on the November ballot as the Republican
candidate, Engel is expected to be the easy winner.
   Garcia's name has come up in testimony in the Wedtech case, but
he has not been charged with any wrongdoing. He said Thursday night
that the questions about his connections to Wedtech made his
primary victory sweeter.
   ``After 22 years in public with never as much as a bad word
against me, this hit me like a ton of bricks,'' said Garcia. ``I
feel the people of my district said, `OK, Bob, we're in this
together, let's go.'''
   With all the returns in, Garcia had 16,517 votes, or 60 percent,
to 7,515, or 27 percent, for Pedro Espada, a community health
center director, and 3,471, or 13 percent, for Ismael Betancourt,
who had lost two earlier primaries to Garcia.
   Ohrenstein, a 28-year veteran of the state Legislature, narrowly
beat back a challenge from Joseph Rose, 29, the son of a wealthy
developer.
   Rose spent more than $500,000, most of it family money, trying
to make sure every potential voter in the district knew that
Ohrenstein has been indicted for putting campaign workers on the
Senate payroll during the 1986 elections. Ohrenstein has denied any
wrongdoing.
   In suburban Westchester County, former state official Nita Lowey
defeated Hamilton Fish III and businessman Dennis Mehiel in a
Democratic primary for the right to oppose Republican Rep. Joseph
DioGuardi in November.
   The Fish family has been active in state GOP circles since the
party was founded and Fish's father, Hamilton Fish Jr., represents
a neighboring district in Congress that had previously been
represented by another Hamilton Fish, the young Fish's grandfather.

<HEAD>Rural Areas Need More Services To Address Mental Health Problems</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DOUG RICHARDSON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>INDIANAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The 1988 drought has increased the need for
more mental health services in rural areas, says a former Cabinet
official.
   ``The drought this summer has made a bad situation worse for
many,'' said Bob Bergland, the ex-secretary of agriculture who
headed a special commission on rural mental health problems.
   Citing research conducted before the drought, the National
Mental Health Association's commission on rural mental health
issued a study Thursday recommending the creation of a federal
office of rural mental health and increased funds for alcohol, drug
abuse and mental health programs.
   The study, ``Rural Mental Health: The Time for Action Is Now,''
also recommends a broader crisis counseling network for farmers.
   ``We're fighting a myth that rural America is a healthier place
to live. If that was ever true, it's not true today,'' said Dr.
Peter G. Beeson, director of planning for the Nebraska Department
of Public Institutions.
   Bergland said much of the stress on rural residents is triggered
by economic problems.
   Besides the economy, other parts of the rural environment have
changed, the study said. The traditional image of a closely-knit
rural community revolving around church and family activities no
longer fits, the report said.
   Consequently, psychological distress becomes more common, and
rural residents' problems often aren't treated promptly because
rural areas frequently lack mental health services, Bergland said.
   ``The biggest problem isn't that we're sicker in rural places.
The problem is we don't have resources,'' said Bergland during a
news conference to unveil the study.

<TEXT>
   Authorities expect to file charges soon in
the apparent sabotage of O-rings made for space shuttle booster
rockets, an FBI agent says.
   HydraPak, which manufactures the O-rings in West Jordan, a Salt
Lake suburb, discovered in June that a small number of the
rubber-like seals had been deliberately cut.
   Officials notified booster maker Morton Thiokol, the FBI and
NASA. The federal agencies began a joint investigation.
   ``We do have suspects and the case will be prosecutable,'' FBI
Special Agent Cal Clegg said Thursday. ``Right from the inception,
we have been discussing the case with the U.S. Attorney's office,
and we feel that arrests or indictments will be imminent.''
   Clegg said charges could be filed within a month.
   Clegg said he did not know whether more than one person was
suspected, but the number ``could expand. ... It depends on the
evidence that is gathered.''
   James Dockstader, HydraPak vice president of production, said
earlier that none of the damaged seals had been shipped to Morton
Thiokol, which manufactures the rockets at its northern Utah plant.
   He said Thursday he could not comment on the FBI probe. However,
he said HydraPak's internal investigation had determined that
allegations of lax security, shipment of substandard O-rings and a
company cover-up were without foundation.
   Dockstader said the internal investigation, completed Monday,
found no ``irregularities in manufacturing, shipment or inspection
processes'' or in the security procedures at the plant about 20
miles south of Salt Lake City.
   He said steps had been taken to increase security, but would not
give details.
   The O-rings are used as seals between segments of the booster
rocket to prevent leakage of superhot gases from burning propellant.
   After the 1986 Challenger explosion, a presidential commission
found that an O-ring allowed a plume of fiery gas to escape and
ignite the shuttle's main liquid fuel tank, triggering the blast
that killed the shuttle's seven astronauts.
   Improvements to the booster joint have been the focus of Morton
Thiokol's effort to redesign the rocket. Last month the company
conducted a final test-firing of the shuttle Discovery, the first
flight planned since the Challenger disaster.
   The National Aeronautics and Space Administration has scheduled
the launch for late this month or early October.

<HEAD>Former Navy Official to Plead in Wedtech Scandal</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A former civilian Navy official agreed to plead
guilty to taking a $60,000 bribe from Wedtech and related charges
involving the scandal-plagued former defense contractor and another
company.
   Richard D. Ramirez, once head of the Navy's small business
program, will plead guilty to four criminal counts charging him
with conspiracy to receive bribes and filing false income tax
returns, U.S. Attorney Rudolph Giuliani said Thursday.
   According to the charges, Ramirez, 40, of Clifton, Va.,
conspired to take a $60,000 bribe from Wedtech _ a now-defunct
contractor _ for his help in obtaining $135 million in no-bid Navy
contracts to build floating docks. The docks were designed to move
supplies from ship to shore for the U.S. Rapid Deployment Force.
   At the time, Ramirez was director of the Navy's Office of Small
and Disadvantaged Business Utilization, and was responsible for
assisting minority-owned and minority-operated businesses obtain
contracts without competitive bidding under a special Small
Business Administration Program, said Assistant U.S. Attorney
Baruch Weiss.
   Former Wedtech officials have admitted committing fraud to keep
the company in the program even though it was neither
minority-owned nor controlled.
   One of those officials, former executive vice president Mario
Moreno, testified at the racketeering trial of ex-Rep. Mario Biaggi
earlier this year that Ramirez was ``a mole'' who supplied Wedtech
with inside information from the office of then-Navy Secretary John
F. Lehman.
   Biaggi, a Bronx Democrat, and five others were convicted of
various corruption charges in August. They are awaiting sentencing.
   Ramirez also was charged with plotting to take $120,000 in
bribes from United Chem Con Corp. of Lancaster, Pa., for help in
obtaining no-bid contracts worth $54 million to supply the Navy
with other equipment.
   In addition, Ramirez was charged with failing to include the
money he got from Wedtech and United Chem Con on his 1982 and 1983
tax returns.
   He faces up to five years in prison and a $10,000 fine on each
of the conspiracy counts and three years imprisonment and $250,000
in fines on each tax count, said Weiss.

   Customs agents realized something was fishy
when anchovy importer Andes Trading Co. listed a bogus address in
New York City.
   Inside a 1,000-carton shipment of anchovies, investigators found
137 cartons holding 2,745 pounds of cocaine, federal officials said
at a news conference Thursday.
   Roberto Alcaino, 51, of Chile, listed as the consignee on the
manifest, was arrested in New York about Thursday shortly after he
accepted the load, minus all but one carton of cocaine.
   Customs agents intercepted the shipment from Argentina Sept. 6
aboard a German-flagged cargo ship at the Holt Marine Terminal in
Camden, N.J., and seized a container supposedly holding 1,000
cartons of anchovies.
   In each of 137 boxes, agents found two large anchovy tins
containing seven or eight 2{-pound bricks of cocaine, officials
said.
   U.S. Customs agent David Warren said the drug traffickers added
lead weights and sand to the tins holding cocaine to approximate
the weight of anchovies, but were off by about 5 pounds.
   Sam Billbrough, head of the U.S. Drug Enforcement
Administration's Philadelphia office, called Alcaino a high-level
trafficker.
   Alcaino was charged with possession with intent to distribute
cocaine and faces charges in Philadelphia of importing cocaine.
   If convicted, he would face a minimum 10 years in prison on each
charge, said acting U.S. Attorney Thomas H. Lee.

   For Amelia Ochoa and five generations

   At last count, 22 family members had gathered under the roof of
Mrs. Ochoa's white brick home as wind began to bend palm trees
Thursday.
   ``I think my house is good enough to go through a hurricane, but

   ``We always get together for the hurricane,'' said Mrs. Guvman's

   While the men boarded windows and doors with plywood and
reinforced them with planks, bags of groceries were carried into
the house and garbage cans were filled with drinking water.
   In the livng room, a shrine to the Virgin Mary stood as a symbol
of the faith that Mrs. Ochoa, 67, believes is her family's best
protection.
   Myria Cadriel, 13, brooded about the certain cancellation of her
first game as an eighth-grade cheerleader. ``I'm afraid school's
not going to be here when I get back,'' she said.

<TEXT>
   Top U.S. officials are for the first time
talking seriously about removing military bases from the
Philippines, and the chief Philippines negotiator says the country
is preparing for such a possibility but still negotiating.
   Secretary of State George P. Shultz said Thursday the United
States wants to keep giant Clark Air Base and Subic Navy Base and
other installations in the Philippines but ``there are alternatives
which we are having now to examine.''
   Shultz said talks in Manila on bases compensation and other
issues ``basically aren't going well.''
   On Wednesday, Defense Secretary Frank Carlucci told visiting
Philippine Foreign Minister Raul Manglapus, in what one official
described as blunt terms, that the United States is prepared to
pull out of the bases if the Philippines insists on too much
compensation.
   Other officials have suggested they might be relocated to Guam
or elsewhere in the Pacific, with estimates of the cost of such a
move ranging over $10 billion. Defense officials have said in the
past that the bases are vital to security of a vast area stretching
from Southeast Asia into the Persian Gulf.
   Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev said in a speech today that
the Kremlin is ready to give up its base at Cam Ranh Bay, Vietnam,
if U.S. forces leave the Philippines.
   U.S. officials have said this would not be a balanced exchange.
Cam Ranh Bay is the Soviets' major naval deployment base abroad,
while Clark and Subic are the United States's largest foreign bases.
   Manglapus, in an interview Thursday, said the two sides in the
negotiations now in recess are not far apart on how much the Reagan
administration should seek from Congress in direct payment for use
of the bases, but several other issues in the talks remain
unresolved.
   ``Both sides agree that the hard component (cash) of our mutual
proposals were not too far apart and that in addition we would be
looking for creative ways of raising the level of the compensation
to that which was proposed by the Philippines,'' Manglapus said.
   He said additional help might come in the form of procurement of
Philippine products and the writing off of some of the nation's $26
billion foreign debt.
   Manglapus did not say how much aid has been offered by the U.S.
panel, but congressional sources have said it is close to $500
million, including a doubling of direct bases-related aid to $360
million for fiscal 1989. Manglapus declined to say how much the
Philippines originally wanted, but Manila news reports have put the
demand as high as $1.2 billion a year.
   Manglapus said he was not surprised by Carlucci's remarks about
pulling out and asserted that the Philippines is preparing for a
loss of the bases.
   He said studies show that conversion of the bases to civilian
use could provide even more benefits, including replacement of the
thousands of jobs that would be lost if the United States pulls out.
   He said that while the bases provide significant economic
benefit, even American analysts agree that their security value to
the Philippines is minimal.
   ``Your own analysts and your own leaders stress the priority
importance of the global strategy that is fulfilled by these
bases,'' he said.
   Manglapus said unresolved issues in the bases talks include the
storage of nuclear weapons on the bases, ownership of improvements
to the bases, procurement policies and the write-off of debts for
military equipment.
   ``We have not gotten anything out of the American panel,'' he
said.
   Manglapus said he is discussing the bases issue with a variety
of U.S. officials but has not moved the negotiations from Manila to
Washington.
   Surveys of Filipinos show only a small percentage of outright
opposition to the bases, he said, but a large number of people say
they would want the bases out if the Americans do not improve the
bases agreement, including additional compensation.
   Manglapus, who lived in U.S. self-exile during the last decade
of ex-President Ferdinand E. Marcos' rule, said he has found
Democrats more responsive on Philippine issues than Republicans,
but he said the views of the two parties on the bases appear to be
the same.
   Manglapus plans to meet Shultz again at the United Nations at
the end of the month.
   The Philippine official also will attend the New York debut of a
musical comedy he wrote during his exile. The play, which deals
with the U.S. takeover of the Philippines between 1898 and 1902, is
called, ``Manifest Destiny: An Evening of Yankee Panky.''

   The number of AIDS cases in the United States
will jump nearly five-fold by 1992, and about 263,000 people will
have died from the disease by then, the national Centers for
Disease Control predicts.
   As of this week, 72,766 AIDS cases have been reported to the
CDC; 41,064 people, or 56 percent, are dead. By the end of 1992,
the number of cases will hit 365,000, and 72 percent of those
patients will be dead, the CDC says.
   The predictions came Thursday in a report summarizing the CDC's
latest quarterly report on AIDS to the White House's Domestic
Policy Council.
   Actual AIDS reporting has run slightly higher than predicted;
the agency in 1986 predicted 15,800 cases in 1986 and 23,000 in
1987, and the actual totals were 17,100 and 25,200, respectively.
   ``We think they're very close,'' said Dr. Tim Dondero, an AIDS
specialist at the Atlanta-based health agency. ``I think the
message is that, at least for the first couple of years, this ...
method gives some pretty reliable estimates.''
   The CDC in 1986 issued its AIDS predictions for 1991, which
forecast 270,000 cases by the end of that year.
   In the report released Thursday, the agency predicts 80,000
cases of AIDS in 1992 alone, with 66,000 deaths that year. A total
of 172,000 living AIDS patients will require medical care in 1992,
at a cost of $5 billion to $13 billion, the CDC predicts.
   The CDC also said its current estimate of 1 million to 1.5
million Americans currently infected with the virus which causes
AIDS is ``a reasonable working estimate,'' based on mathematical
analysis by experts convened by the CDC in April.
   Thursday's report noted that the national infection estimate has
remained the same since it was devised in 1986. The rate is about
0.4 percent to 0.6 percent.
   ``This does not mean that no new infections have occurred,'' the
CDC said. ``The 1986 estimate was based on preliminary data, and
was probably too high (at the time).''

<HEAD>Confessed Bomber-Forger Critical After Drug Overdose</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The man who admitted killing two people
with homemade bombs to cover up his forgeries of Mormon documents
was in critical but stable condition today from a drug overdose in
prison, a hospital official said.
   Mark Hofmann, 33, was in a coma when taken by helicopter from
the Utah State Prison to the University of Utah Health Sciences
Center, officials said. He began coming out of the coma shortly
before midnight Thursday.
   Hospital spokesman John Dwan said the overdose was from an
undetermined tricyclic anti-depressant drug, which showed up in lab
tests at toxic levels.
   Hofmann also suffered ``minor to moderate burns'' on his right
forearm and chest, he said. He said the cause of the burns was not
immediately known, but they were not considered serious.
   Hofmann had been prescribed a sleeping medication, but Juan
Benavidez, a state Department of Corrections spokesman, said he did
not know what it was, or the dosage.
   Hofmann is serving a five years to life prison term following
his January 1987 plea agreement, in which he admitted killing two
people in 1985.
   At a hearing before the Board of Pardons in January, Hofmann
said he felt remorse for the families of his victims, but the board
ruled 2-1 that he should spend the rest of his life in prison.
   From 1981 to 1985, Hofmann had virtually set the agenda for
scholars of Mormon history with a string of discoveries of
purported documents relating to early church history. Most later
proved to be his own forgeries, some of which were expertly done
while others were crude.

<HEAD>Shirley Temple Black Angry Over `Shirley T' Soft Drink</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Shirley Temple Black is angry about plans to
advertise a new soft drink that borrows her name, but the maker of
Shirley T says she has nothing to complain about.
   Soda Pop Kids, a small regional company that has been selling a
bottled version of the traditional Shirley Temple cocktail for
about a year, is boasting about a new TV ad campaign.
   ``It's an infringement of my rights,'' Ms. Black fumed Thursday.
``They're using my name without my permission.''
   But Brad Weidman, the 26-year-old founder of Soda Pop Kids, says
years of use in bars has made Shirley Temple a generic name for a
non-alcoholic drink concocted of lemon-lime soda and cherry
flavoring.
   He is pressing ahead with plans to expand distribution of
Shirley T, and of his two other flavors, Berryblue and Peachykeen,
in additional Los Angeles area markets. Included in the plans is an
Oct. 1 kickoff of a TV ad campaign.
   ``It's in the good hands of my attorney,'' the former child
actress said when asked what she would do about the ads. Her
lawyer, Richard Ross of Los Angeles, didn't respond to a telephone
request for comment.
   Weidman doesn't mind borrowing others' success: The ads feature
animated dancing fruit reminiscent of the popular California Raisin
commercials.
   ``It's like that,'' Weidman said of his ad, ``but a hundred
times better.''

   A man who says he's paid $2,000 in traffic
fines held up a sign warning motorists to slow down because police
were ahead _ and was promptly arrested for obstructing traffic.
   ``I stood there for about 20 minutes,'' John Thiry said
Thursday. ``That would have been about a total of $3,000 (in fines)
they would have gotten people for.''
   Thiry, 22, of Pittsburgh, was arrested Wednesday on obstructing
traffic charges after he stood on Schenley Park Plaza with a sign
that read ``Slow down. Police ahead with VASCAR.''
   VASCAR is a device akin to a stop watch that calculates a car's
speed by measuring the time it takes for a car to travel between
two lines painted across the street.
   ``I stopped a lot of people from having a miserable day,'' he
said. ``People were beeping at me. They were waving.''
   Thiry said Pittsburgh police ``make you go 25 (mph) where they
know 25 is an unreasonably slow speed. Try and go the speed limit
and just see what happens. See how many people pass you.''
   Police Chief Ralph Pampena said there are signs posted
throughout the city warning drivers that police use VASCAR devices
to enforce speed limits.
   ``The signs are very clear,'' he said. ``If the signs are posted
as 25 mph, then that's the speed we expect people to go.''
   Thiry said he was upset because he had been issued many tickets,
recently had lost his license for the third time and had to leave a
job as a salesman.
   The tickets included at least five in the past two years from
police using VASCAR devices, plus others for speeding on the
interstate, he said. He estimated he has paid about $2,000 in fines
but said he has never been involved in a traffic accident.
   Police Sgt. Leo McCafferty and officer William O'Rourke said
they noticed motorists suddenly were driving slower and arrested
Thiry after a motorist informed them of the sign.
   Thiry said he will appeal the charge of obstructing traffic,
which carries a fine of $48.50.
   ``I wasn't blocking traffic,'' Thiry said. ``I don't think they
had the right to arrest me because I wanted to warn people. What if
I was just yelling? That's freedom of speech.''
   Edward Patterson, commander of the traffic division, said, ``Any
time you're out in the street, you're obstructing traffic.''

Leader</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Mayor Art Agnos has ordered two
investigations into the alleged police beating of labor leader
Dolores Huerta, who lost her spleen and had three ribs broken
during a political demonstration.
   ``I am deeply concerned and disturbed about this incident,''
Agnos said Thursday after visiting the United Farm Workers
co-founder at her hospital bed.
   Ms. Huerta, 58, was listed in stable condition today at San
Francisco General Hospital. The beating occurred Wednesday during
protests at a campaign appearance by Republican presidential
candidate George Bush.
   Agnos ordered Police Chief Frank Jordan and the director of the
Office of Citizen Complaints to conduct separate investigations
into the incident.
   Ms. Huerta was among demonstrators who gathered on sidewalks in
front of a hotel on Union Square.
   After 20 minutes of warning of protesters to move behind
barricades, police tactical squads began to sweep the crowd, Jordan
said. ``Somewhere in the half-block segment, she apparently was
injured,'' he said.
   Agnos reviewed police tapes for 90 minutes. He said he
identified Ms. Huerta in the crowd but neither he nor Jordan could
see on film whether she was being struck.
   ``We could see she was being very cooperative,'' Agnos said. `We
could even read her lips saying `I am moving.'''
   At a news conference in front of the hospital Thursday, family
and friends of Ms. Huerta's expressed outrage at the alleged police
beating.
   ``I want to condemn the city of San Francisco and the Police
Department for permitting this type of activity to go on,'' said
tearful son Emilio Huerta.
   He said his mother was trying to speak to reporters outside the
St. Francis hotel to respond to Bush's statements against the UFW
grape boycott when she was ``herded'' into an area ``where she was
severely beaten by a member of the San Francisco Police
Department.''
   ``It wasn't a beating over the head or push _ she was speared
and stabbed to where her spleen was shattered,'' he said.

   Mail service to Great Britain is being

   Postmaster General Anthony M. Frank said he has been advised by
the British Post Office that the strike there has ended, and that
the agency is again accepting mail.
   The U.S. Postal Service embargoed mail to the United Kingdom on
Sept. 7, when authorities in that nation reported that they were
unable to accept incoming mail because of a strike.
   Because of a backlog of mail to be sorted and delivered in Great
Britain, however, Frank cautioned, there may still be some delays
in service.

<DATELINE>SOUTH ORANGE, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Principal Joe Clark, whose get-tough
stance on school drop-outs won him acrimony from his school board
but put him on the cover of Time, is running for political office
for the first time.
   Clark said Thursday he will be the Republican candidate in a
special election for Essex County's Third Freeholder District in
November. Clark was asked to run by county Republicans, said Essex
GOP leader John P. Renna.
   ``Nationally, he's hot stuff,'' Renna said.
   Clark, known to roam the halls of Paterson's East Side High
School with a bat and bullhorn, achieved national attention in
December when he clashed with the school board after expelling 61
students.
   His stance drew praise from U.S. Secretary of Education William
Bennett and his story was told in a movie released this summer,
``Lean on Me,'' which was filmed at the school.
   Clark, 50, lives in South Orange, one of four towns in the
heavily Democratic Third District. An interim freeholder has served
the area since Democrat Cardell Cooper left in May to become county
administrator.
   ``I am a great administrator,'' Clark said. ``I'm capable of
bringing situations from shame to fame instantaneously.''
   ``I think they're looking for someone with a name, who can
present a challenge,'' said Democratic Freeholder Sara Bost.
   Clark, who will run against Leroy J. Jones Jr. of East Orange,
admitted that he didn't know who his opponent was.
   ``I could care less,'' he said.
   Jones is chairman of the city's Affirmative Action Review Board
and the East Orange Citizens Advisory Board. A finance manager, he
holds a degree in accounting from Seton Hall University.

<TEXT>
   The wives of two American professors held
hostage in Lebanon said today they believe the kidnappers' demands
have softened and their husbands will be freed soon.
   Badr Turner, wife of Jesse Turner, a mathematics professor, and
Feryal Polhill, wife of professor Robert Polhill, spoke a day after
the Islamic Jihad for the Liberation of Palestine issued a
handwritten statement and a photograph of two hostages to a Western
news agency in Beirut.
   The statement, written in Arabic, hinted that the Moslem group
would free its hostages if the Reagan administration undertook an
initiative within one week in support of the Palestinian uprising
in Israeli-occupied territories. The unrest began Dec. 8.
   The two American educators pictured _ Turner, 41, of Boise,
Idaho and Alann Steen, 49, of Boston _ have been held for nearly 20
months. They were seized along with Polhill, 54, originally of New
York City, and Mithileshwar Singh, 60, an Indian who is a legal
resident alien of the United States, on Jan. 24, 1987 from the
campus of the U.S.-affiliated Beirut University by gunmen posing as
riot police.
   Official U.S. policy is that Washington will not bargain with
the captors.
   ``We feel they are going to be released,'' Badr Turner said in a
telephone interview. But she added: ``We don't want to be
over-optimistic to avoid disappointment.''
   Mrs. Turner, a Lebanese of Palestinian origin, delivered the
couple's first child, a baby girl, six months after her husband was
kidnapped.
   ``It's a positive statement,'' she said of the message released
by Islamic Jihad. ``It looks like they've (the kidnappers) relaxed
their conditions. This makes one be more, may be a little more,
optimistic.''
   ``We can't say anything concrete has happened but it's a step
toward a solution,'' said Mrs. Polhill in a separate interview.
   Steen's wife, Virginia, was travelling in the United States and
could not be reached.
   The picture showed Steen and Turner, smiling broadly, resting on
a mattress with a flowered pattern and a violet pillow. Each was
holding a cigarette. Both wore navy blue outfits and had long hair.
Steen was clean-shaven, and Turner had a bushy beard.
   The Islamic Jihad group is believed to be sympathetic to the
Palestinians as well as Iran's revolutionary patriarch Ayatollah
Ruhollah Khomeini.
   The four educators are among 17 foreigners missing and believed
held hostage in Lebanon, nine of them Americans. The longest held
is Terry Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent of The
Associated Press, who was kidnapped in Beirut on March 16, 1985.
   The statement said, ``Our organization plans to undertake a
positive initiative to ease the issue of the hostages. But it needs
adequate reactions by international forums toward the rights of our
Moslem (Palestinian) people in their struggle against the Zionist
enemy.
   ``The U.S. administration should be the first among the
governments that should declare a clear, positive stance toward the
rights of our people in harmony with its claims of defending human
rights.''
   It concluded, ``At this sensitive stage of the uprising led by
comrade strugglers in the interior (of the occupied territories),
we offer this initiative and expect from the governments concerned
a response within one week of the publication of this statement. We
then will be ready to advance further in this initiative.''
   The statement said the group's offer was timed to coincide with
the 10th month of the Palestinian uprising.
   Steen was a communications instructor when kidnapped from the
college and Turner a visiting professor of mathematics and computer
science. Polhill lectured in accounting and Singh was a visiting
professor of finance.

   A collection of works by Nikolai I. Bukharin, a
Bolshevik theorist shot under dictator Josef Stalin, has been
published in another step toward his rehabilitation, Tass reported.
   The official news agency said the new book includes Bukharin's
articles and comments on communist theory and party politics,
economic policy and culture. It said the book, prepared by the
Institute of Marxism-Leninism of the party's Central Committee,
coincides with the centennial of Bukharin's birth.
   Tass called Bukharin a ``distinguished social scientist whose
name and writings have for long been unfairly buried in oblivion.''
   Bukharin was cleared in February of spying charges for which he
was shot in 1938. The party re-admitted him posthumously in July.
   The rehabilitation was part of a review launched by Soviet
leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev of Communist Party officials killed or
arrested by Stalin.
   Bukharin, an economist, favored moderate economic policies that
are similar to those being implemented by Gorbachev.
   The Soviet press has published several articles in recent months
on Bukharin. On Tuesday, the newspaper Sovietskaya Kultura reported
a lecture he had delivered in Paris two years before he was shot.

   Beverly Hills school officials have
gone into the fashion business in hopes of cashing in on the
community's trendy image to help pay the bills.
   More than 50 products featuring pastels and geometric designs
with the Beverly Hills High School logo were to be unveiled today
in Los Angeles. Next month, London gets a look at the fashion line.
   School board member Frank Fenton suggested the idea three years
ago. ``Not every child can attend a Beverly Hills school, but I
want to give every child the opportunity to wear our T-shirts,
sweat shirts and our logo,'' he said.
   20th Century Fox is handling licensing and sales. Fox officials
would not quote a price range for the clothes, but the district
will get 60 percent of the profits. The district hopes to make
$250,000 this year.
   The district, with an annual budget of $26 million, is known for
high teacher salaries, small class sizes and a high school
cafeteria where students have the option of ordering a meal a la
carte.
   But falling enrollments, increasing operating expenses and
property tax limits have strained resources.
   The idea hasn't been a hit with all Beverly Hills residents,
however.
   ``This is one more piece of tinsel being added to the city,''
said Betty Harris, a longtime resident and community activist.
``Rodeo Drive is a circus and it has taken over everything.''

<TEXT>
   Forty-one homeless people whose possessions
were destroyed in a police sweep will receive $500 each, according
to terms of a settlement that some recipients said could free them
from life on the street.
   The city admitted no wrongdoing in the agreement, which provides
$20,500 to be divided among those affected in the incident. City
officials confirmed the settlement Thursday but declined to comment.
   The claims resulted from a June police sweep of two homeless
camps in the shadow of City Hall. Authorities said they gave an
estimated 50 people 30 minutes to clear out, but many were away
looking for food or work. They returned to find their possessions _
including medicine, identification papers and clothing _ were gone.
   Although the agreement doesn't guarantee that such sweeps won't
be conducted again, lawyers representing the homeless said it is an
important victory that should discourage officials from similar
seizures.
   ``I believe this has already affected the attitude and practice
of police everywhere in this city,'' said attorney James H. Davis,
who filed the claims on behalf of the homeless men and women.
   Many of the recipients said they would use the $500 to find
permanent shelter.
   ``We're going to get a place and get married,'' said Joseph
Wilson, 27, of his plans for the money.
   ``I'm trying to get ahead, I'm trying to have a future,'' said
Wilson, who added he has been sleeping on the street while studying
word processing at a technical school.
   Joseph Gabriel, 48, said he hopes to ``get a place and get off
the street. The streets are making me old.''
   However, Ted Hayes, an activist for the homeless and one of the
41 to file a claim against the city, warned: ``Five hundred dollars
is not going to get anybody off the street.''

<TEXT>
   The power of suggestion has taken on a new
meaning for American corporations as increased competition forces
them to look for cost-cutting measures from within.
   The old employee suggestion box is getting a workout, and
companies are rewarding innovative ideas handsomely.
   The National Association of Suggestion Systems says its 900
member companies saved more than $2 billion last year as a result
of their employees' suggestion programs. Workers received a total
of $150 million in award payments for suggestions adopted.
   One of those employees was Edward H. Anderson, 51, of Yorba
Linda, Calif., who was named the association's ``Suggester of the
Year'' at the organization's annual conference in Orlando this week.
   Anderson, a scientist for Hughes Aircraft Co., submitted ideas
that resulted in cost-saving improvements totaling $22 million in
1987, company officials said.
   The company program does not provide for direct financial
rewards, but ``there's a direct relationship between your
suggestions and your salary raises,'' Anderson says.
   One of his suggestions saved about 15,000 hours of technician
labor annually. Another lightened the weight of satellites, cutting
down on launch costs.
   ``When you come up with a really good idea, you know you did
something important,'' Anderson said Thursday. ``It's my way of
keeping on top of the Christmas tree.''
   Anderson, who works in the materials and process laboratory of
Hughes' Space and Communications Group, is a compulsive suggester.
In his 14 years of employment, he has submitted 200 ideas, with
half of them adopted. Hughes said the total cost savings amounted
to $75 million.
   Runner-up Richard Makaiwi recommended the use of a pneumatic
underground piercing tool for installation of natural gas services
to customers of Pacific Gas & Electric Co. in San Jose, Calif.
   The suggestion will provide an estimated savings of more than $1
million in each of the next five years. It also enriched Makaiwi's
bank account by $25,000.

   High waves crashed along the Gulf of
Mexico coast today and flooding left thousands homeless as deadly
Hurricane Gilbert bore down on this border city, officials said
today.
   Fleeing residents crowded into shelters as the storm pushed
across the gulf carrying 120 mph winds. The hurricane left 17
people dead on the Yucatan Peninsula, officials said. Ten people
were reported missing, and hundreds of thousands were driven from
their homes on the battered peninsula.
   ``We're seeing the first victims. The gulf area is flooding and
we're getting rains and wind,'' said Hector Flores of the city
press office, as Gilbert's outer band pounded the coast with heavy
rain.
   The city in a news release said at least 10,000 people spent the
night in shelters set up at schools, churches and public buildings.
Countless others fled homes in low-lying and poor areas. At least
5,000 people were rendered homeless near Matamoros.
   Sporadic rains and wind gusts of up to 35 mph were felt today as
officials hustled to complete evacuating residents from the
lowlands of the Laguna Madre area and the fishing town of La Pesca,
both north of the Yucatan.
   The shelters were being stocked with blankets, food and water
for up to 70,000 people. When the 450-mile-wide hurricane slammed
into the Caribbean resort of Cancun Wednesday, winds topped 160 mph.
   ``An indescribable, desolate panorama'' was how Ranulfo Garza of
Novedades de Yucatan described first reports today from isolated
towns along Yucatan's north coast. ``It looks like an earthquake
struck instead of a hurricane. The destruction is incredible.''
   Garza said dozens of homes in Progreso were damaged or
destroyed. Beaches were reconfigured or simply disappeared during
the storm, appliances and furniture floated in empty streets, and
large fishing vessels and yachts were deposited on land or ``piled
together like logs.''
   The storm left about 300,000 people homeless in Yucatan state
and another 10,000 homeless in Campeche, the government news agency
Notimex said today. Merida remained without electricity and long
lines formed for drinking water outside government buildings.
   In Matamoros, as shelters began filling up, one woman said she
had nowhere else to turn.
   ``Our house is very old, and it isn't any good. It could fall on
top of us,'' said Guadalupe Flores Martinez, 56, who stood with her
family in the gusting wind outside a shelter at a local grade
school.
   A steady stream of traffic jammed the highway leading inland as
the hurricane threatened to strike the gulf coast just 20 miles
from Matamoros, a city of about 280,000 people south of
Brownsville, Texas.
   The National Weather Service in Miami said if Gilbert continued
in the same direction, it would strike the coast near the
Texas-Mexico border sometime this evening.
   Luis Montiel, spokesman for the Tamaulipas state government,
said that in the oil port of Tampico, with a population of about
700,000, people were evacuated from low-lying marshy areas to
higher ground. Tampico lies about 200 miles south of Matamoros.
   U.S. and Mexican officials opened floodgates in dams on the Rio
Grande to prevent flash floods downriver once the storm hit.
   The hurricane left much of the Yucatan without communication,
electricity or drinking water after it hit Wednesday. Most roads
were blocked and supplies were running low. Airports in Cancun,
Cozumel and Chetumal were opened only to aircraft with emergency
supplies, while commercial flights remained suspended.
   Campeche's governor declared the state a disaster area Thursday
and appealed for relief supplies.
   In Campeche, the state capital on the peninsula's west coast,
two babies drowned as residents of a poor, low-lying neighborhood
tried to flee, said Omar Cantu, editor of the Novedades de Campeche.
   Seven other people died, three by drowning and four when a wall
collapsed on them in the town of Dzidzantun north of Merida,
officials said.
   Red Cross worker Victor Rodriguez Santamaria said rescue efforts
were hampered by flooding, lack of power and gasoline.
   Tourism Secretary Enriquez Savignac said eight people were
killed in Cancun.
   Thousands of tourists in Yucatan resort areas were stranded.
Local officials said 11,000 tourists and residents were evacuated
from Cancun, and the Mexican navy began evacuating tourists from
the resort island of Cozumel.
   The government oil monopoly Pemex suspended foreign exports of
crude oil, secured tankers and capped wells on platforms along the
western gulf coast.

   President Reagan says there isn't ``an iota of
truth'' to an account that aides questioned whether he was mentally
fit to serve at the height of the Iran-Contra crisis. But a former
aide said today it would have been irresponsible for him not to
raise the issue.
   ``There's no truth to any of this,'' Reagan said Thursday when
asked about the report in a new book that aides weighed whether to
invoke the 25th Amendment, providing for the vice president to take
over if a president is unable to discharge his duties.
   ``It's just ridiculous,'' Reagan said while attending the annual
White House picnic for members of Congress. ``There isn't an iota
of truth in the whole story.''
   As to whether people were considering invoking the 25th
Amendment, the president said, ``I never knew that anyone was. I
don't think anyone was.''
   James Cannon, a former Senate aide to Howard H. Baker Jr. who
was on the transition team when Baker succeeded Donald T. Regan as
White House chief of staff, confirmed most of the account,
attributed to him, in the book ``Landslide'' by reporters Jane
Mayer of the Wall Street Journal and Doyle McManus of the Los
Angeles Times, published by Houghton Mifflin.
   Cannon, in an interview on ``CBS This Morning,'' defended his
decision to raise the issue of the president's mental state and the
possible use of the 25th Amendment to Baker after he had
interviewed several White House staff members as part of the
transition.
   ``I think it would have been irresponsible not to given what I
had been told by senior staff member who had been working with him
(Reagan,)'' Cannon said.
   Cannon said he interviewed White House aides on Feb. 27 and 28,
1987, just after Baker accepted the job, and ``a pattern of
responses evolved that the real problem you have to worry about is
the president. ... They would say he's not paying attention, he's
not reading his memos, he doesn't come to the office, he stays over
in the residence.''
   On March 1, the book says, Cannon wrote a memo to Baker
suggesting that his first priority be to ``consider the possibility
that section four of the 25th Amendment might be applied.''
   After Cannon presented and discussed the memo at a meeting at
Baker's home that night, Baker is quoted in the book as saying,
``Well, it doesn't sound like the Ronald Reagan I just saw, but
we'll see tomorrow.''
   Baker on Thursday said he does not recall ``any serious
consideration ever of invoking the 25th Amendment.''
   He called Reagan ``strong and assertive and perhaps the most
presidential man I ever knew'' and said Reagan was ``fully in
charge, fully capable, and fully presidential.''
   According to the book, Baker and his top aides were prepared,
when they assembled in the West Wing of the White House the morning
after Cannon raised the problem ``to watch the president closely,
to determine whether he appeared mentally fit to serve.''
   The account goes on to say that at a working lunch which Baker
and three aides attended, Reagan seemed relaxed and animated and
Cannon wondered, ``What the hell is going on here? The old fella
looks just dandy.''
   Cannon, in an interview with Cable News Network, said that of
the staffers he talked to ``not all but most said in one way or
another that the president was inattentive, that he had lost
interest in his job.''
   He later said on the CBS Evening News, ``My concern then and
today is that they were more loyal to Don Regan than they were to
Ronald Reagan.''
   Presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said the March 2
luncheon did occur, but ``Senator Baker and Culvahouse and others
don't describe any kind of situation the way Jim Cannon does.''
   ``What you have here is you have Cannon talking to a bunch of
people who for all practical purposes had just been relieved of
their duties. Effectively, every one knew when Regan left they were
all leaving. They all were gone within a week.''
   However, Tom Dawson, who was one of Regan's top aides when he
was chief of staff, said, ``Let's start thinking who those people
might have been. There were not very many of them. I can't even get
up to five. So Cannon has an arithmetic problem.''
   Regan, asked in Portland, Maine, about the book's assertion that
the president was out of touch, said: ``Well, I'm a little doubtful
of that. Of course the White House was in somewhat of disorder. He
was down because he had had an operation in early January, but I
think by that time he had fully recovered from it. ``
   In his book ``For The Record,'' published last spring, Regan
portrayed Reagan as disengaged and indecisive.
   Dawson said Cannon did not talk to him. Fitzwater said he did
not talk to him either. Fitzwater also said that Colin Powell, then
the deputy national security adviser, told him Cannon did not talk
either to him or to his superior, Frank C. Carlucci. Carlucci, who
was succeeded as national security adviser by Powell, is now
secretary of defense.
   Peter Wallison, former White House counsel, who was replaced by
Culvahouse after Baker became chief of staff, said he did talk to
Cannon, but ``he didn't ask me about the question of the
president's mental health, and I didn't tell him anything about the
president's mental health.''
   ``I never saw anything that suggested the president wasn't fully
in charge,'' Wallison said.

<HEAD>Gorbachev Calls for Improved Ties With China, Renews Summit Call</HEAD>
<HEAD>With PM-Gorbachev</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mikhail S. Gorbachev made another pitch today for
improving Soviet relations with China and renewed a call for a
Sino-Soviet summit.
   ``We stand for the full normalization of relations with the
People's Republic of China, for their development up to the level
adequate to our two countries' responsiblity for peaceful world
policy,'' Gorbachev said in a major speech in the Siberian city of
Krasnoyarsk.
   Gorbachev first proposed a summit with Chinese leader Deng
Xiaoping in a speech in the eastern Soviet city of Vladivostok,
near the Chinese border, on July 28, 1986.
   Chinese Communist Party General Secretary Zhao Ziyang said last
month the first Sino-Soviet summit since 1960 was possible if
Moscow first urged Vietnam to leave Cambodia.
   Since the Vladivostok speech, Gorbachev has taken several steps
to remove obstacles to improving ties with the Chinese.
   China has listed the impediments as the Soviet intervention in
Afghanistan, Moscow's support of Vietnam's occupation of Cambodia
and Soviet troops stationed along the Soviet border with China.
   The Kremlin has moved to clear some of the obstacles. In May, it
began withdrawing its troops from Afghanistan and has pulled some
of its forces out of Mongolia, which borders China.
   Gorbachev also has offered to accept China's request that the
two countries' border be fixed at the main navigation channel in
the Amur River.
   The Kremlin agreed to its first direct talks with the Chinese
focusing solely on the Cambodia issue. In five-day talks that began
Aug. 29 in Beijing, both sides said they found common ground but
achieved no breakthroughs in resolving the 10-year-old Cambodian
conflict.
   In his speech today, Gorbachev said the Beijing discussions on
Cambodia had ``contributed to improving Soviet-Chinese relations,''
according to the Tass news agency. He also called for direct talks
between China and Vietnam on the issue.
   Since the Vladivostok speech, Soviet and Chinese top envoys have
been meeting regularly to discuss normalization and border issues.
   The Kremlin's ties with Beijing have been strained since the
Communist giants split over ideological and strategic differences
in the early 1960s.
   Gorbachev said the people of the two countries are ready for a
rapprochement.
   ``There is ever more goodwill and trust in relations between the
Soviet and Chinese peoples,'' he said. ``Their profound interest in
one another has been resumed and is being filled with new content.
Mutual attraction is growing.''

<HEAD>Police Investigating Disfigured Doll Placed On Actor's Doorstep</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Police have questioned actress Sean Young,
who starred last year in ``No Way Out,'' about an incident in which
a disfigured doll was placed on actor James Woods' doorstep.
   Officers responded to a call from Woods on Aug. 16 when the doll
was discovered, West Los Angeles police Lt. Randy Mancini said
Thursday. The doll appeared to be a threat to Woods and his
fiancee, Sarah Owens, 25.
   Woods, 40, also reported receiving harassing phone calls and
letters, Mancini said.
   ``Sean Young was questioned, but that's all I'll say about her
part in the investigation,'' Mancini said. He wouldn't say when
police interviewed the actress or whether police have questioned
anyone else.
   No criminal complaints have been filed in the case, he said.
   ``One thing I really want to make clear,'' Mancini said, ``is
that Sean Young's participation in the investigation was completely
voluntary. She was completely cooperative.''
   An agent for Miss Young said it was policy not to speak with the
media about its clients.
   Andrea Jaffe, Woods' publicist, referred questions about the
matter to Woods' attorney, Alan Wertheimer, who did not return
telephone calls for comment.
   Ms. Young, 28, co-starred with Woods last year in the movie
``The Boost,'' which has yet to be released. She also appeared in
the 1987 Kevin Costner movie, ``No Way Out,'' playing the part of a
Washington mistress.
   Woods won an Emmy Award last year for his portrayal of the
mentally ill man in ``Promise,'' featuring James Garner. He also
earned a best-actor Academy Award nomination for his role as a
desperate journalist in 1986's ``Salvador.''

<HEAD>With PM-Hurricane Gilbert, Bjt</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press:</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Here, at a glance, are reports of damage caused by Hurricane
Gilbert since Saturday:
   MEXICO _ A total of 17 people killed in the Yucatan Peninsula.
Much of the peninsula without communications, electricity or
drinking water. Hundreds of thousands homeless on the peninsula and
in the Matamoros area in northern Mexico. Airports closed to
commercial airplanes, most roads blocked and supplies short in many
areas. Supplies for 70,000 evacuees collected along U.S.-Mexican
border, and thousands of others evacuated in the Yucatan Peninsula.
The Yucatan state governor estimated damage to the peninsula in the
millions of dollars.
   JAMAICA _ Government declares state of emergency for one month
in an area along eastern coast; more than 1 million people
affected. Dusk-to-dawn curfew imposed in that area and police
empowered to make businesses open quickly to avoid shortages of
staples.
   Damage estimated at $8 billion. Four-fifths of the nation's
homes damaged, with a fifth destroyed. Many roads flooded and
blocked. Electricity knocked out and water cut off in most regions;
communications extremely limited. At least 26 people killed and
estimated 500,000 left homeless.
   DOMINICAN REPUBLIC _ Flooding, widespread crop damage. Main
electricity relay station down, blacking out much of Santo Domingo,
the capital. Five dead, 100 families homeless.
   HAITI _ Military government declares a state of emergency across
the southern peninsula. Radio stations said 10 people drowned
Sunday. Floods seriously damaged banana and other fruit crops and
livestock and cut off roads. Winds toppled other structures and
utility poles.
   CAYMAN ISLANDS _ Widespread flooding. Hundreds of trees felled.
Estimated 5 to 10 percent of houses damaged. Electricity and
telephone service disrupted. Returning to normal.
   U.S. VIRGIN ISLANDS _ Many miles of utility poles toppled,
temporarily knocking out power to much of the islands. Some
flooding. Back to normal by Tuesday.
   BRITISH VIRGIN ISLANDS _ Flooding and power outages. Some
livestock and crop loss. Back to normal by Monday.
   PUERTO RICO _ Toppled utility poles and power outages in a dozen
small towns. Crop damage due to flooding estimated at $200,000 in
western agricultural region.
   ST. LUCIA _ Estimated $740,000 loss from damaged banana crop.
Similar losses reported by Guadeloupe, St. Vincent and Dominica.
Officials say banana plant, which is brittle and snaps off in high
winds, recovers quickly, so export losses should be temporary.

<HEAD>Noriega Motion Could Influence U.S. Election, Prosecutor Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A motion to dismiss drug-trafficking charges
against Panamanian ruler Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega has been
sealed at the request of a prosecutor, who says it could influence
the U.S. presidential election.
   But Miami attorney Neal Sonnett, Noriega's principal lawyer, on
Thursday denied Noriega was trying to plant a political bombshell,
saying the motion was routine and that prosecutors had an
``overactive imagination.''
   Sonnett's dismissal motion, filed Thursday, was ordered sealed
in advance by presiding U.S. District Court Judge William Hoeveler
at the request of prosecutor Richard Gregorie.
   ``My concern is that Noriega would see this as an opportunity to
put materials in there that could have some bearing on our election
and might use that as some sort of blackmail to cut himself a deal
with the U.S. government,'' Gregorie said Thursday.
   ``I want to be sure that ... this is not being used as some
political tool to attempt to coerce the administration into some
sort of deal,'' he said. ``It doesn't matter to me who's in power.
I'm a prosecutor, not a politician. I just don't want them to play
politics with it.''
   Sonnett has indicated in past hearings that he would argue that
the indictment should be dismissed because the U.S. government has
no legal right to indict the Panamanian leader, and because U.S.
courts have no jurisdiction to try him.
   A 12-count indictment returned by a federal grand jury in Miami
in February accused Noriega of accepting $4.6 million in bribes
from Colombia's violent Medellin drug cartel. A grand jury in Tampa
indicted Noriega the next day on three marijuana importation counts.
   The Reagan administration offered in May to drop criminal
charges against Noriega if he agreed to step down, but protracted
negotiations broke down without agreement.

<HEAD>Bakker: `I Don't Intend To Lose' PTL Suit Seeking $52 Million</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARY BROOKS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   PTL founder Jim Bakker says he doesn't
have the money to repay his former ministry's $52 million claim
against him and others, but he says that doesn't matter because he
plans to win the case.
   U.S. Bankruptcy Court Judge Rufus Reynolds halted the trial
Thursday and scheduled it to resume Oct. 17. Reynolds said that
during the interim he will read depositions from Bakker and others,
and defense attorneys will prepare to respond to evidence presented
by PTL.
   Attorneys for the Fort Mill-based ministry want Bakker, his
wife, Tammy, and former aide David Taggart to repay money they say
was lost through mismanagement of PTL accounts and grossly inflated
compensation.
   When asked outside the courthouse Thursday how he would pay if
he lost the suit, Bakker responded: ``You can't get blood from a
turnip. I don't intend to lose.''
   The trial, which is being held without a jury, began Monday.
   Bakker said in court Thursday that PTL attorneys and the IRS
were wrong about the amount of money he received.
   ``I see figures on there (charts presented by PTL attorneys)
that I can't recall at all, like in 1984, that $390,000 bonus, I
can't recall that at all,'' Bakker testified.
   ``Looking at the charts in this room and the figures, and those
in the IRS preliminary report, compared to our research, shows so
much error that proper auditing and examining must be done to
obtain the truth,'' he said.
   He said he believes some financial records were destroyed after
he left the ministry in March 1987 amid a sex and money scandal.
   Last week, Bakker had claimed he had the financing to regain
PTL, which Reynolds has ordered sold. PTL Trustee M.C. ``Red''
Benton had called Bakker the leading bidder with a $172 million
offer until Bakker could not prove he had the money.
   Testifying in the Bankruptcy Court trial this week, Bakker
contradicted testimony that the board of directors never approved
his salaries.
   He said his salary was set by the board, which also approved his
raises. But earlier, former board member Charles H. Cookman
testified that the board ``never ruled on salaries.''
   Peter Bailey, a former accountant and financial director at PTL,
testified that he routinely warned Bakker of the financial troubles
the ministry was having. He said top executives received bonuses in
some cases in anticipation of future donations, when there wasn't
money in the bank to cover the checks.
   But Bakker attorney Ryan Hovis told Reynolds that the continuing
financial crisis PTL experienced under Bakker's leadership was par
for the course.
   ``Every ministry of this type in the nation had the same type of
financial crisis,'' Hovis said. ``It goes with the territory.''

<TEXT>
   The government today mocked
three escaped detainees holed up in the U.S. Consulate, calling
them failed martyrs, and it pledged to leave them alone if they
left the building.
   But the Rev. Allan Boesak, a prominent anti-apartheid leader,
said the three have ``no faith whatsoever'' in the government's
pledge.
   The prominent anti-apartheid leaders escaped to the consulate
Tuesday after slipping away from police guards while undergoing
physiotherapy at a hospital. Each had been held at least 14 months
without trial.
   So far, they have spurned the government's offer to let them
leave the consulate without fear of being arrested again. They are
seeking assurances, possibly guaranteed by the United States, that
they will not be detained or restricted in any way if they leave.
   Foreign Minister Pik Botha, in a statement today, said he had
told U.S. Ambassador Edward Perkins that the South African
government ``was not interested'' in the activists.
   ``As far as I am concerned, they are merely guests of the
American consul-general at the expense of the American taxpayer,''
Botha said. ``They are deeply disappointed that they did not
succeed in becoming martyrs and the fact that they will have to
leave the U.S. consulate-general with their tails between their
legs, with all of South Africa laughing at them.''
   But Boesak, who met with the activists, said they did not
believe the government.
   ``The government is not to be trusted,'' said Boesek, president
of the World Alliance of Reformed Churches.
   Many activists, once freed from detention, have been placed
under restrictions limiting their freedom of movement and barring
them from political activities. The Foreign Affairs Department said
this would not happen in the case of the three escapees.
   ``There can be no intention to limit them in terms of talking to
the press or their political activity,'' a Botha spokesmen, Roland
Darroll, told The Associated Press.
   But Boesak said several activists, including Aubrey Mokoena,
head of the ``Release (Nelson) Mandela Campaign'' had been placed
under restrictions in the past 24 hours.
   ``How can we accept the word (of Minister of Law and Order
Adriaan Vlok) when he offers to let (three detainees) walk out of
here free while banning other people on the same day?'' Boesak said.
   The escapees are Murphy Morobe, acting publicity secretary of
the banned United Democratic Front; Mohammed Valli Moosa, the
front's acting general secretary; and Vusi Khanyile, chairman of
the banned National Education Crisis Committee.
   Morobe and Khanyile are black. Valli Moosa is Indian.
   The activists have not indicated when or if they will leave the
consulate, on the 11th floor of a Johannesburg office building.
They rejected proposals to be flown to another country.
   U.S. officials say the activists will not be forced to leave the
consulate, despite a worldwide U.S. policy of not formally granting
asylum in diplomatic offices. South Africa would need U.S.
permission to enter the premises.
   Under apartheid, South Africa's 26 million blacks have no vote
in national affairs. The 5 million whites control the economy and
maintain separate districts, schools and health services.

   The army ordered 180,000 Palestinian refugees
to stay in their homes in the occupied Gaza Strip today in
anticipation of a general strike called by Moslem fundamentalists
and PLO-linked underground leaders.
   In a pre-dawn firefight in south Lebanon, Israeli troops killed
three guerrillas without suffering casualties, the army said.
   Documents found on the bodies showed the guerrillas belonged to
Yasser Arafat's Fatah branch of the PLO, Israel radio said.
   In Gaza, the round-the-clock curfew was imposed indefinitely on
the Shati, Jabaliya, Nusseirat, Bureij, Maghazi and Khan Yunis
camps, the army and Arab reports said.
   It came after a violent clash at the camp Thursday night in
which 20 Palestinians attacked Israeli soldiers with firebombs,
iron chains and clubs, the army said. Troops opened fire, wounding
two Palestinians, the army said.
   Also today, peace crusader Abie Nathan was summoned before
police in the Tel Aviv suburb of Petah Tikva for an investigation
into his meeting with Palestine Liberation Organization chief
Yasser Arafat in Tunis, Tunisia, on Tuesday.
   Nathan faces up to three years in jail for breaking an Israeli
law banning contacts with terrorist groups. Israel views the PLO as
a terrorist group.
   Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin said today Nathan didn't
understand who he was dealing with when he met Arafat.
   ``Nathan is a decent and naive man, (but) the naive men don't
understand whom they are dealing with,'' Rabin said on Israel radio.
   Nathan, who returned to Israel Thursday, said he did not carry a
message from Arafat to Israeli leaders but would request a meeting
with Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir and Foreign Minister Shimon
Peres to brief them on his talks.
   Nathan presented Arafat with a peace plan calling for mutual
recognition between Israel and the PLO.
   After the interrogation, Nathan said it had gone ``very
smoothly.'' He said he argued he did not violate Israel's
anti-terrorist law since he met with Arafat to promote peace.
   ``I believe I achieved something. I tried to ... show the world
the desire for peace among the people over here,'' he said.
   Also today, the army said it created a special military command
unit to oversee operations in the West Bank.
   The unit is to be headed by Brig. Gen. Gabi Ofir, who vowed in
comments broadcast by Israel Army radio: ``We will not allow the
violence to become a disrupting factor.''
   The Gaza curfew was ordered to prevent violence during a general
strike ordered by underground leaders for Saturday to mark the
anniversary of the 1982 massacre of hundreds of Palestinian
refugees in the Sabra and Chatilla camps in Lebanon, army radio
said.
   In Gaza City, Islamic militants belonging to the underground
group Hamas, or Zeal, painted grafitti calling on merchants to
observe the strike, Arab witnesses said. Among the slogans was one
which read ``Death to the Jews'' in Hebrew and Arabic.
   Thursday was proclaimed a day of reckoning against collaborators
by pro-PLO underground leaders, who ordered Palestinians to kill
Arabs who collaborated with Israel.
   Five alleged collaborators have been slain over the past 11 days
and a total of seven have been killed since the uprising began Dec.
8.
   At least 266 Palestinians have been killed during the
nine-month-old uprising. Six Israelis also have died.

<HEAD>Bush Needled About Blooper on Pearl Harbor Date</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: INSERTS 3 new grafs after pvs 3rd graf bgng, ``But the big,''
with Bush slip of tongue on anti-Semitism today.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>CONCORD, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Vice President George Bush was teased and
supported about his blooper on the date of the bombing of Pearl
Harbor, and said politicians are fair game for attacks when they
screw up.
   Asked by a boy at Ygnacio Valley High School if he didn't want
to ``deck'' Democratic rival Michael Dukakis for teasing him about
his error, Bush said, ``We'll foul up and he'll jump on me and
he'll make some mistakes and I'll jump on him.
   ``But the big thing is to get the issues out there so the
American people can see them,'' Bush said.
   The vice president had another slip of the tongue today when he
said in Columbus, Ohio, that he favored anti-Semitism.
   Asked about the recent resignations of six members of his
campaign committee on ethnic voters because of past alleged
pro-Nazi or anti-Semitic ties, Bush replied: ``I hope I stand for
anti-bigotry, anti-Semitism, anti-racism. That is what drives me.
It's one of the things that I feel very strongly about.''
   Answering the California students' questions Thursday, Bush said
he expects to receive some flak for his misstatements on the
campaign trial, but is hardly bothered by it.
   ``Once in a while you do get sore, once in a while you might get
a little tense. But you know when you make a mistake like that, I
expect somebody to jump on me. Bob Hope did it. Didn't bother me.
Johnny Carson did it, and that didn't bother me,'' Bush said.
   The subject was first raised in a question-and-answer session at
the school by a girl who shouted ``When was Pearl Harbor?''
   Last week in Louisville, Ky., Bush mistakenly said the
anniversary was Sept. 7, not Dec. 7.
   Replying to the girl, Bush said, ``I'm glad you asked that
question. You ever made a mistake in your life, anybody here? I
know she hasn't.
   ``But has anyone here made a mistake, ever. Come on guys,'' Bush
said.
   ``Now let me tell you how that happens. It's a good question,
fair question. I tell you how it happens. You get a little tired
from time to time. I'm glad to be here in Connecticut,'' he joked.
   ``But, if you really want a serious answer to it, I remember
because I fought for my country in war,'' Bush said, recounting his
service as a naval bomber pilot in World War II and noting that he
was shot down in combat.
   ``So let there be no mistake about it,'' Bush said.``I remember
Pearl Harbor pretty well, firsthand, and I hope we'll never have
another one. ...''

   A baby whose mother
credited Premier Bill Vander Zalm with inspiring her not to have an
abortion has died from sudden infant death syndrome, authorities
said.
   The child's mother, Serina Hinde, had asked Vander Zalm to
become the boy's godfather because of his strong views against
abortion. The British Columbia leader agreed and attended the
baptism of the baby, Richard, at a Roman Catholic Church on Aug. 14.
   A coroner's report said Richard died Thursday of sudden infant
death syndrome. He was born on July 3, about six weeks premature.
   When she asked Vander Zalm to be godfather, Ms. Hinde, 26, said
she had seriously considered having an abortion when she found
herself pregnant with a child the father didn't want.
   ``I listened to what (Vander Zalm) had to say,'' she said.
   Earler this year, Vander Zalm tried unsuccessfully to have the
provincial government health insurance program stop paying for
abortions except when a woman's life was endangered by a pregnancy.

   Reagan also is slated to attend a rally at Baylor University in
Waco and appear at a private fundraising event for Beau Boulter,
the Republican congressman from Amarillo who is opposing Sen. Lloyd
Bentsen for his Senate seat, Fitzwater said.
   Even though Bentsen is running for vice president on the
Democratic ticket with Gov. Michael Dukakis, he is allowed under
Texas law to campaign at the same time for reelection to the Senate.
   On Friday, Reagan travels to Fort Lauderdale, Fla., to attend a

<TEXT>
   Solidarity leader Lech Walesa and a team
of union activists met with Interior Minister Czeslaw Kiszcak today
to set an agenda for talks on the future of the banned trade union.
   The meeting, which included at least 10 Solidarity members or
advisers, marked the first time since the union was banned in 1982
that so many union activists sat down with government officials.
   The third encounter between Walesa and the government began this
afternoon at an undisclosed location outside Warsaw, said Roman
Catholic Church attorney Jacek Ambroziak.
   ``After two meetings of our chairman alone, there is now a
serious delegation,'' said senior Solidarity adviser Bronislaw
Geremek.
   The expansion of the number of participants in the talks ``is a
serious step in the right direction,'' Geremek said. ``A Solidarity
delegation is talking to the authorities at last.''
   At least 23 people, including 11 officials led by Kiszczak and
two priests, were participating in the talks.
   Earlier Walesa said he was optimistic that broader talks with
the government on Solidarity would begin soon.
   The comment came after Walesa met for more than four hours
Thursday with Kiszcak, his second meeting with Polish authorities
in six years.
   The two agreed Thursday to continue working toward an early
start of talks on Poland's future with broader participation.
   They also agreed to expand the group of participants at today's
working meeting and to agree on the topics, composition, as well as
the procedure and work schedule of the later talks, the state-run
news service PAP said Thursday.
   Walesa told reporters after the meeting that ``the atmosphere is
encouraging'' but difficule problems remain.
   The government agreed to the talks and Walesa moved to halt a
wave of strikes last month that posed the most serious threat to
the government since Solidarity was crushed in 1981. It was
declared illegal a year later.
   Today's meeting was to include some leaders of Solidarity
strikes last month as well as at least five members of the official
trade union alliance OPZZ, said Franciszek Ciemny, an OPZZ
spokesman.
   In another development, an official newspaper published an
interview with Walesa for the first time since the imposition of
martial law in December 1981.
   The interview in the September issue of the monthly publication
Konfrontacje, which came out Thursday, seemed to underline Walesa's
return to official respectability and the new emphasis on
considering divergent views.
   The monthly, sponsored by the official national unity
organization PRON, interviewed the Solidarity leader at his home on
Sept. 1, the day a strike at the Gdansk shipyard led by Walesa
ended.
   ``You are the first Polish journalists from the officially
published press to come to me asking for an interview since Dec.
13, 1981,'' Walesa said, referring to the exact date of the martial
law crackdown that suppressed Solidarity, the first independent
trade union movement allowed in the Soviet bloc.
   ``There must be Solidarity,'' the interview quoted Walesa as
saying. But in it he added, ``It certainly does not have to be a
carbon copy of that of 1981.''

   A version of the Moscow Circus has begun its
tour of the United States with Cossack horseback riders, juggling
Siberian bears, Sumatran tigers, high-flying acrobats on stilts and
clowns who are graduates of the official Soviet Circus University.
   At least one act in the show which opened Thursday at Radio City
Music Hall needs to go back to school. Most of the children in the
hall were invited, Pied Piper-style, to come up on stage to witness
a juggler who shamelessly begged his audience for ``one more
chance'' to successfully complete his bungled trick.
   The show begins with the Chernievski acrobats who do flips on
tall stilts, starting out on a teeterboard and landing on a
table-size mat.
   Spectators who go to the Moscow Circus for the Russian bears
weren't disappointed by the Zolkin family and their 12 trained
animals ranging in age from 6 months to 11 years. At one high point
of the act some of the bears and trainers simultaneously juggle
balls with their paws and feet.
   Fans of trained animals also ooed and aahed while Nikolai
Pavlenko lackadaisically coaxed his 17 tigers through their paces,
without the help of a crackling whip.
   In a finale which is worth waiting for _ the circus runs on for
more than three hours _ Tamerlan Nugzarov and his riders sent 12
Caucasian horses galloping at full speed around the Radio City
stage.
   The collection of 11 acts from the more than 100 local
government-sponsored circuses throughout Russia is the first
traveling Moscow Circus to tour the United States in 10 years.
   The circus, which has already played Toronto and Worcester,
Mass., will also appear in Philadelphia, Washington, New Haven,
Conn.; Buffalo, N.Y., Cleveland, Detroit, Chicago, Denver, San
Diego, Los Angeles, Seattle and San Francisco.

<HEAD>Court Says EPA Need Not Recalculate Mileage Data</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES ROWLEY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal appeals court today struck down two
previous orders that had directed the Environmental Protection
Agency to recalculate automobile fuel economy ratings.
   The order by the full U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals here
relieves the EPA of any obligation to comply with the court's
previous orders to recalculate the fuel economy ratings according
to a method that could cost Ford Motor Co. and General Motors Corp.
millions of dollars in fines.
   The decision today, made in a brief order by the court's 11
members, reversed a 5-5 vote taken May 17 that had upheld a 1986
ruling by a three-judge panel that the fuel standards be
recalculated.
   In the previous vote, the court divided along bitter ideological
lines over whether the Center for Auto Safety and other petitioners
had standing to challenge the EPA's 1985 decision to relax the
fuel-economy standards.
   The EPA action had lowered penalties that Ford and GM would be
assessed for failing to meet fleet-wide fuel economy standards set
under the Environmental Policy and Conservation Act of 1975.
   The law requires manufacturers to be fined $5 for each tenth of
a mile a car model falls short of the miles-per-gallon standard set
by the EPA regulations. Manufacturers are given credits for models
that surpass the standards that can be carried over to subsequent
model years.
   The court said today that after considering the EPA's motion to
reconsider that decision, ``we have decided that our original
disposition was not an appropriate one.''
   ``We now hold that as a majority of the ... court was unable to
satisfy itself that the court had jurisdiction, the court should
not have taken any affirmative action on the merits, including
reinstatement of the panel opinion,'' the court said in an unsigned
order.
   In May, the court had said that it would uphold the 1986 ruling
but that that holding would not become a legal precedent because
the circuit judges could not agree on the issue of legal standing.

   The United States and Vietnam will begin joint
efforts to find the remains of American sericemen missing in
action, Defense Secretary Franc C. Carlucci said today.
   His announcent came at a National POW-MIA Recognition Day
ceremony on Capitol Hill, where House Minority Leader Robert Michel
urged the administration to ``press for an accounting of each and
every one'' of the 2,393 American troops still unaccounted for
following the Vietnam war.
   ``The Defense Department is committed to doing everything
possible to resolve the POW-MIA issue successfully,'' Carlucci told
a crowd of several hundred gathered on the Capitol steps.
   ``Today, we are encouraged in our quest, but we still await the
results that we know are possible from those who hold the
answers,'' he said. ``Although last month Vietnam temporarily
suspended its offer to conduct joint operations, it recently agreed
to resume cooperation, and I am pleased to announce that joint
activity will begin on Sept. 25.''
   Michel, R-Ill., and Senate Republican Leader Bob Dole of Kansas
pledged continued congressional support for efforts to uncover the
facts about 79,000 troops missing in action from World War II,
8,000 from the Korean War and those unaccounted for in Southeast
Asia.
   ``We must continue to seek the truth about our POW-MIAs,''
Michel said. ``But the two greatest enemies of truth are rumors and
false hopes.
   ``Nothing could be more cruel to the families of MIAs and POWs
than to lend credence to false rumors, to raise hopes without the
fact to support them, to muddy the waters and confuse the issue.
Nothing could be more detrimental to this cause than to let emotion
cloud our judgment.''
   Meanwhile, wreath laying ceremonies were scheduled today at the
Arlington National Cemetery in memory of POWs and MIAs from the
Korean War.
   An organization dedicated to remembering the families of missing
soldiers, No Greater Love, estimates that there are 8,100 MIAs and
389 POWs still unaccounted for in Korea.

<TEXT>
   Pope John Paul II today bluntly told
the 20-year-old polygamist king of this tiny mountain country that
God intended a husband to have only one wife.
   The pontiff, who arrived from Lesotho this morning, was escorted
by spear-carrying warriors and soldiers with machine guns into a
soccer stadium to celebrate Mass. He first was driven in the wrong
direction, then slipped off a platform, without injury.
   Then the Mass was interrupted by the arrival of King Mswati III
of Swaziland, who rolled into the stadium in a Lincoln limousine to
the whistles of the crowd. A turret manned by a soldier with rifle
and binoculars topped the altar, where a cross was stamped with a
spear, shield and war ax.
   Mswati acceeded to the throne two years ago. He has four wives
and is engaged to a fifth.
   ``Christians find that a monogamous marital union provides the
foundation upon which to build a stable family in accordance with
the original plan of God for marriage,'' the pope told a crowd of
about 10,000 people.
   ``Hence, any forms of disregard for the equal dignity of men and
women must be seen as serious contradiction of the truth that
Chirst, the king of peace, brought into the world.''
   Vatican sources said John Paul had been warned by local prelates
to tread carefully before addressing the issue.
   King Mswati, wearing red-and-white robes and with five bird
feathers decorating his head, listened expressionless to the pope's
admonission. At the end of the Mass, in an unscheduled breach of
protocol, the king formally thanked the pope for his visit. The two
met later at the royal palace.
   Earlier today, red-coated soldiers greeted John Paul at the
international airport of Manzini. When he arrived at the stadium,
the pope's open car mistakenly drove out the gate, to the dismay of
the spear-carrying warriors and Vatican security men.
   After returning to the stadium, the pope slipped off a platform
on the soggy field before climbing onto the altar. He was not
injured.
   On Thursday, in Maseru, Lesotho, John Paul told about 15,000
young people at a rally to ``renounce every form of violence and
hatred'' in southern Africa.
   Organizers expected 1 million people at the rally and blamed a
bloody bus hijacking, rainy winter weather and expensive
accommodations _ such as $25-dollar-a-night tents _ for the small
turnout.
   The pope visited the Queen Elizabeth II Hospital in Lesotho
Thursday to comfort 20 survivors of the hijacking, many still
shaken from the shootout that ended their 27-hour ordeal.
   ``I am saddened to learn that others on their way to join me on
this pilgrimage have been victims of a hijack that has caused such
anguish and ended in bloodshed,'' John Paul said Thursday, the day
after police stormed the bus in Lesotho with four hijackers and 71
hostages aboard, including nuns and schoolchildren.
   All four hijackers and two passengers, including a 14-year-old
girl, died in the exchange of gunfire Wednesday between authorities
and the hijackers, officials said. Twenty others were injured.
   The government said police stormed the bus after the hijackers
ordered the driver to crash the vehicle through the closed gate of
the British High Commission. The gunman called for a return to
civilian rule in Lesotho. They also demanded to meet the pope, King
Moshoeshoe II and the high commissioner.
   After his eight-hour visit to Swaziland today, John Paul was
scheduled to continue to war-torn Mozambique, the last stop on his
10-day tour of five southern African countries. The pope also went
to Zimbabwe, Botswana and made a brief unscheduled stop in South
Africa, where his plane was forced to land because of bad weather.
   Swaziland, a country of 700,000 people wedged between South
Africa and Mozambique, is a dual monarchy under the king, offically
known as ``the Lion,'' and a queen mother, named the ``the Great
She Elephant.''
   Polygamy is permissable, although most men have only one wife.
King Sobhuza II, the current king's father, had more than 50 wives
during his 60-year reign, which ended with his death in 1982.

<TEXT>
   Republican George Bush said today rival Michael Dukakis has
``been made over'' in an effort to win back Democratic voters who
twice put President Reagan in office. Dukakis was striking an
anti-crime note on the West Coast.
   Bush toured a steel plant in Columbus, Ohio, that was once
headed by his grandfather and sought steelworkers' votes by saying
he had more common ground with them than the Democrats.
   Dukakis was campaigning in Southern California, stressing the
fight against drugs and crime with an appearance at a police
academy. The Democratic nominee also was expected to announce plans
to expand the Drug Enforcement Administration, if elected.
   Bush said Dukakis was ``way over in left field'' on some issues
of concern to blue-collar workers. ``These people don't want gun
control. They do favor the death penalty,'' the vice president said.
   Bush referred to Dukakis' brief ride in an M-1 tank earlier this
week and said, ``You cannot fool the Soviet leadership by knocking
America's defense for 10 years and riding around in a tank for 10
minutes. ... You can't fool the American people.''
   The Republican nominee said Dukakis was modifying his positions
on defense to woo back the Reagan Democrats who could decide the
election.
   ``He's gone to states like this, found that his message of ...
cutting unilaterally on these weapons systems is not popular, Bush
said. ``He's coming out with policies quite different, but which
ones do you believe?''
   Running mate Dan Quayle also assailed Dukakis today, turning a
question on his own qualifications into an attack on the Democrat's
lack of foreign policy experience. ``I have 12 years of experience
in Congress. I understand national security measures, which is a
very important requirement,'' the Indiana senator said in Overland
Park, Kan.
   A day earlier, Bush selectively used economic statistics to
charge tha Dukakis had led Massachusetts into a ``budgetary Three
Mile Island.'' The Democratic nominee, initially reluctant to join
the rhetorical fray, defended his state's economy as sound.
   Questioned about Bush's charges, a reticent Dukakis told
reporters joining him on a tour of fire-ravaged Yellowstone
National Park that he would reserve comment until ``sometime next
week.''
   But later, the Democratic nominee chose to respond to the
attacks, and cited his state's low unemployment rate _ 3 percent _
and 10 straight balanced budgets.
   Upon arriving in Los Angeles, Dukakis again, without prompting,
told reporters, ``What Mr. Bush has given us is a mountain of debt,
record deficits, a record trade deficit and an economic future that
does not bode well for the American people.''
   Two days before the Summer Olympics, Bush told a business group
in San Francisco that Dukakis is the ``gold medal winner in the
tax-and-spend competition.''
   The Republican nominee added: ``Under my opponent, Massachusetts
has lost _ lost _ 26,000 jobs since 1983, more than any other state
in the country.''
   Federal figures show that Massachusetts has gained more than
230,000 jobs in the past five years, while losing manufacturing
jobs. The text of the vice president's speech said ``manufacturing
jobs,'' and Bush aides said the campaign stands by that description.
   Bush also said that as governor, Dukakis has tried to raise
taxes five times, including a $180 million jump in business taxes,
sales taxes and personal income taxes this past summer.
   There have been no broad-based tax increases in Dukakis' two
terms as governor beginning in 1983, while there have been numerous
tax cuts. But Bush said correctly that Dukakis pushed through a
major tax increase in 1975 during his first term. That hike was
repealed when taxpayers rebelled.
   ``The fact is the so-called Massachusetts miracle is really the
Massachusetts mirage. And right now that state is approaching a
fiscal fiasco that might best be described as a budgetary Three
Mile Island ... facing a budgetary meltdown,'' the vice president
said.
   In Los Angeles, Dukakis answered the charge, saying, ``Anybody
who'd compare my state's economy with Three Mile Island must be
suffering meltdown.''
   One debate the Democratic nominee refused to get involved in was
the argument over whether the forest fires that have decimated the
West should have been allowed to burn unchecked.
   ``This isn't the time to discuss what might have been or should
be,'' Dukakis said as he toured the park. ``Everbody agrees that
once the fires are out, it'll be a good time to sit down and think
through exactly how we deal with this problem in the future.''
   Bush, at a question-and-answer session with high school students
in Concord, Calif., was drawn into the question of a pardon for
Iran-Contra figure Oliver North.
   ``The question is for me _ pardon imputes guilt, and therefore I
have refused to speculate on this because I want to see this man
have a fair trial. I hope he's found innocent. ...
   ``In my description anybody that shed his blood in Vietnam with
two or three purple hearts is a hero for that,'' Bush said. ``Now
did he make some mistakes? Maybe so. But you're not going to see me
picking on Ollie North.''
   One high school girl teased Bush about his verbal faux pas last
week on the date of the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor _ the vice
president mistakenly said the anniversary was Sept. 7, ot Dec. 7.
   ``When was Pearl Harbor?'' she asked.
   Bush joked about being in Connecticut rather than California,
asked the girl if she ever made a mistake and then recalled his
service as a naval bomber pilot in World War II.
   ``I remember Pearl Harbor pretty well, firsthand, and I hope
we'll never have another one ...''

<HEAD>Liberace's Ex-Lover Reportedly Linked To Canyon Murders</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A man who claimed to be Liberace's lover gave
evidence leading to new murder charges in a 1981 quadruple slaying
for which pornographic film star John Holmes was acquitted, it was
reported today.
   Scott Thorson, who is awaiting sentencing for a drug-related
armed robbery, linked convicted cocaine dealer Adel Nasrallah to
the bludgeoning attack on five people at a hillside home in
exclusive Laurel Canyon, the Los Angeles Times reported. The story
cited unidentified sources familiar with the case.
   Nasrallah, 59, who goes by the name of Eddie Nash, and his
former bodyguard, Gregory Dewitt Diles, 40, were charged Sept. 8
with four counts of murder and one count of attempted murder in the
case.
   Neither have entered pleas to the charges and both are being
held without bail. If convicted, they could face the death penalty.
   Holmes, king of pornographic films in the 1970s, was
unsuccessfully prosecuted for the murders in 1982. He died of
AIDS-related complications in March at the age of 43.
   Thorson, 29, is being held under tight security at the county
jail while he awaits sentencing after pleading guilty to the armed
robbery.
   When the charges against Nash and Diles were filed, deputy
district attorney Dale A. Davidson said new witnesses had come
forward but declined to identify them or discuss the evidence.
   On Thursday, he refused to say whether Thorson will be called to
testify against Nash. Thorson's attorney in the robbery case,
deputy public defender Cathy Dreyfuss, also declined to comment.
   The Times quoted sources as saying that Thorson, who lived with
Liberace and served as the pianist's chauffeur, secretary and, by
his own account, his lover from 1977 until 1982, also maintained a
close relationship with Nash during much of that period.
   ``Eddie was Scott's cocaine connection,'' the newspaper quoted
one source as saying.
   According to testimony at Holmes' 1982 trial, the porn star once
told Los Angeles police that he had led killers to a home in Laurel
Canyon at the request of Nash, who prosecutors said wanted revenge
because he had been robbed two days earlier.
   Four people were bludgeoned to death. The fifth survived but was
unable to identify her attackers.
   Thorson filed a highly publicized lawsuit against Liberace in
1982, in which he contended that the entertainer, who never
acknowledged being a homosexual, had reneged on promises to support
him for the rest of his life. The suit was settled out of court
shortly before Liberace died of AIDS in 1987.

   Republican vice presidential candidate
Dan Quayle said today his experience in Congress and understand of
national security issues qualify him for high office, and that his
youth should not be any barrier.
   Addressing the suburban Overland Park Chamber of Commerce before
campaigning in Nebraska and Iowa, the Indiana senator also joked
that his campaign managers sometimes try to hide him from the
public when things go wrong.
   ``Sometimes they tell you to go to your room,'' Quayle said.
``And with some of the comments that I've made, I've been told that
several times. It's no fun sitting alone in your room.''
   Dealing with the issue of his fitness to serve as vice
president, Quayle said:
   ``I have 12 years of experience in Congress. I understand
national security measures, which is a very important requirement.
A lot has been made about my age and that 41 is too young. Jack
Kennedy was about my age when he ran for president.''
   John F. Kennedy was 43 when he beat Republican Vice President
Richard Nixon for the presidency in 1960.
   At Oklahoma City on Thursday, at his first news conference in
two weeks, Quayle said that the voters eventually ``will see the
real Dan Quayle, what he stands for,'' and make up their own minds.
   He dismissed as ``irrelevant'' questions about his past, such as
his college performance and why he did not make public his academic
records.
   Quayle has said he did not want reporters scrutinizing his less
than stellar grades.
   ``Winston Churchill was not a great student,'' Quayle said. ``He
was a great leader. FDR (Franklin D. Roosevelt) failed the bar
examination a number of times. He turned out to be a great
president.''
   According to biographies, Roosevelt entered Columbia University
Law School in 1904, a year after graduating from Harvard. He took
and passed the bar examination in 1907 and left Columbia that year
before receiving a degree.
   Referring to controversies over his military service during the
Vietnam War, his academic performance and his personal life, Quayle
said he was ``not going to focus on what I have done in the past''
but on ``what I stand for, what I articulate to the American
people.''
   ``The American people will judge me on what I am saying and what
I have done in the last 12 years in the Congress,'' he said.
   Quayle said he was not worried about a poll this week indicating
that a substantial portion of likely voters have reservations about
his credentials to serve in high office.
   A CBS-New York Times poll found that one-third of those
responding said Quayle was qualified to be president compared with
three-fifths who said the same of his Democratic counterpart, Sen.
Lloyd Bentsen of Texas.
   ``I think it's fair to say that in the last few weeks, the
American people have been told a different story about Dan Quayle
than what Dan Quayle has tried to communicate to the American
people,'' he said.
   Quayle was asked to explain his comment last week that Mikhail
S. Gorbachev was no different from other Soviet leaders and that
his perestroika policy of economic restructuring was ``nothing more
than refined Stalinism.''
   ``I have a hunch that restructuring in fact is to make sure that
Gorbachev gets his people into the political system and the people
who are not supporting him, out,'' Quayle said. ``That is classic
Stalinism. That's the way Stalin ran the country.''
   Quayle was asked how he would finance such costly proposals as
modernizing U.S. strategic nuclear missiles and President Reagan's
Star Wars plan for a space-based missile defense system at a time
of steep budget deficits.
   ``There will be some tough choices,'' Quayle replied.
   He said defense budget increases would have to be limited to 1
percent to 2 percent above inflation over the next two to five
years.

<HEAD>Brady Sworn In As Treasury Secretary</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nicholas F. Brady was sworn in today as the
nation's 68th treasury secretary, pledging that his agency will
``do its homework'' to support President Reagan's economic policies.
   After taking the oath of office from retired Supreme Court Chief
Justice Warren E. Burger, Brady told Reagan the administration's
economic policies have meant ``better lives for Americans.''
   Brady succeeds James A. Baker III, who left the Treasury
Department last month to become chairman of George Bush's
presidential campaign.
   ``I think of no one more qualified for this post,'' the
president told a group of people, including Brady's family,
assembled in the Roosevelt Room of the White House for the
swearing-in ceremony.
   ``In an investment banking career that has spanned three
decades, Nick Brady has earned the respect of the financial and
economic communities for his integrity and professional
accomplishments,'' Reagan said.
   ``As a member of the United States Senate,'' the president said,
``he won the respect and friendship of his colleagues.''
   He said that Brady had ``received national recognition for his
work'' investigating the events surrounding the Wall Street market
plunge last Oct. 19.
   ``Your leadership has produced the longest sustained period of
prosperity in most Americans' memories,'' Brady told Reagan. ``Not
only have the economic statistics turned out to be right, but what
is more important is that they have meant better lives for
Americans.''
   ``The Treasury Department will do its homework, do the pick and
shovel work to make sure the numbers are right, but we will always
be guided by your faith that character is at the root of all human
endeavor,'' he said.

<HEAD>GOP Congressmen Say Three Dukakis Backers Are Anti-Israeli</HEAD>

   A group of House Republicans charged today
that Democratic presidential nominee Michael Dukakis appointed
three ``anti-Israeli, pro-Palestinian'' members to the party's
ruling body and challenged him to dismiss them.
   The challenge was a clear effort to counter problems in the
campaign of GOP nominee George Bush, who has dumped eight campaign
advisers in the past week following charges of anti-Semitism
against them.
   Rep. Norman Lent, R-N.Y., said the three objectionable members
were appointed to the 400-member Democratic National Committee
following the party's July convention in Atlanta as a gesture of
conciliation to defeated presidential contender Jesse Jackson.
   He identified the three as the Rev. Willie Barrow, executive
director of Jackson's Chicago-based Operation PUSH; Robert Farrell,
a Los Angeles city councilman and close Jackson associate; and Ruth
Ann Skaff of Houston, whom he said is a spokeswoman for the
pro-Palestinian Ad Hoc Committtee on Lebanon.
   Lent said Barrow and Farrell are supporters of radical Muslim
leader Louis Farrakhan, who has made anti-Semitic statements. He
said Skaff has led anti-Israel demonstrations.
   ``The presence of (the three) on the Democratic team raises
questions about Michael Dukakis' judgment and his submission to
Jesse Jackson,'' Lent said at a news conference. ``Obviously,
Governor Dukakis has failed to grasp the message his appointments
send.''
   Lent said Bush had acted quickly to clean house when similar
allegations were raised about members of an ethnic coaliton
supporting his campaign and when it was reported that Bush adviser
Frederic V. Malek made a count of Jews in key jobs at the Bureau of
Labor Statistics in 1971.
   ``It's time for Michael Dukakis to show that he truly is in
charge,'' Lent said. ``He is the nominee of his party and should
have control over the party structure.''
   Appearing with Lent were Reps. Benjamin Gilman, R-N.Y., John
Miller, R-Wash., Guy Molinari, R-N.Y. and Vin Weber, R-Minn.
   Another Republican member of Congress, Sen. Rudy Boschwitz of
Minnesota, told reporters he had turned down a request from Bush
campaign aides take part in the attack.
   ``I don't want to do it,'' Boschwitz, a prominent Jewish
politican. ``I don't think there's any political future in these
charges and countercharges.''
   Two of the three DNC members under attack, Skaff and Farrell,
defended their stance on Israel. Barrow could not be reached
immediately for comment.
   ``Attacking individuals such as myself and Rev. Willie Barrow
and Councilman Farrell is a desperate and dangerous move by the
Bush campaign,'' said Skaff, the Texas coordinator for the Arab
American Institute.
   ``Targeting me as an Arab-American, and targeting my views on
this issue truly endangers the political security of Americans of
Arab heritage. Am I guilty of crime because my grandparents came
from Lebanon?'' she said.
   Skaff said she favors an independent Palestinian state, but only
``premised upon the security of Israel.'' And she said that she has
always condemned terrorism, but recognizes the Palestine Liberation
Organization because Palestinians have themselves chosen the group
as their representative.
   Farrell was criticized in 1985 when he refused to sign a
newspaper ad condemning anti-Semitic remarks attributed to Louis
Farrakhan, leader of the Nation of Islam.
   Farrell said Thursday he was unaware of the Farrakhan remarks at
the time and that he would gladly sign any letter opposing
anti-Semitic remarks.
   ``I'm very disappointed in someone in the Republican camp who
would take something as serious as relationships between blacks and
Jews and exacerbate them for political gain,'' he said.
   Barrow was quoted in a 1985 article in the Washington Post as
saying, ``I love my brother, Minister Louis Farrakhan. The devil
don't like it, Chicago don't like it, the world don't like it, but
we love it.''
   She said Thursday she was praising Farrakhan's role in
encouraging economic development in black communities at a meeting
held to discuss that development.
   She said she supports a Palestinian homeland, along with Israeli
security.
   Bush's campaign could not immediately be reached for comment.
   A spokeswoman for the Democratic National Committee, Robin
Diamond, said that body had no immediate comment.

   THE HAGUE, Netherlands _ Dutch soldiers who say their drill
sergeants beat or bullied them now can call a toll-free telephone
number to complain, the Defense Ministry said Friday.
   The 24-hour-a-day hot line is the government's latest move to
protect its 50,000 conscripts and 56,000 professional military,
whose rights already encompass labor unions, a 40-hour work week
and the right to adopt any hair style that doesn't interfere with
their duties.
   The line opened Thursday and is manned round the clock by a team
of social workers.
   ``We're definitely not looking for calls from people who say `I
want to go visit my granny this weekend but they won't let me,''' a
ministry spokesman said on condition of anonymity.
   He said the ministry will investigate complaints ranging from
violent behavior and sexual abuse to bullying by superiors and
other soldiers.

   A Hungarian court sentenced 10 people
to jail for smuggling Romanians and East Germans through Hungary to
the West, the official news agency MTI said Friday.
   It said the group charged up to $11,100 for taking Romanians out
of their country into Hungary, then driving them across Hungary and
smuggling them over the Austrian border.
   For a smaller fee, East Germans who traveled visa-free to
Czechoslovakia were smuggled into Hungary and then across to
Austria, MTI said.
   It said the ring was exposed after Hungarian border guards found
the escapees in trucks at the crossing to Austria.
   MTI said a West German identified only as Siegfried Schwanke
appealed his five-year sentence and had it reduced Thursday to four
years. He will be expelled when the term is served, it said.
   Four Hungarians were sentenced to 2{ years in jail, a fine and
loss of their driving licence for two years, and five unidentified
defendants have begun serving lighter jail terms, MTI said.

   The Nicaraguan Contras have accepted a
Sandinista offer to hold preliminary talks in Guatemala City on
Monday to end the conflict in the Central American country and have
set up meetings today with U.S. Congressional leaders.
   ``We hope we can achieve a breakthrough and create momentum,''
Bosco Matamoros, a spokesman for the Contra rebels who oppose
Nicaragua's Marxist government, said Thursday.
   He said the resistance had urged the Sandinistas to then proceed
to high-level talks Sept. 26-28 in Guatemala, Costa Rica or the
Dominican Republic.
   But Matamoros said the Nicaraguan government would have to free
all remaining political prisoners and permit ``freedom of
expression'' for negotiations to succeed.
   It was not clear whether this amounted to the Contras setting
conditions and whether they would be acceptable to the Sandinistas.
   In the meantime, Contra leaders planned separate meetings on
Capitol Hill with Speaker Jim Wight, D-Texas, and House Republican
Leader Bob Michael of Illinois.
   ``We are concerned there be an adequate climate, and we ask the
government of Nicaragua to remove these obstacles,'' Matamoros said.
   He said Victor Tinoco, Nicaragua's vice minister of foreign
affairs, had been notified in Managua of the Contras' acceptance of
the preliminary meeting.
   At the same time, Matamoros stressed it was up to the
Sandinistas ``to create a favorable climate for a round of
negotiations at the high level'' to work out a peaceful settlement.
   Negotiations between the two sides broke down in Managua in June
after 11 weeks in a dispute over whether the steps demanded by the
Contras were part of a Central American peace plan.
   The Sandinistas say the negotiations collapsed because of
last-minute Contra demands over what were essentially domestic
political issues.
   Secretary of State George P. Shultz met Wednesday with
resistance leaders. Matamoros and a U.S. official said the decision
to accept the Sandinista offer for a preliminary meeting was made
independently by the resistance group.
   Asked if the preliminary talks would lead to high-level
negotiations and a settlement, the official said, ``It depends on
the Sandinistas'' and whether they were willing to release arrested
demonstrators and lift restrictions on La Prensa and a Roman
Catholic radio station.
   The Reagan administration repeatedly has called on Nicaragua for
political reforms while urging Congress to finance arms and other
support for the Contras who are fighting to bring down the leftist
government.

   Democrat Michael Dukakis, saying the Reagan
administation has short-changed the war on drugs, promised today he
would double the number of federal drug agents and hire more
federal prosecutors.
   ``We are going to give state and local law enforcement officers
the money to fight the war,'' Dukakis said in remarks prepared for
delivery at the Los Angeles Police Academy.
   ``We're not going to try to nickel and dime you to death, as
this administation has done,'' he said.
   Dukakis said that as president he would double the number of
federal Drug Enforcement Administation officials over five years.
   Aides to Dukakis said he was prepared to spend $50 million to
hire 600 new agents next year toward the goal of 2,800 new agents.
   He said he would put 100 of those new agents in southern
California, where he was campaigning today.
   The Dukakis campaign said the candidate was committed to hiring
800 more federal prosecutors to help handle drug cases and other
crimes.
   Dukakis ridiculed remarks by Vice President George Bush two days
ago in San Francisco, quoting Bush as saying he is ``almost
haunted'' by severe drug problems in inner cities.
   Dukakis said, ``American children do not need our pity. They
need strong leaders and first rate law enforcement officers ...
They don't need a change of heart in Washington. They need a change
of leadership.''
   On Thursday, Dukakis traveled to the charred forests of
Yellowstone National Park to show support for firefighters.
   Standing across a river gorge from a blackened hillside, Dukakis
refused to be drawn into the debate in the West over whether the
Reagan administration should have acted sooner. Following National
Park Service policy, the government allowed those fires that were
ignited naturally to burn themselves out until late July.
   ``This isn't the time to discuss what might have been or should
be,'' Dukakis said. ``Everybody agrees that once the fires are out,
it'll be a good time to sit down and think through exactly how we
deal with this problem in the future.''
   The Democratic nominee, putting aside his newly aggressive
demeanor for a moment, sounded nearly as cautious when asked about
Bush's assault on his economic record as governor of Massachusetts
_ an area Dukakis made the centerpiece of his candidacy.
   ``I'll be responding to that sometime next week,'' Dukakis said
at first. ``... Good luck to Mr. Bush.''
   Bush, the Republican nominee, said Dukakis' state led in
spending increases and was second in tax increases under his
administrations and called him ``the gold medal winner in he
tax-and-spend competition.''
   Several minutes later, appearing to reconsider the notion of
allowing Bush's charges to go unanswered, Dukakis delivered a
response without prompting. Arriving in Los Angeles later, he again
volunteered a reaction.
   ``We've balanced 10 budgets in a row, we have a 3 percent
unemployment rate, we have more jobs than people to fill them,
personal income is rising at the second fastest rate in the nation,
and we've cut taxes five times in the last five yearrs,'' he said.
   ``What Mr. Bush has given us is a mountain of debt, record
deficits, and record trade deficts, and an economic future which
does not bode well for the American people.''
   The issue of when to battle forest fires has produced divisions
in the Rocky Mountain states and poses political pitfalls. Interior
Secretary Donald Hodel has suggested the policy may be changed. But
the policy of letting fires burn themselves out unless they
threaten lives or structures has won support from some
environmentalists, who argue that fire is a natural process that
makes way for new growth.
   Dukakis said he wanted to hear more about the issue, but he
recognized that argument.
   Dukakis has campaigned in the Rocky Mountain states and, at the
height of his midsummer popularity, aides were speaking hopefully
of the nominee's chances in those states _ especially Montana. But
as the race has tightened everywhere, the Rocky Mountain states _
which have been reliably Republican in presidential races even
though they elect Democratic state officials _ are looking
increasingly difficult for Dukakis.

<HEAD>Greenhouse Effect May Worsen Hurricanes</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hurricanes of the future may be even more
powerful than any that have come before, as a result of the
so-called greenhouse effect warming of the Earth, a scientist is
warning.
   Kerry A. Emanuel, of the meteorology department at Massachusetts
Institute of Technology, expressed his concern even as Hurricane
Gilbert, perhaps the most powerful tropical storm of the century,
was churning a path of destruction through the Gulf of Mexico.
   Because hurricanes gain their energy from the warm ocean waters
in tropical areas, rising temperatures could increase the strength
of these storms in the future, he explained in a telephone
interview.
   ``Over the warmest parts of the oceans, a change in sea-surface
temperature of 1 degree Celsius (1.6 degrees Fahrenheit) will
change the minimum sustainable pressure in a hurricane by 15 to
20'' millibars, Emanuel reported.
   The pressure in the center of a hurricane is generally
considered a good indication of its strength, with lower pressures
indicating a more powerful storm. Normal sea level pressure is
1,013 millibars, while in a powerful storms like Gilbert readings
can drop into the high 800s.
   Emanuel commented, however, that it's too soon to tell whether
Hurricane Gilbert is a product of the greenhouse warming.
   ``This is kind of an extraordinary hurricane, but I don't think
we can take it as an indication we are seeing any kind of trend,''
he said. ``If the predictions of some climate models come true, and
that's a pretty big if, we can expect to see some more intense
hurricanes in 50 years or so.''
   That means the strong storms of the future would be more
powerful than the strong ones of today, he explained, although
there wouldn't necessarily be more storms.
   There generally seems to be a limit to how low the pressure can
fall in even the strongest storms, explained Emanuel, but warmer
ocean waters could lower that limit. And that, he said, is what
could result in the stronger storms.
   The greenhouse effect has been widely reported in recent years.
Climate experts explain it as the result of increasing carbon
dioxide and other polluting gases in the atmosphere.
   Those gases allow the incoming sunlight to continue to warm the
Earth, but block some outgoing radiation, leading to a gradual
increase in the planet's temperature. It is a situation similar to
that of a greenhouse where heat from the sun is captured to warm
plants.
   Studies by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration
concluded that carbon dioxide in the atmosphere has increased by 25
percent since the mid-1800s and continues to grow. Scientists have
estimated that the overall temperature of the Earth has risen by
more than 1 degree Fahrenheit over the same time, and could rise by
another 2 degrees over the next few decades.
   Computerized models, using complex mathematical formulas to
predict the result of such a warming, have warned of a variety of
dire consequences ranging from drought over croplands to melting of
the polar ice caps, raising sea levels and inundating coastal
communities.
   Emanuel is the author of a study, ``Toward a General Theory of
Hurricanes,'' which appears in the July-August edition of American
Scientist.
   In it he noted that while many things about the giant tropical
storms remain a mystery, in recent years scientists have come to a
better understanding of the storms.
   The power for hurricanes, he explained, comes from the transfer
of moisture and energy from the oceans into the overlying air. This
air rises, forming a low pressure area, and wind from surrounding
area begins blowing in a spiral toward that center, bringing in
more moisture from the warm ocean.
   Since the rate of evaporation increases with wind speed, the
faster the wind the more water and energy it can pick up in the
storm.
   The inward-flowing air cannot get to the actual center of the
storm because the laws of physics would cause it to increase its
spin to an infinite velocity, Emanuel explains. Thus, at some
point, the wind stops moving inward and begins to ascend, forming
the well-known cloudy eye-wall of a hurricane.
   Because ocean heat drives these big storms, scientists have
found that among the conditions necessary before a hurricane can
form is an ocean temperature of 26 degrees Celsius _ about 82
degrees Fahrenheit _ and that warm water needs to extend down about
60 meters, or 165 feet.
   In addition, the storms will not form if there are strong cross
winds, which disrupt the rising motion that helps form the center
of the storms.

   Republican George Bush said today that
Democratic rival Michael Dukakis is a campaign convert on defense
issues who is trying to fool American voters _ and Soviet leaders _
by ``riding around in a tank for 10 minutes.''
   Bush said photographs of Dukakis wearing a military helmet and
riding in an M-1 tank at a defense contractor's plant in Michigan
earlier this week were at odds with his record on national defense.
   ``All I can do is cite his position,'' Bush said, declaring that
Dukakis has opposed the railroad-based MX missile, the Midgetman
missile and the B-1 bomber.
   ``Now suddenly he rides around in a tank, jumps out of the tank,
takes off the helmet and comes on with different positions,'' the
GOP nominee said as he toured the Buckeye Steel Co. plant in
Columbus under the silent gaze of steelworkers, some wearing
Dukakis T-shirts.
   Dukakis opposes the MX and Midgetman missile programs and
initially expressed opposition to the B-1 bomber, although he said
later that production of the aircraft should be allowed to proceed.
   Bush said he was encouraged by the reception he received from
the steelworkers at the plant where his grandfather, Samuel
Prescott Bush, was once president. About 150 employees stood
quietly throughout the speech, neither jeering nor applauding.
   ``Admittedly, the applause meter didn't go off the chart,'' Bush
said, ``nor did the boo meter go off the chart. These days we
measure things by both meters.''
   Bush said Dukakis was ``way over in left field'' on some issues
of concern to blue-collar workers. ``These people don't want gun
control. They do favor the death penalty,'' the vice president said.
   In Findlay, Ohio, a city that calls itself ``Flag City U.S.A.,''
Bush declared that ``the flag is back'' and then seemed to stumble
into the Pledge of Allegiance.
   At a flag-draped rally, Bush said, ``What is it all about? It's
the symbol of these United States of America, and to the liberty
for which it stands, one nation under God with freedom and justice
for all. And let's never forget it.''
   Bush told reporters in Columbus that Dukakis is tailoring his
message in an effort gain the support of Democrats voters who
previously had voted for President Reagan.
   ``He's gone to states like this, found that his message of ...
cutting unilaterally on these weapons systems is not popular, and
so now he's been made over,'' Bush said. ``He's coming out with
policies quite different, but which ones do you believe? You
believe this 30-day conversion as you climb out of a tank?''
   The vice president added:
   ``The tanks did not fit. It's time to take another message to
Michael. It's very straightforward. You cannot fool the Soviet
leadership by knocking America's defense for 10 years and riding
around in a tank for 10 minutes. ... You can't fool the American
people.''
   Bush also made an apparent misstatement, saying he stands for
anti-Semitism, when asked about the resignation of six pro-Bush
campaign aides on ethnic groups who allegedly had pro-Nazi or
anti-Semitic ties. He said the aides left voluntarily to avoid
diverting attention from campaign issues.
   ``I hope I stand for anti-bigotry, anti-Semitism, anti-racism,''
Bush said. ``That is what drives me. It's one of the things that I
feel very strongly about.''
   The GOP nominee said in California on Thursday that he hoped
former White House aide Oliver North would be exonerated of all
charges stemming from his role in the Iran-Contra affair.
   But Bush refused to rule out a presidential pardon if North is
found guilty. And today, he ducked a question whether he would
offer North a job in any Bush administration.
   Bush stopped in Columbus on his return to Washington after a
two-day campaign swing through California highlighted by a
statistical assault on Dukakis as an Olympic-class
``tax-and-spend'' governor of Massachusetts.
   Trying to project a disastrous U.S. economy under a Dukakis
administration, Bush said the Massachusetts governor had presided
over a state that lost 26,000 jobs since 1983. The text of the
speech said ``manufacturing jobs,'' but Bush skipped over the word.
   Press Secretary Sheila Tate said the omission was inadvertent.
   Official figures also show that under Dukakis, the state's job
market as a whole has seen a five-year increase of 230,000 jobs to
more than offset the loss of manufacturing jobs.
   On another point, Bush said Massachusetts in the last two years
``has turned a surplus into a growing budget deficit that according
to Massachussetts legislators appears to be approaching $500 to
$700 million for fiscal 1989.''
   In fact, the state has no deficit now, and Tate said the vice
president was only referring to the future projected deficit.
   Massachusetts in fiscal 1988 had a $67 million surplus after
cutting $450 million in spending and dipping into some reserve
accounts. Critics questioned the surplus and said it could only be
the result of tax and fee increases, government borrowing and a
``raid'' on the state pension fund.
   Bush also noted that Dukakis has borrowed about $200 million a
month since June for operations, and Bush called it ``last-ditch
borrowing.''
   But Dukakis says the short-term loans are needed to cover
municipal aid that is now dispensed in a lump sum annually instead
of in periodic installments as was the case before 1986, and that
helps the local municipalities avoid heavy borrowing while waiting
for state aid.
   On taxes, Bush listed Massachusetts as second in the nation in
growth in per capita taxes since 1963.
   That means taxes are higher per person than in any state but
Connecticut. But it is not due to a tax hike by Dukakis, Bush
economics adviser Michael Boskin acknowledged.
   In fact there have been no broad-based tax increases in Dukakis'
two terms that began in 1983.
   Tax revenues went way up due to growth in income and other
economic factors, Boskin said, adding that the Bush criticism is
that Dukakis let the taxes rise without instituting any relief for
taxpayers.
   ``He's allowed them to rise without returning them,'' to
taxpayers or seeking tax limitation measures as other states have
done, said Boskin.
   There have been numerous tax cuts during Dukakis' last two terms.

   The ceremony for the Tortuga, an LSD-class dock landing ship, is
set to begin at 10 a.m. EDT Saturday at the Avondale Industries'

scheduled to deliver the principal speech.
   The Navy said Friday the ceremony might be canceled at the last

The hurricane was in the Gulf of Mexico and closing on Texas Friday
afternoon.
   The Tortuga is 609 feet long, 84 feet wide and displaces about
15,726 tons when fully loaded. It is capable of carrying four
air-cushion landing craft in its well deck and has a flight deck
for helicopter operations.
   The vessel is the second U.S. Navy ship to be named after a
group of coral islets located off the coast of Key West, Fla.

<DATELINE>YELLOWSTONE NATIONAL PARK, Wyo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Firefighters battling
wildfires contended with higher winds today and looked forward to
an approaching Canadian cold front expected to bring showers and
cooler temperatures to burning woodlands this weekend.
   On Thursday, presidential candidate Michael Dukakis gave crews
at fire-blackened Yellowstone National Park a pep talk and
expressed awe at nature's devastation.
   ``I can't remember a year in my lifetime when the weather seemed
to be more important to us in many ways,'' the 55-year-old Democrat
said during his tour of the park.
   ``The drought, the heat, and now a massive hurricane bearing
down on us are reminding us not only of our mortality but of the
importance of pulling together and caring for each other,'' the
Massachusetts governor said.
   Blazes burned today in Wyoming, Montana, Idaho, Oregon and
Washington state as the worst fire season in 30 years continued.
More than 4 million acres, including 2.1 million acres in Alaska,
have gone up in smoke.
   The 8,400 soldiers and civilian firefighters in drought-parched
Yellowstone got a break this week from cooler, calmer weather, but
Park Superintendent Bob Barbee said, ``We're not out of the woods
yet.''
   Firefighters continued to beef up protection of areas that could
be threatened if conditions worsened. Efforts Thursday focused on
Lake Village, which could be threatened by a 335,000-acre fire,
said fire information officer Bob Valen.
   Winds kicked up today and were expected to hit 20 to 35 mph, but
the forecast contained some good news: a Canadian cold front
bearing cool, rainy weather was expected to reach Yellowstone by
Sunday.
   The wind will ``definitely make increased fire activity, but we
don't anticipate any runs like we had last weekend,'' said park
spokeswoman Linda Miller.
   Dukakis toured Yellowstone with the Democratic governors of
Wyoming, Montana, Colorado and Idaho.
   ``I know I speak for every single American citizen when I tell
you we are grateful to you and I know you have been taking on what
is a massive undertaking,'' Dukakis told firefighters, adding he
was ``awestruck by what's happened here.''
   The fires, which now form one huge blaze, have affected 1.1
million acres of the 2.2 million-acre park. But according to new
infrared scans, they have burned only about 50 to 60 percent of the
land within fire perimeters.
   Dukakis refused to be drawn into the debate over whether the
Reagan administration should have acted sooner. Following National
Park Service policy, the government allowed naturally ignited fires
to burn until July.
   The other governors agreed that the Park Service should have
attacked the fires sooner because of this year's dry conditions,
said Colorado Gov. Roy Romer.
   Interior Secretary Donald Hodel has said the ``let-burn'' policy
may be changed.
   In west-central Montana today, a battalion of 540 soldiers from
Washington state were on fire lines, relieving weary firefighters
mopping up the smoldering 247,000-acre Canyon Creek fire.
   ``It looks real good. The forecast is for additional
precipitation. In fact, it's showering here right now,'' fire
information officer Jack Kendley said today.
   In Glacier National Park near the Canadian border, winds and
temperatures in the 80s kept nearly 1,000 firefighters busy.
Officials expected the fire to continue spreading east today as
shifting winds gust to 25 mph, said fire information officer Jim
Payne.
   ``We've got a sleeping giant that's tied down pretty well,
except he's trying to wiggle free on the northeast side,'' Payne
said today. The fire grew by about 2,000 acres overnight to 34,500
acres.
   The approaching Canadian cold front may bring rain to the area
this weekend, or even snow at higher elevations, forecasters said.
``We're all hoping for snow tomorrow, every one of us,'' said
spokeswoman Stephanie Gibert.
   In Idaho, about 300,000 acres of forest fires continued to burn.
   In Washington, officials said land in the eastern section of the
state would be reopened to the public this weekend due to gains
made against wildfires. A ban on hunting and fishing was to be
lifted at midnight tonight, and statewide bans on logging were
relaxed.
   In Oregon, 14 more fire crews were ordered into the struggle
against a blaze in Willamette National Forest, boosting the force
to more than 1,600 firefighters and support crews. Hot, windy
weather was predicted this weekend.
   Infrared aerial photographs taken Thursday night put the fire at
7,232 acres, an increase of 882 acres over the previous night.
   ``The main objective is to hit the fire hard the next two to
three days, before the east winds move in,'' Forest Service
spokeswoman Lorette Laferriere said. ``We expect more dry weather
and east winds along about Sunday or Monday.''

   The first USO club is moving due to fewer
customers and a less than ``wholesome environment'' for the
military, officials said.
   The Bob Hope USO club, which opened in 1940 and became a spot
where soldiers rubbed elbows with stars, is moving to Long Beach in
December, with a satellite club in Barstow.
   ``That's where the military is,'' Anne Milkes, the
organization's executive director, said Thursday ``We decided to
take Mohammed to the mountain.''
   The Hollywood USO club was a model for the chain of USO clubs
chartered by Congress in 1941 to serve the military overseas.
   At its height, the Hollywood center attracted up to 25,000
servicemen a year, Ms. Milkes said.
   But now most service people in the area are unwilling to make
the trek to Hollywood, where the USO shares a street with a club
featuring nude dancers.
   ``We wanted to provide a wholesome environment for young people
and Hollywood had a lot of problems,'' Ms. Milkes said.
   Its two new locations are accessible to 60,000 military
personnel, she said.
   Not everyone in Long Beach is pleased with the move.
   ``It's going to kill the rest of the businesses downtown,''
complained Marcia Lamb, co-owner of Overreact Gallery, an art
gallery across the street from the new USO site. ``We're trying to
develop a community feeling and a reputation for a certain
consistent type of nighttime entertainment.''
   But Ms. Milkes said such fears are based on outdated perceptions.
   ``Those who object are carrying around an image of drunken
sailors from the past,'' she said.

   Seven gravestones were overturned and vandals tried to dig into
the grave of Isaac McBride, who received a federal land grant near

   The death of a 16-year-old boy who was
trading punches with a friend has been declared an accident,
authorities said.
   An investigation by the Lane County medical examiner's office
determined that Joseph A. Kight of Creswell died from an injury
after he was struck in the upper abdomen by a teen-age friend.
Police are not releasing the name of the friend because he is a
juvenile.
   Police said the boys were trading punches in a friendly manner
on Aug. 9 when Kight collapsed.
   A blow may have struck nerves and caused a ``lethal'' arrhythmia
of the heart, said medical examiner Dr. Samuel Vickers. He said it
is also possible a blow was struck during a critical time of the
heart's rhythmic cycle.
   Lab samples uncovered no evidence of drugs in the boy's system
and he had no other injuries, officials said.

<TEXT>
   A tax-reform group said it will appeal
a court ruling that overturned Proposition 62, the 1986 initiative
that requires local governments to seek voter approval for local
taxes.
   Proposition 62, a fine-tuning of the landmark tax-capping
Proposition 13 that was championed by the late tax reformer Howard
Jarvis, was overturned Thursday by the state's 4th District Court
of Appeal.
   The unanimous decision said requiring voter approval constitutes
a ``gross interference with the fiscal responsiblity of local
governments.''
   ``It's a sad day for the California taxpayer,'' said Joel Fox, a
spokesman for the California Tax Reduction Movement in Los Angeles.
The anti-tax group campaigned for Proposition 62 after Jarvis died
in 1986.
   Fox said his organization would appeal the ruling to the state
Supreme Court. If the high court refuses to hear the case, Fox said
his group would consider another initiative campaign.
   The appellate court reversed a decision in January by a Superior
Court judge, who upheld Proposition 62 against a challenge brought
by the city of Westminster.
   The appellate court ruling said Westminster has authority to
impose a tax on utility users without a citywide vote.
   A similar case is before the state's 1st District Court of
Appeal in San Francisco.

   Entertainer and author Art Linkletter says
he loves to interview children and women over the age of 70.
   ``Children don't know what they're saying and old women don't

   Linkletter, 76, said children survive depressions, sorrows,
successes, joys and failures for which ``we've earned an honorary
doctorate of life.'' But he said some experience a loss of identity
and self-esteem when they grow old.
   If that's the case, those people have to create something to

   While Bernard Russell followed the destructive path
of Hurricane Gilbert this week, he recalled the 1935 hurricane that
claimed 50 relatives when it blasted the Florida Keys with 200 mph
wind and a 15-foot wall of water.
   ``I've been following this thing and I know the 1935 hurricane
was tougher _ no maybe about that,'' said Russell, who lost his
mother, three sisters, grandparents, aunts, uncles, nephews and
cousins in the Labor Day hurricane, one of only two Category 5
hurricanes to make U.S. landfall since record-keeping began.
   ``When I see the pictures from Jamaica, you can see tall coconut
palm trees still standing. There wasn't one left on my island _
only stumps,'' Russell, 69, said by telephone Thursday from his
daughter's home in Frostproof, Fla.
   Gilbert was a Category 4 storm when it devastated Jamaica this
week, then strengthened to Category 5, which signifies sustained
wind speed greater than 155 mph and interior barometric pressure
less than 27.17 inches and other factors.
   After crossing Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula, Gilbert had declined
to Category 3 on its way to landfall near the Texas-Mexican border
Friday. It had killed more than 50 people.
   Russell, then 17, was in the center of the 1935 hurricane's
14-mile-wide swath that destroyed a railroad, peeled the Matecumbe
Keys down to bare rock and killed 600, 408 in the Keys. The retired
carpenter still lives at Islamorada in Upper Matecumbe.
   Bob Sheets, director of the National Hurricane Center, said
Gilbert at its peak was bigger in size and stronger in barometric
pressure than the one that struck Sept. 2, 1935, although the
earlier one was more powerful when it struck land.
   The other Category 5 hurricane to make U.S. landfall was
Camille, which killed 256 in the Mississippi coastal area in 1969.
   In an interview at the time of the 50-year anniversary of the
Keys hurricane, Russell relived the giant storm that was forecast
to move into the Florida Straits between Key West and Cuba. But
after a morning of sunshine, winds became ferocious and heavy rain
fell.
   What was known then as the U.S. Weather Bureau was unaware the
hurricane had changed course.
   ``At 8 p.m., it got so black you couldn't see your hand in front
of your face,'' Russell said. He and his family sought refuge in a
nearby building.
   ``The building began to shake and muddy water came in under the
door. My father said we'd have to leave the building. He told us to
grab hold of each other and try to hang together.
   ``We opened the back door and became separated. I was holding
onto my sisters and nephews, but we were pulled apart,'' he said.
   Russell grabbed the door frame as the building toppled.
   ``There was debris everywhere. It was a boiling pot. The water
rose quickly and my leg got caught. I stretched my neck and cupped
my hands over my mouth as the water got higher.
   ``I heard a voice in the distance and I kept yelling at the
person to keep yelling. Later, I worked down the pile of trash and
my face pushed into something. It was my father; the voice I heard
in the distance, he had been only an arm's length away.''
   ``One of my cousins was found 40 miles from here,'' recalled
Russell. ``She was still holding her baby in her arms.''

   Charles C. Haslet, 85, a regional reporter for
The Associated Press in Washington from 1937 to 1967, died Thursday
of heart failure.
   Haslet, who covered stories of interest to the states of
Oklahoma, Kansas and Missouri, died at the Hermitage Methodist
Retirement Home in nearby Alexandria, Va., where he had lived for
the past five years.
   A native of Wellington, Kan., Haslet began his journalism career
on the Wellington Daily News in 1922. He joined the AP in Chicago
in 1924 and later served in the Tulsa and Kansas City bureaus
before moving to Washington.
   During his years as a regional reporter Haslet became close to
the political leaders of the time, including former House speaker
Carl Albert of Oklahoma, Oklahoma governor and senator Robert Kerr,
and current Senate minority leader Robert Dole.
   A memorial service will be held at the Hermitage Methodist
Retirement Home at 1:30 p.m. Monday, followed by private burial
services.
   Haslet is survived by a son Charles C. Haslet Jr. of Herndon,
Va., four grandchildren, and three sisters, Mrs Louise Newberry of
Wellington, Kan., Mrs. Lola McGuire of Wichita, Kas., and Mrs.
Edith Fisher of Santa Rosa, Calif.

   Cocaine and paraphernalia used to sniff
the drug were found near the corpse of an NBC executive, leading
detectives to suspect the drug contributed to his death, police say.
   Jay Michelis, 50, was found dead Sept. 10 in his bedroom by a
servant. Nearby was a mirror covered with white powder and a $1
bill rolled up in the manner commonly used to snort cocaine, police
Lt. Greg Henderson said Thursday.
   A packet of the drug also was found in a wooden box in the room,
he said.
   A preliminary coroner's report attributed the death to heart
attack, said coroner's spokeswoman Pat Smith, adding that test
results wouldn't be available for at least a week.
   ``The reason for the decision is that he had bad coronary artery
disease with a fresh blood clot,'' Ms. Smith said. ``This is what
killed him.''
   The 30-year NBC veteran was West Coast vice president for
corporate and media relations.

   Two thousand unused hypodermic needles
have been found along a 10-mile stretch of beach in northern
Florida, the latest case of medical debris washing up on the
state's shoreline.
   For the last two months, wastes such as specimen tubes, drug
vials and microscope slides have turned up on beaches between
Pompano Beach and Fort Lauderdale, in southern Florida, and in the
Panhandle area.
   On Thursday, the needles, still in their plastic cases, were
discovered on beaches around Marineland, 20 miles south of St.
Augustine. The needles were the sort used for drawing blood samples
for laboratory tests.
   Flagler County officials collected the needles to keep
beachcombers or bathers from stepping on them.
   ``I don't think there's any possibility of anyone having to
worry about contamination,'' said Nick Chapman, Flagler County
Health Department administrator. ``It's no different than stepping
on a piece of glass.''
   No one knows where the needles came from. Chapman said they
might have been dumped from a ship.
   Many of the needles were on Marineland beaches, but some also
were found up to 10 miles south in Beverly Beach, said Sgt. Steve
Drenning of the Flagler County Sheriff's Department.
   The medical waste problem this summer has not been limited to
Florida. Beaches in the New York area were temporarily closed after
medical refuse, mostly syringes and vials, began coming ashore
shortly after July 4.

   Trombonist Lawrence Brown, who played for
decades with the Duke Ellington Orchestra after a stint with Louis
Armstrong, has died at home, his brother said. He was 81.
   Brown died Sept. 5 after suffering a stroke, said his brother,
Harold Brown.
   Brown was raised in Pasadena and studied piano, violin, tuba and
alto saxophone in addition to the trombone.
   He joined Armstrong in 1931 and Ellington the following year. He
left Ellington's orchestra in 1951 to tour with fellow Ellington
alumnus Johnny Hodges, then moved on to free-lance in New York
before rejoining Ellington in 1960.
   He recorded with Ellington, Hodges, Jimmy Rushing, Ruby Braff,
the Metronome All Stars, Lionel Hampton, Buck Clayton and others.
Brown returned to California in 1972 to to work for the Hollywood
local of the American Federation of Musicians and retired a few
years later.

   Anyone who wants to buy a condom in the

medicine store, according to a municipal ordinance that just about
everyone agrees can't be enforced.
   The 1953 law limits the places that can sell contraceptives. It
also prohibits the display or advertising of contraceptives or
``sex-inciting devices,'' apparently meaning that Marshall
University officials became lawbreakers when they began selling
condoms from vending machines three weeks ago.
   ``Obviously, if we had known about it, we would have checked it
out and confronted the issue,'' said Ray Welty, the Marshall
administrator in charge of vending.
   City attorney Charles F. Dodrill said Thursday the law can't be
enforced because the U.S. Supreme Court voided similar laws as
unconstitutional.

<TEXT>
   A state-owned jetliner carrying 104
people ran into a flock of birds, crashed and burst into flames
shortly after takeoff, killing at least 31 people, the airline and
sources said Friday.
   Thirty more people were injured and two people were missing in
the accident Thursday near Bahar Dar, close to the source of the
Blue Nile on Lake Tana's southern shore in Gojam province in the
northwest.
   The Ethiopian Airlines Boeing 737, which originated in Addis
Ababa, was on a scheduled domestic flight when a flock of birds was
sucked into both engines after it took off from Bahar Dar airport,
the airline said in a statement.
   The pilot tried to turn the plane back to Bahar Dar, but failed
and crashed into marshy ground 14 miles south of the airport. The
plane skidded on its belly for about 500 yards before the fusilage
broke into two, the airline said. Sources said the craft
immediately burst into flames.
   Seventy-one people escaped from the burning wreckage, 12 of them
seriously injured and 18 with minor injuries, the airline and the
sources said.
   The seriously injured were rushed to a hospital in Bahar Dar
while those with minor injuries were flown to Addis Ababa for
treatment Friday, sources said.
   It was the first statement to confirm fatalities in the crash
and the only official word since the Marxist government announced
the accident Thursday evening and said ``the majority'' of the
people on board the plane were safe.
   The airline did not issue a list of passengers or their
nationalities, but it was believed most of the people on the plane
were Ethiopian.
   The flight was on a scheduled run from Addis Ababa to Bahar Dar
to Asmara, the capital of northern Eritrea province. A civil
aviation official said birds have long been a problem at the Bahar
Dar airport.
   Bahar Dar is 200 miles northwest of Addis Ababa and 280 miles
southwest of Asmara. It sits on the southern shores of Lake Tana,
the source of the Blue Nile. The Blue Nile courses west out of the
Ethiopian highlands into Sudan, where it joins the White Nile at
Khartoum and continues on to the Mediterranean as the Nile River.

<HEAD>Senate Democrats Proposing to Expand Subminimum Wage for Students</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MATT YANCEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Labor Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Senate Democrats offered Friday to expand
slightly an existing subminimum wage for full-time students to head
off what they called a ``hire 'em and fire 'em'' 90-day training
wage backed by Republicans.
   Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., offered an amendment to his
bill raising the minimum wage from its current $3.35 an hour to
$4.55 an hour by 1991 that would allow employers to hire up to 12
students instead of the six now allowed for up to 20 hours a week
at 85 percent of the minimum wage.
   Only about 100,000 students are now earning the $2.85 subminimum
wage, according to Labor Department officials, compared with
515,000 students in 1978. Kennedy said his proposal would allow
employers to double the number of students at the subminimum wage
on their payrolls.
   The tactic was aimed at heading off a Republican amendment by
Sen. Orrin Hatch of Utah to establish an 80 percent training wage
for newly hired workers for up to 90 days.
   Hatch indicated that Republicans were unwilling to vote Friday
on Kennedy's student wage, putting off the key
Republican-Democratic showdown on the politically volatile minimum
wage issue until next week, eight weeks before the November
election.
   President Reagan, Vice President George Bush and Sen. Dan
Quayle, R-Ind., Bush's running mate, in the past have all
conditioned any increase in the minimum wage to a massive expansion
of the subminimum wage.
   Bush, campaigning in Ohio, refused again Friday to specify how
big of an increase in the minimum wage he favored.
   ``I don't know how much of an increase,'' he said, but repeated
that any upward adjustment should be coupled with a differential
for a lower training wage.
   Quayle, silent on the subject in recent days, offered an
amendment while the bill was still in the Senate Labor Committee in
June to couple a minimum wage increase to $4 an hour over two years
with a subminimum training wage. The amendment was never voted on.
   Kennedy complained none of the Republican training wage
proposals require employers to provide any training. He said the
real purpose was to give employers a ``windfall'' lower wage in
jobs that have turnover rates of up to 400 percent a year.
   ``Who honestly believes that it takes three months for someone
to learn to mop a floor or change the sheets on a bed?'' Kennedy
said. ``This is a pure and simple wage cut.''
   He said the Republican proposal would provide employers with a
powerful incentive to ``throw working families out on the street
once every 90 days'' and replace them with a new force of trainees.
   ``This is the hire 'em and fire 'em wage, maybe we can call it
the churn 'em and burn 'em wage,'' Kennedy said. ``The Bush push
will turn America's working people into vagabonds and gypsies,
thrown from job to job every three months. Can this be what George
Bush means when he talks about a kinder, gentler America?''
   Hatch called Kennedy's counterproposal for an expansion of the
currently allowed student waivers a ``not really very effective
bureaucratic way of doing things.''
   ``The purpose of the training wage is not to help full-time
students,'' Hatch said. ``The purpose is to open the door of
opportunity for those who have nothing, who are under-educated,
unskilled.''
   Hatch cited various studies estimating that increasing the
minimum wage would cause the loss of between 200,000 and 800,000
new jobs over the next three years.
   ``The reason 16 million new jobs _ 12 million of them at $10 an
hour or more _ have been created (since 1981) is because we haven't
had an increase in the minimum wage,'' he said.
   The federally mandated wage floor has been frozen at $3.35 since
January 1981, the longest time in its 50-year history without an
increase. Meanwhile, its purchasing power has dropped 30 percent to
$2.60 measured in today's dollars.
   Kennedy's bill would raise by 40-cent increments each year to
$3.75 in 1989, $4.15 in 1989 and $4.55 in 1990 _ a total of 35.8
percent over the three years. It also would increase the exemption
for small businesses from the current threshold of $362,000 in
gross sales to $500,000.
   According to Labor Department figures, about 6.7 million workers
were paid the minimum wage or less in 1986. But the bill also would
directly benefit 11.5 million other workers earning between $3.35
and $4.50.
   House Speaker Jim Wright, D-Tex., said Friday that the House is
awaiting Senate action before considering the issue.
   ``The likelihood is we'll take it up, vote, pass it,'' he said.

<HEAD>Doctor Says Deaver Suffered Memory Impairment</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES ROWLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A doctor who treated Michael K. Deaver for
alcoholism testified Friday that the former presidential aide
suffered memory impairment when he took tranquilizers during
hospital treatment for the disease.
   Dr. William E. Flynn said the combination of alcohol withdrawal
and heavy doses of the tranqilizer Valium impaired Deaver's
judgment and memory during a 1985 hospital stay.
   ``He wasn't really processing or dealing with things in an
appropriate manner,'' said Flynn, head of the alcoholism clinic at
Georgetown University Hospital. Flynn testified at a court hearing
on Deaver's medical condition.
   Defense lawyers are trying to convince U.S. District Judge
Thomas Penfield Jackson that Deaver's alcoholism is a mitigating
factor that should be taken into consideration when Deaver is
sentenced next week for three perjury convictions.
   The former White House deputy chief of staff was convicted last
December of three counts of lying to a federal grand jury and a
House subcommittee by saying he couldn't recall contacting
government officials on behalf of high-paying lobbying clients.
   Deaver, 50, faces a possible five-year prison term and a $6,800
fine for each of the three convictions. Sentencing is scheduled for
Sept. 23.
   The defense contends Deaver wasn't lying in 1986 when he
testified he couldn't recall telephoning then-Transportation
Secretary Elizabeth Dole from his hospital bed on June 3, 1985, on
behalf of Trans World Airlines.
   Flynn, who also treated Deaver for alcoholism in October 1986,
testified that the former presidential aide had reduced mental
functions during the detoxification treatments.
   ``Do you believe under the circumstances that his judgment was
impaired in any way?'' defense lawyer Randall J. Turk asked Flynn.
   ``I would say definitely,'' Flynn said.
   ``And his memory?'' Turk continued.
   ``Definitely,'' the doctor replied.
   Later, Flynn said he noted impairment of Deaver's ``memory of
the kinds of things that were happening to him'' during the
three-day hospital stay.
   But the doctor also said that throughout the visit, Deaver
``remained quite alert and never showed any signs of depression or
any signs of heavy sedation'' while he took large doses of Valium.
   Deaver has remained sober since undergoing a month-long
treatment in 1986 at a clinic.
   The medical testimony was not offered during Deaver's trial
because the defense rested without calling any witnesses.
   The presentation during a two-day hearing that began Thursday
appeared to be as much an attempt to put Deaver's defense on the
record for an appellate court as it is to persuade Jackson to
impose a lenient sentence.
   The defense is expected to argue on appeal that rulings Jackson
made during the trial last year made it impossible for Deaver to
put on a defense.
   During the trial, Jackson refused to strike from the indictment
certain allegations of perjury left unproven at the close of the
prosecution's case.
   Jackson ruled that he would keep these elements of the case
intact until after the close of the defense case, giving the
prosecution an opportunity to prove those points when questioning
Deaver or other defense witnesses.
   The defense then rested without calling any witnesses, including
Deaver or medical experts who could testify about how alcohol
impaired his memory.
   Independent counsel Whitney North Seymour Jr. argued Thursday
that the medical records would show no evidence of a memory loss.
Seymour contended that Deaver chose to remember some things and
forget others when he testified under oath in 1986 during the
investigations of his lobbying for possible ethics-law violations.
   Flynn testified that Deaver insisted on checking out of the
hospital after his first visit sooner than doctors thought
advisable and refused to enter a treatment program.
   ``He was adamant he didn't need further treatment. He would
handle this himself,'' Flynn said. At this point Deaver had not
really faced up to the fact that he was an alcoholic, even though
Flynn said he thought the former presidential aide had been
drinking heavily for several years.
   ``He was the kind of alcoholic who had been very successful at
hiding from a large number of people his alcoholism,'' Flynn said.
Deaver's family was not told of his problem until shortly before
his first hospitalization.
   When he returned for treatment in October 1986, Deaver again
resisted going into a clinic, Flynn said.
   But after some encouragement by his family and advice from his
lawyers, Deaver agreed to enter an alcoholism rehabilitation center
in Havre de Grace, Md., Flynn said.

<TEXT>
   Nicolas F. Brady took the oath of office
Friday as the nation's 68th secretary of the Treasury, pledging to
aggressively push Reagan administration economic policies.
   With his wife Kitty standing at his side in the ornate Roosevelt
Room of the White House, Brady, 58, was sworn in by retired Supreme
Court Justice Warren E. Burger.
   ``Your leadership has produced the longest sustained period of
prosperity in most Americans' memories,'' the Wall Street
investment banker told the president after finishing the
oath-taking. ``Not only have the economic statistics turned out to
be right, but what is more important is that they have meant better
lives for Americans.''
   Brady, co-chairman of the Wall Street firm of Dillon Read & Co.,
who headed the commission Reagan set up last year to investigate
the circumstances behind the Oct. 19 stock market crash, said the
Treasury Department under his leadership would ``do its homework''
to advance Reagan's policies on taxes and spending.
   Brady succeeds James A. Baker III, who left Treasury last month
to become chairman of George Bush's presidential campaign.
   ``I was always taught that the best loan that you could make was
a character loan _ one that looked beyond the hard numbers and took
a leap of faith and counted on the character and strength of the
individual involved,'' Brady told Reagan.
   ``That principle applies to countries as well,'' he said. ``The
Treasury Department will ... do the pick-and-shovel work to make
sure the numbers are right, but we will always be guided by your
faith that character is at the root of all human endeavor.''
   Reagan said that he could ``think of no one more no one more
qualified'' for the Treasury secretary's job.
   ``In an investment banking career that has spanned three
decades, Nick Brady has earned the respect of the financial and
economic communities for his integrity and professional
accomplishments,'' the president said.
   ``Secretary Brady will be chief economic spokesman for the
administration and I will be relying on him to continue our
policies that have proved so successful,'' he said.
   ``Well, Nick, I'm delighted to turn over the keys to the
Treasury Department to you,'' Reagan said.
   ``Don't lose them,'' said the 77-year-old president. ``Alexander
Hamilton gave them to me personally,'' he said of the nation's
first Treasury chief.

<HEAD>Official Urges Rejection of Compensation for Cancer Victims</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID GOELLER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Justice Department official urged a House
subcommittee on Friday to reject ``ill-conceived'' legislation to
compensate some cancer victims among southwestern uranium miners
and people who lived downwind of 1950s U.S. atomic tests in Nevada.
   ``The bill does not require that causation between exposure to
radiation and cancer be established or that any legal theory of
liability on the part of the United States be proven,'' said Steven
Valentine, deputy assistant attorney general in the department's
civil division.
   Valentine, restating opposition voiced by Justice officials for
more than a decade, said the department does not believe a link has
been proven between radiation and cancers in miners and people
receiving fallout from the atmospheric weapons tests.
   ``The assumptions underlying this ill-conceived proposal are
either subject to serious dispute or demonstrably erroneous,'' said
Valentine, adding that the department would recommend a veto of
legislation being pushed by lawmakers from Utah to compensate
victims or their survivors.
   ``I am incredulous,'' responded Rep. Barney Frank, D-Mass.,
chairman of the Judiciary subcommittee on administrative law and
government relations. Frank said radiation victim compensation
``will be high on the (subcommittee's) agenda next year. It won't
go away.''
   Frank's hearing centered on bills introduced by Rep. Wayne
Owens, D-Utah, and Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, to pay compensation
similar to what Congress has voted in recent years to military
people who participated in the tests and to Marshall Islanders
injured by U.S. nuclear tests in the Pacific.
   Their proposal would give $50,000 each to people who lived in a
designated downwind area of Nevada, Utah and Arizona during the
Nevada tests and who developed cancers that studies show had a high
probability of being caused by the radiation.
   Payments of $100,000 each would go to people who worked for
minimum periods in underground uranium mines in Utah, Colorado, New
Mexico and Arizona between 1949 and 1971 and who developed lung
cancer and other respiratory problems.
   The lawmakers say the legislation is needed because a U.S.
appeals court has overturned a circuit court ruling that awarded
damages to some 1,200 downwind residents on grounds that the
government had failed to warn them of the tests' dangers.
   Owens, who as a private attorney represented some of the
plaintiffs, said that he also has had personal experience with
health problems of former miners.
   ``Last year, my brother-in-law died from lung cancer,'' Owens
testified. ``He worked in the Marysvale uranium mine in Utah for
less than six months _ a healthy man who never smoked a single
cigarette in his life dies from lung cancer.''
   Owens said payments to the miners are justified because the
government knew of high levels of radiation in the mines but failed
to warn the miners or force the mine owners to install proper
ventilating equipment.
   ``The government demonstrated a reckless disregard for the lives
of these uranium miners,'' he testified. ``The uranium miners
became mere guinea pigs in a government death watch.''
   Arden Higgins, who worked in the Marysvale mine from 1953 to
1959, told the subcommittee that although he never smoked, he lost
his right lung to cancer in 1983.
   ``I've watched my partners and my friends die of lung cancer,''
Higgins said. ``It seems that each year another one dies.''
   He said federal inspectors took radioactivity readings in the
mine and that physicians tested the workers. ``They never mentioned
once what the radiation was doing to us,'' he said. ``They told us
we were all right.''

   Business inventories in July rose at the
slowest rate in 11 months, the government said Friday, suggesting
to analysts that underlying economic growth remains strong despite
a pause in business sales.
   The Commerce Department said inventories rose 0.3 percent to a
seasonally adjusted $733.7 billion. It was the 19th consecutive
gain, but the smallest since a 0.2 percent increase in August 1987.
   Economists sometimes take rising inventories as a sign of
weakness, fearing that too many goods piling up on shelves and
backlots will trigger production cutbacks and layoffs at factories.
   However, they point out that the buildup over the last year and
a half has been trong sales, despite a dip in July.
   ``The key thing to me is that inventories are remaining very
moderate,accompanied by s so basically the implication is for strong third
and
fourth quarter growth,'' said Robert Wescott, chief economist of
Alphametrics, a consulting firm in Bala Cynwyd, Pa.
   Business sales fell 0.2 percent in July to $487.7 billion, the
first decline since November when some buyers were spooked by the
October stock market crash.
   However, the slight drop followed a very strong 1.4 percent jump
in June, the second best in more than a year.
   ``When you put June anl relatively
active. The cone-shaped dwellings date back more than a century.
   She planted metal spikes into the ground that will show future
researchers where the huts are, even if everything above ground is
later burned away.
   ``The fire hasn't hit them yet, but there's a good chance they
may,'' she said. ``That's a resource that very well could be lost
in fire activity, but they (the wickiups) have been recorded.''
   At one point this summer, another cluster of wickiups in the
northwestern corner of Yellowstone was threatened. ``But the plans
people (firefighting strategists) were ready to protect them,''
Capek said.
   As the fire approached the dwellings, she notified the fire
command of their existence and precautions were taken.
   In many cases, archaeologists will have to wait until the fires
abate before they can learn what happened to historical sites.
   For example, Timothy Mann, a park naturalist and historian, said
he could not say whether the flames had claimed trees that early
park explorers initialed, or ones bearing rope burns made when U.S.
Army troops chased Chief Joseph and his Nez Perce tribe in 1877,
winching their wagons down a steep slope.
   Mann also wondered about the fate of trees along Yellowstone's
southern boundary that bore markings by the first surveyors of
Yellowstone.
   Paradoxically, the fires can be beneficial to archaeologists in
one way, in burning away thick undergrowth that hides ``lithic
scatters'' _ arrowheads, primitive stone tools and spear points in
the ground that would not be damaged by fire, Capek said.
   Though fear continues about sites that existed before
Yellowstone became a park _ it was authorized in 1872 _ the park's
more modern structures have fared better.
   Some decades-old cabins have burned, but the park's five
federally designated landmarks _ the Old Faithful Inn, the Madison
Museum, the Norris Museum, the log canopy over the northeast
entrance gate and the Fishing Bridge Museum _ all have escaped the
flames.
   Also spared was the Queen's Laundry, a bathhouse dating to the
1880s that was one of the first federally funded structures built
in Yellowstone, said Capek.

<HEAD>Building Collapse That Killed 28 Sparks New Safety Rules</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal officials are proposing new rules
aimed at preventing disasters like last year's collapse of an
apartment building that killed 28 construction workers.
   The U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration's
proposed rules may not be implemented until next summer, after the
administration evaluates comment on the plan.
   The proposal applies only to lift-slab techniques, which were
being used when the partially completed L'Ambiance Plaza collapsed.
   The technique is a seldom-used method in which concrete floor
slabs are poured on the ground, one on top of the other. After the
slabs are cured, they are jacked upwards along vertical steel
columns, then fastened at their proper levels.
   An OSHA official, Roy Gurnham, said the rules clarify the
requirement that all non-essential workers be cleared from a
lift-slab building while the floors are being lifted.
   The rule always has been in effect, but was interpreted by
workers and managers to mean that construction crews could work
below a floor that was fastened.
   OSHA officials previously assumed that a permanent floor above
the workers would break the fall of a higher concrete floor that
slipped and fell.
   Other portions of the new rules would require that a ``qualified
designer'' design lift-slab projects.
   Also, the rules say that all jacks lifting the floors should be
able to lift 2.5 times the weight expected to be applied and all
slabs should be lifted in a level position.

<HEAD>Rehabilitated Bolshevik's Works To Be Published</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Communist Party has published a collection of
works by Nikolai I. Bukharin, a Bolshevik leader who was shot under
dictator Josef Stalin, in another step toward his rehabilitation,
Tass reported today.
   The book, prepared by the Institute of Marxism-Leninism of the
party's Central Committee, coincides with the centennial of
Bukharin's birth.
   The collection includes articles and comments on communist
theory and party politics, economic policy and culture, the
official news agency said.
   Bukharin was a ``distinguished social scientist whose name and
writings have for long been unfairly buried in oblivion,'' Tass
said.
   In February, Bukharin was cleared of spying charges for which he
was shot in 1938. The party readmitted him posthumously in July.
   The rehabilitation was part of a review launched by Soviet
leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev of party officials killed or arrested
by Stalin.
   Bukharin, an economist, favored moderate economic policies that
are similar to those being implemented under Gorbachev's program of
perestroika, or restructuring.
   In recent months, the Soviet press has published several
articles on Bukharin. The newspaper Sovietskaya Kultura on Tuesday
reported a lecture he delivered in Paris two years before he was
shot.

   The condition of admitted pipe bomb killer
and forger Mark Hofmann was upgraded Friday from critical to
serious and stable following a prison drug overdose, but police
still could not interview him.
   ``He has improved considerably overnight. His pulse, blood
pressure and heart rate are all stable,'' said University of Utah
Health Sciences Center spokesman John Dwan. ``He's waking up,
coming out of the coma. He is only able to whisper at this time,
but he appears to be oriented, and he's following medical
instructions.''
   Officers were called to Hofmann's cell Thursday by his cellmate,
who could not wake him up for lunch. Hofmann initially was reported
in critical and unstable condition following what Dwan said was an
overdose of an undetermined anti-depressant drug.
   Hofmann was sentenced to five years to life after pleading
guilty in January 1987 to having planted pipe bombs that killed
Steven Christensen, a documents collector, and Kathleen Sheets,
wife of Christensen associate Gary Sheets, on Oct. 15, 1985. At a
January hearing, the state Board of Pardons told him he would spend
the rest of his life in prison.
   Hofmann, 33, confessed that he killed Christensen and Sheets to
cover up his career as a forger of historical documents, many of
which he sold to the Mormon Church.
   Dwan said Hofmann was gradually regaining consciousness Friday
and was taken off a respirator, but was in no condition to be
interrogated.
   ``He's still not lucid,'' Dwan said. ``Our medical personnel
have had to sedate him twice for medical purposes.''
   Armed corrections officers, supplemented by hospital security
and university police, guarded the door to Hofmann's room and
entrances to the intensive-care unit.
   Corrections spokesman Juan Benavidez said prison officials were
concerned the overdose might have been a prelude to an escape
attempt, although investigators had no hard evidence of that.
   Dwan said the security was for Hofmann's safety, too.
   ``We've received a couple calls here already from people saying
`Why don't you just let him die,' and so forth,'' he said.
``They're here to make sure he doesn't escape, but also that no one
bothers him.''
   Hofmann's wife, Doralee, recently filed for divorce and Hofmann
signed a consent form about five week ago. He spoke with her and
his children by telephone Wednesday but gave no indication anything
was amiss, prison officials said.
   He had been on administrative lockdown, confined to his cell 23
hours a day, since a purported Hofmann plot against Pardons Board
members was uncovered. His attorney, Ronald Yengich, has denied
such a plot existed.

<DATELINE>BROWNSVILLE, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hurricane Gilbert's leading edge
lashed the coast and its 120 mph winds swirled toward landfall
today, as officials in the Caribbean and Mexico tallied billions in
damage from the giant storm blamed for at least 58 deaths.
   Thousands of residents along Texas' 370-mile coast, many
evacuated to higher ground after piling sandbags in the doorways of
their homes and boarding up windows, huddled in shelters and waited
for the news:
   When and where would Gilbert hit?
   ``We are going to sit and wait and pray for the best,'' said
Larry Brown, director of transportation for Brownsville, where
officials estimated that as much as one-fourth of the city of
110,000 could end up in emergency shelters.
   By Thursday evening, Port Isabel, a city of about 5,000 just
east of Brownsville, was a virtual ghost town. Officials also
evacuated the coastal resorts of South Padre Island and Galveston.
   More than a half dozen tornadoes accompanying the hurricane hit
the Brownsville area today in advance of the center of the storm,
blowing over at least two homes and injuring one person, a boy who
suffered a minor head wound. Scattered flooding was reported.
   Police were ordered to leave North Padre Island when water began
flooding the causeway to the mainland. The city had asked everyone
to leave the island but police Chief Robert Olson said he had heard
that about 10 to 15 residents remained there overnight.
   An estimated 25,000 people evacuated low-lying villages in
southern Louisiana and officials said they wouldn't let people
return home until they were sure Gilbert had run ashore elsewhere.
   A Coast Guard helicopter today rescued five people from a
fishing boat near Port Isabel and the Coast Guard sent a search and
rescue boat after seven people on a boat in Matagorda Bay. The boat
was found beached with no one aboard, and officials were searching
along the coast for the occupants.
   By early today, the storm had weakened since its destructive
assault on the Caribbean, and despite forecasters' predictions
Gilbert showed little sign of strengthening as it headed for the
area around Brownsville at the southern tip of Texas.
   ``It has not strengthened since it left Mexico, but we still
believe some strengthening is possible. It's not ever going to get
back up to Category 5 strength with 175 mph winds, but it very
possibly could reach 130 or 140 mph,'' said Jim Gross, a hurricane
specialist at the National Hurricane Center in Coral Gables, Fla.
   The Hurricane Center said if Gilbert continued in the same
direction, the eye of the storm would come ashore near the
Texas-Mexico border sometime this evening.
   According to a rough estimate, the eye of the hurricane will hit
the coast between 5 p.m. and 9 p.m., about 50 to 60 miles south of
Brownsville, said Dave Petrovich, a weather service forecaster in
Miami.
   Winds gusting up to 60 mph, accompanied by rain and squalls,
began pounding South Texas and northern Mexico today as preview of
the fury of Gilbert, which has left at least 58 dead, $8 billion in
damage and more than half a million homeless on several Caribbean
islands and Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula.
   The National Weather Service issued a hurricane warning for
Mexico's northern coast and the southern half of the Texas coast
from Brownsville to Port O'Connor, including 250,000-resident
Corpus Christi. A hurricane watch remained in effect for the
remainder of the Texas coast, from Port O'Connor north to Port
Arthur near Louisiana.
   At 2 p.m. CDT, the storm center was near latitude 24 north,
longitude 97.1 west, or about 130 miles south-southeast of
Brownsville, moving northwest at 12 mph, with maximum sustained
winds of 120 mph and accompanied by a 10- to 15-inch rainfall.
   Under state law, Brownsville officials could not order people to
evacuate their homes, but police Sgt. Dean Poos noted, ``Where are
you going to put 100,000 people anyway?''
   ``We have all kinds of people here, from those that need
Pampers, to those that need wheelchairs,'' said Ersel Lantz, who
was heading the Red Cross effort at the city's civic auditorium.
   Gov. Bill Clements dispatched Texas National Guard units to
McAllen, Alice and Corpus Christi.
   ``In terms of preparations, there's really nothing left to be
done,'' said Judy Oestrich, assistant American Red Cross chapter
manager in Corpus Christi. ``We're doing what we do _ taking care
of people.''
   Juan Garza, city manager of Corpus Christi, said 12 to 15
evacuation centers are full, with a total of 26 to be set up if
necessary.
   ``I think we're ready. What you do for a hurricane is you don't
manage it; you just kind of endure it,'' he said today on CBS's
``This Morning.''
   In Matamoros, Mexico, a city of 280,000 on the northeastern U.S.
border across from Brownsville, thousands of people crowded into
shelters set up at schools, churches and public buildings after the
hurricane left 17 dead in the Yucatan Peninsula.
   On the island city of Galveston, scene of the worst natural
disaster in U.S. history when a hurricane hit in 1900, killing
6,000, about 40 percent of the island's 65,000 residents were
evacuated by early today, said Galveston public information officer
David Hoover.
   To the north in Houston, NASA's Johnson Space Center all but
shut down Thursday, with most of its 9,000 employees sent home to
prepare for Gilbert.
   And in south Louisiana, 25,000 people fled the most vulnerable
villages despite being out of the high-danger area.
   Gilbert's sustained winds have died down from 175 mph in the
Caribbean to 120 mph after it passed over Yucatan on Wednesday. Its
ranking was lowered from Category 5 _ the most fierce _ to a
Category 3.
   The storm's earlier landfalls left at least 26 people dead in
Jamaica, five in the Dominican Republic and 10 in Haiti.
   In addition, a 3-year-old Rockport, Texas, boy drowned early
today after falling off his family's shrimp boat as it was being
moved to safe mooring. Calhoun County Sheriff's office spokesman
Rick Prush said the boy's death was indirectly related to Gilbert.

<HEAD>GOP Congressmen Say Three Democratic Panelists are Anti-Israeli</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A group of Republican congressmen sought to
defuse charges of anti-semitism in the GOP campaign by charging
Friday that Democratic presidential nominee Michael Dukakis
appointed three ``anti-Israeli, pro-Palestinian'' members to the
party's ruling body.
   Rep. Norman Lent, R-N.Y., said the three objectionable members
were appointed to the 400-member Democratic National Committee
after the pention in Atlanta as a concession to
defeated presidential contender Jesse Jackson.
   ``The presence of (the three) on the Democratic team raises
questions about Michael Dukakis' judgmentarty's July conv and his submission
to
Jesse Jackson,'' Lent told a news conference.
   ``Obviously, Governor Dukakis has failed to grasp the message
his appointments send,'' said Lent, challenging Dukakis to force
the resignations of the three.
   Lent identified them as the Rev. Willie Barrow, executive
director of Jackson's Chicago-based Operation PUSH; Robert Farrell,
a Los Angeles city councilman and close Jackson associate; and Ruth
Ann Skaff of Houston, whom he said is a spokeswoman for the
pro-Palestinian Ad Hoc Committtee on Lebanon.
   Lent said Barrow and Farrell are supporters of radical Muslim
leader Louis Farrakhan, who has made anti-Semitic statements. He
said Skaff has led anti-Israel demonstrations.
   The Repmer Secretary Says Navy Should Use Fewer Consultants
</TEXT>
<BYLINE>By TIM AHERN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former Navy Secretary John Lehman said Friday
the Navy should use fewer consultants, but he strongly defended his
tenure against criticism arising from the current Pentagon bribery
investigation.
   ``The changes that we made in the Navy procurement system were
deep and fundamental,'' Lehman told the House Armed Services
Committee. ``I do not believe that any of the changes that we made
could by their nature increase the incidence of improper behavior.''
   Lehman resigned last year after leading the naval build-up that
was a key part of President Reagan's defense program.
   But the Navy is now the center of a bribery investigation by
federal prosecutors, who are looking at allegations of payoffs and
bribes from consultants, many of whom were former Pentagon
employees.
   The consultants were seeking information from Pentagon officials
about details of contracts, information that could make the
difference in winning multi-million dollar contracts. No charges
have yet been filed.
   A key figure of the investigation is Melvyn Paisley, the former
assistant navy secretary for research and engineering and a close
associate of Lehman during their Navy tenure. Paisley resigned and
became a high-priced consultant shortly after Lehman quit to take a
Wall Street job in April, 1987.
   Lehman's testimony to the committee was his first major public
comment since the investigation became public three months ago.
   Lehman declined to talk about details of the investigation and
committee members did not ask him for specifics because they did
not want to affect the probe.
   Lehman noted the Navy has more consultants than the other
services, chiefly because the Navy has fewer officers. Consultants
do work for the Navy performed by officers in the Air Force and
Army, he said.
   But ``I was never comfortable with the dependence on
consultants,'' Lehman said, detailing what he said were generally
unsuccessful efforts to reduce the number of consultants.
   ``Consultants are essential, but we do have too many,'' he said.
``The Navy could substantially reduce its reliance on consultants.''
   Two reforms suggested in the wake of the investigation are
requiring consultants to register, and requiring them to disclose
all their contracts to prevent conflicts of interest. Lehman
endorsed those changes.
   The combative former official also strongly defended changes he
made during his tenure. Some critics have suggested the changes,
such as more centralized management and elimination of some layers
of bureaucracy, caused the climate which led to the investigation.
   ``With regard to strong centralized policy-making, and
decentralized execution, I see no way that either principle
increases the opportunity for waste, fraud and abuse,'' he said.
   ``I am very proud of the achievements made in rebuilding the
Navy during my tenure,'' he said. ``I do believe the changes that
led to that success made the system by its nature more susceptible
to waste, fraud, and abuse.''
   Overall, said Lehman, the Pentagon should be reorganized to give
much more authority for daily decisions to lower-level personnel,
rather than top officials. He opposed the creation of a single
purchasing ``czar,'' a change proposed by some legislators.
   ``In rough book value, the Department of Defense equals the top
30 companies on the Fortune 500 list combined,'' he said. ``And yet
the Pentagon is organized in theory like a small business, with all
operational authority and decision-making drawn up in one
centralized office.''
   He proposed that the secretary of defense simply make policy,
and turn all other major decisions over to the three services.
   The staff should also be reduced by half, he said, and that goal
could be easily achieved.
   ``Normal attrition in the military and civil service is about 8
percent per year, so careful use of hiring freezes brings a rapid
natural shrinkage,'' he said. ``Increased opportunity for voluntary
early retirement with pensions or large severance payments would
enable a new administration to cut the Pentagon bureaucracy by 30
percent in three years without firing a single person.''

   President Reagan is to blame for a lack of
coordinated leadership in the nation's fight against the AIDS
epidemic, several business leaders said Friday at a conference on
the deadly disease.
   ``The simple truth is that the President has a moral and
probably constitutional imperative to trigger America's best
defense from this plague. He has failed,'' said Stephen E. Herbits,
executive vice president of corporate development for Joseph E.
Seagram & Sons Inc.
   Individual government agencies, such as the federal Centers for
Disease Control, have made great strides against AIDS, said Dr.
Theodore Cooper, chief executive officer of Upjohn Co., a
pharmaceutical manufacturer.
   But ``there is no leadership thrust in the government as a
whole'' to coordinate AIDS research developments and public policy
proposals, said Cooper, who chaired the national Institute of
Medicine AIDS Oversight Committee.
   Leslye Arsht, the White House public information officer
assigned to answer AIDS policy questions, was in a meeting Friday
afternoon and not immediately available for comment, a receptionist
said.
   Cooper called on the Reagan administration to recreate a central
presidential commission on AIDS to coordinate policy and research.
   Herbits and Cooper were among more than a dozen leaders from
business, labor and government who spoke at the conference
sponsored by the National Leadership Coalition on AIDS, based in
Washington.
   The conference was aimed at spurring greater corporate
leadership in the national war on AIDS, or acquired immune
deficiency syndrome, a fatal, incurable disease that destroys the
body's ability to fight sickness.
   ``The absence of our leadership will convince other community
leaders that this is not really an important problem,'' Cooper said.
   Herbits, who was a special assistant in the White House and
Defense Department before joining Seagrams in 1977, said Reagan
failed to make AIDS a top priority.
   ``In seven State of the Union speeches, Mr. Reagan stood before
our nation and never even mentioned that AIDS exists,'' Herbits
said in a speech prepared for the conference. ``Each year until
this, Congress doubled the Reagan administration's request for
funds dedicated to the fight on AIDS.
   ``Yet, the administration still underspent its appropriation,''
he said. ``The administration is still taking too long to approve
drugs for experimental therapies and still delays approval of
contracts to search for appropiate therapies for those who already
have the virus.''
   As of this week, 72,766 AIDS cases have been reported to the
CDC; 41,064 people, or 56 percent, are dead.
   While AIDS still primarily afflicts homosexuals and intravenous
drug users, a CDC official estimates that 5 percent of the cases
were spread by heterosexual contact.

   Schools and factories closed Friday as thousands
of Armenians staged a strike to renew their call for annexation of
a disputed region in neighboring Azerbaijan, an activist said.
   Hovik Vassilyan said 150,000 people demonstrated on a main
square in the Armenian capital to support a work stoppage that
started Monday in Nagorno-Karabakh, the disputed region in
Azerbaijan.
   The strike in Nagorno-Karabakh, populated mostly by Armenians,
is scheduled to end Sunday, Vassilyan said.
   ``People are everywhere,'' said Vassilyan, a former political
prisoner and the editor of an unsanctioned Armenian nationalist
journal. He spoke by telephone from Yerevan.
   The Armenians are demanding that Nagorno-Karabakh be removed
from the control of Azerbaijan and become part of the Armenian
republic. The region has been part of Azerbaijan since 1923.
   Armenians, who are predominantly Christian, claim economic,
cultural and religious discrimination under the rule of
Azerbaijanis, most of whom are Moslem.
   In July, central authorities in Moscow rejected the demand to
turn Nagorno-Karabakh over to Armenia and instead mandated economic
and social improvements to the region.
   Armenians first started agitating for control over
Nagorno-Karabakh in February with street demonstrations and
strikes. At least 32 people were killed in rioting related to the
dispute in the Azerbaijani city of Sumgait.

   A police cruiser responding to a call struck
four pedestrians on Friday, the second time this week that people
were hit by a police car.
   Jenny Romeo, 74, of Brooklyn, was in critical condition at Kings
County Hospital, with a fractured pelvis and a fracture to the
right side of her neck, hospital spokeswoman Leah Johnson said.
   Milton Ralichstien, 71, of Manhattan, was in stable condition
with bruises from his knees to his feet on both legs, Ms. Johnson
said. The others were treated and released, she said.
   The two police officers in the cruiser were treated for trauma
at Long Island College Hospital. They were identified by police as
Brian O'Malley, 27, the driver, and Roger Smith, 34.
   Friday's incident occurred shortly after 8:30 a.m., when the
cruiser, which had been parked in Brooklyn, received a call of a
man with a gun nearby.
   As the officers were driving to investigate, O'Malley's foot
slipped from the brake, onto the accelerator and then became wedged
between the pedals, according to police spokesman Officer Louis
Llanes.
   The car accelerated and struck the pedestrians as they crossed a
street, Llanes said. O'Malley stopped the car using his left foot
on the brake pedal, the spokesman said.
   On Sunday, a cruiser struck two girls during a 68-block chase
that began when the officers tried to stop car for a traffic
violation. One suffered a head injury, and the other suffered two
broken legs.

<HEAD>Reagan Says Cutback In Panama Will Not Hurt Anti-Drug Efforts</HEAD>

   President Reagan said Friday reducing the U.S.
diplomatic presence in Panama would not harm efforts to stem the
flow of drugs into the United States.
   ``We're concerned right now about some of our people there and I
think that this is just a measure we're taking and probably
temporary,'' Reagan said.
   About half of the 160 diplomatic posts in Panama, including some
at the regional Drug Enforcement Administration, are to be vacated,
a State Department official said.
   The Reagan administration last May suspended virtually all
diplomatic contact with Panama. This has left many U.S. diplomats
in the country with little to do.
   Charles E. Redman, the State Department spokesman, said ``there
have been some threats against mission personnel'' and that the
administration wanted to reduce their ``vulnerabilities.''
   The cutback was recommended by Ambassador Arthur Davis and has
been under way since last spring. Redman said it would be completed
unless Secretary of State George P. Shultz received ``appeals''
from other agencies and decided in their favor.
   Other offices that may be closed or severely reduced are the
Justice Department and the U.S. Customs Service.
   Reagan was asked if the cutback would hamper anti-drug efforts
while he was having his photograph taken with NATO Secretary
General Manfred Woerner in the Oval Office.
   ``No, I don't think we're doing anything to reduce our ability
to interdict drugs,'' Reagan replied.
   Three State Department officials stressed, meanwhile, there
would be no reduction in the U.S. Southern Command or in the Panama
Canal Commission,
   ``We're doing it because the lessons of history have taught us
that when we are in a potentially confrontational situation, it
makes sense to reduce potential vulnerability,'' one of the
officials said Thursday night.
   After all, he said, the United States was trying to get rid of
the head of Panama's armed forces, Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega.
   Noriega, the effective leader of Panama, has been indicted on
drug trafficking charges by federal grand juries in Florida. He has
successfully countered all U.S. efforts to drive him out.
   These included cancellation of all normal dealings with the
country. The prohibition is so extensive American diplomats are
even forbidden to apply for a renewal of their automobile license
plates.
   Despite persistent reports that Noriega was on the ropes, the
general has held on while Eric Arturo Delvalle, who had U.S.
backing to succeed Noriega, was ousted in February by the
pro-Noriega National Assembly.
   Administration sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity,
said some of the extra U.S. security personnel sent to Panama last
spring by the Pentagon would be withdrawn gradually.
   According to an official of the Southern Command, 240 cases of
harassment of U.S. servicemen were reported between February and
August.
   The command has about 10,000 American servicemen stationed in
Panama permanently and a like number of military dependents.
   Referring to the diplomats, Redman said ``we are reducing the
vulnerabilities inherent in having a large number of United States
government personnel living and working in areas dominated by the
Noriega regime.''

   Insurgents who have fought the government
for four decades say they are throwing their support behind the
massive anti-government campaign and want to be included in any
interim leadership formed to restore democracy.
   Tens of thousands of demonstrators marched through the streets
of the capital again Friday, demanding the resignation of President
Maung Maung's one-party government. Many gathered later in the day
outside the U.S. Embassy to listen to speeches and songs about
democracy, a Western diplomat said.
   The crowd also chanted slogans demanding an interim
administration be formed to return democracy to this impoverished
Southeast Asian nation, he said.
   ``We support 100 percent the struggles for democracy,'' said
Brang Seng, leader of the Kachin Independence Organization. ``It is
also our aim to replace one-party dictatorship with multiparty
democracy.''
   He said the group supports the demand for an interim government
and opposes the government holding general elections. Brang Seng
spoke Thursday night in a telephone interview from Tokyo.
   ``Inclusion of representatives from the revolutionary forces
(rebels) in the interim government should be considered for future
deliberations for internal peace,'' he said.
   Japan's Kyodo News Service reported the administration pr3 and the
party named hardliner Sein Lwin his successor. Sein Lwin resigned
17 days later after rioting killed at least 112 people in Rangoon.
On Aug. 19, Maung Maung became Burma's first civilian leader since
Nu.

   Most of Britain's postal workers were back on
their jobs Friday sorting a backlog of 150 million pieces of mail
that piled up during a two-week nationwide strike, officials said.
   All but 20,000 of the Post Office's 180,000 employees returned
to work after the strike, which was settled Monday, officials said.
   Most postal employees in Glasgow and in London _ the two cities
that process one-third of British mail _ returned to work late
Thursday.
   Mail was loaded on trains across the country, said Nigel Fitt, a
Post Office spokesman. But he said it will take two weeks to clear
the backlog.
   Fitt said 69 of the country's 82 major sorting offices were
operating Friday, and international mail service also was to resume.
   Members of the Union of Communication Workers staged a 24-hour
walkout on Aug. 31 to protest regional pay bonuses, then stayed off
the job to protest the hiring of temporary workers to handle the
one-day backlog.
   An agreement reached Monday night resolved the bonus issue, but
negotiations at local levels were set up to determine whether
temporary workers would be allowed to sort the mail built up.
   The regional pay dispute concerned bonuses the post office
wanted to pay to new workers in southeast England and in London,
where a high cost of living makes recruitment difficult. The union
said it wanted the bonuses paid nationally or not at all.

   Ariel Sharon of the right-wing Likud bloc has
proposed a ``war game'' to test the rival Labor Party's claim that
Israel could surrender some of the occupied West Bank without
undermining its security.
   The former defense minister issued the challenge in a letter
Thursday to the pro-Labor Council for Peace and Security. His
office released the letter Friday.
   The council, a group of retired military officers, contends
Israel's defense would be enhanced, not compromised, if it
surrendered occupied land in exchange for peace with the Arabs.
   As defense minister, Sharon was the architect of Israel's
much-criticized 1982 invasion of Lebanon, aimed at ending
cross-border attacks from the Arab state.
   In the letter, Sharon proposed a public debate followed by ``a
war game in which we will test, again in public, the different
military strategic concepts concerning the defense of Israel.''
   Sharon, now Israel's commerce minister and a high-ranking member
of Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's Likud bloc, called for the
confrontations before the national elections Nov. 1. ``The public
should see for itself and make its own judgment,'' he said.
   National security and the future of the occupied West Bank and
Gaza Strip have become central issues in the election campaign.
   The executive committee of the Council for Peace and Security
met Friday to consider Sharon's proposal and will respond in the
next several days, said Moshe Amirav, secretary of the group.
   A Sharon aide said that before the war game, research institutes
would be asked to define Arab positions and strengths. Sharon's
team then would ``defend'' Israel from within current boundaries,
including the occupied territories, while the council would have to
``defend'' from a more limited land area.
   The Likud has consistently opposed any land-for-peace plans and
has stressed keeping the territories to strengthen security against
invasion from neighboring Arab states. The leftist Labor Party, led
by Foreign Minister Shimon Peres, has favored compromise.
   Israel has occupied the West Bank and Gaza Strip since the 1967
Middle East war. Palestinians launched an uprising in the
territories Dec. 8 to try to end Israeli rule. Since then more than
260 Palestinians have died, mostly in clashes with Israeli security
forces. Six Israelis also have died.
   Israel Gat, international secretary of the Labor Party, accused
Sharon of preposing ``a David and Goliath show for media purposes.''
   He said if the debate and war game were held, ``Mr. Sharon would
come out empty because his solutions are not well based.''
   Uri Dan, a Sharon aide, said the minister would probably lead
his own team in any debate and mock battles. Dan said Sharon, a
retired major general, sees such activities as a way to take
politics out of the issues.
   Another possible contender in the proposed games would be the
Officers and Academics for Security and Peace, a group of pro-Likud
retired officers organized to counter the activities of the Council
for Peace and Security.
   But Yehoshua Saguy, a founding member of the pro-Likud group,
was cool to the idea of a war game.
   ``A game is a game is a game,'' Saguy said. ``Other elements are
important, such as how to measure the possibilities of coming to
compromise with Jordan or the Palestinians and strategic
questions.''

<HEAD>Newspaper Says It Has Located Girl Who May Be Natural Daughter</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A newspaper has located a girl who
may be the daughter of a couple suing a hospital for $100 million
because, they claim, their healthy newborn was swapped for a sickly
infant 9{ years ago.
   Reporters, using public records, found the blue-eyed girl in the
southwest Florida city where she lives with her father, the St.
Petersburg Times said Friday. She is the only other white girl
reported born at tiny Hardee Memorial Hospital at the time the
plaintiff gave birth, the Times said.
   To protect the child, the paper did not identify her.
   Regina and Ernest Twigg sued in federal court in Tampa last
week, accusing three doctors and a nurse at the Wauchula hospital
of keeping their biological child, a healthy baby born Dec. 2,
1978. The suit contends the Twiggs were instead given a sickly
infant.
   That child, Arlena, died Aug. 23 after a long battle with a
heart problem.
   The Twiggs say blood tests performed at Johns Hopkins Hospital
in Baltimore shortly before Arlena's death prove that the child
they raised was not their biological daughter. They claim personnel
at Hardee Memorial swapped infants in order to give away or sell
the real baby Twigg and then altered the hospital's records to hide
their actions.
   Marvin Ellin, attorney for the Twiggs, said he hopes to locate
the girl found by the newspaper and determine if her blood matches
the Twiggs' O-type blood.
   ``If she's O-positive and shows any family resemblance to the
Twiggs, it's going to be incredible,'' he said.
   ``We would like for the child to know that we in fact did not
give her away,'' Twigg said. ``We would want her to know that we
would like to have her. But if she is happy ... we may feel
differently about it.''
   The girl's family dismisses the idea that she could be the
Twiggs' biological daughter.
   ``My sympathy goes out to those people,'' the girl's father told
the Times. ``They have every right to pursue their real child. (My
daughter) is not their child ... she will never be their child.''
   The Times did not indicate whether the girl was adopted or if
the man's late wife had given birth at Hardee Memorial.
   The man told the newspaper he knew nothing of any baby swap. He
would not disclose his daughter's blood type and said he would
resist attempts to draw the girl into the Twiggs' battle. The girl
knows nothing of the search.
   ``Until they get an indictment or a conviction ... I have
nothing to say,'' he said. ``I'm an innocent bystander.''
   Besides Mrs. Twigg, records show only one other white woman gave
birth to a girl during the two weeks before Mrs. Twigg's discharge
from Hardee Memorial, according to Oliver Boorde, state registrar
for vital statistics.
   The legal mother of that girl died in March 1981 when the child
was 2. Two months after the woman's death, her husband married a
worker he met in the hospital where his wife had been treated. That
marriage ended in divorce last December.
   The girl was immature for her age and had troubles in school,
but was loving, the ex-wife told the Times. ``She lost a mother and
she knew me as a mother for seven years and then lost me. What's
next?'' the woman said.

<HEAD>Bush Attacks Show Weaknesses And Strengths Of Dukakis Economic
Record</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN KING</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   George Bush's assault on Michael Dukakis' fiscal
record renews a debate over statistics that are generally favorable
to Dukakis but show some holes in Massachusetts' economic rebound.
   Bush struck at the heart of Dukakis' candidacy _ his stewardship
of Massachusetts during its economic boom _ with a speech Thursday
that selectively used statistics to point out chinks in the state
financial record but that also gave a misleading characterization
of the state's tax picture.
   ``You can pretty much do what you want with selected
statistics,'' said Betsy Hodeling, spokeswoman for Dukakis'
Department of Revenue. ``If you wanted to call day night you could
probably find a statistic to support that.''
   An obvious example is jobs. Bush cited the state's loss of
26,000 manufacturing jobs since 1983. State officials have put the
number closer to 100,000 but they also cite a net gain of more than
400,000 jobs since 1983.
   Bush said Massachusetts spending increased between 1983 and 1987
at a rate faster than any other state, and that tax increases in
that period were second only to Connecticut.
   Dukakis administration officials did not dispute Bush's
assertion on spending. State budgets have grown by nearly $1
billion a year since 1983, fueled by soaring state revenues. Much
of the increased spending has been in the form of aid to cities and
towns hurt by a voter-approved property tax cap and the Reagan
administration's decision to halt revenue sharing with
municipalities.
   On the tax side, however, administration officials denounced
Bush's figures, which do not take into account the record increase
in per-capita income in Massachusetts over the four-year period the
vice president cited.
   During that period state taxes have been cut several times,
including the repeal of a surtax Dukakis authored in 1975, his
first year as governor. Dukakis initially opposed most of the tax
cuts.
   ``(Bush) chose the per capita figures because they appear to
show that taxes went up,'' said Hodeling. ``What they fail to show
is that people here are making a lot more money so of course they
are paying more taxes. Percentage-wise, taxes have been cut.''
   Bush cited the surtax to support his position that Dukakis was
the biggest tax raiser in Massachusetts history; Dukakis sought the
increase to erase a $600 million deficit inherited from his
Republican predecessor.
   ``There are probably a zillion ways to measure taxes,'' said
House Republican Leader Steven Pierce, who met with Bush in July to
discuss state finances. ``In any political campaign you have
charges and countercharges and statistics can be used to support a
variety of things.''
   The vice president chided Dukakis for approving $7.4 billion in
long-term borrowing for capital projects during his tenure and for
not fully funding the state's pension system.
   However, Wall Street's two major bond rating agencies recently
termed Massachusetts' long-term debt moderate compared to many
states and said its economy appeared strong enough to support the
debt. And it was Dukakis who last year convinced the Legislature to
pass a plan to fund the pension system, an effort which he had made
a priority in his second and third terms. Dukakis did tap into
surplus pension funds this year to help offset a $450 million
revenue shortfall.
   Bush also asserted that Dukakis has turned a state surplus into
a deficit that could grow to $700 million by the end of the current
fiscal year.
   Dukakis last year won passage of about $180 million in new taxes
and cut state spending by more than $200 million to end fiscal 1988
with a $67 million surplus and to support revenue projections in
the current budget.
   Many legislators, most of them Republicans, have predicted the
state will fall short of money again this year but even Dukakis'
harshest critics say it is too early to make a credible assessment.
   ``I personally think $700 million is a reasonable estimate but
you can't prove it,'' said Barbara Anderson, executive director of
Citizens for Limited Taxation and a Dukakis enemy. ``Nobody can
prove it. But candidates snipe at each other.''
   Dukakis has stood behind his revenue projections but has
promised to cut spending if necessary.
   He was forced into that position last year and the state has had
to borrow on a short-term basis for the first time since 1980,
issuing more than $1 billion in notes in the past eight months to
pay its bills. That will cost taxpayers about $20 million in
interest payments.

   Two British reporters said Friday that Chinese
police in a northwestern province punched them and struck them with
electric cattle prods before they expelled them from the region.
   Timothy Luard of the British Broadcasting Corp. and Andrew
Higgins of The Independent, both based in Beijing, said police
detained them Monday when they arrived at the airport in Kashgar.
   The city is in far northwestern China's Xinjiang province.
Rumors have been circulating in recent weeks in Beijing about
ethnic unrest in the region, home to a Turkish minority.
   Police accused the journalists of failing to get permission to
visit the region, Luard said after arriving in Beijing Friday. He
and Higgins denied the charge.
   Police confiscated their passports and film and struck them on
two occasions before putting them on a plane out of Kashar on
Thursday morning, Luard said.
   He said the chief of the Kashgar police Foreign Affairs Section
threw him against a wall and punched him in the chest when the two
reporters objected to efforts by police to mount a 24-hour watch
inside the room where they were held.
   He said another police officer dragged Higgins into the room,
ripping his trousers.
   On Tuesday, police struck the pair with electric cattle prods
when they tried to walk down a street away from the building where
they were kept, Luard said. Police also hit several foreign
tourists who tried to intervene, he said.
   The government did not immediately comment on the journalists'
charges.
   Luard said he and Higgins had applied to Xinjiang authorities
the required 10 days in advance for permission to visit the region.
   He said authorities in Xinjiang's capital of Urumchi, where they
conducted interviews, knew of their plans to go on to Kashgar and
did not object.
   China's domestic media is state-run and the government maintains
tight control over the movements of foreign journalists. In June,
police in a village near Beijing threw out two reporters working
for the British news agency Reuters who tried to cover a peasant
protest against water pollution in their area.
   In the past two years, China has expelled three foreign
reporters from the country.

   The Vietnamese government has agreed to a
joint effort to find the remains of U.S. servicemen missing in
action during the Vietnam War, the administration announced Friday.
   U.S. officials said the investigation will focus on seven cases
in which there is evidence that the victims were alive at the time
they came under Vietnamese custody.
   At the State Department, spokesman Charles Redman said the seven
are part of the 70 ``most compelling cases'' which U.S. officials
raised with Vietnamese authorities last year.
   Other officials said that that although the 70 were presumed to
be alive when captured, all have long since been presumed dead
because there is no evidence to prove otherwise.
   A 90-day period, beginning Sept. 1, was set aside for carrying
out the investigations, Redman said, with each one limited to 10
days.
   About 2,400 U.S. servicemen have been listed as missing in
action in Southeast Asia.
   Defense Secretary Frank Carlucci announced the agreement with
Vietnam during a POW-MIA Recognition Day ceremony on Capitol Hill.
   House Republican Leader Robert Michel of Illinois urged the
families of the missing Americans to ignore the rumors that will be
inevitable during the pending search.
   ``We have to continue to press for an accounting of each and
every one, even though the prospects of finding anyone alive
diminish with the passing of time,'' Michel told the crowd of
several hundred.
   ``We must continue to seek the truth,'' he said. ``But the two
greatest enemies of truth are rumors and false hopes. Nothing could
be more cruel to the families of MIAs and POWs than to lend
credence to false rumors, to raise hopes without the facts to
support them, to muddy the waters and confuse the issue.''
   Carlucci said he was encouraged by recent agreements between
Vietnamese Vice Premier Nguyen Co Thach and President Reagan's
special POW-MIA emissary to Hanoi, Gen. John W. Vessey Jr.
   ``Although last month Vietnam temporarily suspended its offer to
conduct joint operations, it recently agreed to resume cooperation,
and I am pleased to announce that joint activity will begin on
Sept. 25,'' the secretary said.
   Laos has agreed to similar efforts, ``but we still await the
results that we know are possible from those who hold the
answers,'' he said.
   Carlucci called on Cambodia to repatriate remains it claims to
hold and criticized the government of North Korea for failure to
return those of United Nations forces missing in the Korean War.
   ``The North Koreans have a golden opportunity this year to
display their willingness to rejoin the real world by dealing in
good faith through the proper channels on this vital human issue,''
said Senate Republican Leader Bob Dole of Kansas, who joined
Carlucci and Michel in addressing the crowd.
   ``Let's hope that when we meet again next year, we can report
real progress and real results,'' Dole said. ``The bottom line is:
We'll never forget, and we'll never give up.''
   As part of the day of remembrance, wreath-laying ceremonies were
being held at the Arlington National Cemetery in honor of POWs and
MIAs from the Korean War.
   An organization dedicated to remembering the families of missing
soldiers, No Greater Love, estimates that there are 8,100 MIAs and
389 POWs still unaccounted for in Korea.
   An estimated 79,000 U.S. servicemen were missing in action in
World War II.

Murders</HEAD>

   Liberace's ex-lover provided some of the new
evidence tying a Hollywood drug dealer to the 1981 Laurel Canyon
slayings, for which the late sex-film star John Holmes once was
tried, the Los Angeles Times reported Friday.
   Scott Thorson, 29, who was Liberace's companion from 1977 to
1982, helped authorities build their case against nightclub owner
and convicted cocaine trafficker Adel Nasrallah in the four Laurel
Canyon beating deaths, the Times said, citing unidentified sources.
   The killings allegedly were in revenge for a cash and drug
robbery of Nasrallah, authorities have said, and Holmes admitted
bringing the assailants to the Laurel Canyon home.
   Holmes, like Liberace, died of acquired immune deficiency
syndrome.
   Nasrallah, 59, who went by the name Eddie Nash, and former
bodyguard Gregory DeWitt Diles, 40, were charged Sept. 8 with four
counts of murder and one of attempted murder. They are being held
without bail and face possible death penalties if convicted.
   Four people were bludgeoned to death during the nighttime attack
in the affluent residential neighborhood and a fifth was left for
dead. She survived but was unable to identify her attackers.
   Deputy District Attorney Dale Davidson, who is prosecuting Nash
and Diles, said Friday that authorities have new witnesses in the
case, but would neither confirm nor deny Thorson's involvement.
   ``And right now I'm most interested in protecting my witnesses
and avoiding anything that might prejudice the case against Mr.
Nash and Mr. Diles, so I can't ethically say anything one way or
another,'' the prosecutor said.
   Nash and Diles were scheduled to name attorneys and enter pleas
in a court appearance Monday, at which time the prosecution will
provide a list of its witnesses and an outline of its case, he said.
   ``The names of the witnesses will be out before long, but it
would be wrong for me to be the first one to give them out,''
Davidson said.
   Thorson, who sued Liberace for more than $12 million and wrote a
kiss-and-tell book about their relationship, remained in jail
Friday awaiting sentencing for a drug-related armed robbery.
Telephone messages left for his lawyer, Deputy Public Defender
Cathy Dreyfuss, were not returned.
   Holmes, a heavy cocaine user, was the top pornographic film star
of the '70s, often portraying a detective named Johnny Wadd. During
his 1982 trial, witnesses testified that Holmes fenced property
stolen by the murder victims to Nash, who exchanged them for
cocaine.
   A police detective testified that Holmes admitted taking killers
to the house the night of July 1, 1981, to placate Nash, who
allegedly was angry after being robbed of drugs and $10,000 by two
of the victims two days before.
   The robbery was allegedly Holmes' idea. And investigators
contended the victims allowed the killers inside the house about 10
miles west of downtown Los Angeles because Holmes was with them.
   Holmes never took the stand and was acquitted. He was later
jailed for 111 days for contempt of court for refusing to talk to a
grand jury. He agreed to testify before the secret panel in
November 1982 after Nash was sentenced to prison for possessing
about two pounds of cocaine valued at $1 million.
   Holmes' grand jury testimony remains sealed, and Davidson said
it can't be used against Nash or Diles.
   The sex-film star died of AIDS complications in March, after
reportedly granting deathbed interviews to police still
investigating the killings. However, his statements apparently
yielded little of use to authorities, and Davidson said the
evidence used to file the new charges didn't come from Holmes.
   Nash, who ran a chain of strip-joints and punk nightclubs,
supplied Thorson with cocaine, the Times said.
   In an acknowledgment in his recently published book, ``Behind
the Candelabra: My Life With Liberace,'' Thorson named Nash as one
of six people who, over the years, offered him ``personal support
and understanding.''
   Thorson filed two highly publicized lawsuits against Liberace
contending the flamboyant entertainer reneged on promises to
support him for the rest of his life and libeled him by having
relatives publish a magazine article calling him a blackmailer.
   The first suit was settled out of court for $95,000, and the
other was dismissed shortly after Liberace died of AIDS in 1987.
   Bludgeoned to death in the Laurel Canyon slayings were Roy
DeVerell, 42, Joy Audrey Miller 46, Barbara Richardson, 22, and
Ronald Launius, 37. Launius' wife Susan, then 25, was badly beaten
but survived the attack.

<HEAD>Three Generations Of Wyeth Family Art Comes Home</HEAD>

<DATELINE>CHADDS FORD, Pa. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An exhibit of three generations of Wyeth
family art was staged in palaces and ultramodern museums during its
world tour, but James Wyeth says the works look best hanging in his
hometown.
   The exhibition of 115 works by N.C. Wyeth, his son Andrew and
his grandson James opens Sunday in Brandywine River Museum in
Chadds Ford. It is the final stop of a 1{-year tour that also
included stops in the Soviet Union, Italy, Japan and England.
   James until recently has answered to the family nickname of
Jamie. But he now wants to be known as James.
   Speaking at a press preview Friday, he said, ``I've seen the
paintings hanging in a czarist building in Moscow ... in a
ultramodern museum in Tokyo ... in an old-style building in
Cambridge (England), but it still looks a hell of a lot better here
at home.''
   Chadds Ford, southwest of Philadelphia, is where N.C. Wyeth
settled after traveling through the Old West during the late 1800s
and early 1900s. Andrew and James were raised here, and many of
their works explore the people and surroundings.
   Other works examine the people and atmosphere of Maine, where
the family has a second home.
   The most celebrated Wyeth, 71-year-old Andrew, was scheduled to
attend the press preview, but a touch of the flu and a ``drained''
feeling he gets when he completes a work caused him to stay away
Friday, his son said.
   Through the worldwide tour, people flocked to the exhibit in
record-breaking numbers to get a glimpse of art that explores such
American traditions and lifestyles as farming and Halloween.
   But the collection also shows the enduring tradition of an
artistic family, and James Wyeth said that is what appealed most to
the exhibit's audiences abroad.
   ``It was the continuity that really struck them,'' he said.
   The exhibit opened in Leningrad in March 1987 and was the first
exhibit under the newest cultural exchange program between the
United States and the Soviet Union.
   ``The people were really dying to see the art,'' he said. ``At
some openings, people just stand around with their backs to the
paintings, but there they were almost pushing me aside to see the
paintings.''
   Included in the exhibit are three of Andrew Wyeth famous
``Helga'' paintings, a series of nudes and other figure studies of
the same woman that caused a sensation when its existence was
disclosed two years ago.
   When asked if he had any secret paintings, James Wyeth laughed.
``Yes, of a lot of pigs,'' he said.
   He posed for photographs before one of his more famous works,
Portrait of a Pig, a 4-by-7-foot painting done in 1970. The pig is
one of his favorite subjects and the exhibit displays several
paintings of other farm animals as well.
   The first portion of the exhibit displays N.C. Wyeth's art.
Although there are several paintings of Western scenes and a small
self-portrait from 1913, the majority of the 38 works on display
are book illustrations.
   N.C. Wyeth, who died in 1945, illustrated such classics as
Robert Louis Stevenson's ``Treasure Island'' and ``Kidnapped,'' and
Mark Twain's ``The Mysterious Stranger'' in the 1910s and 1920s.
   The exhibit runs through Nov. 20.

<HEAD>Detroit Newspapers Deal Stalled For Second Time</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Detroit newspaper urged a federal appeals
court Friday to lift an order that for a second time stalled its
plans to combine business and production departments with a larger
rival.
   Attorneys for the Detroit Free Press asked the U.S. Court of
Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit to allow the agreement
to go forward, saying ``entry into a (joint operating agreement) is
by its nature an emergency remedy.''
   The court late Thursday barred the joint operations from
beginning after the expiration at 7:15 p.m. Saturday of a
lower-court stay. The superseding order carried no expiration date.
   The appeals court ordered the delay to gain time to study the
complex case, the court clerk's office said. The court gave no
indication when a ruling might come.
   Michigan Citizens for an Independent Press, a group of
advertisers and readers opposed to the newspapers' joint operating
agreement, had asked for a delay in implementing the joint
operating agreement. The court declined to grant the group's
request, but on its own authority issued a stay.
   The general manager of the Free Press, Bob Hall, said the stay
``just gives the judges a couple of days to look at the filings''
and has no bearing on the merits of the case.
   The partial merger under the Newspaper Preservation Act,
requested by the newspapers in 1986, was approved last month by
then-Attorney General Edwin Meese III.
   Michigan Citizens succeeded in blocking immediate implementation
of the agreement through a challenge in U.S. District Court in
Washington.
   The lower court on Wednesday rejected the challenge, and
Michigan Citizens the next day asked the appeals court to consider
the case.
   Free Press attorneys said Michigan Citizens' had failed to show
they were likely to succeed in an appeal or that denial of the stay
would cause permanent damage.
   Michigan Citizens contends the joint operating agreement would
set a precedent because it would allow a merger in a case where the
newspapers' financial losses were due to management decisions
rather than the normal competition in the marketplace.
   The group said such a precedent could end newspaper competition
in 20 cities served by multiple newspapers.
   The organization argued that the lower court, in granting a
stay, had accepted the premise that allowing the partial merger to
proceed while under challenge would be contrary to the public
interest.
   The Free Press, owned by Knight-Ridder Inc., had a daily
circulation last year of 638,720; the News, owned by Gannett Co.
Inc., had circulation of 678,720, according to the Audit Bureau of
Circulation.
   Knight-Ridder has said it will close the Free Press if the joint
operating agreement does not go through, at a cost of 2,000 jobs.
The merger of the newspapers' business, advertising, circulation
and production departments would result in the loss at both
newspapers of 600 to 800 jobs.

<TEXT>
   A transient suspected of accidentally
igniting a fire that destroyed 102 homes has been charged in the
blaze.
   Gary Wayne Parris, 39, appeared in Nevada County court Thursday
on a charge of felony count of reckless burning. He is also charged
with public drunkenness. He was being held Friday on $50,000 bail.
   Parris was at first charged with a misdemeanor count, but the
charge was upgraded because of evidence of ``willful and wanton''
disregard of the fire danger, according to District Attorney John
Darlington.
   Parris apparently lived in an abandoned home in a remote area
near Nevada City, about 50 miles northeast of Sacramento.
   The state Department of Forestry encouraged the district
attorney to file the more serious charges to get Parris off the
street for his own safety and so he can receive psychological help,
said chief ranger Robert Paulus.
   Some residents have expressed anger towards Parris, who police
say started the huge blaze Sunday by burning toilet paper outside a
makeshift outhouse.
   The fire destroyed 102 homes and 57 outbuildings, according to
state Department of Forestry spokeswoman Karen Terrill. So far, the
economic toll has risen beyond $15 million, including $11 million
in property damage and $4.2 million in suppression costs. The fire
was fully contained on Thursday.

<TEXT>
   Pope John Paul II urged the Marxist
government Friday to make peace with guerrillas and offered to let
the church mediate in this war-torn country, where 6 million people
live on the edge of famine.
   ``In the face of this lamentable situation, when the opportunity
arose, I have never ceased to repeat, `No to violence and yes to
peace,''' the pontiff told President Joaquim Chissano after
arriving from neighboring Swaziland.
   ``The efforts of my brother bishops in Mozambique have always
received my backing,'' John Paul told Chissano, who was baptized a
Roman Catholic but now is non-practicing. About one-eighth of
Mozambique's 11.7 million people are Catholic.
   The bishops have been urging Chissano's government to start
negotiations with anti-Marxist rebels of the Mozambique National
Resistance, known by their Portuguese acronym, Renamo. The
government has refused to negotiate and has criticized the bishops
for advocating talk with ``armed bandits.''
   ``The weapons we are still obliged to carry are used exclusively
to defend our country's freedom and our nation,'' Chissano told the
pope at the Ponte Vermelha (Red Point) palace, built by the
Portuguese colonialists before Mozambique became independent in
1975.
   ``Your holiness proclaims the path of peace and denounces the
paths of hatred, the trade of war, the murder of innocents and the
inadmissable methods of terrorism,'' Chissano said.
   The 11-year-old civil war in this southeast African country has
forced about 1 million Mozambicans to flee into neighboring
countries. Nearly half Mozambique's 14.5 million people are in need
of food aid, according to relief organizations.
   Mozambique is the final stop on the pope's 10-day tour of
southern Africa. In addition to Swaziland, he also has visited
Zimbabwe, Botswana and Lesotho and made a brief unscheduled stop in
South Africa on Wednesday after his plane was diverted in bad
weather.
   The Renamo guerrillas, believed to number between 12,000 and
22,000, roam the countryside almost at will and have caused
tremendous econonic damage.
   No government acknowledges assisting the rebels, who have been
accused of widespread civilian atrocities. Renamo denies the
charges.
   The U.S. State Department, in a report released in April,
estimated the rebels killed 100,000 civilians in the past two to
three years.
   Renamo this week announced a cease-fire during the pope's visit
and wished the pontiff a good stay. Still, Mozambique announced
extensive security measures for the pope and the pilgrims traveling
to see him at stops in Nampula, Beira and Maputo, the capital.
   Mozambique receives most of its military assistance from the
Soviet Union but increasingly has been making overtures to Western
nations. The United States is the largest donor of food aid in
Mozambique, and Britain has been providing military training.
   Mozambique also has been working to improve relations with
neighboring South Africa, which has backed Renamo in the past.
South Africa says it stopped supporting the guerrillas under terms
of a 1984 mutual non-aggression pact, but Mozambique has continued
to accuse South Africa of providing assistance.
   Mozambique regularly refers to South Africa as the ``racist
regime,'' but on Monday Chissano hosted South African President
P.W. Botha on his first summit meeting in a black-ruled African
nation.
   The Vatican has tried to prod the peace process in Mozambique by
sending one of John Paul's top cardinal aides to meet separately
with Botha and Chissano in July. Also, some Mozambican bishops
reportedly have maintained contacts with Renamo.
   Chissano met the pope in May in Rome, but the Vactican appears
to be holding off the establishment of diplomatic relations as an
incentive to move the peace process ahead.
   In Mbabane, Swaziland, earlier Friday, the pope preached about
the virtues of monogamy at a Mass attended by Swaziland's
20-year-old king and his four wives.
   King Mswati III, the world's youngest monarch, sat
expressionless as the pope told a crowd of 10,000 at the capital's
national stadium that God intended each husband to have one wife.
   The pope, who arrived at the stadium in his popemobile escorted
by spear-carrying warriors, spoke from an altar topped by a turret
manned by a soldier with a rifle and binoculars.

<HEAD>Louisiana Coastal Residents Homeward Bound As Gilbert Heads For
Mexico</HEAD>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LAKE CHARLES, La. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Thousands of Louisiana coastal
residents headed back to their deserted homes Friday after
Hurricane Gilbert barreled away from the Bayou State and toward
northeastern Mexico.
   ``It feels good to go home,'' said evacuee Fred Racca, a Cameron
Parish resident who spent Thursday night at an evacuation center in
a Lake Charles high school gym. He balanced a mattress on his head
while he walked out with his wife and three children.
   Cameron Parish civil defense director Hayes Picou gave
permission for his area's 10,000 residents to return home after
deciding that the danger for Louisiana was almost over.
   ``We're still monitoring the situation, but we think it's clear
enough for everyone to come home,'' Picou said.
   Other parishes followed Cameron's lead as the day progressed.
   But Andy Valence, mayor of the barrier island community of Grand
Isle, on a remote spit of land exposed to the Gulf of Mexico,
warned the 2,000 residents under his jurisdiction to stay away.
   Tides churned by Gilbert threatened to swamp the only road to
the mainland by Saturday morning, Valence said. And anyone who
returned to the island would be trapped if the storm headed back to
the Gulf and turned toward Louisiana.
   Scattered thunderstorms, wind gusts of up to 25 mph and tides
three to four feet above normal buffeted Louisiana's coast Friday
afternoon, but Bill Crouch of the National Weather Service said
that would be the extent of the bad weather if the storm's path
held.
   ``I think they are getting right now the worst they can
expect,'' said Crouch.
   Still, Gilbert exacted a toll on Louisiana and its people.
   Oil production in the Gulf was shut down for days because
offshore workers had to abandon rigs _ first for last week's
Hurricane Florence, then for Gilbert.
   Also, commercial shrimpers and fishermen had to abandon the Gulf
and inland waterways.
   At Grand Isle, Valence worried about severe coastal erosion that
began with Florence and continued with Gilbert. As much as 60 feet
of beach had washed away by Friday in some areas, he said.
   In Lafayette, Gilbert postponed the lucrative Festival Acadiens,
a world renowned celebration of Cajun culture and music that draws
thousands each year. The festival was moved to the first weekend in
October.

   Pope John Paul II preached about the
virtues of monogamy Friday at a Mass attended by the 20-year-old
king and his four wives.
   King Mswati III, the world's youngest monarch, sat
expressionless as the pope said God intended each husband to have
one wife.
   The pope arrived at the capital's national stadium in his
popemobile escorted by spear-carrying warriors. He spoke from an
altar topped by a turret holding a soldier with a rifle and
binoculars. A cross on the structure was stamped with a spear,
shield and war ax.
   ``Christians find that a monogamous marital union provides the
foundation upon which to build a stable family in accordance with
the original plan of God for marriage,'' the pope told a crowd of
about 10,000 in the national stadium.
   ``Hence, any forms of disregard for the equal dignity of men and
women must be seen as serious contradiction of the truth that
Christ, the king of peace, brought into the world,'' he said.
   Vatican sources said John Paul was warned by local prelates to
tread carefully before addressing the issue of polygamy, but he
went ahead anyway.
   An estimated 70,000 of Swaziland's people _ roughly 10 percent
of the population _ are Catholics, but the king is not one of them.
   Mswati has never issued any statement on his religious beliefs.
His father supported freedom of religion and said he was a member
of all religions. Mswati is believed to follow in the same
tradition, but that has never been confirmed.
   Later Friday, the pope went on to Mozambique, the last stop on a
10-day visit of southern Africa that also included Zimbabwe,
Botswana and Lesotho. He urged Mozambique's Marxist government to
negotiate with rightist rebels.
   Swaziland, a stable country of 700,000 people wedged between
South Africa and Mozambique, is a dual monarchy under the king,
offically known as the Lion, and a queen mother called the Great
She Elephant.
   Polygamy is no longer practiced extensively in Swaziland, but it
is a tradition in the royal family.
   Mswati's father, King Sobhuza II, had more than 50 wives and at
least 68 children during his 60-year reign, which ended with his
death in 1982.
   Also attending the Mass were the queen mother and the former
queen regent who briefly ruled the country after Sobhuza's death.
   The Mass was unusual from the start. John Paul's open-topped
popemobile was driven in the wrong direction after it circled once
around the track at the stadium. The warrior escorts and Vatican
security men expressed dismay when the popemobile started driving
out the gate.
   After driving back into the stadium, the pope slipped off a
platform onto the soggy field and climbed back onto the altar.
   Then his celebration of the Mass was interrupted by the arrival
of the young king, who rolled into the stadium in a Lincoln
limousine to welcoming whistles from the crowd.
   Later, the pope was kept waiting for 20 minutes inside his
Mercedes at the doors of royal palace until the king's limousine
was moved from the driveway.
   After the delay, John Paul chatted with the king and other
members of the royal family for 10 minutes. The meeting had been
scheduled for 30 minutes.
   As they spoke and exchanged gifts inside the palace, security
men crawled on the floor in order not to disturb the view of the
king and the pope.
   During his three other African trips, John Paul frequently
condemned polygamy, marital infidelity and promiscuity.
   President Mobutu Sese Seko of Zaire was hurriedly married a few
days before the pope visited in 1980.

<HEAD>Democrats Hope Primary Victories Mean Elections in November</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOEL STASHENKO</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two of the state's leading Democrats won
renomination even though they were brushed by scandal, but voters
took the advice of a third Democrat who resigned his post after a
criminal conviction and said he did not want to be nominated.
   Among the winners in Thursday's primaries were every Democratic
incumbent in Congress and in the state Legislature who had sought
re-election.
   Five-term Bronx Congressman Robert Garcia, who was tied to the
Wedtech influence peddling scandal but has not been charged with
criminal wrongdoing; and state Senate Minority Leader Manfred
Ohrenstein of Manhattan, who has been charged in a criminal
indictment with doling out public money for private campaigns, both
survived primary challenges.
   A former incumbent, Rep. Mario Biaggi, did lose to state
Assemblyman Eliot Engel in a three-way race for the Democratic
nomination for Biaggi's old congressional seat.
   Biaggi had resigned from Congress in August after his conviction
in the Wedtech scandal and said he didn't want to be designated as
his party's nominee. Ironically, though, he will still be on the
November ballot, because the once-popular politician received the
GOP nomination with no primary opposition.
   There were no primary races in the only major statewide office
up this year _ the U.S. Senate seat held by Democrat Daniel Patrick
Moynihan. His GOP challenger in November will be lawyer Robert
McMillan.
   All of Thursday's Democratic incumbent winners in New York City
are virtually assured of victory in the general election in the
heavily Democratic city.
   John Marino, executive director of the state Democratic
Committee, said state party leaders are now focusing on suburban
and upstate congressional races where Democratic winners Thursday
face tough contests for seats now held by Republicans.
   ``What they have to do now is build upon the momentum that they
created for themselves and let that take them into Nov. 8,'' he
said.
   The seats include the one held by Rep. Jack Kemp, who opted not
to seek re-election in order to made a bid for the GOP presidential
nomination.
   The Wedtech scandal, in which Biaggi was convicted and Garcia
was implicated, involves a now-bankrupt Bronx defense contractor
whose officials allegedly bribed a number of local and federal
officials.
   Ohrenstein, who's been in the state Senate since 1960, faces
nearly a 400-count indictment in Manhattan charging that he misused
public funds to finance the private campaigns of Senate Democratic
candidates in 1986.
   Ohrenstein narrowly repulsed a primary challenge from Joseph
Rose, 29, the son of a wealthy developer who outspent Ohrenstein by
a 3-to-1 margin.
   The drawing power of one famous political name fell short in
suburban Westchester County, as former state official Nita Lowey
defeated Hamilton Fish III and a third candidate for the right to
oppose Republican Rep. Joseph DioGuardi in November.
   Fish's father, Hamilton Fish Jr., a Republican, represents a
neighboring district in Congress that had previously been
represented by his father, also named Hamilton Fish.

   Cattle being fed for the slaughter market as
of Sept. 1 in the seven major beef states totaled 6.67 million
head, down 2 percent from a year ago but 4 percent more than
inventories of two years ago, the Agriculture Department said
Friday.
   The placement of new cattle and calves in fattening pens last
month was reported at 1.62 million head, down 16 percent from a
year ago and down 10 percent from two years ago.
   Marketings of ``fed'' cattle in August totaled 1.72 million
head, the same as a year ago but up 4 percent from two years ago.
   As of Sept. 1, feedlot inventories were larger than a year
earlier in California, Colorado, Kansas and Nebraska but were less
in Arizona, Iowa and Texas. The seven states produce about
three-fourths of the nation's beef.
   State feedlot cattle inventories are listed here for the seven
states. The first number is the number of cattle, in thousands, as
of Sept. 1, and the second number is the percentage of a year
earlier.

   President Reagan and NATO's new Secretary
General Manfred Woerner on Friday discussed the thorny problem of
sharing the alliances's costs and burdens, an issue one top aide
said is at ``the top of the list'' for the pact's members.
   ``I feel confident this alliance has the strength, courage and
imagination to overcome our difficulties,'' Woerner told reporters
after he emerged from his half-hour meeting and hour-long lunch
with the president in the White House.
   ``The president mentioned the American interest ... of his
administration, of Congress, in a more equitable burden-sharing and
I told him that the alliance takes this issue very seriously. We
are working at it,'' Woerner said.
   A chorus of election-year unhappiness has been voiced in
Congress due to the disproportionate share the United States bears
for forces in allied nations, whose post-World War II economies
have boomed and whose companies now compete on the international
stage with American firms.
   As a message to the allies, the Senate overwhelmingly approved a
Pentagon spending bill last month that included restrictions on
spending for American troops overseas. Under the plan in the bill,
U.S. allies would have to pay for the American troops if the cost
rises above the 1988 level.
   Woerner, who said he was optimistic about the future of the
North Atlantic Treaty Organization, said he believed the alliance
will make progress on the cost issue. But he also warned that the
question can't be reduced to financial considerations alone.
   ``We shouldn't treat it in a controversial way, we should look
at it as an alliance task,'' he said. ``It's not a confrontation
between the United States and the rest of the alliance. It's a
common task of NATO as an organization and an alliance.''
   Assistant Secretary of State Rozanne Ridgway, who briefed
reporters following Woerner's visit, said of the burden-sharing
question that ``everyone agrees that it's a subject that has to be
at the top of the list.''
   She noted that Woerner, during his meetings earlier this week
with Secretary of State George P. Shultz and Secretary of Defense
Frank C. Carlucci has ``given it his personal priority.''
   ``On both sides of this conversation (there is) a conviction
that this discussion has to be an intra-alliance discussion, that
it cannot become an us-vs.-them, a U.S.-vs.-all-others kind of
discussion,'' Mrs. Ridgway said.
   The State Department official said Woerner and Reagan did not
discuss the topic in great detail, but she added that Woerner is
``pressing ahead'' with a study of the issue.
   The official said that the NATO visitors did report that they
were ``struck'' by the attention the issue is receiving in the
United States. ``It is the kind of question (that) if non-examined,
can become divisive and no one wants that to happen,'' Mrs. Ridgway
said.

   The owners of a hotel extensively damaged
when an Air Force jet crashed into it last October, killing 10
people, have reached a $4 million settlement with their insurance
company, it was announced Friday.
   Shelby Insurance Co. of Shelby, Ohio, agreed to the payment of
the Airport Ramada Inn's claim. Representatives of both the
insurance company and the hotel said they plan to sue the Air Force.
   Sam Saini, principal owner of the hotel near Indianapolis
International Airport, has estimated damages, including the loss of
business income, at $9.5 million.
   The hotel, its north side still showing the smoke stains and
damage from the Oct. 20 crash, has not reopened.
   Officials of the insurance company said Shelby likely will file
suit against the Air Force to recover money paid to the hotel
owners in the settlement.
   The A-7D Corsair, returning to Nellis Air Force Base, Nev.,
crashed after its engine flamed out and it overshot the nearby
airport during an emergency landing attempt. The pilot, Maj. Bruce
Teagarden, ejected safely just before the plane hit the building.
   Teagarden was about 800 feet above the ground when he broke out
of clouds and began searching for an area to eject, according to an
Air Force report in January.
   He saw a pie-shaped field, aimed the plane at it and ejected
while about 300 feet above the ground.
   The jet then veered to the right and hit a bank building before
bouncing into the street and slamming into the Ramada Inn, causing
a deadly fireball.

   Former U.S. Sen. Alan Bible was remembered
Friday as a giant in Congress whose quiet work helped preserve the
nation's natural resources.
   ``There is not an area in this country that has not benefited
from Alan Bible,'' former Gov. Mike O'Callaghan said in a eulogy to
350 people that included Nevada's top government and business
leaders.
   ``There is hardly a state in the union that does not owe a debt
of gratitude to this quiet Senator. Our friend Alan Bible was a
quiet man who left a record that has seldom been matched.''
   Bible, a Democrat, sponsored legislation in the Senate that set
up the nation's first protection acts for parks, water, air,
wildlife and historical sites, including the Grand Canyon.
   A major force in Nevada politics for more than 40 years, Bible
died Monday at a hospital in Auburn, Calif., of complications from
a respiratory illness. He was 78.
   Born in the rural northern Nevada community of Lovelock, Bible
was a member of the Senate for 20 years after serving in several
state public service positions. He retired from the Senate in 1974.
   ``I got the greatest pleasure out of trying to help people,''
Bible once said. ``There can be no greater reward in life.''
   Bible graduated from the University of Nevada-Reno in 1930 and
he received a law degree from Georgetown University in 1934.
   He was elected Storey County district attorney in 1938 and state
attorney general in 1942. After he retired from the Senate, he
returned to the University of Nevada-Reno to teach political
science for eight years.
   While in Congress, Bible cast the deciding Senate vote to
override President Nixon's veto of the Clear Water Act.
   Bible was also well known for his efforts to secure Nevada's
share of Colorado River water and to build pumping stations to
bring it into Las Vegas. Bible is survived by his wife, Loucile;
daughter, Debra; sons Paul, William and David; and seven
grandchildren.

<TEXT>
   A political director of the Nicaraguan Contras
said Friday he hoped the rebels will reach agreement within the
next three weeks on a long-term peace accord with the leftist
Managua government.
   But even if the talks do not succeed, said directorate member
Alfredo Cesar, the militarily weakened rebels will have captured
the moral high ground by demonstrating their willingness to seek
peace.
   ``There is the perception that the negotiation process is
stalled and that the resistance has not done everything possible''
to keep it on track, Cesar told reporters after meeting with
congressional leaders. The Contras have been blamed for the breakup
of peace talks June 9.
   The new rebel initiative means both Congress and the new
administration taking office in January ``will definitely have
found that we went the extra mile,'' he said.
   ``Taking the decision to go back (into talks with the Sandinista
government) without military aid is a very extraordinary gesture of
good faith on the part of the resistance,'' Cesar said.
   The Contras, formally known as the Nicaraguan Resistance,
announced on Thursday that they would send a delegation to
preliminary talks in Guatemala City on Monday aimed at a resumption
of the peace talks.
   Cesar said they will offer to begin formal, high-level peace
talks Sept. 26-28 in Guatemala, Costa Rica or the Dominican
Republic.
   The rebels say they will place no preconditions on the talks,
but will ask that the Sandinistas release 39 people jailed July 10
after an anti-government demonstration in Nandaime, a town near
Managua.
   Col. Enrique Bermudez, the rebels' military commander and a
newly elected directorate member, said the prisoner release would
``create a good climate for the negotiations.''
   In separate meetings with House Speaker Jim Wright, D-Texas, and
Minority Leader Robert Michel, R-Ill., members of the rebel
directorate said they hoped to reach an agreement that would let
their troops, most of which have been withdrawn from Nicaragua into
camps along the Honduran border, relocate in previously designated
cease-fire zones inside Nicaragua.
   They also said they wanted to establish goals for democratic
reforms to be implemented in Nicaragua and promised that, ``with
these reforms undertaken,'' they would lay down their arms.
   In a letter to congressional leaders, the rebels asked that a
$27 million humanitarian aid package now pending as part of a
disputed Pentagon money bill be modified to permit training for
Contra soldiers in ``human rights, hygiene, leadership skills and
political education;'' civic action to aid civilians affected by
the war, including medical supplies and ``basic work tools;''
communications gear to maintain contact with troops in the field;
and unspecified ``equipment needed to preserve ... physical
safety'' for troops en route to cease-fire zones.
   Rep. David Bonior, D-Mich., a leading Contra opponent, said it
was unlikely the aid package would be modified. ``It's a delicate
compromise'' reached after three weeks of negotiations among Senate
Democrats, he said, adding, ``I'm very skeptical of people's
motives.''

   Federal regulators opened an investigation
into reports that defective seats on more than 3 million Chrysler
and Nissan vehicles can cause drivers to lose control, the National
Highway Traffic Safety Administration said Friday.
   The agency also opened 10 other preliminary evaluations, the
lowest level of investigation, into alleged automotive defects.
   Seat backs on 1.5 million Nissan cars and 1.7 million Chrysler
Caravan and Voyager vehicles allegedly are prone to collapse
suddenly, jarring the driver and causing him or her to steer out of
control, according to unconfirmed reports received by NHTSA.
   The agency ordered preliminary evaluations of all Nissan
passenger vehicles made from 1982 through 1984 and all 1984-1987
Chrysler Caravan and Voyager models.
   NHTSA said it has received 17 complaints of seat-back failure in
the Nissan vehicles, allegedly resulting in four accidents in which
five people were injured.
   Nine complaints received by the agency involved the Caravan and
Voyager. There was allegedly one accident in which three people
were injured, NHTSA said.
   ``We are aware of the NHTSA investigation and have received the
inquiry,'' said Chrysler Corp. spokesman Tony Cervone. ``We are
investigating the claim ourselves and will cooperate fully with
NHTSA's investigation.''
   Nissan Motor Corp. in U.S.A. said it would have no immediate
comment.
   Four new investigations involved other major U.S. automakers.
   The agency was studying allegations of door-hinge pin failure on
General Motors Corp.'s 1987-88 Beretta and Corsica models, and a GM
service bulletin reporting erratic cruise-control response on the
company's 1988 G vans with 6.2-liter diesel engines.
   NHTSA also opened probes of alleged failure of a seat-belt clip
in Ford Motor Co.'s 1984 Mustang and floormat interference with the
accelerator in the company's 1987-1988 Thunderbird and Cougar cars.
   Other new investigations ordered by NHTSA involved:
   _Steering shaft separation in the 1986 Hyundai Excel, in
reaction to a Canadian recall.
   _Ruptured fuel hoses in Hyundai Excels, in reaction to an
Australian recall.
   _Brake light switch failure in the 1985 BMW 325, 524, 528, 535,
635 and 735 models.
   _Heater core ruptures in the 1987 Volkswagen Golf.
   _Failure of some truck tires made by Danubian.
   _Brake shoe and caliper failure in some Midas products.

<HEAD>US Says Chilean Police Overreacted In Quelling Protest</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The State Department said Friday Chilean
security agents used ``excessive and unnecessary'' forces in
breaking up a protest demonstration in which two American labor
leaders were participating.
   The incident, which occurred Thursday, involved some 300 persons
who gathered at the Chilean Supreme Court to protest a decision to
condemn a labor leader to a sentence of internal exile.
   The protest included Jack Joyce, president of the International
Bricklayer's Union, and William Doherty, of the AFL-CIO's American
Institute for Free Labor Development.
   Speaking from Santiago, Joyce said he and Doherty were knocked
down and tear-gassed by police during the demonstration.
   State Department spokesman Charles Redman said that according to
incomplete information, the group had been attempting to comply
with the directions of the authorities when they were dispersed
violently by Chilean security forces using water cannons, tear gas
and billy clubs.
   The U.S. Embassy in Santiago has protested the incident, which
occurred three weeks before a national plebiscite in which
President Augusto Pincochet will be the lone candidate.
   ``The Department of State regrets this overreaction by the
government of Chile to a peaceful protest,'' Redman said.
   ``We again stress that it behooves Chilean authorities,
especially during the final stage of the plebiscite campaign, to
show great care as they fulfill their commitment to create an
electoral climate free of intimidation.''

   A honeymoon in paradise turned into a
nightmare for newlyweds who wound up sharing their closet with
another couple as a shelter against the fury of Hurricane Gilbert.
   ``Next time we're going to the (Wisconsin) Dells,'' said Jay
Charles, 23, who returned from Jamaica to Green Bay on Thursday
with his wife, Vicky, 23.
   ``It was frightening, and very sad,'' Charles said. ``It made us
sick to our stomachs. Those people didn't have much to live in
before. And the people who run the shops ... well, the tourists are
their life.''
   The Charleses, both registered nurses at Bellin Memorial
Hospital, flew out of Jamaica on one of the first commercial
flights leaving the vacation island.
   The Bellevue couple had flown to Jamaica on Sept. 7, four days
after their wedding. They stayed at a hotel about 10 miles up the
coast from Montego Bay.
   Charles said he was reassured by hotel officials Sunday night
that the weather wouldn't be a problem.
   ``When we woke up Monday morning, there was a note under our
door that a hurricane was coming,'' he said. ``We were on the
fourth floor and they moved us to the third floor. But we were
never told anything the whole time.''
   They spent Monday walking around the village. That day they saw
a grass hut in front of the hotel blow away and decided to take
cover.
   ``Another honeymoon couple hid in our closet and we got under
the bed,'' Charles said. ``But then the glass started to crash and
we got in the closet with them.''
   They barricaded themselves with mattresses and stayed in the
closet for almost two hours.
   ``Everything was shaking and we could hear the roof coming
off,'' Charles said. ``Windows were crashing in and we had some
water come under the closet door. It was frightening.''
   The Charleses later offered their medical help to hotel
officials.
   That night, they shared their room with eight people.
   The newlyweds had three choices of places to go for their
honeymoon, Charles said: ``Jamaica, the Cayman Islands and Cancun.''
   All three were hit by the hurricane.

   Shiite militiamen attacked a bus carrying
Communist Party members Friday night, killing one and wounding 19
others, authorities said.
   A police spokesman said members of the Iranian-backed Hezbollah,
or Party of God, opened fire on the bus in the Ouzai district in
the southern outskirts of the capital as the vehicle headed toward
south Lebanon.
   The bus, whose passengers attended a rally of the Lebanese
National Resistance Front, was bedecked with pictures of the
``martyrs of the resistance'' and red flags dangled from the
windows, the spokesman said.
   The Hezbollah militiamen ``could not bear the sight of the red
flags hanging out of the bus,'' said the spokesman who cannot be
identified in line with standing regulations.
   He said the Syrians, who are deployed in the area, are trying to
``calm things down.''
   The rally celebrated the front's sixth anniversary. The group
has launched many attacks against Israeli troops and their allied
south Lebanon army militia in south Lebanon.

<HEAD>Farmers Offer To Take Additional 3.4 Million Acres From Production</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Farmers have offered to take an additional 3.4
million acres of highly erodible cropland from production under the
10-year Conservation Reserve Program, or CRP, the Agriculture
Department said Friday.
   Milton Hertz, administrator of the department's Agricultural
Stabilization and Conservation Service, said the offers, or bids,
were made in the seventh signup for the program held July 18
through Aug. 31.
   Under the program, farmers agree to take land from production
for 10 years. In return, based on bids they submit, farmers get
annual rental payments from the government and one-time assistance
pay for half the cost of planting grass, trees and shrubs to guard
against erosion.
   The annual rental payments have been averaging around $50 per
acre.
   Acceptance of the bids will be announced around Dec. 15, Hertz
said. Congress in the 1985 farm law set a goal of 40 million to 45
million acres for the program by 1990.
   ``New CRP contracts may not be entered into which provide for an
annual rental rate in excess of the prevailing local rental rate
for comparable land,'' he said. ``Making this determination on each
bid will require extra time.''
   Including more than 25.5 million acres signed up earlier, the
latest offers would boost the program to almost 29 million acres if
all of the new bids are accepted.
   Hertz said he was encouraged by the continued interest in the
CRP, particularly in view of the 1988 drought.
   Kenneth A. Cook, senior associate of The Conservation
Foundation, a private, non-profit research organization based in
Washington, D.C., said the latest offerings were ``really a pretty
amazing signup when it started at the worst of the drought.''
   Cook said the signup could have turned out to be light, since
crop prices were going up rapidly because of the drought and it
would have been tempting for many farmers to think about growing
crops instead.
   ``But a lot of them may have thought these high (commodity)
prices aren't here to stay,'' Cook said. ``Also, the department
raised the bid levels the Corn Belt, and that helped.''

   President Reagan on Friday nominated Clyde O.
Glaister to be comptroller at the Department of Defense.
   The position is a new one at the Pentagon, which has been shaken
by recent disclosures of contracting irregularities.
   Since January, Glaister has held the position of principal
deputy assistant secretary of defense in the office of the defense
secretary. Before that he was deputy assistant secretary of defense
for program and budget.
   Glaister served in the U.S. Air Force Reserves from 1957-63. He
is a 53-year-old native of Kinlock, Pa.
   Reagan also appointed Attorney General Richard Thornburgh to be
a member of the Advisory Commission on Intergovernmental Relations
for a term of two years, succeeding departed Attorney General Edwin
Meese III in that post.

Case</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The prosecution's attempt to pin the
torture-murder of a U.S. drug agent on three men is like an effort
to catch a greased pig that keeps slipping away, a defense attorney
said at the murder trial Friday.
   Barry Tarlow accused Assistant U.S. Attorney Jimmy Gurule of
altering the facts in the case as the prosecution tried to weave a
web of circumstantial evidence around the defendants. And he said
key prosecution witnesses were criminals who are lying in an
attempt to get lenient treatment.
   ``No matter how Mr. Gurule tries to twist and distort the
evidence, I'm convinced you will see the truth,'' Tarlow said.
   Tarlow represents Jesus Felix Gutierrez, 38, who is charged as
an accessory to the murder of Drug Enforcement Administration agent
Enrique Camarena. He made the greased pig comparison in the first
day of closing defense arguments in the eight-week federal court
trial.
   Camarena was abducted outside the U.S. Consulate in Guadalajara,
Mexico, on Feb. 7, 1985. His badly beaten body and that of
associate, Alfredo Zavala Avelar were found a few weeks later,
buried on a remote Mexican ranch.
   The defense lawyer told jurors a folksy tale, saying he was
recently complaining about the prosecution's case to a country
lawyer friend. The friend, Tarlow said, told him prosecution
efforts reminded him of the carnival game where people try to catch
a greased pig.
   ``That pig started to slip and slide and slither away,'' Tarlow
said.
   Tarlow then attacked the testimony of prosecution witnesses,
calling them ``liars, cheats and perjurers,'' contending they were
influenced by prosecutors promising lenient treatment in other
cases.
   He admitted that the jury had a difficult task in trying to
determine the guilt or innocence of Felix, an admitted drug
trafficker.
   ``Can a Mexican citizen drug dealer get a fair trial in a
horrible case like this one, what with the war on drugs on
everybody's mind and with sympathy for agent Camarena?'' Tarlow
asked jurors.
   Thursday, Gurule called Camarena a heroic law officer who paid
``the ultimate price'' when he was slain while working undercover
in Mexico.
   Charged with murder in the case are Raul Lopez Alvarez, 28, and
Rene Verdugo Urquidez, 36. Felix is accused of helping Mexican drug
kingpin Rafael Caro Quintero flee to Costa Rica after the slayings.

   Sen. Lloyd Bentsen said Friday that
Republican George Bush has wrongly criticized the Democrats but had
``a bad case of laryngitis'' about budget deficits, arms sales to
Iran and dealings with Panamanian leader Manuel Noriega.
   Stumping for votes on the steps of the Pitt County Courthouse,
the Democratic vice presidential nominee rejected Bush's charge
Thursday that with Michael Dukakis as governor, Massachusetts had
become a ``fiscal fiasco'' of high taxes and lost jobs.
   ``Well, it was Pearl Harbor Day all over again. As usual, George
got all of his facts wrong,'' Bentsen said, reminding his
snickering audience of 1,000 people about Bush's remark last week
that Sept. 7 rather than Dec. 7 was the anniversary of the Japanese
attack on Pearl Harbor.
   Standing in the shadow of a statue of a Confederate soldier, the
Texas senator praised the Democratic presidential candidate's
gubernatorial record.
   ``Under Mike Dukakis, Massachusetts unemployment is the lowest
rate of any major industrial state in this union,'' Bentsen said.
``Wages are growing twice as fast as the national average, personal
income growing faster than any other state, and he submitted 10
balanced budgets in a row.''
   ``When George Bush speaks out against Mike Dukakis,'' he said,
``we should all remember that when it came to speaking out against
arms to Iran, when it came to speaking out against cozy deals with
Gen. Noriega of Panama, when it came to speaking out against
economic policies that have almost tripled the national debt,
George Bush didn't speak, he just voted present.
   ``I'll tell you, when it comes to strong leadership, George Bush
has got himself a bad case of laryngitis,'' said Bentsen, who will
complete a four-day Southern campaign tour in Florida.
   ``I'm looking for old friends who wandered away in recent
years,'' he told the Greenville crowd, his biggest of the week.
``I'm talking to the Reagan Democrats. I'm urging them to come
home, and they're responding.''
   Earlier in the day at Memphis, Tenn., Bentsen told a breakfast
crowd of party loyalists that Dukakis' positions on trade, the
economy, education and defense were ones that Southerners could
support.
   He said Bush's attacks grew out of ``panic'' over the Democratic
ticket's early lead in public opinion polls.
   ``Mike Dukakis and Lloyd Bentsen are prepared to pay the price
to defend freedom. And you have my word on it,'' Bentsen said.
   Introduced by Sen. Albert Gore, D-Tenn., and former Mississippi
Gov. William Winter, Bentsen said the Republicans were trying to
hide such policy failures of the past eight years as a
near-tripling of the national debt.
   ``George Bush talking about balanced budgets,'' he said in
Greenville. ``It's like Dan Quayle talking about his resume.
There's really not much to say.''
   Democratic gubernatorial candidate Bob Jordan of North Carolina
compared Quayle with Bentsen and said, ``God help us if Bush is
elected.''
   ``Did George Bush choose the most qualified person he could
find?'' Gore asked.
   ``We don't have to apologize to anybody, anywhere, for the
ticket we are putting before the American people this year,''
Winter said in Memphis.

   Searchers on Friday found the bodies of
four people amid the wreckage of a single-engine plane that crashed
and burned a week ago en route to a fly-in at this northern Maine
town, authorities said.
   Authorities were unaware of the missing plane until they were
notified late Wednesday by relatives who failed to hear from the
travelers, said Ronald Roy, director of the Aeronautics Division of
the state Department of Transportation. No flight plan was filed,
he said.
   A search was launched Thursday, and on Friday, one of six Civil
Air Patrol planes spotted the wreckage in trees along the northwest
side of Lily Bay Mountain, about 10 miles north of Greenville, said
Steve McCausland, spokesman for the Maine State Police.
   A medic who was ferried to the scene in a National Guard
helicopter confirmed that there were no survivors among the two men
and two women, McCausland said.
   The Cessna 182 had taken off from Lawrence, Mass., on Sept. 9 to
participate in a weekend fly-in in Greenville, Roy said.
   The search was concentrated within 10 miles of Greenville after
investigators determined the pilot had made radio contact with the
control tower at Bangor International Airport and that radar tapes
from the Federal Aviation Administration in Boston indicated the
plane had reached the Greenville area.

   Criminal investigators are looking for a
connection among three decapitated bodies of young men found since
May in widely separated areas of Georgia.
   The only current ties in the three deaths are that none of the
bodies showed signs of a struggle and that they shared similar
physical characteristics, officials said.
   The first was found in May near Cartersville in northwestern
Georgia, the second Sept. 6 near Warwick in southern Georgia and
the third Wednesday near Bogart in the northeastern part of the
state.
   All three were missing hands and head, with one also missing his
feet.
   None of the three has been identified, and officials have
released no cause of death in any of the cases.
   ``There's no question, to find bodies like this in Georgia is
very, very unusual,'' said John Bankhead, spokesman for the Georgia
Bureau of Investigation.
   ``We're trying to see how they might be linked, but there's no
way we can be sure if they are right now,'' he said. The bureau is
checking with other states to see if there are similar cases.
   Local sheriffs said each man appeared be of average height,
between 5-feet-6 and 6-feet, and of average build. Officials
believe each man was killed elsewhere and then left where the
bodies were found.
   Investigators hope they can find leads from the clothing found
on the Bogart and Bartow bodies. The Warwick body was clad only in
underwear.

   South Texas is an upside-down triangle of land stretching 250
miles southward from San Antonio.
   _Geography: Dominated by flat, arid brushland that divides into
palm tree-laden coastal plains to the east and the dusty Rio Grande
Valley to the west. A system of barrier islands, including Padre
and Mustang, protects much of the coast.
   _Culture: South Texas is a mix of posh resorts and extreme
poverty that maintains strong cultural ties with Mexico.
   _Economy: Extreme South Texas has some of the highest
unemployment rates in the nation. Major industries in the lightly
populated area include agriculture, oil and natural gas drilling.
The region is home to the famous King Ranch, larger than Rhode
Island.
   The region also has many ``maquiladoras,'' or twin plants, where
U.S. companies manufacture products using less costly Mexican labor.
   In the Rio Grande valley, the economy is boosted by thousands of
retirees who spend winter in the region.
   _Cities: The largest city in the region south of San Antonio is
Corpus Christi, population 250,000. Laredo, a town of about 125,000
along the Rio Grande, is a major gateway for trade with Mexico. The
delta of the Rio Grande includes the cities of Edinburg, McAllen,
Brownsville and Harlingen and the coastal resorts of Port Isabel
and South Padre Island.
   Brownsville is the largest of the Rio Grande Valley cities, with
a population of 110,000 people.

<HEAD>New Technology Can Produce Hydrogen From Coal, Researcher Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GUY DARST</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A new technology means that coal, often
considered a major culprit in the ``greenhouse effect'' warming of
the earth, could be a source of benign energy, a government
researcher told a Senate committee Friday.
   Meyer Steinberg, a chemical engineer and coal expert at the
Brookhaven National Laboratory in New York, proposed to the Senate
Environment and Public Works Committee a new technical option for
long-term consideration, ``a hydrogen economy based on coal'' made
possible by Brookhaven research.
   Energy experts have eyed hydrogen for decades as a possible fuel
when the world can no longer burn petroleum. Though hydrogen is an
extremely dangerous gas to handle, burning it simply produces water
as a combustion product. Liquid hydrogen has been used as a rocket
fuel.
   Most methods of making hydrogen also produce carbon dioxide, the
principal gas among several whose increasing concentration in the
atmosphere, according to some climatologists, is causing the earth
to warm by a half-degree Fahrenheit per decade. These scientists
say the warming will raise sea levels and shift rainfall patterns
to make drought in the central United States more likely, according
to many climatologists.
   Some analysts have speculated that hydrogen would have to be
produced from the decomposition of water using nuclear or some form
of solar energy, or electricity from water flowing over dams. These
energy sources leave no carbon dioxide behind.
   ``We have developed a very efficient process'' to produce a
hydrogen-rich gas from coal, said Steinberg. ``We are suggesting
that coal refineries be built based on this process.''
   Steinberg offered few details of the process he called
``hydro-carb,'' which he said was originally developed to produce
carbon black, a pure form of carbon important in producing tires
and in segments of the chemical industry. Carbon black now is made
from petroleum or natural gas.
   The carbon produced by the new process, he suggested, could
simply be stored and ``used as a clean fuel'' if carbon dioxide
emissions from combustion could be tolerated. ``All impurities
would already be removed,'' he said.
   Steinberg said such a strategy would have severe costs, ``but
probably not any more severe than going all the way to the nuclear
option.''
   Direct removal of carbon dioxide from smokestacks is possible,
he said, ``But what are we going to do with gigatons (billions of
tons) of carbon dioxide?''
   Steinberg and a colleague, Hsing Cheng, calculated in 1986 that
direct removal of carbon dioxide from utility smokestacks would be
so costly that the price of electricity could double, the project
would consume 11 percent to 16 percent of the electrical capacity
of the nation and could require a pipeline network to dispose of
liquid carbon dioxide on the ocean floor that would need an
investment of $284 billion in 1980 dollars or about $330 billion
today.
   A spokesman for the National Coal Association, John Grasser,
said he had not heard of the Brookhaven development, ``but it
sounds like an interesting process.''
   Several techniques are already used to produce combustible gas
from coal, generally yielding a mixture of hydrogen and carbon
monoxide with a heating value from 10 percent to 30 percent of
natural gas. Burning these gases yields carbon dioxide from the
carbon monoxide.
   Coal accounts for about 80 percent of the carbon dioxide
emissions from electricity generation in the United States. The
committee is considering a bill that would require new fossil power
plants to double fuel efficiency after 2010, cars to reduce carbon
dioxide emissions by 75 percent after that date, all new furnaces
and water heaters in five years to equal the performance of today's
best and all new air conditioners to double their efficiency in
five years.
   The committee released an analysis by the Office of Technology
Assessment concluding that actions called for by the bill until
2010 would be possible with today's technlogies, but after that new
technology would be needed unless society is prepared to accept
nuclear power.

<HEAD>Streams Show Decline in Lead Concentrations</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   America is getting the lead out.
   That's the word from the U.S. Geological Survey, which reports
that the amount of lead in the nation's rivers and streams declined
over a decade.
   The general reduction in lead levels is likely a result of
reduced use of leaded gasoline, the recently published study said.
   Survey scientists checked the water at some 300 locations across
the country, and found declines in lead at two-thirds of the
stations _ including significant drops at 30 percent of them,
between 1974 and 1985.
   ``Although we have not completed intensive trend analyses on
data collected since 1985, preliminary results indicate that the
overall decline in lead concentrations has continued,'' said
Richard B. Alexander in a statement.
   Alexander and Richard A. Smith, hydrologists at the Survey's
Reston, Va., National Center, compiled the report which was
published in the most recent edition of Water Resources Bulletin.
   ``This decline is certainly good news as far as the water
environment is concerned,'' Alexander observed.
   Lead is considered a hazard because, if ingested, it can cause
brain damage and eventually, even death.
   The Survey said increases in lead in stream water were found in
a few locations, principally along the Texas Gulf and Lower
Mississippi Valley regions. None was in water that was used for
drinking, however.
   The increases were thought to be largely due to declines in the
volume of water flowing in those areas in the last few years of the
study. Declining water volumes tend to concentrate pollutants.
   Assessing the effectiveness of pollution abatement efforts is
often hard to do because of the lack of widespread, long-term
measurements. The Survey's water-quality measurements, which have
been conducted since the early 1970s, are at least one way to do
this, said Alexander.
   Gasoline is believed to be the primary source of lead in streams
and rivers, and the drop in river concentrations of the metal has
occurred in parallel with the reduction in use of leaded gasoline,
he pointed out.
   The largest part of the reduction in lead in rivers and streams
occurred in 1979-80, Alexander noted, and that was the same period
that saw the steepest decline in the use of leaded gasoline.
Industrial discharges of lead into streams and rivers were sharply
cut prior to 1977, he noted.

   President Reagan and his wife Nancy have
chosen New York artist Aaron Shikler to paint their formal White
House portraits, presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said
Friday.
   ``This is done traditionally for all presidents through the
White House Historical Association and they have arranged for this

   Of the $100,000 cost, $40,000 is being paid by the association,
and the remainder has been contributed by an anonymous donor, said
Elaine Crispen, Mrs. Reagan's spokeswoman.
   Mrs. Crispen said the first lady's portrait ``is almost
finished,'' but there is still more work to be done on the
president's portrait.
   The spokeswoman said she did not know where the portraits will
be placed in the White House, but they will be finished by the time
the Reagans leave the mansion in January.

   Mikhail S. Gorbachev said Friday that Soviet
forces will abandon a strategic naval base in Vietnam if the United
States pulls its armed forces from bases in the Philippines.
   In a key foreign policy speech, the Soviet leader announced that
the Kremlin has frozen its nuclear weapon stocks in Soviet Asia. He
also responded to U.S. allegations that a Siberian radar violates a
superpower arms treaty by suggesting the station be used to study
space.
   Gorbachev made the 1{-hour speech during a meeting with
Communist Party and local government workers in the city of
Krasnoyarsk, 2,000 miles east of Moscow and the site of the
controversial radar. The official Tass news agency carried a
summary.
   A seven-point plan ``aimed at strengthening security in the
Asia-Pacific region,'' highlighted the speech, the first major
address by Gorbachev since he returned Monday from a six-week
vacation.
   It was the first time Gorbachev focused on relations with Asia
since a July 28, 1986 speech at the Pacific port of Vladivostok.
   In that speech, Gorbachev called for a summit with China and
peace in the region. Friday's speech reiterated the call for a
summit with Beijing and urged Japan not to increase its military
strength.
   ``Aware of the Asian and Pacific countries' concern, the Soviet
Union will not increase the amount of any nuclear weapons in the
region _ it has already been practicing this for some time _ and is
calling on the United States and other nuclear powers not to deploy
them additionally in the region,'' Gorbachev said, according to the
Tass summary.
   ``If the United States agrees to the elimination of military
bases in the Philippines, the Soviet Union will be ready ... to
give up the fleet's material and technical supply station in Cam
Ranh Bay.''
   The Pentagon describes Cam Ranh Bay in Vietnam as the Soviets'
largest naval deployment base abroad, threatening U.S. military
presence in the Philippines. U.S. officials in Bangkok said about
7,000 Soviet personnel are stationed there.
   The United States maintains six bases in the Philippines. The
two major bases _ Subic Bay Naval Base and Clark Air Base _ are the
largest U.S. military installations outside the United States, but
American-Filipino talks on an agreement to review the final two
years of the leases, which expire in 1991, have stalled.
   In Washington, President Reagan commented on Gorbachev's
proposal regarding the bases.
   ``I haven't had an opportunity to go into it in detail in what
it is he's proposing, but I look forward to doing that because
certainly we want to do anything we can to help bring about a
better relationship between our two countries,'' Reagan told
reporters.
   On Thursday, Secretary of State George P. Shultz said talks in
Manila on compensation for the bases and other issues ``basically
aren't going well.''
   Gorbachev proposed ``that a center for international cooperation
in the utilization of space for peaceful purposes be set up on the
basis of the Krasnoyarsk radar station,'' Tass said.
   Although his wording was vague, Gorbachev appeared to be
offering to dismantle or convert the 30-story radar. The U.S.
government says the installation violates the 1972 Anti-Ballistic
Missile treaty and is a major obstacle to talks in Geneva toward
halving long-range missile arsenals.
   ``Speculation about the Krasnoyarsk radar station continues,''
the Soviet leader said in remarks carried by Soviet television.
``It's turning out to have a slowing effect on the Geneva
negotiations.''
   The move would also put more pressure on the Reagan
administration to act on Soviet complaints the United States is
violating the ABM treaty, particularly by its Star Wars program for
a space-based missile defense.
   ``Our concern over the construction of the U.S. radar stations
in Greenland and Britain remains. Experts say that they are a
downright violation of the ABM treaty. We expect that Washington
will take appropriate measures in response to our initiative,'' he
said.
   The Soviet Union offered last month to dismantle the radar
equipment if the United States agreed to commit itself to the ABM
treaty for nine or 10 years.
   Asked about Gorbachev's proposal on the Krasnoyarsk radar, White
House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater reiterated the U.S. position that
the facility must be dismantled because it violates ABM treaty.
   The United States has maintained the radar violates the treaty
because it is not at the edge of the country, pointed outward, as
the pact stipulates such a radar must be.
   The Soviets maintain the radar is designed for the tracking of
satellites and spacecraft and not for the detection of any incoming
missiles.
   Tass implied that Gorbachev agreed to U.S. demands that the
Krasnoyarsk base be scrapped.
   ``This is our reply to the West's concerns over the Krasnoyarsk
station,'' Tass quoted Gorbachev as saying.
   On China, Gorbachev said Soviets ``stand for the full
normalization of relations'' and noted ``goodwill and trust'' have
been increasing with the Chinese.
   The Kremlin's ties with Beijing have been strained since the two
Communist giants split over ideological and strategic differences
in the early 1960s.
   Friday's speech came at the end of a five-day visit to the
Krasnoyarsk region during which Gorbachev heard numerous complaints
from residents about poor living conditions.
   The 57-year-old Communist Party chief referred to those
complaints in Friday's address and said social problems are a
priority, especially food shortages.

   Four American citizens who chained
themselves to a gate of the U.S. Embassy three days ago to protest
Washington's policies in Central America are within their rights,
an embassy spokesman said Friday.
   ``This is an example of the right to protest in a country where
the right of free expression is respected,'' embassy spokesman John
Tracy said. It was the embassy's first official response.
   The protesters who began the demonstration Wednesday by throwing
a liquid resembling blood on the embassy steps and then chained
themselves to the main entrance were identified as Dale
Ashara-Davis, 34, of Baltimore, Md.; John Schuchardt, 49, of New
Haven, Conn., and Sara Story, 26, and Charlie Litery, 57, both of
Washington, D.C..
   The four, along with 16 other U.S. citizens jailed in Honduras,
belong to a group called Project Independence,
   Tracy said the protesters in Guatemala have not caused any major
problems or blocked people from entering and leaving the embassy.
   The protesters said they have asked to talk to U.S. Ambassador
James Michel, but Tracy said that ``up to now, they have not made
that request through the normal channels.''
   In Honduras, police Maj. Manuel Urbina said Thursday that 16
U.S. citizens were jailed after demonstrating at the U.S. Embassy
in Tegucigalpa and at the Palmerola air base 40 miles northwest of
the capital.
   Urbina, spokesman for the Public Security Forces, said the
detainees probably would be expelled.
   A declaration issued by the Project Independence group said,
``At this time of remembering Central American independence from
Spain (in 1821) we've come to join with Central Americans in
declaring its independence from U.S. domination.''

   A 350-pound sow decided she wasn't ready for hog
heaven and tried to make a break for it on the way to the
slaughterhouse.
   Or maybe she just wanted new duds for the occasion.
   The daring hog leaped from a truck onto the six-lane U.S. 70 in
front of a shopping mall Thursday.
   ``That's the first time I've ever come along to find a pig in
the road,'' said trucker Richard Belk of Salisbury.
   A witness told police the hog lifted the truck's tailgate with
its snout. Once out of the truck, the stunned sow stood in the road
for at least 15 minutes, refusing to budge as amazed motorists
stopped, stared and honked.
   ``The pig wasn't afraid at all,'' said Charlene Evans. ``A
trucker blew his horn at her and she wouldn't budge.''
   About eight police officers and motorists helped the truck's
driver reload the hog, which wasn't hurt except for a few scrapes.
   ``Did they say she was going to slaughter?'' asked police
officer R.B. Brown. ``I would've jumped out, too.''

   If anyone is entitled to a little peace
and quiet, it's Bob and Dorothy DeBolt.
   The DeBolts, once the subject of an Academy Award-winning
documentary, raised six of their own children and 14 adopted ones,
many of whom have physical and mental handicaps.
   Now the couple, who moved to San Diego County about a year ago
from northern California, are savoring their accomplishments and
their empty nest.
   ``We always intended for our children to grow up and leave
home,'' said Mrs. DeBolt, 65. ``When each of the children flew the
nest, it was a wonderful kind of achievement. We don't pay for
anything anymore; they are all fiercely, fully independent.''
   The brood is scattered throughout California and as far as
Hawaii. Many live in Oakland or Berkeley, near the family's former
home in Piedmont, Calif.
   The DeBolts married in 1970, when Dorothy was a widow with nine
children, four of them adopted.
   Three years later, DeBolt, 57, quit his job as president of a
construction company, when the couple founded their own adoption
agency to help people adopt children with handicaps.
   The DeBolts said they now support themselves by giving seminars
and making public appearances.

<HEAD>Report: Late Rains Of Little Immediate Benefit But Will Aid 1989
Crops</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rains that began in mid-August and continued
into early September ``provided much needed relief to parched areas
of the Midwest and Southeast,'' President Reagan's interagency
drought committee said Friday.
   ``These rains provided little benefit to this year's grain crop
due to their occurrence late in the growing season, but they will
improve forage supplies and soil moisture conditions for 1989
crops,'' the committee report said.
   The report was the fourth since the committee was formed in
mid-June. A final summation will be prepared in December, the
report said.
   ``In recent weeks, the focus of the 1988 drought has shifted
from agriculture to the severe wildfires in the far West,'' the
report said.
   ``Nationwide, over 68,000 wildfires have destroyed over 4.1
million acres,'' it added.l ``As a result of excessive heat and
dryness in the West, no relief is expected in the near term for the
nation's forests. The economic impact of forest damage this year
will extend into future years.''
   In the case of agriculture, the drought caused crop damage and
other losses that are estimated to total about $14 billion to $16
billion this year in terms of 1982 farm prices, the report said.
However, the net cash income of farmers is expected to be about
equal to last year's level because of sales from inventory stocks
and higher commodity prices.
   The committee, headed by Agriculture Secretary Richard E. Lyng,
included Interior Secretary Donald Hodel and representatives of the
vice president's office, the Army Corps of Engineers, the Energy
Department, the Tennesee Valley Authority, the Office of Management
and Budget, and the Federal Emergency Management Agency.

   Textile-state lawmakers won a key tactical
victory Friday in the House, persuading a committee chairman to
change course and push for approval of Senate-passed import
legislation without any changes.
   ``In my opinion this will insure passage of the textile bill by
Congress this year,'' Sen. Strom Thurmond, R-S.C., said after
receiving word of the decision. ``The biggest danger we face now is
a presidential veto.''
   The bill, designed to protect American manufacturers from
foreign competition, would freeze current textile and apparel
imports at 1987 levels and hold growth to one percent annually
starting next year.
   Advancing amid a flurry of Reagan administration veto threats,
the measure would also cap nonrubber footwear imports at 1987
levels with no provision for increases.
   House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Dan Rostenkowski,
D-Ill., met for 45 minutes with 20 textile-state lawmakers and then
consulted with senior committee members before deciding on an
about-face that will avoid sending the bill to a House-Senate
conference committee.
   At Rostenkowski's urging, the committee had approved Wednesday a
plan to send the bill to a conference committee with the Senate to
resolve differences. Textile lawmakers said the measure could
become snagged in the conference committee.
   House Speaker Jim Wright, D-Texas, told reporters Thursday that
it was ``not certain'' that the measure would go to a conference
committee. He indicated that there was still time to change course.
   The bill's supporters say it is needed to save American jobs
that will inevitably dwindle as the U.S. market becomes flooded
with textile and apparel imports. Critics say the measure
represents protectionism that would narrow consumer choices and
actually cost more jobs than it would save when Asian
textile-exporting nations retaliate.
   Congressional supporters of the textile industry expect Reagan
to veto the legislation. He vetoed an earlier version in 1985.
   Thus far, industry supporters have been unable to muster the
two-thirds support in either house needed to override a veto and
pass the measure into law over the president's objections.
   At all costs, however, they hope to deny Reagan the opportunity
to exercise a so-called pocket veto. The president may prevent a
bill from becoming law when Congress is out of session merely by
refusing to sign it.
   Congress had set a target date for adjournment of Oct. 5,
although that easily could be extended an extra week.
   Textile industry supporters say forcing Reagan to use his veto
pen and not merely kill the bill with a pocket veto would exact a
much higher political price from the Republican ticket in
textile-producing states.
   Differences between the Senate bill and the year-old House
version are few. The House bill would freeze imports at 1986
levels. It would set up a one-year pilot program under which the
government would auction off import licenses.
   It would guarantee better quotas to countries that increased
their purchases of U.S. farm goods. And it would set up a special
quota for imported silk neckties. Other than that, the two measures
are the same.

   A sinkhole that opened up beneath a
stretch of railroad track caused 27 cars of a freight train to
derail, CSX Transportation officials said Friday.
   ``The hole is the cause of the accident, there is no doubt about
that. It's as if a bridge fell or a tunnel collapsed. It's obvious
the whole track dropped fix to six feet. But we don't know why,''
CSX spokesman Lloyd Lewis said.
   ``The whole crossing where that track is contained is gone,'' he
said.
   Another CSX spokesman, Lindsay Leckie, said a depression, about
100 feet long, 10 feet wide and 5 feet deep, formed under the
tracks as the train rolled along early Thursday.
   ``There was apparently some water intrusion under the roadbed
which caused the track structure to collapse. The key question is
what caused this intrusion,'' Leckie said.
   He said the appearance of the hole was ``sudden, unobservable
and undetectable,'' adding that four locomotives and eight cars
passed over it before the derailment and other trains had used the
tracks an hour earlier.
   Tanker cars damaged in the derailment spewed noxious fumes into
the air. Two Florida Highway Patrol troopers were hospitalized for
respiratory problems after inhaling potassium hydroxide, and
several other officers and railroad workers were treated for
respiratory problems.
   The derailment forced the closing of five major intersections
and 45 nearby businesses. Four intersections and the businesses
reopened Friday.

<TEXT>
   Solidarity leader Lech Walesa and Interior
Minister Czeslaw Kiszczak agreed at a six-hour meeting Friday that
round-table debates on the future of Poland would begin in
mid-October.
   Those talks will include the future of the outlawed Solidarity
labor federation and of trade union pluralism.
   ``Our positions got closer. I am satisfied,'' a tired-looking
Walesa said after the meeting at a government guest house outside
Warsaw broke up at about 9 p.m. (3 p.m. EDT).
   ``Some bitter things were traded,'' said mediator Andrzej
Stelmachowski.
   It was the second meeting between Walesa and communist
authorities in two days, and was called to set terms for a broad
round-table meeting of social groups on major Polish problems.
   Walesa last month persuaded striking workers to end a wave of
walkouts after obtaining from the government an agreement to meet.
The labor unrest posed the most serious threat to Solidarity since
it was crushed with the imposition of martial law in 1981.
   Twenty-five people took part in Friday's meeting, among them
other Solidarity leaders and representatives of the officially
sanctioned trade union alliance OPZZ who were invited to the
preparatory talks for the first time.
   ``During the talks, matters related to the organization of the
round table were discussed,'' said a joint communique issued after
the meeting and carried by the state news service PAP.
   ``The positions of the sides were brought closer,'' it said,
adding that the talks touched on the state and public life, the
national economy and ``the shape of the Polish trade union
movement.''
   ``It was decided that the round-table debates would start in
mid-October,'' the statement said.
   ``There is no freedom without Solidarity,'' Walesa told
reporters waiting for him at a church complex after the session.
   Stelmachowski, a law professor who has been the go-between in
arranging the meetings, reported, ``No definite decisions were
taken, but there was some progress.''
   He said it would be too early to say that authorities have
agreed to restore legal status to Solidarity.
   ``It seems to me that some chance for legalization is coming
into view,'' he said. ``But needless to say all that still requires
some time and patience. ... When you are baking something in the
kitchen, you cannot say much yet.''
   Authorities and official trade unions were represented by 13
people led by Kiszczak, Alternate Politburo member Stanislaw Ciosek
and Romuald Sosnowski, deputy chairman of the official trade union
alliance OPZZ, PAP said.
   For the opposition, Walesa, Stelmachowski, Wroclaw Solidarity
leader Wladyslaw Frasyniuk and seven other members or advisers of
Solidarity took part. In addition, two priests were present
representing the church.
   Jozef Czyrek, a member of the Communist Party's ruling
Politburo, was quoted by the TV news ``Panorama of the Day'' as
saying in an interview, ``The round-table alone is a success, as is
the fact that the psychological and political barrier, very
difficult for either side, has been surmounted.''
   Among the Solidarity members were chairmen of four interfactory
strike committees that directed last month's strikes, which
demanded that Solidarity's legal status be restored.
   The East bloc's first independent union, with a membership of 10
million people, was outlawed in October 1982 after being suspended
in the Dec. 13, 1981, martial law crackdown.
   Walesa and most of the Solidarity representatives were planning
to leave Warsaw Saturday to attend an annual workers' pilgrimage
this weekend at the Jasna Gora monastery in Czestochowa.
   During a meeting lasting more than four hours Thursday, Walesa
and Kiszczak agreed to continue efforts to convene the talks ``as
soon as possible.'' That meeting was only Walesa's second encounter
with authorities in six years.
   At a meeting with Walesa on Aug. 31, Kiszczak agreed that the
talks would include Solidarity's future. Walesa then successfully
ended the strikes so talks could start.
   ``The idea of the `round-table' creates hope for directing all
constructive forces of the Polish nation toward the improvement of
Poland's economy,'' an OPZZ statement issued Thursday evening on
the state PAP news service said.

<HEAD>Jury Rules For Valerie Harper In Dispute Over `Valerie' Series</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: SUBS grafs 6-7, `Miss Harper ..., with 7 grafs to UPDATE with
comment from jury foreman, Lorimar spokeswoman, new quotes from
Miss Harper.</NOTE>

<TEXT>
   A jury decided Friday that Valerie Harper was
right and Lorimar Telepictures Corp. was wrong in the dispute that
ended her role in the ``Valerie'' television series, awarding her
nearly $2 million in damages and a share of the profits.
   The jurors gave Miss Harper and her husband, Tony Cacciotti, who
worked as a supervising producer for the show, $1.85 million in
general damages.
   The jury found that Miss Harper also is entitled to 12.5 percent
of the adjusted gross profits of the series for the 1987-88 season
_ even though she was no longer on the show for most of the season.
The contract wold have run through 1991.
   Her lawyer estimated that her share of last season's profits
could eventually amount to as much as $15 million if the show is
syndicated.
   Jurors found that Lorimar had acted with ``oppression and
malice'' in firing her. But the jury declined to grant her and her
husband any punitive damages.
   ``The television business is just like any other business,''
said jury foreman Archie McDaniels, a postal worker. ``You have
good and bad. This verdict doesn't condemn the TV industry. You
just have to treat people fairly.''
   Some of the jurors lined up in the hallway after delivering
their verdict to get Miss Harper's autograph. The actress, engulfed
by well-wishers and reporters as she left the courtroom, said she
felt ``vindicated.''
   She said she hoped the decision will be ``a landmark in terms of
how actors are dealt with.''
   ``People have to be accountable for what they do,'' she said.
``That's the real victory in this case.''
   Lorimar attorney Donald Engel called the verdict ``a mixed bag''
and said that from Lorimar's standpoint, ``it could have been
worse.'' He said he was pleased that no punitive damages were
awarded, and added that in a case that pitted an an individual
against a big corporation, ``we didn't do so bad.''
   He said an appeal was unlikely because ``the verdict is so
small,'' but Lorimar spokeswoman Barbara Brogliatti said: ``We're
disappointed in the verdict. And our attorney has advised us there
are grounds for an appeal and we are considering it.''
   Lorimar sued Miss Harper, claiming she breached her contract by
quitting the NBC show ``Valerie.'' A countersuit by Miss Harper and
her husband contended she was wrongfully fired from the show.
   Lorimar offered extensive testimony depicting Miss Harper as a
temperamental star who wanted complete creative control. Miss
Harper testified she wanted input on creative decisions but was not
trying to wrest complete control.
   She had stressed that she brought the concept of the ``Valerie''
series to NBC and expected to help shape the episodes. She claimed
the writers and producers changed the show to minimize her role and
focus on the teen-age boys in the series.
   Sandy Duncan replaced Miss Harper on the show, which was
retitled ``The Hogan Family.''

<TEXT>
   A 34-year-old West German man died
Friday from injuries suffered at last month's Ramstein air show
disaster, bringing the death toll to 64, a state official said.
   Rhineland-Palatinate state spokesman Juergen Dietzen said the
man died in a hospital in Homburg early Friday from severe burns
suffered in the Aug. 28 catastrophe during an air show at the
Ramstein U.S. Air Force base.
   Dietzen said 152 people remained hospitalized in 46 facilities
and at least 25 of the victims are in very serious or critical
condition.
   The accident occurred when three jets in a 10-plane Italian air
force stunt team collided during a performance. One of the jets
plunged into the crowd below and exploded in flames.
   Officials gave the following breakdown by nationalities of the
people who perished: 57 West Germans, a U.S. soldier and her
9-year-old son, one French citizen, a Dutch citizen and the three
Italian pilots.

<HEAD>Court Says EPA Need Not Recalculate Mileage Data</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A federal appeals court reversed two previous
court decisions and let stand Friday changes the government imposed
three years ago in the way automobile fuel economy is tested.
   Critics of the 1985 changes by the Environmental Protection
Agency had charged that the changes had allowed automakers to save
millions of dollars in penalties for failing to meet fuel economy
standards.
   A three-judge panel and later the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
had ruled in favor of a suit filed by the Center for Auto Safety,
challenging the EPA's 1985 decision, which eased methods used by
automakers to determine gas mileage for each of their car models.
   Those tests are used to determine fleet-wide fuel economy
figures that each automaker must meet under separate regulations.
The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration establishes the
fleet average, and if an automaker does not meet the average and
does not have credits from past years, it must pay a civil penalty.
   The full appeals court said Friday that the two previous
rulings, in 1986 and last May, were in error. As a result, the EPA
testing procedures imposed in 1985 will stand.
   The full, 11-member appeals court said that it had not been
determined that the Center for Auto Safety had standing to
challenge the regulatory change by the EPA, noting that the court
that issued the earlier decision had been sharply divided on that
issue.
   The ruling last May in favor of the Center for Auto Safety suit
came in a 5-5 vote.
   ``We now hold that as a majority of the ... court was unable to
satisfy itself that the court had jurisdiction, the court should
not have taken any affirmative action on the merits (of the
case),'' the court said Friday.
   The issue involves testing methods used by the automakers for
determining the fuel economy of each car model. The EPA in 1985
agreed to allow a series of technical changes in those methods
which critics said made it easier for the manufacturers to attain
higher mileage figures and, in turn, made it easier to meet
fleet-wide fuel economy requirements.
   As a result, the suit argued, manufacturers such as Ford Motor
Co. and General Motors Corp., which were having difficulty meeting
the fuel economy requirements anyway, saved millions of dollars in
penalties.
   ``The effect of today's decision is to let GM and Ford off the
hook from having to pay any penalties for failing to comply with
fuel economy standards in previous model years,'' said Cornish
Hitchcock, an attorney for the Center for Auto Safety.
   The automakers welcomed the appeals court decision.
   ``It reinstates EPA's original rule-making, which Ford believes
did account for the effects of changing test procedures on our
corporate average fuel economy,'' said Donald Buist, director of
Ford's automotive emissions and fuel economy office in Dearborn,
Mich.
   William H. Noack, a Washington-based spokesman for General
Motors, said the company ``welcomed the decision'' but said it
would have no effect on GM's fleet-wide fuel efficiency performance
for 1988 through 1990 models.
   Federal law requires a 27.5 miles per gallon fleet-wide fuel
economy standards for 1989-90 model cars, but NHTSA has proposed
lowering that to 26.5 mpg. It has lowered it to 26 mpg in each of
the past three model years, arguing that consumer demand for large,
less fuel efficient cars, make the 27.5 standard difficult for
automakers to reach.

<HEAD>Congressmen Ask EPA to Hold Off on Superfund Study</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Sixteen congressional committee chairmen,
subcommittee chairman and ranking Republicans asked the
Environmental Protection Agency on Friday not to begin a major
study of the ``Superfund'' toxic waste cleanup program so late in
the administration.
   ``The agency should concentrate its full energy and resources on
implementing'' amendments to the cleanup law passed in 1986
``rather than on reopening many policy questions which were hotly
contested during enactment and during reauthorization less than two
years ago,'' the leaders wrote to EPA.
   ``Second, it is inappropriate to spend Superfund money to
undertake a costly Superfund reauthorization study during the final
days of this administration,'' the group said.
   The agency had planned to give the Conservation Foundation $2.5
million for a study to define issues that should be dealt with in
the Superfund program. Environmentalists had objected that such a
study really should be done as part of the congressional work
leading to renewal of the law in 1991.
   ``Any long-term Superfund study going beyond data gathering
should be developed by the next administration,'' the chairmen said.
   Craig DeRemer, an aide to Thomas, said the agency had to study
the letter before replying but it appeared that ``they have
misunderstood some of the purposes of the study.'' He said Thomas
wanted an examination of all hazardous waste issues, not just
Superfund.
   He noted that Thomas, in a Thursday conversation with reporters,
had said most Superfund issues could be characterized as both
``policy'' and ``implementation'' issues, such as the question of
``how clean is clean'' standards.
   In that conversation, Thomas noted, ``I haven't had anybody yet
come to me and say, `Lee, this is a dumb idea.''' However, he said
``we probably won't'' proceed if environmental groups decline to
serve on the study steering committee.
   ``The issues are going to be the same in any administration,''
DeRemer said. ``There is no reason to wait. Changes can always be
made in the new administration.''

   Advocates for the homeless told a federal
judge Friday that the Department of Housing and Urban Development
violated the law by selling foreclosed homes to the highest bidder
without determining whether they could be used by the homeless and
low-income people.
   William Bradford, representing the coalition of advocates for
the homeless, told U.S. District Judge Oliver Gasch that HUD
receives 70,000 single-family houses each year _ about 7,000 a
month _ but the agency ``cannot proceed as if it is simply in the
real estate business. They must consider the homeless.''
   In a related case, the National Coalition for the Homeless also
argued that the Reagan administration has defied a congressional
mandate to release underutilized federal property as housing for
the nation's homeless.
   Ms. Maria Foscarinis, a coalition attorney, said, ``There are
thousands of properties underutilized which could be used for the
homeless.'' She said that of the 12 facilities have been identified
as underutilized by the Veterans Administration, the Defense
Department and the General Services Administration, only two have
been made available to the homeless.
   Government attorney W. Robert Irwin argued that the 1987 Stuart
B. McKinney Homeless Assistance Act _ named after the late
Connecticut congressman who was a leading promoter of the measure _
does not apply to single-family dwellings.
   ``They want to shut down a program that has been going on for 50
years,'' Irwin said. ``They want to tie up the program.''
   Arthur Goldberg, another government lawyer, said all the
agencies have complied with the provisions of the Homeless Act.
   ``Congress was trying to match up the needs of the homeless with
the properties available,'' he said. ``It is not a perfect match.''
   Gasch, who heard three separate cases brought by homeless
advocates against the government, took them under advisement,
saying he would decide as soon as he can whether to issue
preliminary injunctions.
   Bradford told the judge that two temporary restraining orders
issued last month preventing HUD from auctioning off its foreclosed
single-family homes were to expire at the end of business Friday.
   Gasch merely said, ``I would hope they would maintain the status
quo.''
   HUD general counsel J. Michael Dorsey said the federal agency
would follow the restraining order voluntarily until the end of
business next Wednesday. It was anticipated that Gasch would decide
the case by then.
   HUD has said that it generally sells the homes to the highest
bidders _ frequently investors _ but insists that it has several
programs designed to help homeless people find places to live.
   Recently, HUD has been selling an average of 7,100 properties
each month _ houses that had Federal Housing Administration
mortgage insurance and that went into foreclosure when their owners
could no longer keep up the mortgage payments. The program has
produced some $2.4 billion in proceeds since Oct. 1, 1987, the
start of the current fiscal year.
   HUD officials have argued that the court decisions, if upheld,
could cost the agency $3 billion a year and bankrupt its
single-family mortgage insurance fund.
   The Mortgage Bankers Association of America, in a
friend-of-the-court brief, said if Gasch issued an injunction, it
would interfere with the orderly and efficient way HUD replenishes
and restores the actuarial soundness of the FHA program.
   The association said it would reduce future refunds of premiums
paid by current FHA-insured home owners, increase premiums of
future FHA homeowners, ``make single-family programs unavailable or
less attractive to prospective home buyers,'' and reduce the
opportunities of home ownership for individuals and families in the
future.

   Hurricane Gilbert pushed clouds and thunderstorms across the
Gulf of Mexico coast on Friday, pelting the area with rain and
causing local flooding.
   Violent weather surrounding the hurricane spun off more than a
half-dozen tornadoes in the Brownsville, Texas, area Friday,
blowing over at least two homes and slightly injuring one person.
   Thunderstorms related to Gilbert also spawned tornadoes Friday
afternoon at Fort Rucker and Daleville in Alabama. Strong
thunderstorm wind gusts caused damage to trees and house roofs at
Houma, La.
   The calm eye at the heart of the hurricane made landfall about
120 miles south of Brownsville, at 4:35 p.m. CDT, in Mexico's
Tamaulipas state.
   The National Weather Service said tides near the hurricane
center will be as much as 11 feet higher than normal. Gilbert was
expected to bring 10 to 15 inches of rainfall.
   By noon on Friday, showers and thunderstorms reached from
eastern Texas across northern Florida and southern Georgia,
Alabama, Mississippi, Tennessee, Kentucky, Illinois, western
Indiana, Wisconsin, northern Minnesota and North Dakota. Rain also
continued over the northern Pacific Coast.
   Rainfall during the six hours ending at 2 p.m. EDT included 2{
inches at Baton Rouge, La., almost 2 inches at Mobile, Ala., 1{
inches at Brownsville, Texas, and 1 and one-third inches at
Pensacola, Fla.
   The nation's low temperature Friday was 17 degrees at Gunnison,
Colo.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 53
degrees at Bremerton, Wash., to 104 degrees at Palm Springs, Calif.
   The forecast Saturday was for showers and thunderstorms in
central and eastern Texas, Arkansas, southeast Missouri, the Ohio
Valley, the Tennessee Valley, from Mississippi across Alabama, from
Florida to New York state, the Appalachians and the lower Great
Lakes. Rain was also predicted for northwest Montana.
   Predicted high temperatures were in the 60s over northern Maine,
Upper Michigan, and from the northern Rockies across the northern
Pacific Coast; near 90 degrees in Florida and Louisiana; in the 90s
from southwest Texas to the desert Southwest, and near 105 degrees
through the desert Southwest. High temperatures in the rest of the
nation were expected to reach seasonable 70s and 80s.

   Supporters of President Corazon
Aquino launched a new pro-administration political party Friday,
but she said the move must not be allowed to divide democratic
forces.
   Mrs. Aquino hailed the formation of Struggle of the Democratic
Filipino, the latest step in the realignment of forces that toppled
President Ferdinand Marcos' 20-year regime and propelled her to
power in February 1986.
   Mrs. Aquino made the remarks in a speech to the first national
convention of the party.
   ``Perhaps it is time to have political parties,'' she said in a
speech opening its first convention. ``Perhaps indeed, the time for
realignment is now. Yet, I hope that these realignments do not
portend the permanent and total division of the forces of democracy
in our country. For should that happen, it will mean the end of all
of us.''
   She said divisions among pro-democracy Filipinos enabled Marcos,
now in exile in Hawaii, to impose eight years of martial law in
1972 and prolong his rule.
   ``It is good for the country and for democracy if people with
shared ideals and programs organize themselves into separate
parties,'' Mrs. Aquino said. ``But it would be disastrous if we
divided ourselves again into permanent hostile camps.''
   Rep. Ramon Mitra, speaker of the House of Representatives, was
elected president of the new party, which organizers hope will
bring together pro-government forces under a single banner and
serve as the president's party.
   In February 1986 Mrs. Aquino ran for president under the banner
of the United Nationalist Democratic Organization, or UNIDO, the
party of her running mate, Salvador Laurel. Since then, Vice
President Laurel has criticized Mrs. Aquino's policies, UNIDO has
fared poorly at the ballot box and many of the party's legislators
have defected to pro-Aquino parties.
   Last month Laurel formed an opposition movement, the Union for
National Action. He accused Mrs. Aquino of incompetence and urged
her to resign to make way for new elections but he received little
popular support.
   Some pro-Aquino politicians say formation of the Struggle for
the Democratic Filipino is a bid by the president's relatives and
others to consolidate their own power before the 1992 presidential
election. Among the party's main organizers is Rep. Jose Cojuangco,
Mrs. Aquino's influential younger brother.
   Mrs. Aquino, who has vowed not to seek re-election, told more
than 5,000 delegates that she hoped the party was organized ``not
only for the 1992 elections but to help our people face and
overcome their problems.''
   She said Filipinos were disenchanted with traditional political
parties and the bickering and constant jockeying for positions.
Political parties in the Philippines traditionally revolved around
personalities rather than ideology.
   Mitra said Mrs. Aquino avoided giving the party a ringing
endorsement because she did not want to be accused of playing
politics. Mrs. Aquino said she was not favoring the party over
other parties in the government coalition and would keynote their
conventions if invited.
   Mitra said Thursday that the party was organized to consolidate
political support for the government and establish a grass-roots,
mass movement behind Mrs. Aquino.
   ``But there are others who do not believe in this thinking,''
Mitra said. He was referring to the refusal of 18 Liberal Party
members in the House to join the new party.
   The Liberals, led by Senate President Jovito Salonga, are among
six parties in the government coalition. But the Liberals have
disagreed with other pro-government parties and with some of the
president's influential relatives.

   The army imposed curfews Friday on 180,000
Arabs living in Gaza Strip refugee camps to prevent violence after
activists called a general strike to mark the 1982 massacre of
hundreds of Palestinians in Lebanon.
   In southern Lebanon, troops fatally shot three PLO guerrillas
who the army said planned to attack Israeli settlements.
   A Palestine Liberation Organization official told an Israeli
daily the PLO wants to negotiate peace but would not abandon
attacks against Israel.
   Police questioned Israeli peace crusader Abie Nathan, who met
this week with PLO chief Yasser Arafat in violation of Israeli law.
Nathan, 61, was released on $3,000 bail.
   ``I violated the law to promote peace and ... I'm ready to pay
the price,'' said Nathan, a former fighter pilot and owner of the
pirate radio station Voice of Peace.
   In the West Bank city of Nablus, troops fired at Palestinian
stone-throwers, critically wounding a 14-year-old boy in the
stomach, hospital officials said. The army said it was checking the
report.
   The army denied another report by Arab hospital officials that
Israeli troop gunfire wounded a Palestinian in Jabaliya refugee
camp outside Gaza City.
   A 25-year-old Jewish woman was hit by a rock and suffered a
skull fracture while driving past Dahariyeh south of Hebron in the
West Bank on her way home to a settlement near Jerusalem, said
Tammy Lunenfeld, spokeswoman for Beersheba's Soroka hospital.
   Also Friday, the army banned distribution of the pro-PLO Al Fajr
newspaper in the occupied territories for 45 days, the military
government announced.
   It said the paper, based in Arab east Jerusalem, violated the
law by publishing ``a very anti-Semitic cartoon depicting a Jew as
a Nazi'' without submitting the cartoon to military censors.
   At least 266 Palestinians and six Israelis have been killed
since the Palestinian uprising began Dec. 8 in the occupied West
Bank and Gaza Strip.
   Pro-PL0 leaders of the uprising called a general strike for
Saturday to mark the sixth anniversary of the slayings of hundreds
of Palestinians by Israeli-allied Christian militiamen in the
Beirut refugee camps Sabra and Chatilla.
   The army imposed indefinite curfews on the Gaza Strip refugee
camps Bureij, Jabaliya, Nuseirat, Khan Yunis and Shati to prevent
clashes during the anniversary, confining 180,000 Palestinians to
their homes. Four West Bank villages also were under curfew.
   In Gaza City, Islamic militants belonging to the underground
group Hamas, or Zeal, painted graffiti calling on merchants to
observe the strike. One slogan, written in Hebrew and Arabic, read
``Death to the Jews,'' Arab witnesses said.
   The three guerrillas killed in southern Lebanon belonged to
Arafat's Fatah faction, the largest in the PLO, Israel radio said.
   The squad carried Soviet-made Kalashnikov rifles equipped with
silencers and apparently was planning to attack border settlements
in northern Israel, the report said.
   An army patrol spotted the guerrillas on the northern slopes of
Mount Dov on the Israeli-Lebanese border and opened fire, the army
said. The Israeli troops did not suffer casualties.
   The clash was inside Israel's self-proclaimed security zone, a
six- to-10-mile-wide strip north of the border. It is patrolled by
about 1,000 Israeli troops and an equal number of Israeli-backed
Lebanese militiamen.
   In an interview published Friday in the Jerusalem Post daily,
PLO spokesman Bassam Abu Sharif said the organization would not
cease acts of violence against Israel or call a halt to the
uprising.
   ``Military operations that have been carried out against Israel,
the Israeli army, will definitely continue as an act of
resistance,'' Abu Sharif said.
   But he also said the PLO was ready to ``deal with any
representatives of the Israelis who are courageous enough to sit
and talk and negotiate peace.''
   Nathan was interrogated for 90 minutes by police in the Tel Aviv
suburb of Petah Tikva. Police officials said that once the
investigation is completed, it is up to the state attorney to
determine whether Nathan should stand trial.
   Nathan could face up to three years in prison for violating a
1986 law that bars Israelis from meeting with members of terror
groups. Israel considers the PLO a terror group.
   Nathan, who made millions selling hamburgers in Tel Aviv before
becoming a peace activist, said he didn't think he broke the law
because he met with Arafat to promote peace.
   As Nathan arrived at the police station, about 20 members of the
anti-Arab Kach movement waved an Israeli flag and shouted: ``A rope
for the traitor.'' Nathan turned to the demonstrators and tapped
his index finger against his temple to show he thought they were
stupid.
   Nathan said he requested a meeting with Prime Minister Yitzhak
Shamir to brief him on what Arafat said.
   Shamir said he would not see the activist, but told reporters
one of his assistants might receive Nathan.

<TEXT>
   George Bush took his patriotic road show to
this northwest Ohio community Friday, where some sponsors of the
local ``Flag City Festival'' complained that he turned the
non-partisan event into a Republican photo opportunity.
   The GOP presidential nominee told about 1,000 people waving
flags outside the Elks Lodge that ``the flag is back'' and rambled
into a paraphrase of the Pledge of Allegiance during his half-hour
speech.
   ``I wish the cynics around our country on the East Coast and
West Coast could be in Findlay today to see the outpouring of
patriotism,'' Bush said.
   ``I thrill to the site of the flag. I've seen it burned by
enemies abroad and scorned by the misguided in our country. And
I've seen it wrapped around the coffins of young men,'' he said.
   ``What is it all about? It's the symbol of these United States
of America, and to the liberty for which it stands, one nation
under God with freedom and justice for all. And let's never forget
it.''
   Neil Scott, a local businessman, protested in an interview that
``what was intended to be a non-partisan promotion of fun and
patriotism has turned into a partisan use of the flag for private
gain by a candidate.''
   Dean Fout, president of the North End Merchants Association,
also expressed annoyance that Bush would ``come charging in with `I
pledge allegience' and all that stuff, and take a lot of credit
away from us.''
   The event was conceived by local merchants to celebrate
patriotism and town spirit. Fout said Findlay officially calls
itself Flag City.
   Local Democrats planned to hold a ``pro-flag rally'' after
Bush's visit to ``promote the flag as a non-partisan symbol that
belongs to all of us,'' Scott said.

<TEXT>
   A National Institutes of Health advisory
committee recommended Friday that medical research using tissue
from intentionally aborted human fetuses receive federal backing.
   Although all the votes taken by the 21-member panel of outside
medical, ethical, religious and legal experts were tentative, the
panel's chairman acknowledged at a news conference that he could
not visualize a reversal of the fundamental recommendation.
   The vote to ``recommend that research proceed'' was 19-0 with
two abstentions.
   The recommendation sets up a possible confrontation with the
White House where one adviser to President Reagan has made clear he
wants to push for an executive order banning federal involvement in
such research. However, it remains unclear whether that stance by
adviser Gary Bauer has direct support from Reagan or other top
administration officials.
   Health and Human Services Secretary Otis R. Bowen told reporters
Thursday he has no intention of taking a position on the matter
until NIH officials have conducted a full review and said that
could take several months. Bowen said that while he is personally
opposed to abortion, the procedure is legal and suggested it would
be a ``waste'' not to use fetal tissue for treating Parkinson's and
similar diseases.
   Bowen also said it was unclear to him whether Bauer's memo
reflected Reagan's wishes of the adviser's own.
   The committee chairman, retired federal appeals Judge Arlin M.
Adams, defended the makeup of the panel, which has been criticized
by some anti-abortionists as being skewed in favor of allowing
fetal tissue research.
   Adams said he helped pick the panel and did so without knowledge
of the members' personal views on abortion.
   He said a reading of his own opinions while a judge would
reflect that he was ``very concerned about abortion.''
   ``I didn't know how I was going to vote until I had heard the
testimony,'' said Adams, who voted in favor of allowing the
research.
   Dr. Kenneth J. Ryan, head of the department of obstetrics and
gynecology at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston, acknowledged
that fundamental questions about the morality of abortion were ``in
the background hovering over us all the time.''
   Ryan, chairman of the scientific issues portion of the committee
meetings, said it was a testimony to the intellect of the committee
members that even some of those with personal reservations about
abortion were able to divorce those beliefs from the question of
whether the remains from legal abortions could ethically be used in
research.
   ``The key to the three-day meeting was ``can you divorce the
two,'' he said. ``It was a kind of tug of war whether you could or
could not divorce it.''
   After spending several hours Thursday night and most of the day
Friday discussing the fundamental question of whether it would be
acceptable ethically to use purposely aborted fetal tissue in
research, the panel was left little time to consider details of the
safeguards it concluded must accompany such a policy.
   It did reach agreement that ``a pregnant woman should not be
induced to terminate pregnancy in order to furnish fetal tissue for
transplantation or medical research.''
   It also agreed that the mother's decision to have an abortion
should be kept separate from her decision to allow the remains to
be used for research and that guidelines must be drawn to avoid
commercialization of fetal tissue, perhaps similar to the rules
governing the handling of hearts, kidneys and other organs used for
transplant.
   As part of those basic guidelines, the panel suggested that
anonymity be maintained between the donor and recipient and that
the timing and method of abortion not be influenced by potential
uses of the fetus for research.
   Although there was a distinct consensus on what safeguards the
committee wants to see in its final recommendations, most were not
put in writing.
   ``I'm not even sure what I voted on because I voted on so many
principles without words,'' said Georgetown University law
professor Patricia A. King.
   Her point, made with a smile, was not to complain about the
procedure but to embrace Adams' plan to have the committee staff
reduce the panel's work to writing as soon as possible to make sure
there were no misunderstandings before final votes are taken.
   Adams recessed the meeting late Friday until an unspecified
future date. He said the issues were too important to rush and that
the panel would have to meet again to finish its work in time to
make its formal and written recommendations to a standing NIH
advisory committee by Dec. 1.
   Neither Adams nor Ryan would be drawn into expressing their
views about assertions attributed to Bauer suggesting the panel's
work might have little bearing on Reagan's eventual decision on
whether to issue an executive order banning federal participation
in fetal tissue research.
   ``Because it's an election year, I think it's very difficult to
comment on why people do what they do,'' said Ryan.
   He did say that for the government to form an advisory committee
and then make a decision before the panel had completed its work
would ``fly in the face of the usefulness'' of appointing the
committee in the first place.

   A Findlay man sitting in a downtown
restaurant was arrested Friday after someone allegedly overheard
him making threatening remarks against Vice President George Bush,
police said.
   Bush, the Republican presidential nominee, campaigned in the
northwest Ohio city Friday morning.
   Police said Charles T. Rode Jr., 35, allegedly made threatening
comments about 9 a.m., shortly before Bush's arrival. Police and
Secret Service agents arrested Rode, who did not resist and was not
carrying a weapon, police said.
   He was held until Bush left the city and then was taken to the
Lucas County jail in Toledo, where he was being held without bond
Friday night on a charge of threatening the vice president.

   Police declined to comment Friday on the
death of a man captured after he and three other hijackers seized a
bus carrying 70 pilgrims to see Pope John Paul II.
   Three hijackers and a passenger were killed outright when police
stormed the bus Wednesday night and a second passenger died later
of his wounds.
   Several rescued hostages said the surviving gunman tried to
mingle with the passengers but was pointed out to police who seized
him. The witnesses said he did not appear to be seriously hurt.
   The government announced on Thursday that the man had died but
gave no details about the death, nor did it indicate why he died in
police custody a day after the gunfight.
   Several foreign journalists said they saw the man's body in a
hospital morgue and it appeared his throat had been cut and his jaw
smashed.
   The two slain passengers were a 14-year-old girl, killed
instantly, and a man, 55, who died Thursday. Officials said 21
other people were wounded by bullets and by shrapnel from the
hijackers' grenades.
   The hijackers had identified themselves as members of the
Lesotho Liberation Army and demanded a meeting with the pope and
King Moshoeshoe II. They said they were fighting to end military
rule in Lesotho.
   John Paul, touring southern Africa, left Lesotho Friday after a
36-hour stay marred by the hijacking and bad weather.
   Lesotho is surrounded by South Africa, and a special South
African police unit was asked to help deal with the hijackers.
Witnesses said Lesotho security forces took away the hijacker who
died later.

<HEAD>Heir To German Castle Finds There Is A Catch</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FERRYSBURG, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A businessman recently adopted by a
German baron has a kingsize worry: a $3 million mortgage that he
must repay by next month to keep a bank from seizing the family
castle.
   Richard Hemmelsbach, however, is confident that his plans to
turn the 1,428-year-old, 100-bedroom castle into a hotel will go
forward before the bank acts.
   ``We need to keep the castle in the family; that's where it
belongs,'' said Hemmelsbach, the owner of two small marketing
companies here.
   Hemmelsbach was adopted last month by the Baron Freiherr
Theodore von Liebieg after the heirless baron conducted a
nationwide search for an heir on the syndicated television show ``A
Current Affair.''
   The Hemmelsbach family and the baron's family had known each
other 40 years ago, after World War II, and the baron recognized
Hemmelsbach's name from among about 10,000 people who wrote asking
to inherit the castle.
   The new Baron Richard James von Liebieg Hemmelsbach said Friday
he is negotiating with a major U.S. hotel chain interested in
renovating a portion of the castle and turning it into a
first-class hotel, and he is confident a deal with the company
would secure the $3 million.
   If Hemmelsbach does not pay off the $3 million by Oct. 15, the
bank holding the mortgage will offer the estate to other parties
who have already expressed interest in buying it.
   ``We need to keep the castle in the family; that's where it
belongs,'' Hemmelsbach said.
   Von Liebieg, who lives about 15 miles from the castle, began his
search for an heir to maintain the deteriorating estate after the
bank recently repossessed it from a German businessman to whom von
Liebieg sold the castle 15 years ago.
   The businessman also had planned to turn the castle into a
hotel, but financial troubles forced him to abandon his plans,
Hemmelsbach said.
   The castle, reportedly the oldest in Germany, is located on the
banks of the Mosel River at the base of the Eifel mountains.
   Hemmelsbach would not name the company interested in developing
the property, but said several others and a group of investors were
waiting in the wings if the deal falls through. He said he believed
it would cost between $9 million and $12 million to renovate the
castle, which sits on 100 acres. He said the castle, accompanying
estate and vineyards are worth $10 million.
   Meanwhile, he is selling one of his marketing companies so he
can devote his time to raising funds and expect to make his third
trip to the castle within three weeks.
   ``It was love at first sight,'' Hemmelsbach said of the estate.

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The state Education Department says communities
are responsible for the education of children living within their
boundaries, even if they live in temporary shelters, state parks or
other temporary situations.
   The policy was issued Thursday after the Hingham School
Department refused to allow four children in a family living
temporarily in tents in Wompatuck State Park to attend Hingham
schools.
   Hingham School Superintendent Lewis J. Ernst had said the park
was considered to be under state jurisdiction and that town
taxpayers support school districts. Hingham is about 10 miles of
Boston on Hingham Bay.
   The children have been going to school this month in nearby
Norwell, where the school committee voted unanimously to let them
attend school without paying out-of-town tuition.
   State Education Commissioner Harold Raynolds Jr. said in a
statement that the law entitles all children to attend the public
schools in the towns in which they live.
   ``That law applies to children irrespective of their living
situation, whether they live with parents or other relatives in
foster homes or in temporary shelters or motels because they have
been displaced from their homes,'' he said.
   Edward Melikian, spokesman for the Education Department, said it
is up to John and Kitty Montgomery, who are living with five
children, four of school age, in three tents in the state park, to
decide whether to transfer the children from Norwell to Hingham
schools.
   The parents said they would like to keep the children in Norwell
schools.
   ``Norwell has been so incredibly gracious with our kids,'' said
Montgomery. The Montgomerys moved from Tucson, Ariz., in late
August to be near Mrs. Montgomery's father. While Montgomery has
found a job, and his wife also hopes to work, they have not found
affordable housing.

   Seabrook nuclear power plant officials
said Friday that preparations for low-power testing will begin
immediately following a Nuclear Regulatory Commission vote to clear
a major obstacle toward a license.
   But opponents declared the fight to stop Seabrook from operating
is far from over.
   At a news conference, Edward Brown, president of New Hampshire
Yankee, hailed Friday's NRC action as ``another major step forward
for Seabrook.''
   He said Seabrook will require about five weeks of preparation
before the plant would be ready to begin testing at 5 percent
power. Actual issuance of the license could take another four
weeks, and atomic tests could begin two weeks after that, he
estimated.
   The NRC, by a 4-0 vote, approved a rule change that emergency
sirens do not have to be in place before low-power testing begins,
but the commission left open the question of whether Seabrook's
owners are financially qualified to conduct the tests.
   ``I'll say without absolutely no qualification whatsoever there
is no hazard to public safety from low-power testing _ absolutely
none,'' Brown said in regard to the NRC decision to allow the
testing without sirens.
   Opponents, however, denounced the NRC vote as weakening
protections to the public.
   ``The decision again shows the Reagan-Bush administration is so
blindly committed to getting Seabrook on line that public
protection doesn't matter,'' said Rep. Edward J. Markey, D-Mass.
   ``The administration has placed the short-term economic
interests of one utility ahead of the long-term health and safety
of citizens living around the plant. Its goal is to get this plant
plugged in and turned on before Nov. 8 so that no one can turn it
off later.''
   Brown denied there was a connection between Seabrook's plans and
the November election, saying the timing is ``pure coincidence.''
   Massachusetts Gov. Michael S. Dukakis, the Democratic
presidential nominee, has been a longtime opponent of Seabrook. He
denounced the latest decision in a prepared statement saying, ``The
NRC _ the Not Responsible Commission _ is experiencing a meltdown
in its thinking process.''
   Regarding Seabrook's finances, Brown predicted that a final
agreement will be in place within several weeks to cover payments
being skipped by the owner of the fourth largest Seabrook share,
Massachusetts Municipal Wholesale Electric Co.
   Brown also said he doubts that the bankruptcy judge overseeing
Public Service's reorganization would block low-power testing once
he ``hears the facts on low-power and not the myths.''
   However, Tom Moughan, of Citizens Within The 10-Mile Radius,
said NRC's decision to deal with financial questions later means
the fight isn't over.
   ``We think the public needs to understand that the full-power
(license) possibilities are distant still,'' he said.

   Michael Dukakis pledged Friday to double the number of federal

on narcotics. George Bush ridiculed Dukakis' attempts to portray
himself as a defense-minded candidate.
   ``You cannot fool the Soviet leadership by knocking America's
defense for 10 years and then riding around in a tank for 10
minutes,'' the vice president said, referring to his Democratic
rival's visit earlier in the week to a tank design facility in
Michigan. ``You can't fool the American people.''
   Bush played tough in his television commercials, as well, airing
an advertisement in Dukakis' home state of Massachusetts that
accused him of failing to clean up polluted Boston Harbor.
   The vice president headed for Washington after a three-city tour
of Ohio, while Dukakis was flying home to Massachusetts on Saturday
night. Both men have set aside large parts of next week to prepare
for their first debate of the fall presidential campaign, a
90-minute nationally televised session a week from Sunday in
Winston-Salem, N.C.
   Democrat Dukakis has spent much of the week trying to regain the
momentum in the race for the White House, and his tough anti-crime
speech in a visit to the Los Angeles Police Academy was part of
that effort.
   In what has become the standard made-for-television element of
every campaign day, he observed officer Jerry Mulford demonstrate
``cover and concealment'' tactics at a simulated street scene.
Mulford ducked behind wooden boxes and a brick wall and fired at
various moving and pop-up targets. Normally, live ammunition is
used in such exercises, but the Secret Service protecting Dukakis
vetoed that idea.
   Dukakis said he would assign the first 100 new drug agents to
Southern California. And he said he would double the total number
of agents nationally over the next five years.
   ``We are going to hire the state and local law enforcement
officers the money to fight the war,'' he said. ``We are not going
to try to nickel and dime you to death, as this administration has
done.''
   Aides said he was prepared to spend $50 million to hire new
agents next year toward a five-year goal of 2,800 agents, although
a fact sheet issued to reporters said the cost of the agents would
be offset by seized drug profits.
   Aides also said Dukakis was committed to hiring 800 additional
federal prosecutors.
   ``We're going to send a message to drug kingpins,'' he said.
``As far as Mike Dukakis is concerned, there's nowhere you can run;
there's nowhere you can sail; there's nowhere you can hide; there
will be no safe haven for dope peddlers and drug profits anywhere
on this earth.''
   But while making an appearance at a Chula Vista, Calif., police
station, Dukakis was greeted by pro-Bush demonstrators, some
wearing striped mock prison uniforms and chanting, ``Let me out,
I'll kill again.'' The chant referred to the Massachusetts
governor's furlough program, since modified, that enabled a
convicted killer to go to another state and rape a woman.
   Other demonstrators recited the Pledge of Allegiance in a dig at
Dukakis' veto of a constitutionally doubtful bill requiring
Massachusetts teachers to lead students in the pledge.
   Bush used his first news conference in two weeks to try and
blunt some of the work Dukakis did earlier in the week to buttress
his own defense credentials. He opened with a statement saying the
tank Dukakis rode in ``did not fit.''
   Later, he said, ``He's gone to states like this, found that his
message of .. cutting unilaterally on these weapons systems is not
popular and so now he's been made over. He's coming out with
policies quite different, but which ones do you believe?''
   Dukakis delivered a speech in Washington earlier this week in
which he renewed his opposition to some weapons, but pledged
support for others and criticized the Reagan administration for not
devoting enough attention to tanks and other conventional weapons.
   The vice president, who has moved up markedly in the polls in
the last few weeks, acknowledged that some of his aides do not want
him to take questions from reporters for fear it would distract
from campaign themes he stresses in his other appearances. ``It's
just some lower-level hand-wringers who think I'm going to screw
up,'' he said.
   Bush campaigned at a Buckeye Steel mill in Ohio, where he noted
his grandfather, Samuel Prescott Bush, was one of the firm's
founders. In a speech seemingly aimed at Democrats who voted for
Reagan in 1980 and 1984 _ a key bloc of voters in the industrial
Midwest _ Bush stressed his opposition to gun control and abortion
and his support for prayer in schools and capital punishment.
   Bush also rambled into a paraphrase of the pledge during a
flag-draped appearance in Findlay, Ohio, where he paid tribute to
the American flag. ``It's the symbol of these United States of
America, and to the liberty for which it stands, one nation under
God with freedom and justice for all. And let's never forget it,''
he said.
   In Washington, members of the Dukakis campaign, the Democratic
National Committee and Jesse Jackson's National Rainbow Coalition
stressed unity during a news conference in which they announced a
stepped-up registration and get-out-the-vote effort.
   Joseph Warren, the general election coordinator for the Dukakis
campaign, said the drive targets 42 cities in 14 states. The
Democratic Party will ``take the lead'' in the campaign, which will
try to register 2 million new voters and win 70 percent black voter
participation in the Nov. 8 election.
   Bush's appearance in Findlay at a Flag City Festival drew
criticism from some of the event's organizers who said they had
intended it to be a non-partisan event.
   The campaign understudies were hunting votes, as well.
   Republican vice presidential candidate Dan Quayle poked fun at
himself and the controversy that has dogged him. ``Sometimes they
tell you to go to your room,'' the 41-year-old Indiana senator said
of his aides, some of whom are older than he is.
   Democrat Lloyd Bentsen criticized Bush for having a ``bad case
of laryngitis'' when it comes to leadership.

   Martin Sheen called off a protest Thursday
aimed at Michael Dukakis after state Assemblyman Tom Hayden
intervened and arranged a meeting between the actor-activist and
the candidate over his stand on a grape boycott.
   The Massachusetts governor was in town to attend a fund-raiser
and a celebrity summit at the home of television producer Norman
Lear.
   A spokeswoman for Sheen, who supports the United Farm Workers'
protest of allegedly dangerous pesticides on California grapes,
called local news agencies more than four hours ahead of time to
announce the protest outside Lear's house.
   Valerie Sklarevsky, the spokeswoman, said Sheen and UFW members
and supporters wanted Dukakis to clarify his stance on the grape
boycott and would be picketing.
   About an hour later, Ms. Sklarevsky called back and said the
protest was called off because Hayden talked to Sheen and arranged
a private meeting with the actor and Dukakis.
   ``He (Sheen) was told it wouldn't look good,'' Ms. Sklarevsky
said.
   Actress Morgan Fairchild said Thursday the celebrities attending
the political pow-wow would discuss strategies on getting their
candidate elected president and what they could do to help.
   Don Johnson, Gregory Peck, Chevy Chase, Goldie Hawn, Ally
Sheedy, Rob Lowe and Burgess Meredith were expected to attend, said
Dee Dee Myers, a Dukakis spokeswoman.
   ``These are people who want to get out and work for Mike
Dukakis; roll up their sleeves and get Michael Dukakis and Lloyd
Bentsen elected,'' Ms. Myers said.

   Democratic candidate Michael Dukakis promised
Friday to double the number of drug enforcement agents and vowed
``there will be no safe haven for dope peddlers and drug profits
anywhere on this earth.''
   The Massachusetts governor delivered a tough anti-crime speech
during an appearance at the Los Angeles Police Academy, where he
observed a training exercise on a simulated city street called
Hogan's Alley.
   While Dukakis stood a few feet away, Officer Jerry Mulford
demonstrated ``cover and concealment'' tactics, ducking behind
wooden boxes and a brick wall and fired at various moving and
pop-up targets.
   Trainees usually use live ammunition in such exercises, but the
Secret Service vetoed the practice during Dukakis' visit.
   In his speech, Dukakis told police recruits that the Reagan
administration was trying to ``nickel and dime you to death'' by
cutting funds for drug enforcement.
   ``We're going to give the state and local law enforcement
officers the money they need to fight this war,'' he said.
   ``You're the ones who take the risks, you're the ones who make
the busts, you're the ones who bear the costs of this war and you
deserve the best equipment and the best communications and the best
training we can give you,'' Dukakis said.
   In a later appearance at a Chula Vista, Calif., police station,
Dukakis was greeted by demonstrators who needled the Massachusetts
governor for his since-modified prison furlough policy and for his
veto on constitutial grounds of a bill requiring teachers to lead
students in the Pledge of Allegiance.
   One group wore mock prison uniforms and chanted, ``Let me out,
I'll kill again,'' and another carried pro-George Bush signs and
recited the pledge.
   Dukakis said at the police academy he would double the number of
Drug Enforcement Administration efforts over the next five years
and added, ``We're going to send the first 100 of those new agents
here to South California.''
   He said the cost of the new agents would be more than covered by
the increased revenue in seized drug profits.
   Dukakis aides quoted DEA estimates that each agent seized an
average of $259,000 in drug profits in 1987, more than double what
it cost to keep them in the field.
   Dukakis also pledged to hire 800 more federal prosecutors and to
``wage an all-out effort to hunt down, to freeze and to seize drug
profits wherever we can find them.''
   ``We're going to send a message to drug kingpins,'' he said.
``As far as Mike Dukakis is concerned, there's nowhere you can run,
there's nowhere you can sail, there's nowhere you can hide. There
will be no safe haven for dope peddlers and drug profits anywhere
on this earth.''
   Republican presidential nominee George Bush has criticized
Dukakis for his refusal to endorse Bush's proposal for imposing the
death penalty on drug kingpins.
   Dukakis continued his drug war theme during a Mexican
Independence Day celebration at Roosevelt High School in East Los
Angeles, an area with a large Mexican-American population.
   There he told students that under the Reagan administration ``at
one point, it got so bad, that agents of the Drug Enforcement
Administration had to have a bake sale to raise money to finance
drug stakeout operations.''
   However, aides said afterword that the bake sale, described in a
book by Elaine Shannon entitled ``Desperado,'' was to raise money
for drug education programs.
   ``We need a president in this country who will make a difference
and not excuses,'' he told a cheering crowd composed mostly of
students.
   ``I hope many of you will become the future political leaders of
this country,'' he said.
   Hispanics make up 23 percent of the population of California,
but only 8 percent of the registered voters.

   Iraq on Friday refused to receive a U.N.
team to investigate allegations that it used outlawed poison gas
against its Kurdish minority.
   Acting Ambassador Ali Mahmoud Sumaida delivered the Iraqi
government's formal rejection Friday night to U.N.
Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar.
   ``The response was negative,'' Sumaida told reporters after his
meeting. ``We declined to receive such a mission because there is
no basis for evidence (for such a mission).''
   He said that reports by a Turkish team of experts and the
Turkish Red Crescent _ Turkey's equivalent of the Red Cross _ did
not provide sufficient evidence to warrant dispatching a team of
investigators.
   At least a dozen nations, including the United States, Britain
and Nordic countries had urged the secretary-general to send a team
to investigate the charges that Iraq was using chemical warfare
against Kurdish rebels.
   Iraq has said, however, that foreign journalists were welcome to
investigate although the United Nations was not welcome.
   No immediate response came from the secretary-general. The
United Nations is circumspect when the soveignty of a member is
involved, however, and it is unlikely the world organization would
consider sending an investigatory team lacking cooperation by the
host country.

   Fires in Yellowstone
National Park picked up again Friday, but fire officials were
confident moisture from storms last weekend and work since then
would prevent the fires from growing.
   ``This week, I think they're fairly confident, with the measures
they've taken during the early part of this week, that they'll be
able to hold the fires,'' said fire information officer Linda
Miller. ``I think they're fairly confident that they won't have any
major problems.''
   The fires, which now form one huge blaze, have affected 1.1
million acres of the 2.2 million-acre park. But according to new
infrared scans, they have burned only about 50 percent to 60
percent of the land within fire perimeters.
   Park officials said the fires remained inside fire perimeters
Friday.
   ``I don't think anything slopped over any lines,'' said park
spokeswoman Sonya Capek.
   Temperatures in the park only reached the mid-60s and steady
winds approached 35 mph. The weather forecast offered some good
news for Saturday, with a chance of light snowshowers in the
afternoon and temperatures in the 50s. The storm also could bring
some heavy winds, but Capek said the high humidity and cold
temperatures will keep the fires down.
   Firefighters had taken advantage of the wet, cold weather
earlier in the week to strengthen existing lines around fires and
extend lines and by Friday had contained 50 percent of the
335,500-acre North Fork fire, the most troublesome of the blazes in
the park.
   Blazes also burned Friday in Montana, Idaho, Oregon and
Washington state as the worst fire season in 30 years continued.
More than 4 million acres, including 2.1 million acres in Alaska,
have gone up in smoke.
   Denny Bungarz, North Fork fire incident commander, said
officials believe it would take seven days of continued dry weather
before Yellowstone would return to the tinder-dry conditions that
allowed fires to grow by thousands of acres daily.
   And 700 Marines from Camp Pendleton in California reached the
park Friday to help with firefighting efforts, bringing the
military force in the country's first national park to 4,100.
   Thirty Canadian firefighters arrived Friday, the first Canadian
crew to arrive since the U.S. Forest Service accepted that
country's offer to help.
   Firefighters had contained 70 percent of the 413,380-acre Clover
Mist fire in the park's northeastern corner. That leaves the Wolf
Lake fire, on the northeast edge of the North Fork, as the only
fire where containment figures were below 50 percent. Firefighters
had contained 8 percent of that blaze.
   To the south, officials in the Bridger-Teton National Forest
declared the 225,500-acre Huck-Mink complex of fires fully
contained.
   Wildfires continued to burn in most of Idaho's national forests
Friday, and fire bosses welcomed a weekend forecast of cooler,
wetter weather.
   ``I don't know if we're over the hump as far as the fire season
goes, but we've been saying we're guardedly optimistic,'' said
Sandi Sacher, an information officer at the Boise Interagency Fire
Center.
   Fires that so far had consumed more than 190,000 acres remained
out of control and outside wilderness boundaries in the Nez Perce,
Challis, Panhandle and Salmon national forests, Ms. Sacher said.
   Restrictions on the use of several national forests in western
Montana were lifted Friday.
   ``We had enough moisture (so that) we dropped down to a
moderate'' fire danger, said Bob Krepps of the Forest Service.
   Meanwhile, a fire in Glacier National Park had grown about 2,000
acres by Friday, and in west-central Montana hundreds of soldiers
helped crews mop up the 247,000-acre Canyon Creek blaze.

<TEXT>
   The 1988 Summer Olympics, the largest
and most tightly guarded in history, began in a blaze of pageantry
Saturday as marchers in traditional Korean costumes entered the
main stadium to the beat of a ``dragon drum.''
   About 70,000 spectators in the Olympic Stadium and up to a
billion television viewers around the world watched the spectacular
show that began at 10:30 a.m. (8:30 p.m. EDT Friday) in sunny
weather.
   It was the first Olympic opening ceremony with a prelude outside
the main stadium. Before the performances in the Olylmpic Stadium,
a flotilla of 458 boats sailed by on the Han River adjacent to the
stadium.
   The theme of the three-hour extravaganza, with 13,000
performers, was ``Beyond All Barriers'' _ a phrase stressing the
Seoul Games as a stage for the first East-West competitions at the
Summer Olympics in 12 years.
   Political boycotts had marred the 1980 Moscow Games and the Los
Angeles competition four years ago.
   About 160 countries sent nearly 10,000 athletes to the Games to
compete for 237 gold medals, making these 16-day Games the
best-attended ever by competitors.
   South Korean security forces ringing the stadium and on alert
across the nation were on guard against terrorism. Officals called
the measures the most extensive ever to protect a sports event.
   Greece led the parade of teams, a tradition honoring the country
as the site of the ancient Olympics.
   Teams marched according to the Korean alphabet, with Ghana
second in the procession. As the host nation, South Korea was last.
   Most teams were garbed in matching jackets and pants or skirts,
but African delegations wore native garb of flowing robes with
colorful print patterns.
   The processions seemed less formal than at past Olympics opening
ceremonies. Some teams broke ranks to wave to the cheering crowd.
An American athlete carried a sign proclaiming, ``Hi, Mom, I'm
Here.''
   The teams gathered on the infield after circling the running
track. The march route took them past the seating area for
dignitaries, including South Korean President Roh Tae-woo and Juan
Antonio Samaranch, president of the International Olympic Committee.
   Before the teams marched in, a chorus sang an ancient seafaring
ballad, and thousands of blue and white balloons floated skyward. A
replica of the huge dragon drum used in ancient Korean ceremonies
was transfered from ship to shore then carried to the stadium.
   Huge balloons were released from a Shindan Tree, sacred in
Korean mythology, and then the Olympic flame was revealed on a
72-foot pedestal resembling a traditional Korean candleholder.
   Korean dancers in Greek tunics and flowing gowns danced and
whirled as silver-colored confetti rained down from the sky.
   ``I believe God is blessing my country for its years of hard
work and preparation,'' said Yuk Hee-Jin, 17, a spectator. ``I'm
really proud of my country. The whole world will now know more
about Korea.''
   The opening ceremonies, as conceived, planned, practiced and
practiced again, were designed by the Games' hosts to portray the
Eastern philosophies of harmony and balance _ factors long-wanting
in Korea's tumultuous history.
   Planners drew from the concept of Yin and Yang, the symbol on
the Korean flag that is also a major Oriental philosophy. Yin and
Yang represent opposing forces that come together in a bond of
harmony and friendship.
   So the script for the Olympic opener mixed the Yin of the old
and the Yang of the new.
   Music for the show came from ancient Korean drums and wind
instruments as well as a synthesizer that pumped out modern pieces
composed by contemporary Korean artists.
   The Koreans invited dancers from 60 nations to participate in
the program of native dances from Hungary, Peru, Senegal, Saudi
Arabia, the United States and other nations.
   Music to accompany the marchers was composed from folk music of
the various nations.
   The Koreans also sought to keep harmony among the nations
marching in the opening ceremony. Plans to limit the number in the
process were quickly scrapped after protests from several
countries, including the United States.
   And while the program called for women in flowing white robes to
march in front of the delegations carrying signs with each nation's
name, Iran was granted its wish that a man front their team because
of the Moslem nation's strict fundamentalist tenets that forbid
women from such public displays.
   On Friday, a runner carried the Olympic torch to City Hall in a
snowstorm of confetti, streamers and balloons.
   The torch relay began Aug. 23 in Olympia, Greece, site of the
ancient Olympics.
   Elsewhere in the capital, hundreds of radicals staged
anti-Olympic protests at three universities Friday. They burned the
U.S. flag and an effigy of President Reagan and yelled ``Down with
the dictators' Olympics!'' Onlookers shouted at them as riot police
watched from a distance.
   In the protests, radicals, some of them armed with firebombs and
clubs, demanded the Olympics be shared with communist North Korea
and charged the Games were being used to cement authoritarian rule
in South Korea.
   North Korea declared again Friday that the Seoul government is
using the Games to further divide the Korean peninsula.
   The two Koreas have been divided since the end of World War II
and fought the Korean War in 1950-53.

   Israeli troops and allied South Lebanon
Army militiamen backed by helicopter gunships mounted a two-pronged
assault against Shiite moslem and leftist guerrillas in south
Lebanon on Friday, police reported.
   A police spokesman said at least three Lebanese villagers were
wounded and more than 10 houses sustained severe damage in the
attack. It was apparently aimed at blunting increased guerrilla
activity against Israel.
   At least two helicopter gunships flew several strafing runs in
the fields around the two villages attacked, said the spokesman,
who cannot be identified under standing regulations.
   A police spokesman said troops and militiamen in 14 armored cars
and armored personnel carriers rolled into the Shiite Moslem
village of Mimes, three miles north of the security zone, at 4:30
p.m. (9:30 a.m. EDT).
   Another force of 15 armored cars and armored personnel carriers
attacked simultaneously the Shiite village of Ain Atta in the
foothills of Mount Hermon, five miles north of the border enclave,
the spokesman said.
   The spokesman, who cannot be identified under standing
regulations, said at least 250 troops and militiamen were taking
part in the operation.
   In Israel, an army spokesman said he knew nothing about the
attack.
   It came only a day after Syrian Defense Minister Gen. Mustafa
Tlas inspected Syrian army forward positions in the western Bekaa
valley, about three miles from the targets of the Israeli attack.
   The attacking force appeared to be searching for Iranian-backed
Shiite guerrillas and Syrian-backed leftists who have lately been
active against the security zone from the slopes of Mount Hermon,
the spokesman said.

   Television commercials still were inviting
viewers to ``come back to Jamaica'' on Tuesday when a Madison
Avenue advertising executive managed to get a telex from Kingston
to his home office.
   ``Emergency conditions. Total devastation. ... Cancel all TV and
print advertising. Appeal as a national disaster.''
   Account supervisor Edward Daley's dramatic cable to Young &
Rubicam Inc. was one of the first attempts by the tourism industry
to deal with the devastation wrought by Hurricane Gilbert, the
century's strongest storm.
   There were few attempts at boosterism Thursday as tourism
officials attempted to assess the damage and help stranded tourists
get home.
   Travel agents, tour operators and airline spokesmen said they
were offering rebookings or refunds to anyone who had booked trips
for this week or this weekend. For trips farther into the future,
policies varied.
   A surprising number of tourists did not want to reschedule.

   Even as one of the worst hurricanes of the
century smashes through the Gulf of Mexico, a scientist is warning
that the so-called greenhouse effect could result in even stronger
tropical storms.
   Dr. Kerry A. Emanuel of the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology said Thursday the strongest hurricanes of the future
could turn out to be even more powerful than storms such as
Hurricane Gilbert.
   Hurricanes gain their strength from the energy transferred from
the warm ocean waters to the air and clouds above. Warmer
temperatures caused by the greenhouse effect could lead to more
evaporation and heat transfer from the oceans, and thus, possibly
stronger storms, he explained.

   With Americans in Panama facing both real and
potential problems, the United States has decided to reduce its
diplomat presence in the troubled country but will keep the
American military command at full strength, State Department
officials said.
   The decision was taken at the advice of Ambassador Arthur Davis
and could lead to the closing or the severe reduction of regional
operations of the Drug Enforcement Administration, the Justice
Department and the U.S. Customs Service, three officials told The
Associated Press on Thursday.
   They stressed there would be no cutbacks in the U.S. Southern
Command or in the Panama Canal Commission, although other
administration sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said
some of the extra security personnel sent to Panama last spring
would be withdrawn gradually.

   Ignoring a lawmaker's plea to ``show how tough

killed for this year an attempt to force Americans to wait a week
before buying a handgun.
   By a 228-182 bipartisan vote Thursday, the House eliminated from
an anti-drug bill a seven-day waiting period along with an optional
police background check of the purchaser.
   The vote substituted a plan _ to be devised by the Justice

   Top U.S. officials are for the first time
talking seriously about removing military bases from the
Philippines, and the chief Philippines negotiator says the country
is preparing for such a possibility but still negotiating.
   Secretary of State George P. Shultz said Thursday the United
States wants to keep giant Clark Air Base and Subic Navy Base and
other installations in the Philippines but ``there are alternatives
which we are having now to examine.''
   Shultz said talks in Manila on bases compensation and other

   Federal investigators say the engines from the
Delta Air Lines jetliner that crashed last month in Texas show no
evidence of mechanical failure _ a finding that is focusing more
attention on possible pilot error.
   The National Transportation Safety Board said Thursday the
evidence shows ``that all engines (on the plane) were running as
commanded and capable of producing full power at the time of
impact.''
   Early speculation after the Aug. 31 crash at Dallas-Fort Worth
International Airport, in which 14 of 108 people aboard Delta
Flight 1141 died, was possible engine failure because witnesses
reported fire coming from an engine.

   Mikhail S. Gorbachev said Friday that Soviet
forces will abandon a strategic naval base in Vietnam if the United
States pulls its armed forces from bases in the Philippines.
   In a key foreign policy speech, the Soviet leader announced that
the Kremlin has frozen its nuclear weapon stocks in Soviet Asia. He
also responded to U.S. allegations that a Siberian radar violates a
superpower arms treaty by suggesting the station be used to study
space.
   Gorbachev made the 1{-hour speech during a meeting with
Communist Party and local government workers in the city of
Krasnoyarsk, 2,000 miles east of Moscow and the site of the
controversial radar. The official Tass news agency carried a
summary.
   A seven-point plan ``aimed at strengthening security in the
Asia-Pacific region,'' highlighted the speech, the first major
address by Gorbachev since he returned Monday from a six-week
vacation.

   President Reagan said Friday he is ready to
study Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev's proposal for a mutual
superpower base-closing in the Pacific, but said the United States
should proceed cautiously.
   Making clear that ``I haven't had an opportunity to go into it
in detail,'' Reagan told reporters he remains interested in doing
``anything we can'' to improve U.S.-Soviet relations.
   But in an allusion to how people sometimes get cheated at
card-playing, he said, ``As I have frequently said to him
(Gorbachev), `Trust everybody, but cut the cards.'''
   In a brief exchange with reporters at the conclusion of
swearing-in ceremonies for Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady,
Reagan did not elaborate on the U.S. government's reaction to
Gorbachev's proposal that the Soviets close their key base at Cam
Ranh Bay in Vietnam in exchange for a closure of U.S. bases in the
Philippines.
   But chief spokesman Marlin Fitzwater earlier had voiced
skepticism about the proposal earlier, saying ``were somewhat
pessimistic.''

   Senate Democrats offered Friday to expand
slightly an existing subminimum wage for full-time students to head
off what they called a ``hire 'em and fire 'em'' 90-day training
wage backed by Republicans.
   Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., offered an amendment to his
bill raising the minimum wage from its current $3.35 an hour to
$4.55 an hour by 1991 that would allow employers to hire up to 12
students instead of the six now allowed for up to 20 hours a week
at 85 percent of the minimum wage.
   Only about 100,000 students are now earning the $2.85 subminimum
wage, according to Labor Department officials, compared with
515,000 students in 1978. Kennedy said his proposal would allow
employers to double the number of students at the subminimum wage
on their payrolls.
   The tactic was aimed at heading off a Republican amendment by
Sen. Orrin Hatch of Utah to establish an 80 percent training wage
for newly hired workers for up to 90 days.

   A National Institutes of Health advisory
committee recommended Friday that medical research using tissue
from intentionally aborted human fetuses receive federal backing.
   Although all the votes taken by the 21-member panel of outside
medical, ethical, religious and legal experts were tentative, the
panel's chairman acknowleded at a news conference that he could not
visiualize a reversal of the fundamental recommendation.
   The vote to ``recommend that research proceed'' was 19-0 with
two abstentions.
   The committee chairman, retired federal appeals Judge Arlin M.
Adams, defended the makeup of the panel, which has been criticized
by some anti-abortionists as being skewed in favor of allowing
fetal tissue research.
   Adams said he helped pick the panel and did so without knowledge

   Bush struck at the heart of Dukakis' candidacy _ his stewardship
of Massachusetts during its economic boom _ with a speech Thursday
that selectively used statistics to point out chinks in the state
financial record but that also gave a misleading characterization
of the state's tax picture.
   ``You can pretty much do what you want with selected

   Iraqi warplanes fired poison gas at
Kurdish civilians trapped in a mountain ravine and killed 2,400, a
Kurdish rebel spokesman said Friday.
   Word of the alleged slaughter on Aug. 30 was delayed because it
took the handful of survivors 10 days to reach southern Turkey and
contact rebel officials, the spokesman for the Kurdistan Democratic
Party reported.
   The spokesman said the survivors were fleeing an Iraqi military
offensive by trekking to Turkey.
   He spoke to The Associated Press in Nicosia by telephone from a
West European city. The official, known to the AP, asked that his
name and location not be disclosed for ``security reasons.''
   There was no independent confirmation of the reported gas
attack. The spokesman said the casualties raised the number of
Kurds killed by Iraqi chemical weapons since early August to about
4,300.

   Archaeologists work side by

Yellowstone National Park that have been threatened not only by
fire but by the bulldozers sent in to halt them.
   Officials say they may never know just how many sites of old
Indian settlements and traces of early white explorers have
succumbed to the flames that have devastated nearly half the
country's oldest national park.
   ``The problem in Yellowstone is that very, very little of the
park has had an intense archaeological survey,'' said Sonya Capek,
a park cultural resource specialist.
   Lack of funds has prevented archaeologists from studying more
than 1 percent of the huge park closely, said Capek. She said only
5 percent to 10 percent of the park has had any kind of
archaeological survey, even a windshield review from someone in a
vehicle.

   The Social Democrats, who have
dominated Sweden's government for 56 years, on Sunday face their
first election challenge since Prime Minister Olof Palme was shot
in 1986.
   The governing party was expected to win the most votes, but it
would take only a slight shift in voting patterns to break their
majority hold on the 349-seat Riksdag, or parliament.
   Polls showed the Social Democrats, who control 159 seats in the
unicameral legislature, have lost crucial support to the
environmentalist Greens, who now hold no seats in parliament.
   The small, activist party has been spurred by recent polls
showing up to 10 percent of voter support. It could tilt the
balance of power by winning the minimum 4 percent of the national
vote a party must have to sit in parliament.
   Prime Minister Ingvar Carlsson, 53, whose Social Democrats rely
on the Communist Party to make up a majority, said he would rather
call another election to stay in office than be forced to rely on
the Greens.

   Liberace's ex-lover provided some of the new
evidence tying a Hollywood drug dealer to the 1981 Laurel Canyon
slayings, for which the late sex-film star John Holmes once was
tried, the Los Angeles Times reported Friday.
   Scott Thorson, 29, who was Liberace's companion from 1977 to
1982, helped authorities build their case against nightclub owner
and convicted cocaine trafficker Adel Nasrallah in the four Laurel
Canyon beating deaths, the Times said, citing unidentified sources.
   The killings allegedly were in revenge for a cash and drug
robbery of Nasrallah, authorities have said, and Holmes admitted
bringing the assailants to the Laurel Canyon home.
   Holmes, like Liberace, died of acquired immune deficiency
syndrome.
   Nasrallah, 59, who went by the name Eddie Nash, and former
bodyguard Gregory DeWitt Diles, 40, were charged Sept. 8 with four
counts of murder and one of attempted murder. They are being held
without bail and face possible death penalties if convicted.

<HEAD>Norwegians in Dispute over Report that Seals are Skinned Alive</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHAN RAPP</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>OSLO, Norway (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A report that some hunters are skinning
seals alive has touched off a bitter dispute in Norway, where
hunters and fishermen say seal killing is crucial to their way of
life.
   Odd F. Lindberg, an author and photographer who sailed as a
government-appointed inspector on a hunting boat east of Greenland
last spring, said in his report that seals were not only skinned
alive but killed in deliberately ``sadistical ways.''
   The report came as authorities sought to ease controls on seal
killing, because fisherman complain that thousands of the animals
have invaded Norway's northern coast, eating fish and damaging nets.
   ``Since my report I have received at least 100 telephone
threats, with some saying they are going to tear my limbs off,''
said Lindberg.
   The Ministry of Fisheries, which employed Lindberg to do the
inspection, refuses to accept his report.
   ``It may be that he (Lindberg) believes he has seen things that
he has not seen,'' said Trond S. Paulsen, a senior ministry
official. The ministry has no plans to take action on his report,
he said.
   But the report drew widespread sympathy for seals following a
summer of death for the animals further south. A distemper virus
killed 13,000 seals along the coasts of Denmark, Norway, Sweden,
the Netherlands and West Germany since April.
   Norway's leading newspaper, Aftenposten, devoted its front page
to a color picture it said was taken by Lindberg of a seal pup in
the water being clubbed with the blunt side of a long spiked pole.
   Killing pups in the water is prohibited, and it would appear
from the photo that the hunter had apparently missed a clean kill
on the head.
   In the 1970s, the French actress Birgitte Bardot, Greenpeace and
other environmental organizations successfully campaigned against
seal slaughter here and in Canada.
   Their campaign led to a 1983 ban by the European Economic
Community on imports of seal skins, a heavy blow to the seal
hunters whose main market was the European fur industry.
   After the EEC import ban, the Canadian government banned the
killing of seal pups, which are coveted for their white coats.
   Norway's seal hunting fleet dwindled from about 50 vessels to
five and the catch was cut from several hundred thousand seals a
year to a quota of less than 40,000.
   However, disgruntled seal hunters now see the chance for a
comeback.
   Later this year, the EEC will start talks on the possibilities
of either lifting the ban or making it permanent. A decision is
expected next year.
   Last year's seal invasion softened public opinion in Norway.
Fishermen complained they could lose their livelihoods if the seals
were allowed to continue to eat their catch and destroy their nets.
   ``We count on the import ban being changed,'' said spokesman Jan
Lauritson at the Ministry of Fisheries. ``There are no logical,
scientific grounds for it.''
   Norway hunts seals during the spring in waters east of Greenland
and in the Barents Sea, north of the Soviet Union.
   Lindberg was one of three inspectors assigned this year to make
sure the killings were carried out according to detailed rules,
intended to minimize the animals' suffering. He spent from
mid-March to mid-April aboard a seal hunt vessel off Greenland.
   Lindberg said he turned in his report to the Ministry of
Fisheries at the beginning of July and that it created ``panic.''
   ``The animals are rarely checked to see if they have been
fatally shot,'' the report said, ``and are often alive when they
are hoisted aboard. As a result it often happens that the animal is
skinned while growling, its eyes pleading and its mouth snapping at
you.''
   He said he had seen animals that appeared to be dead but ``woke
up'' while being skinned.
   Before releasing Lindberg's report Sept. 2, the ministry issued
a statement saying a committee of experts had found Lindberg ``not
trustworthy.''
   Other inspectors made no such complaints, said Paulsen.
   Officials said no formal qualifications are needed to be an
inspector, but that they usually employ biologists, students and
researchers. They said Lindberg had offered to do the job without
pay.
   Lindberg, 43, has specialized in conditions for marine mammals
in polar areas.

<HEAD>Nationalist Chinese Military Assailed as Too Powerful</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ANNIE HUANG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Nationalist Chinese military, long the
backbone of the government, is under attack by critics who contend
it remains too powerful at a time of easing tensions with rival
communist China.
   Emboldened by the relaxed political atmosphere on Taiwan after
nearly four decades of authoritarian rule, some Taiwanese claim the
military abuses its power despite the lifting of martial law here a
year ago.
   Newspapers, which customarily hushed up any allegations of
military wrongdoing in the past, now give wide coverage to the
charges of abuses.
   The Nationalist government and armed forces led by Chiang
Kai-shek fled to Taiwan in 1949 after losing a civil war to the
communists on the mainland and remain technically at war with
Beijing.
   China still regards Taiwan as a renegade province but has not
launched a significant military action since 1958, when communist
forces fired hundreds of thousands of artillery shells at two tiny
Nationalist-held offshore islands, Quemoy and Matsu.
   ``Soldiers used to be admired for defending the country with
their lives,'' said legislator Chang Shih-liang of the governing
Nationalist Party. ``But with the absence of wars for so long,
people began to question what they have been doing.''
   A central figure in the controversy is Taiwan's only four-star
general, Hau Pei-tsun, head of the general chiefs of staff since
1981 and one of those who came to Taiwan after the communists won
the mainland in 1949.
   Hau, who commands Taiwan's half a million troops, was praised
for ensuring a peaceful transfer of power after the death in
January of President Chiang Ching-kuo, the son of Chiang Kai-shek,
who lifted martial law despite his strong ties to the military.
   But critics argue that Chiang Ching-Kuo's successor, Lee
Teng-hui, has little control over the armed forces, which are
allocated an estimated 46 percent of Taiwan's annual budget of
nearly $20 billion.
   ``No military officers dared to give an order without the prior
approval from Chiang Ching-kuo, but it appears no one can control
them now,'' said Chang Chung-tung, history professor at National
Taiwan University.
   Lee, a native Taiwanese, has yet to build up his own power base
in the Nationalist military that remains dominated by officers who
came from mainland China. That also has led to speculation that
Hau's influence is growing.
   Some liberal newspapers and magazines recently criticized Hau on
grounds that he promoted several of his own men, including two
generals demoted by Chiang Ching-kuo for dereliction of duty.
   Newspapers also have suggested that Hau played an influential
role in crafting the Nationalist party's new policy-making Central
Standing Committee that was named in July. The military retained
three of 31 committee seats, including one held by Hau.
   Opposition politicians have assailed the armed forces for their
role in trying to crack down on dissent, claiming military police
and intelligence agents have appeared at major anti-government
demonstrations where only a police presence was appropriate.
   In August, several dozen members of the opposition Democratic
Progressive Party staged a protest in Taipei to demand the
impeachment of Hau because a military jail burned the memoirs of a
renowned dissident prisoner.
   The liberal Independence Evening Post said in an editorial July
27 that with the lifting of martial law ``we thought military
personnel would reduce their role to that of defending the state
and civilians.''
   ``Rather, we saw the military openly intervening in political
factional disputes, continuing to have a hand in social and
economic affairs and having too much say in government personnel
changes,'' it said.
   A Defense Ministry spokesman, Maj. Gen. Chang Hui-yuan, called
the newspaper's accusations ``malicious slandering'' and ``an
insult to our troops.''
   To counter the intense criticism, the military has launched a
campaign to stress the importance of national defense in speeches
and through concerts, plays and television shows, including one
showing the 69-year-old Hau swimming, golfing and playing with his
grandson.
   In a speech marking Soldiers' Day on Sept. 3, Hau urged
Taiwanese ``not to reduce the sense of crisis while living in
comfort,'' claiming that communist China still could invade Taiwan
at any time.
   Professor Chang reflects widespread sentiment when he labels as
unlikely the possibility of a military coup or a military-led
campaign to reverse the recent liberalization trend that has
permitted political opposition and relaxed unofficial ties with
China.
   ``Military officers must have realized that the public would not
support them in case of a coup,'' he said. ``They must also ask
whether they could control the troops before moving to seize
power.''
   Most of the troops are native Taiwanese, who make up 85 percent
of the island's population.

   When Discovery's countdown clock
reaches the 9-minute mark on launch day, it will stop automatically
and be held there for 10 minutes while one man decides whether to
give the final go-ahead for liftoff.
   He will look to many experts, analyzing every scrap of
information, for help. They will report on the condition of the
shuttle and its thousands of complex parts, the state of the
weather overhead and at prime and emergency landing sites around
the globe, the readiness of the launch and flight control teams to
support the mission.
   Before the 10 minutes is up, he will say go or no-go.
   It is a new and awesome responsibility, a product of the
Challenger disaster, and it lies with Robert L. Crippen, a
50-year-old Navy captain and an astronaut who has gone into space
more often on the shuttle than any other person. He piloted the
first launch in 1981 and has commanded three other flights.
   His fellow astronauts are delighted to have one of their own
calling that critical shot.
   Rick Hauck, another Navy captain, who will command Discovery on
the first shuttle mission since Challenger, said, ``I flew my first
mission with him in 1983, and I can't think of anyone who is reverse transcriptase,
an enzyme the AIDS virus uses
to replicate itself and spread through the body.
   The experiment to grow crystals of the AIDS protein was
developed by researchers at Burroughs Wellcome in Research Triangle
Park, N.C., and NASA officials determined it was safe to fly on the
shuttle.
   Another experiment involves taking photographs and video of
lightning at night to study relationships between it and other
elements such as thunderstorms. Such research may one day lead to
better weather forecasting.
   ``The altitude we fly at gives you kind of a unique perspective.
We get a very broad view of thunderstorms. We can see a third of a
continent's worth of thunderstorms. It's spectacular,'' Nelson said.
   Astronauts also will photograph the sky immediately after sunset
and after sunrise to measure the brightness of Earth's atmosphere
at those times. The information can be used to build sensors for
future unmanned satellites, Nelson said.
   The five other experiments consist of two separation processes
and three basic research projects that include examining how metal
melts and resolidifies in zero gravity, mixing immiscible fluids
and watching them separate and studying how blood flows and
collects in weightlessness.

   Almost all the men who ignored the warnings
and gave the go-ahead for the Challenger launch are gone and new
ones are in place as the shuttle program returns to flight.
   One shuttle astronaut, Richard Truly, now is at the helm of
NASA's spaceflight program. Another, Robert Crippen _ who has been
on four shuttle missions _ will give the final nod to commit
Discovery and other future shuttles to flight.
   The top officials of Morton Thiokol, which built the booster
rocket that doomed the Challenger, are gone. Gone, too, is most of
the NASA hierarchy, and gone are the directors of NASA centers
investigated by the presidential Challenger commission.
   There are two notable exceptions: Arnold Aldrich, one of the
NASA bosses who gave final approval for the Jan. 28, 1986, flight,
and Allan J. McDonald, a Morton Thiokol engineer who argued against
the launch but was overruled. Aldrich is director of the shuttle
program at NASA headquarters and McDonald is in charge of Thiokol's
space operations.
   The Rogers commission presented its conclusion that Challenger
``was an accident rooted in history,'' but it did not recommend any
criminal indictment. Still, Sen. Ernest F. Hollings, D-S.C.
demanded that ``every single person be identified and disciplined.''
   That seems to have been done without resorting to the courts.
   Lawrence B. Mulloy, former manager of the booster rocket program
at the Marshall Space Flight Center who had brushed off the Thiokol
concerns, and Stanley Reinartz, manager of shuttle projects who
decided not to tell top launch officials about those concerns, both
left NASA. So has George B. Hardy, the Marshall official who told
Thiokol he was ``appalled'' at the firm's original recommendation
that the launch should not take place.
   The National Aeronautics and Space Administration was working
without its chief on the day of the tragedy, and the man with the
title of acting administrator was new to the agency.
   Administrator James M. Beggs had stepped aside in early December
1985 when he was indicted on charges unrelated to NASA. Dr. William
R. Graham, who had been deputy administrator for only 10 days when
Beggs stepped out, had to take the heat for the worst tragedy in
America's space program.
   After Challenger, Beggs resigned and Graham remained as acting
administrator until Dr. James C. Fletcher returned in May 1986 from
private life and reassumed the job of administrator he had held for
eight years in the 1970s.
   ``Where management is weak, we will strengthen it,'' he
promised. ``Where engineering or design processes need improving,
we will improve it. Where our internal communications are poor, we
will see that they get better.''
   The purge had begun much earlier.
   The first to step down after Challenger was Jesse Moore,
assistant NASA administrator for spaceflight, who had already been
named to take over as director of the Johnson Space Center in
Houston. Truly was summoned from the U.S. Navy Space Command to
take charge; he proclaimed ``the NASA can-do spirit is intact'' and
quickly set out a conservative agenda to get back into the
spaceflight business.
   In the NASA structure, center directors wield considerable power
and those directly concerned with shuttle flight were quick to fall.
   Moore remained at Johnson only a few months and left to take an
ill-defined headquarters job that lasted six months. Richard Smith
left the Kennedy Space Center for a private space firm. Dr. William
Lucas retired from the Marshall Space Flight Center, which has
charge of NASA propulsion systems and received the most criticism
from the Rogers commission.
   NASA went to the Air Force for Lt. Gen. Forrest S. McCartney to
head the Kennedy Space Center. At Johnson, Aaron Cohen was moved up
and Marshall got J. R. Thompson, a veteran space engineer, who came
back to NASA from Princeton's Plasma Physics Laboratory.
   Three of the four Thiokol officials who overruled their
engineers and acceded to the Challenger launch still are with the
company but in non-shuttle positions. They are J.C. Kilminster, now
in the automotive products division, R.K. Lund, vice president of
advanced technology; and Calvin Wiggins, general manager of the
Huntsville division. Jerald E. Mason, boss of the booster division,
retired early.
   Roger Boisjoly, a Thiokol engineer, said the company harassed
him for his strong testimony before the Rogers commission and sued
Thiokol for billions of dollars. The case was dismissed and he has
left the company long ago.

   Factoids are dispensed in the ``snapshots'' which precede the
commercials: 6,500 limousines were sold in the USA in 1985; it

   ``USA Today: The Television Show'' is the first informational
series from Grant Tinker, whose GTG Entertainment production studio
is a joint venture with Gannett, the publisher of USA Today, the
newspaper. The syndicated, nightly half-hour news show premiered
last Monday on about 160 stations. In most markets, it airs in the
early evening.
   Jay Leno has joked that USA Today is the newspaper for those
whose attention span is too short for television.
   ``USA Today'' on television is no marathon for the mind, but it
demands intense attention in short bursts. For instance, viewers
have about five seconds to decode an elaborate weather map. RAIN,
the map said Tuesday. Where?
   OK, if you care about the weather you can watch the local news,
but then what's the point of flashing the map on ``USA Today''? Is
this the art appreciation segment?

   Sometimes ``USA Today'' is goofily inspired, especially in the
first show when Robin Young stood inside an Impressionist painting
and then, apparently walking toward a fan that made her hair
billow, melded into a beach scene from the film, ``A Man and a
Woman.''
   Edie Magnus played more tricks on the mind by doing ``live''
interviews with George Bush and Michael Dukakis, after explaining
neither one was in the studio. She stood and chatted with a screen,
synchronizing her questions to answers taped earlier in the day.
   The implicit message is that nothing is real, not here anyway.
Nor is anything so important that you, the viewer, need to think
about it.
   But why watch? It takes less concentration to watch ``Nova'' or
a Bill Moyers special on PBS.
   If you miss the intro to a segment, forget it. Poor sound
quality in some of the interviews doesn't help either. In a segment
Wednesday on the National Geographic, voices were repeatedly
smothered by annoying music.
   Before ``USA Today'' hit the air, it suffered a certain amount
of sniping from critics because of its commitment to an upbeat
``journalism of hope'' which accentuated the positive and
eliminated the negative.
   What's been accentuated is pace; coherence and content have been
eliminated. You have to give up something to jam 18 topics into the
22 minutes left after commercials.
   But it's not as though ``USA Today'' tracked mud through the
temple of television. CBS' ``48 Hours'' and ``West 57th'' have
blazed a trail for lightweight journalism, ABC's ``20-20'' is
infatuated with celebrities and Fox's ``A Current Affair'' and
``The Reporters'' plumb the lower depths of taste. ``USA Today''
looks less like an innovator than a cross between Trivial Pursuit
and ``Entertainment Tonight.''

<HEAD>New USDA Rules for 1989 Aimed at Stopping Subsidy Abuse</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   If all goes well, the Agriculture Department's
new rules for paying out subsidies under 1989 commodity programs
will make those notorious multimillion-dollar handouts to a few
super farmers a thing of the past.
   The USDA is holding training sessions to explain the new
regulations to those involved in administering the programs. Among
other things, local, state and federal officials must know who is a
farmer and who is not.
   After years of seeing news reports about huge payments to big
operators _ some individuals collected more than $4 million in some
years _ the government got serious about cracking down.
   The farm law of 1970 included the first attempt at putting a lid
on payments, and there were subsequent modifications as Congress
wrote new laws and rewrote others. Usually, it turned out, there
were big loopholes.
   It became almost routine for some large operators to divide
holdings among family members or friends, thereby each qualifying
for a share of the subsidy pie to circumvent the letter of the law.
   So the USDA and Congress tried again, in the Food Security Act
of 1985 and again in the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1987.
   The 1985 farm law, which is still operative, set a lid of
$50,000 on the amount of ``deficiency'' payments and land diversion
payments, with certain exceptions, that a person could collect in
any one year. The law also set an overall $250,000 maximum, which
included deficiency, disaster and other federal payments.
   But the abuses continued. The General Accounting Office, an
investigative agency of Congress, reported last year that
``individuals and other legal entities can avoid the $50,000
payment limitation in a variety of ways.''
   The 1987 law set up a payment ``eligibility'' standard as well
as a ``limitation'' provision. These are the mainstays of new
regulations that USDA recently adopted to carry out the mandate of
Congress to crack down on excessive payments to individuals.
   A new farm program fact sheet developed by the department's
Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation Service soon will be
circulating to agency offices, farmers and others.
   Here are some of the main points being developed for 1989 crop
programs administered by the agency, according to a draft of the
report:
   _The regulations apply to payments made under the annual
programs for wheat, feed grains, upland cotton, extra long staple
cotton, rice and honey.
   _Payments made on land owned by public schools or to states for
land owned by a public school district or state, which are used to
maintain a public school, are not subject to the rules.
   _The law requires that before any ``person'' is eligible to
receive payments, that person must be ``actively engaged in
farming.''
   _A person can be an individual farmer, an individual who is a
member of a joint operation, a corporation, a joint stock company,
an association, a limited partnership, a trust, an estate, or a
charitable organization.
   _Husband and wife may be separate ``persons'' if they can show
that each brought separate farming operations into their marriage
and have maintained them as separate farming operations throughout
their marriage.
   The rules also include specifics for cash rent tenants,
corporations, trusts, estates and minor children.
   In defining ``actively engaged'' in farming, the rules require
those applying for payments at county ASCS offices to provide local
governing committees with information to substantiate their active
engagement in farming.
   ``Providing such information is voluntary, but if information is
not provided the county committee will not be be to make an
`actively engaged in farming' determination and the producer will
be ineligible to receive any payments,'' the report said.
   In general, it added, to be actively engaged in farming, a
person ``has to make a significant contribution of capital, land,
labor, and-or equipment to their farming operation, as well as a
significant contribution of active personal labor and@or active
personal management.''
   The ``significant contribution'' also is spelled out. For
example, a significant contribution of active personal labor means
that a ``person'' personally provides at least 1,000 hours of labor
or at least 50 percent of that person's commensurate share of the
total labor necessary in the farming operation.
   Again, the county committees will determine whether a person is
properly contributing to the farm's operation. There are certain
exceptions for ``persons'' who are landowners, family member and
sharecroppers, and those are all spelled out in detail.
   ``In addition to the provisions requiring active engagement in
farming, the 1987 act also provides that foreign persons that are
not lawfully admitted into the United States shall be ineligible to
receive any program benefits, including commodity (price support)
loans, unless that foreign person provides a significant
contribution of active personal labor,'' the agency said.

   Retail sales declined in August for only the

   The Commerce Department said Thursday that sales fell by 0.2

sales coupled with strong demand from U.S. consumers would put too

<HEAD>Gulf Production Unlikely To Resume Until After Weekend</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The decreasing likelihood that Hurricane Gilbert
would seriously disrupt Gulf of Mexico energy production and
indications that Iraq was balking at coming under OPEC output
restrictions have helped curb the recent oil futures rally.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, wholesale unleaded gasoline
for October delivery closed down 1.39 cents at 45.63 cents a gallon
on Thursday after rising 3.21 cents in the previous session.
   The October wholesale heating oil contract fell 1.37 cents a
gallon to close at 42.70 cents after a 2.24-cent rise on Wednesday.
   The October contract for West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark
grade of U.S. crude, settled 50 cents lower at $14.90 per barrel
following an 84-cent rise in volatile trading on Wednesday.
   Crude prices generally had been rising since plunging briefly to
two-year lows on Monday. But factors that strengthened the market
recently began to fade early in the trading day Thursday along with
reports that Hurricane Gilbert was headed for the U.S. Gulf of
Mexico coast, analysts said.
   Oil and gas companies operating in the Gulf had evacuated many
of their personnel from refineries and oil platforms, but observers
said the prospect of a major disruption in oil supplies due to the
approaching hurricane waned.
   ``Traders seem to feel that (Hurricane) Gilbert is not going to
do a lot of damage now,'' said John Hill of Merrill Lynch Energy
Futures.
   Companies reporting the evacuation of oil platforms and
refineries along the Gulf indicated they would not restart
operations until next week.
   But analysts said it was unlikely there would be any spot
shortages of oil products such as gasoline and heating oil and no
effect on contracts scheduled for October delivery.
   Approximately 870,000 barrels per day of oil and 8 million cubic
feet of natural gas are produced at Gulf facilities, according to
the Minerals Management Service.
   Also depressing prices Thursday was a statement from Iraq's oil
minister that his country would not lower its oil output if asked
to do so by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and
instead might raise production.
   The minister's statement punctured the upward momentum that
began Monday when Saudi Arabia's King Fahd made a rare public
statement calling for cooperation among OPEC and non-OPEC
oil-producing nations in restraining oil production.
   Iraq has refused to abide by its OPEC-assigned quota of 1.5
million barrels a day and is reported to be producing about 2.7
million barrels a day. Some observers hoped that after a recent
cease-fire in its 8-year-old war with Iran, Iraq would join with
other OPEC nations in setting production limits that would help
raise prices.
   Other OPEC nations also are exceeding quotas.
   The Iraqi statement also dampened hopes that a Sept. 25 meeting
of OPEC's price monitoring committee would produce substantive
results.

   Just when many speculators were betting that
Robert Maxwell would retreat from a trans-Atlantic bidding war for
Macmillan Inc., the British publisher counter-attacked in force.
   Maxwell raised his offer for the U.S. publishing giant to $2.41
billion cash on Thursday, in a surprise move to counter a $2.36
billion buyout deal that Macmillan accepted earlier this week from
the investment firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co.
   Maxwell, who previously had offered $84 for each of the
company's 27.76 million shares, said he now was willing to pay
$86.80 a share. He also offered to pay the company's recently
declared 20-cent per share quarterly dividend.
   Alternatively, Maxwell his Sept. 8 offer to purchase 11
Macmillan information businesses for $1.4 billion still was good.
   Maxwell's late afternoon announcement surprised many Wall Street
traders, many of whom previously had assumed he probably would back
away from Macmillan in light of its Kohlberg Kravis agreement.
   Traders scrambled to buy Macmillan shares in anticipation of a
bidding war, pushing the stock up $2 a share to $86.50 in New York
Stock Exchange composite trading.
   ``I kind of thought it might be over but this really re-ignites
the whole situation,'' said Bert Boksen, a strategist who follows
Macmillan for Raymond James & Associates Inc., an investment firm
in St. Petersburg, Fla. ``I'm quite sure Macmillan doesn't want to
sell to Maxwell.''
   David Jackson, Macmillan's vice president for investor
relations, said the company had no comment on the new Maxwell
offer. Kohlberg also said through its public relations firm, Kekst
& Co., that it had no comment.
   On the surface, Maxwell's offer is more attractive to
shareholders. The tender offer announced Monday by Macmillan
management and Kohlberg, would pay shareholders $80 in cash and $5
in securities and likely would involve selling chunks of the New
York-based company.
   Some analysts speculated Macmillan management and Kohlberg
Kravis would be hard pressed to top Maxwell's latest bid. But
others said Macmillan managers remain fiercely opposed to selling
the company to Maxwell, whom they regard as an unpredictable and
capricious businessman who knows little about the U.S. publishing
business.
   Harcourt Brace Jovanovich Inc., another big American publishing
concern, successfully thwarted a Maxwell-led takeover last year by
loading itself up with billions of dollars in new debt that forced
it to sell a number of business.
   ``Maxwell is considered a real maverick in this industry, a
difficult person to work for or with, and somebody that might pare
the company up,'' Boksen said. ``He's not the type of person your
more traditional publishing companies want to associate with.''
   Some speculated Macmillan would find a way to raise the offer or
perhaps find a third ``white knight'' friendly acquirer for the
company.
   The Kohlberg deal was structured as a leveraged buyout, in which
the purchase money is borrowed and repaid with the acquired
company's cash flow, earnings or asset sales. It was considered
likely that Macmillan would have to sell part of its operations to
finance such a deal.
   Macmillan is a leading publisher of educational textbooks. It
also owns a range of other information businesses that range from
telemarketing services to the Berlitz language training school
chain.

   Chevrolet has announced two new car lines,
including a new line of four imports designed to give the auto
giant a larger share of the small car market.
   Chevrolet executives, on hand here to preview the new lines for
dealers on Thursday, said the new imports and a new mid-size
domestic series would boost its standing against cars made by rival
Ford Motor Co.
   One of the new lines, the Geo, will have four models and will be
offered only through Chevrolet dealers. Company officials said 80
percent of their 5,000 dealers had agreed to handle the line, using
separate signs and display areas.
   The second line, the Lumina, will replace the Celebrity series.
   Chevrolet Motor Division General Manager Robert D. Burger said
the Geo was created ``to significantly broaden our customer appeal
and to attract buyers who currently may not consider buying a
Chevrolet.''
   Mike Erdman, general marketing manager for Chevrolet, a division
of General Motors Corp., said 40 percent of car sales are small
cars, a market dominated by imports. Erdman said surveys indicate
28 percent of the people who buy imports never have been in a
domestic manufacturer's dealership.
   Promotion of the Geo will mark the ``most aggressive special
marketing effort ever undertaken at Chevrolet,'' Erdman said.
   ``There are 400 nameplates out there,'' he said of the growing
auto market. ``Competing for a share of the market is a real
challenge.''
   Asked about the cost of the imports, considering the current yen
rate, Erdman admitted ``it's going to be a very difficult challenge
to make money on them.'' The yen has risen sharply against the
dollar since 1985, making Japanese products more expensive in the
United States.
   Fred Schaafsma, chief engineer for Chevrolet division, said the
American auto manufacturer is ``actively working with all three of
our affiliates to get costs down.''
   Erdman said he expected the Lumina line to account for 17
percent of Chevrolet's sales by 1991. Lumina will replace all
Celebrity models except the station wagon by the 1990 model year.
The 1990 model of a Lumina sedan will be introduced next spring.
   Burger said Chevrolet expects to sell more than 3 million cars
and trucks in the 1989 model year, provided the U.S. economy
continues to support a forecast of 15 million car and truck sales
next year.
   Chevrolet officials attending a news conference to unveil the
new products vowed the automotive giant would top sales of Ford
cars next year.
   In the 1988 model year, which began Oct. 1, 1987, Ford has sold
1,450,010 cars from its Ford Division through Sept. 10, up 7
percent from the same period in the 1987 model year. Chevrolet has
sold 1,401,190 cars in the current model year, 3 percent fewer than
during the same period in the 1987 model year.
   The Geo line will include the Prizm, Metro and Spectrum cars and
the Tracker utility vehicle. Chevrolet said Geo car prices will
range from $5,999 for the Metro, which is advertised at getting 53
mpg, to $7,610 for the Spectrum, now made in Japan by Isuzu Motors
Ltd.
   The base price for the Tracker will be $10,195. Distribution of
the Tracker will be limited to a dozen states on the East and West
coasts.
   The Tracker and Metro will be made by Suzuki Motor Co. Ltd. in
Japan and the Prizm will be made in Fremont, Calif., by New United
Motor Manufacturing Co. Inc., a joint venture of GM and Toyota
Motor Corp.

   Ashland Oil Inc. officials have reacted
bitterly to criminal charges lodged against the company for a
massive oil spill, saying the charges will impair efforts to comply
with environmental laws.
   ``The company is disappointed that criminal actions will be
pursued in light of Ashland's efforts to mitigate the spill's
impact and the fact that the company quickly accepted
responsibility for the incident,'' Ashland spokesman Roger Schrum
said Thursday.
   On Thursday, a federal grand jury indicted Ashland for
violations of the federal Clean Water and the Refuse acts, the
first criminal charges arising from the Jan. 2 spill that
contaminated drinking water in three states.
   U.S. Attorney J. Alan Johnson said the two misdemeanor counts
were the most stringent that could be brought because federal
environmental laws do not contain felony provisions for
corporations for such offenses.
   ``We're doing the best we can,'' he said. ``We're following the
evidence based on the law that exists here.''
   Conviction carries a maximum penalty of a $200,000 fine on each
count or double the monetary loss suffered as a result of the
criminal conduct. So far, the losses amount to more than $10
million, Johnson said.
   Schrum said Ashland voluntarily has paid more than $11.4 million
for clean-up costs and to reimburse claims from individuals,
businesses and government agencies.
   The decision to prosecute Ashland goes against past practices by
the Justice Department to pursue criminal violations only in
instances of deliberate acts, he said.
   ``We think such actions impair rather than promote environmental
compliance,'' Schrum said.
   The spill occurred when an Ashland Oil riverside storage tank at
the company's Floreffe terminal in Jefferson, near Pittsburgh,
collapsed while being filled with 3.8 million gallons of fuel oil.
   About 1 million gallons escaped the containment dikes at the
facility, and more than 700,000 gallons spilled into the
Monongahela River and traveled downstream, well beyond the river's
confluence with the Ohio River.
   The government said the accident represented one of the largest
inland oil spills in the nation's history, affecting drinking water
supplies and plant and animal life in Pennsylvania, Ohio and West
Virginia. About 23,000 suburban Pittsburgh residents went without
tap water for almost a week.
   The indictment said Ashland had disassembled a 48-year-old oil
storage tank near Cleveland in 1986 and then reassembled it at the
Floreffe terminal. It was placed in service in August 1987.
   In May, investigators for an independent research institute that
studied the accident said a dime-size flaw in the tank's brittle
steel walls caused the collapse. Aggravating the condition were the
relative weakness of the World War II-era steel, pressure from the
diesel fuel and cold weather, according to the Battelle Memorial
Institute.
   Besides failing to obtain all necessary local permits for
erecting the tank, Ashland said it failed to fill the tank with
water before use, a test recommended by the American Petroleum
Institute, an industry group.
   Johnson said the indictment does not end the federal
government's investigation of the oil spill. He said the government
still must determine if any Ashland employees or officials violated
the law.
   The state attorney general's office also is conducting a
criminal investigation but has brought no charges.
   In a separate civil action in July, the Justice Department filed
a proposed consent decree requiring Ashland, based in Ashland, Ky.,
to complete the clean-up of the spill and to reimburse the
government $680,000 for emergency response work by federal agencies.
   Ashland has agreed to the decree's terms.

<HEAD>NRC Set To Act On Final Obstacles For Seabrook Plant</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Lead planned after NRC votes, scheduled for 11:30 a.m. EDT.

<TEXT>
   The Nuclear Regulatory Commission has set the
stage for two key votes that could remove the final regulatory
obstacles in the Seabrook, N.H., plant's long road toward a
low-power operating license.
   If the Commission acts today in favor of the plant, Seabrook
could be eligible for the license within 30 days, but Massachusetts
officials have vowed to fight the license in federal court.
   The low-power license has been a key pressure point in the
struggle between Seabrook owners, the nuclear industry and New
Hampshire state officials on one side and Massachusetts Gov.
Michael S. Dukakis, local officials and anti-nuclear activists on
the other.
   Seabrook must obtain the license, which would allow it to test
the reactor at 5 percent of capacity, before securing a full-power
commercial operating license.
   The NRC is to decide two issues. The first is whether to allow a
reactor to operate at low power without having an emergency system
in place to alert neighbors in case of a plant accident.
   Massachusetts municipalities in the 10-mile zone forced Seabrook
officials to remove the sirens.
   Under the new rule, the siren system would have to be in place
only for full-power license consideration. Seabrook officials are
working on plans to mount sirens on trucks and helicopters.
   The second issue, which was tentatively scheduled for an NRC
vote, was a petition by opponents urging the commission to break
from its regulations and consider the financial condition of the
plant's owners.
   The lead owner, Public Service Company of New Hampshire, filed
for bankruptcy protection in January. Public Service owns 36
percent of the plant.
   In June, Massachusetts Municipal Wholesale Electric Co., which
is the fourth largest Seabrook shareholder at 12 percent, announced
it was withdrawing from the project and would stop making its $2
million-a-month payments.
   For opponents, blocking the low-power license is critical
because they say 5 percent power tests would contaminate the
facility with radioactive fuel, ruling out a future conversion to a
gas-fired plant or other facility advocated by nuclear critics.
Plant officials say the tests would not rule out a conversion.
   Seabrook opponents believe plant owners and the commission are
trying to win low-power license approval before the possibility of
encountering a Dukakis presidency that could further hinder the
licensing process.
   Dukakis, the Democratic presidential nominee, says it would be
impossible to quickly evacuate residents from the Massachusetts
seacoast towns that lie within the plant's 10-mile emergency
evacuation zone, an area that swells with summer tourists and has
congested roads on normal days.
   The idle $5.6 billion reactor is losing $50 million each month
in maintenance and finance costs.
   Massachusetts Attorney General James Shannon said last week that
if the two regulatory obstacles were removed by the NRC, the state
would fight the license in federal appeals court.

<HEAD>HCA Buyout Proposal Hinted By Management</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A management group may make a $3.3
billion bid to buy Hospital Corp. of America, one of the world's
largest hospital chains, and it is trying to line up financing for
the bid.
   But financial analysts were divided over whether HCA was worth
the $47-a-share offer the group, which includes the company's
chairman, might put on the table.
   ``I have no reason to believe that there is a second would-be
buyer out there, but if someone had asked me where it would go, I
would have said between $50 and $55,'' Margo Durow, an analyst with
a J.C. Bradford & Co., said Thursday.
   Elaine Hughey Smyth, of Equitable Securities Corp., said the
offer was reasonable and that the time was right for HCA to move
into private hands.
   ``There are no compelling reasons for hospital companies to have
access to public markets any more,'' she said. ``They are not in a
growth pattern any more.''
   Wall Street also mulled over the propsal. In heavy trading on
the New York Stock Exchange, HCA had soared to $47.50 a share
Thursday before closing at $43.75, up $6.62{.
   HCA, which owns or operates nearly 400 hospitals worldwide, said
on Thursday that the group of managers, including Chairman Thomas
F. Frist Jr., had advised the board of directors about the intended
proposal of $47 a share in cash for HCA's 70.6 million shares
outstanding.
   An HCA statement said Frist planned to negotiate with
unidentified third parties to obtain financing for a leveraged
buyout, in which a company is acquired largely with borrowed money
repaid from the target company's profits or asset sales.
   The Nashville newspaper, the Tennessean, quoted unnamed sources
as saying the New York investment banking firm Drexel Burnham
Lambert Inc. was expected to arrange the financing.
   Drexel also handled the sale of high-interest ``junk'' bonds in
HCA's $1.64 billion sale of 104 of its hospitals to HealthTrust
Inc. last year.
   HCA said its board had established a special committee to review
any management proposal for an acquisition and had received no
guarantee that one would be
   ``We believe in today's environment, HCA, as a private company,
could better serve all of its constituents including patients,
employees, physicians, and our various communities including and
especially Nashville,'' Frist said.
   Frist was the only member of management identified in the
attempt.
   HCA currently owns 79 medical, surgical hospitals and 51
psychiatric hospitals. It also manages 225 other hospitals and owns
or manages 42 international hospitals.
   The company reported in July that its profits for the quarter
ending June 30 increased by 15 percent, partly because of increased
inpatient and outpatient revenues.
   For the second quarter, after-tax profit totaled about $70.8
million, or $1 a share, on revenue of $1.02 billion. For the same
period a year earlier, earnings were $61.3 million, or 74 cents a
share, on revenue of about $1.3 billion.

<HEAD>American Brands Rejects Takeover Offer From LeBow Group</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GREENWICH, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The chairman and chief executive officer
of American Brands Inc. has rejected the second takeover offer this
year, saying his company wants to remain independent.
   On Thursday, American Brands turned down a buyout proposal from
an investor group led by Bennett S. LeBow, who said he still wants
to buy American Brands' tobacco companies.
   ``The American Brands board of directors continues to believe
that the best long-term interest of American Brands and its
shareholders is that the company continue to operate as an
independent company,'' said William J. Alley. ``American Brands has
no interest in engaging in discussions with Mr. LeBow with respect
to an acquisition of American Brands.''
   American Brands said on Thursday that Brooke Partners L.P.,
which is controlled by LeBow, had filed for federal antitrust
clearance to acquire more than $15 million worth of the company's
stock, and might acquire more than 50 percent of American Brands'
outstanding shares.
   American Brands closed at $48.37{ a share Thursday, down 37{
cents in New York Stock Exchange trading. Based on Thursday's
closing price and the company's roughly 110 million common shares
outstanding, American Brands has a market value of about $5.32
billion.
   It was the second takeover overture this year for American
Brands, which in February acquired E-II Holdings Inc. for $1.1
billion after E-II launched an attempted hostile buyout of American
Brands.
   American Brands said LeBow had approached the company in July
about a possible acquisition of its American Tobacco Co. by Liggett
Group Inc., which LeBow also controls. American Tobacco brands
include Lucky Strike and Tareyton cigarettes and Half & Half pipe
tobacco, among others.
   Americans Brands officials rejected Liggett's proposed deal
saying it was not in the company's best interests.
   In a letter to American's chairman, LeBow said he continued to
believe the ``economic logic of combining Liggett and the tobacco
operations of American Brands compels us to effect such a
combination.''
   LeBow said in the letter that Brooke continued to be interested
in acquiring the Greenwich-based firm's tobacco business rather
than the entire company.
   Alley noted that American Brands was pursuing a restructuring
program aimed at sharpening the company's focus and increasing
shareholder value.
   In the past 16 months, Alley said American Brands has invested
$2 billion to acquire seven businesses designed to ``strengthen''
the company's ``core business strategy.''
   The company has also divested itself of businesses that do not
meet its goals and has purchased 17.1 million million shares of its
common stock, Alley said.

   British stocks declined by midday Friday but were

figures that weren't as bad as some economists had expected.
   The report showed retail prices rose 1.1 percent in August from
July and were up 5.7 percent from a year earlier.
   ``Basically it wasn't a bad figure,'' said Charles Larkum, an
equity market analyst at James Capel and Co. ``The market is in a

   Government officials vowed Friday that Japan will
not open its market to foreign rice imports, and expressed hopes
the United States will reject a petition from American rice farmers
seeking to sell in Japan.
   ``Rice should be a serious concern to all Japanese,'' Economic
Planning Agency chief Eiichi Nakao told a Cabinet meeting Friday.
``Every Cabinet member should take this matter seriously and
protect domestic rice production.''
   Nakao's remarks were quoted in a statement from the agency.
   The agriculture minister and other officials expressed regret at
a complaint filed with the U.S. Trade Representative's office
Wednesday by the U.S. Rice Millers' Association.
   The organization, which represents 11,000 American rice growers,
demanded that Japan allow foreigners to provide 10 percent of its
annual rice consumption of 10 million tons within four years.
   The petition was based on a section of the recently passed
omnibus trade law, which requires the president to retaliate
against a country deemed protectionist by the U.S. Congress. The
Trade Representative's office has 45 days to decide whether to
accept the petition before it starts investigations.
   ``The two governments have agreed not to negotiate this matter
on a bilateral basis,'' Agricultural Minister Takashi Sato said at
a news conference. ``We regret such a complaint was filed in spite
of the agreement.''
   The Rice Millers' Association filed a similar complaint in 1986,
but it was turned down. Tokyo has sought arbitration at the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, an international body that governs
world trade.
   Self-sufficiency in rice production is a sensitive issue in
Japan, where rice remains the staple food. Rice growers comprise
nearly 80 percent of all Japanese farmers.

   Britain's annual rate of inflation rose to 5.7
percent in August, the highest level in three years, the government
announced Friday.
   Nevertheless, the increase from 4.8 percent in July was not as
bad as some investors and economists had feared. Stocks showed
little reaction.
   Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson warned on Wednesday
that there would be a significant increase in the rate because of
Britain's practice of including mortgage rates in the calculation.
   Britain's mortgage rates have climbed sharply, and are in
13-percent range, following the government's move in recent months
to push interest rates up to curb inflation by dampening the
country's strong consumer spending.
   Britain's annual inflation rate has climbed substantially so far
this year and is much higher than had been forecast.
   The rate stood at 3.3 percent in January.

   General Motors Corp. is recalling about 30,500
cars, trucks, vans and school buses to conduct safety-related
inspections and replace parts that could be defective.
   The company said Thursday that about 8,000 1988 Buick Regals are

hose that could wear through and result in a reduction of braking
capability.
   About 21,000 1985 and 1986 Chevrolet and GMC P-30 trucks and
G-30 vans also are being recalled to repair a control arm in the
front suspension. The arm could crack, resulting in a loss of
steering control, the company said.
   In addition, 1,500 1987 and 1988 model Chevrolet and GMC school
buses, all equipped with gasoline engines, are being recalled
because of possible problems in the location of air brake lines.
   The lines may have been put too close to exhaust systems,
causing wearing and a partial or complete loss of brakes, GM said.

   Three Kroger Co. shareholders have sued to
block the company's proposed $3.8 billion restructuring aimed at
fending off hostile takeovers of the nation's largest supermarket
chain.
   In two class action lawsuits filed Thursday, the shareholders
asked the Hamilton County Court of Common Pleas to prevent Kroger
from adopting the plan.
   Kroger announced the plan Tuesday after the Maryland-based Haft
family, known for its takeover forays, had received government
clearance to buy at least $15 million worth of Kroger stock.
   The lawsuits charge that Kroger executives and directors are
trying to protect their own financial interests, not the interests
of shareholders, with the proposed restructuring.
   ``By proposing the restructuring plan, they have displayed their
predisposition and determination to reject and thwart tender and or
other offers and proposals by third parties for enhanced
shareholder value, so as to preserve and protect their emoluments
and positions with the company,'' one suit contends.
   The suits, both filed as class actions on behalf of all 52,000
Kroger shareholders, seek unspecified damages.
   Kroger declined comment on the suits.

<HEAD>Ames To Buy Zayre For $800 Million</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Ames Department Stores will jump from
fifth place to third among the nation's largest discount retailers
with its acquisition of Zayre Corp.'s 388 discount stores, Ames'
president said.
   ``We will also gain entry into new and profitable markets, such
as Florida and Illinois, as well as increase our penetration in
other markets,'' Peter Hollis, Ames' president and chief executive
officer, said Thursday.
   The deal announced Thursday was valued at about $800 million,
company officials said.
   Ames currently operates 348 discount stores, primarily in small
towns in 18 states in the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic region.
   With the deal, Ames will have its first stores in Florida and
Illinois, as well as Alabama, Georgia, Lousiana, Mississippi,
Tennessee and Wisconsin, said Catherine G. Leonard, Ames' director
of investor relations.
   Zayre discount stores are similar to Ames stores, although some
are located in larger metropolitan areas in 26 states, Leonard
said. The two chains have 12 stores that compete in the same
communities, Leonard said.
   Ames' marketing strategy has been to locate in small towns, and
operate as old-fashioned general stores. About 45 percent of its
inventory is apparel and domestic items such as sheets, pillow
cases and rugs.
   The remaining 55 percent is hard line, hardware, houseware,
jewelry, health and beauty aids and automobile parts.
   Leonard said no decision had been made on the possible closing
of some stores or possible layoffs.
   ``One of the first things we will do is study all Zayre
locations for their long-term profit potential,'' she said.
   Ames Chairman James A. Harmon said the company had been
analyzing the Zayre discount business for several months.
   ``The transaction has been extensively studied from every point
of view. We believe it is a unique opportunity under most favorable
terms,'' he said.
   In the fiscal year ended Jan. 30, Ames had revenue of $2.1
billion and net income of $34.2 million. In addition to its
discount stores, Ames operates 161 smaller variety stores under the
G.C. Murphy Variety Stores name.
   Framingham, Mass.-based Zayre Stores, currently the nation's
fourth largest discount retailer, had annual sales of $3.5 billion
last year and a profit of $143.3 million.
   It's discount stores, however, weren't profitable, posting
losses last year.
   Zayre's other businesses include TJ Maxx, Hit or Miss and Miss
Chadwicks of Boston Inc.
   Ames said Zayre will receive cash, $200 million in subordinated
notes and preferred stock convertible to 8 million shares of Ames
common stock at a price of $25 a share.
   Zayre will own a 17.5 percent share of Ames stock when the deal
is completed, Leonard said. But a 10-year agreement was put into
effect that limits Zayre to owning a maximum of 20 percent of the
voting securities of Ames.
   Zayre said in a statement that its estimated net cash proceeds
would be $620 million after expenses and refinancing of the
subordinate note.
   The company said that after paying about $250 million in
short-term debt it plans to use ``a substantial portion of the
balance'' to benefit shareholders, possibly through a major stock
buyback.
   Zayre also said it will incur a one-time charge in the third
quarter of about $110 million because of the discontinued
operations.
   ``We are pleased to be able to enhance the value of our shares
through the redeployment of our assets as evidenced by this
transaction,'' Zayre Chairman Maurice Segall said.
   Ames said Zayre will have the right to nominate two directors.
   The boards of both companies have approved the deal, which is
still subject to regulatory approval and completion of Ames'
financing. Ames said it has a commitment from Citibank N.A.
   The transaction was expected to be completed in 45 days.

<TEXT>
   Italy, followed by the United States, leads the
way in exporting substandard goods to China, the Chinese government
agency responsible for inspecting foreign shipments said Friday.
   An official of the State Administration for the Inspection of
Import and Export Commodities said 37.5 percent of 584 Italian
products inspected in the first half of this year failed to meet
contract standards either in quality or quantity.
   He said the United States was second-worst with 30.87 percent,
or 517 of 1,675 shipments checked, of poor quality.
   The official, who was not identified, was quoted by the official
news agency Xinhua. There was no elaboration on the type of shoddy
goods shipped or which foreign trading partner had the best record.
   The report said 26.25 percent of British commodities, 24.73
percent of French products and 22 percent of goods from Hong Kong
and Macao failed to meet contract standards.
   In total, the administration inspected 56,695 shipments of
imported goods in the first half of the year, and found quality
products in 15.7 percent.
   Serious problems also existed in motor vehicles imported from
the Soviet Union and Eastern European countries, the report said.
   In the past, foreign businessmen accused of selling defective
merchandise to China have complained that their goods were damaged
by mishandling or long delays in transport within China or that the
Chinese ordered equipment unsuitable to their needs.

   The stock market was mixed today in trading
swollen by the so-called triple witching hour.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials dipped 2.66 to 2,089.62
in the first half hour of trading.
   Gainers slightly outnumbered losers in the overall tally of New
York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 508 up, 472 down and 561
unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 57.74 million shares as of 10
a.m. on Wall Street.
   The session began with an outburst of activity by professional
traders closing out positions linked to expiring stock index
futures and options.
   Some of those September contracts were settled as of the
opening, and others were due to be settled at the close.
   In the last month of each calendar quarter, the simultaneous
expiration of a set of index options, index futures and options on
individual stocks has become a familiar phenomenon, dubbed the
``triple witching hour.''
   Otherwise, analysts said the market was still drifting without
direction.
   The economy has obliged Wall Street lately by showing signs of
growing at a slower, and presumably more sustainable, pace, but the
markets' response hasn't been as enthusiastic as many observers
expected.
   Among actively traded blue chips, Exxon rose [ to 45[; General
Electric gained [ to 42]; Ford Motor dropped ] to 50~, and Merck
was unchanged at 58[.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks edged
up .01 to 151.61. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index fell .65 to 297.05.
   On Thursday the Dow Jones industrial average dropped 8.36 to
2,092.28.
   Declining issues outnumbered advances by about 7 to 6 on the
NYSE, with 643 up, 749 down and 534 unchanged.
   Big Board volume totaled 161.20 million shares, against 177.22
million in the previous session.

   The stock market showed a small gain today in
activity swollen by the so-called triple witching hour.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose .36 to 2,092.64 by
11 a.m. on Wall Street.
   Gainers slightly outnumbered losers in the overall tally of New
York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 595 up, 543 down and 576
unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 80.91 million shares at
midmorning.
   The session began with an outburst of activity by professional
traders closing out positions linked to expiring stock index
futures and options.
   Some of those September contracts were settled as of the
opening, and others were due to be settled at the close.
   In the last month of each calendar quarter, the simultaneous
expiration of a set of index options, index futures and options on
individual stocks has become a familiar phenomenon, dubbed the
``triple witching hour.''
   Otherwise, analysts said the market was still drifting without
direction.
   The economy has obliged Wall Street lately by showing signs of
growing at a slower, and presumably more sustainable, pace, but the
markets' response hasn't been as enthusiastic as many observers
expected.
   Among actively traded blue chips, Exxon rose [ to 45[; General
Electric gained \ to 42{; American Telephone & Telegraph was up [
at 25|, and Ford Motor dropped ~ to 50].
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks added
.05 to 151.65. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index fell .75 to 296.95.

   Business inventories rose only a modest 0.3
percent in July even though sales were down by 0.2 percent, the
government said today.
   The Commerce Department said inventories held on shelves and
backlots rose $2.2 billion to a seasonally adjusted $733.7 billion,
while sales edged down by $1.2 billion.
   The July gain in inventories followed a 0.8 percent rise in June
and was the 19th consecutive month without a decline. However, the
July increase was the smallest since a 0.2 percent rise in August
1987.
   Economists sometimes take rising inventories as a sign of
economic weakness. Too many goods in reserve could lead to
production cuts and layoffs at manufacturing plants. However,
analysts have not been worried over the past year because the
inventory gain has simply been keeping up with strong sales.
   The July drop in sales was the first since November and followed
a strong jump of 1.4 percent in June.
   The June inventory accumulation was led by 0.5 percent increases
at both the manufacturing and wholesale levels. Inventories shrank
by 0.1 percent at the retail level, where sales have been weakest
in recent months.
   In sales, a 0.9 percent decline at factories more than offset a
0.6 percent rise at the wholesale level and a slight 0.1 percent
increase at retail stores.
   An advance estimate of retail sales for August, released
Thursday, showed a 0.2 percent decrease.
   The combination of weak sales and slowly rising inventories left
the inventory-to-sales ratio unchanged at 1.5 in July. That means
it would take 1.5 months to exhaust inventories at the July sales
pace, a ratio not considered abnormally high.

   The government disclosed new evidence of a weakening economy
today, reporting a rise in business inventories last month that
coincided with a decline in sales.
   The Commerce Department said business inventories rose 0.3
percent in July while sales fell 0.2 percent. The July increase in
inventories was the 19th straight month without a decline. The drop
in sales was the first since January and followed a strong jump of
1.4 percent in June.
   Economists sometimes interpret rising inventories and slowing
sales as a signal of economic weakness. Too many goods in reserve
could lead to production cuts and layoffs at manufacturing plants.
   The report came a day after the Commerce Department said sales
of retail merchandise, a narrower category of sales, fell 0.2
percent in August, and the Federal Reserve said U.S. industry's
operating rate was unchanged in August, the first time in six
months the figure hasn't increased.
   These figures also suggested that the economy is beginning to
weaken after a period of strong growth, thereby easing some fears
of inflation that have dogged the nation's financial markets for
months.
   The Federal Reserve, in an effort to slow the economy by curbing
domestic demand, has been pushing interest rates higher since late
March and economists say the Fed tightening may be beginning to
take hold.
   ``I think things are looking just fine inflation-wise,'' said
Michael K. Evans, head of Evans Economics, a Washington consulting
firm. ``I think the Fed deserves an A. I think they tightened just
enough to slow down the economy without sending it into a
tailspin.''
   Financial markets today showed little reaction to the economic
news, however. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones average of 30
industrial stocks had moved less than a point higher by late
morning. In the bond market, prices were little changed, and the
dollar held steady against foreign currencies.

   Grain and soybean futures opened lower today on
the Chicago Board of Trade in a continuation of the technically
based sell-off that began late in Thursday's session, analysts said.
   Prices dropped sharply in the closing minutes Thursday after
wheat traders pushed prices for December and March delivery to new
contract highs. December wheat peaked at $4.32\ a bushel and March
wheat hit $4.36 a bushel.
   Having made new those highs, wheat prices are likely to fall 15
to 20 cents a bushel to levels near recent lows, said Jerry Zusel,
manager of floor operations at the Chicago Board of Trade for
Balfour Maclaine Corp.
   ``I think we're just in a big trading range right now,'' he
said. ``We've been at the higher end of the range and now we're
going toward the lower end of range.''
   Other crop futures have tended to follow the wheat market in
recent weeks.
   Zusel said good prospects for rain this weekend in the Midwest
may spark some buying of corn and soybean futures on ideas that
showers will slow the harvest of those crops. But he said
harvesting was barely underway so a delay at this point probably
wouldn't have much impact on prices.
   In early trading, wheat was 3 cents to 4\ cents lower with the
contract for delivery in December at $4.19 a bushel; corn was 2\
cents lower to 1 cent higher with September at $2.80{ a bushel;
oats were 3{ cents to 5{ cents lower with December at $2.70{ a
bushel; soybeans were 3 cents to 8{ cents lower with September at
$8.65 a bushel.
   Livestock and meat futures were mixed in early trading on the
Chicago Board of Trade in position-evening ahead of this
afternoon's seven-state cattle-on-feed report from the Agriculture
Department.
   Live cattle were .32 cent lower to .15 cent higher with October
at 70.05 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .12 cent lower to .05
cent higher with September at 79.80 cents a pound; hogs were .15
cent lower to .15 cent higher with October at 37.90 cents a pound;
frozen pork bellies were .18 cent to 1.20 cents higher with
February at 48.90 cents a pound.
   Livestock futures settled mostly lower on Thursday while pork
bellies finished higher.

<HEAD>Court Again Blocks Partial Merger</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TIM BOVEE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal appeals court has ordered The
Detroit News and Detroit Free Press to delay their partial merger,
which could have begun as early as this weekend, as the judges
consider whether the deal should be scrapped altogether.
   The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit
late Thursday ordered a stay in an order by Attorney General Edwin
Meese III allowing the newspapers to merge their business,
production and circulation department's under an exception to
federal antitrust laws.
   Michigan Citizens for an Independent Press, an organization of
advertisers and readers opposed to the newspapers' joint operating
agreement, had asked for the extension in a motion filed earlier in
the day.
   The court ordered the delay to gain time to study the complex
case, the court clerk's office said.
   The group last month successfully blocked the immediate merger
of the newspapers' business and production departments in a
challenge to a decision by then-Attorney General Edwin Meese III
allowing the joint operating agreement under the Newspaper
Preservation Act.
   The temporary stay granted by the U.S. District Court in
Washington forced the newspapers to recall laid-off employees and
quickly alter printing plans.
   U.S. District Judge George Revercomb on Wednesday rejected the
challenge and said he would allow the order staying the partial
merger to expire at 7:15 p.m. on Saturday.
   The appeals court's order Thursday means the combination will
not proceed on that schedule.
   The newspapers had not said how quickly then could have begun
joint production under the agreement after expiration of the
earlier stay.
   Free Press Publisher David Lawrence this week said the
newspapers would begin the operation as soon as they were legally
cleared to do so.
   The court issued its own order staying Meese's decision rather
than granting the opponents' request for a stay, thereby gaining
time to study the case without seeming to accept the contentions of
either side.
   After the Michigan Citizens group made its request, Assistant
Attorney General John Bolton filed an eight-page brief with the
appeals court opposing any stay of the agreement.
   The opponents of the merger ``have fallen far short of their
burden of showing that the attorney general acted so mistakenly
that his decision can be labeled irrational,'' said Bolton's brief.
   Bill Schultz, an attorney for Michigan Citizens, said after the
appeal was filed that his clients could show a stay was appropriate
because a lower court judge, in granting the earlier stay, had
agreed that allowing the merger to proceed prior to a court ruling
would produce ``irreparable injury'' and be contrary to the public
interest.
   Opponents of the agreement argued that Meese had ignored
findings that the Free Press was not a failing newspaper and that
financial losses by it and the News were caused by management
decisions rather than being inherent to the marketplace.
   Revercomb rejected that contention, saying that Meese had
reasonably found that the Free Press would have already failed were
it not owned by a large corporate parent, Knight-Ridder Inc.
   Knight-Ridder had no comment on the appeal, said Lee Ann
Schlatter, manager of corporate communications.
   Gannett also declined comment. ``We're simply waiting to see
what the appeals court does,'' said Sheila Gibbons, public affairs
manager. The News referred inquires to Gannett.
   The general manager of the Free Press, Bob Hall, said today,
``The stay that was issued is really an administrative stay, and
it's only issued for the convenience of the court to take some time
to look at the request for the stay,''
   The delay ``just gives the judges a couple of days to look at
the filings'' and has no bearing on the merits of the case.
   The merger of the newspapers' business, advertising, circulation
and production departments would result in layoffs of 600 to 800
employees.
   The Free Press had a daily circulation last year of 638,720,
compared with the News' 678,720, according to the Audit Bureau of
Circulation. On Sundays, the News held a slightly larger lead,
839,319 to 724,342.

   Considering what they have to put up with, you
could hardly blame Americans if they got down on themselves and
their economy, since it is full of gaps and crunches.
   Week after week they are reminded of wage crunches, tax
crunches, savings crunches, interest rate crunches and home
mortgage crunches. According to a popular magazine, the ranks of
middle management also are being crunched.
   It is an economy that critics say is filled with gaps. Most
glaring, of course, are the trade gap and the budget gap, but there
are also age gaps in corporations and a widening gap between stock
and bond yields.
   Whenever the economy seems to gather strength it is whacked back
by its custodians with talk of higher taxes or interest rates, or
with warnings of bad things to come. Sometimes they act, too, as
when the Federal Reserve raises interest rates.
   Isn't a strong economy what everyone wants? Of course, but not
too strong, says the Fed, because that might bring inflation, a
position that recently provoked economist Howard Ruff into wishing
he were in another business.
   Said Ruff: ``If I were a political cartoonist, I would depict
(Fed Chairman Alan) Greenspan giving a smiling patient, the
economy, a small shot of arsenic while explaining, `You're too
healthy for your own good.'''
   Seldom is optimism offered by those sages who claim to see the
future. And even when it is, it comes wrapped in dull brown paper
and contains a warning that the contents should be considered
dangerous.
   Think about this from an economist-educator: ``Although the
outlook for the economy continues to erode, and there has been a
clear upward shift ... to raise prices, there is no sign that we
are poised to enter a recession.''
   Considering all this, it speaks for the resiliency of the U.S.
consumer that confidence snapped back in August after having been
depressed in June and July.
   That news comes from the Conference Board, a non-profit
organization that regularly measures attitudes of thousands of
households throughout the country, the goal being to ascertain
their buying intentions.
   The latest survey revealed that a rising number of Americans in
August were more optimistic about current and future business
conditions than they had been in the previous two months.
   A greater percentage said that the economy would improve and
that jobs would become more plentiful over the next six months. The
farm mood was found to be improving. And households in general were
impressed by the economy's vigor.
   The professional watchers of the economy, however, will not be
impressed by such things. Instead, they will view this more
confident mood as a danger to be watched, lest it explode into an
inflationary buying boom.
   There is little new in such interpretations; the negative theme
has been ``in'' for more than a year among those who think they
understand how modern economies work.
   But what the ``experts'' sometimes may tend to overlook is the
endurance, economic understanding and sense of responsibility of
the U.S. consumer.
   Could it be that those qualities have something to do with the
fact that the seers' worst fears failed to occur over the past year?

   Ford Motor Co. on Thursday announced
plans to build a $68 million plant near Cadiz, Spain, to make
electronic engine control devices.
   Production is to begin in 1990 at the 100,000-square-foot
factory. When full production is reached about a year later, the
plant will employ about 350 people, the company said.
   The engine control module is the only product scheduled for the
plant now, but it may be expanded to produce other electronic
devices, said Ford spokesman Al Chambers.
   Products from the plant will be sent mainly to other Ford plants
in Europe.

<HEAD>Dollar Stuck in Tight Range in Europe, Gold Falls Sharply</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar finished mixed Friday after remaining
in a tight range during the European session, reflecting indecision
among market participants about the U.S. currency's direction.
   Gold prices tumbled as much as $6.50 an ounce in Europe, hurt by
what bullion brokers called investor disappointment with the
precious metal's declining value over the last few weeks.
   Traders said the dollar spent the day in a range of about 1.8700
West German marks to 1.8780 marks, roughly the same range it was
confined to Thursday. One trader said the market ``just doesn't
have an idea which way to push it.''
   Traders said fear of central bank intervention combined with
internal market resistance is preventing the dollar from rising,
but that the recent news of an improvement in the U.S. trade
deficit is supporting the currency.
   In London, the dollar fell against the British pound. It cost
$1.6758 to buy one pound, vs. $1.6675 late Thursday.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe compared with late Thursday
included: 1.8763 West German marks, down from 1.8775; 1.5835 Swiss
francs, up from 1.5820; 6.3795 French francs, up from 6.3790;
2.1151 Dutch guilders, down from 2.1160; 1,398.50 Italian lire,
down from 1,398.87; 1.2232 Canadian dollars, up from 1.2225.
   In Tokyo, where the business day ends before Europe's begins,
the dollar rose 0.31 yen to a closing 133.76 yen. Later, in London,
it was quoted at 134.25 yen.
   Gold fell in London to $412 a troy ounce, compared with $417.75
late Thursday. Brokers said that because of the metal's failure to
stay above the psychologically important level of $420, many gold
holders were selling.
   In Zurich, gold closed $411 compared with $417.50 late Thursday.
   Earlier in Hong Kong, gold fell $3.61 to close at $419.84.
   Silver bullion prices fell on the London market $6.40 a troy
ounce, compared with $6.44 Thursday.

   The stock market advanced slightly today in
activity swollen by the so-called triple witching hour.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 3.03 to 2,095.31 by
2 p.m. on Wall Street.
   Gainers slightly outnumbered losers in the overall tally of New
York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 695 up, 625 down and 549
unchanged.
   The session began with an outburst of activity by professional
traders closing out positions linked to expiring stock index
futures and options.
   Some of those September contracts were settled as of the

   In the last month of each calendar quarter, the simultaneous

individual stocks has become a familiar phenomenon, dubbed the

   Otherwise, analysts said the market was still drifting without

   The economy has obliged Wall Street lately by showing signs of
growing at a slower, and presumably more sustainable, pace, but the
markets' response hasn't been as enthusiastic as many observers
expected.
   Among actively traded blue chips, Exxon rose [ to 45[; General

   Hospital Corp. of America rose | to 44] on top of a 6|-point
gain Thursday, when a group of company exceutives proposed a buyout
at about $47 a share.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks added
.36 to 151.96. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index fell .22 to 297.48.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 140.95 million shares with two

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>

   Soybean futures prices plunged in late trading
Friday to close sharply lower on the Chicago Board as sellers
chased buyers and found none. Grain futures also closed lower.
   ``The market theoretically probes for the orders,'' said Steve
Freed, grain analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. in Chicago.
``In general we ran out of bullish news this week and when the
market started looking for consumption buying and speculative
buying, all it found was sell stops.''
   Sell stops are price levels that trigger large numbers of sell
orders. Massive selling of contracts for November delivery of
soybeans occurred at $8.71 a bushel and $8.66 a bushel, Freed said.
   The November soybean contract closed at $8.58 a bushel, more
than 27 cents below Thursday's final price.
   The declines in corn and wheat prices were not as sharp. Wheat
was supported by indications that new export business was
developing, Freed said, and corn futures drew some support from the
wheat market.
   At the close, wheat was 2{ cents to 7 cents lower with the
contract for delivery in September at $4.02 a bushel; corn was {
cent to 5{ cents lower with September at $2.79 a bushel; oats were
4} cents to 9 cents lower with September at $2.60\ a bushel;
soybeans were 16 cents to 27{ cents lower with September at $8.47 a
bushel.

   Stock prices gained ground today in activity

   Five minutes before the close, the Dow Jones average of 30

   Interco Inc., target of a $2.6 billion hostile
takeover bid by Cardinal Acquisition Corp., said Friday it was
talking with commercial banks about a possible recapitalization of
the company.
   Cardinal, headed by brothers Steven and Mitchell Rales of
Washington, D.C., has offered to buy the St. Louis-based
manufacturer and retailer of woman's apparel, footwear and
furniture for $70 a share. Interco has rejected the bid as
inadequate.
   Interco said in a filing with the Securities and Exchange
Commission that on Tuesday it had entered into an agreement with
certain commercial banks, which were not identified, about their
potential commitment to provide the financing for recapitalization.
Interco said the agreement involved the delivery of preliminary
documentation for the recapitalization proposal.
   Interco said it had not received any financing commitments.
   The company also said in its filing it was considering the sale
or restructuring of its Ethan Allen furniture unit as well as the
sale of its apparel manufacturing division and other assets.
   A recapitalization or sale of Interco's assets would be a
defensive step to thwart the Rales' bid.

   The stock market gained ground today in activity
swollen by the so-called triple witching hour.
   The session began and ended with outbursts of activity by
professional traders closing out positions linked to expiring stock
index futures and options.
   Some of those September contracts were settled as of the
opening, and others at the close.
   In the last month of each calendar quarter, the simultaneous
expiration of a set of index options, index futures and options on
individual stocks has become a familiar phenomenon, dubbed the
``triple witching hour.''
   Otherwise, analysts said it was difficult to read much into the
market's swings.
   The economy has obliged Wall Street lately by showing signs of
growing at a slower, and presumably more sustainable, pace, but the
markets' response hasn't been as enthusiastic as many observers
expected.

<HEAD>Eastern Airlines Pilots Take Case to Wall Street</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARCY GORDON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Eastern Airlines pilots, locked in a battle with
management, told financial analysts Friday the ailing airline may
have to be sold or merged with sister carrier Continental Airlines.
   ``Anywhere you look you can see the systematic destruction of
Eastern Airlines,'' said Daniel Vician, vice chairman of the Master
Executive Council of the Eastern pilots' union. ``This airline
cannot be turned around by labor concessions alone.''
   Vician said the union sees three possible options at this point:
negotiation of an acceptable contract agreement between the pilots
and Eastern management, a merger between Eastern and Continental or
a buyout of Eastern by an outside entity.
   Miami-based Eastern and Houston-based Continental, a non-union
carrier, are both subsidiaries of giant Texas Air Corp.
   Eastern continues to sustain heavy losses, posting a net loss of
$89.8 million in the second quarter. Eastern employees have accused
Texas Air Chairman Frank Lorenzo of siphoning off cash, in the form
of management fees, rents on planes and airport gates and
commissions on fuel purchases, from Eastern into its parent company,
   The pilots union and Eastern management are scheduled to meet in
contract negotiations by the end of the month. While Eastern
continues to seek cuts in labor costs, it has indicated it could
seek to freeze the pilots' wages and cut costs through attrition
and longer flying hours.
   The pilots may try to build ``fence agreements'' into the
contract, such as one allowing them to unionize Continental pilots,
according to union sources.
   The airline laid off 4,000 employees early this month. A federal
judge in Washington had ruled Eastern could not lay off unionized
personnel. But the U.S. Court of Appeals later dissolved the order,
saying the carrier would have to post a $4.7 million bond to cover
a month of paychecks should the unions win their case.
   Members of the Machinists union at Eastern began voting Friday
on a contract that would cut pay for mechanics by as much as 20
percent, with even sharper cuts for less-skilled workers.
   It is unusual for a union to advocate a merger. But Vician and
Farrell Kupersmith, an accountant at Touche Ross & Co. who is
working with the pilots, told the analysts a merger between Eastern
and Continental would remove the contentious issue of cash
transfers out of Eastern.
   ``There is no good merger in the (airline) industry with
responsibility to the employees,'' Vician told The Associated Press
after the meeting. ``It would not be our first choice.''
   As for another possible approach, a takeover of Eastern by the
pilots with outside financial backing, Vician said his union has
been advised that ``that is a futile effort.''

   The stock market gained ground Friday, riding
out the so-called triple witching hour involving a set of expiring
futures and options on stock indexes.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 5.87 to 2,098.15,
finishing the week with a net gain of 29.34 points.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 8 to 5 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
889 up, 562 down and 508 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 211.11 million
shares, up from 161.21 million in the previous session. Nationwide,
consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in
those stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter
market, totaled 238.33 million shares.
   The session began and ended with outbursts of activity by
professional traders closing out positions linked to expiring stock

   Some of those September contracts were settled as of the

   In the last month of each calendar quarter, the simultaneous

<HEAD>Gold Futures Plunge To 1{-Year Low</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Gold futures prices, undermined by slack investor demand due to
the improved economic scenario, plunged to their lowest level in 1{
years Friday on New York's Commodity Exchange.
   On other markets, prices for future delivery of silver, sugar,
cotton, oil, soybeans, grains and cattle all declined. Pork futures
gained and stock-index futures retreated.
   Gold for October delivery traded as low as $410 a troy ounce
Friday, the lowest price for near-month delivery since March 23,
1987, when the April contract dropped to $406.90.
   October gold settled Friday at $412.90, $6.90 below Thursday's
final price.
   Gold prices have been falling gradually all year, although they
stabilized during the summer in response to the inflationary
implications of the drought-driven rise in grain prices. Gold began
the year at about $480 a troy ounce.
   ``The price has been going down and it's still going down but
it's picking up some steam,'' said Craig Sloane, precious metals
analyst with Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Co. in New York.
   The main negative factor in the gold market is the improved
inflation outlook, analysts said. Gold historically holds its value
during times of rising prices, so demand for the metal typically
rises with prospects for higher inflation.
   Recent credit-tightening moves by the Federal Reserve have
slowed the growth of the economy and relieved inflationary
pressures.
   Sloane said gold prices probably would fall again on Monday
based on chart analysis that predicts the next point of firm
support at $390 a troy ounce.
   Silver futures also finished sharply lower, dropping rapidly in
the closing minutes of the session.
   Silver settled 14.1 cents to 15.2 cents lower with September at
$6.326 a troy ounce.
   Sugar futures skidded to a sharply lower finish on New York's
Coffee, Sugar & Cocoa Exchange on technical factors in the absence
of fundamental supply-and-demand factors, said Arthur Stevenson, an
analyst in New York with Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.
   Sugar settled .50 cent to .67 cent lower with October at 10.06
cents a pound.
   Cotton futures fell the 2-cents-a-pound permitted limit for the
second straight day on the New York Cotton Exchange as fears of
damage to cotton crops from Hurricane Gilbert continued to fade,
analysts said.
   Cotton settled 1.65 cents to 2 cents lower with October at 52.90
cents a pound.
   Energy futures also posted steep losses on the diminishing
prospects that Gilbert would seriously disrupt oil refinery
operations on the Texas-Louisiana coast, analysts said.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 32 cents to 33 cents
lower with October at $14.57 a barrel; heating oil was 1.33 cents
to 1.49 cents lower with October at 41.37 cents a gallon; unleaded
gasoline was 1.28 cents to 1.72 cents lower with October at 44.22
cents a gallon.
   Soybean futures prices plunged in late trading on the Chicago
Board of Trade as sellers chased buyers and found none. Grain
futures also finished lower.
   ``In general we ran out of bullish news this week and when the
market started looking for consumption buying and speculative
buying, all it found was sell stops,'' said Steve Freed, grain
analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. in Chicago.
   Sell stops are price levels that trigger large numbers of sell
orders.
   Wheat settled 4 cents to 6{ cents lower with September at $4.03
a bushel; corn was \ cent to 5 cents lower with September at $2.78}
a bushel; oats were 7 cents to 9\ cents lower with September at
$2.58 a bushel; soybeans were 16{ cents to 26 cents lower with
September at $8.47{ a bushel.
   Pork futures gained on technical factors on the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange while cattle futures finished mostly lower on
position-evening ahead of the Agriculture Department's monthly
seven-state cattle-on-feed report.
   The report, issued after the close, said the number of cattle
being fed for slaughter as of Sept. 1 in the seven major beef
states was down 2 percent from a year ago.
   Placement of new cattle and calves in fattening pens last month
was down 16 percent from a year ago while marketings of ``fed''
cattle were unchanged.
   Most analysts had expected the placement and marketing numbers
to be much higher. They predicted near-month cattle futures would
fall as much as 1 cent a pound on Monday in reaction to the report.
   Live cattle settled .05 cent to .57 cent lower with October at
69.95 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .18 cent lower to .10 cent
higher with September at 79.80 cents a pound; hogs were .02 cent to
.45 cent higher with October at 37.97 cents a pound; frozen pork
bellies were 1.93 cent to the limit 2 cents higher with February at
50.65 cents a pound.
   Stock-index futures advanced moderately on the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange. The contract for December delivery of the
Standard & Poor's 500 index settled 1.50 points higher at 271.65.

<HEAD>Bond Prices Drift Lower</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bond prices drifted lower Friday in sluggish
trading, pushing key interest rates back up to 9 percent again.
   The Treasury's closely watched 30-year issue declined [ point,
or $1.25 for every $1,000 in face value.
   The bond's yield, which moves inversely to its price and is
often an indicator of interest rate trends, edged up to 9.00
percent from 8.99 percent late Thursday. It had stayed below 9
percent for three days.
   Analysts said the market was stalled by conflicting sentiments.
   ``This was slow, slower, slowest,'' said Jay Goldinger, a
principal of Capital Insight Inc., an investment firm in Beverly
Hills, Calif. ``It was exactly a stalemate.''
   The decline occurred despite a new government report that
suggested some economic sluggishness.
   The Commerce Department said business inventories rose 0.3
percent in July after a 0.8 percent rise in June, while sales fell
0.2 percent in July, the first sales decline since January.
   William V. Sullivan Jr., director of money-market research for
Dean Witter Reynolds Inc., said the slowing of inventory investment
indicates ``the economy may be moderating, and that's basically a
friendly development for bonds.''
   But he said the bond market shrugged aside this report as well
as other signs of economic moderation over the past few days,
including a decline in August retail sales and a drop in energy and
commodity prices.
   ``Many investors are still concerned about the pace of economic
growth,'' Sullivan said. ``They think the trend in the economy is
still upward.''
   The worry is that the economy's growth will push inflation
higher, eroding the value of bonds and pressuring the Federal
Reserve to take steps to slow growth and push interest rates higher.
   Other bond investors, however, believe inflationary pressures
have eased, Goldinger noted.
   ``We've got some cross-currents here ... it's a big tug of
war,'' he said.
   In the secondary market for Treasury bonds, prices of short-term
government issues were unchanged to 1-16 point lower, intermediate
maturities declined 1-16 point to 3-32 point, and 20-year issues
lost 3-32 point, according to figures provided by Telerate Inc., a
financial information service.
   The movement of a point is equivalent to a change of $10 in the
price of a bond with a $1,000 face value.
   The Shearson Lehman Daily Treasury Bond Index, which measures
price movements on all outstanding Treasury issues with maturities
of a year or longer, slipped 0.78 to 1,144.49.
   Yields on three-month Treasury bills, meanwhile, fell to 7.36
percent as the discount declined 3 basis points to 7.14 percent.
Yields on six-month bills slipped to 7.74 percent as the discount
edged down 1 basis point to 7.36 percent. Yields on one-year bills
edged up to 7.98 percent as the discount rose 3 basis points to
7.45 percent.
   A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. The yield
is the annualized return on an investment in a Treasury bill. The
discount is the percentage that bills are selling below the face
value, which is paid at maturity.
   The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between
banks, was quoted late in the day at 7~ percent, down from 8\
percent late Thursday.

   Apple Computer Inc. is hoping an
updated version of its 12-year-old Apple IIc will sell briskly this
Christmas.
   The new machine is called Apple IIc Plus and is targeted at the
consumer market.
   An Apple IIc Plus with a monochrome monitor will sell for $859,
down from $950 for its predecessor. A color system will cost
$1,099, a drop from $1,203.
   Kevin McDonald, manager of Apple's home education marketing
group, said the price drop resulted from competition in the
consumer market.
   The main features of the Apple IIc Plus include a faster central
processor, allowing it to calculate more quickly; a built-in power
supply that makes the computer more compact and lighter in weight;
and a built-in 3.5-inch disk drive with more capacity than the
earlier 5.25-inch model.

<TEXT>
   The price of Time Inc. common stock shot up
nearly 10 percent Friday as a flurry of rumors swirled through Wall
Street about the entertainment and media giant.
   Time stock climbed $9.37{ a share to close at $106.87{ in
trading on the New York Stock Exchange.
   The company said it knew of no reason for the price rise.
   Analysts said rumors circulated during the day that Time planned
to sell its book operations, might merge with another company, had
become the takeover target of a major European publishing company
and had hired a prominent firm specializing in leveraged buyouts.
   J. Kendrick Noble, a securities analyst for PaineWebber, said
that while there might be a ``grain of truth behind each of the
rumnors, I don't believe there is anything significant happening at
Time Inc. at the moment.''
   He said the market might ``be looking for the next target''
after Macmillan Inc., which is the subject of competing takeover
offers.
   Asked to comment on the sharp stock advance, Time spokesman Lou
Slovinsky said, ``We know of no reason why our stock has risen.''
   He added that the compoany did not comment on rumors or its
proprietary business relationships.
   Time, which has about 58 million shares of common stock
outstanding, is one of the world's largest magazine and book
publishers and has interests in pay television services as well as
in cable television.
   In the six months ended June 30, it reported a profit of $150
million, or $2.58 a share, up from $124 million, or $2.06 a share,
a year earlier. Revenue rose to $2.17 billion from $1.98 billion.

<HEAD>Omaha Farm Credit Bank To Receive $110 in Aid from Feds</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Farm Credit Bank of Omaha, Neb., will get
up to $110 million in federal aid, the Farm Credit System
Assistance Board announced Friday.
   Eric P. Thor, the board's chief executive officer, said the
assistance was approved after an extensive review of the bank's
current and projected financial situation and proposed credit
managment plan.
   The aid will ``help the bank regain financial viability'' and
save between $150 million and $250 million over the next several
years, he said.
   ``Without assistance, the bank may not be in a strong enough
financial position to successfully carry out its plan for the
future,'' Thor said. ``The support provided under the law should
make the difference.''
   As authorized by the board, the Omaha bank will receive the
assistance by selling up to $110 million in preferred stock to the
Farm Credit System Financial Assistance Corp.
   The Agricultural Credit Act of 1987 provides that the
corporation will fund that assistance through the sale of 15-year
bonds, and the U.S. Treasury will pay interest on those bonds for
the first five years.
   Thor said the law also requires the Treasury and the Farm Credit
System, or FCS, to each pay half of the interest on the bonds in
the second five years. The FCS will assume full responsibility in
the final five years, and the Omaha bank must repay the assistance
at the end of the 15-year period.
   The Omaha Federal Land Bank and the Federal Intermediate Credit
Bank merged on July 6, forming the Farm Credit Bank of Omaha, which
provides comprehensive banking services to farmers and ranchers in
Iowa, Nebraska, South Dakota and Wyoming.
   The 1987 law created the board to work with troubled FCS
institutions. It was chartered on Jan. 21, 1988, and comprises
three members: Agriculture Secretary Richard E. Lyng, Acting
Treasury Secretary Peter McPherson and Indiana farmer William W.
Erwin.

<HEAD>Report: Sundstrand Agrees To Record Defense Fraud Settlement</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sundstrand Corp. has agreed to pay the
government close to $100 million in a record defense fraud
settlement involving alleged schemes to overbill the Defense
Department for airplane parts, according to Business Week magazine.
   A story in the magazine's Sept. 26 issue, released Thursday,
quoted unidentified sources it said were familiar with the case as
saying the company would enter a guilty plea in the next few weeks,
as part of a sealed agreement in federal court in Chicago.
   Business Week said its sources also indicated Sundstrand faces
possible suspension by the Pentagon, which accounts for 42 percent
of the company's $1.4 billion in annual sales.
   Furthermore, several senior Sundstrand executives could be
indicted as soon as next month for their alleged roles in the
scheme, the magazine stated.
   ``I have no idea what they're going to print so there would be
no way I could comment,'' Sundstrand spokesman Claude Vernam said
when contacted by The Associated Press.
   Even after company officials have read the Business Week
article, Vernam said he did not expect Sundstrand to comment beyond
what it has disclosed in its quarterly reports.
   The aerospace contractor revealed in a 1987 financial filing
with the government that it would face criminal charges resulting
from two federal grand jury investigations into alleged overcharges.
   Sundstrand reported that the government was seeking repayment of
$13.5 million plus interest and $102.9 million plus interest in two
separate disputes over contract pricing.
   Sundstrand is based in Rockford, Ill., and operates a subsidiary
in Redmond, Wash., near Seattle, that is part of its Advanced
Technology Group.
   In its annual report to the Securities and Exchange Commission
earlier this year, Sundstrand acknowledged the ``government has
advised that it intends to charge the company with criminal
violations'' in Rockford and Seattle.
   Sundstrand, which makes flight data equipment, engine start-up
systems and other electronic equipment for commercial and military
aircraft, said in its SEC filing that it was ``in the process of
entering a settlement in one or possibly both actions.''
   Such settlements, the company also noted in the filing, ``could
result in the imposition of materially adverse fines and
penalties.''
   Sundstrand began putting money in reserve two years ago to cover
settlement and legal expenses related to the dispute. The company
added $76 million in the second quarter to the reserve, which
already held $50.2 million, resulting in a $16.5 million net loss
for the period.

<HEAD>Nebraska Firm Buys Gallup Organization</HEAD>

   Selection Research Inc. of Lincoln, Neb.,
has purchased the Gallup Organization, a merger that probably will
not bring major changes in Gallup's research and polling work,
officials said Friday.
   SRI, which bought the polling firm for an undisclosed price, is
a private market research firm.
   ``We know that the Gallup name is synonymous with a tremendous
amount of integrity,'' said SRI vice president Gale Muller. ``It
will help us to get a lot more reliable information.''
   ``We have helped in the data gathering over other projects in
the past. We are familiar with each others' methodologies,'' Muller
said.
   The companies have worked together since 1985 on hospital
research, and SRI acquired part ownership of Canadian Gallup Poll
Ltd. of Toronto in 1986. Those moves led to the merger, said Andrew
Kohut, Gallup president.
   ``The (acquisition) will allow Gallup to be part of a larger
network of resources,'' Kohut said in a telephone interview. While
survey methods are not expected to change initially, the combined
resources of the companies will enable Gallup to develop new survey
techniques, he said.
   Alec Gallup and George Gallup Jr. will remain co-chairmen of the
board of the Gallup Organization, which conducts polls and surveys
for businesses and institutions.
   SRI, with headquarters in Lincoln, is an employee-owned firm
with about 1,000 workers.

<HEAD>Coleco Posts $193.3 Million Second Quarter Loss</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WEST HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Coleco Industries Inc., the
toy-making giant that is reorganizing under bankruptcy protection,
reported a $193.3 million second quarter loss on Thursday, due
largely to one-time restructuring costs.
   The loss compared with a profit of $752,000, or 4 cents per
share, in the year-earlier quarter.
   Second quarter sales plunged to $15.4 million from $146.1
million a year earlier.
   Company officials said the net loss included about $105 million
related to restructuring costs and expenses associated with current
plans to downsize the business.
   These costs reflect the company's decision to dispose of its
outdoor product lines and various operating facilities, company
officials said. Also included in the costs are the renegotiation of
certain product distribution and royalty agreements, company
officials said.
   Of the remaining $88 million of the loss, the company attributed
about half to virtual elimination of sales activity due to a lack
of funds to acquire and ship products, company officials said. The
rest of the loss came largely from the discontinuance of certain
products, company officials said.
   The closing date for the second quarter was extended to July 11,
when the company filed a Chapter 11 petition seeking protection
from creditors under the federal bankruptcy laws.
   In the six months ended July 11, Coeco lost $240.7 million,
compared with an $8.1 million loss in the year-earlier period.
Sales fell to $89.2 million from $270.5 million.
   The company has slashed its work force in an effort to cut
costs. It has fewer than 600 employees in the United States, down
from an average of 2,500 a year ago.
   The company produces Cabbage Patch Kids, Alf dolls, Big Wheels
palstic tricycles and board games, such as Scrabble. Industry
sources say the company controls about 5 percent of the nation's
toy market.

<HEAD>Gold Slumps to 18-Month Low; Dollar Mixed</HEAD>

   Gold prices tumbled nearly $7 a troy ounce in
busy trading Friday to the lowest point in 18 months, hurt by a
tide of fresh selling and evidence that inflation remains subdued.
   The dollar was mixed in slow trading.
   Republic National Bank in New York quoted gold bullion at
$411.75 as of 4 p.m. EDT, down $6.75 from its level of late
Thursday and down $18.05 from late Wednesday, a combined loss of
more than 4 percent. Gold had not traded that low since March 1987.
   Bullion brokers said people who had hoarded gold as a hedge
against inflation were becoming impatient and exasperated because
the metal had been falling in value relative to some
interest-bearing investments.
   ``These people are disappointed and shocked and adding fuel to
the fire,'' said Steven Pepper, vice president and bullion dealer
at Republic National Bank. ``The more selling that comes in, the
more these people are in a panic.''
   Moreover, recent economic statistics in the United States
suggest inflation will not rise nearly as much has some gold
holders had expected, heightening prospects that the metal could
test $400 an ounce. Gold has not been that low since December 1986.
   ``There's been a lot of new selling,'' said Michael Kramer,
senior gold trader at MTB Banking Corp., a New York metals concern.
``The feeling is you might see $400 gold real soon here. I think
next week you'll see $400 gold.''
   Lawrence Schoen, director of Midland Montagu Metals in New York,
said that based on a technical analysis of gold-price trends, the
metal could fall as low as $375 an ounce. He predicted more gold
investors would dump their holdings.
   ``They've been holding it and holding it, and it does nothing
for you,'' Schoen said. ``Meanwhile you can earn 8 percent or more
on a short-term Treasury bill.''
   Some traders said there was evidence of big sell orders
emanating from the Middle East and Australia. Others said the
Soviet Union, one of the world's biggest gold producers, had
unloaded a large amount of bullion in the Swiss market to raise
cash.
   Gold fell in London to $412 from $417.75 late Thursday; in
Zurich to $411 from $417.50; and in Hong Kong to $419.84 from
$423.45. On the Commodity Exchange in New York, bullion for current
delivery fell $6.90 to $411.70.
   Silver fell on the London market to $6.40 a troy ounce from
Thursday's $6.44 close. On the New York Comex silver for current
delivery fell 14.1 cents an ounce to $6.326.
   In foreign-exchange trading the dollar varied slightly in value,
reflecting what money brokers called an uncertain outlook for the
U.S. currency and resilient fear of central-bank intervention to
keep the dollar stable.
   In Tokyo, the dollar rose 0.31 yen to 133.76 yen. Later in
London it strengthened to 134.25 yen. In New York the dollar
fetched 134.12 yen, higher than its 133.77-yen level late Thursday.
   The British pound strengthened against the dollar to $1.6758,
vs. $1.6675 late Thursday. In New York, the pound sold for $1.6787,
marginally weaker than its $1.6790 level late Thursday.
   Other late-dollar rates in New York compared to the levels of
late Thursday: 1.8711 West German marks, down from 1.8747; 1.5807
Swiss francs, down from 1.5823; 1.2232 Canadian dollars, up from
1.2225; 6.3630 French francs, down from 6.3763; and 1,399.00
Italian lire, up from 1,398.70.
   Other late-dollar rates in Europe compared vs. late Thursday:
1.8763 marks, down from 1.8775; 1.5835 Swiss francs, up from
1.5820; 6.3795 French francs, up from 6.3790; 2.1151 Dutch
guilders, down from 2.1160; 1,398.50 Italian lire, down from
1,398.87; 1.2232 Canadian dollars, up from 1.2225.

<HEAD>Judge Declines to Take Quick Action on Grocery Merger</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A federal judge, saying a quick ruling would
be ``almost shooting from the hip,'' declined to make a decision
Friday on whether to allow the $2.5 billion merger of Lucky and
Alpha Beta to proceed.
   After three hours of arguments by attorneys, U.S. District Judge
David Kenyon asked for more data on the ``relevant market area''
affected by the proposed merger.
   Attorneys said they could supply the information by Wednesday
and Kenyon said he would rule soon after that.
   Kenyon left in place a temporary restraining order which bars
completion of the acquisition of Lucky by American Stores, parent
company of Alpha Beta.
   California Attorney General John Van de Kamp has filed suit to
stop the merger. He claims that transaction coupled with the recent
merger of Safeway and Vons supermarkets will decrease competition
and mean higher prices for California consumers.
   Deputy Attorney General Chester Horne argued that the merger
violates the Clayton Antitrust Act and said that the U.S. Supreme
Court has never approved a merger between two such gigantic market
chains.
   He suggested the merger will virtually eliminate ``mom and pop
grocery stores,'' which will be unable to compete against the
giants.
   ``Without the entry of signficant competititors there will be no
competition in this state if this merger is allowed to go
through,'' Horne said.
   Attorney Frank Rothman, representing American Stores Cos., the
parent company of Alpha Beta, said the consumer will benefit
because Alpha Beta plans to adopt Lucky's low-price structure.
   When Kenyon expressed skepticism about whether low prices would
last, Rothman responded that if the chain raised prices, ``Everyone
else in the marketplace would cut our heart out.''
