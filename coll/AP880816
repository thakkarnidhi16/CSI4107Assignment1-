   Vanquished presidential candidate Pat
Robertson appealed to his conservative, largely fundamentalist
Christian supporters Tuesday and urged them to ``rally with
wholehearted support'' behind George Bush.
   ``This party is about to nominate a man that I have come to
respect and admire,'' Robertson told the Republican National
Convention in television prime time. ``This man can and will lead
our nation proudly into the future.''
   Robertson, the TV evangelist whose presidential star faded
quickly in an often-acrimonious primary campaign, described Bush as
``a principled conservative'' and dismissed suggestions that his
backers would sit out this election.
   ``We care because it does matter,'' Robertson said.
   As expected, Robertson's backers, who had hoped to make the
convention their own, staged only a brief demonstration waving blue
and white signs and brightly colored umbrellas.
   His late-night speech came as many attending the convention
began slipping out of the hall for the evening, leaving big blocks
of empty seats. Two of the networks cut away from his speech in
favor of other convention coverage as Robertson went several
minutes past prime time.
   Robertson has spent the convention's opening days preaching
party unity, and praising the conservative direction the party
charted in its platform.
   Now, he said, it's time for conservatives and fundamentalists to
join the Bush campaign.
   ``I release my delegates and alternates who have come to this
convention and urge you and all of my friends across America to
give your enthusiastic support to our party, our candidates and our
presidential nominee,'' Robertson said.
   ``It matters to us and our children whether we vote Democrat or
whether we vote Republican,'' Robertson said.
   Robertson also attacked Democratic nominee Michael Dukakis as
``the most liberal candidate ever put forward for the presidency by
any major party in American history'' and said Democrats ``do not
speak for America today.''
   In one of the sharpest attacks of the convention on Democrats
who held their convention last month, Robertson insisted ``the
liberal mind set reigns supreme'' in that party.
   ``Now the Democratic Party has discovered the family,''
Robertson said. ``But let's keep in mind that they want you and me
to be in one family with Jim Wright as the daddy, Barbara Mikulski
as the momma and Ted Kennedy as the big brother.
   ``They offer unlimited government, massive transfers of wealth
from the productive sector of society to the non-productive, and
ever-increasing regulation of the daily lives of the people and
their children.''
   In his prime-time speech and in a joint appearance with George
W. Bush, the vice president's son, earlier Tuesday, Robertson
sought not only to bring his supporters into the Bush camp but also
to cement his role as a leader of the GOP's conservative wing and
guarantee a future that might include another run for the White
House, backers said.
   Robertson's presidential hopes died early this year in an often
bruising campaign, and some strategists worried that his backers,
many of them fundamentalist Christians involved for the first time
in politics, would simply drift away without strong urging from
Robertson.
   ``Michael Dukakis is a card-carrying member of the ACLU
(American Civil Liberties Union), an organization dedicated to
removing all public affirmation of religious faith in America,''
Robertson said. ``As president, Michael Dukakis will pack the
federal courts with ACLU radicals.''

   The big summer heat wave rolled on Tuesday with temperatures
boiling past 100 to record highs from the eastern Plains to the
Ohio Valley, but the steamy Northeast finally got a break with a
surge of cooler, drier air from Canada.
   Utilities posted more records for demand for electricity as air
conditioners and fans were turned on full blast.
   Some school districts in Illinois plan to open schools early and
reduce class periods by almost half when school opens next week to
avoid the hottest part of the day.
   ``By noon during summer school, it was very uncomfortable. If it
was 90 outside, it was 95 to 100 in the classrooms. That's not a
good atmosphere for learning,'' said associate principal Don
Tokarski of Rantoul Township (Ill.) High School.
   ``I think this will be the hottest weather of the summer, taking
both temperature and humidity into account,'' said Norm Reitmeyer,
a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Louisville, Ky.
   ``We've had an oppressively hot and humid summer without a
doubt,'' Reitmeyer said. ``But particular days such as this or
tomorrow are rare.''
   The temperature at Paducah, Ky., reached 102 degrees and
Reitmeyer said that and the humidity would push the heat index, a
measure of how hot it feels, the opposite of winter's wind chill
factor, to 115. He said that is near life-threatening for some
people.
   Kentucky has had a total of 48 days of above-90 degrees this
summer.
   Milwaukee reached a record high of 100 degrees, and that made it
a record five times the city has hit 100 or higher this year. The
old record was four times in 1936.
   Some other records included 90 at Duluth, Minn.; 104 at Fargo,
N.D.; 103 at Fort Dodge, Iowa; 103 at Huron, S.D.; 102 at
Indianapolis; 102 at Madison, Wis.; 101 at Peoria, Ill., and Sioux
Falls, S.D.; and 102 at Springfield, Ill., the National Weather
Service said.
   The 103 degrees at Rockford, Ill., was the hottest reading since
July 27, 1955. La Crosse, Wis., marked the 44th day that the
temperature achieved the 90 degree mark, another record.
   The 102-degree heat wilted about 10,000 competitors wearing
heavy uniforms and carrying musical instruments at the Drum Corps
International World Championships on the artificial turf at
Arrowhead Stadium in Kansas City, Mo.
   ``You can feel it right through your tennis shoes,'' said Donald
MacDougall, a member of the Edmonton Strutters of Canada. ``One of
our melophone players almost passed out.''
   The 136th Indiana State Fair opened Tuesday with livestock
exhibitors taking extra precautions, like putting ice in front of
large fans to keep animals cool. Four chickens that were to be
entered died when their owners left them in cars with the windows
rolled up, fair officials said.
   The official high in the 48 contiguous states at 3 p.m. EDT was
105 degrees, not in Texas, Arizona or southern California but at
Chamberlin, S.D.
   But nature's own air-conditioning _ in the form of a cool front
from Canada _ settled over the Northeast. Unfortunately, forecasts
said the heat would soon return.
   After 32 days of 90-degree temperatures and swamp-like humidity,
including a high of 97 Monday, New York City had a high Tuesday of
merely 86 degrees. And the humidity was only around 39 to 42
percent, making it feel almost like early autumn compared to
preceding weeks.
   ``The downturn in temperatures is certainly going to help not
only Con Ed but all New York utilities,'' said Bill Murphy,
spokesman for the utility that supplies New York City's power.
   Con Edison had a record demand Monday of 10,160 megawatts of
electricity. The failure of several feeder cables on Staten Island
knocked out service to more than 13,000 customers. And earlier
Monday, the utility cut off power to 16 large apartment buildings
on Manhattan's Upper East Side to prevent a wider blackout after
several feeder cables failed, blacking out some 10,000 residents.
   The cooler air also brought relief for utilities in
Pennsylvania, where Philadelphia Electric Co. was forced to impose
a 5 percent voltage reduction Monday. But the clash of the hot and
cool air also touched off thunderstorms, which knocked out power to
thousands of customers across the state Monday.
   Farther south, utilities across Kentucky reported record
electrical demand Monday and expected to exceed those amounts
Tuesday, but no problems were reported.
   ``We've been going wild this summer,'' said Dick Lovegrove, a
spokesman for Ashland-based Kentucky Power, which had records for
power use almost every day during the past week.
   Louisville Gas & Electric has set all-time peaks 13 times this
summer, said spokesman Calvin Anderson.
   The Tennessee Valley Authority, the big federal utility, hit
another record peak summer demand Tuesday of 21,304 megawatts. A
record Monday of 20,618 megawatts forced the utility to buy about
2,500 megawatts from neighboring utilities, said Robert C. Steffy
Jr., senior vice president of power for TVA. TVA's all-time power
peak was in the winter of 1983 at 22,478 megawatts.

   Former President Gerald R. Ford said Tuesday
that Democratic chants of ``Where Was George?'' unfairly distorted
and belittled George Bush's accomplishments in a long career of
government service.
   In a speech to the Republican National Convention, Ford praised
Bush for his experience and competence, saying, ``For 45 years
George Bush has been at the center of the action in the service of
this great republic.''
   Ford said Bush does not deserve to have Democrats ask: ``Where
Was George?''
   The 38th president was joined at the lectern by his wife, Betty,
who said she was delighted to work to send George and Barbara Bush
``to the White House where they belong.''
   The convention was a half hour behind schedule when Ford began
and many of the delegates had already left the hall. But the
television networks, who had been scheduled to end their coverage
at 11 p.m. EDT, stayed with the convention.
   Obviously stung by the chanted question at last month's
Democratic convention when Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass.,
questioned Bush's influence in the Reagan administration, Ford
offered this retort:
   ``I'll be damned if I will stand by and let anyone with a smirk
and a sneer discredit the honor, service, accountability and
competence of George Bush.
   ``If the three Democratic standard-bearers in this campaign
think it is about competence,'' Ford said, ``let any one of them _
or all three of them put together _ top the demonstrated competence
of George Bush.''
   The former president was referring to Democratic nominee Michael
Dukakis, vice presidential candidate Lloyd Bentsen and former
presidential contender Jesse Jackson.
   Ford accused the Democrats of attempting to steal the American
dream at their convention _ a dream he said belongs to the nation
and all of its people.
   ``No party, no politician has a patent on our dream,'' he said.
``The American dream belongs to you and nobody can take it away
from you.''
   In an echo of his losing campaign against Jimmy Carter in 1976,
Ford asked his audience, ``Do we really want to go back to the days
of spend and spend and tax and tax _ of a government in Washington
with its head in the clouds and its hand in your pocket?
   ``I can put it no plainer than this: This year's Democratic
ticket is a tax increase waiting to happen,'' he said.
   In a backhanded slap at Dukakis, Ford said Bentsen was ``pretty
solid on defense matters.''
   Rhetorically addressing Bentsen, Ford said: ``Governor Dukakis
says you'll be the kind of vice president who will march into the
Oval Office and tell him: `Mr. President, that is a perfectly
ridiculous policy.'''
   Ford added, ``Lloyd, with all the differences between the
Democratic leaders, why wait? Speak up now.''

   A ``swat'' team is out to attack a bat
problem.
   But the specials weapons in this case are tennis rackets, brooms
and nightsticks, which police are using to swat the flying
creatures in a running battle with them.
   Iowa City police officer Mike Brotherton bagged a bat early
Sunday and said it was the 10th bat call city police have gotten in
five days.
   Rachel Wegner had fallen asleep watching TV and awoke to see her
dog's head going back and forth as it watched a bat circle the
living room. She called police.
   ``I'm petrified of bats,'' she said. ``It seemed to like where I
was sleeping, so I grabbed a blanket and waited on the porch. I was
wearing my pajamas.''
   When Brotherton arrived, he turned on the lights to coax the bat
to sleep. The bat landed on a wall where Brotherton pinned it with
his nightstick. The bat slid into a paper bag, he said.
   ``Usually at night they keep flying, and you have to pin them
with a broom or swat them with a tennis racket,'' he said.
``Normally I can get them by the third swing.''

   The bride wore white lace, the groom
wore a top hat, and both had tails. But that was OK, for the
wedding was for the dogs.
   When Mark and Janice McGregor of Fruitport bought a female
Pomeranian puppy, Foxy Lady, to breed with their 5-year-old male
Pomeranian, Tiny, their daughter thought something was amiss.
   ``My 10-year-old daughter, Majorie, thought that they should be
married before they had puppies, so we decided to go ahead and do
it,'' Mrs. McGregor said.
   And as long as there was going to be a wedding, Mrs. McGregor
figured it should be done right.
   She rented a tuxedo for Tiny and a dress for Foxy, decorated the
front porch with flowers and invited neighborhood children to
Saturday's ceremony. The bride and groom were led by leash to the
altar to the tune of the ``Wedding March,'' and Mrs. McGregor
performed the ceremony.
   The couple's honeymoon will be in Paradise, a town where the
McGregors spent their honeymoon. But the newlyweds will be
chaperoned by the McGregor family, who'll be vacationing.
   Mrs. McGregor expressed relief when the wedding was over.
   ``Tiny's really been showing that he's interested in Foxy, and
we didn't want a shotgun wedding,'' she said.

   The charity Sonoma County Wine Auction
drew nearly $100,000 in bids over a wine-soaked weekend, but the
most astonishing sale of the event was of a large bottle of water.
   Through a proxy, Koichiro Ikawa, executive of the Nissan Trading
Co. of Japan, paid $950 for a redwood-packed, 3-liter bottle of
Mendocino Beverage Co. mineral water.
   Bidding on the big bottle started at $200, and Ikawa's bidder
and an unidentified Texas man pushed the price up to levels that
drew gasps from the audience.
   The water, besides the qualities usually attributed to mineral
water, contained a special essence _ truffle juice.

<DATELINE>NEVE DEKALIM, Occupied Gaza Strip (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Jewish settlers are
digging in their heels, determined to stay in this seaside strip
even in the face of resurgent Palestinian violence that led the
army to clamp an indefinite curfew.
   They say they are drawn by an improved quality of life in their
tiny, closeknit communities and a pioneering spirit. But heightened
violence in the Israeli-occupied territory has taken its toll.
   Six Israelis leaving Neve Dekalim after a visit this week were
injured in a firebomb attack. From the settlement, Israelis can
often see tires burning and hear gunfire in the nearby Khan Yunis
refugee camp.
   Jewish settlers here, however, say they will not be frightened
away.
   ``We must not let the situation change the normal course of our
lives. That's just what the Arabs want,'' Shimshon Kahilker, a
21-year-old seminary student, said in an interview Tuesday.
   The Palestinian uprising against Israel's 21-year occupation
began in Gaza eight months ago and tensions have remained high.
   Of the more than 240 Palestinians killed in the rebellion, about
a third were in the strip. Four Israelis also have died.
   About 2,000 Jewish settlers share Gaza with 650,000
Palestinians, about two-thirds of whom are refugees living in
poverty in overcrowded camps.
   If the Gaza Strip is a hurricane, then the Jewish settlements
are its eye. Neve Dekalim could be a pleasant suburb if one forgot
its location.
   Some families in this settlement about a mile from the
Mediterranean live in homes with manicured lawns and palm trees.
   Whereas the Arabs have been confined round-the-clock to their
homes during a curfew that began Sunday night, the small community
of Jewish settlers in Gaza can come and go as they please.
   On Tuesday, Yitzhak Tasa sat outside the municipal building
selling plastic chairs, coolers and umbrellas for the beach.
   Security concerns, however, are prevalent. Neve Dekalim is
circled by barbed wire fences and regularly patroled by Israeli
troops. An armed soldier rode in the front seat of a bus bringing
settlers home.
   ``Two weeks ago I was driving with my children in a car and
someone threw a gigantic rock which broke the window,'' said Ruth
Elizur, a 28-year-old teacher and mother of three who moved to Neve
Dekalim from Jerusalem two weeks ago.
   ``Immediately after that we saw a burning tire blocking the
road. It was a frightening drive. I shook all over,'' she said.
   But Mrs. Elizur said she had no intention of leaving ``because
the settlement offers me the kind of life I want.''
   ``It's wonderful for children,'' agreed Sima Elmaliach, 28.
``They have an excellent religious education.''
   Mrs. Elmaliach said the latest firebomb attack troubled her,
``but we very much believe in God, and we believe that if something
has to happen to somebody, it will happen anywhere.''
   Far fewer settlers live in Gaza than in the occupied West Bank,
and Foreign Minister Shimon Peres has suggested resolving the
Palestinian conflict by giving up the strip in return for a
negotiated settlement.
   But Bini Wiesel, a settler who has lived here for 3{ years,
opposes any such solution.
   ``The numbers don't matter,'' said the 32-year-old music teacher
and father of six. ``The question is whether we have a right to
live in our country _ all of it. Any Arab who accepts that can
stay, and those who don't should leave.''
   Elyada Yovel, a 14-year-old from Neve Dekalim, also opposes
moving. He said he never thinks of the rebellion on busy
schooldays, ``but on Saturdays, we go up on the hill to see the
action. We hear shooting in the refugee camp.''
   ``But I still go to the beach'' near the refugee camp, he said.
``What's there to be afraid of? Where could you find such quality
of life, except in Switzerland?''

<HEAD>U.N. Panel Votes For Investigation Of Romanian's Disappearance</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GENEVA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A U.N. human rights panel voted Monday to have the
secretary-general investigate the case of a Romanian specialist who
disappeared without completing a report on youth and human rights.
   Dumitru Mazilu had been given a mandate by the U.N.
Subcommission on the Prevention of Discrimination and Protection of
Minorities to present a report to the panel's current meeting in
Geneva.
   In a letter sent to the subcommission last April and distributed
by members, Mazilu said the Romanian government had pressured him
to drop the study, forced him to retire from a Foreign Ministry
post, confiscated his passport and put him under police
surveillance.
   By a vote of 16-2, the subcommission asked Secretary-General
Javier Perez de Cuellar to inform Romania's communist authorities
of the ``urgent need to establish personal contact'' with Mazilu
and to report back by Wednesday.
   The motion, sponsored by the French and Norwegian delegates,
also urged Perez de Cuellar to establish Mazilu's whereabouts and
arrange a visit to him by a member of the subcommission.
   Romanian officials told the subcommision that Mazilu could not
complete the report or attend the Geneva meeting because of a heart
condition. They said Mazilu recently left Bucharest, the Romanian
capital, to undergo treatment at a health resort, but they did not
identify the resort.
   After several days of debate the motion was passed with the
Soviet Union and Romania voting against it, four delegates
abstaining and three not voting.
   Soviet delegate Stanislav Chernichenko said the case was an
administrative matter that had ``nothing to do with human rights''
and the subcommission had overstepped its mandate by attempting to
give Mazilu ``quasi-diplomatic status.''

<TEXT>
   AIDS would rank as the 15th leading cause of
death in the United States if it were counted as a separate
category, according to new figures from the National Center for
Health Statistics.
   Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome killed between 12,450 and
13,820 Americans last year, the center estimated in its first
annual summary including separate figures for the disease.
   While AIDS has not yet been added to the rankings of major
causes of death published by the agency, the 1987 toll would have
placed it 15th on the list, ahead of birth defects, the agency
noted.
   The center's annual summary of vital statistics also disclosed
that in 1987, America had the most births in nearly 25 years and
the most deaths ever, and that marriage and divorce rates were at
the lowest level in more than a decade.
   The report said that 65 percent of AIDS victims were white males
and 25 percent black males with between 4 percent and 5 percent
each being black and white females.
   The age groups most affected were 25 to 34 and 35 to 44, the
study added.
   AIDS is a contagious disease that attacks the body's immune
system, rendering it incapable of resisting other diseases and
infections.
   The disease is spread most often through sexual contact, needles
or syringes shared by drug abusers, infected blood or blood
products, and from infected pregnant women to their offspring. The
chief victims have been homosexual men and intravenous drug users.
   As of Aug. 8, AIDS had been diagnosed in 70,208 Americans, of
whom more than half, or 39,620, have died, according to the Centers
for Disease Control.
   A slight increase in fertility, coupled with the huge number of
women in their prime childbearing years, resulted in the estimated
3,829,000 babies born last year, the most since 1964, the report
showed.
   Millions of people born in the post World War II Baby Boom are
now in their 20s and 30s and, after completing school and launching
careers, have begun families.
   That has led to a sharp increase in total births in recent
years, although the nation's fertility rate of 66.1 births per
1,000 women aged 15 to 44 remains about half that of the late 1950s
when the Baby Boom was at its peak.
   Social scientists have begun referring to the recent surge as an
``echo'' of the Baby Boom.
   Deaths in 1987 totaled 2,127,000, up from 2,099,000 a year
earlier and the most ever recorded for a single year in the United
States. Record numbers of deaths have become common in recent years
as the nation's population includes an ever larger share of elderly
people.
   The national death rate of 8.7 per 1,000 people in 1987 was
unchanged from a year earlier, the report noted. Life expectancy at
birth also was unchanged at 74.9 years.
   The report disclosed small increases in life expectancy last
year for white men and black women, and small declines for white
women and black men.
   Harry Rosenberg of the center's mortality branch said
statisticians won't be able to determine a reason for those changes
until they have more time to study the detailed figures.
   Among causes of death, heart disease declined somewhat last
year, as it has for the last several years, the report found. There
also was a decline in the rate for accidents, other than those
involving motor vehicles. Death rates for other major causes of
death did not show statistically significant changes.
   The nation's marriage rate for 1987 was 9.9 weddings per 1,000
people, the lowest since 1977 when it was also 9.9.
   Divorce also was low last year, at a rate of 4.8 per 1,000
people, the lowest since 1975. It peaked at 5.3 in 1979 and again
in 1981.
   Here is a rundown of the estimated number of deaths in the
United States last year for the 15 leading causes. AIDS is included
under the category of ``all other infectious and parasitic
diseases,'' which showed a growth in deaths from 9,030 in 1986 to
19,160 last year, but such ``all other'' generalized categories
were not part of the ranking system.

<HEAD>Clutter Of Signals Obscures Heavens For Radio Astronomers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL RECER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Electromagnetic clatter from millions of
manmade sources is drowning out whispers from the heavens and
crippling research by radio astronomers who probe distant stars,
scientists say.
   Marcus Price, a radio astronomer at the University of New
Mexico, says the machines of modern America _ from car engines, to
computers, to automatic garage door openers _ are helping to
pollute the airwaves with electromagnetic garbage.
   ``The radio spectrum is a natural resource and, as with any
natural resource, it can get polluted,'' Price said in an interview
while attending an astronomy conference Monday. ``It's not like air
or water pollution because you can't see it, but it's there.''
   For that reason, he said, astronomers are anxious that
unnecessary uses of radio signals be eliminated. In many cases,
gross radio interference sources could be controlled with the use
of filters or shields that would add only a dollar or two to
manufacturing costs, he said.
   ``The radio spectrum is a vital part of our everyday life,''
said Price. ``Every time you order a pizza or call for an
ambulance, it's probably radio dispatched and there's another
signal. That's why we worry about this limited resource being used
for frivolous purposes.''
   Electromagnetic gridlock is only one type of pollution affecting
astronomers. At a meeting this week sponsored by the International
Astronomical Union, astronomers from around the world said their
work also is hampered by manmade light, and by debris left in space
that reflects sunlight and causes streaks on astronomy photographs.
   For radio astronomers, the electromagnetic spectrum can help
unlock secrets of star formation millions of light years away. Each
type of molecule, when excited by heat, puts out a unique radio
signal. By capturing and analyzing these signals, radio astronomers
can determine the chemical composition of processes taking place at
points in the universe not even visible to optical telescopes.
   This work has defined the shape of Earth's home galaxy,
discovered key components in the lives of stars, and confirmed
formation of complex chemicals within galaxies and stars.
   Radio astronomers explore virtually every portion of the
spectrum to catch the faint, distant star symphony, but Price said
continuation of this work is threatened now by the sudden rise of
manmade radio signals.
   ``In the last five years, we've seen an explosion of use of the
radio spectrum for consumer devices,'' he said.
   Many of these signals could be shielded from the environment.
   Spark plugs in automobiles, for instance, he said, create a
slight radio signal every time they fire. This could be corrected
for about $2 per vehicle, said Price.
   Cellular telephones, computers, handheld calculators and
electronic toys all add to the clutter, he said, and all could be
filtered and shielded for small cost.
   Price said radar signals used for defense, air traffic control
and even highway speed-checking guns all put out signals in
portions of the spectrum important to astronomy. So do television
stations.
   A new Soviet navigation system is threatening to blot out study
of the hydroxyl radical, a key part of the chemistry of water and
of some organic chemicals. Research on this molecule could give
important clues to the existence of life beyond the Earth.
   Radio astronomers are able to detect the hydroxyl radical at
1600 to 1700 megahertz on the spectrum. A system of navigation
satellites now being deployed by the Soviet Union would operate
constantly at this same portion of the radio band.
   ``It is impossible to study this molecule when they (the
satellites) are above your horizon,'' he said. The strong Soviet
navigation signal simply blots out everything else in that portion
of the spectrum, said Price.
   ``Eventually, the navigation system will cover the whole Earth
and we could lose the ability to study the hydroxyl radical,'' he
said. ``This robs you of considerable information.''
   Price said astronomers recognize that little can be done to
control the growing use of the spectrum for important services such
as aircraft control and communications. But the scientists hope
that the Federal Communications Commission and the world community
will take measures to control the ``unnecessary and frivolous use
of a diminishing resource.''
   And, Price said, astronomers recognize that eventually they'll
have to leave the Earth and its cacophony of electronic noise, if
they are to continue studying the dim electronic voice of the
universe. But where would they go?
   ``The backside of the moon has been designated as a quiet
zone,'' he said. ``It would be shielded against the signals from
Earth. That's about our only choice.''

   Millions of Americans with adjustable
mortgages and other variable-rate loans are in for further shocks
this year if the Federal Reserve keeps up its anti-inflation
campaign as many economists are predicting.
   Many Americans already have seen their credit costs rise this
year because of credit tightening on the part of the central bank.
   As Fed policy-makers gathered to map monetary strategy behind
closed doors today, some economists were predicting that the
central bank already has decided that even higher rates are
necessary to slow an economy being buffeted by rising inflationary
threats.
   The meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee comes one week
after the Fed, in a surprise move, boosted its discount rate by
one-half percentage point to 6.5 percent, its highest level since
July 1986.
   An increase in the discount rate, the interest the Fed charges
to make loans to commercial banks, is the most dramatic signal the
central bank can send of its intention to push interest rates
higher as a way of dampening demand and thus fighting inflationary
pressures.
   The timing of the discount rate increase was a surprise for many
economists who had expected the all-Republican Fed board, led by
Chairman Alan Greenspan, to shy away from such an overt
credit-tightening move in an election year.
   While analysts said they don't expect another boost in the
discount rate until after the November election, they said the Fed
very likely will continue tightening credit by more subtle means.
   Since late March, the Fed has been reducing the reserves banks
have available for making loans, driving up a variety of short-term
interest rates. The federal funds rate, which is the interest banks
charge to make overnight loans to each other, has now risen to 8
percent and many economists predicted it would climb by another
one-half percentage point in coming weeks.
   Major banks followed the Fed's lead last week and boosted their
prime lending rate from 9.5 percent to 10 percent, a three-year
high. Analysts predicted that with further Fed pressure, the prime
rate will climb to 10.5 percent in the next two months.
   ``I am looking for further tightening steps based on a
perception by Fed policy-makers that the economy is growing too
strongly,'' said David Jones, an economist at Aubrey G. Lanston &
Co., a government securities dealer.
   Because the prime rate is used to calculate a wide range of
consumer loans, from adjustable mortgages to home equity loans, the
rate hikes will be felt quickly by consumers, analysts said.
   They also predicted further increases in traditional fixed-rate
mortgages. A national survey by the Federal Home Loan Mortgage
Corp. said fixed-rate mortgages jumped to 10.57 percent at the end
of last week, up almost a percentage point from their February low.
   Allen Sinai, chief economist at the Boston Co., said fixed-rate
mortgages will hit 11 percent within a month with the only question
being how much higher they may go before the end of the year.
   ``The economy has a tremendous head of steam, particularly in
the industrial sector,'' he said. ``History has shown us that once
our economy develops boom-like conditions, it takes tougher
restrictive policies to bring accelerating inflation under
control.''
   Analysts pointed to a variety of recent statistics which
indicate inflation is a growing problem.
   The government reported last week that wholesale prices shot up
at an annual rate of 5.7 percent in July, compared with an increase
of 2.2 percent in 1987. Some economists predicted that consumer
prices could be climbing at a 6 percent annual rate within six
months.
   And on Monday, the government said industrial output climbed 0.8
percent in July, the biggest increase since last October and an
advance which put further strains on many industries already
operating at close to top capacity.
   ``If the Fed doesn't continue to tighten in this environment, at
least in a moderate way, then it will have to tighten two or three
times as much if it waits and inflation gets more out of hand,''
Jones said.
   But Jerry Jasinowski, chief economist of the National
Association of Manufacturers, said he believes the Fed will wait
awhile before it takes any further tightening moves.
   ``I think they wanted to send a signal to the markets last week
that inflation was their top priority,'' he said. ``Now that they
have done that, they will lay back on their oars and see how the
economy develops in the third quarter.''
   Many economists are predicting that overall economic growth, as
measured by the gross national product, will slow somewhat in the
last half of the year, compared with an annual rate of increase of
3.3 percent in the first half of 1988.

   The drought has brought mixed results to farm
machinery sales this year, although preliminary readings by the
Agriculture Department show that crop expansion plans for 1989
could have some effect.
   Spending on farm machinery rose in 1987 after seven years of
decline to $5.77 billion from $4.61 billion in 1986, according to a
report by the department's Economic Research Service.
   Currently, largely because of brisk sales early in the year, the
agency forecasts 1988 machinery expenditures may range from $5.7
billion to $6.2 billion.
   ``The farm machinery industry will be hurt if farmers with
reduced cash receipts put off buying new equipment,'' the report
said. ``Demand for harvesting, drying and storage equipment is most
likely to be affected.''
   However, the report added that the drought has prompted greater
sales of irrigation equipment in some parts of the country.
   Farm machinery sales rose to a record of almost $12 billion in
1979 before staring a 60 percent slide to $4.61 billion in 1986,
reflecting the crunch on farm income, high interest rates and tight
credit in the early 1980s.
   Analysts said last year's improved sales stemmed from ``enhanced
financial conditions for farmers'' in 1987, notably a record net
cash income nationwide of $56 billion. Net cash income _ the
difference between gross cash receipts and cash expenses _ is
forecast at $53 billion to $59 billion this year.
   Despite the drought, analysts said there are some good signs:
farmland values as of February were up 3 percent, on the average,
from a year earlier, and total farm debt is at its lowest level
since 1979.
   ``Higher interest rates and drought likely will repress some
demand for machinery in the remainder of 1988, but sales are still
likely to rise,'' the report said.
   Drought in the Corn Belt and spring wheat states probably will
hurt machinery sales because of reduced cash flow to pay bills or
take on new debt.
   ``However, those farmers who produce a crop will benefit from
higher commodity prices,'' the report said. ``Farm machinery
purchases not affected by the drought are expected to rise.''
   Looking ahead at total ``input'' requirements, which includes
machinery as well as other items for production, the report said
prospects for spring planting in 1989 ``appear promising since the
1988 drought will reduce commodity stocks and increase commodity
prices. This should increase planted acreage in 1989 and thereby
increase input demand.''

   Higher grain prices are putting a crunch on
cattle feeders and are helping to trim placement of cattle and
calves in feedlots this summer, according to Agriculture Department
analysts.
   As of Aug. 1, cattle being fed for the slaughter market in the
seven major beef states totaled 6.84 million head, up 2 percent
from a year ago and 8 percent more than inventories of two years
ago, the department said Monday.
   The placement of new cattle and calves in fattening pens last
month was reported at 1.25 million head, down 2 percent from a year
ago and down 19 percent from two years ago.
   Marketings of ``fed'' cattle in July totaled 1.77 million head,
up 4 percent from a year ago and also up 4 percent from two years
ago. Officials said those were the most July feedlot marketings
since the 7-state estimates began in 1972.
   According to USDA economists, market prices of Choice steers on
the Omaha, Neb., market are expected to average $65 to $69 per 100
pounds this summer, compared with $72.81 in the April-June quarter.
Prices are projected at $66 to $72 in the fourth quarter.
   Meanwhile, drought has reduced grain production and sent prices
higher, translating into higher cattle feeding costs. As it looks
to USDA economists, the forecasts of fed cattle prices are about
$100 per head below break-even levels.
   As of Aug. 1, feedlot inventories were larger than a year
earlier in California, Colorado, Kansas and Nebraska but were less
in Arizona, Iowa and Texas. The seven states produce about
three-fourths of the nation's beef.
   State feedlot cattle inventories are listed here for the seven
states. The first number is the number of cattle, in thousands, as
of Aug. 1, and the second number is the percentage of a year
earlier.

   The opening of Malaysia to U.S. corn sales
last year was an encouraging development in a market historically
dominated by Thailand, says a trade report by the Agriculture
Department.
   ``Although it is likely that the United States will have a hard
time maintaining a market presence (in Malaysia) once Thai supplies
return to normal, the sales last year provided an opportunity for
Malaysian users to become more familiar with the qualities of the
U.S. product,'' the report said.
   Malaysians liked U.S. corn for its consistent quality, lower
moisture and exporter reliability, among other reasons, the report
said. But on the plus side for Thai corn was its shipment size of
only 500 to 1,000 metric tons, already bagged, and its lesser
shipping time.
   The brief report is included in a forthcoming issue of Foreign
Agriculture magazine.

   Trombone player Harry Hibbard, dying
of cancer, has decided to be on hand for a celebration of big
band-era music rather than throw the party posthumously.
   Hibbard, 66, said he's dreamed for years that his musician
friends would gather after his death for a ``big jam session.'' But
in the six months since he was diagnosed as having inoperable lung
and liver cancer, he's decided to hold the celebration while he's
still around.
   The Labor Day event at Grand Traverse Resort will feature the
Tommy Dorsey Band. Admission is free.
   ``I just made up my mind,'' said Hibbard, who founded the
Riverboat Six, a local Dixieland band, 30 years ago and is now in a
nursing home. ``I've got no kids, I've had some money saved. I
thought, `What can I do for all the people who were so faithful
coming to our dances?'''
   Hibbard, a World War II bomber pilot and owner of a flower shop
and mortuary here, has hired a lawyer to make sure the party goes
on if he doesn't survive until Labor Day, friends said.
   The party will realize Hibbard's dream that he ``go out New
Orleans style,'' said Bud Bechtold, who has known Hibbard for 50
years.
   Hibbard said he booked the Tommy Dorsey Band because it plays
the music he loves best.
   ``I wanted people to hear this band because they are one of the
finest bands playing today,'' he said. ``It's happy music.''

   Pop singer Lulu is expecting her second child, but
concedes that having another baby at age 39 is a ``daunting''
prospect.
   ``I'm surprised because really we had given up hope,'' said
Lulu, born as Marie McDonald McLaughlin Lawrie.
   She and her husband, hairdresser John Frieda, have an
11-year-old son, Jordan.
   ``We waited for a long time after Jordan was born before we
thought seriously about adding to the family and now we're
delighted,'' she said Monday. ``It is daunting being a mum again at
40 but I feel better and more comfortable as I get older.''
   Lulu, whose birthday is Nov. 3, is starring in the musical
``Peter Pan'' in west London's theater district. But she said the
baby, due in April, means she will have to pull out of a fall tour.
   Lulu rose to fame in 1964 with her hit, ``Shout,'' and her role
in the 1969 Sidney Poitier film ``To Sir With Love.'' She was
previously married to singer Maurice Gibb of the Bee Gees pop group.

   A man is pressing an assault complaint
against talk-show host Morton Downey Jr. after being grabbed and
pulled by the shirt during a confrontation in which the's man
sister slapped Downey.
   Sunday night's scuffle occurred during a forum, modeled after
Downey's show, which attracted 2,000 people.
   Paul Bass, 28, executive editor of The New Haven Independent,
and his sister, Sharon Bass, battled verbally with Downey again
Monday when they appeared on the ``Sally Jessy Raphael'' TV show.
   ``I was foolish enough to think I could have an intellectual
debate with him,'' Bass said Monday.
   Playing the peacemaker, Raphael had Bass shake hands with an
apologetic Downey. Downey hugged Bass and gave his still visibly
angry sister an unwanted kiss on the cheek.Downey then announced he
would not file civil charges against Bass, as he had threatened.
Bass also said he would not pursue civil action.
   But Bass said he was not withdrawing his assault complaint.
   Sunday's confrontation erupted as Bass was challenging Downey's
claim that his show and philosophy represents the ``voice of the
people.''
   Downey said he grabbed Bass by the shirt, pulled him out of his
chair and began pulling him across the stage after he told the
newspaper editor he wanted him off the stage and Bass didn't move.

   If the coonskin hat fits, wear it.
   But while Fess Parker, one-time ``king of the wild frontier,''
said he is pleased about Walt Disney Studio's ``Davy Crockett''
television revival, he won't play in the series.
   Parker, who starred in the 1954-56 TV show, said Monday that the
new series ``is a compliment to the man.''
   ``He's durable, he's fun, he's exciting, and I hope they do him
justice,'' the 64-year-old actor said. ``He stands for some very
strong American values.''
   Parker, who would have played an elder statesman in the remake,
declined to say why he refused a role.
   The show is based on the life of Crockett, an expert
frontiersman and marksman and a colonel in the Tennessee militia.
Crockett also served in the Tennessee Legislature in the 1820s and
1830s.
   Parker said he was asked by the show's executive producer,
William Blinn, to appear in the first two-hour segment, but
declined the offer.
   ``It was very nice to be asked and I am a great fan of the
producer,'' he said. ``However ... they're big boys and can run
their own boat.''
   Blinn said Sunday that Parker would appear in the first segment.
   The new ``Davy Crockett'' will be rotated on NBC's weekly ``The
Magical World Of Disney'' with three other features.

<TEXT>
   An FBI agent testified Monday he was
turned down for nine promotions because he is Hispanic and that the
agency kept a dossier on his wife because she started El Paso's
first rape crisis center.
   Puerto Rico supervisory special agent Armando Lara also
testified that his supervisor told him he was the first choice for
one job but was turned down because he was a subject of an
investigation into alleged illegal arms sales to the Contra rebels
in Nicaragua. He denied any such dealings, and said the FBI found
no evidence to support the charge.
   Lara is among 311 Hispanic agents who have joined a class-action
lawsuit before U.S. District Judge Lucius Bunton. The lawsuit
contends the FBI discriminates against Hispanics in hiring,
promoting and disciplinary matters.
   The non-jury trial is expected to last two weeks and about 100
witnesses are expected to be called.
   The lawsuit was filed in January 1987 by Bernardo ``Matt''
Perez, assistant agent in charge of the El Paso office. From 1979
until 1982, Perez worked at the San Juan, Puerto Rico, office _ a
bureau considered an undesirable assignment by agents because of
the island's high crime rate and isolation.
   Personnel Director David Rarity Jr. testified the FBI does not
discriminate against Hispanics, and said Hispanic agents are
transferred to Puerto Rico because they are more likely than other
agents to speak Spanish.
   Lara said he was heavily pressured into applying for a transfer
from El Paso to San Juan. After two months in San Juan, he was
transferred to isolated Aguadilla on the island's northwest coast.
   After five years there, Lara was transferred to Gallup, N.M. _
officially listed by the FBI as a hardship office because of the
town's isolation and quality of life.
   Lara said the last time he was turned down for a promotion was
after the FBI became aware he was participating in the lawsuit.

   John H. Sweet, longtime U.S. News & World
Report executive who retired in 1982 as chairman of the magazine's
board of directors, has died at age 81.
   Sweet, who also had served as publisher, president and chief
executive officer of the news magazine, died Sunday of heart
failure at a nursing home in this Washington, D.C., suburb.
   Sweet came to Washington in 1946 and joined the old World Report
magazine as its circulation manager. Two years later, when World
Report merged with U.S. News, he became circulation director of the
new publication.
   Sweet later headed the advertising and the research and
promotion departments before becoming executive vice president and
publisher in 1951.
   He was named president of the magazine in 1958 and was promoted
to board chairman and chief executive officer in 1973. He stepped
down as CEO in 1981 and as board chairman the following year.
   During his years with the magazine, it grew from a circulation
of 250,000 and revenue of $3.4 million to a circulation of more
than 2 million and advertising revenue of more than $70 million a
year.

<TEXT>
   Former Nevada Sen. Paul Laxalt praised
President Reagan Monday as an uncomplaining gentleman who didn't
lose touch with his friends once elected president.
   Laxalt, longtime friend and ally of Reagan, added during
introductory comments prior to Reagan's speech to the Republican
National Convention that the president ``faithfully stuck to his
conservative guns.''
   He told the convention delegates that Reagan laid to rest the
oft-repeated line that ``you can't be a nice guy and make it in
this world of politics.''
   Laxalt, who managed three Reagan presidential campaigns and was
a Nevada governor when Reagan governed California, also said Reagan
will leave the presidency with more friends than when he arrived in
Washington eight years ago.
   At the same time, he said Reagan has kept his campaign promises
and will continue long after he leaves the White House to decry big
government and high taxes.
   After his speech, Laxalt said of the president, ``Ronald Reagan
has had more influence on the Republican Party than any individual
I've ever known.''

   It took lots of drinking water and wet
towels, but Laurie Cousins and Sheryl Fordin weathered a broiling,
shadeless afternoon to be first in line Monday night for a
candlelight procession past Elvis Presley's grave.
   ``It's an honor to be first, and to look back and see all those
candles lit is just unbelievable,'' said Ms. Cousins, 37, of
Winnipeg, Canada.
   The gates to Graceland, Presley's former Memphis residence,
opened at 10:30 p.m. for the procession expected to draw more than
5,000 fans marking the 11th anniversary of the singer's death.
   Ms. Cousins and Ms. Fordin of New York took up their position at
the Graceland gates at noon and waited through a humid afternoon
with a high of 99 degrees.
   ``The thing is not to dehydrate,'' said Ms. Fordin, 37.
   ``I love Elvis. He will live forever in our hearts,'' she said.
``I bought an Elvis pillowcase and I can't wait to sleep on it.''
   Presley died of heart disease at Graceland on Aug. 16, 1977, and
the faithful return each year to mark the anniversary.
   With Presley recordings playing in the background, the fans
queued up at the Graceland gates, touched candles to a torch
lighted by an eternal flame and walked single file up a winding,
200-yard driveway past the singer's grave.
   ``It helps keep his memory alive,'' said Gene Carothers, 37, of
Gnadenhutten, Ohio, who sported an Elvis pompadour and a
6-inch-wide leather belt with dangling loops of chain.
   Before joining the procession, Carothers signed autographs and
posed for pictures with other fans at a souvenir shopping center
across the street from Graceland.
   ``It's just something to look back on,'' said Cory Tarrants, 26,
of Dallas, who had her picture taken with Carothers. ``And besides,
Mama said to take a lot of pictures.''
   Presley, his mother, father and paternal grandmother are buried
beside the swimming pool at Graceland in a small plot called
``Meditation Garden.'' The garden was covered with stands of
flowers sent by fans, and many participants in the candlelight
vigil carried flowers to leave at the grave.
   Presley originally was buried at a cemetery three miles from
Graceland, but his body and his mother's were moved to the garden
in October 1977. The singer's father and grandmother died after the
grave site was established.
   No one takes a count of participants in the annual graveside
procession which lasts into the early hours of Aug. 16, said Jack
Soden, Graceland manager.
   ``The estimates have always ranged from 5,000 to 10,000. I just
don't know (how many take part), but I would say at least several
thousand,'' he said.
   Many fans are upset this year by a recently published book
called ``Is Elvis Alive?''
   The book includes claims that Presley staged his death.
   ``It's a sad and cruel exploitation,'' Soden said. ``We've
endured a lot of tasteless exploitation over the last 11 years.''
   Graceland draws more than 600,000 tourists a year and for the
past six years, Elvis fans have been offered a nine-day series of
events each August called ``Elvis International Tribute Week.''

<HEAD>GOP Speechwriters Ready To Write `Generic' Veep Speech</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Even before George Bush announced his choice
of a running mate, aides were preparing to craft the words the
mystery person will say while accepting the nomination.
   Speechwriters planned to write a ``generic'' speech that would
be tailored at the last minute to fit the running mate, along with
similar speeches to place that name in nomination.
   The name can be filled in later.
   Fred Malek, Bush's convention manager, said the draft speeches
would set out broad themes the campaign wants to stress on the
convention's closing night, with the running mate to polish the
language later.
   ``By Wednesday morning ... we will have one or two writers
working on a generic kind of acceptance speech which the nominee
would then have to take and modify and put into his or her own
style of words,'' said Malek.
   Organizers of the convention are orchestrating even the smallest
detail in an effort to put on a polished television performance.
   Each speech delivered from the podium is reviewed by Bush's
speechwriters, who edit and revise it to fit that evening's chosen
theme and to squeeze it into allotted time limits.
   Malek insisted they need a head start on the running mate's
Thursday speech to have the time necessary to prepare such a
high-profile address.
   ``It's a generic kind of a speech, it's a draft,'' Malek said.
``The nominee will not learn of his or her selection until Thursday
morning.''
   Bush has said he won't reveal his selection until Thursday
morning, only hours before that candidate must deliver the
prime-time acceptance speech. In addition, organizers will be
scrambling to line up another luminary to nominate the No. 2
candidate and still others to second the nomination and make the
introduction.
   ``We've got two other, three other addresses, really, to go
along with it,'' Malek said. ``They will be also in the same
sequence. We'll have one or two writers working on an acceptance
speech and another working on a nominating speech.
   ``We won't start this until Wednesday,'' he said. ``They will
have no clues, nor will I, on who it's going to be.''
   Malek said he would have been happier with more time for writers
to work on the speech, but that it's not his decision.
   ``A good writer, with some general directions and general clues,
can get a running start,'' Malek said.
   He said organizers haven't decided yet who will give the
nominating speeches, but ``we are developing some ideas of who are
good speakers and could do it.''
   Part of the problem, Malek said, is that not only must those
picked to introduce the vice presidential nominee be good speakers,
they must also have some logical connection to the new candidate,
or to the campaign theme that Bush signals with the pick.
   ``I think it's going to be all right, I think we have the
caliber of people to do the nomination,'' he said. ``I don't have
any great trepidations about that. Obviously they could do a better
job with more time.''

   It wasn't exactly love at first sight. They
are, after all, both conservatives.
   But what started as rhetoric blossomed into romance for Alvin
Kukuk, a Robertson delegate, and Janet Rungtranont, who was for
Kemp.
   They met following a Michigan Republican convention, exchanged
phone numbers at a delegates meeting, and courted at a Conservative
Union conference. What better place to pop the question, Kukak
thought, than at the biggest shindig of them all, the Republican
National Convention?
   The mingling of love and politics in New Orleans seemed
especially fitting to Kukuk, inspired as he was by the nation's
first married vice presidential prospects, Bob and Elizabeth Dole.
   And so it came to pass, on a Mississippi riverboat, with jazz
music playing softly in the background and the entire Michigan
delegation on board, that Kukuk, a 51-year-old township supervisor,
picked Rungtranont, a 45-year-old college registrar, to be his
running mate.
   They'll be tying the knot in November, right after the election.
They thought it best to wait; Kukuk is running for county
commissioner.
   The morning after the big night, they strolled through the
Superdome in matching Styrofoam campaign hats. There was no
shortage of people taking the same walk in the same hats, but
somehow, you just couldn't miss them as they floated along bumping
into the walls, each of them displaying a yard-and-a-half of teeth.
   ``When you get to be 51, you're so set in your ways,'' said
Kukak, who's been single for 20 years. ``It gets harder and harder
to find someone who'll put up with you.''
   ``When you get to be 45, the odds of finding someone who's right
for you diminish greatly,'' said his fiancee. ``I never thought I'd
find the right man.''
   She found him at a seafood restaurant just off the thruway. ``I
stopped to eat on the way home from the state convention and in
walked Al,'' she said. ``The place was empty except for us, and he
figured out from the bumper stickers on my car where I'd been. My
heart wasn't going pitter-patter. But my heart was kind of
curious.''
   They met again at a delegates' meeting, where they arranged to
attend the conservative conference. By this point, Rungtranont's
interest was no longer purely platonic. ``I probably wouldn't have
driven down to Detroit if I hadn't been getting interested,'' she
said.
   After the conference, they had dinner. They talked mostly of
politics. Still, there was something other than hot air in the air.
   On Easter, Al made the 160-mile round trip from his home in
Mount Clemens to hers in Caro, where he met her three children.
That clinched it. They haven't missed a weekend since.
   She had a feeling the proposal was coming. ``He dropped some
pretty broad hints,'' she said. The ``hints'' included telling a
reporter on board the boat that ``something big might happen
tonight.''
   Something did. Al took Janet to a quiet corner and presented her
with a gold-and-diamond engagement ring. The rest of the delegation
was off listening to the jazz musicians. ``All we heard was the
flutter of the wind and the whoosh of the water,'' he said.
   That and the pitter-pat of their hearts.

<HEAD>As Keynoter, Jersey's Kean Will Preach ``Inclusion''</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BOB McHUGH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW ORLEANS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   If George Bush was born with a silver spoon
in his mouth, New Jersey Gov. Thomas Kean was born with a whole
place setting.
   But despite wealth, blue blood and Ivy League exterior, Kean
preaches a ``politics of inclusion'' unusual for his party. In
promoting opportunities for the poor, workers, blacks and other
minorities, Kean has gotten Democrats to vote for him.
   The theme appears in Kean's book, ``The Politics of Inclusion,''
and Kean will hit upon it in his keynote speech tonight at the
Republican National Convention.
   Despite being a less-than-riveting speaker, Kean was born to
public life.
   He is the son of the late Rep. Robert W. Kean, a 20-term House
member, and his ancestors include several members of Congress and
New Jersey's first constitutional governor.
   Forebear John Kean was a contemporary of George Washington, who
appointed him first cashier of the Bank of the United States. In
New Jersey, the family's influence is testified to by Kean College
and the town of Keansburg.
   Thomas Kean first saw politics at his father's elbow. The boy
commuted between the family's home in Washington and their estate
in Livingston, N.J., where he still lives with his wife and their
three children.
   Kean attended Princeton University in New Jersey, and earned a
master's degree in history from Columbia University. He taught high
school and later had a stint at running the family real-estate
business.
   Kean was elected to the state Assembly in 1967 and was picked
its speaker in 1972 and 1973. He failed in his first bid to gain
his party's gubernatorial nomination in 1977.
   But Kean's election to the Statehouse four years later, and his
1985 re-election make one of the state's most dramatic political
tales.
   In 1981, Kean emerged from a field of eight would-be GOP
governors to win the nomination by less than 40,000 votes. It was a
landslide compared with what was to come.
   Kean won a narrow victory in the general election over
Democratic Rep. James Florio, eking out a win by 1,677 votes.
Florio called for a recount, and both candidates set up transition
teams in preparation for taking office.
   Weeks later, the recounted results confirmed Kean's election by
1,797 votes, the smallest margin in state history.
   Four years later, voters retained Kean by the biggest-ever
margin, with 70 percent of the vote and majorities in all but three
of New Jersey's 567 municipalities.
   To accomplish the win, one aide said, Kean attempted to tread
every inch and shake every hand in his small but diverse state. As
nervous aides fidgeted, the governor kept motorcades and planes
waiting while stopping to answer every question his constant press
following could come up with.
   With a style too awkward to be bogus, Kean convinced voters he
was for real.
   One staff members recalls a night when the governor tried to
share a beer with his staff. But when the six-pack was passed, Kean
couldn't figure out the screw-top bottles.
   Kean, 53, has repeatedly said his programs are aimed at creating
opportunity both for business owners and workers, as well as the
poor. It's a political theme not unlike that of Democratic
presidential nominee Michael Dukakis.
   Kean has concentrated on the ``philosophy and history of the
Republican Party _ a philosophy that allows Republicans to go
beyond the country clubs and the suburbs,'' as he wrote in his book.
   Though mentioned as a possible Bush running mate, the moderate
Kean has few admirers on the GOP's far right. While loyal to
President Reagan, the governor breaks often and openly with the
White House.
   Sen. Gordon Humphrey, R-N.H., one of the Senate's most
conservative members, has threatened to walk out on Kean's speech
because of the governor's ideologically impure stance on abortion.
Though personally opposed, Kean does not back a constitutional ban.
   Praise for Kean has come from unexpected places: Dukakis, joking
in 1986, said that, ``He's the best Democrat in the Republican
Governors Association.''

   Former presidential candidate Alexander Haig
on Monday called Democratic nominee Michael Dukakis a ``diminutive
clerk'' in a sharp and personal convention speech that drew an
immediate disclaimer for George Bush's campaign.
   When Haig's presidential star faded early, he declared his
support for Senate Republican leader Robert Dole of Kansas.
   In his convention speech Monday, Haig endorsed Bush and then,
despite Bush's efforts to dissuade him, delivered a strong attack
against Dukakis.
   Haig referred to Dukakis as a ``diminutive clerk from
Massachusetts.''
   Haig also compared the Democratic Party to a bat ``flying
erratically for brief periods at low levels and hanging upside down
for extended periods in dark, damp caves up to its navel in guano.''
   In contrast, Haig said, Bush represented ``safe and progressive
change, safe in that George Bush will build on the solid
accomplishments of the Reagan presidency.''
   Bush workers were clearly unhappy with the tenor of Haig's
remarks.
   ``We don't think that was an appropriate sequence of words,''
said Bush convention manager Fred Malek. ``That was Al Haig's
choice, it wasn't ours.''
   Malek said organizers of the convention, who carefully review
every word spoken from the podium, first saw Haig's speech nearly a
week ago and tried to convince him to tone down the rhetoric.
   ``We definitely told him we did not think that was a good thing
to do,'' Malek said. ``At one point, I thought he agreed with us
but then he slept on it and decided it was what he wanted to do.''
   In orchestrating this week's convention, GOP leaders have
carefully chosen a theme for each night, and have insisted they
want to stay away from personal assaults on Dukakis. Monday night's
theme was to highlight the successes of the Reagan administration.
   Malek's criticism was echoed in somewhat milder terms by House
Minority Leader Robert Michel of Illinois.
   Michel argued that there's a time and a place for harsh assaults
and Monday's convention speech was neither.
   ``I don't look upon that as the kind of campaign we would
wage,'' Michel said.
   ``Those were his words and his choice,'' Malek said.

<HEAD>Mrs. Dole Acknowledges Gender Gap, Asks Women To Have Open Mind</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Elizabeth Dole, confronting George Bush's
gender gap with women voters, is urging women to ``have an open
mind'' and work with the party for changes in child care and other
matters affecting the family.
   One of George Bush's potential running mates, Mrs. Dole was
cheered as she spoke to the Republican National Convention on
Monday night about the ``freedom'' women had achieved through job
programs during the Reagan years.
   ``Good jobs, not bad jobs. Real work, not make work. That's our
freedom. Are we going to let them take it away?'' she asked, as the
convention hall responded with a resounding ``No!''
   Mrs. Dole dealt head-on with one of the most troubling problems
for the Republicans this year: polls show that female voters are
disproportionately supporting Democrat Michael Dukakis over Bush.
   ``Today's strong economy means stronger families, and we affirm
the woman who chooses to work in the home,'' said Mrs. Dole, who
spent seven years working in the Reagan administration, including
four years as secretary of transportation.
   ``But our strong economy has also provided needed jobs for
millions of women,'' she said, ``and let me say to the women of
America: I respect the fact that some of you have questions. I also
ask you to have an open mind.''
   She said that Reagan's ``incredible jobs machine'' has created
more jobs for Americans, and two-thirds of the 17 million new jobs
created since 1982 went to women.
   ``I ask you, women of America, not just to support us. ... Work
with us to change what needs to be changed,'' she said. ``The
future belongs to our children, and child care is one of those
changes.''
   Dukakis has endorsed the concept of the $2.5 billion ``better
child bill'' now pending in Congress, which would provide aid and
impose new regulations for child care programs.
   Bush wants to give $2.2 billion in tax credits to families
earning less than $20,000 a year to help them pay for child care in
any setting they wish.
   Dukakis ``wants to march our kids lock step to a government
institution where Washington will set all the rules ... but people
work part-time, full-time, night shift, day shift, swing shift. One
size does not fit all,'' Mrs. Dole said.
   Bush, who has five children and 10 grandchildren, believes ``the
parents should choose,'' Mrs. Dole said. She said he will ``give
American parents what they want _ child care supervised by people
who share their values: in a community-based setting, a relative's
or neighbor's home, a church-sponsored center, or by the mother or
father who works full-time at home.''
   Mrs. Dole ridiculed Dukakis for seeking ``to paint over his
liberal policies with pretty rhetoric.''
   ``Dukakis' convention speech was just like the Democrat
platform, hedging on defense, hedging on taxes, hedging on
spending. We're not running against (Lloyd) Bentsen and Dukakis.
We're running against Bentsen and Hedges,'' she said, in a play on
words with the name of a cigarette brand.

<HEAD>Longshot GOP Senate Candidates Profess Optimism</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The politics of optimism is alive at the
Republican National Convention.
   But in the case of some GOP candidates for Senate seats held by
veteran Democrats, the odds against them are so long that some
might call it wishful thinking.
   ``I am not a sacrificial goat,'' said Massachusetts businessman
Joe Malone on Monday as he detailed his plans to defeat Sen. Edward
M. Kennedy, D-Mass., and score the ``upset of the century.''
   Kennedy has represented Massachusetts in the Senate for the last
quarter century and is considered virtually unbeatable.
   But Malone, who is of Italian descent despite his Irish surname,
was undeterred.
   ``I'm in it to win,'' Malone said at a news conference in which
16 Republican Senate candidates were introduced. ``I'm hearing
people saying that 25 years of Ted Kennedy are enough.''
   Jay Wolfe, a West Virginia businessman was equally optimistic.
   His opponent is Sen. Robert C. Byrd, D-W.Va., the Senate
Majority leader.
   Byrd hasn't been defeated since his first victory in 1958, 30
years ago.
   ``If you think I'm in this to lose, just watch on Nov. 8,''
Wolfe said.
   Republican Alan Keyes, a black former ambassador, was positively
defiant as he roared his optimism that he will unseat Sen. Paul S.
Sarbanes, D-Md., an entrenched Democrat in a normally Democratic
state.
   ``Start looking for a surprise,'' Keyes said. ``If any of you
people in the media want to get a head start on looking good in
November, start writing that Keyes is going to win. We are going to
prove Republicans can split any bloc, take any vote.
   ``That surprise is going to shake our state's one-party system
to its very roots.''
   Rep. Beau Boulter, R-Texas., announced his intention to defeat
Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas., who under state law may run for
re-election while he seeks the vice presidency as the running mate
of Gov. Michael Dukakis.
   ``Lloyd Bentsen will fall off both horses he's trying to ride,''
Boulter said.
   Montana's Conrad Burns, a broadcast executive and a Yellowstone
County commissioner, said one reason he is trying to defeat Sen.
John Melcher, D-Mont., is that a Republican Senate candidate has

   ``One Republican every 100 years is only fair,'' he said.
   Hawaii generally votes Democratic, but Maria M. Hustace, a
teacher, social worker and rancher, said she intends to beat the
trend and replace Sen. Spark Matsunaga, D-Hawaii, a senator since
1976.
   She called Matsunaga the ``laziest member of the Senate,'' said
he is noted primarily ``for taking constituents to lunch'' and said
there is a rumor in the state that he is ill and will retire two
years after winning re-election.
   She immediately added: ``This is not to be a negative campaign.
It will be a positive campaign.''

   He assured reporters that ``we're not making age an issue.''
   Strinden immediately added: ``But every time a story is written,
it is immediately mentioned that my opponent is 80 years old.''
   At the news conference, Sen. Rudy Boschwitz, R-Minn., chairman
of the Republican Senatorial Campaign Committee, said that although
races are too close to call in 12 to 15 of the 32 seats states at
stake in November, the GOP has an excellent chance of recapturing
the Senate, now held by the Democrats, 54-46.
   ``We think it is in the realm of reason,'' Boschwitz said.

   ``Young Guns,'' featuring the offspring of
famous movie veterans, topped the weekend box office revenues while
the ``The Last Temptation of Christ'' hauled in nearly $45,000 per
screen in its limited release.
   ``Young Guns,'' a western featuring Martin Sheen's sons Charlie
Sheen and Emilio Estevez, and Donald Sutherland's son Kiefer, made
its debut in the No. 1 spot with a $7 million take, ending the
two-week box office reign of ``Cocktail.''
   ``Cocktail,'' a love story starring Tom Cruise, dropped to
second with $6.2 million, followed by ``Die Hard'' in third, ``A
Fish Called Wanda'' in fourth and ``Who Framed Roger Rabbit'' in
fifth.
   ``Tucker: The Man and His Dream,'' which opened Friday on 720
screens _ about half the 1,387 screens showing ``Young Guns,'' was
sixth with a $3.7 million take.
   The controversy involving ``The Last Temptation of Christ,'' a
fictional account on the life of Jesus that some fundamentalist
Christians called blasphemous, was a box office bonanza for
Universal even though it was not among the top 10.
   The movie played to sold-out crowds in seven U.S. cities and two
in Canada, taking in $44,579 per screen for a three-day total of
$401,211.
   The Eddie Murphy comedy ``Coming to America'' was seventh, the
Robert DeNiro-Charles Grodin buddy movie ``Midnight Run'' was
eighth and Tom Hanks' ``Big,'' in its 11th week of release, was
ninth. ``Clean and Sober'' completed the top 10.

Relations, with distributor, weekend gross, number of theater

   Roy Buchanan, whose work stretched the
limits of the electric guitar and had an influence on musicians
from blues to country-western, died Sunday night when he hanged
himself in a jail cell, officials said Monday. He was 48.
   Buchanan, of Reston, Va., died after he was arrested on a charge
of public drunkenness and placed alone in a receiving cell at the
Fairfax County Adult Detention Center, said Fairfax County Chief
Deputy Sheriff Carl Peed.
   He was placed in the cell at about 10:55 p.m. Sunday and checked
10 minutes later. But when deputies made a second check at 11:16
p.m., Buchanan was found hanged with his shirt from a window grate,
Peed said.
   ``Roy was known for making the guitar squeal and snarl, playing
harmonics, a lot of innovative techniques,'' said Ken Morton,
spokesman for Buchanan's recording label, the Chicago-based
Alligator Records. ``People like Robbie Robertson and Jeff Beck owe
him a debt of gratitude.''
   Buchanan began playing in the early 1950s. An early influence
was note-bending guitarist Jimmy Nolan, who would go on to play
with soul singer James Brown.
   Buchanan had his own band in Los Angeles at 15. He went to
Oklahoma, where he met rockabilly legend Dale Hawkins, who wrote
and performed the hit single, ``Suzy Q.''
   Buchanan toured and recorded with Hawkins the next two years,
and in 1960 joined a Canadian group that included Robbie Robertson,
Rick Danko, Garth Hudson and was the forerunner for ``The Band.''
   He spent the next few years in a studio, backing singers as
diverse as pop star Freddie Cannon and country-western singer Merle
Kilgore.
   He left that work, formed another group and started playing the
Washington, D.C., area, where he became an underground favorite.
   Rolling Stone magazine discovered him in 1971, and its review of
one of his performances said, ``Roy Buchanan provides what may well
be the best rock-guitar picking in the world.''
   A public television documentary titled ``The Best Unknown
Guitarist in the World,'' debuted soon afterward and Buchanan was
signed to a contract with Polydor.
   He produced five albums, one of which, ``Roy Buchanan's Second
Album,'' went gold. He moved to Atlantic Records and put out three
albums, including his second gold.
   Between 1978 and 1985, Buchanan was largely a musical recluse.
He released only one album during that stretch, but moved back into
the recording studio on a regular basis in 1985.
   His work for Alligator included ``When a Guitar Plays The
Blues,'' ``Dancing on Edge (with Delbert McClinton)'' and ``Hot
Wires.''

   Guitarist Roy Buchanan, touted as ``the best
unknown guitarist in the world'' before he won recording contracts
and produced two gold records, has died at age 48 after hanging
himself in a jail cell, officials say.

   Pat Robertson readied himself for a
prime-time convention speech by talking party unity while also
tending to his own future in the party.
   ``I told them I want George Bush to win,'' Robertson said after
a closed-door meeting with supporters.
   ``I'm a young guy, I can wait eight years,'' he added as he
scheduled meetings with important early states in the primary
process.
   Robertson's presidential campaign faltered early on, and he has
since endorsed Bush. During the meeting Monday night, Robertson
said that he urged backers to be ``good Republicans'' and that he
will formally release his delegates later in the week.
   Most delegates who have remained loyal to Robertson have
indicated they will vote for Bush if Robertson asks. An Associated
Press count gives Robertson 88 delegates. Bush has far more than
the 1,139 delegates needed for nomination.
   But Robertson was moving aggressively to carve out a role in
this week's convention. In addition to the usual circuit of
television interviews and receptions, he scheduled meetings with
delegations from Michigan, Iowa, Texas, Washington, Virginia and
Minnesota.
   Robertson launched his week with a downtown rally where he said
he ``won't ever surrender'' the conservative views which formed the
basis for his campaign.
   ``You and I got into the Republican Party because we believe in
principles,'' Robertson told backers.
   Spokeswoman Marlene Elwell said Robertson will focus on the
immediate goal of pushing for Bush's election during the convention.
   ``The message is for them to join him,'' she said. ``We're here
working for unity. He (Robertson) has pledged his full support.''
   ``Let's go fight Democrats,'' Robertson told backers.
   ``We're getting ready to show why Republicans should be elected
next fall and why George Bush should be elected the next president
of the United States,'' he said.
   Despite his weak showing in the primary season, Robertson told
backers there was ``marvelous cooperation'' on drafting the
conservative platform.
   He sent a clear message that he expects Bush to run on that
document.
   ``Though I withdrew as a candidate,'' Robertson said, ``the
ideas, the concepts, the principles, the standards that you and I
have held aloft do not ever quit and they don't ever surrender and
we are going to continue to fight until we see victory in the
nation for the things we believe in.''
   While Robertson was speaking, a small group of protesters
shouted ``bigot go home'' and ``go back to South Africa.'' There
were a few tense exchanges with Robertson backers, but they were
quickly diffused.

<HEAD>Bush Aides Failed to Block Haig Attack on Dukakis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE GLOVER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW ORLEANS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   George Bush's convention generals said they
tried but failed to dissuade former rival Alexander M. Haig Jr.
from delivering a sharp, personal attack on Michael Dukakis in the
convention's opening hours.
   Haig referred to the Democratic presidential nominee on Monday
as a ``diminutive clerk from Massachusetts.''
   ``We don't think that was an appropriate sequence of words,''
said Bush convention manager Fred Malek. ``That was Al Haig's
choice, it wasn't ours.''
   For each of the four nights of this week's convention, Malek and
other organizers have carefully scripted a single theme they want
to present to the television audience. They have tried to
discourage variations.
   In addition, Malek has said he does not want to see personal
assaults on Dukakis.
   In his speech, referring to both Dukakis and his running mate,
Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, Haig said: ``You have to admit Atlanta was good
theater. It was an off-Broadway revival of `The Odd Couple,'
starring the diminutive clerk from Massachusetts and the tall
stranger from Texas.''
   He also compared the Democratic Party to a bat ``flying
erratically for brief periods at low levels and hanging upside down
for extended periods in dark, damp caves up to its navel in guano.''
   In contrast, Haig said, Bush represented ``safe and progressive
change, safe in that George Bush will build on the solid
accomplishments of the Reagan presidency.''
   Bush workers were clearly unhappy with the tenor of Haig's
remarks.
   Malek said convention organizers first saw Haig's speech nearly
a week ago and tried to persuade him to tone down the rhetoric.
   ``We definitely told him we did not think that was a good thing
to do,'' Malek said. ``At one point, I thought he agreed with us,
but then he slept on it and decided it was what he wanted to do.''
   Malek's criticism was echoed in somewhat milder terms by House
Minority Leader Robert Michel of Illinois.
   Michel argued that there's a time and a place for harsh assaults
but Monday's convention speech was neither.
   ``I don't look upon that as the kind of campaign we would
wage,'' Michel said.

<HEAD>GOP Delegates Reject Right-Wing Rebellion Over Veep</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GARY LANGER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW ORLEANS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Republican delegates are pressing their
preferences for George Bush's vice presidential pick, but many have
rejected the idea of a conservative rebellion if his choice fails
to pass right-wing muster.
   With humor and at times with heat, dozens of delegates
interviewed Sunday and Monday stressed that the ultimate choice is
Bush's alone. Those who say otherwise, said Sen. Alfonse D'Amato of
New York, are ``kooks.''
   If some conservatives want to withhold their support from a
moderate GOP ticket, ``Let 'em do it,'' D'Amato said. ``It's only a
small handful of wackos. I don't believe this is an ideological
kind of thing.''
   The issue of an ideological test for Bush's running mate was
broached by Sen. Gordon Humphrey of New Hampshire, who suggested
that the ticket could lose core support if Bush selected an
insufficiently conservative partner.
   Some delegates agreed. ``It had better be a conservative,'' said
Margaret Stephens, of Elmore City, Okla.
   ``I want a conservative vice president,'' insisted Marc Nuttle,
from Oklahoma City.
   But Nuttle said he would be happy with Sen. Bob Dole of Kansas,
whose conservative credentials Humphrey had questioned. Dole,
moreover, was backed Monday by Pat Robertson, one of the most
conservative GOP primary candidates.
   ``The label you apply to a running mate is irrelevant,'' said
Gov. James R. Thompson of Illinois, who withdrew his name from
consideration last week. Another of those considered by Bush, South
Carolina Gov. Carroll Campbell, stressed unity: ``Our duty is to
stand up with the team.''
   Delegates said one reason they left the choice to Bush was their
faith he would choose well. ``Do you think George Bush is out there
looking for an abortionist liberal who wants to raise taxes?''
asked former state Sen. John DeCamp of Nebraska.
   ``You don't want a foolish pick,'' said Rep. Dan Lungren of
California, ``but Bush isn't going to make a foolish pick.''
   Their confidence in Bush aside, delegates were unabashed about
promoting their favorites: Rep. Jack Kemp of New York or former
U.N. Ambassador Jeane Kirkpatrick as conservative thinkers; Dole as
a help in farm states; Dole's wife, ex-Transportation Secretary
Elizabeth Dole, as a proven administrator.
   Some supporters of Kirkpatrick and Mrs. Dole said their
selection could boost Bush's support among women. ``We have a
gender gap, and we Republicans had better deal with it,'' said
Illinois state Sen. Adeline Geo-Karis.
   ``The ticket needs something to give it pep, something that
would help the weak spots,'' said state Sen. Judy Baar Topinka,
also of Illinois.
   Others, though, cautioned that choosing a woman could be seen as
tokenism and that compatibility should outweigh strategy. ``You
would be better served to pick somebody you really want to serve
with for eight years than to pick somebody that you think's going
to pick up one or two votes,'' said Sen. Phil Gramm of Texas.
   One reason for the long view, Gramm and others said, is that the
choice of the vice presidential nominee, while enticing fodder for
the convention rumor mill, is likely to have little effect on the
presidential race.
   ``My hope is that we don't get so wrapped up with vice president
that we lose sight of the issues,'' said Sen. Don Nickles of
Oklahoma. ``The real question is who's going to be the next
president of the United States.''

   New Englanders cut back on power to avert threatened blackouts,
New Yorkers slept in Central Park to cool off and grain futures
soared on the Chicago Board of Trade Monday amid speculation that
the Midwest would continue to bake in triple-digit heat.
   Temperatures and power usage reached record highs in the eastern
half of the nation as a heat wave continued its weeks-long
stranglehold from Iowa to the East Coast. Record high temperatures
were broken in 20 states and in Washington, D.C., where it reached
a sweltering 103 degrees, the National Weather Service reported.
   All 48 contiguous states had temperatures of 87 degrees or
higher. Hundred-degree temperatures were in 22 states, and in South
Dakota, Pierre reached 114 degrees and Chamberlain hit 112 degrees.
   Raising thermostats, lowering lighting and other voluntary
conservation measures by homes and businesses meant New England
utilities did not have to impose rotating blackouts, which they had
predicted might be necessary to save power.
   William Sheperdson, spokesman for the New England Power Pool,
which coordinates New England's electricity usage, said power
demand appeared to be somewhat below the record set last Thursday.
   Lexington-based Raytheon Corp., one of New England's larger
energy consumers, cut back 8.5 percent by turning down the air
conditioning and shutting off non-essential equipment. But the high
technology and weapons manufacturer did so grudgingly.
   ``We're not capable of trimming back our power demand without
cutting back on production,'' said George Sarney, a senior vice
president, who said his office was ``80 degrees, if not 90.''
   The University of Massachusetts at Amherst closed down for the
day because of power drain.
   In New York City, which hit a record high of 97 Monday, a
Consolidated Edison spokeswoman said utility customers used more
than 10,000 megawatts of electricity for the first time in history.
   Con Ed said more than 13,000 customers lost power Monday night
on Staten Island, and more than half still were in the dark about
11:30 p.m.
   Spokeswoman Martha Liipfert said weak links in the utility's
heavily burdened delivery system caused power to fail earlier in
the day in parts of Manhattan's Upper East Side and the southwest
Bronx.
   Before power there was restored about 7:30 p.m., police brought
generators and fans to cool the lobbies of powerless high-rises,
and air-conditioned buses were parked outside to provide a refuge
for residents.
   A power outage in Grand Central Terminal was quickly restored as
the evening rush hour began, but not before a handful of trains
were delayed or canceled. Spokeswoman Patricia Raley said workers
had not determined if the power failure was heat-related.
   Some people have been escaping hot apartments by staying all
night in Central Park, said Harold Tier, supervisor for the north
end of the park.
   However, Jim Poirier, a National Weather Service meteorologist,
offered a glimmer of hope. He said a weak cold front was expected
to move through the area by Tuesday, bringing highs in the low 90s
instead of pushing 100 as in the past few days.
   In parts of Iowa the mercury surpassed the century mark. Des
Moines reached 102 degrees, breaking the record of 101 set in 1886.
   Other record highs Monday included 97 at Allentown, Pa.; 99 at
Atlantic City, N.J.; 101 in downtown Baltimore and 98 at the
airport; 99 at Charleston, W.Va.; 97 at Hartford, Conn.; 96 at
Indianapolis; 97 at Louisville, Ky.; 102 at Peoria, Ill.; 98 at
Philadelphia; 97 at Rockford, Ill.; 99 at Washington's National
Airport; and 97 at Wilmington, Del.
   High school football coaches around Iowa took care to monitor
their athletes for heat-related stress as they ran through
conditioning drills.
   ``You watch them to make sure they're sweating,'' said Davenport
North Coach Cy Robinson, who said his two-hour afternoon practices
would be cut back 30 minutes.
   Grain and soybean futures posted their strongest gains in a week
Monday in response to predictions that crops in the drought-weary
Corn Belt would bake for most of this week.
   Monday's midday weather forecasts, coming on the heels of a hot,
mostly dry weekend in the Midwest, stoked fears of further damage
to the crops and helped push most corn, oat and soybean contracts
up their permitted daily limits on the Chicago Board of Trade.
   Seven weekend heat-related deaths in Chicago have brought the
Cook County total to 28 since the record-breaking heat wave began,
county officials said.

   President Reagan, in an emotional valedictory
speech to the Republican National Convention, told cheering
delegates Monday that contrary to Democratic claims, George Bush
``was there.'' To his vice president, he said, ``Win one for the
Gipper.''
   Acknowledging the tumultuous reception, Reagan declared,
``Nothing could be hotter than the spirit of the delegates in this
hall, except maybe a victory celebration on Nov. 8,'' the president
said.
   ``In this spirit,'' Reagan told the delegates, ``I think we
could be forgiven if we give ourselves a little pat on the back for
having made Republican a proud word again and America a proud
nation again.''
   Bush, praised by Reagan as a man ``who has seen this office from
the inside,'' watched the president's speech on television at the
vice presidential residence in Washington. He will arrive in the
convention city Tuesday, one day before his coronation as the
Republican presidential nominee.
   After Reagan spoke, Bush said in a statement, ``It was a great
and generous speech by a great and generous president. Barbara and
I were very touched and very moved. Now I will go to New Orleans,
spell out my message for America and do my level best to fill the
big shoes of Ronald Reagan.''
   The president spoke forcefully, generally in serious tones.
There was an occasional scratchiness in his voice. But there were
lighter moments, too, such as when he invoked his old movie career
to urge Bush to victory.
   Reagan's final words, ``God bless America,'' touched off a
tumultuous demonstration on the floor, which erupted in even
greater cheering as he was joined on the podium by the first lady.
   In the climax of the evening, red, white and blue balloons were
released from the Superdome ceiling, and the Reagans playfully
swatted them around the podium and into the swell of delegates.
   Blue, white and red ``Bush '88'' signs were hoisted into the
air, and one delegate sported a ``Reagan for VP '88'' placard. Bush
still has not made known his choice for a running mate.
   Seeking to counter the ``Where was George?'' cry that became a
theme of the Democratic National Convention, Reagan told the
convention, ``George played a major role in everything that we've
accomplished.''
   When he belted out the line, ``And George was there,'' the crowd
roared back, ``Four more years, four more years.''
   He then ticked off a list of administration successes, from the
economic recovery to the U.S.-Soviet treaty to eliminate medium-and
short-range nuclear weapons. ``Without George Bush to build on
those policies, everything we have achieved will be at risk,''
Reagan said.
   ``We need someone who's big enough and experienced enough to
handle tough and demanding negotiations with ... (Soviet leader
Mikhail) Gorbachev _ because this is no time to gamble with
on-the-job training.''
   It was clear who Reagan was referring to, although he did not
mention by name the Democratic presidential nominee, Michael
Dukakis.
   There was a brief chant of ``Reagan, Reagan, Reagan'' from the
crowd after the president declared that ``in the 2,765 days of our
administration, not one inch of ground has fallen to the
Communists.''
   There was a chorus of booing when Reagan predicted that if the
Democrats win the election ``their answer will be the one they have
relied on in the past _ and that is higher taxes.''
   In domestic policy, Reagan said, ``we set out to reduce federal
regulations that had been imposed on the people, on businesses, and
on local and state governments.''
   ``And George was there,'' he said of the Republican presidential
nominee-in-waiting. ``He headed up the task force that eliminated
those regulations.''
   ``So, George, I'm in your corner,'' he said.
   Then, invoking a movie line that has become one of his political
trademarks, the president said, ``But George, just one personal
request: go out there and win one for the Gipper.''
   He grinned broadly.
   The president insisted on the timing of his convention speech _
on opening night _ to avoid stealing the spotlight from Bush.
   Reagan and his vice president are scheduled to meet only once in
this convention city, at a ceremonial passing of the baton at the
New Orleans airport Tuesday when Bush arrives for his coronation
and the president and Nancy Reagan depart for a California vacation.
   Mrs. Reagan preceded her husband on the podium. Her brief
remarks were followed by a film highlighting the key moments of the
Reagan presidency.
   Reagan told the delegates: ``I'm grateful to God for blessing me
with a good life and a long one. But when I pack my bags in
Washington, don't expect me to be happy to hear all this talk about
the twilight of my life.''
   ``Together, we've fought for causes we love,'' he said. ``But we
can never let the fire go out or quit the fight, because the battle
is never over.''
   And he used a reference to his beloved Rancho del Cielo to
describe what lies ahead for the nation.
   ``There's still a lost of brush to clear out at the ranch,
fences that need repair and horses to ride.''
   The president said his administration was able to forge ahead on
both the international and domestic fronts ``in spite of the
resistance of those liberal elites who loudly proclaim that it's
time for a change.''
   ``They resisted our defense buildup; they resisted our tax cuts;
they resisted cutting the fat out of government; and they resisted
our appointments of judges committed to the law and the
Constitution.''
   ``Facts are stubborn things,'' the president said repeatedly,
declaring that it was his administration that led the country into
its longest peacetime economic expansion and reversed Democratic
policies that produced ``gas lines as well as unemployment lines.''
   Reagan opened his speech by telling the delegates that he and
the first lady wanted ``to share a little of your special time.''
   ``Having temporary custody of this office has been for me a
sacred trust and an honor beyond words or measure,'' he said.
   Earlier Monday, Reagan made a surprise appearance at a luncheon
given in honor of the first lady.
   ``I really can't imagine these last eight years without Nancy,''
Reagan said. ``Every president should be so lucky.''
   ``She once said that the president has all kinds of advisers and
experts to look after his interests when it comes to foreign
policy, the economy or whatever, but no one to look after his needs
as a human being,'' he said. ``Well, Nancy has done that.''
   Mrs. Reagan, clearly surprised at the president's appearance and
moist-eyed at the tribute, put her arms around him as he spoke and
as they joined the audience in singing, ``America, the Beautiful.''
   She told the luncheon that the years she and her husband spent
in the White House were ``eight of the most wonderful years we have
ever had.''
   But, she added, ``Today the curtain begins to close on the
Reagan era of the Republican party. We have had a wonderful run,
but today it is time for the Bushes to step into the political
leading roles and for the Reagans to step into the wings.''

   The man held a 3-foot cross in one hand and a
Bible in the other, but he managed to point a finger at a
middle-aged man and tell him in that his $6.50 movie fare made him
a candidate for damnation.
   ``You must be a child molester,'' the man with the cross called
out. The subject of the protester's fury blushed and his friends
huddled around him in the line to see ``The Last Temptation of
Christ'' on its opening night last weekend.
   ``How many children have you molested?'' the man with the cross
persisted, adding for emphasis, ``Pervert! Pervert!''
   Our group of six knew in advance that plans to attend a
screening of ``The Last Temptation of Christ'' would not be a
typical night at the movies.
   Tickets were purchased six hours earlier and our arrival one
hour before screening time put us far from the front of the long
line.
   But the hour passed quickly as hundreds of people protesting the
new film by director Martin Scorsese provided a street show as
colorful as that on the Venice Beach boardwalk.
   Some protesters passed out literature condemning the film's
depiction of Jesus as dreaming of evading his messianic role in
order to live as a husband and father. One pamphlet cover showed a
bleeding thorn-crowned Christ under the word ``Blasphemy!''
   Other demonstrators, however, took the opportunity to verbally
attack movie patrons, calling them devil worshipers, fornicators
and child molesters.
   One told a woman in line that if she went into the theater, she
must be a lesbian.
   The woman replied: ``Then I guess I'm a lesbian.''
   Many of those people in line applauded a young woman who wove
through protesters holding high a sign that read: ``I Support
Artistic Expression.''
   A protester approached one man who applauded, called him an
adulterer and said: ``You're the type of person who believes we
came from monkeys.''
   Earlier, a woman pushed a baby stroller through the plaza
complex and paused to tell her little girl: ``See all these people
in line? Well, they're all going to go to hell.''
   Those who patronized the movie on opening day were, in effect,
taking a stand, and for the most part swallowed the comments in
stride.
   Twenty minutes after the film was supposed to begin, the
sell-out crowd was let in to the theater, but not before guards
checked bags for weapons and other items that might be used in
vandalism.
   Guards stood by exits and sat at the front of the theater on
either side of the screen.
   Seconds after the lights went down, the Universal Pictures logo
appeared on the screen. Patrons in the 600-seat auditorium
applauded, and clapped again when Scorsese's name appeared.
   Few people left before the two-hour, 40 mimute film ended, and
most managed to escape the onslaught of demonstrators outside, who
were busy making do with the next batch of moviegoers waiting for
the midnight show.

   Sen. Bob Dole said Monday he doesn't care for
the process the George Bush organization has used to select and
announce a Republican vice presidential nominee.
   He said the choice should have been made and revealed soon after
Democrats finished their convention in mid-July, to avoid spotting
Michael Dukakis and Lloyd Bentsen a head start in the fall
presidential election campaign.
   Dole also told a news conference for Kansas reporters at a
French Market restaurant he suspects Bush ``already has made up his
mind'' on who his vice presidential running mate will be, but said
he has no idea who it is.
   He said he expects Bush to make his choice public on Wednesday.
   Asked if the selection process used by Bush was ``demeaning,''
Dole said, ``I don't care for it, frankly.''
   He said he had provided records and answered questions posed by
the Bush campaign but has not otherwise campaigned for the vice
presidential nomination.
   ``I did indicate to Jim Baker (Bush's campaign manager) that I'm
not certain I like the process,'' he said.
   Bush, who was in Washington, D.C., Monday, heard Dole
complaining about the process of selecting the vice presidential
nominee, but ``he didn't say anything,'' said Sheila Tate, his
press spokeswoman.
   Dole's spokesman, Walt Riker, said later that Dole was ``not
critical of the vice president or anyone else in that process ...
we're not saying that anyone made a mistake.''
   He said Dole was merely pointing out that Bush had the option,
because of the timing of the conventions, to name his nominee
several weeks earlier.
   Bush campaign strategists have held up announcing the veep
choice to try to heighten interest in the GOP convention here this
week.
   Dole said any suspense created by withholding the announcement
is of dubious value.
   ``There may be some suspense around here, but that's not going
to decide the election,'' Dole said. ``Bush's speech (Thursday
night) is the big event. That's when 70 percent of the viewers out
there will be watching.''
   Dole said he hasn't talked with Bush for about two weeks. Asked
who he thought Bush might select as his running mate, Dole said:
``I don't know. I haven't speculated. I think we have a lot of
support. My name recognition probably accounts for that.''
   If he's not picked by Bush for the ticket, Dole said, ``I'd
probably concentrate on the Senate races'' in hopes of boosting
Republicans into the majority, which Democrats hold by a 54-46 edge.
   Dole conceded he still feels remorse over his failure to defeat
Bush in their battle for the GOP presidential nomination during the
primary and caucus season last winter and spring.
   ``I'm normal,'' he said. ``I think about it even as I drive
around New Orleans. But it doesn't do any good to dwell on it. It
always comes out the same. There's no reason to relive it.''

<HEAD>Contras Retreating From Nicaraguan Battlefields</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRYNA BRENNAN</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   NEAR THE HONDURAN-NICARAGUAN BORDER (AP) _ Hundreds of Contra
rebels and civilian supporters are trudging into southern Honduras
base camps in a mass exodus, and their leaders say fewer than 2,000
fighters remain in Nicaragua.
   Rebel officials blame the U.S. Congress for the retreat, which
began four months ago and leaves the smallest Contra force in
Nicaragua since the U.S.-backed fighters began their war against
the leftist Sandinistas in 1981.
   More than 1,000 soldiers and civilians returned last week from a
central Nicaraguan combat zone. The largest single group to date,
about 2,500, was said to be approaching the Coco River frontier.
   Contra officials say the combatants, no longer supplied by air
drop inside Nicaragua, had to retreat to receive food and other
goods now available through the U.S. Agency for International
Development, known as AID, in Honduras.
   They say the new arrivals joined about 8,000 combatants and
5,000 civilians camped out in tents of plastic and U.S. army
ponchos in the rugged terrain.
   By picking up stakes and guiding their civilian supporters
along, the Contras have not only lost any fighting edge but their
social base, as well.
   ``No, they can't go back, except with a rifle in their hands,''
said a Contra official whose nom de guerre is Cmdr. Johnson.
   Another official, Cmdr. Oswaldo, said the civilians ``beg our
troops to take them along ... Without the troops, they are
harassed, forcibly recruited.''
   Rebel leaders said Congress is to blame for the retreat and the
possible end of the Contras as a fighting force.
   ``It's important to press the Congress, for them to understand
that four months ago there were no combatants here,'' said Cmdr.
Johnson. ``Now look,'' he said and pointed to scores of tents.
   The United States, which has supplied and trained the rebels
since the beginning, stopped a CIA-run military aid program at the
end of February. A month later, the Contras and Sandinistas signed
a preliminary cease-fire, but peace talks broke off in June.
   More than $17 million in non-lethal assistance handled by AID
started arriving in April on condition it be distributed in
Honduras and not Nicaragua.
   Contra leaders allowed several journalists to visit the camps
over the weekend. Their purpose clearly was to show the force
together and with high morale, but unable to fight until military
aid is restored and supplies air-dropped once again inside
Nicaragua.
   About 170 people who arrived Sunday trudged along a rutted road,
sweat soaking their torn clothes. Soldiers carried rusty
Soviet-made AK-47 automatic rifles and plastic bags of personal
possessions brought on a month-long march.
   They moved single-file across a field and into a camp, past two
armed guards. Some of the civilians sat in the shade of a banana
tree and ate raw oatmeal. One was 10 years old, another 15.
   Ten civilians died of hunger during the march, three drowned and
200 were in need of medical care, said Contras in the group.
   ``We don't have enough medicine to treat the people who are
coming in and they aren't getting the right food,'' said a Contra
doctor known as Ahuas Tara _ Tall Pines in an Indian dialect.
   Ahuas Tara, rebel officials and fighting men said the new
assistance program is not working. They said AID provides only rice
and black beans, not vegetables and meat, and medicine supplies are
mired in bureaucracy.
   ``Someone from AID will ask me what medicine I urgently need,
then he carries the list to the Contra office in Tegucigalpa,'' the
doctor said. ``Then they submit the list formally to AID and it
takes four to six weeks.''
   At a stifling, makeshift clinic, 31 soldiers and civilians lay
on cots in a room made for 20.
   Moral appeared high among the combatants on Sunday. Several
played chess on a homemade board, using toothpaste caps as markers.
Some played volleyball. There was an odd mix of woman making corn
tortillas, some toddlers, veteran combatants and the new recruits.
   Nearby, a baseball game officially started with rebel commander
Enrique Bermudez tossing the first pitch.
   Bermudez, who traveled by U.S.-leased helicopter to the camps
Sunday, recently was elected to the seven-member Contra political
directorate and was said to have resigned his post as the military
commander-in-chief.
   However, he clearly remains in control.
   Asked what would happen if new military aid is not approved by
the U.S. Congress, he said: ``We will explore some other
possibilities, another government or private aid.''

   A popular local television anchorman said
Monday his credentials were yanked when he showed up to cover the

   ``I think David Letterman would call this one `stupid anchor

   ``I fully understand that action and have no quarrel with it,''
he said in acknowledging a report that had aired just moments
earlier on a rival television station.
   Robinette, who usually co-anchors WWL's prime-time 6 p.m. and 10
p.m. newscasts, acknowledged he owned a gun, usually kept it in his
briefcase and simply forgot it was there when he arrived Sunday to
appear on a broadcast from the Louisiana Superdome.
   He did not describe the pistol or say whether it was loaded.
   News director Joe Duke said Robinette, a 16-year employee of the
station, would not be disciplined.

<HEAD>Toledo Police Chief Orders Halt To Random Stops Of Black Teens</HEAD>

<DATELINE>TOLEDO, Ohio (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Civil rights leaders claimed victory but
said they would press a $1 million lawsuit against the city even
though the police chief rescinded an order to randomly stop black
teen-agers in a mixed neighborhood.
   Police Chief Martin Felker withdrew the order Monday after
separate meetings with City Manager Philip Hawkey; LeRoy Williams,
president of the Toledo chapter of the National Association for the
Advancement of Colored People; and residents of the Old West End
neighborhood.
   ``The procedure was implemented to address a series of crimes
that had been committed,'' Felker said. ``Unfortunately, the focus
of the directive has been perceived as racially motivated instead
of the intent of focusing on the suspects involved.''
   The Interdenominational Ministerial Alliance and other opponents
of the policy said Monday that they considered Felker's latest
action a triumph.
   ``We put the pressure on the city because it was a patently
racist order, an insult to blacks,'' said the Rev. Floyd Rose,
pastor of the Family Baptist Church and a member of the alliance.
``It was another example of the city's insensitivity to the black
community. We fought back and will continue to fight.''
   Lafayette Tolliver, vice president of the Thurgood Marshall Law
Association, a group of black lawyers, said the association was
still pursuing the suit filed last week because of the police
policy.
   U.S. District Judge John Potter on Monday rejected the
association's request for a temporary restraining order after
talking to Felker and learning he had rescinded his directive.
   ``I think we won,'' Tolliver said. ``We are satisfied as far as
the temporary restraining order is concerned because now it is not
necessary.
   ``The suit will continue, and we expect more plaintiffs to join
us.''
   Blacks make up about 17 percent of the city's population of
340,000.
   The association sued Friday on behalf of Walter Wade Jr., a
black teen-ager who was followed and then stopped by police in
front of his house last week. Wade, 19, was questioned but not
charged with any offense, the lawsuit said.
   The lawsuit said the policy violated civil rights laws and the
Constitution's guarantee of freedom of association and protection
against unlawful search and seizure.
   Wade's lawyers are seeking $1 million in punitive and
compensatory damages.
   On July 8, Felker issued the order for police to stop and
question groups of black teen-agers in an attempt to end racial
violence in the Old West End.
   Later last month, the ministerial alliance, which includes
ministers from a variety of church congregations in Toledo, asked
the U.S. Justice Department to investigate what the ministers
called a conspiracy against black officials in Ohio's
fourth-largest city.
   Two Justice Department representatives met once with city
officials and once with ministers to try to mediate a solution. No
action resulted.
   The alliance also has been threatening to boycott businesses
that do not hire and promote blacks as a way of ending what it
calls economic injustice in the city.

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gov. Michael S. Dukakis' administration will have
to release sensitive internal documents under terms of a state
Supreme Court ruling that rejected his claim of executive privilege.
   In a unanimous opinion issued Monday, the high court found no
basis in the state constitution or laws for the executive branch to
withhold memos and other papers.
   ``I haven't read it yet, but certainly we will comply with the
decision in every respect,'' the Democratic presidential candidate
said Monday.
   He promised to release any requested documents ``in accordance
with the decision.''
   The ruling, prompted by a lawsuit filed by two homosexual men
challenging Dukakis' foster care policy, could have a far-reaching
impact on the operations of government.
   The high court rejected the principle that the executive branch
may keep certain papers secret, a practice that is accepted in
about one-quarter of the states and in the federal executive branch.
   Attorneys for the state had argued that the forced disclosure of
internal memos would have a ``chilling effect'' on government
policy-making by inhibiting full discussion of options and
consequences before policies are adopted and made public.
   The high court's ruling came in a lawsuit by Donald Babets and
David Jean, two homosexuals challenging the Dukakis
administration's decision to remove two young boys from foster care
in their Boston home. The men argued that they needed access to the
documents to prove their claim that their rights were violated.
   ``It's a victory for accountability and open government,'' said
attorney Anthony M. Doniger, who represents Babets and Jean. ``The
public now has a right to know how its government comes to its
decisions. That is a good thing in a democracy.''
   Ken Schwartz, chief of staff in the state's office of human
resources, said the ruling could distort the decision-making
process.
   ``The chilling effects of the disclosure of these types of
documents is real and has the potential to harm the quality of
decisions,'' Schwartz said. According to Doniger, the court said
the administration could still invoke the exemptions listed in the
public records law, which allows the government to withhold
documents relating to litigation, medical information about
individuals, policies still under discussion and pending real
estate deals, among others.
   Otherwise, the justices said they could find no legal
justification for withholding government documents, and they
declined to set a precedent by recognizing such a privilege.
   ``Had the framers of our government's structure intended to
recognize in our constitution an executive privilege, it is
reasonable to expect that they would expressly have created one,''
Chief Justice Edward Hennessey wrote.

   Vice President George Bush helped get
two American oil field workers released from prison in Kuwait,
according to an oil industry consultant involved in the case.
   The two Americans, S.L. ``Sam'' Gilley, 52, of Kilgore, Texas,
and Dean Gillette, 47, of Daniel, Wyo., were released from prison
last week after receiving a full pardon from the emir of Kuwait,
the Valley Morning Star reported Monday.
   Frank Simmons, managing director of Universal Oilfield Services
Ltd., of Daventry, England, told the newspaper the men were to
leave Kuwait for London Tuesday morning after being imprisoned
since March.
   The two men were sentenced to five years in prison on charges of
selling homemade whiskey, Simmons said. He said the American
Embassy in Kuwait had concluded they didn't receive a fair trial,
but had been unable to secure their release.
   Simmons, a native of Linden, Texas, and a friend of the Texan
held prisoner, said their release came only after he informed Bush
of their plight through Bush's longtime associate Jim McDonough of
Dallas.
   Simmons said Bush persuaded Kuwaiti Prime Minister Saad
al-Abdullah al-Sabah to ask the Kuwaiti leader to pardon the two
men.
   Simmons said Gillette has high blood pressure and a heart
disorder.

<HEAD>Test for Infants Reveals Risk of Low IQ by Age 3, Researcher Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MALCOLM RITTER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A test of how long infants look at patterns and
faces can help identify children at risk of showing mental
disability by age 3, a researcher says.
   Early identification of high-risk children allows concentration
of medical resources on the youngsters who need them, and a way to
quickly measure the impact of attempts to help a child's
development, said researcher Joseph Fagan.
   The test should not be used on infants in general, but only
those considered at risk, said Fagan, of Case Western Reserve
University in Cleveland.
   Such children include those who were treated in neonatal
intensive care, who suffered a breathing difficulty called
respiratory distress syndrome, or who were born well past their due
dates.
   Fagan described research on the test Monday at the annual
meeting of the American Psychological Association. Other
researchers said the test has not yet been rigorously compared to
other methods for predicting mental difficulties, and that it is
not perfectly accurate.
   The Fagan Test of Infant Intelligence relies on the fact that
most babies look longer at new images than at familiar ones. That
shows they can remember and discriminate between the images,
reflecting two key abilities important for later life that are
tapped by IQ tests, Fagan said.
   The test presents infants with pairs of images, either faces or
abstract designs. One is familiar, the other new. The time the
infant spends looking at each image is precisely measured.
   Infants who tend to look at each image in a given pair for about
the same amount of time are considered at risk for later mental
difficulties.
   Fagan cited research in which the test was given to infants 3
months to 7 months old who had been considered at risk. The
predictions of the test were compared to the children's IQ levels
at age 3.
   Of the 104 children predicted to be normal, 101 had normal
intelligence at age 3. Of the 24 infants predicted to be at risk
for mental difficulties, half had low IQ at age 3.
   Fagan said most children who take the test because of some risk
factor will receive a prediction of normality. So the test is
valuable in relieving needless anxieties of parents, he said.
   The test also will help research into whether exposure to
certain substances early in life causes later mental troubles,
because it shortens the time between exposure and detection of
those troubles, he said.
   Fagan said he receives a royalty on test kits sold by the
corporation that markets the test.
   Claire Kopp of the University of California, Los Angeles, said
Fagan's test has not yet been systematically compared for accuracy
to other predictive techniques that focus on a child's environment
and parents, or development in such areas as language and
perception.
   Robert McCall, director of the University of Pittsburgh's office
of child development, said he and Fagan agree the test should not
be used as the sole means of diagnosing a problem. Rather, it
should be part of a continuing process of observation by a
professional, he said.
   He also said that because mental disability is so rare even
among infants thought to be at risk because of their histories, a
flat prediction that they will all turn out fine will be correct 80
percent to 90 percent of the time.
   Fagan's test allows predicting normal outcome with 97 percent
accuracy, however, and ``I think that is useful,'' McCall said.
   But when the test predicts that an infant will turn out to be
mentally disabled, it will be wrong at least half the time, he
said. That causes needless heartbreak for the parents, he said, and
parents without adequate support may give up on the child and adopt
lowered expectations.
   No way to make certain predictions has been found, McCall said,
adding he suspects humans change and adapt so much that such
predictions may never be possible. Fagan's test can give valuable
insights into that developmental process, he said.

<HEAD>Bentsen Vies for Media Attention in Texas Campaign Trip</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDS: Tour of oil facility begins 11 a.m. EST; Tops prospects
uncertain</NOTE>

   With the national news media focusing on
the Republican convention in New Orleans, Democratic vice
presidential candidate Lloyd Bentsen is doing all he can to grab
the attention of the local press in his home state of Texas.
   Bentsen was visiting the Big Hill Strategic Petroleum Reserve
facility near here today to demonstrate the Democratic ticket's
support of the program, which fills underground vaults with crude
oil which can be retrieved in a national emergency.
   Bentsen contends in his campaign that the Reagan administration
has no coherent energy policy. While Reagan can point to overall
prosperity, oil areas such as this have suffered, and the
administration has given inconsistent support for the petroleum
reserve program.
   Bentsen on Monday was in Houston talking about another industry
in Texas that has suffered lately _ the space program.
   He visited the Johnson Space Flight Center and announced that
Dukakis would favor building a permanent manned space station.
   ``We will support an all-out effort to restore American
leadership in exploring the universe,'' he said in a speech to the
Greater Houston Chamber of Commerce.
   President Reagan is a long-time supporter of the space station,
but Bentsen said the administration has failed to bring the space
agency back to top form since the Challenger disaster.
   Bentsen also announced that if Dukakis were elected, the new
president would quickly reinstitute a Cabinet-level council on
space with the Texas senator at its head.
   Lyndon Johnson, another Texan, was put in charge of the space
council when he was vice president. The board was later abolished
by President Nixon, and Reagan has killed efforts in Congress to
put it back in operation.
   Texas has 29 electoral votes, and Bentsen is trying to make good
on his boast that the Democrats will carry the state this fall. The
nine-day campaign trip, almost entirely in Texas, was designed to
keep his name in the papers and on local television while Vice
President George Bush, another Texan, is receiving all that
attention in New Orleans.
   ``We're doing everything we can in these local markets to blow
the Republicans off the front page,'' said campaign spokesman Mike
McCurry,
   Bentsen made one of the only two non-Texas stops of his current
campaign trip on Monday, scooting over to Little Rock, Ark., for a
political rally with Democratic colleagues Sens. Dale Bumpers and
David Prior.
   Bentsen told the 400 supporters, who endured oven-like
conditions in an office building courtyard, that the Republicans in
New Orleans were ``out of touch with reality.''
   While they were boasting of a booming economy, he said, they
were ignoring places like Little Rock which have lost manufacturing
jobs. ``And they're trying to tell you it's never been better,'' he
said.

   George Bush & Co. are counting on this week's
Superdome convention to provide a bounce that will vault the
Republicans to victory in the fall. That's not impossible _
although it never has worked that way before.
   The vice president's men are wagering heavily on the pageant of
New Orleans to help Bush overcome Democratic presidential nominee
Michael Dukakis, who leads Bush in the early public opinion polls.
   Bush controls the convention show, of course. The delegates are
his. The challenge he faces now is to show himself a leader in his
own right, after eight years as the understudy.
   Not since Harry S. Truman has the candidate who trailed in polls
prior to his nominating convention reversed the numbers and won the
election. And Truman won his upset, 40 years ago, by overcoming the
damage from a bitterly divided Democratic convention.
   President Reagan said his convention farewell Monday night with
a proud review of an administration record he said Bush shares.
   Now Bush moves on stage, to speak for himself. His strategists
say that New Orleans is the place and Thursday night the time when
George Bush will emerge as his own man and as a commanding presence
in the race against Dukakis.
   That's high-risk politics, since voters who tune in for the
transformation may tune out if they don't see one. The safe and
standard procedure is to play down the event and keep expectations
as low as possible.
   
   Dukakis did that in Atlanta, putting out word that his
convention address was so dull his wife dozed off while reading it.
His speech was a strong one, his delivery smooth and at times even
dramatic. His cheerleaders promptly claimed a masterpiece.
   Hardly. Not a line was memorable enough to have survived this
long. But it was a solid performance, impressed a lot of people,
and thus a success.
   Republican tacticians are setting a more difficult target for
Bush. ``George Bush has not yet been center stage to the American
people,'' said Lee Atwater, his campaign manager. ``This will be
the first time.''
   In his convention valedictory, Reagan said his successor must be
a man of strength and experience _ Bush.
   ``It will take someone who has seen this office from the inside,
who senses the danger points, will be cool under fire and knows the
range of answers when the tough questions come,'' Reagan said.
``That's the George Bush I've seen up close _ when the staff and
Cabinet members have closed the door and when the two of us are
alone.
   ``Someone who's not afraid to speak his mind and who can cut to
the core of an issue. Someone who never runs away from a fight,
never backs away from his beliefs and never makes excuses.''
   That's exactly the image Bush wants to display, to quash the
``Where was George?'' taunt of Democrats and the misgivings even of
some Republican detractors who still raise the so-called ``wimp
factor.''
   But Reagan provided not a single example of Bush's closed-door
performance, and voters may want more than Reagan's word for it.
   The Republicans say that Dukakis' edge in the public opinion
polls will erode and finally disappear as Bush emerges from his
supporting role, and as people begin to focus on the issues that
divide the candidates. That is supposed to unfold over the four
days of New Orleans.
   That assumes a convention imprint more lasting than most. In
1960, John F. Kennedy's convention performance become a trademark
of his ``new frontier'' campaign. That hasn't happened since.
   So Bush has set himself a difficult task.
   ``I'm not going to try to be a Ronald Reagan,'' the vice
president said. ``There is only one. I want to be George Bush.''
   It is ironic that the man with the run-on resume still is trying
to introduce himself. Bush has, after all, run for president twice
and for vice president twice. Listing Bush's other jobs _
congressman, Republican chairman, United Nations ambassador,
representative to China, CIA director _ President Reagan said ``I
think the fellow with that resume has it all.''
   But the fellow's own people say that his image remains
indistinct.
   ``The American people really don't know who George Bush is,''
said Rep. John Paul Hammerschmidt of Arkansas, a longtime friend.
   That normally wouldn't be regarded as a very friendly thing to
say about a veteran politician. In this case, it's part of a risky
political game plan.

<TEXT>
   A record 15 million tourists visited China in the
first half of the year, providing the nation with $1 billion in
much-needed foreign currency, the National Tourism Administration
said.
   An administration official said more than 14 million visitors
came from Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan, up 20.1 percent, while other
foreign travelers totalled 851,606, an increase of 10 percent, the
China Daily said today.
   Tourism earnings were up 26.6 percent, according to State
Statistical Bureau figures.
   The official said 168,000 residents of Taiwan visited the
mainland, taking advantage of the Taipei government's decision last
fall to relax restrictions on mainland travel. Previously, Taiwan
prohibited trips to the mainland, although many Taiwanese secretly
skirted the ban by entering China by way of Hong Kong or other
third countries.
   Administration official Meng Yan told The Associated Press that
Japan led other foreign countries with 286,431 tourists, followed
by the United States with 133,414.
   In all of 1987, 577,702 tourists came from Japan and 315,332
from the United States, he said.
   The administration blamed a series of train and airplane
disasters in China and an outbreak of epidemics _ Shanghai was hit
by a hepatitis epidemic earlier this year _ for the decline in
Americans.
   China began promoting tourism as a means to garner foreign
exchange when it adopted its economic reform and open door policy
10 years ago.
   In all of 1978 there were just 1.8 million overseas visitors,
including 220,000 outside of Hong Kong and Macao.

<HEAD>Pregnant Woman Killed In Shooting, But Doctors Deliver Baby</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A baby girl was delivered alive after her
8{-month pregnant mother was shot and killed in front of the police
station by her boyfriend, who police said later shot himself to
death.
   ``It's just a miracle that the baby is alive. It's just
amazing,'' a nursing supervisor said Monday night at Fairmont
General Hospital, where the baby was delivered by Caesarean section.
   The baby was in critical condition early today.
   The 33-year-old mother, Sandra Johnson, was shot five times
Monday afternoon by Zachary Lewis as she sat in her car, police
said. The Fairmont woman was shot in front of her teen-age
daughter, sister and niece, who were in the back seat, police said.
   Lewis, 34, of Barrackville, was believed to be the father of the
baby, said Police Lt. Ted Offutt.
   Police said they had few details about the problems between
Johnson and Lewis.
   Johnson stopped in front of the police station as Lewis was
following her car, said Police Chief Edward DeVito. Lewis parked
across the street and walked toward Johnson's car.
   He pulled out a gun and shot Johnson five times through the
window, killing her. Her sister was treated for gunshots wounds and
released, officials said. The others in the car were not hurt,
police said.
   ``He just came right up, and within seconds he started
shooting,'' DeVito said. ``There was not enough time for anyone in
the station to react. By the time we got out of the station, he was
entering his car and leaving.''
   Officers chased him, and spotted him sneaking through a bush and
ordered him to drop his gun.
   Lewis instead asked the officers to shoot him. ``He said he
didn't want to live with it,'' Police Sgt. G.L. Hartley said.
   As the officers pleaded with him to stop, Lewis put the gun to
his head and pulled the trigger, police said.
   The Fairmont nursing supervisor, who did not give her name, said
Johnson was dead at the scene of the shooting, but doctors were
able to save her baby, who was flown by helicopter to Ruby Memorial
Hospital in Morgantown after being delivered at Fairmont.
   The baby was in critical condition, a Ruby Memorial nursing
supervisor said.
   It was not immediately known who would get custody of the girl.

<HEAD>Bentsen's `Other' Opponent Running Hard</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL HOLMES</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW ORLEANS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Congressman Beau Boulter is busy reminding
everyone that he is Democratic Sen. Lloyd Bentsen's other opponent
this year.
   That's not so easy, because Bentsen's other-other opponent
hasn't been named yet. If he's been picked, it's George Bush's
secret.
   Boulter, a two-term representative from Amarillo, Texas, opened
his challenge to Bentsen's re-election long before the Texas
senator was picked as a running mate by Democratic presidential
nominee Michael Dukakis. But that selection, Boulter says, was good
news for him.
   ``The point is, Lloyd Bentsen doesn't want to be our senator any
more. That's my issue now. As best as I can analyze it, he's
saying, `Elect me, so I can resign from the Senate','' Boulter said.
   Bentsen, chosen by Dukakis at last month's Democratic National
Convention, was allowed to remain on the Texas ballot in his bid
for a fourth Senate term under the so-called ``Lyndon Law'' which
was passed to allow then-Sen. Lyndon Johnson to run for both
re-election and the White House in 1960. If he had gotten off the
ticket, the seat automatically would have been forfeited to Boulter.
   But Boulter said Texans today believe that law is unfair.
   ``Nobody is entitled to ask to be elected to two offices on the
same ballot. Nobody,'' he said.
   Boulter's challenge of Bentsen has been uphill all the way, and
the Republican congressman acknowledges that. He had to fight
through a four-way primary and runoff election just to become the
Reublican opponent to Bentsen, whose campaign machine often is
credited with helping Democrats sweep all statewide offices in the
1982 election.
   Boulter's bid drew a cool reception from many establishment
Texas politicians, and he has yet to win a strong endorsement from
Republican Gov. Bill Clements.
   An early supporter of Jack Kemp's presidential bid in George
Bush's home state, Boulter wasn't selected as a Texas delegate to
the Republican National Convention and is in New Orleans only as an
alternate.
   ``I've always been a longshot. But I've never thought I was such
a longshot that I couldn't win,'' said Boulter, who in 1984 won a
stunning upset to oust veteran Democratic Rep. Jack Hightower in
the Panhandle-based congressional district.
   Bentsen's finances alone are intimidating. As of June 30, the
senator had reported raising about $7.5 million for his re-election
bid, compared with less than $600,000 for Boulter. The Republican
said he hopes to raise $4 million or so by November.
   In addition, some Republicans quietly had favored Bentsen,
generally viewed as a moderate-to-conservative whose chairmanship
of the Senate Finance Committee is welcome influence in Texas.
   But Boulter says much of that has changed since Bentsen joined
Dukakis on the Democratic ticket.
   ``It's made me better known. It has tended to lend credibility
to what I've been saying about Bentsen's compatability with the
Kennedy-Dukakis party. It has made some people who were supporting
him feel betrayed. Now they're seeing the `other' Lloyd Bentsen,
and they feel like he's turned his back on what they thought he
believed in,'' Boulter said.
   Boulter and other Texas Republicans, including state party
Chairman Fred Meyer of Dallas, say they think the Dukakis-Bentsen
alliance raises legitimate questions about Bentsen's positions on
taxes, gun control and other issues important to Texas voters.
   ``Lloyd Bentsen's got, from my perspective, a good record of
fighting gun control. But now, he is running to elect a president
who is an avid proponent of gun control. This is a particularly
important issue to a lot of people in Texas,'' Boulter said.
   ``The notion that Bentsen can change Dukakis into a gun owner is
ridiculous.''

<HEAD>DeSillers Faces Contempt Ruling After Failing To Turn Over
Property</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Maria DeSillers faces a possible contempt citation
for failing to turn over a BMW, jewelry and other luxury items she
allegedly purchased with money donated for her late son's liver
transplants, a trustee says.
   Karen Gievers, who oversees the donated funds, planned to file a
motion today in Dade Circuit Court asking that Ms. DeSillers be
fined or put behind bars for contempt.
   Monday's deadline required Ms. DeSillers to surrender the
property or post a $100,000 bond.
   Ms. DeSillers failed to return to court after appearing earlier
in the day in an unsuccessful attempt to reduce the bond. Two
deadlines for Ms. DeSillers to hand over the items last week had
been extended by Judge Francis Christie until Monday.
   ``The order clearly has been violated,'' Ms. Gievers said Monday.
   On Monday, Ms. DeSillers' attorney, Frank Johnson, told Christie
the articles in her apartment were valued at about $4,500, and that
bonding companies refused to issue a $100,000 bond for them.
   The disputed property, including a 1985 BMW, $10,850 in jewelry,
nearly $6,000 in clothing and $4,000 in furniture, were worth more
than $60,000. Ms. Gievers also is seeking about $130,000 in cash
that Ms. DeSillers allegedly paid to herself, relatives and
acquaintances.
   After the deadline expired, Johnson said: ``We are going to
weather this one out in Judge Christie's courtroom.''
   Ms. Gievers believes $242,000 remains of the nearly $690,000
donated for Ronnie DeSillers' three liver transplants.
   Ronnie died in April 1987 at Pittsburgh Children's Hospital at
age while awaiting his fourth transplant. Ms. DeSillers refuses to
pay the hospital about $262,000 in medical bills because she says
her son received improper care, a charge hospital administrators
deny.
   Contributions, including $1,000 from President Reagan, had
poured in after a small fund collected by Ronnie's school was
reported stolen.

<HEAD>Former Bush Rivals Get on Bandwagon for November</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RITA BEAMISH</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW ORLEANS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Three of the men who fought to be where
George Bush will stand on Thursday night praised their one-time
rival at the opening session of the Republican National Convention.
   Former Delaware Gov. Pete du Pont, former Secretary of State
Alexander Haig Jr., and Rep. Jack Kemp of New York will be followed
at the podium by the two other unsuccessful Republican presidential
candidates _ television evangelist Pat Robertson tonight and Sen.
Bob Dole of Kansas on Wednesday. Both will speak in coveted
prime-time slots, as did Kemp.
   Du Pont and Haig were afforded morning time at the opening of
the convention Monday.
   The band of former candidates, who in days past spent their time
attacking one another and especially Bush, have come together in
New Orleans for the cause of Republican unity.
   All are keeping busy schedules during convention week, bustling
about New Orleans from receptions to speeches and parties in their
honor, along with a hefty schedule of media interviews.
   Kemp, who spoke before President Reagan on Monday night, told
the president: ``This is a powerful legacy that you are handing us
here in New Orleans. I just want you and Nancy to know that, under
the able leadership of George Bush, this party is going to take it
and run with it. We're going to win in November.''
   Kemp, along with Dole, was doing some running of his own in New
Orleans.
   Both are said to be on Bush's short list of running-mate
possibilities.
   Kemp told a news conference he would be ``a terrific vice
president'' but Dole indicated he was wearying of Bush's long
selection process.
   Dole's wife, Elizabeth, however, appeared to be touting the
senator for the running-mate post, saying how proud she was ``that
literally a week after Bob withdrew from the presidential race he
was out working hard, and I mean hard, for George Bush. He doesn't
look back.''
   And all are doing their dutiful share of Democrat-bashing.
   Haig, in his speech to the delegates went a little overboard as
far as the Bush camp was concerned. He referred to Democratic
nominee Michael Dukakis as a ``diminutive clerk from
Massachusetts,'' a choice of words the Bush staff called
inappropriate.
   Haig also compared the Democratic Party to a bat ``flying
erratically for brief periods at low levels and hanging upside down
for extended periods in dark, damp caves up to its navel in guano.''
   Haig, who directed some of the most pointed barbs at Bush during
the primary said Bush represented ``safe and progressive change,
safe in that George Bush will build on the solid accomplishments of
the Reagan presidency.''
   Du Pont, who said he will be campaigning virtually full time for
the Bush ticket, said the Democrats are looking to the policies of
yesterday. Bush and the Republicans are ``willing to explore,
examine and put new ideas to work,'' he said.
   In an interview, he admitted to feeling ``a little wistful,'' as
he looked forward to Bush's nomination on Wednesday night. He said
he enjoyed the campaign, ``But George was a little stronger this
year.''
   At a reception Monday, Dole thanked his primary supporters. But
he added, ``That's behind us and now we're on to the big event
where George Bush will become the 41st president of the United
States.''
   Robertson, who raised $25 million but failed to attract
significant voter support, has set up a large campaign office near
the French Quarter. But so far there seems to have been little
activity in the office, although he is scheduled to attend a series
of rallies and events this week.
   Robertson announced last week he would not enter his name into
nomination, removing the last wrinkle in Bush's otherwise smooth
convention waters.

   Consumer advocate Ralph Nader is warning
Americans that they face a growing threat from contaminated food.
   Nader and other leaders of Americans for Safe Food, a coalition
of 80 consumer groups, on Monday launched a nationwide petition
drive to call attention to problem.
   The group also urged presidential contenders Michael Dukakis and
George Bush to combat the ``crisis of confidence'' in the federal
food safety program.
   Nader said at a news conference that unwary consumers face
``silent, cumulative forms of violence'' from food contaminated by
pesticide residues, animal drugs and other unsafe substances.
   Former Sen. George McGovern and Michael Jacobson, executive
director of the consumer advocacy group the Center for Science in
the Public Interest said rising U.S. importation of fruits and
vegetables from countries that may not strictly regulate their food
producers are one source of the contaminated food.

<HEAD>Americans Gather To Plan `Peace Walk' In Soviet Union</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   About 200 Americans from 30 states are
gathering to prepare for a 2,000-mile ``peace walk'' in the Soviet
Union.
   The walkers converged on Washington Monday as they prepared to
fly to Moscow on Thursday.
   They will be joined by about 200 Soviet citizens in Odessa, on
the Black Sea coast, where their march will begin on Saturday said
Allan Affeldt, president of International Peace Walk, a
Washington-based peace group that has organized the project.
   The trek, designed to dramatize a call for ending the superpower
arms race, will include visits to Soviet homes, public meetings on
political and social topics and brief stops at Soviet farms to help
with the harvest, said Affeldt.
   He said the Soviet government has placed no restrictions on the
walkers' activities.
   ``We're being citizen diplomats, making our statement in as
dramatic a way as possible,'' Affeldt said in a telephone

<HEAD>Eritreans Protest Alleged Atrocities</HEAD>

   Exiles from northern Ethiopia's civil war are
protesting alleged atrocities committed by government troops
embroiled in conflicts with separatists in the northern provinces
of Eritrea and Tigre.
   Chanting ``Peace yes, war no,'' and ``Stop Genocide,'' several
hundred Eritrean exiles marched Monday en route from a rally
outside the Ethiopian Embassy to one near the Soviet Embassy in
downtown Washington.
   The Soviet Union has been a major supporter of Ethiopian
President Mengistu Haile Mariam.
   The Eritrean Peoples Liberation Front circulated leaflets
accusing Ethiopian soldiers of looting and burning more than 20
villages in the past five months, including a raid on a monastery
at Godeiti on July 26 where 11 people were massacred.
   The EPLF asks a plebescite on whether Eritrea should be
independent or a federated or autonomous region of Ethiopia.
Eritrea, a former Italian colony, was attached at the end of World
War II to Ethiopia, which Italy had occupied at the start of the
war.

<HEAD>Start of Needle-Exchange Program Delayed Again</HEAD>

   Distribution of free hypodermic needles to
drug abusers, aimed at reducing the spread of AIDS, will begin no
sooner than October because a clinic has not been able to obtain
liability insurance.
   Kathy Oliver, executive director of the Outside In clinic, said
Monday that negotiations with the clinic's insurance company, St.
Paul Fire and Marine of St. Paul, Minn., had failed.
   ``What became clear was that we needed to find another
(insurance) carrier,'' she said.
   The program, which officials had said would be the first of its
kind in the United States, already had been delayed twice because
the clinic was unable to negotiate a policy with St. Paul Fire and
Marine.
   It was originally scheduled to start in July. The distribution
program is intended to study whether providing needles can help
reduce the spread of acquired immune deficiency syndrome among
intravenous drug abusers. A similar program is scheduled to start
in New York in a few weeks.
   Oliver said several other insurance companies have been
contacted and the only thing that needed to be negotiated was the
price. She declined to name the other companies.
   Once insurance is obtained, the clinic will need two weeks to
get the program started, Oliver said. Oct. 1 is probably the
earliest the program will begin, she added.
   Last month a spokeswoman for St. Paul Fire and Marine, the
nation's largest medical liability insurer, said the program
involved ``areas of unknown liability.''
   ``We're especially concerned for the potential of the spread of
AIDS from needles supplied by the clinic and later re-used,''
spokeswoman Beth Murray said.
   The company has provided the clinic's comprehensive medical
malpractice and liability insurance for 10 years. The clinic has
never filed a claim.
   The needle program is being financed by a $67,000 grant from the
American Foundation for AIDS Research. Under the yearlong program,
125 drug addicts will exchange used needles for new ones and
receive counseling.

   A funeral procession for a former
president who was three times deposed by the army turned quickly
into a peaceful protest against Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega, the
country's de facto ruler.
   Without their usual fear of repression by the general's soldiers
and police, Noriega's opponents gathered in the plaza in front of
the Metropolitan Cathedral on Monday for a requiem Mass for Arnulfo
Arias Madrid.
   Arias Madrid, who would have been 87 on Monday, died of a heart
attack last Wednesday.
   As the service ended and Arias Madrid's coffin was placed atop a
bright orange firetruck for the trip to the Garden of Peace
cemetery, a great, seemingly spontaneous cry went up from the
throng in the plaza.
   ``Justice,'' they shouted.
   The crowd followed the cortege out of the plaza, through the
narrow, brick streets of the old section of Panama City and onto
the capital's main business artery. With each block, the procession
grew until it filled the four-lane street for nearly a mile.
   ``Noriega must go,'' the marchers shouted. ``Arnulfo president,
Noriega delinquent.''
   The Panamanian government is dominated by Noriega, who commands
the country's 15,000-member Defense Forces. He was indicted by two
federal grand juries in the United States in February on charges of
narcotics trafficking.
   Noriega's soldiers and police, who have crushed dozens of
protests in the past 14 months, did not interfere with the funeral.
   Many in the procession waved white banners or the flags of
political parties opposed to Noriega.
   Thousands of people lined the streets, often impeding progress.
It took the procession nearly six hours to wend its way the three
miles to the cemetery. It arrived at sundown, more than two hours
behind schedule.
   Prominent in the procession were members of the National Civic
Crusade, which led dozens of demonstrations against Noriega in 1987
and early this year but hasn't been on the streets since the
government smashed a protest march last spring and arrested most of
its leaders.
   ``They couldn't very well halt a funeral procession for Arias
and, with the cap off, the people have again come out to show how
they feel about the government,'' said Roberto Aleman, one of the
few original Crusade leaders who has not been forced into exile.
   The Authentic Panamanian Party, which Arias Madrid founded in
1935, refused a government offer to provide military honors at the
funeral. Instead, it decided on the requiem Mass conducted on the
cathedral steps by Archbishop Marcos McGrath, the country's Roman
Catholic leader.
   ``We can't accept that those who always overthrew the doctor
(Arias) share in our grief,'' said Francisco Artola, party vice
president. ``The ceremony is going to be for the people.''
   U.S. Ambassador Arthur Davis and his daughter, Susan, were among
the mourners.
   In death, Arias Madrid won praise even from
government-controlled newspapers.
   They referred in vague terms to his ``errors'' during 57 years
in politics, but praised his nationalism and defiance of the United
States. Elected to three four-year terms, the military allowed him
to serve a total of only 2{ years.
   In January 1941, during the first term, he turned down a U.S.
War Department request for land for military bases along the Panama
Canal.
   At the United States' urging, the military ousted him in a coup
later that year, 9{ months after he took office. Soon after,
Washington had its 37,000 acres for the bases.
   Arias Madrid was elected again in 1949 but tossed out by the
army in 1951.
   His third term began on Oct. 1, 1968, but lasted only 11 days,
until his overthrow in a coup led by Gen. Omar Torrijos, whom
Noriega replaced as head of the Defense Forces.
   Just four years ago, Arias Madrid entered the presidential race
again. The government said Nicolas Ardito Barletta, Noriega's
candidate, won by 1,713 votes, but the election was widely seen as
fraudulent.
   Arias Madrid spent long periods in self-imposed exile. He had
gone to Florida for medical treatment in April and remained there
until his death.

   Political differences were put aside Monday
as Democratic congresswoman Lindy Boggs welcomed Republicans into
her home on Bourbon Street, the favored path of partying
conventioneers.
   The blowout at Mrs. Boggs' 193-year-old house honored Republican
senators and representatives. A party Tuesday night will honor Sen.
Bob Dole of Kansas and his wife, Elizabeth.
   Other celebrations Monday included evening cruises on the
Mississippi River and the start of a three-night engagement by jazz
trumpeter Al Hirt. In between were free brunches, buffets and open
bars at all hours for delegates and hangers-on.
   Mrs. Boggs said her party was to repay a 12-year-old debt of
gratitude. In 1976, she helped plan the Democratic National
Convention in New York. Her hosts included Republicans, and their
city was in deep financial trouble.
   ``Once we were established in New York, everyone, regardless of
partisan politics, worked very hard to make it very successful. The
same thing, I think, is true here,'' Mrs. Boggs said.
   ``It's a tiny bit of reciprocity on my part. New Orleans has
been in a very serious economic downturn. This is a real lift in
spirits and the economy as well. When your city needs help,
everyone pulls together.''
   ``Lindy told me, `No problem, I have house parties all the
time,''' said Rep. John Porter of Illinois as he worked his way
around a police barricade near the grey double doors of the old
house.
   ``The Democrats are paying their respects to the Republicans,''
said Porter's wife, Kathryn.
   ``This is like Washington _ a lot of intermingling between
Republicans and Democrats,'' said Herb Hecht, a conventioneer from
Virginia.
   ``I think the party is wonderful,'' said former California Lt.
Gov. Mike Curb.
   Registered Democrats outnumber registered Republicans 189,741 to
34,853 in New Orleans, where Mayor Sidney Barthelemy is a vice
chairman of the Democratic National Committee. About 15 percent of
Louisiana's registered voters are Republicans, but the GOP has won
five of the state's last eight presidential races.
   All of which prompts this reassurance from Mrs. Boggs: ``They're
not overrunning my house. They're most cordially invited.''
   Another elegant party was sponsored by the Eagle Forum, a
conservative organization headed by Phyllis Schlafly, which paid
$5,000 to rent the New Orleans Museum of Art for a late-afternoon
salute to GOP celebrities.
   Mrs. Schlafly, asked whether her family-oriented group found
anything wholesome to do in New Orleans, said, ``Well, the food is
wholesome.''
   Walter Klaus, a 76-year-old alternate from Farmington, Minn.,
who was at the museum, said he had no plans to visit ``wicked''
Bourbon Street. ``I hear all about it, and people say we should see
it. But I've got other things to do.''
   The celebrities were Rep. Jack Kemp of New York, former Judge
Robert Bork, former United Nations Ambassador Jeane Kirkpatrick,
Sen. Phil Gramm of Texas and former Secretary of Education William
Bennett.
   Each was given a clock by Mrs. Schlafly. The clocks have four
faces, which she said would keep the honorees on time across the
country as they campaign for the Republican ticket this fall.
   The Eagle Forum had scarcely vacated the museum when bars and
buffets were re-stocked for a late-evening costume bash for $1,000
contributors to the Republican Senatorial Campaign Committee.
   Fearful that delegates would tire of spicy Cajun and Creole
snacks, caterer Brian Huber served stir-fried chicken and peanuts,
pasta topped with spicy cured ham, crawfish-tail fritters and fried
pork rinds, the last recently revealed as a favorite snack of Vice
President George Bush.

   Nancy Reagan basked in the praise of
Republicans at their national convention, including the man who has
led the party for the past eight years and has been her own leading
man for 36 years.
   The first lady in turn thanked the conventioneers who paid her
tribute, saying they had given her the most fulfilling years she
has known.
   ``You've given us such a wonderful life, a life I never dreamed
possible,'' Mrs. Reagan told the convention.``It's the most
extraordinary feeling to represent a nation and its people. I can
never thank you enough.''
   Mrs. Reagan, introduced by actor Tom Selleck, appeared before
the convention Monday night in the same melon-colored dress she
wore the night her husband won the 1980 Republican nomination. ``I
do hang on,'' she laughed in noting her recycled outfit.
   In a video presentation of their White House years shown to the
convention, President Reagan said of his wife, ``I can't imagine
life without her.''
   ``I've been proud of her for a long time, but never more so than
in these last eight years,'' he then told the convention before
making his prepared speech to the delegates.
   For her part, Mrs. Reagan alluded to the accolades she has
received for her anti-drug work and gave credit to the party
members. ``You really gave me the chance to be more than I thought
I could be,'' she said.
   A poignant display from the president came earlier in the day
when he showed up as a surprise guest at a Republican party
luncheon tribute to the first lady.
   ``The presidency wouldn't have been the joy it's been for me
without her there beside me,'' Reagan told some 3,000 guests as his
wife of 36 years stood beside him.
   ``That second-floor living quarters in the White House would
have seemed a big and lonely spot without her waiting for me every
day.''
   Mrs. Reagan was visibly moved by her husband's simple but deeply
personal tribute. The couple embraced as the room erupted in
applause.
   The scene reinforced the public image of the Reagans as a close
and deeply committed couple. They met when both were actors in
Hollywood and married in 1952.
   ``What do you say about someone who gives your life meaning ...
someone who is always there to support and understand you, someone
who makes sacrifices so that your life will be easier and more
successful?'' Reagan said. ``What you say is that you love that
person and treasure her.''
   He also said Mrs. Reagan had looked after him ``through
recuperations and crises. Every president should be so lucky.''
   ``Nancy, in front of all your friends here today, let me say,
`Thank you for all you do, thank you for your love and thank you
for just being you,''' Reagan said.
   Also paying tribute to Mrs. Reagan at the luncheon emceed by
Reagan's daughter, Maureen Reagan, the Republican National
Committee co-chairman, were several party officials and singer
Barbara Cook and comedian Rich Little.
   In brief remarks, Mrs. Reagan praised Vice President George
Bush, who is to receive the party's presidential nomination
Wednesday night, and his wife, Barbara.
   ``Today the curtain begins to close on the Reagan era of the
Republican party. We've had a wonderful run. But the time has come
for the Bushes to step into the leading roles and for the Reagans
to step into the wings,'' she said.

   The three major television networks grumbled
after the Democratic convention and cut the staff brought here, but
they nevertheless are reserving prime time all week for the
Republicans _ and praying for news.
   The biggest sure-fire story was President Reagan's farewell
speech to the party he led for eight years. But that was Monday,
and the rest of the week loomed with two hours to fill each night.
Sometimes more.
   The networks are making a good-faith effort to appear gung-ho,
with much talk of democracy and responsibility and how things
aren't really so boring.
   There is, after all, The Unanswered Question of whom George Bush
will select as his running mate. NBC anchor Tom Brokaw labels the
suspense ersatz, but the question remains.
   And then there are the questions about Bush himself. How will he
acquit himself? Will he emerge from Reagan's shadow? Will the
convention give him the boost he needs?
   ``There's lots of news going on here,'' said Lane Venardos,
executive producer for CBS News special events. ``Just because
something isn't big news doesn't mean it isn't news.''
   CBS is leading the campaign for prime-time convention coverage,
boring or not, with NBC not far behind.
   ``Some things in television are more important than ratings,
even more important than money. Coverage of the political
conventions is one of them,'' CBS anchor Dan Rather said in a ``My
Turn'' article published this week in Newsweek.
   Rather derided a suggestion by ``one television executive,''
after the Atlanta convention with its disastrous ratings, that the
parties and maybe the networks should ``come up with something more
appealing to the American people.''
   No way, wrote Rather. ``Not everything about democracy is
exciting. Some things are simply important. That is reason enough
to cover them.''
   ABC anchorman Peter Jennings said the comment, by ABC News
President Roone Arledge, was taken out of context. ``Roone was
exhibiting a certain frustration which all of us feel that more
Americans do not participate in the process,'' he said.
   Arledge went further than any other network executive in openly
speculating that ABC might cut its coverage in New Orleans.
   The prospect so worried the GOP that ``we were very adamant''
with the network, said Mark Goode, hired by the Republican National
Committee to produce the convention. ``We felt it was unfair to
change the rules in the middle of the game. We told them it could
hurt them if they did it.''
   Jennings said he was unaware of any pressure on ABC and added:
``I can't imagine the party would act in such bad taste.'' He also
said there was ``never any doubt in my mind or in any
correspondent's mind that we were going to cover this exactly as we
covered the convention in Atlanta.''
   With their high-profile anchors and correspondents, their
trailer encampments the size of small towns, their glass skyboxes
visible in the convention hall, the networks remain a dominating
presence even in their lean new incarnation.
   ``You cannot put in all this effort, all these people, all this
money, and say you're going through the motions,'' said Lloyd
Siegel, senior producer of NBC's coverage.
   Siegel said much of what goes on at the conventions is ``not of
national interest.'' But he added, ``It's two weeks every four
years when people stop to consider how the country should be run.
Who will be the next president? There's no bigger story than that.''

<HEAD>Yonkers City Council Again Rejects Housing Desegragaton Plan</HEAD>
<DATELINE>YONKERS, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   City Council early today rejected a federal
court-ordered housing desegregation plan, despite the imposition of
potentially bankrupting fines issued after it voted the same way
two weeks ago.
   Opponents of the plan far outnumbered supporters at the meeting,
which began Monday night and ran past midnight to allow all 80
people who signed up to speak five minutes each.
   On Wednesday, the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals will hear
arguments on contempt against the city issued two weeks ago by U.S.
District Judge Leonard Sand.
   On Aug. 1, the Council voted 4-3 to reject the affordable
housing plan that would integrate the state's fourth-largest city.
The plan was in accordance with a federal court order, which calls
for 200 units of low-income housing and 800 units of
moderate-income housing.
   Sand subsequently held the city and the four council members who
voted against the plan in contempt. He also issued heavy fines
against the city. The fines had accumulated to $25,600 when the
federal appeals court ordered them temporarily halted last week.
   The court also ordered the council to meet once a week to cast
another vote on the housing plan. Monday's meeting was the first.
   Mayor Nicholas Wasicsko, who supports the desegregation plan,
expressed disappointment over today's 4-3 vote.
   ``I think the councilmen have had an opportunity to make their
political statements,'' he said. ``They have had their publicity,
their national exposure. This would have been an opportune time for
them to come out as far ahead as they can publicity-wise ... and
not do any real harm to the city.''
   Much of the crowd filed out as the mayor spoke. Some sang ``good
night, mayor'' to tune of ``Good Night, Ladies.''
   But Councilman Nicholas Longo, one of the four opponents, got a
standing ovation when he called the plan ``a plain disaster for the
city of Yonkers.''
   It's ``a planning disaster and no one should force it on the
taxpayers of this city,'' he said.
   Earlier Monday, City Manager Neil DeLuca proposed an alternative
to the plan that has divided this racially mixed city and
threatened to send it into bankruptcy.
   The proposal would provide 100 new units of low-income rental
housing and allow another 100 low-income families to buy their own
cooperative apartments.
   DeLuca unveiled his plan at a meeting of Yonkers civic leaders.
   He also proposed an alternative to the 800 units of moderate
income housing that Sand ordered built during the next four years.
Under DeLuca's plan, 750 units would be built over a 10-year period.
   Sheila Morris, president of the Black Women's Political Caucus
in Yonkers, attended Monday's meeting but took no position on
DeLuca's plan.

   Here is a transcript of the tribute to former
Arizona Sen. Barry Goldwater delivered by Sen. William Armstrong of
Colorado at the Republican National Convention.
   Thank you very, very much. Thank you Kay, thank you ladies and
gentlemen.
   Ladies and gentlemen, let me take you back for a minute to the
year 1952.
   Remember, at that time the Democrats had been in charge of
everything around here for over 30 years. And what the liberal wing
of the Democratic Party believed in had become the conventional
wisdom and dominated the councils of government. And you remember,
some of us remember that what they believed in, of course, was
government _ big government and more big government.
   In some parts of the country, in 1952, there were people who had
grown to adulthood without ever having known a Republican who had
been elected to a high public office. And unfortunately, in some
places the Republicans they did know were always apologizing for
their views.
   And then, from out of the West, a pioneer appeared and he didn't
apologize. He had a message. He talked about individualism and
self-reliance and personal responsibility. At first, his was a very
lonely voice. And they had a name for him; they called him a
conservative. What's more, he proudly admitted he was a
conservative, because he wanted to serve the principles upon which
this nation was founded. Because to this day, these are the
principles that have meant freedom, and equality, and liberty for
the people of this country.
   The year was 1952 and that pioneer was Barry Goldwater.
   And his ideas seemed pretty radical at the time. He just didn't
believe that all the power came from government. He dared to
believe in the people. He dared to believe that the American people
were smart enough and capable enough to shape their own future.
   Well, this conservative idea picked up steam. And slowly,
gradually, it caught on. Gradually, even political leaders began to
realize that the real, deep down, fundamental beliefs of mainstream
America are the same beliefs that this pioneer brought with him in
1952 when he first won election as senator from Arizona.
   (Film clip of Goldwater's life is shown).
   Barry Goldwater has served our party. (Applause).
   Ladies and gentlemen, if I may have your attention. Let me have
the last word about Barry Goldwater.
   Barry, you've served our party and this nation, and when we've
needed you you've always come through. Next January, George Bush is
going to be sworn in as president of the United States. And when it
happens, it will be in large part because of the pioneering
leadership and party-building of Barry Goldwater _ a man of honor,
a man of integrity, a fighter, an idealist, a patriot, Mr.
Conservative.
   And Barry, for a lot of us, thousands of us here in this room
and millions more around the country who've been inspired by your
leadership over the years, you will always be Mr. Republican.

   Here is a transcript of the speech by former
Gov. Pete du Pont of Delaware to the Republican National Convention
on Monday.
   Thank you ladies and gentlemen.
   Judge Roy Barrera, fellow Republicans, and fellow Americans.
   Over the next four days, we Republicans will be talking to our
fellow citizens about the issues we care about: About our work, our
families and homes, our schools, our worries about crime and drugs,
our desire to extend and expand the peace we have achieved.
   Today, we Republicans are the party of the issues, the party
willing to explore, and examine and put new ideas to work. We are
the party that has brought America back to economic strength, and
George Bush, a man with unequalled experience in government, is the
man who will put its newest ideas to work.
   Last month, the Democrats held their convention in Atlanta. The
most interesting thoughts of that gathering came not from its
presidential candidate, who really represents the failed liberal
policies of the past. No, the most interesting thoughts came from
the Reverend Jesse Jackson.
   I would like to read to you a message I've sent today to
Reverend Jackson. Perhaps it came from all of us.
   Dear Reverend Jackson:
   The du Pont family was deeply moved by the words of the Jackson
family at your convention. The eloquence of your children's
affection was matched by the eloquence of your grandmother's quilt.
   Reverend Jackson, you understand the struggle and pain of
poverty. And the fact that it is less rampant than you portray does
not make it less important than you suggest. When you reach out to
the poor, your hands and your heart touch us all. You say you come
from the poor, from the projects, from a teen-aged mother and a
broken home. But, Reverend Jackson, you also come from America.
   America has offered you her hand, and you have helped move
America. You are a leader in our nation. As long as your lungs have
breath yours will be a prominent voice. But as long as you speak as
a Democrat, you will never be a successful leader. For the party
you have joined, Reverend Jackson, and the philosophy you have
adopted cannot help the people for whom you speak.

<HEAD>NEW ORLEANS: you speak.</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   I cannot speak as eloquently as you, so let me just speak
plainly: Your party has lost its way. Our party has found its way.
   Your party talks about a peaceful world and that is right. Our
party opened the door to China, built the bridge to Moscow and is
paving the road to peace.
   Your party fights for freedom in South Africa and that is right.
But our party fights for freedom wherever it is in peril and
wherever it is sought.
   Your party walks on the picket lines and that is symbolic, but
our party creates the jobs _ millions and millions and millions of
them.
   Your party sleeps with the homeless and that is noble. But our
party lowers interest rates and that lowers rents.
   Your party recognizes the invaluable role that teachers play in
the lives of our children and you are right. But only our party
protects the indispensable role of parents in the lives of our
children.
   Your party raises the voices of our senior citizens and that is
right. But our party lowers inflation and cuts their cost of living.
   Your party's candidate believes he made a miracle happen in
Massachusetts. Well, he is right. But you know and I know that that
miracle is named President Ronald Reagan.
   Your party bemoans a myth _ the absence of good times with good
jobs and good wages. Our party celebrates a fact _ the creation of
good times with good jobs at good wages.
   Reverend Jackson, you and I and everyone all across America know
that the challenge is not ended. There is work to be done.
   Not everyone is reaping the rewards of America's prosperity. You
dramatize that better than almost anyone, except those who are
suffering.

   America struggled long to achieve equality of rights. We must
now guarantee not only equality of opportunity, but a continued
abundance of opportunity.
   Your party does not know how to do that. And our party does.
   Reverend Jackson, you seek common ground, you seek higher
ground. Well, may I suggest, in all sincerity, that the ground you
seek is here, in New Orleans, is the party of Lincoln and Reagan
and Bush and Kemp and Bork.
   We ask you to join us because we need you, and you need us. You
can help America understand the need. And we Republicans have shown
America how to meet the need.
   Together, we cannot only keep hope alive, we can make dreams
come true.
   Signed, Sincerely, Pete du Pont.
   Now, let me add, my friends, that dreams become reality when
experienced leaders grasp the challenges before us. Michael
Dukakis' record shows that the high taxes and free spending
policies of yesterday guide him.
   George Bush, as a congressman, a diplomat, intelligence chief
and vice president, has shown that, as president, he will not only
keep hope alive, but help make the dreams of millions of Americans
come true.
   Thank you and God bless.

   Here is the transcript of the speech by
former Secretary of State Alexander M. Haig Jr. to the Republican
National Convention on Monday.
   Mr. Chairman, fellow Republicans, ladies and gentlemen:
   I am honored to address the opening session of our party's
convention. For me, this occasion is also a reunion with my former
colleagues from the Republican primary debates. We had our
differences then, but we are all agreed on one thing now: We are
dedicated to making George Bush the next president of the United
States.
   I am confident that in November the people will choose George
Bush because he represents safe and progressive change for America,
safe in that George Bush will build on the solid accomplishments of
the Reagan presidency.
   Americans know Michael Dukakis will trash them.
   Thanks to the Reagan-Bush achievements of the past eight years,
America's international standing has been literally transformed.
When I last spoke to a Republican convention in 1980, we saw a
nation thrown off balance by blunder and gloom. The Soviets were on
the march everywhere. Afghanistan had been seized. Soviet
surrogates were triumphant in Kampuchea, Southern Africa and
Central America. A cruel war raged in the Persian Gulf, our allies
were disheartened and freedom was in retreat. And all the Democrats
could offer was indecision and malaise.
   Today, eight years later, the policy of peace through strength
has begun to pay off. The Russians are leaving Afghanistan. Their
surrogates in Africa and Asia are in trouble. The Persian Gulf
conflict is drawing to a conclusion.
   The Soviets are negotiating our arms control agenda of reduction
and cuts, designed not to increase Soviet superiority. Democracy,
not communism, is on the march. George Bush helped make this happen
and he is indeed the safe candidate for America.
   But he also knows what changes are needed to strengthen the most
successful administration in recent history. The Bush team has made
progressive change central to our party platform at this convention.
   In contrast, hard evidence confirms that Governor Dukakis is not
the candidate of safe progressive change, but the candidate of
radical and dangerous change.
   He does not believe in peace through strength. As chief
executive of the state of Massachusetts he has steadfastly refused
to permit the critical warning and communication facility _ the
Ground Wave Emergency Network (GWEN) _ to be built in his state,
leaving a serious gap in our nation's defense.
   He will turn over our global peace-keeping obligations
exclusively to international organizations _ the UN or the OAS. In
the Third World, he will resurrect the sterile policies of George
McGovern.

   Michael Dukakis will weaken America by withdrawing support for
the MX and the Migitman missiles and reduce SDI to a constrained
research and development program. Until recently he has even
opposed the B1 and Stealth bombers.
   Of course the Democrats know that people would reject the real
Michael Dukakis. So, as President Reagan has said, he is traveling
incognito. You have to admit Atlanta was good theater. It was an
off-Broadway revival of ``The Odd Couple,'' starring the diminutive
clerk from Massachusetts and the tall stranger from Texas.
   But when you look at the real Dukakis-Bentsen foreign policies
you have to ask yourself, ``are they running against us or are they
running against each other?''
   And then there's the Reverend Jesse Jackson who likes to say ``a
bird likes to fly on two wings.'' Maybe he forgot some birds with
two wings can't fly at all _ like the extinct dodo bird that was
too stupid to defend itself, or the ostrich which prefers to live
with danger by ignoring it.
   In fact, the more you look at it, the less the Democratic ticket
looks like a bird at all. It's more like a bat _ blind as a bat,
endowed with the sophisticated sensing mechanisms we saw in Atlanta
but totally unable to differentiate. Flying erratically for brief
periods at low levels and hanging upside down for extended periods
in dark, damp caves up to its naval in Guano.
   Lord, America doesn't need any more of that. And so, my friends,
you and I know that next November's election may be the most
important since World War II. Our efforts this week may be decisive
in its outcome.
   We are in New Orleans:
   _ To unify our party
   _ To endorse our worthy candidate, George Bush
   _ To dedicate America to safe and progressive change
   _ To dedicate ourselves, and in behalf of mankind, to a world
guided by rule of law and peace through strength. I thank you.

   Here is a transcript of the speech by Rep.
Jack Kemp of New York to the Republican National Convention on
Monday night.
   Thank you very much.
   I want to tell you.
   Thank you, Elizabeth Dole.
   I want to tell you my favorite Ronald Reagan story.
   But first of all, I want to thank Elizabeth Dole, not only for
her very gracious introduction but for the great service she has
rendered America by serving in Ronald Reagan's Cabinet. Thank you,
Elizabeth.
   It'll probably come as no surprise to you that my favorite
Ronald Reagan movie is ``Knute Rockne, All-American'' _ starring
Pat O'Brien as Knute Rockne, and Ronald Reagan as George Gipp.
   We all remember the famous line about ``winning one for the
Gipper.'' But I'll always remember that movie for another scene. At
practice one day, coach Knute Rockne turns to George Gipp, a
freshman running back at Notre Dame, and tells him to go in and
scrimmage against the varsity. And Rockne says to the Gipper,
``They'll give you the ball. You just run with it.''
   Ronald Reagan looks at coach Rockne and says, ``How far, coach?''
   Well, Mr. President, when America gave you the ball eight years
ago, no one could have imagined how far you would carry it.
   And today, thanks to you Mr. President, our nation is in the
midst of the most powerful renewal and expansion in our history; an
America poised, better than any nation on Earth, for the exploding
potential of the last decade of this century, and the boundless
horizons of the next.
   Now, we all know the dreary litany of domestic troubles that
you, Mr. President, and George Bush faced in 1980: double-digit
inflation; rising unemployment; a 21 percent prime rate, and a
mortgage rate of 16 percent; a falling living standard, and the
very real fear that the world was somehow running out of energy.
Worst of all, there was a sense of despair, and defeat, something
the American people have never felt before _ and they didn't like
it.
   When you, Mr. President, and George Bush took office in 1981, we
had to free this nation from the stifling hand of excessive
government, the crushing tax burden on families and on business,
the smothering regulations _ all of which had sent America into the
worst competitive decline of our history.
   Contrary to all the doomsayers, we have witnessed an
entrepreneurial renaissance. It's electrified the world. It's
raised our standard of living. We've created more than 5 million
new small businesses, and 17 million new jobs _ and as Elizabeth
Dole said, they are good jobs, good for all the American people. In
the last five years, America has led the world in industrial output
and the creation of new manufacturing jobs in America.
   Today, even the rest of the world is investing in our country.
They're building factories in our nation. They're creating jobs for
Americans _ and, ladies and gentlemen, we're now increasing our
exports to the world at the astonishing rate of 30 percent a year.
And what's so great, we've created a ``working model'' of freedom
and prosperity, a model that will not only carry the United States
into the 21st century, but it will help carry other countries as
well.

   Abraham Lincoln, the founder of the Republican Party, gave this
nation a new birth of freedom. Well, Mr. President, you've helped
give the whole world a new birth of freedom.
   Nations around the world are following our example, choosing low
tax rates, less government, and more freedom. They're learning what
our people knew right from the beginning _ that freedom works. And,
ladies and gentlemen, freedom will work wherever it's tried on this
Earth. That is our model for the world.
   Our opponents tell us and tell the American people that
Reaganomics has failed; that, because of problems we have yet to
solve, America has failed. But if that's the case, why are so many
nations in the world following our example? Why are delegations
pouring in from Europe and Asia, from Africa, and Latin America _
to study the American miracle that has created more new jobs, and
more new businesses, than all of Europe and Japan combined _
without inflation, and that is a miracle.
   Today, with America leading the way, democracy and freedom are
on the march around the world. The world's political climate is
changing, and even its most dangerous political dinosaurs _
socialism and Marxism _ are threatened with extinction. The Soviet
Union and communist China are trying to reform their societies and
their economies, not out of some ideological awakening, but because
they have to.
   Ladies and gentlemen, what a sight it was, what it was, an
opportunity to watch Ronald Reagan, an American president _
standing at Moscow State University, under the very nose of
Vladimir Ilyich Lenin, standing there and proclaiming faith,
democracy, freedom, human rights for Soviet Jews and Christians.
And making us proud of the American ideal. He said, throughout the
world, free markets are the model for economic growth. That
democracy is the standard by which all governments are measured.
And those Russian students knew that, finally, they were hearing
the truth.
   Well, ladies and gentlemen, our party, like our nation, has only
one reason for existence. Both were born out of a dedication to a
very simple yet profound proposition: that all human beings are
equal in the eyes of our creator _ and therefore all people are
equally endowed with inalienable human rights.
   And the secret of the American miracle is that we put our faith
in the American people _ in their talent, their creativity, and in
their God-given potential. And that has been the secret of the
American miracle. We rediscovered under Ronald Reagan that our
people are our greatest resource.
   And as the party of Abraham Lincoln _ and Reagan _ we believe
that freedom and hope and opportunity can't be for just some of us.
They've got to be for all of us. America must keep moving ahead. We
can't leave anyone behind.
   Democrats measure compassion by how many people are receiving
government assistance _ we measure compassion by how few need it.
Democrats see America locked in a class struggle between owners and
workers, between the rich and the poor _ we want an America where
workers can become owners and poor can become rich.

   Governor Dukakis talks about plant closings _ we want to
continue plant openings. And Democrats see America in terms of its
limits _ we see America in terms of its boundless possibilities.
   Ladies and gentlemen, if we do our job right, I predict that by
1992 _ at the re-election of George Bush as our president of the
United States _ I want to predict here tonight that one-quarter of
our party will be black, Hispanic, and Asian-Americans, who see in
our party the best chance they've ever had for their themselves and
their families.
   What's the real purpose of the Reagan revolution? It wasn't to
defeat Democrats. It was to provide superior leadership, to provide
new ideas, and to restore confidence in America. Like the American
Revolution itself, the greatness of our revolution is not to be
measured by who we're against, but by what we are for.
   Last month in Atlanta, last month in Atlanta, the leaders of the
Democratic Party failed to say what they're for. All they said is
who they're against. They all said, ``We can't stand another eight
years of Republican policies.'' Well, of course they can't. Another
eight years of Republican policies, it'll be clear to Ted Kennedy
and Jim Wright, and Michael Dukakis, that with 17 million new jobs,
and 5{ million new small businesses, at that rate, ladies and
gentlemen, all their constituents will be Republicans.
   Well, this is no time to stop. No time to go back. Got a lot of
work to do. We don't want low inflation _ we want no inflation. We
don't want low unemployment _ we want no unemployment. We need a
safety net to keep people from falling _ but we need a ladder of
opportunity upon which all people can climb.
   Ladies and gentlemen, we don't just want to oppose communism _
we want to support those men and women who are fighting for freedom
and democracy, whether they're in Afghanistan, Angola or Central
America. We want to free people. We want to free people not only
from too much dependence on government _ we want to free them from
dependence on drugs, from disrespect for human life.
   Mr. President, you've brought us to the threshold of a new era.
In fact, you've brought us over the threshold. You've shown us, Mr.
President, that we can do more than contain our adversaries _ we
can transcend them. You've shown us, Mr. President, how we can even
make the threat of nuclear war obsolete, through the now-proven
technology of strategic defense for America. And you've reminded us
that the very first and best Department of Health, Education and
Welfare is a strong American family.
   Mr. President, most of all, above everything else, you've shown
us that the power of a right idea is the single greatest force on
this Earth. It's a powerful legacy that you leave us, it's a
powerful legacy that you're handing us here tonight in New Orleans.
And we just want you and Nancy to know that, under the able
leadership of George Bush, this Republican Party is going to take
it and run with it and we're going to win in November.
   We're going to finish the job. We're going to finish what we
began in 1980: To help all Americans _ to help in the spirit of
Abraham Lincoln, we want to help all people everywhere _ to share
in the success of freedom, and democracy, and peace.
   That is our legacy and that is our future.
   God bless you,Mr. President. May God bless America. Thank you
very, very much.

   Here is a transcript of the speech delivered
by first lady Nancy Reagan at the Republican National Convention on
Monday.
   Thank you, thank you very much. Thank you.
   Eight years ago I stood here with my family _ in this same
dress, as a matter of fact. I do hang on _ when my husband was
nominated for the first time.
   And four years ago, I stood up here and thanked you for all that
you'd done for me, not knowing that I was going to have a chance to
do it again. But you've given us such a wonderful life, a life that
I really never dreamed possible and it's the most extraordinary
feeling to represent a nation and its people. And I can never thank
you enough for all the experiences and memories that you've made
possible.
   The last eight years have been the most fulfilling ones of my
life. Tom mentioned the drug letters that I have received, and the
program has meant so much to me. But you really gave me that
chance, and you really gave me the chance to be more than I thought
I could be, and brought something out in me that I didn't know was
there.
   And you helped me and I thank you a great deal for that. And
you've always been there for us.
   It's true there were some rough times for my husband and me, but
as I said to you four years ago, I always felt that I could draw on
you for your support and your affection. And I did draw on you a
great deal more than you knew, and I thank you for that too.
   Now, I'm sure that this will be the last time that I'll speak
before a Republican convention. My husband's and my time on the
center stage of Republican politics is passing, one era's ending,
another is beginning.
   But before I go, I want to thank you for all the years that
you've worked for us, and on our behalf. So many years really. I'll
miss you, I'll never forget you.
   So, good night and God bless.

   Here is a transcript of the speech delivered
by former Secretary of Transportation Elizabeth Hanford Dole at the
Republican National Convention on Monday.
   Thank you. Thank you very much.
   Theresa. You're an outstanding member of the North Carolina
Legislature, and I know that you're going to have a resounding
re-election victory in November. Thank you so much.
   Peace, progress, opportunity. That's what we're here to
celebrate. That's the legacy of a great president, Ronald Reagan.
And that will be the living legacy of the next president of the
United States, George Bush.
   First, let me thank the Democratic Party leaders for televising
their Convention. What I saw and heard reminded me and millions of
other former Democrats why we're proud to be Republicans.
   The Dukakis convention speech was just like the Democrat
platform, hedging on defense, hedging on taxes, hedging on
spending. We're not running against Bentsen and Dukakis, we're
running against Bentsen and Hedges.
   ``Governor Hedges,'' ``Governor Hedges,'' ``Governor Hedges''
tried mightily to paint over his liberal policies with pretty
rhetoric. But the make-up job failed. As an old federal trade
commissioner, I want to know -- whatever happened to truth in
advertising?
   But we've come to New Orleans not to pin the tail on the donkey.
We're here to pin our hopes on the American future. And we're not
buying the Dukakis deception. Despite what he says, this election
is about ideas and ideology. They do matter. They will matter to
Americans who face a choice this year as stark and dramatic as any
in memory.
   We Americans faced a similar choice in 1980. And what did we get
for our choice? We got a president who doesn't apologize for
American interests _ he asserts them.
   We got a breakthrough in Soviet relations and the INF treaty. We
got the longest economic boom in peacetime history.
   It was my privilege for seven years to serve the man who made
this happen _ one of America's greatest presidents, Ronald Reagan.
Thank you, Mr. President. Thank you, Mr. President, for that
opportunity.
   Today's strong economy means stronger families. And we affirm
the woman who chooses to work in the home. But our strong economy
has also provided needed jobs for millions of women, and let me say
to the women of America: I respect the fact that some of you have
questions. I also ask you to have an open mind.
   You know better then anyone that a job _ a good job _ is
absolutely basic to a family's happiness and stability. That's our
freedom. Are we going to let them take it away? (Crowd yells,
``No.'')
   In the past eight years, President Reagan has created an
incredible jobs machine _ more jobs for more Americans than ever
before. And two-thirds of the 17 million new jobs created since
1982 went to women. Good jobs, not bad jobs.
   Real work, not make work. That's our freedom. Are we going to
let them take it away? (Crowd yells, ``No.'')
   You did it. You were the expansion. You, the women of America _
who are holding jobs as never before, who've started businesses as
never before, who have invested as never before. This expansion _
it's your triumph. But it was Ronald Reagan and George Bush who set
in motion the forces which allowed that growth to occur and the
economy to bloom. That's our freedom. Are we going to let them take
it away? (Crowd yells, ``No.'')
   America is on a roll. If this great economic upsurge is stopped,
if we have a President who raises taxes again and in creases
regulation again and stifles growth again _ and believe me, that's
what Michael Dukakis will do _ if we let the liberals back in, we
lose all that progress _ your progress.

<TEXT>
   We women would be especially vulnerable. We're always vulnerable
when jobs are cut back and the economy stagnates.
   Remember the Carter years, when workers were afraid to open pay
envelopes because there just might be a pink slip inside, when
families gave up hope of ever owning their own home, when parents
feared their childrens' generation would be worse off than their
own. That was real economic violence. We have been there before,
and we must never go back again.
   So I ask you, women of America, not just to support us. Work
with us, to ensure that this growth continues. Work with us, so
that each American has a chance and a choice. Work with us to
change what needs to be changed.
   The future belongs to our children, and child care is one of
those changes. Michael Dukakis wants to march our kids lock step to
a government institution where Washington will set all the rules.
   Only one kind of child care deserves federal aid, he says. But
governor, people work part-time, full-time, night shifts, day
shifts, swing shifts. One size does not fit all.
   George Bush, a father of five, a grandfather of 10, will give
American parents what they want _ child care supervised by people
who share their values: in a community-based setting, a relative's
or neighbor's home, a church-sponsored center, or by the mother or
father who works full-time at home. George Bush believes the
parents should choose.
   But taking care of children also means making bad schools good
and good schools better. George Bush and Barbara Bush, too, who has
worked tirelessly to end illiteracy, understand what we have to do.
   We must rescue a generation of children from the social
experiments and educational fads that gave us erratic school
policies, declining skills and low SAT scores. Ronald Reagan and
George Bush have reordered our educational priorities. Commitment
to excellence will continue to be our watchword.
   But education is more than molding the intellect _ it means
shaping the character as well. It is character that will enable our
children to say ``yes'' to the intellectual challenges of a new
century and ``no'' to the physical and moral dangers of drugs.
   The war on drugs must be fought by the Coast Guard patrolling
our waters, and police officers in the alleys of our cities. These
brave men and women can win battles, but George Bush knows that
ultimately the war can only be won when the fathers, the mothers,
the sons and the daughters of America unite to speak with one voice
to just say no.
   Nancy Reagan saw this solution when most politicians didn't even
see the problem. What a great first lady she has been.
   Next spring marks the 200th anniversary of the first
inauguration of a United States President. There have been many
changes in our nation since that day when George Washington took
the oath of office. Yet the values on which this great nation was
founded are just as vital today as they were 200 years ago.
   We would do well to remember the parting words of that first
president who said: ``Of all the dispositions ... which lead to
political prosperity, religion and morality are indispensable. The
mere politician, equally with the pious man, ought to respect and
cherish them.''
   What wise words from our first president.
   It is reassuring in this day, when we find faith and morality
under attack, to know that George Bush is a man who truly respects
and cherishes these guiding principles.
   As we go forward to elect a new President, let us then select a
man who will keep faith with the timeless values on which this
great nation was founded, even as he leads our nation into a
greater future.
   Tonight, I am proud to be an American. Tonight, I am proud to be
a Republican.
   And tonight, I am proud that a great man, George Bush, will be
our candidate for the next President of the United States.
   Thank you. God bless you all.

   Here is a transcript of the speech by
President Reagan to the Republican National Convention on Monday
night.
   Thank you. Thank you, thank you all.
   Madam chairman, delegates to this convention and fellow
citizens, thank you for that warm and generous welcome. Nancy and I
have been enjoying the finest of Southern hospitality since we
arrived here yesterday.
   And believe me, after that reception, I don't think the Big Easy
has ever been bigger than it is tonight.
   And with all due respect to Cajun cuisine, cooking, and New
Orleans jazz, nothing could be hotter than the spirit of the
delegates in this hall, except maybe a victory celebration on Nov.
8.
   In that spirit, I think we could be forgiven if we give
ourselves a little pat on the back for having made Republican a
proud word once again.
   And, America a proud nation again.
   Nancy and I are so honored to be your guest tonight _ to share a
little of your special time. And we thank you.
   Now I want to invoke executive privilege to talk for a moment
about a very special lady who has been selfless, not just for our
party but for the entire nation. She is a strong, courageous and
compassionate woman, and wherever she's gone, here in the United
States as well as abroad, whether with young or old, or comforting
the grieving or supporting the youngsters who are fighting the
scourge of drugs, she makes us proud. I've been proud of her for a
long time, but never more so than in these last eight years. With
your tribute to Nancy today, you warmed my heart as well as hers _
and believe me, she deserved your tribute.
   I am deeply grateful to you for what you have done.
   When people tell me that I became president on Jan. 20, 1981, I
feel I have to correct them. You don't become president of the
United States. You are given temporary custody of an institution
called the presidency, which belongs to our people.
   Having temporary custody of this office has been for me a sacred
trust and an honor beyond words or measure. That trust began with
many of you in this room many conventions ago.
   Many's the time that I've said a prayer of thanks to all
Americans who placed this trust in my hands, and tonight, please
accept again our heartfelt gratitude, Nancy's and mine, for this
special time that you've given in our lives.
   Just a moment ago, you multiplied the honor with a moving
tribute. And being only human, there's a part of me that would like
to take credit for what we have achieved.
   But tonight, before we do anything else, let us remember, that
tribute really belongs to 245 million citizens who make up the
greatest _ and the first _ three words in the Constitution: We the
people.
   It is the American people who endured the great challenge of
lifting us from the depths of national calamity, renewing our
mighty economic strength and leading the way to restoring our
respect in the world. They are an extraordinary breed we call
Americans.
   So if there is any salute deserved tonight _ it's to the heroes
everywhere in this land who make up the doers, the dreamers, and
the life-builders without which our glorious experiment in
democracy would have failed.
   So, this, this convention brings back so many memories for a
fellow like me. I can still remember my first Republican
convention. Abraham Lincoln giving a speech that sent tingles down
my spine. No, I have to confess, I wasn't actually there. The truth
is, way back then I belonged to the other party.
   But surely we can remember another convention. Eight years ago,
we gathered in Detroit in a troubled time for our beloved country.

   And we gathered solemnly to share our dreams.
   And, when I look back, I wonder if we dared be so bold to take
on those burdens.
   But in that same city of Detroit, when the 2Oth century was only
in its second year, another great Republican, Teddy Roosevelt, told
Americans not to hold back from dangers ahead, but to rejoice:
``... our hearts lifted with the faith that to us and to our
children ... it shall be given to make this republic the mightiest
among the peoples of mankind,'' Teddy said those years ago.
   In 1980, we needed every bit of that kind of faith.
   That year was our dream that together we could rescue America
and make a new beginning _ to create anew that shining city on a
hill. The dream we shared was to reclaim our government _ to
transform it from one that was consuming our prosperity into one
that would get out of the way of those who created prosperity.
   It was a dream of again making our nation strong enough to
preserve world peace and freedom and to recapture our national
destiny.
   We made a determination that our dream would not be built on a
foundation of sand _ something called ``trust me government'' _ but
we would trust, instead, the American spirit.
   And, yes, we were unashamed in believing that this dream was
driven by a community of shared values of family, work,
neighborhood, peace, and freedom.
   And on the night of July l7, 1980, we left with a mutual pledge
to conduct a national crusade to make America great again.
   We had faith, because the heroes in our midst had never failed
us before. Tom Paine knew what these Americans with character of
steel could do when he wrote: ``...the harder the conflict, the
more glorious the triumph.''
   And my fellow citizens, while our triumph is not yet complete,
the road has been glorious, indeed. Eight years ago, we met at a
time when America was in economic chaos _ and today, we meet in a
time of economic promise. We met then in international distress and
today with global hope.
   Now, I think we can be forgiven if we engage in a little review
of that history tonight.
   As the saying goes _ ``Just a friendly reminder.''
   I've been doing a little remembering of my own because of all
that inflated rhetoric by our friends in Atlanta last month. But
then, inflation is their specialty.
   Before we came to Washington, Americans had just suffered the
two worst back-to-back years of inflation in 60 years. Those are
the facts.
   And as John Adams said: ``Facts are stubborn things.''
   Interest rates had jumped to over 21 percent _ the highest in
120 years _ more than doubling the average monthly mortgage
payments for working families _ our families.
   When they sat around the kitchen table, it was not to plan
summer vacations, it was to plan economic survival.
   Facts are stubborn things.
   Industrial production was down, and productivity was down for
two consecutive years. The average _ missed me (Reagan responded to
a sound) _ the average weekly wage plunged 9 percent.
   Median family income fell 5{ percent. Facts are stubborn things.

<TEXT>
   That was our change.
   So together we pulled out of a tailspin and created 17{ million
good jobs. That's more than a quarter of a million new jobs a month
_ every month _ for 68 consecutive months. America is working
again. Just, and just since our 1984 convention, we have created
over 11 million of those new jobs. Now, just why would our friends
on the other side want to change that? Why do they think putting
you out of work is better than putting you to work?
   New homes are being built. New car sales reached record levels.
Exports are starting to climb again. Factory capacity is
approaching maximum use. You know, I've noticed they don't call it
``Reaganomics'' anymore.
   As, as for inflation _ well, that, too, has changed. We changed
it from the time it hit 18 percent in 1980 _ down to between 3{ and
4 percent. Interest rates are less than half of what they were. In
fact, in fact nearly half of all mortgages taken out on family
homes in 1986 and more than a third of those in 1987 were actually
old loans being refinanced at the new, lower rates. Young families
have finally been able to get some relief.
   These, too, were our changes.
   We rebuilt our armed forces. We liberated Grenada from the
communists and helped return that island to democracy. We, we
struck a firm blow against Libyan terrorism. We've seen the growth
of democracy in 90 percent of Latin America. The Soviets have begun
to pull out of Afghanistan. The bloody Iran-Iraq war is coming to
an end. And for the first time in eight years we have the prospects
of peace in southwest Africa and the removal of Cuban and other
foreign forces from the region. And in the 2,765 days of our
administration, not one inch of ground has fallen to the communists.
   Today _ (crowd chants, ``Four more years'') _ today, today _
(crowd continues chant) _ today, today we have the first treaty in
world history to eliminate an entire class of U.S. and Soviet
nuclear missiles. We're working on the Strategic Defense Initiative
to defend ourselves and our allies against nuclear terror, and
American and Soviet relations are the best they've ever been since
World War II.
   And virtually all this change occurred _ and continues to occur
_ in spite of the resistance of those liberal elites who loudly
proclaim that it's time for a change. They resisted our defense
buildup; they resisted our tax cuts; they resisted cutting the fat
out of government; and they resisted our appointments of judges
committed to the law and the Constitution.
   And it's time for some more straight talk. This time it's about
the budget deficit. Yes, it's much too high. But the president
doesn't vote for a budget, and the president can't spend a dime.
Only the Congress can do that. They blame, they blame the defense
increases for the deficit, yet defense spending today, in real
dollars, is almost exactly what it was six years ago. In a six-year
period, Congress cut defense spending authority by over $125
billion. And for every $1 reduction in defense outlays, they added
$2 to domestic spending. Now, if they had passed my first budget,
my first spending plan in 1982, the cumulative outlays and deficits
would have been $207 billion lower by 1986.

<HEAD>NEW ORLEANS: by 1986.</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Every single year I've been in office, I have supported and
called for a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution, and the
liberals have said no every year.
   I've called for the line-item veto, which 43 governors have, to
cut fat in the budget, and the liberals have said no.
   Every year, I have attempted to limit their wild spending
sprees, and they've said no.
   They would have us believe that runaway budget deficits began in
1981 when we took office. Well, let me tell you something _ the
fact is, when they began their war on poverty in the middle '60s,
from 1965 through 1980 _ in just those 15 years _ the budgets
increased to five times what they had been, and the deficits went
up to 52 times what they had been before their war on poverty.
   Now, don't we know that, if they're elected, their answer will
be the one they have relied on in the past _ and that is higher
taxes.
   The other party has controlled _ (crowd boos) _ the other party
has controlled the House of Representatives for 52 out of the last
56 years. (Crowd boos again.) They've controlled the Senate also
for 46 of those years. (Crowd boos again.) Where we really need a
change is to elect Republican majorities in both houses. (Crowd
cheers.)
   Then, and then, George Bush can have a team that will protect
your tax cuts, keep America strong, hold down inflation and
interest rates, appoint judges to preserve your rights, and, yes,
reduce the budget deficit.
   Early in the first term, we set out to reduce federal
regulations that had been imposed on the people, on business, and
on liberal and _ or, local and state governments.
   Today, I'm proud to say, that we have eliminated so many
unnecessary regulations that government-required paperwork imposed
on citizens, businesses, and other levels of government has been
reduced by an estimated 600 million man-hours of paperwork a year.
   And George was there. (Crowd chants, ``Four more years.'')
   No. You haven't heard it all yet. George Bush headed up that
task force that eliminated those regulations.
   In 1980 and before, it took seven weeks to get a Social Security
card. Now it takes 10 days. It only takes 10 days to get a
passport. It used to take 43 days. It took 75 days to get an export
license; now it's only 17 days, and for some countries, only five.
It took over 100 days to process a claim for a Department of
Housing and Urban Development Title I loan _ 100 days. It now takes
less than one-fourth of that _ 22 days.
   I think these specifics suggest there is a new level of
competent management in the departments of our government.
   George played a major role in everything that we have
accomplished in these eight years.
   Now, early on, we had a foreign policy problem. Our NATO allies
were under the threat of Soviet intermediate-range missiles, and
NATO had no equivalent deterrent. Our effort to provide a deterrent
_ Pershing and ground-launched cruise missiles on the NATO line _
resulted in political problems for our NATO allies.
   There was objection on the part of many of their people to
deployment of our missiles. George represented us in Brussels with
the heads of the NATO countries, and they agreed when he finished
to take the missiles. This subsequently persuaded the Soviets to
sign the INF Treaty and begin removing their SS-20s.
   None of our achievements happened by accident, but only because
we overcame liberal opposition to put our programs in place. And
without George Bush to build on those policies, everything we've
achieved will be at risk. All the work, sacrifice and effort of the
American people could end in the very same disaster that we
inherited in 1981.
   Because I feel so strongly about the work that must continue and
the need to protect our gains for the American family and for
national security, I want to share with you the qualities we should
seek in the next president.

<HEAD>NEW ORLEANS: next president.</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   We need someone who's big enough and experienced enough to
handle tough and demanding negotiations with Mr. Gorbachev _
because this is no time to gamble with on-the-job training. We need
someone who's prepared to be president and who has the commitment
to stand up for you against massive new taxes and who will keep
alive the hope and promise that keeps our economy strong.
   But it takes somebody who's this office from the inside, who
senses the danger points, will be cool under fire and knows the
range of answers when the tough questions come.
   Well, that's the George Bush that I've seen up close _ when the
staff and Cabinet members have closed the door and when the two of
us are alone. Someone who is not afraid to speak his mind and who
can cut to the core of an issue. Someone who never runs away from a
fight, never backs away from his beliefs, and never makes excuses.
   This office is not mine to give _ only you, the people, can do
that. But I love America too much and care too much about where we
will be in the next few years. I care that we give custody of this
office to someone who will build on our changes, not retreat to the
past _ someone who will continue the change all of us fought for.
To preserve what we have and not risk losing it all _ America needs
George Bush _ and Barbara Bush as first lady.
   (Crowd chants, ``Four more years.'') All right.
   With George Bush, I'll know, as we approach the new millenium,
our children will have a future secure with a nation at peace and
protected against aggression; we'll have a prosperity that spreads
the blessings of our abundance and opportunity across all America;
we'll have safe and active neighborhoods; drug-free schools that
send our children soaring in the atmosphere of great ideas and deep
values; and a nation confidently willing to take its leadership
into the uncharted reaches of a new age.
   So, George, I'm in your corner. I'm ready to volunteer a little
advice now and then, and offer a pointer or two on strategy, if
asked. I'll help keep the facts straight or just stand back and
cheer. But George, just one personal request: Go out there and win
one for the Gipper.
   As you can imagine, I'm sorely tempted to spend the rest of this
evening telling the truth about our friends who met in Atlanta _
but, then, why should I have all the fun?
   So, for the next few moments, let's talk about the future.
   This is the last Republican convention I will address as
president. Maybe you'll see your way to inviting me back sometime.
   But like so many of us, as I said earlier, I started out in the
other party. But 40 years ago, I cast my last vote as a Democrat.
It was a party in which Franklin Delano Roosevelt promised the
return of power to the states. It was a party where Harry Truman
committed a strong and resolute America to preserving freedom.
F.D.R. had run on a platform of eliminating useless boards and
commissions and returning autonomy and authority to local
governments and to the states.
   That party changed _ and it will never be the same. They left
me; I didn't leave them.
   So, it was our Republican Party that gave me a political home.
When I signed up for duty, I didn't have to check my principles at
the door. And I soon found out that the desire for victory did not
overcome our devotion to ideals.

<TEXT>
   And what ideals those have been.
   Our party speaks for human freedom _ for the sweep of liberties
that are at the core of our existence. We do not shirk from our
duties to preserve freedom so it can unfold across the world for
yearning millions.
   We believe that lasting peace comes only through strength and
not through the good will of our adversaries.
   We have a healthy skepticism of government _ checking its
excesses at the same time we are willing to harness its energy when
it helps improve the lives of our citizens.
   We have pretty strong notions that higher tax receipts are no
inherent right of the federal government. We don't think that
inflation and high interest rates show compassion for the poor, the
young, and the elderly.
   We respect the values that bind us together as families and as a
nation.
   For our children _ we don't think it's wrong to have them
committed to pledging each day to the ``one nation, under God,
indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.''
   And we have so many requirements in their classrooms, why can't
we at least have one thing that is voluntary _ and that is allow
our kids to repair quietly to their faith to say a prayer to start
the day as Congress does.
   For the unborn _ quite simply _ shouldn't they be able to live
to become children in those classrooms?
   Those, those are some of our principles. You in this room, and
millions like you watching and listening tonight, are selfless and
dedicated to a better world based on these principles.
   You aren't quitters. You walk not just precincts, but for a
cause. You stand for something _ the finest warriors for free
government that I have known. Nancy and I thank you for letting us
be a part of your tireless determination to leave a better world
for our children.
   And that's why we're here, isn't it? A better world.
   I know I've said this before, but I believe that God put this
land between the two great oceans to be found by special people
from every corner of the world who had that extra love of freedom
that prompted them to leave their homeland and come to this land to
make it a brilliant light beam of freedom to the world.
   It's our gift to have visions, and I want to share that of a
young boy who wrote to me shortly after I took office. In his
letter he said, ``I love America because you can join Cub Scouts if
you want to. You have a right to worship as you please. If you have
the ability, you can try to be anything you want to be. And I also
like America because we have about 200 flavors of ice cream.''
   Truth, truth through the eyes of a child. Freedom of
association. Freedom of worship. Freedom of hope and opportunity.
And the pursuit of happiness _ in this case, choosing among 200
flavors of ice cream.

   That's America. Everyone with his or her vision of the American
promise. That's why we're a magnet for the world _ for those who
dodged bullets and gave their lives coming over the Berlin Wall and
others, only a few of whom avoided death, coming in tiny boats on
turbulent oceans.
   This land, its people, the dreams that unfold here and the
freedom to bring it all together _ well, those are what make
America soar _ up where you can see hope billowing in those freedom
winds.
   When our children turn the pages of our lives, I hope they'll
see that we had a vision to pass forward a nation as nearly perfect
as we could. Where there's decency, tolerance, generosity, honesty,
courage, common sense, fairness, and piety.
   This is my vision, and I'm grateful to God for blessing me with
a good life and a long one. But when I pack up my bags in
Washington, don't expect me to be happy to hear all this talk about
the twilight of my life.
   Twilight? Twilight? Not in America.
   Here, it's a sunrise every day. Fresh new opportunities. Dreams
to build.
   Twilight? That's not possible, because I confess there are times
when I feel like I'm still little Dutch Reagan racing my brother
down the hill to the swimming hole under the railroad bridge over
the Rock River.
   You see, there's no sweeter day than each new one because here
in our country, it means something wonderful can happen to you.
   And something wonderful happened to me.
   We lit a prairie fire a few years back. Those flames were fed by
passionate ideas and convictions, and we were determined to make
them run, burn I should say, all across America.
   And what times we've had. Together we've fought for causes we
loved. But we can never let the fire go out or quit the fight,
because the battle is never over. Our freedom must be defended over
and over again. And then again.
   There's still a lot of brush to clear out at the ranch, fences
that need repair, and horses to ride.
   But I want you to know that if the fires ever dim, I'll leave my
phone number and address behind just in case you need a foot
soldier. Just let me know, and I'll be there _ as long as words
don't leave me and as long as this sweet country strives to be
special during its shining moment on Earth.
   Twilight, you say?
   Listen to H.G. Wells. H.G. Wells says: ``The past is but the
beginning of a beginning, and all that is and has been is but the
twilight of the dawn.''
   Well, that's a new day _ our sunlit new day _ to keep alive the
fire so that when we look back at the time of choosing, we can say
that we did all that could be done.
   Never less.
   Thank you, good night. God bless you and God bless America.

   Here are excerpts from the text of the speech
by President Reagan to the Republican National Convention on Monday
night.
   Nancy and I are so honored to be your guest tonight _ to share a
little of your special time. And we thank you. ...
   ... Eight years ago, we gathered in Detroit in a troubled time
for our beloved country. ...
   That year, it was our dream that together we would rescue
America and make a New Beginning _ to create anew that shining city
on a hill. ...
   It was a dream of again making our nation strong enough to
preserve world peace and freedom and to recapture our national
destiny. ...
   And on the night of July l7, 1980, we left with a mutual pledge
to conduct a national crusade to make America great again. ...
   And my fellow citizens, while our triumph is not yet complete,
the road has been glorious, indeed. ...
   Before we came to Washington, Americans had just suffered the
two worst back-to-back years of inflation in 60 years. Those are
the facts. ...
   And as John Adams said: ``Facts are stubborn things. . . .''
   ... When they sat around the kitchen table, it was not to plan
summer vacations, it was to plan economic survival. ...
   When we met in Detroit in that summer of 1980 _ it was a summer
of discontent for America around the world. Our national defense
had been so weakened, the Soviet Union had begun to engage in
reckless aggression. ...
   ... Our embassy in Pakistan was burned to the ground, and the
one in Iran was stormed and occupied with all Americans taken as
hostages. ...
   We rolled up our sleeves and went to work in January of 1981; we
focused on hope, not despair. ...
   We said something shocking. Taxes ought to be reduced, not
raised. ...
   We rebuilt our armed forces. We liberated Grenada from the
communists and helped return that island to democracy. We struck a
firm blow against Libyan terrorism. We've seen the growth of
democracy in 90 percent of Latin America. The Soviets have begun to
pull out of Afghanistan. The bloody Iran-Iraq war is coming to an
end. For the first time in eight years we have the prospects of
peace in Southwest Africa and the removal of Cuban and other
foreign forces from the region. And in the 2,765 days of our
administration, not one inch of ground has fallen to the communists.
   Today, we have the first treaty in world history to eliminate an
entire class of U.S. and Soviet nuclear missiles. We are working on
the strategic defense initiative to defend ourselves and our allies
against nuclear terror, and American-Soviet relations are the best
they've been since World War II.
   And virtually all this change occurred _ and continues to occur
_ in spite of the resistance of those liberal elites who loudly
proclaim that it's time for a change. ...

   None of our achievements happened by accident ... Without George

   It will take someone who has seen this office from the inside,

   That's the George Bush I've seen up close _ when the staff and

   So, George, I'm in your corner. I'm ready to volunteer a little

asked. I'll help keep the facts straight or just stand back and
cheer. But George, just one personal request: Go out there and make
it one more for the Gipper. ...
   ... When I pack up my bags in Washington, don't expect me to be
happy to hear all this talk about the twilight of my life.
   Twilight? Not in America.
   Here, it's a sunrise every day. Fresh new opportunities. Dreams
to build.
   Twilight? That's not possible, because I confess there are times
when I feel like I'm still Dutch Reagan racing my brother down the
hill to the swimming hole under the railroad bridge over the Rock
River.
   You see, there's no sweeter day than each new one because here
in our country, it means something wonderful can happen to you.
   And something wonderful happened to me.
   We lit a prairie fire a few years back. Those flames were fed by
passionate ideas and convictions, and we were determined to make
them burn all across America. What times we've had!
   Together we've fought for causes we love. But we can never let
the fire go out or quit the fight, because the battle is never
over. Our freedom must be defended over and over again. And then
again.
   There's still a lot of brush to clear out at the ranch, fences
that need repair, and horses to ride.
   But I want you to know that if the fires ever dim, I'll leave my
phone number and address behind just in case you need a foot
soldier. Just let me know, and I'll be there _ as long as words
don't leave me and as long as this sweet country strives to be
special during its shining moment on Earth.
   Twilight, you say?
   Listen to H.G. Wells: ``The past is but the beginning of a
beginning, and all that is and has been is but the twilight of the
dawn.''
   That's a new day _ a sunlit new day _ to keep alive the fire so
that we may look back at the time of choosing, we can say that we
did all that could be done.
   Never less.

   Universal Pictures may have won a temporary
financial victory with ``The Last Temptation of Christ,'' but the
film could be costly to the studio in the long-run, some
fundamentalist religious leaders say.
   The movie played to sold-out crowds last week in seven U.S.
cities and two in Canada, taking in $44,579 per screen for a
three-day total of $401,211, Universal said.
   ``We're gratified at the response of the American people. Every
show sold out. We're pleased,'' Universal President Tom Pollock
said.
   John Krier of Exhibitor Relations Co., which surveys box office
performance, described the film's debut as phenomenal. ``This is a
tremendous showing,'' he said.
   A movie in general release _ for example, one shown on 1,300 to
1,400 screens, ``is really something'' if it takes in $7,000 to
$8,000 a screen, Krier said.
   ``With all this free publicity, of course they were full. But
the more the Christian community sees this thing, the angrier they
will get,'' the Rev. Donald Wildmon of the Tupelo, Miss.-based
American Family Association said Monday.
   The preacher is among several religious leaders who have labeled
the film blasphemous and have urged urged a boycott of MCA Inc.,
Universal's parent company.
   ``There's no question that in Round 1, the publicity that we
generated created a lot of curiosity,'' said Tim Penland, who
served as a religious consultant to Universal but later resigned to
protest the film.
   ``It certainly appears we helped Universal,'' he said. But he
predicted the adverse publicity will ``ultimately burn Universal.''
   ``There comes a point where the publicity becomes damaging,''
Wildmon agreed.
   Wildmon said the demonstrations, which climaxed Thursday with a
march on Universal Studios by 25,000 Christians, are over.
   The next tactic will go beyond the boycott of Universal films,
Universal Tours and appeals to MCA shareholders, he said, adding he
may disclose the next strategy later in the week.
   ``Christians are angry,'' Wildmon said. ``They (Universal) may
realize short-term profits, but in the long-term they will hurt
economically from this. The anger is building and this isn't going
to be forgotten in two weeks.''
   Some conservative Christians have denounced the movie for what
they said was a blasphemous depiction of Jesus, who is portrayed as
fantasizing about abandoning death on the cross to live as a man
and raise a family with Mary Magdalene.
   Director Martin Scorsese, a Roman Catholic, has said the movie
is a work of fiction and was not made with blasphemous intent.

   A 7-year-old boy died from injuries sustained
when a powerboat veered out of control and crashed into a crowd
watching a speedboat race.
   James Herrmann Jr. of Pittsburgh died Monday of massive head
trauma, said John Free, spokesman at Allegheny General Hospital.
   The boy had been in critical condition since Aug. 7, when a
Formula 1 speedboat driven by 1987 Canadian National Champion
Robert Wood catapulted out of the Allegheny River and crashed into
a crowd watching the Three Rivers Regatta.
   Officials said 23 people, including 11 children, were injured.
   Herrmann's father, James Herrmann Sr., 31, remained in fair
condition Monday at Allegheny General with foot injuries, Free said.
   Marine engineers said a series of rough wakes and wind gusts
caused Wood's 1,100-pound, 17-foot powerboat to veer off course
during the seventh lap of the 50-lap race.

<TEXT>
   Pesticide spraying has been
ordered for 600 acres following discovery of the crop-eating White
Fringe Beetle, the first reported sighting of the pest in
California, officials said.
   The beetle, which poses no danger to humans, was spotted by a
homeowner in the Chino area three weeks ago, said John Gardner,
deputy commission for Department of Agriculture.
   State agricultural officials determined last week that the bug
was the White Fringe Beetle, which eats 300 varieties of crops and
plants, he said Monday. The beetle, which is common to Australia,
New Zealand, and Argentina, has a preference for alfalfa and peas,
he said.
   Ground spraying of lawns and shrubs in a 600-acre area south of
Chino was to begin today, he said.
   ``Right now, even though we're seeing a large number of adults,
we're not seeing that much damage on the plants at this point,'' he
said.
   Spraying was expected to continue for three to four weeks.

<TEXT>
   The executor of Liberace's estate
testified he did not know what was killing his famous client until
told by a doctor after the entertainer had signed a new will 13
days before his death.
   The testimony by Joel Strote came at the close of a long, bitter
trial challenging the Beverly Hills, Calif., attorney's role as
executor of Liberace's vast estate.
   Both sides rested their case Monday after weeks of testimony
that exposed the private life of the flamboyant entertainer who
died Feb. 4, 1987, of complications of AIDS.
   Closing arguments were scheduled for this afternoon in state
District Court. It will then be up to Judge Michael Wendell to
determine whether Strote should be removed as executor of the
Liberace estate and head of the Liberace foundation.
   ``I was told by Dr. (Ronald) Daniels after the will signing the
condition that Mr. Liberace had,'' Strote testified Monday.
   He did not elaborate on what he was told.
   Strote said Liberace was ``very concerned about privacy'' as
rumors surfaced months before his death that he was suffering from
AIDS.
   ``Mr. Liberace didn't want anyone to know how sick he was,''
Strote said. He said secrecy was a key when Liberace was admitted
to Eisenhower Hospital in Palm Springs, Calif., in late January
1987 for blood transfusions.
   Strote testified he had drawn up wills for Liberace prior to the
one that was drafted in mid-January and signed by the entertainer
Jan. 22, 1987. That will left Strote in charge of the estate.
   Under cross-examination, the attorney testified the previous
wills had precluded him from appointing himself as executor.
   Earlier Monday, an accountant testified that Liberace's sister,
Angie, one of the five plaintiffs in the case, has been paid nearly
$132,000 since his death and has $511,000 left in her trust account.
   The testimony conflicted with that given last week by Angie
Liberace, 74, who described herself as ``penniless.''
   The sister and four former associates are seeking to have Strote
removed, saying Liberace was too ill to comprehend what he was
doing when he signed the documents drafted by Strote.

<HEAD>Audiences Not Tempted By Traditional Religious Films</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN HORN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>HOLLYWOOD (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Biblical film epics were once a staple of
Hollywood's success formula, but in recent years they haven't had a
prayer at the box office.
   So judging from the phenomenal start of ``The Last Temptation of
Christ,'' the controversy surrounding the film looks like manna
from heaven for Universal Pictures.
   Straightforward religious films, like Westerns, are failing to
attract the viewers they did in the days of Cecil B. DeMille's
``The Ten Commandments,'' William Wyler's ``Ben Hur'' and George
Stevens' ``The Greatest Story Ever Told.'' They garnered huge
audiences in the 1950s and early '60s.
   In 1985, ``King David,'' a big-budget saga starring Richard
Gere, bombed. Two years later, ``The Mission,'' featuring Robert
DeNiro and themes strongly endorsed by Christian leaders, also
flopped.
   But director Martin Scorsese's ``Last Temptation,'' denounced as
blasphemous by some Christian leaders, opened to packed houses last
weekend. It played in seven U.S. cities and two in Canada, taking
in $44,579 per screen for a three-day total of $401,211, a jubilant
Universal Pictures reported.
   ``I think if `The Mission' came out 10-12 years ago, it would
have received a larger general audience,'' said Tim Penland,
president of Penland Productions, specializing in the marketing of
Christian films. ``Had the film not been perceived as a religious
epic, it could have done better business.''
   Part of the problem, Penland said, is that today's moviegoers
tend to avoid films that have overt religious messages.
   Another sign of the times: Evangelist Billy Graham is quietly
retrenching from his effort to use film as a tool for spreading a
spiritual message.
   Even as ``Last Temptation'' is drawing big crowds to see a story
about a Jesus plagued by human doubt, Graham is shutting down the
Burbank studios of his religious film production company,
considered the world's largest.
   ``Our (movie) attendance has not been what Hollywood would
consider to be large,'' said Paul Kurtz, director of distribution
and operations for Graham's Worldwide Pictures Inc.
   Worldwide's Burbank production studio was shut in May, a move
brought on by tight finances. More than a dozen employees were laid
off, Kurtz said. Only one employee remains in the offices.
   Kurtz added that some of the studio's duties will be assumed at
Graham headquarters in Minneapolis. The Burbank production site
will soon be put up for sale and no plans for another Worldwide
feature film are in the offing.
   Worldwide, instead, will devote its filmmaking energies to
low-budget films for showings in churches, prisons and nursing
homes, Kurtz said.
   Started in the 1950s, Worldwide was envisioned by Graham as a
modern proselytizing tool.
   The idea sometimes worked.
   Worldwide's ``The Hiding Place,'' a 1975 inspirational movie on
Dutch Christians sheltering Jews in World War II, did respectable
business and received satisfactory reviews.
   But ``Caught,'' a 1987 Worldwide release about a boy looking for
life's answers in Amsterdam, was a commericial failure and was
panned. The film, starring Jill Ireland, stopped at U.S. theaters
only briefly and is scheduled for an October release in Canada.
   Worldwide's dwindling fortunes are not isolated.
   ``Going to see a religious film is not high on anybody's list,
especially when you see how many films are out there for theatrical
release,'' Penland said. ``No matter how much they (Worldwide)
tried to hide it, audiences saw their films as extensions of Billy
Graham.
   ``I think we've reached a period (in religious filmmaking) where
to attract an audience, we have to have mainstream appeal.''

   Stock prices dipped Tuesday on the Tokyo Stock
Exchange while the dollar inched up against the Japanese yen.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues, the exchange's
main index, declined 4.74 points, or 0.02 percent, to close at
27,896.55 points.
   The dollar, which opened at 133.20 yen, moved in a range of
133.00-133.27 yen, and finished the day's trade at 133.08, up 0.13
yen.
   Securities dealers said the decline in the Tokyo market was
primarily due to a 33-point decline in the Dow Jones industrial
average in New York overnight.
   ``In very thin trading, share prices are lower across the
board,'' said a dealer at a major Tokyo securities firm, speaking
anonymously. ``This is because of unfavorable factors in New York
and the U.S. trade report scheduled to come out soon.''
   Trading on the first section of the exchange was a low 260
million shares.
   Dealers also said they expect no major shifts until the release
of the U.S. trade report for June, scheduled for Tuesday in
Washington.

<TEXT>
   The Justice Ministry today prohibited
14 relatives of former President Chun Doo-hwan from leaving the
country while the government investigates alleged corruption by
Chun and his family.
   The travel ban followed a resolution passed Aug. 4 by a special
National Assembly committee in a move to force the former president
to testify about corruption under his administration.
   Ministry officials said Chun and his wife were excluded from the
travel ban as they deserved due courtesy. Chun left office in
February at the end of a seven-year term.
   Among Chun's 14 relatives subject to the ban were Chun's two
brothers, a father-in-law and several brothers-in-law and their
wives. All 14 are under investigation for alleged corruption.
   The opposition has denounced Chun and his family over
allegations of widespread corruption and financial scandals. Chun's
younger brother, Chun Kyong-hwan, is on trial on charges of
embezzling millions of dollars in his former position as head of a
rural development group.
   The opposition wants the ex-president to testify before the
opposition-controlled assembly about the allegations, but President
Roh Tae-woo's governing party opposes the idea.
   A former army general, Roh played a key role in helping Chun
seize power with military backing in 1980. Roh won election in
December last year over divided opposition candidates.
   Chun's wife, Lee Soon-ja, and her family have been under public
fire for alleged influence-peddling and corruption during her
husband's administration.
   Also today, Roh's governing party proposed a parliamentary probe
of allegations that Chun's family sent fortunes to the United
States and Australia. The opposition rejected the offer, contending
it was intended to divert public attention abroad.

<TEXT>
   As Ronald Reagan urged George Bush to ``Win
one for the Gipper'' in November, Joe Unangst raised his sweating
beer can with an aging athlete's bravado.
   ``Punchline,'' Unangst yelled toward a television at Mother's, a
50-year-old eatery at Tchoupitoulas and Poydras streets that
proclaims the coldest beer and the world's best baked ham.
   He took a long, loud sip, then professed gridiron kinship with
the former Eureka College player whose exhortation to Bush mimicked
a line from one his movies.
   ``I played football, too,'' Unangst said. ``Touchdown! Great
speech.''
   Mother's is about a dozen blocks from the Louisiana Superdome,
where Reagan's emotional farewell was cheered Monday night by
delegates to the Republican National Convention.
   The fuzzy presidential image came from a small television set,
rigged high on a wall between a velvet toy elephant head and a sign
that warned, ``Caution: Men Drinking.''
   Reagan's goodbye played to a near-empty house at Mother's
``because all the Republicans are still up the street,'' said owner
Jerry Amato.
   Amato was braced for a crush of convention visitors after the
nightly session ended. Cooks popped pans of biscuits into the oven,
and chopped vegetables for the anticipated late diners.
   For now, Amato could relax at a table near the front door,
puffing a long brown cigar and philosophizing about politics.
   ``Me, I'm not political. Not in the party sense _ `I vote this
way or that way.' I'll just walk in the booth and pull the lever,
maybe Republican, maybe for the Democrats,'' he said.
   ``But I don't mind watching the speech, although we've been
seeing nothing but Republicans,'' Amato said with a laugh.
``Besides, there's really nothing else on television.''
   ``A beer and Reagan _ what could be more fun than this?'' said
customer Lee Bordelon as he dug into a bowl of ham and cabbage.
   But Mother's bartender Jack Landry was reverent.
   A former Marine who saw Pacific combat in World War II, he
confessed to emotional twinges every time Reagan talks patriotism.
   ``Same thing tonight,'' said Landry, 64. ``It's very touching.
It goes right through me. It makes me proud to be an American.''
   How will he vote?
   ``It was the Democrats that sent me to war, not the Republicans.
But who knows? I'll decide election day,'' Landry said.
   The door swung open and in walked the first post-session diners,
easily identified by credentials dangling from their necks.
   It was back to business at Mother's.

<HEAD>`Ain't Misbehavin'' Struts Back to Broadway</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: ADDS 6 grafs with other critics; No PMs Planned</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By MARY CAMPBELL</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   ``Ain't Misbehavin''' is back on Broadway with
the same bright cast and even more uninhibited gusto than it had 10
years ago.
   The revue of songs that Fats Waller composed or turned into hit
records opened at the Ambassador Theater on Monday night. It's
infectious, high-energy, spirited entertainment.
   The bright cast of five singers, their movements by
choreographer Arthur Faria carefully rehearsed, give the show a
real team feeling. But, like a decade ago, it's Nell Carter, with
her Ethel Merman-like vocal attack, who's the home-run hitter.
   When she sings ``Ow,'' to start ``I've Got a Feeling I'm
Falling,'' it's with the sharp surprise of someone who's just been
stuck with a pin. The audience breathes out in delighted response.
She also stopped the show with her brash ``Cash for Your Trash''
and vulnerable ``Mean to Me.''
   The singers look like they're having fun. There's a mischievous
sexiness to Armelia McQueen's giggly singing of Waller's ``Squeeze
Me,'' and to Ken Page and Miss Carter's rendition of ``Honeysuckle
Rose.''
   Charlaine Woodard chooses sweet, demure vocal delivery for
``Keepin' Out of Mischief Now.'' As the other two women appear to
have lost no weight in 10 years, Miss Woodard seems not to have
gained any.
   Page, who was Old Deutertonomy in the original Broadway cast of
``Cats,'' makes the most of the jolliest of the novelty songs,
``Your Feet's Too Big.'' Singer-dancer Andre De Shields is snakily
sinuous in ``The Viper's Drag.''
   Luther Henderson, who did the musical arrangements when ``Ain't
Misbehavin''' started at the off-Broadway Manhattan Theater Club
and was the first pianist on Broadway, played on-stage piano. Six
other musicians were across the back of the stage.
   Thomas ``Fats'' Waller, stride pianist, composer, singer and
movie performer, was born in Harlem in 1904 and died on an
eastbound train from Los Angeles in 1943. Richard Maltby Jr.
directed the show of his music and the Shubert Organization,
Emanuel Azenberg, Dasha Epstein and Roger Berlind produced.
   ``Ain't Misbehavin''' won a Tony Award in 1978 as best musical
and ran for three years. The original singers stayed in it for nine
months. This time, they spent two months on the road and came to
Broadway for a limited engagement, through November.
   Delights of ``Ain't Misbehavin''' aren't confined to solos.
There's the brassy, nearly naughty ``Find Out What They Like'' by
Miss McQueen and Miss Carter, the shim sham danced by the three
women, the ensemble's ``Lounging at the Waldorf'' and ``The Joint
Is Jumpin'.'' It sure is.
   In other reviews:
   Howard Kissel of the Daily News wrote that this revival lacks
the restraint of the original production. ``This time, the show
seems less an ensemble performance, more like a series of star
turns. ...
   ``Even with its lapses, `Ain't Misbehavin'' is, for sheer
entertainment, the best value on Broadway.''
   In The New York Times, Frank Rich, wrote: ```Ain't Misbehavin' '
is so torrid that it may be the only place in town where you feel
happy to be hot. ...
   ``What's even more impressive about the revival is how little it
seems like a rehash. ... The original on and off stage artists have
returned not only in force but in high gear as well.''
   The New York Post's Marilyn Stasio called it ``a bona-fide
recreation of the spirit and the artistry that made the show such a
joy the first time around.''

<TEXT>
   A time bomb believed planted by Tamil
rebels exploded in a crowd of office-goers in the eastern port city
of Trincomalee today, killing at least six people and injuring 10,
military officials said.
   All the victims were believed to be government employees on
their way to work, said officials at Colombo's military command.
The officials cannot be identified under briefing rules.
   The explosion occurred at the city's busy Clock Tower area,
where many government employees disembark from city buses, the
officials said.
   Most of the government employees reporting for work in the city
belong to the Sinhalese community. Tamils refused to work for the
government after a Sinhalese mob killed three members of their
community in the city on July 21.
   Last week, authorities ordered all employees to report to work
and promised them maximum protection. But the rebels challenged the
order and warned government staff against complying.
   Tamils comprise 18 percent of Sri Lanka's 16 million people but
are in a majority in the island's north and east. Tamil radicals
have been agitating for an independent homeland since 1983,
claiming discrimination by the Sinhalese, who comprise 75 percent
of the population.

<HEAD>Prime Minister Expresses Regret To American Blacks</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita has sent a letter
to black U.S. lawmakers expressing regret for a Japanese
politician's degrading remarks about American blacks, a Foreign
Ministry official said today.
   Takeshita said in a letter to Rep. Mervyn Dymally, chairman of
the Congressional Black Caucus, that he was ``saddened that a
recent event has hurt our friends in the United States,'' according
to the ministry official, who read excerpts of the letter.
   ``It is regrettable a misunderstanding arose,'' Takeshita wrote,
adding that there is no justification for racial discrimination.
   ``I hope to make the partnership between our two countries even
stronger,'' Takeshita wrote. ``America is a great country made up
of numerous ethnic groups, and I want to work hard to heighten
Japanese people's awareness of this.''
   The letter was delivered Friday to Dymally, D-Calif., through
the U.S. Embassy in Tokyo.
   Takeshita's message was sparked by a letter from Dymally
complaining of remarks by Michio Watanabe, policy chief of the
governing Liberal Democratic Party, and calling on the prime
minister to clarify Japan's position toward U.S. minorities.
   Watanabe said at a Liberal Democratic Party seminar last month
that American blacks have few qualms about going bankrupt and
implied they walk away from their debts.
   He quickly apologized for his comments, but anger built up in
the U.S. Congress and public over what were seen as racist remarks.
   Two years ago, then Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone stirred a
similar controversy when he said the overall U.S. intelligence rate
was brought down by the large numbers of blacks, Mexicans and
Puerto Ricans living in the country.
   Nakasone later apologized for his comments.

<HEAD>Armenian Expelled From Soviet Union Vows to Continue Struggle</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mikhail Gorbachev's policy of ``glasnost'' is
just a gimmick in the eyes of an Armenian activist who was expelled
from the Soviet Union.
   Paruyr Ayrikyan called the policy of openness, ``cosmetics'' and
``an enterprise to make the Soviet Union look nicer than it is. ...
In general, there is still a one-party system.''
   And he vowed to stay in the United States to rally support for
his cause until he can return home.
   Ayrikyan was stripped of his Soviet citizenship and expelled
from the country on July 21. Last week, a high-ranking Soviet legal
official said Ayrikyan's appeal to be readmitted, filed at the
Soviet consulate in Paris, was not being taken seriously.
   In an interview here Monday, Ayrikyan said he does not expect to
be allowed to return home soon. He denounced the terms of his
ejection and vowed to ask governments and private groups for
financial and political support for Armenian rights in the Soviet
Union.
   The 39-year-old former translator said he would ask Congress for
money to maintain an office and cover printing costs, and seek to
bring U.S. pressure on Soviet officials.
   ``The Soviet government respects only a position of strength,''
he said, speaking through an interpreter.
   As for his own case, he said he has written a letter asking U.S.
officials ``to raise this question on an international level,
particularly at the international conference on human rights in
Geneva and in your meetings with the U.S.S.R., so that this illegal
decision (will) be overturned and that I (will) be allowed the
right to return to the U.S.S.R.''
   Ayrikyan said he would be Soviet Armenians' representative in
the United States, and hoped ``to regularly communicate with the
government in such a capacity.'' Although he said he did not expect
to be formally recognized as a diplomat, ``de facto, I am in such a
position.''
   The Armenian activist was arrested in March for his part in
spreading word to Western journalists about the Armenian campaign
to have a mostly Armenian region of the neighboring Soviet republic
of Azerbaijan made part of Soviet Armenia.
   Ethnic rioting killed at least 35 people in Azerbaijan after
Armenians launched the annexation campaign in February.
   Although Ayrikyan was not a leader of the uprising, he has been
a subject of popular support, and after his arrest many
demonstrators made his release one of their demands.
   Ayrikyan said that within the week he would move to Los Angeles.
   Asked why he thought he was forced into exile, he said, ``They
were planning to try me and they realized it was impossible because
of broad public support for me. They realized they couldn't try me,
they couldn't release me, so they decided to exile me.''

<TEXT>
   A special state grand jury has voted to subpoena
Tawana Brawley, the black teen-ager who says she was raped by
whites but refuses to cooperate with an investigation, a newspaper
reported today.
   The vote, against the advice of Attorney General Robert Abrams,
was taken last week in Poughkeepsie but was not announced, said The
New York Times.
   The Rev. Al Sharpton, a Brawley family spokesman, said Miss
Brawley will continue her refusal to cooperate with the grand jury.
   ``We may decide to let her be serviced (with a subpoena) and
then fight,'' Sharpton said, adding that he would hold a news
conference today to discuss Brawley family options.
   The subpoena requires Abrams to draw up a court order directing
the 16-year-old to testify before the grand jury, the Times said.
   Miss Brawley and her family's advisers have sought to rally
public opinion against what they contend is a racially motivated
cover-up by officials protecting the alleged assailants. As a
result, Gov. Mario Cuomo appointed Abrams as a special prosecutor
for the case.
   The grand jury has been trying since February to learn why Miss
Brawley was found last November in a plastic bag, smeared with
excrement and racial epithets after a four-day disappearance. She
said she had been raped repeatedly by five or six white men, at
least one with a police-type badge.
   Sharpton challenged Abrams to ``make a kite out of his subpoena
and I'll provide the string.
   ``They certainly set up a situation for a confrontation and we
may take them up on it,'' Sharpton added. ``It looks like every
time we think it's boiling down, they make a move.''
   Miss Brawley is out-of-state with her mother, Glenda Brawley,
who was subpoenaed but refused to testify, causing her to be
sentenced to 30 days in jail. She has avoided jail by first staying
in churches and later leaving the state.

<HEAD>Networks Feel Used and Abused, but Find Veepstakes Fascinating</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BARR</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The networks felt used, abused and manipulated
by George Bush's vice presidential mystery tour, but they found it
far more interesting than most of what went on at the Republican
National Convention on Monday night.
   When dealing with another piece of manipulated media _ a
laudatory film about President Reagan _ the networks found it easy
to turn away. CBS and ABC chopped up the film into news reports,
while NBC filled the time with a taped interview of Nancy Reagan
and belatedly tuned in for the end of the film.
   Vice presidential trial balloons filled the airwaves Monday
night, as likely candidates traipsed through the network booths or
were tracked down by floor reporters.
   No one seemed more unhappy about this than the ABC crew, which
vigorously pursued vice-presidential speculation and self-promotion
for almost all of the first hour.
   The point of the vice-presidential secret, as the Bush campaign
freely admits, is to hype TV ratings _ ``and to do that by keeping
us talking about the running mate. So far it seems to be working,''
reporter Brit Hume complained earlier in the evening on ABC's
``World News Tonight.''
   ``In other words, Brit, an exercise in manipulating the media,''
anchor Peter Jennings said.
   ``Indeed, Peter, and I have to say, I think we are being
manipulated,'' Hume said.
   And, as David Letterman says, we all know how painful that can
be.
   CBS anchor Dan Rather made the same point in passing, calling
the vice presidential secret the ``orchestrated, manipulated
mystery of this convention.''
   NBC opened its prime-time coverage with an interview of Sen. Dan
Quayle of Indiana, while CBS started with a report from Diane
Sawyer that the big announcement might come Wednesday, instead of
Thursday as promised.
   NBC grilled Sen. Pete Domenici of New Mexico, who then turned
around and chatted with CBS.
   If Elizabeth Dole has hopes for the vice-presidential
nomination, she didn't get much help. Only CBS tuned in on her
speech to the convention, but all three networks welcomed her
husband, Sen. Bob Dole, into their booths to boost his candidacy.
   NBC's Tom Brokaw noted later in the evening that Dole seemed to
have shot himself in the foot by complaining to home state
reporters that Bush's selection process was ``demeaning.''
   Rep. Jack Kemp managed to get his speech on ABC and NBC, while
CBS filled that time talking to Sen. Gordon Humphrey of New
Hampshire about why he wanted Kemp to be the vice presidential
nominee.
   NBC's John Chancellor added some puzzling background to this
media flurry. Both Jimmy Carter in 1976 and Ronald Reagan in 1980
waited until the last day to pick their running mates, Chancellor
said, and they won, while Walter Mondale announced his choice in
advance, and lost.
   The pursuit of the big tease reached comic proportions when Bush
was detected talking on the telephone with Lee Atwater, his
campaign manager. NBC and CBS were there first, poking microphones
at Atwater, then at Texas Gov. Bill Clements and Sen. Phil Gramm as
they passed the phone around.
   Donaldson was last on the scene, and nearly fell over a row of
chairs thrusting his microphone at the telephone. Then he tried to
grab the phone.
   ``Sam, for once in your life cool it a minute,'' barked Atwater,
who clearly enjoyed the scene.
   Atwater then said that Bush would, indeed, announce his choice
on Thursday.
   ``The vice president is teasing us, trying to keep the nation
watching,'' Donaldson complained.
   None of the networks bit on the 20-minute Reagan film.
   ABC's Jeff Greenfield, who used parts of the film for a report
on the Reagan image, noted that most of this film was scavenged
from Reagan's 1984 film. The only images from the second term, he
noted, were Reagan with Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev and a short
scene of Reagan lecturing Congress about its budget methods.
   CBS correspondent Bill Plante also cut up the film for a news
report while delegates watched the whole film _ which was available
to television audiences on Cable News Network and C-SPAN.

<HEAD>Thousands Of Flood Victims Expected To Die Because Of Dirty Water</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DIDRIKKE SCHANCHE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Thousands of peasant adults and children
forced to drink dirty water because of widespread flooding are
expected to die of water-borne epidemics, a U.N. health official
says.
   Incidents of malaria, typhoid and cholera have been on the rise
since flooding earlier this month left 1.5 million people homeless,
Dr. Nicholas Ward, a World Health Organization adviser on diarrheal
diseases and immunization, said Monday.
   ``If some infected person is passing cholera into the water that
his community drinks, every person in that community can get very
sick very quickly,'' he told reporters at WHO offices in Khartoum.
   Ward predicted 400,000 people, most of them under age 5, will
develop diarrhea and other gastrointestinal diseases, and 4,000 of
them will die.
   Left untreated, as many as 40,000 people could perish, said
Ward, who came to Sudan from his base in North Yemen to help
coordinate the government's response to the health crisis.
   The government has recruited 300 extra doctors and medical
students for about 120 emergency clinics and increase staff at 127
already-existing health units, he said.
   Non-governmental relief organizations, including the Sudanese
Red Crescent, the Sudanese Council of Churches and the Islamic Arab
Relief Agency, also have organized dozens of health clinics in
squatter camps ringing Khartoum.
   The sprawling settlements of mud huts and papyrus and burlap
lean-tos were hardest hit by the deluge that destroyed 167,000
homes and killed at least 58 people, according to government
figures.
   The more than 500,000 people living in the camps _ mostly
peasants who fled drought and civil war in southern Sudan _ also
are threatened by epidemic.
   The government, seeking to discourage the settlements, forbids
squatters to dig wells. Consequently, they must either beg for
water or buy it from people who transport it from the distant Nile
River on donkey-drawn carts.
   Since the floods, the price of water has soared to as much as $5
per 1.3-gallon jug, 10 times its value before the deluge.
   Those unable to pay the price have been forced to drink water
from the huge, brackish pools left behind by the rainstorm and
contaminated by excreta floating up from swamped pit latrines.
   Dr. Afaf Ahmed Yahya, health coordinator for the Red Crescent,
said the organization's 23 health clinics each have been reporting
150 or more cases of diarrhea and gastrointestinal diseases a day
since the floods.
   Diarrhea kills the young and the weak through dehydration, and
rehydration salts are the main therapy given patients, she said.
   ``But if you want to rehydrate people, you have to provide clean
water,'' Yahya said.
   Nearly 100 cargo planes carrying emergency aid, including water
tanks, have arrived since the floods, but distribution of relief
supplies has been slow.
   Non-government agencies this weekend began distributing tents,
blankets, food, and other supplies. But most of the needy have yet
to be reached.
   In Geneva, the International Red Cross said relief efforts are
being expanded to cover 200,000 people and appealed for further
donations of emergency supplies.
   More than 100 tons of supplies have been airlifted into
Khartoum, and international donors have contributed about $950,000
following an Aug. 9 appeal by the Red Cross.
   Many roads were made impassable by the rains and some
settlements left isolated and unreachable by huge lakes of
knee-high water.
   The lack of telecommunications knocked out by the rains further
hampers coordination of the relief effort.
   While the sun steadily evaporates the remaining vast pools, more
rains have been forecast into September, posing a further threat to
the swollen Nile already dangerously brimming near street level in
Khartoum.

<HEAD>Government To Stop Banks Handling Guerrilla Funds</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL WEST</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's government
plans new laws to stop banks from handling funds of the IRA,
Protestant paramilitaries and other guerrilla groups in Northern
Ireland.
   The government also intends to set up a special force to combat
guerrilla racketeering in the strife-torn British province.
   The plans were outlined in a letter Mrs. Thatcher sent to the
Rev. Martin Smyth, a legislator from the province's largest
Protestant party, the Official Unionists. Her 10 Downing St. office
made the contents of the letter available to reporters on Monday.
   Mrs. Thatcher said in the letter that planned statutes will
prohibit banks, other financial institutions, accountants and
financial advisers from handling the funds of guerrilla groups and
empower the government to seize the assets of convicted guerrillas.
   The letter says the government also plans to set up a special
force to combat extortion and fund-raising rackets by the mainly
Roman Catholic Irish Republican Army and rival Protestant
organizations. It described the planned new force as a
``purpose-designed, administrative, anti-racketeering body.''
   British press reports said the new force will involve customs
and tax officers and the Department of Social Security.
   The Republic of Ireland passed legislation in 1985 enabling the
Dublin government to seize money suspected of being used by the
IRA, which is outlawed on both sides of the Irish border.
   The IRA is fighting to end British rule in Northern Ireland. It
wants to unite the predominantly Protestant province with the
overwhelmingly Catholic Republic of Ireland under socialist rule.
   Mrs. Thatcher's letter was in response to complaints by Smyth
that her government wasn't taking tough enough measures to combat
the IRA and other outlawed organizations.
   Racketeering is widespread in Northern Ireland.
   The British news and current affairs magazine The Listener this
year said protection rackets on construction sites in Northern
Ireland plus cash collected from stores, bars, taxis and clubs
netted guerrillas on both sides of the sectarian divide an
estimated $51 million a year.
   It said 95 percent of construction sites in the province's
capital Belfast are involved in protection rackets. It said the
standard charge per site demanded by racketeers is an initial
$5,100 plus up to $680 a week.

<TEXT>
   A federal bankruptcy judge ordered 108-year-old
Bishop College closed after it failed to come up with the $1.85
million needed to cover its 1988-89 deficit.
   Judge Robert C. McGuire on Monday ordered Bishop's 16-month-old
reorganization under Chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy code
coverted to Chapter 7, involuntary bankruptcy.
   School officials agreed, but reserved the right to move the case
back to Chapter 11 if $2 million could be raised quickly.
   Despite frantic fund-raising efforts during the past year,
including T-shirt sales outside the federal courthouse Monday
afternoon, officials of the predominantly black school failed to
get the funds McGuire said was needed by the hearing.
   Bishop's attorney, Glover Roberts, said the school's best hope
was financial and administrative support of local business leaders.
   ``I think there are some discussions going on along those
lines,'' Roberts said, but added he didn't know who, if anyone,
would come forward with the money.
   ``You have an institution that has a particular kind of heritage
and that has done a particular kind of job in preparing for
participation in the culture that has been lost,'' said Rev.
William Shaw, chairman of Bishop's board of trustees.
   Bishop, with academic specialties in religion and education, was
the only predominantly black school in Dallas.
   ``I think there is a real need for Bishop College in the Dallas
area,'' Mayor Annette Strauss said. ``I hope it can be reorganized
at a later time. It's a good school. It serves a good purpose.''
   Security guards Monday evening turned away visitors to the
school's unmowed, boarded-up campus.
   George McElreath, the federal bankruptcy trustee overseeing the
case, said attorneys told him this weekend that donations had
increased to about $7,000 per day during the past few weeks, ``but
that's not enough.''
   After the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools revoked
the college's accreditation because of the financial difficulties,
Bishop officials filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in
April 1987. Bishop had since tried to pay off an estimated $18
million in debts.
   The college was founded in Marshall in 1881 and moved to Dallas
in 1961. It has been troubled by financial problems and declining
enrollment for a decade.
   Enrollment peaked at 1,500 in 1967 and dropped to about 300
students last spring.
   ``It's a sad day,'' Bishop senior Wayne E. Croomes said. ``I was
hoping something positive would come out of it. It's time for me to
move on, go to another school.''

<HEAD>Bring A Bankroll To Let The Good Times Roll</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Throwing exclusive parties at exotic
locations during the Republican National Convention means forking
over a bankroll before the good times can roll.
   For example, it costs $5,000 to rent the New Orleans Museum of
Art for two hours. But don't use that ``R'' word around Mary Liz
Keevers.
   ``We prefer to say donation, instead of rent,'' said Ms.
Keevers, spokeswoman for the 1912 museum, scene of elaborate bashes
during the four-day convention.
   Food, drinks and entertainment are extra.
   Museum donors on Monday were the Eagle Forum, a conservative
group headed by activist Phyllis Schlafly, and the Republican
Senatorial Inner Circle, whose membership fee is a $1,000
contribution to elect GOP senators.
   Today's museum agenda included a reception and banquet for the
Conservative Victory Committee, chaired by former Delaware Gov.
Pete du Pont.
   Women in frilly hoop skirts greeted Eagle Forum guests, who
hailed Republican celebrities such as Rep. Jack Kemp of New York,
former United Nations Ambassador Jeane Kirkpatrick, and former
federal Judge Robert Bork, an unsuccessful nominee for the Supreme
Court.
   The VIPs were presented with four-faced clocks, which Mrs.
Schlafly said would keep them on time as they travel cross-country
in support of the party's ticket.
   Later in the evening, the senatorial shindig provided masks of
purple, green and gold _ the officials colors of Mardi Gras _ for
about 1,000 guests, some in colorful costumes.
   ``The ladies get a kick out of these.'' Washington-based party
consultant Wendy Pangburn said as she distributed the masks. ``The
men seem to try to put them in their pockets.''
   Arriving dignitaries were met by an 18-foot-high trailer-mounted
King Kong that customarily travels in Mardi Gras parades. Next to
it was a 12-foot cartoon alligator on wheels, wearing a red necktie
and holding, appropriately, a money bag.
   Four elephant float decorations flanked the wide marble entrance
steps. A pair of beefeater mannequins, also borrowed from a float,
were silent sentries next to red and white striped guardhouses.
   Inside, workers trimmed a sweeping central staircase dominated
by a portrait of Marie Antoinette to fit the Mardi Gras theme.
   Caterer Brian Huber fretted that delegates might burn out on
plentiful Creole and Cajun food. ``And they've only been here a
couple of days. So I'm changing tonight's menu,'' he said.
   Out with gumbo and jambalaya. Huber's Panache Caterers prepared
stir-fried chicken and peanuts, pasta topped with spicy ham, and
fried pork rinds.
   He swore pork skins were on the menu before Vice President
George Bush declared they were a favorite snack. ``But we are
serving more of them,'' Huber said.
   Huber's company is catering for 14,000 people during five days.
``Tonight's a slow evening _ only 1,500 to cook for,'' he said.
   But don't ask about price: ``If I said how much I'd be killed,''
Huber said. ``But this senatorial thing is a relatively elaborate
party. And I can't say we are doing any low-budget ones.''

   More than 10,000 people came to St. John
Neumann Catholic Church hoping for a miracle, and after a dramatic
evening Mass during the Feast of the Assumption, most weren't
disappointed.
   Shortly after Monday's mass began, some worshipers gasped and
pointed skyward. Others looked and began shouting, ``It's Jesus,
look!''
   As the excitement brought the Mass to a halt, scores of pilgrims
cried and applauded, claiming to see apparitions of Jesus and the
Virgin Mary.
   ``I knew there would be a miracle, I just knew it,'' said Mamie
Fertitta of Beaumont, crying and pointing to the sky.
   She said the saw the sun pulsating and then saw Jesus.
   A dozen priests standing on a rooftop altar and 600 Eucharist
ministers turned their backs to the crowd to look at the sky and
wave. After minutes of silence, the pastor, Monsignor Joseph James,
facing the West where people were pointing, began to sing ``Amazing
Grace.''
   People in the audience whipped out cameras to photograph the
clouds and light.
   Paula Mitchell, 13, of Dallas, said she saw Jesus and Mary as
the sun burst through the clouds.
   Jesus ``had a grayish-white beard and he's got some kind of cape
on. Mary's wearing a crown,'' she said.
   ``I saw baby Jesus for an instant in the sky,'' said Koreth
Vargahese of Houston.
   For the estimated 12,000 people, the pilgrimage was prompted by
reports that a miracle would occur on Monday's Feast of the
Assumption, the day Catholics celebrate Mary's assumption into
Heaven.
   The charismatic parish has been the focus of national attention
after three parishioners began reporting receiving messages of
peace and hope from the Virgin Mary this spring.
   While many cried and pointed skyward, not everyone saw an
apparition in the sky.
   ``I didn't see anything, but some of the other priests did,''
said Deacon Joe Richard.
   Before the Mass, thousands streamed onto the church grounds
despite temperatures in the high 90s as busloads brought pilgrims
from around the country.
   Many of the worshipers were handicapped, who came seeking
healing.
   Rosaries were said throughout the day in Spanish, English,
French, Portuguese and Vietnamese.
   Lubbock Bishop Michael Sheehan had originally planned to preside
over the feast day Mass, but decided not to following the publicity
about the messages. He has urged people to treat the messages with
caution and has not endorsed the happenings at the church.

   Republicans drew a record-breaking 36,000
people to the opening night of their national convention,
surpassing turnout for all previous political conventions, party
officials said.
   ``From Day One, we've taken an inclusive approach to this
convention,'' Convention Manager Bill Phillips said after Monday
night's session. ``And tonight's record-breaking attendance
demonstrates the tremendous support for the current administration
and enthusiasm for the next.''
   The evening session in the Louisiana Superdome included an

   Connecticut Sen. Lowell P. Weicker Jr. kept
his cool on the steamy convention floor when he was heckled by a
young Republican conservative who accosted him for being ``a lib.''
   President Reagan had just finished his farewell speech to the
Republican National Convention on Monday when a young man pushed
through the crowd and said to Weicker, ``Why are you such a
liberal? You're in the wrong party.''
   Weicker, who enjoys his reputation as a party maverick, smiled
and asked the man his name and where he was from. The heckler
identified himself as George Urite of Springfield, Va., and said,
``You vote like a real lib.''
   ``I think it's nice, don't you?'' Weicker responded.
   ``No,'' Urite said. ``You're a real lib and you belong in the

<HEAD>Bush-North Buttons A Hit</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   If Vice President George Bush were to be
influenced by over-the-counter sales of certain political buttons
here, the nod for his running mate might go to former Marine Lt.
Col. Oliver L. North.
   The buttons in question feature Bush's name with various
potential vice presidential choices and their vendor keeps a
running tally of his sales, displaying a bar chart on a computer
screen mounted near his wares.
   As of early evening Monday the tally of sales _ and presumably
of choice _ stood as follows:
   _Senate Republican Leader Bob Dole of Kansas _ 7 percent.
   _Rep. Jack Kemp of New York _ 8 percent.
   _Former White House chief of staff Howard Baker _ 8 percent.
   _Former United Nations Ambassador Jeane Kirkpatrick _ 10 percent.
   _Former Transportation Secretary Elizabeth Dole _ 11 percent.
   Topping them all was North with 36 percent.

   The time allotted for her introduction of
Elizabeth Dole to the Republican National Convention on its opening
night might have been the most carefully orchestrated 133 seconds
of Theresa Esposito's life.
   ``Unbelievable,'' said Mrs. Esposito, a state legislator and
delegate who got the word about three weeks ago that she had been
chosen to introduce her fellow North Carolinian. Since then, she
has spent hours preparing for her prime-time speech, written to be
delivered in two minutes and 13 seconds.
   ``Is that precise or what?'' she said after a morning briefing
at the Louisiana Superdome. ``Whoever planned all this really did
their homework. They had everything mapped out, right down to the
colors I wear.''
   Her height and the strength of her voice were also matters of
utmost importance to convention planners, and she received
instructions about makeup and jewelry and had to learn to read from
a TelePrompter.
   Mrs. Esposito's speech extolling the former U.S. transportation
secretary for having ``set the pace for American women in public
service'' went off without a hitch.

   Former White House chief of staff Howard
Baker says that when people talk about him as a potential vice
presidential nominee, ``I feel somebody's trying to revoke my
parole.''
   Baker, who also served as a senator for Tennessee, said Monday
he managed to unload some heavy responsibility when he resigned as
White House chief of staff.
   He said he helped review a long list of potential running mates
for certain Republican nominee George Bush and told the vice
president he was not interested in the job.
   Baker said he and Bush also had discussed the Tennessean's
prospects of joining Bush on the ticket. ``We discussed it at some
length and he understands that I'm truly not interested,'' Baker
said.

<HEAD>Southern Baptist Break Said to Be First in the Nation</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BILOXI, Miss. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The leader of a breakaway Baptist church
says his new congregation is the first of what will be a growing
split between moderate and fundamentalist Southern Baptists.
   ``We have taken the first step,'' the Rev. Bill Jenkins said.
``We are the first church aligned with the Southern Baptist
Alliance that is not a part of the Southern Baptist Convention.''
   Alan Neely, executive director of the Southern Baptist Alliance
and a professor at Southeastern Baptist Theological Seminary in
Wake Forest, N.C., also said Jenkins may be the first U.S. case of
a pastor making a public break because of recent denominational
events.
   The Southern Baptist Alliance is a national group made up
primarily of moderate Baptists. Moderate members have dissented
publicly against the denomination's fundamentalist leaders. The
Southern Baptist Convention is the denominational unit that manages
the educational and missions programs of about 36,000 churches. It
is the nation's largest Protestant denomination and has an
estimated 15 million members.
   Jenkins resigned as pastor of Biloxi's Bay Vista Baptist Church
last month because of policy disagreements with Southern Baptist
Convention leadership.
   He said about a dozen Southern Baptist families met for services
in a rented Gulfport hall last week.
   Each Southern Baptist church operates autonomously. But the
churches finance national programs through the convention's boards
and agencies.
   Since 1979, fundamentalist-backed candidates have been elected
president of the convention. They have the power to influence the
appointment of trustees to convention boards and agencies.
   The new congregation, called Alliance Baptist Church, will issue
papers on theology and other church matters.
   ``The basic question is this: Will the real Baptist please stand
up? I believe that I am a real traditional Baptist,'' said Jenkins.
   Jenkins said his key points of disagreement with the Southern
Baptist Convention include inerrancy, or the literal interpretation
of the Bible.

<HEAD>Khmer Rouge Agrees To International Guarantees Against Its
Dominance</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER ENG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Khmer Rouge, the largest guerrilla
group fighting the Vietnamese in Cambodia, has declared support for
international guarantees to prevent it from abusing other groups in
post-war Cambodia.
   In a peace proposal, the movement that ruled Cambodia in a
three-year reign of terror until Vietnam invaded a decade ago, even
suggested it would reduce its army to the level of other factions
as part of a political settlement.
   The proposal, dated Monday and signed by nominal leader Khieu
Samphan, was broadcast over Khmer Rouge radio that day. A text was
obtained today from a Western embassy in Bangkok.
   The proposal was the group's most direct, unequivocal response
to widespread concerns that it may try to return to power once a
settlement to the nearly decade-old war is reached. It appeared to
put the Khmer Rouge's public position in line with views of its
guerrilla partners and the Asian and Western nations that back the
guerrillas.
   During its rule, the Khmer Rouge massacred hundreds of thousands
of people and devastated society and culture as leader Pol Pot
tried to impose radical communal agrarianism .
   Fears of its return have recently been fueled by Vietnam's
announced plans to withdraw some 50,000 troops, or half its force
in Cambodia, by the end of the year and its pledge of a total
pullout by early 1990.
   Some diplomats say the Khmer Rouge, which fields some 35,000
guerrillas, is storing arms for an all-out offensive in 1990.
   The Khmer Rouge proposal said that after a political settlement
is agreed to, an international conference should be convened to
find measures to guarantee the agreement and Cambodia's
independence, neutrality and territorial integrity.
   It said the conference should be attended by countries involved
in the conflict, the United Nations secretary-general and the
permanent members of the U.N. Security Council: China, France,
Great Britain, the Soviet Union, and the United States.
   The security council members should guarantee the agreement, it
said.
   The proposal said the conference should set up an international
body under either the United Nations or other international
committees, ``and adopt measures agreed upon by all four Cambodian
parties and countries attending the international conference to
ensure that (the Khmer Rouge) does not abuse other parties and that
other Cambodian parties do not abuse one another, and at the same
time to ensure that (Vietnam) cannot return to commit aggression
against Cambodia.''
   The four Cambodian parties are the Vietnamese-installed
government in Cambodia, and the Khmer Rouge and its non-communist
partners in a guerrilla coalition government: the forces of Prince
Norodom Sihanouk and of Son Sann.
   The proposal said that in the last phase of a Vietnamese
withdrawal, both the resistance government and Cambodia's
pro-Vietnamese government should be dissolved simultaneously.
   A provisional four-party government headed by Sihanouk then
would be formed to organize elections for a new government, it said.
   The armies of the four factions would be put in garrisons under
the control and supervision of a four-party Cambodian committee and
international auspices.
   The Khmer Rouge army is by far the most powerful of the four
factions.
   ``In the preliminary stage, a four-party Cambodian army should
be set up with each party having equal strength under a four-party
high command,'' the proposal said.
   ``In accordance with Cambodia's constitution promulgated by the
constitutional assembly, a single national army should be
restored.''
   The Khmer Rouge has been increasingly diplomatically isolated in
recent months, and parties attending unprecedented multilateral
peace talks last month in Indonesia agreed the withdrawal of
Vietnamese troops must be linked with measures to prevent the
return of Khmer Rouge practices.
   Cambodia's pro-Vietnamese government called at the talks for
``elimination'' of the Khmer Rouge's top leadership and dissolution
of its army. At the talks, the Khmer Rouge clashed bitterly with
the government and with Vietnam.
   Also attending the talks were the other guerrilla groups, and
the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, which has only recently
unequivocally stated that while it backed the guerrillas, it
favored measures to ensure the Khmer Rouge does not return to
power. ASEAN groups Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, the Philippines,
Singapore and Brunei.
   China, the Khmer Rouge's strongest supporter and main source of
arms, stated for the first time recently that it did not favor the
group's dominance in Cambodia.

   Thunderstorms brought heavy showers, hail and gusty winds to
much of the nation today but the rains promised little relief from
the scorching heat.
   In northwest Florida, heavy rains Monday night caused local
flooding but there were no reports of damage. In Binford, N.D., 1}
inches of rain fell and White Signel, N.M., reported almost 2
inches of rain early today.
   Seattle had its first measurable rainfall Monday since July 12 _
but it totaled just less than a tenth of an inch.
   Thunderstorms brought small hail with strong, gusty winds near
Hillsboro, Ohio. Hail and very heavy rain also were reported at
Carrington, N.D.
   Showers and thunderstorms continued into the morning through
Washington, New Mexico, northwest Texas, northern Florida, along
the southern Atlantic Coast, over northern North Carolina and from
northwest Minnesota and across North Dakota.
   High temperatures were forecast above normal from central New
England across Georgia, and west through the Plains. But
temperatures were forecast to be a little cooler than normal in
Maine, Florida, southern Texas, California, Oregon, Nevada,
Washington, Utah and western Montana.
   Today's forecast called for showers and thunderstorms from the
southern Atlantic coast across Florida and southern Mississippi,
the lower Texas Gulf coast and North Dakota.
   High temperatures were expected in the 90s or near 90 degrees
over much of the nation; in the 70s and 80s across much of New
England, the northern Apalachians,the lower Great Lakes, upper
Michigan, the northern Plateau, the Great Basin and the Pacific
coast, as well as scattered over the Rockies; near 100 degrees to
about 105 degrees from northern Texas across South Dakota and the
central half of the Mississippi Valley; and near 110 through the
desert Southwest.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 a.m. EDT ranged from 48
degrees at Yellowstone National Park, Wyo., to 91 degrees at
Phoenix, Ariz.

<TEXT>
   American-born Rabbi Meir Kahane, head of the
anti-Arab Kach Party, broke up his own news conference when he
refused to answer questions from a journalist because the reporter
represented German media.
   Most of the reporters who covered the news conference held in
Jerusalem Monday left in protest, Kahane's spokesman Gad Servitman
told The Associated Press.
   ``I understand them,'' he said. ``We have nothing against the
man personally, but it's been our longstanding policy not to give
information and not to talk to German media. We even refuse to use
German-made equipment in our offices.''
   Servitman said the boycott was to stress the German people's
responsibility for the World War II Holocaust, in which 6 million
Jews were killed by the Nazis.
   The reporter was identified as Jacques Ungar, a representative
of seven West German, Austrian and Swiss publications. He was not
in his office for comment.
   The Kach Party holds one seat _ Kahane's _ in Israel's
120-member Knesset, or Parliament, and advocates the expulsion of
the approximately 2.25 million Arabs living in Israel and the
occupied territories.

<HEAD>Zoo Director Lashes Out At Report About Hunger At Beijing Zoo</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The director of the country's largest zoo denies
a Chinese newspaper report that inflation has stopped his tigers
from eating live chicken and his elephants from munching bananas.
   Beijing Zoo director Feng Youlian was quoted in Tuesday's
edition of the Guangming Daily as saying his animals have ``never
known hunger.''
   He criticized an Aug. 8 report in the official, English-language
China Daily, that said the 3,000 animals, birds and fish at the zoo
have fallen on lean days because of inadequate funding and sharp
rises in food prices.
   The China Daily report said elephants were forced to eat carrots
instead of their favorite, bananas. And it said tigers, lions and
other carnivores were once treated twice weekly to a live chicken,
now feast on such delicacies only when they are sick.
   ``Even during the `three difficult years,' our animals have
never known hunger,'' Feng said, referring to a famine that hit
China from 1960 to 1963.
   ``Many animals at the zoo are presents from heads of foreign
countries and some are rare animals on the brink of extinction,''
he was quoted as saying. ``As a result, we can cut down on other
things but one thing that won't drop is the amount we spend on the
animals' food.''
   Inflation ``could affect some capital construction projects,''
Feng said, ``but never the stomachs of our beasts.''
   Feng said the zoo received $176,000 from the government for
non-staple foods in 1985. That figure jumped to $189,000 in 1987.
   He said that since 1965, the goverment's subsidy to the zoo has
grown 12 times although the number of animals has only doubled.
   In addition, he added, the zoo's entrance fee of 10 fen (less
than a nickel) has not been raised in 38 years.
   China is currently facing its highest inflation since 1949 when
the communist government was established. Prices in June of this
year were 19 percent higher than they were in the same period last
year.
   Non-staple food items, such as vegetables, fish and meat have
increased the most, some by as much as 60 percent over the past
year.
   Feng acknowledged that the China Daily report was correct in
saying that tigers, lions and other big cats were forced to fast
one day a week. But he said that policy has been in effect since
1954.
   ``Their stomach capacity is very large,'' zoo worker Zhang Gaopu
told the Guangming Daily. ``They can go without eating for several
days.''
   Feng also acknowledged that lately the zoo has been substituting
cheaper items for more expensive ones to save money.
   But, he said, ``if the more expensive food is the favorite food
of the animal, then we will guarantee that food no matter what the
cost.''

   Like her son George, Dorothy Walker Bush
shies from the intense media scrutiny that would throw her private
life open to public examination and dissection.
   The 87-year-old Mrs. Bush has a longstanding policy against
interviews, and even the vice president's plan to show off his
large clan at the Republican National Convention hasn't changed her
mind.
   ``She will be here this week. She won't be giving interviews,''
said Catherine Holt, a member of the Bush campaign staff.
   Nevertheless, insights into the personality of the likely GOP
nominee's mother can be found in recent comments and past articles
written by none other than George Bush.
   ``Every mother has her own style. My mother's was a little like
an Army drill sergeant's,'' the vice president wrote in a May 1985
Mother's Day article for the Greenwich (Conn.) Time.
   ``She had five of us to raise _ Pres (Prescott), myself, Nancy,
John and Bucky (William) _ and she just felt strongly that there
was too much for us to learn and to do to waste any time on chaos.
So we had very little chaos around our house,'' Bush said.
   A widow since the 1972 death of her husband, Prescott Bush Sr.,
Mrs. Bush lives in Greenwich, the wealthy New York City suburb
where son George attended schools as a youngster.
   In the article, Bush recalled the childhood tennis lessons given
by his mother.
   ``I can hear her now: `You can do it. You'll get it. You'll get
it.' And she would be patient and tireless and always absolutely
sure we would _ eventually _ get it.
   ``She also tamed our arrogance. I'll never forget years ago,
saying rather innocently, I thought, `I was off my game.' Mother
jumped all over me. `You are just learning _ you don't have a
game,''' Bush wrote.
   Recently, in a CBS News interview, the vice president was asked
which of his mother's qualities he tries to emulate.
   ``Gentleness, caring, sharing,'' Bush responded. ``She tried to
instill in us, through example, not through lecturing, a certain
kindness, concern for the other guy _ fairness is a word, I think.
   ``Competitive, tough ... I mean she could whip anybody in
anything,'' he said.
   If Bush succeeds in defeating Democratic nominee Michael
Dukakis, Mrs. Bush would be the 12th mother to see her son sworn in
as president, the first since January 1977 when Lillian Carter
witnessed her son Jimmy's inauguration.
   Miss Lillian became a celebrity in her own right in the Carter
years. That is not expected to happen with Dorothy Bush.

<TEXT>
   One of the surest ways to end up in a
dead-end job in the FBI is to be a Spanish-speaking Hispanic,
according to agents testifying in a discrimination suit against the
agency.
   ``I think the ability to speak Spanish in the FBI is a
tremendous liability,'' Special Agent Julian Perez testified Monday
before U.S. District Judge Lucius Bunton.
   The 311 agents who have joined the class-action lawsuit contend
the FBI discriminates against Hispanics in hiring, promotion and
discipline. The agents want damages and a change in FBI promotion
practices.
   The non-jury trial is expected to last two weeks with up to 100
witnesses expected to testify.
   Three Hispanic agents who testified Monday described the FBI as
an organization that shunts Spanish speakers into relatively menial
tasks as it promotes people who complete investigations and make
important arrests.
   ``What happens as a Spanish-speaking agent is, you might
initiate an investigation and have it going pretty well, but you're
pulled off,'' Perez testified. That usually happens because the
Hispanic agents are put on a temporary assignment requiring
Spanish, he said.
   Other agents who complete such investigations begun by Hispanic
agents end up getting the credit, Perez said.
   Non-Hispanic agents who speak Spanish don't have to deal with
the same problems, the agents testified.
   The lawsuit was filed in January 1987 by Bernardo ``Matt''
Perez, assistant special agent in charge at the El Paso office.
From 1979 to 1982, Matt Perez worked at the San Juan, Puerto Rico,
office _ a bureau considered an undesirable assignment because of
the island's high crime rate and isolation.
   The agents charged that Hispanics are routinely transferred to
Puerto Rico, sometimes punitively.
   FBI Personnel Director David Rarity Jr. testified that the
agency does not discriminate against Hispanics, and said more
Hispanic agents are transferred to Puerto Rico because they are
more likely to speak Spanish.
   Felipe Frocht, a special agent in San Jose, Calif., said his
association with the lawsuit has prompted superiors to threaten to
transfer him to Puerto Rico.
   Puerto Rico supervisory Special Agent Armando Lara testified
that he had been passed over for promotion nine times, and that the
FBI kept a dossier on his wife because the agency disapproved of
her opening the first rape crisis center in El Paso, when Lara was
stationed there in 1974.
   Lara said he was pressured into applying for a transfer to
Puerto Rico. After two months in San Juan, he was transferred to
the isolated city of Aguadilla on the island's northwest coast.
   After five years at Aguadilla, Lara was transferred to Gallup,
N.M., officially listed by the FBI as a hardship office because of
Gallup's isolation and low quality of life.

   Radical student leaders said today
they will not give up their anti-government struggle, but admitted
they failed to gain public support to share the Olympics Games with
communist North Korea.
   Leaders told 1,500 cheering supporters at Yonsei University in
Seoul they will continue pressing for reunification of the divided
Korean peninsula. They also said they will have to make a greater
effort to gain public support.
   ``We have to admit the road to unification is still too far and
there lie many difficulties ahead. Further struggle is called
for,'' said one student leader, Oh Yung-shik.
   Riot police blocked students who tried to march out of Yonsei
Monday to go the border truce site of Panmunjom for reunifiction
talks with North Korean student delegates.
   Police arrested about 2,000 students Monday who took part in
demonstrations in Seoul after breaking up the march with tear gas
and beating protesters. Most of the students were released after
receiving warnings.
   The government banned the march and the meeting with the North
Korean students as a threat to national security. A similar march
June 10 was blocked by police.
   The students, many of them from colleges around the nation, left
the college to return home after riot police surrounding the campus
withdrew.
   Today, new violence broke out at Sogang University when students
hurled firebombs and rocks at riot police after plainclothes police
staged a raid and arrested 10 students.
   The radical students back North Korea's demand to co-host the
Olympics that begin Sept. 17 in Seoul. The International Olympic
Committee has rejected the north's demand because the Games are
awarded to a single city.
   North Korea has said it will boycott the Games if it is not
allowed to co-host.
   The radicals, a small but powerful minority on campuses, have
failed to gain public support because of their violent tactics and
open advances to the communist north. Just a few thousand students
took part in demonstrations in various cities over the past week.
   Most South Koraens fear the north and believe it wants to
conquer the peninsula. North Korea invaded the south in 1950 to
start the Korean War, which ended three years later without a
political solution.

<HEAD>Turning In Child Abusers: More Talk than Action?</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Most people say they would report suspected
child abuse, but when confronted with it, only about a third do so,
a survey shows.
   The poll, published in September's Parents magazine, found that
of 1,008 adults questioned in nationwide telephone interviews, 11
percent said they knew someone they suspected of child abuse and 88
percent said they did not.
   Of those who suspected child abuse, 37 percent said they
contacted authorities, 34 percent said they did nothing, 21 percent
said they talked to the people involved and 5 percent took ``some
other action.''
   Of those did nothing, 55 percent explained they weren't sure if
they understood the situation well enough to know what was
happening.
   Others said it was none of their business, or they were
concerned about legal liability, offending someone, losing a friend
or suffering physical injury.
   Of those who said they did not know any abusive adults, 66
percent said they would contact police if they suspected child
abuse, 24 percent would talk to the people involved, 3 percent
would take other action and 7 percent were unsure.
   Asked if someone who witnesses child abuse but does nothing
should be held legally responsible, 47 percent of those polled said
yes, 38 percent said no and 15 percent were unsure.
   The margin of error was plus or minus 3 percentage points.

<HEAD>Policyholder Sues State Farm Over Campaign Contributions</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A motorist sued State Farm Mutual Insurance
Cos., demanding that the insurer stop spending policyholders' money
on an industry campaign to bring no-fault insurance to California.
   The suit, filed in state court Monday by Benjamin G. Barnes,
also asks that the company return to policyholders money already
contributed in support of the ballot issue.
   State Farm spokesman Jim Stahly said the contributions, which
amounted to $1.4 million through June, were a legitimate use of the
funds.
   ``It is our opinion that it is entirely proper for State Farm to
participate in elections in California,'' Stahly said.
   The insurance industry expects to spend up to $43 million
promoting the November ballot issue, spokesman have said.
   At a news conference announcing Barnes' suit, his attorney,
William Shernoff, was accompanied by a spokesman for the Insurance
Consumer Action Network, a Ralph Nader-affiliated group backing a
rival initiative that would cut rates 20 percent.
   State Farm is required under law to return any surplus to its
customers, the suit charges.
   The suit also alleges that the use of policyholders' premiums
violates First Amendment guarantees of free speech by, in effect,
forcing them to contribute to a political campaign against their
will.
   ``The point is that you don't use policyholder money on
political issues,'' Shernoff said.

<HEAD>Hess Burial Town Bars Protests on Anniversary of Death</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WUNSIEDEL, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Bavarian town where former
Nazi Deputy Fuehrer Rudolf Hess is buried today banned neo-Nazi
demonstrations on the anniversary of his death.
   Hess, who was serving a life sentence in West Berlin's Spandau
prison for war crimes, died Aug. 17 of last year at age 93.
Wunsiedel authorities said right-wing extremists gave notice they
planned to demonstrate Wednesday.
   ``We'd been told to expect between 500 to 1,000 right-wing
extremists,'' Wunsiedel district government chairman Christoph
Schiller said.
   ``Certainly they would have been handing out their neo-Nazi
information and shouting neo-Nazi slogans, like `Rudolf Hess was a
martyr,' '' Schiller added. ``And there would have been
disturbances.''
   Schiller said in a telephone interview a general ban on protests
would be in effect from midnight today until midnight Sunday.
Wunsiedel is located in northeastern Bavaria about 11 miles from
the Czechoslovak border.
   The district government chairman said a special police unit was
formed in case the protesters violate the ban on demonstrations.
   Within days of Hess' death last year, police in Wunsiedel
arrested more than 100 right-wing extremists and neo-Nazis who
converged on the town. Many wore neo-Nazi emblems and shouted
neo-Nazi slogans.
   Hess, once deputy to Nazi dictator Adolf Hitler, was the last
prisoner at Spandau, which was administered by World War II Allies
France, Britain the United States and the Soviet Union.
   Allied authorities said Hess died after he hanged himself, but
his family has disputed the finding and on occasion has hinted that
it believed foul play was involved.

   Moslem rebels today released
an American and his Filipino wife 17 days after taking them
hostage, the military said.
   Col. Carlos Pena, provincial commander of Lanao del Sur province
on Mindanao island, said David Blair Stiffler, a construction
worker from New York City, and his wife Elpidia were turned over to
military and police units near Lake Lanao, 520 miles southeast of
Manila.
   Pena said the couple appeared in good health but were exhausted.
He said no ransom was paid.
   Stiffler and his wife were kidnapped July 30 by a breakaway
faction of the Moro Islamic Liberation Front as they were traveling
by passenger jeep in Lanao del Sur province. The area is known for
activity by various Moslem insurgent groups and armed criminal
gangs.
   On Monday, the military issued an ultimatum that the kidnappers
release the hostages by today or troops would launch rescue
operations.
   Lt. Col. Anthony Elias, spokesman of the military's Southern
Command, said the kidnappers demanded $7,500 ransom for release of
the couple but later dropped the demand to $1,000. Elias also
maintained no ransom was paid.

   Nine people serving free meals to the

state and local law.
   ``They're in violation of the health code, the park code and the
penal code,'' Lt. Rich Holder said Monday. ``We bent over backward
to explain the city and state ordinances regarding the issue.''
   Police would not comment further on the charges Monday night.
   Volunteers from Food Not Bombs began distributing the food in
spring. Police contend the handouts draw drug and alcohol abusers
to the park and that more than a dozen nearby homeowners and
business owners complained.
   Police had repeatedly warned Food Not Bomb that its volunteers
would be arrested if they set up a food line in the park.
   Police had proposed having the group dispense food at nearby
Hamilton Methodist Church, which serves free meals of its own twice
a week and has the required sanitary facilities, but the church and
Food Not Bombs rejected the idea.
   The fruit and vegetables confiscated during the arrests were
donated to the church.

   An electrician was charged today with hacking to
death his neighbor's 18-month-old daughter with a 2-foot machete in
what police called a ``mindless killing.''
   Larkland Francis, 45, also faced a further charge of attempting
to murder the girl's mother, 28-year-old Amma Boakye, who was
injured in the attack on Monday.
   During a brief hearing at Camberwell Magistrate's Court, Francis
was ordered held in custody for a week pending another appearance.
There was no application for bail.
   Police said Ms. Boakye was pushing her daughter, Winifred Agwu,
in a stroller along the corridor outside their apartment in a
public housing project in the southeast London district of East
Dulwich when they were attacked.
   Ms. Boakye was wounded and fled, screaming for help, said a
police spokeswoman, speaking anonymously in keeping with British
custom. ``The man then attacked the child who received fatal
injuries,'' the spokeswoman said.
   Detective Constable D.C. Shotton, a police officer involved in
the case, said there was no apparent motive for the killing.
   ``There isn't any motive. It's just a mindless killing,'' he
said.
   Neighbor Julian Manning, 21, said he ran outside after he heard
screaming and saw a woman running down the stairs.
   ``The woman was hysterical and was screaming, `My child, my
child _ he has got my child.' The woman had blood dripping from her
hand and from her clothing,'' he said.
   ``We could see the man the whole time. He was shouting, swearing
and laughing.''
   By the time police arrived, Manning said, more than 30 people
were watching the killer, too frightened to approach him.
   Ms. Boakye was taken to a hospital where she was treated for
head wounds.

<DATELINE>WESTERLY, R.I. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Beachgoers undeterred by the medical waste
washing up here this summer found something much more interesting
in the water _ money.
   Great gobs of cash appeared at Weekapaug Beach over the weekend,
prompting at least 40 people to run, giggling and screeching, into
the water to pick it up.
   ``You had your own little spot and you just stood there and
watched the seaweed,'' said Leonard Francois of Springfield, Mass.,
who found $23 Sunday. ``It was in the seaweed. Sometimes it was
rolled up and when you went to grab it, it got washed away. If you
saw green you just had to jump for it.''
   Lifeguard Dean Perri, 20, said the scene was ``wild.''
   ``People were digging in the sand with sticks and turning over
the seaweed,'' he said. ``One girl was yelling, `Mommy, Mommy, look
what I found. She had two $100 bills. My boss found 80 bucks.''
   Most of the money displayed Monday by the finders appeared in
good shape and was dated 1985.
   The cash began washing ashore Wednesday. Unlike the needles,
syringes and other medical debris discovered here, the money was
not immediately reported to lifeguards, police or state
environmental authorities.
   Secret Service agent Joseph G. Sullivan said that as far as the
U.S. Treasury Department, which runs the agency, is concerned, it's
``finders keepers.''
   Many finders speculated it was drug money, but Perri had another
idea. ``Maybe the hospitals that have been dumping the medical
waste are putting money in the water now to bribe us,'' he said.

<HEAD>Goldwater Hailed at GOP Convention</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: New throughout with Goldwater comments today.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>NEW ORLEANS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former Arizona Sen. Barry Goldwater today
called the Republican National Convention ``the worst-organized,
worst-run convention I've ever been to,'' and said he had trouble
getting into the session where he was honored.
   However, he said he was confident the party would win the
presidential election. He said George Bush had run a good campaign
while ``Dukakis is a Greek tragedy.''
   Goldwater, who was hailed as ``Mr. Conservative'' during the
convention's Monday night session, said he couldn't hear a word of
President Reagan's speech as he sat in the gallery with members of
Bush's family.
   ``Everything in that hall was wrong,'' he said. ``They couldn't
turn the volume up. Where I sat I didn't hear a word.''
   The 1964 GOP presidential nominee, interviewed on NBC-TV's
``Today'' show, said it took him 40 minutes to get into the
Louisiana Superdome, where the convention is being held, because he
didn't have a security pass.
   Convention glitches aside, Goldwater said he wasn't worried
about the Republican Party overall, ``because we're going to win''
the election.
   Asked why he had characterized Dukakis as ``a Greek tragedy,''
Goldwater said: ``Well, he is Greek. He's just a tragedy and he
happens to be a Greek.''
   Goldwater stood in the gallery Monday night and smiled as the
crowd cheered him during the salute by Colorado Sen. William
Armstrong.
   Armstrong said the Arizona Republican patriarch was ``a man of
honor, a man of integrity, a fighter, an idealist, a patriot, Mr.
Conservative.''
   ``He dared to believe in the people'' rather than a powerful
government, Armstrong said.
   A videotaped history of Goldwater's career called him ``a
courageous leader bringing us the truth as he saw it'' and included
statements from Reagan and Kansas Sen. Nancy Kassebaum.

   ``It went great, but it was a little cool at the end,'' Vicki
Keith, a 27-year-old swimming coach in Kingston, Ontario, said when
she left the water here Monday night.
   She used a butterfly stroke to propel herself the last few yards
to shore, ending the 17-hour swim from Port Wing, Wis. Earlier this
summer, Keith swam Lakes Erie, Huron and Michigan; she plans to
swim Lake Ontario next week.
   Last year, she became the first person to complete a 62.7-mile
double crossing of that lake.
   She had to be supported by crew members Monday night when she
came ashore to a smiling and waving to a crowd of several hundred
people.
   ``Putting up with cold water is really difficult. I wouldn't
consider it an easy swim at all,'' she said an hour later, after
showering and warming up.
   Early Monday, the surface water temperature at the starting
point was 62 degrees. But at Two Harbors, the water temperature was
around 55. There were no waves or wind problems, said Coast Guard
Petty Officer Paul Clough.
   Keith's swims have raised about $52,650 U.S. for an aquatic wing
for disabled children at a sports center in Toronto.

   An artist wants to give women a break from cat
calls heard on city streets by encouraging men to leer, if they
must, in silence.
   Easy-to-read directions will be posted in the financial district
and near City Hall.
   One sign admonishes: ``No Cat Calls,'' specifying ``whistling
and kissing sounds,'' and depicts a woman halting a truck driven by
a cat.
   Another sign demands, in English and Spanish: ``Curb Your Animal
Instinct.'' It shows a ``wolf'' being restrained with a leash from
lunging at a woman.
   Ilona Granet, who designs logos and signs for businesses and
boats, said she will install them herself later this week at her
expense with tools and equipment provided by the city.
   ``Women can't walk along the streets in the city without being
subjected to sexual innuendoes,'' she said. The signs, the
40-year-old artist said, are for women who can't bring themselves
to respond on their own.
   Of the five community boards in Manhattan that Ms. Granet has
approached about posting her signs, one granted permission and
another expressed interest.
   Among objections raised by the other boards were that the signs
insulted working-class men and omitted references to male victims
of whistles and cat calls.

   The local branch of the American Civil Liberties
Union says it will get into the movie theater business if necessary
to ensure the controversial film ``The Last Temptation of Christ''
plays here.
   Howard Simon, executive director of the Michigan ACLU, said
Monday that he approached the producer, Universal Pictures, about
sponsoring a showing to make certain Detroit-area theatergoers had
an opportunity to judge it on its merits.
   ``This is what America is all about,'' Simon said. ``The film
needs to be seen so that we're not victimized by self-censorship.
On the other hand, our job is also to defend the right of anybody
to protest the film. They have a First Amendment right to do that,
too.''
   Some theater chains across the country refused to carry the
movie after being threatened with boycotts and protests from
fundamentalists who consider the film blasphemous for depicting
Christ as fantasizing about living as a man.
   The film, which opened Friday in nine cities in the United
States and Canada, is scheduled to open in mid-September in Detroit.
   Simon said Universal Pictures told him his offer to organize a
screening ``might be premature.''

<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Suleiman Franjieh, Lebanon's president
when civil war broke out 13 years ago, announced today he will seek
a new term, triggering a political crisis that could delay
elections set for this week.
   The news that Franjieh, 78, would run was announced on the Voice
of Unified Free Lebanon radio station which he controls. The radio
said Franjieh planned to travel from his summer home in Ehden,
northern Lebanon, to Moslem west Beirut today to set up campaign
headquarters.
   Lebanon's parliament is scheduled to choose a new president
Thursday. President Amin Gemayel's term expires Sept. 23, and he is
constitutionally barred from seeking a second term.
   Franjieh, a Maronite Catholice, is Syria's closest Christian
ally in Lebanon and a friend of President Hafez Assad of Syria, the
main power broker in Lebanon.
   Toward the end of his six-year term in 1976, Franjieh formally
requested Syrian military intervention to quell Christian-Moslem
fighting. Tens of thousands of Syrian troops remain in Lebanon.
   Right-wing Christians, including Gemayel, have declared they
would use every possible means to block Franjieh's election.
   Gemayel torpedoed a Syrian-arranged peace treaty between Moslem
and Christian militia leaders in 1985 and Syria is expected to want
someone more to its liking.
   Spokesmen for the Lebanese Forces, the main Christian militia
that rules east Beirut and most of the Christian heartland, have
said they would block the election of a president imposed by Syria
``with political pressure and even military pressure.''
   
   Franjieh holds the Lebanese Forces' commander, Samir Geagea,
responsible for slaughtering his elder son Tony, Tony's wife, the
couple's 3-year-old daughter and 30 bodyguards in a raid on the
Franjieh mansion in Ehden in 1978.
   Only 76 parliament deputies are eligible to vote in the
presidential balloting. A 99-member parliament was elected in 1972
for a four-year term, but civil war prevented new parliamentary
elections and the body's mandate has been renewed regularly.
   Twenty-two of the original 99 deputies have died, and Gemayel
vacated his seat when he was elected president in 1982. Gemayel was
elected after his brother, Bashir, was killed in a bombing nine
days before he was to be sworn in as president.
   This time, there are more than two dozen presidential candidates.
   Parliament speaker Hussein Husseini set the required quorum for
this year's presidential election at 53, two thirds of the 79
deputies who were alive when the parliament's tenure was last
extended in 1987.
   Under the constitution, the president is to be elected by a
two-third majority at parliament in the first ballot, and a simple
majority of 51 percent of votes cast in the second round.
   The independent daily newspaper An-Nahar said 17 anti-Syrian
parliament members living in east Beirut would boycott Thursday's
session if Franjieh ran.
   Five Armenian parliament members residing in east Beirut also
would be unable to make it to the parliament headquarters on
Beirut's dividing Green Line to attend the session, the newspaper
said. Five deputies living abroad have declared they will not
return for the election.
   Word that Franjieh would seek a new term with Syria's blessing
leaked last week.
   The Lebanese Forces command ordered its 6,000-strong militia on
``maximum alert'' and said its leaders were holding talks with
Gemayel on ways to block Franjieh's election.

   A Kuwaiti military delegation is to visit Moscow
this month for talks on military cooperation, a Defense Ministry
statement said today.
   The delegation, led by Maj. Gen. Mizyad Abdul-Rahman Al-Sana',
the chief of staff, will leave for the Soviet Union on Aug. 29.
   The visit, during which the Kuwaitis will view sophisticated
Soviet weapons, comes nearly a month after the oil-rich Arab nation
and the Soviet Union signed their latest arms deal.
   Details of the agreement have not been officially disclosed, but
press reports said Kuwait is to acquire 245 Soviet-made troop
carriers and an unspecified number of air defense missiles.
   In a previous arms deal signed in 1984 and worth $300 million,
the Soviets sold the Kuwaitis surface-to-air missiles known as
SAM-7s. The latter agreement was concluded after the U.S. Congress
barred the sale of American-made Stinger missiles to this nation at
the top of the Persian Gulf.
   The latest Soviet-Kuwaiti deal was made while Crown Prince Sheik
Saad Al-Abdullah Al-Sabah, who also is the prime minister, was in
Washington discussing a $1.9 billion deal with the United States
involving Maverick missiles and F-18 jets. The $1.9 billion sale
must be approved by the U.S. Congress.

   Hospital officials said today that three
sisters were injured, one critically, by debris from two Israeli
F-15 fighters that collided and crashed near a Palestinian farming
village, killing both pilots.
   The American-made jets were on training flights near the Dead
Sea when the accident occurred Monday, said the army, which
appointed a commission to investigate.
   Israeli radio stations said the planes clipped each other's
wings.
   It was the first known accident Israel's air force has had with
the advanced, high-flying plane, according to informed sources in
Washington.
   Witnesses said the crash occurred near the West Bank village of
Bani Naim, about 15 miles south of Jerusalem at about 11 a.m.
   The army delayed publication of the accident for 12 hours.
   Palestinians in Bani Naim, where 10,000 people live, said
wreckage hit a nearby tent belonging to a family of the nomadic
Bedouin tribe, and soldiers promptly sealed off the area.
   ``I heard a loud explosion. We didn't know what was happening,''
Hassan Manasara, 27, told The Associated Press.
   ``I saw the planes hit the ground and then explode,'' said a
Bedouin who was 100 yards from the crash site and spoke to the AP
on condition of anonymity.
   ``One helicopter landed to pick up the Israeli victims, while
another hovered overhead,'' the witness said.
   The injured girls were identified as Sahar abu Shkahaidem, 5
years old, who was in critical condition with extensive burns,
Alia, 17, who was hospitalized in fair condition, and Zaharia, 15,
who was treated at Alia Hospital in nearby Hebron and released.
   Twenty sheep belonging to the Shkahaidem family were also killed
in the accident, and 30 were hurt, the Bedouin witness said.
   The army identified the pilots killed as veteran fliers, Lt.
Col. Ram Kuller, 36, of the Kfar Giliadi communal farm on Israel's
northern border with Lebanon and Maj. Ehud Falk, 33, of the
Merhavia collective farm. Their funerals were scheduled for today.
   The F-15, nicknamed the Eagle by the U.S. Air Force, is the most
advanced, land-based jet fighter in the American inventory. The
twin-engine jet is designed to fly and fight in all weather
conditions and can soar at more than 2{ times the speed of sound.
   Israel is one of few foreign countries that has been allowed to
acquire the single-seat fighter, which has a combat altitude
ceiling of 65,000 feet.
   Israel has about 50 of the planes, costing about $30 million
each and manufactured by the McDonnell Douglas Corp. It ordered
five more earlier in the summer.
   The fighter has been used by Israel in conducting deadly air
raids in the past, among them, dog fights with Syria in 1982 in
which more than 80 Syrian jets were shot down, while no Israeli
F-15s were lost.

<TEXT>
   The PLO's executive panel has approved the
establishment of a provisional government in Israeli-occupied
territories, a senior Palestinian official said.
   Bassam Abu Sharif, a spokesman for PLO chief Yasser Arafat, also
called on the United States to support the formation of an
independent Palestinian state.
   ``The Executive Committee has approved the idea of the
provisional government and it will be endorsed by the PNC
(Palestine National Council),'' Abu Sharif told a news conference
Monday in Baghdad.
   The Palestine National Council, parliament-in-exile of the
Palestine Liberation Organization, is scheduled to meet next month
in Algeria.
   A high-level PLO delegation met today in the Egyptian port city
of Alexandria with President Hosni Mubarak, the state-run Middle
East News Agency said.
   The delegation discussed the idea of a provisional government in
the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip Monday with Foreign Minister
Esmat Abdel-Meguid, delegation member Abdullah Horani said.
   At the Baghdad news conference, Abu Sharif said the PNC would
explore the idea of demanding independence for the West Bank and
Gaza, captured by Israel in the 1967 Middle East war, and the
creation of a Palestinian state.
   The territories have been plagued for the last eight months by a
Palestinian rebellion, or ``intefadah'' in Arabic, that has claimed
the lives of more than 240 Palestinians and four Israelis since
Dec. 8.
   ``This (independent) state has been the target of the intefadah
and the Council will thoroughly examine the possibility of its
declaration soon,'' Abu Sharif said.
   He said ``the U.S. administration should support ... U.N.
resolutions which call for the setting up of a Palestinian state.''
   Israel has denounced all attempts to declare Palestinian
independence or set up a state in occupied territory. It refuses to
talk to the PLO, which it views as a terrorist group.
   Abu Sharif also said the PLO would compensate Palestinians left
jobless after Jordan's King Hussein late last month announced he
was cutting legal and administrative ties with the West Bank and
Gaza.
   Recent PLO appeals for a dialogue with Israel have provoked
debate in the Jewish state over the sincerity of the statements.
   Last month Abu Sharif indicated the PLO may adopt the idea of
peace talks based on recognition of Israel's right to exist. On
Sunday, Salah Khalaf, deputy chairman of Arafat's Fatah wing, made
a similar statement in the Paris-based Journal du Dimanche.
   Foreign Minister Shimon Peres, head of the center-left Labor
Party, demanded Monday that the PLO present a clear-cut position.
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, who heads the right-wing Likud
bloc, dismissed Khalaf's statements as a tactical move aimed at
Israel's destruction.
   A Foreign Ministry official, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said officials would ``study attentively'' the text of the Khalaf
interview.

   Soviet troops will not complete their withdrawal
from Afghanistan earlier than the Feb. 15 deadline set by a
U.N.-sponsored agreement because of the military situation there, a
government spokesman said today.
   Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady I. Gerasimov repeated Kremlin
accusations that guerrillas fighting the Soviet-backed Afghan
government have been supplied with weapons and other aid by
Pakistan in violation of the April 14 agreement signed in Geneva.
   Gerasimov, speaking at a regular news briefing, also denied a
U.S. allegation that the retreating Soviet forces have left behind
as many as 30 million mines.
   Half of the Soviet Union's more than 100,000 soldiers who had
been deployed in Afghanistan have returned since the withdrawal
began May 15.
   The Geneva agreement requires the other Soviet soldiers to be
out of Afghanistan no later than Feb. 15, but Foreign Minister
Eduard A. Shevardnadze has indicated the Kremlin would like all of
its troops home before the end of this year. Soviet forces
intervened in December 1979.
   On Monday, the Tass news agency reported the second phase of the
withdrawal would begin in November, and Gerasimov confirmed that
the pullout would likely extend beyond 1988.
   ``The situation in Afghanistan does not give grounds to
accelerate the withdrawal of Soviet troops,'' he told reporters.
   Gerasimov said rebel groups based in Pakistan have been
increasing their attacks on Soviet-backed Afghan government troops,
and that until the guerrillas laid down their arms and joined a
proposed governing coalition, there would be no opportunity to
complete the Soviet withdrawal early.
   ``For the time being there is no possibility to reduce the plan
for withdrawing Soviet troops,'' Gerasimov said.
   The Soviet government has complained repeatedly that Pakistan is
violating the Geneva accords and on Monday threatened to take
unspecified action in response.
   If military supplies to the insurgents continue, the statement
said, ``the Soviet Union reserves for itself, in that case, the
right to take such measures that are necessitated by the
situation.''
   Gerasimov declined to specify what action the Soviet Union would
take, but said the statement was meant as a ``warning'' to Pakistan.
   U.S. State Department spokesman Charles Redman told reporters in
Washington on Monday that it appeared the Soviets were adhering to
their withdrawal commitments, but said the soldiers had left behind
as many as 30 million mines, including booby-trapped toys.
   ``We would like to state again that we are not involved in any
mining,'' Gerasimov said, adding that Soviet soldiers have been
helping Afghans remove and defuse mines planted by opposition
forces along major roads.
   Tass reported Tuesday that the capital of Kabul was again under
rocket fire, and said ``fierce fighting'' continued around Kunduz,
a northern provincial capital.
   Afghan President Najib and Soviet officials have said Kunduz was
lost to guerrillas forces earlier this month but taken back again
by government troops.
   Two Moslem guerrilla groups claimed today in Pakistan that their
fighters were holding on to Kunduz despite heavy bombardment by
Afghan government troops.
   The guerrillas also claimed today that they captured Talogan,
capital of Takhar province east of Kunduz, on Friday.
   With about 50,000 Soviet troops remaining in Afghanistan,
guerrillas have concentrated recent attacks around Kabul, northern
provinces and the southeastern provincial capital of Kandahar,
abandoned by the Soviets the same time as Kunduz.
   Many Western analysts predict Afghan government troops will not
last long against the Moslem insurgents, who are armed via Pakistan
by the United States, China and Saudi Arabia. The Soviet Union
intervened in Afghanistan in December 1979.

   Our friends on the other side had actually passed the single
highest tax bill in the 200-year history of the United States. Auto
loans, because of their policies, went up to 17 percent _ so our
great factories began shutting down. Fuel costs jumped through the
atmosphere _ more than doubling. Then people waited in gas lines as
well as unemployment lines.
   Facts are stupid things _ stubborn things, I should say.
   And then there was the misery index. That was an election year
gimmick they designed for the 1976 campaign _ they added the
unemployment and inflation rates. And it came to 13.4 percent in
1976, and they declared that our candidate, Jerry Ford, had no
right to seek re-election with that kind of misery index.
   But four years later, in the 1980 campaign, they didn't mention
the misery index. Do you suppose it was because it was no longer
13.4 percent? In those four years it had become almost 21 percent.
   And last month, in Atlanta at their convention, there was again
no mention of the misery index. Why? Because, right now, it's less
than 9.2 percent.
   Facts are stubborn things.
   When we met in Detroit in that summer of 1980 _ it was a summer
of discontent for America around the world. Our national defense
had been so weakened, the Soviet Union had begun to engage in
reckless aggression, including the invasion and occupation of
Afghanistan.
   The U.S. response to that was to forbid our athletes to
participate in the 1980 Olympics and to try to pull the rug out
from under our farmers with a grain and soybean embargo.
   And in those years, on any given day, we had military aircraft
that couldn't fly for lack of spare parts, and ships that couldn't
leave port for the same reason or for lack of a crew. Our embassy
in Pakistan was burned to the ground, and the one in Iran was
stormed and occupied with all Americans taken as hostages. The
world began to question the constancy and resolve of the United
States. Our leaders answered, not that there was something wrong
with our government, but that our people were at fault because of
some malaise.
   Well, facts are stubborn things.
   When our friends last month talked of unemployment, despair,
hopelessness, economic weakness _ I wondered why on Earth they were
talking about 1978 instead of 1988.
   Now, now we hear talk that it's time for a change. Well, ladies
and gentlemen, another friendly reminder: We are the change.
   We rolled up our sleeves and went to work in January of 1981; we
focused on hope, not despair. We challenged the failed policies of
the past, because we believed that a society is great, not because
of promises made by its government, but only because of progress
made by its people. And that was our change.
   We said something shocking. Taxes ought to be reduced, not
raised. We cut the tax rates for the working folks of America. We
indexed taxes, and that stopped bracket creep which kicked average
wage-earners into higher tax brackets when they'd only received a
cost-of-living pay raise. And we initiated reform of the unfairness
in our tax system. And what do you know _ the top 5 percent of
earners are paying a higher percentage of the total tax revenue at
the lower rates than they ever had before, and millions of earners
at the bottom of the scale have been freed from paying any income
tax at all.

<HEAD>First Stage of Nationwide AIDS Survey Scrapped After Community
Protests</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal authorities have scrapped the first stage
of a major AIDS survey because of protests from community leaders
in Washington, D.C.
   Dr. James O. Mason, director of the Centers for Disease Control
in Atlanta, said Monday the project was opposed because of fear
that participants' AIDS test results would not be kept confidential.
   Since the CDC project _ the first part of a major study to
assess the nation's AIDS infection rate _ was bungled in its early
stages, the agency must drop Washington as its survey site and
start over elsewhere, Mason said.
   ``The damage has been done. If I had the same information as the
black people in Washington, I would have been concerned'' about
participating in the survey, he said.
   Black health leaders described the setback, which comes more
than a year after President Reagan called for the study, as an
example of the administration's awkward approach to issues in the
black community.
   ``It is emblematic of a lack of sensitivity,'' said Dr. Rudolph
Jackson, chairman of pediatrics at Atlanta's Morehouse School of
Medicine.
   At issue were the questions doctors planned to ask as they took
blood samples at 800 randomly selected households in Washington.
The questions included the subject's name and sexual preference.
   Mason said the study would be redesigned with queries concerning
only age, gender and general geographic location.
   More local people should have been involved in planning the
survey, said Dr. Reed V. Tuckson, commissioner of health for the
District of Columbia. He said that would have allowed concerns
about confidentiality to be addressed.
   Mason said the CDC planned to use the Washington project as a
trial run in a nationwide AIDS survey of about 50,000 people.
   New York is the only other site beside Washington that had been
publicized for the survey. Mason said Monday a new site had not
been selected.
   At a conference on AIDS last year in Atlanta, black and Hispanic
leaders read resolutions lamenting CDC's ``disregard and
insensitivity'' toward their groups.

   A bus driver said his brakes failed on a
steep road and he tried to stop the careening vehicle against a
tunnel wall, but the bus crashed, killing 12 children and three
adults, the Norwegian news agency NTB reported today.
   The crash Monday outside Eidsfjord, 120 miles west of Oslo, was
the worst bus accident in Norway since 1948.
   Among the 15 fatalities, 12 were children from a Stockholm
school on a week-long outing to the British Shetland Islands. All
19 of the other passengers were injured, police said. They said the
Swedish bus was carrying 23 students, nine parents, a teacher and
the driver.
   Hans Jacob Berntsen, 46, of Bergen, Norway, was driving behind
the bus and was the first at the scene, according to the Oslo daily
Dagbladet.
   ``I talked to the injured driver. He said the brakes had failed
and that he tried to stop the bus by letting it swerve along the
tunnel walls,'' Berntsen was quoted as saying.
   ``He told me that he had urged the passengers to stay in the
rear of the bus. That may have saved the lives of several of
them,'' he said.
   The bus rammed into a concrete wall near the end of the steep,
curving Maaboedal Tunnel, about 60 miles from the city of Bergen,
where the group was to board a ferry, according to the Stockholm
daily Aftonbladet.
   Survivors were evacuated by helicopter and six people were
reported severely injured but out of danger, according to a doctor
at Bergen's Haukeland Hospital.
   Bernt F. Moe, chief constable in the Hardanger district where
the crash occurred, said a crane was used to lift some of the
bodies from the wreckage.
   The 11- and 12-year-olds who died were from the Kvarnbacka
Primary School in the Stockholm suburb of Kista. A teacher at the
school told Aftonbladet the students had spent two years holding
bazaars and saving money to finance the trip.
   The tunnel, which has had no fatal accidents since it opened in
1986, is about 120 miles northwest of Oslo.
   Swedish Radio said the bus was not licensed for commerical
traffic and was rented or borrowed from a sports club. The driver
was a police officer licensed to drive a bus, according to the
Aftonbladet daily in Stockholm.
   Norway's worst bus accident occurred on July 5, 1948, when 16
people were killed on a remote northern road.

<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A blind woman accepted a $17,000 settlement
in a suit accusing a policeman of forcing her to clean up her guide
dog's mess as bystanders watched.
   Raygena Harper, a stockbroker at Paine Webber Co. in Walnut
Creek, admitted that she had allowed her dog to defecate in a
gutter in 1985 but said she believed blind people were exempt from
the city's ``pooper-scooper'' ordinance.
   A police officer ordered Harper to clean up the mess, and Harper
became ``increasingly distressed and humiliated as a large crowd
gathered,'' the suit said.
   The lawsuit added that Officer Aaron Barnes forced her ``to
clean up after her dog with a paper tissue, insert the waste into a
paper bag and travel across the street to deposit the bag in a
garbage receptacle.''
   In court papers, Barnes said Harper never told him she was blind.
   The officer was temporarily suspended and ordered to perform 100
hours of community service.
   Harper has been legally blind since birth.

   Israeli troops shot
and seriously wounded three Palestinians today and 75 were treated
for beating injuries, hospital officials said.
   The army said at least 12 Palestinians were injured in scuffles
with troops in the Gaza Strip, where a curfew was in effect for a
second day.
   Officials at Gaza City's Shifa Hospital said troops beat Arabs
with riot sticks on the head, arms and legs, and put the number of
injured at 75. Thirty-five were still undergoing treatment by
midday Tuesday, they said.
   Officials at Al Ittihad Hospital in Nablus, meanwhile, said
Aymen Yameen, 16, suffered a critical gunshot wound to the head.
They said a second youth, Abdul Razak Hudhud, 20, was critically
wounded in the stomach during a clash between stone-throwers and
soldiers inside Nablus.
   The army confirmed troops wounded a Palestinian in the West Bank
town of Tel during a clash with Arabs throwing stones and bottles.
It said it was checking the reports of two wounded in nearby Nablus
and of beating injuries in the Gaza Strip.
   Israeli news reports said soldiers beefed up patrols in Gaza,
where the 650,000 residents have been confined to their homes since
a curfew was imposed Sunday night following a firebomb attack on
Israeli civilians in which an 8-month-old was seriously burned.
   The curfew has denied reporters entry to Gaza except under
military escort, although Jewish settlers were allowed into the
Israeli-occupied seaside strip and armed supporters of Rabbi Meir
Kahane launched patrols on a highway leading to Jewish settlements
in Gaza.
   United Nations food trucks also were barred from entering Gaza
to distribute daily rations of flour, rice, milk, sugar and oil to
refugee camps, said Rulf Van Uye, a spokesman for the U.N. Relief
and Works Agency.
   But there were no reported food shortages, Uye said.
   Dozens of Palestinian youths defied the curfew Monday by hurling
stones and burning tires on roads and darting out from behind
street corners to shout ``We want a state,'' witnesses said.
   Demonstrators also burned tires in Khan Yunis, while in Gaza
City children broke curfew today by playing basketball and soccer
in the streets and fleeing when soldiers were spotted, an Arab
witness said.
   Clashes erupted in several areas, including Jabaliya refugee
camp in northern Gaza, where soldiers fired tear gas to disperse
stone-throwing demonstrators, Arab news reports said.
   A 15-year-old Palestinian was also moderately wounded in the
stomach in the Nablus clash, said an official at the city's St.
John's Hospital.
   The military also said soldiers had recently begun using a new
plastic bullet which is designed to cause fewer casualties. Israel
radio said the new bullet was potentially lethal at a range of
under 70 yards.
   The radio also reported that unidentified assailants sabotaged a
water pipeline to the Beit Hagai settlement near the West Bank city
of Hebron Monday night.
   Police said, meanwhile, they were investigating an apparent
suicide by a 20-year-old Palestinian detainee who was found hanging
in his jail cell at the Jerusalem police headquarters today.
   The detainee, Nabeh Nabil Mustafa, of east Jerusalem, was
detained Aug. 10 on suspicion of involvement in anti-Israeli
violence, said Jerusalem Police spokesman Rafi Levy, who declined
to elaborate.
   The Gaza Strip has been under an around-the-clock and indefinite
curfew since Sunday after a violent weekend in which three Arabs
died during protests in the lands Israel seized in the 1967 Middle
East war.
   It was only the third time the army sealed off the entire Gaza
Strip since the Palestinian uprising began last Dec. 8.
   Palestinians and Israeli officials traced the weekend's outbreak
of violence to the arson deaths of three Gaza workers who were
trapped in a shed set on fire near Tel Aviv last week. Police said
Jewish extremists may have been involved.
   The third worker, a 34-year-old man, died early today of his
wounds, Israel army radio reported.
   Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin called the Gaza curfew a clear
message that Israel was cracking down on protesters, and said it
would be in effect ``as long as needed.''
   Some Israeli sources speculated the move, which kept some 50,000
Gazans away from jobs in Israel, was an effort to put economic
pressure on the residents.
   In the West Bank, hospital officials said 21-year-old Jamal Odeh
of Tulkarm refugee camp was dead on arrival Monday after being shot
in the heart during clashes. His death raised to 245 the Arab death
toll in the uprising. Four Israelis also have died.

   Jack Kemp, who has made no secret of his
desire to be the GOP vice presidential nominee, said today that
George Bush's decision to delay naming his running mate is smart
because it has kept suspense alive.
   ``I don't think it's demeaning,'' the congressman from New York
said of Bush's decision to keep secret the name of his running mate
until the last minute.
   ``It's kept suspense in our convention; it's certainly going to
focus a lot of attention not only on his pick, but on his own
speech, and to that extent, it's been a good idea,'' Kemp said on
ABC-TV.
   But Kemp said he didn't think the suspense should be drawn out
until Thursday night when Bush's running mate is to be announced at
the Republican National Convention. He speculated that Bush had
either made up his mind or was close to doing so.
   Kemp told reporters on Monday that he was eager to be selected.
   ``If I were to be asked, I would be a terrific campaigner, and a
terrific candidate, and a terrific vice president,'' he said.
   ``But I came here not expecting it. I don't expect it today. I'm
not sitting by the telephone.''
   Kemp, addressing Republican delegates on the convention's
opening night Monday, pledged to continue the Reagan revolution.
   ``We're going to finish the job,'' he said. ``We're going to
finish what we began in 1980: To help all Americans ... share in
the success of freedom, and democracy, and peace.''
   Kemp, whose own presidential campaign fizzled in the early
primaries, spoke to the convention before President Reagan's
farewell to his party. It was the high point in a schedule that
seemed aimed at keeping Kemp in the public eye _ and in the
speculation _ as Bush pondered a running mate.
   ``Could I be a good vice president? You bet,'' Kemp told
reporters before his speech.
   ``I was a good second string quarterback, and I could be a good
second string quarterback for George Bush,'' said Kemp, who played
for the San Diego Chargers and Buffalo Bills before entering
politics.
   Kemp was attending delegation meetings, minority receptions and
other public events, as well as conducting network television
interviews, during the convention week.
   A small staff from his congressional office and volunteers from
his defunct campaign kept a presence for him at a convention hotel.
   As he addressed the convention, delegates waved red signs
bearing his name. But his speech hardly seemed to grip his
convention hall audience, and he did not provoke a prolonged floor
demonstration.
   Kemp contends he is not campaigning for the vice presidential
job. But his loyal supporters among the party's right wing clearly
have been campaigning for him.
   They chanted ``Bush-Kemp'' at a huge reception he threw Sunday
night, and they presented him with a football jersey bearing not
his playing number _ which was 15 _ but 2, the number representing
the second spot on the GOP ticket.
   And Alabama Gov. Guy Hunt says he has arranged for one member of
each of the 50 state delegations at the convention to gather
signatures on petitions asking that Kemp be chosen as running mate.
   ``We're not trying to take George Bush's decision away from
him,'' Hunt said. ``Only he can make that decision. We're just
trying to show him what we think of Jack Kemp.''
   Kemp, addressing the convention that he had hoped would be
nominating him, spoke of economic opportunity _ his usual theme _
but largely avoided the arcane economic terminology and the laments
for the abandoned gold standard that so frequently filled his
campaign speeches.
   He praised the Reagan record and urged the Republican Party to
reach out to blacks, Hispanics and other minorities _ reflecting
his frequent call for blending social progress and economic
opportunity with bedrock conservatism.
   ``As the party of Lincoln _ and Reagan _ we believe that freedom
and hope and opportunity can't be for just some of us,'' Kemp said.
   ``They've got to be for all of us. America has got to keep
moving ahead, and we can't leave anyone behind.''
   He said Reagan's support for the Strategic Defense Initiative,
the Star Wars nuclear defense system, has ``shown us how we can
make even the threat of nuclear war obsolete.'' And he credited
Reagan with leading ``an entrepreneurial renaissance'' that has
``electrified the world and raised our standard of living'' while
creating 17 million new jobs in five years.

<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   More than 4,000 workers at a coal mine in
the southern city of Jastrzebie went on strike today to demand
legalization of Solidarity and higher wages, a spokeswoman said.
   The strike in Jastrzebie, about 275 miles southwest of Warsaw,
comes on the eighth anniversary of the founding of the outlawed
trade federation.
   Solidarity spokeswoman Katarzyna Ketrzynska said workers on the
overnight shift at the Manifest Lipcowy mine stayed outside the
mine shaft all night and were joined by workers arriving for the
morning shift.
   She said security officers blocked miners on the afternoon
shift, which starts at 2 p.m., from entering the grounds to join
the striking miners. The strike began at noon today, according to
Katrzynska.
   She said the miners are demanding the legalization of Solidarity
and reinstatement of workers fired for union activities. The
workers are also calling for higher wages and better working
conditions, and are requesting two lawyers and two economists to
assist them in the negotiations.
   Manifest Lipcowy is the second mine in the industrial region of
Silesia to experience unrest.
   Workers at the Rudna copper mine near the city of Wroclaw staged
a protest rally Monday to demand improved safety conditions and the
return of Solidarity activists to work. Three members of Solidarity
were barred Saturday from working.
   Solidarity was crushed in 1981, when the government imposed
martial law, and was banned nearly a year later by parliament.
   On Aug. 16, 1980, workers at factories around the northern port
of Gdansk joined striking shipyard workers to form Solidarity, the
first and only independent trade federation in the Soviet bloc.

   Black Republicans in the year of Democrat
Jesse Jackson are a minority within a minority, but they don't seem
to mind swimming against the tide. ``We're strong swimmers,'' said
one.
   At the same time, black delegates to the Republican National
Convention, who account for only 3 percent of the total, generally
had no quarrel with former GOP presidential contender Pete du
Pont's suggestion that Jackson jump ship and join the Republicans.
   ``I feel pride as a black American'' in what Jackson has
accomplished, said Gertie Thomas, 65, an administrator from Albany,
Calif. ``I just wish he was a Republican.''
   Nevertheless, the third-generation Republican added, `It's
fantastic to be a Republican in any year, this year included. If
you look at the statistics, you will see that we're swimming
against the tide. But we're strong swimmers, with strong legs and
strong backs and strong arms.''
   In a speech to the delegates, du Pont praised Jackson as ``a
prominent voice. But as long as you speak as a Democrat,'' he
added, ``you will never be a successful leader.'' His suggestion
that Jackson join ``the party of Lincoln and Reagan and Kemp and
Bork'' was greeted by silence from the Republicans.
   Minton Francis, 66, who heads an accreditation task force for
Howard University in Washington, D.C., said du Pont ``hit it right
on the head. Where Jackson belongs is in the Republican Party.
   ``Most of us look at the Democratic Party as taking the black
vote for granted. They promise blacks everything, but what they
deliver falls far short. Most current black millionaires were made
during Richard Nixon's administration,'' Francis said. ``Under
Jimmy Carter, nothing was passed out but welfare.''
   He, too, is proud of Jackson, but calls himself resolutely
Republican. ``In a party that appears predominantly white, there is
opportunity for those who can ride the tide and take with them some
who cannot help themselves.''
   Maxine Dawson, 65, a teacher from Topeka, Kan., said she was
confident Jackson's example will lead to ``an emergence of black
leadership'' within the GOP. ``I respect Jesse Jackson. I think
he's a national leader, but I'm a Republican and I believe in the
Republican philosophy.''
   Harold Thomas, a court administrator from Philadelphia, said
Jackson ``put things on the map. He had a movement. He did stir the
contents. I'd love to see someone stir up this convention. It's
stuffy.''
   Thomas wasn't sure the GOP needed Jackson _ ``Jesse who? Where's
his experience?'' _ but he did think the party could learn from the
Democrats.
   ``There's lots of lip service being paid to us, but not much
else,'' he said during du Pont's speech. ``(Republicans) could
stand to look over at the Democratic Party and see what they're
doing to lure blacks, Hispanics and Jews. We need them all.''
   The dearth of blacks at the convention was evident in the
instructions given to delegate Roberta Maloy of Brooklyn, N.Y., a
black delegate who was told to leave the funny hats at home and
look dignified.
   ``As one of the few blacks on the floor,'' she said, ``I could
be on camera at any time.''

<HEAD>Dotson Freed From Prison, Presses Request For Clemency</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gary Dotson, the convicted rapist whose accuser
later recanted, was freed from prison today after a six-month term
for violating terms of his parole and entered an alcohol
rehabilitation program.
   Dotson, 30, served his term at Logan Correctional Center in
Lincoln, said Nic Howell, a spokesman for the Corrections
Department. He was sent to prison after being arrested in a bar
Dec. 24 for allegedly starting a fight over a sandwich.
   Dotson, who blamed a drinking problem for his repeated scrapes
with the law since his 1985 release from prison on the rape
conviction, was taken to a rehabilitation program at an undisclosed
location in the Chicago area, Howell said.
   ``He'll be in the residential portion for several weeks and then
he'll be involved with that organization on an outpatient basis for
a while longer,'' Howell said today.
   Dotson three years ago was paroled early from a 25- to 50-year
sentence after Cathleen Crowell Webb recanted testimony that he had
raped her. Gov. James Thompson commuted Dotson's sentence to the
six years he had served.
   Mrs. Webb said in her recantation that she made up the rape
story to cover up for a sexual liaison with her boyfriend.
   In commuting Dotson's sentence, however, Thompson bypassed
Dotson's request for a grant of clemency, saying he did not believe
Mrs. Webb's recantation.
   On Monday, Dotson's attorney, Tom Breen, said he had asked
Thompson for clemency because of new evidence.
   Breen said tests by a forensic serologist on genetic material
from blood and semen samples from Dotson, Webb and her former
boyfriend prove ``conclusively, absolutely and definitively'' that
Dotson did not have sex with Webb.
   Thompson, who received results of the test last week, is in New
Orleans for the Republican National Convention.
   ``He wants to talk to some scientific types, to feel comfortable
in his own mind whether this test is scientifically reliable beyond
a reasonable doubt,'' said Terry Barnich, Thompson's legal counsel.
   The clemency request is submitted to a prison review board,
which makes a recommendation to the governor.
   Since his 1985 release, Dotson has been convicted of drunken
driving and arrested another time on charges he punched his wife
and threatened the couple's infant daughter.

   Authorities in Burma today released 51
people who were arrested during last week's anti-government
demonstrations in the capital of Rangoon, state-run Radio Rangoon
said.
   Student groups meanwhile distributed leaflets in Rangoon calling
for street demonstrations Wednesday to demand an end to 26 years of
authoritarian rule, diplomats and journalists said.
   Radio Rangoon said of those detained on Aug. 8-9, 51 were freed
from Insein Prison and handed over to parents and guardians. The
broadcast, monitored in Bangkok, said 47 of those released were
students.
   It did not identify those freed. Because of the dates given, it
was doubtful that among those released were Burma's leading
dissident, Aung Gyi, and the Burmese correspondent of The
Associated Press, Sein Win. The two were among 10 people detained
July 29-30.
   The radio also said 30 people arrested in Aug. 4-10 disturbances
in Pegu, 45 miles northeast of Rangoon, were freed Sunday.
   The releases were the first reported since the demonstrations
ended last Friday with the resignation of President Sein Lwin.
Radio Rangoon had said early on Aug. 9 that authorities had
arrested more than 700 demonstrators overnight. Later that day, it
reported 1,451 arrests in Rangoon but didn't make clear if that
included the 700 figure.
   A large number of other dissidents were arrested before and
after Aug. 8-9.
   Students distributed leaflets calling for protests and attached
identical posters on trees, mailboxes and walls of major buildings
today. The buildings include Rangoon General Hospital, which became
a rallying point for protesters after security forces allegedly
shot doctors and nurses there during the riots.
   Soldiers made no attempt to take down the posters, said Liu Zhen
Ting, a journalist for Singapore's United Morning News daily, upon
returning to Bangkok today.
   China's Xinhua news agency meanwhile reported 177 Burmese
lawyers signed a document charging last week's shooting of
demonstrators violated Burma's Constitution and the U.N.
declaration of human rights. The agency said the nation's bar
association submitted the document Monday to the Council of State,
or the president's office.
   The Xinhua report from Rangoon said the council sent copies of
the document to foreign embassies and to the U.N. secretary general.
   A Western diplomat reached in Rangoon said army trucks and tanks
with up to 200 soldiers parked today about 200 yards from the U.S.
Embassy, just south of the Sule Pagoda. Witnesses said last week's
violence began when security forces opened fire to disperse tens of
thousands of protesters who had converged peacefully in front of
the ancient pagoda.
   The diplomat said the vehicles were gone by the afternoon, and
the presence of security forces elsewhere in Rangoon was light.
   Burma's sole political party, the Burma Socialist Program Party,
and the legislature are holding emergency sessions Friday,
presumably to choose a successor to Sein Lwin, a retired general
who was widely hated for crushing dissent during a quarter-century
of military-dominated rule.
   Most analysts said they doubted the new Burmese leadership would
make dramatic changes in the one-party system Ne Win instituted 26
years ago. Sein Lwin ruled as president and party chairman for 17
days after Ne Win's resignation last month.
   Diplomats and tourists arriving today in Bangkok said the
placards and leaflets had seven demands, including multi-party
democracy, legalization of student unions, a court trial for Sein
Lwin and the release of political dissidents including their
leading figure, Aung Gyi.
   The students also have called for major changes in leadership,
reductions in the cost of living and compensation for families of
people killed or wounded in the demonstrations. It was not clear if
these were included in the list of seven demands.
   State-run Radio Rangoon has said at least 95 people were killed
and 240 wounded in protests in two dozen towns last week, but
Western diplomats believe hundreds were killed as security forces
repeatedly fired into crowds.

   Football coaches cut back on training, utilities from Maine to
Virginia cut back on power, and the homeless sought shelter in
air-conditioned buildings as record high temperatures were set in
26 cities.
   Grain and soybean futures posted their strongest gains in a week
Monday in response to predictions that crops in the drought-weary
Corn Belt would bake for most of this week.
   In New York City, Monday's record 97 degrees caused Consolidated
Edison to impose a brownout on at least 250,000 tenants, leaving
them without air conditioning and no way out but the stairs _
elevators to their high-rise homes were shut down.
   At least 10,000 other tenants suffered a blackout, scores of
businesses without power had to close and two hospitals voluntarily
switched to backup power.
   Monday's record high temperatures for the date included 104
degrees in Des Moines, Iowa, breaking a 102-year-old mark by two
degrees; 97 in Louisville, Ky., and Wilmington, Del., respectively
breaking 114-year-old and 93-year-old records by a degree.
   All 48 contiguous states had temperatures of 87 degrees or
higher and 100-degree temperatures were registered in 22 states and
the District of Columbia, the National Weather Serivce said.
   Today's forecast called for much of the same, with temperatures
above normal from central New England across Georgia and west
through the Plains.
   Highs were to reach the 60s and 70s over the Pacific Northwest
and along the California coast today. Readings in the 80s were
expected over the upper Missouri Valley, the Rocky Mountains and
the Great Basin. Highs were to reach between 100 and 105 over the
Central Plains, the middle Mississippi Valley, southern portions of
the Northern Plains and Arkansas. The Desert Southwest could watch
for highs to climb near 115, and the rest of the nation was to be
in the 90s.
   In Pierre, S.D., where the nation's record high temperature was
a staggering 114 degrees Monday, a big concern was for livestock.
With the heat expected to continue today, the weather service's
livestock safety index was predicted to reach the emergency
category across most of the state through this evening.
   In Minnehaha County, people who needed to find relief from the
heat could call a hot-line number to get a ride to a shelter.
   In New Hampshire, where air-conditioners have been sold out
across the state for a month, ice skating spelled relief. Concord's
Recreation and Parks Department is giving residents a chance to get
back into the cold tonight by offering free ice skating.
   The Salvation Army in Atlantic City, N.J., which runs an
overnight shelter for the homeless, said they have started to allow
people to stay during daytime hours because of the heat.
   ``We've had an increase in the number of people we're serving
this summer,'' Cadet Scott Kelly said. ``Normally summer is our
slow time but we've been pretty busy.''
   At least 10 elderly residents with heat-related complaints had
to be carried down from New York City high-rises by police and
paramedics, but most of the tenants seemed to have concerns for
food spoiling in rapidly defrosting refrigerators.
   One woman in a posh East-Side building said she'd hiked up and
down 23 flights of stairs twice. The woman, novelist Barbara Szold,
said her leg muscles were sore, but her main concern was for her
appliances. Her microwave, her personal computer and her answering
machine were all kaput, she said.
   Debbie Hauri of the Mata Hauri Pet Salon in Lebanon, N.H., said
the heat has her pet hair-clipping business up about 40 percent.
   ``The dogs are really suffering,'' particularly black ones, she
said, because black absorbs the heat.
   The heat also is contributing to a twofold increase in the
number of neck fractures from diving accidents, physicians at
Chicago's Northwestern Memorial Hospital said.
   Doctors said Monday they have treated 17 people so far this
summer for cervical spinal injuries from diving accidents. They
said they treated only eight people for similar injuries last
summer.
   Twenty-six people in Cook County, Ill., have died from
heat-related causes this month, said Chris Morris, a spokesman for
the medical examiner's office.
   Other states reporting heat-related deaths this summer include
Missouri with 28, Kansas with 14, Georgia and Kentucky with five
each and Texas with four.
   Iowa State's football coach Jim Walden said he planned to take
special precautions at practices this week.
   At Cyclone Stadium in Ames the temperature on the stadium's
artificial surface soared to 130 degrees Monday.
   Raising thermostats, lowering lighting and other voluntary
conservation measures Monday meant New England utilities did not
have to impose rotating blackouts, which they had predicted might
be necessary to save power.
   William Sheperdson, spokesman for the New England Power Pool,
which coordinates New England's electricity usage, said power
demand appeared to be somewhat below the record set Thursday.
   But in Baltimore, excessive demands for electricity brought on
by another day of record-setting temperatures prompted some
reductions in service for business customers in Maryland and three
other states and the District of Columbia, a Baltimore Gas &
Electric Co. official said.

   The General Assembly today began raising
from members the $75.6 million needed to support the 1,300
personnel who are to monitor a cease-fire between Iran and Iraq for
the first six months.
   The cas body scheduled emergency sessions on the
matter for today and Wednesday.
   In Baghdad, Iraq, a group of 73 h-strapped worldU.N. observers arrived
today to
prepare for their mission of helping to implement the cease-fire,
scheduled to begin Saturday, the official Iraqi News Agency said.
The agency, monitored in Cyprus, said the 73 joined a small group
of U.N. officials who had arrived last week.
   A U.N. report said the assembly should assess its 159 members a
total of $75.6 million to finance the truce-monitoring effort for
six months. U.N. officials earlier listed the cost at $74 million,
but said the higher figure includes a salary adjustment for the
observer force.
   The Security Council created the U.N. Iran-Iraq Military
Observer Group one week ago after Secretary-General Javier Perez de
Cuellar announced that Iran and Iraq agr Saturday through
Monday in army sectors that include the Iraqi southern port city of
Basra and the southern Faw Peninsula.

   George Bush arrived today in a convention
city ready to hand him the Republican presidential nomination,
saying he has finally settled on a still-secret running mate and
declaring ``this is a big time in our lives.''
   Bush said he practiced his acceptance speech on the plane while
en route to New Orleans. ``I checked it out with Barbara. She
stayed awake for the whole thing,'' he joked.
   Bush said he called President Reagan last night after his
farewell address. ``The president's speech was superb. He gave me a
marvelous send-off,'' Bush said.
   Bush called his appearance with Reagan at the airport a symbolic
``passing of the torch.''
   Asked when he made up his mind on a veep, Bush said, ``Just
before I climbed onto this plane. Today, with finality.''
   Bush would not be specific on when he would announce his running
mate, saying only it would be ``before Thursday night.''
   ``I want an opportunity to properly notify the person I will
nominate,' Bush told reporters on Air Force II as he flew from
Washington to New Orleans.
   The Republican presidential nominee-to-be said he also wanted to
notify those whom he did not choose before making his choice public.
   Bush said his decision came late.
   ``I had hoped to do it by the time I got on this airplane and I
have,'' Bush said. ``The decision will be announced before Thursday
night.''
   Bush warned reporters that he would not let out the name. He
said he would ``not to play the game of 20 questions'' with
reporters or others about the choice.
   ``He knows that if he tells one person, it will leak,'' said
Bush press secretary Sheila Tate.
   He said he had told no one of his decision _ even his wife or
campaign chairman-to-be James A. Baker III, both of whom joined him
for the plane ride.
   Bush said he thought he had made his selection ``with a certain
dignity ... there is going to be public speculation but I have not
contributed to public speculation.''
   Bush said he was not offended by remarks on Monday by Sen. Bob
Dole who complained about the selection process. ``I took no
offense at that,'' Bush said.
   Early today, Bush and family members boarded Air Force Two at
Andrews Air Force Base near Washington for the flight to New
Orleans, where he will accept the unchallenged nomination of his
party on Wednesday.
   On Thursday he will give an acceptance that will be measured
against the well-received speech Michael Dukakis delivered a month
ago in Atlanta.
   After watching the president's Monday night address to the
convention, Bush said he would ``do my level best to fill those big
shoes of President Ronald Reagan.''
   The Bush forces arranged for an elaborate arrival in this
convention city and a carefully orchestrated encounter with Reagan
at the Belle Chasse Naval Air Station near New Orleans.
   Reagan, eager not to steal the show from Bush, departs
immediately for a California vacation.
   Upon arrival at the airfield, Bush was to travel by motorcade to
the Mississippi River, where he will cross on a riverboat, the S.S.
Natchez, arriving with great fanfare on the downtown side of the
river for a rally in Spanish Plaza.
   The water crossing was designed ``to make good use of assets
that are part of the local scene,'' said Bush's chief of staff,
Craig Fuller. ``It will be a colorful arrival, possibly to be seen
on the evening news.''
   The vice president has said he hoped to make up his mind on a
choice of a running mate before leaving for New Orleans, but as of
late Monday had not made a decision, although he had considerably
narrowed his field of choices, said spokeswoman Tate.
   Asked whether the delay would cause logistical problems for the
campaign staff, Ms. Tate said: ``I hope that all those under
consideration have been smart enough to get their background
together, and smart enough to have a (copier) machine around, or
we'll be putting out pretty sparse information.''
   She said that she anticipated Bush would choose from among the
candidates who previously had been asked to provide background and
financial information, and doubted that Bush's choice would come
out of the blue.
   Those believed to be on Bush's short list include Sen. Bob Dole
of Kansas and his wife, former Transportation Secretary Elizabeth
Dole, Rep. Jack Kemp of New York, Sen. Dan Quayle of Indiana,
Attorney General Richard Thornburgh and former White House chief of
staff Howard Baker, who insists he's not in the running.
   Bush held both morning and afternoon sessions on Monday with
speechwriter Peggy Noonan going over a final draft of the
acceptance speech.
   On Monday, Bush suggested that Reagan would be a hard act to
follow, and said that he would ``not try to be a Ronald Reagan.
There is only one. I want to be George Bush.''
   Asked whether he expected to be compared with Reagan, Bush said
he felt such comparisons were inevitable ``because he's been a
great president.''
   Bush also told NBC that the ``pressure is mounting'' as he nears
the time for him to accept his party's presidential nomination.
   But, he suggested that as ``an athlete'' he had been ``in
pressure situations before, maybe none this intense. But, look, all
I'll do is just stand up there and say what I believe about peace
and what I believe in about prosperity.''

   George Bush said he decided today on a
running mate for the fall campaign, but warned he would not ``play
the game of 20 questions'' to fuel speculation about whom he had
chosen in advance of an announcement later this week.
   As Bush flew from Washington here on Air Force Two, the
incumbent vice president said the long process of selection was
over.
   ``I had hoped to do it by the time I got on this airplane and I
have,'' Bush told reporters aboard the plane. ``The decision will
be announced before Thursday night.''
   He said the final phase in the process came ``just before I
climbed onto this plane. Today, with finality.''
   ``I want an opportunity to properly notify the person I will
nominate,' Bush said.
   Bush brushed aside complaints about his selection process.
   Sen. Bob Dole of Kansas, who has been at the top of many lists,
complained about the drawn-out process.
   ``I don't care for it, frankly,'' said Dole.
   ``I took no offense at that,'' Bush responded today.
   Another prospect, Rep. Jack Kemp, said today he didn't think the
procedures were demeaning.
   ``It's kept suspense in our convention,'' Kemp said on ABC's
``Good Morning America.'' ``I imagine George Bush is either close
to or has made up his mind and that is going to keep the suspense
alive.''
   The rumormongers were having a field day guessing, but no one in
New Orleans could say they knew whom Bush would tap this week.
   ``We didn't need rumor control,'' said Bush aide Rich Bond. ``It
is more like curiosity control.''
   The names on the rumor mill: Kemp; Dole; his wife Elizabeth;
Sens. Dan Quayle, Pete Domenici and Alan Simpson; Atty. Gen.
Richard Thornburgh and former White House Chief of Staff Howard
Baker.
   New names introduced by no one in particular were Sens. John
Danforth and Christopher Bond of Missouri.
   ``I am not running around trying to get it,'' said Domenici.
``But frankly, if it will help keep the momentum of the past few
years going...I guess it is fair to say I'd do about anything.''
   Quayle began to have second thoughts.
   ``From a personal standpoint, if I had a time in my life to be
vice president, I wouldn't choose this time,'' he said. ``If George
Bush thinks I can offer the most to the ticket ... Dan Quayle will
sign up immediately.''
   Baker, a former Tennessee senator, continued to deny he is under
consideration: ``My name's not on that list. ...I've made it
perfectly clear, I've no desire to be vice president.''
   Bush, in a well-orchestrated telephone call to campaign manager
Lee Atwater on the convention floor, did raise the possibility he
will unveil his choice a day ahead of schedule on Wednesday.
Atwater said Bush wanted to ``just leave it on Thursday ... but
flexible.''
   For one hopeful, the selection procedure has already dragged on
too long. Dole said he thought it might have been more valuable for
Bush to choose a running mate last month and not give Democratic
nominees Michael Dukakis and Lloyd Bentsen a head start for the
fall campaign.
   Aides to the Kansas senator rushed to say he was not criticizing
Bush. But the vice president had already heard of the comments from
the politician known for a sharp tongue.
   Dole said he suspects Bush ``has already made up his mind.''
   ``If you asked the question, I think that's not an unlikely
thing for him to say,'' said Bush deputy campaign manager Rich Bond
on the convention floor.
   In the Superdome, the hopefuls began their parade to the podium
with the opening of the convention Monday.
   First up were Kemp of New York, the choice of hard-line
conservatives, and former Transportation Secretary Elizabeth Dole.
Later in the week, Sens. Dole and Domenici will address the
delegates.
   Others named on various versions of Bush's list _ Quayle of
Indiana, Thornburgh, Baker _ were here Monday, but not to speak to
the convention.
   Sen. Simpson of Wyoming, who has asked off Bush's list, also
appeared at the podium and became the first speaker to answer the
Democratic question of ``Where was George?''
   ``The question is `Who's Mike?','' Simpson said, summing up the
GOP attacks on Dukakis into a campaign button slogan.
   Kemp, boosted by the most organized effort promoting a vice
presidential candidacy, resolutely declared he wants to be on the
GOP national ticket as he heaped praise on President Reagan and
Bush.
   Earlier in the day, Kemp had told supporters: ``I was a good
second-string quarterback, and I can be a good second-string
quarterback for George Bush.''
   Mrs. Dole, the remaining female on the list, used her convention
speech to talk directly to American women, who currently hold
negative views of Bush.
   ``Our strong economy has also provided needed jobs for millions
of women,'' the former Cabinet member said, ``And let me say to the
women of America: I respect the fact that some of you have
questions. I also ask you to have an open mind.''
   The other hopefuls varied in their attitudes toward a possible
national campaign.
   Thornburgh, in town to hear President Reagan's Monday speech,
remained coy when he asked about how he would respond to an offer
from Bush.
   ``I have no reason to think that's going to happen,'' he said.

   A maintenance man and his
clerical-worker wife today claimed a record $26 million lottery
jackpot with a ticket they said they kept on the family Bible.
   ``So I'd advise everybody to say your prayers. You don't win it
just on picking the numbers,'' said Marvin Davidheiser of Brandon,
who with his wife, Emily, collected the biggest jackpot since the
Florida lottery began in January.
   The Florida Lotto jackpot will pay the couple about $940,000 a
year, after taxes, for the next 20 years.
   They said the winning ticket was one of 40 they bought for Aug.
6 drawing and stacked on the Bible. Davidheiser said the winning
ticket was the last one the couple checked after the drawing, and
it rested directly on the Bible.
   The couple, who declined to give their ages, described
themselves as ``working people.'' Davidheiser is a building
maintenance man for a bus company. His wife is a clerk with the
Hillsborough County tax collector.
   The couple, who have three grown children, said they plan to
retire and travel. They said they waited more than a week to come
forward in order to take care of home-security matters, talk to
their accountant and make out a will.
   Mrs. Davidheiser said the winning ticket was among 20 she bought
for that week. Her husband of 11 years also bought 20, and said the
winning numbers were picked at random.
   Their accountant, Clinton Humphreys, said on Monday that he was
flying to Tallahassee with the winners but refused to identify them
in advance.
   ``They are a quiet, conservative couple and just wanted to make
sure everything was set before they claimed the money,'' Humphreys
told the Tampa Tribune.
   The couple have lived in the Brandon area for 15 years. ``They
really love where they live and are hoping that they don't have to
move because of all this,'' Humphreys said.

<HEAD>North Korea Calls Olympic Committee Proposal Unsatisfactory</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Korea-Students, Bjt</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   North Korea on Tuesday criticized the latest
proposal by the International Olympic Committee for its
participation in the Olympics, and said it will discuss being a
co-host of the Games in talks with South Korea.
   In a telegram to committee President Juan Antonio Samaranch, Kim
Yu Sun, president of the North Korean Olympic Committee, said his
country ``could never accept'' the proposal because separate teams
for North and South Korea in the Olympics ``would give the world
(a) more strong impression of `two Koreas' against the desire of
our nation for reunification.''
   The English text of the telegram was carried by the communist
country's official Korean Central News Agency and monitored in
Tokyo.
   Samaranch proposed last week that North and South Korea teams
march side by side in the opening and closing ceremonies next month
in Seoul, each carrying its own flag preceded by a single Olympic
flag.
   Samaranch said in messages to the Olympic committees of both
countries that this would be a ``highly symbolic event''
demonstrating a ``strong desire for dialogue and reconciliation.''
   South Korea welcomed the proposal, but North Korea has said it
will boycott the Games unless it is made a co-host on the grounds
that separate teams in a South Korean Olympics would perpetuate the
division of the Korean peninsula.
   The IOC has rejected formal co-host status for North Korea,
saying the Olympiad is awarded only to one city, but it has offered
to let the country hold five events in the Olympics.
   North Korea recently proposed the two nations' parliaments meet
to discuss the Sept. 17-Oct. 2 Olympics and a mutual non-aggression
pact between the two sides, divided since 1945.
   ``If good results are produced at the North-South joint
parliamentary meeting, we will inform you immediately for your
cooperation,'' Kim told Samaranch.
   No date has been set for the proposed joint parliamentary talks,
and South Korean lawmakers have said preparatory talks should be
held first to decide on an agenda and other matters.
   In addition to North Korea, five other countries have not yet
responded to invitations from the IOC to participate in this year's
Olympics: Cuba, Ethiopia, Nicaragua, Albania and the Seychelles.

   Insurgency-related incidents on
southern Mindanao Island have claimed the lives of 911 people this
year, the military said Tuesday.
   Maj. Gen. Manuel Cacanando, the military's southern commander,
told the state-run Philippine News Agency the victims included 352
members of the communist New People's Army.
   Since Jan. 1, 195 government troops also have been slain, he
said.
   Cacanando estimated that about 5,000 communist rebels operate on
Mindanao, in addition to various Moslem insurgent groups. He said
only about half the rebels are armed.

   Moslem rebels Tuesday
released an American and his Filipino wife 17 days after kidnapping
them on the southern island of Mindanao, military officials said.
   David Blair Stiffler, a construction worker from New York City,
and his wife, Elpidia, were turned over to military and police
units on the shore of Lake Lanao, 520 miles southeast of Manila,
according to Col. Carlos Pena, provincial commander of Lanao del
Sur province on Mindanao Island.
   The colonel said no ransom was paid.
   The couple were freed after the military issued an ultimatum
Monday that the kidnappers release the hostages by Tuesday or
troops would launch rescue operations.
   Lt. Col. Anthony Elias, a U.S. military spokesman, said the
kidnappers demanded a ransom of $7,500, which they later lowered to
$1,000. He confirmed no ransom was paid.
   Stiffler and his wife were driving a jeep near Lake Lanao, where
they were vacationing with friends, when they were abducted July 30
by insurgents of the Moro Islamic Liberation Front. The group has
been fighting since 1972 for Moslem rule on Mindanao and other
southern islands.
   The couple appeared in good health but were exhausted, Pena
said, adding that they were taken to a military camp in the
Mindanao city of Iligan before departing for Manila.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Federal Aviation Administration is doing a
poor job of managing restricted airspace used by military planes
and helicopters and has no way of judging if the Pentagon has too
much ``special-use airspace,'' according to the General Accounting
Office.
   ``The FAA is not effectively managing special-use airspace to
ensure its efficient and appropriate use,'' the congressional
watchdog agency says in a 43-page report. ``We acknowledge that
some improvement in the administration of special-use airspace has
recently occurred, but believe that serious and longstanding
problems continue to affect the program.''
   The study, conducted over an 18-month period and released on
Monday, was requested by Sen. Jesse A. Helms, R-N.C. The agency
cited Helms' state of North Carolina as well as California as two
areas where the conflict between military and civilian use of the
skies is becoming particularly sharp.
   According to the GAO, ``special use airspace consisted of
556,152 square miles, or about one-fifth, of the airspace within
the continental United States'' as of September 1987.
   The agency said that total excludes special-use areas off the
coastlines, but still represents a 22 percent increase in square
mileage compared to 1978, when 455,000 square miles were designated
special use.
   There are various categories of special use airspace, the agency
continued, ranging from a few ``prohibited areas'' that are
off-limits to all aircraft to ``restricted areas'' from which
civilian aircraft are barred, to ``alert areas,'' in which civilian
pilots are simply informed there is a high level of flight activity
occurring.
   The biggest problem with the current system is the FAA does not
require the Army, Navy, Air Force and Marine Corps to disclose in
some standardized way how frequently they use the airspace set
aside for them, the GAO said.
   ``The FAA does not have adequate utilization data for areas in
which hazardous flight training activities occur and requires no
data to be provided for other special use airspace areas,'' the
report says.
   That failure is particularly important given the results of a
Navy study conducted last year, the GAO continued. That study
focused on 191 special-use areas and found that during a two-month
period, they were utilized by military aircraft only about a
quarter of the available hours.
   ``Seven restricted and three military operations areas were not
utilized at all during the period,'' the GAO said.
   That Navy study also ``revealed that (restricted) airspace was
sometimes used for other than its intended purpose;'' for example,
for ``non-hazardous activities'' such as basic flight training.
   ``If the FAA is to effectively manage special-use airspace, it
needs to know where, when and how airspace is being utilized,'' the
GAO concluded.
   Making matters worse, ``even if the FAA had the data necessary
... it has not established guidance for its (regional offices) to
reduce or eliminate special-use airspace that is inefficiently or
inappropriately used,'' the GAO asserted.
   The FAA, in a written response to the GAO dated June 13,
generally concurred with the findings and said it would begin
trying to collect ``actual usage reporting data.''
   The agency said it also would ``take appropriate action to
periodically review the usage reports and ensure that the airspace
is being used for the designated purpose.''
   The Pentagon, in a separate response, said it is pursuing
development of a computerized airspace management system that
automatically would provide the FAA with the information it needed.
   Assistant Defense Secretary Gordon A. Smith cautioned, however,
that low levels of usage don't always mean that airspace
restrictions can be dropped.
   ``The military has requirements for special-use airspace that
may be used as little as three or four times a year,'' Smith wrote.
Only the Defense Department, he added, ``can accurately and
properly assess its needs in support of national security.''

   A time bomb exploded in a crowd of
commuters in the eastern port town of Trincomalee on Tuesday,
killing seven people and injuring 20, the military said.
   Tamil rebels were suspected of planting the bomb, and two were
killed in a reprisal attack.
   All those killed by the bomb were Sinhalese. Six were believed
to be government employees going to work, and the seventh was an
off-duty Sinhalese soldier, according to officials at Colombo's
military command who spoke on the condition they not be identified.
   The explosion occurred at the busy Clock Tower area of the city
where many government employees disembark from buses, the officials
said.
   Most of the government employees reporting for work in the city
belong to the Sinhalese community.
   Tamils refused to work for the government after a Sinhalese mob
killed three members of their community in the town on July 21.
   Last week, authorities ordered all employees to report to work
and promised them maximum protection, but the rebels challenged the
order and warned government staff against complying.
   The police in Trincomalee, about 150 miles northeast of Colombo,
imposed an unofficial curfew in the town area after the incidents.
   The bodies of two Tamils with gunshot wounds were found near the
Clock Tower.
   Tamils form 18 percent of Sri Lanka's 16 million people but are
in a majority in the island's north and east. Tamil radicals have
been agitating for an independent homeland since 1983, claiming
discrimination by the Sinhalese, who comprise 75 percent of the
population.

   A small defense contractor will not
fight a court order allowing Unisys Corp. to seize more than $1.17
million worth of military components, an attorney said today.
   Armtec Inc. had closed earlier this month, laying off about 80
employees, after Unisys withheld a payment, claiming it had been
overbilled.
   Unisys then sued Armtec, charging that the smaller firm might
move or damage components manufactured under contract with Unisys,
and U.S. District Judge Howell W. Melton issued an order Monday
allowing Unisys to seize the items.
   Armtec had said it would not comply until Unisys paid more than
$400,000 in unpaid bills.
   But Armtec attorney Mitchell Rogovin said in a telephone
interview from Washington today that a $2.34 million bond Melton
required Unisys to post will ensure Armtec will be paid any money
it is owed.
   ``We were holding it back because we hadn't been paid and they
wanted it back,'' Rogovin said. ``It was property they sent us and
labor we put into it.''
   Both companies are under scrutiny in the Pentagon bribery probe.
   Unisys said it sued to protect Navy radar equipment from being
damaged by humidity in the closed plant.
   Unisys is under contract to deliver the completed systems to the
Navy over roughly a two-year period beginning in February, and the
Navy has made fleet deployment decisions accordingly, the lawsuit
said.

   ``Moonlighting'' star Bruce Willis and
actress Demi Moore became the parents of a baby girl today, a
spokesman said.
   The as-yet unnamed, 8-pound, 1-ounce girl was delivered at a
Paducah, Ky., hospital shortly after 5 a.m. PDT (7 a.m. CDT),
spokesman Paul Bloch said.
   Bloch said Willis was at his wife's side during the natural

hospital within three hours.
   ``We are ecstatic,'' Willis, who is in Kentucky filming a movie,
was quoted as saying. ``The baby is very happy and healthy.''
   Willis, 33, and Miss Moore, 25, were married in November 1987
and live in Malibu.
   Miss Moore was in ``St. Elmo's Fire'' and ``About Last Night.''
Willis starred in the hit movie ``Die Hard'' and he resumes his
``Moonlighting'' duties as the wisecracking detective opposite
Cybill Shepherd this fall.
   He is filming the Warner Bros. drama ``In Country,'' about a
family struggling to heal the wounds of the Vietnam War.

<NOTE>Eds: SUBS 14th graf pvs, `Crews completed ...' to UPDATE with

<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Firefighters today moved toward reopening the west entrance of
Yellowstone National Park, where blazes involved more than 240,000
acres, and battled a wind-whipped forest fire in Montana to keep it
from some evacuated homes.
   Fires also continued to char parts of Colorado, Utah, Oregon and
Idaho.
   ``It's kind of a helpless situation,'' fire information officer
Jerry Chapman said in Montana.
   At Lame Deer, Mont., a rash of thunderstorms with winds up to 50
mph hit the fire on the Northern Cheyenne Indian Reservation on
Monday night, causing the blaze to rush three to four miles
northward in a few hours, Chapman said.
   ``It just blew (the fire) in about every direction imaginable,''
he said.
   Chapman said pumpers were stationed at homes near Lame Deer and
at other homes near the fire.
   At Yellowstone, firefighters today planned to use a special
aircraft known as a ``flying fishbowl'' to get a good look at the
fires.
   The U.S. Interior Department arranged with Airborne
Surveillance, a Sarasota, Fla., company, for a flight by the Optica
Scout over the park.
   The British-built aircraft has a range of vision of 270 degrees
vertically and 340 degrees horizontally.
   Park spokeswoman Amy Vanderbilt said officials hoped to open the
two roads today, a day after they were closed by a 53,000-acre
fire. Winds gusting to 40 mph pushed the fire toward the road to
the Old Faithful geyser area.
   In Colorado, a 50-acre brush fire started by an errant bullet at
Stone Canyon was contained Monday night as about 50 firefighters
battled the blaze.
   The fire that had threatened a residential area and Indian
burial ground. Jim Busse, 44, of Boulder, said he and his
17-year-old son, Bryan, were target shooting on his land when a
bullet from his .22-caliber pistol ricocheted off a rock, sparking
the blaze.
   Busse and his son tried to put out the blaze with shovels but
failed, then called for help.
   Crews extinguished an 1,166-acre blaze on eastern Utah's Ute
Indian Reservation, while firefighters completed lines around a
600-acre blaze on private land despite erratic winds that
repeatedly fanned flames today.
   A wave of thunderstorms brought the threat of more fires to
parched central and eastern Oregon, officials said.
   High winds and no precipitation prompted Nez Perce National
Forest officials to postpone the control of a 2,175-acre fire on
the Main Salmon River from Monday to Wednesday.
   And lightning was expected to ignite even more blazes at the Nez
Perce and the Payette forests in west-central Idaho.
   ``Every night we can count on getting hammered,'' said Mary
Zabinski, Nez Perce information officer.

<TEXT>
   Ronald Reagan and George Bush, staging a
political role reversal on the eve of Bush's nomination for
president, shook hands and wished each other well today in an
airport reunion rife with the symbolism of changing influence in
the Republican Party.
   ``Nancy and I want you to know you have all our support, all the
way, and all our love,'' Reagan told Bush and his wife, Barbara,
who had just arrived from Washington.
   With their military jets lined up on the tarmac at Belle Chasse
Naval Air Station on the outskirts of this convention city, Reagan
and Bush kept the ceremony short, but affectionate.
   ``It's time to accept the great challenge that you have left for
us and made possible, to build a better America,'' Bush told the
president whom he has served for nearly eight years.
   ``And I accept that challenge,'' the vice president added. ``We
look forward to writing the next chapter in America's freedom story
because America's mission is greatness, and I do not intend to
fail.''
   Reagan made light-hearted humor out of the unusual airport
get-together, saying the fire chief of New Orleans had declared the
city overcrowded and that ``he's not letting in a new Republican
until one leaves.''
   He also poked fun at the theatrics surrounding Bush's
decision-making on a vice presidential running mate, saying he'd
offered to show Bush where to find blackened redfish ``if he'd tell
me who's going to be the vice president.''
   ``I'm not sure he knows,'' Reagan told reporters who yelled
questions to the pair about the No. 2 spot on the ticket, as the
engines on Air Force One began roaring in preparation for the
Reagans' departure.
   Reagan was heading for California after delivering a
thanks-for-the-memories speech to the convention Monday night,
while Bush awaited a greeting rally in a Spanish Plaza along the
banks of the Mississippi River.
   Reagan had told the convention Monday night he wanted Bush to
``win one more for the Gipper'' and had said he would work hard for
Bush's election, although the president conceded that ``this office
is not mine to give.''
   Reagan's speech brought tears to longtime loyalists on the
convention floor. It capped a day in which both he and his wife,
Nancy, talked of relinquishing the political spotlight to Bush and
his wife, Barbara.
   ``There are times to enter, times to stay and times to leave,''
Mrs. Reagan told friends at a luncheon given in her behalf.
   ``Today, the curtain begins to close on the Reagan era of the
Republican Party,'' she said. ``We've had a wonderful run. But the
time has come for the Bushes to step into the political leading
roles _ and for the Reagans to step into the wings.''
   That same theme dominated Reagan's convention address, preceded
by a documentary about the Reagan years and heralded by trumpets
blaring ``Hail To The Chief.''
   Standing before the 2,277 convention delegates and thousands of
others in visitors' and alternates' seats, Reagan declared he still
would be heard, even in retirement.
   ``When I pack up my bags in Washington, don't expect me to be
happy to hear all this talk about the twilight of my life,'' said
Reagan, 77.
   ``Twilight? Not in America!''
   But Reagan also made clear that he doesn't desire to command the
party, saying, ``I'll leave my phone number and address behind just
in case you need a foot soldier.''
   Convention delegates frequently interrupted his speech with
applaue, waving banners and cheering. Reagan even got applause a
few times for things he said in the filmed narration of the Reagan
years.
   The delegates stood for several minutes and clapped their hands
as he arrived at the podium, and Reagan basked in the glory.
   ``Eight years ago, we gathered in Detroit in a troubled time for
our beloved country,'' he said. ``And we gathered solemnly to share
our dreams.''
   ``When our children turn the pages of our lives, I hope they'll
see that we had a vision to pass forward a nation as nearly perfect
as we could,'' he said.
   Reagan's speech contained little of the acerbic, indirect
criticism of Democratic presidential nominee Michael Dukakis that
was his theme upon his arrival Sunday.
   But Reagan did not let the Democrats off the hook, even poking
fun at one point at a Democratic convention speech in Atlanta by
Sen. Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts, which was built around the
rhetorical question of ``Where was George?''
   ``George played a major role in everything we've accomplished,''
he said. And in noting that Bush headed a presidential task force
on reducing the burden of government paperwork, he said, ``And
George was there.''
   ``With George Bush, I'll know, as we approach the new
millennium, our children will have a future secure with a nation at
peace and protected against aggression,'' he said.

<HEAD>Former President Announces Candidacy Two Days Before Election</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MOHAMMED SALAM</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Syrian-backed Christian who was
president when Lebanon's civil war began in 1975 said Tuesday he is
a candidate for president, creating a crisis two days before
Parliament is to make the choice.
   Suleiman Franjieh, 78, pledged to stop 13 years of bloodshed.
Some Lebanese see the election as a first step toward ending the
war.
   The Lebanese Forces, the main Christian militia and an opponent
of Syria, urged legislators not to elect a man ``who bears grudges
and whose accession to power would touch off the war anew.''
   Under an unwritten covenant in effect since Lebanon gained
independence from France in 1943, the president is a Christian, the
prime minister a Sunni Moslem and the speaker of Parliament a
Shiite Moslem.
   Franjieh's last-minute candidacy could delay Parliament's
election of a successor to President Amin Gemayel, whose
6-year-term expires Sept. 23. Right-wing Christian leaders,
including Gemayel, have said they would use all means to block
Franjieh's election if he announced for the office.
   Many Christians dislike Franjieh because of what they see as an
attempt by Moslem Syria to take over its small neighbor. Syria has
25,000 soldiers stationed in the Bekaa Valley of eastern and
northern Lebanon and more than 7,000 in west Beirut to keep the
peace among warring Moslem factions.
   ``I shall spare no effort ... to rescue the nation and safeguard
Lebanon's unity and independence as an Arab, democratic and free
country,'' Franjieh told a news conference at his home at Ehden in
the Christian stronghold of north Lebanon.
   He said his program was aimed at ``saving the nation and
building a new Lebanon'' and that ``can only be achieved through
national entente.''
   The Lebanese Forces issued its statement after a special meeting
of the high command.
   ``Suleiman Franjieh is a confrontational candidate,'' the
statement said. ``His election would rekindle the war and would
lead to the partitioning of the country as well as obliterating all
chances of national entente to end the civil war.''
   It did not say whether the militia would use force to prevent
Franjieh's election, but urged Parliament to choose a
``reconciliatory president who could lead the nation out of its
current impasse and bring about national entente.''
   Franjieh, like Gemayel a Maronite Catholic, was president in
1970-1976. When the Moslem-Christian civil war began April 13,
1975, he requested Syrian military intervention to stop it and
Syrian troops have been in Lebanon since.
   Word that Franjieh would seek a new term with Syria's blessing
was leaked last week.
   He holds Samir Geagea, leader of the Lebanese forces, personally
responsible for killing his eldest son Tony, the younger Franjieh's
wife and 3-year-old daughter and 30 bodyguards in a raid on Ehden
in June 1978.

<HEAD>China to Raise Interest Rates</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN POMFRET</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   China said Tuesday it is raising its interest
rates, which have remained at about the same level since the 1950s,
to fight inflation, end panic buying and encourage investment.
   A spokesman for the People's Bank of China said on nationwide
television news that on Sept. 1, general loan rates would go up
from 7.92 percent to 9 percent. In a break with the past, he said
that when risks appear higher the interest rates would increase.
   Saving account interest rates will vary, he said. Rates on
one-year accounts, for example, will go from 7.2 percent to 8.64
percent while those on 10-year accounts will go up from 10.44
percent to 12.42 percent.
   The influential Economic Daily on Monday published a front-page
editorial calling for a rise in interest rates to keep in step with
inflation, the highest since Communist China was established in
1949, and to encourage investment, which is dropping off.
   Since 1985, the paper said, retail prices have soared 23.7
percent, but interest rates are about the same as they were in the
1950s. It said the low rates combined with high inflation had
caused panic buying throughout China.
   The paper cited the case of a worker in the central city of
Wuhan who bought enough salt to last his family for 10 years.
Another family from Changzhou in the Yangtze River valley ``in one
shot bought 1,100 pounds of rice,'' it said.
   The report said low interest rates and easy credit were also
responsible for a run on bank loans by Chinese businesses.
   By raising interest rates, China hopes to get people and firms
not to spend money on food and consumer items but to channel it
into production and investment.
   Two Chinese sources said Monday that China would raise interest
rates and, to stave off growing discontent in the cities, give
workers a large raise and link further pay increases to the
inflation rate.
   The sources, both of whom recently attended top government
meetings, said the proposals were made by liberal-minded reformers
allied with Communist Party chief Zhao Ziyang.
   They said Premier Li Peng, Vice Premier Yao Yilin and other
conservatives have called for a complete freeze on reforms which
are slowly opening the economy to market forces.
   The sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, estimated the
average worker's annual salary of $246 would rise between 8 percent
and 28 percent.
   In the last 10 years, China has pushed far-reaching economic
reforms aimed at ending state controls over prices and allowing the
value of goods to be controlled by the market.
   The elimination of low, government-fixed prices has caused high
inflation as the inefficient economy fails to keep up with rising
consumer demand. An active black market and the hoarding of goods
still sold at government-set prices has exacerbated the problem.

   The small number of demonstrators at the
Republican National Convention is an indication that George Bush's
critics don't think he'll be elected, one protester says.
   ``There's no turnout, because everybody thinks George Bush is a
goner,'' said Dana Beal, who describes himself as a 41-year-old
career protester from New York City.
   Absent so far are large groups of protesters who traditionally
turn out at national political conventions. Instead, those here
appear to be part of a loose network of people who go from one
convention-related event to another staging small demonstrations.
   Today, about 20 protesters held up signs and shouted in front of
IMREG Inc., a pharmaceutical company which manufactures one of the
few promising drugs effective in the treatment of acquired immune
deficiency syndrome or AIDS.
   Demonstrators said they objected to the federal government's
bureaucratic red tape that has delayed the release of drugs to
treat AIDS.
   Six demonstrators were arrested Monday at a rally for evangelist
Pat Robertson. Others got into a shoving match with police outside
the Superdome.
   About 20 demonstrators marched with a police escort down Poydras
Street, near the Superdome, to protest the U.S. presence in the
Persian Gulf.
   But things were quiet about six blocks away at Lafayette Park,
the designated free-speech and demonstration gathering place for
the convention.
   The stage built for protesters was empty all morning and much of
Monday afternoon. Police assigned there milled around and sought
relief from the sweltering Louisiana summer.
   Late in the day, a handful of protesters held an open-mike forum
to criticize the Republican party and banged on pots with sticks.
Police stopped a young Republican from stepping onto the stage to
debate the demonstrators.
   ``We didn't expect this, but we didn't expect a big crowd,
either,'' police Lt. R.A. Paisant said of the sparse crowds. ``I
don't think there's any real issue right now to unite people.''
   Moreover, he said, people in New Orleans ``are known to be
followers, not leaders, and there is no one here to unite them.''
   Beal said the small number of demonstrators reflected a
``marketing decision.''
   ``A decision was made by the communication networks not to
mobilize and do this,'' he said. ``The single-issue groups are here
but not `the left' as a group, so you lack a coalition.''
   For his part, Beal said he will return to New York City on
Wednesday.
   ``There are other more important things going on,'' he said,
citing the Tompkins Square Park riot Aug. 7 in which residents near
the New York City park went on a rampage when police tried to
enforce a 1 a.m. park curfew.
   Beal said many of his friends canceled plans to demonstrate at
the New Orleans convention to work for neighborhood changes
following the riot.

Brown</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ROANOKE, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Golf course operators say a bad batch of
fungicide turned greens brown at several courses on the East Coast,
a newspaper reported today.
   An unidentified spokesman for the product's distributor, PBI
Gordon Corp. of Kansas City, Mo., told the Roanoke Times &
World-News that the fungicide had been recalled.
   The newspaper said the fungicide was manufactured by Drexel
Chemical Co. of Memphis, Tenn., and marketed under several names.
Golf courses apply the chemical to kill pythium, a fungus that
thrives in hot, humid weather.
   Alan Paschang, PBI Gordon vice president for administration, did
not immediately return a telephone call this morning.
   A secretary at Drexel said no one was available for comment for
the rest of the week.
   At least four Virginia courses were affected, and one owner said
that he lost about 25 percent of his green space and that he
believed at least 50 other courses were affected.
   ``We're in about the best shape of anybody I know of,'' said
E.A. Stephens, owner of Tides Lodge in Irvington.
   The Times & World-News said golf courses in Maryland,
Pennsylvania and New Jersey also had their greens damaged and some
said they were losing money.

<HEAD>Indigent AIDS Patients Left Out In Cold After Fund Cut For AZT
Program</HEAD>

   A program that administered the drug AZT for free
to 130 indigent AIDS patients will lose its federal funding next
month, and officials say that will completely cut off the treatment
for 66 of those patients.
   The federal Health Resources and Services Administration
provided $587,000 to the state on a one-time basis to assist those
patients who do not receive Medicaid and are not covered by health
insurance.
   The money, part of a $30 million appropriation under the 1987
Supplemental Appropriations Act, runs out Sept. 30.
   AZT has been shown to relieve certain symptoms in those
suffering from acquired immune deficiency syndrome or AIDS-related
complex, but it is not a cure for the fatal disease.
   ``Without this treatment, many people who are poor and sick now
run the risk of a considerably shortened life span,'' Dr. Joseph
Wilber, medical consultant for the state Department of Human
Resources, said Monday.
   Treatment for 220 medically indigent AIDS victims in Georgia was
provided under the program beginning October 1987. Ninety of them
have died, moved away, become eligible for Medicaid or were unable
to take the drug, DHR officials said.
   Wilber said 64 of the remaining patients would be eligible to
continue AZT treatment at Grady Memorial Hospital in Atlanta, which
provides care for poor people who live in Fulton and DeKalb
counties.
   But 66 others will no longer be able to get treatment because
they are not residents of the area Grady covers, Wilber said.
   ``Those who live in smaller towns where there is no charity
hospital are just going to be cut off,'' he said.
   Wilber said some AIDS victims could seek assistance through
Medicaid, but he cautioned that Medicaid pays for treatment only
when patients are ``extremely poor,'' and even then few qualify.
   He speculated that some patients would relocate to Fulton or
DeKalb in order to receive treatment at Grady.
   Wilber said the state bought AZT in bulk at an annual cost of
$6,566 per patient. Grady Hospital would have to buy the drug at a
yearly cost of $8,000 to $10,000 per patient, and would ultimately
pay an estimated $1 million per year to continue the AZT program,
he said.
   DHR officials said there were 1,493 AIDS cases reported in
Georgia as of June 1988, with 841 deaths.

   The Lake Bluff Precision Lawn Mower
Drill Team is looking to draft a few hot prospects for its 16th
season.
   However, organizers warn that standards are high and the field
crowded _ also, presumably, closely cropped.
   ``The popularity of lawn mowing and the drill team has led to an
unprecedented demand for admittance to this elite unit,'' says the
team's tongue-in-cheek press release.
   ``There have been attempts to bribe the selection committee to
gain entry.''
   Candidates should be equipped with a strong sense of the absurd.
   And a lawn mower. Anything goes, says attorney Robert O'Neill, a
team member.
   ``Some are push, some are power, some are old, some are new,''
he said.
   The team's big day is the Fourth of July and the annual parade
in this north Chicago suburb, when mowers are pushed through a
choreographed drill, in concentric circles and figure eights, lines
weaving in and out, as members offer a commentary on current events.
   The recruiting drive was prompted by a dwindling in the ranks
from 14 to 11, with two members moving away and a third giving up
the little touch of show business because of a bum knee.
   Applicants are asked if they could take the physical pace, if
their jobs would permit appearances on national news programs, and
if their passports are in order.
   They're also asked:
   _``Would you be willing to donate time as a hall monitor at the
Lake Buff (sic) Children's Home during the off season?'' The home
was closed 10 years ago and torn down, O'Neill notes.
   _``Would you be able to attend the Grand National Mow-Off
against the TORO, TORO, TOROs in Casa Grande, Arizona, on August
19, 1989?''
   The city and the California mower team exist, but O'Neill says
no competition has been set.
   _``Briefly critique James Thurber's short story entitled `The
Unicorn in the Garden.'''
   Applications are also being distributed ``world-wide,'' a team
statement notes.
   Actually, O'Neill says, one member took a couple of the forms
along on a vacation to Australia.
   Prospective members also are advised that the unit has won
``numerous local, national and international awards for its
intricate marching routines and its elegant costumes and
impersonations.''
   That's malarkey, too, but ``we have a great time,'' O'Neill says.
   The team was started as a joke, a spoof of the costumed
Shriners' precision motorcycle units.
   ``Then as it got rolling, and people got more interested, we
started spending more time to do what we had to do to put on a good
show,'' O'Neill said.
   One year, members dressed as Arab sheiks for a commentary on an
oil shortage. At another parade, they dressed up as brides after a
movie called ``The Wedding'' was shot in their village of 5,000.
   Last year they traded their mowers for chain saws.
   The occasion? The uproar generated when Mr. T, star of ``The
A-Team'' television series, had some trees cleared from his Lake
Forest estate.
   Dignity is not the team's strong suit, however.
   ``One year they had a boy running ahead, screaming `The mowers
are coming, the mowers are coming,''' said waitress Margaret Abel,
58, named this year's ``mower mother'' by team members who frequent
the restaurant where she works.
   She keeps the application forms on hand.
   ``It makes good reading when you've had a few cocktails,'' Mrs.
Abel says.

<DATELINE>PINEVILLE, Mo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A homeless, unemployed former factory
worker has kept a vigil for three months on the bandstand in the
shadow of the McDonald County Courthouse, saying he's determined to
get justice.
   But many residents of Pineville, a town of 500 some 30 miles
south of Joplin in extreme southwest Missouri, see 60-year-old Tom
Daywalt as more ragged exhibitionist than righteous protester.
   During Jesse James Days in July, the Chamber of Commerce wrapped
the front and sides of the bandstand in sheets of bright blue
plastic to hide Daywalt and then parked a flatbed trailer in front
of it as a replacement stage.
   (That annual celebration isn't what you might think. It
commemorates the 1938 filming of a movie about the outlaw in
Pineville.)
   The plastic remains on the bandstand, providing Daywalt some
protection from the sun and rain and allowing passers-by to avoid
his almost courtly ``good afternoon.''
   Chamber of Commerce members who had donated the bandstand to the
city had a judge order Daywalt removed temporarily on June 29. But
on July 5 doctors at Nevada State Hospital said he was competent;
McDonald County Circuit Judge George Henry ruled the bandstand was
public property and Daywalt could not be barred.
   Daywalt moved to the bandstand May 11 complaining he was treated
unfairly after arrests on trespassing charges last winter and
spring.
   He vowed to stay until he is granted a trial on a charge that
was dismissed in April. He said dismissal is not enough; he wants
to prove his innocence.
   He leaves only to use the courthouse restroom. Some townspeople
bring him food and water, but what the divorced father of three
grown children seems to crave most is conversation.
   ``When you've been here three months, you really appreciate it.
There are some that won't even walk on this side of the
courthouse,'' Daywalt said. He has had no contact with his children
and fought an attempt to place him in custody of a daughter.
   He seems comfortable, despite the fleece-lined denim jacket, two
sweaters and work boots he wears in the 90-degree heat. He has a
roof and lights at night. He sleeps on a wooden bench, using a
cardboard box containing his Bible and a copy of the Constitution
as a pillow.
   He said he is a Jehovah's Witness and trusts Jehovah to sustain
him until he is granted a trial. ``He told me `sit upon this
bench,' and that's where I've been ever since,'' Daywalt said.
   Daywalt had one day in court Jan. 15 and represented himself. He
was convicted of trespassing, sentenced to three days in jail and
credited with time served.
   Daywalt had been arrested on the porch of a home from which he
had been evicted in nearby Lanagan. Court records said deputies
arrested him Dec. 21 as much for his health in the freezing weather
as to uphold the law.
   Daywalt, who said he has worked in factories and construction
but now describes himself as a Bible student and teacher, returned
to the porch after his conviction.
   According to court records, he was charged once more with
trespassing. After being jailed for nearly four months awaiting
trial, the charge was dismissed by County Prosecutor Ben Hormel.
Hormel has said the charge will not be refiled but refused to be
interviewed about Daywalt.
   Others in Pineville seemed weary of talking about Daywalt, and
resentment is evident, as in T-shirts for sale that depict Daywalt
with the legend ``the great Pineville hold-up.''
   Teen-agers have thrown eggs and yelled insults, but the worst
Daywalt faces now are glares from a few passers-by.
   ``I doubt very seriously that anybody would do him any harm,''
said one man, who asked not to be identified. But ``he could die
out there of a heart attack or stroke or whatever. What I would do
is take him up to the court and give him about 15 minutes to tell
his story. I think it's a problem that should be resolved.''

<TEXT>
   Joe ``Tiger Joe'' Walcott, who trained three
world heavyweight boxing champions, including Joe Frazier, has
died. He was 85.
   Walcott, a lightweight, boxed about 200 fights before becoming a
trainer in the 1930s. He died Sunday.
   Walcott trained Frazier early in Frazier's career, Jersey Joe
Walcott, whose real name was Arnold Cream, and Earnie Terrell.
   It wasn't clear whether Jersey Joe Walcott took the name of his
trainer or another legendary Joe Walcott, a three-time welterweight
champion from the turn of the century, said Tiger Joe's son Raymond
Walcott.
   Jersey Joe lost his heavyweight title to Rocky Marciano in 1951,
and Terrell was stripped of his title in 1967 by Muhammad Ali.
   ``He taught the how to live outside the ring,'' Raymond Walcott
said of his father. ``He'd lend you money. He brought kids out of
the street. He was a teacher, and they got guidance from him.''
   Surivors include his wife, six children, 19 grandchildren and a
number of great-grandchildren.
   Services were scheduled for Wednesday.

<TEXT>
   A mountain climber stopped a cablecar
that crosses Europe's highest glaciers for about two hours Tuesday
to protest what he called exploitation of the area.
   Reinhold Messner climbed a pylon of the Mount Blanc cableway to
hang a yellow banner with the symbol of the environmentalist group
Mountain Wilderness.
   The Italian alpinist, known for scaling the Himalayan peaks
Mount Everest and K2, and other Mountain Wilderness members contend
the cableway should be dismantled and the area turned into a
natural park.
   The cablecar, a popular tourist attraction, unites Punta
Helbronner on the Italian side of Mount Blanc to the French side of
Aguille du Midi. Messner hung the banner at the 12,140-foot level.
   Italian and French police did not try to stop Messner's
demonstration, which had been widely publicized.

<TEXT>
   The State Department, firing a new blast at
the Soviet Union, today accused Moscow of spurning U.S. requests
for help in the removal of mines from Afghanistan.
   ``We have contacted the Soviet Union on several occasions at a
high level to request Soviet cooperation with the U.N. effort to
clear the millions of mines that have been strewn throughout
Afghanistan,'' spokeswoman Phyllis Oakley said.
   ``The Soviet Union has been specifically asked to provide maps
of minefields. The U.N. has also been in touch with the Soviet
government on this problem,'' she said. ``To date we're not aware
of any significant Soviet effort to remove mines.''
   A Soviet spokesman in Moscow said earlier the Soviets had not
deployed the mines and were, indeed, helping to remove them.
   But Mrs. Oakley did not back away from a statement Monday by
spokesman Charles E. Redman that mines left in place by the Soviets
and the Afghan army were ``a big problem for the refugees as they
contemplate returning'' to the war-torn country.
   Many of the mines, Redman said, are disguised as toys; many
others are so-called ``butterfly'' explosives that cause limited
damage. But the overall total, which he placed at 10 million to 30
million, amounts to 1 to 3 mines for every Afghan.
   ``These mines are strewn throughout the countryside and so it's
difficult to come up with a precise figure,'' he said.
   Redman said the mines were deployed by the Soviet Army and by
the Afghan forces engaged in an 8{-year war with U.S.-backed
guerrillas.
   ``The United Nations is exerting strong leadership in
encouraging a program of mine-awareness and mine-detection,'' the
U.S. official said.
   He suggested, however, there was not much the United States
could do right now to help _ and that the Soviets were not
identifying the locations of the dangerous devices.
   ``I am not aware of any assistance of that kind,'' Redman said.
``But, again, I guess I'd have to refer to the United Nations for a
definitive readout on that.''
   In Moscow today, Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady I. Gerasimov
denied the U.S. allegation.
   ``We would like to state again that we are not involved in any
mining,'' Gerasimov said, adding that Soviet soldiers have been
helping Afghans remove and defuse mines planted by opposition
forces along major roads.
   There were up to 115,000 Soviet troops in Afghanistan until the
Red Army began to withdraw under the Geneva agreement between the
pro-Moscow government in Kabul and neighboring Pakistan, which
funneled U.S. missiles and other arms to guerrilla factions.
   Half of the Soviet troops were supposed to be gone by Monday.
While the State Department reserved judgment until the results of
inspections were tallied, Redman was authorized to provide an
encouraging account.
   ``I would offer just two observations,'' he said. ``We have seen
evidence of an accelerated Soviet departure from Afghanistan over
the past few weeks. And, second, all of eastern and southern
Afghanistan now appear to be free of Soviet forces.''
   Based on U.S. information in hand, Redman said, ``We don't
really have anything that would suggest that they're not'' adhering
to their commitment.
   The Soviets moved into Afghanistan in December 1979 to support a
pro-Moscow government at war with the U.S.-aided guerrillas.
   The fighting presumably will continue, however, but possibly
without American weapons for the rebels if Moscow suspends its
arming of the Afghan government. Redman declined to predict the
outcome.
   In the meantime, Redman said, ``Our support to the mujahedeen
continues'' as they fight the government of President Najibullah
which ``doesn't enjoy popular support.''
   Beyond that, the U.S. spokesman said, ``I don't think we're at a
position where we could pinpoint what the future of the Afghan
government is going to be, what it's going to look like.''
   Many of the guerrillas, called ``freedom fighters'' by the
Reagan administration, are fundamentalist Moslems with an outlook
similar to that of the governing powers in nearby Iran.
   Last month, some U.S. officials were concerned about the pace of
the Soviet pullout. They said Soviet military leaders had found
withdrawing under rebel fire difficult and that the Soviet military
commander in Kabul had indicated that thousands of new troops would
be sent to the embattled country.
   The commander's remarks were conveyed to President Mohammad Zia
al-Haq of Pakistan by the United Nations team that is monitoring
the Red Army's withdrawal.
   Zia then touched off alarm bells with a statement that the
Soviets ``decided not only to stop their withdrawal, but they have
brought in something like 10,000 troops back from the Soviet Union
into Kabul because Kabul was under threat.''
   Several U.S. officials who were watching the situation closely
said, however, there was no hard evidence that troops were
returning to Afghanistan, although meeting the Aug. 15 deadline
could be difficult.
   The Soviet military commander in Kabul may have spoken without
the authorization of his superiors in Moscow or he may have been
trying to unsettle the Pakistanis, who channeled U.S. weapons to
the rebels and took in hundreds of thousands of Afghan refugees,
officials said.
   ``We may never understand what happened,'' one U.S. official
said. ``Maybe the Soviet general was speaking prematurely or they
were trying to get the Pakistanis off balance when he made the
statement to Zia.''
   In any event, ``The basic fact of the matter is there is no
evidence of a re-introduction of Soviet troops,'' said the
official, who, like others, spoke on condition of anonymity.

   A new roller coaster at the Cedar Point
amusement park will be the highest and fastest such ride in the
world, officials announced Tuesday.
   Speed on the Magnum XL 200 will exceed 70 mph when riders drop
at a 60-degree angle from 201 feet above the ground on the first
hill to less than 10 feet. The all-steel ride is to be unveiled
next May.
   ``We wanted to go after the record for speed. But then we
started calculating the force of gravity and angle of descent and
realized it would have to be the biggest roller coaster,'' said
spokeswoman Melinda Huntley.
   The world's present highest roller coaster, the Shock Wave at
Six Flags of Great America in Gurnee, Ill., has a first drop of 170
feet.
   It will be Cedar Point's eighth roller coaster and its most
expensive ride at $8 million.

   Thousands of Elvis Presley fans toured the
King's white-columned estate, lay floral teddy bears and guitars
near his grave and bought Elvis memorabilia today to mark the 11th
anniversary of his death.
   ``I'm here because he lived here,'' said Samantha Fraser, 20, of
Morden, England. ``He's just so brilliant and wonderful.''
   Miss Fraser came for the Elvis anniversary with a group of 190
visitors from Great Britain. ``I was 6 years old when I saw the
first (Elvis) film, and I fell in love,'' she said.
   A capacity crowd of 4,000 tourists and fans was expected to tour
Presley's former residence, Graceland, during the day, said Stacey
Sheppard, a Graceland spokeswoman.
   More than 70 stands of flowers, many shaped like guitars, hearts
or teddy bears, lined a walk beside the grave.
   Graceland managers said fans have been upset this year by jokes
fanned by a new book, ``Is Elvis Alive?'' The book theorizes that
Elvis isn't dead; he is only taking a career break. The rumors have
not affected activities, however.
   The observance began Monday with a candlelight, graveside
procession.
   ``Elvis, we miss you tonight. We will love you today, tomorrow
and forever,'' June Klein of North Lewisburg, Ohio, said during a
memorial program that began the late-night procession past the
singer's grave.
   The stands of flowers lined a walk beside the grave. Many of the
dozens of Elvis fan clubs around the country traditionally schedule
their floral arrangements to arrive on Aug. 16, the day Presley
died.
   The procession, which began at 10:30 p.m. Monday, was expected
to draw more than 5,000 participants. Police estimated a crowd of
3,000 at the Graceland gates waiting for the affair to get under
way.
   Laurie Cousins of Winnipeg, Canada, arrived at the gates at noon
Monday to be first in line. She said the long, hot wait in the
99-degree temperature was worth it.
   ``It's an honor to be first, and to look back and see all those
candles lit is just unbelievable,'' she said.
   Also in the crowd were Ray and Angela Campione of New York, and
their 5-year-old son, Paul Elvis Campione, who wore a white,
bejeweled jumpsuit and struck Elvis poses to the delight of the
other fans.
   Asked why he's an Elvis fan, the child replied, ``He's a nice
man, and I like his music and he gives to the poor children.''
   Presley died of heart disease at Graceland in 1977, and the
faithful return by the hundreds each year to mark the anniversary.
   The graveside procession is the largest event of a nine-day
celebration called ``Elvis International Tribute Week,'' organized
and promoted by managers of Graceland. More than 35,000 people are
expected to tour Graceland during the week.
   With Elvis recordings playing in the background, the fans queued
up to touch candles to a torch lighted by an eternal flame, and to
walk single file up a winding, 200-yard driveway past Presley's
grave beside the Graceland swimming pool.
   ``It helps keep his memory alive,'' said Gene Carothers of
Gnadenhutten, Ohio, who sported an Elvis pompadour and a
6-inch-wide leather belt with dangling loops of chain.

   The irony of playing host to the Republican
National Convention in a city that missed the prosperity of the
Reagan years isn't lost on New Orleans Mayor Sidney Barthelemy.
   ``That was another reason to have the convention here _ maybe
they owed it to us,'' said Barthelemy, a Democrat.
   Louisiana's unemployment rate has been No. 1 or 2 in the country
for the last three years.
   It was such an issue in the 1983 governor's race that Edwin
Edwards pledged to reject his $73,000 annual salary until the
state's joblessness dropped below the national average.
   Edwards served his last four years gratis.
   It will be an issue in the November election, said former Rep.
Henson Moore, R-La., who lost a bid for the Senate in 1986, the
year the President Reagan's coattails didn't hold too many
candidates.
   Moore said his defeat in 1986 was a message to the Reagan
administration. Oilmen wanted an oil import fee, but the
administration refused to approve the tariff.
   ``I don't believe (voters) are going to blame Bush like they did
me and Reagan in 1986,'' Moore said. ``But Louisiana is going to be
a difficult state and (Bush) is going to have to work hard to carry
it.''
   Overall, Louisiana's fortunes began to tumble with the price of
oil on the world market in 1982. An estimated 152,000 jobs have
been lost since then.
   A decreased demand for south Louisiana petrochemical products
and the competition from Canada with north Louisiana timber
exacerbated the problem.
   In June 1979, Louisiana's unemployment rate was 7.6 percent; in
New Orleans, it was 7.0 percent. The national rate was 5.6 percent,
according to Allen Johnson, spokesman for the state Department of
Labor.
   Louisiana was ``on a knife's edge between inflation and
recession,'' said a June 1979 LSU Business Review. The state was
cut by recession.
   New Orleans' out-of-work peaked at 11.7 percent in February
1985, he said. The state was at its worst since the Great
Depression with a 14.5 percent jobless rate on January 1987,
Johnson said.
   In June 1988, the state logged in with 10.5 percent unemployed,
nearly twice the national rate of 5.5 percent. New Orleans was only
slightly better at 9.3 percent out of work.
   ``We have not been treated particularly poorly by the federal
government,'' said Dr. Michael Conte, associate director of the
Division of Business and Economic Research at the University of New
Orleans.
   For example, he said, federal government employment increased by
8 percent over the last five years. In New Orleans, the rate of
growth for federal jobs was 7.4 percent.

   Soviet historians and officials on Tuesday
defended the 1940 takeover of the Baltic states as necessary for
the survival of the Soviet Union at a time when it was isolated and
insecure at the brink of World War II.
   ``It had to be decided `to be or not to be.' We had an
opportunity to choose the least of the evils and understandably we
opted for the `to be' part,'' said Valentin M. Falin, chairman of
the Novosti press agency.
   At a news briefing, Falin never acknowledged that Estonia,
Lithuania and Latvia were forcibly incorporated into the Soviet
Union. Instead, he referred to ``the transfer of the Baltic states
to the north.''
   Falin was one of six panelists at the briefing who seemed to
defend the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact without acknowledging its
existence.
   The pact between the Soviet Union and Germany was signed Aug.
23, 1939, by Soviet Foreign Minister Vyacheslav Molotov and German
Foreign Minister Joachim Ribbentrop. It promised non-aggression
between the two countries and _ in a secret provision _ paved the
way for the Soviet takeover of the three independent Baltic states
and the German invasion of Poland.
   The Estonian newspaper Voice of the Nation and Estonian radio
last week disclosed details of the agreement for the first time in
the Soviet media. Although residents of the Baltic states generally
know of the agreement, some had been pressing for its publication
on the basis that the Soviet Union should own up to its existence.
   Activists view the pact as proof that the Baltics were
incorporated forcibly into the Soviet Union.
   The panelists at the briefing, organized by Novosti, said the
documents published by the Estonian newspaper have not been
authenticated and they knew of no plans to publish them in Latvia
or Lithuania as well.
   ``The attempts to find original versions have failed,'' Falin
said. ``The copies published in the press _ do they reflect what is
real? This is unknown.''
   Nationalist sentiment in the Baltic republics has risen,
especially since Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev introduced his
policy of greater openness in the country three years ago.
   Last year, Lithuanian, Estonian and Latvian activists
demonstrated on the 48th anniversary of the pact. Rallies are
expected for the 49th anniversary next week.
   Falin said Josef Stalin believed the Germans intended to expand
north by way of the Baltics, rather than westward. He said
anti-communist sentiment was at a peak in the 1930s, making Europe
and the United States distrustful of the Soviet Union.
   ``Since 1933 and 1934, the Soviet Union had been trying to set
up a system of collective security in Europe. Regrettably, the idea
was countered at the official level by negative reaction against
Soviets,'' Falin said.
   ``It was considered better (by Western powers) to lose
Czechoslovakia than to save it at the hands of the Soviet Union.
The world thought was not to let the Soviet Union participate in
major international decisions,'' he said.
   Falin characterized Polish rule at the time as ``bourgeois and
semi-fascist'' and claimed the Poles and Germans were negotiating a
possible joint action against the Soviet Union.
   The three panelists who were from the Baltics said some the
republics' citizens, but not the majority, opposed the Soviet
Union's move into their region.
   Baltic nationalists say the Soviets moved masses of troops into
the republics. When Soviet soldiers outnumbered native Baltic
citizens, elections incorporating the countries into the Soviet
Union were held.
   ``Estonians and Latvians fought for socialism,'' said Olaf
Kuuli, a history professor from the Estonian capital of Tallinn.
``But they wanted a true socialism. Unfortunately, not all of those
hopes came true. We know that the socialist system was deformed and
that the purges of Stalin and the mass deportations at the time
were true.''
   Stalin had thousands of native Baltic citizens deported because
he said they were Nazi collaborators or otherwise anti-Soviet.
Kuuli called for the rehabilitation of those accused by Stalin of
being disloyal.
   Falin said Stalin had to make decisions about handling the
Baltic states under ``extraordinary conditions,'' and should not be
second-guessed.
   ``To paint him black and criticize everything that had to do
with him or his decisions I do not think will do any service to the
truth,'' the Novosti chief said.
   ``Stalin pursued a course for the protection of the state
interest as he understood the state interest. Do we have the right
to say today that there was this and this alternative that was
never taken?''
   Also at the briefing were Erik Zagar, a Latvian historian; Romas
Sarmaitis, department head of the Party History Institute under the
Lithuanian Communist Party Central Committee; historian M.I.
Semiryaga; and L.A. Bezymensky, a historian and political analyst
for New Times magazine.

   Michael Dukakis today borrowed President
Reagan's ``facts are stubborn things'' line in listing what he said
were Reagan administration problems that would become the central
issues in the presidential campaign.
   The Democratic presidential nominee pointed to today's
announcement that the June trade deficit had widened dramatically,
to recent prime rate increases and to a report earlier in the year
that serious crime had risen around the nation.
   ``Facts are stubborn things and these are the facts that we are
going to be debating,'' Dukakis told reporters. ``It will be Mr.
Bush who has to respond to these facts.''
   Reagan, in his address to the Republican National Convention
Monday night, had repeated his 1984 list of Democratic
shortcomings, prefacing each with ``facts are stubborn things.''
   Dukakis dismissed Reagan's criticism of Democrats as the party
of inflation, saying, ``It's the administration that has to defend
itself'' against new inflationary pressures.
   ``We are back in an inflationary spiral,'' Dukakis told a
meeting of newspaper editors from central Massachusetts. ``It's the
direct result of eight years of fiscal irresponsibility.''
   ``The vice president is going to have to defend'' the Reagan
fiscal record, Dukakis said. ``I don't know how he is going to do
it.''
   Dukakis also attacked Bush on the environment, saying,
``Republicans came to Washington bound and determined to destroy
the EPA (Environmental Protection Agency)'' and that ``the vice
president was part of that.''
   ``This administration's record on the environment is zero,'' he
said.
   He also denounced Reagan for vetoing the defense authorization
bill, saying the president made a ``strictly political veto'' of a
measure that had broad bipartisan support.
   ``Now we've got mass confusion in addition to all the scandal,''
Dukakis said. ``That's not the way you build a strong America.''
   On Monday, Dukakis said leadership, and not Republican
name-calling, will determine the winner in November.
   ``I don't think it's going to do any political damage,'' the
Democratic presidential nominee said of the Dukakis-bashing taking
place at the GOP gathering in New Orleans.
   The Massachusetts governor dismissed the criticism, and
predicted Reagan's personal popularity will not give much of a
boost to Bush.
   Dukakis cited an `L' word of his own _ leadership _ to counter
the ``liberal'' tag placed on him by Republicans.
   ``The `L' word in this campaign is leadership,'' Dukakis said in
Shrewsbury during the first day of a two-day visit to central
Massachusetts. ``In the last analysis, people are going to be
looking at me and Mr. Bush and they are going to be looking at
which one of us has the leadership abilities.''
   He noted that Reagan campaigned actively for GOP Senate
candidates in 1986 but could not keep Democrats from regaining
control of the Senate.

   The Legislature today overwhelmingly
approved a bill aimed at doing away with a century-old county
purchasing system the FBI found was rife with corruption.
   The House passed the bill 111-7 and the Senate 50-0. It now goes
to Gov. Ray Mabus, who had hailed the measure as ``a tremendous
victory against corruption and for effective government.''
   ``For the first time, the government of the state of Mississippi
is on record for honest and efficient government,'' Mabus said
after the legislation won final approval.
   Passage came on the seventh day of a special session called by
Mabus in response to an FBI probe of purchasing practices that
resulted in the arrest of 56 supervisors in 25 counties on charges
ranging from mail fraud to extortion.
   The Legislature had failed in this year's regular session to
agree on anti-corruption legislation.
   The bill would require counties to adopt central purchasing
systems, some form of which already exists in 22 of the state's 82
counties, but leaves in voters' hands exactly how far the
reorganization should go.
   Currently, county supervisors oversee all purchasing in their
districts. The new system would give an appointed administrator
power over day-to-day purchasing for the entire county, while
keeping policy in the hands of supervisors.
   However, the bill gives voters in each county the right to veto
by referendum the centralizing of road projects _ by far the
biggest purchasing projects at the county level.
   As state auditor for the four years preceding his election as
governor in 1987, Mabus assisted the FBI in its investigation. Of
the 56 supervisors charged, 42 have pleaded guilty, six have been
convicted and one has been acquitted.

   Democratic vice presidential nominee Lloyd
Bentsen said today that President Reagan's coattails ``will be very
short'' in helping George Bush try to win the presidency.
   Asked about the president's speech Monday night to the
Republican National Convention, Bentsen said Reagan had ``an
adoring crowd, and they enjoyed each other.''
   ``I also believe that in the convention, and after the
convention, as we go into the election, that it's George Bush
people are looking to, not Ronald Reagan,'' he said. ``And Ronald
Reagan's coattails will be very short.''
   The Texas senator's comments came during a visit to the Big Hill
Strategic Petroleum Reserve here, a stop designed to show off the
Democratic ticket's support for the program. The six underground
petroleum reserves are vaults of crude oil that can be tapped in a
national emergency.
   Bentsen told about 50 workers at the plant that their program is
crucial ``to the national security of the country.''
   It was the latest stop in Bentsen's home state campaign to grab
all the attention he can in Texas while the Republicans dominate
the national news from New Orleans.
   Bentsen on Monday was in Houston talking about another industry
in Texas that has suffered lately _ the space program.
   He visited the Johnson Space Flight Center and announced that
Dukakis would favor building a permanent manned space station.
   ``We will support an all-out effort to restore American
leadership in exploring the universe,'' he said in a speech to the
Greater Houston Chamber of Commerce.
   President Reagan is a long-time supporter of the space station,
but Bentsen said the administration has failed to bring the space
agency back to top form since the Challenger disaster.
   Bentsen also announced that if Dukakis were elected, the new
president would quickly reinstitute a Cabinet-level council on
space with the Texas senator at its head.
   Lyndon Johnson, another Texan, was put in charge of the space
council when he was vice president. The board was later abolished
by President Nixon, and Reagan has killed efforts in Congress to
put it back in operation.
   Texas has 29 electoral votes, and Bentsen is trying to make good
on his boast that the Democrats will carry the state this fall. The
nine-day campaign trip, almost entirely in Texas, was designed to
keep his name in the papers and on local television while Vice
President George Bush, another Texan, is receiving all that
attention in New Orleans.
   ``We're doing everything we can in these local markets to blow
the Republicans off the front page,'' said campaign spokesman Mike
McCurry,

   A U.S. research vessel is operating in
Soviet-controlled waters for the first time in 10 years as part of
a joint expedition made possible by a treaty signed last year.
   The Thomas Madison, operated by Scripps Institution of
Oceanography of La Jolla, on Monday entered the Soviet Union's
exclusive economic zone east of Kamchatka in the northern Pacific,
the expedition's chief scientist, Peter Lonsdale, said in a
telephone interview.
   The group is exploring a 100-million-year-old plateau region in
the Bering Sea, south of the Komandorskie Islands, that is believed
to be the oldest part of the Hawaii@Emperor Seamount chain.
   The 33-day expedition was made possible by a U.S.-Soviet treaty
on ocean research that was signed along with the Intermediate
Nuclear Forces treaty in Moscow last December.
   Aboard the vessel are scientists and technicians from Scripps
and Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution in Massachusetts and two
Soviet scientists, Lonsdale said.
   Over the next month, they will map and take core samples of the
plateau, which is about 2,000 meters below sea level and covers
about 20,000 square miles.
   Both the Soviet Union and the United States claim 200-mile
exclusive economic zones in which other nations' vessels are not
permitted to operate without permission.

   A mentally disturbed man who said he is
the son of God was held in the Dade County jail Tuesday in
connection with the desecration of sacred synagogue scrolls last
week, police said.
   Delfin Gonzalez, 30, was charged with two counts of felony
mischief after he was taped by a television news crew explaining
why he twice went to the Jacob C. Cohen Community Synagogue,
unrolled the Torah, then left it on the floor. The incidents
occurred last Wednesday and Thursday nights.
   ``He said that's pretty much what the son of God should be doing
_ reading the word of God,'' said police spokesman Jim Hyde.
   Gonzalez has confessed to the incidents, which sparked cries of
anti-Semitism and led a tearful Rabbi Tibor Stern to call for a
fast to purify the holy scrolls.
   Gonzalez, who receives medication at a mental health center, did
not steal anything or mark the scrolls, but he removed one from its
velvet case and unfurled it on the floor, Hyde said.
   Police said Gonzalez had returned to the synagogue Friday
afternoon with plans to read the Torah again when he was approached
by a WCIX television news crew, on the scene to do a story about
the incidents the previous two days. He explained himself and then
fled.
   Arrested Saturday evening, Gonzalez confessed.
   At different times, he told police he was both a Christian and a
Jew, Hyde said.

<TEXT>
   A federal appeals court today upheld the
conviction of a former follower of the Rev. Jim Jones for
conspiring in the murder of a congressman hours before the mass
murder-suicide at Peoples Temple in 1978.
   In a 3-0 decision, the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
rejected arguments that a tape-recorded speech by Jones was
improperly used against Larry Layton and that Layton's lawyers
provided an inadequate defense.
   Layton, the only former Peoples Temple member prosecuted in the
United States, was convicted in 1986 of conspiring with Jones and
others to murder Rep. Leo Ryan, shot to death at an airstrip in the
Central American country of Guyana.
   Ryan, a Democrat from the San Francisco area, had just concluded
a visit to the temple's jungle compound, Jonestown, to investigate
complaints against the religious cult.
   Hours after the congressman, three newsmen and a temple defector
were slain on the airstrip by gunmen from the temple, Jones and 912
followers died by poison and gunfire in a murder-suicide at their
agricultural settlement.
   Layton was convicted of plotting to prevent the congressman and
others from reaching the outside world with information about
conditions at Jonestown. Layton was sentenced to life in prison,
with parole possible in five years.

   Former vice presidential candidate Geraldine
Ferraro said Tuesday her son is not living a life of luxury _
despite his $1,500-a-month apartment _ while serving a four-month
sentence for cocaine possession.
   John Zaccaro is staying in a Burlington, Vt., hotel-style
apartment, which has room service and cable TV, as part of a
``house arrest'' program, aimed at easing prison overcrowding.
   ``I go up for weekends and come home and I'm crazy,'' Ferraro
said. ``It's better than being in jail, but ... he's by himself, he
does his own cooking.''
   Ferraro, who was the Democratic vice-presidential candidate in
1984, denied reports that Zaccaro has a servant.
   ``It's not true,'' she said. ``They give you clean linens once a
week and they vacuum.''
   ``We can't apologize for it _ we had to get him housing,''
Ferraro told the New York Post. ``I won't apologize for it.''
   Zaccaro was convicted in April of selling a quarter-gram of
cocaine to an undercover officer while a student at Middlebury
College in 1986. He was sentenced to one to five years in prison,
with all but four months suspended.

<TEXT>
   A fugitive eluded police for 12 years by
borrowing a dead man's name from a newspaper's obituary columns and
assuming his identity, authorities said.
   Kyle Eugene Hendricks, 38, was arrested Monday night on charges
of drug trafficking and violation of probation in Virginia.
   He was posing as Dale Vernon Brundell, a man who died more than
a decade ago in the Alexandria, Va., area, said special agent Jeff
Fortier of the Florida Department of Law Enforcement.
   ``He was shocked that we located him,'' said Fortier.
   Hendricks had a driver's license, Social Security card,
insurance papers and credit cards bearing Brundell's name, Fortier
said, adding, ``He's assumed that name lock, stock and barrel.''
   Also going by the name of Brundell were Hendricks' wife, Vikki,
and their 8-year-old son.
   ``His son learned for the first time tonight that his name
wasn't Brundell,'' Fortier said.
   Hendricks was arrested in Alexandria for theft and resisting
arrest 10 years ago. He was booked under his assumed name, and no
connection was made to the earlier charges at the time.
   But Virginia authorities eventually connected the two names, and
an FBI fingerprint check confirmed last month that fingerprints
taken 10 years ago matched those of Hendricks.
   Virginia authorities notified their Florida counterparts when
they learned that a Florida driver's license had been issued to
``Brundell.''
   Hendricks' wife was aware of the dual names but was not
immediately charged, the agent said. Fortier said he didn't know
how long they had been married.
   Neighbors said the unemployed man was quiet and had little to do
with anyone else.

<HEAD>Striking Workers Demand Reinstatement of Solidarity Union</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   About 4,000 workers went on strike Tuesday
at a coal mine in southern Poland and demanded the legalization of
the banned Solidarity trade union, activists said.
   The occupation strike came on the eighth anniversary of the
birth of the outlawed trade union federation in the port city of
Gdansk.
   Witnesses said about 600 police took up positions around the
Manifest Lipcowy mine near the city of Jastrzebie. A Solidarity
adviser said there were no reports of violence and police made no
attempt to move into the facility.
   The security forces, which were called in by mine management,
cordoned off the mine, and public transportation to the facility
was suspended, said the Solidarity adviser, Jacek Kuron.
   The mine's management informed strikers over loudspeakers that
it considered the strike illegal, then declared the mine closed
until further notice, he said.
   Mine director Karol Grzywa ordered ``anyone not directly engaged
in works toward securing the mine's property to leave the
premises,'' the state-run PAP news agency said.
   As of Tuesday night, 700 workers still were in the mine, the
news agency said.
   ``The strike is clearly political in nature,'' PAP said, adding
that wage demands were not high on the miners' agenda.
   Legalizaton of the Solidarity union is among the chief demands
made by the miners, said Solidarity spokeswoman Katarzyna
Ketrzynska.
   The workers also want mine management to reinstate workers fired
for independent trade union activities, she said, adding that the
workers also are demanding better working conditions and pay
increases.
   The action began when the overnight shift refused to take up
their tools. They were joined by workers arriving for the morning
shift, Kuron said.
   Kuron said mine management then locked out members of the
afternoon shift to prevent them from joining the strike.
   Solidarity spokesmen said workers at the nearby Borynia mine
staged a brief sympathy rally, but went back to work at noon.
   Jastrzebie is located about 280 miles southwest of Warsaw in the
heart of Silesia, Poland's most vital industrial and mining region.
   Security officials, meanwhile, briefly detained 10 Solidarity
leaders at the Rudna copper mine near the city of Wroclaw in lower
Silesia. That mine also has been the scene of unrest in recent
months, with workers demanding improved safety conditions.
   Jan Sugalski, a Solidarity activist in the region, said two
crews were taken to the mine's management building for ``safety
training.'' There was no production at the mine Tuesday, he said.
   Workers at the Rudna mine staged a protest rally on Monday.
   Most of Poland's heavy industry is located in the Silesian
region. Its coal and copper mines supply raw materials for the
nation's vital steel and shipbuilding industries.
   On Aug. 16, 1980, workers at factories around Gdansk joined
striking shipyard workers and jointly declared their demands for
the formation of an independent trade union federation.
   The Solidarity trade union federation was suppressed in 1981
when the government imposed martial law. It was banned a year later
by parliament.

   A car struck 24-year-old twins fighting on a
dark highway, killing one brother and critically injuring the
other, authorities said.
   Martin and Roger Baluski, 24, were run down Sunday night during
a scuffle that began after they stopped the pickup they were riding

Capt. Doyle Schultz.
   Martin Baluski was killed, Schultz said. Roger Baluski was in

said Mike Mabin, a spokesman.
   The patrolman did not know what the men were arguing about.
   The driver of the car was not hurt. He summoned authorities to
the scene, Schultz said.

<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal appeals court has upheld a
$305,000 damage award to a bar owner who said police visited his
bar as many as six times a night, shined flashlights in patrons'
faces and followed them when they left.
   Remo Benigni, who won the suit against the town of Hemet, its
police chief and a patrolman, contended he was singled out for
harassment because of his Italian ancestry by officers apparently
looking for Mafia figures.
   He complained he had to sell his bar at a loss in 1986 because
of police harassment that included officers walking through the
place with their hands on their guns or asking for ID from people
obviously over the drinking age of 21.
   Christopher Lockwood, a lawyer for the town near Los Angeles,
denied any harassment. He said Benigni's bar ``needed more
enforcement than the other bars'' because it was the busiest and
the only one to cater to a young crowd.
   A three-judge panel of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals on
Monday unanimously upheld the jury's verdict.

   Remember all the medical waste, dead rats
and other filth washing ashore along the Eastern Seaboard?
Authorities here have a different, but much more pleasant, debris
problem.
   About $1,000 in various denominations has floated ashore a
private beach over the last five days.
   ``People were digging in the sand with sticks and turning over
the seaweed,'' said lifeguard Dean Perri, 20. ``One girl was
yelling, `Mommy, Mommy, look what I found.' She had two $100 bills.
My boss found 80 bucks.''
   People ``were finding $50s and $100s'' on Sunday, said Leonard
Francois of Springfield, Mass., ``I saw a little girl in front of
me pick out a 20 and a guy beside me was fishing 10s and 20s.''
   The money was dated 1985.
   U.S. Secret Service agent Joseph G. Sullivan said it's ``finders
keepers'' unless it appears the money is tied to a crime.

<TEXT>
   Patrick J. Kennedy, son of Sen. Edward
M. Kennedy, earned $22,309 last year, according to income tax
returns he disclosed as he heads into the final month before his
first political primary.
   All but $350 of the 21-year-old Providence College junior's
income was from his family's investments, according to the
statements released Monday. He paid $2,749 in federal taxes and
$645 in Rhode Island income taxes.
   Kennedy is challenging five-term incumbent state Rep. John M.
Skeffington Jr. for the Democratic nomination in the Sept. 14
primary.
   Kennedy told the Providence Journal-Bulletin he has total assets
of between $250,000 and $300,000.
   The $350 in wages Kennedy earned was for a research internship
last year with the legislative council at the Statehouse.
   He also received $16,061 from money-market certificates of
deposit at Citibank, $425 in stock dividend income from Ameritech,
$360 from American Telegraph and Telephone, $496 from Bell South,
$8 from Pepsico, $7 from Warner Communications and $51 from the
Rose F. Kennedy Trust Fund set up by his grandmother, Rose Kennedy,
in 1953.
   Kennedy said he has since become the beneficiary of a blind
trust set up by his late grandfather, financier and ambassador
Joseph P. Kennedy. He said he does not know the worth of the trust
but estimated it may push his annual income to between $50,000 and
$70,000.

   Jesus Christ's teachings are being ignored by
those who would prevent others from seeing ``The Last Temptation of
Christ,'' says actress Barbara Hershey, the movie's Mary Magdalene.
   ``It's so obvious, when you see the film, that its intentions
are religious,'' said Ms. Hershey, who introduced the movie's
director, Martin Scorsese, to the Nikos Kazantzakis novel upon
which the movie is based.
   ``These people have a perfect right not to see the film, but
they don't have a right to tell everyone else that they can't,''
she said. Fundamentalist Christians have protested the movie since
it opened in seven cities in the United States and two in Canada
last week.
   ``Christ's teachings are about love and generosity, and I'm
certainly not seeing that in these demonstrations,'' the actress
said in a telephone interview from her Connecticut home. ``What
happened to `Judge not lest ye be judged' and `Let he who is
without sin cast the first stone?'''
   Ms. Hershey, whose credits include ``Hannah and Her Sisters''
and ``Tin Men,'' told Scorsese about the book in 1972 when they
were working together on the movie ``Boxcar Bertha.''
   ``As I got to know him I could see his wit and humor, and the
incredibly complex investment he had in religion,'' she said. ``I
immediately thought of the book in terms of Marty. I told him he
should make it into a film.
   ``He says I also told him that I should play Mary Magdalene. I
don't remember actually saying that, but it sure sounds like me.''
   Years later, when the film finally was being cast, she recalled,
``I auditioned for months. I did three screen tests.''
   ``Marty told me later that he had me work so hard because I
really had to prove to him that I was the best for the role. He
didn't want to give it to me for any obligatory reasons.''

   A $250,000 bond guaranteed by television actor
Fred Dryer to keep his father-in-law out of prison was ordered
forfeited because the defendant allegedly committed crimes while on
bail.
   Dryer, star of the ``Hunter'' police drama series and a former
all-pro football player for the Los Angeles Rams, had agreed to put
up an apartment house he owns in the Los Angeles area as collateral
for his father-in-law's bail.
   John Vaccaro, father of Dryer's wife, Tracy, was freed on bail
pending an appeal of his 1985 conviction on charges of
masterminding a Nevada slot machine cheating ring.
   U.S. Magistrate Phyllis Halsey Atkins said Monday that Vaccaro
violated the terms of the bond while he was free on bail when he
was indicted for racketeering by a Los Angeles grand jury.
   Vaccaro is accused of dealing with alleged Los Angeles Mafia
street boss Liugi Gelfuso and dividing huge amounts of profits from
various drug deals allegedly made while Vaccaro was free on bond.
   The $250,000 bond required after the 1985 conviction was posted
by Spencer Douglass Insurance Associates and guaranteed by Dryer.
Ms. Atkins said the insurance company would have to forfeit the
bond, and repayment would be between the company and Dryer.
   Dryer's Los Angeles publicist, Dick Delson, said the actor
wasn't immediatly available to comment Tuesday.

Madison Square Garden.
   Michael, who first gained popularity as a member of Wham, sang
for nearly two hours Sunday night in his first of three sell-out
shows. He opened with his controversial single, ``I Want Your
Sex,'' and ran through all the other hits from his multiplatinum
solo album, ``Faith.''
   An elaborate laser show and Michael's energetic dancing brought
the mostly teen-age audience to its feet for most of the
performance. Michael sang his old Wham hits, ``I'm Your Man'' and
``Careless Whisper,'' and did cover versions of the 1970s hits
``Play That Funky Music'' and ``Lady Marmalade.''

   George Bush, saying he has chosen his running
mate but is still keeping it secret, arrived today to take command
at the Republican convention and launch his uphill struggle for the
White House. ``I do not intend to fail,'' he declared.
   President Reagan, passing the torch to his political partner of
nearly eight years, said, ``A great deal rides on this campaign,
and on you are America's hopes for continued peace and prosperity.''
   Shortly after arriving, Bush and his staff began making
telephone calls to people who were not chosen. Among those
contacted were South Carolina Gov. Carroll Campbell and New Mexico
Sen. Pete Domenici.
   Campbell said Bush told him the vice presidential nominee would
not come from the South.
   Campbell quoted Bush as saying, ``We don't need to go South for
a running mate.'' That would seem to rule out at least former
Tennessee Gov. Lamar Alexander and former Sen. Howard Baker, who
was Reagan's chief of staff. Former Transportation Secretary
Elizabeth Dole, who is married to Sen. Bob Dole of Kansas, is a
North Carolina native.
   The vice president said his decision about a running mate will
be announced ``before Thursday night'' when he addresses the
convention and accepts its presidential nomination. He admonished
reporters ``not to play the game of 20 questions'' with him.
   At a ceremony at a military air base 20 miles from town, Bush
and Reagan met briefly and then headed their separate ways, Reagan
en route to a long vacation in California and Bush making a
triumphant entry in the convention city.
   ``Hail and farewell,'' Bush told Reagan and his wife Nancy. The
president, asked by reporters about the identity of Bush's running
mate, said, ``I don't know. He hasn't told me. I'm not sure he
knows.'' Bush quickly interjected, ``No, I know.''
   Just before Reagan boarded Air Force One, Bush leaned over and
whispered something in the president's ear. Reagan nodded. Bush
aide Alixe Glen said she thought the vice president told Reagan the
running mate's name.
   Moments earlier, standing alongside the president, Bush said,
``By the time you leave office ... you will have done for America
the greatest thing that a president could do; you will have left
this country better than you found it, and today America can see
further because of your vision and now it is time to extend that
vision into the next century.
   ``It is time to accept the challenge that you have left for us
and made possible, to build a better America,'' the vice president
said. ``America's mission is greatness and I do not intend to
fail.''
   Reagan, who electrified the convention with a farewell speech
Monday night, jokingly told the airport audience, ``I just tried to
make a deal with George, that I would tell him where to find the
best blackened redfish if he'd tell me who is going to be vice
president.''
   At the end of the ceremony, Bush introduced his three
Mexican-American grandchildren to Reagan as ``the little brown
ones.'' The three children _ Jeb Jr., Noelle, and George P. _ are
the children of Bush's son, Jeb, and his Mexican-born wife, Columba.
   Reagan's spokesman, Marlin Fitzwater, said on ABC's ``Good
Morning America'' that Reagan ``will do a lot of campaigning'' for
Bush.
   ``We're going to have four or five events next week in
California; he's going to make at least a couple trips a week
between now and the election,'' Fitzwater said. He said Reagan
``won't get personal; he won't talk about Mike Dukakis, but he'll
talk about Republicans and Democrats and conservatives and liberals
in a way that you won't mistake the difference.''
   In addition to finally making his vice presidential choice, Bush
said he also was ready with the speech he will deliver Thursday
night, an address that delegates say is crucial to set the tone for
his fall campaign.
   Bush said he practiced the speech on the plane on the way to New
Orleans. ``I checked it out with Barbara,'' he said. ``She stayed
awake for the whole thing. I feel comfortable with what we've got.''
   Asked when he had made up his mind about a vice president, Bush
said, ``Just before I climbed onto this plane. Today, and with
finality.''
   Bush said no one on the plane knew the name of his running mate,
not even his wife or campaign chief James A. Baker III.
   As the gavel fell this morning, opening the second day of the
convention, speculation about Bush's running mate centered on Sen.
Dole, his wife Elizabeth, Sens. Dan Quayle, Domenici, Alan Simpson,
Atty. Gen. Richard Thornburgh, former Sen. Baker and Rep. Jack
Kemp. Also churned up by the rumor mill were the names of Sens.
John Danforth and Christopher Bond of Missouri.
   Bush said he had was not offended by Dole's complaints Monday
about the selection process. ``I took no offense at that. Pressure
mounts.''
   The vice president watched Reagan's speech on television Monday
night and then said he would ``do my level best to fill those big
shoes of President Ronald Reagan.''
   ``George, I'm in your corner,'' Reagan declared in an
emotionally charged valedictory speech to a Superdome audience
packed to the rafters. ``But George, just one more personal
request: go out there and win one for the Gipper.''
   Without debate or dissent, delegates in the half-empty
convention hall today chorused approval of a conservative platform
for Bush to use in his battle against Michael Dukakis.
   The 40,000 word document pledges no tax increases, calls for a
constitutional amendment to ban abortion and promises ``rapid and
certain deployment'' of the Star Wars missile defense plan, also
known as the Strategic Defense Initiative.
   The document embraces Bush's campaign proposals by endorsing
child-care tax credits for low-income families, increased spending
on Head Start and a new ``merit schools'' program, and tax-free
savings bonds to pay for college. There was not a single dissenting
report for the full convention to debate.
   For his part, Dukakis remained at home, shrugging off attacks
from New Orleans. ``I don't think it's going to do any political
damage,'' the Massachusetts governor said. ``In the last analysis,
people are going to be looking at me and Mr. Bush and they are
going to be looking at which one of us has the leadership.''

   Someplace over Alabama or maybe Mississippi,
winging his way to the Republican National Convention, George Bush
unsheathed his Thursday night acceptance speech and rehearsed it
for his wife.
   ``She stayed awake for the whole thing,'' Bush said in
describing Tuesday's mid-air drama.
   For the whole thing! She stayed awake ``for the whole thing.''
   There he goes again. George Bush is raising expectations for his
convention-climax address. It is a pressure situation. He is no
William Jennings Bryan, but he'll do OK.
   This was not quite the Dukakis approach.
   Democratic presidential nominee Michael Dukakis, like George
Bush, does not enjoy a reputation as a marvelous and commanding
public speaker. People laugh at his dense delivery and his
seemingly endless repetition of sophomoric rhetoric.
   A real war, not a phoney war on drugs.
   Good jobs at good wages, and I don't mean flipping hamburgers
and doing other people's laundry.
   Zorba the Clerk, the critics called Dukakis.
   So the expectations were pretty low for the Democratic nominee's
convention speech _ and that was before Kitty took her catnap. When
it comes to lowering expectations, the Kittycatnap will go down in
history.
   To hear Dukakis tell it, he'd spent the better part of a week
mulling and writing and honing his acceptance speech when Kitty
asked if she could take a look.
   ``I said OK and she went into the bedroom,'' he said. ``When I
went into the room myself to get my jacket, my wife was fast asleep
on the bed and the speech was beside her, half read.''
   And so when Dukakis gave his address, and it was good, and it
was delivered with passion and force, he seemed transformed. As the
saying goes, that's the way to do it...
   For better or worse, that isn't the way Bush is going about his
business.
   He knows expectations are low and he figures if he doesn't stand
up for himself, who will? And so full tilt, he has been raising
expectations, even to the extent of borrowing the Dukakis catnap
anecdote and turning it upside down for Barbara Bush.
   To hear Bush tell it, he is the Comeback Kid, weighing in and
bragging in advance that it's in the bag. He told Bryant Gumbel of
NBC's ``Today'': ``You're an athlete. I'm an athlete. There's a lot
of pressure out there, you can feel it building. But I've been in
pressure situations before.''
   Republican delegates are well aware of the importance of the
Thursday night address if Bush is to overtake Dukakis.
   ``I think his image should be sharpened, and his acceptance
speech should do that'' said Nancy Chin-Lee of Delaware. ``He can
low key it for a while, but not much longer.''
   ``He needs to improve his image, but I don't know what he should
do,'' said delegate Kitty Stark of Chattanooga. ``One thing _ he
ought to get horn-rimmed glasses instead of those awful clear ones
he wears now.''
   Tom Adam of Pierre, S.D., said it will help that Bush is now out
from under President Reagan's shadow.
   ``His lightbulb was under somebody else's shade, and when he
turns it on, he'll be all right,'' Adam said. ``I think when people
get an idea of his background, how deep he is, the polls will take
care of themselves.''

<HEAD>Pilots' Union Leader Says Airlines Must Improve Training</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Commerical airlines are jeopardizing safety by
putting more high-technology planes into service without properly
training pilots to use them, the leader of the airline pilots'
largest union said Tuesday.
   Henry A. Duffy, president of the Air Line Pilots Association,
representing 41,000 U.S. pilots, said an overloaded air traffic
control system and a shortage of experienced pilots made the need
for better pilot training even more crucial.
   ``Even though this need has long been recognized, very little
has been done to improve pilot training,'' he told an air safety
forum sponsored by the pilots union.
   Duffy said a combination of new problems in the U.S. airline
industry, including inadequate training for pilots flying
high-technology aircraft with fully automated cockpits had led to
``an erosion of the critical margin of safety that's absolutely
necessary'' in the operation of commercial air carriers.
   ``We can't continue to chip away at this safety margin and not
expect to suffer the consequences,'' he said.
   An independent expert told the pilots forum that the
introduction of fully automated cockpits, while reducing the
frequency of human errors, had made some pilots feel alienated from
the aircraft.
   ``The pilot feels himself moved from the center of the cockpit
to the periphery,'' said Earl Wiener, an air safety expert at the
University of Miami.
   As a joke meant to illustrate this feeling of alienation, Wiener
listed what he called the questions most frequently asked by pilots
in advanced cockpits:
   ``What is it doing now?
   ``Why did it do that?
   ``What is it going to do next?''

   The Republican National Convention ended
early for a Connecticut delegate who suffered a deep leg gash in an
escalator accident.
   Mary Boatwright of Stonington, sitting with her injured left leg
propped on a chair at breakfast Tuesday, said she will leave for
home Wednesday to see her family doctor.
   Mrs. Boatwright, a member of the Republican National Committee,
was on an escalator at the New Orleans Hilton hotel Monday when
three heavy boxes fell from the cart of a delivery man who was in
front of her.
   She fell over the boxes and suffered a leg gash down to the
bone. Doctors at the Tulane Medical Center were unable to stitch
the wound closed and said she may need a skin graft, Mrs.
Boatwright said.

   About 30,000 people have been marshaled to fill
sand bags and reinforce dikes against a river that is threatening
to submerge the industrial city of Qiqihar, it was reported Tuesday.
   Thousands of people have been evacuated from the city, which is
located 600 miles northeast of Beijing in the Heilongjiang province.
   The Nen River, swollen by a week-long storm, already was 3 feet
over the warning level by early Tuesday, its highest crest in 30
years, according to the official news agency Xinhua. More rain is
expected in the mountains north of Qiqihar, where the Nen River
originates.
   The nightly news showed hundreds of workers filling sand bags
and reinforcing dikes along the river banks and said they were
among 30,000 workers and soldiers called to help with flood
prevention.
   The northern reaches of the Nen River flooded earlier this week,
submerging parts of Inner Mongolia and northern Heilongjiang
province.
   Floods in China this year have killed 1,406 people and caused
$1.2 billion in damage.

   ``Technically, everything looks A-OK,'' said Department of
Energy spokeswoman Chris Sankey.
   Wednesday's test, code-named Kearsarge, will be the ninth
conducted at the desert site this year and the 684th announced shot
there since January 1951.
   Some of the Soviet scientists have been at the town of Mercury
for six of this year's previous tests, but Kearsarge is the first
time nuclear scientists from either country have been allowed on
the other's highly sensitive sites.
   Wednesday's test is designed to test the ability of the two
countries to measure the size of each other's nuclear tests. Such
verification is needed to determine whether the two superpowers are
living within the 150-kiloton limit set in treaties that were
signed in 1974 and 1976 but never ratified.
   Scientists and diplomats said the experiment is a critical first
step toward a possible test ban.
   Diplomats who helped forge the historic event were at Mercury, a
tiny town 65 miles northwest of Las Vegas that serves as a base
camp for the nation's nuclear tests.
   Some 45 Soviet nuclear scientists were scheduled to be on site
for Wednesday's detonation, with most of them watching from a
control point 30 miles from ground zero.
   A like number of American nuclear scientists are scheduled to
witness a Soviet nuclear test at the Soviet site at Semipalatinsk
in mid-September.
   The U.S. and Soviet scientists checked out sophisticated
equipment Tuesday that is housed in trailers a few hundred yards
from ground zero.
   The trailer areas were fenced off and armed guards checked
everyone entering and leaving. Signs on the fence read: ``Security
Area: Deadly Force Authorized.''
   The crew of a DOE helicopter patrolling the site picked up two
anti-nuclear protesters in a remote desert canyon on a bombing and
gunnery range adjoining the secret site. They were taken to U.S. 95
west of the test site and released.
   The $25 million test, known as the Joint Verification
Experiment, comes nearly four years after President Reagan proposed
such a project in a speech to the United Nations.
   The verification tests were agreed to by Reagan and General
Secretary Mikhail Gorbachev at the Washington summit last December.
   Scientists from the U.S. and the Soviet Union will be measuring
the explosive punch of a thermonuclear device
   The device scheduled for detonation was encased in a steel
canister buried 2,020 feet beneath the scenic 7,500-foot mesa. The
canister, painted red, white and blue, was 8 feet tall, 88 inches
in diameter and weighed 7{ tons. Soviet scientists were allowed to
look at the canister only after it was sealed.
   The device, with an explosive force nearly 12 times the bomb
that destroyed Hiroshima, was large enough to send shock waves
through upper levels of Las Vegas hotel-casinos and rattle
chandeliers at historic Scotty's Castle, in nearby Death Valley,
Calif.
   Managers of high-rise buildings in Las Vegas received their
standard warning not to have workers in precarious positions at the
time of detonation.
   DOE spokeswoman Barbara Yoerg said the two anti-nuclear
demonstrators were spotted on the Nellis Bombing and Gunnery Range,
which borders the 1,350-square-mile test site on three sides.
   Chris Brown of the anti-nuclear American Peace Test announced
Monday that the two had infiltrated the test site Saturday night
with the intent of hiking to ground zero and delaying the test.
   But Ms. Yoerg said the two never made it to the test site
boundary.

   Cool comfort is so coveted in this steamy
convention city that hosts are paying $1 per square foot to
air-condition party tents.
   The goal is red-hot good times, not red-hot guests.
   Mark Conrad is a busy man. Friend to climate-conscious
party-givers, his company is providing tons of equipment to pump
75-degree air into tents for lawn parties during the Republican
National Convention.
   Twenty-inch ducts connect Conrad's air conditioners to tubes
running the length of a tent. Chilled air is forced out through
small holes to give evenly-spaced comfort _ a ceiling-fan effect.
   Conrad said that's a technical advance. ``We used to physically
set the equipment inside the tent,'' he explained. ``And some lady
would spend $200 on a hairdo. Then they'd walk in front of the
blowers. Poof! Big trouble.''
   Republicans can beat sticky heat in the climate-controlled
Louisiana Superdome, but shirts are soaked after a stroll to the
French Quarter. Bar signs on Bourbon Street tout air conditioning
like a specialty drink.
   Former Judge Robert Bork, the rejected nominee for the U.S.
Supreme Court, cracked at a reception for GOP celebrities, ``The
Republican National Committee gave us a preview of another great
public policy issue _ the greenhouse effect.'' That got an
understanding laugh.
   But not from Eddie Logan. He's the guy inside a towering State
of Liberty costume topped by a 25-pound mask, rented out as a
living decoration for parties.
   ``Yes, sir, I'd say it's hot in here. I'm sweating,'' Logan said
on the unshaded steps of the New Orleans Museum of Art.
   As Logan spoke, the temperature was in the high 90s and the heat
index, which computes comfort based on humidity and thermometer
readings, reached 104 degrees.
   ``It's a great city, but the heat is hard to get used to,'' said
R.J. Doria, a Colorado delegate. ``I'm glad a lot of these parties
are indoors.''
   City councilman Mike Early, who planned one of convention week's
biggest parties, shrugged about the city's surpassing its average
daily August high of 90.6 degrees.
   ``It's impossible to go through one day in August without at
least a drop of rain,'' Early said. ``And the heat _ it's a way of
life.''

<HEAD>No Dissent Heard as GOP Approves Conservative Platform</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTOPHER CONNELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW ORLEANS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Republican delegates chorused their approval
Tuesday of a book-length 1988 platform that courts conservatives,
cudgels Democrats and commits the GOP to a child care tax credit as
well as rapid deployment of the Strategic Defense Initiative.
   Nebraska Gov. Kay Orr, the platform chairman, called it ``a
rallying cry for all those who share our values.''
   There was neither dissent nor debate on a single plank. The hall
was half-empty as Orr and other platform leaders spent 45 minutes
singing the praises of their 40,000-word declaration of philosophy,
titled, ``An American Vision: For Our Children and Our Future.''
   ``I didn't hear any no's,'' Orr said after finishing her work
and producing a document that speaks to scores of issues, from the
space-based defense shield that it extols to a heifer tax that it
opposes.
   Orr, who has said it would cost $43 billion to carry out
programs implicit in the Democrats' platform, was unable to say how
much it would cost to make good on the GOP's promises. Pressed for
an estimate, she said, ``It's a busy week.''

   Later, in a speech to the convention's evening session, Orr
boasted that the GOP document ``is far, far superior to the
platform the Democrats cobbled together in Atlanta.''
   ``You won't find some very basic words in the Democratic
platform _ words like `tax' or `revenue' or `unemployment.' You
won't find any mention of NATO. You won't find the words `church'
or `synagogue'. ... '' Orr said. ``They don't want the people to
know that they are still the party that will raise taxes and weaken
our defense.''

<TEXT>
   Marilyn Thayer of New Orleans called it ``our love-letter to the
American family.'' She said the platform ``stands on our
Judeo-Christian tradition. ... It spells the doom of corruption in
government and of pornography.''
   ``We're not just against abortion. We're for adoption reform ...
for more tax relief for families (and) an all-out crusade against
infant morality and birth defects,'' she said.
   Even mothers at home with kids would benefit from the child care
tax credit because ``Republicans know every mom is a first-class
mom, and we're going to help them all,'' said Thayer.
   ``It's hard to take a stand on controversial issues, but we
Republicans would rather take a stand than take a walk,'' said
Patricia Goodrich of Madison, Wis.
   The platform toes the conservative line on taxes, abortion and
defense. It accuses the Democrats of tolerating corruption and
calls for subjecting Congress itself to civil rights, health and
safety laws.
   The 104-page text is 25 percent longer than the 1984 GOP
platform and eight times the length of the bare-bones platform the
Democrats approved in Atlanta four weeks ago.
   The GOP platform echoes the 1984 document in pledging no tax
increases, calling for a constitutional ``human life'' amendment to
ban abortion and promising ``peace through strength.''
   It promotes George Bush's positions in favor of child-care tax
credits for low-income families, increased funds for Head Start, a
new ``merit schools'' program, and tax-free savings bonds for
college.
   It calls for `compassion and help'' for those who suffer from
AIDS, but also stresses the need to ``protect those who do not have
the disease.''
   It became certain Monday there would be no minority planks when
the 106-member Republican Platform Committee approved the document
with only two dissenting votes: Sen. Lowell P. Weicker Jr. and Mary
Boatwright, both of Connecticut.
   No one attempted to gather the 27 signatures needed to file a
minority report.
   Boatwright was returning home after injuring her leg Monday in
an escalator mishap.

   More than 200 people are imprisoned without charge
in Benin and many have been tortured, Amnesty International said
Wednesday in a report on human rights in the West African country.
   The report alleges that some of the prisoners have been detained
for up to three years, while 100 were arrested in March and April
on suspicion of being involved in a conspiracy against the
government.
   The human rights organization identified most of the prisoners
as armed forces personnel, including a police chief, Lt. Col.
Francois Kouyami, and a member of the Presidential Guard identified
only as Capt. Hountondji.
   The arrests over the alleged conspiracy took place in the area
of Abomey, capital of the former kingdom of Dahomey, Amnesty
International said. The country's name was changed from Dahomey to
Benin in 1975.
   It said Abomey was ``an area of considerable economic unrest''
caused by government measures introduced in recent months,
including a reported plan to store European nuclear waste in Saklo,
just south of Abomey.
   Official Beninois sources have since reported that Benin has
shelved the plan, which provoked sharp protest from neighboring
countries.
   The report said at least half the prisoners held without trial
``are prisoners of conscience ... imprisoned solely for the
non-violent exercise of their basic human rights to freedom of
expression and association.''
   It said at least one prisoner, Remy Glele Akpokpo, died in
custody.
   It said prisoners were subjected to prolonged beatings and
whippings, sometimes in front of spectators. One form of torture
described by former prisoners is the ``rodeo,'' in which victims
are made to crawl on sharp, stony ground while being beaten.
   Benin, a former French colony, became independent in 1960 and
underwent six military coups until 1972, when the present
president, French-trained paratrooper Mathieu Kerekou, seized power
and installed a Marxist government.

   - 
   NEW ORLEANS (AP) _ With fetes and eats and welcoming arms, in
hotels and meeting halls and restaurants across this
convention-consumed city, business is buddying up to the Republican
Party.
   Try Suite 2886 of the Hilton hotel, where the Food Marketing
Institute beckons with free liquor, hors d'oeuvres and a river
view. The catch so far: a hundred bites, with Rep. Bob Michel of
Illinois as the biggest fish.
   Uninterested in tales of the travails of the nation's
supermarkets? Try the Delta Airlines hospitality suite. Hit
BellSouth's free food at Windsor Court. Drop by the reception
sponsored by Middle South Utilities.
   The enticements are many. The official convention calendar lists
more than 50 corporate-sponsored parties for delegates, party and
elected leaders and aides this week. Many more events did not make
the list.
   Such affairs are nothing new to the political scene; many of the
same companies held similar parties for the Democrats in Atlanta
last month. Their credo: Ideology aside, in politics, goodwill is
good business.
   ``There's no arm twisting, no hard sell. It's primarily meet and
greet and make friends,'' said Raymond Friedlob, a delegate from
Denver. ``They have a chance to tell their story to an audience
that's willing to listen.''
   As straightforward as it may seem, however, the corporate
presence is troubling to some delegates who fear having the GOP
tagged as the party of big business.
   ``The whole issue is how organizations _ corporations,
associations of interest groups _ finance candidates and do favors
for candidates. I find it a disturbing one,'' said Sherry Nemmers,
an alternate delegate from Portland, Maine. ``My concern is
appearances.''
   ``You have a lot of money flowing around,'' she said. ``The
source of that money is always going to be open to question about
its intended purpose.''
   Nemmers nonetheless attended a BellSouth reception for Elizabeth
and Sen. Bob Dole of Kansas at a posh hotel this week _ because,
she said, it was her only chance to see them in an intimate setting.
   The free spread included champagne and bloody Marys, eggs
Benedict and sliced kiwis. Were she running for public office back
in Maine, Nemmers was quick to say, ``I'd have avoided it like the
plague.''
   Another elected official, Dole himself, did not share those
reservations about corporate sponsorships, though both he and his
wife were defensive in commenting on the business-backed events.
   ``We know all the people anyway. It's nice,'' Dole said. ```They
live here and they have business here and they want to be welcomed
and I think it's great. Nothing sinister about it.''
   ``I don't know anything about that really. ... I was not in on
any of the planning of the events,'' said Mrs. Dole, the former
U.S. transportation secretary. ``They asked to be hosts. ... People
are enjoying it and the idea is to have a good time. So I don't see
that there's any problem with that.''
   One or both of the Doles were listed on the official schedule
for eight business-sponsored receptions and lunches this week,
courtesy of groups from the American Trucking Association and
General Motors to Avon.
   One of the biggest corporate players is BellSouth: The regional
phone company is sponsoring a dozen events this week, including a
brunch for 150 Congress members, state GOP chairmen and executives.
BellSouth also runs a free lunchroom for the news media.
   ``We're a major player in the telecommunications industry,''
said Dan Mattoon, a BellSouth lobbyist. ``We want to be involved
with members of Congress and others who are involved in our
issues.''
   There are other ways for corporations to spread good will at
political conventions. Many donated to the fund New Orleans
established to defray its costs; others are paying up to $100,000
for tables at a gala fund-raiser for the Republican Party this
week. While corporations can't give directly to political
candidates, they can give to the party _ and sponsor parties.
   Take Delta Airlines. It's running two hospitality suites, one
equipped with first-class airplane seats for visitors who want a
snooze. It's buying lunch for the Utah delegation _ Salt Lake City
is the hub of Western Airlines, which Delta took over last year _
and it's laying out a six-course luncheon at Arnaud's, a French
quarter restaurant, for 200 guests, led by lawmakers with a hand in
transportation policy.
   ``If somebody knows you they can believe what you're saying,''
said Delta spokesman William D. Berry. ``They can come to you and
say, `Delta, this bill is surfacing, what do you think of it? Is it
good for the industry or bad?'
   ``We like that input. We need that input. This is a chance for
us to be known by these people, and for us to know them.''

<TEXT>
   Burma said Tuesday it has released 51
people who were detained during bloody anti-government protests
last week that led to the resignation of President Sein Lwin.
   The release came as student groups in the capital of Rangoon
distributed leaflets calling for more protests Wednesday against
Burma's one-party government, diplomats and journalists said.
   The official radio, monitored in Bangkok, said the 51 prisoners
released from Insein prison on the outskirts of Rangoon included 37
male students, 10 female students and four civilians.
   It also said 30 people arrested earlier this month in
disturbances in Pegu, 45 miles northeast of the capital, were freed
on Sunday.
   The releases were the first since violent nationwide
demonstrations ended Friday with the resignation of Sein Lwin, a
hardline former general.
   Radio Rangoon said a week ago that authorities had arrested more
than 700 demonstrators. Later, it reported 1,451 arrests in Rangoon
but did not make clear if that included the 700 mentioned earlier.
   The protests were the most massive since Burma achieved
independence from Britain in 1948.
   In a sweep last month following Sein Lwin's elevation to the top
post, authorities arrested the country's most prominent dissident,
Aung Gyi, as well as Associated Press correspondent Sein Win. There
was no indication that they were among those who were freed.
   Life in Rangoon continued its slow return to normal Tuesday.
Soldiers maintained their guard on police stations for fear of
attacks similar to those in which three policemen were beheaded by
protesters last week.
   A Western diplomat in Rangoon said trucks and tanks with up to
200 soldiers were parked on Merchant Street in the center of the
city, about 200 yards from the U.S. Embassy.
   The show of force ``appeared to be a precaution because posters
called for continued protests,'' said the diplomat, speaking on
condition of anonymity. He said the vehicles were gone by Tuesday,
and there was only a light troop presence in the rest of the
capital.
   The ruling Burma Socialist Program Party and the country's
legislature have scheduled emergency sessions for Friday,
presumably to choose a successor to Sein Lwin, who served only 17
days and was hated for brutally crushing dissent.
   Sein Lwin took over when Ne Win resigned abruptly as leader
after 26 years of authoritarian rule.
   Most analysts believe the country's next ruler will be an active
or retired military officer from the enduring hierarchy of Ne Win,
whose coming to power in a 1962 military coup ended Burma's
experiment with democracy.
   Diplomats and tourists arriving in Bangkok from Burma on Tuesday
said among the seven demands listed by protesters in leaflets and
posters were a multiparty democracy, the release of political
dissidents including Aung Gyi, a court trial of Sein Lwin, and the
legalization of student unions.
   Students also have called for major changes in leadership,
reductions in the cost of living and compensation for families of
people killed or wounded in last week's demonstrations.
   In a sign of discontent within the system, 177 Burmese lawyers
signed a document charging that by firing against peaceful
demonstrators, including children, security forces violated the
Burmese constitution and the U.N. Declaration of Human Rights.
   Japan's Kyodo and China's Xinhua news agencies reported from
Rangoon that the Lawyer's Council, an organization under the
government's Council of People's Attorneys, submitted its protest
to the Council of State, or president's office.
   Radio Rangoon has said at least 95 people were killed and 240
wounded in protests in two dozen towns last week, but Western
diplomats believe the toll was much higher.
   No major rallies have been reported since Sein Lwin resigned.
But a senior Western diplomat said the recent leaflet and poster
campaign indicated massive street protests would resume unless
authorities meet demands for leadership changes and multiparty
democracy.
   Another Rangoon-based diplomat said that while some students
would be satisfied with nothing less than dismantling one-party
rule, ``rank-and-file'' protesters might stay off the streets if
authorities make gradual concessions.

   Vice President Salvador Laurel said
Tuesday that government policy ``is drifting aimlessly'' under
President Corazon Aquino, and he gave her one week to resign.
   A Roman Catholic cardinal urged the leaders to settle their
differences.
   Presidential spokesman Teodoro Benigno said Mrs. Aquino has not
replied to a letter from Laurel that accused her government of
incompetence and urged her to resign and call new elections.
   ``I don't want to appear to be threatening her, so I give her
one week,'' Laurel told reporters. He did not elaborate.
   In the letter, released Saturday, Laurel offered to resign along
with Mrs. Aquino. If she refused, Laurel said he would
``dissociate'' himself from her government.
   ``If she does not resign, I will not resign (as vice
president),'' Laurel said. ``I will simply disengage myself from
her administration and speak out freely to expose all the acts that
are prejudicial to the national interest.''
   He said Mrs. Aquino was running the government without direction
and basing her decisions on maintaining her popularity.
   ``(Her policy) is drifting aimlessly, swaying wherever the wind
blows,'' said Laurel. ``What happens is that the ship of state is
moving nowhere. It's not anchored ... She tries to please
everybody, but in the end she will please nobody.''
   Cardinal Ricardo Vidal said it would not be wise for Mrs. Aquino
to resign ``as it will create a stoppage of ongoing government
programs.''
   ``Mrs. Aquino's resignation will have a big negative effect on
the administration,'' Vidal told reporters. ``So I propose that she
and Laurel sit down and talk their problems over to prevent a
discontinuity in government.''
   The country's other cardinal, Jaime L. Sin, said he would not
offer advice in the dispute unless ``there is an occasion.''
   In 1985, Sin convinced Laurel to abandon his presidential
ambitions and run as Mrs. Aquino's vice presidential candidate
against President Ferdinand Marcos, who was ousted in a
civilian-military uprising that brought the current government to
power.
   Laurel's growing isolation from the Aquino administration began
in September, when he resigned as foreign secretary because of
``fundamental differences.''
   On Monday, Laurel met with leaders of political opposition
groups _ including Sen. Juan Ponce Enrile and Marcos' New Society
Movement _ to try to assemble a new opposition alliance.
   Enrile said he supported Laurel's position on Mrs. Aquino, but
stopped short of endorsing early elections. The next presidential
election is scheduled for May 1992.

   Giant retailer Montgomery Ward has signed a
consent agreement promising to stop making claims about home
appliances that the government charges were false, the Federal
Trade Commission announced Tuesday.
   The FTC said Ward misrepresented the reliability of appliances
and the need to buy a service contract when it sold them.
   For example, the commission said, the sales staff falsely
claimed that routine maintenance was needed by some products, such
as televisions, washing machines, dryers and refrigerators.
   In addition, Ward misrepresented that its service contracts for
products covered routine maintenance when it did not, the FTC said.
   And, the FTC said, Wards did not have adequate substantiation
for its product-durability claims.
   Under terms of the consent agreement, Ward agreed to stop making
the contested claims relating to maintenance of products and to
stop making reliability claims for products unless it has evidence
to support them.

   The Red Army won't speed up its withdrawal from
Afghanistan because Moslem guerrillas there have rejected political
overtures and continue fighting the Soviet-backed government, the
government said Tuesday.
   The statement by Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady I. Gerasimov
reversed previous official indications that all of the more than
100,000 Soviet troops would be home by year's end.
   ``The situation in Afghanistan does not give grounds to
accelerate the withdrawal of Soviet troops,'' he told a regular
news briefing.
   Gerasimov indicated the Kremlin will stick to the timetable of
the U.N.-mediated agreement signed April 14 in Geneva. It directed
that the withdrawal begin May 15, with half the Soviet forces gone
by Aug. 15 and all removed from Afghanistan by Feb. 15, 1989.
   A U.N. statement confirmed Tuesday that the Aug. 15 deadline had
been met.
   The guerrillas have increased their attacks on Afghan government
troops and there will be no early Soviet withdrawal unless the
insurgents stop fighting and join a proposed governing coalition,
Gerasimov said.
   ``For the time being there is no possibility to reduce the plan
for withdrawing Soviet troops,'' he declared.
   Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze had indicated the
Kremlin would like all its soldiers home by the end of the year.
The official news agency Tass said Monday the second phase of the
withdrawal would begin in November.
   Afghan guerrillas began fighting after a Communiist coup in
April 1978 and Soviet military forces entered the country in
December 1978.
   More than 5 million people have fled Afghanistan. At least 3
million live in border cities and camps in Pakistan that serve as
bases and supply points for the insurgents.
   The guerrillas were not a party to the Geneva agreement and,
when it was signed, said they would continue the civil war.
   Tass reported ``fierce fighting'' Tuesday in Kunduz, a
provincial capital captured by insurgents when Soviet troops
abandoned it two weeks ago.
   President Najib of Afghanistan said Monday his forces had
recaptured the city, but guerrilla groups claimed Tuesday their
fighters were holding it.
   According to Tass, Afghan soldiers killed 100 insurgents Monday
and Tuesday around Kunduz. The city is north of Kabul, the capital,
and near the route used by Red Army troops moving north to the
Soviet border.
   Guerrillas also claim to have captured Talogan, capital of
Takhar province east of Kunduz.
   Rocket attacks on Kabul in the previous two days killed five
people and wounded 11, Tass said.
   Gerasimov denied American charges that departing Soviet forces
have left up to 30 million mines behind.
   ``We would like to state again that we are not involved in any
mining,'' he declared. The spokesman said Soviet soldiers have
helped Afghans remove and defuse mines planted by guerrillas along
major roads.
   He accused the U.S. State Department of following a ``double
standard'' by expressing concern for civilians exposed to mines but
not for those killed or wounded by guerrilla rocket attacks on
cities.
   In Washington on Tuesday, the State Department accused the
Soviets of ignoring U.S. requests for help in removing mines.
   ``We have contacted the Soviet Union on several occasions at a
high level to request Soviet cooperation with the U.N. effort to
clear the millions of mines that have been strewn throughout
Afghanistan,'' spokeswoman Phyllis Oakley said.
   ``The Soviet Union has been specifically asked to provide maps
of mine fields. The U.N. has also been in touch with the Soviet
government on this problem. To date we're not aware of any
significant Soviet effort to remove mines.''
   A U.N. statement issued in New York said Secretary-General
Javier Perez de Cuellar was ``satisfied that the withdrawal of
foreign troops has been proceeding in compliance with the fourth
instrument of the Geneva Accords.''
   Francois Giuliani, Perez de Cuellar's spokesman, who read the
statement at a news briefing, did say how many soldiers had been
withdrawn.
   The statement said the Kremlin informed U.N. officials May 14
that 100,300 Soviet military personnel were in Afghanistan. Western
estimates had put the total at 115,000.
   Fifty unarmed U.N. observers in Afghanistan and Pakistan are
charged with monitoring and verifying compliance with the Geneva
agreement, including the Soviet withdrawal.

   A moderate earthquake shook eastern
Puerto Rico and St. Thomas Tuesday, but no damages or injuries were
immediately reported on either island, officials said.
   William McCann, director of the island's earthquake network at
the University of Puerto Rico in Mayaguez, said the quake measured
4 on the Richter scale. He said its epicenter was 9 miles off the
southeast coast of Puerto Rico and 8.5 miles below the seabed.
   The temblor happened at 10:17 a.m. EDT and lasted several
seconds.
   In the U.S. Virgin Islands, Roy Pemberton, a volunteer at the
Territorial Emergency Management Agency, said the earthquake was
felt in St. Thomas but not St. Croix.
   The Richter scale is a gauge of the energy released by an
earthquake as measured by the ground motion recorded on a
seismograph. A quake measuring 4 can cause moderate damage, while
one measuring 5 can cause considerable damage.

   George Bush is heavily favored as a candidate by
members of a national small business organization, but fewer
members responding to a poll released Tuesday think he will
actually win the presidency.
   The survey of 600 members of the National Federation of
Independent Business indicated 78 percent supported Bush for
president and 58 percent thought he would defeat Democratic nominee
Michael Dukakis in November.
   Seventeen percent supported Dukakis and 20 percent expected him
to win, while 22 percent said they were unsure who would win. Five
percent either did not answer or had no favorite when asked whom
they supported.
   Ninety percent of those polled said they voted for Reagan in
1984.
   The group's membership is wealthier and more conservative than
the public at large and is dominated by men. Forty percent of those
polled made more than $50,000 a year, 81 percent were conservative
and 81 percent were male.
   The survey was conducted Monday by Tarrance & Associates and had
a margin of error of four points.

   Officials turned over a Soviet airman
to the Soviet Embassy on Tuesday, 12 days after he was shot down
inside Pakistan, the foreign secretary said.
   Humayun Khan identified the airman as Col. Alexander
Vladimirovich Rudskoi and said his Su-25 fighter was shot down by a
Pakistani F-16 fighter Aug. 4 near the village of Miranshah, less
than 15 miles from the Afghan border.
   Khan charged Rudskoi was on a combat mission, and the plane was
``fully armed and equipped with cluster bombs.'' He said Rudskoi
was captured after he parachuted from the plane.
   He also alleged that the Kremlin and Afghanistan's communist
government have staged other air raids in Pakistan in violation of
a U.N.-mediated plan for peace in Afghanistan.
   There was no immediate comment from Soviet diplomats in
Islamabad.
   The foreign secretary said members of a U.N. observation
witnessed the airman's release to the Soviet Embassy. Pakistan
asked the team to look into the incursion into Pakistani airspace.
   Under the Geneva accords, signed in April, the Soviets said they
would pull their troops out of Afghanistan by Feb. 15, 1989.
Soviet, Afghan and U.N. officials said half the troops had been
withdrawn by a Monday deadline. Soviet forces intervened in
Afghanistan in December 1979.
   The Soviet Union says Pakistan is a conduit for arms to Afghan
guerrillas and allows guerrilla bases on its territory in violation
of the pact.
   Khan said the Soviet plane was shot down while Foreign Minister
Sahabzada Yaqub Khan was in Moscow meeting with Soviet Foreign
Minister Eduard Shevardnadze.
   ``I might mention that, in (that) meeting, both sides assured
the other of their continued compliance with the Geneva accords.''
   On Aug. 3, four people were killed when an intruding Soviet or
Afghan fighter jet bombed Pakistan near Miranshah, Khan said.
   In October 1986, Pakistan captured six helicopter pilots who
landed in Pakistani territory. They later were released to the
Soviet Embassy, officials said.

   The United States on Tuesday began airlifting
Canadian troops to the Middle East for duty with a United Nations
unit that will monitor a cease-fire in the Iran-Iraq war, the
Defense Department said.
   About 20 U.S. Air Force C-5A cargo planes are being used in the
operation, a Pentagon statement said.
   The huge transport planes are picking up Canadian soldiers and
their radio equipment and flying them either directly to Iraq or to
Turkey, where they will board Canadian planes for the final flight
to Iran.
   ``U.S. aircraft are not going to Iran,'' the statement said.
   The giant Air Force planes are being dispatched from Dover Air
Force Base in Delaware and Travis AFB in California, the Pentagon
said. They are picking up a Canadian army signals unit in Trenton,
Ontario. That unit will provide communications for the U.N.
peacekeeping force.
   The Pentagon provided no indication of how long the airlift
operation would last, but the United Nations in New York said it
expected the operation to take no more than four days.
   The Pentagon said the U.S. government ``will bear the costs of
the airlift as a portion of its contribution to the peacekeeping
effort.''
   The airlift began as U. N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de
Cuellar asked the General Assembly for swift approval of $75.6
million needed to support the 1,300 personnel who will monitor the
cease-fire, which is scheduled to begin on Saturday morning.
   The United States is expected to be assessed about $23 million
for the Persian Gulf observer operation.

<TEXT>
   Bill Harris, whose prosecution of a
poor man led the U.S. Supreme Court to rule states must provide
attorneys to indigents, has died of cancer. He was 64.
   Harris, who also served in the Florida House from 1957 to 1961,
died Thursday.
   Harris prosecuted Clarence Earl Gideon for breaking into a pool
hall in this Panhandle city in 1961. Gideon was sent to prison, but
the Supreme Court overturned the verdict because Gideon didn't have
a lawyer.
   The ruling set a precedent that for the last 25 years has
required states to provide legal representation for people who
can't afford it.
   Gideon, represented by a court-appointed attorney, was acquitted
at the second trial.
   Harris, reminiscing about the trial earlier this year, said
every time Gideon walked into the courtroom, he said, ``Judge, I'm
entitled to a lawyer.''
   ``I think he was right,'' Harris said.
   Harris' role in the case was portrayed in ``Gideon's Trumpet,''
a movie featuring Henry Fonda as Gideon. It was based on a book of
the same title written by journalist Anthony Lewis.
   Gideon died in 1972 in a Fort Lauderdale hospital.
   Harris is survived by his wife, five children, his mother and
one brother.

   An Israeli peace crusader said Tuesday he is
trying to promote direct negotiations between Israel and the
Palestine Liberation Organization and has pitched his plan to U.S.
and Palestinian officials.
   Abie Nathan, who owns a shipboard radio station in the
Mediterranean called The Voice of Peace, is meeting this week with
American Jewish leaders in New York to present his blueprint.
   Nathan said he had conceived his plan in the wake of the
decision earlier this month by Jordan's King Hussein to relinquish
control of the Israeli-occupied West Bank. ``Without the Jordanian
option, we have a climate in which Israel and the PLO must talk to
each other,'' he said.
   Nathan declined to discuss specifics of his plan but said it
would require an ``initial step'' by the PLO and subsequent
gestures by Israel. Both Israel and the United States have said
they would not talk to the PLO until it recognizes Israel's right
to exist and renounces terrorism.
   Nathan said his plan was also based on the PLO making ``certain
gestures proving they can control the West Bank.''
   Earlier in the day, a Palestinian spokesman in Iraq said the
PLO's executive panel had approved the establishment of a
provisional government in Israeli-occupied territories. Bassam Abu
Sharif, a spokesman for PLO chief Yasser Arafat, also called on the
United States to support the formation of an independent
Palestinian state.
   Nathan, who flew a light plane from Israel to Egypt in 1966 when
the two countries were still at war, said he had asked for a
meeting with Arafat and was awaiting a response. He met last week
in Tunis with senior PLO officials but Arafat was away at the time,
Nathan added.
   He said he had met before with Arafat.
   Israeli law forbids meetings with the PLO, but Nathan said no
law would stop him from ``crossing borders or talking to people who
can bring about peace.''
   He said he had ``sent a message with someone'' to the Israeli
authorities informing them of his plans to meet with the PLO
officials. ``They were aware of my plans,'' he said.
   Nathan said he had met last week in Washington with officials at
the State Department and would remain in New York at least another
week to seek the support of Jewish leaders.
   The State Department confirmed that Nathan had met with Deputy
Assistant Secretary of State Edward S. Walker but declined to
discuss specifics of the conversation, saying it was simply an
exchange of views.
   Nathan, an Indian-born Jew, said he had asked the PLO officials
for information regarding five Israeli soldiers missing in action.

   Peasants started a fire that raged out of
control Tuesday in the grass and forests near the ancient ruins of
the Incas, officials said Tuesday.
   The blaze, which started a week ago, has not endangered Machu
Picchu, the famed ruins of a mountaintop Inca fortress, according
to Nicanor Moscoso, president of the State Commission for the
Preservation of Machu Picchu.
   About 200 troops and firefighters are fighting the blaze, which
is burning out of control four miles south of Machu Picchu,
according to Civil Defense chief, Gen. Jorge Ferreyros.
   The Lima daily El Comercio said southerly winds have kept the
blaze away from the ancient fortress. But many smaller ruins that
dot the region known as the Sacred Valley of the Incas are
threatened, according to Moscoso.
   El Comercio said the fire, which has spread across 3,750 acres
of land about 300 miles southeast of Lima, was started by peasants
who every year ignite tough, old grass on the pastures to allow new
growth.
   El Comercio said a river separates the blaze from villages near
the resort of Cuzco, 40 miles south of Machu Picchu.
   Officials said a train carrying tourists to Machu Picchu from
Cuzco still was operating on Tuesday.

<TEXT>
   The Nile has risen to its highest level
for mid-August and threatens Khartoum, where torrential rains have
left up to 1.5 million people homeless, experts said Tuesday.
   The swollen river runs through the city, still sodden from the
deluge Aug. 4-5. More rain fell Tuesday and large areas of the
capital are isolated by vast p water and roads that
have become impassable tracks of mud.
   More than 150,000 homes were destroyed and most people in the
affected areas have yet to receive aid from a relief operation
hampered by bad roads and lack of food and otheools of stagnantr supplies.
   Inundation by the Nile would worsen the relief problems but
officials are uncertain whether it will flood the city.
   An important factor is whether rains at the Ethiopian headwaters
of the Blue Nile, which joins the White Nile at Khartoum to form
the Nile River, will further engorge the river.
   Another source of uncertainty about what awaits Khartoum stems
from ignorance about which parts of the nearly flat city are lowest
and thus most vulnerable.
   British cartographers lent to the United Nations relief
operation are working on a contour map of the city that will help
determine at what height the Nile waters would start pouring into
the streets.
   The cartographers told reporters and relers on Monday, Lonsdale said.
   The plateau straddles U.S., Soviet and international waters, and
until now, Moscow did not allow American scientists to conduct
research in the Soviet zone.
   The plateau measures 250 miles by 60 miles and is part of a
longer chain of volcanic islands and submerged seamounts that
include Hawaii.
   ``It is a continuous trail of volcanic activity that leads 3,500
miles to Hawaii, a continuous line of volcanoes,'' Lonsdale said.
``The theories we are testing have to do with what might cause this
volcanic activity to start. We know the result, islands like
Hawaii.''
   Some recent studies suggest that islands and seamounts were
formed when weak spots in the Earth's crust passed over hot
volcanic spots.
   Among the sophisticated hardware aboard the Thomas Washington is
a high resolution bathymetric survey system known as Sea Beam, made
by the General Instrument Corp. Sea Beam sends 16 simultaneous
sonar signals toward the ocean floor, measures the return time and
uses a computer to make an acccurate topographic chart.
   The expedition is also collecting rock samples and cores from
the sea floor for later analysis, Lonsdale said.
   While the scientific results of the expedition will take weeks
or months to analyze, it has already broken diplomatic ground.
   The Soviet Union, like the United States, asseerts an economic
zone 200 miles off its coasts. But unlike Washington, Moscow
requires foreign scientists to obtain its permission to conduct
research in those waters, said William Erb, director of maritime
sciences at the State Department.
   Lonsdale's expedition marks ``the first time in 10 years that
the Soviets have authorized a U.S. research vessel to operate in
their economic zone,'' Erb said.
   The project was made possible by the exchange of diplomatic
notes in late 1987 reviving for one year the U.S.-U.S.S.R.
Agreement on Cooperation in Studies of the World Ocean, which was
signed in 1973 but allowed to lapse.
   U.S. and Soviet officials will meet in Washington starting Oct.
3 to negotiate three more American expeditions in Soviet waters
under the agreement, Erb said.
   Previously, he said, ``the Soviets had denied us permission and
were acting in a way that we felt was not in conformance with the
Law of the Sea and normal practice. We raised the issue in
bilateral diplomatic conversations,'' but not in an international
forum.

<HEAD>Delegates Adopt 1992 Rules After Humphrey Forces Give Up Fight</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW ORLEANS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Delegates at the Republican National
Convention on Tuesday unanimously adopted new rules governing the
selection of delegates to the 1992 convention as conservatives
decided not to fight a change in the vice presidential nominating
process.
   Sen. Gordon Humphrey, R-N.H., and other conservatives had
threatened to challenge a rules change allowing the convention to
do away with a state-by-state roll call vote on the vice
presidential nominee if only one name is placed in nomination.
   But when Elizabeth Dole, the convention's temporary chairman,
took a voice vote on the changes, there was no debate and no
dissenting votes were heard. Humphrey was not seen on the
convention floor.
   The campaign of Republican nominee-to-be George Bush had
requested the change to conserve a half-hour or more of prime-time
television time on Thursday night when the convention will nominate
Bush's running mate.
   Humphrey, who had demanded that Bush pick a conservative to fill
the No. 2 spot on the ticket, said earlier he wanted to block
adoption of the rule change so he and others could vote for someone
else if they didn't like Bush's selection.
   Aside from the change in the vice presidential nominating
process and a few technical changes, the new rules are the same as
those passed by the 1984 convention.
   Republican rules can be changed only by a national convention.
   Also on Tuesday, the convention adopted the report of the
credentials committee, officially allowing the delegates to take
their seats. Challenges were settled in meetings last week.

<TEXT>
   Advisers to the family of Tawana Brawley said
Tuesday that the 16-year-old girl would refuse to comply if a grand
jury subpoenaed her to testify about her charges that she was raped
by a gang of white men.
   The New York Times reported that a grand jury had voted to
subpoena the Wappingers Falls teen-ager. Her advisers said Tuesday
that they knew of no such subpoena but that she would defy it if it
was issued.
   ``There's no way in heaven, earth or hell we will let Tawana
Brawley participate in the cover-up of what happened to her,'' said
the Rev. Al Sharpton, a Brawley family adviser.
   Tim Gilles, a spokesman for state Attorney General Robert
Abrams, said he had no comment and would neither confirm nor deny
that a subpoena was voted.
   The newspaper report said the grand jury acted against the
wishes of Abrams, the special prosecutor in charge of investigating
Miss Brawley's allegations.
   Sharpton and two other family advisers, attorneys C. Vernon
Mason and Alton Maddox, maintained that Miss Brawley would not give
testimony when authorities have no intention of arresting white men
whom a black girl identifies as her attackers. They are demanding
that Abrams be replaced as prosecutor.
   Earlier, the grand jury sent Miss Brawley two letters requesting
her testimony, which she ignored. Unlike those letters, a subpoena
would carry a threat of jail for non-compliance.
   Miss Brawley's mother, Glenda, is facing a 30-day jail term for
contempt for defying a subpoena of the grand jury. Police have put
off arresting her in circumstances that might lead to dangerous
disorder; Mrs. Brawley has remained free by staying in churches or
out of the state.
   Critics have accused the advisers of manipulating Miss Brawley
to advance their own political agenda.
   Miss Brawley disappeared for four days last November and gave
only fragmentary statements after she was found smeared with
excrement and with racial epithets penned on her body.
   In charging that the state was running a racially motivated
cover-up, the advisers have accused law-enforcement officials of
participating in the crime, but have provided no evidence.

<TEXT>
   Republican Senate hopeful Beau Boulter
unveiled his first major television ad campaign Tuesday, previewing
a spot that will lampoon Sen. Lloyd Bentsen for running two races
at once.
   Using humorous clips from several old movies, the commercial
shows actors trying to ride two horses at the same time, holding up
a saddle with no horse under it and falling off a horse into a hole.
   ``We all wish we had two chances to win. But any real Texan will
tell you can get hurt riding more than one horse at a time,'' says
the narrator.
   Bentsen was chosen last month as vice presidential running mate
by Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis. Under Texas' 1959 ``Lyndon
Law,'' passed for then Sen. Lyndon Johnson, Bentsen's name is
allowed to appear on the Texas ballot in both that race and his bid
for a fourth Senate term.
   Bentsen began airing his first round of Senate election
commercials last week. Boulter and his campaign manager, Greg
Graves, complain that the Senate and vice presidential campaigns
overlap.
   ``The message that I get from his television commercials ... is
the people of Texas should elect him to the U.S. Senate and then he
will resign,'' said Boulter, who is attending the GOP National
Convention this week.
   ``Our commercial says that Lloyd Bentsen simply does not want to
be the U.S. senator for Texas and that Beau Boulter does,'' the
Amarillo congressman said.
   The commercial narrator's, voice, in a Western twang, also seeks
to calls attention to the differences between Texas and Democrat
Dukakis' home state.
   ``Lloyd Bentsen says he's running in two races _ riding a cow
pony to impress us back in Texas and riding sidesaddle for his new
Massachusetts friends. Ol' Lloyd is really hedging his bets,'' it
says.

   Bishop College, founded by freed slaves and once
the largest black university west of the Mississippi River, has
been forced by bankruptcy to shut its doors after 108 years.
   ``We feel that it's a tragedy that a college that had such great
expertise in educating disadvantaged and minority students was not
able to survive because there was no money available,'' said
Harriet Schimel, vice president of communications for the United
Negro College Fund.
   The school's debts increased over the last few years and by
April 1987, when it filed for protection from its creditors under
Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy Code, it owed $12.6 million to
400 creditors.
   By Monday, when it filed for Chapter 7 proceedings, the figure
had grown to $20 million; the school said it was unable to raise
the $1.85 million needed to keep it opened.
   Liquidation of the college's assets _ 21 buildings on 400 acres
_ will begin as soon as a trustee is appointed.
   ``I'm personally and professionally hurt,'' said John Q. Taylor
King, a longtime educator and former president of Huston-Tillotson,
another black college in Texas.
   Bishop, founded in 1881 in the small northeast Texas town of
Marshall, built its reputation on its graduates _ among them
lawyers, teachers, doctors and ministers.
   The school moved to Dallas in 1961. At the height of its
success, about 1,500 students were enrolled in 1967; last year,
that figure had dipped to 300.
   Scandal rocked the school in the late 1970s when three top
administrators were indicted on charges of embezzling student aid
funds. Two were acquitted and one was convicted on a misdemeanor
charge.
   Bishop's image never recovered, and neither did its fund-raising
efforts.
   In December 1986, Bishop lost accreditation from the Southern
Association of Colleges and Schools, which in turn forced the
United Negro College Fund to stop contributing money.
   Though the school is bankrupt, educators say the need for the
college still exists.
   The dropout rate for blacks is lower at historically black
colleges than at other schools, Ms. Schimel said.

   George Bush announced today that Sen. Dan
Quayle of Indiana will be his running mate, adding a youthful
accent to the 1988 Republican ticket with the 41-year-old
politician.
   At a welcoming rally for the Republican nominee-to-be, Bush
unveiled his choice.
   ``My choice is an outstsanding U.S. senator. He is a leader in
matters of national security,'' Bush said, adding that Quayle is
``a man of the future.''
   When Bush arrived here from Washington this morning, Bush gave
no clues to his decision, but he started making calls to the winner
and the losers in his vice presidential sweepstakes.

   Israeli troops fired
on hundreds of rioting Palestinians at a Negev Desert prison camp
Tuesday, killing two and wounding a third, the army said.
   Troops also shot and wounded six Palestinians in scattered
clashes in the occupied territories, hospital officials said. A
military curfew kept 650,000 Gazans inside their homes for a second
straight day.
   Army officials said dozens of Palestinians also were injured in
scuffles with troops in Gaza, and Arab hospital officials in the
seaside strip said they treated 75 people for beating injuries.
   Rioting erupted in the prison camp at Ketziot, about 20 miles
southeast of the Gaza Strip, after news reached inmates about the
curfew and unrest in Gaza, Israel Television said.
   An army spokesman said troops put down the riot by firing on the
Arabs, killing two of them. He said one of those killed was from
the Gaza Strip and the other was from the West Bank village of
Yamoun north of Nablus.
   The riot broke out in the afternoon and was over by nightfall,
he said.
   Most of the about 2,500 inmates confined at Ketziot have been
jailed for up to six months without trial under special security
measures.
   Human rights groups and Palestinian attorneys have complained of
poor food and living conditions at the camp, where inmates are held
in a series of tents in the scorching desert heat.
   The deaths at Ketziot brought to 247 the number of Arabs killed
since the Palestinian rebellion broke out Dec. 8. Four Israelis
have died.
   In another development Tuesday, military officials said troops
have begun using a new plastic bullet in the territories which is
designed to cause fewer casualties.
   Introduction of the bullet follows complaints from human rights
groups and Palestinians that rubber bullets used previously caused
serious injury, including eye loss, and occasionally death.
   Israel radio said the new bullet was potentially lethal at a
range of under 70 yards.
   Also Tuesday, a Palestinian from the Gaza Strip died of burns he
suffered in a suspected arson attack last week near Tel Aviv,
Israel radio said.
   Two other Arabs were also killed in the torching, which
officials have said might be linked to Arab-Israeli tensions. The
incident prompted widespread rioting in the Gaza Strip over the
weekend.
   In another development, the army said it was removing a colonel
from his post as brigade commander because of his involvement in
the shooting death of an 18-year-old Palestinian from the West Bank
village of Bani Naim.
   A military spokesman said the Palestinian, Mohammed Abed Maadi
Al Zaidan, was participating in a violent protest when he was
killed April 4. An army investigation determined he was not
threatening the soldiers' lives when he was shot.
   ``It was decided the officer, who was brigade commander and
responsible for the chase and the shooting, used bad judgment and
will be immediately removed from his position,'' the spokesman said.
   During clashes with Arab stone-throwers in the West Bank's
largest city of Nablus, soldiers shot and seriously wounded three
Palestinians, officials at the city's Al Ittihad Hospital said.
   Troops also shot two refugees at Gaza's Nusseirat camp during
clashes with curfew violators who hurled rocks at them, officials
at the Ahli Arab Hospital in Gaza City said.
   Officials at Gaza City's Shifa Hospital said 75 Palestinians
were treated for beating injuries on the head, arms and legs that
they receievd during pre-dawn house-to-house army searches.
   Arab sources in Gaza said troops entered homes, beating and
clubbing Arab youths suspected of breaking the curfew Monday and
hurling rocks at soldiers.
   The curfew was imposed on the entire strip Sunday night after a
weekend of violence. During a military curfew residents are
forbidden to leaving their homes.
   Gazans reached by telephone Tuesday said the curfew was not
being strictly enforced.
   ``People go out and walk around. Especially children are running
and playing until they see soldiers, then they hide. In my
neighborhood, some shops are even open, doing business from the
back doors,'' said Adnan Murtaja of Gaza City.
   In the West Bank, 21,350 Palestinians stopped receiving salaries
from Jordan as part of a move by King Hussein to cut ties with
Arabs in the territories.
   About 5,200 employees were laid off. Another 16,150 people
employed in the health, education and agriculture sectors will
continue in their jobs receiving salaries only from Israel,
according to Yassir Obeid, director of the Jordanian-run West Bank
Health Department.

   Ronald Reagan didn't choose his vice
presidential running mate until almost the last minute, Jimmy
Carter conducted a long, boring search, and Adlai Stevenson
declined to choose at all. They all did it their way and so did
George Bush.
   Bush's decision to keep everybody guessing _ until Tuesday
afternoon _ was the No. 2 topic at the Republican National
Convention, which had little else to talk about. No. 1, of course,
was the choice itself.
   Bush brought all that speculation to an abrupt end Tuesday
afternoon with his announcement that he had selected Sen. Dan
Quayle of Indiana as his running mate.
   In holding his cards close to his vest, Bush was only doing unto
others what Reagan did to him. All evening, on Wednesday of 1980
Republican Convention week in Detroit, it looked as if former
President Gerald Ford would be Reagan's choice for vice president.
The way Ford saw it, if they won they would have sort of a shared
presidency.
   But at 11:15 p.m. Reagan and Ford agreed not to be a team and
Bush received a telephone call. As Bush recalls in his
autobiography, the conversation went like this:
   ``Hello, George, this is Ron Reagan. I'd like to go over to the
convention and announce that you're my choice for vice president if
that's all right with you.''
   ``I'd be honored, Governor.''
   ``George is there anything at all ... about the platform or
anything else, anything that might make you uncomfortable down the
road.''
   Bush could think of nothing. A few minutes after midnight,
Reagan made an unusual trip to convention hall to announced his
choice, a dramatic end to a dramatic night of speculation and rumor.
   Despite the long list of vice presidential hopefuls that came to
be interviewed in Plains, Ga. in 1976, Carter didn't announce his
choice of Walter Mondale until Thursday, the day the vice
presidential nomination went before the delegates.
   The fact that both tickets with last minute running mate choices
won probably hadn't escaped Bush. The fact that Walter Mondale
picked Geraldine Ferraro in advance in 1984 _ and they lost the
election _ might also have made an impression.
   The choice of a running mate is probably the most important
early decision a presidential candidate makes. Thirteen vice
presidents have become president, eight on the death of a president.
   In 1956, Democratic nominee Adlai Stevenson startled the
convention in Chicago by leaving the choice of his running mate to
the delegates. As a result, votes were distributed among 13
candidates after the first ballot.
   Sen. Estes Kefauver of Tennessee had 483{ votes, followed by
Sen. John F. Kennedy of Massachusetts with 304 and Sen. Albert Gore
of Tennessee with 178.
   On the second ballot, Kennedy had the lead after the roll call,
but before the chair recognized vote changes. Gore pulled out,
began a bandwagon for Kefauver, and Kennedy moved that Kefauver's
nomination be made unanimous. The ticket lost.
   With that exception, every vice presidential nominee in modern
times has been the presidential nominee's choice _ albeit an uneasy
choice, sometimes. In 1944, Franklin D. Roosevelt didn't want to
run with Vice President Henry Wallace but had no other favorite. He
was persuaded to accept Harry S. Truman, who then succeeded him 82
days after the inauguration when Roosevelt died.
   In 1960, Kennedy offered the No. 2 spot to Lyndon B. Johnson,
thinking that his chief opponent for the presidential nomination
would not accept. Johnson did, helped Kennedy win by bringing in
Southern states, and became president when JFK was assassinated in
1963.
   When Johnson ran for president in 1964, Republican nominee Barry
Goldwater picked Rep. William E. Miller as a teammate, saying ``one
of the reasons I chose Miller is that he drives Johnson nuts.''

   Bob and Elizabeth Dole, Ramrod and Rainbow in
the Secret Service code book, saw their fortunes as the vice
presidential twins of the Republican National Convention rise
together and fall together.
   The Senate Republican leader and his wife, the former secretary
of transportation, have earned a unique footnote in American
political history.
   The Doles got word Tuesday that they were out of the running for
the No. 2 spot _ although Dole was told he had been one of two
finalists. A short time later, Vice President George Bush announced
he had selected Sen. Dan Quayle of Indiana to be his running mate.
   They were almost certainly the first married couple to be
considered individually for a vice presidential nomination.
   They joke about their situation. They joke about it a lot.
   ``I'm not running for vice president,'' Dole said this week.
``I'm not campaigning for anyone. But she would make a great vice
president.''
   Or: ``We're not running. But when the phone rings, she says,
`Let me get it.'''
   Or: ``If Bush calls, the man _ or woman _ who picks up the phone
will say, `I take it,' and hang up fast.''
   ``It is a bit of a novelty to have a husband and wife under
consideration as running mates,'' Elizabeth Dole said as convention
week opened. ``But I truly mean it when I say I'm not running for
it and neither is Bob.''
   She said she was more worried about her job as the GOP
convention's temporary chairman. ``That gavel is so big I
understand it may take two hands to handle it.''
   The Doles are one of the capital's power couples, a fact the
senator likes to capitalize on.
   At the 1983 Gridiron Dinner given by the nation's press, Dole
told the audience: ``I'm happy to be here with the country's second
most powerful couple _ Ron and Nancy Reagan.''
   A favorite line: ``She has her career and I have my career and
we have our career _ whatever that is.''
   Mrs. Dole often cannot control an urge to take a playful swipe
at her politician husband.
   At a publisher's convention a few years ago she explained her
commitment to air bags in automobiles saying, ``I ought to know, I
married one.''
   ``The Doles are a hell of a one-two punch. ...,'' says Robert
Strauss, former chairman of the Democratic National Committee.
``It's like adding two and two and getting five.''
   Sen. Dole is notorious in the world of politics for his dark
humor and his biting tongue.
   With an occasional lapse he has tried to curb that tongue in
recent years, especially since his marriage.
   ``According to popular theory, Elizabeth was responsible for my
sudden mellowing,'' he says.
   The Doles penned a book issued earlier this year. Their subject
was themselves. The title: ``The Doles, Unlimited Partners.''
   They used it to sketch the outlines of their lives and to define
themselves as public figures in the late 20th century.
   Dole credited his wife for helping to broaden his outlook but
said she wasn't the only influence.
   ``With all due respects to Elizabeth, it would be unusual if age
and experience hadn't broadened my perspective,'' he wrote. ``In
truth, most of those who talked about a new Bob Dole hadn't known
the old one very well. What had changed was not my character or
personality but my role in the Senate, where success is impossible
to achieve unless you have the votes on your side.''
   The Doles have figured in vice presidential speculation for
years. Sen. Dole, of course, actually ran for vice president as
President Gerald R. Ford's running mate in 1976.
   Elizabeth Dole was once asked if her husband could adjust to
actually being No. 2 to a sitting president.
   She said he could.
   But Dole wasn't so sure about becoming No. 2.
   ``One and a half maybe,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   The city has offered a $17,312 settlement
to pay a blind woman for her humiliation after she was forced by a
policeman to clean up after her guide dog.
   Raygena Harper, a 25-year-old stockbroker, sued the city over
the September 1985 incident. She said she would accept the
settlement offer from the city attorney's office, which also must
be approved by the Board of Supervisors.
   ``The reason I will settle for this amount is that it has been
going on since 1985,'' she said. ``I'd prefer to go to trial
because I would win hands down. It isn't the money ... they could
pay me $500,000 and it wouldn't be enough for what they did.''
   The officer, Aaron Barnes, a 22-year police veteran, said, ``I
was just doing my job.''
   ``I didn't know she was blind and that it was a guide dog,'' he
said.
   Barnes stopped Harper as she was walking to lunch with some
co-workers and friends, accompanied by her guide dog, Flora.
   She said in her lawsuit that the dog indicated it needed to
defecate, so she led it to the gutter next to the curb.
   Moments later, she said, Barnes walked up and ordered her to
clean up after the dog in accordance with the city's
``pooper-scooper'' law that requires pet-owners to dispose of an
animal's waste.
   Harper said she protested that she was blind and that owners of
guide dogs are exempt from that ordinance. This was confirmed by
City Attorney Louise Renne.
   Harper said she became ``increasingly distressed and humiliated
as a large crowd gathered,'' and that despite her repeated
protestations, Barnes forced her ``to clean up after (her) dog with
a paper tissue, insert the waste into a paper bag and travel across
the street to deposit the bag in a garbage receptacle.''
   Although Barnes claimed he didn't know Harper was blind, she
said: ``I told him more than five times. I'm a very aware
individual, considering that I'm blind. I know the laws and my
rights, but he would not relent.''
   Barnes, who said he suffers high blood pressure and went on
unpaid sick leave in 1986, said he hadn't realized then that blind
people using guide dogs are exempt from the pooper-scooper law.
   ``No, I didn't have that knowledge at the time. I learned it
later. This is blown all out of proportion. I had no knowledge at
the time that she even was blind, and no one came forward to say
she was blind.''

   American factories, mines and utilities
operated at 83.5 percent of capacity in July, the highest operating
level in eight years, the government reported Tuesday.
   The Federal Reserve said the operating rate climbed a sharp 0.4
percentage point last month and now stands 2.4 percentage points
higher than it was a year ago as American manufacturers continued
to benefit from a boom in export sales.
   The government said in a separate report Tuesday that the U.S.
trade deficit rose sharply to $12.5 billion in June even though
exports remained close to their record highs set earlier this year.
   It was the fourth consecutive monthly increase in the industrial
operating rate and put it at its highest level since March 1980,
when American industry was operating at 83.7 percent of capacity.
   The increase was further evidence that inflationary pressures
are building in the economy, analysts said.
   The Federal Reserve's top policymakers met behind closed doors
Tuesday to review monetary strategy. A week ago, the central bank
boosted a key lending rate as a way of trying to dampen
inflationary pressures. It hiked its discount rate, the fee it
charges on loans to member banks, from 6 percent to 6.5 percent.
   Analysts predicted further less dramatic credit tightening in
the weeks ahead as the Fed makes further efforts to dampen demand
and ease pressures on tight labor markets and U.S. industries
already operating at high levels.
   ``The Fed has put out the message that it is time to put on the
brakes,'' said David Wyss, an economist with Data Resources Inc. of
Lexington, Mass.
   Wyss said the overall operating rate is still below traditional
peaks at the end of expansionary periods of around 87 percent. But
he said at the rate manufacturing has expanded in the past year,
the country will be closing in on that top level in the next year.
   Some industries, in fact, are already above those levels, with
paper plants operating at 92.8 percent of capacity and textile
mills at 89.6 percent of capacity.
   The operating rate at all manufacturing plants climbed to 83.7
percent of capacity, up from 83.2 percent in June. This compared
with an average over the past 20 years of 80.6 percent and a low in
the 1981-82 recession of 68 percent.
   Factories making durable goods, items expected to last at least
three years, saw their operating rate rise to 82.3 percent of
capacity from 81.7 percent in June.
   The increase came even though the operating rate at auto plants
dipped to 71.4 percent of capacity from 75.3 percent in May.
   Plants producing non-durable goods saw the operating rate rise
to 85.8 percent from 85.4 percent.
   The mining sector, which includes oil and gas well drilling, had
an increase to 82.3 percent from 81.7 percent in June.
   The nation's utilities, which have been working to meet
increased air conditioning demands prompted by the summer heat
wave, operated at 84.2 percent of capacity in July, up from 83.4
percent in June.

   In this city where revelry is routine and
sensuality is as palpable as the pungent aroma of Cajun spices,
Utah's conservative, mostly Mormon GOP delegation has found little
to remind it of home.
   If the state settled by Brigham Young's pioneers has an
opposite, this is the place.
   When other delegates to the Republican National Convention head
for Bourbon Street's bars after the nightly floor sessions, the
Utah delegation offers a ``nightcap'' of ice cream flown in by
delegate Richard Snelgrove, part-owner of Snelgrove Ice Cream Co.
Inc. of Salt Lake City.
   And by Tuesday, only a few cans were missing from two cases of
Dixie brand beer delivered as a courtesy to the Utah hospitality
room.
   At least 20 of Utah's 26 delegates identify themselves as
members of the Mormon Church, which discourages the use of alcohol,
tobacco, coffee and tea. But Utah leads the nation in per capita
consumption of ice cream.
   Ice cream is sold in the French Quarter, too, but it is not a
goal of most of the people strolling the narrow streets. The
principal attraction is the irreverent celebration that begins at
sundown and doesn't stop until almost dawn.
   In Utah the sale of mixed drinks is banned except in private
clubs, but they can be purchased to go in open-front bars along
Bourbon Street. Utah law forbids nude dancing, but in the Quarter's
burlesque clubs, dancers ply their trade, up to a point, before
open doors.
   Among the temptations are the blackened redfish, jambalaya,
gumbo and other Cajun dishes offered by the city's scores of
restaurants.
   Alex Hurtado, a delegate from Ogden who has been to New Orleans
before, warned dieting delegates at their first meeting.
   ``You've got to treat this like a Scarlett O'Hara convention,''
he said. ``You've got to think, frankly, you don't give a damn, and
eat. This is a 20-pound convention.''

   Several hundred people remained at St.
John Neumann Roman Catholic Church on Tuesday to pray and share
accounts of the miracles they claimed to have witnessed the night
before.
   While about 50 people lined up inside the darkened sanctuary to
pray and leave flowers before a small statue of the Virgin Mary,
others gathered in small groups in the courtyard outside to talk
about what they had seen during Monday's evening Mass.
   One woman stopped by the fountain to dip her rosary beads in the
water.
   Thousands of worshipers interrupted the outdoor service early
Monday evening with cries and applause as hundreds claimed to see
Jesus and Mary when a ray of light burst through the clouds. Some
worshipers said the sun appeared to dance in the sky, while dozens
reported that the silver beads on their rosaries turned to a gold
color.
   Others in the crowd, including several priests, said they saw
nothing in the sky but the sun and clouds, but the pastor of the
church said it looked to him like ``a host spinning inside the
sun.''
   Lou Shaffner showed three photographs of the sky she had taken
Monday. In one photo, amid the clouds and rays of sunlight, a faint
line was visible, and Mrs. Shaffner said she perceived a window
frame in that picture.
   ``I took these in sequence,'' she said. ``The sun looked blue.
It kind of danced. It did it three times, like the Father, the Son
and the Holy Ghost.''
   Mrs. Shaffner's mother, Marie Blood, said the silver-colored
crucifix on her chain of rosary beads turned gold.
   ``This belonged to my father and I've had it for all these
years,'' she said. ``I never thought this would happen.''
   About 12,000 people came to St. John Neumann, a charismatic
church, after three parishioners reported receiving messages from
the Virgin Mary. ``I will look upon you and you will see my eyes,''
one reported message said. Other messages told the parish to
prepare for miracles on Monday's Feast of the Assumption, which
celebrates the entry of the Virgin Mary into Heaven after her death.
   Reports of phenomena similar to those reported Monday have been
received from pilgrims to Medjugorje, Yugoslavia. In that small,
mountain village, six youths have claimed to have received messages
and seen apparitions of Mary.
   Neither the reported occurrences in Yugloslavia nor at St. John
Neumann have been officially endorsed or recognized by the Catholic
Church.
   After the first messages were reported, Bishop Micheal Sheehan
of the Lubbock Diocese had urged worshipers to treat the messages
with caution. He was out of town Tuesday and not available for
comment on Monday's reports, his office said.

<HEAD>Sharon Calls For Annexation Of Parts Of Occupied Territories</HEAD>

   Ariel Sharon, a Cabinet minister and militant
member of the right-wing Likud bloc, said Tuesday that Israel
should annex parts of the occupied Palestinian territories
immediately.
   The rival Labor Party announced changes in its election platform
to emphasize peace talks with Palestinians rather than negotiations
led by Jordan that would include Palestinians.
   King Hussein of Jordan announced a decision two weeks ago to cut
most of his legal, administrative and economic ties with the
Israeli-occupied West Bank of the Jordan River and the Gaza Strip.
Israel captured the West Bank from Jordan and the Gaza Strip from
Egypt in the 1967 Middle East war.
   Jordan's monarch said indirectly it was up to the Palestinians
to determine the future of any peace negotiations with Israel,
which had sought talks with a joint Jordanian-Palestinian
delegation that would not include representatives of the Palestine
Liberation Organization.
   Sharon, the trade and industry minister, told a news conference
in Jerusalem the time was right for annexation because Hussein's
actions dissolved proposed peace negotiations.
   ``This may be the last moment to take security steps,'' he said,
and Israel should move quickly before the ``psychological,
political vacuum'' created by Hussein's decision is filled,
presumably by the PLO.
   He said the PLO appeared ready to declare an independent state
in the occupied territories, which would create ``strong
international opposition (to Israeli annexation). Today it's still
possible.''
   During a weekend meeting in Amman, Jordan, of PLO and Jordanian
delegations, the possibility of creating a ``provisional
Palestinian government'' in the territories was discussed,
according to PLO sources.
   Sharon said: ``There already is a Palestinian state. Jordan is
the Palestinian state.''
   A group of people from the left-wing Citizens Rights Movement
demonstrated outside the building where Sharon held the news
conference. One banner said, ``From the architect of the Lebanon
war to the architect of annexation.''
   Sharon was defense minister when Israel invaded Lebanon in June
1962. Israel withdrew the bulk of its forces three years later.
   Labor Party leaders debated the party's platform for November's
national elections and approved changes on possible peace talks.
The changes must be ratified by two higher party organizations.
   The newspaper Haaretz said that under the proposed platform,
Labor would strive for peace talks with Hussein in accordance with
its policy of talking to a joint Palestinian-Jordanian delegation.
   But ``Labor also will be ready to talk to Palestinian elements
and personalities who recognize Israel, renounce terror'' and
accept U.N. Security Council resolutions recognizing Israel's right
to exist, the new platform plank said, according to Haaretz..
   It said Israel would talk with ``agreed representatives of the
people of the territories, even if Jordan would not take part in
the negotiations.''
   Both Likud and Labor have refused to negotiate with the PLO,
describing it is a terrorist organization dedicated to the
destruction of Israel.
   They have been in a fractious coalition since 1984 elections in
which neither won a parliamentary majority.

   George Bush tapped youthful, conservative
Sen. Dan Quayle of Indiana on Tuesday to be his Republican running
mate. ``I do not intend to fail'' in the quest for the White House,
the vice president vowed as he arrived to claim his party's
presidential nomination.
   ``Dan Quayle's a man of the future,'' Bush said as he introduced
his fair-haired running mate at an outdoor campaign rally on the
banks of the Mississippi River.
   In his first utterance as a national candidate, Quayle thanked
Bush for his confidence and immediately showed off the exuberance
he will bring to the ticket in the uphill race against the
Democrats this fall. ``Let's go get 'em!'' he shouted.
   ``We will win because America cannot afford to lose,'' said the
41-year-old senator. ``There is nothing more important in this
country than freedom, and George Bush will keep the freedom and
peace.''
   Said an obviously delighted Bush, ``Well done, Danny.''
   Republican National Convention delegates were settling in for an
evening of speechmaking from the likes of former President Gerald
Ford, television evangelist Pat Robertson and keynoter Gov. Tom
Kean of New Jersey. But barring a late night visit by Bush and
Quayle to the Superdome podium, it was a safe bet that the day's
drama was elsewhere.
   Bush's selection of a running mate was part of an attempt by his
high command to depict the vice president as the new, undisputed
leader of the Republican Party. In a carefully scripted changing of
the GOP guard, he flew to the convention city and strolled across a
windy tarmac to bid ``hail and farewell'' to a departing President
Reagan.
   Quayle's selection drew raves from party leaders, although New
Hampshire Gov. John Sununu admitted to being ``a little
disappointed'' at being passed over. Arizona Sen. John McCain said
his congressional colleague is ``extremely telegenic in this day of
television and images.''
   Quayle, a second-term senator from a reliably Republican state,
won his Senate seat in the 1980 Reagan landslide.
   Mark Gearan, a spokesman for Michael Dukakis, said Quayle's
selection would make no difference in the Democratic strategy. ``We
have always promised and will continue to run a 50-state national
campaign, and this will not sizeably affect our campaign effort at
all,'' he said.
   But Republican strategists said otherwise. Campaign adviser
Charlie Black said Quayle ``should give us a chance to appeal to
baby boom voters'' and strengthen GOP appeal in the Midwest.
   The choice of the Indiana senator was something of a surprise,
although he had long been rumored to be under consideration and had
made clear his interest in joining the ticket.
   In turning to the telegenic Midwesterner, Bush bypassed better
known conservatives such as Rep. Jack Kemp, and durable party
stalwarts such as Sen. Bob Dole of Kansas and former White House
Chief of Staff Howard Baker.
   Bush told Dole he'd been the other finalist, according to an
aide to the Kansas senator.
   Standing in shirtsleeves at the outdoor celebration, Bush
declared, ``Dan Quayle's a man of the future, a young man, a young
man born in the middle of this century and from the middle of
America. He's a dynamic young leader for the future of our party.''
   The audience roared its approval.

   Elvis Presley fans lined up to visit the
singer's grave on the 11th anniversary of his death Tuesday,
undismayed by heat in the high 90s or a new book that has set off a
wave of jokes about their idol.
   The book ``Is Elvis Alive?'' disputes that he died of heart
disease Aug. 16, 1977, at his Graceland mansion.
   But there was no question Tuesday as fans and other tourists
came to visit the estate and pay their respects. More than 70
stands of flowers, many shaped like guitars or hearts, lined the
walk to Presley's grave.
   A vigil and candlelight graveside procession on the eve of the
anniversary attracted 3,000 people, according to Memphis police.
   ``This is the next best thing we're going to get to seeing
Elvis,'' said Graham Knowles, an Elvis fan who traveled from Leeds,
England, to Memphis.
   ``It's too simple to say we just liked his music. It's much more
than that,'' Knowles said. ``It's more of a respect and admiration.
He's admired as a human being.''
   Organizers of a nine-day celebration called ``Elvis
International Tribute Week'' said the latest Elvis book upset and
offended fans by its claims and the jokes and speculation it has
prompted. But fans appeared to be taking it in stride.
   Karen Loper, an Elvis fan club leader from Houston, Texas, said
many fans plan to simply ignore it.
   ``In the fan club newsletters I've read, everybody is putting it
down and laughing about it,'' she said.
   Gene Carothers, an Elvis-look-alike fan from Gnadenhutten, Ohio,
said he was keeping on guard just in case Presley did show up.
   ``You never know,'' he said.
   The anniversary crowd, though about equal in size to previous
years, was noticeably smaller than last year's 10th anniversary,
which drew record numbers of believers, reporters and photographers.
   Graceland draws 600,000 visitors a year and 3,500 to 4,000
tourists go through the house on any typical summer day. The
anniversary of the singer's death draws some of the most devoted
fans, however, and Graceland managers organize musical shows, a
memorial, trivia contest, a foot race and other events.

   Spending six months in a sweltering prison cell
still hasn't soured Sam Gilley on Kuwait, although the native Texan
said Tuesday his only crime was having homemade hooch in his home.
   ``I'd go back tomorrow. I have no animosity towards those
people,'' said Gilley, a 52-year-old oil engineer. ``They've got
their set of rules and they play by a different set of rules than
us.''
   Gilley and 45-year-old Dean Gillette, also an oil engineer, flew
from Kuwait to London on Tuesday after their release.
   Gilley, who lost 32 pounds during his six months in a hot tin
and concrete prison, and Gillette were pardoned by the Emir of
Kuwait, reportedly after intervention by Vice President George Bush.
   ``When they came to my cell, I thought they were joking,''
Gilley said in his London hotel room after a reunion with his wife,
Dee, and a former employer, Frank Simmons, who worked to free them.
   Gillette, who has high blood pressure and a heart condition,
rested in another room after a reunion with his wife, Marie.
   Simmons said Bush helped free the men by persuading Kuwait's
Crown Prince Sheik Saad Abdullah Sabah to ask Emir Sheik Jaber
Ahmed Sabeh to pardon them.
   ``If they want to know where George was, we know where he was,''
said Gilley, referring to Massachusetts Sen. Edward Kennedy's
mocking refrain of ``Where was George?'' at July's Democratic
presidential convention.
   The U.S. Consulate in Kuwait declined to provide information on
the case.
   Gillette and Gilley shared an apartment in Kuwait, where they
work for the international oil well servicing company Anadrill
Schlumberger.
   They were sentenced in March to five years in prison each on
charges of selling homemade whiskey. Kuwait, a Moslem country,
forbids the sale or production of liquor.
   Gilley said he and Gillette, like many foreigners, kept homemade
wine and beer in their home. He said he believes an employee may
have sold some of his liquor while Gilley was away on a leave of
absence last fall.
   In May, an appeals court reduced their sentences to three years
and four months.
   ``You've got to develop a mental attitude or you'll go crazy,
and I chose the other way,'' said Gilley, a native of Kilgore,
Texas.
   ``My wife and I sat down and decided that if I had to spend
three years and four months in jail, so be it.''
   Gilley shared a cell with five other prisoners, slept on the
floor rather than on the concrete slab that was his bed ``because
it was cooler,'' painted prison signs, read a lot and looked
forward to at least twice-weekly visits from his wife.
   Gillette spent his time in a prison hospital.
   Mrs. Gilley said she was occasionally allowed to bring her
husband mustard and other treats.
   Simmons, managing director of Universal Oilfield Services Ltd.
of Daventry, England, said he informed Bush of the case through
Bush's longtime associate, Jim McDonough of Dallas.
   The Gillettes, of Daniel, Wyo., plan to return to the United
States on Thursday, said Simmons.
   The Gilleys said they will visit Texas in a couple of weeks.
After that, Gilley will decide what to do.
   ``I know one thing. I'm just going to take some time off and get
my head screwed back on right,'' he said.

<HEAD>No Whistling: Artist Hopes to Curb Men's `Animal Instincts'</HEAD>

   An artist who says she was ``bothered a lot''
hopes to tame the animal instincts of the urban jungle's aggressive
men by posting a few more signs along the city's streets.
   Ilona Granet's 2-foot-square metal and enamel designs _ one in
pink, the other magenta _ urge men who must leer to do so in
silence.
   One shows a shapely woman admonishing a tom cat truck driver:
``No Cat Calls _ Whistling (or) Kissing Sounds.'' The other,
illustrated with a man restraining a struggling wolf, advises in
English and Spanish: ``Curb Your Animal Instinct.''
   The eye-catching signs ``came to be because I was bothered a
lot. Every girl I know was bothered a lot,'' Ms. Granet, a believer
in art with a social message, said Tuesday.
   Later this week, in lower Manhattan near City Hall and in the
financial district, the East Village artist says she will begin
putting up ``12 little signs which are going to change mankind so
everyone will be gentlemen and ladies again.''
   Department of Transportation spokesman Victor Ross said the DOT
had granted permission for Ms. Granet to hang the signs for six
months ``as works of art at the request of a community board and an
arts group.'' But he said that if the works create confusion with
existing street signs, ``I see a clash between the artist and the
bureaucracy.''
   Ross, whose department maintains and regulates the city's
million or so street signs, views Mr. Granet's efforts as an
ineffective ``publicity stunt.''
   ``A sign telling a wolf not to whistle is like putting a red
flag in front of a bull and telling him to cease and desist from
charging. It doesn't work,'' Ross said.
   Although the artist agrees that her signs will do little to
change attitudes, she hopes they will become part of a dialogue
between men and women.
   ``It can be a real problem that men don't get. A lot of men
think it's complimentary,'' said Ms. Granet, 39.
   ``For young girls it can be traumatic,'' she said of obscene
propositions some men make to passing women. ``It's way too
personal and it's kind of frightening.
   ``As an older woman I'm not frightened by these people, but I am
offended. When you're unprepared for it, it's a horrible
intrusion.''
   Ms. Granet has so far asked five Manhattan community boards for
permission to post signs. One has agreed, one is still considering
it and the other three refused.
   She said she has invested about $3,500 _ some from an arts grant
and some of her own money _ to print 100 of her signs. She said she
plans to post 50 around the city and hopes to sell the others.
   ``There was going to be a line (of signs) for the beach this
summer, but they became poisonous and I canceled it,'' she added.
Floating medical waste and sewage have closed many of the area's
beaches this summer.

   More U.N. observers arrived in Baghdad
Tuesday to prepare for the cease-fire scheduled to begin Saturday
in the 8-year-old war between Iran and Iraq.
   Ali Akbar Velayati, Iran's foreign minister, sent a cable to
U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar saying Iraq may
attack before the truce. The head of Iranian volunteer units said
130,000 government employees had gone to the front in case of an
assault.
   Kurdish guerrillas backed by Iran said they had killed 500 Iraqi
soldiers in several days of battle in the northwestern Kurdistan
region and fighting continued.
   Baghdad's official Iraq News Agency said the 73 U.N. observers
joined several who arrived last week. About the same number of
observers are in Tehran.
   They are part of the U.N. Iran-Iraq Military Observers Group _
350 unarmed officers from 24 nations who will have headquarters in
the two capitals and monitor the cease-fire.
   In Washington, the Defense Department said the U.S. Air Force
was flying Canadian members of the observer group to the Persian
Gulf but would not land in Iran.
   Gen. Slavko Jovic of Yugoslavia, chief of the observer corps,
was due in Baghdad on Wednesday, the Iraqi agency said. Jovic will
shuttle between Baghdad and Tehran.
   Assessments are to be levied on U.N. members to pay the $74
million the observer force will cost for the six months authorized
by the Security Council. Of the total, $47 million is for start-up
expenses.
   Tehran radio quoted Velayati as telling the secretary-general:
``Iraq intends to launch a series of military operations in the
air, on land and at sea, before the cease-fire.''
   ``Iran has accepted the request of the U.N. secretary-general
and the president of the U.N. Security Council to refrain from
military operations, wheras Iraq has not only refused to respond to
this request but has resorted to aggression against Iran,''
Velayati was quoted as saying.
   Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini's regime announced last month that
it accepted the year-old Security Council Resolution 598, which
calls for a cease-fire, withdrawal to recognized borders, prisoner
exchange, peace talks and an investigation of which side started
the war.
   Each side has accused the other of violating an informal truce
that began earlier this month.
   The head of Iran's Pasdaran, or volunteer units, said troops at
the front should be bolstered against possible Iraqi attack, Tehran
radio reported.
   ``In this regard, 130,000 government employees have been
dispatched to the war fronts, where they can give deadly strokes to
the Iraqi forces,'' said the official, identified only as Mr.
Rahmani.
   He did not say when the reinforcements were sent, but it
appeared his reference was to the period since Iran accepted the
resolution on July 18.
   The Kurdish Democratic Party, a guerrilla group fighting for the
independence of Iraqi Kurdistan, said fighting began Aug. 12. Iraq
did not comment on the report.
   In a telex from their London office, the Kurds said the fighting
was in the area where the frontiers of Iran, Turkey and Iraq meet.
They said the Iraqis attacked with planes, helicopter gunships and
chemical weapons.
   ``The offensive was halted and our guerrillas counterattacked
and drove the Iraqi troops back to their starting point,'' the
statement said, and gave the Kurds' losses as 54 killed and wounded.
   Iran supports the Kurdish Democratic Party, led by Massoud
Barzani, and other Kurdish separatist groups in Iraq. Kurds have
fought for decades to establish an independent nation in their
mountainous homeland, now divided among Iran, Iraq and Turkey.

   Marvin Davidheiser and his wife, Emily,
celebrated winning a $26 million Lotto jackpot with white grape
juice Tuesday; they didn't need the champagne.
   ``If people say they get high on marijuana, then they ought to
win the lottery,'' Davidheiser, 51, a building maintenance man for
a bus company, told reporters a few hours after the winning ticket
was validated.
   The Brandon couple will receive $1.3 million a year for the next
20 years. That will leave them with about $940,000 after taxes,
according to their accountant, Clinton Humphreys.
   Davidheiser and his wife, a clerk with the Hillsborough County
tax collector, bought the ticket the day before the Aug. 6 drawing.
The ticket was one of 40 they purchased and stacked on the family
Bible. The winning chit was on the bottom of the pile.
   ``It was the last ticket I read, next to the Bible,''
Davidheiser said. ``So I'd advise everybody to say your prayers.
You don't win it just on picking the numbers.''
   Mrs. Davidheiser, 50, said she and her husband waited 10 days to
come forward in order to take care of home-security matters, talk
to their accountant and make out a will.
   ``We're going to relax, that's for sure, because we both worked
hard throughout life. We've had a lot of ups and downs,''
Davidheiser said.
   He and his wife, who have three grown children, would probably
do some traveling, he said. Both plan to quit their jobs.
   ``We'll ... generally try to enjoy life and see what the world
is all about.''
   Mrs. Davidheiser said the winning ticket was hers but that she
would split it with her husband. The couple, who moved to Florida
from Pennsylvania, have been married for 11 years.
   Although the two of them together usually buy $10 worth of Lotto
tickets a week, they decided to splurge and spend $20 each as the
jackpot climbed past $20 million for the Aug. 6 drawing.
   The prize is the 13th largest lottery prize awarded in the
United States, according to Ed George, a spokesman for the Lottery
Department. Earlier this year, a $51.4 million prize in California
was split between two winners. Last year, a single winner in
Pennsylvania won $46 million.

   Bigfoot, a legend whose large footprints and
reported sightings have inspired storytellers for years, now has a
first name: Harrison.
   The Washington Centennial Commission last week selected
``Harrison Bigfoot'' as mascot of the state's 100th anniversary
celebration. His first name comes from Benjamin Harrison, who was
president when Washington became the 42nd state in 1889.
   According to legend, Bigfoot, sometimes called Sasquatch, roams
the Northwest woods as a sub-Arctic version of the abominable
snowman.
   Ol' Harrison will be the theme for a number of Centennial
souvenir items, including stuffed animals, set to go on sale
starting this fall, said Sue Brush, a spokeswoman for the
Centennial celebration.
   The Centennial Commission plans to choose a person to wear a
Bigfoot costume at Centennial events that begin Nov. 11.
   ``We're looking for a very friendly Bigfoot, an actor who will
portray an attractive representative of our centennial,'' Ms. Brush
said.
   There are no height or shoe size requirements for the role, she
said.

   A 12-foot python that was unclaimed after it
was captured by police is city property now and will be sold to the
highest, and perhaps the bravest, bidder.
   No one has been able to determine the owner of the snake, which
was found Aug. 3 in someone's yard. It took three police officers
to pry the non-poisonous snake from a tree it had wrapped itself
around.
   Lloyd Ross, director of the Baltimore Animal Shelter, said that
because the Burmese python is city property now, he must follow
bidding procedures for the sale of the snake.
   The process will begin after a curator at the Baltimore Zoo
examines the snake to determine its sex and assess its health.
   Bids could go as high as $50 to $100, Ross said.
   The snake is resting peacefully at the shelter.

   The U.S. trade deficit widened to $12.5
billion in June as imports hit an all-time high, the government
said Tuesday. Analysts said the report showed how far the country
still has to go in solving its trade problems.
   The gap between what America exports and what the country
imports surged by 28.5 percent in June, a major setback after three
consecutive monthly improvements.
   The Reagan administration sought to play down the significance
of the one-month surge, but Democratic presidential candidate
Michael Dukakis said the figures were evidence of the
administration's failed economic policies.
   Financial markets, which went into a tailspin the last time such
a disappointing trade report was released, took Tuesday's report
more or less in stride.
   While the dollar was hit by a wave of panic selling immediately
after the report was released, it soon steadied and regained much
of its lost ground.
   The Dow Jones industrial average, which had plunged 100 points
after the last disappointing trade figure was released in April,
posted gains after the June figure was released. The average of 30
industrial stocks advanced by more than 17 points to close at
2,021.51, after falling on Monday to its lowest close in nearly
three months.
   The Reagan administration contended the June deficit was a
one-month aberration that did nothing to change the fact that the
country will enjoy a substantial narrowing of its merchandise trade
deficit in 1988, the first such improvement in eight years.
   Even with the June bulge, the deficit for the first six months
of the year was running at an annual rate of $140 billion, down
significantly from the record $170.3 billion deficit set in 1987.
   ``The rise in the trade deficit is a disappointment, but it does
not change the fact that our underlying fundamentals are
improving,'' said U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter.
   The June surge in the trade deficit followed a revised May
imbalance of $9.8 billion, the lowest monthly deficit since
December 1984. The $2.8 billion deterioration came from a 2.4
percent drop in exports and a 5.7 percent rise in imports, which
climbed to a record high of $39.4 billion.
   Even with the small dip in exports, they still totaled $26.8
billion, the third highest monthly sales figure on record. Analysts
said this reflected continued strong demand for American
manufactured goods, which have benefitted from the weaker dollar.
   In a separate report Tuesday, the Federal Reserve said that
American industry operated at 83.5 percent of capacity in July, the
highest operating rate in more than eight years.
   The 0.4 percentage point rise from the June level reflected
widespread gains in many industrial sectors, helped in large part
by the export boom, analysts said.
   However, the trade report showed that imports were flooding into
the country in record amounts even though the dollar has lost more
than 50 percent of its value against the Japanese yen and German
mark over the past three years, a development which the
administration hoped would make many foreign goods too expensive
for American pocketbooks.
   Paradoxically, analysts said one reason for the surge in imports
was the fact that the overall economy was robust in the second
quarter, with both consumer spending and business investment up
sharply. The problem, however, was that much of that spending still
went for imports.
   ``The June trade deficit tells a very disappointing story,''
said Allen Sinai, chief economist of the Boston Co. ``The trade
deficit can't really be cracked until American businesses and
consumers stop buying so many imports.''
   Dukakis, campaigning in Massachusetts, blamed the
administration's economic policies, in particular the huge budget
deficits which have increased the country's need for foreign
capital.
   ``This is a nation that eight years ago was the largest creditor
nation in the world. Today we are the largest debtor nation in the
world,'' he said. ``That's the consequence of eight years of
borrowing and spending and borrowing and spending.''
   The jump in imports in June came from big increases in purchases
of clothing and cars by consumers and a $900 million rise in
purchases of capital equipment by U.S. businesses.
   David Wyss, an economist with Data Resources Inc., said that
while American manufacturers have been spending heavily to expand
production facilities, much of the money has gone to buy foreign
equipment.
   ``In industries like paper and textiles, American companies are
putting in foreign machinery because that is where the state of the
art is,'' he said.
   America's foreign oil bill declined slightly in June to $3.6
billion, compared to $3.9 billion in May, as the average price per
barrel fell to $16.19, down 21 cents from May.
   As usual, the largest overall deficit was with Japan, an
imbalance of $4.4 billion, up from $4.1 billion in May. The deficit
with Canada climbed to $1.40 billion; with Western Europe, it rose
to $1.9 billion; with the newly industrialized countries of Taiwan,
South Korea, Hong Kong and Singapore the deficit rose to $2.7
billion in June.

   Gunmen thought to be Sikh extremists
killed a police informer and three bodyguards in a Punjab farmhouse
before dawn Tuesday, police reported.
   Four other Sikhs were shot dead elsewhere in the northern state,
where radicals are fighting for an independent Sikh nation they
would call Khalistan, the Press Trust of India reported. The
extremists often kill moderate Sikhs who do not support them.
   Police said officers killed four Sikh suspects in shootouts and
a fifth died when he took poison after being arrested.
   The informer was Surjit Singh, who provided information leading
to the capture of two militants, police superintendent Izhar Alam
said.
   At least five people armed with automatic rifles attacked the
farmhouse and killed Singh and his bodyguards after separating them
from the women and children. Alam said Surjit Singh's father,
Jagtar Singh, was wounded.
   No arrests were reported after the attack at Mudh village, 35
miles south of Amritsar in the Jalandhar district.
   The violence raises the number of victims so far this year to
1,710, at least half of them Sikhs and the other Hindus.
   Sikhs account for only 2 percent of India's predominantly Hindu
population of 800 million but make up the majority in Punjab, the
nation's richest agricultural area.

   South Africa, Cuba and Angola
have established a joint military commission to monitor the
week-old truce in the Angolan war, the government announced Tuesday.
   The South African Defense Force said the three countries, which
agreed to a cease-fire Aug. 8, met Monday and Tuesday in army tents
at Ruacana, on the border of South-West Africa, known as Namibia,
and Angola, to work out details of the monitoring group.
   It said the Joint Military Monitoring Commission will include
officers from the three countries and also from the Namibian
military.
   In Windhoek, the Namibian capital, the territorial army that is
controlled by South Africa said its forces killed 14 guerrillas
last week.
   The Aug. 8 cease-fire does not apply to hostilities in Namibia.
   South Africa has administered Namibia since the end of World War
I under a mandate from the now-defunct League of Nation. That
mandate was repudiated in 1966 by the United Nations, which called
for elections and independence for the territory between South
Africa and Angola.
   Black nationalist guerrillas of the South-West Africa Peoples'
Organization, or SWAPO, have been battling South Africa for years
for control of Namibia.
   South Africa has said it would not agree to independence for
Namibia as long as an estimated 50,000 Cuban soldiers remain in
Angola, helping the Marxist government battle guerrillas backed by
South Africa and the United States.
   The brief statement from the South African Defense Force said
the Ruacana talks were held ``in a climate of respect and
responsibility,'' but gave no details of how the monitoring
commission would operate.
   South Africa has said it is complying with the first phase of
the cease-fire plan that calls for it to withdraw an estimated
2,500 South African troops from Angola by Sept. 1.
   South Africa also has said it is willing to begin withdrawing
from Namibia by Nov. 1 if it can reach a mutual date for Namibian
independence and the withdrawal of the Cuban troops from Angola.
   South Africa, Cuba and Angola along with U.S. mediators plan a
new round of peace talks next week in an effort to establish that
timetable.
   Angola gained independence from Portugal in 1974 and Marxist
forces defeated pro-Western factions in the civil war that
followed. Cuba sent troops to Angola to help the government battle
guerrillas of UNITA _ the National Union for the Total Independence
of Angola.
   UNITA, which was left out of the peace talks, has said its
guerrillas will continue fighting until it is included in
negotiations.
   The Windhoek report on last week's fighting in Namibia gave no
details.
   It was issued by the South-West Africa Territorial Force,
commanded by South Africans, and also said 275 SWAPO guerrillas
have been killed this year. It did not mention government
casualties.
   SWAPO, which has bases in southern Angola, also was not included
in the peace talks, but has said it would observe a cease-fire
beginning Sept. 1 if South Africa does so. South Africa has not
responded.

   Parties are swinging to Dixieland and Cajun
waltzes during the Republican National Convention, a four-day
nonstop dance of unity that's keeping musicians busy around the
clock.
   There's jazz at brunch, and two-steps by night.
   And there's all-day hometown hubris: ``These four days don't
come close to Mardi Gras,'' said John Sherman, secretary of the
1,300-member Musicians Local Protective Union Local 174-496.
   ``But there does seem to be a little more publicity and the
parties are more numerous,'' Sherman concedes.
   Dixieland music welcomed Vice President George Bush to a street
party on the river front Tuesday afternoon.
   As the paddlewheeler Natchez eased to the dock along the
Mississippi River, the Re-Birth Jazz Band let loose with ``When the
Saints Go Marching In.'' Their rowdy music was punctuated by a
shrill blast from the calliope aboard the riverboat, which carried
Bush and hundreds of supporters to the rally.
   The rally's Dixieland theme was typical of live music that is
entertaining Republicans this week. An extravagant party just isn't
complete, it seems, without live tunes. And everybody, it seems,
wants to be extravagant.
   Leland B. Bennett said his 10-piece band, featuring four
vocalists, has turned down some invitations to entertain during the
convention. He accepted one from the Republican Senatorial Inner
Circle, big-money boosters of GOP Senate candidates.
   ``We'll play all kinds of selections,'' he said.
   Can delegates get burned out on Dixieland?
   ``It depends on the individual. Some will listen to only that,''
Bennett said.
   Ronnie Cole, a popular local pianist, has also been able to pick
his party stops, said spokeswoman Barbara Menteris. Cole
entertained at a delegate welcoming party in Audubon Zoo and for a
function honoring President Reagan. But he turned down twice as
many chances to play as he accepted, she said.
   ``The workload has picked up,'' Ms. Menteris said. ``I would be
surprised if there are any musicians who haven't worked.''
   But at least one performance missed most of its expected
audience. Legendary trumpeter Al Hirt started a three-night
engagement at a club Monday, but drew only 50 fans.
   Scott Roach, manager of the club, located in the new Riverwalk
development, blamed a late-running opening convention session and
heavy traffic in the Big Easy. ``I'm absolutely disappointed,''
Roach said.
   Hirt was the consummate showman. Natty in red bow tie and
matching handkerchief, he growled, ``You're a small crowd, but
you're enthusiastic, and that's where it's at.''
   California delegate Don Roth was delighted. The Santa Ana
resident first heard Hirt in New Orleans while traveling up the
Mississippi River as a serviceman during the Korean War. ``I think
they could have done a better job of advertising this. I didn't
know Al Hirt was here until I just happened to have it mentioned to
me. I love his music,'' Roth said.
   Delegate Kathryn Thompson of South Laguna, Calif., praised
Hirt's showmanship. ``He's a classic,'' she said.

   Union officials said Tuesday the government is
investigating complaints that American soldiers have held British
workers at gunpoint on U.S. Air Force bases.
   U.S. Air Force headquarters called the charges ``totally
false.'' The British Defense Ministry said it was looking into one
alleged incident.
   Three unions representing civil servants who work at the bases
said they had complained to the Defense Ministry and to the
Property Services Agency, which builds and services the facilities.
   The 90,000-member Institute of Professional Civil Servants said
incidents date back to 1980.
   Institute spokeswoman Vanessa Bridge said an engineer who had
been refused entry to Upper Heyford base northwest of London on
Thursday got in on a second try, then was chased by a soldier who
shouted ``Halt or I'll fire!'' and made to lie on the ground for an
hour at gunpoint until his identity was confirmed.
   Ms. Bridge said incidents have occurred at bases in Upper
Heyford, Lakenheath and Alconbury.
   She said such treatment was not ``an automatic way of behavior .
.. but what we want is that (American soldiers) have a clear
understanding of how they should behave and what our people should
do.''
   A Defense Ministry spokesman, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, said the ministry was investigating an ``alleged
incident'' involving a maintenance man but had no record of other
complaints.
   Master Sgt. Michael Devine of Air Force headquarters said:
``Allegations that Property Services Agency employees have been
held at gunpoint or shot at by U.S. Air Force security personnel
are totally false.
   ``There was an incident involving a PSA employee attempting to
enter a secure area of RAF Upper Heyford on June 30, 1988, and the
security policeman on duty acted according to established
procedure.''
   The Guardian newspaper reported Tuesday that a shot was fired at
civil servants working on the roof of a building.
   In other incidents, Ms. Bridge said, a gun was pointed at an
engineer's head because he drove over a white line at Lakenheath
and several workers were held at gunpoint for more than an hour
during a maintenance check at Alconbury.
   Devine said the U.S. Air Force could find no record of those
incidents.
   The Property Services Agency refused comment.

   A death squad opposed to the Shining Path
guerrillas has threatened to kill a district attorney if he
investigates charges that soldiers massacred dozens of peasants,
his office said Tuesday.
   Police said members of Shining Path, a Maoist group, killed two
policemen and wounded three in jungle raids.
   The Rodrigo Franco Command, which has vowed to kill a Shining
Path member or sympathizer for every person slain by guerrillas,
issued the threat against District Attorney Carlos Escobar on
Monday, according to his office in Andean city of Ayacucho.
   Escobar is investigating charges that troops rounded up dozens
of peasants, accused them of being Shining Path members and killed
them. The alleged massacre occurred in May near Cayara, a farming
village 40 miles south of Ayacucho.
   Officials said the rebel raids occurred Sunday, at a police post
and telephone relay station near the jungle city of Pucallpa, 325
miles northeast of Lima.
   Shining Path guerrillas began fighting eight years ago. The
government says more than 15,000 people have been killed and puts
the property damage at $10 billion.
   The Rodrigo Franco group is named for an official of the
government party killed the Shining Path killed last year.
   It became known in July when it claimed responsibility for
killing the lawyer for Osman Morote. He is suspected of being the
Shining Path second-in-command and is in jail on terrorism charges.

<TEXT>
   Hypnosis once was a business of
quacks and charlatans, but now finds growing acceptance as a useful
treatment and attracted hundreds of doctors to a conference this
week.
   About 600 physicians, psychotherapists and dentists discussed
and demonstrated modern applications of hypnosis during the
International Congress of Hypnosis and Psychosomatic Medicine,
which ended Tuesday. It is the 11th conference since the first in
Paris in 1889.
   ``The process (of acceptance) is still going on,'' Dr. Richard
Van Dyck told The Associated Press. He is a professor of psychiatry
at Amsterdam's Free University and was chairman of the conference's
Scientific Committee.
   Van Dyck said few nations restrict the practice of hypnosis to
formally qualified therapists, with the result that unscrupulous
practitioners can induce subjects to ``weird and fantastic
behavior.''
   Hypnosis first became popular in the late 18th century because
of the work of Franz Mesmer, an Austrian physician who theorized
about what he called ``animal magnetism.''
   Only in the 1950s did it become a topic for serious
psychological study, when the American researcher Ernest Hilgard
designed a scale to measure a person's susceptibility to hypnosis.
   ``People who are easily hypnotizable ... have generally been
more interested in the world of fantasy ever since their youth. ..
. They're often very creative,'' Van Dyck said.
   In the 1970s, U.S. and Israeli psychiatrists found hypnosis was
valuable in helping war veterans overcome their traumatic
experiences, he said, and today treatment of post-traumatic
distress is one of its most important psychiatric applications.
   General practitioners use it to combat disorders ranging from
tension headache to psoriasis, and dentists increasingly rely on
hypnosis to help patients overcome fear of dental work. Some even
use it instead of anesthesia.
   Reseachers are exploring whether hypnosis can help the
disease-fighting immune system and help combat acquired immune
deficiency syndrome.
   During hypnosis, a patient becomes susceptible to suggestions
that would otherwise seem strange, although the patient generally
retains some control over the process and can end the hypnosis if
it is threatening.
   A hypnotic state can be induced by any of a dozen methods, Van
Dyke said, and most patients eventually can enter hypnosis alone.
   In a commonly used approach, a patient is asked to choose a
point on the wall and stare at it, locking out other mental
activity. In another, a subject is told to imagine his hand is
getting lighter and eventually levitating.
   ``It's not without some danger,'' Van Dyke said. ``There are
people who really have a hard time resisting'' suggestions under
hypnosis.

   King Hussein returned home Tuesday after a
24-hour visit to Baghdad, where Jordan ratified an agreement under
which Iraq donated 150 tanks and other military hardware to this
country earlier this month.
   The official Jordan News Agency said Iraq donated 90
British-made Chieftain tanks, 60 American-made M-47 tanks, 19
British-made Scorpion reconnaissance vehicles and 35 motorized
troop carriers.
   Arab diplomatic sources, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said last week that the donation included tanks, artillery,
surface-to-surface missiles and other equipment. The news agency
made no mention of missiles or artillery.
   Hussein said at the time that the equipment consisted of weapons
seized by Iraq during its 8-year-old war with Iran.
   The Jordanian king was accompanied on the trip by Prime Minister
Zaid Rifai and other officials.
   The Jordanian agency said the agreement was signed by Jordan's
army commander in chief, Field Marshal Zeid bin Shaker, and Iraqi
Defense Minister Adnan Khairallah.
   It said Hussein expressed his ``deep appreciation to the Iraqi
leader and his brave army for the generous gift.''
   Iraqi state-run television said Hussein conferred with Iraq's
President Saddam Hussein on Tuesday before heading home. No details
were released.
   Arab diplomatic sources said the two heads of state discussed
prospects of peace in the 8-year-old Iran-Iraq war and developments
in the Israeli-occupied territories following Jordan's decision to
sever ties with the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   Iran and Iraq have agreed to a United Nations-monitored
cease-fire, which is to begin Saturday. The two countries then are
scheduled to begin talks in Geneva Aug. 25 for a lasting peace.
   Jordan has been a key ally of Iraq in its war with Iran, with
the Jordanian Red Sea port of Aqaba a major transit point for Iraqi
war materiel.
   The king was seen off at the airport by the Iraqi president.

<TEXT>
   Democratic vice presidential candidate
Lloyd Bentsen said Tuesday the Reagan administration has allowed
America to ``drift aimlessly back into dangerous dependence on
imported oil.''
   The Texas senator also said that despite Republicans' adoration
of President Reagan, the the president's coattails will be very
short when it comes to helping George Bush get elected.
   Commenting later about George Bush's selection of Indiana Sen.
Dan Quayle as his running mate on the GOP ticket, Bentsen said:
``Of course we'll debate. I'm looking forward to it.''
   ``I've looked across the aisle in the Senate at Dan Quayle, and
I'll be looking forward to comparing our accomplishments in the
Senate, and in turn what each of us could do for our running mate _
assuming we were elected _ in pushing through and influencing the
passage of a legislative program for the new president,'' he said.
   Asked if he was surprised by Quayle's selection, Bentsen said,
``No, not particularly. I really wasn't concerned as to who it
might be.''
   Bentsen, speaking in this oil town after a visit to the nearby
Big Hill Strategic Petroleum Reserve, said the nation's dependence
on foreign oil is now greater than it was in 1973 when the Arab oil
embargo caused gas lines across the country.
   ``The American people understand ... that for eight years this
administration has steadfastly refused to produce an energy policy
that will protect America's national interests,'' he told the
gathering of about 500.
   ``The Republicans tell you they have loosened OPEC's hold on the
world's petroleum markets, but the numbers tell you that today
America is importing 42 percent of the oil we consume,'' he said.
   ``Our dependence has increased by 15 percent while this
administration has been lulled to sleep by low oil prices,'' he
said.
   The petroleum reserve program was launched in the wake of the
oil shocks of the last decade. The six reserves are underground
vaults of crude oil which can be retrieved in a national emergency.
   Bentsen used the visit to the Big Hill site, the last of the six
reserves, to underscore his and Michael Dukakis's support for the
program which eventually will put 750 million barrels of oil in
storage.
   Bentsen, in shirtsleeves and a gold-colored hard hat with ``Sen.
Bentsen'' on the front, told a group of about 50 workers at the
plant that the reserve is crucial to the national security and said
he would like to expand it to a billion barrels.
   The Reagan administration has proposed cut in the program in the
past, and Bentsen said only the Democratic Congress was able to
keep it going.
   Bentsen has been campaiging in his home state while the
Republicans hold their convention in New Orleans and dominate the
national news.
   Asked about the president's speech Monday night to the
convention, Bentsen said Reagan had ``an adoring crowd, and they
enjoyed each other.''
   ``I also believe that in the convention, and after the
convention, as we go into the election, that it's George Bush
people are looking to, not Ronald Reagan,'' he said. ``And Ronald
Reagan's coattails will be very short.''
   Bentsen said there is a yawning gap between the Republican
rhetoric and reality, including Reagan's charge that the Democrats'
speciality is inflation.
   ``Inflation is in the trade deficit,'' Bentsen said, citing
Tuesday's news that the trade gap had jumped back to $12.5 billion
in June.

   Iran's foreign minister, Ali-Akbar
Velayati, said Tuesday that Iraq may launch a series of air, sea,
and land assaults on Iran before a cease-fire in their 8-year-old
war takes effect this weekend.
   A spokeswoman for Iran's mission at the United Nations confirmed
that Iranian Ambassador Mohammad Ja'afar Mahallati was delivering
that message from Velayati on Tuesday. She spoke on condition of
anonymity.
   Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar earlier Tuesday asked
the General Assembly for swift approval of $75.6 million needed to
support the 1,300 personnel who will monitor the Persian Gulf
cease-fire, beginning Saturday morning.
   Iran's official Islamic Republic News Agency, in a dispatch
monitored in Cyprus and relayed to New York, said the cable from
Velayati warned Perez de Cuellar that indications existed that the
Baghdad government intends to launch the coordinated attacks before
the truce begins.
   The news agency said Velayati in his message told the U.N. chief
that Iran has heeded U.N. calls for restraint prior to the truce,
and asked him and the Security Council to take immediate steps to
prevent Baghdad from jeopardizing the cease-fire.
   Iraqi Ambassador Ismat Kittani declined to answer questions upon
his arrival at the United Nations for a meeting with the
secretary-general. The meeting was at Kittani's request.
   Perez de Cuellar told the General Assembly Tuesday that the U.N.
peacekeeping team should be in place by the time the cease-fire
starts Saturday.
   ``It is essential that by that time U.N. military observers
should be on the ground ... to verify, confirm and supervise the
cease-fire and withdrawal'' of troops, Perez de Cuellar told the
members in asking for the necessary money for monitoring a truce.
   The financially ailing world body convened its 159-member
General Assembly Tuesday and referred the funding request to its
budget committee, which decided without a vote to approve $35.7
million for the operation's first three months.
   The United States was assessed $10.9 million of the three-month
total.
   The committee asked the secretary-general to report back by Oct.
1 on the first phase of the operation and its costs.
   A U.N. report said the assembly should assess its members $75.6
million to pay for the truce-monitoring effort for six months. The
United States was expected to be assessed about $23 million of that
amount.
   The General Assembly is to meet Wednesday to adopt the budget.
   A group of 73 U.N. observers arrived Tuesday in Baghdad, the
official Iraqi News Agency said in a dispatch monitored in Cyprus.
   A like number of observers arrived simultaneously in Tehran,
said Commandant Dermat Earley, a U.N. peacekeeping official.
   The head of the force, Gen. Slavko Jovic of Yugoslavia, left
Belgrade Tuesday for Baghdad, according to U.N. spokesman Francois
Giuliani, and is to travel to Tehran on Thursday.
   The Security Council created the U.N. Iran-Iraq Military
Observer Group one week ago after Iran and Iraq agreed to observe
the cease-fire. They are to begin direct peace talks Aug. 25 in
Geneva.
   Preparations also are under way for the first U.N. naval force
that is to patrol the disputed Shatt al-Arab waterway, where the
war broke out in September 1980.
   The United Nations is facing its worst financial crisis because
of debts by its members, especially the United States, which owes
$467 million of the $602 million in unpaid dues to the regular
budget.
   The United States, which also owes $70 million in assessments
for peacekeeping forces, has withheld its dues to try to force the
United Nations to reform its budget, cut personnel and improve
efficiency.
   U.N. officials said it faces insolvency next month if the money
is not forthcoming.
   About 350 members of the Iran-Iraq observation group will be
unarmed military observers, 615 will be military personnel and
about 350 will be civilian staff.
   On Monday, Iraq accused Iran of bombarding its troops with
artillery and mortar fire. Iraq made its accusations in a letter
from the Iraqi mission to the United Nations. It did not mention
casualties or damage.
   Iran denied a similar accusation last week. In the latest
letter, Iraq said Iranian gunners over the weekend fired on the
Iraqi southern port city of Basra and the southern Faw peninsula.

<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Intense heat once again set records Tuesday across the
mid-Mississippi Valley, the Ohio Valley, and the eastern Plains,
while storms during the morning brought hail and tornadoes to parts
of Michigan.
   The hot weather was caused by an upper air high-pressure system
anchored over the southeastern quarter of the nation. This upper
air high has prevented the movement of storm systems and cooler air
into an area from the Mississippi Valley to the East Coast, thereby
allowing the oppresive heat and humidity to continue.
   Early Tuesday afternoon, temperatures were in the 90s in much of
the eastern half of the nation. Readings between 95 and 105 were
reported in the Mississippi Valley, eastern Plains and the lower
Ohio Valley.
   Milwaukee set a record for the most days of triple-digit
temperatures in a year _ five, breaking the record of four set in
1936. The 100-degree reading by midafternoon also broke the high
for the date of 98, set in 1937.
   In Chicago, the temperature hit 100, making the 46th day of
temperatures in the 90s or higher this season.
   In parts of the mid-Atlantic region, humidity levels dropped,
but it still topped 90 in Newark, N.J., for a record setting 19th
day in a row.
   Records for the date set or tied by midafternoon Tuesday were:
91 in Beckley, W.Va.; 90 in Duluth, Minn.; 97 in Eau Claire, Wis.;
98 in Evansville, Ind., a tie; 97 in Fargo, N.D.; 103 in Fort
Dodge, Iowa; 100 in Huron, S.D.; 101 in Indianapolis; 99 in
Louisville, Ky.; 100 in Madison, Wis.; 100 at Moline, Ill.; 92 in
Muskegon, Mich.; 101 in Peoria, Ill.; 101 in Sioux Falls, S.D.; 97
in South Bend, Ind.; and 102 in Springfield, Ill.
   Strong thunderstorms produced severe weather in parts of
Michigan during the morning. They formed along a front separating
the intense heat to the south and cooler Canadian air to the north.
   Tornado touchdowns were reported near Marquette and Maple
Rapids, Mich., but no damage was reported. Thunderstorm winds blew
down trees and power lines at Mount Pleasant, at Petoskey and in
Gratiot County. The wind gusted to 63 mph at Ann Arbor and
three-quarter-inch hail fell at Middleton.
   Scattered showers and thunderstorms also were reported along the
eastern Gulf Coast region, Florida, the Carolina coast, Minnesota,
the Dakotas and the front range of the Rockies in Colorado and New
Mexico. Showers were widely scattered in Washington state and Maine.
   Heavier rainfall during the six hours ending at 2 p.m. EDT
included 1.15 inch at Kingsville, Texas; 0.89 inch at Pensacola,
Fla.; 0.85 inch at Hinesville, Ga.; 0.66 inch at Apalachicola,
Fla.; 0.51 inch at McAllen, Texas; 0.44 inch at Beaufort, S.C.; and
0.40 inch at Marquette, Mich.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 58
degrees at Bellingham, Wash., and Port Angeles, Wash., to 105
degrees at Chamberlain, S.D. The early-morning low for the nation
was 32 degrees at Truckee, Calif.
   The weather forecast for Wednesday called for showers and
thunderstorms along a cold front over the northern Mississippi
Valley, the Great Lakes, New York State, and northern New England;
scattered showers and thunderstorms in the Gulf Coast and Florida;
and late-day thunderstorms in the mountains of eastern Colorado,
southeastern Wyoming and central Arizona.
   Highs in the 60s and 70s were forecast in parts of Washington
state and the Oregon and California coasts; in the 70s in
northeastern Minnesota, upper Michigan and Maine; in the low 100s
in eastern portions of the central and southern Plains, the
mid-Mississippi Valley, the Ohio Valley and portions of the
mid-Atlantic Coast; as high as 115 in the desert Southwest and
valleys of California; and in the 80s and 90s in most of the rest
of the naiton.

<HEAD>U.S. Institute Develops Case To Help Prevent Decay Of Mummies</HEAD>

<DATELINE>CAIRO, Egypt (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Egypt has received a model of a show case
designed by the U.S. Getty Conservation Institute that will help
prevent the decay of Egypt's royal mummies, the institute's
director said Tuesday.
   Luis Monreal told a news conference that American, Canadian,
Spanish, German and Egyptian scientists had designed the
nitrogen-filled case on the basis that inert gases preserve organic
material and reduce biological growth.
   He said the case also could be used to conserve priceless
antiquities such as manuscripts and objects made of organic
materials including wood, leather and bone.
   Monreal desplayed a small prototype of the case that is
hermetically sealed.
   ``The new thing is that it is simple, will not cost much and
includes a cocktail of nitrogen and oxygen,'' he said.
   Getty scientists developed the proper mixture of 97 percent
nitrogen and 3 percent oxygen and the prototype was first shown in
California last May, according to Monreal. He said tests involved a
3,000-year-old female mummy on loan from Egypt and other Egyptian
mummies from American museums.
   The first full-size case will be delivered to Egypt in December
and Egypt then is to build similar cases locally for its 27 royal
mummies and put them on display, Monreal said.
   The royal mummies, dating from 3,000 to 3,800 years ago, were
discovered in a common tomb in 1881 near the southern city of Luxor
where ancient priests had hidden them from grave robbers.
   They have been held in a closed hall at the Egyptian Museum
after being displayed from 1958 to 1980. Although thousands of
mummies have been found and displayed, the 27 are considered to be
the only royal mummies.
   Plans to put them on display last summer were postponed until
the new show cases could be developed.
   Monreal said research in developing the case had cost the
institute about $150,000.
   ``That is a very low cost if what you are trying to save are the
most precious specimens of Egyptian history,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   Jack Kemp, who began the day as a candidate
for the GOP vice presidential nomination, said Tuesday that he
would give his ``unconditional'' support to the new team of George
Bush and Dan Quayle.
   Kemp said Bush phoned him Tuesday afternoon to say he had made a
choice for his running mate, and that it would not be Kemp. Kemp
said Bush did not tell him who the choice would be.
   Kemp said Bush told him ``it was a very close call as to who to
pick.''
   Kemp, a New York congressman, said later he would fully support
the Bush-Quayle ticket.
   ``I think George Bush and Dan Quayle are going to make a very
strong ticket for the Republican Party,'' Kemp said.
   ``I told the vice president I'm going to look forward to
campaigning for a Bush-Quayle ticket in 1988 ... I told him, `Mr.
Vice President, I want you to know my support is unconditional,'''
Kemp said.
   Selection of Quayle came even as Kemp's supporters circulated
petitions aimed at pressuring Bush to select him.
   Kemp had been pushed for the ticket by leaders of the party's
right wing. Alabama Gov. Guy Hunt said he had arranged for one
member of each state delegation to gather signatures on petitions
asking that Kemp be selected.
   ``We're not trying to take George Bush's decision away from
him,'' Hunt said. ``Only he can make that decision. We're just
tying to show him what we think of Jack Kemp.''
   Kemp had repeatedly made clear he was eager to be asked.
   ``I'll like it if it happens,'' Kemp said earlier. ``My view is
to come down to New Orleans not expecting anything. If it were to
happen, that would be fine. If it isn't, that's fine. I expect to
campaign for George Bush whether I'm on or off the ticket just as
enthusiastically.''
   Kemp told around 100 people at the Republican National
Committee's black outreach seminar Tuesday that the GOP ticket
should campaign for black votes as soon as the convention ends.
   He noted that Democratic nominee Michael Dukakis campaigned in
the traditionally Republican states of Texas and California after
his nomination, and the Republican ticket should ``hit your
adversary at their strength.''
   ``We should go to Watts,'' he said, referring to the poor, black
neighborhood in Los Angeles.

   President Reagan praised the
selection Tuesday of Dan Quayle for the Republican vice
presidential nomination, saying the Indiana senator's ``talent,
intellect, family and energy will be valuable assets'' in the fall
campaign.
   ``Vice President (George) Bush has made an outstanding selection
of Senator Quayle of his running mate,'' Reagan said in a statement
shortly after his arrival in California for a three-week vacation.
   Earlier Tuesday, before leaving New Orleans, Reagan blessed
Bush's presidential quest anew and told his vice president that ``a
great deal rides on this campaign.''
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said Bush informed the
president of his choice of Quayle during a conversation at the foot
of the airplane ladder before the president boarded.
   ``Dan was first elected to the Senate as part of the Reagan-Bush
team in 1980,'' Reagan said. ``He's a proven vote-getter.
   ``I've worked closely with Dan on a number of issues. He has
been a leader in the Senate for a strong national defense,
particularly the Strategic Defense Initiative, and proponent of
innovative job creation programs.
   Reagan added, ``His talent, intellect, family, and energy will
be valuable assets during the campaign, and I know he will be a
great vice president. I salute Vice President Bush's selection.
George has made an excellent choice.''
   At the airport ceremony in New Orleans, Reagan assured Bush that
``Nancy and I want you to know that you have all our support all
the way, and all our love.''
   Bush will receive his party's presidential nomination Wednesday
in a formal roll call of delegates at the Republican National
Convention.
   The brief greeting between Reagan and his vice president _ which
took less than five minutes _ occurred under gray skies on an
airport tarmac, with Air Force One and Air Force Two in the
background.
   Bush had just arrived in New Orleans; Reagan, who addressed the
convention Monday night, was on his way to California.
   The meeting was arranged only recently by the White House and
the Bush campaign, in part because of the questions that had been
by raised the absence of any joint meetings between Reagan and Bush
in the convention city.
   ``Well, ladies and gentlemen, the reason the vice president and
I are meeting this way is a recent decision by the fire marshal in
New Orleans,'' Reagan joked. ``He said that New Orleans is now so
crowded he's not letting in a new Republican unless one leaves.''
   It was a veiled reference to the overcrowding and closing of the
Omni during the Democratic National Convention last month.
   ``But seriously ... George,'' Reagan said, ``a great deal rides
on this campaign, and on you are America's hopes for continued
peace and prosperity.''
   Bush told Reagan that ``by the time you leave office ... you
will have done for America the greatest thing that a president
could do. You will have left this country better than you found
it.''
   ``Today, America can see further because of your vision,'' he
said. ``And now it's time to extend that vision into the next
century. ... And I do not intend to fail.''
   Fitzwater said Reagan will make at least a couple of trips a
week in Bush's behalf after the president returns from his
California vacation on Sept. 6.
   Fitzwater said Reagan ``won't get personal'' in his campaign
rhetoric. ``He won't talk about Mike Dukakis, but he'll talk about
Republicans and Democrats and liberals in a way that you won't
mistake the difference.''
   Reagan, in fact, has been talking increasingly of Dukakis,
without mentioning the Massachusetts governor's name. During his
rally speech here Sunday, Reagan alluded to the ``stealth
candidacy'' and said that he was sure Dukakis wouldn't be holding a
federal office in January.
   In California, Reagan planned to mix pleasure with business
during his vacation at his 688-acre ranch in the Santa Ynez
Mountains north of Santa Barbara.
   As has been the habit during the Reagans' summer forays on the
West Coast, the pair will travel to Los Angeles for a few days to
socialize with longtime friends.
   Before leaving New Orleans, Fitzwater said, the president signed
four bills, including one requiring imported telephones to be
compatible with hearing aids. The president wears a hearing aid.
The other bills involved an Alaska land transfer and set aside
August 9 as a neighborhood watch day and Labor Day weekend as a
safe driving observance.
   Reagan also was expected to act on several other pieces of
legislation awaiting his signature, including a bill to overhaul
the trade laws and to reinforce U.S. laws barring discrimination in
housing.
   As for Monday night's address to the convention, Fitzwater said,
``I think he felt very good about last night. At the reception
(which the Reagans held later in a meeting room at their hotel), he
stayed until around 12:30, they were almost the last to leave. You
could tell he was feeling up about the whole thing, savoring the
evening.''

<HEAD>Entertainer Among 18 Arrested In Big Cocaine Bust</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAVIER PICHARDINI</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MEXICO CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A well-known Mexican entertainer who made
body building part of her act sobbed a declaration of innocence
Tuesday when she and 17 men appeared at a news conference as
defendants involved with a drug ring.
   The Federal Attorney General's Office said Rossy Escudero and
the others, 10 of them Colombians, were arrested in a raid that
netted 1,500 pounds of cocain and involved a major ring that was
smuggling the drug into the United States.
   They were presented to journalists in Mexico City, including the
purported ring leader, a Colombian identified as William Mayor
Arias.
   A statement from the Attorney General's Office, which
coordinates anti-narcotics activity in Mexico, called the operation
the biggest victory of the year over drug dealers. It said the raid
followed a six-month investigation.
   It said the cocaine, with an estimated street value of $500
million, was confiscated last weekend in Bahia de Kino, in
northwestern Sonora state, 210 miles south of the U.S. border.
   Those arrested were provisionally booked on charges of attempts
against the health of the Mexican population, a catchall felony
punishable by up to 15 years in prison.
   Most refused to talk to reporters but Ms. Escudero, weeping,
insisted she knew nothing of the drug trafficking.
   She is a singer, dancer and physical culturist who has her own
gymnasium and promotes female body building on national television.
She has appeared in movies and in nightclubs.
   Authorities got on the ring's trail in March after a private
plane crashed at Barra de Navidad, in western Jalisco state, with a
large amount of cocaine aboard, the statement from the attorney
general's office said.
   It said four people were later arrested in the Jalisco state
capital of Gudalajara, 280 miles northwest of Mexico City, in
connection with the crash but had to be freed for lack of evidence.
   The four were rearrested last weekend and now are among those in
custody, the statement said.
   Investigators found the ring had an extensive communications
network linking Colombia to Mexico City and Sonora, with a secret
headquarters at a hotel in the Mexican capital.

<HEAD>French Comment on Republican Convention</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Comment in French newspapers Tuesday on the
Republican convention included this report by Marc Kravetz of the
leftist Liberation on the French Quarter scene in New Orleans:
   ``Even if, speaking frankly and by the criteria of old Europe,
New Orlean's libertine ... reputation seems very excessive, it's
fairly pleasing to see so many declared militants in the fight
against lax morals, the right to abortion, homosexuality,
pornography and stimulating substances, between two bottles of
Dixie, the local beer, shouting encouragements at the appearance of
a breast, the suggestion of a caress or the simulated copulation of
a guy with a mustache.''
   L'Humanite, the Communist Party daily, said of George Bush:
   ``Bush's bad media image, making him seem colorless and
maladroit, is obviously not enough to explain his lack of success.
In the eyes of Americans, he is accountable for the anti-social
policies waged for eight years by Reagan, which are not denied by
the platform to be adopted by the Republican convention.''
   The conservative Le Figaro explained the choice of a running
mate in a front-page editorial by Jacques Jacquet-Francillon:
   ``Things being what they are, logic would have a candidate
choose as running mate the man best suited to continue his work,
the one who most resembles himself, his best friend if possible.
But that, alas, would deprive him of a precious trump card
necessary for victory.
   ``A good running mate is not an alter ego. All that is demanded
of him is to be able to deliver additional votes. If the party's
champion campaigns on liberal ideas, he needs help from a
conservative. And vice versa, of course. If the No. 1 is strong in
the West, it's best to chose a man from the South, or from New
England.
   ``Is this shocking? Perhaps. But it's one of the secrets of
American political equilibrium; one of the reasons why, whatever
might come up, since its unity was forged after the Civil War, the
United States has never again found itself `cut in half.'''

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sen. Dan Quayle has made his reputation in the
Senate as one of the chamber's most ardent supporters of President
Reagan's Pentagon build-up and a master of the minutiae of arms
control and defense policy.
   In fact, the man picked Tuesday by George Bush as the Republican
vice-presidential candidate broke with moderate Republicans last
month and advised Reagan to veto a Pentagon budget bill. Reagan did
just that, citing _ as did Quayle _ the deep reductions in Star
Wars spending.
   The junior senator from Indiana also was one of the leaders in a
bitter 1986 Senate fight over Daniel Manion, a conservative Indiana
lawyer whose judicial nomination became a battleground over
Reagan's judicial philosophies.
   In addition, Quayle is on the Senate Labor Committee, where he
has spearheaded the Reagan administration's fight against raising
the minimum wage, providing advance notice of plant closings and
other labor legislation backed by unions.
   Even after Senate conservatives, the White House and major
business groups dropped their opposition to some labor-backed
measures such as a ban on the use of lie detectors to screen job
applicants, Quayle remained a vehement foe.
   Quayle, elected to the Senate in 1980, has specialized in
military issues as a member of the Armed Services Committee. He
admitted he had little knowledge about the issue before coming to
the Senate, but said he had made up for that by spending long hours
poring over the arcane details of military policy, such as troop
strength, weapons performance, and Soviet military doctrine.
   Quayle is now ranking Republican on the conventional force and
allied defense subcommittee, a panel which deals chiefly with the
16-member North Atlantic Treaty Organization.
   Last winter, Quayle was one of the leading skeptics during the
long Senate debate over the historic Intermediate-range Nuclear
Forces treaty, the U.S.-Soviet pact which eliminates medium- and
short-range atomic-tipped missiles.
   Quayle was one of the few senators on the Armed Services panel
who attended virtually the entire series of hearings, including a
number of long, detailed sessions devoted to taking testimony from
military officers and think-tank experts about the possible effect
of the INF pact on Western Europe.
   Before the hearings began, Quayle said he was skeptical about
the pact, even though it had been negotiated by a conservative
president he admired. But he eventually ended up voting for it on
March 27 when the Senate ratified the pact by a 93-5 margin.
   Many of his questions centered on the issue of whether the pact
would ban so-called ``futuristic'' weapons of the type envisioned
by Reagan's 5-year-old Strategic Defense Initiative, the formal
name of Star Wars.
   Quayle has been one of the Senate's leading champions of Star
Wars, and it was that advocacy which last month led him to suggest
that Reagan veto a defense bill providing for the Pentagon budget
for the fiscal year starting Oct. 1.
   Reagan wanted $4.8 billion next year for Star Wars, but the
compromise measure proposed by the Democratic-controlled Congress
provided $4.0 billion, a figure only slightly above the current
$3.9 billion Star Wars budget.
   On July 14, the Senate was preparing for final passage of the
bill in a vote that would send it to Reagan's desk, but Quayle
moved to return it to a House-Senate conference committee so the
Star Wars budget could be increased and Democratic-written arms
control restrictions could be dropped.
   ``This is a political struggle between the administration and
the Congress over who is going to run arms control policy, no
question about it,'' explained Quayle.
   Quayle told his Senate colleagues that Reagan might veto the
bill, but other Republicans, such as Sen. John Warner of Virginia,
ranking Republican on the Armed Services panel, said they had been
told the president would reluctantly sign the measure.
   Quayle's move lost, 58-35, but he said afterwards that Reagan
should veto the measure and he was one of the first senators to
praise the president when Reagan did reject the bill on Aug. 3.
Quayle described Reagan's veto as ``a good, sound decision.''
   Quayle was also involved in the fight over Manion, who had been
appointed by Reagan to a federal appeals court in Chicago.
Opponents said Manion was unqualified, but Republicans said he was
being criticized only because of his conservative ideology.
   Manion, a son of the founder of the John Birch Society, had
received a ``qualified'' rating from the American Bar Association,
the lowest passing grade given by the ABA's judicial screening
panel.
   Manion was eventually confirmed, 50-49, on a tie-breaking vote
cast by Bush in his vice-presidential role as presiding officer of
the Senate.

<HEAD>GOP Ratings Up 6 percent over Dems' First Night</HEAD>

   President Reagan was a stronger television
draw than the treasurer of the state of Texas but not as popular as
Jesse Jackson, according to overnight ratings compiled by the A.C.
Nielsen Co.
   The three broadcast networks combined for an average rating of
19.9 for more than 2{ hours of live coverage Monday night as Reagan
made a farewell address to the Republican National Convention. That
compared to a 17.7 rating for the first night of the Democratic
National Convention, which featured a keynote address by Texas
treasurer Ann Richards.
   The biggest audience for the Democratic convention was on the
second night when Jackson's speech pulled cumulative ratings of
23.3.
   On Monday, NBC led the pack with a 7.1 rating and 13 percent
share of the audience, followed by ABC with a 6.8 rating and 13
share and CBS with a 6.0 rating and 12 share.
   Each rating point represents 866,000 homes with television; the
share is the proportion of sets in use during the time period.
   CBS' ratings may have been hurt because it stayed on the
longest, until 11:55 p.m. EDT, when many viewers presumably had
switched off. NBC stopped at 11:40, minutes after Reagan's speech
ended, and ABC at 11:46.
   The combined share of 38 percent for the three networks was
about half their normal prime-time audience.
   On the first night of the Democratic convention, the
three-network share fell to 32 percent.

   Gov. Michael Dukakis said Tuesday he was mildly
surprised by the selection of Indiana Sen. Dan Quayle as the
Republican vice presidential candidate.
   ``He's not very well known, but I assume and expect the vice
president will make the reasons known for his picking him,'' the
Democratic presidential nominee told reporters at a briefing in a
room next to his Statehouse office.
   ``I didn't have any sense of who the vice president would pick,
and I didn't spend much time on it,'' he added.
   Dukakis, who had spent the day touring central Massachusetts,
returned to the Statehouse by helicopter late Tuesday afternoon and
learned of Quayle's selection by Vice President George Bush shortly
after the news broke in New Orleans.
   Dukakis, who chose Texas Sen. Lloyd Bentsen last month shortly
before the Democratic National Convention, declined to discuss
Quayle in detail. Instead, he emphasized Bentsen's virtues,
implicitly outlining the themes the Dukakis campaign may use
against Quayle.
   ``I'm very happy with my running mate. The more time we spend
together and campaign together, the happier I am,'' Dukakis said.
   ``Senator Bensten is a mature, thoughtful man, with real stature
_ somebody who's a real leader in the United States Senate,'' the
Democratic candidate said. ``He's already been a great asset to our
ticket.''
   Dukakis was asked if the choice of Quayle signaled an emphasis
by Bush on defense matters.
   ``Senator Bentsen has been seasoned, experienced on issues of
foreign policy, defense, space,'' Dukakis said, also citing
Bentsen's accomplishments in the Senate this year on trade,
catastrophic health care, welfare reform and plant closings.
   ``That's the kind of stature, that's the kind of strength, the
kind of maturity I think you want in a vice president _ especially
when that vice president may be president,'' Dukakis said.

   The county jail will implement stricter
guidelines on packages after a shipment of guns accidentally was
delivered to the jail commissary, a jail official said.
   United Parcel Service delivered a box of five Smith and Wesson
.38-caliber revolvers to the jail with other packages intended for
the commissary, where inmates get supplies, Anne Arundel County
Detention Center Superintendent Richard Baker said. The commissary
supervisor, a jail employee, notified officials.
   The guns had been ordered for officers at the jail.
   The box, which did not contain ammunition, was not addressed to
a particular person, Baker said. Authorities were not sure whether
it was handled by an inmate, but a search of all prisoners turned
up nothing.
   Under stricter guidelines, jail guards will search all packages,
and any weapons shipments will be addressed to a supervisor, Baker
said.
   ``We have to take more precautions,'' Baker said. ``It won't
happen again, I can tell you that.''

<TEXT>
   The remaining tons of toxic waste dumped
in eastern Nigeria have been removed and placed aboard a ship bound
for Italy, the military government announced Tuesday.
   Maj. Gen. Gado Nasko told reporters a ship hired by a West
German firm sailed out of the port of Koko Monday afternoon with
several tons of the waste. He did not identify the port in Italy
where the ship was expected to dock.
   Another ship last month took aboard the first load of the waste
and departed for the Italian port of Ravenna on the Adriatic Coast,
where there were protest demonstrations.
   The Nigerian government said the waste was from 10 European
countries and was shipped secretly to Nigeria by an Italian company.
   Nigeria seized the Italian freighter Piave to press Italy to
remove the waste and announced that 15 people, including some
Italian nationals, were arrested in connection with the dumping.
   The incident in Nigeria and attempts to arrange contracts to
dump waste in other African nations provoked widespread protests.
Several governments canceled contracts for waste dumping and
Nigeria and Guinea demanded that waste already dumped be removed.
   A spokesman for the government's ruling council said this week
that the council was considering a decree that would make the
illegal dumping of toxic wastes punishable by death.

<DATELINE>DENVER (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A day after police evicted 12 homeless women and
their children from a vacant, federally owned house, Housing and
Urban Development officials agreed Tuesday to lease 55 vacant homes
for $1 annually to shelters.
   The agreement was worked out with shelter sponsors after HUD, a
federal department, had police oust the squatters who broke into a
$73,400, HUD-owned home over the weekend and refused to leave. The
squatters were protesting the number of repossessed homes that are
left vacant while homeless people move from shelter to shelter.
   Dorothy King, organizer of the protest, was arrested for
investigation of trespassing after she refused to leave quietly,
police said.
   King, who operates a shelter called the Golden Brick Road for
battered and homeless women and children, denied the allegation,
and said, ``I was placing homeless women and children in affordable
housing.
   ``I'm so mad at him,'' she said of Grady Maples, regional
director of HUD, who requested the evictions. ``I'm crying because
I am so mad at the system.''
   She said she had tried to obtain vacant houses for use by
homeless women and their children through the official channels.
   On Tuesday, she was released from jail without bond, with a
court appearance set for Aug. 26 on a trespassing charge.
   Maples defended the evictions as unfortunate but necessary. The
precedent of allowing occupancy at will of vacant HUD buildings
``had the potential for being a very serious problem,'' he said
Monday.
   ``Let me say as kindly as I can ... the Department of Housing
and Urban Development will adopt and utilize legal and lawful
measures to prevent people from trespassing.
   ``I not only do not relish doing that, I regret that it has to
be done,'' he said.
   Maples met Tuesday with leaders of the Colorado Coalition For
the Homeless, the Northeast Denver Housing Center, the housing
committee of the Mount Gilead Baptist Church and the Southern
Christian Leadership Conference to discuss the issue.
   He said afterward that he would make 15 houses available to
Mount Gilead, 20 to the Colorado Coalition for the Homeless and
another 20 to the Northeast Denver Housing Center.
   ``They have to look at the properties'' first, he said.
   ``The HUD staff will work with them in providing addresses of
available houses and we'll go from there to see what can be done
about arranging for their leasing the number of houses they have
indicated.''
   HUD has spent more than $2 million for grants, transitional and
permanent housing to assist the homeless in the past year, Maples
also said.

<HEAD>Appeals Court Declines To Revive Legal Challenge Against INS</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES ROWLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal appeals court declined Tuessday to
revive left-wing writer Margaret Randall's legal challenge of the
Immigration and Naturalization Service's refusal to give her
permanent resident status.
   A divided three-judge panel of the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
here ruled that Randall, who has fought deportation under the
political beliefs section of the 1952 McCarran-Walter Act, must
follow administrative procedures to challenge INS actions in her
case.
   The opinion by Judge Ruth B. Ginsburg upheld last year's
decision by U.S. District Judge John Garrett Penn that dismissed
Randall's lawsuit against the INS.
   But the court noted that Congress' decision to suspend
enforcement of the provision during the current fiscal year removes
the danger that Randall will be deported.
   ``It therefore appears that the large question initially raised
_ whether Margaret Randall could regain United States citizenship _
is now reduced to the question _ when she can regain it,'' Ginsburg
wrote in an opinion joined by Judge Laurence Silberman.
   Randall, 51, an American-born writer who lives in Albuquerque,
N.M., renounced her citizenship in the 1960s after she had moved to
Mexico.
   The writer, poet and photographer, who has also lived in Cuba
and Nicaragua, returned to this country in 1984 to marry an
American and teach at the University of New Mexico. She has four
children, including two who are American citizens.
   Randall's lawyers contended that the court had the power to
overturn a 1985 INS decision refusing her permanent resident status
on the ground that her writings espoused world communism.
   Randall said this decision was unconstitutional and therefore,
her eligiblity to reapply for citizenship should be calculated from
that date.
   The panel ruled it would not reach a decision on the case until
that procedure is exhausted.
   ``Once the Board of Immigration Apeals has rendered its
decision, Randall may proceed to the appropriate circuit court _ in
her situation the Fifth or the Tenth Circuit,'' the court said.
   Circuit Judge Abner Mikva filed a dissent, saying ``Randall, I
am convinced, would have obtained the status adjustment she seeks
but for a governmental official's unconstitutional action.''

   Two gunmen burst into a bank early
Tuesday, held police at bay for 14 hours and then fled with two
hostages after authorities gave the robbers $160,000 and a getaway
car, officials said.
   Police said the gunmen rushed into the Gladbeck branch of the
Deutsche Bank at 8 a.m., grabbed two employees and barricaded
themselves inside the building.
   Police officials said the robbers had threatened to kill their
hostages and fired warning shots through windows of the building.
No injuries were reported.
   Witnesses alerted police, who surrounded the bank branch, police
said.
   During daylong negotiations, officials finally agreed to meet
the robbers' demands to hand over $160,000 and the key to the
bank's main safe.
   ``It doesn't matter whether we give them 300,000 marks
($160,000) or a million. Our foremost concern is the hostages,''
said police spokesman Klaus Fechner said.
   Police officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the
gunmen apparently took another $67,000 from the safe.
   Negotiators had continued to try to persuade the two gunmen to
surrender, but they refused and demanded a getaway car, said
Gladbeck police.
   At about 9:40 p.m. (3:40 p.m. EDT), the robbers and their
hostages drove away in a police-supplied auto, police said. Police
officials said they intended to follow the car and arrest the men.
   The hostages were identified as a male cashier and a female
assistant.
   Gladbeck is about 50 miles north of Cologne.

   Now I ask you _ should this country tolerate such cynicism?
Should this country tolerate a campaign of deliberate deception?
   Should we tolerate a campaign that pits one American against
another?
   Our party will not divide people, we will bring America together.
   We are not afraid to show our true Republican colors. Our
purpose was spoken more than 100 years ago by a man who said
America means a government whose ``leading object is to elevate the
condition of men _ to lift artificial weights from all shoulders _
to afford every person an unfettered start, and a fair chance, in
the race of life.''
   Those words were Abraham Lincoln's. And my fellow Republicans,
his creed is our creed.
   When we have followed it, we have succeeded.
   When we have deviated from it, we have failed.
   The very first act Lincoln signed as president was the Homestead
Act.
   It offered land in the west to every American.
   It didn't matter if you were a man or woman, if you were black
or white, if you were young or old _ as long as you worked the land.
   No new bureaucracy.
   No spending required.
   This Republican program limited government while offering to all
unlimited dreams.
   Today Americans have the same dreams, but the answer to those
dreams will not come through bigger government in Washington.
   You see, that's what the Democrats offer.
   It's no wonder the most popular movie in Atlanta during their
convention was ``Big'' _ they thought it was a documentary on their
philosophy.
   Liberal Democrats believe Washington should manage dreams for
all Americans.
   Republicans believe Americans should have the freedom to achieve
our dreams ourselves!
   Republicans believe that if liberty is threatened anywhere, it
is threatened everywhere.

   We will never turn our backs on the refusenik in the Soviet
Union, the black student in South Africa, or the brave freedom
fighter in Nicaragua.
   Jeane Kirkpatrick is right when she says that when it comes to
defending America _ George Bush knows best.
   All I can add is a warning. The Dukakis Democrats will try to
talk tough.
   But don't be fooled.
   They may try to talk like Dirty Harry. But they will still act
like Pee Wee Herman.
   We live in a dangerous and uncertain world. We need the ship of
state in seasoned, strong and steady hands.
   I am a student of history. I want to tell you something
Americans need to understand.
   In 200 years, there has never been a candidate for president
whose experience in world affairs and knowledge of foreign nations
has exceeded that of George Bush.
   We must stay the course at home, as well. If the Reagan-Bush
years have proved anything, it is that the heroes of the American
economy are not paper pushers along the Potomac, but dream makers
in Dayton, Denver and Dallas.
   The Dukakis Democrats don't believe that. According to The New
York Times, two thirds of the delegates in Atlanta said they wanted
higher federal taxes. The Democrats know the American people
disagree.
   So they hid those colors too. They make promises without a price
tag. Well, we added up the cost.
   They call for an end to economic violence. What it really means
is taking from those who work and simple giving to those who don't.
What does it add up to? More taxes.
   And where's Ted Kennedy? Well, he's promoting ``mandated health
insurance.'' Yet the idea seems eerily similar to a colossal
program for socialized medicine right out of the platform of George
McGovern. What does it add up to? More taxes.
   And then there is their nominee.
   Every day, he endorses another congressional spending bill ``in
concept.''
   Well, to paraphrase Sen. Everett Dirksen, a little concept here
and a little concept there, and pretty soon you are talking real
money.
   What does it add up to? More taxes.

   Look beneath the rhetoric.
   Add up all the way-out programs of the Democratic Party. What
does the name of Dukakis sound like to you? More taxes.
   At a time when costs are rising, when we are paying more for
insurance, housing, medical care and college tuitions, the liberal
Democrats want to take money out of the pockets of working men and
women because they think Washington can spend it better.
   Now, I know those Democrats like to insist they understand the
average person. But the average people I know don't want to pay
higher taxes. Low taxes create jobs better than any government
program.
   In my state, the Reagan-Bush tax cuts have created almost
three-quarter of a million new jobs _ good jobs with bright
futures. And here's one governor from a northeastern state who is
not afraid to give credit for our economic miracle to George Bush
and Ronald Reagan.
   But the Reagan-Bush recipe of low taxes and economic freedom is
not just working in New Jersey, in Florida or California. The
recipe is working far beyond our borders.
   Around the world, people are voting with their feet for
capitalism over communism. Just think for a moment. How many West
Germans climb the Berlin Wall to East Germany _ not one!
   How many Malaysians pack up to move to Vietnam? Not one!
   And I ask you _ how many Costa Ricans tomorrow morning will
stand in line for visas to Nicaragua? _ not one! They would have to
be out of their mind!
   And even communist nations are finally realizing that Karl Marx
knew about as much about economics as Groucho Marx.
   The People's Republic of China is experimenting with free
enterprise. Even the Soviet Union is changing. The year I graduated
college, Nikita Khrushchev promised that our children would live
under communism. Today, history is on our side. We dare hope that
Khrushchev's grandchildren will live under freedom!
   Look at the free world.

   At a time when almost every nation in the world is beginning to
turn our way _ let us not make the mistake in this election of

   But let us also understand that the ship of state is venturing

   The watch bell has rung. We need all hands on deck.
   Eight years ago, we gained power because Americans yearned for
freedom. Freedom from the shackles of high taxes, freedom from the
tyranny of inflation, freedom from the burdens of big government.
And we wanted freedom from the embarrassment of an America that
wore a ``kick me'' sign on its back.
   Well, we Republicans delivered. After eight years of Ronald
Reagan and George Bush, our country is stronger, safer and better
today _ and Americans are proud to admit it!
   But new challenges lie ahead. And we won't win by simply
punching the VCR and replaying the last election. And you know
what, America won't win either.
   The Democratic Party failed because they kept offering the new
deal long after it became the ``old deal.''
   We should learn from their mistakes. We don't want to repeal the
Reagan revolution _ far from it. We want to take the Reagan-Bush
principles into new areas where liberal policies have failed.
   Today America demands a new vision _ we want new freedoms.
   Freedom from racism. Freedom from poor schools. Freedom from
polluted oceans. Freedom from crack dealers.

   Britain's senior law officer is studying requests
by a member of Parliament and a private group that he file
blasphemy charges to stop the showing of ``The Last Temptation of
Christ,'' a spokesman said Tuesday.
   ``The matter is under consideration,'' said a spokesman for
Attorney General Sir Patrick Mayhew, commenting on the condition he
not be identified.
   Many Christian leaders have denounced Martin Scorsese's film.
One scene shows Jesus fantasizing about abandoning death on the
cross, marrying prostitute Mary Magdalene and making love to her.
   Mary Whitehouse, Britain's most prominent campaigner against
media permissiveness, said she wrote last week to Mayhew asking him
to consider whether the film is blasphemous and could lead to a
breach of the peace.
   Legislator Nicholas Bennett of the governing Conservative Party
also urged Mayhew to investigate to determine if the movie is
blasphemous and could lead to violence if screened in Britain.
   In 1976, Mrs. Whitehouse, president of the National Viewers and
Listeners Association, brought the only blasphemy case in Britain
in more than a half-century to court. Her successful civil action
prevented the Gay News newspaper from publishing a poem that said
Jesus was a homosexual.
   Britain's centuries-old law defines blasphemy as ``any
contemptuous reviling, scurrilous or ludicrous matter relating to
God, Jesus Christ, the Bible, or the formularies of the Church of
England.''
   ``The Last Temptation,'' which opened to packed houses last
weekend in seven U.S. cities and two in Canada, will be seen by
British censors Aug. 25.
   ``Until that time, we can't confirm the release of the film or
say anything about the film,'' said Patrick Scott, a spokesman for
the film's distributors, United International Pictures.
   Mrs. Whitehouse also wrote to James Ferman, director of the
British Board of Film Classification, saying that if the film is
classified for viewing, ``circumstances may be such as to justify
the law against blasphemy being invoked.''
   Mrs. Whitehouse, who said she had read the movie's script,
maintained that ``without any question whatever, it would give very
considerable offense'' to Christians.
   She said ``the fact that Jesus was tempted and resisted is what
gives everyone the strength to resist temptation themselves. If he
didn't resist, as is the message of the film, then how can I?''
   The U.S. Catholic Conference is urging American Catholics not to
see the film, which some leaders have denounced as blasphemous.
   Scorsese says the film is a work of fiction and was not made
with blasphemous intent.
   In Venice, Italy, the city's Roman Catholic diocese denounced
the movie Tuesday and urged that it not be shown as scheduled at
the Venice Film Festival next month. The director of the film
festival, Guglielmo Biraghi, said it would still be shown. He said
he respected the church's opinion but did not agree with it.

   And most of all, we want freedom to know that our future will be

   Many of us have been blessed with good jobs, good homes and good

   We have to care. Because their future is now our future. Their
tomorrow is our tomorrow. The simple truth is: there are no spare

   To those who are ill-schooled, ill-trained or ill-housed _ we

As Republicans, we will do it not only because economically it is

Douglass said, ``A government that can give liberty in its
Constitution ought to have the power to protect liberty in its
administration.''
   One hundred years later, bigotry and intolerance still threaten.
We have seen it in Howard Beach, N.Y.; Forsyth County, Ga., and too
many other places. Republicans will make it clear _ we will search
out bigotry and racism _ we will drag it into the sunshine of
understanding and make it whither and die.
   We Republicans offer liberty not just from prejudice, but from
poverty.
   The Democrats gave us the war on poverty _ and poverty won.
Hosea Williams said it best: ``The war on poverty failed, because
by the time it trickled down to the poor all we got was scraps from
the table.''
   We offer poor Americans not the junk food of more big
government, but the full meal of good private sector jobs.
   Our idea is simple. Cut taxes in inner cities and new businesses
and new jobs will flock to places like Oakland, Calif. and Gary,
Ind.
   The idea works.
   In my state, these tax cuts _ called urban enterprise zones _
have created over 20,000 jobs, in neighborhoods that were torn by
riots 20 years ago.

   We would create thousands more good inner city jobs tomorrow, if
the Democratic Congress would stop blocking Jack Kemp's enterprise
zones program.
   We discovered something in New Jersey _ every time we take an
unemployed person and give them a job, we take a Democrat and turn
him into a Republican!
   But good jobs will not matter if our children do not have the
skills to fill them.
   As a child, I had a terrible stutter. I also had dyslexia. I
overcame those problems, but I couldn't have done it alone. I went
to a good school. I had good teachers.
   Today, a lot of children across America struggle with problems.
With a little help from a good school or a great teacher, today's
stuttering child could be tomorrow's keynote speaker _ today's
potential dropout could become tomorrow's Thomas Edison.
   That's why Republican governors are leading a revolution in
American education. Orr in Indiana. Branstad in Iowa. Hunt in
Alabama. Martinez in Florida.
   The Democrats' response is always the same _ spend more money.
But Republican governors understand that money won't make a
difference unless we change other things as well.
   No more automatic passing of students from grade to grade. If
you can't write or read or count, you don't deserve a high school
diploma. Mediocrity can never be tolerated in teaching.
   From now on, hard work and creativity must be rewarded every
single day.
   When schools fail year after year, let's admit it is the fault
of adults, not children. Stop blaming the children. Fix the schools.
   And children cannot be educated if their minds are clouded by
drugs. Kingpins who make millions by selling drugs to children are
merchants of death.

   Gunmen thought to be Sikh extremists
killed a police informer and three bodyguards in a Punjab farmhouse
before dawn Tuesday, police reported.
   Four other Sikhs were shot dead elsewhere in the northern state,
where radicals are fighting for an independent Sikh nation they
would call Khalistan, the Press Trust of India reported. The
extremists often kill moderate Sikhs who do not support them.
   Police said officers killed four Sikh suspects in shootouts and
a fifth died when he took poison after being arrested.
   The informer was Surjit Singh, who provided information leading
to the capture of two militants, police superintendent Izhar Alam
said.
   At least five people armed with automatic rifles attacked the
farmhouse and killed Singh and his bodyguards after separating them
from the women and children. Alam said Surjit Singh's father,
Jagtar Singh, was wounded.
   No arrests were reported after the attack at Mudh village, 35
miles south of Amritsar in the Jalandhar district.
   The violence raises the number of victims so far this year to
1,710, at least half of them Sikhs and the other Hindus.
   Sikhs account for only 2 percent of India's predominantly Hindu
population of 800 million but make up the majority in Punjab, the
nation's richest agricultural area.

   I agree with George Bush. Those who dispense illegal drugs,
should be prepared to have death dispensed to them.
   My father told me about roots and wings _ roots so that a child
knows where he's coming from and wings so that he can soar on his
own. The roots are our values.
   Bill Bennett is right, our families and our schools should teach
children the difference between right and wrong _ that honesty is
the best policy _ and, at the risk of offending some people, there
is nothing wrong with young Americans reciting the Pledge of
Allegiance.
   The Bush administration will offer the wings of great schools
and good jobs. The head of that administration will also reaffirm
our roots.
   George Bush is a decent man _ and he shouldn't have to defend
his being one. If defending values such as loyalty, family, or
belief in God is no longer fashionable, then I fear for our country.
   There is another value, and it comes from the Bible. ``One
generation passeth away and another generation cometh: but the
Earth abideth forever.'' So wrote Solomon. Never has the need for
environmental protection been written more beautifully.
   Today our air is plagued by acid rain _ our oceans and beaches
are sullied by sewage and syringes _ our very future threatened by
sunburn from above and poisoned water from below.
   The party of Teddy Roosevelt must regain our environmental
heritage. In the 1990s we are going to clean America from one coast
to the other _ you know what? We are going to start way up north _
in Boston Harbor!
   Can jobs and trees go hand in hand? Yes they can, and President
Bush is going to prove it.
   What do Americans want? Not litmus tests. Not special interest
politics.
   They want something very simple _ good jobs with high wages;
clean water and air; streets free from drugs; great schools, an
America strong abroad so our children will live at peace. These
desires, like a parent's love, know no color or culture or creed.

   With these issues, and with George Bush at the helm, we will go
to the farms and the cities; to the various and the union halls; to
the suburban developments as well as the country roads.
   Let us send one message to the Democrats this evening _ we will
not concede one single vote anywhere! Let the Dukakis Democrats
offer the politics of delusion and exclusion. We Republicans will
practice the ``Politics of inclusion.''
   When I was young, I often listened to a song about America
called, ``The House I Live In.'' The song asks the question: ``What
is America to Me?''
   It speaks of old Abe Lincoln, of Jefferson and Payne _ of
Washington and Douglass and the task that still remains. It says,
``America is the right to speak my mind out and the air of feeling
free.''
   The song concludes very simply, ``The town I live in, the
street, the house, the room, the pavement of the city or a garden
all in bloom: the church, the school, the clubhouse, the million
lights I see, but especially the people, that's America to me.''
   America is this and so much more. But America has to be this and
so much more for everyone.
   You see, we are pilgrims on this ship called liberty. We carry
with us the dreams of our forefathers _ whether they came on the
Mayflower, or the slave ship, or whether their ship docked at Ellis
Island or the Port of San Francisco.
   If the free nations of the world represent the fleet of
democracy, we are the flagship. If we flounder, the future of the
free way of life will sink with us, but if we succeed, other
nations will follow in our wake.
   We have a historic mission. We must prove to the world that in
this voyage of America no one for reasons of race or background is
ever left behind _ but that everyone is on board.
   For all of us are crew on this ship of freedom _ all of us
serve, publicly or privately _ at our own stations. It is our
generation's watch on deck.
   Each of us as a parent can make our house a home _ each of us as
a worker can make our job a vocation _ each of us as a citizen can
make our community a neighborhood.
   With God's help, we will reclaim the faith of our fathers _ we
will ``practice the Politics of Inclusion.''
   With George Bush as our leader, we will redeem our American
Dream.
   Thank you very much.

<TEXT>
   AIDS demonstrators and a Dixieland band
greeted Vice President George Bush as he cruised into the Big Easy
by riverboat on Tuesday.
   Bush laughed as the Re-Birth jazz ensemble ambled across a stage
in Spanish Plaza along the Mississippi River. He didn't acknowledge
the knot of protesters who started shouting a few seconds into his
glad-to-be-here speech.
   Bush partisans tried to shout down the demonstrators, who
carried signs criticizing Bush and President Reagan for failing to
do enough to combat acquired immune deficiency syndrome. Bush's
backers held their ``Bush '88'' signs high to block the protest
messages from the vice president, who was about 30 yards away.
   Within five minutes, New Orleans police and plainclothes
security officers encircled the demonstrators, whose arms were
locked, and pushed them farther from the podium. Bush never stopped
his speech.
   Bush, his wife, Barbara, and several hundred supporters arrived
at the plaza aboard the riverboat Natchez. A banner on an ornate
upper-deck railing proclaimed, ``Steaming To Victory.''
   The Natchez was preceded by a fireboat that spewed three plumes
of water _ colored red, white and blue. Restored vintage military
aircraft, including an Avenger like the one flown by Bush in World
War II, soared within 500 feet of the cheering crowd.
   Youngsters like Sean McCree, a Boys Club member who'll be
eligible to vote in 1996, carried pro-Bush posters that were
distributed by grown-up supporters. ``I think I'll vote someday,''
McCree said, but he was stumped by a query about his party
preference. ``Huh?'' he said.
   Brocton Wilson, 13, another Boys Club member, clutched a
crumpled paper bag from a drug store. Inside were a couple of Boys
Club T-shirts, sizes large and medium, that he hoped to hand to the
vice president. But he had trouble penetrating the throng that
lined a police barricade from the stage to Bush's waiting motorcade.
   Lorean LaBranch wore a styrofoam boater with a red, white and
blue band. ``They threw it to me just before the rally _ like Mardi
Gras,'' she said while keeping track of a half-dozen kids.
   The riverboat's calliope wailed ``Dixie,'' as dark clouds
swirled overhead. But rain didn't come during the rally.

   They will report a ``Second American Emancipation'' _ working
men and women freed from the oppression of Jimmy Carter's inflation.
   They will report the incredible fact that the leader of the
Soviet Union went on television and admitted that communism has
failed.
   They will report that for the very first time in the nuclear
age, instead of designing new weapons of destruction, we are
destroying old ones.
   But my friends this election is not about the past, but the
future.
   A great deal about the Dukakis campaign can be summed up by one
incident.
   You see this flag of red, white and blue?
   It symbolizes the land of the free and the home of the brave.
   Well, their media consultants in Atlanta said they didn't think
the colors looked good on television.
   So they changed red to pink, blue to azure, and the white to egg
shell.
   Well, I don't know about you, but I believe Americans, Democrat
and Republican alike, have no use for pastel patriotism.
   But the liberal Democrats are trying to hide more than the
colors in our flag _ they are trying to hide their true colors.
   They want higher taxes.
   But they won't say so.
   They want to weaken America.
   But they won't admit it.
   And they want to play the politics of special interests.
   Last week, in a rare moment of candor, a prominent Dukakis
Democrat explained their strategy to a reporter from Congressional
Quarterly magazine.
   What he said shocked me, and I have to share it with you. He
said Democrats' advice to special interests was, and I quote, ``
... Just Shut Up. Gays, women, environmentalists. Just shut up, and
you will get everything you want after the election. In the
meantime, just shut up so we can win.''

   East German soldiers roughed up a
West German man at the border between the two countries and then
led him away, West German police said Tuesday.
   Quoting witness reports, West German border police based at
Hanover said the man rode his bicycle up to an East German border
crossing Monday afternoon.
   The man, who was in his 50s, talked with East German border
guards at the control point, then walked through a security gate
onto East German territory, police quoted the witnesses as saying.
   The East German soldiers then threw the man to the ground,
searched him, and took him away in an automobile, according to
witness reports.
   West German border police said the incident occurred near
Brochthausen, 150 miles northeast of Frankfurt.
   West German border police said they did not know the name of the
man, who they identified as West German, or why he crossed into
communist East Germany.
   East Germany's official news agency, ADN, reported Tuesday that
East German security officials arrested a West German man on
``suspicion of military espionage.''
   The ADN news agency identified the man only as ``Adolf W.''
   It said he was suspected of performing ``military espionage for
an imperialistic secret service.'' It did not elaborate.
   The man was arrested and an investigation begun, ADN said. The
brief report did not say when or where he was arrested and provided
no further details.

   Michael Dukakis on Tuesday returned
President Reagan's ``facts are stubborn things'' line in a
counterattack which blamed the administration for rising interest
rates, budget and trade deficits and several foreign policy
debacles.
   ``Iran-Contra. Noriega. Beirut. Facts are stubborn things,''
Dukakis told reporters a day after Reagan used the same refrain to
list his accomplishments in an address at the Republican National
Convention in New Orleans.
   ``This is a nation that eight years ago was the largest creditor
nation in the world,'' Dukakis said shortly after the
administration released figures showing a sharp increase in the
U.S. trade deficit.
   ``Today we are the largest debtor nation in the world,'' Dukakis
said. ``That's the consequence of eight years of borrowing and
spending and borrowing and spending. Facts are stubborn things and
these are the facts we are going to be debating ... It will be Mr.
(George) Bush who will have to respond to those facts.''
   Later, Dukakis responded to the selection of Indiana Sen. Dan
Quayle as Bush's running mate, saying the conservative senator was
not well known and that his own choice _ Texas Sen. Lloyd Bentsen _
was far more experienced than Quayle.
   ``Senator Bensten is a mature, thoughtful man, with real stature
_ somebody who's a real leader in the United States Senate,''
Dukakis said. ``Senator Bentsen has been seasoned, experienced on
issues of foreign policy, defense, space. That's the kind of
stature, that's the kind of strength, the kind of maturity I think
you want in a vice president _ especially when that vice president
may be president.''
   Dukakis campaign aides immediately attacked Quayle's record,
criticizing him for supporting a freeze on Social Security benefits
and his opposition to plant closing, drought assistance and civil
rights legislation.
   ``He does not understand the economic problems facing the
American family,'' Dukakis spokesman Mark Gearan said of Quayle.
``We learned today that the vice president can't keep a secret and
that instead of showing himself as a man in his own right he
placated the extreme right wing of his party.''
   The Massachusetts governor, wrapping up an annual visit to
central Massachusetts, said he expected the vice president to cut
into his lead in the polls because of the usual convention bounce.
But he said he did not expect the boost to last or that Reagan's
personal popularity would help the vice president.
   ``Things will settle down,'' Dukakis said. ``This is an election
between Michael Dukakis and George Bush. ``The question (voters)
are going to be asking themselves is which one of us has the
ability to lead.''
   Reagan, in his speech to the GOP convention Monday night, said
Bush should be elected because the nation could not afford to have
a president who would need ``on-the-job-training.''
   Dukakis laughed when asked about that remark and then said:
``The same might have been said of the Republican nominee in
1980,'' said Dukakis, referring to Reagan, the former California
governor.
   ``None of us comes to the presidency with on-the-job training,
least of all vice presidents,'' Dukakis said.
   Senior Dukakis adviser Kirk O'Donnell told reporters that the
Dukakis campaign did not believe Reagan's speech hurt Dukakis or
was any great help to Bush.
   He also said the campaign did not believe criticizing the Carter
administratrion, as Reagan did Monday night, would be effective for
the Republicans, a position Dukakis echoed at his news conference
just after O'Donnell's briefing.
   ``This election isn't about the past,'' Dukakis said. ``It's
about the future, it's about our economic future.''
   Dukakis also said he was not bothered by the harsh criticism of
him at the Republican convention.
   ``If you went through what I went through in the mid-70s, it's a
day at the beach,'' said Dukakis, who was voted out of office in
1978 after raising taxes and slashing welfare benefits in his first
term. He returned to office in 1983.
   Dukakis was heading out Wednesday on a four-day campaign trip
that includes stops in Minnesota, Florida, Alabama, Illinois,
Missouri, Arkansas and Texas.
   He said he spoke to former rival Jesse Jackson on Wednesday
morning and had spoken to him several times in recent weeks. No
joint campaign appearances have been scheduled as yet, but will be
soon, Dukakis said.
   ``It's going to be a close relationship,'' Dukakis said.
   The governor's schedule for the day included a meeting with
regional editors and publishers, the swearing in of a judge, a
meeting with an anti-crime council and the distribution of more
than $300,000 in grants for drug education programs. He also toured
an apple orchard in the central Massachusetts town of Northboro,
where he had a luncheon with area farmers and environmentalists.
   During the meeting with the local news organizations, Dukakis
called Reagan's veto of the defense authorization bill ``a strictly
political veto'' that would undermine national security.
   ``What kind of a contribution to national defense and national
security is that?'' Dukakis asked. ``Now we've got mass confusion
in addition to all the scandal. That's not the way you build a
strong America.''

<HEAD>Simpson's Outspokenness May Have Figured in VP Consideration</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DONNA CASSATA</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Sen. Alan Simpson of Wyoming is rarely at a
loss for words, and neither are his allies and opponents when it
comes to describing the Republican minority whip.
   Outspoken. Straight-shooting. Gutsy. Self-deprecating. Fiery.
Down-to-earth. Witty.
   This biting style has won Simpson both praise and criticism, but
it also raised nagging questions at the Republican National
Convention, where he was frequently mentioned as a possible running
mate for George Bush.
   Bush may have looked long and hard at Simpson, but on Tuesday
afternoon he settled on fellow Sen. Dan Quayle of Indiana.
   Was the man who once scolded reporters for trying to catch
President Reagan off balance and ``stick it in his gazoo'' too
outspoken to be vice president? Would he have been a liability on
the campaign trail?
   ``It is if I get smart-alecky,'' Simpson said Monday, noting the
thin line between good humor and sharpness.
   But as he reflected on the record and public statements of
Democratic nominee Michael Dukakis, Simpson smiled and said, ``I
can just see how you can have a lot of fun with this chap.''
   Simpson played down his prospects of landing on the Republican
ticket, and this past weekend said he had asked Bush to remove him
from his list of possible running mates. ``I would be a
liability,'' he said, because of his support of politically
unpopular positions.
   Simpson, while generally regarded as a conservative, supports a
woman's right to abortion, limiting Social Security benefits and is
open to a tax increase to deal with the federal budget deficit.
   ``I've had a very checkered career. I've punched the lights out
of a lot of sacred cows,'' Simpson said in an interview with NBC
News.
   Sen. Gordon Humphrey of New Hampshire, who had urged Bush to
select a staunch conservative, agreed with Simpson's assessment.
   ``He's a man of great self-control, strong feelings, a hell of a
sense of humor,'' Humphrey said. ``His one problem is
right-to-life. That would create an opening for the Democrats.''
   For some, though, Simpson would have been the ideal vice
presidential candidate.
   ``He's outspoken in a very acceptable way,'' said Sen. Orrin
Hatch of Utah, who along with Simpson serves on the Judiciary
Committee. ``He's humorous, gutsy.''
   Hatch said the 6-foot-7 Simpson has an ``Ichabod Crane'' appeal,
referring to the tall, gangly character in Washington Irving's
``Legend of Sleepy Hollow.''
   His sense of humor is always close to the surface.
   Consider Simpson's speech to the convention Monday night.
   ``There was the good news and bad news from Atlanta,'' Simpson
said. ``The good news was that Dukakis laid all those cards on the
table. The bad news is they were all face down.''
   Next, Simpson introduced to a national audience the slogan he
had unveiled earlier in the day in the form of black-and-white
campaign buttons found on the lapels of the Wyoming delegation.
   ``The Democrats asked the wrong question. The question was not
`where's George?' The question is, `who's Mike?'''

<HEAD>Radioactive Water Leaks to Open-Air Cooling Canal</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Fifteen workers at the Turkey Point nuclear plant
had to be decontaminated Tuesday after about 3,200 gallons of
mildly radioactive water leaked from a spent-fuel pool, utility
officials said.
   No injuries were reported and radiation levels were safe,
officials said.
   The employees who helped clean up the spill in the open canal
were decontaminated by washing off their shoes and clothes, said
Stacey Shaw, spokeswoman for the plant's owner, Florida Power &
Light Co.
   A radiation inspector from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission was
en route to the plant, which the federal agency has listed as one
of the nation's 10 worst.
   ``There's no health threat at all to anyone inside or outside
the plant,'' NRC spokesman Ken Clark said. ``This water could have
been released to the cooling canal under controlled conditions
anyway without violating regulations.''
   Plant workers and NRC inspectors were monitoring radiation
levels in the canal, and initial readings were only 5 percent of
allowable maximum levels, Clark said.
   Joette Lorion, founder of the private Center for Nuclear
Responsibility and a longtime foe of the plant, called the event
alarming.
   ``Any incident that happens in a spent fuel pool should be taken
seriously,'' she said.
   The long canal system inside the plant boundaries allows heat to
dissipate from non-radioactive cooling water warmed by the reactor
core, a function performed by cooling towers at many other nuclear
plants. The canal is just off Biscayne Bay but is not directly
connected to it.
   The leak began in a 30-foot deep pool where spent fuel rods are
kept in a building adjacent to Unit 4. A 1-inch valve broke on a
pump that keeps the pool water circulating slowly, allowing water
to pour out at 100 gallons a minute, Ms. Shaw said.
   ``Most of the fuel has been there at least a couple of years, so
the water is not highly radioactive,'' Clark noted.
   By just after midnight the pool level had dropped about 2
inches, setting off an alarm at the plant's control center. When
plant workers rushed to the site, they found the building's floor
flooded and water pouring out the door.
   The water flowed across a paved area into a storm drain that
leads directly to the canal system. Resident NRC inspectors were at
the site by 3 a.m., Clark said.
   Unit 4 has been shut down for unrelated reasons and was to start
up again Tuesday.
   The plant 30 miles south of Miami was again this year identified
by the NRC as one of the nation's worst. FPL has been fined
repeatedly for violations ranging from corroded bolts holding the
reactor together to guards found asleep at their posts and
unauthorized people allowed into the control room.
   Last year the NRC ordered wholesale changes at Turkey Point, and
the utility submitted an independent management consultant's
report. The NRC sent the report back for changes, and
coincidentally, FPL announced Tuesday it has resubmitted a 134-page
plan to the agency.
   The document calls for hiring more experienced personnel,
reducing overtime, shortening maintenance backlogs, and better
organizing maintenance schedules.

<HEAD>Commission Will Probe Soldiers' Shooting of Youths</HEAD>

   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ A provincial mayor confirmed
Tuesday that four youths were killed by army gunfire last weekend
and said he was one of those named by the central government to a
committee to investigate.
   Radio Haiti-Inter said Tuesday that four youths were killed and
two wounded when soldiers fired without warning on a meeting in the
remote town of Labadie.
   Mayor Andre Paul Chrysostome of Petite Riviere de l'Artibonite,
the capital of the province involved, denied the report of the two
wounded.
   He was the first government official to comment on the
shootings. The national government has issued no official
statement. Repeated inquiries by The Associated Press in person and
by telephone proved fruitless.
   First word of the incident was broadcast Monday by Radio Soleil,
the Roman Catholic station, which reported 10 dead and an
undetermined number of wounded.
   The Rev. Hugo Trieste, director of Radio Soleil, later told the
AP the lower casualty figures given by Haiti-Inter probably were
correct.
   Trieste said his station got its information from five youths
who were at the meeting when the soldiers fired, but that the five
were still in a state of shock, which would account for the
inflated number of victims they reported.
   The investigating commission began work Monday, headed by
Lafortune Sintilus, commander of the army barracks in the zone,
Haiti-Inter reported. It said other members include Chrysostome;
three policemen; a justice of the peace; a magistrate and local
Police Chief Esperance Charles.
   Haiti-Inter said three masked men, one dressed in an olive green
uniform and the other two in civilian clothes, fired without
warning at a meeting attended by about 350 people.
   Radio Metropole said the meeting was celebrating the second
anniversary of the founding of the Youth Club of Labadie. It said
this was a grassroots group affiliated with a provincial
organization which in turn was linked to the Confederation of
Democratic Unity, an organization opposed to the military
government of Lt. Gen. Henri Namphy.
   Labadie lies 80 miles north of the capital city of
Port-au-Prince and near Petite Riviere de L'Artibonite, scene of
violent political conflicts before the aborted presidential
elections last Nov. 19.

<HEAD>U.N. Committee Votes To Keep Puerto Rico On Decolonization Agenda</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER JAMES SPIELMANN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>UNITED NATIONS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.N. Special Committee on
Decolonization approved on Tuesday a Cuban-sponsored resolution
keeping the issue of U.S.-Puerto Rican political relations on the
committee agenda.
   The resolution, adopted by a vote of 9-2, expressed concern
about allegations that the United States for decades has persecuted
tens of thousands of Puerto Ricans who seek independence for the
Caribbean island that is now a U.S. commonwealth. Puerto Ricans are
U.S. citizens.
   During two days of testimony, more than three dozen Puerto Rican
speakers addressed the committee. They reflected the political
divisions among those who want U.S. statehood, those who would
continue the commonwealth status and those who demand independence.
   The United States did not participate in the debate or voting.
It walked out of the committee in 1971 and has not returned. It has
said the committee is interfering in America's internal affairs.
   Voting for the resolution were Cuba, the Soviet Union,
Czechoslovakia, Iran, the Congo, Tanzania, Syria, Bulgaria and
Afghanistan.
   Chile and Norway voted against the measure. Venezuela,
Yugoslavia and India abstained. China and Ethiopia were not present
for the vote.
   The United States seized Puerto Rico in 1898 during the
Spanish-American War.
   In 1952, Puerto Rican voters overwhelmingly passed a referendum
favoring commonwealth status and the following year the U.N.
General Assembly removed Puerto Rico from its list of territories
considered to be colonies.
   Since 1973 the decolonization committee has adopted numerous
resolutions calling Puerto Rico a colony and demanding
self-determination for its people. The United States rejected all
the declarations, saying the committee is anti-American.
   In a 1984 election, 95 percent of the island's voters rejected
pro-independence parties but were divided over the
statehood-commonwealth issue.

   Republicans who have been patting themselves
on the back for picking the Superdome for their national convention
have gotten a few kicks in the rump from people who have been
cupping their ears to hear.
   Technicians were adjusting the sound system Tuesday after former
Sen. Barry Goldwater, the GOP's 1964 presidential nominee,
complained that he thought the sound was terrible.
   At one point Tuesday morning, the sound system went on the blink
while Rep. Helen Bentley, R-Md., was giving a speech. The acoustics
on the podium itself must not be very good, because Mrs. Bentley
kept talking even after the sound went out.
   She stopped when someone tapped her on the shoulder and told her
the microphone was dead. After a few minutes and a couple of
piercing squeals of electronic feedback, the sound was restored.
   Superdome General Manager Bob Johnson was quick to point out
that the sound system is the one the Republicans had installed for
the occasion.
   ``It is not the Superdome system,'' he said.
   On Monday night Goldwater was seated in the box reserved for
Vice President George Bush to listen to President Reagan's farewell
speech.
   ``Where I sat I didn't hear a word,'' Goldwater said Tuesday on
NBC-TV's ``Today'' show.
   The vice president's box, as well as the one where Reagan sat
Monday night, are half a football field away from the podium, and
the problems with the sound system were compounded by the presence
of 36,000 people, many of whom were talking to each other.
   Conditions are no better on the convention floor, where the
pretty red carpets are laid atop a temporary plywood floor. Even
delegates seated close to the podium have to strain to hear above
the constant rumble made by thousands of shuffling feet.
   ``I said I was serving my time this morning,'' said Phyllis
Gault, an alternate from Norman, Okla., who was seated in the
delegate section.
   Oklahoma delegates, who have relatively good seats, are all but
forcing the alternates, who sit in the back of the hall, to trade
places with them. The seats at the back of the hall are not near
the plywood flooring, and the sound is better.
   Barbara Pardue, a convention spokeswoman, said adjustments were
being made to the sound system and more speakers were being put on
the floor Tuesday.
   She said the adjustments were necessary because the building's
acoustical characteristics vary with the number of people in the
hall and where they sit.

<HEAD>Chappell Supports Accountant's Appearance Before Grand Jury</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rep. Bill Chappell, D-Fla., said Tuesday he
approved of his former accountant testifying before a federal grand
jury in Alexandria, Va., which is investigating defense department
procurement practices.
   The accountant, Ray Crippen, testified Tuesday before the
federal panel concerning the Wind Meadows Racquet Club in Ocala,
Fla., that Chappell once owned.
   According to published reports, two men tied to the defense
industry intervened in a foreclosure lawsuit against Chappell
involving the racquet club. They were Leonard Kilgore, a defense
consultant and former Chappell aide, and George L. Dalferes, vice
president of governmental affairs for Martin Marietta, heading up
the company's lobbying arm.
   Martin Marietta disclosed in July that it has acquired the Ocala
racquet club from the investors, who had earlier purchased it to
help Chappell.
   In a statement released by Chappell's office, the veteran
congressman, who is chairman of a House subcommittee that oversees
billions of dollars in defense spending, said:
   ``Recently, there have been reports concerning financial records
and transactions surrounding the Wind Meadows Racquet Club. As I
have indicated in the past, I want to answer all questions
concerning the Wind Meadows Club and any other issue that has been
raised.
   ``That is why I wanted my accountant, Ray Crippen, to provide
information to federal investigators,'' Chappell said.
   The congressman, who is seeking re-election to an 11th term in
Congress, said because of Florida's accountant-client privilege
laws, the only way Crippen could answer questions about the club
was before a federal grand jury.
   In a July release, Martin Marietta officials said they knew of
Chappell's involvment when the company purchased the club. Martin
Marietta has a plant in Silver Springs Shores and corporate offices
in Ocala.
   Martin Marietta has said the club was a good investment because
the property has a market value in excess of the purchase price.
The company said it paid $200,000 for the club, and it is listed on
Marion County tax rolls for $214,967.
   Chappell has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing in connection with
the racquet club or in his relationship with Armtec.
   ``The congressman's status in this investigation has not
changed. In fact, we are confident that as we provide more
information, it will become even more apparent that all of the
congressman's transactions have been and are proper,'' his office
said.

<HEAD>157 Abortion Protesters Jailed In Largest Arrest Since Convention</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Abortion opponents sang ``God Bless America'' and
nearly overwhelmed police at a clinic Tuesday in a demonstration
that ended when 157 activists were jailed in the largest mass
arrest since weeks of protests began.
   A total of 593 protesters have been arrested since the
demonstrations began four weeks ago during the Democratic National
Convention. As of Monday, 178 remained in jail because they refused
to identify themselves.
   Demonstrators sang and prayed as they blocked entrances to the
Atlanta SurgiCenter, a frequent target of protests staged by the
New York-based Operation Rescue. The clinic performs abortions and
other surgery.
   Atlanta police spokesman Cal Jackson said the arrested people
would be charged with criminal trespass and with giving false
names. Traffic was snarled in the area around the clinic after
protesters blocked Spring Street, a major artery.
   The abortion opponents, led by Operation Rescue leader Randall
Terry, found 20 officers waiting for them when they arrived at the
center. Police also observed the protesters' activities from
helicopters.
   About 70 police and corrections officers formed a barrier and
quickly arrested three or four protesters involved in a shoving
incident that strained the makeshift police line. The shoving began
as officers shifted positions to keep demonstrators away from the
clinic.
   ``There is no possibility that we will stop the rescues unless
Mayor (Andrew) Young would like to make an executive decree closing
down the abortion mills in Atlanta,'' Terry said.
   Fifty-eight of those arrested during earlier protests identified
themselves during hearings at the city jail Monday and posted $500
bond each. Twenty other protesters continued to identify themselves
only as Jane Doe or Baby John Doe.

<HEAD>Bush Breaks the Suspense, Taps Quayle as Running Mate</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DONALD M. ROTHBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Political Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW ORLEANS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Republican presidential nominee-to-be George
Bush broke the suspense that had gripped this convention city and
picked on Tuesday youthful Sen. Dan Quayle of Indiana as his
running mate.
   ``Let's go get 'em,'' shouted an exuberant Quayle, as Bush
designated him as his choice at a rally on the shore of the
Mississippi River.
   Left in the lurch were a dozen or so leading Republicans,
several of them better known that Quayle, who got the bad news in a
series of brief telephone calls from Bush.
   One by one, in the hours after Bush landed at Belle Chasse Naval
Air Station outside New Orleans, word leaked out that one or
another vice presidential prospect had been eliminated.
   Thus the convention pastime, Name That Running Mate, became a
process of elimination. It was only a short time earlier that Bush
made it known he had made his decision, but intended to keep it a
secret.
   The secret became harder and harder to keep as prospects were
eliminated.
   Ron Kaufman, Bush's New England coordinator, said the decision
to make the announcement Tuesday rather than wait until Thursday as
originally planned was because ``there seemed to us to be a little
bit of flatness in the convention, and this puts a lot of pizazz
into today's program.''
   Others who had been on the list were quick to praise the choice
that ended their dreams of sharing the national ticket.
   ``I told the vice president I'm going to look forward to
campaigning for a Bush-Quayle ticket in 1988,'' said Rep. Jack Kemp
of New York, who had openly coveted the nod. ``I told him, `Mr.
Vice President, I want you to know my support is unconditional.'''
   Sen. Alan Simpson, R-Wyo., also considered for the post, called
Quayle ``a young, good choice.''
   ``I knew Danny was on the list and I think it's an excellent
choice,'' he said. ``My first choice was Bob Dole. ... Danny Quayle
will be a very attractive choice.''
   Among the first to receive the phone calls from Bush were Kemp,
Senate GOP leader Bob Dole of Kansas and his wife, former
Transportation Secretary Elizabeth Dole, Sen. Pete Domenici of New
Mexico and Gov. Carroll Campbell of South Carolina.
   Campbell quoted Bush as telling him, ``We don't need to go South
for a running mate.''
   Campbell's information ruled out two Tennesseans _ former Gov.
Lamar Alexander and Howard H. Baker, a former senator and White
House chief of staff.
   As names dropped by the wayside, Sen. Gordon Humphrey of New
Hampshire added a new one _ Sen. John McCain of Arizona, a former
Vietnam prisoner of war.
   Campbell apparently knew but he wasn't saying anything other
than to tell his South Carolina delegation: ``I think you'll be
very pleased.''
   The South is considered Bush's strongest region in the fall
campaign against Michael Dukakis and Lloyd Bentsen, although the
selection of the Texas senator for the Democratic vice presidential
nomination was a direct challenge to Bush in the state he calls
home.
   As he flew to New Orleans on Air Force Two, Bush told reporters
he had made his decision but intended to keep it a secret a while
longer.
   He said the final phase in the process came ``just before I
climbed onto this plane. Today, with finality.''
   ``I want an opportunity to properly notify the person I will
nominate,'' Bush said, explaining why he was delaying further his
announcement.
   Word of the selection of Quayle got out as the vice president
arrived by riverboat in the convention city.
   ``It is George Bush's America that we will work for,'' said
Quayle, as he and Bush stood together at the podium.
   The choice of the 41-year-old Quayle, a Robert Redford
look-alike, was likely to bolster the GOP ticket in the Midwest, a
region where Bush fared poorly in the primaries.
   Quayle, who defeated Democratic Sen. Birch Bayh in the 1980
Reagan landslide, has a strongly conservative voting record,
certain to please the delegates at this GOP convention.
   In the Senate, Quayle is a member of the Armed Services, Budget
and Labor and Human Services committees.
   Two of Bushes top advisers _ pollster Robert Teeter and media
expert Roger Ailes _ also have worked on Quayle's congressional
campaigns.
   In Quayle's 1980 Senate race, much was made of the resemblance
between the young congressman and Robert Redford. At one point, the
actor sent Quayle a telegram complaining about the look-alike
references in his promotional literature. After he won, he sent
Redford an autographed picture of himself.
   Asked about the comparison this week, Quayle sighed. His blue
eyes flashed as he brushed his brownish-blond hair aside
impatiently.
   ``I've had that stigma since I first ran for the Senate. It's
stuck ever since,'' he says. ``Obviously I'd rather talk about the
issues. I think I have a feeling of what Jack Kennedy went through.
... I'd rather talk about what I stand for than what I look like.''
   Bush and President Reagan had a brief meeting at Belle Chasse
Naval Air Station, with president on his way to a California
vacation, the vice president on his way to assume his role as his
party's choice as Reagan's successor.
   When reporters asked Reagan if he knew the identity of Bush's
running mate, the president replied:
   ``I'm not sure that he knows.''
   Bush turned to Reagan and said, ``I know.''

   Edward Bennett Williams, a giant in the legal
and sports professions, was mourned by legends from both worlds
Tuesday at a funeral mass at St. Matthews' Cathedral.
   Former presidential contenders, cabinet officers, members of
Congress, media executives and sports hall of famers ranging from
baseball's Joe Dimaggio to football's Sonny Jurgenson were among
more than 1,000 people who paid their last respects to the
superlawyer who died Saturday after a long battle with cancer.
   Leroy Washington, who was Williams' driver when he was president
of the Washington Redskins, typified the sentiment echoed by all
when he said, ``The Big Man is gone, but he fought a good fight.''
   The taciturn DiMaggio, a close friend and board member of the
Baltimore Orioles, owned by Williams, commented simply: ``I'm happy
to be here, to say my farewell.''
   After the mass, Williams was buried in St. Gabriel's Cemetery,
near his home in Potomac, Md., a Washington suburb.
   The Rev. W. Louis Quinn, pastor of St. Matthews, said that
Williams had been confined to his home 10 days ago from the 11-year
battle against the cancer first detected in his colon.
   Quinn said Williams still would attend mass either in the
morning or the evening. ``Just a little over a week ago, he looked
at me with his eyes and he said, `I don't think I can beat it this
time,''' said Quinn. ``He was ready for the final battle ... to
meet his God.''
   Among those who attended were former senators and Democratic
presidential candidates George McGovern of South Dakato and Eugene
McCarthy, Iran-contra lawyer Arthur Liman, former vice presidential
candidate Sargent Shriver and his wife Eunice Shriver, a member of
the Kennedy clan, former Virginia Gov. Charles Robb, Maryland
Treasurer Louis Goldstein and various current and former stars of
the Orioles and Redskins.
   The Orioles brought two buses for their staff, including manager
Frank Robinson who said Williams ``was not only an outstanding
individual but a friend.'' Former Orioles pitcher Jim Palmer came
along.
   Williams had been been president of the Washington Redskins for
20 years before becoming the owner of the Orioles. Former Redskins
coach Jack Pardee, now with the University of Houston, former
quarterback Jurgensen, running backs John Riggins, Calvin Hill and
Larry Brown, linebacker Sam Huff, defensive back Brig Owens and
others represented the football team.
   Pallbearers included Joseph Califano, a cabinet member for
former President Jimmy Carter, Washington Post editor Ben Bradlee,
columinist Art Buchwald, movie association executive Jack Valenti
and law partner Brendan Sullivan, who is handling the Iran-contra
court case of former Marine Lt. Col. Oliver North. North also
attended the services.
   National Football League Commissioner Pete Rozelle, accompanied
by Baseball Commissioner Peter Ueberroth, said, ``It is a great
loss. He put up a hell of a fight.''
   Williams was a celebrated trial lawyer and influential
Washington insider whose clients ranged from the Teamsters' leader
James R. Hoffa to former Sen. Joseph McCarthy. He was 68 years old.
   He was well-known to some of the most powerful figures in
American public life. Vice President George Bush, who will become
the Republican presidential candidate Thursday evening, attended
his wake at a Washington funeral home Monday evening.
   Williams stood as a pillar of the Washington establishment, and
both Republican and Democratic presidents sought his friendship and
counsel.

   Homeowners in Minneapolis and St. Paul
will be able to water their lawns again starting Wednesday because
rainfall in the region has replenished the drought-parched upper
Mississippi River, officials said Tuesday.
   Municipal officials decided to lift the ban on most outdoor
water use after they were given the green light at a meeting of a
subcommittee of the state-federal drought task force. Rainfall in
the region so far this August has been above normal.
   The ban, which affected the two cities and 15 suburbs, was
imposed three weeks ago after the flow of the Mississippi River
dropped below 1,000 cubic feet per second for only the fourth time
since 1932. State officials said the river flow Tuesday morning at
the Anoka dam was 2,800 cubic feet per second.
   Rainfall in the Twin Cities during the first two weeks of August
has exceeded the combined total for May, June and July. Rainfall
also was adequate across central and northern Minnesota, topped by
6.5 inches last week at Grand Rapids, near the Mississippi's
headwaters.
   The sprinkling bans were imposed to reduce water drawn from the
river and avert the need to tap six headwater reservoirs.
Consumption in St. Paul and Minneapolis had dropped by nearly 30
million gallons daily in each city.

   A London family's drive in the country
ended in a bizarre accident when their car was struck by a cow
jumping over a hedge.
   Nigel and Delyth Bielby and their son, Richard, were rounding a
bend of a rural lane Sunday when ``this fully grown cow literally
jumped over a hedge at roadside and landed on their passing car,''
Sgt. Dennis Houghton of the Devon and Cornwall Constabulary said
Tuesday.
   ``It probably thought the grass was going to be a bit greener on
the other side.''
   The 5-foot hedge normally is high enough to fence in the
1,000-pound Holstein Friesian cow, Houghton said.
   The black-and-white cow shattered the windshield of the car and
damaged the hood, front fender and radiator. The family was not
injured.
   The pregnant cow suffered internal injuries and had to be
destroyed.

   Spearheading a Republican attack on Michael
Dukakis' limited foreign policy experience, former U.N. ambassador
Jeane Kirkpatrick said Tuesday night that the Democratic
presidential candidate's approach to world affairs is dangerous and
naive.
   In an address to the Republican National Convention, Mrs.
Kirkpatrick said Dukakis' policies would leave the nation
vulnerable to nuclear attack and remove any incentive for the
Soviet Union to make a nuclear arms control bargain.
   With repeated assertions that ``George Bush Knows Better,'' Mrs.
Kirkpatrick characterized the Dukakis approach as ``collectivism in
domestic affairs, weakness in defense and confusion about America's
role in the world.''
   She called Dukakis' policy pronouncements to date ``deeply
disturbing,'' criticizing him for advocating cuts in the U.S.
nuclear arsenal, ending the ``Star Wars'' strategic defense
initiative and emphasizing a buildup in conventional arms.
   ``We know Dukakis favors negotiations,'' she said. ``But his
proposed unilateral cuts would leave the Soviets no incentive to
negotiate ... Michael Dukakis doesn't say he will make America more
vulnerable, but that is the inevitable consequence of cancelling
major weapons systems.''
   Mrs. Kirkpatrick said the nuclear threat to the United States
comes not only from the Soviet Union but from the half dozen other
countries whom she said either have or soon will have nuclear
weapons and the capacity to deliver them on target.
   ``To speak as though we could defend ourselves against these
weapons with more and better tanks is simply ludicrous,'' she said
and added: ``Michael Dukakis simply does not take the need for a
defense seriously.''
   ``This attitude that weak is strong and vulnerable is safe _ is
extremely dangerous,'' she said. ``Michael Dukakis is more worried
about an American president's misuse of power than about an
adversary's use of it.''

and the proliferation of nuclear weapons, ``make the world too
dangerous for America to rely on naive, unrealistic, uninformed
strategies to defend our freedom,'' she said.
   ``The American people know there is no cram course for learning
about global politics, world needs, nuclear strategy, national
security,'' she said. ``It takes years of study, practice, and of
being there.''
   She accused Dukakis of hiding his true intentions behind
deliberately vague rhetoric.
   ``In the Dukakis campaign there is a large, carefully cultivated
discrepancy between conservative style and liberal substance,'' she
said and asked: ``Will it fool enough of the people for long enough
to elect Michael Dukakis?''
   ``We need a president who understands the world,'' she said.
``We cannot settle for less.''

   George Bush, in his quest for the presidency,
is promising to uphold the Reagan legacy on taxes, the economy and
defense, while trying to soften the Republicans' image on
education, the environment, child care and other domestic concerns.
   The Republican presidential nominee-to-be has been campaigning
in day care centers as well as defense plants, has called for a
moratorium on drilling for oil off the California coast and a ban
on ocean dumping. He has proposed bigger and more specific
education increases than Democrat Michael Dukakis.
   Bush tells voters everywhere, ``I won't raise your taxes,
period.'' He even backs lowering the tax rate on capital gains from
28 to 15 percent.
   Bush contends that particular tax cut would produce more revenue
for the Treasury, not less. Apart from his concept of letting the
overall budget grow no faster than inflation, Bush has not
specified what programs would be trimmed back to pay for his new
spending initiatives or rapid deployment of the Strategic Defense
Initiative.
   While his party has accused the Democrats of making promises in
their platform that could cost taxpayers $43 billion, GOP officials
said Tuesday they do not yet know how much it would cost to
implement everything in their platform.
   Nebraska Gov. Kay Orr, the platform chairman, apologized. ``It's
been a busy week,'' she said, and she said the Bush campaign would
provide answers in a few days.
   Bush is running on his experience in foreign affairs, from his
days as United Nations ambassador, envoy to China and director of
central intelligence to his globe-trotting duties of the past seven
years as a stand-in for President Reagan.
   After some hesitation, he has promised to deploy a space-based
defense shield _ Reagan's Strategic Defense Initiative _ ``as soon
as feasible,'' and has accused his Democratic foe of favoring
``unilateral disarmament.''
   But while pledging to keep America strong and to maintain the
policies that ushered in 69 straight months of economic growth,
Bush is also emphasizing domestic issues that were not at the top
of the Reagan agenda _ or budget.
   Bush, who says he would be ``the education president,'' has
proposed a $500 million program to reward schools that succeed with
children from poor homes. He also wants to increase the Head Start
budget, and create tax-free college savings bonds.
   While Congress wrestles with a $2.5 billion Democratic
child-care bill, Bush is proposing his own $2.2 billion, child-care
tax credit targeted at low-income families.
   Gingerly, this vice president who prides himself on loyalty has
broken with the official Reagan posture on ethics in government,
the environment, and the civil rights of AIDS patients.
   He has suggested he would take a harder line on human rights
issues during arms control talks with the Soviets, and promised to
``avoid swings between unjustified euphoria and exaggerated
pessimism'' in dealings with them.
   On defense spending, which doubled in the Reagan years, Bush
says, ``I believe that the administration's approach in rebuilding
America's defenses is fundamentally correct.'' But he promises to
overhaul Pentagon procurement and ``have no tolerance for waste.''
   Bush supports a mobile MX missile, which Dukakis opposes. Bush
says that the Midgetman missile _ a single warhead weapon that
would be hard for the Soviets to locate _ ``could enhance
stability.''
   Bush backs a 10 percent tax credit for oil and gas exploration.
He opposes an oil import fee.
   On reducing the federal deficit, Bush says, ``The most important
action we need to take ... is to hold the line on taxing and
spending.'' Like Reagan, he favors line-item veto authority and a
balanced budget amendment to the Constitution.
   He has proposed ``a flexible freeze,'' that would allow most
programs merely to keep pace with the rate of inflation. But to
make room for new spending initiatives, some programs would have to
be trimmed.
   Bush has promised to exempt Social Security from budget cuts.
   Deborah Steelman, Bush's domestic policy director, cited child
care, ethics, the environment and ``safe streets'' as key issues of
concern for Bush.
   Bush opposes abortion ``except in the case of incest, rape or to
save the life of the mother.'' He favors Medicaid funding of
abortion only to save a mother's life.
   On AIDS, Bush has said the government may have to spend more on
research and education. He endorsed a presidential commission's
call for legislation to protect the civil rights of AIDS victims
and those with the virus _ a step Reagan refused to take.
   On illicit drugs, Bush says he would make ``the war on drugs a
top priority.'' But he says the war will never be won unless young
people can be convinced to steer clear of drugs.
   He promises ``to see that all American families are able to
obtain decent, affordable housing,'' primarily by keeping interest
rates down, but also by continuing housing aid to low-income
families.
   Bush has said, ``We must do more to meet the needs of the
homeless,'' including development of community-based mental health
clinics.
   On crime, Bush says he will ``appoint judges who will crack down
on criminals,'' and he will seek to ``stop hamstringing our
police.'' In particular, he favors admission of illegally seized
evidence in criminal trials if the police had a good faith belief
their search was lawful.
   Bush supports the death penalty for those who commit ``heinous''
crimes, including cop-killers and drug kingpins.
   On health care, he promises ``a comprehensive effort to reduce
the cost and improve the quality of, and access to, health care in
America.'' He would seek to squeeze ``waste and inefficiency'' from
Medicare and Medicaid and promote health maintenance organizations.
   He favors tax incentives for group insurance plans to pay for
long-term care, and wants to allow Individual Retirement Accounts
to be converted to pay for long-term care. He also would ease
Medicaid requirements that force the needy elderly to ``spend
down'' their life savings before qualifying for help.
   Bush, who once ran an oil-drilling operation in the Gulf of
Mexico, says, ``there is no way to meet our energy requirements
without offshore drilling,'' but he would delay lease sales in
``extraordinarily sensitive areas'' like the California coast until
it is certain the coast will not be harmed.
   Bush favors full decontrol of natural gas, greater reliance on
coal and retention of nuclear power as ``part of our energy mix.''
   On ethics, Bush has promised to establish a White House ethics
office to hold government jobholders to ``an exacting code of
conduct.'' He also wants the federal ethics law applied to members
of Congress, as well as those in the executive branch.
   Bush opposes an Equal Rights Amendment to the Constitution and
any move to require federal registration of gun owners.
   He supports laws to allow voluntary prayer in public school.

<HEAD>Hispanic Agents Seek To Prove FBI Discrimination</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Adds final graf to clarify that agent did not name supervisor
he was referring to.</NOTE>

<TEXT>
   A Cuban-born FBI agent with a doctorate in
law testified Tuesday that he was told he couldn't be a legal
adviser for the agency in Washington because of his dark skin and
accent.
   Appearing as a witness for Hispanic agents suing the FBI for
discrimination, Fernando Mata also said he was ostracized by his
colleagues in the Miami FBI office for participating in a
fund-raiser for the lawsuit.
   The agents _ 311 of whom have joined the suit being tried in
U.S. District Court _ contend that the FBI discriminates against
Hispanics in hiring, promoting and disciplining. They are seeking
damages and a change in FBI promotion practices.
   The lawsuit, say Hispanic activists, could have ramifications
far beyond the agency.
   ``The '60s were the decade of blacks; the '70s were the decade
of women,'' Hugo Rodriguez, co-counsel for the plaintiffs, said.
``The '80s and '90s are the decades of the Hispanics. Hispanics are
here to be reckoned with. We think the laws should be applied to
them equally.''
   Jose de Lara, national director of the League of United Latin
American Citizens, said he expected more lawsuits contesting
discrimination by government agencies against Hispanics.
   ``Once we get a ruling on this issue, we're going to take this
issue all over the country,'' he said. ``This is sort of a
detonator that will get this issue going.''
   He said the case is important ``not only for law enforcement,
but for other departments as well, such as government offices in
other entities such as social workers.''
   The Justice Department, which is defending the FBI, has
dispatched a total of 23 people to mount the defense, including two
teams of lawyers, paralegals and non-Hispanic FBI agents. The
plaintiffs' legal team comprises three lawyers.
   Government lawyers in El Paso and department officials in
Washington refused comment Tuesday on the case.
   Also Tuesday, a statistical analyst hired by the plaintiffs
testified that the numbers show Hispanic FBI agents are less likely
to hold higher level jobs.
   Of 9,000 FBI agents, 400 are Hispanic, or 4.4 percent. Hispanics
make up 8 percent of the population.
   Gary LaFree, associate professor of sociology at the University
of New Mexico, testified that 15 percent of Hispanic FBI agents
with at least five years of agency experience are managers,
compared with 21 percent of non-Hispanic FBI agents with the same
level of experience.
   Hispanics and non-Hispanics do equally as well on management
test scores, said LaFree.
   Bernardo ``Matt'' Perez, who originally brought the suit, is the
highest ranking Hispanic in the FBI. He is second-in-command in El
Paso.
   Mata, with the FBI in Miami, testified that a few years ago he
applied for a job as legal adviser in Washington. He was an
assistant legal adviser in Newark at the time.
   He was turned down for the Washington job.
   ``I was told that as a person who spoke with an accent and who
had dark skin that looked Hispanic, it would look bad for me to
represent the FBI,'' he said.
   Mata did not attribute what he was told to any individual. In
his testimony he referred to his supervisors vaguely as ``they'' or
``them.''

   Gay rights activists jeered Vice President
George Bush upon his arrival Tuesday for the Republican National
Convention and were escorted away by police when confronted by
angry Bush supporters.
   One demonstrator was later arrested and booked with disturbing
the peace.
   Bush was seconds into his speech at a riverside rally when a
dozen demonstrators began shouting from about 30 yards away.
   The protesters, mostly young men, locked arms and stood in a
circle, facing Bush supporters who shouted back, ``Bush '88.''
   The demonstrators carried pink and green signs accusing the
Reagan administration of failing to fight acquired immune
deficiency syndrome, and chanted ``40,000 are dead of AIDS _ where
was George?''
   As the crowd pressed in around the demonstrators, some Bush
supporters shouted obscenities and one reached to tear down a
protester's sign. A man in the crowd pulled him away, saying,
``Don't do it, it looks bad.''
   Some in the crowd held pro-Bush signs high to cover those of the
demonstrators, who police hustled away within five minutes. One
demonstrator later was arrested.
   Earlier in the day, about 20 people staged an uneventful protest
at a New Orleans pharmaceutical company, IMREG, which makes one of
the few drugs found to have an effect on AIDS. The government has
not yet approved the drug for public use.
   All was quiet, meanwhile, at Lafayette Square, where a stage and
sound system was set up for demonstrators this week. The convention
has drawn relatively few protesters.

   Here are excerpts from the prepared text of
the keynote address by Gov. Thomas H. Kean of New Jersey to the
Republican National Convention on Tuesday night.
   ... A great deal about the Dukakis campaign can be summed up by
one incident.
   You see this flag of red, white and blue?
   It symbolizes the land of the free and the home of the brave.
   Well, their media consultants in Atlanta said they didn't think
the colors looked good on television.
   So they changed red to pink, blue to azure, and the white to egg
shell.
   Well, I don't know about you, but I believe Americans, Democrat
and Republican alike, have no use for pastel patriotism.
   But the liberal Democrats are trying to hide more than the
colors in our flag _ they are trying to hide their true colors.
   They want higher taxes.
   But they won't say so.
   They want to weaken America.
   But they won't admit it. ...
   We are not afraid to show our true Republican colors. Our
purpose was spoken more than 100 years ago by a man who said
America means a government whose ``leading object is to elevate the
condition of men _ to lift artificial weights from all shoulders _
to afford every person an unfettered start, and a fair chance, in
the race of life.''
   Those words were Abraham Lincoln's. And my fellow Republicans,
his creed is our creed.
   When we have followed it, we have succeeded.
   When we have deviated from it, we have failed.
   ... Today Americans have the same dreams, but the answer to
those dreams will not come through bigger government in Washington.
   You see, that's what the Democrats offer.
   It's no wonder the most popular movie in Atlanta during their
convention was ``Big'' _ they thought it was a documentary on their
philosophy. ...
   .. The Dukakis Democrats will try to talk tough.
   But don't be fooled.
   They may try to talk like Dirty Harry. But they will still act
like Pee Wee Herman. ...
   In 200 years, there has never been a candidate for president
whose experience in world affairs and knowledge of foreign nations
has exceeded that of George Bush.
   We must stay the course at home, as well. If the Reagan-Bush
years have proved anything, it is that the heroes of the American
economy are not paper pushers along the Potomac, but dream makers
in Dayton, Denver and Dallas. ...
   The Dukakis Democrats don't believe that. ... They make promises
without a price tag. ...
   Add up all the way-out programs of the Democratic Party. What
does the name of Dukakis sound like to you? More taxes. ...
   Eight years ago, we gained power because Americans yearned for
freedom. Freedom from the shackles of high taxes, freedom from the
tyranny of inflation, freedom from the burdens of big government.
And we wanted freedom from the embarrassment of an America that
wore a ``kick me'' sign on its back.

   Well, we Republicans delivered. After eight years of Ronald
Reagan and George Bush, our country is stronger, safer and better
today _ and Americans are proud to admit it!
   But new challenges lie ahead. ... we want new freedoms.
   Freedom from racism. Freedom from poor schools. Freedom from
polluted oceans. Freedom from crack dealers.
   And most of all, we want freedom to know that our future will be
made right here; in the United States of America.
   Many of us have been blessed with good jobs, good homes and good
families, but we also care about those who are not so fortunate.
   We have to care. Because their future is now our future. Their
tomorrow is our tomorrow. The simple truth is: there are no spare
Americans any longer.
   To those who are ill-schooled, ill-trained or ill-housed _ we
must reach out and lift the artificial weights as Lincoln promised.
As Republicans, we will do it not only because economically it is
the only thing to do, but because morally it is the right thing to
do. ...
   As a child, I had a terrible stutter. I also had dyslexia. I
overcame those problems, but I couldn't have done it alone. I went
to a good school. I had good teachers.
   Today, a lot of children across America struggle with problems.
With a little help from a good school or a great teacher, today's
stuttering child could be tomorrow's keynote speaker _ today's
potential dropout could become tomorrow's Thomas Edison. ...
   When schools fail year after year, let's admit it is the fault
of adults, not children. Stop blaming the children. Fix the schools.
   And children cannot be educated if their minds are clouded by
drugs. Kingpins who make millions by selling drugs to children are
merchants of death.
   I agree with George Bush. Those who dispense illegal drugs,
should be prepared to have death dispensed to them. ...
   George Bush is a decent man _ and he shouldn't have to defend
his being one. If defending values such as loyalty, family, or
belief in God is no longer fashionable, then I fear for our
country. ...
   Today our air is plagued by acid rain _ our oceans and beaches
are sullied by sewage and syringes _ our very future threatened by
sunburn from above and poisoned water from below.
   The party of Teddy Roosevelt must regain our environmental
heritage. In the 1990s we are going to clean America from one coast
to the other _ you know what? We are going to start way up north _
in Boston Harbor! ...
   Let us send one message to the Democrats this evening _ we will
not concede one single vote anywhere! Let the Dukakis Democrats
offer the politics of delusion and exclusion. We Republicans will
practice the ``Politics of inclusion.'' ...
   With God's help, we will reclaim the faith of our fathers _ we
will ``practice the Politics of Inclusion.''
   With George Bush as our leader, we will redeem our American
Dream. ...

<TEXT>
   Sen. Dan Quayle's name was raised in a
sex-and-influence scandal when he was a member of House in 1981,
although he denied having an affair with the woman involved,
lobbyist Paula Parkinson.
   ``That's been looked into and there's absolutely nothing to
it,'' said James A. Baker III, soon to become George Bush's
campaign chairman.
   Quayle, now the junior senator from Indiana, was one of three
House members who shared a cottage with Mrs. Parkinson during a
golfing vacation in Florida in January 1980.
   Mrs. Parkinson, who appeared nude in Playboy magazine that same
year, said she was going to tell Justice Department investigators
that she had love affairs with ``fewer than a dozen'' Republican
House members.
   And she told The Washington Post in March 1981 that she had
videotaped one of her sexual encounters with a congressman. Neither
the tape or the name of the congressman _ if there was such a
congressman _ have been made public.
   She also told the Post that she had accepted $500 in cash a
member of Congress to pay for the abortion of their unborn child.
The name of that congressman also has not surfaced.
   At the time of the incident, Mrs. Parkinson was 30 years old and
separated from her husband, Hank Parkinson.
   She was a registered lobbyist for an insurance industry group
opposed to proposed legislation to set up a national crop insurance
program. The bill passed by a 235-150 margin in September 1980, and
Quayle voted against it.
   The Justice Department investigated Mrs. Parkinson's activities,
but in August 1981, officials dropped the case and did not file
criminal charges.
   ``She gave us some salacious accounts of purported activities
with congressmen, but there was no evidence of federal violation,''
sources said at the time.
   The two congressmen besides Quayle who shared the Florida
cottage with Parkinson were Rep. Tom Railsback, R-Ill., and Rep.
Thomas B. Evans, R-Del.
   Parkinson said she had an affair lasting seven months with
Evans, who later left the House. Evans declined to characterize the
nature of his relationship with Mrs. Parkinson, but did say: ``I
deeply regret any association I ever had'' with her.

   Sen. Dan Quayle says comparisons to Robert
Redford are a ``stigma'' he must bear. But beyond the golden good
looks, the man tapped for the No. 2 spot on the Republican ticket
aims to be taken seriously.
   George Bush announced Tuesday before a cheering crowd on the
Mississippi riverfront that he had chosen Indiana's junior senator
as his running mate. Quayle stepped up and told Bush: ``Let's go
get 'em.''
   An ardent conservative in his second Senate term, Quayle has
seen little of the national spotlight and has yet to attain the
level of peer respect enjoyed by his senior colleague, Sen. Richard
Lugar.
   Quayle, 41, acknowledges that he was not exactly a household
word when news came that he was a hot vice presidential prospect.
   With his youth and movie star looks, he was quickly mobbed by
the media at the Republican National Convention. He basked in the
attention. ``A few more days of this _ we can take it,'' he joked
at one point.
   Quayle admits that ``life has been very good to me. I never had
to worry about where I was going to go.''
   Tuesday, sharing the stage with Bush, Quayle told the crowd he
was honored and ``a bit humbled,'' and went on to invoke ``what my
grandfather told me: that there is nothing more important in this
country than freedom.''
   He added, ``George Bush will keep the freedom and peace of this
world.''
   Bush, for his part, introduced Quayle as ``freedom's friend ...
a man of the future. A young man born in the middle of this century
and from the middle of America.''
   Later, Treasury Secretary James A. Baker III told reporters that
Quayle was ``a man of the future ... a leader for the future'' and
``an excellent campaigner.'' He said Quayle's youth and the fact
that his wife had practiced law and had been ``a professional
woman'' enhanced his value to the ticket.
   Born in Indianapolis, J. Danforth Quayle is a member of a
prominent publishing family, the Pulliams. His grandfather was
Eugene C. Pulliam, publisher of the Indianapolis Star and News, the
Arizona Republic and the Phoenix Gazette. Quayle's father, James C.
Quayle, is publisher of the Huntington Herald-Press.
   He attended DePauw University, which many of his relatives
attended, joined the family's fraternity of choice and waited
tables at a sorority house for $40 a month.
   Quayle met his wife, Marilyn, at law school, and they were
married 10 weeks after their first date. ``Everything clicked
perfectly,'' said Mrs. Quayle, also a lawyer.
   Quayle was associate publisher of the Huntington Herald-Press
from 1974 to 1976, when he was elected to the House. Five months
into his second term, Quayle announced he would challenge veteran
incumbent Democrat, Sen. Birch Bayh.
   It was in the 1980 Senate race that much was made of the
resemblance between the young congressman and Robert Redford. At
one point, the actor sent Quayle a telegram telling him to stop the
look-alike references in his promotional literature. Quayle replied
that it was the fault of the media, not his literature. After he
won, he sent Redford an autographed picture of himself.
   Asked about the comparison this week, Quayle sighed. His blue
eyes flashed as he brushed his brownish-blond hair aside
impatiently.
   ``I've had that stigma since I first ran for the Senate. It's
stuck ever since,'' he says. ``Obviously I'd rather talk about the
issues. I think I have a feeling of what Jack Kennedy went through.
... I'd rather talk about what I stand for than what I look like.''
   Quayle defeated Bayh with 54 percent of the vote, and easily won
re-election in 1986. When he first arrived in the Senate, he was
dismissed by many as a blow-dried golden boy. But Quayle set to
work to erase that image, and carved out a niche for himself on the
Armed Services Committee, where he specializes in matters involving
the NATO alliance.
   He supported the Reagan administration view that research for
President Reagan's space-based missile defense system, popularly
called Star Wars, is permitted under the Anti-Ballistic Missile
Treaty. He was a proponent of the president's recent veto of the
defense authorization bill, which Reagan opposed because of various
arms control restrictions.
   In the Budget Committee, Quayle has been a hard-line
conservative, speaking out to recommend more money for defense. And
he was a chief opponent in the Senate of plant closing legislation
to require companies to give workers advance notice if a plant was
going to be shut down.
   He is proud of his accomplishments during his first years in the
Senate, when the Republicans still had the majority and he helped
devise and enact a new jobs training program.
   An avid golfer and vigorous campaigner, Quayle is also a family
man who likes to keep separate his personal and public life.
   Quayle has talked to his wife and three children about the
impact of a vice presidential race on their family and said that,
all things being equal, he would not choose to make a run for
national office this year.
   And he already has experienced one negative side effect of the
heightened public attention.
   During the speculation about his vice presidential prospects,
some newspapers recalled a 1980 scandal involving lobbyist Paula
Parkinson, who shared a Florida house with several lawmakers,
including Quayle, then a congressman, on a golfing vacation.
Parkinson, who later posed nude for Playboy, said she had an affair
with one of the lawmakers _ not Quayle, who denied any relationship
with Parkinson.
   Quayle said Bush hasn't asked him about that episode. And he
reiterated that he had done nothing wrong.
   ``That's all public record. I think people who know me and know
my family know there's no factual basis to what has been written,''
he said. ``If you try to say that somehow I was implicated, that's
just not true.''
   Quayle acknowledges that ``in this day of scrutiny,'' such
publicity seems to come with the territory.
   For the vice presidential nominee, ``there are 15,000
journalists who want to grab him by the ankles, turn him upside
down and shake him until something bad comes out,'' Quayle said.

<HEAD>Firefighters Keep Eye on Fires Close to Montana Homes</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Firefighters kept a close watch Tuesday on fires threatening
homes in a Montana town, while high winds fanned flames in
Wyoming's Yellowstone National Park and elsewhere in the West.
   Two wind-driven fires burned out of control Tuesday in the
southeastern Montana town of Lame Deer, threatening housing
developments and forcing the temporary evacuation of 40 houses
Monday night. Fire crews, which had carved lines around the flames,
stood by in case the fires jumped the lines.
   The 12,000-acre Slick blaze crept to within 300 yards of houses
southwest of town Monday, and a 1,500-acre fire 1{ miles to the
northwest burned up to and around a trailer home before crews
blocked its path with a fire line, said fire information officer
Jerry Chapman.
   Winds of 12 mph to 15 mph hampered firefighting efforts early
Tuesday, but the wind shifted later and began blowing the fires
back into themselves to the south, Chapman said.
   In Idaho, dry, windy weather delayed control of the 2,175-acre
Ruby Rapids fire in the Nez Perce National Forest in the
west-central part of the state, but firefighters were having more
success in other parts of the state.
   At Yellowstone, home of the famed Old Faithful geyser, park
officials reopened the west entrance Tuesday, but fallen trees and
poor visibility from a 60,000-acre fire forced them to keep 14
miles of road closed.
   ``There's quite a lot of fire activity there again today, (and)
they're still cleaning up from yesterday,'' said park spokeswoman
Joan Anzelmo.
   The 292-space Madison Junction campground also remained
off-limits to tourists Tuesday.
   Heavy winds were hampering efforts to combat the flames, which
have charred about 241,000 acres of the country's oldest national
park.
   ``The only help we're getting is from the cooler temperatures,''
said Anzelmo, adding that thermometers Tuesday afternoon had hit
only the mid-70s.
   In Idaho, a few days of rain have given a major boost to the
crews that have been trying to get the upper hand on forest fires
for weeks.
   Both the Nez Perce and Payette forests in west-central Idaho
were hit by more lightning Monday, setting off new fires. But most
were small and quickly controlled, forest officials said.
   ``Every night we can count on getting hammered,'' said Mary
Zabinski, Nez Perce information officer.
   Winds up to 30 mph and dry weather pushed back the control time
on the Ruby Rapids fire along the Main Salmon River from Monday to
Wednesday. An incendiary device was found at the scene, and the
Salmon Ranger District is offering a $5,000 reward for information
about the apparent arson, Ms. Zabinski said.
   To the south, fairly steady rain fell for a third day on the
Payette National Forest. Spokesman Dave Olson said lightning
activity diminished, and rain was expected to continue sweeping
through the forest.
   ``Things are looking real good,'' Olson said.
   Elsewhere in Montana, officials closed public access to 58,000
acres in the fire-ravaged Elkhorn Mountains about 10 miles
southeast of Helena. The area was closed as a safety precaution and
will remain closed until further notice, said fire information
officer Bob Krepps.
   A fire in the mountains increased from 3,000 acres Monday to
4,175 acres after winds fanned flames 200-300 feet high and sent
the blaze racing along a mountain ridge into heavy timber. The fire
continued to burn uncontrolled late Tuesday, Krepps said.

   New Jersey Gov. Thomas Kean, using his
keynote address to launch an unrelenting attack on the Democratic
opposition, told the Republican National Convention on Tuesday that
Michael Dukakis and his party talk tough like Dirty Harry but ``act
like Pee Wee Herman.''
   ``They want higher taxes but they won't say so,'' Kean said.
``They want to weaken America but they won't admit it. And they
want to play the politics of special interests.''
   The New Jersey governor, selected to give the prime-time speech
because of his success in attracting traditional Democrats to the
Republican Party, coupled his attacks on ``Dukakis Democrats'' with
a vision for a George Bush victory in November.
   Touting his trademark ``politics of inclusion,'' Kean declared,
``We will not concede one single vote anywhere.''
   ``With George Bush at the helm, we will go to the farms and the
cities; to the barrios and the union halls; to the suburban
developments as well as the country roads,'' Kean said.
   ``Let the Dukakis Democrats offer the politics of delusion and
exclusion,'' he said. ``We Republicans will practice the politics
of inclusion.''
   Kean took note that the Democrats chose a color scheme of
pastels at their national convention in Atlanta last month, rather
than red, white and blue.
   ``I don't know about you, but I believe Americans, Democrats and
Republicans alike, have no use for pastel patriotism,'' Kean said
in remarks prepared for delivery to the convention.
   ``The liberal Democrats are trying to hide more than the colors
of our flag. They are trying to hide their true colors,'' Kean said.
   Democrats chose the pastel colors after deciding they would look
better on television.
   While repeating the ``Dukakis Democrats'' refrain, Kean never
specifically intoned the name ``Michael Dukakis'' in his remarks.
   Laying out a course for the Republican Party after President
Reagan, Kean said the GOP must convince voters that it is the party
``willing to tell the truth to the American people.''
   Kean said Dukakis would return America to ``the oppression of
Jimmy Carter's inflation'' and weaken the international might
restored by Reagan.
   ``The Dukakis Democrats will try to talk tough. But don't be
fooled. They may talk like Dirty Harry. But they will still act
like Pee Wee Herman,'' Kean said.
   Dirty Harry is the hard-talking, quick-shooting cop portrayed by
Hollywood tough guy Clint Eastwood. Pee Wee Herman is the
squeaky-voiced wimpish television and movie personality.
   In a speech that Kean said saw a dozen drafts, he quoted Abraham
Lincoln and the Bible, and invoked American symbols like the
Pilgrim ship Mayflower and Columbus' Santa Maria.
   And, in another Dukakis barb, the governor even cited a
Hollywood classic.
   ``Only in America could the Democrats draft a platform that has
`Gone With The Wind,''' he said. The famous Civil War film is set
in the Georgia capital.
   Kean, a moderate, is completing his second term as New Jersey
governor. Elected in 1981 by the narrowest margin in state history,
he was returned to office four years later by the largest. In that
election, he won the support of more than 60 percent of the state's
blacks and minorities.
   Kean is the son of the late Rep. Robert W. Kean, a 20-term House
member, and his ancestors include several members of Congress and
New Jersey's first constitutional governor.
   Forebearer John Kean was a contemporary of George Washington,
who appointed him first cashier of the Bank of the United States.
In New Jersey, the family's influence can be seen at Kean College
and in the town of Keansburg.
   Thomas Kean first saw politics at his father's elbow. The boy
commuted between the family's home in Washington and their estate
in Livingston, N.J., where he still lives with his wife and their
three children.
   Kean attended Princeton University in New Jersey, and earned a
master's degree in history from Columbia University. He taught high
school and later had a stint at running the family real-estate
business.
   First elected to the state Assembly in 1967, Kean captured the
Statehouse four years later, and again in 1985 in one of the
state's most dramatic political tales.
   In 1981, Kean emerged from a field of eight would-be GOP
governors to win the nomination by less than 40,000 votes. He won a
narrow victory in the general election over Democratic Rep. James
Florio, eking out a win by less than 1,800 votes.
   Four years later, voters retained Kean by the biggest-ever
margin, with 70 percent of the vote and majorities in all but three
of New Jersey's 567 municipalities.

   Hundreds of screaming fans jammed the
tax office in Quezon City on Tuesday as Vilma Santos, one of the
country's most famous actresses, showed up to pay her delinquent
taxes.
   Ms. Santos handed over a check to Bienvenido Tan, commissioner
of the Bureau of Internal Revenue. Fans surged forward seeking
autographs.
   The bureau refused to say how much Ms. Santos paid, but the
government said earlier that she owed about $200,000.
   Ms. Santos' payment was part of a campaign by the government to
collect delinquent taxes from prominent business and entertainment
figures.
   Ms. Santos hosts a popular television variety program and has
appeared in numerous Filipino films. She has frequently performed
for Filipino communities in the United States and Asia.

<TEXT>
   A state appeals court Tuesday ordered a county
medical medical center to stop feeding a 77-year-old woman who is
the focus of a right-to-die battle, but stayed the decision for
five days to give the county a chance to appeal.
   In a 3-to-2 decision, the state Appellate Division in Brooklyn
upheld a lower court ruling that the woman, Mary O'Connor, can be
removed from all artificial life support systems.
   Mrs. O'Connor, of the Bronx, has been physically and mentally
incapacitated by a series of strokes. Officials at Westchester
County Medical Center say she is conscious but unable to speak or
swallow.
   She has been fed intravenously, and the hospital also wanted to
use a nasal feeding tube to provide nutrition.
   The judgment was stayed for five days, however.
   ``It's a precedent-setting situation,'' said Barry Bowman, a
spokesman for the medical center. ``What we have here is a
conscious patient and a decision being made by surrogates as
opposed to a patient who is brain dead or in a persistent vegetated
state.''
   He said a decision had not been made whether to appeal to the
state Court of Appeals in Albany, New York's highest court.
   The woman's daughters, both licensed practical nurses, initiated
the right-to-die battle last month to stop the medical center from
inserting the nasal feeding tube and to halt the intravenous
feeding.
   They said their mother had told them on numerous occasions that
she would not want to be kept alive by artificial means.
   ``We agree with the Supreme Court that Mrs. O'Connor's desires,
expressed when she was competent, to decline any life sustaining
treatment, including a naso-gastric tube and intravenous feeding,
in her current condition, was established by clear and convincing
evidence,'' said the decision written by Justice Guy Magano and
signed by Justices Moses Weinstein and Isaac Rubin. Justices
Vincent Balletta and Richard Brown dissented.
   Balletta wrote: ``In the absence of a medical consensus that a
patient in Mrs. O'Connor's condition would not suffer severe pain
and thirst in the process of dying without hydration and nutrition,
it is in my view that it is cruel and inhuman to sentence her to
death which will be accompanied by such extreme discomfort.''
   Julius Cohn, who represents Mrs. O'Connor's daughters, said he
``obviously agreed'' with the appeals court decision but said he
expected the legal battle to continue.
   On July 26, state Supreme Court Justice Nicholas Colabella
ordered that the medical center stop efforts to feed Mrs. O'Connor
and allow her to die. Colabella directed that the hospital provide
painkillers and help get Mrs. O'Connor home.
   His trial-level ruling was stayed while the medical center
appealed to the Appellate Division.

<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   George Bush didn't need Dan Quayle as his
running mate to win Indiana's 12 electoral votes. After all, if
Bush can't on his own win a state that has voted Republican 11
times out of 12, he's in deep trouble.
   No, the strategy behind the choice of the Indiana senator is
generational: the 64-year-old Bush choose Quayle because he is 41
years old and looks younger.
   ``Dan Quayle is a man of the future, a young man born in the
middle of this century and from the middle of America,'' Bush said
in announcing his choice Tuesday, ``a dynamic young leader for the
future of this party.''
   Bush's choice presents a stark contrast to Dukakis' strictly
political decision to tap 67-year-old Lloyd Bentsen of Texas for
his running mate.
   Dukakis selected Bentsen to help him win Texas' 29 electoral
votes _ a classic case of Electoral College strategy. Any other
benefits from the choice are just icing on the political cake.
   Indeed, Quayle is the first member of the post-World War II baby
boom to be named to a national ticket, leading campaign
chairman-to-be James A. Baker III to call the decision ``a bold
stroke across the generations.'' It ``should give us a chance to
appeal to baby boom voters,'' said Charlie Black, a Bush adviser.
   ``He's within my generation,'' said 31-year-old Steve Wark, a
Nevada delegate. ``He's not my grandfather.''
   ``He looks like one of George Bush's sons,'' West Virginia's
state party chairman Edgar Heiskell said.
   The argument that a baby-boom candidate would win more
baby-boomer votes is fiercely debated in the political and academic
communities, but little data is really available to test it. After
the 1988 election, maybe we will know more.
   Republican strategists do argue that younger voters are the
GOP's hope of becoming the majority party in this country. Those
whose political life covers only the Carter and Reagan presidencies
tend to be heavily Republican. If that group can be kept within the
party, the GOP will get stronger and stronger as the more
Democratic older voters pass from the scene.
   In some polls, Bush has been doing better among younger voters.
   A Gallup Poll Aug. 5-7 found Bush leading 54-40 among those
under 30 years of age, while those over 50 went to Democrat Michael
Dukakis buy a 53-37 margin.
   Such a generational appeal is not a new idea. After all,
Democratic Sens. Al Gore Jr. and Joseph Biden, two baby boomers,
made generational appeals in attempting to win their party's
presidential nomination. They lost out to the 54-year-old Dukakis.
   There are four other potential benefits from the choice of
Quayle:
   _ He is good on television.
   _ He may help in the Midwest, a Republican stronghold now under
Democratic siege.
   _ He is a strong conservative.
   _ And, if you believe some Republicans, he might add a missing
dimension to the ticket for women.
   Quayle is one of the new generation of politicians who is
comfortable with and looks good on television. Bush, to be
charitable, fails to communicate well through the video medium.
   Sen. John McCain of Arizona said Quayle is ``extremely telegenic
in this day of television and images.''
   Republicans have been able to count on strong support from the
Midwest for years, but the farm crisis has sapped that strength.
   It is a region that is up for grabs, for the Democratic ticket
has no special appeal there either. The only drawback for the
Republicans is that there is no evidence that the vice presidential
nominee has a regional impact, as opposed to one in only his home
state.
   Quayle is also a conservative with a capital ``C.'' There are
simply no obvious defects in his record from a conservative's point
of view.
   Quayle's good looks _ he has been called the Republican Robert
Redford _ could be a plus as well, some argue.
   McCain said that ``I can't believe a guy that handsome wouldn't
be attractive in some respect'' to women.
   But Quayle's selection was immediately attacked by at least one
group concerned with women's issues.
   ``With the nomination of Daniel Quayle for vice president,
George Bush has essentially written off the women's vote,''
asserted Kate Michaelman, executive director of the National
Abortion Rights Action League.
   ``Daniel Quayle has an extraordinary anti-women record in his
tenure in the Senate. He is opposed to a woman's right to choose.
He is opposed to the ERA. He opposes almost every program that has
been advanced since 1980 that would enhance women's rights and
women's well-being.''
   Women are a big problem for Bush. According to several surveys,
they hold negative views of him and support Dukakis in far greater
numbers than men.
   Whether Quayle helps shrink the so-called gender gap or becomes
of liability with women remains, of course, to be seen.
   A vice presidential candidate like Quayle can help his party in
a number of ways, but it is still the presidential candidates whom
the voters are focusing on as they make their choice.

   Rallies calling for free elections in the
Soviet-bloc countries will be held in 33 cities in Canada, the
United States, Western Europe and Australia on Aug. 23, the
Toronto-based organizers said Tuesday.
   The International Black Ribbon Day Committee, founded in Toronto
in 1986, said coordinated rallies also are planned in some
Soviet-bloc cities but for security reasons the locations would not
be announced until Aug. 22.
   ``We want Mr. Gorbachev to live up to the spirit of glasnost and
allow free and fair elections starting at the municipal level,''
said committee founder Markus Hess. He referred to Soviet leader
Mikhail S. Gorbachev and his policy of glasnost _ more openness in
certain areas of Soviet society.
   The committee organized similar rallies last year on Aug. 23.
That is the date in 1939 when the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany
reached a secret agreement in which the Soviets took over the
Baltic states of Estonia, Lithuania and Latvia with German assent.
   The Black Ribbon Day Committee has said rallies are scheduled in
14 Canadian cities; at Boston's City Hall; Chicago's Daley Plaza;
St. Patrick's Cathedral in New York; Cleveland; Hartford, Conn.;
Los Angeles; Philadelphia; Rochester, N.Y.; Seattle and Washington,
D.C.
   In Australia demonstrations are set for Sydney, Perth, Victoria
and Thilmere, the committee said, while rallies in Western Europe
are planned in London, Bern, Munich, Paris and Stockholm.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   About six tons of U.S.-supplied food, clothing
and tents have been sent to southern Honduras over the past 10 days
to assist a large group of Contra rebels and Nicaraguan civilians
who have fled to that area, the State Department said Tuesday.
   Spokeswoman Phyllis Oakley said the exodus reflects increased
represssion by the leftist Sandinista government and the dire
condition of Contra units that have been left without any means of
resupply inside Nicaragua.
   ``The blocking of delivery of humanitarian aid by the Sandinista
regime has resulted in severe hunger, disease and injury to some
resistance fighters,'' she said.
   According to reports from the border area, more than 1,000
soldiers and civilians arrived there last week from a central
Nicaraguan combat zone. Another group, estimated at about 2,500, is
said to be en route to the area.
   The Contra leadership said the new arrivals joined about 8,000
combatants and 5,000 civilians.
   The assistance, part of $17 million in humanitarian aid approved
for the rebels by Congress last March, is intended to help sustain
the Contras through September.
   Last week, the Senate approved by a 49-47 vote a Democratic plan
to provide $27 million in humanitarian assistance to the Contras in
the new fiscal year starting Oct. 1. Senate Republicans, who had
sought military as well as humanitarian assistance, voted against
the proposal.

   A mother who won a federal court battle to
enroll her adopted, AIDS-infected, mentally handicapped daughter in
public school will appeal the judge's order that the youngster
remain isolated in a classroom booth.
   Steve Hanlon, attorney for Rosa Martinez, 36, said he filed
notice of appeal Tuesday.
   He said he plans to ask the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
in Atlanta for a speedy hearing, but is doubtful the case could be
resolved before school starts Aug. 29. If it isn't, Eliana
Martinez, 6, won't be starting school as planned, he said.
   U.S. District Judge Elizabeth Kovachevich ruled last week that
the Hillsborough County School Board must admit the child to
Manhattan Exceptional Center to be schooled with her peers.
   The judge said the child would remain inside a plexiglass
enclosure until she became toilet-trained and learned to stop
sucking her thumb and forefingers.
   School officials objected, wanting her to remain on homebound
instruction instead out of fear she could transmit the deadly virus
that causes acquired immune deficiency syndrome.
   ``We were hopeful the judge's solution might work,'' Hanlon
said. ``But after talking with pediatric and psychological experts
_ people whose judgments we respect a great deal _ we are convinced
it would be very harmful, even to the extent of affecting her
immune system.''
   Eliana is in the advanced stages of AIDS, which doctors believe
she contracted from multiple blood transfusions following her
premature birth in Puerto Rico.
   In a separate matter, Mrs. Martinez, a licensed practical nurse,
was arrested Monday and charged with improperly obtaining $200 or
more in government assistance in 1986. She was released on her own
recognizance a few hours later.
   Mrs. Martinez said she was unemployed when she and her husband
separated. She applied for food stamps and then took a part-time
nursing job without reporting the income _ about $100 a week or
less _ to state officials, she said.
   ``No one wanted to take care of Eliana,'' she said. ``Joey (her
husband) wasn't here and it was the only kind of work I could do. I
figured that's not all that much money; it's not going to make that
much difference.''
   The welfare-fraud charge is a third-degree felony. Hanlon said
prosecutors might let her participate in a first-offender program
that would leave her with a clean record.

   Here is a transcript of the address delivered
by Gov. Kay Orr, the co-chairman of the Republican platform
committee, to the Republican National Convention Tuesday night:
   Thank you very, very much. Nebraska, you are so special to me.
   Tonight, I want to tell you exactly who our Republican platform
is for.
   Our platform is far, far superior to the one the Democrats
cobbled together in Atlanta. The difference is simple. Republicans
share their vision with the American people. Democrats hide from
the people.
   Last week, 106 women and men arrived here, here in New Orleans
to construct the platform that reflects our party's deepest beliefs
and aims. George Bush spoke to us last week and shared with us his
vision on a whole range of issues that confront our country:
keeping taxes low for economic growth, preserving peace through
strength, fighting drugs and improving education.
   The vice president said that Governor Dukakis was the stealth
candidate. Like the stealth bomber, Dukakis tried to hide himself
and his positions from the people. George Bush is right and the
Democrats' platform proves it.
   You know, fellow delegates, you won't find some very basic words
in the Democratic platform. Words like ``tax,'' or ``revenue,'' or
``unemployment.'' You won't find any mention of NATO, and you won't
find words like ``church'' or ``synagogue.''
   The Democrats want to hide their views from the American people
because they knew that if the people ever found out what they
really believed, they would lose. They don't want people to know
that they are still the party that will raise taxes and weaken our
defense.
   Let me give you one example of the contrast between our platform
and Democrats' stealth platform. We say loud and clear what Vice
President Bush has said so many times: We won't raise taxes,
period. Higher taxes cost jobs.
   But the Democrats' platform doesn't say a word about taxes. Why?
   Last month, there was a poll taken of the Democratic delegates.
And that poll showed the Democrats' hypocrisy. Sixty-seven percent
of the delegates favored a tax increase; but 65 percent said they
wanted to keep it out of the platform.
   On issue after issue the contrast is clear _ Democrats say
nothing. Or else they quote their views in empty rhetoric. But
Republicans tell the American people exactly what we stand for and
exactly where we will lead this country after we win November.
   We're for children's tax credits, to let the parents decide how
their children will be cared for. We're for college savings bonds,
to help families save for college. We're for aggressive action in
the war on drugs, including mandatory sentencing for drug dealers.
   If any of you is still skeptical, we'll prove it to you. Just
write the Republican National Committee in Washington and ask for a
copy of the side-by-side platforms that I'm holding. Or you can
write your local newspaper and ask them to print it, so that all
the voters will understand that we are the party of opportunity and
understand where the two parties stand.
   Fellow Republicans and Americans, I am very proud to represent
the people of the state of Nebraska. People in Nebraska are special
people who provide us not only with the products of their hard
work. But they are also a people who have a way of life that is
based on sound values and common sense. Rural America is the
heartland in more ways than one.
   The contribution of farming families to our country is not only
economic but moral. For the values that are needed to be a good
farmer are the same values that built America. Farmers have been
through some tough and painful times recently. But at the same
time, Republicans are optimistic about the future of American
agriculture.
   We reject the Democrats' idea of mandatory production controls.
   Instead, we know that farmers can return to prosperity if we
will take a few basic steps. We want to open markets abroad. We
will not use food as a foreign policy weapon.
   We want to find new uses for farm products. And Vice President
Bush has taken the lead here with his strong advocacy of
alternative fuels like ethanol.
   And we want to keep our rural communities strong through the
increased efforts at economic development. As a governor of a farm
state, I know that the future of American farming will be secure
with George Bush as president.
   Michael Dukakis, Michael Dukakis knows so little about
agriculture that he told the farmers of Iowa that they ought to try
growing Belgian endive.
   Fellow Republicans, our platform presents a vision of America, a
vision that is optimistic and bold and daring. It reflects our
pride in what we have done and our competence in what we will do.
   The Democrats missed their chance to level with the American
people. We didn't and George Bush and Dan Quayle will lead our
party to victory in November.

   Sen. Dan Quayle lists more than $250,000 in
stock in a family-controlled newspaper group as his only
substantial asset, but the figure could be higher because of the
vagueness of congressional financial disclosure forms.
   The Indiana senator, picked by George Bush on Tuesday to be his
vice presidential running mate, listed the stock, and other
holdings, on the forms filled out by all senators and House members
earlier this year.
   The filing requirements are such that ``more than $250,000''
could mean several millions dollars worth of stock in Central
Newspapers, Inc., in Indianapolis. In fact, Quayle's holdings are
rumored to be worth far more than that, but the $250,000-plus
category is the largest used for listing assets on the disclosure
forms.
   Too, the ``more than $250,000'' figure is book value, which
often vastly understates the actual worth of stock.
   Central Newspapers is the group with which the Indianapolis Star
and Indianapolis News are affiliated. Quayle's grandfather, Eugene
Pulliam, was publisher of those dailies, as well as the Arizona
Republic and the Phoenix Gazette.
   Quayle's wife owns another block of Central stock with a book
value of $100,000 to $250,000.
   Except for the stock in Central Newspapers, Quayle's only
holdings last year were two retirement accounts totaling a maximum
of $65,000; a bank account worth up to $15,000, and an account in
the House of Representatives credit union of $1,000 to $5,000.
   Quayle still holds the title of vice president and associate
publisher of his hometown paper, the family-run Huntington (Ind.)
Herald-Press. That paper's owner, Huntington Newspapers, Inc., paid
him $2,625 in director's fees last year, he reported.
   He listed three growth-fund accounts in the names of his
children, totaling up to $45,000, and a bank account in the
children's name worth between $1,000 and $5,000.
   Quayle was paid almost $50,000 last year for giving speeches to
a variety of contributors, ranging from the Anheuser-Busch
breweries to the International Ice Cream Association.
   The Indiana senator wrote several articles for pay, including
two for $40 apiece that he sold to the Indianapolis papers. He
wrote a $1,000 article for the Army & Navy Journal in Washington.
   Quayle reported receiving honoraria totaling $49,255 for
speeches and writings. To meet Senate limitations, he donated
$14,302 of that sum to charity.
   Quayle is a member of the Senate Budget, Armed Services and
Labor and Human Resources committees. Several of his paid speeches
were to groups with a direct interest in the work of those
committees _ a common practice among members of Congress.
   For example, on March 18, 1987, he was paid $2,000 apiece for
speeches to the National Committee for Quality Health Care,
headquartered in Washington, and Voluntary Hospitals of America,
Inc., in Irving, Texas. General Electric Co., a prime defense
contractor, paid him $2,000 for a speech on April 9.
   Quayle, an avid golfer, listed among his income last year a $250
trophy for participating in the Monterey Peninsula golf tournament.
His gifts included less than $200 worth of golf apparel for himself
and Mrs. Quayle for participating in the Pebble Beach National
Pro-Am tournament, and $288 worth of golf merchandise from the
Kemper Open in Potomac, Md.
   The most expensive gift received by Quayle was more golf
merchandise _ from Indiana pro Fuzzy Zoeller.
   Quayle and his wife were reimbursed by AT&T, a sponsor of the
Monterey tournament, for a round-trip flight to the California
tournament. He also listed reimbursements for travel to charity
skiing competitions in Utah and Idaho, and from the U.S. Telephone
Association, Abbott Laboratories, Electronic Industries Association
and the Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association for trips to
Phoenix, Ariz.; Waukegan, Ill.; Ft. Myers, Fla., and White Sulphur
Springs, W.Va.
   The Quayles' only liability listed on the financial disclosure
form was a 30-year, 5-percent note that Mrs. Quayle signed in 1975
to borrow up to $50,000 from Huntington Newspapers, Inc.
   A majority of the estate of Eugene C. Pulliam was put into a
trust that will remain in effect beyond the death of Pulliam's 10
grandchildren, including Quayle, a source close to the Pulliam
family told The Associated Press.
   The minority interest in Central Newspapers, the privately held
Pulliam family company, is divided among the late publisher's three
children and other stock owners. Central Newspapers announced
earlier this year that it planned a public stock offering but that
was later delayed.
   Quayle and his wife, Marilyn, own stock in the company.
Financial disclosure forms required of all members of Congress put
the value of his holdings at more than $250,000 and Mrs. Quayle's
holdings at between $100,000 and $250,000.
   Asked Monday if he was wealthy, Quayle claimed his principal
source of income is his Senate salary.
   Because the Pulliam company is privately owned, the value of its
assets aren't disclosed.
   Last year, Forbes magazine reported Eugene S. Pulliam, publisher
of the Indianapolis Star and News, was worth $650 million.
   He disputed that report, saying that Forbes mistakenly
considered him the owner of Central Newspapers when, in fact, he is
a minority stockholder.
   ``Their estimate of my wealth is ridiculous,'' said Pulliam.

<HEAD>Judge Rules Against Five Plaintiffs in Bitter Will Dispute</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LAS VEGAS, Nev. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A judge Tuesday refused to remove a
Beverly Hills attorney as executor of Liberace's estate, rejecting
the charges of the entertainer's sister and four associates that
the lawyer had looted the estate.
   State District Judge Michael Wendell issued the ruling in the
bitter, costly lawsuit after hearing four hours of closing
arguments from lawyers representing the executor, Joel Strote, and
the plaintiffs.
   Strote was named as executor of the estate and head of the
Liberace Foundation in a will signed 13 days before the
entertainer's death on Feb. 4, 1987, of complications from AIDS.
   The plaintiffs _ Liberace's 74-year-old sister Angie, his
housekeepers Dorothy McMahon and Gladys Luckie, longtime manager
Seymour Heller, and Cary James, his companion in the last six years
of his life _ argued that Liberace was not competent to understand
the will because of his illness.
   Strote countered that the five were just trying to squeeze more
money out of the state.
   Wendell is to rule later on who will pay the legal fees,
expected to run into the six figures. Defense attorneys have asked
that the costs be paid by the plaintiffs, including Angie Liberace,
who was left $594,000.
   In his closing argument, defense attorney John O'Reilly said
that Strote had taken the Liberace foundation, with $100,000 in
assets at the time of the entertainer's death, and turned it into
an $18 million entity through shrewd management.
   O'Reilly said the Liberace Foundation for the Performing Arts
had been a longtime dream of the flamboyant pianist. The foundation
was formed in 1979 to provide art and music scholarships at 30
colleges and universities.
   ``Mr. Liberace, as a dreamer, will have that dream live on
forever,'' O'Reilly said.
   However, Harold Gewerter, the plaintiffs' attorney, argued that
Strote had created a ``web of conflicts and deceit'' in getting
Liberace to put him in charge of the estate. He noted American Bar
Association standards say a lawyer should not consciously urge a
client to name him as executor of an estate.
   ``Joel Strote has become the largest single beneficiary of the
Liberace estate,'' Gewerter contended. He said the attorney had
been paid $500,000 in legal fees and was making $250 an hour
sitting through the lengthy court proceedings.
   He charged that Stote's actions were ``tantamount to robbing
from a dead man,'' and said that his clients were not interested in
getting more money out of the estate, but in removing Strote and
recovering the money he has received in legal fees.
   O'Reilly countered that the five plaintiffs in the case had
become accustomed to the good life while Liberace was alive, and
wanted more out of the estate after his death, although each had
been given more in the will drafted by Strote than in previous
wills.
   ``Liberace dreamed a dream, then made it become a reality,''
O'Reilly said. ``The plaintiffs lived a dream but can't face
reality. It's been said man must pay the fiddler. Liberace chose to
subsidize a whole symphony orchestra. Now they're saying `Just give
us control.'''
   ``Liberace signed that will knowing full well what he was
signing,'' O'Reilly said. ``He gave the plaintiffs more benefits
than they had before. But that was not good enough. They want
control; control they never had in his lifetime. They lived a
Shangri-la environment and they don't want to lose it.''
   O'Reilly said Strote's efforts had netted the Liberace
Foundation nearly $2 million from an auction of the entertainer's
memorabilia earlier this year, $1 million more than could have been
realized if the items had been sold wholesale.
   And he said Strote had been able to get an extra $500,000 out of
Liberace's Los Angeles properties because of his tenacity at the
bargaining table.

<HEAD>Young Indiana Senator Was Bush's `First Choice, Only Choice'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DONALD M. ROTHBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Political Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW ORLEANS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sen. Dan Quayle could hardly contain himself
Tuesday as he listened to George Bush describe him as ``a dynamic
young leader for the future.'' The youthful senator bounced up and
down on his toes as he exulted in the spotlight many had hoped
would settle on them.
   Only hours before, Quayle and his wife, Marilyn, had been trying
to arrange a tennis game.
   He also was scheduled to appear at a reception in his honor
given by the Indiana delegation. He didn't show up, but no one
minded. He suddenly found himself with more important business.
   The call came from Bush a few minutes after 2 o'clock.
   The Republican presidential nominee-to-be told the 41-year-old
Indiana senator he had made his decision on a running mate. Others
received similar calls from Bush, but he told them they were not
his choice.
   According to Bush aide Sheila Tate, the vice president told
Quayle that ``he was his first choice, his only choice.''
   Less than two hours later, they were standing together on the
shore of the Mississippi River, Bush in short sleeves amd no tie,
Quayle in a dark suit and red tie.
   Taking his cue from Bush on the steamy day, Quayle doffed his
coat, momentarily struggling to pull his arms out of the sleeves.
   But then he hit his stride, his right hand chopping the air in a
gesture reminiscent of John F. Kennedy.
   ``George Bush's America believes and has the commitment to the
American family that is so important to all of us,'' he said, his
voice rising to a shout. ``George Bush's America understands the
problems that confront us and can lead us to the future and the
21st century.''
   With Quayle as he stood on the platform were his wife and their
three children, the oldest 14.
   Bush reached Quayle at his New Orleans hotel. The senator is not
a delegate. He said last week he was attending the convention only
as a vice presidential prospect.
   But as the time dragged on and the speculation continued, he and
wife began to express some doubts.
   ``The total lack of privacy is going to be the biggest minus,''
said Mrs. Quayle, an attorney. ``You know you can't just jump in
the car and go to the store to buy a kid's swimsuit to replace the
one with the hole in it.''
   ``From a personal standpoint, if I had a time in my life to be
vice president, I wouldn't choose this time,'' Quayle told Indiana
reporters.
   But at the same time, the senator said, ``If he (Bush) makes the
decision, I'll be there with bells on.''
   A Robert Redford look-alike, Quayle was described by fellow Sen.
John McCain of Arizona as ``extremely telegenic in this day of
television and images.''
   Charles Black, a Bush adviser, said Quayle was viewed as someone
with ``appeal to baby-boom voters'' and an asset in the Midwest
where Bush did poorly in several primaries.

<TEXT>
   Two young Americans emerged from more
than 10 months of captivity in the Amazon jungle and told a news
conference on Tuesday that they were well treated by their leftist
guerrilla kidnappers.
   Stephen Koneman, 22, and Jason McLachan, 21, both of Chicago,
appeared before reporters at the U.S. Embassy following their
release on Sunday.
   In taped remarks broadcast earlier Tuesday, Koneman said he and
McLachan were in a canoe in the Amazon last October when they were
captured by the Colombian Revolutionary Armed Forces, a leftist
rebel group.
   Koneman said he and McLachan, friends since high school, are
geographers, but that apparently the guerrillas thought they were
CIA agents.
   ``They always treated us well, although they had their
suspicions about what kind of work we were doing. But talking with
them we wiped out their doubts and they saw that we were innocent.''
   The two men were released on Sunday to Bishop Jose Luis Serna
Alzate in southern Caqueta state, the U.S. Embassy said Tuesday in
a news release.
   ``They (the guerrillas) told us that we should stay calm and
that nothing was going to happen to us,'' Koneman said in Spanish
when interviewed by the Colombian radio chain RCN.
   The two young men left last June on what was intended to be a
six-month trip through Latin America.
   Both were senior students in geography, Koneman at the
University of Wisconsin-Madison and McLachan at Columbia University
in New York.
   In a statement Koneman read on behalf of himself and McLachan at
the news conference, Koneman said they were captured Oct. 4, and
not Oct. 8 as reported on the radio earlier in the day.
   Professor Thomas Yuill, a University of Wisconsin-Madison
researcher who frequently travels to Colombia, said following their
abduction that the area where the men disappeared was ``a pretty
inhospitable place, with yellow fever, political guerrilla camps,
drug camps and a river that has a strong current, waterfalls and
piranhas.''
   Koneman said at the news conference:
   ``For the last 10{ months, we lived with a group of guerrillas
at various camps in the jungle. Throughout the ordeal, we were
treated well, eating the same food as our captors and living in the
same kinds of shelters.
   ``We were provided with books, writing material and a chess set
to pass the time.
   ``We suffered no serious health problems and are currently in
fine health as the doctor here at the embassy confirmed today.
   ``We wrote several letters, but had no way of knowing whether or
not they were being delivered.
   ``In the final weeks, we marched toward the northwest through
the jungles.
   ``During this time an FARC (Spanish acronym for Colombian
Revolutionary Armed Forces) commander assured us the FARC was
working toward our release, but would not specify what was being
done.
   ``We took this news with some skepticism, and remained hopeful
the ordeal would end well.''
   Koneman said he and McLachan were delivered to Bishop Serne
Alzate ``who underwent considerable risk on our behalf.''
   He said the guerrilla organization's decision to release them
was ``on humanitarian grounds and no ransom was paid.''
   Koneman, apparently refering to embassy warnings against making
the jungle journey in the first place, said: ``We of course owe our
most profound thanks and our humble apologies to everyone.''
   He ended by saying, ``We will be traveling home in the next few
days to be united with our families and friends in the United
States.''
   According to newspaper files in Madison, the two men said in a
letter dated Sept. 22 that they were planning to canoe down the
Putumayo River, which divides Colombia and Peru.
   Chicago television station WLS said Tuesday that a letter sent
by the two in May reached their parents in July, raising hopes then
that they were still alive.

   The implicit message in George Bush's
campaign has been that he will deliver Reaganism without the hard
edges.
   The vice president has proposed bigger increases in education
spending than Democrat Michael Dukakis, he's been campaigning in
day care centers as well as defense plants, and he's called for a
moratorium on drilling for oil off the California coast.
   Bush, who will be receive his party's presidential nomination
Wednesday, has emphasized his unswerving opposition to higher
taxes. He even wants to cut taxes on capital gains.
   He is running on his experience in foreign affairs, from his
days as United Nations ambassador, envoy to China and director of
central intelligence to his globe-trotting duties of the past seven
years as a stand-in for President Reagan.

   Even before George Bush announced his choice
of a running mate, aides were preparing to craft the words the
mystery person will say while accepting the nomination.
   Speechwriters planned to write a ``generic'' speech that would
be tailored at the last minute to fit the running mate, along with
similar speeches to place that name in nomination.
   The name can be filled in later.
   Fred Malek, Bush's convention manager, said the draft speeches
would set out broad themes the campaign wants to stress on the
convention's closing night, with the running mate to polish the
language later.
   ``By Wednesday morning ... we will have one or two writers
working on a generic kind of acceptance speech which the nominee
would then have to take and modify and put into his or her own
style of words,'' said Malek.

   Biblical film epics were once a staple of
Hollywood's success formula, but in recent years they haven't had a
prayer at the box office.
   So judging from the phenomenal start of ``The Last Temptation of
Christ,'' the controversy surrounding the film looks like manna
from heaven for Universal Pictures.
   Straightforward religious films, like Westerns, are failing to
attract the viewers they did in the days of Cecil B. DeMille's
``The Ten Commandments,'' William Wyler's ``Ben Hur'' and George
Stevens' ``The Greatest Story Ever Told.'' They garnered huge
audiences in the 1950s and early '60s.
   In 1985, ``King David,'' a big-budget saga starring Richard
Gere, bombed. Two years later, ``The Mission,'' featuring Robert
DeNiro and themes strongly endorsed by Christian leaders, also
flopped.
   But director Martin Scorsese's ``Last Temptation,'' denounced as
blasphemous by some Christian leaders, opened to packed houses last
weekend. It played in seven U.S. cities and two in Canada, taking
in $44,579 per screen for a three-day total of $401,211, a jubilant
Universal Pictures reported.

   AIDS would rank as the 15th leading cause of
death in the United States if it were counted as a separate
category, according to new figures from the National Center for
Health Statistics.
   Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome killed between 12,450 and
13,820 Americans last year, the center estimated in its first
annual summary including separate figures for the disease.
   While AIDS has not yet been added to the rankings of major
causes of death published by the agency, the 1987 toll would have
placed it 15th on the list, ahead of birth defects, the agency
noted.
   The center's annual summary of vital statistics also disclosed

   Civil rights leaders claimed victory but
said they would press a $1 million lawsuit against the city even
though the police chief rescinded an order to randomly stop black
teen-agers in a mixed neighborhood.
   Police Chief Martin Felker withdrew the order Monday after
separate meetings with City Manager Philip Hawkey; LeRoy Williams,
president of the Toledo chapter of the National Association for the
Advancement of Colored People; and residents of the Old West End
neighborhood.
   ``The procedure was implemented to address a series of crimes
that had been committed,'' Felker said. ``Unfortunately, the focus
of the directive has been perceived as racially motivated instead
of the intent of focusing on the suspects involved.''

   Someplace over Alabama or maybe Mississippi,
winging his way to the Republican National Convention, George Bush
unsheathed his Thursday night acceptance speech and rehearsed it
for his wife.
   ``She stayed awake for the whole thing,'' Bush said in
describing Tuesday's mid-air drama.
   For the whole thing! She stayed awake ``for the whole thing.''
   There he goes again. George Bush is raising expectations for his
convention-climax address. It is a pressure situation. He is no

   While Republicans sent a heavy-hitting
``truth squad'' to parry Democratic thrusts in Atlanta, there seems
to be only one prominent Democrat here aside from the natives _ and
she feels like ``meat among all the lions.''
   As a commentator for ABC's ``Good Morning America,'' Rep.
Patricia Schroeder's presence is unofficial and her manner is
amiable. But the Colorado Democrat is nevertheless getting in a few
zingers.
   Schroeder told viewers Tuesday morning that she wanted to
``stand up and cheer'' when President Reagan mistakenly told
convention-goers that ``facts are stupid things'' because ``I've
often thought a lot of speeches of his ... haven't been exactly
factual.''

   The U.S. trade deficit widened to $12.5
billion in June as imports hit an all-time high, the government
said Tuesday. Analysts said the report showed how far the country
still has to go in solving its trade problems.
   The gap between what America exports and what the country
imports surged by 28.5 percent in June, a major setback after three
consecutive monthly improvements.
   The Reagan administration sought to play down the significance
of the one-month surge, but Democratic presidential candidate
Michael Dukakis said the figures were evidence of the
administration's failed economic policies.
   Financial markets, which went into a tailspin the last time such
a disappointing trade report was released, took Tuesday's report
more or less in stride.
   While the dollar was hit by a wave of panic selling immediately
after the report was released, it soon steadied and regained much
of its lost ground.

   This summer's stifling temperatures threaten
to exact a higher death toll than the 1980 heat wave that killed an
estimated 15,000 Americans, an authority on health and the
environment said Tuesday.
   ``This will probably emerge as one of the largest natural
disasters of this century,'' said W. Moulton Avery, executive
director of the Center for Environmental Physiology in Washington.
   ``If I had in my hand right now the number of people that have
died this summer (from heat) it would be front-page news all over
the country, but I don't have that number,'' Avery said in a
telephone interview.
   That is because most heat-related deaths go unreported, being
blamed on heart attacks, stroke and other factors, said Avery,
whose non-profit center researches the effects of heat and cold on
humans for government agencies and other clients.

   National Science Foundation bases in
Antarctica are polluting the pristine polar environment in
violation of U.S. laws and international agreements, the
Environmental Defense Fund said Tuesday.
   ``The environmental practices of the NSF _ the federal agency
responsible for U.S. scientific research in Antarctica _ would not
be permitted anywhere in the United States,'' the group said in a
report.
   The findings by the organization, which frequently sues
polluters in this country, include disposal of untreated sewage in
Antarctic waters, open burning and ocean dumping of other wastes
and lack of emissions controls on diesel power generators.
   The report said McMurdo Sound, adjacent to the largest U.S.
installation, is more polluted than virtually any U.S. waterway and
that highly toxic polychlorinated bi-phenyls and heavy metals are
being found in the tissues of penguins and seals.

   The Red Army won't speed up its withdrawal from
Afghanistan because Moslem guerrillas there have rejected political

reversed previous official indications that all of the more than

   ``The situation in Afghanistan does not give grounds to

   Gerasimov indicated the Kremlin will stick to the timetable of
the U.N.-mediated agreement signed April 14 in Geneva. It directed
that the withdrawal begin May 15, with half the Soviet forces gone
by Aug. 15 and all removed from Afghanistan by Feb. 15, 1989.

   Bishop College, founded by freed slaves and once

been forced by bankruptcy to shut its doors after 108 years.
   ``We feel that it's a tragedy that a college that had such great
expertise in educating disadvantaged and minority students was not
able to survive because there was no money available,'' said
Harriet Schimel, vice president of communications for the United
Negro College Fund.
   The school's debts increased over the last few years and by
April 1987, when it filed for protection from its creditors under
Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy Code, it owed $12.6 million to
400 creditors.
   By Monday, when it filed for Chapter 7 proceedings, the figure
had grown to $20 million; the school said it was unable to raise
the $1.85 million needed to keep it opened.
   Liquidation of the college's assets _ 21 buildings on 400 acres

   Radical students staging
anti-government protests have been criticized, heckled and even
attacked in recent days by furious citizens demanding an end to
violent clashes in their communities.
   Such public anger toward the radicals, who represent about 10
percent of South Korea's students, is rarely seen in a nation that
has been generally tolerant of student activism. It has shocked the
students, who see themselves as fighting on behalf of the very
people criticizing them.
   The rising resentment appears to reflect both anger over the
radicals' violent tactics and concern for the Olympics, which start
in Seoul on Sept. 17.
   South Koreans are worried that violent protests at the moment
when world attention is focused on Seoul could ruin the nation's
image. Most people see the Games as a coming of age, and they want
to impress the world with a major success.

the front and sides of the bandstand in sheets of bright blue

   The plastic remains on the bandstand, providing Daywalt some

   Martin Landau couldn't resist accepting the role
of the businessman Abe Karatz in Francis Ford Coppola's new film,
``Tucker.'' It was a part that caught his dreams.
   ``I saw the possibilities,'' he said. ``Too often, I'm cast in
things that are fairly one-dimensional.''
   Landau's career has been anything but one-dimensional. He
studied drama with Lee Strasberg, appeared in Paddy Chayevsky's
play, ``Middle of the Night,'' and starred in the long-running TV
series ``Mission: Impossible.'' Now he's emerged as a mature
character actor.
   He considers his work in ``Tucker'' something special.
   ``Tucker'' is based on the life of Preston Tucker, who designed
an innovative automobile, ``The Car of Tomorrow _ Today,'' after
World War II. The major car makers realized that the car was far
ahead of it's time and conspired to make sure it never went into
mass production because it would force them to start manufacturing
autos with the same safety and productions values.
   Abe Karatz was an elderly New York businessman who helped raise
financial backing for Tucker's project. However, when the two first
met, Karatz scoffed at the idea of the new car.
   ``I really wanted you to feel that there was no possible place
to go after that first encounter,'' Landau said. ``If you tell me
your biggest dream and I laugh at you, that's the biggest insult in
the world.''
   Karatz's cynicism eventually breaks down.
   ``Feelings he hasn't touched in years he starts to touch,''
Landau said. ``Attachment, love and the ability to dream again is
given him. Everyone dreams when they're kids. Abe lost that. Tucker
gives it back to him.''
   The real Karatz was a private man, rarely photographed or
written about. Landau had to create much of the character by using
his own instincts.
   ``I drew Abe the first couple of days,'' said the actor, once an
illustrator for the New York Daily News. ``I saw this lonely New
York businessman who really has no family, no friends and no life
outside of work.''
   Fans of Landau will have to look hard to recognize him in
``Tucker.'' He wears a mustache in the film and walks hunched over,
his head sticking out in front of his body. In reality, Landau is
tall, clean-shaven and animated.
   ``I wanted Abe to be older than I am and shorter than I am.
Every day I got a little older in rehearsal and a little shorter.
I'm almost 6-3 and I figure Abe is about 5-10.''
   Portraying Karatz reminded Landau of the men he knew while
growing up in Brooklyn in the 1940s.
   ``When I stood in front of the mirror the first time _ when I
saw Abe coagulate _ I saw my father, his friends, the uncles when I
was young looking up at these guys,'' he said.
   Landau credits Coppola (``The Godfather,'' ``Apocalypse Now'')
with giving him the freedom to develop his character.
   ``Like all the good ones, he lets you go. He hires you, that's a
vote of confidence,'' Landau said. ``Francis really creates a
playground for you. The more you bring the happier he is.''
   Tucker represents America's postwar optimism: sharply dressed,
endlessly promoting, believing in a better world. Karatz is a
product of the Depression. He gives off the impression of someone
who has lived a hard life, doubting it will ever change.
   ``He's a guy that just misses being elegant,'' Landau observed.
``The suit is an expensive suit, it just doesn't work exactly. He
just misses being everything he wants.''
   The theme of ``Tucker,'' one man against the ``system,'' recalls
the films of Frank Capra and Preston Sturges. Landau agrees that
``Tucker'' shows the influence of those directors, especially
Sturges.
   ``In the middle of a serious scene (in a Sturges film), you'd
see a pratfall and it's OK. Francis would allude to Preston
Sturges. I think it's a Capra type of story with a Sturges style. I
liked that. Some choices were based on that feeling.''
   Landau has taught acting for over 30 years. His students have
included James Dean, Jack Nicholson, Harry Dean Stanton and Warren
Oates. However, he downplays his own role in others' careers.
   ``You don't teach acting. What you're doing, is saying you're an
instrument. I helped them find stuff that was in their very being
that they were not utilizing,'' he said.
   Acting comes down to a simple formula: ``It's laughing at the
same joke everytime as if you'd heard it for the first time. If you
can do that, you don't have to work with me. The audience wants to
believe that what's going on has never happened before.''
   But to be a really good actor, something special is required.
   ``Anyone can walk and talk, that's easy,'' Landau said.
``There's not an actor in the world that wants to be bad. If you
could create magic, that's what it's all about. The beauty of the
theater or film is having a thousand people in the single room
having the exact same experience. It means we're all the same.''

<HEAD>Sesame Characters Begin 20th Season</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KATHRYN BAKER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The 20th season of PBS' ``Sesame Street,''
beginning this November, will lead up to the birth of a baby for
Maria and Luis, two of the characters who married last season.
   This season will also mark the 20th anniversary of two of the
show's charter cast members _ singer-actor Bob McGrath and Caroll
Spinney, the man inside Big Bird.
   They recalled their beginnings on the now historic PBS
children's series at a recent news conference.
   ``When I first heard about it, I didn't think I wanted to be
involved with a new children's show, because there was nothing that
exciting in terms of children's shows at that point,'' said
McGrath, who had been featured on the Mitch Miller show and joined
``Sesame Street'' in 1969. ``But when I saw some of the film and
animation that Jim Henson and some of the other people had done, I
knew this was really something quite out of the ordinary from what
had been on television before.''
   The producers of the show expect to add new graphics and use
more films, including ones by director Jonathan Demme and
photographer-artist William Wegman, this season, a likely response
to the trend toward multimedia kids' shows like ``Pee-wee's
Playhouse.''
   Guest stars will include Lily Tomlin, Tracey Ullman, Susan St.
James, Rhea Perlman and James Galway, among others.
   One of the major episodes last season was the wedding of
characters Luis and Maria. This season's finale will be the birth
of their baby. the producers hope to see the baby grow up on the
show. Producer-director Lisa Simon said a search is on for
expectant parents who would be willing to let the show follow their
child's growth.
   Big Bird has become the show's biggest star, but he didn't start
out that way, said Spinney.
   A peripheral character in the early episodes, he was sort of
``the village idiot,'' Spinney said.
   ``One day, I realized he was really a child,'' said Spinney.
``One of the scripts said he had to go to day care or something. So
I said, we really should play him as a child.''
   Big Bird came to embody ``all the fears of children and things
they have to learn _ a wide-eyed view of the world,'' said Spinney.
`He gradually learned to read and write and so he grew from 4,
which I felt he was the beginning, to 6{, which is where he stays.''
   Spinney carefully protects Big Bird's real identity from little
children, but admits when he sees a child toting one of the big
yellow dolls, ``I keep wanting to say, you know, (he goes into Big
Bird's high voice) `Hey, I do that!'''
   Spinney had been into puppeting since he was a child. McGrath
had intended to have a career entertaining adults as a singer, but
when rock music began to take over the business, he decided he
would have to take another path.
   Both men said the rewards of working for children are great,
though the task is sometimes exasperating.
   McGrath does a lot of concerts and benefits as his ``Sesame
Street'' character. Children, he said, ``are a wonderful audience.
First of all, they're very, very honest. I had a little girl in
Vancouver some years ago. I was shaking hands after a concert. She
had me lean over to her and said (he drops to a stage whisper),
`You know something, Bob?' And I said, `No, what?' `Up close, you
don't look too good.'''
   McGrath at least can appear as himself to children, though he is
careful when they're around. ``I don't walk on red,'' for instance,
he said.
   Spinney has to be incognito, though he does have some fun. When
he heard a mother call her child by name as the girl was examining
a bunch of talking Big Bird dolls in a toy department, ``I bent
down near one and said, `Hello, Jessica. How are you? Isn't it a
nice day?' The mother says, `Those toys are remarkable! It even
calls my child by name!'''
   ``I don't do that very often. Usually I'm a nice guy,'' Spinney
said.
   When children visit the set they inevitably will see the man get
out of the bird suit at some point. But ``most of them will
continue to talk to the puppet even though you're standing there
holding it,'' Spinney said.
   Spinney also does Oscar the Grouch. On the way to a meeting with
Henson to discuss the character, including what kind of voice it
would have, a gruff New York cabbie barked, ``Where to, Mac?'' and
a star was born.
   ``I don't know who that cabbie was, but I'd like to thank him,''
Spinney said.
   Not all the characters have worked out, said Simon. Sam the
Robot was canned. ``Professor Hastings was a puppet that fell
asleep as he talked. So did the kids,'' she said. Dina's
high-pitched voice ``drove parents from the room.'' A blind puppet
didn't work. Professor D. Rabbit was a full-size juggling puppet
that ``looked hideous,'' she added.

spinoff ``A Different World,'' but back home on ``The Cosby Show''
where television's No. 1-rated dad will have to deal with a college
dropout daughter. Bonet is expecting a baby in real life but that
won't be written into the show. NBC hopes she'll do six or seven
``Cosbys,'' then return late in the season to rejoin ``A Different
World.'' The rest of Denise's college friends will carry on without
her in the early part of the season.

<TEXT>
   Ordinary folks always have had difficulty
following the logic of applied economics, but activities of late
have a good many of them standing on their heads.
   It is a time in which growth is said to endanger the general
economic welfare, when job creation is declared inimical to the
best interests of the nation and when busy factories are viewed
with suspicion.
   Higher interest rates are praised because they make it harder to
borrow, helping to supress the All-American urge to buy houses.
Inflation, though mouse-sized, is said to have the destructive
potential of an enraged elephant.
   The explanation for this peculiar economic attitude is likely to
be even more puzzling, but the one common denominator fitting all
the above is the widespread view that inflation is now the biggest
threat to world stability.
   That view seems to be shared by heads of most central banks in
the industrialized world, since they have been raising short-term
rates in recent weeks. And in a global economy, one nation's move
provokes another's.
   Inherent in fears of inflation, no matter in what nation it
occurs, is the assumption that any economy can run amok if not
reined in. In this view, economies are machines that, if run too
fast, can burn themselves out.
   Therefore, ``good news,'' such as rising employment and greater
industrial activity, is indeed good news _ but only to a limit.
That limit is reached when the good news strains the machinery,
producing the smoke of inflation.
   As always, economists now disagree on whether they see smoke. In
fact, the ``growth is good'' school has not given up, contending
that the way to overcome inflation and other economic threats is to
oil the machine and go even faster.
   More jobs, for example, can mean more income, less debt, greater
savings. More jobs can mean more government revenues, thus helping
reduce the federal deficit and myriad social problems. More
spending by business could mean bigger, more productive factories,
reducing the chances of economic burnout.
   There appears to be no universal, fixed attitude toward any of
these economic elements. Job creation is sometimes viewed as
healthy; at other times, a threat. Capital spending often is viewed
as anti-inflationary; at other times it is seen as a threat to
economic stability.
   The various elements that make up the big economic machine move
in relation to each other. Sometimes an element is seen as overly
loose and in need of tightening; at other times, it is viewed as
tight and out of synchronization.
   Many people will recall, for instance, that it was universally
agreed a year ago that the United States would have to export more
manufactured goods if it were to lower its imbalance of payments.
It was considered imperative.
   Now that U.S. factories are turning out manufactured goods for
export the warning is heard: The United States does not have enough
workers and capacity to serve both the domestic and overseas
markets without courting inflation.
   Perhaps overly simplified, it comes down to a question of
choice: Is it better to slow output to accommodate the limited
capacity of the machinery? Or would it be a better resolution to
build a bigger, better machine?
   Right now, the ``growth is bad'' school has the upper hand,
mainly because it counts as members several of the world's central
bank heads, including Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal
Reserve Board.

   After 19 years of painstaking effort, workers
are only now making headway in repairing the damage caused when an
Australian sheep shearer set fire to Al Aqsa mosque, one of Islam's
holiest monuments.
   Precarious wooden scaffolding towers into the dome. Laborers are
still cleaning fire-blackened stone behind the pulpit while skilled
craftsmen are carefully reconstructing mosaic panels with
inscriptions from the Koran, Islam's holy book.
   Isam Awad, the Palestinian engineer in charge of the project,
blames lost skills and modern politics for the slowness of the work.
   ``The fire damaged some of the oldest parts of the mosque.
Suddenly, we had to work with gypsum, mosaics, stucco and lead. All
these were lost skills, and we had to find people who knew and
relearn them,'' said Awad, who supervises a team of 40 workers.
   Al Aqsa, which marks the place where the Prophet Mohammed
ascended to heaven to receive the word of God, was built in the 7th
century after the Caliph Omar conquered Jerusalem. It is considered
Islam's third holiest site after Mecca and Medina.
   The 36-acre site known in Arabic as the Haram Al Sharif (Noble
Enclosure), was originally the site of the Jewish Temple, built by
King Herod and destroyed by the Roman Tenth Legion in 70 A.D.
   Awad said the renovations for the mosque and the nearby Dome of
the Rock have been slowed by the Arab-Israeli conflict. ``We have
to be careful because of politics.''
   Awad added that the recent decision of Jordan's King Hussein to
sever ties with the West Bank put question marks on whether money
would still be available for the restoration. He said more than
$1.5 million had been spent so far on fixing damage from the fire.
   Awad said repeated strikes and boycotts by Palestinians
protesting Israeli occupation on the West Bank made it impossible
to complete the change from the mosque's gold-tinted aluminum dome
to a new a reddish-hued copper top before rains start in September.
   Perhaps the greatest loss in the fire, which took hours to put
out, was a carved wooden ``mindab,'' or pulpit, presented to the
mosque by Saladin, the Moslem warrior who defeated the Christian
Crusaders in the 11th century A.D.
   Replacing the pulpit requires special woodworking skills
unavailable locally. A number of countries are vying for the honor
of carrying out the work, but choosing one country over the other
is proving to be a delicate political exercise.
   Officials of the Waqf, the Jordanian-funded Moslem trust that
oversees the Al Aqsa complex, said Turkey or Egypt would probably
be awarded the job of reconstructing the pulpit.
   On April 21, 1969, Moslem guards spotted flames coming from Al
Aqsa. The fire burned out of control for hours with flames reaching
the windows just below the dome.
   Israeli authorities arrested Michael Denis William Rohen, a tall
blond sheep-shearer from Sydney, Australia, who belonged to the
Protestant Church of God sect. He was judged insane and deported to
Australia.
   Hassan Tahboub, a member of the Moslem Supreme Council in
Jerusalem, questions whether the act was the work of a deranged
individual.
   He said Moslem investigators believed a group may have been
involved because Rohen called London the night before the attack
and may have received instructions. But Tahboub added, ``We refused
to give evidence to the Israelis because we considered the court to
be illegal.''
   Much of the fire damage has now been repaired, including about
75 feet of Fatamid-style mosaics, 750 square feet of gypsum
moldings, 30 new stain glass windows and new marble columns.
   The most painstaking work is being done by Adel Jabari, 38, who
said it took two months to place the 20,000 pieces of glass and
stone in each square meter (10.76 square feet) of mosaic.
   Some of his work represents new designs inspired by Jabari's
stay in Italy, where he was sent to study restoration methods and
became enthused with the Sistine Chapel in Rome.
   ``I was inspired by the spirit of Michelangelo,'' said Jabari.
   Cleaning fire-blackened stone and mosaic panels behind the
pulpit, restoring some decorations in the Al Aqsa dome's interior
and building a new pulpit remain to be done.
   Awad declines to predict when work will be complete, noting the
mission has expanded to include other repairs needed because of age
and neglect.
   ``It is a lifetime job,'' he said.

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ For 16 days they held out against the Japanese
invasion force, some 1,200 civilians fighting alongside 449
Marines, 68 sailors and six Army Air Corps men. All were either
killed or captured when Wake Island fell on Dec. 23, 1941. A
momument to the military men was erected shortly after the war, but
it was not until this summer that the civilian defenders got their
monument. Many returned to Wake Island for the dedication, some for
the first time since the war.

<DATELINE>WAKE ISLAND AIRFIELD, Wake Island (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Palm trees and
evergreens grow where once there was only ironwood brush. The
once-countless rats and gooney birds are gone, the coral runway has
been replaced.
   ``It's strange, everything looks so different that walking
around here, looking at the monuments and the old rusted-out guns,
it's almost like looking at someone else's life, like it never
happened to me,'' says Darwin Dodds of Denver, a retired radio and
television broadcaster.
   Dodds was a 22-year-old civilian construction worker captured
when the Japanese invaded this remote tropical atoll in late 1941.
He was one of the defenders of Wake Island who recently returned
for a dedication of a monument in honor of the civilians who fought
alongside the soldiers, sailors and Marines, all of whom were
either killed or captured.
   A memorial to the Marines was erected shortly after the war. But
the civilians _ including construction workers building military
installations and others who worked for Pan American Airways _ got
little credit. It was 1981 before they were deemed eligible for
veterans' benefits, and for 47 years there was no official monument
to them.
   The dedication ceremony drew 42 civilian defenders, 14 military
men, and about about 100 family members. For many of them, the
reunion June 13-16 was their first visit to the island since the
war.
   Ival Dale Milbourn, 64, a retired construction contractor who
lives in Santa Rosa, Calif., still has occasional nightmares about
his war experiences. By bringing his wife, two sons and his
85-year-old father to the reunion, he hoped to put some of the old
ghosts to rest.
   ``This has been a 47-year-dream,'' Milbourn said as he looked
over the post he manned on the day of the first attack on Dec. 8,
1941. ``I just can't explain how I feel, but by having my family
here I feel like they understand why I'm the way I am, why I did
the things I did.''
   Milbourn was 18 years old and a private in the U.S. Marine Corps
when he landed on Wake in late 1941. He still recalls the details
of that first attack, only hours after the Japanese struck Pearl
Harbor. Wake is west of the International Dateline, so it was the
next day there.
   ``We weren't prepared at all,'' says Milbourn, who manned a
3-inch anti-aircraft gun. ``We hadn't even filled the first
sandbag. We ran to our positions and trained right on those planes,
but we were expecting reinforcements and we thought they might be
our own guys.''
   The next 16 days were a blur of daily bombing raids, thwarted
invasions and close-fought battles.
   The outnumbered U.S. troops shot down 21 Japanese planes and
sank at least two destroyers with outmoded weapons salvaged from
warships from World War I. But with no reinforcements and little
ammunition, they surrendered to the Japanese on Dec. 23, 1941.
   The Marines were commanded by Maj. James P.S. Devereux, who was
acclaimed the ``hero of Wake Island.'' During the fighting he was
reported to have sent out the message, ``Send us more Japs.'' He
later denied the story.
   Devereux, who served as a congressman from Maryland after the
war, died Aug. 5 of pneumonia at age 85.
   ``We were among the last Marines to get the order to
surrender,'' Milbourn recalls, ``and when we were told to give up
our guns, well, that was the first time we ever told an NCO
(non-commissioned officer) `up your bucket' because we'd been told
the Japanese take no prisoners.''
   The Americans were ordered to strip and march down to the old
airstrip, where a ring of machine guns awaited. There they were
tied up and ordered to crouch in the middle of the circle.
   ``We were scared and praying and crying and everything else,''
Milbourn says. ``Then at the last minute, they took the guns down,
because they learned there were civilians among us.''
   The Americans _ 449 Marines, 68 sailors, six Army Air Corps men
and 1,200 civilians _ were left on the airstrip overnight, still
naked and tightly bound.
   The next day they were each given a small piece of bread and a
drink of gasoline-tainted water. It was Dec. 25, 1941.
   ``That was our Christmas dinner, and we had no idea how much
worse it would get,'' Milbourn recalls.
   Most of the prisoners were eventually transferred by boat to
prison camps in Shanghai and Japan. Several prisoners were beheaded
and all were poorly fed along the way. The Japanese kept 98
civilians on the island as slave labor.
   Roger ``Chick'' Bamford of Texarkana, Ark., lied about his age
to join the Marines when he was 15 years old, so he had not even
turned 20 when he was released from prison camp in September 1945,
after the Japanese surrender.
   ``I got the name `Chick' in boot camp because I was such a
kid,'' says Bamford. ``In prison camp the older guys looked out for
me, tried to get me food, because I was in my growing years.''
   Across the atoll, the survivors, many of whom hadn't seen each
other since they were liberated from prison camps, gathered in
little groups to compare experiences.
   They set off under the blazing tropical sun to find memorable
spots; the bunkers, the old landing strip, the mass grave where the
dead were laid to rest.
   ``That's what this trip is really about,'' said Walter Kennedy,
71, of Orange Cove., Calif., who as a 23-year-old Marine sergeant
was injured during the first attack.
   ``It's been nearly 50 years, and we're pretty old now, but it
was a heck of a fight and we still remember,'' adds Kennedy, who
made the Marine Corps his career. Seeing the guys who helped get
you through all those years in the prison camps, well, it just
makes you happy to be alive.''
   Of the Americans, 120 were killed in the fighting and 231 died
in captivity. The 98 civilians kept on Wake were executed on Oct.
7, 1943.
   They left behind a reminder of their plight: a large coral
boulder, painstakingly hand-carved with their initials and the
still-legible message that reads``98 US PW (for prisoners of war)
5-10-43.'' Five months later, they were machine-gunned on the beach
in retaliation for a devastating American air strike the day before.
   The memory of those civilians and how they died has haunted many
of the survivors.
   ``When I heard about this trip I thought I wasn't sure I wanted
to go, I didn't know what kind of memories it would bring,'' said
Oscar Ray, 67, now credit manager of a hospital in Boise, Idaho.
The execution of the civilians ``affected me so profoundly that I
couldn't sleep for weeks after hearing about it. I thought it was a
religious duty that I should come back.''

   U.S. industrial production shot up 0.8 percent
in July, the biggest increase in nine months, the government has
said in a report that intensified economists' worries about rising

   The Federal Reserve said Monday the large July advance was

heavy demand for electricity during the summer heat wave.

<HEAD>Rales Brothers Launch Hostile Tender Offer for Interco</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARIANN CAPRINO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The board of Interco Inc., target of a $2.69
billion hostile tender offer, likely will be hard-pressed to devise
a restructuring plan attractive enough to keep shareholders from
defecting, many analysts say.
   A Washington, D.C.-based investor group launched a $70-a-share
tender offer for the huge furniture and apparel company on Monday,
a week after Interco directors rejected the proposal as inadequate.
   The bid is the first big-time takeover attempt orchestrated by
the Rales brothers, who already have diverse manufacturing holdings
but seek a major foothold in the consumer products industry.
   ``Seventy dollars is a fair offer, and it's important that the
board give full consideration to fair offers,'' said Robert
Buchanan, an analyst at A.G. Edwards & Sons Inc. in St. Louis.
   ``It's going to be difficult to come up with a plan that would
be significantly more,'' he said.
   Robert Hedrick, a vice president at the investment firm Eppler,
Guerin & Turner Inc. in Dallas, said: ``The restructuring plan has
merit, but I'm afraid it can't compete with a tender offer.''
   Interco stock jumped $2.12{ a share to close at $72.12{ in heavy
trading Monday on the New York Stock Exchange, indicating investors
are waiting for a higher bid or measures by the company to support
the price.
   Hedrick said he has valued Interco conservatively at about $70 a
share, although some analysts have estimated Interco might be worth
up to $78 a share.
   The tender offer pressures the Interco board to speed up its
ongoing restructuring plan.
   In an effort to remain independent, Interco recently
strengthened its defenses against unwanted takeover bids and began
working on a plan that includes selling the company's flagging
apparel operations and paying shareholders a special dividend.
   Analysts said the St. Louis-based company's apparel operation,
which includes the well-known London Fog line, could fetch as much
as $800 million.
   The Rales brothers have indicated in Security and Exchange
Commission documents that they also would sell the unit, as well as
other operations, to raise capital for the buyout.
   The Rales brothers and their associates already own 8.7 percent
of Interco's 38.4 million common shares outstanding. The pricetag
on the shares they do not already own is about $2.47 billion.
   Susan Schepman, a spokeswoman for Interco, said the company had
no comment on the hostile tender offer.
   While Interco's apparel operations saw operating profits plunge
33 percent in the 1988 fiscal year as the retail industry slumped,
other operations have shown impressive growth. Operating profits
from Interco's footwear operations, which include the Converse and
Florsheim brands, jumped 77 percent over the previous fiscal year,
and operating profits from furniture jumped 21 percent, the company
said in its annual report.
   Interco reported revenue of about $3.34 billion last year. In
addition to its manufacturing operations, the company operates 201
home improvement centers, general merchandise discount stores,
men's specialty apparel shops and specialty department stores in 15
states.
   Interco already had been a strong force in the furniture
industry with its Ethan Allen and Broyhill lines, but the
acquisition of furniture maker Lane Co. more than a year ago
solidified its No. 1 position.
   Operating through Cardinal Acquisition Corp. and City Capital
Associates, Steven Rales, 37, and his brother, Mitchell, 31,
initially approached the Interco board with a $64-a-share takeover
bid. The group sweetened the offer to $70 a share but the Interco
board derided the bid as inadequate.
   An acquisition of Interco would give the Rales brothers their
long-sought goal of an established place in consumer products.
Cindy Carpenter, a spokeswoman for their acquisition group, said
the brothers expressed an interest in consumer products as long as
three years ago.
   But to date, the Rales' have confined their business interests
to machinery and other non-consumer goods. Among the prizes of
their acquisition efforts in recent years are Western Pacific
Industries Inc., Chicago Pneumatic Tool Co., Mohawk Rubber Co. and
Master Shield Inc.

   Domestic car and light truck sales continue to
outperform analysts' predictions, though Aug. 1-10 sales were 6.6
percent behind an incentive-fueled early August 1987 sales period.
   ``Sales in August and September last year were artificially
high,'' David Healy, analyst at Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. in New
York, said Monday.
   Combined sales of U.S.-made cars and light trucks totaled
277,952 for the nine selling days from Aug. 1-10, up from 264,588
in the comparable period last year, the automakers reported. There
were only eight selling days in the 1987 period, and on a daily
basis, sales were down 6.6 percent.
   Sales reached a 7.6 million seasonally adjusted annual rate, the
same as in the preceding 10-day period, from July 21-31.
   In early August 1987, buyer incentives aimed at clearing excess
cars from crowded dealer lots pushed the annualized sales rate
during the period to 8.4 million, compared with the year-long 1987
rate of 7.1 million.
   This year, the Big Three automakers' inventories are hovering
around a 60-day supply of vehicles, which the companies consider
ideal, and the fire-sale atmosphere is gone, said analyst Joseph
Phillippi at Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. in New York.
   Sales are relatively strong, Phillippi said, although compared
to last August, ``They are going to be rather lackluster because we
are comparing against an incentive period.''
   ``Consumer confidence is high, gasoline is cheap, it's a boomy
situation,'' said Drexel Burnham's Healy.
   General Motors Corp. sold 86,676 cars from Aug. 1-10, down from
91,582 in the early-August 1987 period that was boosted by a
cut-rate financing program, GM spokesman Karen Longridge said.
Daily sales were down 15.9 percent from the year-earlier period.
   Ford Motor Co. sold 52,239 cars, up from 49,402 a year earlier
but down 6 percent on a daily basis.
   Chrysler Corp. sold 24,167 cars, up from 17,568 a year earlier,
a 22.3 percent jump in daily sales.
   August 1987 sales were slowed by dealer shortages of compact
Omni and Horizon models after a plant conversion shutdown, Chrysler
spokesman Tom Houston said.
   GM sold 44,650 light trucks, up from 41,959 in the year-ago
period but down 5.4 percent in daily sales. Ford's sales of 33,943
light trucks were down from 34,414, a daily sales decline of 12.3
percent. Chrysler light truck sales of 19,156 topped 16,621 a year
earlier, a 2.4 percent increase.
   Honda Motor Co. Ltd. sold 9,531 U.S.-built cars, up from 8,421 a
year earlier and up 0.6 percent in daily sales. Nissan Motor Corp.
sales of 2,961 domestically built cars were up from 2,195 in the
1987 period, a 19.9 percent daily sales increase.
   Toyota Motor Corp. sold 862 U.S.-made cars, up from 568 a year
earlier. Mazda Motor Corp., which began domestic production last
September at Flat Rock, sold 709 U.S.-made cars.
   Sales of U.S.-made cars are reported every 10 days. Imported car
sales are reported at the end of each month.

<HEAD>South Korea Moving To Stem Insider Stock Trading</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The South Korean government will
computerize stock transactions of major individual and
institutional investors in a tough step to stem insider trading,
the Ministry of Finance said Tuesday.
   The ministry said it would establish an independent division
within the Securities Supervisory Board (SSB) responsible for
uncovering insider trading and making recommendations for legal
action.
   The move, aimed at protecting investors and strengthening
development of domestic financial markets, will take effect Sept. 1
after the necessary regulations are revised, a ministry spokesman
said.
   If found to have engaged in irregular trading practices,
violators will face legal punishment and firms committing
irregularities will be obliged to publish an apology in daily
newspapers, the ministry said.
   The SSB will use computerized data to list those with access to
inside knowledge, such as securities trading by insiders who are
director-class business officials, shareholders with more than 10
percent stakes, and other individuals and corporations with access
to inside information, the ministry said.
   The government also will order officials at securities-related
organizations to report signs of unfair trading to the SSB, the
ministry said.
   The Korea Stock Exchange automatically will start surveillance
of the market when stock prices and trade volume fluctuate suddenly
and notify the SSB of its opinion of the cause, the ministry said.
   The SSB will be authorized to trace the origin of unfair trading
funds in cooperation with the Office of Bank Supervision and
Examination and notify the Office of National Tax Administration of
the probe results, according to the ministry.
   The ministry will rewrite the related laws and decrees to
guarantee the rights of investors who have lost money through
unfair trading practices such as price manipulation.

<HEAD>Dollar and Gold Rise Ahead of June Trade Figures</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar rose slightly against most major
foreign currencies in quiet European trading this morning as the
market waited for the release of U.S. trade figures for June.
   Gold prices also were slightly higher.
   Foreign exchange dealers attributed the dollar's rise to some
last-minute dollar purchases by a few large banks ahead of the 8:30
a.m. EDT release of the trade report.
   ``The trade numbers will be the key in setting the trend of the
dollar,'' said one dealer in Rome.
   The dealer predicted that if the June deficit is similar or
larger than May's $10.93 billion gap, the dollar will slide. But if
the deficit is below $10 billion, the dollar will rise, though any
rise could be checked by central bank intervention.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day
begins, the dollar rose 0.13 yen to a closing 133.08 yen. Later, in
London, it was quoted higher at 133.43 yen.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning, compared with late Monday's
rates, included: 1.8840 West German marks, up from 1.8810; 1.5832
Swiss francs, up from 1.5780; 6.3935 French francs, up from 6.3780;
2.1265 Dutch guilders, up from 2.1257; 1,397.00 Italian lire, down
from 1,398.00; 1.2283 Canadian dollars, up from 1.2196.
   In London, the dollar rose against the British pound. It cost
$1.7115 to buy one pound, cheaper than $1.7145 late Monday.
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $432.30 a troy ounce and
at midmorning, the city's five major bullion dealers fixed a
recommended price of $432.00. Both were up from Monday's late bid
of $430.40.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $431.80, up from $431.00 late
Monday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold rose 41 cents to close at a bid
$434.21.
   Silver was quoted in London today at a bid price of $6.74 a troy
ounce, up from Monday's $6.72.

<HEAD>Dollar Up Slightly, Stocks Lower</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar edged up in Tokyo today while share
prices closed slightly lower in slow trading on the Tokyo Stock
Exchange.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues, which gained
67.78 points the previous day, shed 4.74 points, or 0.017 percent,
to close at 27,896.55.
   Volume on the first section was 260 million shares, slighly up
from Monday's 230 million shares, which was the lowest full-day
level this year.
   The exchange's main index earlier in the day reached a low of
27,780.62 but rebounded later to erase most of the losses and close
little changed.
   Securities dealers said the rebound was prompted in part by
traders taking positions in electricals ahead of the release of
U.S. trade figures for June later in the day in Washington.
   Declining issues outpaced advancers 500 to 330.
   The dollar opened at 133.20 yen, ranged between 133.00 yen and
133.27 yen before closing at 133.08 yen, up 0.13 yen.
   Spot trading totaled $3.1420 billion, down from Monday's $3.9130
billion.
   Commercial bank dealers said there were no major moves in the
day's thin and sluggish trading ahead of the release of the U.S.
trade figures.

<HEAD>Judge Issues Emergency Seizure Order Against Armtec</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JACKSONVILLE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge has issued an order
allowing Unisys Corp. to seize computer components for Navy radar
and weapons systems from a small Florida company that shut down
earlier this month.
   U.S. District Judge Howell W. Melton issued the seizure order
Monday after Unisys filed suit against Armtec Inc. and charged that
the smaller firm might move or damage more than $1.17 million worth
of components it manufactured under contract to Unisys.
   Armtec closed on Aug. 3, laying off about 80 employees, after
Unisys withheld a payment to the small contractor. In its lawsuit,
Unisys claimed it found evidence it had been overbilled by Armtec.
   Both companies are being scrutinized in a federal probe of
potential fraud and bribery in the Defense Department's procedures
for buying weapons systems.
   Unisys also charged that Armtec made out smaller final paychecks
to its employees than provided for in an Aug. 4 agreement under
which Unisys would give the smaller company $66,000 to help cover
the payroll in exchange for taking the components and raw materials
it owns at the Armtec plant.
   Armtec president William W. Roberts and his wife, company
treasurer Evelyn Roberts, said they would not give Unisys about
$200,000 worth of assembled components because Unisys had not paid
its bills.
   ``They're not going to get the goods until they pay us our
money,'' Mrs. Roberts said. ``I will stand in the door at this
building; we'll bar it up.''
   William Roberts denied the allegations in the lawsuit and said
Unisys owed Armtec more than $400,000.
   Lawrence J. Hamilton II, a Jacksonville lawyer who represents
Unisys, said the company sought the seizure order to protect $151
million worth of Unisys contracts to build 14 Terrier Mod 10, three
MK-92 and six Cort radar defense systems for Navy ships.
   If the closed Armtec plant does not remain dehumidified, severe
but almost undetectable damage could occur to the wiring harnesses
produced there, decreasing the reliability of the final products,
Unisys said in court documents.
   Unisys is under contract to deliver the completed systems to the
Navy over roughly a two-year period beginning in February, and the
Navy has made fleet deployment decisions based on bringing some
ships to port for installation of the new systems, the suit said.
   Unisys met a requirement Melton imposed to post a $2.34 million
bond in case it eventually loses its lawsuit against Armtec.
   Mrs. Roberts said 10 of the close to 90 employees that lost
their jobs Aug. 3 had been placed back on the payroll to complete
work for Sikorsky Air, a defense contractor that did business with
Armtec.

<HEAD>Japan's Economy Continues To Grow, Report Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Japan's economy continues to grow steadily in
August as consumer spending and capital expenditures post solid
gains, according to the Bank of Japan's monthly economic report.
   The report, released Tuesday, summarized recent economic figures
for June and July, and concluded that strong domestic demand, both
for consumer and capital goods, is helping to keep the economy
steaming along even though investment in housing and public
spending appear to have reached a peak.
   The report noted that demand for labor is showing a tendency to
tighten, but didn't indicate any concern over wages rising or over
inflationary pressure if they did start to rise.
   Central bank officials have indicated in recent statements they
are watching the impact of wages on inflation closely.
   The report said domestic wholesale prices have risen slightly
recently, but attributed the gains mainly to seasonally higher
electricity rates.
   Commodities prices, meanwhile, are trending lower in Japan as
imports are rising, while world commodities prices have been lower.

<HEAD>Hunt Brothers Silver Case Goes to Jury</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Jury deliberations have begun in the complex
lawsuit by a South American company against Texas oilman Nelson
Bunker Hunt and his two younger brothers, accusing them of trying
to corner the world silver market.
   The six-member civil jury was to resume weighing the evidence
today.
   U.S. District Judge Morris Lasker took about three hours Monday
to instruct the jury on the law. The panel broke off deliberations
about 4:45 p.m. EDT.
   The Hunts are being sued for $150 million by Minpeco SA, which
claims that the Hunts manipulated world silver prices between 1979
and 1980 in a failed attempt to corner the market.
   The trial began at federal court in Manhattan in February.
   Minpeco, a mineral marketing company owned by the Peruvian
government, sued the three brothers _ Nelson Bunker Hunt, 62;
William Herbert Hunt, 59, who also has extensive real estate
holdings; and Lamar Hunt, 56, owner of the National Football
League's Kansas City Chiefs _ and several Middle East businessmen.
   Lawyers for Minpeco charge that the Hunts and their Middle
Eastern co-defendants were responsible for the sharp rise in silver
prices from about $9 an ounce to more than $50 an ounce between
September 1979 and January 1980.
   But the Hunts assert they bought silver because of unstable
world political conditions and those conditions, such as the Soviet
invasion of Afghanistan and the seizure of U.S. hostages in Iran,
drove up the price of silver.

<TEXT>
   Japan will continue to help Mexico rebuild
its economy and ease its huge foreign debt, Japanese Foreign
Minister Sousuke Uno said during the start of a four-day visit here.
   Uno arrived here Monday for an official visit to be highlighted
by the 100th anniversary of the signing of the Mexico-Japanese
Friendship and Trade Treaty.
   ``The Japanese government wants to express through my visit its
willingness to support the efforts of our Mexican friends to
rebuild their national economy and resolve the foreign debt
problem,'' Uno said at a news conference shortly after he arrived.
   The Japanese foreign minister said that rather than a moratorium
on Third World debt, Japan ``will continue supporting Latin
American countries through the recycling of funds and searching for
mutual prosperity.''
   ``For the moment we are not thinking of a moratorium for the
developing countries,'' he said. ``We have to consider case by
case.''
   Japan is the second largest creditor country for Mexico, which
has a $104 billion foreign debt, second highest in the developing
world after Brazil's.
   He said Japan plans to ``recycle'' $20 billion to developing
countries, $4 billion of it to Latin America. He did not explain
what the ``recycling'' involved.
   Uno is scheduled to meet with President Miguel de la Madrid,
Foreign Minister Bernardo Sepulveda and possibly Carlos Salinas de
Gortari, winner of the July 6 presidential election.
   As of 1987, Japan was the third largest investor in Mexico, with
Japanese investments amounting to $1.17 billion, or 6.5 percent of
total foreign investment in the country.

<HEAD>Executives Sentenced, Company Fined for Selling Used Jets Parts</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A defense contractor was fined $1 million and
two executives received jail terms for selling the Pentagon used
jet parts as new.
   The company, Consolidated Aeronautics Corp. of North Hollywood,
also was ordered Monday to pay the Defense Department $987,000 in
restitution.
   ``This kind of crime strikes at the very heart of our national
security system,'' U.S. District Judge A. Wallace Tashima said.
   ``The integrity of the defense contracting system depends on the
integrity of the military procurement officers and the honesty and
reliability of defense contractors.''
   Consolidated's $1 million contract with the Pentagon called for
new parts, but instead it supplied used, refurbished or altered
parts for the military's A-7, F-104 and F-4 jets, said Assistant
U.S. Attorney William Fahey.
   The parts, which included a tail assembly for the F-104 and a
key component of the A-7's stability system, were critical items,
and Navy fliers could have been killed if the parts were used, the
prosecutor said.
   None of the parts were used in jets because they failed to pass
military tests, Fahey said.
   Company executives said the parts were not deficient and would
not have endangered lives.
   Vice President Ronald Guy, 43, was sentenced to a year and a day
in jail, fined $50,000, placed on three years' probation and
ordered to perform 150 hours of community service, Fahey said.
   President Gordon Strube, 69, was sentenced to six months in a
halfway house, fined $300,000, placed on five years' probation and
was ordered to complete 1,000 hours of community service, the
prosecutor said.
   Guy had admitted to conspiracy, making a false statement and
making a false claim. Strube pleaded guilty to conspiracy and
accessory to making a false claim and making a false statement.
   The company pleaded guilty in May to conspiracy, making false
statements to the U.S. government and making false claims.

   Stocks retreated broadly this morning after the
government reported a sharply higher trade deficit for June.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks, which hit its
lowest point in nearly three months on Monday because of
interest-rate fears, was up 6.40 to 2,010.67 as of 10 a.m. EDT. But
broader market indicators were widely lower.
   The New York Stock Exchange composite index of all listed issues
fell 0.17 to 146.41. On the American Stock Exchange, the
market-value index fell 0.54 to 293.29.
   Losing NYSE issues swamped advances by more than 3-to-1, with
752 down, 223 up and 506 unchanged. Volume on the Big Board totaled
23.43 million shares after the first 30 minutes.
   The $12.5 billion shortfall in the monthly trade deficit
reported by the Commerce Department was 28.5 percent worse than the
May imbalance and exceeded market predictions. The report
intensified fears that interest rates must rise further for the
country to finance its foreign purchases.
   On Monday, the Dow industrials fell 33.25 to close at 2,004.27,
the lowest finish since late May.
   Declining issues outnumbered advances by nearly 4-to-1 in
nationwide trading of NYSE-listed stocks, with 1,194 down, 345 up
and 432 unchanged.
   Volume on the NYSE floor totaled 128.56 million shares, down
from 176.96 million in the previous session.

   Berkshire Hathaway Inc. reported its profits
rose 104 percent in the second quarter, to $94.4 million from $46.2
million, aided by a lower federal corporate income tax rate.
   For the period ended June 30, Berkshire Hathaway's net income

for the same period last year, the company said Monday.
   Earnings from operations, which excludes gains from the sale of

$45.9 million, or $40 per share for the same quarter in 1987.
   In a statement released Monday, the company said earnings were
influenced by the lower federal corporate income tax rate for 1988
_ 34 percent for this year compared with 40 percent in 1987.
   For the first half of the year, the investment company reported
net earnings of $193.5 million, or $168.75 per share, compared with
net earnings of $106.7 million, or $93.04 per share, for the same
period in 1987.
   The company said its earnings from operations in the first half
of this year included a $38 million increase in investment income,
which includes dividends and interest.

<TEXT>
   The nation's merchandise trade deficit jumped to $12.5 billion
in June, the Commerce Department said today in a report that
weakened the dollar and pushed up interest rates.
   The larger trade gap raised concerns that the dollar would have
to fall to make American-made products more competitive in world
markets.
   In another report that raised fears of inflation, the Federal
Reserve said today that American industry operated at 83.5 percent
of capacity in July, the highest level since March 1980.
   The strength of the economy was reflected in the trade deficit,
which rose partly because the economy consumed a record amount of
imported products.
   The financial markets reacted with modest pessimism. Stock
prices were broadly lower, although the Dow Jones average of 30
industrial stocks was up 6.04 points to 2,010.31 as of 11 a.m. EDT.
   The dollar lost more than 1 percent of its value against the
Japanese yen, British pound and West German mark immediately after
the morning report, but then trimmed nearly half its losses.
   Bond prices fell, pushing interest rates higher. Prospects for a
falling dollar hurt bond prices by frightening away foreign
investors.
   The benchmark 30-year Treasury bond fell 17-32 point, or about
$5.30 per $1,000 in face value, as its yield rose to 9.49 percent
from 9.44 percent late Monday.
   The deficit was the worst since February's $14.4 billion, which
triggered a 100-point plunge in the Dow Jones average of 30
industrials when it was announced in April.
   While exports fell by 2.4 percent in June to a seasonally
adjusted $26.8 billion while imports surged to an all-time high of
$39.4 billion.
   On Monday, investors' concerns about inflation were fueled by a
government report that industrial production rose in July at its
fastest rate in nine months.
   The report issued Monday by the Federal Reserve helped knock
down stock prices as the Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks
fell 33.25 points to 2,004.27. Combined with its 81.61-point
decline last week, the average is at its lowest point since May 27,
when it finished at 1,956.44.
   The 0.8 percent increase in industrial output intensified
economists' speculation that the economy was expanding too rapidly,
leading to possible inflationary bottlenecks and higher wage
demands.
   ``You still have this global interest rate pressure,'' said
William King, head trader at Nikko Securities Co. International in
New York. ``That's why the market got whacked.''
   The bond market showed less response than the stock market did
Monday to the industrial production report. Analysts speculated
that bond traders may have been focusing their attention on today's
release of June merchandise trade figures.
   The price of the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond, which is
highly sensitive to inflation speculation, edged down Monday as its
yield rose to 9.43 percent from 9.42 percent late Friday.
   Some analysts speculated the Federal Reserve would take more
steps to cool off the economy with higher interest rates, even
though the central bank moved just last week to raise its discount
rate to 6.5 percent from 6 percent. That is the rate the Fed
charges on loans to commercial banks, and is a key indicator of the
Fed's interest rate policy.
   Fed policy-makers had a regular closed-door meeting scheduled
today to review the economy's prospects and chart monetary policy
for the next 1{ months.
   The Federal Reserve said Monday the large July advance in
industrial production was widespread throughout U.S. manufacturing
industries and also reflected heavy demand for electricity during
the summer heat wave.
   The 0.8 percent July advance was double the 0.4 percent June
increase and marked the 10th consecutive month that industrial
production has risen. It was the largest increase since a 1.1
percent rise last October.
   ``We are seeing an industrial sector that is surging under the
impact of increased exports and higher capital spending,'' said
Jerry Jasinowski, chief economist of the National Association of
Manufacturers.
   But Jasinowski said some of the strength in July was overstated,
reflecting the increased electrical demand and some unwanted
buildup in inventories.
   ``People ought not be frightened by these hefty industrial
production numbers because the inventory buildup we have been
seeing shows that there is still slack in the economy,'' Jasinowski
said.

   Stocks turned mixed this morning in moderate
trading after an early selloff in response to the government's
report of a sharply higher June trade deficit.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks, which hit its
lowest point in nearly three months Monday on anxiety over higher
interest rates, was up 6.40 to 2,010.67 as of 11 a.m. EDT. Broader
market indicators were mixed.
   Brokers said the government's report of a $12.5 billion deficit
in June initially jolted the market because it was much higher than
expected and raised new fears of U.S. economic weakness. But the
stock decline presented buying opportunities to some investors, and
that helped the market partly recover.
   Nevertheless, many Wall Street analysts remained skeptical.
   ``In my opinion, the market still has to go through some pain
here,'' said Philip C. Puccio, senior vice president and manager of
institutional trading at Dillon, Read & Co.
   The New York Stock Exchange composite index of all listed issues
rose 0.01 to 146.59. On the American Stock Exchange, the
market-value index fell 0.53 to 293.30.
   Losing NYSE issues outnumbered advances by a 7-to-5 ratio, with
712 down, 465 up and 547 unchanged. Volume on the Big Board totaled
58.4 million shares after the first 90 minutes.
   Dividend-capture strategies vastly inflated the actual level of
business, as reflected in the most actively traded NYSE issue,
Philadelphia Electric. The utility was unchanged at 18[ on volume
exceeding 12.1 million shares. Northeast Utilities was up [ to 18~
on volume of 2 million shares.
   Blue-chip stocks were mixed. AT&T fell [ to 24~, Coca-Cola rose

   On Monday, the Dow industrials fell 33.25 to close at 2,004.27,
the lowest finish since late May.

   Textron Inc. said Tuesday it was putting
its its Gorham silverware division up for sale in a move to dispose
of assets that do not fit the company's business objectives.
   Textron did not put a pricetag on the division.
   B.F. Dolan, Textron chairman, president and chief executive,
said the decision to sell the Gorham division follows its
restructuring and ``is part of the company's plan to sell assets
that do not fit Textron's strategic objectives.''
   The division has about 525 employees and is headquartered in
Johnston, R.I., with a manufacturing facility in North Smithfield,
R.I., and distribution center in Williamsport, Md.
   Gorham was founded in 1831 by Jabez Gorham to produce silver
spoons. The company, which was acquired by Textron in 1967,
manufactures sterling and stainless steel flatware, china
dinnerware and lead crystal.
   Textron's main business sectors include aerospace technology,
commercial products and financial services.

<HEAD>Survey Shows Farmland Prices Will Rebound</HEAD>
<DATELINE>URBANA, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Midwest drought may have only a minor
impact on the price of good farmland even though it has caused
significant crop losses, a University of Illinois economist says.
   John Scott, an agricultural land economist, said he polled more
than 400 professional farmland appraisers in Illinois, Iowa,
Indiana and Ohio, asking them what effect the drought would have on
farmland prices.
   ``The consensus that emerged from the responses was that if the
drought has any impact at all it will only last one year, and might
represent a short decline in land values,'' Scott said, in a
statement released Monday.
   The value of prime farmland fell sharply during the first half
of this decade, but Scott said appraisers indicated a rally in the
past 18 months.
   Asked if the prospect of low corn and soybean production because
of the drought could stop that rally, the appraisers answered that
any halt would be a brief one.
   ``These appraisers expect any loss to be made up by a rebound
with a good crop in 1989, and then land prices will move to higher
levels in coming years,'' Scott said.
   In addition, stronger commodity prices resulting from the short
crops and the reduction of the grain surplus will help the land
market rally again, he said.
   Scott also pointed out that some economists expect interest
rates to decline in the next few years and that, too, ``would tend
to support stronger land prices.''
   A temporary slump in land prices might tempt farmers to invest
in more land and expand their operations, but Scott urged caution.
   ``Only when a farmer is financially capable and can pencil out,
through revenue projections, the ability to pay for the land,
should the farmer consider buying it,'' Scott said.
   He also said the next rally in land prices will be unlike the
one in the 1970s, which was fueled by inflation.
   During that rally, some farmers thought inflation would pay for
the land, and they spent more on it that they ever could recover in
earnings.

<HEAD>South Korean Commissioner Says American Businesses Slow, Lazy</HEAD>
<DATELINE>COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   American companies are ``slow and lazy''
in their export policy compared with the more competitive Japanese,
a South Korean trade commissioner told a trade development club.
   Young-Il Sunwoo, director of the Korea Trade Center in Chicago,
praised the Japanese as being aggressive exporters who follow
through with excellent customer services.
   ``Many U.S. companies are less motivated than the Japanese in
penetrating the Korean market,'' he told the Columbus World Trade
Development Club on Monday. ``Japan is very competitive in Korea.''
   American exports to South Korea increased about 25 percent last
year to $8.7 billion. He said the increase was partly because of a
reduction of trade restrictions and depreciation of the South
Korean won in relation to the U.S. dollar.
   However, growing South Korean exports to the United States have
created a $10.8 billion trade surplus between the two nations which
favors South Korea. The Asian nation conducts 39 percent of its
export trade with the United States.
   Sunwoo said that when South Korea dropped trade barriers and
added 560 new items to its import market, the Japanese took 40
percent of the new business while the United States got 9 percent.
   Besides having geographic and cultural advantages, the Japanese
take time to learn the Korean markets and follow through with
service, he added.
   ``Most Americans don't know about the Korean market,'' he said.
``American businesses are slow and lazy, especially in the
after-services.''
   The Japanese service a piece of equipment in a day or two, but
``with the U.S., it is impossible,'' he said.
   Sunwoo said American business needs to motivate its export
marketing efforts and get to know South Korean businesses. He said
large Korean trading companies are looking for American suppliers
for machinery, chemicals, agricultural products, and electrical
testing equipment.
   ``If possible, please try to make a joint venture with a Korean
company,'' he said, adding that such ventures would help American
companies gain a foothold in the South Korean market that also may
be a link to markets in Japan and China.

<HEAD>Government Attacked Over Japanese Car Import Restrictions</HEAD>
<DATELINE>STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Swedish price control officials Tuesday
attacked the government for suggesting restrictions on Japanese car
imports.
   The National Price and Cartel Office said in a sharply worded
letter that limiting Japanese imports would raise car prices, boost
inflation and reduce freedom of choice for Swedish customers.
   The attack was in response to proposed restrictions by the
Foreign Ministry's trade department, which claims Japanese car
makers are redirecting exports to Sweden because of restrictions in
other countries. The ministry dismissed the conclusions by the
cartel office.
   Sweden, home of Volvo and Saab car makers, was one of the last
countries in Europe with a free automobile market, the government
department said.
   Per-Arne Sundbom, head of the cartel office which is politically
independent, told two newspapers that the government was ``shouting
before the wolf has come'' by claiming the Japanese were swamping
the Swedish market.
   Foreign Ministry official Lars Stalberg said that following
talks in Tokyo in April, Japanese manufacturers were ready to
voluntarily limit exports to Sweden for the rest of the year.
   ``We feel it was an admission by the Japanese companies that
they have subjected the Swedish market to too strong pressure and
have used the fact that Sweden has the only open market,'' Stalberg
said.
   He said Japanese manufacturers increased their market share in
Sweden from 15 percent in 1986 to 25 percent during the first part
of this year. Toyota, Nissan and Mazda are now among the top 10
importers.
   Stalberg denied allegations by opposition leader Bengt
Westerberg that the Social Democratic government was violating
Sweden's traditional support for free trade.
   He said the government had ``taken no action ... only discussed
a developement which we find disquieting.''
   Japanese cars sold well here because they had a reputation for
durability and were cheaper. A new Japanese small car cost about
the same as a second-hand Swedish model.
   Sundbom said decreased competition would raise inflation, which
is more than 6 percent and is nearly twice as high as most of
Sweden's trading partners.
   The Cartel Office said restrictions would not affect the
Swedish-made cars as much as imports from West Germany, which go to
the same small-car market.
   A Volvo spokesman also said the Swedish giant had not suffered
from the Japanese expansion and sales last year were up 14 percent.
   Volvo sold a record 73,255 last year, twice as many as its
nearest competitor, Ford, said official statistics. Saab was the
fourth largest seller in Sweden.

<HEAD>Washington Authorities Seize Illegal Canadian Crab Pots</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BLAINE, Wash. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Washington state authorities today said
they have seized up to 900 crab pots illegally placed in U.S. water
by Canadian fishermen, and a local politician calls it a case of
``low-seas piracy.''
   The pots contained more than 10,000 pounds of prime Dungeness
crab, valued at about $25,000, said Tom Burton, a fisherman and
Whatcom County councilman.
   The crabs were returned to Boundary Bay because the U.S. harvest
for Dungeness crab closed last spring.
   About 850 to 900 of the traps were pulled in Saturday, Sunday
and Monday, 600 of them on Monday, said Lt. Lyle Nelson of the
state Department of Fisheries.
   The pots were found about a half-mile to a mile south of the
Canadian border, which cuts across the more than 10-mile-wide mouth
of Boundary Bay, authorities said.
   ``This is low-seas piracy,'' said Burton, who was among the
fishermen who helped remove the pots. ``We've been hearing rumors
about this for quite some time. Over the winter, our drag fishermen
have been snagging Canadian pots'' in their nets.
   ``We've been telling state fisheries people all summer that
there was a problem,'' Burton said. ``It's nothing to see a dragger
return with 20 Canadian crab pots on the stern.''
   Last week, Coast Guard and state officials arrested three
residents of Vancouver, British Columbia, suspected ofn a normal summer,
Avery said.
   ``What were living through now is the same thing we were living
through in 1980,'' in terms of a natural disaster, he said.
   Normal death rates nearly doubled from Oklahoma east during a
1966 heat wave _ with deaths jumping to five times normal in St.
Louis _ according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration.
   The Senate Special Committee on Aging later reported that heat
waves in 1963 and 1966 claimed a total of 11,000 lives.
   And a University of California at Berkeley study found that hot
spells in Los Angeles in 1939, 1955 and 1963 each produced more
excess deaths than any recorded natural disaster in that state,
including the San Francisco earthquake and fire of 1906.
   Those most vulnerable to heat stress are the elderly, who may
already suffer various ailments, Avery explained. Indeed, in 1980
the elderly made up 70 percent of the excess deaths in the hot
weather, he said.
   ``Several factors contribute to this increased vulnerability to
heat stress, including less cardiovascular stamina, heart damage,
less responsive blood vessels, underlying diseases and a decreased
ability to sweat,'' the Senate aging committee reported.
   In addition, it noted, the elderly use more prescription
medications, and many of those drugs can increase sensitivity to
heat.
   Heat-caused deaths do not arouse the concern they should because
a uniform reporting system has not been established, Avery said.
   As a result, only classic cases of heat stroke get officially
reported as heat deaths, and those amount to perhaps 200 in a
normal summer and 1,500 to 1,600 in a hot summer like 1980, he
explained.
   Still not attributed to the heat are the thousands of
temperature-induced heart attacks, strokes and other fatal
ailments. They are only measured later, when deaths in the hot
years can be compared to more normal ones and the excess calculated.
   ``We have very accurate assessment of what crop losses are going
to be, and it seems we are more concerned about corn than about our
people. I think that's a tragedy,'' Avery said.
   Death and illness aren't the only heat-wave related problems;
heat affects work attendance and productivity, depending on the
region.
   A five-year study by researchers at the University of Delaware
found that hot weather increases work attendance in the Sun Belt
but reduces it in other areas of the country.
   Attendance rates remain high in hot-weather cities where air
conditioning is common at home, work and car, the study found. But
rates drop off when the the weather cools slightly and workers want
to engage in outdoor tasks and recreation.
   In northern cities, however, work attendance dips as people
unaccustomed to hot, muggy weather lose sleep and suffer other
discomfort.

   The U.S. trade deficit suffered a major
setback in June, swelling to $12.5 billion, the government said
today in a report that sent the dollar down sharply, although
briefly, on foreign currency markets.
   The surge in the trade deficit, a sharp 28.5 percent worse than
the revised May imbalance of $9.8 billion, came after three
consecutive months of improving trade figures, the Commerce
Department reported.
   June's trading shortfall was the worst since February's $14.4
billion deficit, which triggered a 100-point plunge in the Dow
Jones industrial average when it was announced in April.
   The impact of the June deficit figure, however, was far less
adverse.
   The dollar initially fell dramatically against all major
currencies in hectic trading, but within an hour recovered at least
half of its lost ground.
   Likewise, stock prices were broadly lower at the opening of
trading. After three hours of activity, however, the Dow Jones
industrial average had risen by more than 25 points.
   ``The initial reaction to the June trade figures was
indigestion, but the more we chew on them, the better they taste,''
said Jay Goldinger, chief economist at Capital Insight, a Los
Angeles investment house.
   Goldinger said that the markets realized that the one-month rise
did not interrupt what should be a substantial improvement in trade
for 1988.
   In a second report today, the government said that American
industry operated at 83.5 percent of capacity in July, the highest
level in more than eight years. The 0.4 percentage-point jump from
the June operating rate was also viewed negatively by financial
markets because it heigthened concerns about growing inflationary
pressures.
   The Reagan administration sought to play down the significance
of one-month's increase in the trade deficit, saying that it did
not change the fact that the U.S. trade deficit for all of 1988
will be sharply lower than the record imbalance suffered in 1987.
   ``This one-month jump in the trade deficit is not cause for
alarm,'' U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter said in a
statement. ``Monthly numbers will always be erratic and it is more
instructive to focus on the long-term outlook.''
   Analysts said the trade deficit has been a major blow to the
dollar's stability this year and shows financial markets are still
vulnerable to unexpected jolts from the monthly merchandise trade
statistics.
   ``The June trade figure is a big disappointment and the
implications are very scary for financial markets,'' said Allen
Sinai, chief economist for The Boston Co.
   Sinai said that the trade figure would likely push the dollar
lower, driving up the costs of imported goods and further
intensifying inflationary pressures in the United States.
   The June deficit in merchandise trade was substantially worse
than had been expected. Most economists had anticipated a deficit
of around $10.9 billion, which would have matched the deficit as
originally reported for May.
   The May imbalance was revised downward to $9.8 billion, making
it the best performance since an $8 billion deficit in December
1984.
   Analysts said the markets were ignoring the better May figure to
focus on the widening of the June deficit, which was seen as a
disappointment because of a big jump in imports and a drop in U.S.
exports.
   Exports fell by 2.4 percent in June to a seasonally adjusted
$26.8 billion while imports surged to an all-time high of $39.4
billion.
   The deterioration pointed up the problem facing U.S.
policy-makers, who have struggled for most of this decade to find
ways to reduce soaring trade deficits.
   While U.S. exports have shown improvements because of a
substantial decline in the value of the dollar, imports have stayed
at stubbornly high levels despite the fact that a weaker dollar is
now making foreign goods more expensive for American consumers.
   The 5.7 percent jump in imports in June was laid to a sharp rise
in imports of clothing, office equipment and heavy machinery.
   The report said that shipments of foreign capital goods shot up
by $900 million in June while shipments of consumer goods rose up
$700 million.
   The weakness in exports reflected declines in shipments of
American capital goods, agricultural products and autos.
   Even with the deterioration, the U.S. trade deficit for the
first six months of the year was running at an annual rate of $140
billion, down sharply from the record deficit of $170.3 billion set
in 1987.
   America's foreign oil bill declined slightly in June to $3.6
billion, compared to $3.9 billion in May, as the average price per
barrel fell to $16.19, down 21 cents from May. An average of 7.36
million barrels of oil were imported daily, down from 7.76 million
barrels daily in May.
   As usual, the largest overall deficit was with Japan, an
imbalance of $4.4 billion, up from $4.1 billion in May.
   The deficit with Canada, America's largest trading partner,
climbed to $1.40 billion. The deficit with the countries of Western
Europe rose to $1.9 billion while the deficit with the newly
industrialized countries of Taiwan, South Korea, Hong Kong and
Singapore rose to $2.7 billion in June.

   Share prices finished higher Tuesday, as a
stronger start on Wall Street lent a helping hand to London
equities.
   Dealers said market players ignored the release of
worse-than-expected U.S. trade figures and chose to wait for
additional economic reports due later in the week.
   Most London equity players were uninterested in doing much ahead
of the release of British money supply and bank lending figures on
Thursday and Friday's release of the British retail price index,
which are seen as far more important in determining the near-term
outlook for British interest rates and equities.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index closed up 8.5
points, or 0.5 percent, at 1,825.3.
   Volume was a very light 346.6 million shares, little changed
from Monday's 346.0 million shares.
   Players were heartened by a strong showing on Wall Street, where
the Dow Jones industrial average was up 17.07 points at 2,021.34 as
the London session finished.
   Little trading took place in London Tuesday morning as the
market waited for the release of the U.S. trade report for June.
   The Commerce Department reported that the deficit widened
sharply to $12.5 billion in June from a revised $9.8 billion
dollars in May. The markets had expected a $10.6 billion June
shortfall.
   Dealers said the market chose to overlook the
worse-than-expected June figure because it was tempered by a
downward revision in May's gap, originally reported as $10.9
billion.
   The Financial Times 30-share index was up 7.7 points at 1,473.3

   The Federal Trade Commission announced Tuesday
that is will not drop its challenge to the proposed merger of the
Coca-Cola and Dr Pepper soft drink companies, even though the plan
has been scrapped.
   The two firms announced merger plans in June of 1986 and were
promptly challenged by the commission, which contended the
combination would reduce competition in the production and sale of
soft drinks.
   The companies subsequently abandoned the merger plan and asked
the commission to dismiss its administrative complaint against them.
   However, the agency announced that it had voted 2-1 to continue
the action, in which it is asking a court to require Coca-Cola to
apply for permission from the agency before acquiring stock in any
soft drink company for 10 years.
   The case was sent to an administrative law judge for
consideration.

<HEAD>Dayton Hudson Says Earnings Up; Penney Has Earnings Drop; Zayre
Posts Loss</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Three of the nation's largest retailers reported Tuesday they
had varying degrees of success in maintaining second-quarter
earnings as consumers continued to spend at a sluggish pace.
   Dayton Hudson Corp. said its earnings rose 24 percent during the
quarter ended July 30 as the company kept tight controls on
expenses. Meanwhile, J.C. Penney Co. Inc. reported its income
dropped 21 percent and Zayre Corp. posted a substantial loss.
   Dayton Hudson said it earned $28.6 million, or 34 cents per
share, compared with $23 million, or 24 cents per share, in the
same period a year earlier.
   Second-quarter revenue increased to $2.69 billion from $2.31
billion a year ago.
   ``We planned conservatively for the quarter and, despite a weak
retail environment, our operating companies executed their plans
very well,'' said Kenneth A. Macke, chairman and chief executive
officer.
   ``We are particularly pleased with the profit performance of
Mervyn's and are confident that its turn-around is progressing,''
Macke said.
   Problems with Mervyn's apparel stores drained Dayton Hudson
profits in past quarters and made the company a takeover target for
Dart Group Corp. a year ago. The Dart bid failed in the wake of the
stock market crash.
   Penney reported second-quarter income of $81 million, or 61
cents per share, down from $103 million, or 68 cents per share, in
the second three months of 1987.
   The company reported revenue of $3.21 billion, down from $3.41
billion a year earlier.
   The retailer attributed the earnings drop to the increased level
of markdowns that apparel retailers have been forced to take during
a year-old sales slump.
   Penney said it also had higher development costs for ventures
including video home shopping, but said its results benefited from
a lower tax rate.
   The nearly $22 million loss reported by Zayre came as no
surprise after the company warned earlier this month it had
suffered a substantial loss during the second quarter.
   The loss compared with earnings of $77.3 million, or $1.29 a
share, in the second quarter of 1987. The year-earlier results
included an $89.6 million gain from the sale of part of Zayre's
interest in its TJX Cos. apparel division.
   Zayre attributed the loss in the latest quarter to its flagging
discount stores division, which lost sales after it cut back on
promotions. The discount stores also were forced to take
larger-than-expected markdowns, Zayre said in a statement.
   The retailer's second-quarter revenue totaled $1.55 billion, up
from $1.4 billion.
   For the first six months, Dayton Hudson's earnings were $59.3
million, or 70 cents per share, compared with $61.1 million, or 63
cents per share, for the first half of 1987. Revenue for the first
half increased to $5.24 billion from $4.46 billion a year ago.
   Dayton Hudson Corp. operates 599 department, specialty and
discount stores in 37 states.
   Penney said it earned $212 million, or $1.57 per share, during
the first half, down from $239 million, or $1.59 per share, in the
same period a year earlier. The 1987 figure includes a $140 million
charge for the relocation of Penney's headquarters to Dallas from
New York.
   First-half revenue totaled $6.39 billion, down from $6.63
billion in the first six months of 1987.
   Zayre reported a six-month loss of $17.4 million, compared with
earnings of $118.9 million, or $1.99 per share, a year earlier. The
1987 figure includes the gain from the TJX sale as well as a $20.5
million gain from an accounting change.
   The company had first-half revenue of nearly $3 billion,
compared with $2.7 billion for the first six months of last year.

   The stock market discarded an unsettling report
about the trade deficit and advanced this afternoon in moderate
trading, nearly erasing losses of the previous session.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks, which hit its
lowest point in nearly three months Monday on anxiety over higher
inflation, was up 27.20 points to 2,031.47 as of 2 p.m. EDT.
Broader market indicators also rose.
   Brokers said the government's report this morning of a $12.5
billion trade deficit in June initially hurt the market because it
was much higher than expected, depressing the dollar's value and
pushing up interest rates.
   But the stock decline presented buying opportunities to some
investors, and that helped the market recover in what brokers
described as largely a technical bounce.
   At the same time, many Wall Street analysts remained skeptical
about the immediate future for stocks.
   ``In my opinion, the market still has to go through some pain
here,'' said Philip C. Puccio, senior vice president and manager of
institutional trading at Dillon, Read & Co. in New York.
   The New York Stock Exchange composite index of all listed issues
rose 1.49 to 148.07. On the American Stock Exchange, the
market-value index rose 0.84 to 294.67.
   Gaining NYSE issues outnumbered declines by a nearly 9-to-5

   DeLaurentiis Entertainment Group
Inc., left floundering by a string of box office flops, on Tuesday
filed for protection from its creditors under Chapter 11 of federal
bankruptcy laws.
   The move had been expected since Friday, when the company
founded by Italian producer Dino DeLaurentiis revealed it had
failed to negotiate a debt swap with bondholders that it had termed
essential for survival.
   The company _ maker of the movies ``Crimes of the Heart'' and
``Weeds'' and the TV miniseries ``Noble House'' _ has sold assets
and sought to restructure its debt in order to survive.
   The company hasn't reported financial results for 1987, but has
announced estimates of a $69 million loss.
   The Chapter 11 filing begins a voluntary bankruptcy proceeding
in which present management continues to operate the company, under
the supervision of a federal bankruptcy judge, in an attempt to pay
creditors and reorganize the company. Filing of the petition
immediately puts a company's debts on hold.
   In announcing the filing in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Beverly
Hills, the company didn't list assets and liabilities.
   The debt swap offer that failed last week would have
dramatically reduced the company's $65 million bond debt by trading
existing bonds for stock and bonds with terms more favorable to
DeLaurentiis. The company hasn't revealed how many of its
bondholders agreed to accept the offer, other than to call the
response disappointing.
   Sale of DeLaurentiis' library of 300 films, including ``The
Graduate'' and ``Carnal Knowledge,'' to British financier Michael
Stevens brought $54 million in July. The company earlier sold its
share in an Australian film distributor for $7 million.
   The company previously announced an agreement for a new line of
credit with Credit Lyonnais Bank of the Netherlands, but didn't
reveal the amount.
   DeLaurentiis, who was responsible for such box office successes
as ``King Kong'' and ``Serpico,'' took his company public with a
stock offering in March 1986. But the company has failed to repeat
his earlier success, and DeLaurentiis himself stepped aside in
February, giving management proxy voting control of his 61.9
percent stake in the company.
   The bankruptcy filing doesn't include DeLaurentiis Entertainment
Group subsidiaries North Carolina Film Studios Inc. or Onyx
Entertainment Inc., the company's newly formed production company.
   Neither is an affiliated limited partnership, DeLaurentiis Film
Partners, affected by the filing.

<HEAD>Federal Judge Grants Class-Action Status for Lawsuits</HEAD>

<DATELINE>CINCINNATI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lawyers met privately Tuesday to plan strategy
on behalf of farmers in 10 states who accuse Chubb Group of
Insurance Cos. of reneging on its duties to pay drought insurance
claims.
   ``It's just an organizational meeting in an effort to have a
united front, which is the only way to go,'' said Cincinnati lawyer
Stanley M. Chesley, who organized the meeting. He declined to
elaborate on the discussions.
   U.S. District Judge Carl B. Rubin of Cincinnati issued an order
Monday granting class-action status to lawsuits against Chubb,
allowing eligible farmers nationwide to join a group legal action
against the Warren, N.J.-based company. Farmers still can pursue
independent litigation.
   Rubin's action expanded his decision last week to grant the
class-action status to three Ohio claims against Chubb.
   The Ohio Department of Insurance also is conducting hearings to
investigate how Chubb policies were marketed within the state.
   Some of the farmers' lawsuits also name as a defendant Good
Weather Agriculture, a California-based agent for Chubb, Chesley
said.
   The farmers say Chubb sold them drought insurance on their
crops, but has reneged on its duties to pay their claims as a
result of the ongoing drought damage. Chubb has offered to repay
farmers twice the amounts they paid in premiums, but state
insurance regulators have termed the offer insufficient.
   Chubb has maintained its innocence. In recent weeks, the company
has taken out full-page newspaper advertisements nationwide to say
that it has a long-standing reputation for business integrity.
   The company says it initially intended to underwrite $30 million
in drought insurance, but a last-minute flurry of applications
resulted in potential liabilities of more than $400 million.
   Chubb spokeswoman Mary Lu Korkuch did not return a telephone
message Tuesday seeking further comment.
   Chesley, who helped obtain the judge's class-action declaration,
said an estimated 8,800 farmers in 10 states could have claims
against the company. He said the farmers involved are in Ohio,
Indiana, Kentucky, Tennessee, Michigan, Illinois, Missouri,
Minnesota, Iowa and Wisconsin.
   Chesley said he hopes the case can go to trial in three to four
months if a settlement is not worked out. ``Our only interest is
full and fair compensation for the plaintiffs,'' he said.
   Last week, some Minnesota farmers suggested that they might
pursue their own suits against Chubb. But Janet Abaray, a lawyer on
Chesley's staff, said last week that she persuaded lawyers for the
Minnesota farmers to support the class-action lawsuit.

<HEAD>Unisys Begins Seizure Of Armtec Supplies</HEAD>

<DATELINE>JACKSONVILLE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Unisys Corp. employees, armed with a
federal court order, began removing $1.7 million in military
components from Armtec Inc. in Palatka Tuesday under the watchful
eyes of three federal marshals.
   While the packing and loading operation took place, about 25
former Armtec employees, who lost their jobs when Unisys cancelled
its contracts with Armtec, picketed outside, carrying signs
reading, ``Armtec Is Quality,'' ``Unisys Pay Up,'' and ``Jobs Not
Welfare.''
   Both Armtec and Unisys have come under scrutiny in a federal
probe of potential fraud and bribery in Pentagon weapons contacts,
and Armtec shut down earlier this month.
   U.S. District Judge Howell W. Melton in Jacksonville ordered the
seizure Monday after Unisys, citing national defense and $151
million in federal contracts, asked the judge to order Armtec to
surrender materials owned by Unisys.
   Lawrence J. Hamilton II, a Jacksonville lawyer who represents
Unisys, said he action was taken to protect Unisys contracts to
build 14 Terrier Mod 10, three MK-92 and six Cort radar-defense
systems for Navy ships.
   Unisys is under contract to deliver the completed systems to the
Navy over roughly a two-year period beginning in February, and the
Navy has made fleet deployment decisions based on bringing some
ships to port for installation of the new systems, the suit said.
   The Unisys lawsuit claims that Armtec told Unisys lawyers last
week that it would not turn over the materials because Unisys owed
it money for work already performed.
   Unisys said it feared that if the closed Armtec plant did not
remain dehumidified, severe but almost undetectable damage could
occur to the wiring harnesses produced there, decreasing the
reliability of the final products, Unisys said in court documents.
   The issue came to a boil when Unisys notified Armtec on Aug. 3
that it would no longer buy the wiring harnesses and other
materials from Armtec.
   Actions by Unisys forced the fledgling defense contractor to
close its doors and lay off 88 workers.

   Zondervan Corp. shareholders have
tendered 93 percent of the company's shares to Harper & Row
Publishers Inc., allowing for a friendly, $57 million takeover of
the Christian publishing company, officials said today.
   Zondervan stockholders had until midnight Monday to respond to
Harper & Row's tender offer of $13.50 per share. Owners of shares
not tendered to Harper & Row will also be paid $13.50 per share and
the stock will be canceled.
   Zondervan, which had been on the selling block two years, has
4.2 million shares outstanding and has given Harper & Row an option
for an additional 1 million shares of new stock.
   New York City-based Harper & Row, a unit of Rupert Murdoch's
publishing and media empire, has said it would keep Zondervan's
headquarters in Grand Rapids.
   Zondervan is a leading publisher of Christian books,
pre-recorded and printed music and operates about 80 Christian
bookstores.
   In 1987, Zondervan had a net profit of $859,000 on sales of $105
million.

   Grain and soybean futures closed mostly lower
Tuesday on the Chicago Board of Trade amid slack export demand and
forecasts for showers and cooler temperatures in the Corn Belt
later this week.
   Corn futures prices fell nearly 10 cents a bushel, the permitted
daily limit. The corn market was the leader in a session that
featured relatively light trading and wide price swings in the
soybean pit.
   Soybean futures, which are limited to moves of 30 cents a
bushel, have recently provided direction to the grain markets. But
soybeans lost traders Tuesday to the lower-risk corn pit, said
Steve Freed, a grain analyst in Chicago with Dean Witter Reynolds
Inc.
   Despite a record-melting heat wave that threatens further damage
to the drought-stressed soybean crop, Freed said speculators shied
away from the soybean market when prices for near-month delivery
approached $9 a bushel Tuesday morning.
   Meteorologists predicted cooler temperatures would begin moving
into the Midwest on Thursday. The forecasts, plus a lack of
substantial export business, left the markets with little bullish
news.
   ``It's still a bullish market, but it's a market that has
trouble finding itself on days like today,'' Freed said.
   At the close, wheat was 1{ cents to 3} cents lower with the
contract for delivery in September at $3.90{ a bushel; corn was 4}
cents to 9} cents lower with September at $2.87{ a bushel; oats
were 4{ cents to 9} cents lower with September at $2.78{ a bushel;
soybeans were 21 cents lower to 20 cents higher with August at
$8.66 a bushel.

whether to grant a home mortgage or what advice to give to a
financial-planning client, IBM said.
   The products include a new release of IBM's Expert System
Environment, which is designed for users with few computer skills,
and a new version of KnowledgeTool, which is for data-processing
professionals.
   For experts in artificial intelligence, IBM offered IBM KEE,
which was developed with Intellicorp Inc. of Mountain View, Calif.,
to run on IBM's big mainframe computers. It is a version of an
existing Intellicorp product.

   Organizers of a new venture involving the weekly
television supplements of 33 newspapers announced plans Tuesday to
challenge popular TV Guide in a battle for advertising revenue.
   The venture, called TV Week Network, groups the newspapers in an
effort to attract national entertainment advertising with rates
competitive with TV Guide's. It is a joint venture of Tribune Media
Services, a subsidiary of Chicago-based Tribune Co., and Western
States Associates, an independent agency that represents newspaper
publishers.
   Representatives of TV Guide didn't have an immediate comment on
the move, but some analysts said the newspaper organizers have
carved themselves a daunting task.
   ``TV Guide is going to be a tough competitor; it's not easy,''
said Rodd Macklin, a financial analyst for Legg Mason Wood Walker
Inc. in Baltimore.
   The Sunday television supplements now carry little national TV
advertising because it is too complicated and time-consuming for
the networks to deal with ad representatives of each individual
newspaper, the organizers said.
   ``It's been inefficient to buy,'' said Robert Reed, president of
Tribune Media Services.
   Under the new scheme, networks will be able to buy space in a
number of TV supplements by doing business with a centralized
operation.
   The move comes on the heels of publishing tycoon Rupert
Murdoch's purchase of TV Guide, announced last Monday, as part of
his $3 billion acquisition of Triangle Publications. The venerable
weekly TV publication is the most widely read magazine in the
country, with a circulation of around 17 million and advertising
revenue of more than $162 million in the first half of the year.
   ``We felt the timing for TV Week Network was right because of
the growing fragmentation of the television viewing audience,''
Reed said. ``When you realize that TV Guide ... only reaches 20
percent of the potential audience, it is not difficult to
understand why there is room in the marketplace for additional
national advertising alternatives.''
   TV Guide also has been challenged in recent years by guides
aimed directly at cable television subscribers. The Cable Guide,
the largest of the pack, has a circulation of about 7.2 million and
is expected to fetch some $35 million in ad revenue this year.
   ``TV Guide's had a lot bigger threats over the last five years''
than the one mounted by the newspaper group, said Robert Ladd, an
analyst for Deutsche Bank Capital Corp. in New York.
   Network and studio advertisers will likely start advertising in
the newspaper sections as a supplement to _ not a replacement for _
their promotions in TV Guide, he suggested.
   The 33 newspapers comprising TV Week Network have a total
circulation of 18.8 million, compared with TV Guide's 9.4 million
in the same markets, the organizers said. Only television-related
advertising will appear in the newspaper supplements, while TV
Guide carries ads for other kinds of products in addition to
promotions of TV programs.
   A full-page, black-and-white ad in the TV Week Network
supplements will average around $70,000 _ about the same or
slightly less than TV Guide charges, Reed said. TV Guide currently
charges $88,900 for the same type of ad, according to Julianne
Hastings, a spokeswoman for the magazine.
   Advertisers will have up until 18 days prior to publication to
place the ads, close to TV Guide's 17.
   The newspapers in the group include the New York Daily News, the
Chicago Tribune, the Los Angeles Times, the Philadelphia Inquirer,
the Boston Globe, the Detroit Free Press, the Houston Chronicle and
the Washington Post.

<HEAD>Cablevision To Buy Some Viacom Properties For $550 Million</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Cablevision Systems Corp. has agreed to spend
$550 million to buy Viacom Inc.'s cable television properties in
Long Island, N.Y., and suburban Cleveland, which together have more
than 200,000 subscribers, the companies said Tuesday.
   Cablevision will also buy a 5 percent stake in Viacom's
Showtime-The Movie Channel for $25 million, they said.
   The sales will help Viacom reduce debt incurred last year in the
leveraged buyout under which it became 83 percent owned by National
Amusements Inc. of Dedham, Mass. a closely held corporation that
owns and operates about 425 movie screens in 14 states and the
United Kingdom.
   Wherever practical, Cablevision and Viacom have agreed to carry
each other's programming on their cable systems. Cablevision
supplies American Movie Classics, Bravo, SportsChannel America and
News 12, while Viacom supplies Showtime, The Movie Channel, MTV,
VH-1 and Nickelodeon-Nick-At-Nite.
   Cablevision's purchase also includes Viacom's 20 percent
ownership of and its management contract for North Coast Cable,
which is the cable system under construction for the city of
Cleveland.
   The Long Island property that Cablevision is purchasing had
120,000 subscribers at the end of 1987 and the suburban Cleveland
one had 75,000, and both have since grown, Viacom said.
   With the completion of its acquisition, Cablevision's Long
Island system, already the largest in the nation, will have more
than 430,000 subscribers. Cablevision's system in the Cleveland
suburbs will top 160,000 subscribers, making it the 10th largest
system in the country.
   The deal will leave Cablevision and its affiliates with more
than 1.3 million subscribers in 11 states. Viacom will have 940,000
subscribers in the western, eastern and midwestern United States.
   Cablevision is based in Woodbury, N.Y., and Viacom in New York.

   The stock market advanced today despite
unsettling news about the swollen U.S. trade deficit, rallying
largely on what brokers described as a technical rebound from its
recent losses.
   Although stocks, bonds and the dollar initially fell when the
government reported a higher-than-expected trade shortfall for
June, Wall Street quickly followed the lead of the U.S. currency,
which made a sharp recovery later in the day. Bond prices also
erased earlier losses.
   ``The stock market rallied because it got so oversold,'' said
Hildegarde Zagorski, a market analyst at Prudential-Bache
Securities Inc. in New York.

<HEAD>Hechinger's Buying 47 Bradlees Leases</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hechinger Co. said Tuesday it agreed to
purchase 47 Bradlees Discount Department Store leases from Stop &
Shop Cos., Inc. for about $118 million.
   About half the Bradlees stores, located in the densely populated
corrider linking Philadelphia, Baltimore and Washington, D.C., will
be remodeled and opened as Hechinger stores, according to company
spokeswoman Pam McMillan. The rest, because they are located close
to existing Hechinger stores, will be rented out to other retailers.
   ``Stop and Shop was only willing to sell the leases as a
package,'' McMillan explained. ``But the locations are very
lucrative, and a number of retailers have already shown an interest
in renting in these locations.''
   The agreement did not include the purchase of any inventory,
fixtures or other Bradlees assets by Hechinger, said John W.
Hechinger and Richard England, co-chairmen of the chain of
do-it-yourself retail home improvement centers.
   Hechinger, which is based just outside the nation's capital, has
73 stores operating on the eastern seaboard and will expand by
about 32 percent with the transaction.
   ``The growth of the area in terms of number of homes and
household income makes it one of the prime markets for
do-it-yourself retailing in the United States,'' England and
Hechinger said in a statement.
   They said the acquisition would be financed out of existing
working capital.
   Hechinger reported sales of $725.1 million, up 23 percent, and
earnings of $40 million, up 41 percent, in the year ended Jan. 30,
1988.
   Stop & Shop began to sell some of its stores earlier this year
after it went private in a $1.23 billion leveraged buyout led by
the investment firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co.

<TEXT>
   Hewlett-Packard Co. is impressing
customers, if not Wall Street, with new computers and appears on
the way to its goal of $10 billion in annual sales entering its
50th year of business in 1989.
   At a meeting of more than 2,000 customers in Florida last week,
Hewlett-Packard enjoyed a wealth of plaudits for its Spectrum line
of minicomputers.
   That wealth, though, hasn't yet affected Hewlett-Packard's stock
price, which plunged $1.50 a share Tuesday to a new low for the
year, $45.87{. Hewlett-Packard's 52-week high was $73.62{.
   ``This is clearly a huge panic on the technology stocks in fear
of inflation and recession in 1989,'' said Adam Cuhney of Kidder,
Peabody & Co. ``There isn't a lot of substantive reason to see a
derailment of good high-tech companies like Hewlett-Packard.''
   John A. Young, Hewlett-Packard's president and chief executive
officer, scared investors with gloomy comments in June about U.S.
orders in the third quarter, the effects of higher prices for
scarce dynamic random access memory chips and a Defense Department
freeze on certain orders.
   The higher cost of DRAM chips led to a price increase of up to
25 percent for some of Hewlett-Packard's computer memories in July.
   Hewlett-Packard is scheduled to report its third-quarter
earnings on Wednesday.
   Cuhney is forecasting a 24 percent rise in revenue for the third
quarter and profits of 87 cents per share versus 57 cents per share
last year.
   That's a little higher than most other forecasts. Jeff Canin of
Hambrecht & Quist Inc. said the market is worried Hewlett-Packard's
domestic bookings won't match last year's record $1.19 billion.
   Cuhney said he expected a 3 percent rise in U.S. orders and a 34
percent rise in foreign orders. ``Just to be up 3 percent on the
U.S. side is a major accomplishment, considering the strength of
last year's U.S. sales in the third quarter.''
   As it approaches the half-century mark, Hewlett-Packard is
stepping up its assault on computer giants Digital Equipment Corp.
and International Business Machines Corp. while using a $1.5
billion hoard to invest in small companies and buy back stock.
   Hewlett-Packard agreed last week to buy 10 percent of Octel
Communications Corp., a voice-messaging firm in Milpitas, Calif.,
for about $27 million. On Monday, Hewlett-Packard said it had
formed a partnership with Telecom Australia.
   Both were relatively small deals, but indicative of
Hewlett-Packard's move away from its traditional base in scientific
instruments.
   ``Those are strictly strategic moves and don't mean the company
is going on a buying binge,'' Cuhney said.
   Adds Canin: ``For all intents and purposes, Hewlett-Packard is a
computer company today with a very impressive line.''
   Two weeks ago, Hewlett-Packard announced several changes in its
top-level management to reflect the rising importance of its
worldwide computer business, which accounted for $5 billion of the
company's $8.1 billion overall revenue last year.
   Hewlett-Packard is expanding in all directions, making
terminals, personal computers, engineering workstations, networks,
laser printers, software and minicomputers while maintaining its
reputation for quality medical and scientific instruments.
   Hewlett-Packard even brought in former Pittsburgh Steelers
quarterback Terry Bradshaw, teammate Lynn Swann and Coach Chuck
Noll for a football rally-type talk to nearly 800 salesmen.
   Young bet the company a few years ago on the promise of
Spectrum, which is based on a technology called Risc, or reduced
instruction-set computing.
   Risc relies on much fewer circuit elements than traditional
designs, such as Digital's Vax, and should make it easier for
Hewlett-Packard to engineer compatible Spectrum models of different
sizes. The technology also gives users more bang for the buck.
   In its 49th year, Hewlett-Packard has added about 1,000
engineering, marketing and sales personnel to reach 83,000 workers
worldwide. That's still about 1,000 workers less than its 1985
peak, when the company trimmed down with voluntary severance and
retirement programs to cope with an industry slowdown.

   Bargain-hunting investors rescued the stock
market from another decline Tuesday, boosting prices in a moderate
rally that overcame the effects of bad news about the nation's
swollen trade deficit.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks, which fell 33.25
points Monday to its lowest close in nearly three months, recovered
about half the loss by the end of trading, up 17.24 to 2,021.51.
Broader market indicators also advanced.
   Brokers called the rally largely a technical reaction to the
market's recent declines based on fear of rising interest rates,
which erodes the relative worth of stocks. Between Aug. 3 and
Monday, the Dow average had fallen 129.79 points, raising the
prospects for at least a partial rebound.
   Stocks, bonds and the dollar's value initially fell when the
Commerce Department reported a larger-than-expected June trade
deficit of $12.5 billion, which suggested the U.S. currency would
have to decline to make U.S. products more competitive and
discourage America's relentless appetite for imports.
   But the impact of the trade report was reversed by investors who
quickly stepped in to buy stocks when prices reached what appeared
to be bargain levels, brokers said.
   ``I would describe this as a technical bounceback from an
oversold condition,'' said William R. Rothe, managing director and
head of over-the-counter trading at the Baltimore-based brokerage
Alex. Brown & Sons Inc.
   Hildegarde Zagorski, an analyst at Prudential-Bache Securities
Inc. in New York, said the stock market followed the behavior of
the dollar and bond markets, which also rallied after an initial
decline on the trade news. But she remained skeptical about the
immediate outlook for stocks.
   ``Now the question is, do we continue from here or do we come
crashing back down or go down a little bit?,'' she said. ``I don't
know the answer to that.''
   In composite trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks,
advancing issues outnumbered declines by about an 8-to-5 margin,
with 884 up, 579 down and 509 unchanged.
   Volume on the NYSE floor totaled 162.79 million shares, up from
128.56 million in the previous session. Nationwide, consolidated
volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trading at regional
exchanges and on the over-the-counter market, totaled 188.08
million shares.
   Among prominent blue-chip stocks, IBM rose | to 115}, Philip
Morris rose 1} to 90{, Minnesota Mining rose 1\ to 60| and

the company received government permission to buy more stock,
although Polaroid said it planned to remain independent.
   U.S. Shoe, which rose 5~ Monday on news that it will consider a

   Nationwide, the Wilshire Associates Equity Index, the market
value of NYSE, American and OTC issues, rose by $13.96 billion.
   The NYSE composite index of all listed issues rose 0.91 to
147.49.
   Standard & Poor's index of 400 industrials rose 2.03 to 299.31,

   DeLaurentiis Entertainment Group
Inc., which has been struggling for months after a string of movie
flops, on Tuesday sought protection from creditors under Chapter 11
of the federal bankruptcy laws.
   The move had been expected since Friday, when the company
founded by Italian moviemaker Dino DeLaurentiis revealed it had
failed to negotiate a debt swap with bondholders that it had termed
essential for survival.
   The company _ maker of the movies ``Crimes of the Heart'' and
``Weeds'' and the television miniseries ``Noble House'' _ has sold
assets and sought to restructure debt in order to stay in business.
   The company hasn't reported financial results for 1987, but has
released estimates of a $69 million loss.
   DeLaurentiis himself, who owns 61.9 percent of the compnay's
stock, stepped down from management in February.
   Stephen Greenwald, chairman and chief executive officer,
declined comment through a spokesman.
   Under Chapter 11, the company continues to operate under
supervision of a federal bankruptcy judge, in an attempt to pay
creditors and reorganize. Filing of a Chapter 11 petition
immediately puts the company's debts on hold.
   In announcing the filing in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Los
Angeles, the company didn't list assets and liabilities.
   After coming to the United States in the early 1970s,
DeLaurentiis was responsible for several movie successes, including
``Serpico'' and a remake of ``King Kong,'' before taking
DeLaurentiis Entertainment Group public with a stock offering in
March 1986.
   The company produced such box office non-starters as the $25
million ``Tai Pan'' and the $21 million ``King Kong Lives,'' a
sequel to the ``King Kong'' remake. An attempt to promote ``Million
Dollar Mystery'' by entering moviegoers in a million dollar
sweepstakes failed to bring in box office gold.
   Another company strategy was to sell videocassette and pay-TV
rights to a movie before it was released, in hopes of reaching the
break-even point before a movie hit the theaters. But the advance
revenue often didn't cover advertising and distribution costs,
which can run as high as the cost of producing a movie.
   ``I am profoundly saddened to hear that DEG has been forced into
bankruptcy,'' Dino DeLaurentiis said in a news release. ``I
sincerely hope ... the company can be revived for the benefit of
the shareholders, creditors and other investors.''
   The debt swap offer that failed last week would have
dramatically reduced the company's $65 million bond debt by trading
existing bonds for stock and bonds with terms more favorable to
DeLaurentiis. The company hasn't revealed how many bondholders
agreed to accept the offer, other than to call the response
disappointing.
   Sale of DeLaurentiis' library of 300 films, including ``The
Graduate'' and ``Carnal Knowledge,'' to British financier Michael
Stevens brought $54 million in July. The company earlier sold its
share in an Australian film distributor for $7 million.
   The company previously announced an agreement for a new line of
credit with the European bank Credit Lyonnais, but didn't reveal
the amount.
   The bankruptcy filing doesn't include DeLaurentiis Entertainment
Group subsidiaries North Carolina Film Studios Inc. or Onyx
Entertainment Inc., the company's newly formed production company.
   Also unaffected by the filing is an affiliated limited
partnership, DeLaurentiis Film Partners.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar made an impressive recovery against
major foreign currencies Tuesday, overcoming the negative impact of
a wider-than-expected U.S. trade deficit for June.
   Gold prices finished lower after rising in the Far East and
Europe. Republic Bank of New York quoted a bid price for gold of
$428.80 a troy ounce as of 4 p.m. EDT, down from $432.35 late
Monday.
   The dollar plunged in hectic trading after the Commerce
Department reported that the trade gap widened to $12.5 billion in
June from a revised $9.8 billion in May. The U.S. currency fell as
low as 1.8600 West German marks but later bounced back and advanced
steadily.
   By the end of the trading day in New York, the dollar had
rebounded to 1.8893 marks, up from 1.8805 marks late Monday.
   Analysts said that after a closer look at the June trade report,
dealers were heartened by the downward revision of the May figure
from the previously reported $10.9 billion shortfall.
   The dollar also was bolstered, traders said, by a recovery in
bonds and stocks, as the Dow Jones average of 30 industrials
advanced 17.24 points to 2,021.51.
   ``That absolutely had an effect,'' said Zlatko Glamuzina, chief
currency dealer in the New York office of Italy's Banco di Sicilia.
   Some traders said the strong buying interest in the dollar
likely would establish a solid base for the currency in the near
future.
   Keith Dipple, chief dealer at Banque Francaise de Commerce
Exterieure, said the dollar's comparatively muted response to the
trade report indicates the market now moves more in reaction to
interest rates than economic indicators.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends as Europe's business day begins,
the dollar rose 0.13 Japanese yen to close at 133.08 yen. Later, in
London, it was quoted at 132.85 yen. By the end of trading in New
York, the U.S. currency had jumped to 133.73 yen, up from 133.32
yen late Monday.
   In London, it cost $1.7190 to buy one British pound, more
expensive than $1.7145 late Monday. Later, in New York, the pound
was quoted at $1.7037, cheaper than late Monday's $1.7145.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Monday's
rates, included: 1.5870 Swiss francs, up from 1.5790; 6.4035 French
francs, up from 6.3760; 1,399.45 Italian lire, up from 1,394.75;
and 1.2275 Canadian dollars, up from 1.2270.
   Late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Monday: 1.8705
West German marks, down from 1.8810; 1.5705 Swiss francs, down from
1.5780; 6.3390 French francs, down from 6.3780; 2.1065 Dutch
guilders, down from 2.1257; 1,384.50 Italian lire, down from
1,398.00, and 1.2275 Canadian dollars, up from 1.2196.
   Gold rose in London to a late bid price of $431.25 a troy ounce,
compared with Monday's late bid of $430.40. In Zurich, Switzerland,
gold was higher, closing at a bid $433, up from $431 late Monday.
   Earlier in Hong Kong, gold rose 41 cents to close at a bid
$434.21.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current delivery
fell to $428.90 a troy ounce from $433 late Monday.
   Silver bullion prices rose in London, where the metal traded at
a late bid price of $6.77 a troy ounce, up from Monday's $6.72.
   On New York's Comex, silver for current delivery dropped to
$6.610 a troy ounce from $6.757 late Monday.

<HEAD>Silver Futures Plummet In Trade Gap Reaction</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Silver futures prices plunged Tuesday on New York's Commodity
Exchange, falling about 15 cents a troy ounce amid speculation that
a widening in the nation's merchandise trade deficit was not
necessarily inflationary.
   On other markets, crop futures mostly were lower; livestock and
meat futures were mixed; oil futures slipped; and stock-index
futures advanced.
   Analysts said the Commerce Department's morning report that the
U.S. trade gap had jumped to $12.5 billion in June after narrowing
for three consecutive months initially was viewed by
precious-metals traders as a harbinger of higher inflation.
Accordingly, gold and silver futures opened moderately higher in
New York.
   But the market later turned around as traders began focusing on
the fact that exports dropped slightly, which analysts said
apparently indicated that U.S. industrial production was not
expanding as rapidly as many had believed. That could mean the
threat of higher inflation may be less than many had feared.
   The dollar, which initially had weakened on the trade news,
reversed its course in mid-afternoon and the metals quickly
followed suit, led by silver.
   The trade deficit figure ``doesn't give you the impression the
economy is very hot,'' said John Norris, chief trader of precious
metals with Citibank in New York.
   Norris said another government report showing U.S. factories
operating last month at 83.5 percent of capacity _ a nearly 8{-year
high _ could be viewed as inflationary.
   But the notion that the Federal Reserve would raise interest
rates further to combat inflation overshadowed the factory report
and minimized its impact on the inflation-sensitive metals markets,
he said.
   William O'Neill, director of research with Elders Futures Inc.
in New York, said the rise in imports noted by the report could
reduce some of the capacity pressure on U.S. factories.
   ``If you look at the trade figure, it's not as inflationary as
the initial reaction to it might have seemed,'' O'Neill said.
   Gold settled $4.10 lower across the board with the contract for
delivery in August at $428.90 a troy ounce; silver was 15 cents to
15.4 cents lower with September at $6.635 a troy ounce.
   Grain and soybean futures closed mostly lower Tuesday on the
Chicago Board of Trade amid slack export demand and forecasts for
showers and cooler temperatures in the Corn Belt later this week.
   The corn market finished sharply lower and was the leader in a
session that featured relatively light trading and wide price
swings in the soybean pit.
   Intense heat hit Midwestern croplands again Tuesday but
meteorologists predicted cooler temperatures would begin moving
into the region by Thursday. The forecasts, plus a lack of
substantial export business, left the markets with little bullish
news.
   Wheat settled 1{ cents to 4{ cents lower with September at
$3.90{ a bushel; corn was 5{ cents to 10\ cents lower with
September at $2.87 a bushel; oats were 4{ cents to 10 cents lower
with September at $2.77{ a bushel; soybeans were 21{ cents lower to
5 cents higher with August at $8.65{ a bushel.
   Cattle futures finished mixed while pork futures mostly were
lower on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Expectations of slackening demand for beef offset strong bullish
fundamentals, including higher cash cattle prices and an
Agriculture Department showing an unexpectedly large number of
feedlot-fattened cattle sold for slaughter last month, said Philip
Stanley, an analyst in Chicago with Thomson McKinnon Securities Inc.
   Live cattle settled .72 cent lower to .45 cent higher with
August at 70.05 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .15 cent lower to
.20 cent higher with August at 81.95 cents a pound; hogs were .05
cent to .63 cent lower with August at 47.17 cents a pound; frozen
pork bellies were .63 cent lower to .22 cent higher with August at
33.87 cents a pound.
   Oil futures prices declined in light trading on the New York
Mercantile Exchange in advance of an American Petroleum Institute
report released after the market's close. The report showed crude
oil stocks fell by 3.6 million barrels, gasoline inventories rose
1.5 million barrels and distillate stocks rose 1.4 million barrels
in the past week.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 11 cents to 15 cents
lower with September at $15.49 a barrel; heating oil was .19 cent
to .37 cent lower with September at 44.03 cents a gallon; unleaded
gasoline was .22 cent to .30 cent lower with September at 46.11
cents a gallon.

<HEAD>No Immediate Talks Seen In Auto Workers Strike Against AM General</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By THOMAS P. WYMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SOUTH BEND, Ind. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Striking autoworkers and management of
LTV Corp.'s AM General Division stayed away from the bargaining
table Tuesday in the second day of a strike at two military vehicle
assembly plants.
   Both sides said there would be no immediate resumption of talks
to end the walkout that began when a contract extension expired at
midnight Sunday. But a union leader and a company spokesman said a
long strike could prove costly.
   The action has idled nearly 1,400 workers and halted production
at plants in South Bend, where military trucks are assembled, and
in neighboring Mishawaka, which produces the Hummer, the Army's
multi-purpose light vehicle.
   Larry Fluke, the financial secretary of UAW Local 5, said the
strike was not related to AM General's decision last month to close
the South Bend plant and eliminate 400 hourly jobs and 150 salaried
positions. Workers agreed to a six-week contract extension in late
June; talks broke off Sunday night.
   ``Obviously, we're unhappy about the plant closing, but we
didn't negotiate from that basis,'' said Fluke. ``It's not a
get-even type of thing.''
   AM General President George A. Maddox said the plant would be
closed because the division could not afford to compete for new
truck contracts in the 1990s. LTV is protected from its creditors
under Chapter 11 of federal bankruptcy laws.
   Wilbur Berry, the local's unit chairman, said a federal mediator
might be called if talks remain stalled. He said the two sides
remain divided over wages, severance benefits for workers losing
their jobs, and ``just a lot of things.''
   AM General spokesman Craig Mac Nab said management would
continue to follow its policy of not discussing the negotiations
that began in April.
   Mac Nab said an extended strike could jeopardize AM General's
chances of winning a renewal contract for the Hummer. The
division's reputation as a reliable supplier of military trucks to
foreign buyers could also be hurt, he said.
   Earlier this monthy, LTV Corp. reported a second-quarter net
profit of $157.6 million, up 28 percent over 1987. The 1988
quarterly statement included a $30 million, one-time charge for the
shutdown of the South Bend plant.
   The earnings of LTV's missile and electronics group, which
includes AM General, dropped nearly 50 percent over the second
quarter of 1987, earning $12.9 million on sales of $403 million.
The company earned $23.2 million on sales of $407 in the 1987
quarter. The decline was due to falling military truck sales, the
company said.
   The Dallas-based corporation's steel unit also operates a
factory in East Chicago.

<HEAD>Pan Am Renews Threat to Sell Assets, Union Official Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pan Am Corp. has renewed its threat to sell some
of its assets in the wake of stalled negotiations between the
ailing airline and its biggest union, a union official said Tuesday.
   In a meeting Tuesday with leaders of the Transport Workers
union, Pan Am Chairman Thomas Plaskett said the carrier will sell
its South American routes, according to union spokesman Jim Gannon.
He said Plaskett made the statement during a meeting in which
negotiations broke down on a new Pan Am contract with the Transport
Workers.
   The talks ended in deadlock, and the union plans to file for
federal mediation on Wednesday, Gannon said.
   Pan Am declined comment on the talks. Spokeswoman Pamela Hanlon
would confirm only that the meeting took place.
   Last Thursday, members of the Transport Workers voted by a large
margin to reject a contract agreed on in July by the union's
leadership and Pan Am management. The move dealt the airline a
major setback in its efforts to cut labor costs.
   The proposed Transport Workers contract had called for a wage
freeze in return for Pan Am withdrawing its earlier threat to sell
assets. The airline, engaged in sporadic talks with the Transport
Workers since February, originally had sought a 10 percent cut in
wages.
   In Tuesday's meeting, Plaskett said the company would consider
any alternatives to the rejected wage freeze, but they still had to
achieve Pan Am's goal of saving $81 million over the next three
years, Gannon said.
   Pan Am, which lost $265.3 million last year, believes it needs
about $540 million over three years in pay cuts and other
concessions from its unions to turn itself around.
   The unions representing pilots and flight engineers have agreed
to cuts totaling about $240 million over three years, and Pan Am is
seeking $90 million in wage reductions from its flight attendants.
   The company has imposed $35 million in cuts on employees
represented by the Teamsters union, under federal labor rules.

<HEAD>Tentative Settlement Reached With Boise Woodworkers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WILLIAM C. CRUM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Boise Cascade Corp. reached a tentative
contract settlement Tuesday with 2,000 striking union woodworkers,
paving the way to resume production at 15 mills in Oregon,
Washington and Idaho.
   Mike Draper, executive secretary of the Western Council of
Industrial Workers, said the union was recommending acceptance of
the proposed agreement. Draper declined to discuss the details
pending a vote on Thursday.
   Draper said the vote would be counted Friday, and if the pact
was affirmed picket lines would come down immediately, he said.
   ``We will be available to go work at any time,'' Draper said.
   The union members walked off their jobs at Boise Cascade in
mid-June, shortly after the beginning of a regional timber strike
that eventually idled about 7,900 workers in five states.
   The unions are seeking restoration of wages and benefits cut in
negotiations two years ago. They want contracts modeled on one
reached early this summer with Bohemia Inc. of Eugene, which
restores wages and benefits over four years.
   Draper said Boise Cascade mills affected by the agreement are in
Oregon in Independence, St. Helens, La Grande, Elgin and Joseph; in
Washington in Goldendale and Yakima; and in Idaho in Emmett,
Council and Cascade.
   The regional strike by the Western Council and by the
International Woodworkers of America-U.S. began June 6.
   It ultimately spread to major companies including Willamette
Industries Inc. and Champion International Corp.
   Other major regional wood products companies, including
Weyerhaeuser Co. and Georgia-Pacific Corp., were threatened by
walkouts.
   The unions settled last week with Willamette Industries, and
1,275 workers returned on Monday to their jobs at 13 Willamette
mills in Oregon.
   Workers remained off their jobs at mills operated by Champion,
Simpson Timber Co., DAW Forest Products Inc., WI Forest Products
Inc., Lakeview Lumber Co. and Morgan Products Ltd. in Northern
California, Oregon, Washington, Idaho and Montana.
