   Panamanian officials granted the United States
permission to seize a drug-carrying, Panamania-registered vessel
before the Coast Guard fired 60 rounds into its engine room,
officials said Saturday.
   The Encounter Bay, with a cargo of more than 50 tons of
marijuana and 18 crewmen were being taken to Seattle, where they
are expected to arrive Wednesday, Coast Guard spokesman Lt. Eldo
DeLong said.
   The incident took place Thursday night, several hundred miles
off the Washington coast in international waters, after a
patrolling Coast Guard C-130 aircraft reported a suspicious vessel,
and after permission to board the ship was granted by Panamanian
Embassy authorities.
   The Coast Guard cutter Boutwell opened fire with a .50-caliber
machine gun after repeated and varied efforts failed to stop the
180-foot vessel, said another Coast Guard spokesman, Petty Officer
1st Class Craig Herlihy.
   There were no reports of injuries.
   Authorities boarded the vessel and arrested the crew, DeLong
said. He said Guardsmen didn't know the marijuana was on board when
they tried to stop the vessel.
   The 18 crewmen were being held aboard the Boutwell, said Herlihy.
   The marijuana has an estimated street value of $220 million.
   DeLong said damage was minimal to the Encounter Bay, a converted
off-shore oil rig supply vessel, but it was being towed to Seattle
where it will be taken into U.S. Customs custody.

   Police fired tear gas grenades and rubber
bullets Sunday to disperse hundreds of stone-throwing Arabs on the
biblical Via Dolorosa in the walled Old City of Jerusalem.
   At least eight people were injured, witnesses said.
   Massive police reinforcements were rushed to the Old City.
Police closed its gates and major streets leading into it,
witnesses said.
   The riot was one of the most serious in Arab east Jerusalem
since the Palestinian uprising against Israeli rule started nearly
seven months ago. In the uprising, 215 Palestinians and four
Israelis have died.
   Sunday's violence began with a protest over an archaeological
excavation close to the Western Wall and the Temple Mount in the
Old City, according to Israeli officials and police reports.
   Dan Bahat, Jerusalem district archaeologist, told The Associated
Press that the dig began Sunday to clean part of the ancient
Hasmonean Tunnel, a 300-yard cave.
   But an Arab prayer leader called on Arabs to gather, claiming
authorities actually intended to dig a tunnel, Bahat and Arab
reports said.
   Bahat said the tunnel links the wall, the last remnant of the
ancient Jewish Temple, with the Via Dolorosa, which according to
Christian tradition was Jesus' route from Pilate's judgement hall
to Golgotha.

<DATELINE>TRAVIS AIR FORCE BASE, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Officials named three
additional sites where Soviet inspectors will monitor compliance
with the treaty to eliminate medium-range nuclear missiles.
   One group was to leave Travis early Sunday for a cruise missile
testing and training facility at Fort Huachuca, Ariz., about 60
miles south of Tucson, said Master Sgt. Richard Castillo, a
spokesman at Travis.
   Another group will visit Davis-Monthan Air Force Base near
Tucson, a missile training center that later will be an elimination
site where Soviets can monitor missile destruction, Castillio said.
   A third team will inspect the Pebulo Army Depot in Pebulo,
Colo., where Pershing II missiles are stored and repaired, he said.
   The Soviet teams are part of a contingent of 70 missile
specialists who arrived at Travis on Friday night.
   A group of 22 Soviet on-site inspectors was welcomed Saturday to
Salt Lake City to begin its spot check at the Hercules Aerospace
Co. missile plant in Magna, Utah, where Pershing II missiles banned
under the Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces Treaty were produced.
   A group of U.S. inspectors arrived in the Soviet Union on Friday
under the treaty signed by President Reagan and Soviet leader
Mikhail Gorbachev in December.
   The INF pact, the first to allow such on-site inspection, is
viewed as a trial for the proposed Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty,
which would slash arsenals of long-range superpower nuclear weapons
by 30 percent to 50 percent, and involve much more complicated
verification procedures.

   A strong earthquake shook northern Taiwan
on Sunday. Police said it unleashed rockslides that injured 13
people.
   They said the injured people were hit by falling rocks at three
waterfall tourist sites in suburban Taipei.
   The quake, measuring 5.5 on the Richter scale, set off rock
avalanches in an area covering 1,200 square yards, authorities said.
   The injured, who were all Taiwanese, were taken to a hospital,
police said. One was reported to be in serious condition, and the
others suffered only minor injuries.
   The Central Weather Bureau placed the epicenter of the
early-afternoon earthquake in Sanchi, a coastal village about 10
miles north of Taipei.
   The earthquake was felt in the capital, where residents reported
their houses shook violently, the bureau said.
   The Richter scale measures ground motion as recorded on
seismographs. Every increase of one number means a ten-fold
increase in intensity.
   An earthquake of magnitude 5 can cause serious damage in a
populated area, and one of magnitude 6 can cause severe damage.

p.m. departure to Paris and Karachi, Pakistan, was already
airborne, said Port Authority Police Officer Michael Palermo.
   The airline was notified and the pilot decided to return to New
York, Palermo said. The plane touched down just before 2:30 a.m.,
he said.
   The passengers were taken off the plane while the craft and the
luggage were searched.
   Passengers were expected to reboard and resume their flight

   An explosion rocked a steel mill in western Japan
on Sunday, killing four workers and injuring 30 others, police
reported.
   They said six of the injured were severely poisoned with carbon
monoxide gas.
   A police official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the
blast occurred at the Kure plant of Nisshin Steel Co., a
blast-furnace steel producer.
   The cause of the explosion, which destroyed a fuel pipe, was
under investigation.
   The carbon monoxide gas dispersed without affecting residents of
Kure, which is about a half mile from the plant, the official said.
   Toshiaki Kawatoko, a spokesman for Nisshin Steel, told The
Associated Press that 34 employees, including engineers, were
working at a new furnace when the explosion occurred. The blast did
not start a fire, he said.
   Nisshin Steel makes about 3 million tons of steel products a
year.

   GARMISCH-PARTENKIRCHEN, West Germany (AP) _ A West German army
helicopter slammed into a cliff and crashed in a wooded area
Sunday. As many as eight people were feared dead, police said.
   Hesse state radio in Frankfurt reported that 13 people were on
board the helicopter and that all were probably dead.
   The number of people actually aboard the aircraft could not be
immediately determined.
   Rescue teams were on their way to the crash scene near the
Bavarian resort community of Garmisch-Partenkirchen, police said.
   A spokesman for the West German army in Mittenwald, 12 miles
east of Garmisch-Partenkirchen, said the helicopter had exploded.
The weather was rainy and foggy when the accident occurred in the
mountainous area, the army spokesman said.
   The helicopter took off at about 10 a.m. from army barracks near
Mittenwald.
   Hikers in the area saw the helicopter explode, a Defense
Ministry spokesman said in Bonn. The aircraft, identified as a Bell
UH-1-D, apparently slammed into a cliff, said the spokesman, who
asked not to be identified.

   A policeman who was supposed to be dead
turned up alive and was arrested along with his wife and son after
they tried to collect $5,400 in benefits, the United News of India
said Sunday.
   The news agency reported that Constable Ganesh Singh, from the
town of Balaghat in Madhya Pradesh state, went on leave two weeks
before his retirement June 1.
   A few days later, his son told authorities Singh had died of a
heart attack. A sum of 70,000 rupees, about $5,400, was granted to
the constable's family because the man died in service.
   But before his family was able to cash in, a police officer
spotted Singh strolling around the Balaghat railway station.
   The constable confessed he, his wife and son had plotted his
``death'' because benefits for a policeman dying in service were
higher than normal retirement pensions.

<HEAD>China Announces Debut Of More Powerful Rocket</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   China announced it has developed a new, more
powerful rocket in its successful Long March series and said it
soon will launch a meteorological satellite into space.
   The new Long March 4 has a propelling power of 300 tons and the
capability of putting a 2.5-ton payload into orbit, the official
Xinhua News Agency said late Saturday.
   Aeronautics officials hope the new rocket will help attract more
foreign customers for China's nearly 3-year-old satellite launch
service, which despite cut-rate prices has only one customer under
contract.
   China has launched 22 of its own satellites in the past 18 years
using the Long March 1, 2 and 3 rockets.
   Most recently, the Long March 3 sent a communications satellite
into orbit that China said would double domestic communications
capacity.
   The Long March 3 was introduced in April 1984. It can put up to
1.4-ton load in long-distance orbit and up to 3 tons in
low-altitude orbit.
   The Xinhua report quoted Chen Shouchun, chief engineer of the
Great Wall Industrial Corp., China's launch company, as saying the
No. 3 rocket uses advanced low-temperature technology applied in
only a few other countries.
   He did not give any details about the new Long March 4.
   Xinhua said in November that scientists had modified the Long
March 3 to nearly double its launch capabilities. It was not clear
if that modified version was the same as the Long March 4.
   China announced its international launch service in October
1985, hoping to take advantage of the halt in the U.S. space
shuttle and European launching programs caused by accidents.
   The Great Wall Industrial Corp. has reported numerous inquiries
from potential foreign customers, but only one, Sweden Space Co.,
has signed a formal contract.
   China agreed in December to launch a scientific and
telecommunications satellite for Sweden using the Long March 2. No
date has been set.
   Last month, China signed a tentative agreement with a consortium
of three Chinese, British and Hong Kong companies to launch a
communications satellite to serve Asia.
   Similar non-binding launch agreements with two U.S. companies,
Teresat Inc. And Pan American Pacific Corp., subsequently fell
through.

   Prime Minister David Lange was
admitted to a hospital after suffering chest pains, according to a
statement issued by his office Sunday.
   Doctors at Green Lane Hospital in Auckland said Sunday that
Lange's condition was comfortable but that he was likely to remain
in the hospital for several days. A hospital spokesman said Lange
did not suffer a heart attack.
   Lange, 45, was suffering from a heavy bout of influenza last
week and experienced associated chest pains later, Mike Wicksteed,
Lange's press officer, said.
   Deputy Prime Minister Geoffrey Palmer cut short a trip and
returned home at Lange's request. Palmer went directly to the
hospital to visit Lange after flying into Auckland on Sunday and
told reporters the prime minister was in good spirits.
   ``The prime minister is expected to remain in hospital for
several days and return to work in one or two weeks with no
limitations imposed on his activities,'' the hospital spokesman
said.

   The legislature of the Soviet Union sent July
Fourth greetings Sunday to President Reagan and Americans and said
the world looks forward to improved relations between the
superpowers.
   Also Sunday, the Communist Party newspaper Pravda accused Vice
President George Bush of favoring Cold War policies toward the
Kremlin.
   The Presidium, or executive committee, of the Supreme Soviet,
sent Reagan a telegram extending ``congratulations and wishes of
peace and well-being to the American people.''
   The Tass news agency reported that the message referred to
``important and fruitful results'' of the December summit between
Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev and their meeting in
Moscow in late May and early June.
   The message cited the new treaty eliminating superpower
shorter-and medium-range nuclear missiles and progress on efforts
to cut strategic nuclear weapons as fruits of ``the constructive
Soviet-American dialogue whose continuation and deepening are being
awaited by the entire world.''
   But commentator Vladislav Drobkov wrote in Pravda that
presidental candidate Bush still believed in Cold War policies
between the United States and Soviet Union.
   Pravda said it could not understand why Bush would ``draw such
gloomy perspectives of further development of ties between our two
countries.''

<DATELINE>LEVOCA, Czechoslovakia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   At least 100,000 Slovak Roman
Catholics converged on a remote hillside Sunday in a show of
religious strength 40 years after the Communist takeover.
   The pilgrims thronged the Virgin Mary Church in Levoca, an
eastern Slovak town of 11,000 about 25 miles from the Polish
border. Some said they walked up to 125 miles.
   Pilgrims and some independent observers said that up to 200,000
people may have attended the pilgrimage, which began Friday and is
an annual event started more than 200 years ago.
   ``Interest in religion before our very eyes is growing,'' Stefan
Garaj, the apostolic administrator of Spiss diocese, told the crowd
at an open air Mass.
   Thousands arrived Friday and stayed through Sunday for 20 hours
of Masses, prayer sessions and singing that climaxed with Sunday's
open air Mass.
   Czechoslovakia's Catholics have been buoyed by the recent
consecration of two auxiliary bishops in Prague and bishop Jan
Sokol in Trnava, Slovakia's largest diocese.
   The church has also been strengthened by a petition signed by
about 600,000 people calling for religious freedom and the
appointment of new bishops.
   About 60 percent of the 15.5 million residents of Czechoslovakia
are Roman Catholics, according to church officials. Most of them
are Slovaks.
   Garaj hailed Pope John Paul II as ``the greatest pilgrim of our
century.'' The pope was not at the pilgrimage.
   Many worshipers spent the night in tents.
   Elderly Slovak women knelt in the mud hours after a downpour had
soaked the ground. Groups of young people trekked up and down the
hill led by youths carrying wooden crosses.
   Attendance at the Levoca pilgrimage dropped during the 1950s but
began to pick up again in 1968 during a brief liberalization
attempt in Czechoslovakia. It was crushed when Soviet tanks
intervened. Attendance has been growing since then.
   Police watched the crowd climb the hill on three different treks
but did not interfere. An unspecified number of plainclothes police
were said to be observing the rites.
   The recent appointment of bishops came after 15 years in which
the Prague government and the Vatican failed to agree on candidates
acceptable to both sides.
   None of the three new bishops is a member of Pacem in Terris, a
pro-government clergymen's organization banned by the Vatican.

   Shanghai soccer players punched and shoved a
referee who penalized a teammate, and police had to break up the
brawl, an official newspaper reported.
   Authorities have not decided what penalty to impose on the
players, the Shanghai newspaper Liberation Daily said in its
Saturday edition, seen Sunday in Beijing. It did not say if any
were arrested.
   The report said the fight broke out June 29 during a game
between the Shanghai Diesel Engine Factory team and a military team.
   The game was tied 1-1 when referee Tang Jaikang penalized a
member of the factory team for rushing at the legs of an opponent
and knocking him down as he tried to score.
   A teammate of the penalized man punched Tang, and other
teammates joined in, the paper said. When Tang broke away, one
player chased the referee and knocked him in the stomach and
injured him.
   Game officials expelled those who attacked Tang and tried to
resume play but the penalized players seized the ball and began
running with it, the paper said. Police finally arrived and ended
the mayhem, and the game was called off.

<HEAD>Democrats Unusually Unified Heading Into Convention</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID ESPO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Political Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Think of recent Democratic National
Conventions. Sweet harmony doesn't exactly spring to mind.
   More like bitter divisions that spilled over into street battles
in Chicago 20 years ago. Or the last-ditch floor fight that Sen.
Edward M. Kennedy waged against President Carter in 1980. Or a
nasty little firefight over selection of a new party chairman four
years ago that weakened Walter F. Mondale almost on the eve of his
nomination.
   But this time officials in Michael Dukakis' campaign and other
Democrats, pointing to quick work on platform, rules and
credentials issues, say they expect to present a unified front to
their four-day prime-time television audience beginning on July 18.
Barring an unexpected disruption by Jesse Jackson or his supporters
over the selection of a vice presidential running mate, of course.
   ``The party is as unified as it has been since 1964, and that
was when you had an incumbent president,'' says Paul Kirk,
Democratic party chairman _ and the man who managed Kennedy's
unsuccessful campaign in 1980.
   Kirk's view is semi-shared by Eddie Mahe, a Republican political
consultant. ``They are willing to subordinate any and all personal
and interest group agendas in the interests of victory,'' he says
of this year's Democrats.
   But Mahe added that Democratic unity is likely to prove
short-lived and that special interests will reassert themselves if
Dukakis wins the White House in the fall.
   ``The day they win, Katie bar the door,'' he said.
   That's a problem Democrats will worry about if and when the time
comes.
   Dukakis has made a number of largely symbolic concessions to
Jackson since the primary season ended, and party officials are
crowing about the relatively smooth transition between the primary
campaign and the convention.
   Jackson, who will have the support of more 1,100 delegates at
the convention, has said repeatedly that he deserves a vice
presidential offer, and that he has decided whether he would accept
one but won't say what his decision is. He and his wife will have
dinner at the Dukakis' Massachusetts home on Monday, and the topic
of the vice presidency is expected to come up.
   Dukakis is widely expected by his aides to select a different
running mate, and the Massachusetts governor frequently quotes
Jackson's earlier statements that a nominee is entitled to make his
own pick.
   Other Democrats say they doubt Jackson will raise a furor if he
is passed over, although there has been no clue about what might
happen if Dukakis chooses a political partner whom Jackson finds
offensive.
   ``I think he has been and will be very positive no matter what
happens,'' said Rep. Richard Gephardt, the Missouri congressman who
challenged for the presidential nomination last winter.
   With the exception of the vice presidential nomination, this
year's Democratic campaign has been remarkably free of the types of
disputes that produced divisions in earlier conventions.
   This year:
   _ Dukakis wrapped up the nomination on the final day of the
primaries, and unlike in 1980 and 1984 no one has questioned his
control over a majority of delegates.
   Jackson has continued to campaign publicly, occasionally sniping
at the Massachusetts governor, but thus far has never suggested
summoning his forces for an all-out fight such as the one Kennedy
waged in 1980.
   The other, losing contenders generally have endorsed Dukakis
warmly and most of them are expected to speak at the convention,
although Gary Hart will be in Atlanta writing a newspaper column
and offering commentary for an Italian television audience.
   _ Democratic draftsmen came up with the shortest platform in
decades, in keeping with Dukakis' desires and Kirk's hope of
avoiding a ``litany of social, cultural or ideological buzzwords.''
   Dukakis yielded to Jackson on some issues, notably his desire to
brand South Africa a terrorist state and his call for periodic
increases in the federal minimum wage to keep pace with inflation.
   Jackson has described the platform as bland, and his aides have
filed a dozen minority planks for possible votes at the convention.
But Kirk says, ``If there are planks that will be discussed and
debated it will be a civil agreement to disagree.''
   Dukakis aides sound almost like they welcome a floor vote to
demonstrate their stand against higher taxes and a Pentagon freeze,
two key Jackson demands. ``There may be some fights and that's a
normal part of the process and Michael Dukakis will stick to his
position,'' says Leslie Dach, the campaign's communications
director.
   _ Dukakis agreed to several concessions sought by Jackson on
party rules covering the 1992 campaign. That mollified Jackson
without costing this year's winner anything. Dukakis will not care
about the selection of delegates in 1992 if he loses this year _
and won't have to worry about it if he wins and is running for
re-election.
   Thus, he agreed to a sharp reduction in the number of automatic
super delegates who will attend the 1992 convention, the party
officials who have overwhelmingly favored Dukakis this year. He
also consented to Jackson's demand to award all other delegates in
1992 in proportion to the vote received in primaries.
   _ All potential credentials challenges were ironed out between
the Dukakis and Jackson forces, averting a floor fight. Jackson
picked up eight new delegates in New Jersey; six in Puerto Rico and
three in Kansas in the process. Most of them came from Dukakis, who
has more than he needs.

<HEAD>As Spending Limit Looms, Bush `Party Builds' and GOP Picks Up the
Tab</HEAD>

   George Bush was talking about crime and
politics and Democrats versus Republicans, sounding for all the
world like the presidential candidate he is.
   But something was missing _ there was no specific mention of his
Democratic rival, Michael Dukakis. The reason _ this New York
speech was not a campaign trip, it was a ``party building'' mission
paid for by the GOP.
   The semantic distinction _ in which Bush attacks liberals or
Democrats but not Dukakis by name _ has allowed the vice president
to take several trips on the Republican Party tab at a time when
his own campaign funds are virtually gone.
   Since the primaries ended June 7, Bush has taken nine
out-of-state swings, five of them at least partially financed by
the Republican National Committee.
   The practice is legal under Federal Election Commission
guidelines, but demonstrates a loophole the Bush camp has found to
keep his campaign in the public eye.
   Democrats accuse Bush of sleight of checkbook to circumvent the
law that places a $23 million ceiling on primary campaign spending.
   Bush is pushing the limit, having spent $21.3 million by the
beginning of June. He severely cut back on campaign spending to
avoid surpassing the cap before the Republican National Convention
Aug. 15-18.
   The RNC will be pitching in to help with expenses once the
convention declares Bush the nominee, but can give him no more than
$5,000 while he is still technically a primary candidate.
   That's where party building has come in handy. The RNC can spend
whatever it wants to help its GOP candidates and state party
organizations around the country.
   Such spending logically includes sending a sitting vice
president on speech-making tours to help promote the GOP cause,
says Bush spokeswoman Ede Holiday.
   ``He's got a proven track record as one of the best fund-raisers
in the Republican Party,'' she said, adding that the party would
utilize Bush even if he was not a presidential candidate.
   It's not so much his dual role, however, as the financial
arrangements that explain why sometimes his talks are peppered with
criticism of Dukakis, his certain opponent in November, and other
times laced only with general attacks on Democrats.
   Bush told the New York fund-raising luncheon on Thursday:
   ``I am under these constraints because this is a party-building
event. That means I cannot put in perspective the differences
between me and the man I'll be running against.''
   He then proceeded with a lively attack on liberals in a clearly
coded reference to Dukakis.
   ``You can call it party building, but it's campaigning,'' said
Democratic National Committee spokeswoman Julie Anbender. ``When
the vice president is the certain presidential nominee and is
traveling around the country, it is fairly evident that ... his
primary purpose is to promote his candidacy.''
   ``If he doesn't talk about his opponent, it's not a campaign
trip,'' countered Bush campaign attorney Trevor Potter. ``The
Republicans are being very careful not to do this one wrong. If
there's any question they allocate it to the campaign.''
   Once the Republican convention nominates him in August, Bush
will get an infusion of $46 million from the federal Treasury for
his campaign and the Democratic nominee will get the same amount.
In addition, the national parties are allowed to spend $8.3 million
each on their nominees.
   Even trips to raise the $8.3 million are not necessarily
considered campaign-related by the Republicans because the $8.3
million _ while designated to help elect Bush _ is party money
rather than campaign money, Potter said.
   Any RNC spending on Bush before the convention is not counted
against the $8.3 million because he is not the nominee yet.
   Despite Democratic frustration, the GOP practice ``is totally
within the statutes and the regulations,'' said Federal Election
Commission spokeswoman Sharon Snyder.
   She said the law ``recognizes the double or triple functions and
double or triple hats a that a candidate may wear.''
   The Bush forces are quick to point out that they are not
charging any of Bush's travel in this post-primary period to the
taxpayers, even when he is invited to speak in his vice
presidential capacity. In those cases, the campaign has scheduled
fund-raising events in the same state so the RNC can pick up the
tab.
   Even his Air Force Two plane expenses are charged to the
campaign to avoid charges of using his office.
   The campaign is particularly sensitive on the issue, Potter
said, in light of a complaint filed against President Reagan's
campaign when he charged a Veterans of Foreign Wars speech to the
White House budget rather than the campaign. The FEC decision that
there was no violation in that case is the subject of an ongoing
federal court case.

<HEAD>New Orleans: Not Just A Great Place To Party</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARY FOSTER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW ORLEANS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Six weeks before the Republican National
Convention, officials here are doing everything they can to avoid
the problems that have been reported in Atlanta, convention city of
the Democrats.
   City officials desperately want to show the world that New
Orleans is a good place to do business, not just a great place to
party.
   ``We have never had this kind of opportunity before and I think
the people have basically responded,'' said Mayor Sidney Barthelemy.
   After a rocky start, the civic machinery is humming along for
the Aug. 15-18 convention.
   In Atlanta, by contrast, persistent reports of poor planning and
confusion are marring the road to the July 18-21 Democratic
gathering. ``Not Ready For Prime Time'' barked the headline about
Atlanta in one national newsmagazine last week.
   It's the kind of spotlight New Orleans officials have been
working all year to avoid.
   The city is no stranger to Big Events: annual Mardi Gras street
parties, six Super Bowls, a papal visit and the 1984 World's Fair.
   But this is different. The convention comes at a time when the
city is reeling from an economic depression caused by a slump in
the oil industry.
   Ron Jones, a local businessman and vice chairman of the host
committee, sees the convention as a major step toward helping the
city and state recover from the oil slump, which sent unemployment
rates in Louisiana soaring to the highest in the nation.
   ``We have an opportunity with this convention to change how the
people of the United States perceive the city of New Orleans and
the state of Louisiana,'' said Jones.
   Barthelemy and others are hoping the GOP meeting will rid the
city once and for all of any negative feelings left over from the
1984 World's Fair.
   Although the fair was a great party, it was a financial flop
that drew mostly negative publicity. Bad press started the day
before it opened, and stories of its financial problems and
lawsuits followed.
   ``There were never any logistical problems with the World's
Fair,'' Wilson said. ``The problem was not enough good publicity,
and not enough people came to it.''
   When the national media shows up this time, organizers will have
10,000 volunteer workers to make sure delegates, reporters and
convention guests find everything in place.
   ``We want to see that everything is ready from hotels and night
spots, down to the little man in his house who's being asked to
hang a flag out,'' Councilwoman Peggy Wilson said.
   A $280,000 message center will be set up in the Superdome, Jones
said. Computer terminals in the major hotels will allow delegates
and reporters to check messages from various points in the city.
   Two fund-raising groups are raising the $5.5 million New Orleans
agreed to put up when it signed the contract to host the convention.
   ``We can't afford another tax,'' Barthelemy said. ``We had to go
another route so we're asking for contributions.''
   Collections got off to a slow start, but by the third week of
June, 60 percent of the money had been raised, according to Pat
Taylor, head of Taylor Oil Co. and head fund-raiser.
   Convention Manager Bill Phillips says he's not worried about the
city's ability to pay. ``I'm not concerned about the city living up
to its obligations, they have met every one of them on time,'' he
said.
   Phillips also said he sees no reason to worry yet about another
possible snag, a police organization's demands that the city enter
into a collective bargaining agreement.
   ``In Dallas in 1984 the police and the taxi drivers both said
they were going to strike if something wasn't agreed upon and
neither did,'' said Phillips. ``The city has said they're talking
with the police association and it's coming along. It's a wait and
see.''
   A University of New Orleans study says the convention will have
a $137 million impact on the local economy, but local officials
think the long-range impact is far more important.
   ``This is a wonderful chance to show the city off,'' Wilson
said. ``We want to make sure we take full advantage of it.
   ``We're paying very close attention to all the details.''

   Delane Balliot and Newcomb Munt ended a
72-hour marathon strip act in a store window after stripping to
their underwear 432 times.
   They began their quest to enter the Guinness Book of World
Records Wednesday afternoon. If nobody else breaks their record,
they hope the 1989 Guinness book will list them as the first record
holders for consecutive stripping.
   ``My feet are twice the size of my shoes right now,'' Balliot
said Saturday as she took off her high heels. ``I want to go home,
take a shower, go to sleep for days.''
   ``We are the pioneers,'' said Munt, 28. He works as a stripper
for a singing telegram company, as does Balliot, 22.
   The professional strippers were allowed to rest for five minutes
every hour during their bump and grind-a-thon, but they often
danced several straight hours to accumulate time for catnaps.
   For establishing the record their employer is giving each of
them $500, a new set of clothes and a free trip to either New York
City or Hawaii.

   A man has asked a court whether he can
keep $160,200 in $100 bills that his aunt wrapped as a Christmas
gift and gave to him before killing herself.
   Benton Vincent Davis III's aunt had been accused of defrauding
South Central Bell Telephone Co. of about $180,000, police said.
   Davis took a brown grocery sack of money to Chancery Court on
Friday and turned it over until a judge rules on its ownership.
   In a complaint filed by his lawyers, Davis said Kathleen
DePierri, 49, gave him packages of money, plus assets worth about
$20,000, a few days before she killed herself in December 1986.
   Davis, a 21-year-old senior at Vanderbilt University at the
time, said he put the wrapped packages in his car trunk and did not
open them until several weeks after Ms. DePierri's suicide.
   He is seeking a ruling on whether he can keep the money or
whether it should go to South Central Bell. The company has charged
that Ms. DePierri, a social worker, defrauded its employee health
plan by billing for treatment she was not qualified to provide.
   Ms. DePierri was found dead of a gunshot wound in her office
Dec. 16, 1986, by federal investigators she was to have met to
discuss a possible deal in which she would repay South Central Bell
and avoid criminal prosecution.
   Davis refused Friday to talk about the money or why he kept it
for 18 months before turning it over.

<HEAD>Despite Market Crash, Congress Stalled on Stock Legislation</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALAN FRAM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The House and Senate are drifting into the
waning days of this year's session gridlocked in a struggle to pass
legislation addressing the continuing woes of the securities
industry.
   News from the stock market over the last several months raises
the kinds of issues Congress usually pounces on quickly:
   One trillion dollars in equity values vanish overnight in
history's worst stock market crash.
   Billions of dollars go up for grabs in an endless series of
corporate takeover battles.
   Insider trading scams net millions of dollars in illegal profits.
   Yet, no bills are even close to passage.
   Congressional offices have files fat with testimony they've
collected at hearings on Wall Street's problems. But most lawmakers
and lobbyists seem convinced that the chances of any major
legislation being enacted in 1988 are increasingly remote.
   ``I'm unhappy about it,'' said Senate Banking Committee Chairman
William Proxmire, D-Wis., who is retiring from Congress next year
and has made stock market legislation a priority in his final
months in office. ``But there's not much I can do.''
   Turf fights have slowed the proposals, as regulatory agencies,
securities exchanges and even congressional committees with market
jurisdiction struggle to expand or retain powers they now have.
   Deeper divisions exist, however, over the very need for new
laws. The growing influence of the futures markets, increasingly
common dramatic price swings and hostile takeovers are villains to
some. But others say they are little more than inevitable changes
that do more good than harm and that legislation could not control
anyway.
   ``No one is for the crash,'' said executive director Sarah
Teslik of the Council of Institutional Investors, which represents
large pension funds. ``It would be lovely to say, `Here are the
problems.' But is there a problem?''
   The measures that have been introduced are ambitious attempts to
stifle what their sponsors say is abusive, unbridled behavior that
threatens the nation's economy.
   One Proxmire bill, a response to last October's stock market
collapse, would tighten federal regulation of the stock, futures
and options exchanges.
   An Intermarket Coordination Committee would be formed,
consisting of the chiefs of the Federal Reserve Board, the
Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodity Futures
Trading Commission. The committee would create ``circuit breakers''
to automatically shut down trading if wild price swings occur, and
make a range of changes designed to dampen speculation and enhance
information gathering by the exchanges.
   A second Proxmire measure attempts to clamp down on corporate
raiders by forcing them to make their takeover efforts more public.
A third bill, introduced last Thursday by Rep. Rick Boucher, D-Va.,
would require brokerage firms to set up systems to weed out insider
trading, and offer bounties to people who tell the authorities
about the leaking of privileged information.
   All three proposals face imposing hurdles in a year in which
Congress has only about 50 work days left, and in which lawmakers
are becoming increasingly distracted by the political campaigns.
   The market regulation legislation has yet to make it out of
Proxmire's own committee and has still not been introduced in the
House. It has run into opposition from the Reagan administration,
many lawmakers, federal regulators and market officials, who
question whether any changes are needed. And its supporters have
lost momentum as the crash recedes further into the past.
   ``It's a case of everyone sort of stumbling around and in the
meantime the problem seems to be going away,'' says A.A. Sommer
Jr., a lawyer who monitors Capitol Hill for business groups.
   Proxmire brought his corporate raider bill to the Senate floor
last month, only to see his colleagues vote to attach what he calls
killer amendments, provisions that would help raiders by limiting
the defenses corporate managers could use. The surprised lawmaker
pulled the bill off the floor and says he still hasn't decided what
he'll do next.
   The insider trading legislation may have the best chance of
passage, especially with last week's new charges against an
investor and a trader accused of earning $19 million in illegal
profits.
   Rep. Edward Markey, D-Mass., chairman of the House
telecommunications and finance subcommittee and a co-sponsor of
Boucher's bill, says the insider trading measure is his ``best
bet'' for action. As James E. Heard, a Washington consultant to
financial institutions, argues, ``There's nobody who's against
stronger enforcement or tightening up insider trading laws.''
   But Boucher and his allies still need to sell their proposal to
their colleagues, who will have numerous measure competing for
their attention as the 100th Congress winds down.
   Even if the securities bills are not approved in 1988, lawmakers
pressing the legislation are succeeding in keeping the stock market
issue in the news and getting public reaction to their ideas.
   ``We may not be able to get everything passed this year, but
we'll set the stage for next year,'' Markey said.

<HEAD>JVC Latin Jazz Concert A Fitting Tribute To Machito</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL RAEBURN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The great Cuban jazz musician Machito died in
1986, but the JVC Jazz Festival's tribute to him provided ample
evidence that the Afro-Cuban jazz tradition Machito fathered is
strong and well.
   On Saturday night, Carnegie Hall resounded with the salsa and
jazz of Mongo Santamaria, Paquito D'Rivera, Tito Puente and Celia
Cruz in a concert that underscored the continuing vibrancy of
Machito's legacy.
   Machito came from Cuba to New York in the late 1930s and is
generally credited with being the first to combine Cuban rhythms
with jazz melodies and harmonies.
   Among the members of Machito's early orchestras was a young
drummer named Tito Puente, who ultimately launched his own big band
after World War II and has become one of the biggest names in Latin
music.
   Puente appeared with his big band Saturday night at the Machito
tribute, where he performed with all the vigor of the young man who
once worked for Machito.
   Puente's music is a true salsa-jazz fusion, seamlessly mixing
jazz-inflected horn arrangements with a churning Latin rhythm
section. While the Latin rhythmic groove was paramount in
everything Puente played, he also revealed an introspective side
with a silky, mysterious performance of ``Autumn Leaves,'' which he
played on vibraphone.
   Puente followed a rousing opening set by Mongo Santamaria, whose
smaller band revealed crisp, clean rhythms and taught arrangements.
   Santamaria was followed, in turn, by the Cuban-American alto
saxophonist Paquito D'Rivera, who has brought Latin music to a
wider audience of jazz afficionados.
   D'Rivera's quartet opened with a deft interpretation of ``All
The Things You Are,'' and later welcomed Dave Valentin, the Puerto
Rican flute player, for a guest spot.
   In one of the few apparent instances of poor planning during the
concert, Valentin was ushered off the stage after only one
selection, just as he was warming to the sound of the concert hall.
   D'Rivera also introduced to New York a young Brazilian singer
and guitarist named Anna Caram, who performed two breezy numbers
that revealed a supple if slightly hyperkinetic vocal style and a
considerable talent as a guitarist.
   The high point of the evening came with the appearance of Celiz
Cruz, the great salsa singer whose 35 years in the business earned
her a standing ovation before she began to sing.
   She delivered several selections in a deep, powerful voice
before all of the evening's musicians gathered on stage for a
freewheeling performance of ``Machito Forever,'' a Puente
composition.

<TEXT>
   The Democratic-controlled Congress is bragging
about a session of unusual productivity, although the circumstances
that have helped make that possible may soon be gone.
   ``We think it is probably the most productive Congress in recent
history,'' House Speaker Jim Wright, D-Texas, said.
   The record backs up that statement.
   _For the first time in years, the House has passed all 13 of the
annual spending bills on time. When the final two measures were
voted on Wednesday, it was the earliest that had been done in 28
years.
   _The catastrophic health insurance bill, signed into law Friday
by President Reagan, is the biggest change in the Medicare system
since the program began 23 years ago.
   _The Senate ratified the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces
treaty with the Soviet Union.
   _After a seemingly endless partisan battle over aid to
Nicaragua's Contra rebels through most of the Reagan
administration, lawmakers on both sides of the aisle approved a
non-weapons aid package.
   _Both the House and Senate have approved bills to overhaul the
nation's welfare laws, and an agreement between the two chambers is
being negotiated.
   _The housing aid programs have been renewed, and after years of
stalemate, a compromise has been struck on toughening the nation's
laws against discrimination in housing.
   ``Those are some pretty significant things done in this
Congress,'' conceded Rep. Robert H. Michel, the House Republican
leader. Michel was also quick to point out that Republicans
``played a meaningful role'' in those accomplishments.
   Still on the agenda are Senate completion of the spending bills,
a pre-election anti-drug bill, and another veto fight with
President Reagan over trade and a companion plant-closing
notification bill. And lawmakers are talking optimistically about
finishing the session on time in the first week of October.
   ``The reason we have been productive is because we have a
Democratic House and a Democratic Senate,'' Wright said. After six
years of GOP control, Democrats won back the Senate in the 1986
election.
   But crediting a unified Congress as the main reason for the
legislative success would be misleading.
   Last year, when both chambers were Democratic, not one of the
annual spending bills was finished on time. The most important
reason Congress was able to move speedily this year was last fall's
deficit-reduction pact with Reagan, which set in advance the
overall spending levels.
   Another reason for this year's success has been just-departed
White House chief of staff Howard Baker. The former senator's
non-confrontational style, and his work directly with Congress to
iron out wrinkles, helped keep the process moving on several
occasions.
   ``This illustrates that there is nothing wrong with the budget
process that a cooperative president cannot fix,'' said Rep.
William H. Gray III, D-Pa., chairman of the House Budget Committee.
   Reagan himself, of course, is in his final months in office.
Like other presidents after a long tenure, he has been
concentrating on foreign policy initiatives, including the summits
with Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   Meanwhile, domestic programs have regained some of the
attractiveness in Congress that was tarnished in Reagan's early
years of anti-big-government rhetoric.
   ``It's in large measure due to the fact that it's an election
year,'' said Rep. Leon Panetta, D-Calif. Republicans, too, are
voting for measures that ``members can point to as establishing
their credibility on a broad range of domestic issues.''
   Wright's chief vote-counter, Rep. Tony Coelho, D-Calif., said
that while Republicans have complained about the sometimes
strong-arm tactics of the Democrats to keep the schedule moving,
members of both parties were tired of Congress' traditionally
chaotic approach.
   ``You have an atmosphere for strong leadership,'' he said. ``But
if the leadership wasn't willing to take advantage of that, it
wouldn't happen. ... We are always working the system _ It's
hands-on.''
   The test of whether Congress is running better will come next
year.
   Although most observers expect Congress will remain in
Democratic control, there will be a new president ambitiously
pursuing an agenda that may not jive with that of Congress, and the
budget summit with Reagan will be a memory.
   ``I'm not so naive as to think we won't fall back into the same
old syndrome,'' Michel said.
   If George Bush wins, Congress will again have a White House
opponent _ and one with more vigor. If Dukakis wins, there could be
a clash of the expectations that Democrats have pent up in the past
eight years and the huge national debt that has built up.
   ``We have begun to reverse the trend that was eroding and
beginning to do away with our domestic infrastructure,'' Wright
said.
   A Dukakis victory would also take away Wright's much-enjoyed
role as the top elected Democrat in the country, an adjustment some
associates say might be difficult for him.
   Another adjustment will come by next year when the House ethics
investigation against Wright, who is accused of using his elective
office for financial gains, should be completed. If Wright is found
to have done wrong, it could shake up the House leadership.
   Wright has declared his innocence, and has called the current
probe wearying.
   But the ethics case is also a useful distraction for the
right-wing opposition in the House, which is spending more time
attacking the speaker and less time sabotaging the legislative
schedule.
   ``I don't think I intended it that way,'' chuckled Wright.

<HEAD>Why a Drought?</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Meteorologists know that a stalled high
pressure system and a split jet stream are causing the drought in
Middle America, but they are at a loss to explain why the phenomena
occurred and when they might end.
   In a high-pressure system, also known as an anticyclone, dry air
gradually descends toward the ground and moves in a clockwise
pattern around the center.
   It is the opposite of a cyclone, where rising, moist,
counterclockwise winds promote the development of clouds, and thus
rain.
   As followers of newspaper weather maps and broadcast reports
know, America's changing weather pattern generally consists of a
series of highs and lows _ anticyclones and cyclones _ marching
across the country from west to east.
   That pattern is stalled, has been for a month or more, and is
likely to stay stalled, according to Donald L. Gilman, head of the
Long-Range Predictions Group at the National Weather Service.
   In normal times, the highs and lows, and their accompanying
weather fronts, are steered across the nation by strong,
high-altitude winds known as the jet stream.
   Tearing across the nation's middle and southern sections in
winter, these winds pull along the major storms that many people
dread.
   When warm summer weather comes, the jet stream usually edges to
the north. There, it brings in moisture from the Pacific Northwest,
while at the same time helping pull storms north into the nation's
middle from the Gulf of Mexico.
   Not so this year, Gilman said.
   The jet stream has split in two. One stream is sweeping to the
north in Canada, steering Pacific storms north of the Farm Belt.
The second is moving across just south of the United States,
blocking gulf storms from coming north.
   And trapped in the middle is that dismally warm and sunny
anticyclone.
   This split is ``not a rare event, if you define rare as
something that almost never happens. But it's not frequent
either,'' said Robert Livezey, an associate of Gilman's at the
federal Climate Analysis Center.
   Can he say why it occurs?
   ``Unfortunately not. The processes which lead to this sort of
event aren't well understood right now,'' Livezey said.
   It may simply be part of the natural variability of the
atmosphere, he said. At any rate, the meteorologists aren't ready
to attribute it to any specific cause.
   ``That's one of the problems in dynamic meteorology that we're
still working on. Figuring out how (these patterns occur) is one of
the keys to long-range forecasting,'' said Paul Sabol of the
Climate Analysis Center.
   Even determining whether the high caused the jet stream to
split, or the split jet stream trapped the high, is difficult,
Livezey said.
   At any rate, the two work together.
   The high blocks the movement of storms into the Farm Belt while
the jet stream guides them around it.
   Once that pattern starts, the hot, dry weather tends to worsen
and reinforce itself, said Vernon E. Kousky, also of the Climate
Analysis Center.
   ``Everybody has felt the cooling sensation when water evaporates
after they get out of the ocean or a pool,'' he explained.
   In the same way, ``If you have wet ground, some of the solar
radiation is used to evaporate water, the area is kept cooler and
this is good for man and plants as well.''
   The drought, however, has reduced ground moisture. Without the
cooling of evaporation, and the clouds that the evaporated water
might eventually form, the weather can get hotter and hotter.
   ``You might call it a drought feedback mechanism, it tends to
perpetuate on itself,'' Kousky said.
   When it will end, no one was willing to say.
   ``There is no normal lifetime of a drought. They can last from
several months to years,'' the National Weather Service noted in a
statement on the drought.
   ``Unfortunately, reliable predictions of the drought's end, its
geographic spread, or changes in severity, cannot be made today,''
the service said.
   In his long-range forecast, Gilman called for the current
weather pattern to continue, at least through July. The most
intense focus of the drought may drift to the east and south in the
next three months, he said.
   But the pattern of rainfall behind it will be spotty, he said,
with only the western parts of the Great Plains likely to see much
increase in rain through the end of September. Whether that will be
in time to save threatened crops remains to be seen.

   Premier Turgut Ozal on Sunday
inaugurated the second bridge linking Europe to Asia and was the
first to cross it after a ritual sheep sacrifice opened the
ceremony.
   Ozal called the eight-lane suspension bridge across the Bosporus
strait ``a monument symbolizing friendship and cooperation between
Turkey and Japan and Italy.'' The bridge was built by a consortium
of Japanese, Italian and Turkish companies.
   The Turkish premier then drove his car 14 miles from Levent on
the European side to Kozyatagi on the Anatolian side, followed by
hundreds of vehicles.
   The bridge's main span reaches 3,597 feet and is about 192 feet
above the strait. It is the sixth longest suspension bridge in the
world.
   Thousands of people crowded nearby hills to watch the
inauguration ceremony, which opened after the sheep sacrifice, an
Islamic ritual.
   Dozens of helicopters hovered and thousands of police and
soldiers enforced tight security measures following reports of
sabotage threats by Japanese Red Army terrorists.
   The $123 million bridge was built in 2{ years by Ishikawajima
Heavy Industries Company, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries and Nippon
Kokan K.K. of Japan, Impregilo S.P.A. of Italy and the Sezai Turkes
and Fevzi Akkaya Turkish construction company.
   In addition to the bridge, 111 miles of highways will be
constructed, starting from Kinali near the Greek border in the
west, passing through Istanbul and ending in Sakarya in the east.
An additional 24 miles of peripheral roads will be built. The total
cost of the project, including the bridge, is estimated at $551
million.
   The new bridge is three miles north of the first bridge over the
Bosporus, which stretches from Hisarustu on the European side to
Kavacik on the Anatolian side.
   The new bridge was built because of increased traffic over the
strait. between the Middle East and Europe. But the traffic will
not be significantly eased until the peripheral roads are completed
by the end of this year, officials said.
   The daily traffic volume over the first bridge, which opened in
1973, reached more than 130,000 vehicles in 1987, according to a
Highways Directorate report. The report said 426 million vehicles
had crossed the bridge by November 1987.

   Mikhail S. Gorbachev emerged from the Communist
Party's first national conference in nearly 50 years with political
reforms he championed, but he also endured hostility toward his
drive for more openness.
   Such was the mixed scorecard of the four-day conference that
ended Friday.
   The 5,000 delegates met in the party's first conference since
Josef Stalin convened one in 1941.
   At Gorbachev's urging, they ordered an overhaul of the late
dictator's system that vested the nation's power and prestige in
the party's bureaucrats.
   By charting the path of political reform, Gorbachev said, the
Kremlin conclave pointed the way to a new ``democratic image of
socialism'' that would enable his economic and social reforms to
proceed.
   Resolutions adopted at the conference _ on topics including
political reform, the openness policy known as ``glasnost,'' and
inter-ethnic relations _ were not immediately made public. But a
preliminary scorecard can be drawn based on delegates' speeches,
reports in the state-run media and officials' comments to reporters.
   _Gorbachev himself looks like a winner. He gained his mandate
for political change and led the kind of frank, often searing
debate he espouses. The disputes starkly contrasted with the
polite, well-ordered ceremonial conferences of past Kremlin rulers.
   Among their political reforms, the delegates approved creating a
new, more powerful presidency with powers to draft legislation and
oversee foreign policy and defense _ a post apparently tailor-made
for Gorbachev.
   However, some delegates to the conference said they were
awaiting proof that Gorbachev's economic reform program, in its
third year, will improve life.
   Until the fine print of the resolutions is made public, it would
be premature to call the conference an unqualified triumph for the
57-year-old Communist Party chief.
   _Yegor K. Ligachev, the No. 2 Kremlin leader often rumored to be
at odds with Gorbachev, also appeared to have gained ground.
Ligachev's extraordinary speech, in which he disavowed any
ideological differences with Gorbachev, amounted to a ringing
defense of the party's Old Guard and a stinging blow to his
would-be rival, Boris N. Yeltsin.
   _Yeltsin, the one-time protege of Gorbachev and former Moscow
party boss, came away from the conference a loser. He asked
delegates for ``political rehabilitation'' and instead culled
attacks from a succession of speakers, including Ligachev and
Gorbachev himself.
   Yeltsin was stripped of his Moscow party post last year and an
alternate seat on the ruling Politburo in February after
complaining that entrenched bureaucrats were blocking Gorbachev's
reforms.
   Gorbachev says Yeltsin has some good ideas and is energetic but
that he lacks tact and has been rude.
   Segments from Yeltsin's speech and from the frequently acidic
attacks on him were shown on national television, apparently to nip
any vestiges of popular support for him.
   _President Andrei A. Gromyko and fellow long-time Politburo
member Mikhail S. Solomentsev, both in their 70s, may have also
come away losers. In a rare public attack, one delegate called them
and two other senior party figures holdovers from the ``period of
stagnation,'' as the era of Leonid I. Brezhnev is now known.
   Yeltsin also attacked Solomentsev by name, accusing him of
protecting corrupt party officials.
   Ligachev, however, defended his Politburo colleagues, saying
they helped engineer the election of Gorbachev as party chief in
March 1985.
   In addition, the conference raised questions about the future of
some groups affected by its decisions:
   _The journalists known as the ``glasnost gang,'' the most
outspoken advocates of Gorbachev's openness campaign, may have
suffered a setback.
   Vitaly Korotich, editor of the weekly magazine Ogonyok, and
Grigory Baklanov, editor of the Znamya literary monthly, met a
chilly, sometimes hostile reception. Gorbachev had to intervene
twice to silence delegates so Baklanov could finish speaking. The
editor of the government daily newspaper Izvestia, Ivan Laptev, was
also jeered from the floor.
   Gorbachev proclaimed that ``openness has been the hero of the
conference.'' But Ligachev specifically endorsed some sentiments in
a speech by a conservative writer who denounced recent daring press
forays into the Soviet past and present.
   _Party bureaucrats, from the countryside to the senior
leadership, suffered.
   All party officeholders will now be limited to two five-year
terms. Before, they could serve for life.
   It was also clear that local party leaders will lose their jobs
if they cannot muster enough support to be chosen as chairmen of
the country's 50,000 local governing councils.
   _Finally, the 20 million members of the party rank and file,
whose qualifications will be reviewed this year, face uncertainty.
A reevaluation of their standing could be used to blunt
conservative opposition to Gorbachev's reforms.

<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   About 3,000 nurses walked off the job Sunday to
protest a government health plan they say will increase the burden
on already understaffed hospitals.
   Also Sunday, 900 workers of Magen David Adom, Israel's version
of the Red Cross, shut down services after failing to receive June
paychecks. And physicians who have been staging short strikes for
several months closed out-patient clinics and performed only
emergency surgery.
   The doctors also oppose the government's health proposal, which
calls for shortening the waiting list for operations by introducing
a second daily surgery shift.
   Ilana Cohen, head of the nurses' union, said the government
should first substantially increase the number of public hospital
nurses. There are now about 12,000.
   ``It's inconceivable that they should talk about a second shift
when the nurses can hardly cope with the first shift,'' she said.
   She said the 12,000 nurses will take turns striking. Groups of
3,000 nurses will rotate taking two-week ``vacations.''
   Israel's debt-ridden hospital system has been plagued for the
past two years by strikes and walkouts. The government says more
than 22,000 people have been waiting months for elective surgery,
and medical unions say the number is 50,000.
   The new health plan calls for medical staff to do 15,000
operations in the next nine months.
   A committee consisting of Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, Deputy
Premier Shimon Peres, Finance Minister Moshe Nissim and Health
Minister Shoshana Arbeli-Almoslino has been named to propose a
solution to the health crisis.
   Ms. Cohen called on the committee to include the professional
workers in their deliberations.

   Administration sources said it was
``doubtful'' that the plane shot down by U.S. forces Sunday was an
Iranian F-14 fighter, and that the Joint Chiefs of Staff were
trying to determine whether it was a civilian airliner, as claimed
by Iran.
   ``It is doubtful that an F-14 was up there at all,'' said an
administration source, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   Earlier, Pentagon spokesmen said that U.S. Navy forces had shot
down an Iranian fighter jet over the Persian Gulf and that
officials were ``checking out'' an Iranian report that an
American-fired missile had downed an Iran Air jetliner carrying 290
passengers.
   The chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Adm. Wiliam Crowe,
was to brief reporters on the matter early this afternoon.
   Lt. Col. Arnold Williams said U.S. officials are `aware of the
Iranian claim, of the press reports of it, and we're checking it
out.'' At the White House, a spokesman said the president had been
kept informed of ``the incidents in the Gulf.''
   The Islamic Republic News Agency said the Iran Air jetliner took
off from Bandar Abbas at 10:15 a.m. (2:45 a.m. EDT) and was last
tracked 7 minutes later. The agency said 100 bodies had been
recovered and all aboard the jetliner were feared killed when two
U.S. missiles hit it.
   Major Mike Stepp said hostilities began in the gulf Sunday when
an Iranian gunboat fired at a helicopter at 2:10 a.m. EDT. He said
the helicopter was not hit and that the USS Vincennes and the
frigate USS Montgomery returned fire, sinking two Iranian boats and
downing a F-14 fighter plane that apparently joined the battle.
   The spokesman gave no exact time for the shooting down of the
F-14.
   No American casualties were reported.
   The incident was the first such hostility between the two
nations since the United States destroyed two oil platforms in
April.
   ``Our reports indicate that two small Iranian patrol boats were
sunk and one was damaged. The USS Vincennes also reported that it
downed an Iranian F-14 aircraft that was approaching in a hostile
manner,'' the spokesman said.
   Lt. Col. Keith Schneider said the fighter jet was approaching
the Vincennes ``at a high rate of speed'' in the Strait of Hormuz
and that ``warnings were issued.''
   ``It was clearly identified as an F-14; it ignored warnings and
was approaching in a hostile manner,'' Schneider said.
   He said Pentagon officials had not determined whether the F-14
was in sight at the time it was shot down.
   He said that after the incident, U.S. forces watched an Iranian
helicopter search the area where he said the fighter jet was downed
and that the American forces were ``standing clear and allowing
them to continue their operations.''
   Phyllis Oakley, State Department spokeswoman, said seven hours
after the airliner went down, ``We are certainly very much in touch
with this, but the Defense Department is handling everything. At
the moment, there is not anything for the State Department to say.''

with Jan Wydro, a Walesa family friend who lives in Oil City, Pa.
Stops on Walesa's itinerary include Disney World in Orlando, Fla.,
New York City, and Washington, D.C., before returning home on Aug.
29.
   ``He just wants to see America,'' Wydro said. The large number
of automobiles and computers in the United States has made the

``Wild World,'' `Peace Train,'' ``Morning Has Broken,'' ``Oh Very
Young'' and ``Another Saturday Night.''
   In a lecture Saturday, the 40-year-old former singer-songwriter

   Famed ``King of Torts'' lawyer Melvin Belli
says he can't talk about his wife's filing for legal separation,
but says he's written a book about marriage and divorce.
   Lia Belli, 39, said Friday she had filed for the separation
after 16 years of marriage and wanted Belli barred from their home.
She contends the 80-year-old man beat her and falsely accused her
of having affairs.
   She is Belli's fifth wife. He said his book about marriage will
be out in about three weeks.
   Interviewed Saturday by a KCBS radio reporter outside the
couple's mansion, Belli said one thing he's learned about marital
disputes is that ``you don't talk about divorce when children are
involved.''
   The Bellis have one daughter, Melia, born in 1973.
   Belli cut short a tour of the Soviet Union after Lia reported to
police Tuesday that an intruder fired two shots at her in her
bedroom at 5 a.m.

   Robert Merkle, who successfully
prosecuted Colombian cocaine kingpin Carlos Lehder Rivas, traded
his clout as a crime-busting U.S. attorney to mount a U.S. Senate
bid as a late-comer with no money, headquarters or paid staff.
   He faces a party favorite with a 10-month, $2 million head start
and the endorsement of President Reagan.
   In announcing his candidacy last week, Merkle forced a Sept. 6
Republican primary with U.S. Rep. Connie Mack, who had had no GOP
opposition in the race for the seat being vacated by veteran Sen.
Lawton Chiles, a Democrat.
   That rankles state GOP leaders, who consider Merkle a spoiler
and an underdog with no chance of winning. They complain he never
even sought the blessing of his party.
   It delights Democrats and Merkle's wife and nine children.
   ``It's been a long decision,'' said Merkle's 17-year-old son,
Matt. ``We all sat around the dinner table and talked. Everyone put
in his two cents.''
   The 44-year-old prosecutor, who dumped a 17-year career to make
his first try for political office, is no stranger to controversy.
   During his six years as U.S. attorney in Florida's 32-county
Middle District, Merkle battled corrupt public servants, drug
lords, attorneys, prominent businessmen and high-profile figures.
   He took on the governor, U.S. senators, a county commission,
Panamanian strongman Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega and onetime
baseball pitching ace Denny McLain.
   He just finished successfully prosecuting Lehder, a leader of
the violent Colombian Medellin drug smuggling cartel, and he openly
criticized the Reagan administration for considering dropping drug
indictments against Noriega if he would leave Panama.
   ``I`ve dealt with the law in all fashions _ drugs, environment,
national security, civil rights, labor, veteran issues. Any issue a
senator's work touches on I have worked with because I enforced the
laws,'' Merkle said. ``I'm sure I understand those issues better
than Connie Mack does.''
   His hard work in the courtroom won him a lot of attention _ not
always good.
   Republican Gov. Bob Martinez's office tried to get him fired
after the governor wound up as a witness combating claims that he
took illegal campaign contributions while running for mayor of
Tampa. Martinez was never charged with wrongdoing.
   Newspapers campaigned for Merkle's ouster. Defense attorneys
decried what they called abusive, terrorizing, overzealous,
bullying prosecutorial tactics. They compared it to McCarthyism and
called for U.S. Justice Department investigations, which always
cleared Merkle of any inappropriate behavior.
   Supporters who know him well say he is a masterful litigator
with an uncanny street sense, and he has earned an outstanding
reputation throughout the criminal justice system.
   ``He's always given 100 percent to everything,'' says his wife,
Angela, who has been sharing duties as scheduling secretary with
their older children.
   ``We're all pitching in,'' said Matt, who enlisted three high
school buddies to help carry campaign posters. ``We're all making
some sacrifices, but no one minds.''
   ``How many 17-year-olds get to be campaign manager _ at least
for the first few days when I was the only one around,'' Matt added.
   Merkle has $30,000 from his government pension fund for his
campaign and his classic 1968 Mustang for travel.
   ``He doesn't have one iota of a chance,'' said L.E. ``Tommy''
Thomas, former GOP state chairman and head of Vice President George
Bush's steering committee in Florida.
   Jeanie Austin, GOP state chairman, said she didn't know Merkle
was running until she read about it. ``I think he should have
contacted the party out of courtesy,'' she said.
   There was no comment from Mack. ``He is vacationing with his
wife,'' said press aide Mark Mills.
   Marjorie Kincaid, GOP leader in Tampa, came to Merkle's defense.
``I think they're wrong. He's going to have the power of the people
behind him,'' she said. ``Merkle couldn't enter the race earlier
because he had an obligation to his job.''
   Democrats, locked in a four-way primary battle, are thrilled
with Merkle's entry.
   ``It's a brand new ballgame for the Republicans,'' said Charlie
Whitehead, state Democratic chairman. ``The number one issue with
people today is crime and drugs, and Bob Merkle has been in the
forefront of that battle prosecuting people.
   ``I don't think he is a fool. If he didn't have some indication
he had a chance, he wouldn't have gotten into the race.''

<TEXT>
   Fearing a loss of identity, not to mention
overworked index fingers, a number of Massachusetts towns are
waging a last-ditch battle against their banishment from the 617
area code.
   Those digits have become synonymous with high technology, urban
sophistication and progressive politics, town officials say, while
the new 508 area code is strictly for hicks.
   On July 16, approximately 190 communities in central and eastern
Massachusetts are slated to switch from 617 into 508. New England
Telephone Co. says that the new area code is unavoidable.
   ``Quite literally, we're running out of phone numbers,'' said
company spokeswoman Clare T. Silvestri.
   The state's economic boom, in addition to launching Gov. Michael
S. Dukakis toward the White House, has pushed up demand for new
telephone connections, particularly in the corridor of high
technology firms along Route 128 around Boston.
   Part of the problem was caused by the growing number of
telephone lines needed by computers, said spokesman Mark Marchand.
Without the new area code, Silvestri said, the phone company would
have to set up a waiting list for new numbers sometime early next
year.
   ``By adding 508, we'll double the number of numbers available _
essentially overnight,'' she said.
   In Dover, a wealthy bedroom community 15 miles southwest of
Boston, residents object to being lumped with rural communities and
small cities in central Massachusetts. Dover's appeal to remain in
617 was turned down.
   ``We are intimately a part of the Boston area, and they're
casting us off as total exurbia,'' said J. Peter Grant, a mutual
fund investment manager who lives in Dover and works in Boston.
``We are being put in with Worcester and other communities we have
nothing to do with.''
   The new boundary of 617 is a rough semicircle around Boston,
from Marblehead on the north shore to Kingston to the south. Since
announcing the switchover two years ago, the telephone company has
been assuring the public that it will not hike its fees as a result
of the change.
   When the first map of the 508 district came out, 25 cities and
towns objected to their inclusion in it. Six of them eventually won
their return from area code exile. Two others, North Reading and
Wilmington, are still waiting for rulings from the state's Public
Utilities Commission, but without much optimism.
   ``We understand the reasons why they're doing it, and we realize
it probably has to be done,'' said James C. Stewart, chairman of
Wilmington's board of selectmen. ``But we'd prefer to stay in 617,
and we just wanted to throw in our request _ even though we realize
it's probably a futile shot.''
   Stewart said businesses object because of the cost of changing
their stationery and brochures, while residents are unhappy about
having to dial an extra four digits _ 1 and 617 _ every time they
call Boston.
   Wilmington officials also raised some frightening scenarios,
like residents dialing a Boston-area hospital but forgetting about
the new area code and panicking when they doen't get through.
   ``There's going to be a lot of confusion,'' said the town's
assistant manager, Jeffrey M. Hull. ``Most of the hospitals that
Wilmington residents use are in the 617 area, and that could be a
problem in an emergency.''
   Following the advice of telephone companies in other states that
have made similar switches, New England Telephone has launched a
direct-mail and advertising campaign to educate the public about
the change.
   In addition, the company said it will provide a three-month
grace period in which calls to the wrong area code will still go
through.
   Then, for approximately a year, people who use the wrong area
code will get a recorded message telling them to re-dial using the
correct code.
   When New York City separated three of its boroughs _ Queens,
Brooklyn and Staten Island _ into the 718 area code in 1985, a
similar public education campaign and a grace period worked well,
according to Tina M. Gimas, a spokeswoman for New York Telephone Co.
   Massachusetts hasn't always been so resistant to change. After
all, the telephone was invented in Boston, and it was during a
measles outbreak in 1879 in northern Lowell that a major innovation
in phone service was made.
   Until then, telephone operators memorized each customer's name
and position on a switchboard. Fearing operators might fall ill,
physician Charles Parker hit on the idea of assigning each customer
a number.

<HEAD>Passion for Fishing Flies Produces Remarkable Collection</HEAD>

   Though William Cushner has never felt the
sweet rhythm of casting a fly rod or the glowing satisfaction of
tying a fly, he has been hooked by a passion for the work of the
world's greatest fly tiers.
   ``It's the artistry, the craft and the skills these men
possess,'' said Cushner, a master picture framer who also frames
flies for display.
   Cushner's been a fly admirer for a long time, but what got his
collection rolling was the demise of the venerable New York City
angling supplier Wm. Mills & Son.
   ``Harry Hunt (who was liquidating the company's assets) opened
the doors for me,'' Cushner recalled. ``We all knew that somewhere
in that place were the flies of Theodore Gordon, the father of
American fly fishing. I kept buying all morning long.
   ``He suggested he would like to have a set of flies (framed) for
himself. Once I agreed to that, the whole picture changed. He took
me down to the basement and showed me flies that were tied in 1870.
   ``I wound up with an inventory of 100,000 flies.''
   The flies are put together with bits of fur, feathers and
anything else that a tier thinks might attract a fish, all tied to
a small hook. Most are designed to imitate flies that trout and
salmon feed on along streams and are less than half an inch long.
   Cushner shows them off with a flair so compelling that other
collectors frequently offer to share their most prized flies with
him if he will frame a set for them.
   ``Joe Howell was here from the North Umpqua,'' a famed steelhead
river in southern Oregon, Cushner said.
   ``He says, `Have you heard of Herb Howard?' I said, `You have a
set of Herb Howard?' He said he had 38 of them. He said, `I'll
split them down the middle with you.'''
   Cushner uses a water-soluble glue _ so they can be removed
without harm _ to mount the flies on a tiny clear plastic post
within the frame.
   ``When I first thought of it, I was sitting in the subway, and
all of a sudden, I could see in my mind the man casting and the fly
floating in space,'' said Cushner, a former denizen of New York.
``That got to me. So I raised it from its background, which gives
it its whole dimension.''
   Cushner combines flies with a painting, print, carving,
photograph or some other work of art, taking special care that they
relate to each other.
   ``Given the fact that I did not fish or tie flies, I had to make
this interesting for myself,'' Cushner said.
   An etching by English artist Norman Wilkinson showing a single
salmon leaping from a river has been combined with four
feather-wing salmon flies tied by Spanish master Belarmino Martinez.
   Other fly tiers represented include Carrie G. Stevens, inventor
of the gray ghost streamer; Lee Wulff, originator of the royal
Wulff dry fly, and C. Jim Prey, creator of the Thor steelhead
pattern.
   A photo of famed Pensylvania angler Jim Leisenring is mounted
with a set of 11 trout flies and the dog-eared piece of paper on
which he stored them, complete with pencil notations about the
flies.
   Cushner's work has been displayed at the American Museum of
Sports and the American Museum of Natural History in New York. A
collection of 230 pieces is been at the American Museum of Fly
Fishing in Manchester, Vt.
   The Fly Fishing Museum and Cushner's workshop now occupy the top
floor of his small two-story house. Now 75, Cushner figures he has
another 10 years to build up the collection and hopes to see the
work continued by his son-in-law, who lives nearby with Cushner's
daughter and two grandchildren.
   Visitors to the museum are few, so far _ it opened in May _ and
not all of them understand what he is doing.
   ``I had a man in here the other day who said he loved fishing so
much, you could put a bucket of water in front of him and he could
fish all day,'' said Cushner. ``Yet with all this around him, he
wasn't interested. Fascinating.''

   Fred Jackson, a decorated Vietnam War
veteran, plans to join his buddies in Washington on July Fourth,
but he might not be able to make the trip again. The government is
trying to deport him.
   Jackson, an immigrant from Scotland who volunteered for a hitch
in Vietnam even though he wasn't a U.S. citizen, knows the U.S.
Immigration and Naturalization Service has a strong case. He's had
21 felony convictions and spent six years in a Florida prison for
armed robbery since he left the Army in 1970.
   But the 39-year-old Jackson believes his troubles can be traced
to post-traumatic stress disorder, and he hopes an immigration
judge takes that into consideration at his July 21 deportation
hearing.
   He said the disorder, which has been found in Vietnam veterans
and victims of violent crimes, led him to heavy drug and alcohol
abuse to escape flashbacks of terrifying ambushes and firefights
from his nine months in Vietnam.
   Jackson, wearing his Silver and Bronze stars and two Purple
Hearts, staged a small demonstration with family and friends
outside the federal building here Friday before heading for
Washington to join other veterans at the Vietnam War memorial.
   He insists he's not bitter and would enlist again, though some
of his friends said he is getting a raw deal.
   ``There was a war going on and I thought I had an obligation to
defend the country I was living in,'' said Jackson, a slight man
with a wispy moustache and a rash of blue tattoos on both arms who
speaks with a hint of an accent.
   ``I love this country,'' said Jackson. ``I'd go back to Vietnam
again in a heartbeat. I'd do it all again.''.
   Jackson, his wife, their baby and her young son live in a tough
housing project in Norwich on $628-a-month disability payments from
the Army. He will soon begin treatment at a post-traumatic stress
unit at the Veterans Administration Medical Center in Northampton,
Mass.
   Jackson enlisted when he was 18 in 1967, two years after his
family emigrated to Norwich, an industrial city about 30 miles
southeast of Hartford. He was shipped off to Vietnam in January
1968 as an infantryman with the 1st Air Cavalry Division.
   In May 1968, he said, he was wounded when his squad was
ambushed. He recovered and was sent back into action, and was
wounded again with shrapnel. Jackson said he still can't get the
episodes out of his mind.
   ``I seclude myself, I sort of live in my own prison,'' he said.
``I'm up and down looking out the windows all the time. My wife
tells me I check the perimeter all night.''
   After nine months in Vietnam, Jackson said he was sent to Fort
Benning, Ga.
   He said he started drinking heavily and used marijuana,
barbituates and heroin ``anything that would make me pass out so I
wouldn't have to face the flashbacks.'' The Army gave him a
bad-conduct discharge, later upgraded to an honorable discharge.
   He did time in county jails in five or six states for
drug-related offenses and petty crimes before he held up a store in
Florida in 1979. When he got out of prison in 1985, the government
renewed earlier efforts to deport him.
   John Weiss, officer-in-charge of the INS office in Hartford,
said resident aliens who have been convicted of two crimes
involving ``moral turpitude'' are subject to deportation, but would
not comment on Jackson's case.
   Robert D. Money of the International Institute of Connecticut
Inc., Jackson's legal representative, said he believes there is a
good chance Jackson will be allowed to stay, and Jackson's
supporters said he deserves amnesty.
   ``Here's a man that volunteered to serve that didn't have to,''
said Alfred Hill, a Vietnam veteran and neighbor. ``He was willing
to give up his life for his country. Why should he all of a sudden
be kicked out?''

<HEAD>Blues Musician Eddie `Cleanhead' Vinson Dead At 70</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Blues singer and alto saxophone player Eddie
``Cleanhead'' Vinson, known for his coarse, swinging instrumental
style balanced by mellifluous vocals, has died. He was 70.
   Vinson, who had been suffering from cancer of the esophagus,
entered the California Medical Center in mid-June for treatment. He
was stricken by a heart attack Saturday, hospital officials and
family members said.
   Vinson, who sang with the Cootie Williams Orchestra in the
1940s, was best known for such songs as ``Cherry Red,'' ``Kidney
Stew Blues,'' and ``Somebody's Got To Go.'' He got his nickname for
his bald head, which he often joked about in the lyrics of his
songs, including ``Cleanhead Blues.''
   Vinson was born Dec. 18, 1917 in Houston, Tex.; his parents were
musicians.
   He toured through the South and Midwest with bands fronted by
Chester Boone and Milton Larkin from the mid- to late 1930s, and in
1940 toured with blues legend Bill Broonzy.
   Vinson moved to New York City in 1942, joined the Cootie
Williams Orchestra and recorded ``Cherry Red.'' Jazz critic Leonard
Feather said Vinson ``established himself as a powerful blues
singer with a personal, broken-toned style.''
   After serving in the Army near the end of World War II, Vinson
formed his own 16-piece orchestra and appeared with the Ink Spots.
But he ended up returning to Houston in 1954 to teach music.
   Rediscovered by band leader Johnny Otis, Vinson moved to Los
Angeles more than 20 years ago and revived his career with club
engagements and new albums, including ``Kidney Stew is Fine,''
``Cleanhead's Back in Town'' and ``You Can't Make Love Alone.''
   He was extremely popular among jazz and blues fans in Los
Angeles, regularly performed at European summer jazz festivals, and
made a series of appearances with Count Basie.
   One of his last performances was sponsored by the Southern
California Blues Society earlier this year.
   ``As frail as he was at that last show when I talked to him
backstage, when he got up to the stage his voice was very strong
and his playing was wonderful,'' recalled society officer Betty
Miller. ``That showmanship always came through.''
   Vinson is survived by his wife of 51 years, Bernice, three
daughters, five grandchildren and one great-grandchild.

   Police fired tear gas and rubber bullets Sunday
to disperse hundreds of stone-throwing Palestinians enraged by an
Israeli archaeological dig near one of Islam's holiest sites.
   White clouds of tear gas hung over the biblical Via Dolorosa and
other parts of Jerusalem's walled Old City as the two-hour battle
raged.
   At least 15 Palestinians were injured, including eight by tear
gas, five by beatings and two by rubber bullets, said officials at
Jerusalem's Mukassad Hospital. Several police officers were hit by
rocks, police officials said.
   Police said seven Arabs were arrested, and authorities later
closed most schools in Arab east Jerusalem.
   The protests began after Israel's Religious Affairs Ministry
launched a dig Sunday to clear an ancient underground staircase
near the Temple Mount, a site sacred to both Moslems and Jews.
   The Temple Mount, known in Arabic as Haram al Sharif, or Noble
Enclosure, houses the Dome of the Rock and Al Aqsa mosques.
   A crowd gathered and Moslem religious leaders, using
loudspeakers, called on Arabs to defend the Temple Mount, saying
they feared the Israelis would dig a passage to the mosques.
   Government officials said the dig would not violate Moslem
religious property.
   Massive police reinforcements were rushed to the Old City, and
police blocked gates and streets leading to it.
   Dozens of Palestinian youths, some of them masked, dashed from
behind street corners to throw rocks. Police chased the crowd,
firing rubber bullets and tear gas.
   An Arab girl about 6 years old was seen with her flower-print
dress covered with blood. Witnesses said she was hit with a rubber
bullet.
   The riot was one of the most widespread and violent in east
Jerusalem since the Palestinian uprising in the occupied
territories started Dec. 8. At least 215 Palestinians and four
Israelis have died in the uprising.
   Most of the occupied territories were quiet Sunday, but a
firebomb set ablaze an army vehicle in downtown Gaza City. It was
quickly extinguished and soldiers put the area under curfew.
   In Jerusalem, government archeologist Dan Bahat said the dig was
intended to open a stairway and clean up part of a more than
2,000-year-old tunnel bordering the Temple Mount.
   The Temple Mount is also bordered by the Western Wall, the last
remnant of the Second Temple and Judaism's holiest site.
   Bahat said the 70-yard-long tunnel links the wall with the Via
Dolorosa, which according to Christian tradition was the route
Jesus took to the cross. According to Bahat and Arab reports, the
call broadcast from the mosque claimed that ``the Jews planned to
dig a tunnel'' to the Temple Mount.
   Anwar Kkatib, deputy head of the Moslem Supreme Council which
administers the sites, said Moslem religious officials were aware
of plans for the dig but opposed it.
   Bahat said the dig was started in coordination with the Moslem
authorities, but Uri Mintzer, spokesman for Religious Affairs
Ministry, said Moslem officials were not notified the work would
start Sunday.
   Jerusalem's adviser on Arab affairs, Amir Cheshin, said it was a
mistake to start the dig ``without making a pre-arrangement with
Moslem authorities.''
   Moslem and Israeli officials decided later Sunday to hold
further talks about the excavation and cover up the dig for the
time being.
   Moslems said they want the hole to remain closed. Zevulun Orlev,
director general of the Religious Affairs Ministry, said he hoped
the tunnel eventually could be opened as a tourist attraction.

<HEAD>At Least Seven Die In West German Helicopter Crash</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   GARMISCH-PARTENKIRCHEN, West Germany (AP) _ A West German army
helicopter flying in heavy fog slammed into a cliff and crashed in
the Bavarian Alps on Sunday, killing at least seven people,
officials said.
   Five civilians, three army crewmen and a soldier were on board
the helicopter when it went down near the resort of
Garmisch-Partenkirchen, the Defense Ministry in Bonn said.
   Witnesses reported that the Bell UH-1-D helicopter struck a
cliff at about 11 a.m., exploded, and plummeted 400 yards into an
isolated area. The crash site is near the 9,775-foot Zugspitze,
West Germany's highest peak.
   Seven bodies were recovered by Sunday night, police said. They
said the body of a dog was also found at the crash site.
   The search was called off until Monday morning because of thick
fog in the mountainous region, according to an army spokesman in
Mittenwald, about 12 miles east of Garmisch-Partenkirchen.
   When asked about the possibility of survivors, the spokesman
said: ``We have to assume the worst.'' He spoke on condition of
anonymity.
   The helicopter took off from army barracks in Mittenwald at
about 10 a.m., the Defense Ministry said.
   It picked up the five civilians and a soldier at a support base
for troops undergoing mountain training, the ministry said.
   Rescue workers were planning to stay in shelters overnight and
resume their search in the morning, police said.
   Sunday's crash was the third involving West German military
flights in as many days.
   On Saturday, a West German Transall C-160 transport plane crash
landed near Bordeaux, France, injuring all six soldiers aboard.
   A day earlier, a small reconnaissance airplane crashed during
army exercises in the northern West German state of
Schleswig-Holstein, killing the pilot.

<HEAD>Summerfest Officials Withdraw Condom Cookies From Stand</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A record store that sold fortune cookies
containing miniature condoms as a joke failed to draw a laugh from
officials in charge of the city's largest summer festival.
   Mainstream Records began selling the condom cookies at
Summerfest when the lakefront festival opened Thursday. But Jim
Petersen, owner of Mainstream Records, said Summerfest officials
asked him to stop selling the items.
   Petersen said he was told the condom cookies were inappropriate
for an event that is billed as a family festival.
   Bo Black, executive director of Summerfest, was not aware the
cookies were being sold on the Summerfest grounds until a reporter
told her Friday evening.
   ``We will be taking care of that,'' Black said. ``That is not
cool.''
   A short time later, the cookies disappeared from Mainstream's
stands.
   Before the cookies were withdrawn, workers at the stand
estimated they had sold 50. Each $1.99 cookie was sealed
individually in plastic. Upon breaking it, a purchaser found an
appropriate fortune wrapped around a miniature condom.
   Beth Taylor, 29, of Woodstock, Ill., bought two cookies as a
practical joke for her brother and boyfriend.
   ``They'll die,'' she said. ``They'll be embarrassed.''
   Deedee Smith, 22, a worker at the Mainstream stand, said many
were embarrassed but also curious.
   ``A lot of them wanted to know if they really work,'' she said.
But, she continued, ``they're miniature. They're only about the
size of your little finger.''

   Iran, outgunned by Iraq, has to scrounge
around the world for its military hardware because of a Western
arms embargo and Western military analysts say it is short of
aircraft, tanks and artillery.
   But when the war with Iraq broke out in September 1980, Iran's
armed forces were the best-equipped in the oil-rich Persian Gulf
region.
   Its air force, for instance, had 77 U.S.-built F-14 Tomcats, the
only military force outside the U.S. Navy to have the advanced
interceptors.
   U.S. officials said crewmen aboard the guided missile cruiser
Vincennes believed they were being attacked Sunday by an Iranian
F-14 when they downed an Iranian passenger jetliner in the Strait
of Hormuz. Iran said all 290 people aboard the Iran Air jetliner
were killed.
   At the outset of the Iran-Iraq war, Iran also had 190 F-4
Phantoms, 166 F-5 Tigers and 205 U.S.-built helicopter gunships.
They were purchased by pro-Western Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlavi, who
was ousted in the 1979 Islamic Revolution.
   Now, after nearly eight years of war and a chronic lack of spare
parts, military analysts estimate Iran has 60 to 80 F-4s and F-5s
and less than 10 operational F-14s.
   By comparison, Iraq has more than 500 combat aircraft supplied
by the Soviet Union and France, along with advanced missiles and
laser-guided bombs.
   However, reliable sources have reported the Iranians have
recently obtained some spares for the F-14 and avionics for their
F-5s. It is not clear to what extent this has helped their forces.
   Hard-pressed to get its hands on spares for its U.S.-built
weapons, the Iranians have in recent years turned to China and
North Korea for hardware.
   Despite Beijing's denials that it supplies Iran with weapons,
U.S. military officials say China is now Tehran's main arms
supplier, usually through North Korea.
   But the Iranians are outgunned on the ground by Iraq and by the
U.S. Navy in the gulf.
   In the two major naval clashes in the gulf, April 18 and Sunday,
the Iranians have lost eight craft sunk or damaged.
   But despite the Americans' vastly superior firepower, the
Iranians are still considered a threat at sea.
   They have several British or U.S.-built destroyers and frigates,
although some are believed to be non-operational, and 6-10
French-made Kama-class missiles boats.

<NOTE>EDs: SUBS 8th graf bgng, `The suspect,' to CORRECT time of warning
to 10:49 a.m. sted of 10:19 a.m.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Following is the text of the Persian Gulf
briefing conducted by Adm. William Crowe, chairman of the Joint
Chiefs of Staff, at the Pentagon on Sunday:
   Good afternoon. After receiving further data and evaluating
information available from the Persian Gulf, we believe that the
Cruiser USS Vincennes, while actively engaged with threatening
Iranian surface units and protecting itself from what was concluded
to be a hostile aircraft, shot down an Iranian airliner over the
Straits of Hormuz.
   The U.S. government deeply regrets this incident.
   A full investigation will be conducted, but it is our judgement
that based on the information currently available, the local
commanders have sufficient reasons to believe their units were in
jeopardy and they fired in self defense.
   The sequence of events commenced when the Vincennes helicopter
was fired upon by Iranian surface units at 10:10 a.m., local Gulf
time. For a correlation, that was 2:10 a.m. Eastern Daylight Time,
approximately 40 minutes before the air action.
   Subsequently, the Vincennes identified the Iranian firing units
and closed to engage. The Iranian gunboats turned toward Vincennes
at high speed and were engaged at 10:42 a.m. with gunfire from the
cruiser and the Frigate Albert B. Montgomery.
   While so involved, the Vincennes detected an aircraft over Iran
at about 10:47 a.m., again, local time. This aircraft headed toward
the Vincennes and commenced closing at high speed. The Vincennes
immediately began assessing this new threat.
   The suspect aircraft was outside the prescribed commercial air
corridor. More importantly, the aircraft headed directly for (the)
Vincennes on a constant bearing at high speed, approximately 450
knots. A warning was sent on both military and civilian distress
frequencies beginning at 10:49 a.m. This procedure was repeated
several times, but the aircraft neither answered nor changed its
course.
   There were electronic indications on (the) Vincennes that led it
to believe that the aircraft was an F-14. There have been a number
of F-14 flights in the area over the last few days.
   Given the threatening flight profile and the decreasing range,
the aircraft was declared hostile at 10:51 a.m. local.
   At 10:54 a.m., when the aircraft was about nine miles away,
(the) Vincennes fired two standard surface-to-air missiles, at
least one of which hit at an approximate range of six miles. Due to
the limited visibility, the aircraft was not visually sighted until
the missile impacted.
   In understanding this incident, it is important to appreciate
the total context in which our ships operate. The US government
emphasized from the outset that committing military units to the
Persian Gulf mission would involve risks and uncertainties. This
conclusion has been reinforced by several incidents. For example,
the Bridgeton mining, the Stark tragedy and the Samuel B. Roberts
mining.
   A decision was made early in the commitment to give our
commanders sufficient latitude to protect their people and
equipment when hostile intent was manifested. They do not have to
be shot at before responding. Throughout our involvement in the
Persian Gulf, the Iranian government has repeatedly threatened and
fired upon U.S. forces.
   In September 1987, as a result of the attack on the USS Stark,
and other incidents, the United States issued a Notice to Airmen,
locally known as a NOTAM, which advised all aircraft in the Persian
Gulf region that U.S. Navy ships were taking additional
precautions, and of the need to identify themselves and to state
their intentions.
   Additionally, they were advised that failure to respond to
requests for identification and intentions or to warnings and
operating in a threatening manner could place the aircraft at risk
by U.S. defensive measures.
   As to the recent environment, we have alerted our forces to
indications that Iranian units might attempt to carry out attacks
against our forces over the July 4th holiday period.
   We are still in the process of reconciling and collating all the
data. An official investigation of the incident will be conducted
by Rear Adm. William N. Fogarty, United States Navy, of the US
Central Command. That concludes my statement.

   A: There has not been direct contact, no. I think we will be
awaiting the results of the SAR effort and any other indications.
   Q: Have any orders been issued to change the mode of our
operations in the gulf?
   A: No.
   Q: Admiral, the Aegis cruiser is supposed to be one of the most
sophisticated in the fleet in determining threat. How is it that it
apparently misidentified this aircraft?
   A: I'm a little confused by your statement. It is one of the
most sophisticated ships we have and certainly the improvements
made in Aegis weapon system have greatly amplified our capability,
and I'm talking about the number of targets that we can track, the
ranges that we can detect a target, the altitudes, and our ability
to detect and classify emanations from an aircraft. But it has not
solved all of our problems, and it does not defy the laws of
physics. And one of the most difficult problems is from a radar
blip, particularly from a head on target, to identify the type of
aircraft and so forth. I repeat for you, that the people in the
command center, and the people operating the radar had about four
minutes from the time they picked this target up until it was
declared hostile. That alone is a severe constraint.
   Q: But what lead them to believe that it was an F-14 echo?
   A: Some other electronic information, which is classified, and
I'm not willing to discuss.
   Q: Was the airliner squawking, as it should be, with its IFF?
Two, did the airliner have the right to be where it was? And what
was your judgment? Was the skipper acting under the rules of
engagement or was he a little bit impetuous here?
   A: Let me do it in reverse order if I could, please. It is my
judgment on the information that is available to us, that the
commanding officer conducted himself with circumspection. And
considering the information that was available to him, followed his
authorities and acted with good judgment in a very trying period of
time and under very trying circumstances. Let me repeat that not
only was he following this aircraft, and was he concerned about it,
he was engaged on the surface with Iranian units at the time. The
aircraft was not in the the air corridor that it would normally be
in, but the air corridor has a limited amount of air space, and he
was outside of that. Whether that is a factor, I don't know at this
point. And what was your first one?
   Q: The last one was whether his IFF was squawking, and whether
it would have happened if the old rules of engagement were still in
force?
   A: The old rules of engagement?
   Q: If we hadn't changed the rules in September, would he have
held his fire _ the skipper?
   A: Certainly, the rules of engagement would not have been as
specific in the authorities it granted him. I don't know whether he
would have or not, under the old rules. You're asking me about IFF.
We did have some electronic emanations, but I really can't say any
more than that.
   Q : But do you ... he didn't identify himself as a commercial or
_
   A: No, he did not.
   Q: How come? Did he _
   A: Now, I should stress, of course, in that regard, that we
warned him on the Civialian Air Distress Net three times in these
few minutes, and four times on the Military Air Distress Net.
   Q: _ saying, ``We have you'' _
   A: Yes. We received no answers. Nor did he vary course, or he
did he indicate in his conduct in any way that he had received our
communications.
   Q: He was squawking something, but not the recognizable ``I am
an airliner?''
   A: Well, it led us to believe that it was a military aircraft.

   If anybody is happy about the devastating
drought that is parching the South and Midwest, it has got to be
Leslie ``Skip'' Stewart-Abernathy and Steve Masler.
   Stewart-Abernathy is the historical archaeologist for the state
of Arkansas. For the past few days he's been having the time of his
life, delving into steamboat wrecks left high and dry by the
receding river.
   ``I'm trying to keep this in perspective,'' Stewart-Abernathy
admitted during a weekend interview. ``If all the farmers in
Arkansas go broke because of this drought, it's a major, major
disaster, but for an archaeologist it's a delight for several
reasons.''
   One of the them is the chance to see century-old steamboats up
close.
   ``We usually only get to see a little piece of these boats, and
then through a filter of dark river water,'' said
Stewart-Abernathy, who has been scrutinizing two wrecked steamboats
and an old wooden barge on the Arkansas side of the river, just
below Memphis.
   ``They are contained in an area about the size of two city
blocks,'' he said. ``One of the boats is really large, about 140
feet long and 30 feet wide. We haven't identified it yet, but we
probably will.''
   Masler, director of the Mississippi River Museum in Memphis, has
also been haunting the newly exposed river banks and the sandbar
islands which have appeared as the Mississippi dropped more than 20
feet below normal during the drought.
   Masler has been busy photographing the river, documenting what
he believes is an event of historical importance.
   ``It's an exciting time,'' he said. ``In addition to the old
wrecks, some recent wrecks also have been found, including a large,
three-deck diesel towboat. It sank in more than 20 feet of water
and now it's totally exposed.''
   Many people, he said, have been scouring the river banks for
relics such as old bottles, square nails and boiler bricks from
steamboats.
   ``I'm not collecting, though,'' he added. ``I'm just
documenting. As far as collecting goes, this situation is of much
more value to the archaeologists.''
   Stewart-Abernathy, who works for the Arkansas Archaeological
Survey, said several excavation teams would be working on the
wrecks while the water is low.
   ``We'll be taking measurements and noting construction
techniques, and so forth. You must remember, there were no
blueprints for these old boats. The people who constructed them
knew what they were doing and they simply built them,'' he said.
   Stewart-Abernathy said it won't be possible to remove the
wrecked boats, which have been attracting hordes of sightseers.
   ``The wrecks are far too large and weigh far too much to be
removed from the sites,'' he said. ``But the fact that they are
uncovered at this time provides us a once-in-a-lifetime
opportunity. Really, it's thrilling to be able to examine these
neat old boats and show them off to the public. It's an
archaeologist's dream come true.''

<TEXT>
   Q: Was this an accident waiting to happen?
   A: You could in a sense, of course, characterize all combat
operations as an accident waiting to happen. We have said from the
very outset of our involvment there that when you're using force,
when you're putting combat operations on to support your policy,
and it is a policy that is resisted and not agreed to by another
party, who is likewise willing to do things, you're running risks.
We've never pretended otherwise. We have been very successful with
our _ using our strength to keep down these kinds of accidents and
incidents. I think that if _ we have contacted airliners before. We
have had them respond. They have varied course. That policy has
been very successful and again, I repeat, if a country is going to
wage combat operations in a certain area and then send a commercial
airline in the area during that, of course it's an accident waiting
to happen. And if airliners do not pay attention to these
instructions and guidance that we have put out, and the warnings we
put out, then that poses a problem. We do deeply regret the loss of
life though.
   Q: Admiral, would you imply that not only was this out of the
air corridor, and not responding to your signals, but that you
detected that it was losing altitude and gaining speed, and flying
over an area where combat activity was occurring. In addition to
all those irregularities concerning this aircraft, have you been
able to determine whether it took off on schedule as a normal
commercial flight or are there any other irregularities?
   A: We're trying to detect that _ or determine that right now. I
would like to emphasize your point for a moment. F-14, on
corridors, out of corridors _ the important points here are the
commanding officer has a responsibility to protect his people, his
unit. He is engaged already in a surface action. He has a minimum
amount of time. It is logical to conclude that while he is firing,
and they are approaching him, and an aircraft lifts off from Iran,
goes toward him, steady course, high speed, decreasing altitude,
will not vary, will not contact him, it's a more than logical
conclusion that he may very well be in jeopardy.
   Q: Admiral, on the origination of the flight. Did it come from _
I don't know what city. I missed that.
   A: We believe Bandar Abbas.
   Q: It did _ that's a military base, isn't it?
   A: No, it's joint _ civil and military.
   Q: Just let me finish with that. You tracked that plane on
takeoff?
   A: We don't know, but maybe we did.
   Q: Is the first time an Iranian commercial airliner has acted in
this way?
   A: I don't have a specific example of where it has before. We
have multi-nation airliners in the Gulf. In general, our policy has
been respected, responded to. Occasionally we have an airliner that
ignores it. But usually they are at very high altitude. The reason
that these accidents are avoided mainly is that civilian airliners
fly at very high altitudes, and particularly because of that area.
This one did not.
   Q: Admiral, the ship captain's responsibility notwithstanding,
an F-14 being an American-made plane, shouldn't it be one of the
easier aircraft to identify, especially stacking its information
radiated against a four-engine commercial airliner?
   A: It depends on, of course, what it does. And it depends on how
much information you have on it. It depends on the attitude which
it's flying. It depends on the altitude. It depends on the
atmospheric conditions. It depends on how much time you've got to
process the data. And unfortunately, this has been the _ one of the
major difficulties in the Persian Gulf from the outset. We're
fighting in a lake. And when flights come, feet wet, out of Iran,
very few seconds _ no matter what.
   Q: Admiral, aren't comparisons going to made with _ this was the
case of U.S. mistaken identity and a commercial airliner was shot
down. The Soviet Union was a case of mistaken identity in Korean
OO7. What is the difference, in your view, between this shoot down
and that one?
   A: I think there are two very fundamental differences. There are
probably a whole host of them, with more thought. But the
fundamental differences are, of course, that it was not war zone,
there was not combat in progress, there was not combat there
normally; and, secondly, the KAL 007 was not warned in any way,
form, or fashion. Nor was, as far as I can tell or determine, was
any attempt made to _ to warn. It was a very high altitude, and
even after the completion of the incident, I don't think any claim
was made that it was there to bomb or destroy. It was accused of
being an intelligence gatherer. That was certainly not the case.
   Q: Admiral, Thank you very much Admiral Crowe.

<TEXT>
   Pope John Paul II on Sunday proclaimed Rose
Philippine Duchesne, a French-born nun who worked among the
American Indians and founded the American branch of the Society of
the Sacred Heart, a saint of the Roman Catholic Church.
   During a solemn ceremony in St. Peter's Basilica, the pope added
the 19th century missionary to the list of those Catholics who by
virtue of their life and actions the church recognizes as being in
heaven, and worthy of honor by the faithful.
   The 2{-hour ceremony also included the canonization of a member
of the Trinitarian order, the Spanish priest Simon de Rojas. Born
in 1552, de Rojas devoted his life to work among the poor and to
promoting devotion to the Virgin Mary, as well as being confessor
to the Spanish royal family. He died in 1624.
   Philippine Duchesne was born in 1769 into a prominent French
family and at the age of 35 joined the society of the Sacred Heart,
founded in Paris in 1800 by St. Madeleine Sophie Barat.
   The primary purpose of the order was to offer formal education
to young women, a revolutionary concept at the time.
   When she was nearly 50 she became the order's first missionary
in the New World and founded schools in the Midwest, primarily in
St. Louis and St. Charles, Mo.
   Although she never learned English or abandoned her European
ways, her pioneer spirit brought her into contact with the Indians.
She spent a year among the Potawatomis in what is now Kansas until
old age and ill health forced her to retire in the convent in St.
Charles, where she died in 1852, at the age of 83.
   In his homily to the 20,000 people gathered in St. Peter's for
the canonization mass, including over 7,000 in Rome for the
Duchesne canonization, the pope praised Philippine Duchesne's
``missionary courage.''
   He said that her life was a reminder that ``the call to holiness
is universal and does not know the boundaries of nation, political
system, culture or race.''
   Since the days of Philippine Duchesne the order has spread
throughout the world, and at present includes 5,500 nuns involved
in teaching, spiritual guidance, and pastoral activities in 40
countries.
   Attending Sunday's ceremony were nuns, students, and alumna from
all over Europe and the United States, a family of Potawatami
Indians as well as groups from Australia, New Zealand, Japan and
Korea. Five members of the Duchesne family also attended.
   A long applause boomed through the basilica as the pope in Latin
proclaimed Philippine a saint, and several people burst into tears.
   In her opening address to a symposium held by the order on
Saturday, the society's superior general Helen McLaughlin, offered
Philippine as a model for contemporary woman.
   ``A courageous pioneer woman on the American frontier, strong,
unflinching in her determination, Philippine has a message for
women today who find themselves on frontiers of a new sort.''

<HEAD>Newspaper: More Than 50 Soviet Hijackings In Last 15 Years</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A newspaper disclosed Sunday that the Soviet
airline Aeroflot has experienced more than 50 attempted hijackings
in the past 15 years. Only a few of the hijackings had been
previously reported in the Soviet media.
   The article by the labor daily Trud was believed to be the most
complete report on air piracy in the Soviet Union to date.
   Trud quoted Deputy Aviation Minister Mikhail A. Timofeyev as
suggesting the more than 50 attempts on the state-run airline could
have been caused by strict regulations limiting emigration.
   In Western and developing countries, he was quoted as saying,
hijackers basically were trying to ``solve their personal, criminal
or political problems.''
   In contrast, statistics showed most Soviet hijackers to be
``antisocial and criminal elements who are trying to escape
responsibility abroad,'' the newspaper quoted him as saying.
   Before Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev's policy of
``glasnost,'' or increased openness on some issues, state-run media
and officials often maintained that terrorism was exclusively a
Western problem. That position has now changed.
   In March, the media reported extensively on the attempt by an
11-member Siberian family of jazz musicians, the Ovechkins, to
hijack a jetliner bound for Leningrad from Irkutsk. Five of the
hijackers, three passengers and a stewardess were killed in the
attempt.
   Airports are using tougher security measures, but Timofeyev was
quoted as saying they do not guarantee safety from hijackings.
   ``Life shows that hijack attempts are still being made, that
there are people who are ready for terrorist acts. Practice shows
that security systems don't always and everywhere work without
fail,'' he was quoted as saying.

   President Reagan said he was saddened Sunday
that the U.S. Navy had accidentally shot an Iranian airliner out of
the sky, but said he would not cut short his July Fourth holiday
weekend.
   ``We don't expect him to come back early,'' White House
spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said.
   Reagan, whose statement was relayed by Fitzwater, called the
accident ``a terrible human tragedy.''
   ``I am saddened to report that it appears that in a proper
defensive action by the USS Vincennes this morning in the Persian
Gulf, an Iranian airliner was shot down over the Strait of
Hormuz,'' Reagan said.
   ``Our sympathy and condolences go out to the passengers, crew,
and their families. The Defense Department will conduct a full
investigation,'' Reagan said. ``We deeply regret any loss of life.''
   Reagan defended the U.S. action, saying the civilian aircraft
had ``headed directly'' for the Vincennes while it was engaged in
fighting with five Iranian boats.
   ``The only U.S. interest in the Persian Gulf is peace and this
tragedy reinforces the need to achieve that goal with all possible
speed,'' Reagan said.
   The president and his top aides conferred by telephone and telex
throughout the early morning Sunday, with their discussions
culminating in a 1:05 p.m. EDT conference call with top officials,
a briefing by the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Adm.
William Crowe, and the release of Reagan's statement at the White
House.
   But the White House retained its quiet weekend atmosphere.
Fitzwater did not meet with reporters, and an aide said no
briefings were planned until Tuesday.
   The president and first lady Nancy Reagan flew by helicopter to
the Camp David, Md., retreat in the Catoctin Mountains outside
Washington on Friday. They planned to hold to their schedule, which
was to return to the White House at midday on Monday and view the
evening Fourth of July fireworks from the balcony of the residence,
Fitzwater said.
   White House deputy press secretary Roman Popadiuk, who met with
reporters briefly, said that national security adviser Colin Powell
awoke Reagan at 4:52 a.m. EDT with the news that U.S. forces
believed they had shot down an Iranian F-14 jet fighter. He
received another update in writing at 8:11 a.m. that noted the
Iranian claim that a civilian jetliner had been downed.
   At 9:50 a.m., he was told that the Iranian allegations might be
correct, the spokesman added.
   Popadiuk said Powell flew back to the White House Sunday
morning, breaking off a speaking engagement in Tennessee.
   The spokesman said Powell returned to Washington in time for the
conference call with Reagan and other top aides at 1:05 p.m.,
during which the president's written statement was discussed as
well as the details of the incident.
   Also included in the call were Vice President George Bush,
Secretary of State George Shultz, Defense Secretary Frank Carlucci,
Crowe, White House chief of staff Kenneth Duberstein, Powell's NSC
deputy John Negroponte and Fitzwater, Popadiuk said.
   Powell planned to keep the president updated on the situation
with written statements and telephone conversations, Popadiuk said.

   The producer of this year's JVC Jazz Festival
says the 10-day event ``went beyond our expectations'' and he's
already looking ahead to next year's program but ``it does get
tougher and tougher each year.''
   ``I'm ecstatic about the reviews, which have been totally fair
and good,'' said producer George Wein. ``They reviewed the music
and not the sound system this year. We seem to have solved the
sound problem in Carnegie Hall that really hurt us last year. ''
   The festival closed Sunday.
   ``In a festival of such magnitude where so many things can go
wrong, on a scale of one to 10, with 10 being perfect, this year
was 8{ to nine. Last year was a six,'' said Wein.
   Wein feared the concurrent First New York International Festival
of the Arts might smother the jazz festival. But, he says,
advertising for the arts festival, which announced the jazz
concerts, increased gross sales over last year some 8 to 12 percent.
   ``My problem is what do I do next year,'' Wein says. ``Last
night I couldn't sleep, trying to think of what I'm going to do
next year.
   ``JVC (the Japanese Victor Co., maker of audio and video
products) is happy as sponsor. We'll be back next year and JVC will
be back with us. We'll try to come up with a slightly new face next
year.''
   Wein reviewed some of the festival's events.
   ``We're really pleased with the `Love of Louis' (Armstrong)
program which opened the festival,'' Wein says. ``And the fact that
Ella (Fitzgerald) made an appearance was a highlight. (Carlos)
Santana and Wayne Shorter did an exciting event. I thought one of
the best things was Miles (Davis), who was better than ever. Kenny
G. did well. The Latin Jam was a great success.''
   Wein said he thought booking singer Miki Howard would be a risk
but her concert was almost sold out two days beforehand.
   ``She's a very good young singer. We're trying with her like we
did with Anita Baker _ who became an instant star.''

<TEXT>
   Sen. Dale Bumpers said Sunday he would have
problems accepting an offer from likely Democratic nominee Michael
Dukakis to fill the vice presidential spot on the party ticket.
   The Arkansas Democrat, who is rumored to be under consideration
for the No. 2 job, said his relunctance is rooted in the nature of
the vice presidency.
   Every party's presidential nominee offers his running mate an
opportunity to be a ``player,'' but ``it never happens that way,''
Bumpers said.
   Ultimately, the vice president gets lost in the shadows of the
president.
   ``In modern times, it is a dead-end street,'' he said in an
interview following a speech to the Governor's School at Hendrix
College.
   Bumpers told the crowd of more than 500 he had discussed the
vice presidency with the Dukakis campaign. But he said, ``Speaking
of vice president, don't hold your breath on that.''
   He said the vice president is wed to positions taken by the
president.
   ``As George Bush has learned, the vice presidency gives you none
of the pleasure and all of the guilt,'' Bumpers said.
   ``The vice presidency is much like a `me, too' position, unless
you're going to a funeral,'' he said.

<HEAD>Clinton's Selection Shows Democrats Reaching Out To South</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SCOTT CHARTON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LITTLE ROCK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The selection of Arkansas Gov. Bill Clinton
to deliver the speech nominating Michael Dukakis as the Democratic
presidential candidate shows the Dukakis campaign is reaching out
for Southern support, local political observers said Sunday.
   ``What I think Gov. Clinton will be doing is hoping to mold a
coalition,'' said Larry Smith, who teaches a politics course at the
University of Arkansas at Little Rock. ``I think he was selected
mainly because he's a Southerner. And this night is when we wave
Old Glory.''
   Clinton should ``address concerns that Southern voters have
about Dukakis being a Massachusetts liberal,'' said David England,
a professor of political science at Arkansas State University in
Jonesboro.
   England said Clinton can help clarify Dukakis' positions on
national defense and nuclear weapons, while stressing his fiscal
conservatism in Massachusetts.
   ``That would help appeal to Southern voters,'' England said.
``He could bring some of the politicos in the South in behind
Dukakis.''
   Clinton should describe the Massachusetts governor's
``incredible burning compassion'' but shouldn't try to change his
image as a technocrat, said Kip Blakely, executive director of the
Arkansas Democratic Party.
   ``I wouldn't say that's a deficiency,'' Blakely said of Dukakis'
image. ``I think the people want someone who's steady,''
   Clinton is to deliver the sole 15-minute nominating speech for
Dukakis during the Democratic National Convention on July 20,
campaign officials announced Saturday in Boston.
   Lilburn Carlisle, chairman of the Arkansas Democratic party,
said Clinton will be able to reveal insights into Dukakis'
character.
   ``I think he can convey to the American people what kind of man
Dukakis really is,'' Carlisle said. ``And his speech will convey to
the South how important this election really is.''
   Clinton said Saturday he hoped to introduce Dukakis to millions
of voters.
   ``All the surveys show that a lot of people in the country don't
know him very well, and that a lot of the support for both
candidates is still somewhat soft,'' he said. ``A lot of people are
really going to be looking at him very closely for the first time
in this convention.''
   However, Smith said most television viewers ``have already come
to grips with who Gov. Dukakis is through the long primary season.
I don't think Gov. Clinton is going to be very effective in
introducing Gov. Dukakis to the American people.''
   Michael Hemphill, associate professor of speech at the
University of Arkansas at Little Rock, had this advice for Clinton:
``Reinforce the strength of Dukakis _ but don't expect to change
many minds about Dukakis.''

   A handgun-safety group on Sunday urged parents
to take precautions to keep handguns away from their children,
especially at this time of year when children are off from school.
   The Center to Prevent Handgun Violence, a non-profit group
established in 1983 to educate Americans about the risks of handgun
ownership, released a study that found that 38 percent of the
unintentional shootings of children were either self-inflicted or
inflicted by other children.
   The study, called ``Child's Play: A Study of 266 Unintentional
Handgun Shootings,'' also found that an additional 41 percent of
the guns used in shootings of children were owned by a friend's
parents or by relatives other than the victim's parents.
   The center studied 266 unintentional shootings of children that
took place between January 1986 and May 1988. The shootings were
either self-inflicted or inflicted by other children age 16 and
under. The center said it compiled its data from reports in the
news media and, in some cases, follow-up conversations with police
departments and hospitals.
   Peter Shields, chairman of the center, recommended that parents
either remove handguns from their homes or, ``at the very least,
keep them unloaded and securely locked up.''
   Shields also suggested that parents check with adults at other
places where their children play to make sure that loaded guns are
not easily accessible.
   He added that children may be at particular risk of
unintentional shooting during the summer because ``children aren't
in school and have more free time. They'll be spending more time
playing at their homes and those of friends and relatives.''

   The government said Sunday that
beginning this week it is easing limits on checking account
withdrawals, imposed when banks reopened May 9 after a two-month
closure.
   Starting Monday, customers will be able to withdraw 40 percent
of the funds in their accounts up to a maximum of $20,000, said a
communique released by the National Banking Commission, a
government regulatory agency.
   Since May 9, customers have been permitted to withdraw only 25
percent of their funds, with a maximum of $10,000.
   The government closed 67 of the country's 117 banks March 3
after a run on deposits provoked by a political crisis.
   Large bank withdrawals began Feb. 26, the day Gen. Manuel
Antonio Noriega, the country's de facto ruler, deposed President
Eric Arturo Delvalle a few hours after the president tried to fire
the general.
   A U.S. freeze on $50 million of Panamanian government money in
the United States left the National Bank of Panama, a commercial
and central bank, unable to cover the large withdrawals.
   The bank closings reduced the economy to a cash-only system and
shut down the country's once-thriving international banking center,
which had attracted deposits from throughout the world,
particularly Latin America.
   After weeks of negotiations with private bankers, banks reopened
May 9. Restrictions imposed then on withdrawals from savings and
fixed-term accounts remain in effect.
   In addition to the freeze on government funds, the United States
imposed other economic sanctions and sent additional troops to U.S.
bases in Panama in an effort to force Noriega to resign as head of
the Defense Forces and leave the country. Noriega was indicted
earlier this year on drug trafficking charges in Miami.

   The fighting in the Persian Gulf on Sunday
involved some of the most advanced weaponry in the U.S. Navy and
the Iranian armed forces: Here's a rundown:
   _The USS Vincennes, an Aegis cruiser, carries some of the latest
radar and missiles in the U.S. Navy. The Vincennes has a speed in
excess of 30 knots, is 563 feet long, displaces 9,600 tons fully
loaded, can carry two helicopters, and is armed with Harpoon and
Standard missiles, anti-submarine rockets, two 5-inch guns, and two
Phalanx close-in, rapid-fire guns for use against anti-ship
missiles.
   _The USS Elmer Montgomery, a Knox class frigate, is 438 feet
long, displaces 4,200 tons when fully loaded, and has a speed of 27
knots. It can carry one helicopter, and is armed with Sea Sparrow
missiles, anti-submarine rockets, five 1-inch gun, four fixed
torpedo tubes and one Phalanx system.
   _The Standard missile, fired at the Iranian plane, is described
by the Pentagon as ``one of the most reliable in the Navy's
inventory.'' It is designed for use against missiles, ships and
aircraft. The range and speed of the 14-foot, 7-inch weapon are
classified.
   _The Iranian-operated, U.S.-made, F-14 Tomcat fighter that the
Pentagon originally said approached U.S. forces was one of the most
advanced American weapons when sold to Iran in the 1970s. Only
about 10 of the scores of F-14s sold to Iran are thought to be
operational. The commander of U.S. forces in the region, Marine
Corps Gen. George B. Crist, told reporters last Thursday that Iran
had recently received more F-14 spare parts from an undisclosed
source, and had stationed some of the warplanes at Bandar Abbas, an
Iranian navy base near the mouth of the Persian Gulf.
   F-14 fighters in the U.S. arsenal, and those originally sold to
Iran, were equipped with Phoenix missiles, a 13-foot-long weapon
that can travel faster than 3,040 mph and has sophisticated
tracking devices for targets up to 104 nautical miles distant. U.S.
officials say they are unsure whether the Iranian F-14s are armed
with Phoenix missiles.
   _None of Iran's Silkworm anti-ship missiles were reported to be
involved in the fighting Sunday in the Persian Gulf, but the
weapon, which carries a deadly 1,000-pound warhead, is a main
concern of U.S. forces there. Crist told reporters on Thursday that
the Vincennes had been stationed near the mouth of the gulf to
protect shipping against Silkworms that may be stationed later this
year in a concrete and earth bunker under construction at
Kuhe-stak. Crist said Iran is believed to have about 20
Chinese-made Silkworms at Bandar Abbas. A permanent battery at
Kuhe-stak, armed with the 57-mile-range missiles, could hit
anything moving in and out of the gulf, he said. The Vincennes was
under orders to protect any merchant vessel threatened by the
Silkworms, he said.
   _The Boghammer, the type of speedboat that the Vincennes and the
Montgomery were fighting, is manufactured by Sweden as a pleasure
boat. The vessel, about 43 feet long, has been modified with a
heavy engine to give it great speed, and equipped with machine
guns, rocket-propelled grenades and other weapons for use by Iran's
revolutionary guards in their attacks on tankers in the Persian
Gulf.

<HEAD>AFT Calls For School Reforms ... And More Money</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTOPHER CONNELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Education Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Delegates to the American Federation of
Teachers called Sunday for curbs on standardized testing of
kindergarten children and endorsed their leader's call for radical
reforms in running schools.
   But on the issue of reform, they amended the original resolution
proposed by the AFT's Executive Council to add a call for more
money to raise teacher salaries and school budgets.
   Gail Gordon, a Jersey City, N.J., college professor, argued,
``It's very important to link the reform with adequate funding. If
we don't do that, we'll just be saying a lot of words without any
teeth to back it up.''
   The 3,000 delegates also called for higher taxes on families
earning more than $75,000 a year to help close the federal deficit
and pay for social programs. They rejected an amendment seeking
cuts in Pentagon spending.
   The delegates heard AFT President Albert Shanker open the
convention Saturday with a warning that public schools will
collapse unless teachers find new and better ways to educate
children.
   Shanker reiterated his call for experiments in a thousand or
more districts where groups of six or more teachers would be given
a green light to set up schools within schools, run by teams of
teachers without interference from central office bureaucracies.
   The resolution adopted Sunday said, ``Much that has happened as
a result of education reform ... is bad.'' It said ``more and more
teachers are being told what to do, when to do it and how _
old-fashioned `teacher proofing' in the name of reform.''
   It said the union will encourage its locals ``to find ways to
enable any group of qualified teachers in abuilding to create a
different type of public school.'' These experimental schools would
be voluntary for both teachers and parents. They would be subject
to both union and school board approval.
   Shanker suggests team teaching approaches and wider use of
technology to free teachers from lecturing and allow students to
advance at their own pace.
   Gordon, a Jersey City State College associate professor of
health sciences, said she was concerned that New Jersey Gov. Thomas
Kean has pushed reforms without adequate support for on-going
school programs.
   Victor Gallis, president of the Patchogue-Medford Congress of
Teachers in New York, said, ``There's no way we can make the kinds
of revolutionary and very necessary changes unless additional
funding is available.''
   On kindergarten testing, the AFT criticized Georgia's new law
requiring children to pass a standardized test to enter first
grade. It said such tests ``can, at best, offer only a snapshot
representation of a child's skills.''
   It said using standardized tests to decide whether a child is
ready to enter or exit kindergarten ``can be harmful to young
children,'' expecially the disadvantaged.
   But the delegates accepted an amendment from Sandra Feldman,
president of New York's United Federation of Teachers, supporting
tests if parents and teachers agree to them and if teachers have
the final say on promotion.
   Feldman said tests can help detect handicaps in young children.
   On the Pentagon, Thomas Y. Hobart, an AFT vice president from
Albany, N.Y., questioned whether ``we in this room are able to
establish exactly what is the level that is necessary for the
common defense of this country.''
   ``We do not want to indiscriminately cut the defense spending
and say it's to go to the schools,'' said Hobart.
   The amendment to cut the military was defeated by voice vote.
   The 677,000-member AFT, part of the AFL-CIO, has traditionally
taken a more hawkish stance on the military and foreign affairs
than its rival, the National Education Association.
   The union also voted to seek increases in federal programs to
help inner-city school districts.
   It presented a human rights award to Marian Wright Edelman,
president of the Children's Defense Fund, and announced a drive to
alert inner-city parents to the importance of getting their
children immunized. The drive is co-sponsored by Lederle
Laboratories of New Jersey.

   For a politician Edward Earl Haynes is a man
of few words. Two words, to be exact.
   Haynes gave the shortest speech at inauguaration day ceremonies
in the small village of Norwood, about 30 miles north of Baton
Rouge.
   ``Hi. Bye,'' said Haynes, leaving the podium with a wave.
   Haynes has been an alderman since Norwood was incorporated as a
village after World War II.
   About one-third of the town's 400 residents were at Saturday's
ceremony. Most stood in the blazing sun on Main Street to see the
new mayor, three aldermen and the chief of police inaugurated.
   Mayor Ronald Jett was considerably more loquacious than Haynes.
   ``I want to get the town clean, presentable,'' he said. ``I'd
like to do something with Town Hall, which you can tell by the
looks of it needs some help. I'd like to help the Fire Department
out.''
   He said he also hopes to bring in new jobs.

   It looks like Jason, John and James have gone
the way of Tom, Dick and Harry.
   For the first time in more than 20 years, John is not among the
top 10 names parents gave to boys born in New York, according to
statistics released Saturday by the state Department of Health.
   John was the 12th most popular name given to boys in 1987 after
being ranked No. 2 in popularity since the early 1960s and 1970s.
Also gone from the top 10 are Jason and James, which were regulars
on the top 10 list since 1977.
   Michael maintained its hold on the No. 1 ranking for the 16th
straight year. The name Michael was given to about 4 percent of all
boys born in the state last year, the Health Department said.
   Next in popularity for boys names were Christopher, Matthew,
Daniel, Joseph, David, Andrew, Steven or Stephen, Brian or Bryan,
and Robert.
   Jessica was the most popular name for girls for the second
straight year, accounting for almost 3 percent of the names. Next
in the top 10 came Jennifer, Ashley, Amanda, Christine, Sara or
Sarah, Nicole, Stephanie, Melissa and Danielle.
   Names popular for girls just a decade ago that have been bumped
off the top 10 list include Michelle, Amy, Kelly and Heather.
   Some of the more unusual names given last year include Jersey,
Jamaica, Indiana, America, Fortune, Liberty, Equality, Freedom and
Casanova.

<HEAD>Drought Effects Felt On Fourth Of July Activities</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Residents of Illinois were asked to pray for rain Sunday to end
the drought and a fire was completely contained after charring
1,100 acres of tinder-dry Michigan forest and briefly forcing
evacuation of 60 families.
   Some firefighters spent the weekend on standby because of the
heightened fire danger caused by the drought, and some Indiana
communities put off their Fourth of July fireworks displays until
later in the summer in hope of rain.
   In Minnesota, the Hare Krishna League of Devotees of Minneapolis
offered to do its part with what was billed as an emergency rain
dance and chanting session.
   The chants will work because ``the real reason there is no rain
is that there is not enough sacrifice to God, so things are being
restricted by God,'' said group Krishna-Katha.
   Sunday was declared ``a statewide day of prayer for rain'' in
Illinois by Gov. James R. Thompson.
   ``The people of this ... state need to come to their senses and
their knees to seek an end to the drought,'' said Illinois'
Assistant House Minority Leader Penny Pullen.
   In Michigan's Upper Peninsula, the forest fire mostly within the
Hiawatha National Forest was contained by fire lines Sunday morning
and crew were using hand tools to extinguish lingering embers. Two
firefighters had been injured.
   About 60 families returned early Saturday to their homes along
Lake Michigan's Little Bay de Noc after being evacuated Friday
night, a spokeswoman. Two outbuildings were destroyed Friday, she
said.
   Michigan state crews alone have battled at least 438 fires
statewide this year, compared with an average 352 fires in each of
the previous five years.
   Minnesota's Department of Natural Resource firefighting crews
were on standby over the holiday weekend to douse any flames caused
by fireworks above tinder-dry fields. Five fires in the Cambridge
area of central Minnesota were started by illegal firecrackers
Friday, said DNR spokesman Tom Baumann.
   Franklin, Tenn., banned fireworks, including the city's own
scheduled Fourth of July display. But firefighters were on alert
through Monday in the anticipation of blazes started by people
using fireworks despite the ban, Williamson County Emergency
Management Director Mike Thompson said.
   ``One-fourth of our manpower have to remain close to the main
station'' for the holiday, Thompson said.
   Some Indiana communities also called off fireworks displays, but
rescheduled them for later in the summer in hopes of rain.
   ``We are having as lot of postponements. You may be seeing shows
from now until Halloween,'' said Ross Perri, vice president of
Princess Fireworks Inc. of Mishawaka, Ind.
   The danger of fireworks and the drought was obvious Saturday to
Jim Wagner, who operates a fireworks stand in Roseland, Ind. He had
to put out a grass fire less than 50 yards from his stand when
someone threw a lit smoke bomb.
   The Tennessee Wildlife Resources Agency has warned hunters that
game animals may suffer long-range effects of the prolonged hot,
dry weather.
   ``We don't want to paint an entirely bleak picture, but people
should be prepared to face the harsh reality that some things will
be different,'' said Ged Petit, information officer for the state
agency.
   The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has already instructed
Tennessee and Kentucky to cut duck hunting bag limits from four
ducks to two. And the daily bag limit for squirrels has been
reduced from 10 to six.
   ``I've been in the business 25 years and until the other day I'd
never seen a squirrel drinking water in my bird bath,'' Petit said.
``That showed me it's bad.''

   Here is a chronology of the events leading up
to and following the U.S. downing of an Iranian civilian jetliner
Sunday in the Persian Gulf.
   The chronology is based on information provided by the White
House, Adm. William Crowe, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff,
and Iran's Islamic Republic News Agency. All times are Eastern
Daylight. The time at the location of the incident is eight hours
ahead of Eastern Daylight.
   2:10 a.m. _ Iranian patrol boats fire on a helicopter from the
U.S. guided missile cruiser, USS Vincennes, which subsequently
identifies the gunboats and moves to engage them.
   2:42 a.m. _ The gunboats turn toward the Vincennes at high speed
and are engaged by gunfire from the Vincennes and the Frigate Elmer
Montgomery. Two gunboats are sunk, a third is damaged.
   2:45 a.m. _ Iran says its airliner, an Airbus carrying
approximately 290 people, takes off from the port city of Bandar
Abbas on a flight to Dubai in the United Arab Emirates.
   2:47 a.m. _ The Vincennes detects an aircraft over Iran. The
aircraft heads directly toward the cruiser at high speed and the
Vincennes begins assessing the situation.
   2:49 a.m. _ The Vincennes broadcasts a series of warnings to the
aircraft on both civilian and military distress frequencies.
   2:51 a.m. _ After the aircraft neither replies nor alters its
course, it is declared hostile by the Vincennes.
   2:54 a.m. _ When the aircraft is about nine miles away, the
Vincennes fires two standard surface-to-air missiles. At least one
hits the aircraft approximately six miles from the cruiser.
   3:45 a.m. _ The White House ``situation room'' notifies national
security adviser Colin Powell and other officials of an incident in
the Persian Gulf.
   4:52 a.m. _ President Reagan, spending the weekend at Camp David
in Maryland, is awakened by a phone call from Powell, who tells him
U.S. forces believe they have shot down an Iranian F-14 jet
fighter. Until early Sunday afternoon, the Defense Department
continues to describe the aircraft as an F-14.
   8:11 a.m. _ Reagan is given a written update on the situation.
The update notes that Iran is claiming a civilian jetliner was shot
down by U.S. missiles.
   9:50 a.m. _ Powell's deputy John Negroponte telephones Reagan to
inform the president that it appears a civilian aircraft had been
downed.
   1:05 p.m. _ Reagan holds a conference call with Powell,
Negroponte, Vice President George Bush, Defense Secretary Frank
Carlucci, Crowe, White House chief of staff Kenneth Duberstein and
White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater. Discussed are details of
the gulf incident and what Reagan will say. Shortly thereafter,
Fitzwater issues a Reagan statement acknowledging that the
Vincennes shot down a civilian jetliner. Reagan expressed regret
for ``any loss of life'' but said the downing of the plane was ``a
proper defensive action.''

<HEAD>Government Raises Alcohol Prices For the Second Time This Year</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government announced that alcohol
prices will increase an average of 14.7 percent Monday, the
state-run news agency PAP reported.
   This is the second time the government has raised alcohol prices
in the last six months.
   ``The second increase of official retail prices for spirits this
year is caused by the greater growth in personal income than
assumed,'' the Ministry of Finance explained in the communique
Sunday that announced the increases.
   A half-quart bottle of regular vodka will cost 1,640 zloty, or
$3.72.
   Alcohol prices went up an average of 46 percent February 1 when
the government introduced price increases for a wide range of items
and services.
   Price increases are a sensitive issue in Poland and often
provoke protests, but the government says they are needed to keep
pace with wage increases.
   Economists estimate that the current rate of inflation is about
60 percent.

   A U.S. Navy ship shot down an Iranian
jetliner over the Persian Gulf on Sunday, and Iran said all 290
people aboard were killed. The United States said its forces
mistook the jet for a warplane.
   Iranian Prime Minister Hussein Musavi said the incident showed
that the U.S. had ``entered a more direct war with our nation,''
and he warned it must face the consequences of ``this criminal
act.''
   Iran's official Islamic Republic News Agency said the Iran Air
jet was hit by two American missiles minutes after leaving Iran for
Dubai in the United Arab Emirates. All the passengers were believed
killed after the plane ``exploded in the sky'' at an altitude of
7,500 feet, IRNA said. The report was monitored in Nicosia, Cyprus.
   Iranian television showed helicopters shooting flares across the
crash area and small motor boats moving in to pick up floating
corpses. It said 110 had been recovered.
   A camera zeroed in on a rescue ship. On the ship's deck, a
rescue worker held up the corpse of an infant shook his fist.
   The report said the victims included 66 children. Iran declared
July 4 a day of mourning.
   President Reagan said the shooting occurred during ``proper
defensive action'' after the jet headed for the USS Vincennes as
the ship was engaged in a battle with Iranian gunboats in the
Strait of Hormuz, the entryway to the gulf. He promised a full
investigation.
   ``We deeply regret any loss of life,'' Reagan said from Camp
David.
   Musavi warned the United States ``that its latest crime against
the Iranian people would only further arouse the abhorrence of
(Iranians) against Washington,'' according to IRNA.
   The report did not say what actions Iran might take. It said the
shooting would strengthen Iranian resolve to continue its war with
Iraq.
   Iraq had no immediate comment on the incident.
   IRNA said ``eyewitnesses on Hengham island and Iranian military
forces in the Persian Gulf all clearly saw the passenger plane hit
by two surface-to-air missiles fired by the American warships.''
   The jet, Iran Air flight 655, was on a routine 150-mile flight
between Iran's coastal city of Bandar Abbas and Dubai, across the
gulf in the United Arab Emirates, IRNA said.
   The gulf air corridor is one of the world's busiest, despite the
hazards of flying over the waterway where Iran and Iraq have been
at war for nearly eight years.
   IRNA said the jet left Bandar Abbas at 10:15 a.m. (2:45 a.m.
EDT) and crashed at 10:30 a.m. The casualty toll of 290 would make
it the sixth-worst commercial air crash in history.
   The Pentagon said the gulf skirmish began at 2:10 a.m. when the
cruiser Vincennes and the frigate Elmer Montgomery encountered
Iranian patrol boats in the Strait of Hormuz. The Elmer Montgomery
had been involved in an encounter with Iranian gunboats Saturday
night.
   Iran claimed its naval forces shot down an American helicopter
and that two Iranians were missing, in addition to those killed in
the air crash. U.S. sources in the gulf said an American helicopter
was fired upon, but they did not acknowledge Iran's claim that it
was shot down.
   Adm. William Crowe, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff,
emphasized that the American troops ``acted with good judgment.''
   He told reporters at the Pentagon that the American ships fired
only after sending warnings to the incoming aircraft. The missile
that hit the jet came from the Vincennes, he said.
   Crowe said the Vincennes crew believed it was firing at an
Iranian F-14 fighter jet.
   ``How could a sophisticated warship like the Vincennes mistake
an airliner for a military jet? That's the question that
everybody's asking,'' said one military source in the gulf, who
spoke on condition of anonymity.
   The 9,600-ton Vincennes, the first of the Navy's billion-dollar,
super-powerful Aegis-type cruisers to be assigned to gulf duty, has
been on patrol in the Hormuz area for the past month. It is
equipped with an array of missiles including the SM-2 Standard, a
potent, long-range anti-aircraft weapon.
   The incident underscored the danger faced by U.S. warships in
the gulf.
   On May 17, 1987, the U.S. frigate Stark was hit in the gulf by a
missile fired by an Iraqi warplane, and 37 crew members died. Iraq
said the attack was a mistake, and Reagan said at that time that
such a mistake ``must never be repeated.''
   The incident also evoked memories of the Sept. 1, 1983 incident
in which a Soviet fighter shot down a South Korean airliner with
269 people aboard after it strayed into Soviet airspace. All aboard
were killed.
   In addition, Israel destroyed a Libyan Arab Airlines jet over
the then-occupied Sinai desert on Feb. 21, 1973, killing 106 of the
113 people on board.
   The U.S. policy in the gulf was recently expanded to allow
American warships to aid tankers of any flag that come under attack
and ask for help. It used that new power for the first time late
Saturday, when the Elmer Montgomery came to the aid of a Danish
supertanker under attack by three Iranian speedboats.
   The officials said there were no American casualties in Sunday's
clash, the second major one between U.S. and Iranian forces in the
gulf in three months.
   On April 18, American warships and planes, retaliating for the
mining of a U.S. missile frigate, destroyed two Iranian oil rigs
and sank or disabled six of Iran's naval craft, including two of
its best frigates.

<HEAD>Couple In Garbage-Filled House Relieved It's Over</HEAD>

   When authorities discovered the 33,000
pounds of garbage, trash and human waste in her home, Deborah
Eggert said she was ``relieved that the nightmare was over.''
   Mrs. Eggert, her husband, Michael, and their four children, ages
2 to 14, had retreated to tiny areas of their five-room home when
their garbage-packed house and garage in a middle-class
neighborhood were uncovered last month.
   ``I always thought, Well, I'll get to it, I'll get to it,' ''
she said.
   A few years ago, Mrs. Eggert said she began to feel hopeless
about ever changing her life. She did less and less housekeeping.
   ``I guess you kind of get to a point where you give up,'' said
Eggert. ``I'm having a hard time understanding how it did happen.
But I remember feeling there wasn't anything I could do about it.
When I went into the house, I just blanked the mess out of my
mind.''
   Now, the Eggerts are trying to understand how they allowed their
lives to run utterly out of control.
   The couple's four children are living in two foster homes. Mrs.
Eggert, 34, has changed her name and taken refuge in a ``safe
house'' for abused women. Eggert, 42, has checked himself into the
psychiatric unit of a hospital.
   And their home has been condemned and and boarded up.
   In the months before the house was discovered, the entire family
slept on a single set of bunkbeds. Clean clothes were stored in the
closet and stuffed into bureau drawers. A clear path led to the
beds through putrid piles of soiled diapers, garbage, and plastic
bags of trash.
   Without running water for the past two years, the Eggerts washed
their clothes at a laundromat. They carried home jugs of water from
a gas station or nearby brewery. They stood in a plastic baby tub
and poured water over themselves to wash. They went to the bathroom
in plastic trash bags.
   ``The kids asked about it at first,'' said Eggert, who was laid
off two years ago by the city's parks department. ``They wanted to
know why the house was getting dirty. I guess I told them it was
going to get better. But it got worse.''
   Several times, he said, they attempted cleanups. Once, he called
a disposal company but they couldn't afford the cost of a trash bin.
   The Eggerts said they realize their children suffered.
   ``I hate myself for it,'' Eggert said. ``It kept the kids from
doing a lot they should have been able to do.''
   ``I know they have got to have anger, not being able to have
friends in and having this horrible secret that they kept too,''
Mrs. Eggert said.
   The house was discovered when Mrs. Eggert didn't show up at her
nursing home job one day and authorities went to the house to check
on her. She has started a new job, hoping one day get her children
back.
   ``I'm beginning to take control of my life and it feels good,''
she said. ``But it is hard. I've lost everything I ever had. And I
feel like it's me again having to be the responsible one, moving
ahead.''
   Eggert is awaiting sentencing after pleading guilty to a charge
of domestic assault against his wife and is thinking about entering
an intensive, long-term treatment program.
   ``When this happened, I realized I needed help,'' he said. ``I
figured this was the place to come. But until you realize yourself
that you need help, you don't get it. And by the time I did finally
realize it, it was too late.''

<HEAD>Jackson Appeals For Release Of Hostages</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Jesse Jackson on Sunday appealed to the
captors of U.S. and European hostages to ``lift the world a step
closer to human rights'' by freeing those held captive in Lebanon.
   The Democratic presidential candidate urged the captors to
``create a breakthrough of better understanding'' and join all the
world's people in rebuilding Lebanon, which has been ravaged by war.
   ``One of the tragedies of your long war had been the kidnapping
and disappearance of thousand of Lebanese,'' Jackson said in an
audio and video message. ``My heart goes out to these victims of
war and their families. There are also American and European
victims: Terry Anderson, Terry Waite and others are now the prisons
of a war that they did not start and cannot end.
   ``But their captivity has reminded us that none of us is free
until all of us are free. I appeal to you from the depths of my
heart and soul to let them go. Their release could create a
breakthrough of better understanding,'' he said.
   Jackson's message, which he taped in Chicago, will be
distributed to the news media in Lebanon, the Jackson campaign
said. No details about the planned distribution of the message were
provided by Jackson's Washington office, which released the text.
   Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent for The Associated
Press, is the longest held hostage. He was taken captive March 16,
1985. Waite, envoy for the Church of England, disappeared during a
Mideast mission to free the hostages.
   ``If you will release my friends and allow them to return to
their families you will create friends around the world,'' Jackson
said. ``The power is in your hands to lift the world a step closer
to human rights and freedom for everyone, everywhere.''
   Jackson succeeded in securing the freedom of downed U.S. Navy
flier Robert Goodman from Syria during the 1984 campaign, and he
has frequently called for the release of hostages held in Lebanon.

   Bawdy bumper stickers would have to
declare their coarser terms in letters only one-eighth of an inch
high, under a bill passed by the Legislature and awaiting Gov.
Buddy Roemer's signature.
   Roemer says he will probably sign the measure into law despite
promises of a court fight over its constitutionality.
   ``It's not the most important bill ever to cross my desk,'' said
Roemer, whose state's depressed, oil-fired economy has been blamed
for an accumulated state deficit of $1.2 billion since 1982.
   ``This is an indecency bill,'' said Rep. V.J. Bella, who said he
introduced the measure after seeing lewd bumper messages once too
often. ``I'll worry about whether it's constitutional later.''
   Bella's bill would limit to one-eighth of an inch high and wide
the letters used for six specific words describing bodily
functions, body parts and sex acts.
   ``This is not a joke,'' Bella, a Republican, told the House of
Representatives when initial debate on his bill drew laughter from
his colleagues. ``I am just getting tired of seeing things like
this attached to cars. My daughter, my granddaughter has to see
this filth.''
   Other lawmakers and a representative of the American Civil
Liberties Union questioned the constitutionality of the bill, which
gained final legislative approval Friday.
   ``When you start limiting freedom of expression, you are
starting problems,'' said Rep. Arthur Morrell, a Democrat. ``You
don't need a law like this. We'll be the laughingstock of the
nation.''
   Gary Clements, a spokesman for the ACLU, told a Senate committee
the legislation would be challenged in court. ``We have a situation
of trying to define what obscene is,'' he said. ``In practical
terms, it's never been defined.''
   Violators could be fined $200 for a first offense. A second
offense could result in a fine of up to $350, while subsequent
violations would carry fines of up to $500.
   Roemer said a ``quick review'' of the bill did not show any
obvious constitutional problems. ``I will sign it,'' he said.
   However, the governor said he might change his mind if his staff
attorneys decide that ``all the flags are up and it's obviously
unconstitutional.''
   Louisiana is not the first state to try to restrict off-color
messages on vehicles.
   In Georgia, a law barring bumper stickers containing profane or
lewd comments went into effect Friday. Violations can draw fines of
up to $100.
   Alabama enacted a law last year barring obscene bumper stickers
from the highways, but a federal court declared it unconstitutional
after a truck driver was ticketed.
   Florida lawmakers passed a bill that would group obscene bumper
stickers into a law that covers other obscene media such as comic
books, movies, magazines and records.
   The Tennessee Legislature passed a bill earlier this year that
outlaws the display of ``obscene or patently offensive'' bumper
stickers, signs or other markings on a vehicle. Violators are
subject to fines up to $50.
   Earlier in the Louisiana legislative session, Bella said he
liked the idea of an outright ban, but questioned whether it would
pass court muster. Bella said he thinks the size limitation is
constitutional.
   ``That's why I amended it (the bill) so many times to get it in
the position I wanted it in,'' he said.
   Clements said courts are historically reluctant to allow states
the right to restrict expression through prior restraint.
   ``We're not in favor of corrupting children,'' said Clements.
``But we see it as a dangerous precedent.''
   ``I'd be a wealthy man if I had a dollar for every lawmaker who
had told me that they agreed with the ACLU position, that a bill is
unconstitutional, but they were going to vote for it anyway,'' he
said.
   Clements also said the bill would give a black eye to the
state's image.
   ``The way people are looking at it across the country: `There
goes Louisiana again,''' he said.

   U.S. relations with Iran have been frigid in
the decade since a revolution toppled pro-U.S. Shah Mohammed Reza
Pahlavi and ended what President Carter had called a ``close,
friendly relationship'' between the two countries.
   The shah's departure from Iran in January 1979 was followed by
the return from exile and rise to power of Ayatollah Ruhollah
Khomeini, leader of Iran's 32 million Shiite Moslems, and of the
religious opposition.
   On Nov. 4, 1979, militant Iranian students overran the U.S.
Embassy in Tehran after a three-hour struggle, taking 100 hostages,
including 62 Americans. The students demanded extradition of the
shah, who was undergoing cancer treatment in New York City, so he
could be tried in Iran as a ``war criminal.''
   That idea won swift support from Khomeini, who called on the
students to act against ``the great satan America,'' but Carter
refused the extradition request.
   Carter tried throughout his tenure to gain release of the
hostages, but 52 of them remained captive for 444 days and didn't
win their freedom until Jan. 20, 1981, just hours after President
Reagan was sworn in to office.
   Officials from the two nations have met since then at
conferences held by international organizations and had contact in
the Hague, Netherlands, where the U.S.-Iran Claims Tribunal was
formed to disentangle the countries' economic ties.
   But not since 1981 have they had official high-level talks on
bilateral issues.
   However, it was revealed during the Iran-Contra hearings that
the Reagan administration had conducted secret talks with the
Iranians in 1985 and 1986 and sold them arms in an effort to build
better relations and to win the release of hostages from captors in
Lebanon over whom Iran was believed to have influence.
   Reagan has barred further arms sales but also has said the
United States would be willing to talk with the Iranians to get
them to moderate their policies.
   Tensions with Iran flared again in the past year as hostilities
increased in the Persian Gulf region, where Iran and Iraq have been
at war since 1980.
   The United States began escorting Kuwaiti tankers flying the
American flag through the tense gulf in July 1987.
   On the first U.S. convoy through the gulf, the reflagged Kuwaiti
tanker Bridgeton hit a mine. U.S. officials have accused Iran of
laying the mines that damaged the Bridgeton and the USS Samuel B.
Roberts last April.
   After the Roberts was damaged, the United States retaliated by
destroying two of Iran's Persian Gulf oil platforms. In the ensuing
conflict, U.S. forces sank or damaged four Iranian attack boats and
disabled two frigates.
   Iran responded with attacks on Arab oil facilities and U.S.
British and Cypriot commercial vessels.
   On Sunday, a U.S. Navy missile cruiser shot down an Iranian
passenger jetliner that it had mistaken for a hostile aircraft.
   Tehran Radio called the American destruction of the Iranian
jetliner ``new evidence of American crimes and mischiefs, crimes
which expose America's nature more than ever before.''

<HEAD>United Nations Presents Cambodian Peace Plan</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER ENG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A U.N. special envoy said Sunday he has
presented concerned parties with a comprehensive plan for peace in
Cambodia and had achieved ``general agreement'' to work toward a
settlement.
   U.N. envoy Rafeeuddin Ahmed said he gave a working paper for the
plan to Thai Foreign Minister Siddhi Savetsila for distribution to
foreign ministers of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations.
Ahmed was scheduled to meet with the ASEAN ministers before they
open their annual meeting Monday.
   ``The situation has evolved in a direction where there is
general agreement among all the parties in reaching a settlement,''
Ahmed said in an interview.
   He confirmed the document called for an international
peacekeeping force and that such forces should monitor cease-fires
and withdrawals of troops, but he declined to disclose any further
details.
   He said that in the past few days he also gave copies of the
plan to Vietnam's Foreign Minister Nguyen Co Thach, Cambodia's
Prime Minister Hun Sen, and the anti-Vietnamese resistance, a
coalition of three guerrilla groups led by Prince Norodom Sihanouk
which includes the Khmer Rouge.
   The Communist Khmer Rouge defeated a U.S.-backed government in
1975 and, according to some estimates, killed 3 million Cambodians
before they were toppled by the Vietnamese invasion of 1978.
   The intensified search for a political settlement appears to
have been sparked by fears from several sides that the Khmer Rouge
could return to power.
   Ahmed said he will soon distribute the working paper to the U.N.
Security Council and indicated it would be involved in guaranteeing
a settlement.
   Ahmed declined to elaborate on how the different parties reacted
to the document, but said: ``They have all indicated their interest
and they have asked the U.N. secretary-general to continue his
efforts,'' referring to Javier Perez de Cuellar.
   ``All sides would have to make concessions if we are going to
reach a solution. ... there has to be give and take,'' he said.
   Ahmed's recent meeting in Cambodia with Hun Sen was the first
time the envoy visted Phnom Penh. He has been involved in seeking a
Cambodian settlement since 1982.
   The meeting also marked the first formal talks on the issue with
the Vietnamese-installed government, which the United Nations does
not recognize.
   Hun Sen flatly rejected the idea of an international
peace-keeping force after it was earlier proposed by Sihanouk. At a
news conference in Phnom Penh Wednesday, Hun Sen said it was
``nonsense'' to replace one foreign force, the departing
Vietnamese, with another foreign force.
   Vietnam has promised a total withdrawal of its forces from
Cambodia by 1990 and has begun a partial pullout of 50,000 troops
and withdrawn top military command.
   Ahmed said it will take some time for the different parties to
give final reactions to the document. He said it may provide some
input for the informal talks scheduled for July 25 in Indonesia.
   The Sihanouk-led coalition and Vietnam have already agreed to
take part in the talks but there has been no final word from the
pro-Hanoi government in Cambodia.
   The official Cambodian news agency SPK said Friday that Hun Sen
received an invitation but did not say whether the government would
attend.

<TEXT>
   World chess champion Garri Kasparov
triumphed in a World Cup tournament Sunday after he outplayed
fellow Soviet Andrei Sokolov to win an exciting last-round game.
   Kasparov finished first with 11.5 points out of a possible 15, a
point ahead of fellow Soviet Anatoly Karpov who came in second with
10.5 points.
   ``In this field which contained the top six players in the
world, it was a very, very convincing performance,'' said Bjarke
Kristensen, a Danish international master.
   Kasparov, playing white, reached an endgame a pawn ahead. When
the 25-year-old titleholder surrounded a second pawn with his 42nd
move, Sokolov resigned.
   Karpov won a surprise victory in only 22 moves, when his
opponent, Boris Spassky of France, blundered away a bishop.
   Kasparov's performance brings the champion closer to surpassing
America's Bobby Fischer as the highest-ranked player in history.
   ``If I continue to play chess on the same level I think it will
happen very soon,'' Kasparov told a reporter from Spanish National
radio.
   Kasparov scored a remarkable nine victories in the event with
four games drawn. But he was defeated by Karpov in the 14th round
Friday.
   The tournament was the second in a series of six featuring the
leading 24 grandmasters, making up the World Chess Cup with a total
prize fund of $1.2 million. Each grandmaster will compete in four
events.
   Soviet grandmaster Jaan Ehlvest finished third with nine points
after drawing his game with Jesus Nogueiras of Cuba.
   Sokolov and Spassky finished tied for fourth with eight points.
Also sharing fourth were Robert Hubner of West Germany and Zoltan
Ribli of Hungary. Hubner drew with Ulf Andersson of Sweden and
Ribli drew with Soviet grandmaster Alexander Beliavsky.
   Nigel Short of Britain, the third-ranked player in the world,
won his last round game against Artur Yusu of the Soviet Union to
finish eighth with 7.5 points.
   British grandmaster Jonathan Speelman drew his game with Johann
Hjartarson of Iceland to come in ninth with seven points.
   In the last game to finish, Ljubomir Ljubojevic of Yugoslavia
drew with Dutch grandmaster Jan Timman.
   Karpov won the first World Cup tournament in Brussels in April.
Kasparov was not participating. The third World Cup tournament is
scheduled for Rekjavik, Iceland, in October.
   In another development, organizers announced Sunday a chess
match between teams representing the Soviet Union and the rest of
the world to be held next March 19-25 in Gent, Belgium.
   Illy Iclicki, a Belgian chess master who lives in London, said
the event would consist of four rounds between teams of 10. Each
team will have eight men, one woman and one junior.
   There have been two similar previous clashes, both won narrowly
by the Soviets, who have eight players in the world's top 20.
   In 1970 in Belgrade, the Soviets defeated a world team that
included Bobby Fischer by 20.5-19.5.
   In 1984,the Soviet team defeated the world team 21-19 in a
contest staged in London.
   The Soviet team is expected to be led by Kasparov, with Karpov
on board as well.
   Final standings in World Cup tournament:
   1. Garri Kasparov, Soviet Union, 11.5 points out of 15.
   2. Anatoly Karppv, Soviet Union, 10.5 points.
   3. Jaan Ehlvest, Soviet Union, 9 points.
   4. Robert Hubner, West Germany, 8 points.
   (tie) Zoltan Ribli, Hungary, 8 points.
   (tie) Andrei Sokolov, Soviet Union, 8 points.
   (tie) Boris Spassky, France, 8 points.
   8. Nigel Short, England, 7.5 points.
   9. Jonathan Speelman, England, 7 points.
   10. Ulf Andersson, Sweden, 6.5 points.
   (tie) Alexander Beliavsky, Soviet Union, 6.5 points.
   (tie) Ljubomir Ljubojevic, Yugoslavia, 6.5 points.
   (tie) Jesus Nogueiras, Cuba, 6.5 points.
   14. Johann Hjartarson, Iceland, 5.5 points.
   (tie) Jan Timman, Netherlands, 5.5 points.
   (tie) Artur Yusupov, Soviet Union, 5.5 points.

   Ridding Cambodia of the Vietnamese and

America and western Europe.
   The meetings, which start in Bangkok Monday, come after Vietnam
began a partial withdrawal of 50,000 troops from Cambodia last week
amid fears that a power vacuum in that country could be filled by
the Khmer Rouge guerrillas.
   They precede informal talks in Jakarta, Indonesia on July 25
among Cambodian combatants. The informal talks are aimed at finding
a political solution to the conflict, which began in 1978 ago when
Hanoi's forces invaded that country.
   The Cambodian problem is likely to be dramatized by the presence
at some meetings of Prince Norodom Sihanouk, the charismatic leader
of a three-party anti-Vietnamese coalition.
   The six foreign ministers of the Association of Southeast Asian
Nations will hold their 21st annual meeting through Wednesday. It
will be followed by sessions between ASEAN and close supporters
from six countries and the European Community.
   Among those attending the dialogue will be U.S. Secretary of
State George P. Shultz; Hans-Dietrich Genscher, West Germany's
foreign minister; and the foreign ministers of Australia, Canada,
Japan, New Zealand and Greece.
   Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia, Brunei, Singapore and the
Philippines are members of ASEAN, which was founded in 1967.
   The officials are likely to review several recent plans for
peace in Cambodia, including ones from the Sihanouk-led coalition,
China and the United Nations.
   All the plans call for the total withdrawal of Vietnamese
forces, which Hanoi has promised by 1990. Most stress the need for
an international peacekeeping force to prevent armed takeover by
any one of the warring Cambodian sides.
   The Khmer Rouge, which imposed a reign of terror on Cambodia,
form the most powerful group within the Sihanouk coalition and are
viewed as superior to the forces of the People's Republic of
Kampuchea, the pro-Hanoi government in Cambodia.
   On Sunday, special U.N. envoy Rafeeuddin Ahmed said he has given
the U.N. plan to end fighting to all combatants, and each has
expressed interest. Ahmed said ``there is general agreement'' among
Vietnam, Cambodia and the three rebel groups for a settlement.
   But he declined to give details of his plan.
   The Khmer Rouge were in power in Cambodia in 1975-1978.
According to some reports, up to 3 million of Cambodia's 8 million
people died from Khmer Rouge executions, famine and civil unrest.
   The United States and other dialogue partners are expected to
push strongly for strategies that would deny access to power by the
Khmer Rouge.
   The ASEAN ministers in turn are expected to press the United
States, Canada, Australia and France _ the main refugee
resettlement countries _ to accept more Indochinese and help stop
the recently increased flow of ``boat people'' from Vietnam.

<HEAD>Kuwaiti Panel Blames Lax Security At Bangkok for April Hijack</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KUWAIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Kuwaiti panel on Sunday said lax security
measures at Bangkok airport facilitated the April hijacking of a
Kuwaiti airliner en route from the Thai capital to Kuwait.
   In a report submitted to the cabinet of ministers, the committee
headed by Justice Minister Dhari Abdullah Al-Othman also said
insufficient security measures taken by the Kuwaiti Interior
Ministry and the Kuwaiti Airways Corporation ``helped the hijackers
to commit their crime.''
   ``Despite the fact that the committee was unable to determine
how the hijackers managed to smuggle their arms into the plane, the
lax security measures at Bangkok airport have undoubtedly
facilitated the crime to take place,'' Minister of State for
Foreign Affairs Rashed Abdel-Aziz Al-Rashed told reporters.
   He said a second committee had been formed to deal with
implementing the report's recommendations.
   Moslem Shiite hijackers seized the Kuwait Airways Boeing 747
April 5, beginning a 16-day ordeal during which they killed two
passengers.
   The plane was taken to Mashdad in northeastern Iran, then to the
Mediterranean island of Cyprus and finally to Algeria where the
hijackers surrendered and were given safe conduct.
   The hijackers were demanding the release of 17 Islamic militants
imprisoned in Kuwait.

   A Chilean teacher leader gave emotional
thanks Sunday to the American Federation of Teachers for aiding his
union's struggle to oust the Pinochet regime and restore democracy
to Chile.
   ``We believe that Pinochet means war; we mean peace. We believe
that votes will overcome the rifles,'' Osvaldo Verduge told the AFT
convention. ``We believe that democracy can be reinstated once
again in Chile.''
   Verdugo, president of the 100,000-member Colegio de Profesores
de Chile, is on parole, awaiting sentencing from his arrest two
years ago for leading protest strikes.
   Verdugo, who needed a ruling from the Chilean Supreme Court to
leave the country to deliver his speech here, said, ``Today is a
historic moment for the teachers' union movement in Chile.''
   Verdugo addressed the 3,000 delegates in Spanish. A translator
repeated his remarks.
   He said his countrymen were commited to a peaceful movement to
rid Chile of the government of Gen. Augusto Pinochet.
   ``After 12 years of lack of freedom to do anything, we feel that
there will never be any change ... to benefit education or any
Chilean if we cannot first overcome the (Pinochet) regime,'' he
said.
   Verdugo's union is leading a campaign for a no vote on a
plebscite expected this fall that would give Pinochet eight more
years in power.
   The AFT delegates adopted a resolution urging local affiliates
``to send financial, political and moral support'' to Verdugo's
union.
   Verdugo called it ``an extremely difficult day for me as I stand
before you to share what we are going through in my country.''
   ``On behalf of all the teachers in Chile we wish to thank you
for giving us the opportunity of being here,'' said Verdugo.
   ``Our fight is not only a fight for the teachers. It's not only
a fight for education. It is really a fight to try to recoup and
recover our democracy in Chile,'' he said.
   ``With your help and solidarity and support, we will win the
battle,'' He concluded to a standing ovation.
   AFT President Albert Shanker said, ``It is hard for any one of
us to imagine how much courage it takes to do what Oswaldo Verdugo
has done.''
   Shanker said that when he visited Chile last October as part of
an international delegation, they visited ``a cemetery to pay our
respects to other union leaders who tried to take on the regime in
the last few years.''
   A yes vote would extend Pinochet's rule for eight years. A no
vote could lead to an open election for president by March 1990.
   Verdugo, who spent 50 days in jail in 1986, said afterwards he
was unsure what he will do next on his American visit. ``I know
only that I have to be back in Chile by July 15,'' he said.

   U.S. allies in Europe expressed regret at the downing of an
Iranian airliner by a U.S. warship Sunday but said U.S. forces had
the right to defend themselves in the Persian Gulf.
   British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher said the incident
``underlines the urgent need for an early end to the Iran-Iraq
conflict, including an end to all attacks on shipping.''
   Mrs. Thatcher said in a statement the government deeply
regretted the loss of life in the attack. But she added: ``We
understand that in the course of an engagement following an Iranian
attack on the U.S. force, warnings were given to an unidentified
aircraft apparently closing with a U.S. warship.''
   The United States said it mistook the jetliner for an Iranian
warplane.
   In Tokyo, the Japanese Foreign Ministry said it expressed
``heartfelt condolences to the victims and their bereaved family
members and hope earnestly that a sad incident like this will never
occur again.''
   Airline sources said some Japanese nationals were among the 290
aboard the plane. Iran said all aboard were killed.
   ``Japan hopes the incident will not lead to the widening of
tensions in the Persian Gulf and appeals again for the necessity of
an early peaceful solution to the Iran-Iraq conflict,'' the Foreign
Ministry said.
   In West Germany, the conservative Die Welt newspaper defended
the U.S. action, saying it resulted from the confused situation in
the war-torn Persian Gulf.
   ``The situation in the gulf, where warships and tankers, bombers
and passenger airliners are on the move near one another, does not
exclude the possibility'' that non-combatants could accidentally
become victims, the newspaper said in an editorial to appear Monday.
   ``No one can seriously make the accusation that this catastrophe
resulted from pre-meditation by the United States,'' the newspaper
said.
   In the Netherlands, a Foreign Ministry spokesman called the
downing of the Iranian airliner ``a very regrettable incident in a
complicated situation.''
   ``The Americans themselves are launching a further investigation
and we'll await the outcome of that,'' said the spokesman, Peter
Van Vliet.
   The French government said it learned ``with consternation'' of
the loss of the Iranian airliner.
   A statement issued in Paris by the Foreign Ministry said all
possible light should be shed on ``the conditions in which such a
tragic misunderstanding could have happened.''
   Also in Paris, the Ayatollah Mahdi Rouhani, spiritual head of
the Shiite Moslem community in Europe, made public a telegram he
said he sent President Reagan in which he deplored the ``savage act
of the American navy against the Iranian civilian plane.''
   The Paris-based Rouhani, who opposes Iranian leader Khomeini but
supports the Islamic Republic, said he demanded in the telegram the
resignation of the naval commander involved in the incident and the
``prosecution of the authors of this horrible homicide.''
   Dr. M.T. Mehdi, president of the New York-based American-Arab
Relations Committee, urged in a telegram to the White House that
Reagan ``personally apologize to the Iranian people and
government.''
   He also called on Reagan to ``offer to pay compensation to the
victims of the tragedy and withdraw the American naval power from
the gulf as soon as possible.''
   In Buenos Aires, the Argentine government expressed its
``deepest consternation'' Sunday night over the downing of the
Iranian jet.
   The government, in a communique, extended its condolences to the
people of Iran and the families of the victims and said it
``awaited a clarification of the circumstances and
responsibilities'' involved in the incident.

   Many Americans partied in the sunshine Sunday on the second day
of the Fourth of July weekend, while Iowans welcomed Soviet and
American peace walkers into their churches, singing songs and
exchanging gifts.
   A Union general was belatedly honored with a statue at the site
of the Battle of Gettysburg, and the heritage and culture of the
American Indian was celebrated at a powwow in upstate New York.
   In some drought states, firefighters had to spend the holiday
sticking close to their equipment because of the danger that
fireworks could set tinder-dry fields ablaze.
   Rain was scattered across the South and the northern Pacific
Coast, but there was sunshine for most of the rest of the nation
for picnics, baseball games, beach parties and back yard barbecues.
   The warm, sunny weather attracted thousands to Maine to enjoy
the seashore, rivers and lakes.
   ``I can almost feel the state tipping,'' joked senior collector
Duane Douglass at the York toll boths on the Maine Turnpike, where
he estimated northbound traffic at a couple of thousand vehicles an
hour.
   Several of the 220 Soviets and 100 Americans peace walkers in
Iowa began their Sunday visiting about two dozen churches in Iowa
City and surrounding communities. The walk began June 17 in
Washington, D.C., and is scheduled to end July 16 in San Francisco.
   Several Soviet walkers brought guitars and other musical
instruments to play at worship services, while some church choirs,
like the one at Zion Lutheran Church, sang songs of welcome for the
visitors.
   ``We are gathered here in your church together to pray for peace
in the world, to save the sacred gift of life on this Earth,''
Vladimir Oleinik, a Russian Orthodox priest, said through an
interpreter at a joint Russian-English service at the First
Mennonite Church of Iowa City.
   In an emotional ceremony near a stone wall where Union forces
withstood a desperate Confederate attack on the third and final day
of the Battle of Gettysburg 125 years ago, a bronze statue of
Philadelphia-born Gen. John Gibbon was dedicated before about 500
spectators.
   Gibbon was the last of five Pennsylvania generals who were
supposed to be memorialized on monuments as long ago as 1911. But
the money earmarked by the Legislature didn't go far enough and
Gibbon's statue wasn't made until a private group started raising
money a couple of years ago.
   Four descendants of Gibbon, who died nearly penniless in 1896,
helped unveil the bronze statue.
   Later Sunday, a flame that had been put out during the energy
crisis 15 years ago was rekindled at the Gettysburg's towering
Eternal Light Peace Memorial.
   ``I think the idea of rededicating it for peace, for a world
united, is something they would be happy with,'' said Arthur Rice,
who witnessed the original lighting of the memorial in 1938 and
whose relatives helped plan that ceremony.
   In Boston, Mayor Raymond L. Flynn signed a city ``Declaration of
Independence From Drugs'' modeled after the declaration of July 4,
1776.
   Early Monday, just after midnight, a 6.3-million-pound tracked
transporter called a crawler was scheduled to set out at a snail's
pace to move the space shuttle Discovery to its launch pad at Cape
Canaveral, a giant step toward America's first space shuttle flight
since the Challenger tragedy.
   A flag-waving ceremony was planned for the early-morning rollout
when the 85-ton spaceship edged out of an assembly building into
the glare of spotlights to start the 4.2-mile journey. Thousands of
workers who have labored to return the shuttle fleet to space were
invited to attend.
   Monday's parade in the Chicago suburb of Westchester, Ill., will
feature stiff competition between two precision parade units _ the
Westchester Invitational Shopping Cart Team and the Westchester
Precision Lawn Mower Drill Team. The mowers had dominated the
parade until last year when the shopping cart jockeys won ``Best
New Entry.''
   ``Every time we did something stupid, people applauded,'' said
shopping cart team member Loretta Kraft. ``If we don't get applause
this time, we'll just take our blouses off.''
   But while many people celebrated, Minnesota's Department of
Natural Resource firefighting crews were on standby over the
holiday weekend to douse any flames caused by fireworks above
tinder-dry fields. Five fires in the Cambridge area of central
Minnesota alone were started by illegal firecrackers Friday, said
DNR spokesman Tom Baumann.
   Fire officials in California said they found evidence that an
870-acre brushfire burning out of control Sunday evening near
Yosemite National Park may have been caused by illegal fireworks. A
few scattered groups of campers along the Merced River were told to
leave the area, said Mary Hale of the California Department of
Forestry in Sonora.
   In dry Tennessee, Williamson County firefighters were on alert
through Monday because of residents using fireworks despite a ban,
emergency management director Mike Thompson said. ``One-fourth of
our manpower have to remain close to the main station'' for the
holiday, he said.
   Some Indiana communities decided to reschedule fireworks
displays until later in the summer in hopes that the fire danger
will eventually be reduced by rain.
   ``We are having a lot of postponements. You may be seeing shows
from now until Halloween,'' said Ross Perri, vice president of
Princess Fireworks Inc. of Mishawaka, Ind.
   In New York City, police prepared for the Fourth of July by
confiscating more than a ton of illegal fireworks in lower
Manhattan. City authorities said they have confiscated 3,000 cases
of illegal fireworks this year, compared with 2,815 last year.
   On Lake of the Ozarks in Missouri, one holiday weekend gathering
ended in flames Saturday when a 2,500-gallon gasoline tank ruptured
and exploded outside a floating restaurant, injuring at least six
people, one critically, authorities said.
   In upstate New York's Saratoga County, the Calico Dancers' 1988
Goodtime Powwow celebrating American Indian heritage and culture
concluded Sunday with a War Dance Society ceremonial dance. Indian
singers and dancers from as far away as Oklahoma performed and
competed.
   ``The dance is the matrix that draws everyone together,'' said
dancer and emcee Don Brennan of Rockville, Conn.

<TEXT>
   A U.N. special envoy on Sunday urged
members of the Afghan resistance to turn to their traditional local
councils in forming a government after the departure of Soviet
troops from Afghanistan.
   Diego Cordovez, who negotiated the April 14 Geneva accord under
which Soviet troops are withdrawing from Afghanistan, leaves
Tuesday for the Afghan capital of Kabul. There, he is expected to
meet with President Najib to try to negotiate a coalition
government, which would include the Moslem rebels.
   But the seven-party Afghan guerrilla alliance, headquartered in
this northwestern Pakistani city, has voted to boycott Cordovez'
efforts, despite opposition from a more moderate faction. The
alliance has rejected any coalition government with Afghanistan's
ruling Marxist government, which the U.S.-backed rebels are
fighting.
   ``We would never accept a coalition government with the
communists,'' said Mahmood Hasrat, an Afghan elder who spoke on
behalf of about 200 refugees who met with Cordovez in a tent.
   ``We will fight until the last Soviet soldier and the communist
regime (of President Najib) leaves Afghanistan,'' said Hasrat. He
echoed guerrilla charges that the Geneva accord did not bring peace
to Afghanistan because the resistance was not involved in the
negotiations.
   Cordovez pleaded with the rebels to turn to a solution ``that
will have the legitimacy to gather the kind of support you need now
to have a government acceptable to all Afghan people.''
   The Peshawar-based Afghan resistance has said that the Moslem
rebels will hold elections within 90 days in Afghanistan and in
Pakistani refugee camps, which house about 4 million Afghan
refugees.
   ``This is the time for you to use your traditions to solve your
problems in a political way and in an Afghan way,'' said Cordovez.
The traditional Afghan decision-making method is a council whose
members are chosen from the communities.
   Cordovez said everyone, including the Soviet Union, ``will
accept the decision of Afghans taken in a legitimate manner.''
   Cordovez pointed out that half of the estimated 115,000 Soviet
troops, which first invaded Afghanistan in 1979, will be gone by
Feb. 15. He said 30,000 Soviet troops have already left Afghanistan.
   ``As Soviet troops withdraw, if military confrontation
continues, only Afghans will die,'' he said. ``The whole Afghan
countryside will be in your hands and you can decide what to do
with your country.''
   Cordovez arrived in Pakistan from Tehran, where he met with
Afghan guerrillas in exiled in Iran. Most of them are members of
the Shia sect of Islam, a minority in Sunni Moslem-dominated
Afghanistan. The U.N. official said the majority of them complained
they had been left out of the guerrilla movement.
   Since arriving in Pakistan Thursday, Cordovez also met with
President Zia ul-Haq.

<TEXT>
   A 75-year-old black
nationalist leader jailed for terrorism has been discharged from a
hospital and returned to prison, a newspaper reported Sunday.
   Zephania Mothopeng, president of the outlawed Pan-Africanist
Congress (PAC), was said to be seriously ill when he was
transferred from Johannesburg Prison to Florence Nightingale
Hospital on Monday last week.
   Mothopeng's wife Urbania told City Press her husband had since
been returned to prison but was in good spirits.
   The nature of Mothopeng's illness has not been disclosed. The
article did not give any information on his condition or when he
was returned to prison.
   Mothopeng is serving a 15-year prison term for his conviction
under the Terrorism Act and is not due for release until 1994.
   Mothopeng has actively opposed the white-led government since
the early 1940s, when he joined the African National Congress.
   He and some other members broke away from the ANC in 1959 and
formed the PAC, which advocates black self-reliance and opposes the
ANC's contacts with activists of other races. Both organizations
have been outlawed in South Africa since 1960.
   Mothopeng was arrested for the first time in 1960 after he
helped organize a civil disobedience campaign that culminated with
the Sharpeville shootings, in which police killed 69 black
protesters.
   In addition to his work as an activist, Mothopeng has served as
a teacher and education administrator. He is one of several
prominent black leaders whose release is demanded by many black
politicians as a precondition for negotiating with the government.

<TEXT>
   President Reagan declared Sunday that the U.S.
downing of an Iran Air jetliner was ``a proper defensive action,''
and Pentagon officials said Navy officers believed they were
fending off an attacking Iranian fighter that ignored seven
warnings.
   Reagan called the incident a ``terrible human tragedy'' and
said, ``We deeply regret any loss of life.'' The incident occurred
on the second of two days of skirmishes between Iran and the United
States on oil lanes through the Strait of Hormuz, at the mouth of
the Persian Gulf.
   The Islamic Republic News Agency said the plane, a commercial
Airbus carrying 290 people from the Iranian port of Bandar Abbas to
Dubai, was hit by two U.S. missiles and that all aboard were
presumed dead.
   Adm. William Crowe, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said
there had been a visual sighting as the missiles hit the craft and
that eyewitnesses had seen the craft ``disintegrate.'' He said the
incoming craft had not been visually identified when the missiles
were fired, but defended the commander who he said ordered the
firing in the belief his ship was in jeopardy.
   Crowe said it had been thought the incoming aircraft was an
Iranian F-14 fighter, the most lethal plane owned by Iran.
   The U.S. ship which fired was the USS Vincennes, an Aegis class
cruiser equipped with sophisticated radar and missiles.
   The airliner was four or five miles outside the commercial
corridor between Dubai and a joint civilian-military airfield at
Bandar Abbas, and flew directly at the Vincennes as the U.S.
warship exchanged fire with several of Iran's Boghammer gunboats,
said Crowe.
   The Vincennes and a smaller U.S. frigate, the USS Elmer
Montgomery, firing 5-inch guns, sank two Iranian patrol boats and
damaged a third, Pentagon officials said. The number of victims
aboard the Iranian boats was not known.
   No American casualties were reported.
   Tehran Radio, monitored in Cyprus, was quick to react to the
incident. ``America's crime today in downing an Iranian Airbus is
... new evidence of American crimes and mischiefs, crimes which
expose America's nature more than ever before,'' it said.
   Vice President George Bush, who has a lock on the Republican
presidential nomination, learned about the incident during a
conference call with Reagan and other senior administration
officials. He had no immediate comment, a spokeswoman said.
   Michael Dukakis, his likely Democratic opponent in November,
said, ``Plainly our armed forces have a right to defend themselves
when attacked.''
   He said, however, that the downing of the plane is further
evidence that ``the war between Iran and Iraq must end. We and the
international community have a responsibility to stop it.''
   Jesse Jackson said, ``It is not enough just to be sorry. ... The
U.S. has been more than a year in the Persian Gulf, and still there
is no defined policy, still no firm commitment to end the war.''
   Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., chairman of the Senate Armed Services
Committee, said he would ``reserve judgment until receiving further
information.''
   Another member of the committee, Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich., said
that from what he knows so far, ``it seems reasonable to believe
that the U.S. Navy acted in an appropriate manner.''
   ``Like others, I, too, have many unanswered questions,'' Levin
said. ``I'll reserve final judgment until I have more details.''
   The Pentagon early Sunday announced that the Vincennes had shot
down an Iranian F-14, but hours later sources told The Associated
Press that military officials had come to believe the
identification of the craft was wrong. At 1:30 p.m. EDT, Crowe
appeared before reporters to say he now believed the downed
aircraft was a civilian airliner.
   As Crowe spoke, Reagan _ in a statement read by spokesman Marlin
Fitzwater _ promised a full investigation by the Defense Department.
   Reagan said the Iran Air jet was headed directly for the USS
Vincennes.
   ``When the aircraft failed to heed repeated warnings, the
Vincennes followed standing orders and widely publicized
procedures, firing to protect itself against possible attack,''
Reagan said in his statement.
   Crowe expressed ``deep regret'' over the loss of life but
emphasized time and again that the military commanders in the
Persian Gulf had ``acted with good judgment'' in that they believed
American ships were being approached by a hostile aircraft.
   As the aircraft approached the Vincennes, it dropped in altitude
and accelerated to about 450 knots, as a warplane would do if
preparing to fire an anti-ship missile, Crowe said.
   Those actions and electronic transmissions ``led us to believe
it was a military aircraft,'' he said.
   In the seven minutes between the detection of the aircraft on
U.S. radar and the firing of the missiles, Crowe said, the U.S.
warship ``sent three warnings on a civilian distress network and
four warnings on a military distress network.''
   The Iranian aircraft ``neither answered nor changed its
course,'' he said. ``There were electronic warnings on the
Vincennes that led it to believe the aircraft was an Iranian
F-14,'' but which Crowe described as classified and refused to
discuss. Most civilian aircraft emit signals identifying themselves
and monitor specific civilian radio frequencies.
   When the Iranian aircraft was ``about nine miles away, the
Vincennes fired two Standard surface-to-air-missiles, at least one
of which hit at an approximate range of six miles,'' Crowe said.
   Crowe said he did not intend to imply that Iran sent the
airliner into the combat zone on purpose, but said ``if a country's
going to wage combat operations in a certain area and then send a
commercial airliner in there during that, of course it's an
accident waiting to happen.''
   An Iranian F-4 was sighted a few minutes later by U.S. radar,
but did not approach the combat zone, and no U.S. warplanes were in
the area, he said.
   ``The important points here are, the commanding officer has a
responsibility to protect his people, his unit. He is engaged
already in a surface action, he has a minimum amount of time,''
Crowe said. ``It is logical to conclude that while he is firing and
they are approaching him and an aircraft lifts off from Iran, goes
toward him, steady course, high speed, decreasing altitude, will
not vary, will not contact him _ it's a more logical conclusion
that he may very well be in jeopardy.''
   Crowe noted that U.S. forces had been alerted that the Iranians
``might attempt to carry out attacks against our forces over the
July Fourth holiday period'' and that there had been a number of
F-14 flights in the area over the last few days.
   In his statement, Reagan said, ``I am saddened to report that it
appears that in a proper defensive action by the USS Vincennes this
morning in the Persian Gulf an Iranian airliner was shot down over
the Strait of Hormuz.''
   Fitzwater said Reagan, who was at Camp David for the Fourth of
July weekend, received a telephone call at 4:52 a.m. EDT from
national security adviser Colin Powell, who told him that U.S.
forces believed they had shot down an Iranian F-14. He received
another update in writing at 8:11 a.m. that noted the Iranian claim
that a civilian jetliner had been downed.
   At 9:50 a.m., he was told that the Iranian allegations might be
correct.
   Fitzwater said Reagan had no plans to return to the White House
before noon Monday.
   ``The only U.S. interest in the Persian Gulf is peace, and this
tragedy reinforces the need to achieve that goal with all possible
speed,'' Reagan said.
   On Saturday, the Montgomery responded to a distress call from a
Danish merchant vessel, the Karama Maersk, that was being harassed
by Iranian gunboats in the Strait of Hormuz, the Pentagon said in a
statement. The Montgomery dispersed the Iranian craft with a
warning shot, believed to be the first exchange of fire since the
United States sank an Iranian frigate, badly damaged a second, and
set fire to two Iranian oil platforms last April.

<HEAD>Ruling Party Picks Gov. Angeloz As 1989 Presidential Candidate</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Raul Alfonsin's
governing party chose Cordoba Provincial Gov. Eduardo Angeloz as
its 1989 presidential candidate Sunday in a nationwide internal
party election, party officials said.
   Radical Civic Union Party officials said returns covering more
than half the votes cast gave an overwhelming 88 percent to Angeloz
and his vice presidential running mate Juan M. Casella and 12
percent to their opponents, Sen. Luis Leon and Carlos Yeregui.
   Angeloz, 56, supported by Alfonsin and most leaders of the
center-left Radical Civic Union, had been expected to win easily
over Leon, who had said his candidacy was aimed simply at providing
party members with a choice.
   Final official results were not expected until Monday. Officials
estimated about 30 percent of the party's 2.2 million members cast
votes in the Sunday election.
   The leading opposition Justicialist (Peronist) Party was to
select its presidential candidate in a similar election Saturday
pitting Buenos Aires Provincial Gov. Antonio Cafiero against La
Rioja Gov. Carlos Menem.
   National elections are expected in May or June of 1989 to
replace Alfonsin, whose election to a six-year term in 1983 ended
nearly eight years of rightist military rule.
   Alfonsin is prohibited by the constitution from seeking a second
consecutive term.
   Leon admitted defeat even before the party polls closed and
congratulated Angeloz, now in his second term as governor of the
north-central province of Cordoba, on his victory.
   Backed by his party's moderate and rightist sectors, Angeloz
based his campaign on the need to modernize the nation's
debt-ridden economy, spur techological advancement and continue
programs of privatization and economic deregulation begun by
Alfonsin.

<DATELINE>VINCENNES, Ind. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The USS Vincennes' destruction of an
Iranian jetliner with 290 people aboard was a tragic result of its
captain and crew doing their duty, members of the ship's namesake
organization said Sunday.
   ``On the basis of what we can find out on news reports, the
captain acted the best way he knew how,'' said William E. Brooks
Jr., publisher of the Vincennes Sun-Commercial newspaper and a
member of the USS Vincennes Association.
   The association is made up mostly of men who served on the two
ships of that name during World War II. The current USS Vincennes
is the fourth naval vessel to bear the name of this southwestern
Indiana city.
   ``The other thing, in my opinon, this is the other side of the
Stark incident,'' Brooks said, referring to the May 1987 Iraqi jet
attack on the U.S. missile frigate Stark, which cost 37 American
lives.
   ``If the captain had stayed there and not done anything, we
might have been reading about loss of life on the Vincennes,''
Brroks said.
   The Islamic Republic News Agency said the Iran Air jet shot down
was a commercial Airbus carrying 290 people from the Iranian port
of Bandar Abbas to Dubai. The news agency said all aboard were
presumed dead.
   The two U.S. missiles were fired by USS Vincennes, an Aegis
class cruiser equipped with sophisticated radar and missiles.
   The current 9,600-ton Vincennes was the third in a new class of
guided missile Aegis-type cruisers and was christened April 14,
1984, at Pascagoula, Miss., and commisioned on July 6, 1985.
   It was the fourth U.S. Navy ship to bear the name of Vincennes.
The first was commissioned in 1826 and assigned to service in the
Pacific. It was decommissioned in 1867.
   Association member Gene Thurmond, 65, of Evansville, served on
the second USS Vincennes, a heavy cruiser commissioned in 1937 and
sunk by Japanese cruisers in 1942.
   A light cruiser named for Vincennes was commissioned in 1944 and
received six battle stars for service in World War II before it was
decommissioned in September 1946.
   Thurmond said he met the captain of the newest ship, Capt. Will
C. Rogers III, at an association meeting in Vincennes in August.
   ``I met the skipper last summer and he's a real captain and
level-headed and I think he did the proper thing,'' he said.
   The association's 500 members meet annually in Vincennes to
reminisce about their years of service and pay tribute to the dead,
said Vincennes liaison officer and honorary member, Bill Toth, 64.
   Members of the association were considering a tribute to the 290
people who were killed.
   ``There's no way of rectifying this kind of situation, so all we
can do is remember these people,'' Toth said. ``Our prayers and
those of the commuity are with the ship's commander and crew
members.''
   ``From what I've heard about the ship, it's like everybody on it
is family and they're trying to be the best in the Navy,'' Toth
said. ``But, as this incident shows, that can be good and bad.''
   ``It's a hard situation today. Until all the knews came in it
was hard to really understand what happened over there,'' said
Toth. ``We have such a close tie to the ship and its personnel, we
regret the situation that happened as far as the civilians
involved.''
   ``But the captain defended the ship and did what he thought was
best for the personnel,'' he added.

<HEAD>Trauma Center Has Received $100,000 In Five Years From Elvis Fans</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The Elvis Presley Memorial Trauma Center
has received $100,000 Elvis-inspired donations from as far away as
Tasmania since being named for the rocker in 1983, officials say.
   That amounts to about half of the donations to the trauma
center, part of the Regional Medical Center at Memphis, in that
time.
   The hospital receives a couple of Presley-inspired contributions
each week, said Marler Stone, director of development for the
Regional Medical Center at Memphis Foundation, which raises money
for the hospital.
   ``It would be wrong to create the image that Elvis fans
worldwide are raising millions of dollars for the trauma center,''
he said recently. ``We naturally wish that were true.''
   About 50 fan clubs have donated to the hospital, including
groups in England, Brazil and Tasmania, said center spokeswoman
Linda Brigance.
   Among them is the Elvis Presley Burning Love Fan Club, which
will have donated about $20,000 to the trauma center by the end of
this year, said club president Bill DeNight of Streamwood, Ill.
   ``I'm just carrying on where Elvis left off,'' DeNight said.

   A former rooming house left over from an
earlier era of Catskill Mountains summer tourism is the home of the
ultra-traditional Catholic convent that's been disrupted by the
puzzling story of a novice nun taken away by her family.
   Rising behind the aging rooming house that has housed the St.
Joseph's Novitiate Convent for four years are the still skeletal
beginnings of a new novitiate, what the Rev. Clarence Kelly calls
``a proper convent.''
   Kelly said last week he doesn't envision any problems filling
the new building, although it would mean doubling the ranks of the
fledgling order of the Daughters of Mary, a group of nuns opposed
to modernism and church reform.
   ``We've had very encouraging signs,'' he said.
   Kelly foresees growth in a brand of Catholicism that isn't
recognized by the local diocese, doesn't accept the reforms of the
Second Vatican Council but endorses the ultimate infallibility of
the pope.
   Members of the community perform all Masses in Latin, and the
sisters wear traditional long black habits, unlike those of many
orders that have accepted modern dress.
   Attention was drawn to so-called ``traditional Catholicism''
last week when Archbishop Marcel Lefebvre was excommunicated for
defying the pope after years of fighting the ``satanic influence''
of modernism.
   The St. Joseph Novitiate itself was in the news last week when
the family of a 22-year-old novice nun, until recently members of
an Ohio church affiliated with the convent, came to the Catskills
and abducted the young woman.
   Although officials in New York issued arrest warrants for the
woman's father and brothers, Mary Sue Greve told officials in Ohio
after a four-day disappearance that she was not being held against
her will.
   Kelly said he fears Miss Greve, known at the convent as Sister
Mary Cecilia, had been brainwashed by her family.
   The convent is run by the St. Pius V association, which also
operates affiliated schools and churches on Long Island and in
Cincinnati and Detroit. It was during his involvement with those
institutions that Kelly saw a need for ``an unliberated convent
situation,'' he said in a recent interview.
   ``There was always a pressing need to have sisters,'' said
Kelly, the convent's spiritual adviser. ``I received petitions from
young women who wanted to become religious, to become nuns, but
they could not find a traditional convent.''
   Traditional means ``the way that religious congregations were
before the changes of the Second Vatican Council'' 23 years ago,
Kelly said.
   At the convent there are 10 postulants, women who took a
temporary vow of silence at the end of their first year of
preparation for the sisterhood; a second-year novice, and three
professed nuns. Six other professed nuns teach at an affiliated
school on Long Island.
   The nuns follow a strict schedule, with everyone rising at 5:30
a.m., attending several Masses, devotions and classes, performing
chores like lawn work and washing dishes and fulfilling one of the
convent's missions through a designated holy hour.
   ``The sisters have as their primary work, the work of consoling
the heart of the son of God,'' said Kelly.
   During this holy hour, 5 p.m. to 6 p.m. every day but Thursday
when it's 11 p.m. to midnight, nuns try to make up for people's
indifference to Christ's sacrifices, said Kelly. This duty fulfills
the mission of St. Margaret Mary, described by Kelly as ``a very
obscure nun in an obscure convent in France.''
   He said women training to be nuns are free to leave the vocation
at any time and are given many opportunities to do so during their
nine-year training.
   Miss Greve's family kept her whereabouts a secret. ``This has
been tough on all of us. Mary Sue is very upset,'' one of her
brothers said.
   Ohio officials quoted the Greves as saying they took their
daughter because they were upset by a lack of communication with
the convent.
   But Kelly said the Greves could have visited their daughter.
``They didn't even avail themselves of all the opportunities they
had to visit her.''
   He speculated on why the family took the young woman from the
convent.
   ``Mrs. Greve does not want her pretty daughter to be a nun,'' he
said.

   Iran said an Iran Air jetliner with about
290 passengers crashed near the Strait of Hormuz in the Persian
Gulf on Sunday, and claimed the U.S. Navy shot it down while
battling Iranian gunboats.
   Iran said 100 bodies had been recovered by Iranian rescue teams
and that everyone aboard the Airbus A300 jetliner was feared dead.
   A Penatagon spokesman, Lt. Col. Arnold Williams, said in
Washington that U.S. officials are ``aware of the Iranian claim, of
the press reports of it, and we're checking it out.''
   The Pentagon said U.S. Navy forces in the gulf sank two Iranian
patrol boats and downed an F-14 fighter jet in the Strait of Hormuz
on Sunday during an exchange of fire that began at about 9:40 a.m.
(2:10 a.m. EDT).
   Iran's official Islamic Republic News Agency said the Iran Air
jetliner took off at 10:15 a.m. (2:45 a.m. EDT) and crashed at
about 10:30 a.m. after the airliner was hit by two surface-to-air
missiles fired by an American warship during the clashes.
   Mike Stepp, another spokesman for the Defense Department, said
American and Iranian forces exchanged fire after a U.S. helicopter
was shot at by an Iranian gunship in the strait. No American
casualties were reported.
   U.S. Navy officials in the gulf denied the Iranian claim that
U.S. forces had downed the jetliner. The officials spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   IRNA said the aircraft was ``downed by the U.S. fleets'' while
on a flight to Dubai, in the United Arab Emirates, from the Iranian
port city of Bandar Abbas.
   An unidentified Iranian military source denied that U.S. forces
had downed an F-14 jet, according to another IRNA report. The
official said ``no Iranian F-14 jet fighters were flying over the
waterway.''
   Iran has U.S.-made military aircraft left over from before the
Islamic revolution in 1979.
   Lt. Col. Keith Schneider, another Pentagon spokesman, said of
the aircraft down by U.S. forces: ``It was clearly identified as an
F-14, it ignored warnings and was approaching in a hostile manner.''
   An Iranian official quoted by IRNA said the fighting erupted
when U.S. forces attacked Iranian gunboats ``on routine patrol''
Sunday.
   Two Iranian crewmen were reported missing in the exchange, IRNA
said.
   It quoted the officer as saying U.S. helicopter gunships
attacked the gunboats, which also came under fire from U.S.
warships. He claimed one of the helicopters was shot down.
   Minutes after that, the Airbus flew over the combat zone soon
after it had taken off from Bandar Abbas, where there is a major
naval and air base, IRNA said.
   IRNA quoted the Iranian official as saying the plane exploded in
mid-air above the Iranian island of Hengam, south of Bandar Abbas.
   Shipping sources said the crash site was 30 miles south of
Bandar Abbas.
   IRNA said witnesses on the island saw the plane disintergrate
and fall into the sea from an altitude of 7,500 feet.
   Tehran Radio, also monitored in Cyprus, later said: ``America's
crime today in downing an Iranian Airbus is ... new evidence of
American crimes and mischiefs, crimes which expose America's nature
more than ever before.''
   IRNA reported that 100 bodies, many of them badly mutilated,
were recovered from the waterway by Iranian rescue teams.
   IRNA said Iranian navy frogmen found pieces of wreckage on the
seabed ``showing that the plane had been hit by a missile.''
   U.S. warships and waves of helicopters and tugboats rushed out
to search for survivors.
   The gulf, roiled by the eight-year war between Iran and Iraq, is
patrolled by warships from the Soviet Union and the United States
in addition to other Western countries. There were no reports of
military action in the gulf Sunday.
   If reports and casualties are confirmed, the Airbus crash would
be the 6th-worst airline disaster in history.
   It was the second crash involving an Airbus in a week.
   One week ago, an Air France plane, one of the new A320 Airbus
models, crashed near the French-Swiss border. Three people were
killed and 133 survived.
   Airbus is produced by Airbus Industrie, a European consortium.
According to a company statement in March, a total of 404 A300
planes were in service with 60 airlines.

   A U.S. Navy ship shot down an Iranian
jetliner over the Persian Gulf on Sunday and Iran said all 290
people aboard were killed. The United States said its forces
mistook the jet for a warplane.
   Iran's official Islamic Republic News Agency said the Iran Air
jet was hit by two American missiles minutes after leaving Iran for
Dubai in the United Arab Emirates. All the passengers were believed
killed after the plane ``exploded in the sky,'' IRNA said. The
report was monitored in Nicosia, Cyprus.

   President Reagan declared Sunday that the U.S.
downing of an Iran Air jetliner was ``a proper defensive action,''
and Pentagon officials said Navy officers believed they were
fending off an attacking Iranian fighter that ignored seven
warnings.
   Reagan called the incident a ``terrible human tragedy'' and
said, ``We deeply regret any loss of life.'' The incident occurred
on the second of two days of skirmishes between Iran and the United
States on oil lanes through the Strait of Hormuz, at the mouth of
the Persian Gulf.
   The Islamic Republic News Agency said the plane, a commercial
Airbus carrying 290 people from the Iranian port of Bandar Abbas to
Dubai, was hit by two U.S. missiles and that all aboard were

   Meteorologists know that a stalled high
pressure system and a split jet stream are causing the drought in
Middle America, but they are at a loss to explain why the phenomena
occurred and when they might end.
   In a high-pressure system, also known as an anticyclone, dry air
gradually descends toward the ground and moves in a clockwise
pattern around the center.
   It is the opposite of a cyclone, where rising, moist,
counterclockwise winds promote the development of clouds, and thus
rain.

that have helped make that possible may soon be gone.
   ``We think it is probably the most productive Congress in recent
history,'' House Speaker Jim Wright, D-Texas, said.
   The record backs up that statement.

   Think of recent Democratic National
Conventions. Sweet harmony doesn't exactly spring to mind.
   More like bitter divisions that spilled over into street battles
in Chicago 20 years ago. Or the last-ditch floor fight that Sen.
Edward M. Kennedy waged against President Carter in 1980. Or a
nasty little firefight over selection of a new party chairman four
years ago that weakened Walter F. Mondale almost on the eve of his
nomination.
   But this time officials in Michael Dukakis' campaign and other
Democrats, pointing to quick work on platform, rules and
credentials issues, say they expect to present a unified front to
their four-day prime-time television audience beginning on July 18.
Barring an unexpected disruption by Jesse Jackson or his supporters
over the selection of a vice presidential running mate, of course.

   George Bush was talking about crime and
politics and Democrats versus Republicans, sounding for all the
world like the presidential candidate he is.
   But something was missing _ there was no specific mention of his
Democratic rival, Michael Dukakis. The reason _ this New York
speech was not a campaign trip, it was a ``party building'' mission
paid for by the GOP.
   The semantic distinction _ in which Bush attacks liberals or
Democrats but not Dukakis by name _ has allowed the vice president
to take several trips on the Republican Party tab at a time when
his own campaign funds are virtually gone.

   Those digits have become synonymous with high technology, urban

<HEAD>Government Teamster-Takeover Efforts Dissolve Union's Ties to GOP</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MATT YANCEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Labor Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A government attempt to take control of the
Teamsters has dissolved a three-decade marriage of convenience
between the nation's largest union and the Republican Party while
forging an unlikely alliance: Michael Dukakis and Sen. Orrin Hatch.
   ``To try and put in trusteeship a complete union like the
International Brotherhood of Teamsters ... smacks of
totalitarianism,'' says Hatch, a conservative Republican from Utah,
who is an outspoken critic of unions but fervent defender of
Teamster President Jackie Presser.
   ``It's the kind of thing you would expect in Russia, not the
United States,'' Hatch said of the government's suit last week
branding the union corrupt and seeking to dethrone Presser and 17
other top Teamster officers.
   Dukakis also condemned the Justice Department's use of the 1970
Racketeering Influenced Corrupt Organization (RICO) Act to place
the 1.6-million-member union under the supervision of a
court-appointed trustee.
   ``Such an extreme remedy is fundamentally inconsistent with the
very concept of independent and democratic trade unions,'' he said
in a letter to AFL-CIO President Lane Kirkland.
   Dukakis, who with union support has wrapped up the Democratic
presidential nomination, said he would vigorously prosecute and
seek to remove from office individual union leaders, corporate
executives or government appointees who misuse their jobs.
   ``However, I simply see no need to resort to an extreme legal
approach that would unnecessarily deprive rank-and-file union
members of their right of self-governance,'' he said.
   Equally ironic is what Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., and Vice
President George Bush have in common on the government's proposal
to take over the Teamsters: Neither has anything to say about it.
   ``Don't wait on us for a reaction,'' said a spokesman for
Kennedy, the liberal, pro-union chairman of the Senate Labor and
Human Resources Committee, whose brother Robert succeeded in
putting both Presser's father and former Teamster President Jimmy
Hoffa in jail.
   Bush declined a solicitation from labor leaders to all of the
presidential candidates to criticize the government's anticipated
takeover attempt when U.S. Attorney Rudolph Giuliani of Manhattan
was still putting the suit together.
   New York Rep. Jack Kemp and former Secretary of State Alexander
Haig, two one-time contenders for the GOP nomination, both eagerly
responded to Teamster pleas for support, as did all of the
Democratic candidates.
   With the biggest campaign war chest of any group in the country
_ 50 percent larger than the American Medical Association's this
year _ Teamster leaders for decades have danced with politicians
from both parties while prosecutors pursued them in court.
   Lost in the glare of publicity over the Teamsters' support for
Republicans Dwight Eisenhower, Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan for
the presidency was the flow of most of its money in congressional
and state races to Democrats.
   In 1986, for example, 87 percent of the Teamsters' campaign
money in Senate and House races went to Democrats. But with a
political fund of $4 million two years ago and $6 million so far
this year, the union has plenty of cash to spread among members of
both parties.
   ``The majority of Teamsters are probably Democrats,'' Hatch
said. ``Most of the people they endorse are Democrats. But that has
nothing to do with the philosophical and legal approach being used
here. This is not what you do to free institutions in our society.''
   Whether it's the campaign dollars or the fact that one of every
70 workers in the country is a Teamster, the union has no problem
raising an outcry from politicians to counter the government's
prosecutors.
   Prior to the filing of the suit last week in New York, at least
269 of the 535 members of Congress signed letters to Attorney
General Edwin Meese III condemning the suit as ``a precedent which
strikes at the very foundation of government.''
   ``If the U.S. government can move in and take over the Teamsters
union, they can take over the United Steel Workers, the First
National Bank, any business, any entity,'' said Sen. Paul Simon,
D-Ill., a former Democratic presidential contender.
   Presser's indictment in 1986 on embezzlement charges fractured a
Teamster alliance with Republican administrations and presidential
candidates dating back to the middle 1950s.
   But Teamster presidents have been indicted before _ three of the
last four of them under Republican administrations _ and the wounds
have always healed by the time the next presidential election came
around.
   However, when leaks to the press about the government's takeover
suit began surfacing a year ago, the Teamsters abandoned any
lingering notion of cutting their own deal this year with the GOP
against the Democratic leanings of the rest of the labor movement.
   Anticipation of the suit and reports that three more just like
it were being prepared against the Laborers, International
Longshoreman's Association and the Hotel and Restaurant Workers
helped catalyze a reunion of the Teamsters and the AFL-CIO last
October after a 30-year rift.
   ``The future will hold that the Teamsters union being back in
the AFL-CIO, joining forces together, are going to create the
greatest political giant this country has ever seen,'' Presser said
then.
   The AFL-CIO is forgoing an official presidential endorsement
this year until after the Republican National Convention in August,
when it will convene and formally poll the presidents of its 91
affiliated unions.
   But like many other union chiefs, Weldon Mathis, who is acting
as the Teamsters' president while Presser recovers from brain and
lung surgery for cancer, has spoken favorably of Dukakis.
   ``The bloom was off the lily a long time ago with the Reagan
administration and the Republican Party,'' said one senior Teamster
official. ``We'll take our lead from the AFL-CIO.''

   When thousands of General Electric Co. workers
across the nation vote on a proposed three-year contract later this
week, one union will urge approval of the contract but call it
inadequate at the same time.
   Members of the Pittsburgh-based United Electrical, Radio and
Machine Workers of America (UE), which claims a membership of
9,400, and the Washington, D.C.-based International Union of
Electronic, Salaried Technical and Furniture Workers (IUE), which
has about 40,000 members, will vote on the contract Wednesday and
Thursday, UE union spokesman Peter Gilmore said Saturday.
   The unions represent GE production and maintenance workers
nationwide. Their last contract expired June 30.
   After meeting to discuss the proposal Friday, the UE voted to
recommend acceptance rather than call for a strike because of
disagreement among the leadership of the IUE, Gilmore said.
   He said some IUE negotiators recommended acceptance of the
proposal and others called for rejection. Some executive boards of
major IUE locals voted to approved it while others rejected it, he
said.
   ``Under the current circumstances, an effective nationwide
strike against GE is impossible,'' the union said in a written
statement. ``While we firmly believe the company's offer is
inadequate, we cannot lead our members into a long strike that has
virtually no chance of success because of the lack of unity.''
   The agreement was reached June 26, between the company and the
two unions, which are the largest of the 14 GE unions and the only
ones to negotiate national contracts. The other 12, with a combined
membership of about 20,000, also were represented on the
negotiating team, Gilmore said.
   ``It's a very modest agreement'' with minimal increases in wages
and cost-of-living adjustments, he said. Workers would lose in
other areas, including medical insurance, night-shift pay and wages
for newly-hired workers, he said.
   Lessons learned from a 102-day strike in 1969 show that ``it
takes total unity of all unions in GE to take this company on and
win,'' the UE statement said.
   GE thinks the agreement is fair, said spokesman Jack Batty, who
works at the company's Fairfield, Conn., headquarters.
   ``We believe that it's a good contract and that once the union
membership understands it, they will ratify it,'' Batty said.
   The agreement calls for three wage increases: 2.5 percent this
year, 1.5 percent in 1989 and 1.5 percent in 1990 plus a $165 cash
payment in July 1988 and a $900 payment in June 1989.

   The United States, already the world's largest
debtor country, could see its foreign debt increase to more than $2
trillion by 1995, seriously cutting into American living standards,
a congressional study said.
   The report relesed Saturday by the Congressional Research
Service rejected claims by the Reagan administration that the
country's status as a large debtor country was not cause for
concern.
   The study predicted that while the country's trade deficit will
finally show an improvement this year, after deteriorating for six
years, this improvement could be short-lived.
   The report forecast that the deficit in the broadest measure of
trade, the current account, would fall to $151 billion this year,
down slightly from a record $154 billion deficit in 1987.
   The report predicted a further decrease to $129 billion in 1989,
saying these improvements were virtually assured given the declines
in the value of the dollar that have already taken place.
   But the study said the trade deficit would begin rising again
sharply in the 1990s and could hit $326 billion by 1995.
   The study said it based this outlook on assumptions that the
dollar does not decline further in value and that current growth
rates and interest rates in the United States relative to other
countries remain essentially unchanged.
   The dollar has actually been rising in recent weeks, prompting
concern among economists who believe the U.S. currency still needs
to drop for the U.S. trade deficit to narrow further. A cheaper
dollar makes U.S. exports more attractive on overseas markets and
imports more expensive to Americans.
   If the dollar does not decline, the report projected that the
heavy import penetration the United States has suffered through the
1980s will continue.
   The string of higher trade imbalances would mean that the
country's position as a net debtor would worsen as well.
   The government announced on Thursday that total U.S. foreign
debt increased to $368.2 billion at the end of 1987, further
lengthening the country's lead as the world's largest debtor
nation. This means that foreigners now own more in U.S. investments
than Americans own in overseas investments.
   The congressional study projected that U.S. foreign debt would
climb to $576 billion at the end of this year and surpass $1
trillion in 1991. By the end of 1995, the total foreign debt would
be $2.06 trillion, or one-fourth of the country's total gross
national product, the report said.
   A debt of that size would require an annual payment of $96
billion to foreigners to service the debt, an amount equal to 1.2
percent of the projected GNP for that year, the study said.
   That would mean if the GNP increased by 3 percent in 1995, a
generally optimistic outlook, one-third of the increase would be
siphoned off to meet debt obligations to foreigners.
   ``If, on the other hand, we are pessimistic about real growth
prospects, seeing only a 1 percent annual increase as likely, then
debt service would tend to preclude any improvement in U.S. living
standards in the next decade,'' the report said.
   Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas, who requested the congressional
study, said it showed that without a dramatic change in the
country's trade policies, the size of America's foreign debt will
explode over the next six years.
   Bentsen was a key sponsor of an omnibus trade measure recently
vetoed by President Reagan. He is leading the effort to get a
stripped-down version less objectionable to Reagan passed into law.
   ``Even though the trade deficit will go down a little this year
and again a little bit next year, unless trade policies
dramatically change, then they're going to start up,'' Bentsen said.
   The congressional study, while presenting a pessimistic view of
what could happen, is not out of line with projections made by
private economists. Morgan Guaranty Trust Co. said that depending
on what happens to the dollar, world growth rates and the U.S.
federal budget deficit, America's foreign debt burden could be
anywhere from $900 billion to $2.5 trillion by 1995.
   The U.S. debt of $368.2 billion for 1987 was 36.8 percent higher
than the previous year and served to illustrate how fast the
foreign debt is accumulating. The United States had an investment
cushion of $89.4 billion as recently as 1983, making it the world's
largest creditor nation, a position now held by Japan.
   Democratic critics hope to make the country's slide from the
largest creditor nation to the largest debtor nation an issue in
this year's presidential campaign. They contend that the burgeoning
foreign debt is eroding America's political and economic standing
in the world.
   But the administration, sensitive to the issue in an election
year, held a lengthy briefing last Thursday, when the new debt
total was released, to argue that the United States should not be
considered in a class with such large Third World debtors as
Brazil, Mexico and Argentina.
   ``We are nowhere near getting into trouble,'' Commerce
Undersecretary Robert Ortner told reporters. He said that
foreigners still own no more than 5 percent of the assets in an
economy that turns out $4.5 trillion in goods and services a year.
   But private economists contend that the growing foreign debt
makes the United States more vulnerable to pressure from foreign
investors, driving up U.S. interest rates and heightening the
volatility of the dollar.

<HEAD>Report Criticizes Federal Efforts to Help Female Business Owners</HEAD>

   Most federal efforts to halt discrimination
against female business owners have been ``superficial,
unimaginative and lacking in long-term commitment,'' a bipartisan
House report said.
   The report released Saturday by the Small Business Committee
also concluded that ``the federal government has been seriously
delinquent'' in helping female entrepreneurs gain access to
government contracts and subcontracts.
   Furthermore, the report said, women face gender-related barriers
that severely limit their access to business credit. It also said
that statistics on female entrepreneurs are insufficient to help
policy makers deal with these problems.
   Women owned 25 percent of U.S. businesses in 1982 but received
only 10 percent of business receipts, according to the Census
Bureau. Business size and type account for some but not all of the
discrepancy, the report said.
   ``There are other, less defensible reasons _ namely sex
stereotyping and continued discrimination,'' the report said.
``Women have had to work harder, wait longer, manage with fewer
dollars, and be content with smaller operations just to maintain
their present levels of independence and business success.''
   The chairman of the Small Business Committee, John J. LaFalce,
D-N.Y., plans to introduce an Omnibus Women's Business Ownership
bill later this month along with Rep. Patricia Schroeder, D-Colo.,
head of the Congressional Caucus on Women's Issues.
   In a statement accompanying his committee's report, LaFalce said
that the bill will address the four principal barriers blocking
equal economic status for female entrepreneurs _ lack of management
training and technical assistance, lack of access to capital, ``the
virtual exclusion'' of women from government contracts, and lack of
accurate and timely data on female-owned businesses.
   According to the report, women owned less than 5 percent of
American businesses 15 years ago compared with 28 percent today.
They are starting firms at twice the rate of men and are expected
to own 50 percent of U.S. businesses by the year 2000.
   ``These women are part of the most educated generation of women
that has ever existed. They are a gold mine of human capital,'' the
report said. ``It is essential that remaining barriers to women
entrepreneurship be eliminated.''
   The committee recommended a number of steps to correct problems
that came to light during a series of hearings on the issue. Among
them:
   _Establishment of a Women's Business Council with both public
and private representatives, to develop an action plan that
includes goals and timetables. The plan would be due at the end of
1989.
   _Creating a guaranteed mini-loan program within the Small
Business Administration for loans of up to $50,000. Firms in the
fast-growing service sector, where female-owned businesses are
concentrated, would be targeted.
   _Requiring the Federal Reserve to limit inquiries into marital
status for commercial loans, and requiring lending institutions to
notify clients of their right to learn why they were denied loans.
   _Forming a public-private partnership fund to provide management
training and technical assistance for female business owners.
   _Reforming the federal procurement system to give women greater
access to contracts and subcontracts, including annual
participation goals.
   _Requiring large government contractors, by statute, to
establish subcontracting goals for female-owned businesses.
   _Developing a high-quality computer listing of firms controlled
by women.

<HEAD>Coleco Shuts New York Plants Until July 11, Newspaper Reports</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WEST HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Struggling Coleco Industries Inc.
has closed its upstate New York production facilitied until July
11, a published report said.
   Security guards at the plants in Amsterdam and Mayfield, N.Y.,
near Albany, said workers were given Friday off as a paid holiday,
The Hartford Courant reported Saturday.
   The guards said the plants also would be closed this week, but
employees would not be paid for that time off.
   About 110 people work at the Coleco plants.
   The company's ability to make this week's payroll was questioned
after a New York court issued a restraining order Wednesday,
freezing Coleco bank accounts in Albany at the request of Coleco
suppliers who had not been paid.
   Officials from the International Leatherworkers Union, which
represents Coleco's production workers at the New York plants,
could not be reached for comment Friday.
   The company's West Hartford headquarters were closed for the
long holiday weekend, but a security guard said the offices would
reopen Tuesday.
   Company Chairman Morton E. Handel said Friday his company has
enough funds to carry it through another week. He said a group of
12 foreign and domestic lenders to which Coleco owes $103 million
agreed to provide money to the company through Thursday.
   Handel, recuperating at home from open-heart surgery, said no
steps had been taking toward a bankruptcy filing. If anything is to
happen, it would be this week, he said.
   On Thursday, the West Hartford toy company gave up on its plan
to restructure its debts after it had repeatedly extended a
deadline for agreement by debtholders.
   Coleco had proposed exchanging $335 million of bonds for a
combination of new bonds and stock. The company said the exchange
would save it millions of dollars a year in interest payments and
supply cash for the business.
   The original exchange terms were rejected by some of the
bondholders, who contended the exchange would have reduced the
value of their investment without requiring similar sacrifices from
Coleco's stockholders and bankers.
   The company produces such well-known toys as Cabbage Patch Kids
dolls and Scrabble board games.
   Coleco has been trying since January to cut costs and
restructure its finances. It lost $47.4 million in the quarter that
ended April 2. It has lost money in four of the past five years,
including $215 million in the last two years.

   Illinois businessman Edward F. Heil has
purchased 6.2 percent of Morrison Knudsen Corp.'s shares, but Wall
Street analysts dismissed speculation he might try to take over the
engineering, shipbuilding and construction company.
   In a statement filed with federal regulators, Heil, of the
Chicago suburb Downers Grove, said his purchase of 670,300 Morrison
Knudsen shares was intended as an investment, but also said he
wanted to win a seat on the company's board of directors.
   Heil is president of American Environmental Construction Co.
Neither he nor his attorney could be reached for comment.
   Morrison Knudsen, a major contractor for the Pentagon, released
a statement Friday saying the company was aware of Heil's filing
and ``reviewing the situation closely with its advisers.''
   The company said it knew little about Heil, but noted he is a
defendant in a lawsuit brought by the state of Illinois. Morrison
Knudsen said the suit charged Heil and his company ``with a variety
of fraudulent activities in connection with a construction project
on which Heil's company was a prime contractor.''
   According to Ileen Lasko of the Illinois attorney general's
office, Heil was among 14 contracting companies and their officers
named in a civil suit brought by the state over a major Chicago
convention center project.
   Illinois Attorney General Neil F. Hartigan charged the
contractors with submitting phony bills for labor and materials
through dummy minority contractors.
   Morrison Knudsen said the suit sought to prevent any company of
which Heil is a director from doing business with Illinois. Since
Morrison Knudsen has a contract on a public project in Illinois and
is bidding on another, the company said it was ``investigating
other potential violations of applicable law by Heil.''
   Meanwhile, Wall Street analysts discounted a possible takeover
attempt by Heil.
   ``He doesn't represent a real threat'' to Morrison Knudsen, said
Robert McCoy, an analyst at the investment firm Kidder Peabody &
Co. Inc.
   The company has ``disappointed certain people with their real
estate write-offs and shipbuilding write-offs ... but they're
trying to make their business more competitive and there is no
reason to believe they won't,'' McCoy said.
   In the statement filed with the Securities and Exchange
Commission, Heil revealed that he had acquired the outstanding
Morrison Knudsen common stock from May 12 through Thursday at
prices ranging from just over $36 to nearly $41 a share. There are
about 10.9 million shares of common stock outstanding.
   Morrison Knudsen stock closed at $42 in trading Friday on the
New York Stock Exchange, up 75 cents a share.
   Morrison Knudsen posted an operating loss for 1987, but has been
undergoing a restructuring that included closing its real estate
development subsidiary.
   In the first quarter, Morrison Knudsen reported it earned $6.59
million, up 9 percent from $6.03 million in the first three months
of 1987.
   As a defense against any unfriendly takeover attempts, the
company adopted a ``poison pill'' stock purchase right in 1986.
   Under the plan, Morrison Knudsen shareholders can buy additional
stock at a discount. While such a plan might not prevent a
takeover, it would force hostile buyers to negotiate with the
company's board before making such a move.

   Mark IV Industries Inc., which failed in
a takeover bid for RTE Corp. during the spring, has turned its
sights toward Armtek Corp., documents filed with the Federal Trade
Commission show.
   Mark IV, Amherst, N.Y., said it planned a substantial purchase
of Armtek stock and was ``considering the possibility of acquiring
the entire equity interest in Armtek through a negotiated merger
transaction or by means of a cash tender offer,'' the company said
in an FTC filing disclosed Friday.
   Mark IV, based in West Amherst, N.Y., said it now owns less than
5 percent of Armtek's stock.
   Robert H. Jones, an Armtek spokesman, said any bid would be
unsolicited.
   Armtek's stock rose 75 cents a share to close at $32 in heavy
New York Stock Exchange trading Friday.
   Armtek, formerly known as Armstrong Rubber Co., had $1.2 billion
in sales last year.
   On June 1, Armtek sold its largest unit, Armstrong Tire Co., to
Pirelli Group, an Italian tire maker, for $197 million, capping a
