   U.S. District Judge William J.
Campbell, who prosecuted gangster Al Capone and was the
longest-tenured federal judge in the United States, has died of
complications from surgery. He was 83.
   Campbell, who died Wednesday, was one of the prosecutors who got
the notorious Chicago hoodlum convicted on tax-evasion charges.
Capone died in 1947.
   Campbell, appointed to the federal bench in 1940 by President
Franklin D. Roosevelt, rose to become chief judge in Illinois'
northern district and twice declined a seat on the 7th U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals.
   He also was considered for a position to the Supreme Court.
   ``As a judge, he brought a dignity to the office that has seldom
been matched,'' said Chicago attorney Don H. Reuben. ``When you
were in his courtroom, you knew you were in a courtroom.''
   A New Deal liberal, he fought passionately against a Chicago
social club that refused to admit a black federal judge and for a
public defender program in the federal courts.
   During the stormy 1968 Democratic National Convention in
Chicago, Reuben said Campbell calmed a group of protesters in his
courtroom with demands for ``proper courtroom behavior.''
   Campbell retired in 1970 but continued to hear federal cases in
Illinois, California and for the past nine years at the federal
courthouse here.
   Funeral services were scheduled Friday.
   He is survived by his wife, Marie A. Campbell, five daughters
and three sons.

<HEAD>Judge Orders Acupuncture For Man Facing Fifth Drunken Driving
Charge</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A judge has ordered a man facing his fifth
drunken-driving charge to undergo acupuncture in an attempt to
overcome a drinking problem that his lawyer says has resisted
conventional treatment.
   ``I'm not sure if acupuncture works, but it's obvious nothing
else works with you,'' Boulder County Judge Thomas Reed told John
Ball, 31.
   Reed issued the order Thursday at the request of Public Defender
Cary Lacklen, a defense attorney who believes acupuncture can play
a valuable role in fighting substance abuse.
   Reed also ordered Ball to use Anabuse, a drug that reacts
violently with alcohol in a person's body, to ensure that he does
no more drinking.
   ``By ordering (acupuncture), I'm not advocating it as a cure,''
Reed said later. ``It can't hurt, right?''
   Prosecutors Thursday charged Ball with driving under the
influence, reckless driving, two counts of hit-and-run, and driving
without a valid license. He is accused of running into a line of
parked cars in Boulder on Oct. 14 and driving off, later slamming
into another car several blocks away.
   Lacklen said he got the idea for acupuncture therapy after
reading about a New York City program that uses acupuncture to
treat crack addicts.

<HEAD>Challenger In Connecticut State Senate Race Thinks Opponent Would
Do Better</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SHELTON, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   For most political candidates, it usually
goes without saying that they think they could do a better job than
their opponents.
   Not so in a state Senate race.
   Steven Debish, 20, of Shelton says he wouldn't mind voting for
Republican incumbent George Gunther on Nov. 8.
   Debish is the Democrat challenging Gunther.
   ``(Gunther) would probably do a better job, be more effective in
the next two years because of his long standing in the Senate,''
Debish said earlier this week. ``Most of the things I see in the
newspaper that he stands for, I agree with.''
   Debish, a sophomore at Southern Connecticut State University in
nearby New Haven, gives himself a very slim chance of defeating the
11-term incumbent.
   ``I just don't want to upset anybody,'' Debish said. ``He's
doing his job.''
   Many challengers demand face-to-face confrontations in debates,
but a few weeks ago Debish declined to meet Gunther in a debate.
   ``We decided he has so much experience, he would probably just
kill me,'' Debish said. ``He's just an old pro. I wish I had his
experience in public speaking and debating.''
   Debish's entry into the contest wasn't exactly a direct result
of a mandate or groundswell of support by local party leaders.
   ``Well, they needed a person to go up against him and I guess
they couldn't find anyone. Almost anyone who goes up against him
would probably lose,'' he said.
   Debish said he wanted to get some experience running for office
and has his sights set on something other than the Legislature. ``I
want to be mayor of Shelton someday,'' he said.
   Despite Debish's deference to the incumbent, Gunther can't quite
remember his challenger's name.
   ``What is it? Devlin? Dempsey?'' Gunther asked recently.

<HEAD>Trump Plans Major Upgrading of Eastern Shuttle</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARCY GORDON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Developer Donald Trump says he's considering
such amenities as valet parking in upgrading Eastern Airlines'
shuttle service, and plans to spend ``tremendous amounts of money.''
   Trump agreed Oct. 12 to purchase the profitable Northeast
shuttle from parent Texas Air Corp. for $365 million in cash. If it
survives government scrutiny and a legal challenge by some of
Eastern's unions, the sale is expected to be completed by Dec. 15.
   The operation, which links New York with Boston and Washington
and is used mostly by business travelers, will be renamed the Trump
Shuttle. The blue-silver Eastern aircraft will be redecorated and
emblazoned with red, black and gold stripes, and will carry Trump's
name on their tails.
   ``I want to run an absolutely quality operation,'' Trump said
Friday in a telephone interview. The real estate magnate said he is
ready to spend ``tremendous amounts of money on each individual
airplane'' to accomplish his goal.
   The interiors of the 17 Boeing 727s will be completely redone
using high-quality leather, carpeting and other materials, Trump
said. He pledged to also stress safety by having each plane
thoroughly checked and X-rayed, using procedures Trump claimed
would be more stringent than Miami-based Eastern currently employs.
   The shuttle's airport terminals in New York, Boston and
Washington also will be refurbished, Trump said. He said he is
thinking seriously about introducing valet parking at the three
airports for shuttle customers _ a service that would likely be an
industry first.
   Trump said these improvements would take priority over possible
plans to expand the shuttle service to Atlantic City, N.J., where
he owns three casino-hotels. The developer runs a helicopter
service between New York and Atlantic City.
   Trump asserted that he will be able to carry out his expensive
plans without raising fares on the shuttle, which competes with a
rival service operated by Pan Am Corp.
   ``I'm just going to do it,'' he said. ``It's a substantial
investment, but it's something that has to be done.''

   A 77-year-old Brazilian priest caught carrying 20
pounds of cocaine into Switzerland was convicted and sentenced to
eight years in prison for breaking narcotics laws.
   A Geneva jury court Friday sentenced three Brazilian
co-defendants to jail terms of up to 15 years for membership in a
ring smuggling the drug from Brazil to Milan, Italy.
   The Rev. Lino Christ, a Roman Catholic parish priest in Rio de
Janeiro, admitted he frequently traveled to Geneva to raise funds
for charity.
   But a co-defendant implicated him in the ring, where couriers
were rewarded with $10,000 a trip. Christ shared an apartment with
a mistress in Rio's plush Copacabana district, the court was told.
   ``All Brazilian priests have a little business on the side,''
Christ testified in court, but he did not elaborate.
   He was arrested in December after Geneva airport customs
officials seized cocaine with a street value of $1.8 million hidden
under a false bottom of his suitcase.

   A missing painting worth $175,000 was
found in the home of a 62-year-old woman who allegedly lifted the
masterpiece off its hook at a museum and tucked it in her shopping
bag, Dutch television reported.
   ``Landscape With Farmhouse And Haystack'' by the 17th-century
Dutch master Jan van Gooyen, was stolen from the Twenthe National
Museum in Enschede on Wednesday, according to the television report
Friday.
   The report said the woman had simply lifted the painting off its
hook and hidden it in a shopping bag during the museum's opening
hours.
   According to the report, the woman had also taken a self
portrait by modern Dutch artist Charley Toorop from the National
Museum Kroeller-Mueller near this eastern Dutch city in June. That
painting was worth $20,000, the report said.
   The report did not whether the woman has been charged.

<HEAD>Dukakis Goes On The Attack As Bush Stays Home Today</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD L. VERNACI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Democrat Michael Dukakis went on the attack heading into a
weekend of campaigning from the deep South to New England, while
Republican George Bush was staying home today as the race for the
White House approached its final two weeks.
   The Democratic presidential nominee, lagging behind Bush in the
polls, was taking his case to television, both in a series of new,
fiery commercials and in news interviews as he sought to raise his
stock among the voters.
   In his television commercials, unveiled Friday, Dukakis calls
Bush's attacks on his record ``full of lies and he knows it.''
   However, the Bush campaign has responded that the ads are
truthful.
   Dukakis, who has been criticized for lacking passion, appears
angry in an ad titled ``Counterpunch.''
   ``I'm fed up with it,'' he says as he clicks off a television
set showing a ``negative'' commercial for Bush.
   The Bush commercial, showing Dukakis riding in a tank, attacks
the Massachusetts governor on defense issues. But Dukakis says in
his ad that both candidates want a strong defense.
   ``So this isn't about defense issues. It's about dragging the
truth into the gutter. And I'm not going to let them do it,''
Dukakis says.
   Bush, meanwhile, called for an international agreement allowing
on-site inspections on demand to enforce a ban on chemical weapons.
   ``The eventual combination of chemical weapons and ballistic
missiles could put new destructive power in the hands of
governments with terrorist records,'' Bush told an audience of
about 1,200 at the University of Toledo in Ohio.
   However, Bush did not mention that as vice president, he cast
tie-breaking votes in the Senate in 1983 and 1986 in favor of U.S.
chemical weapon arsenals.
   Those votes disturbed Bush's mother, Dorothy, who criticized him
after the second vote and then received a call from President
Reagan explaining why her son voted as he did.
   Bush today was meeting at his home in Washington with Armando
Valladares, who was freed six years ago after serving 22 years in a
Cuban prison. Valladares, who wrote about his ordeal in the book
``Against All Hope,'' has been cited by the vice president as one
of his heroes.
   Bush also planned to attend an Italian-American dinner tonight
in Washington.
   Dukakis, too, was to attend that dinner, but his appearance was
scheduled for later in the evening.
   The Democrat was starting his day with a joint appearance with
vice presidential running mate Lloyd Bentsen before a group of
pipefitters in Beaumont, Texas, before heading to a barbecue in
Georgia and then a television interview in Atlanta. Later he was
flying to Washington and then to Boston.
   Dukakis, who was taping an interview today with CNN, has made
himself available for network television interviews over the last
couple of days as he seeks to seize the offensive in the remaining
days of the presidential campaign.
   But Republican vice presidential candidate Dan Quayle said the
Democrats' fall in the polls is so steep, there can be no return.
   ``We have a strategy to win Tennessee,'' Quayle said.
``Actually, I think the man from Massachusetts ... they might end
up on election night maybe having a one-state strategy or maybe
they'll just have a District of Columbia strategy.''

<HEAD>Justice O'Connor Undergoes Surgery for Breast Cancer</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, the first woman
on the Supreme Court, is recovering from surgery for breast cancer
and expects to return to work in 10 days.
   O'Connor, 58, underwent surgery Friday at Georgetown University
Hospital. But few details on the procedure or follow-up treatment
were provided.
   ``I underwent surgery for breast cancer. It was found to exist
in a very early form and stage,'' O'Connor said in a statement
released by Supreme Court spokeswoman Toni House. ``The prognosis
is for total recovery. I do not anticipate missing any oral
arguments,'' O'Connor said.
   The court is on a two-week recess and returns to hear arguments
Oct. 31. The justices also will meet in private conference Oct. 28,
but it was not known whether O'Connor will attend.
   Dr. Robert S. Siegel, assistant professor of medicine and
director of a cancer treatment unit at George Washington University
Hospital, said O'Connor's plan for a quick return to the bench
would be ``a remarkably fast recovery'' and may be good news for
her prognosis.
   He said the speed also may indicate the cancer was caught at a
very early time and there is no indication it has spread to other
organs in the body. Siegel is not involved in O'Connor's case.
   It was not disclosed whether O'Connor's surgery was for removal
of a lump or the entire breast. There also were no details on
whether the justice will receive any form of continuing treatment
and when the cancer was discovered.
   Siegel said that typically when breast cancer is detected at a
very early stage, the patient can choose to have either a
lumpectomy, in which only the tumor is removed from the breast, or
a modified radical mastectomy, in which the entire breast is
removed.
   Either procedure usually involves removal of the lymph glands
under the arm.
   For a lumpectomy, patients generally are released from the
hospital in three to four days, Siegel said, but return in two
weeks to start radiation therapy.
   The radiation usually is given once a day, four to five days a
week, for four to six weeks.
   For most patients, this is a difficult period because the
radiation causes fatigue.
   ``It would be difficult to maintain a full schedule'' while
receiving radiation, said Siegel. But he noted that some patients
handle it much more easily than others.
   Patients receiving a modified radical mastectomy do not require
radiation therapy and usually return to work within two to three
weeks.
   O'Connor's operation came just a year after first lady Nancy
Reagan underwent surgery to remove her left breast after laboratory
tests revealed a quarter-inch cancerous lesion.
   Mrs. Reagan, then 66, recovered quickly from the Oct. 17, 1987
surgery, a modified radical mastectomy.
   O'Connor's health, as far as is publicly known, has been good.
She underwent an appendectomy in March and was soon back at work.
   Supreme Court justices generally jealously guard the details of
their health.
   In 1986, The Associated Press inquired about a tremor _ a
nodding motion of O'Connor's head _ that has been apparent to court
watchers for years. At times, the justice will rest her chin on her
hands during the court's public oral argument sessions.
   O'Connor sent back this reply through the court's public
information office: ``I was unaware of such a tendency.'' As for
resting her chin on her hands, she said it is ``an old and perhaps
unfortunate habit.''
   O'Connor's appointment to be a justice by President Reagan in
1981 ended 191 years of male exclusivity on the high court.
   A political and judicial conservative, she has been a champion
of states' rights and enhanced police power.
   But while she generally sides with the conservative wing of the
court anchored by Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist, she has cast
important moderate votes in such areas as sex discrimination and
affirmative action.
   She was a virtual unknown on the national scene when Reagan
picked her to replace Potter Stewart, who had retired.
   O'Connor served as an Arizona state judge and before that was a
member of that state's Legislature.

<HEAD>Most Private Employers Will Be Barred From Using Lie Detector
Tests</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MATT YANCEY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Beginning in December, most private employers
will be barred by law from using polygraphs and other types of lie
detectors to screen job applicants or test the current employees
except in rare circumstances.
   Under new regulations issued Friday by the Labor Department,
employers can be fined up to $10,000 for requiring a job seeker or
employee already on their payrolls to submit to a polygraph exam
for voice stress analysis.
   The regulations, which take effect Dec. 27, implement
legislation passed by Congress and signed by President Reagan last
June outlawing about 85 percent of the current use of lie detector
tests.
   The congressional Office of Technology Assessment had estimated
that 2 million polygraph examinations were conducted last year _ 90
percent of them by private employers.
   Some 7.2 million employers nationwide will be required to put up
posters in December summarizing the prohibitions and exemptions and
outlining the rights of any worker asked to take a lie detector
test.
   Fred Alvarez, assistant labor secretary for employment
standards, said the posters will be mailed out in the next three or
four weeks.
   In addition to the fines, anyone required to take the test in
violation of the new law can sue employers in federal and state
courts for relief, such as employment reinstatement, promotion and
any payment of lost wages and benefits.
   Exempted from protection under the ban are employees of federal,
state and local governments or of federal contractors engaged in
national security, intelligence or top secret activities.
   Also exempted from the ban are prospective employees of armored
car, security alarm and security guard firms hired to protect
operations affecting health and safety, national security or money.
   Pharmaceutical concerns or companies manufacturing, distributing
or dispensing controlled substances also can require job applicants
to submit to a lie detector test, but only for those people who
would have direct access to the drugs.
   Polygraphs still can be used by employers to investigate
specific incidents of theft, embezzlement or sabotage, but not a
persistent problem, such as recurring inventory shortages.
   But any workers asked to submit to a polygraph exam under those
conditions must be given at least 48 hours advance notice and a
statement in advance telling them of their rights, including the
right to refuse the test or to terminate it at any time.
   The pre-test statement also must explain the specific incident
or activity being investigated and the basis for the employer's
suspicion that the person asked to take the exam was involved in it.
   Results of a polygraph test or refusal to submit to such an exam
cannot be used alone as a basis for taking any action against an
employee. The regulations also forbid disclosure of the test
results to anyone other than the employee without the employee's
consent or a court order.

<DATELINE>BETHESDA, Md. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A National Institutes of Health advisory
committee says it is ``acceptable'' to use the tissue from
intentionally aborted fetuses in medical research.
   However, the panel's 13-3 vote making that fundamental finding _
the core question it was asked to decide _ carefully avoided taking
a position on the morality of abortion itself or, for that matter,
the morality of using the remains of planned abortions for research.
   ``It is of moral relevance that human fetal tissue for research
has been obtained from induced abortions,'' said the draft document
completed Friday. ``However, in light of the fact that abortion is
legal and that the research in question is intended to achieve
significant medical goals, the panel concludes that the use of such
tissue is acceptable public policy.''
   It went on to say that the committee position ``must not obscure
the profound moral dimensions of the issue of abortion, nor the
principled positions that divide scholars, scientists and the
public at large. It is not the charge of this panel to attempt to
settle the issue of abortion or to weigh the worthiness of
competing principled perspectives on abortion itself.''
   Researchers are hopeful that transplanting fetal brain cells
into the brains of people with diabetes and Parkinson's disease
could provide an effective treatment _ perhaps in three to five
years _ and that more study could lead to similar treatments for a
number of other serious diseases for which there now is no cure.
   The new procedure has been used experimentally on a handful of
patients in other countries with promising results. The advisory
committee was formed to examine moral, ethical, legal and
scientific issues after NIH scientists sought permission to
transplant fetal brain cells into some Parkinson's sufferers.
   The committee's agreement on a lengthy draft document Friday
will not become final before Nov. 30, the date for submission of
mail ballots on whether to adopt the exact language that will be
written by NIH employees working to polish the principles adopted
by the panel over five days of discussion going back to last month.
   In the draft version approved Friday, the panel laid out a
number of recommended safeguards once research proceeds:
   _``The decision to terminate a pregnancy and the procedures of
abortion should be kept independent from the retrieval and use of
fetal tissue.''
   _``Proper and informed consent should be obtained from the
pregnant woman.''
   _``Payments and other forms of remuneration and compensation
associated with the procurement of fetal tissue should be
prohibited, except payment for reasonable expenses occasioned by
the actual retrieval, storage, preparation and transportation of
the tissues.''
   _``Potential recipients of such tissues, as well as any and all
other participants, including researchers, hospital personnel and
other service-providers, should be properly informed as to the
source of the tissues in question.''
   The panel also concluded that donations of fetal tissue to a
family member or acquaintance for medical purposes should be banned
to discourage women from becoming pregnant with the intention of
having an abortion and donating the tissue to a sick relative or
close friend.

accurate than two years ago, but medical practitioners should have
at least two tests performed before informing an infected patient
that he has the disease, according to a study by experts.
   Thomas A. O'Brien, a Du Pont Co. expert on AIDS testing, said
some medical workers are still telling patients that they have the
disease after only a single test.
   ``The current tests are very, very good, but they are not 100
percent,'' O'Brien said Friday. He noted that only 10 percent of
patients testing positive in an initial screening test for AIDS
actually have the disease.
   O'Brien presented a report compiled by testing experts after
three days of discussion at the National Bureau of Standards. The
report recommends that AIDS testing should not be considered
definitive until both screening and confirmatory tests are
completed. And, in some cases, even further testing is needed.
   He said the testing sequence should start with a screening test
called ELISA (for enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay). For those
with a positive ELISA test, he added, there should then be a
confirmation test called a Western Blot.
   Both laboratory tests are based on the presence in the patient's
bloodstream of antibodies to the human immunodeficiency virus, or
HIV, which causes AIDS, or acquired immune deficiency syndrome.
   ``If you test 10,000 people for HIV, the current tests would
give an ELISA positive on 0.2 percent (or 20),'' said O'Brien.
``Out of the 10,000, the Western Blot (confirming test) would be
needed only on those 20 samples.''
   O'Brien said that only about 10 percent of people testing
positive by the ELISA test are actually infected with AIDS. As a
result, he said, ``You don't tell someone that they are HIV
positive on ELISA alone.''
   Some samples, O'Brien said, cannot be confirmed as positive or
negative even with both ELISA and Western Blot. He said the expert
panel recommended that this ``indeterminate'' group undergo
additional and different tests before a final report is made to the
patient.
   AIDS is a contagious disease that attacks the body's immune
system and makes it incapable of defending against infection. The
disease is not now curable, and no one has been known to recover
from it. As of Monday, there have been 75,768 AIDS cases reported
in the United States, and 42,653 have died.
   AIDS testing was one of four subjects addressed in a unique
gathering of medical testing experts at the National Bureau of
Standards. The group included testing specialists from government
agencies, industry and hospitals. Officials said the purpose of the
three-day meeting was to draw up recommendations for assuring that
the nation's laboratories are providing accurate testing.
   The group issued recommended ways to improve testing for AIDS,
for drug abuse, for cholesterol, and for the Pap smear cancer
screening test.
   Among the recommendations were:
   _Though testing for cholesterol was found generally to be
accurate in hospital laboratories, the group recommended that
cholesterol measurements made in a physician's office laboratory
should be studied, since these labs often are not part of a routine
quality control program.
   _A common system of measuring the presence and concentration of
drugs in urine tests should be established nationally. The experts
said that there now exists a common reference material (a sample
containing pure drugs at known concentrations) for marijuana, but
not for other controlled drugs such as cocaine, PCP or
amphetamines. The report said that such a common reference material
would increase the accuracy of drug testing.
   _The panel also said that the analysis of urine specimens can
identify an exposure to drugs, but it does not measure the level of
impairment. The experts recommended that research be conducted to
determine how such impairment can be measured accurately.
   _The experts said that false-negative findings in Pap smears, a
test for the presence of cervical cancer, are running as high as 4
percent to 8 percent, but that these errors often are a result of
poor technique in collecting specimens. The panel recommended that
the Pap specimen collection technique be standardized and that
women patients receive better instructions in how to prepare for
this test.
   Dr. Beverly B. Kraemer, a laboratory director at St. John's
Mercy Medical Center in St. Louis, Mo., said though there are
inaccuracies in Pap smear tests, the procedure is still ``a woman's
best friend'' in the war against cancer and ``one of the most
successful lifesaving laboratory procedures'' now commonly used.

<HEAD>Gallaudet Installs First Deaf President</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The first deaf president in the history of
124-year-old Gallaudet University, the nation's only university for
the hearing impaired, challenged the students in his inaugural
address to ``try and do everything under the sun.''
   ``Today Gallaudet is not simply installing its eighth
president,'' said Dr. I. King Jordan, who was selected as president
last March after a tumultuous week of protests over the naming of a
hearing woman to the post.
   ``We are recognizing the right of every disabled person to have
unlimited goals and expectations,'' Jordan told about 2,400
faculty, staff and students jammed into the school's gym for his
installation as president Friday.
   The hearing woman who initially was named to the post, Dr.
Elisabeth Ann Zinser, eventually stepped aside and Jordan, 45, was
selected.
   Jordan, who lost his hearing in a motorcycle accident in 1968,
is a 1973 Gallaudet graduate who earned masters and doctorate
degrees from the University of Tennessee. He served as dean of
Gallaudet's School of Arts and Sciences before being chosen as
president.
   He pledged to expand programs preparing Gallaudet's 2,200
undergraduate and graduate student for a larger place in the
hearing world.
   ``I challenge every person in this room to take up his
motivation, and have the courage to try and do anything under the
sun,'' Jordan said. ``I challenge you to succeed.''
   Urging the school to use the energy generated during the week of
protests to continue lobbying for the rights of the hearing
impaired everywhere, Jordan said, ``Gallaudet must become a working
model for open access everywhere. Take the events of last March to
your hearts and your hands to make the world responsive to deaf
people.''
   Lawrence Newman, president of the National Association of the
Deaf, told the crowd that Jordan's installation ``marks the
emancipation of deaf people from the shackles of limitations.''
   Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, whose brother is deaf, delivered part
of his remarks in sign language, which drew appreciative cheers
from the audience. He called those who struggled for selection of a
deaf leader ``my heroes,'' and told an anecdote about how far the
story of Jordan's selection had spread:
   ``Last summer, I was in Europe, and a group of deaf students
wanted to know about the president,'' Harkin said. ``They weren't
interested in Ronald Reagan. They wanted to hear about Dr. Jordan.''

<HEAD>TVA Charged With Violating NRC Regulations Through False Statement</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GUY DARST</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Repeated false statements by the head of the
Tennessee Valley Authority's nuclear program constitute a violation
of federal regulations by the TVA, the Nuclear Regulatory
Commission charges.
   However, the commission said it has decided not to take action
on the original statements by Steven A. White, a former head of the
Navy's nuclear submarine program, ``as a matter of prosecutorial
discretion.''
   The NRC also decided, according to a letter sent Friday to TVA
Chairman Marvin Runyon, not to assess a fine because ``a civil
penalty for this matter is not necessary to further focus the
attention of either TVA or the industry on the importance of
complete candor'' in dealing with the commission, the letter said.
   The TVA Board of Directors, in a statement read by spokeswoman
Becky Akers, defended White while praising the NRC's decision not
to assess a fine.
   ``We continue to believe that Admiral White did not intend to
mislead the NRC on this or any other matter,'' the statement said.
   ``We are pleased that the Nuclear Regulatory Commission did not
fine TVA upon completion of this investigation,'' according to the
statement. ``However, we are disappointed that TVA received a
notice of a violation on statements relating to Appendix B. ... The
TVA board is fully committed to operating a safe and reliable
nuclear power program.''
   The NRC's letter said the TVA has 30 days to admit or deny the
allegations and to show what corrections it has undertaken if the
charge is admitted.
   The case concerns a March 1986 letter White wrote to the
commission. White had been hired a few months earlier to shape up
TVA's nearly collapsed nuclear effort that had seen the closure of
five reactors.
   White wrote the NRC that there had been ``no pervasive breakdown
of the quality assurance program'' at the Watts Bar plant under
construction near Spring City, Tenn.
   He repeated that assurance in a follow-up letter and in
statements to NRC investigators, adding that he had received a
review of the program by outside experts.
   In fact, according to previous commission testimony to Congress
and according to Friday's letter, White had not even spoken with
seven of the nine people he identified as constituting the outside
review group, and the two people he did speak with had not reviewed
TVA's quality assurance efforts but had only given opinions of the
work of an earlier in-house group.
   ``No one identified by Mr. White as being a member of the second
group understood there to be such a group,'' the letter said.
   In April, Ben B. Hayes, director of the NRC's Office of
Investigations testified before a congressional panel that White
was playing word games. Hayes told the investigations subcommittee
of the House Energy and Commerce Committee that White apparently
was intending ``pervasive'' to mean ``100 percent.'' While
technically true, TVA's quality assurance had serious and
widespread problems, he said.
   At the NRC staff, an internal group headed by James Taylor,
assistant executive director for operations, concluded that White's
statements were not deliberately false. The matter was referred to
the Justice Department, which has refused to comment on the status
of the case.
   White has denied any wrongdoing and has been supported by the
TVA board. He is retiring in January.
   The letter, signed by Taylor, now deputy executive director for
regional operations, said the violation was being assessed even
though White is leaving because ``TVA management as a whole is
responsible for the quality of communications with the NRC.''
   ``Both the individuals involved and the organization must share
responsibility for the actions giving rise to these violations, but
the fundamental premise of our regulatory system makes TVA, as the
licensee, ultimately responsible,'' the letter said.
   ``The NRC must be confident that it can rely on the information
furnished by a licensee,'' the letter said. `` ... Anything less
than accurate and complete statements to the commission cannot and
will not be tolerated.''

   The Democratic slide in the polls is so
steep that Michael Dukakis could be left with a ``one state
strategy'' on election day, Republican vice presidential nominee
Dan Quayle said.
   And as he stumped through the South on Friday, Quayle worked to
steal a line his Democratic counterpart used to devastating effect
in the vice presidential debate.
   Dukakis, he declared, ``is no Harry Truman'' and won't be making
a comeback.
   A confident-sounding Quayle said there's a sharp contrast
between Republican and Democratic election strategies.
   Quayle told college students in Tennessee that the GOP has a
``50-state strategy'' and made light of reports that Dukakis is
narrowing his focus to about 18 states with enough electoral votes
for a win.
   ``We have a strategy to win Tennessee,'' Quayle said.
``Actually, I think the man from Massachusetts ... they might end
up on election night maybe having a one-state strategy or maybe
they'll just have a District of Columbia strategy.''
   The quip that Dukakis ``is no Harry Truman'' comes straight from
Democrat Lloyd Bentsen who scored the premier moment of the vice
presidential debate when he told Quayle, ``You're no Jack Kennedy.''
   Quayle described a conversation between Tennessee Sen. Albert
Gore Jr., and his father, a former senator.
   ``I guess he (Gore Jr.) called home and talked to his dad, when
his father told him that this reminded him of the Truman campaign
in 1948,'' Quayle said. ``Let me tell you something, I don't know
Michael Dukakis, I never served with Michael Dukakis, Michael
Dukakis is not a good friend of mine.
   ``But I know this: Michael Dukakis is no Harry Truman,'' said
Quayle.
   Bentsen used precisely that cadence in setting up Quayle for his
debate zinger, and aides said Friday's speech was the first time
Quayle had referred to the put-down in a campaign appearance.
   Republican presidential nominee George Bush had also set the
stage when he used a similar line in a self-deprecating fashion
during a dinner in New York on Thursday night.
   Quayle insisted the comparison was apt because many were
``trying to compare the Dukakis campaign to the Truman campaign.''
   Truman was perceived to be trailing throughout the 1948
campaign, but ended up defeating Republican Thomas Dewey.
   Most polls show the GOP ticket this year with a persistent lead,
and Quayle insisted there will be no comeback this time around.
   During his Southern swing, Quayle spoke to the college students
in Tennessee at a noisy rally where critics and backers competed
for attention, repeatedly interrupting the candidate.
   ``They've always been negative and they always will be,'' Quayle
said. ``They are the party of failure. We are the party of success.
   ``They can go ahead and yell,'' he said. ``We're going to talk
about issues and ideas.''
   Throughout his Southern swing, Quayle took a tough stance
against a tax increase and in favor of defense as he courted
conservative voters in a region where most polls suggest Bush is
strong.
   At a flag-waving riverside rally in Georgia, Quayle made a frank
appeal for backing from conservative southern Democrats.
   Dukakis, he argued, is ``not in the southern Democratic
tradition of national defense. Disenchanted Democrats are fed up
with liberalism.''
   He got some cheering news from the crowd, including one sign
which read ``Thank God Quayle is no JFK.''

   Vice President George Bush is taking a weekend
breather from the campaign trail after warning Ohio supporters
against complacency and boasting that running mate Dan Quayle has
been ``tested by steel.''
   Bush was keeping a light schedule today, meting with Armando
Valladares, author of ``Against All Hope,'' a harrowing account of
his years as a political prisoner in a Cuban prison. Bush mentioned
the book in his last debate with Michael Dukakis.
   Bush tonight was attending an Italian-American banquet in
Washington where Dukakis also was putting in a separate appearance.
   After taking Sunday off, Bush heads back on the road Monday for
a swing through New England, with stops in Waterford, Conn.,
Portland, Maine, and Burlington, Vt.
   On Tuesday, he launches a drive-to-the-wire, cross-country trip
for the final two weeks of the campaign, starting with a return to
Ohio for the sixth time since the GOP convention.
   In a high school gym in Lancaster, Ohio, and earlier in a hockey
arena in Troy, Ohio, Bush laid the rhetorical wood to his
opponent's policies and lauded his running mate.
   Bush said the Indiana senator has ``been tempered by steel. He's
been taking a pounding out there. Steel gets tough when it's under
fire.''
   Ohio, with 23 electoral votes, ``is a critical state,'' said
Bush.
   ``The election still hangs in the balance, and I am running _
even though things feel pretty good _ just as though I were 10
points back,'' he told 2,000 people at Lancaster High School, where
he was surrounded by cheerleaders in a gym festooned with balloons
and a huge, hand-lettered ``Good Night, Mike'' banner.
   ``He doesn't like the L-word anymore because he's trying to move
to the middle ... and we're not going to let him,'' said Bush.
   Although the Buckeye state went twice for Ronald Reagan and Bush
is ahead in polls in Ohio, Bush press secretary Sheila Tate said,
``It's not locked up by any means.''
   Tate was questioned about Friday's indictment of former
Philippines dictator Ferdinand Marcos, as Dukakis has criticized
Bush for praising Marcos' commitment to democracy during a 1981
visit to Manila.
   ``His view is that the judicial process should go forward,''
Tate said.
   In Troy, Bush recited his full anti-Dukakis litany, attacking
the Massachusetts governor for vetoing a mandatory Pledge of
Allegiance law, ridiculing his prison furlough program and taking a
double-edged swipe at the Democrat's economic and environmental
record.
   ``There just isn't any Massachusetts miracle. The last miracle
in Massachusetts was when they found a fish alive in Boston
Harbor,'' Bush quipped.
   At the University of Toledo, Bush decried the ``terrible
scourge'' of chemical warfare and called Friday for sanctions
against nations that resort to germ warfare, on-site inspection of
suspicious plants and an overture to the Soviet Union and China to
help stop the spread of ballistic missiles.
   Bush has long said one of his goals as president would be to
banish all chemical weapons from the earth _ an issue given new
urgency by the use of nerve gas in the Iran-Iraq war. He spoke of
his horror at seeing photographs of a Kurdish mother ``trying to
protect her child, waving her arms against the invisible winds of
death'' after an Iraqi attack.
   The Dukakis campaign has challenged Bush's credibility on this
issue, citing three tie-breaking votes the vice president cast in
the U.S. Senate in 1983 and 1986 to fund U.S. production of new
chemical weapons.
   Dennis Ross, a Bush policy aide, said the old U.S. stockpiles
were deteriorating and the new, binary weapons were safer.
   Bush's octogenarian mother, Dorothy, criticized her son after
the second chemical weapons vote in 1983 _ and got a phone call
from Reagan explaining why her George voted that way.

   Indicted former Philippine President Ferdinand
E. Marcos received no promises from U.S. officials to persuade him
to leave his country without bloodshed during a popular,
military-based revolt in 1986, officials say.
   More than 2{ years after he fled the Philippines, Marcos, his
wife, Imelda, and six others were indicted Friday on racketeering
charges involving a vast fortune the Marcoses allegedly stole from
the Philippines.
   Action by the White House, a federal appeals court and the
Philippine government opened the final doors to that indictment
which came in a New York investigation that began shortly after
Marcos was airlifted to Hawaii in February 1986.
   Robert G. Rich, a former U.S. Embassy official in Manila who was
State Department liaison with Marcos during his first three months
of Hawaiian exile, said Friday that no high official, including
President Reagan, made any promises to Marcos.
   ``We offered refuge because the prospect of violence threatened
him and his family and to avoid a very bloody confrontation in the
Philippines,'' Rich said in a telephone interview from Belize,
where he is now the U.S. ambassador. ``There is no indication that
anyone at high levels offered anything inappropriate.''
   Marcos claims in a lawsuit filed in Honoluu that he was deceived
into leaving his country against his will.
   The case against Marcos has involved discussions with
Philippines officials and months of dealings among the White House,
Justice Department and State Department. Both State and Justice
department sources confirmed that there were disagreements over how
to handle the case, with Justice wanting to indict prior to plea
bargaining with Marcos and State urging a pre-indictment attempt to
bargain.
   A plea bargain which Marcos rejected was described by one
official as an attempt to get Marcos to return his vast wealth to
the Philippines, which is the main objective of the case. The
government of President Corazon Aquino alleges that Marcos and his
associates took out of the country $5 billion to $10 billion, much
of it stashed in Swiss banks.
   The way was cleared for the indictment after a White House
announcement Thursday that Reagan would ``not prevent the law from
taking its course.'' White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater later
said Reagan was saddened by the court action because Marcos was a
friend.
   Reagan had invited Marcos to the United States, and
administration officials were concerned about the impact the
indictment would have on U.S. credibility in dealing with foreign
rulers in the future.
   Fitzwater said after the indictment, ``We didn't make any
promises we couldn't keep. Any foreign leader can take our word on
anything.''
   Another administration official, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said Marcos apparently came to the United States because
it was where he ``felt safest and most comfortable. If he went to
another place, he might end up ripped off by another authoritarian
ruler.''
   But Rich said he believes that Marcos in 1986 probably planned
to stay in the United States only for a few months, miscalculating
the viability of the Aquino government and the lack of interest
other countries had in taking him.
   He and his wife are restricted to the island of Oahu because of
his attempt last year to return to the Philippines. U.S. officials
say they are honoring a Philippine government request that he not
be allowed to return.
   On Wednesday, the U.S. Court of Appeals in New York upheld a
civil contempt finding against Marcos and his wife for failing to
turn over evidence to the grand jury that handed up the
indictments. That decision also rejected Marcos' pleas for immunity.
   Last week, the Philippine government issued a formal waiver of
any immunity Marcos might be allowed from prosecution as a former
head of state.

<HEAD>Congress Passes Bill Reforming Distribution of Disaster Relief</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JEFF BARKER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A bill reforming the way the Federal Emergency
Management Agency distributes aid after natural disasters has been
approved by Congress and sent to President Reagan for his signature.
   The Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Amendments of 1988
had their roots in the government's response to tornadoes that
raced through Pennsylvania, Ohio and New York before hitting Canada
on May 31, 1985, killing 90 people.
   Rep. Thomas Ridge, R-Pa., authored the bill after complaining
that the help offered by FEMA in 1985 failed to meet the needs of
residents and municipalities facing major repairs.
   At a hearing on the bill last year, Rep. Leon Panetta, D-Calif.,
said reform was necessary because FEMA ``has gained the notoriety
of being very cumbersome and tortuous for the citizens of this
nation to understand.''
   The bill died in the 99th Congress, was introduced again last
year, and the House finally passed it in the spring.
   The Senate passed a companion bill by voice vote Friday. Since
the measure was slightly different from the version the House had
passed earlier, it was sent back to the House, which approved it
Friday night.
   The legislation was sent to Reagan, who was expected to sign it.
   Among other reforms, the bill would bar FEMA from paying less
than a 75 percent share of aid to local governments qualifying for
public repair projects following a disaster. It would add
guidelines to speed the distribution of post-disaster aid and would
permit federal funds to be used for the first time for local
projects designed to lessen the effect of disasters before they
strike.
   The measure also would make temporary housing assistance through
FEMA available for up to 18 months, six months longer than under
the current system.
   Originally, the measure was opposed by the Reagan
administration, which said its initial price tag _ $15 to $20
million per year above what FEMA pays now _ was too high.
   But the bill's cost was trimmed down to zero by eliminating some
administrative expenses and by asking state and local governments
to share some of the cost of aid in a federally declared emergency,
among other changes.

<HEAD>Quotes From the Presidential Campaign Trail</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Here are some comments from the presidential
campaign trail Friday:
   
   MICHAEL DUKAKIS, slamming the Bush camp for emphasizing the fact
that convicted murder Willie Horton escaped while on furlough and
terrorized a Maryland couple: ``To play politics with that kind of
human tragedy, I think, is one of the most cynical things you can
do.''
   
   Sen. SAM NUNN, D-Ga., speculating on what he would do if he were
in Dukakis' shoes: ``I wouldn't have been a punching bag on some of
these issues. There are some very unfair allegations going on, and
what I've been amazed at is how the Bush campaign has been able to
get away with it and to be fairly successful at it so far. Dukakis
has really got to take off the gloves; he's got to defend himself.''
   
   GEORGE BUSH, advocating an international ban on chemical weapons
but failing to mention his tie-breaking votes in 1983 and 1986 in
favor of U.S. chemical weapons arsenals: ``The eventual combination
of chemical weapons and ballistic missiles could put new
destructive power in the hands of governments with terrorist
records.''
   
   DAN QUAYLE, saying the Democrats will not stage a Harry
Truman-style comeback this year, copying a line used against him in
the vice presidential debate: ``I don't know Michael Dukakis, I
never served with Michael Dukakis, Michael Dukakis is not a good
friend of mine. ``But I know this: Michael Dukakis is no Harry
Truman.''
   
   RONALD REAGAN, praising Bush for keeping a cool head in times of
crisis: `` ... I have given him some of the most sensitive and
difficult tasks that we've had, and he's never let me or the
country down.''
   
   LLOYD BENTSEN, seeking to assuage Texans' fears that Dukakis is
soft on defense: ``I wouldn't be running on a ticket with a
candidate who would weaken America's defense.''

   The Soviet Union has offered to start moving
an icebreaking ship today toward the stranded whales in Alaska if
current rescue efforts don't succeed, according to a teleprinter
message sent from Soviet officials to Greenpeace.
   ``We are taking efforts on assisting in whales rescue
operations,'' said the message sent Friday by the Soviet State
Committee on Hydrometeorology.
   The ship, the Admiral Makarov, was 300 miles north of Point
Barrow and would be able to move toward the whales today after
finishing work on establishing a research station on the ice and
rescuing an ice-trapped Soviet ship, the Arseniev, the message said.
   The offer was made in the event the three gray whales still are
trapped by the gathering ice next Wednesday, when the Soviets
anticipated the icebreaking ship could arrive at the scene.
   Campbell Plowder of Greenpeace said that as a shot in the dark,
he asked on Monday, through scientific contacts in the Soviet
Union, if any Soviet icebreaker was in a position to help the
whales. The answer was Friday's cable.
   The Soviet message, which requests Greenpeace's help in
obtaining U.S. government permission to sail in U.S. territorial
waters, expresses some doubts about the success of the mission.
   ``We do not have complete assurance in this venture because of
shallow waters for icebreaker in the area of rescue,'' the message
said. In addition, the Soviets said, the ``ice ridge is about 120
miles from that area and we are in doubts ... that whales would be
able to pass through the channel made by icebreaker.''
   Plowder said he has asked the State Department for immediate
clearance for the ship to enter U.S. waters and was told the
department would ``assess the technical aspects'' first.
   The State Department, meanwhile, said it has asked Soviet
authorities what assets they may have available to help free the
whales.
   The Soviets responded with information on where they have ice
breakers and how long it would take them to arrive at the scene,
said a State Department official who asked not to be identified.
   According to the official, U.S. authorities are evaluating the
Soviet information and are comparing it with other options for
rescuing the whales.

   Michael Dukakis is on the air with four
new hard-hitting commercials and tonight is delivering a
five-minute televised appeal for support.
   The Massachusetts governor got a rousing reception Friday night
from several thousand people who filled the gymnasium on the campus
of the University of New Orleans.
   ``At the rate we're going, we're going to be importing 50
percent of our oil by 1990,'' he said.
   ``Even before we're inaugurated, Lloyd Bentsen and I are going
to call a bipartisan energy summit for this country ... and that
summit will be chaired by the vice president-elect of the United
States.''
   The commercials and television speech are the latest effort by
the Democratic presidential candidate to pick up momentum in his
race against Republican George Bush.
   ``The central point (of the new ads) is the Bush campaign and
their advertising are not to be believed,'' said campaign press
secretary Dayton Duncan.
   The new Dukakis ads started running Friday in key states.
   Television was the latest weapon in the Dukakis effort to
overtake Bush and emerge as an upset winner on Election Day, a
little more than two weeks away.
   His five-minute speech will air at 10:55 p.m. EDT, on ABC. Aides
said the Democratic candidate also would appear Tuesday night on
the ABC show ``Nightline.''
   Dukakis campaigned Friday in New York, Pennsylvania, and
Louisiana before flying to Texas for the night.
   At Bethel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Harlem, Dukakis
renewed his pledge to wage a war on drugs and said, ``Our
determination to win this war should know no bounds.''
   His next stop was McKeesport, Pa., where he told a crowd that
waited in the rain, ``Don't let anyone tell you the steel industry
is dead in this country. It isn't, it's not going to be and we are
going to help bring it back.''
   Actor Albert Brooks, who starred in the movie ``Broadcast
News,'' was on the platform with Dukakis and told the crowd, ``I'm
a liberal and I'm a great guy.'' Then turning to Dukakis, he said,
``This guy's a liberal, he's a great guy.''
   Two of the new Dukakis television ads were responses to Bush
attacks on the Massachusetts prison furlough program and on
Dukakis' positions on defense issues.
   ``Bush won't talk about the thousands of drug kingpins
furloughed from federal prisons while he led the war on drugs,''
says one Dukakis ad. ``The real story about furloughs is that
George Bush has taken a furlough from the truth.''
   The Bush campaign is running a television ad that shows Dukakis
riding in a tank and describes him as opposed to a range of major
weapons systems.
   The Dukakis response shows the Democratic nominee watching the
opening moment of that ad and then turning it off.
   ``I'm fed up with it,'' says Dukakis. ``Haven't seen anything
like it in 25 years of public life, George Bush's negative TV ads.''
   The other two ads attack Bush for failing to stop the flow of
drugs into the country and for planning to cut the capital gains
tax, what Dukakis describes as ``tax breaks to the rich.''

   EL-ALAMEIN, Egypt (AP) _ This dusty coastal village of Bedouin
houses, car repair shops, a rest house and two gas stations has
little to offer for the living _ except memories of the dead.
   On Sunday, 2,000 people are expected here to mourn those who
fell in World War II in the Battle of el-Alamein.
   Since 1978, the Service of Remembrance for the more than 70,000
casualties of the battle has been held on the Sunday nearest to
Oct. 23. That was the night 46 years ago when English Gen. Bernard
Law Montgomery launched a devastating attack on the elite Axis
divisions of ``The Desert Fox,'' German Field Marshal Erwin Rommel.
   The decisive battle began at 9:40 p.m. when Montgomery's guns
opened fire under a full moon after a day of blistering heat.
   Rain had turned the desert to mud by the time the battle was won
early Nov. 4, ending Rommel's relentless march across North Africa
toward Suez. It cleared the way for the Allies to open a second
front in Europe.
   This year's main ceremony will be held beneath the pink and
green foliage of the Commonwealth Cemetery, an English garden
setting against a desert backdrop.
   Among those who will take part is Britain's defense secretary,
George Younger, who arrived with a delegation of 41, including
about a dozen war widows and 17 veterans.
   The cemetery, with its rows of marked and unmarked graves, is an
emotional reminder of the battle wedged in the 30 miles of
wasteland between the quicksand-filled Qattarra Depression to the
south and the Mediterranean Sea to the north.
   The largest war cemetery in North Africa, it contains the graves
of Commonwealth soldiers who died at el-Alamein as well as some who
fell earlier in the Sahara.
   English architect Sir Hubert Worthington came to el-Alamein in
the summer of 1943, just months after Rommel was repelled, to
design a garden cemetery in the harsh surroundings.
   He determined that walls were necessary to keep out drifting
sand, and cloisters with hearty plants to make visits pleasant even
in the hottest months.
   Of the 7,352 graves, 815 bear unknown remains.
   Jew and Arab lie side by side. English soldiers and Canadians
are buried beside Australians, Indians, East Africans, West
Africans, Sudanese, Belgians, Frenchmen, Greeks, Poles, troopers
from the old High Commission Territories and unknown Allied dead
from other North African campaigns.
   On the walls in front of the cemetery are listed names of 11,495
others lost in all desert campaigns.
   East of the Commonwealth Cemetery is a separate smaller memorial
to Greek combatants, and monuments to Axis losses are to the west.
   Italy's mausoleum, dazzling white against the azure sea, holds
the remains of 3,241 soldiers.
   A short distance away, the dark, round, fortress-like German
memorial dominates a sandy hill beside the shore. Its walls shelter
4,280 remains.
   In its center courtyard, a tablet reads: ``The price of pride is
high, and paid by the young.''
   There has been occasional talk of halting the annual
commemoration, but Wing Cmdr. Anthony Edmunds, who heads this
year's program, said that is not being seriously considered.
   ``For the younger generations, World War II is becoming part of
a deep, dark past, but for others this time of year recalls
el-Alamein,'' he said. ``Egypt still has large Italian and Greek
communities who gather for the ceremony.''
   Edmunds remembers studying about el-Alamein in detail as a child
because ``it was such a turning point for the Allies. We were doing
OK in Europe, awful in the Far East and hadn't done well in Africa.
After el-Alamein, all that changed.''
   The Sahara's constantly shifting sands have made it impossible
to know the exact numbers of el-Alamein's dead.
   Untold thousands of men are hidden. From time to time the
featureless landscape, too dry even for shrubs, releases a stilled
skeleton or exposes a mine.
   Estimates of casualties _ dead, wounded, captured and missing _
total 72,500: the Axis suffered 59,000 and the Commonwealth
sustained 13,500.
   El-Alamein tells the story of its 12 days in world history in a
small museum.
   The visitor passes large Nazi and Commonwealth flags on the way
to display cases of weaponry, uniforms, battle plans and related
documents.
   Department-store dummies are decked out as the meticulous and
calculating Montgomery and lean Rommel.
   Outside is a row of tanks, gathering dust, including the
Italians' M-13 that Montgomery's tankmen called the
``self-propelled coffin.''

   Shiite Moslem kidnappers on Friday
threatened to harm two American hostages to retaliate for Israeli
air attacks on Palestinian and pro-Iranian guerrilla bases in
Lebanon.
   ``Committing this stupidity and this attack shall not pass
without a punishment,'' said a typewritten statement in Arabic
signed by Islamic Jihad, the pro-Iranian faction holding American
journalist Terry A. Anderson and educator Thomas Sutherland.
   The typewritten Arabic statement was delivered to the
independent Beirut newspaper An-Nahar hours after the attack. An
authenticating color picture of Anderson was delivered to the
Reuters news agency with a copy of the statement, but it was the
same photograph the group released of Anderson in April.
   The statement praised the Shiite Moslem suicide car bomber who
killed seven Israeli soldiers and wounded eight soldiers and two
Lebanese women in Israel's self-declared security zone in south
Lebanon on Wednesday. That attack prompted Israel's retaliatory air
strike, which killed 15 people and wounded 35 in south Lebanon on
Friday.
   The instant photo showed Anderson, 40, chief Middle East
correspondent for The Associated Press, wearing a Commodore Hotel
T-shirt and a bushy beard and mustache. He looked straight into the
camera without his glasses.
   It was the 11th picture released of Lebanon's longest-held
foreign captive, abducted in Moslem west Beirut March 16, 1985.
   It was the same photograph released of Anderson on April 10,
when Islamic Jihad threatened to harm the hostages if a Kuwaiti
jetliner hijacked to Larnaca, Cyprus was stormed to free the
passengers.
   The 29-line statement began with several verses from the Koran,
Islam's holy book, and deplored Israel's air attack as a
``challenge to the will of our oppressed people.''
   It accused the U.S. administration of giving Israel advance
approval to attack Palestinian and Hezbollah guerrillas in Lebanon.
The pro-Iranian Hezbollah, or Party of God, had claimed
responsibility for the suicide bombing.
   ``The criminal America must realize it will not get away with
what it has done, especially in connection with the hostages we
hold, so that will be a lesson to whoever strikes at the dignity
and glory of our people and mujahedeen (holy fighters),'' it said.
   Sheik Fadlallah, considered to be Hezbollah's spiritual leader,
said he would do his best to protect the hostages.
   ``We continue to respect our previous commitments to defend
human rights in order to see these hostages free and safe as soon
as possible,'' he said. ``We will do our utmost to see that nothing
happens to any of them.''
   He spoke in Beirut with Ray Barnett, a Canadian representative
of Ambassadors of Aid, a group that helps orphans in Third World
countries.
   In Cadiz, Ky., Anderson's sister, Peggy Say, issued a statement
asking his captors to ``recognize that Terry Anderson is totally
innocent and has never been involved in the continuing Middle East
strife except as a captive for 3{ years.''
   ``It is totally unjust to hold him responsible for the military
actions of another country,'' Mrs. Say said.
   Friday's statement was the first since Aug. 18, when the group
said none of its hostages would be released soon.
   Sutherland, 56, of Fort Collins, Colo., was acting dean of
agriculture at the American University of Beirut when he was
abducted June 9, 1985.
   Anderson and Sutherland are among nine Americans believed held
by pro-Iranian extremist factions linked to Hezbollah. Others held
are three Britons, an Irishman and an Italian.
   In Washington, State Department spokesman Charles Redman called
for an end to violence between Israel and Lebanon and urged the
kidnappers to free their hostages.
   Asked about the Islamic Jihad warning, he said: ``These are
innocent victims. They are being held through no fault of their
own.... And the appeal to the hostage-holders has to be always,
`Release these innocent people.'''
   In a separate development Friday, the weekly Beirut magazine
Ash-Shiraa said the United States and Iran were working out a new
deal to free the American hostages before the U.S. presidential
election on Nov. 8.
   Ash-Shiraa said the deal would ensure the victory of Vice
President George Bush in exchange for a commitment from the
Republican candidate to rearm Iran.
   There was no way to verify the report. The United States has
stressed that it has no contacts with Iran.
   Ash-Shiraa, which has access to Iranian hardliners, gained
international fame in Nov. 1986 when it broke the story of the U.S.
secret arms sales to Iran. But most of its subsequent reports about
the hostages have been inaccurate.
   Other reports have said both Bush and Democratic candidate
Michael Dukakis sent envoys to work out a deal with the Iranians on
the hostages. Both candidates denied the reports.

<HEAD>Lagerfeld Shows Longer Skirts, Merry Widow Waistlines</HEAD>

   Merry widow corset effects gave definition to Karl
Lagerfeld's summer ready-to-wear collection. But even with these
ribbed waistlines, his show was full of softness, a new note on the
fashion scene.
   The new, easy clothes were appealing, but lacked the firm
dynamics that the fashion world has come to expect of Lagerfeld.
Most of the clothes shown Friday were nice without being
sensational.
   A lot of pants, very straight and not too wide, looked excellent
in off-white topped by deep rose or dusty green blazers.
   Seen on soft green jersey dresses, the merry widow touch of
ribbed seams was a detail that never cinched the waist in.
   Another option was pinstriped trouser suits, and high hats gave
them trouser suits a raffish, 19th century charm.
   A few short skirts cropped up, notably in some white knit
``tennis'' style dresses with red or green stripes at hem and
turtle neck. But they were just a few inches above the knee.
   Lagerfeld announced long ago that longer skirts were coming in,
and he sees that they do, showing most skirts way below knee level.
   With a few pastels and plenty of black and white in linens,
knits and cottons, the effect was nearly subdued. For those who
love knits and don't want the ribbed corset effect, a lot of easy
pleated midcalf skirts were belted near the hip with wide and
handsome belts with gobby metal decor.
   Lagerfeld played around with jackets, making some hems in tulip
shapes, belting others, cutting out some fitted numbers with
rounded decolletes.
   Coat dresses at Lagerfeld were long and full, almost ending up
looking like housecoats in a wallpaper flower print. The navy wool
crepe full-skirted coat dress was topped by a big organdy bow _
also added to a simple but easily-cut trouser suit.
   Lagerfeld also came up with an excellent suite of tiered and
pleated ivory crepe de chine numbers with fullish leg o' mutton
sleeves and wide brown belts.
   The evening wear was sparse but did feature some fitted and
full-skirted dresses, some with chiffon halter necklines and
skirts, others with long, fitted torsoes in black lace and white
pique.
   Easy-to-wear was also the idea at Popy Moreni, an Italian-born
designer who has been showing in Paris for several years now.
   Her clothes were often based on gray _ in full shiny wool trench
coats, in wool and silk trouser suits and dresses with full skirts.
The overall effect was always girlish.
   To contrast with all the grey, lilac and yellow also came out in
wide knit culotte suits or paired with charcoal in draped tops.
   With details like jabots on pinstriped shirt-jackets, or full
skirts under fitted torsoes, the clothes were feminine and young.
For the sporty set, Moreni also showed a line of striped wide
Bermudas and shorts.
   The dressy touch here was also disarmingly girlish in a series
of long-skirted ivory silks and a big line of white cottons with
ruffles and tiers that looked like simplified versions of 18th
century frilliness.
   For garden parties or dressy barbecues, the pretty flowered
chiffon dresses or multicolored rainbow numbers had unsophisticated
charm.
   Like all of Paris, Bernard Perris showed plenty of pants, from
buttoned, tight toreador style to the widest pyjamas. His lines
were always soft, but jackets for long skirts and trousers were cut
with big wing lapels and swallow-tails. The color scheme was
subdued, with soft pearl gray and pastels in light wools, cotton
and silks.
   Even the boleros were waist-nipped, and while the emphasis was
on dressier clothes, Perris also brought out wide street shorts
with cuffs and spencer jackets.

   William J. Campbell, a U.S.
District judge who prosecuted gangster Al Capone and was the
longest-tenured federal judge in the United States, died Wednesday
of complications from surgery. He was 83.
   Campbell was one of the prosecutors who got the notorious
Chicago hoodlum convicted on tax-evasion charges. Capone died in
prison in 1947.
   Campbell, appointed to the federal bench in 1940 by President
Franklin D. Roosevelt, rose to become chief judge in Illinois'
northern district and twice declined a seat on the 7th U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals.
   He retired in 1970 but continued to hear federal cases in
Illinois, California and for the past nine years at the federal

<HEAD>Silence Is Golden For IRA, Thatcher Supporters Say</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MAUREEN JOHNSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   To critics, the British government has forsaken
democracy with its decision to end the right of suspects to remain
silent under police interrogation in Northern Ireland.
   But supporters, including distinguished judges, hailed the
announcement Thursday by Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's
government as a sensible, long overdue move that will mean fewer
terrorists go free.
   Either way, Mrs. Thatcher's government is prepared to dump the
British equivalent of the U.S. Constitution's Fifth Amendment. The
Fifth Amendment holds that no person ``shall be compelled in any
criminal case to be a witness against himself ... without due
process of law.''
   New laws, expected to be passed for Northern Ireland by January
and for England and Wales by 1990, will allow a judge or jury to
deduce, if they wish, that a suspect's refusal to answer police
questions after arrest is an indication of guilt.
   At present, courts are not allowed to take into consideration a
suspect's silence _ under laws dating from the 17th century and
designed to protect illiterate suspects from unfairly or wrongly
incriminating themselves.
   But government officials note times have changed.
   In Northern Ireland, where the law is aimed mainly at the Irish
Republican Army, police find guerrilla suspects well-trained in how
to sit it out: staring at a wall through days of interrogation,
sitting with their heads between their legs to avoid eye contact
with interrogators, or lying under a table.
   Elsewhere, In the United Kingdom, Mrs. Thatcher's officials
argue, regular criminals, particularly sophisticated racketeers and
drug dealers, are similarly expert.
   ``Is it really in the interests of justice that experienced
criminals should be able to refuse to answer all police questions
secure in the knowledge that a jury will never hear of it?'' said
Home Secretary Douglas Hurd.
   In Northern Ireland, Republican News, the newspaper of the
outlawed IRA's legal political front, Sinn Fein, advises arrested
guerrillas: ``Interrogation _ Whatever you say, say nothing. You
must make up your mind not to speak until you return home.''
   ``What I have to deal with is a sustained and deliberate attack
on the whole system of justice,'' said Northern Ireland Secretary
Tom King. He is Britain's top official in the province torn by
Roman Catholic-Protestant strife.
   Main targets are suspects who say nothing to police and then
come up with elaborate defenses, including detailed alibis, weeks
or months later in court.
   However, critics say no abuse of the right to silence can
warrant attacking the fundamentals of a free society.
   As recently as 1981, a government-appointed inquiry into
criminal procedures concluded the right to silence should be
preserved.
   Since 1973, Northern Ireland has had no-jury, one-judge courts
because of the difficulty of getting frightened juries to convict
or witnesses to testify at IRA trials.
   Both sides point to the fact that in Northern Ireland, less than
one-fourth of people arrested under anti-terrorism laws are charged.
   Police say this reflects the ability of the guilty to stay
silent: critics say it shows police make massive and unjustified
arrests under anti-terrorist laws _ and the end of the right to
silence hands police more power to abuse.
   Also last week, the government banned broadcast interviews with
the members of the IRA and 10 other militant groups in Northern
Ireland.
   To many, the measures smack of victory for the IRA: the Thatcher
government abandoning democratic principles throughout Britain as
it battles the IRA's campaign to end British rule in Northern
Ireland.
   ``To abolish the right to silence is to place a terrible risk
against those who are verbally inadequate, those who are afraid,
who are simply cautious,'' said Labor deputy leader Roy Hattersley.
   Lord Denning, who retired in 1982 as Britain's most senior
judge, retorted: ``The right to silence helps the guilty ... It is
only the guilty person who says, `I am not going to say anything.'''

   Lawrence W. Butler, who won five
Academy Awards for technical achievements including work on ``The
Thief of Bagdad,'' died of a heart attack when his pickup truck
crashed, officials said Friday. He was 80.
   Butler, who was head of the special-effects department at
Columbia Pictures in the 1940s, received his most recent honor from
the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences in 1975.
   His pictures included ``The Caine Mutiny,'' ``The Devil at 4
O'Clock'' and ``Marooned.''
   Butler's pickup truck ran off the road and smashed into rocks in
northern San Diego County on Wednesday, said Highway Patrol Officer
Sergio Flores.
   Butler, who was alone in the vehicle, had major head trauma and
was pronounced dead at the scene, Flores said.
   The coroner's office listed heart attack as the cause of death.
   The academy had bestowed awards on Butler since 1940, when he
was saluted for photographic merit on ``The Thief of Bagdad.''
   Subsequent technical honors were awarded for ``That Hamilton
Woman,'' 1941, ``Jungle Book,'' 1942, and ``A Thousand And One
Nights,'' 1945.
   All of the awards were certificates or plaques, as distinguished
from the Oscar statuettes presented in other categories.
   ``We were very good friends at work,'' said John Flynn, former
director of industry relations and publicity at Columbia. ``He was
one of the fine special-effects men in the business.''
   ``He was quite a famous director of special effects in the
movies,'' said George Turner, editor of American Cinematographer.

   A man was sentenced to life in prison without
parole Friday for his role in the murders of five people during a
supermarket robbery last year.
   Marvin Jennings, 27, of Overland, was sentenced to the maximum
penalty on each of 16 counts, including five terms of life without
parole.
   St. Louis Circuit Judge Thomas C. Mummert III, following a
jury's recommendation that Jennings be given life imprisonment
rather than the death penalty, ordered that the sentences be served
consecutively.
   At the sentencing, Jennings continued to assert his innocence.
   During the Sept. 4, 1987, robbery at a store here, seven workers
were ordered to lie on the floor and were shot execution-style. Two
survived.
   Jennings was convicted Sept. 10 of armed robbery and multiple
counts of murder, assault and armed criminal action.
   The other suspect in the crime, Donnie Blankenship, 26, of
Hanley Hills, is to be tried early next year on identical charges.

   California gray whales such as the three
trapped by Arctic ice off Alaska's northern coast have one of the
longest migration routes of all mammals and are among the last of
their species.
   The trapped whales didn't leave in time on the annual migration
from the Arctic Ocean to the warm water off Baja California, a
journey of 6,000 to 8,000 miles.
   California gray whales must leave the Arctic before winter
because they are not adapted for icy conditions and have relatively
thin blubber for insulation, said Mark Palmer, executive director
of the Whale Center in Oakland.
   He said the whales also cannot break through ice and cannot dive
underneath ice for any great distance.
   The whales can only spend an average of three to six minutes
underwater at a time during their migration, he said.
   There used to be three distinct populations of gray whales,
including the California group, another group in the North Atlantic
and one on the Asian coast, said Steve Bailey, a marine biologist
with the California Academy of Sciences in San Francisco.
   However, the North Atlantic group became extinct hundreds of
years ago and the Asian group is almost extinct, said Bailey. The
California gray whales number about 20,000.
   The California gray whale averages about 35 feet in length and
weighs about 30 tons, marine biologists said.
   The gray whales, which may actually be black or dark gray, feed
on small animals that live on the ocean floor.

<HEAD>House Action Blocked on Sanctions Against Iraq</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   House action on sanctions to punish Iraq for
its alleged use of poison gas against the Kurdish minority was
blocked early Saturday, and the Senate Foreign Relations chairman
blamed manuevering by House members beholden to ``special
interests.''
   Committee Chairman Claiborne Pell, D-R.I., told the Senate it
was ``almost a tragedy'' to allow a handful of House members to
bottle up the sanctions bill in the last hours of the 100th
Congress.
   ``The will of the majority, the will of the Congress has been
repudiated,'' he said.
   The Senate had initially passed a strong set of sanctions
against Iraq in the wake of reports that the Iraqi army had
subjected Kurdish villages to gas attacks. It later went along with
a watered-down compromise version originating in the House.
   But that compromise died when it was stripped from a pending tax
bill.
   ``Unfortunately, special interests got into the act,'' Pell told
the Senate.
   He said opposition to sanctions against Iraq had developed in
the American agriculture, oil and chemical industries.
   ``The net effect has been to kill the Iraq sanctions for this
Congress,'' said Pell, who vowed to revisit the issue early in the
101st Congress next year.
   He said that for now he is concerned that Iraq will get ``the
wrong message'' and that the Kurds may be placed in further peril.

   A man's wedding night turned into the
jailhouse blues when a deputy who performed the marriage returned
to arrest him.
   Anita Clough, bride-to-be of Ronald Jackson, recruited Sheriff's
Deputy Robert Cook, who's also a notary public, to conduct
Thursday's ceremony.
   ``I thought it would be a really nice idea,'' Cook said. ``This
would be a nice change of pace, I told myself, and I'd be helping
these two kids out.''
   At Jackson's home, Cook said he thought Jackson looked familiar.
Jackson, 18, explained that the deputy had ticketed him in the
past. Cook put that out of his mind and performed his first wedding.
   But Jackson's explanation stuck in the back of his mind, Cook
said.
   ``I ran a computer check on Jackson, and I couldn't believe it
when it came back,'' the deputy said. ``He had three outstanding
warrants pending, for what else _ failing to show up in court on
the tickets I wrote him.''
   Cook turned his patrol car around and arrested Jackson.
   ``I almost wished I had any other job in the world but the one I
had,'' the officer said.
   After spending his wedding night in jail, Jackson was released
on bond Friday.

   Doug Winton, an adjunct professor at
Rochester Institute of Technology's College of Continuing
Education, teaches basic physics to adult, part-time students who
couldn't care less about the subject.
   ``They're mostly business majors. This is their required science
credit. So I try to add a little pizazz,'' he said.
   The pizzaz works. Total strangers have turned up in class just
to gawk at the magic tricks Winton employs to make physics exciting.
   His first trick is a variation of the old
whisk-the-tablecloth-off-a-set-table trick. He stacks up four
glasses of water, a cookie sheet, four cardboard tubes and four
jumbo eggs.
   ``The secret is jumbo eggs. They're heavier, so they have more
inertia,'' Winton says.
   When the cookie sheet is knocked away, the eggs drop into the
glasses because, as Winton's students know, bodies at rest want to
stay at rest and bodies in motion want to stay in motion.
   He demonstrates the importance of velocity by driving a large
nail into a piece of plywood with his hand wrapped in a towel. His
grand finale is lying on a bed of nails and having a trained
volunteer smash cinder blocks with a sledgehammer, first on his
abdomen, then on his forehead.
   The laws of physics offer protection, but no guarantees. Raw
knuckles, a bruised hand, a scraped scalp and a mild concussion
sometimes are part of the act.
   ``I've had students who couldn't bear to look,'' Winton said.

<TEXT>
   Clashes this month between the army and
guerrillas left 56 soldiers and 30 rebels dead, state-run Radio
Rangoon reported.
   The broadcast Friday said the highest death toll _ 21 soldiers
and 18 rebels _ was in the Shan States, one of many areas of the
country plagued by an insurgency by ethnic groups demanding greater
regional autonomy.
   The 83 clashes with ``various rebel groups'' Oct. 1-21 left 110
government troops wounded and six others missing, the radio said.
   A government spokesman earlier said that from Sept. 26 to
Monday, 35 government soldiers were killed and 95 wounded in those
battles, which are continuing. He said rebel casualities were
believed to be heavy.
   Friday's announcement mentioned only two troops and three rebels
killed in Karen State.
   The guerrilla groups have been fighting the government for the
past four decades.
   The government also has acknowledged that besides the
insurgents, its troops killed more than 450 people since Gen. Saw
Maung seized power in a coup Sept. 18. Western diplomats say the
victims included large numbers of people peacefully demanding
democracy, but the government says most were looters and other
``destructive elements.''
   While banning pro-democracy demonstrations, Saw Maung's
administration has allowed formation of opposition parties and
promised a general election sometime next year.
   The radio said four more parties registered Friday, bringing the
number of officially recognized parties to 32.
   The four new parties included two parties of the Chin minority
group _ the Zomi National Congress and the Chin National League for
Democracy. Four other minority-based parties registered earlier.
   The broadcast added that announcements will be made later on the
registration of a dozen more parties.

   The State Department is welcoming the decision

   The Farm Credit System Assistance Board has
announced the Farm Credit Bank of St. Paul, Minn., will get up to
$133 million in federal aid.
   Eric P. Thor, the board's chief executive officer, on Friday
credited a new management team at the St. Paul bank, the system's
largest, with making the institution successful in getting such aid.
   ``They have designed a financial recovery plan that the
assistance board believes will strengthen their level of capital
and assist the district's financially stressed PCAs,'' said Thor.
   The Production Credit Associations are the grassroots units that
make loans to farmers so they can meet production schedules.
   The St. Paul bank has assets worth nearly $7.7 billion and
91,000 borrowers in Michigan, Minnesota, North Dakota and Wisconsin
.
   Under 1987 law, Farm Credit System institutions with impaired
capital _ the book value of borrower stock being less than par
value _ may apply to the board to be certified for federal aid.

<TEXT>
   A helicopter went to the rescue of three
trapped whales Friday, bashing through foot-thick arctic ice with a
five-ton concrete ``bullet'' after frustrated workers began hacking
an escape route with chain saws.
   The whales followed the escape route all the way to the 24th
breathing hole cut by the workers by Friday night, bringing them a
half mile closer to open water now four miles away, said National
Guard Col. Tom Carroll.
   The Skycrane heavy-lift helicopter loaned by the Alaska Army
National Guard arrived earlier Friday from Prudhoe Bay with a
steel-tipped concrete cylinder, a remnant from construction of the
trans-Alaska oil pipeline.
   It finally began punching holes through the ice about 4 p.m. (8
p.m.) EDT, but stopped after about an hour and a half as darkness
fell.
   The helicopter is also creating a series of breathing holes that
rescuers hope the whales will follow to open water some four miles
away.
   ``They hover the helicopter 20 feet over the ice, and drop the
`bullet','' Palmer said. ``It drops through the ice on the second
or third try. Then they pull it back out.
   ``Some of the ice comes with it. They try to pull out as much as
possible. The holes _ and I've heard they punched through three or
four averaging 15 to 20 minutes per hole _ are about 20 by 30 feet.
They're approximately 100 feet apart,'' he said.
   Palmer said the helicopter started its ice-bashing near a lead
about four miles from the whales.
   ``We're trying not to scare the whales until the last possible
moment,'' he said. ``At last count, they figured it would take 24
to 26 hours if they work continuously. But they have to stop for
darkness.''
   The young California gray whales were imprisoned in shallow
water about 100 yards from shore by thickening, shifting ice about
two weeks ago. They have been breathing through small holes in the
ice about 13 miles northwest of this tiny village on Alaska's
desolate northern coast.
   More than a dozen volunteers decided Friday not to wait for the
helicopter and began carving long narrow holes in the ice
themselves.
   ``We're just getting tired of waiting for things to show up,''
said North Slope Borough biologist Geoff Carroll. ``We're getting
away from the heavy equipment approach.''
   Mark Fraker, a whale biologist with Standard Alaska Production
Co., said rescuers finally were making some progress. ``Up until
now, we've just been keeping them alive by keeping their breathing
holes open.''
   Easterly wind opened leads, or open water, through the ice to
within four miles of the whales Friday, giving an added urgency to
the effort to free the animals before a shift in the wind could
pinch off the escape routes.
   Biologists already were using tarps and aerators to get the
trapped animals away from their breathing holes and condition them
to the notion of moving from one hole in the ice to another.
   Hope faded Friday that a ``hover-barge'' could be used to break
ice to rescue the giant mammals.
   Originally, the National Guard planned to use another Skycrane
to tow a 185-ton icebreaking barge, floating on a cushion of air
generated by huge on-board fans, from Prudhoe Bay to Barrow, a
distance of 230 miles. But that bogged down in coastal mud, shallow
water, thin ice and sandbars.
   Two days of pulling had netted six miles. Helicopter crews set
out Friday to try one last time to pull the barge.
   The environmental group Greenpeace on Friday said the Soviet
Union has offered to break a path to the stranded whales with an
icebreaking ship next week if current rescue efforts don't succeed.
The ship is 300 miles north of Point Barrow.
   Biologists had been getting impatient with the barge effort and
pushed for the alternate plan, using the giant concrete punch.
   A second concrete cylinder was to be hauled to Barrow later if
there was no further progress with the barge.
   With luck, the animals will follow a series of punched-out holes
to open water, if broken ice can be removed from the new holes.
   ``The theory is to cut other holes very close, but not
touching,'' said Ted Meyers, National Marine Fisheries Service
habitat conservation chief for Alaska. ``You cut a new hole close
enough so the whales can see it, sense it and go for it. Once they
have done that, and are using the new hole, then you start another
process of discouraging use of the older hole.
   ``There are different ways. One would be to cover the hole, and
then even the sounds of chainsaws cutting new holes could get the
animals to associate that with new holes. Once you've got them
moving, and this has not been decided in this case, then you could
move the holes farther apart.''
   Carroll said the whales at least once have been coaxed to a new
hole.
   Skycrane pilot Chief Warrant Officer Gary Quarles experimented
with one of the concrete cylinders earlier this week. He said the
helicopter would suspend the cylinder about five feet above the ice
and quickly descend to drop it through.
   ``It has to be very controlled, or it would be very dangerous,''
he said.
   ``What we're going to attempt to do initially is make fairly
large holes close together in the hope the whales will go from hole
to hole,'' he said. ``We plan on putting holes maybe 20 feet apart.
My plan is to start fairly far away from them and let them get used
to the sound rather than starting close and scaring them. We'll do
it gradually.''

   Caterpillar Inc. and the United Auto
Workers announced a tentative agreement Friday on a new labor
contract for 17,500 workers in five states.
   Bargainers had been working against an 11 p.m. Friday strike
deadline on an agreement for union workers at Caterpillar plants in
the Illinois cities of Decatur, Peoria and Aurora, the only union
locals that had not previously reached a tenatative settlement.
   Details of the agreements were not immediately released.
   Earlier Friday, UAW Local 2096 of Pontiac, Ill., with 648
members, announced it had reached a tentative agreement.
   Pontiac was the fourth UAW local to reach a tentative agreement
with the Peoria, Ill.-based Caterpillar, the world's largest maker
of earthmoving equipment. Contract talks started Aug. 4.
   Union officials had said those locals without a tentative
agreement by the 11 p.m. deadline would be authorized to call a
strike.
   Minutes before the strike deadline, the Aurora local reached a
tentative agreement, said UAW negotiator Elliott Anderson. The
Peoria local followed suit about an hour later.
   Union sources earlier said a special job classifications was the
main snag in talks with the Illinois UAW locals in Decatur, Peoria
and Aurora.
   Those three locals represent 14,400 of Catepillar's 17,500 UAW
workers.
   After months of bargaining and two contract extensions, both
sides announced Thursday that a tentative agreement had been
reached on nearly every key issues, including pay raises and
improved health and pension benefits.
   The locals had objected to the creation of a special job
classifications for highly technical jobs because they said it
threatened the union's traditional seniority system.
   Workers trained to fill these high-tech positions could not be
bumped from their jobs by untrained workers with more seniority who
faced layoff.
   Company officials maintained, however, that management could not
afford to invest in new automated machinery and specialized job
training unless it could depend on having those workers remain on
the job.
   UAW locals in Denver; York, Pa.; and Memphis, Tenn., earlier
reached tentative agreements and the Davenport, Iowa, plant is
being closed.

<TEXT>
   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ Lt. Gen. Prosper Avril, making a
long-awaited address to this troubled nation, promised that his
military government would lay the foundation for democratic reforms
but offered no new policies.
   Army officials, meanwhile, acknowledged for the first time
Friday that a military coup against Avril's fledgling regime had
been thwarted.
   Avril's speech, broadcast to the nation on state television and
radio, was the subject of widespread anticipation because it was
the first by the new leader since he assumed power in a military
coup one month ago.
   But the speech lasted only 10 minutes and offered no new policy
objectives.
   Avril emphasized that local elections should be held before the
country could consider electing a new president.
   He said Friday that he would propose that ``an independent
electoral council be established in the next few days to prepare
for county, municipal and legislative elections ... to open the way
for presidential elections in a serene atmosphere.''
   Avril listed his government's objectives as creating jobs,
fighting corruption, promoting investment and bringing an end to
violence.
   ``The national interest demands that an end be put to the
violence and agitation which threaten national stability,'' he said.
   Observers said they saw nothing new in Avril's remarks.
   The new leader, who replaced ousted leader Lt. Gen. Henri Namphy
in the Sept. 17 coup engineered by rank-and-file soldiers, did not
mention a reported coup attempt against his government during the
weekend that led to the arrest of 12 soldiers.
   However, Defense and Interior Minister Col. Carl Dorsindil
acknowledge the coup attempt Friday evening.
   ``An attempted coup d' etat led by Sgt. Patrick Beauchard in
collaboration with former Lt. Col. Samuel Jeremie was foiled,'' the
communique read. ``The attempt was unmasked in time and certain of
their accomplices were arrested.''
   Earlier Friday, about 2,000 demonstrators marched from the
charred ruins of a slum church to protest a church order to expel
an activist priest and called on the government to implement army
reforms.
   The protesters, now in their second week of demonstrations, have
been angered by the decision of the Roman Catholic Church's
Salesian Order to force the Rev. Jean Bertrand Aristide, Haiti's
most popular priest, to leave the country.
   The demonstrators waved banners hailing Aristide as a
``prophet'' and asked Avril to implement promised reforms,
including bringing to justice any remaining Tonton Macoutes, the
hated secret police that served the Duvalier regime for 29 years.
   A massacre at Aristide's St. Jean Bosco church on Sept. 11 was
cited by the rank-and-file soldiers as a reason for overthrowing
Namphy. Thugs stormed the church during Mass, killed 12 people,
wounded more than 70 others and burned down the building.
   Aristide's Salesian Order superiors in Rome had ordered him to
leave Haiti by Oct. 17. Friends of the priest said Aristide was
still in Haiti on Friday and had not followed up on the transfer
order to the St. Claire parish in Montreal, Canada.
   Aristide advocates liberation theology, which encourages
political activism. The Haitian church hierarchy has accused the
priest of preaching violence and class struggle.

<HEAD>Dissident Physicist Credits Recent Reform For Travel Permit</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ANDREW KATELL</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Soviet dissident Andrei D. Sakharov says the
government's approval of his first foreign trip, with visits to as
many as six U.S. cities next month, is a result of President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev's recent reforms.
   The 67-year-old physicist who spent eight years in exile in his
own country for human rights campaigning, told a Friday news
conference that authorities agreed ``in principle'' to the trip but
have not yet issued travel documents.
   ``I consider that the positive response making my trip possible
stems from the very big changes in our country during the last few
years,'' said Sakharov, who won the 1975 Nobel Peace Prize for his
human rights activities.
   The lifting of the travel ban against Sakharov, father of the
Soviet dissident movement, marked another reversal in Kremlin
policy by Gorbachev, who has liberalized Soviet society on many
fronts.
   Sakharov said he plans to attend a meeting in Washington of a
philanthropic group called the International Foundation for the
Survival and Development of Humanity.
   Sakharov is to attend the foundation's board meeting in
Washington Nov. 15-16 and meetings in Los Angeles, San Francisco,
Boston, New York and possibly Chicago, said group member Edward B.
Hodgman.
   The foundation was set up in January to help solve
environmental, human rights, disarmament and economic development
problems.
   The U.S. State Department welcomed the Soviet decision but urged
Moscow to give the same permission to all Soviets wishing to travel
abroad.
   ``Soviet use of alleged knowledge of state secrets to deny many
other Soviet citizens the right to travel abroad is deplorable and
inconsistent with Soviet commitments under the Helsinki Accords,''
said spokesman Charles Redman.
   Sakharov's trip could set an uncomfortable precedent. Hundreds
of citizens have been denied permission to travel abroad on grounds
they know state secrets.
   He had been denied permission to travel on grounds he had access
to sensitive information while working on the Soviet hydrogen bomb
in the 1950s.
   Sakharov has spoken out repeatedly for free emigration and
protested the Soviet intervention in Afghanistan in 1979.
   He was exiled to the closed city of Gorky in 1980 and released
under Gorbachev's administration in December 1986.
   In another sign of his return to good graces of Soviet
officials, Sakharov was elected one of 47 members to the ruling
Presidium of the prestigious academy. During the now-disgraced rule
of President Leonid Brezhnev, some academy members tried to expell
Sakharov.
   Sakharov said the academy voted 152-82 to elect him to the
Presidium, its leading body. Tass said Sakharov now is conducting
research in cosmology, the study of the universe's origin.
   The physicist said his wife, Yelena Bonner, would not travel
with him but will travel later to the United States alone for
medical treatment.

<HEAD>Congress Approves Tax Bill</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM LUTHER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Congress today completed action on a bill
cutting taxes by $4.1 billion and increasing the clout of
individuals involved in disputes with the Internal Revenue Service.
   With only a half-dozen members on the floor, the Senate approved
the bill by voice vote and sent it to President Reagan, who,
backers predict, will sign it. The House had endorsed the
compromise a few hours earlier on a 395-1 vote.
   ``There are thousands and thousands and thousands of people who
are going to be beneficiaries and they'll thank us for doing our
job,'' said Senate Republican Leader Bob Dole of Kansas.
   Those thousands include farmers, who will be relieved of paying
the federal tax on diesel fuel used for off-road purposes and will
no longer have to fret with the paperwork caused by the ``heifer
tax'' on livestock. Other winners include owners of mutual funds,
free-lance writers, workers who receive tuition payments from their
employers and families saving for a child's college education.
   But taxes on other groups will have to go up by $4.1 billion
over three years to pay for the $4.1 billion of selected tax cuts.
   The losers include pipe smokers, who, for the first time, will
have to pay a tax of 45 cents on a pound of their favorite smoking
mix; anyone accustomed to writing off part of their basic home
phone charge; investors in single-premium life insurance policies,
and some corporations, especially those owned by native Alaskans.
   Alaska corporations would lose a special benefit that has
allowed them to sell operating losses to profitable companies.
Lawmakers say the provision has been abused.
   Negotiators who drafted the final legislation accepted most of
the ``taxpayer's bill of rights,'' written chiefly by Sen. David
Pryor, D-Ark., which is aimed at tipping the scales slightly more
toward taxpayers when they face audit or collection actions by the
IRS.
   These provisions were approved in response to a growing concern
among many lawmakers about isolated reports of taxpayers being
harassed and intimidated by some IRS employees.
   In the future, the IRS would have to fully inform taxpayers of
their rights and recourses before any audit or collection steps are
taken. The agency would have to give a 30-day notice, compared with
10 days in current law, before seizing property to pay back taxes,
and it would be barred from promoting employees on the basis of how
much money they collect.
   The legislation, more than two years in the making, was designed
originally to clear up typographical errors and ambiguous wording
in the big tax overhaul enacted in 1986. It grew in size as the
tax-writing committees tacked on amendments extending some expiring
provisions and granting tax benefits for selected groups.
   A major non-tax provision seizes 540 acres of land adjacent to
the Manassas Battlefield in northern Virginia to block construction
of a shopping mall on the site. The Reagan administration opposes
this provision, although there has been no indication whether it
would prompt a veto.
   Negotiators, meeting behind closed doors, dropped another
unrelated provision, which would have imposed economic sanctions
against Iraq to protest that nation's use of poison gas against
some of its Kurdish citizens.
   Major provisions would:
   _Exempt from tax interest earned on U.S. savings bonds that are
redeemed to pay for college, starting Jan. 1, 1990.
   _Extend expiring tax benefits to help lower-income families buy
their first home; reward businesses for increased spending for
research and experimentation, and boost incentives for investment
in low-income rental housing.
   _Renew an expired provision that allows workers to exclude from
income tuition payments made by their employers; most graduate
study would not qualify.
   _Extend an exclusion for the value of employer-financed
legal-service benefits.
   _Prohibit a business deduction for the basic monthly cost of a
home telephone.
   _Allow free-lance writers, artists and photographers to deduct
certain expenses before a project starts producing income.
   _Permit owners of mutual funds to deduct certain operating
expenses of the fund without having to meet a requirement that only
miscellaneous expenses exceeding 2 percent of income be deducted.
   The single House vote against the bill was cast by Rep. Henry B.
Gonzalez, D-Texas.

   Actor Gregory Peck will receive the
1989 American Film Institute's Life Achievement Award, the
organization's chairman announced.
   Peck, who received an Academy Award for ``To Kill a
Mockingbird'' in 1962, will be honored March 9 at the institute's
annual award dinner at the Beverly Hilton Hotel. The event will be
broadcast on NBC.
   ``Gregory Peck joins a distinguished group of individuals who
have made enormous contributions to America's film heritage,''
AFI's new chairman, Gene Jankowski, said in announcing the award
Friday.
   Peck began his acting career in 1939 and took off in various
Broadway productions, including ``Morning Star'' and ``Sons of
Soldiers.''
   His theatrical successes brought him to Hollywood. He received
Academy Award nominations as best actor for ``The Keys of the
Kingdom,'' ``The Yearling,'' ``Gentleman's Agreement'' and ``Twelve
O'Clock High.''
   His portrayal of southern lawyer Atticus Finch in ``To Kill a
Mockingbird'' won him his fifth nomination and the Oscar.
   Previous Life Achievement winners include Jack Lemmon, Barbara
Stanwyck, Billy Wilder, Gene Kelly, Lillian Gish, John Huston and
Frank Capra.

   Actor Peter Fonda, answering critics of his
support of the ``bottle bill'' initiative on the Nov. 8 ballot,
says being a Montana resident for 14 years gives him the right to
speak out on state issues.
   Earlier this week, Montana recyclers who oppose the measure
calling for a mandatory deposit on bottles criticized Fonda's
appearance in a television commercial.
   Fonda, the brother of actress Jane Fonda and star of the 1969
film ``Easy Rider,'' responded with a news conference here Friday,
introducing himself as ``Peter Fonda, a Livingston actor. Not a
Hollywood actor; I live in Livingston.''
   Fonda reiterated his contention that the proposal would expand,
not diminish, recycling in Montana. He supplied copies of letters
from governors, mayors and others endorsing mandatory deposit laws.
   ``I want to also make it clear that I do not appreciate the
attitude or methods used by Montana's recyclers,'' said Fonda, who
has a ranch in the Paradise Valley near Livingston. ``Living here,
I should have a right to speak out in Montana without being called
names.''
   Fonda said he had neither given nor received money in connection
with the referendum campaign, but had donated his services because
he believes in the need for a deposit law.
   ``I'm not even getting lunch out of this,'' he said.

   Pulitzer Prize-winning playwright David
Mamet, who's expressed distrust for Hollywood in previous works and
statements, seems to have mellowed somewhat in his attitude toward
Tinseltown.
   ``I'm learning all kinds of lessons from Hollywood all the
time,'' Mamet said in a recent interview here.
   At the moment, Hollywood is treating the feisty playwright
rather well.
   The 40-year-old writer, who won the Pulitzer for his play
``Glengarry Glen Ross,'' is getting the royal treatment for
``Things Change,'' a Columbia Pictures release that opened Friday.
   Mamet co-wrote and directed the comedy about a gangster, played
by Joe Mantegna, who lures a shoeshine man, played by Don Ameche,
to the gaming tables here.
   Mamet has written 10 plays and four screenplays. In addition to
his Pulitzer, he has garnered an Oscar nomination. His play,
``Speed-the-Plow,'' which opened on Broadway in May and starred
Mantegna, Ron Silver and Madonna, shows his view of Hollywood as a
cutthroat town with a dollar-sign mentality.
   Mamet divides his time between a Vermont farm and a home in
Cambridge, Mass.

   One of actor Michael Caine's
partners in a restaurant suffered serious burns when fire broke out
at his home after what police called a ``serious domestic
incident'' with his wife.
   Peter Langan, 47, was listed in serious but stable condition
Friday night in a burn unit at St. Andrew's Hospital in Billericay.
His wife, Susan, 46, was treated at Colchester General Hospital and
released after breaking her ankle in a jump from a window.
   A police source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the
fire had not begun when Mrs. Langan leaped from a first-floor
balcony from the 10-room house in Alphamstone, Essex, about 50
miles northwest of London.
   ``We do not know whether the fire was started deliberately,'' he
said. He said a ``serious domestic incident'' had occurred before
the fire broke out.
   Chef Richard Shepherd, one of Langan's restaurant partners, said
it was ``a pure accident'' which started when an oil heater in
their bedroom caught fire.
    Langan's Brasserie, one of London's best-known show business
gathering places, is co-owned by Langan, Shepherd and Caine.

   The violence that convulsed Algeria
earlier this month left 159 people dead and 154 injured, according
to the Interior Ministry.
   Unofficial estimates by medical workers during the uprising that
began Oct. 4 in Algeria put the number of dead at up to 500. Most
of the deaths reportedly resulted from troops firing into crowds of
demonstrators.
   The Information Ministry had said 176 died in rioting that
spread to Oran and other cities. The unrest ended Oct. 12 when the
president announced a referendum on reform measures, set for Nov.
3. No explanation was given for the difference in the death
estimates.
   The unrest, spurred by Algeria's economic crisis, began with
demonstrators protesting food shortages and rising prices, and
demanding an end to President Chadli Bendjedid's austerity program.
   Algeria, whose economy is run on a Soviet-style, centrally
directed system, has been hurt by the fall in oil prices. About 95
percent of the North African country's income is dervied from oil
and gas.

<TEXT>
   Congress today sent President Reagan a
far-reaching anti-drug bill that one Senate leader calls ``bad news
for drug dealers and their customers.''
   Final passage was delayed until the early morning hours, as
conservatives privately demanded anti-obscenity language that was
considered unconstitutional by many liberals and moderates.
   But after negotiators compromised with language to create a new
obscenity trafficking offense, the House approved the bill 346-11
and the Senate followed suit by voice vote. The House vote came at
1:20 a.m. EDT and the Senate acted at 3:15 a.m EDT.
   The bill contains stiff penalties for drug traffickers and
users, and comes just in time for incumbents to trumpet its passage
in their re-election campaigns.
   Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan., said the bill is ``bad
news for drug dealers and their customers,'' and promised that
Congress would pass ``even tougher medicine'' next year.
   ``This is a very strong bill,'' said Senate Majority Leader
Robert Byrd, D-W.Va. ``The message is simple. Don't do drugs. The
country will not tolerate it.''
   The bill would fight illegal drugs through law enforcement,
stiffer penalties, treatment, rehabilitation, education and aid for
authorities in drug-producing countries.
   The compromise legislation, a product of marathon Senate-House
negotiations this week, would send a strong message that even
``recreational'' drug use is unacceptable.
   The bill would make it possible for those possessing small
quantities of drugs intended for personal use to be hit with up to
$10,000 in civil fines, with the right of court review. Beginning
next September those convicted of drug offenses _ including
possession could face loss of student loans and other federal
benefits for even a possession conviction.
   Drug kingpins and others who kill or order killings while
committing drug-related felonies could themselves be executed under
a revitalized federal death penalty. Serious drug offenses would
carry stiffer minimum prison terms.
   Language to strengthen the federal obscenity law was included in
the compromise by congressional leaders seeking to avoid a
threatened conservative revolt at all costs. Leaders have insisted
the bill be acceptable to Republicans and Democrats, liberals and
conservatives.
   Negotiators were unable to resolve disputes _ and thus left out
of the final bill _ proposals for random drug testing for
transportation workers and those with safety-related jobs at
nuclear facilities.
   The legislation provides about $500 million in new spending,
which would barely cover a third of the first-year cost of an
estimated $1.4 billion.
   The ineligibility for benefits could affect public housing,
grants, contracts, loans, mortgage guarantees and some forms of
veterans aid _ but not Social Security, Medicare, welfare benefits,
veterans disability and other safety-net programs. Judges would
have discretion in imposing the penalties after a conviction.
   The president would submit a report to Congress on the program
next May, allowing lawmakers to reconsider the proposal before the
scheduled September 1989 start of the punishment.
   The capital punishment provision provides that if someone is
killed during a federal drug felony, the death penalty could apply
if: the killer was engaged in a continuing criminal enterprise; was
trafficking in major amounts of cocaine, heroin or other drugs;
intentionally gave an order that resulted in a killing; or killed a
police officer.
   To coordinate the nation's anti-drug policy, a ``drug czar''
would be added to the president's Cabinet. The official would
develop plans for every phase of the drug war, share with relevant
Cabinet members the authority to transfer personnel and have the
right to object when he believes drug funding is inadequate or
misdirected.
   The obscenity trafficking section would allow the government to
prosecute those engaged in the business of obscenity, who derive
income from their dealings in obscene materials.
   The traffickers could be forced to forfeit the obscene material
and their profits. Other property belonging to them could be seized
at a judge's discretion.

amassed $103 million through embezzlement, theft, bribes and
kickbacks, funneled it through secret bank accounts and used it to
buy valuable real estate, says the grand jury that indicted him.
   Marcos, 71, and his 59-year-old wife, Imelda, also defrauded
three U.S. lending institutions of $165 million in order to buy and
finance the properties, according to the racketeering indictment
returned Friday.
   ``This is a plan hatched and begun in the Philippines to move
massive amounts of money illegally into the United States,'' said
U.S. Attorney Rudolph Giuliani. ``Then the Marcoses came to the
United States and continued their illegal activities.''
   Saudi Arabian financier Adnan Khashoggi, a central figure in the
secret sale of arms to Iran by the Reagan administration, also was
indicted.
   A Washington-based lawyer for the Marcoses, Richard Hibey, told
a Honolulu news conference that the couple would plead innocent
when arraigned in Manhattan on Oct. 31.
   ``The charges are false,'' Hibey said.
   Philippine President Corazon Aquino, who rode to power on a
civilian-military revolt that forced Marcos to flee the country in
1986, welcomed the indictment today and said it would deter other
dictators from plundering their countries.
   ``I hope that this and other similar efforts undertaken in other
countries to investigate the crimes of the Marcoses will lead to
the early recovery of the stolen assets that rightfully belong to
the Filipino people,'' she said in a statement.
   Hibey charged that Marcos had been given until Thursday to
accept or reject a ``drop-dead deal,'' which would have required
him and his wife to plead guilty to felony racketeering charges and
testify against others _ including family members _ with no
assurances they would avoid jail.
   Giuliani refused to comment on any plea bargain negotiations.
   Hibey suggested that the United States promised to indict Marcos
during negotiations on extending agreements covering U.S. military
bases in the Philippines. Under an agreement announced earlier this
week, the United States will pay much less for the bases than the
Philippine government first demanded.
   He expressed concern that Marcos ``may not be physically able to
withstand the rigors of a criminal trial of this scope and
magnitude.''
   Marcos did not attend the news conference. In the 2{ years he
has lived in Hawaii, he has been treated for a variety of
illnesses, including chest pains.
   Another Marcos lawyer, John J. Tigue, said the Marcoses were
``deeply disappointed'' that President Reagan did not prevent the
indictment.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said Reagan was saddened
by the indictment because Marcos ``is an old friend and a friend of
the country.''
   ``But it's clear that the Justice Department has a very strong
case,'' Fitzwater added.
   The indictment alleges that the Marcoses illegally amassed $103
million through theft, embezzlement, bribes and kickbacks between
September 1972, when Marcos declared martial law, and his departure
in 1986.
   They allegedly funneled the money illegally through secret bank
accounts in Switzerland, Hong Kong and the United States, then used
it to buy four commercial buildings at choice Manhattan locations.
   Charged with racketeering with the Marcoses were Khashoggi;
Bienvenido Tantoco Sr., former Philippine ambassador to the
Vatican; his wife, Gliceria, once the president of a Filipino
department store; the Los Angeles-based California Overseas Bank
and its chairman, Roberto S. Benedicto; and the bank's former
president, Rodolfo T. Aranbulo.
   The Marcoses, the Tantocos and Khashoggi plotted to conceal the
true ownership of the four Manhattan buildings through false
documents, the indictment said.
   Robert J. Morvillo, Khashoggi's attorney, said Khashoggi
``vehemently denies that he knowingly violated any U.S. law in
connection with any dealings he had with Mr. and Mrs. Marcos.''
   The six-count indictment also accused the Marcoses of scheming
to buy $5.9 million in art objects and of transporting money and
certain works of art they knew to be stolen.
   The indictment also charged that the Marcoses and Tantocos
defrauded Citibank, Security Pacific National Bank and the Security
Pacific Mortgage Corp. of more than $165 million to buy one
building and refinance others.
   Each racketeering charge carries a maximum penalty of 20 years
in prison and $250,000 in fines.
   Three others were indicted on lesser charges.
   Giuliani said a minimum of $250 million in property would be
subject to forfeiture upon conviction.
   For the Marcoses, that includes the four New York buildings,
their home in Honolulu and some 28 foreign bank accounts.
   The government also is seeking forfeiture of Khashoggi's posh
Manhattan condominium, as well two bank accounts and other
properties.
   The Philippine government has filed 39 civil suits against
Marcos seeking $96.7 billion in damages. It hasn't filed any
criminal charges for fear that Marcos would insist on returning to
the Philippines to face them.

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Larger-than-usual blood transfusions in recent days
have improved Emperor Hirohito's anemia, but court officials said
today that his kidney and liver functions are worsening.
   Doctors have stopped using antibiotics to treat the 87-year-old
monarch's infected bile duct, said Kenji Maeda, the Imperial
Household Agency spokesman.
   Maeda said only that physicians ``believed it was necessary to
do so,'' but news reports quoted palace sources as saying the
infection had declined and doctors were concerned about side
effects from prolonged use of strong drugs.
   Hirohito received another transfusion of 0.4 of a pint Friday
night, Maeda said. That brought the total he has been given since
his condition worsened on Sept. 19 to 24 pints _ nearly three times
as much as is normally in his body.
   Kyodo News Service quoted unnamed palace sources as saying the
emperor's liver functions were worsening and that the nitrogen
level in his blood was three times above normal.
   Palace officials said the emperor had not discharged any blood
for two days, but doctors believed his internal bleeding was
continuing.

<HEAD>100th Congress Ends Productive Two-year Run</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LAWRENCE L. KNUTSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The 100th Congress, ending a productive
two-year run with an early morning flurry of legislative action,
sent President Reagan a compromise bill providing new weapons to
fight the war on drugs.
   Congress also approved tax adjustment legislation with a
three-year price tag of $4.1 billion.
   It upped the ante for Wall Street inside traders, passing
legislation to increase fines and prison terms for individual
offenders and to penalize investment firms that permit the practice.
   But efforts to impose economic sanctions against Iraq for poison
gas attacks against Kurdish villagers were blocked in the House.
   Chairman Claiborne Pell, D-R.I., of the Senate Foreign Relations
Committee said the sanctions bill was bottled up by House members
beholden to ``special interests,'' including the U.S. oil and
agricultural industries. He vowed to try again on sanctions
legislation early next year.
   A struggle to reconcile differences between the House and Senate
versions of the anti-drug bill caused Congress to abandon plans to
adjourn for the year in early October.
   Many senators, including virtually all of those up for
re-election on Nov. 8, had left town and a handful of senators
remained to guide the Senate through the final hours of the 100th
Congress. All bills were adopted by voice votes.
   In the House, the anti-drug bill was adopted 346 to 11. The tax
adjustment bill passed, 358-1.
   The Senate finally adjourned at 3:16 a.m., about 20 minutes
after the House closed down.
   ``The 100th Congress came in like a lion and it is about to go
out like a lion,'' said Majority Leader Robert C. Byrd, D-W.Va.,
moments before the final gavel cracked.
   Hours before adjournment, House and Senate leaders called
President Reagan to announce the end was near.
   ``The 100th Congress is coming to a star-spangled close,'' the
president was told by Byrd who wore a star-spangled tie for the
occasion.
   Byrd and Senate Republican leader Bob Dole of Kansas told
reporters they believe the 100th Congress has compiled the most
productive record of any Congress in 20 years.
   The drug package would fight illegal drugs through law
enforcement, stiffer penalties, treatment, rehabilitation,
education and aid for authorities in drug-producing countries.
   It would make it possible for those possessing small amounts of
drugs for ``recreational'' use to be hit with up to $10,000 in
civil fines and, beginning next September, to face loss of student
loans and other federal benefits for even a possession conviction.
   Murders committed or ordered during drug-related felonies could
result in imposition of the death penalty. Serious drug offenses
would carry stiffer minimum prison terms.
   The original purpose of the tax bill was to correct errors in
the 1986 tax overhaul. But in its final form the bill does more
than that.
   The agreement carries a $4.1 billion price tag over three years
and a ``bill of rights'' for taxpayers.
   More than two years in the making, the legislation now includes
tax relief for farmers, free-lance writers, owners of mutual funds,
recipients of employer-financed tuition and a variety of other
interests. It also includes selected tax increases to pay for those
benefits.
   Pressure to pass the tax bill came mainly from farmers, who
would benefit by no longer being required to pay the federal diesel
tax and by being allowed to deduct some expenses of producing
livestock before the animals generate income.
   Pressure also came from accountants and other tax professionals,
who were seeking corrections for hundreds of errors and ambiguities
in the big tax overhaul enacted in 1986.
   The end of the 100th Congress marked the retirement of six
senators, including President Pro Tempore John Stennis of
Mississippi, who has been a member of the chamber for 40 of his 87
years. Also retiring are Sens. William Proxmire, D-Wis., a 30-year
Senate veteran; Robert Stafford, R-Vt.; Dan Evans, R-Wash.; Lawton
Chiles, D-Fla., and Paul Trible, R-Va.
   Other legislation sent to President Reagan on Friday included:
   _Compromise legislation that would further restrict lobbying by
former executive branch officials and apply lobbying restraints to
former members of Congress for the first time. The legislation
would bar departing members of Congress from lobbying their former
colleagues in either chamber for one year.
   _A $1.5 billion authorization for Corps of Engineers flood
control and navigation projects in 12 states.
   _Three House-approved bills aimed at focusing the government's
long-range aviation research, boosting the commercial satellite
industry and bringing order to federal superconductivity efforts.
The aviation proposal directs the Federal Aviation Administration
to step up its research on aircraft safety, including fire
prevention and the problems faced by aging planes.
   _A congressional gold medal was authorized to be minted in honor
of famed artist Andrew Wyeth.
   _Assorted measures passed by both chambers proclaimed National
Jukebox Week, Uncle Sam Day, National Lighthouse Day, National
Skiing Day, National Earthquake Awareness Week and National
Asparagus Week.
   _A measure calling for a memorial honoring women who served in
Vietnam.
   _Legislation ordering the government to ban the sale of lawn
darts, a game that is blamed for the deaths of three children and
injuries to thousands of others.

   Orel Hershiser, appearing on ``The Tonight
Show starring Johnny Carson,'' sang a few bars from the hymn he
said lifted his spirits when the pressure was on during the World
Series.
   On the urging of Carson and Friday's studio audience, Hershiser
warbled ``Praise God, from whom all blessings flow .... Praise
Father, Son and Holy Ghost.''
   The Christian hymn, known as the Doxology, dates back to 1695
and is based on text from Psalm 150.
   Carson, who appeared to be somewhat embarrassed and moved, said,
``That's very sweet.'' The audience responded with sustained
applause.
   Hershiser said he sung the hymn on the mound on Thursday as he
pitched the Los Angeles Dodgers to victory over the Oakland
Athletics in the fifth and deciding game of the World Series, which
the Dodgers won four games to one.
   Carson asked Hershiser, winner of the most valuable player
awards in this year's World Series and National League Championship
Series, what his future plans are.
   ``Retirement,'' the 30-year-old pitcher quipped.

<HEAD>Students Firebomb USO Facility After U.S. Soldiers And Koreans
Brawl</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Twenty students hurled firebombs at a
USO building after a brawl between Koreans and U.S. soldiers,
police and news reports said today.
   No injuries were reported in the attack Friday night on the
United Services Organization, a recreational body for American
soldiers based overseas.
   There also were no damages, U.S. military authorities said, even
though one firebomb cleared a fence but missed the building. Guards
immediately put out the blaze without incident, the authorities
said.
   Seoul newspapers said the attack involved 20 slogan-chanting
students who hurled about 10 firebombs at the American facility and
scattered leaflets demanding the U.S. government apologize for
assaults by American soldiers on Koreans.
   One American soldier and three Koreans were injured last Sunday
in a fight involving about 40 U.S. soldiers and 200 Koreans in
Itaewon, a shopping district close to the U.S. military
headquarters in southern Seoul.
   Radicals recently stepped up an anti-U.S. campaign in the
aftermath of the Olympics Games, when the actions and manners of
some American athletes and the allegedly biased coverage of Korea
by the U.S. media during the Sept. 17-Oct. 2 games upset many
Koreans.
   Dissidents demand the withdrawal of about 42,000 U.S. troops
stationed in South Korea under a mutual defense pact, contending
the United States hampers unification of the Korean peninsula.
   The peninsula was divided into the communist North and the
capitalist South in 1945, at the end of World War II.
   In another development, the U.S. Embassy has asked American
officials and athletes taking part in the International Paralympics
Games in Seoul to refrain from going to Itaewon at night, U.S.
officials said.
   Signs were posted in living quarters of American athletes, but
the embassy gave no explanation, they said.
   Bob Pearson, a spokesman for the U.S. team, said the embassy has
asked his team not to wear clothes or uniforms identifying
nationality during the visit to Itaewon.

<HEAD>Scholars Try Dispelling Myths About African Cults</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SUSANA HAYWARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The scholars who gathered this week
in San Juan wanted to explain the appeal of African cults, so they
built shrines of drums, wooden skulls and hot peppers as public
offerings.
   ``African religions are not about evil, spilling blood or
worshiping devils,'' said Puerto Rican anthropologist Ricardo
Alegria, founder of the Center for Advanced Studies for the
Caribbean.
   ``If African cults exist today, it's because they are growing.
And if there are followers, it's because cults aren't evil,''
Alegria said.
   Alegria was among anthropologists and sociologists from the
United States, Haiti, Venezuela, Cuba, the Dominican Republic and
Brazil who participated in a weeklong symposium at the University
of San Juan on African religions in the Caribbean and Latin America.
   Organizers said the conference, which closed Friday, was the
first of its kind. It focused on the religions that branched out in
the Caribbean after black slaves were brought to the New World by
European colonists nearly 500 years ago.
   ``We hope to bring a better scientific understanding of these
religions, why they survive and what role they play in society,''
said Mercedes Sandoval, a social science professor at Florida's
Miami-Dade Community College.
   It's believed up to 200 million people follow some type of
African-rooted religion in the Caribbean and Latin America, but
experts say the numbers could be higher because belonging to a cult
is not necessarily information people volunteer.
   Influenced by Spanish, British, French and Dutch religions,
slaves slowly incorporated religious elements of their colonial
masters into their own beliefs.
   For example, Caribbean islands colonized by the French and
Spanish adapted elements of Roman Catholicism, using effigies of
saints in their own ceremonies. Initially, slaves used statues of
saints as props to hide their own relics from the Europeans.
   But the two sides fused and today, syncretism, the combination
of different beliefs, dominates many African religions. It's common
in some places to see a statue of St. George atop his white horse
standing next to a horned Exu evil spirit.
   In English colonized islands, African religions took a more
evangelical, Protestant tone with less emphasis on religous
effigies.
   Among the religions and cults discussed were abakua, santeria,
shango, palomonte, voodoo, and mayombe.
   Voodoo, it was explained, is not about the Hollywood stereotypes
of zombies and sticking pins in lookalike dolls. Widely practiced
in Haiti where Roman Catholicism is the official religion, voodoo
is a blend of Catholicism and Indian mysticism, with an emphasis on
ancestor worship and harmony with nature.
   Animal sacrifices play a part in many ceremonies such as
Brazil's candombe and umbanda religions, in which goats and
chickens are killed by a ``babaorisha,'' a father of a saint, and
offered to holy spirits so they will grant earthlings good fortune.
   The symposium featured an exhibit of nine altars and shrines
displaying the paraphernalia of African rites.
   The Nigerian altar had a curtain of dry palm leaves protecting
holy rocks and bata drums that call spirits or serve as background
music to celebrate a saints' birthday.
   Many shrines had cauldrons stuffed with feathers, wooden skulls,
spicy sauces, fruits and herbs.
   Cuba's exhibit showed the influence of the Yoruba people of
Nigeria, who hid their dieties underneath bright satin and beaded
mantelpieces.

   One of three trapped whales disappeared
under the ice and was presumed dead today, a biologist said only
hours after rescuers scored their greatest success in moving the
animals closer to open water.
   The whale named Bone was last seen late Friday afternoon, said
Geoff Carroll, a North Slope Borough biologist helping lead the
effort to rescue the three California gray whales.
   By midnight, Carroll and others on the ice near this small town
on the Arctic Ocean had given up hope that Bone might rejoin the
others. Bone, Crossbeak and Bonnet have stuck together since
becoming trapped in unseasonably heavy ice more than two weeks ago
during their annual migration southward.
   The missing whale got its name because skin on its snout had
been rubbed down to the bone by the rough ice surrounding a
breathing hole that kept the mammals alive. That condition may have
led to Bone's death, said biologist Craig George.
   ``Once they get a bone infection, they go pretty quick,'' George
said.
   Eskimos led the whales almost a half mile closer to open water
earlier Friday by carving a string of 24 breathing holes in the ice
away from the main hole the animals had been using.
   Meanwhile, a helicopter-dropped concrete ``bullet'' bashed a
trail from the direction of the open water.
   About two dozen Eskimo volunteers, many of them bowhead whale
hunters, worked about eight hours to cut the 10-by-30-foot holes
with chain saws.
   ``The whales have moved all the way to the 24th hole,'' said
Col. Tom Carroll, commander of the Alaska Army National Guard's
portion of the rescue effort. ``I'm not sure how they did it, but
leave it up to Eskimo ingenuity.''
   De-icers, which keep the holes open by agitating the water,
freed the Eskimos to work on new holes. Until two Minnesota men
brought the devices earlier this week, rescuers had spent all their
time keeping the original breathing holes from freezing up.
   Another dozen de-icing devices and a dozen more chain saws were
on the way to Barrow.
   A huge CH-54 Skycrane helicopter loaned by the Guard began
working toward the whales from about four miles away, so as not to
scare the mammals. It used a 5-ton, steel-tipped concrete block
suspended from its belly to punch four 15-to-20-foot holes in the
ice at 75-yard intervals.
   ``They hover the helicopter 20 feet over the ice, and drop the
`bullet','' said Spec. 4 Wade Palmer, a Guard spokesman. ``It drops
through the ice on the second or third try. Then they pull it back
out.''
   A second Skycrane abandoned the repeatedly frustrated effort to
tow a 185-ton icebreaking ``hover-barge'' 230 miles from Prudhoe
Bay, and was to fly to Barrow today to help bash more holes in the
ice, said Tom Carroll.
   The first helicopter began working just inside a troublesome ice
ridge that blocks the path to freedom and lies about a quarter-mile
from an area of open water leading to the sea.
   The ridge, formed when drifting pack ice collided with ice
anchored on the ocean bottom, is too thick to be punctured by the
helicopters, and demolition experts were on their way to assess the
situation, said Geoff Carroll.
   ``We looked for an alternate route (bypassing the ridge) and
didn't find it,'' Carroll said. ``If there's no way through it, it
will have to be tackled early while the whales still are some ways
from it.''
   Ron Morris of the National Marine Fisheries Service has
expressed reluctance to use explosives for fear they might harm
other marine mammals.
   The Soviet Union offered Friday to send an icebreaking vessel
now 300 miles miles from Point Barrow to help carve a path for the
trapped whales. But Carroll said water in the area may be too
shallow for the vessel.
   Easterly wind opened leads, or open water, through the ice to
within four miles of the whales Friday, giving added urgency to the
effort to free them before a shift in the wind could pinch off the
escape routes.
   The whales still would face a 200-mile trek through the leads to
reach open sea, and weather forecasts indicate the favorable wind
may end this weekend.
   The whales also have Eskimo names. Kanik (Snowflake) for Bone,
Putu (Icehole) for Crossbeak and Siku (Ice) for Bonnet.

<HEAD>Only One in Five Americans Part of Fitness `Boom'</HEAD>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>

   The fitness movement has bypassed four out of
five American adults, especially those who are older, have low
incomes and are less educated, a new survey says.
   Only one in five U.S. adults gets significant exercise at least
twice a week, and 45 percent don't participate in any fitness
activity, according to the survey of 12,500 people commissioned by
the National Sporting Goods Association.
   Lowest rates of participation are among people over 55 years
old, those with incomes under $15,000 and those lacking college
educations, according to the survey.
   ``You would have had to be living under the proverbial rock to
miss hearing about the need for frequent participation in a fitness
activity,'' said Thomas B. Doyle, research director for the
sporting goods group.
   The scientific evidence linking physical activity to health is
growing, according to Dr. J. Michael McGinnis, director of the
federal Office of Disease Prevention and Health Promotion in
Washington.
   ``We know that regular exercise can reduce the risk of heart
disease and help maintain a healthy weight,'' he said in a
statement. ``And it can also make people feel better.''
   The survey defined significant exercise as any of seven
activities: aerobic exercising, cycling, calisthenics, exercising
with equipment, exercise walking, running-jogging and swimming. It
didn't say how long each activity must be performed.
   The survey's findings parallel those of previous studies by the
national Centers for Disease Control and other groups.
   Inactivity threatens the health of a far greater proportion of
Americans than any of the much-publicized evils of smoking, high
blood pressure or high blood cholesterol, one researcher said.
   Yet a sedentary lifestyle can double the risk of a fatal heart
attack or stroke, said the researcher, Harold Kohl, an
epidemiologist with the Institute of Aerobics Research in Dallas.
   ``It's almost the same (risk) as for ... smoking, high blood
pressure, high cholesterol,'' he said in a telephone interview
Friday.
   ``An overwhelming majority of the population is not exercising
currently at the levels we believe most optimal for health,'' he
said.
   Kohl said he believes people are discouraged by the belief that
they must exercise at ``optimal'' levels _ 20 minutes a day, three
times a week, at 65 percent of the heart's maximum capacity to pump
blood.
   But latest findings indicate that the highest risks of death
from fatal heart attacks or strokes occur only in the most inactive
people, and substantial benefits result from activities such as
brisk walks and gardening.
   ``People think you've got to go out and do marathons,
triathlons, 10 K's (10-kilometer races),'' Kohl said. ``What we
need to say is, `Turn off the TV, do some gardening, take a walk
after dinner.'''
   The survey was conducted by the independent polling organization
N.P.D. Research in Port Washington, N.Y., and had a margin of error
of plus or minus 5 percentage points, Doyle said.
   It was released in conjunction with the International Sporting
Goods Association trade show running through today in Chicago.

   A storm packing 75 mph winds and
15-foot waves has left at least 10 people drowned and another 700
missing, authorities in Bangladesh said today.
   Residents said they had no warning of the storm that developed
suddenly in the Bay of Bengal.
   Rescue workers today found nine bodies floating in the bay near
the island of Maheskhali. One person also died in Dhaka, where more
than 1,000 were injured, officials said.
   At least 1,500 people had been reported missing Friday, but
district officials said today that about 800 were rescued.
Authorities said their search was continuing for the other 700,
most of them fishermen.
   The storm struck almost two months after floods inundated much
of Bangladesh, killing at least 1,000 people and leaving homeless
about 50 million of this impoverished country's 110 million people.

   This community above the Arctic Circle,
the northernmost in the United States, hardly qualifies as a
popular fall destination with its below-zero weather, fog and the
occasional polar bear roaming the streets.
   But the drama of efforts to free three ice-trapped whales has
turned the Eskimo village into a boom town.
   ``It feels like this is Grand Central station,'' said Fran Tate,
owner of Pepe's North of the Border Restaurant, where business in
the past week has been up 20 percent.
   Hordes of journalists from Australia to New York have come to
report on the plight of the California gray whales, imprisoned
under Arctic Ocean ice about 13 miles northeast of here for more
than two weeks. One of the whales disappeared under the ice Friday
and was presumed dead.
   Residents of this whaling village of about 2,200 people are more
accustomed to visits from polar bears that occasionally wander in
off the ice pack. But they are taking the attention and the demands
of the media in stride.
   ``We've become something of a nerve center,'' said Ron Hewitt,
manager of the Top of the World Hotel.
   The 40-room hotel has been fully booked since Oct. 16, and its
switchboard has been lit up constantly with calls from people
seeking rooms and information about the whales.
   Another 16-room hotel and all 60 rooms at the former Naval
Arctic Research Laboratory also were filled, Hewitt said.
   ``Right now, we're taking the names of people in town who have
space, and we're referring callers to them,'' Hewitt said. ``It's
all part of the community's response, but we're glad to do it.''
   The impact has spread far beyond the hotels.
   A special bank of phones was installed in the North Slope
Borough assembly's chambers Thursday to improve communications,
said Marie Adams of the borough's information liaison office.
   Phone lines in the borough's search-and-rescue operations center
had gotten so clogged the rescue squad couldn't have received
emergency calls had there been any, Adams said.
   And there isn't a rental vehicle left in town. Enterprising
natives are hitching sleds to their snowmobiles to haul reporters,
photographers and TV crews across the ice to view the whales.
   Some reporters went to the operations center to hitch rides to
the ice pack on borough and military helicopters involved in the
rescue effort, but the center was declared off-limits.
   Ill-equipped visitors, unfamiliar with the harsh Arctic
conditions, have created a run on insulated boots, stocking caps,
mittens and other cold-weather gear.
   Journalists also like to eat well.
   ``They're bigger spenders because they're on expense accounts,''
said Tate, who bills her establishment as ``the farthest North
Mexican restaurant.''
   Asked if she thought the media response was out of proportion to
the situation, Tate said, ``Well, maybe just a little bit. But
what's wrong with caring?''
   Tate said the coverage will show the compassion the Eskimos feel
for whales despite their hunting heritage. The Eskimos hunt bowhead
whales, not California grays.

   The story of three trapped whales and efforts to save them from
an icy death has generated sympathy across the nation and around
the world.
   The struggle against time and thickening Arctic ice has gripped
U.S. schoolchildren, made front-page news in Italy and France and
gained extensive coverage by Soviet television news.
   ``It's the kitten in the tree syndrome. If a kitten gets caught,
everybody gathers around to rescue it,'' said Patricia Warhol,
director of the American Cetacean Society in San Pedro, Calif.
   ``We can't do much about Japanese whale hunters, ocean pollution
and gill nets. But here are three whales that maybe we can save,''
Ms. Warhol said in a telephone interview.
   A combination of early ice and shifting winds trapped the three
California gray whales more than two weeks ago near the
northernmost tip of Alaska. Part of an endangered species, the
giant mammals feed in northern waters before migrating past
California to breed in the Pacific Ocean off Mexico.
   Rescuers hope to free them by pulverizing a path through four
miles of ice. They succeeded in drawing the whales nearly a half
mile to open water with a string of holes Friday, but one of the
mammals disappeared later in the day and was presumed dead.
   Television has delivered daily scenes of the struggling whales
emerging to breathe every two minutes, their battered,
barnacle-encrusted snouts rubbed to the bone by jagged ice.
   ``It's a very powerful emotional scene,'' said Cynthia Wilson of
the Friends of the Earth, an environmental group in Washington,
D.C. ``We're not dealing with a bunch of fish. This is a mammal of
extraordinary intelligence that has been extraordinarily hunted and
persecuted.''
   Their plight is a teaching tool in classes such as Cathy
Garrett's kindergarten at Fremont Elementary School in San Diego,
Calif.
   ``Little children love anything big,'' Ms. Garrett said.
``They're very concerned about how the whales got trapped and why
they need to come up to breathe. They're aware these animals have a
right to live. They're fascinated by them.
   ``They want them to survive. They don't want them to be hurt.''
   The drama has produced a wave of support from well-wishers,
including a telephone pep talk from President Reagan to chilled
rescuers. Some have suggested using explosives, rock salt and
bowling balls to defeat the ice.
   ``We get calls and calls and calls,'' said Anne Dingall,
director of ocean ecology for the environmental group Greenpeace.
``A lot of people are phoning for information or to see if there's
anything they can do to help.''
   One suggestion paid immediate dividends. Greg Ferrian and Rick
Skluzacek, two brothers-in-law from Lakeland, Minn., flew to Alaska
at their own expense Wednesday to use their de-icing machines to
enlarge the whales' air pockets.
   The frozen theater has been front-page news in Italy and France,
where TV newscasts play whale clips prominently.
   Soviet coverage has been unusually extensive, with the nightly
news program Vremya carrying reports every day. Some Muscovites say
the rescue attempts give them a good impression of Americans'
concern for life, more than any disarmament initiatives.
   West Germany's ZDF television network was more tongue-in-cheek.
Its report Thursday night said the ``Walkampf,'' a German compound
meaning whale struggle, had upstaged the presidential
``Wahlkampf,'' the German word for election campaign. Pronunciation
of the two words is identical.
   And one South African whale expert was skeptical about the
rescue effort.
   Peter Best of the South African Museum in Cape Town said in an
interview published Friday that the rescue effort ``is all very
humanitarian and noble, but it makes nonsense out of U.S. funding
for (maritime) research,'' which he said has been slashed.
   Gray whales were hunted to near extinction by the 1920s, when
their numbers dipped to below 1,000 while their skins were used for
buggy whips and corsets and their teeth fashioned into ivory
jewelry.
   Environmentalists now estimate their population at about 20,000.

   Police said today they found nearly 100
pounds of heroin in the water tanks of a yacht and broke up a Hong
Kong-based drug ring by employing police officers as crew members.
Authorities said it was Australia's biggest heroin bust.
   In simultaneous raids overnight Friday, police arrested 21
people in Sydney and Hong Kong and seized 96 pounds of high-grade
Thai heroin with an estimated street value of $40 million.
   Seven people were arrested in Sydney and 14 others in raids on
60 premises in Hong Kong, Detective Inspector Cliff Foster said.
   In the ruse, two police officers were able to get jobs as crew
members aboard a 50-foot ketch that authorities suspected was being
used to ferry drugs, said Detective Inspector Mike Howard of the
Royal Hong Kong Police Force Drug Squad.
   Foster said the probe began in June after authorities were
tipped off that a large quantity of heroin was en route from Hong
Kong to Australia.

   Defense Secretary Frank Carlucci says
Americans must get over their fear of selling arms to Arab
countries, or risk losing ground to other countries with the
weapons and the will to step in.
   ``Great Britain, France, China, the Soviet Union and others are
moving into the highly desirable positions of confidence and
influence which America has traditionally enjoyed with friends such
as Jordan and Saudi Arabia,'' Carlucci said. ``I see tens of
billions of dollars worth of jobs going abroad instead of
sustaining our key defense industries and bolstering the U.S.
economy.''
   Carlucci, speaking Friday at an American-Arab relations seminar
at Marshall University, said the threat to Israel would be greater
if Arab countries look to other nations to supply arms.
   ``The notion that U.S. defense cooperation with moderate Arab
states poses a danger to Israel is ill-founded and untrue,''
Carlucci said. ``Israel must regard non-American arms in the hands
of its neighbors as a higher risk.''
   Congress has rejected major arms sales to Saudi Arabia, and
Carlucci warned lawmakers that the denial poses a greater threat
militarily in the Mideast and economically in the United States.
   Fouad Al-Farsy, Saudi Arabia's deputy minister of information,
said earlier in the seminar that his country, like other moderate
neighbors of Israel, should not be treated as the enemy due to its
longstanding relationship with the United States.
   ``In the last 15 years, in the development of Saudi Arabia, we
have looked to the U.S. of America for leadership, guidance ... and
manpower,'' Al-Farsy said.
   The international president of B'nai B'rith, a Jewish civic and
fraternal organization, said the group was dismayed to hear that
Carlucci ``defined United States arms sales policy in terms of
dollars and cents.
   ``If the United States wanted primarily to earn monetary profit
on weapons sales, this country could sell arms to all sorts of
dictatorial and totalitarian regimes around the world,'' said
Seymour Reich.
   ``However, the cornerstone of the U.S. arms sales policy has
always been to examine first and foremost the strategic and moral
implications of military sales,'' Reich said.
   ``In the case of arms sales to the Middle East, the U.S. has
always chosen the wise course of supporting its most reliable ally
in the region, Israel,'' Reich said. ``This has meant, and rightly
so, denying sophisticated weapons to those nations who _ in
defiance of U.S. foreign policy which seeks advancement of the
peace process _ continue to declare themselves to be in a state of
war with America's steadfast partner in strategic cooperation,
Israel.''
   Carlucci and Al-Farsy agreed on the need for Israel and the
Palestine Liberation Organization to meet face-to-face to negotiate
peace in the Mideast, but had differing conditions for how to get
them talking.
   Carlucci said the PLO first needs to renounce terrorism and
agree that Israel has a right to exist.
   ``Palestinian participation is required at every stage of
negotiations concerning the West Bank and Gaza, since the outcome
will affect their interests and will bear directly on their future
as a people,'' Carlucci said. ``Without their active participation,
no agreement can be expected to endure.'' Al-Farsy said the United
States should not set itself up as an ``honest broker'' then take
Israel's side on every question.
   ``There can be no chance for peace if one side will not talk to
the other. To them, progress is the lack of progress,'' Al-Farsy
said of the Israelis. ``Israel is stubborn because it knows the
U.S. of America will support her no matter what position she
takes.''

   A shootout on the midway of the State Fair left
one dead and three wounded, including a police sergeant who was
shot in the hand as he grappled with gunman, authorities said today.
   Two other officers were hurt in scuffles, and numerous
bystanders were knocked down or trampled late Friday and early
today as thousands fled the scene of the gunfight just outside the
Cotton Bowl.
   Police were trying to determine what triggered the violence. The
shooting followed a brawl between black and Hispanic fair-goers,
said police Cpl. D.H. Boy.
   Police Sgt. Manuel Vasquez was in stable condition at Baylor
University Medical Center, where he underwent surgery, said Debbie
Mecham, a nurse at the hospital.
   The man who police said shot Vasquez died of multiple gunshot
wounds, Ms. Mecham said. His name was not released.
   The incident apparently began around 11:45 p.m. with a shooting
in a fair restroom, said police Capt. John Holt.
   An officer who overheard the shot chased two or three people
through the midway crowd and found the sergeant, the gunman, and
another man struggling on the ground, said Holt.
   A gunbattle ensued between the pursuing officer and the gunman,
the captain said.
   Two other men were shot in addition to the gunman and the
sergeant, he said. One was shot in the restroom and the other on
the midway.
   Both were in serious condition, one with a chest wound, the
other with a back wound, said a Parkland Memorial Hospital nurse
who declined to give her name.
   Thousands of people headed for exits when the shooting broke out.
   Seven pregnant women were treated for injuries or premature
labor caused by the fair-goers' stampede. Five other people were
trampled or bruised in the crush.
   Gloria Pena, 17, said she and a friend tried to climb a six-foot
chain link fence to escape the gunfire, but she could not make it
because she is seven months pregnant. She and her friend soon were
engulfed by the crowd.
   ``We were both crying and holding each other and didn't know
what to do,'' Ms. Pena said while waiting for hospital care. ``Then
she fainted.''
   Juan Salazar, 37, of Dallas, was high above the midway on the
Texas Star ferris wheel when the shooting began.
   ``I heard two or three shots and people in the center _ in the
middle _ started running in every direction,'' Salazar said.
``After that, you could see people in different spots just running
like crazy _ just getting away from this area.''

   E. Robert Wallach, who has been indicted in the
Wedtech scandal, says reporters were corrupted by ambitious
prosecutors who leaked information to them.
   ``By the time I was indicted I was already convicted,'' said
Wallach, who is accused of taking payoffs from Wedtech officials in
exchange for influencing the awarding of government contracts.
   ``I am an innocent man caught in this system,'' Wallach told the
Associated Press Managing Editors convention Friday. ``And you,
every one of you, no matter how well-intentioned, played a part in
it.''
   Wallach, a San Francisco lawyer who goes to trial Jan. 3 in New
York on federal racketeering and conspiracy charges, also accused
reporters of slanting their articles by overlooking his record as a
respected litigator.
   Also speaking at the convention were former Democratic vice
presidential candidate Geraldine Ferraro and Wendell Phillippi,
retired managing editor of The Indianapolis News.
   Ferraro told the newspaper editors they crossed the line between
the public's right to know and an invasion of privacy in covering
her bid for the vice presidency in 1984.
   When reporters were finished interviewing everyone they could
find, including a janitor in a school where she once taught, ``they
found nothing newsworthy,'' she said. ``I was what I said I was ...
so they had to go after my family,'' she said, referring to her
husband's business dealings.
   Phillippi was the one who made a telephone call on behalf of
Republican vice presidential candidate Dan Quayle when Quayle
wanted to join the National Guard years ago. Phillippi assailed his
peers Friday for letting what he called an editor's mistake stick.
   ``I'm here as a defendant after being tried in the kangaroo
court in which some of you participated,'' the former APME
president said.
   He said he was belittled, maligned, misquoted and harrassed
after the AP picked up a story from The Indianapolis News that
suggested Phillippi made many calls on Quayle's behalf.
   ``I made one call to one person,'' Phillippi said.
   The AP corrected the story, but Phillippi said he was hounded
for weeks by newspaper reporters from around the country who
continued to base their reports on the erroneous information.
   ``How much are editors responsible for the pushiness of their
reporters?'' he said.
   ``Ours is an honorable profession,'' Phillippi said. ``Please
let's keep it that way.''

<TEXT>
   A three-year probe that led to the
indictments of a retired Air Force colonel and a defense contractor
is likely to produce more charges, a federal prosecutor said.
   Unisys Corp. and its predecessor, Sperry Corp., are each accused
of falsely billing the government for more than $500,000 for work
that was never performed as part of a $526 million contract to
modernize the Air Force's computer network, U.S. Attorney Jim
Wilson said Friday.
   Retired Air Force Col. Robert L. Hedges, 51, of Montgomery is
accused of negotiating a consulting job with Sperry while he was
overseeing the contract, Wilson said.
   Wilson said more indictments are expected from the
investigation. Hedges was indicted Wednesday and the companies on
Tuesday.
   Hedges' Washington-based attorney, Robert S. Bennett, said his
client was innocent and would defend himself vigorously.
   ``His decisions regarding his post-retirement activities were
done in full accordance with the law and with the knowledge and
understanding of the Air Force,'' Bennett said.
   J. Peter Hynes, a spokesman at Unisys' office in Blue Bell, Pa.,
said ``neither (Hedges) nor Sperry did anything wrong.''
   Unisys is the product of the 1986 merger of Sperry and Burroughs
Corp. Wilson said that is why both companies were named in the
indictment.
   A statement released by Unisys said the company ``was
disappointed that, after more than three years of cooperation with
the government, an indictment would be brought relating to the
alleged falseness of one invoice of a predecessor company.''
   Al Agricola, an assistant U.S. attorney handling the case, said
investigators had not determined whether Sperry might have received
favorable treatment in exchange for a consulting job Hedges took
after he left the service in August 1984.
   ``Under the statute, it didn't have to. Just the conflict being
there is required,'' said Agricola.
   In June 1984, Hedges signed a $75,000 consulting contract with
Sperry while on leave from the Air Force, Wilson said.
   Hynes confirmed that Hedges did work for Sperry after leaving
the Air Force. He said Hedges is still under contract with Unisys.
   Sperry was awarded the eight-year contract in January 1983.
Wilson said Hedges oversaw the program from Gunter Air Force Base
in Montgomery.
   Prosecutors said Unisys remains eligible for defense contracts,
although Col. Clarence Benham of the Air Force's investigations
division said the Pentagon could decide otherwise.
   If convicted, Sperry and Unisys each could face $50,000 fines
plus restitution to the Air Force. Hedges could be fined $10,000 if
convicted.

<HEAD>By The Associated Press</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Rain and snow fell in the Northeast today, raising the risk of
flooding in some areas because of fallen leaves clogging drains,
and gusty winds whipped through parts of the West.
   Nearly 3 inches of rain Friday night near Trenton, N.J., caused
Assunpink Creek to rise a half-foot below flood stage. But by early
this morning it crested and started to recede slowly.
   Wet snow in the Catskills of eastern New York state left 3
inches on the ground at Slide Mountain. Wet snow also descended on
parts of western and central New York state, and about an inch fell
in several Vermont towns, leaving some roads slippery.
   Strong winds blew through parts of Montana and Wyoming this
morning, with Great Falls, Mont., registering a gust of 43 mph, and
parts of the Flathead Valley of Montana up to 49 mph.
   Showers were scattered in the lower Ohio Valley, lower Michigan,
and the lower Great Lakes.
   Today's forecast called for rain and wind in New England, the
Middle Atlantic States, and the upper Ohio Valley; scattered
showers in north-central Montana and southwest Texas; and gusty
winds from the northern Rockies to western Nebraska and South
Dakota.
   High temperatures were predicted in the 40s from much of New
England to the northern Appalachians and the upper Great Lakes, 50s
and 60s from the middle Atlantic Coast to the central and southern
Appalachians, lower Ohio Valley, middle and upper Mississippi
Valley, northern Plains, northern Rockies, and Pacific Northwest;
80s in southern Florida, southern and central Texas; 85 to 95 in
the desert Southwest and California's inland valleys; and in the
70s in the rest of the nation.
   Temperatures at 3 a.m. EDT ranged from 23 degrees at
International Falls, Minn., to 78 at Phoenix and the Key West,
Fla., Naval Air Station.

<HEAD>Mubarak, Arafat Arrive In Jordan For Talks</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN RICE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>AMMAN, Jordan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Egypt's President Hosni Mubarak accompanied
PLO chairman Yasser Arafat to Jordan today on Arafat's first visit
to the kingdom since King Hussein severed links last July with the
Israeli-occupied West Bank.
   Hussein greeted the leaders at the Red Sea port of Aqaba, 175
miles south of the capital Amman, state Jordan Radio reported.
   Palestine Liberation Organization officials in Tunis, reached by
telephone from Cyprus, said Arafat and Hussein are trying to agree
on a formula for a confederation between Jordan and a future
independent Palestinian state.
   The Palestine National Council, a sort of parliament-in-exile,
is due to meet in Algeria on Nov. 12-14 to declare Palestinian
independence in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, which have been
wracked by a Palestinian uprising against Israeli rule since Dec. 8.
   ``Mubarak believes that it (the council) will be successful only
if it also states clearly what relations the Palestinian state will
have with Egypt, Israel and Jordan,'' one PLO official said.
   The radio said among those gathered for today's talks were Prime
Minister Zaid Rifai and Foreign Minister Taher Masri of Jordan,
Egyptian Foreign Minister Esmat Abdel-Meguid and three of Arafat's
senior aides, Hani al-Hassan, Mahmoud Abbas and Mohammed Milhem.
   Mubarak said in an interview published Thursday in the Egyptian
daily Al-Ahram that ``the next few days'' would witness ``a
consolidation'' of the Arab side in possible peace talks with
Israel.
   ``It is now for Israel to make up its mind and declare that it
opts for peace and is ready to accept the obligations peace
entails,'' he said.
   The tripartite summit comes a little more than a week before a
crucial Israeli election pitting the Labor Party, which favors
negotiating a partial withdrawal from the occupied territories,
against the Likud bloc, which opposes territorial compromise.
   Hussein said Thursday in an interview with the U.S. network
ABC-TV that a Likud victory would be ``an absolute disaster'' and
said the peace proposals of Labor leader Shimon Peres were a ``step
forward.''
   Arafat has not visited Jordan since the outbreak of pro-PLO
rioting in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, which once again propelled
the PLO to the center of the Middle East stage.
   In July, Hussein formally renounced his claims to the West Bank,
which Jordan ruled until Israeli occupation in 1967. The move
challenged the PLO to set up a Palestinian state in the occupied
lands.
   Hussein said he took the move in compliance with PLO wishes. PLO
officials generally welcomed the move but expressed irritation they
were not consulted in advance and some indicated suspicion Hussein
was trying to pressure the organization.
   ``It's no secret that there's distrust between the king and the
chairman (Arafat),'' said a PLO official from Tunis. ``But both
trust Mubarak. He can be a good guarantor.''
   PLO officials say the Palestinian National Council is likely to
declare independence for the occupied territories that include
Gaza, which was ruled by Egypt before its occupation in 1967. It
may also establish a provisional government that could take part in
peace talks.
   PLO officials say the council may formally, but implicitly,
endorse Israel's right to exist by accepting the 1947 United
Nations partition resolution that split Palestine into Arab and
Jewish states.
   At least 301 Palestinians and six Israelis have died in the
10-month uprising in the occupied territories.

<TEXT>
   U.S. Rep. Pat Swindall cannot tell a jury that
charges against him were politically motivated without a hearing
that could delay his perjury trial until after the Nov. 8 election,
a judge ruled.
   Swindall accused U.S. Attorney Robert Barr of scheming against
him for political gain on Friday. He also charged that the
government deliberately timed his 10-count indictment shortly
before the election.
   ``They wanted to make darn good and well (sure) that they got
the indictment before Nov. 8, 1988,'' Swindall said of prosecutors.
   But U.S. District Judge Robert Vining, who began screening
potential jurors Friday, ruled that Swindall may not raise his
allegations to the jury without a hearing that could delay his
trial until after the election.
   Barring such a delay, jury selection could be completed and
opening arguments in the trial could begin Monday.
   Swindall told Vining he would pursue the hearing process ``if it
doesn't unnecessarily delay the trial,'' but lead prosecutor Craig
Gillen immediately served notice he would seek time to prepare a
written response to any such move.
   Barr also said he plans to be on the West Coast next week for
legal conferences.
   Vining said Swindall would be free to raise the issue Monday
morning. Outside the courtroom, Swindall declined to comment on his
plans.
   Swindall, a two-term Republican representing the 4th
Congressional District of suburban Atlanta, faces Democrat Ben
Jones in the election.
   As he unsuccessfully sought to subpoena Barr to testify at the
trial, Swindall contended it is no accident that he was indicted
shortly before the election.
   He accused Barr _ who, like Swindall, is a Republican _ of
contacting officials in Vice President George Bush's presidential
campaign to assess the political impact of his investigation.
   One of those officials, Jay Morgan, deputy director of Bush's
Southern campaign, confirmed he talked with Barr on the day
Swindall was indicted but denied ever having discussed the Swindall
case with Barr.
   Barr declined comment, citing the pending trial.
   Later, Swindall said he would subpoena reporters for The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution and WSB-TV, two news organizations which this
summer obtained transcripts or videotapes of secretly recorded
meetings between Swindall and an undercover investigator.
   Swindall would not disclose what he wants to ask the reporters
on the witness stand, and questioned whether they can legally be
compelled to reveal the source of their stories about the recorded
conversations.
   Meanwhile, Charles LeChasney, described by prosecutors as the
middleman in the loan negotiations which led to the charges against
Swindall, pleaded guilty to five violations of federal currency
laws.
   LeChasney admitted to charges which do not mention Swindall, but
involve the money-laundering ``sting'' investigation that
eventually included a proposed $850,000 home mortgage loan for the
congressman.
   Paul Kish, LeChasney's lawyer, said he did not know if his
client would be called as a prosecution witness against Swindall.
   LeChasney was a participant in meetings with Swindall and an
undercover agent posing as a financier. The government contends
that the agent told Swindall his proposed loan from LeChasney would
be backed by illegal drug proceeds and that Swindall perjured
himself by denying that to a grand jury.
   Swindall has said LeChasney misled him and that he did not
intentionally deceive the grand jury.
   LeChasney could be sentenced to 30 years in prison and fined
$1.5 million, but under a plea agreement, federal prosecutors
agreed to recommend lesser sentences if he testifies truthfully in
all related cases. Five related charges will be dropped under the
plea bargain.
   LeChasney also agreed to repay $17,500 in government funds which
he had converted to his own use.

   No courtroom reunions were planned to
mark the anniversary of one of the nation's longest trials. But
jurors in the case, which involved less than a teaspoon of dioxin,
look back a year ago today and sigh with relief.
   ``I don't think I'll ever forget when it started and when it
ended _ especially when it ended,'' said Garry Cumer of East St.
Louis, a 39-year-old telephone technician who served as jury
foreman in the case known as Kemner vs. Monsanto.
   ``The guys at work tease me,'' he said. ``They call me the
lawyer.''
   After nearly four years of testimony and 38 days of
deliberation, the jury decided on Oct. 22, 1987, that the St.
Louis-based Monsanto Co. owed more than $16 million to 65 people in
Sturgeon, Mo., because of a chemical spill in 1979 during a train
derailment.
   Barbara McCann, who was dismissed from the jury just 45 minutes
before it got the case, said she remains bitter.
   Mrs. McCann, 50, was dismissed by St. Clair County Judge Richard
Goldenhersh for a conflict of interest after being part of the jury
for more than three years.
   ``I hold a grudge,'' said the mother of five, who works as a
sales clerk. ``And I still get teary-eyed when I think about it _
and I will for years.''
   The panel awarded the plaintiffs $16.2 million as punitive
damages, but gave 63 of them only $1 for compensatory damages. It
awarded two plaintiffs $14,500 each to compensate for property
damage.
   The Missouri residents said they were hurt when the train
derailed in Sturgeon and a 19,000-gallon load of wood preservative
containing less than a teaspoon of dioxin spilled along the tracks.
   Monsanto contended the amount of dioxin was too small to cause
the fatigue, headaches, joint pains, high blood pressure, nausea
and other ills claimed by the plaintiffs.
   Dioxin, an unwanted byproduct created during the manufacture of
some herbicides and pesticides, is known to cause brain, heart and
genetic damage in laboratory animals. The health risk to humans
remains subject to debate.
   The case, which generated 113,000 pages of court records alone,
is on appeal, said Monsanto attorney David Snively. Attorneys on
both sides agreed it would take another year, possibly two, before
the case is settled.
   ``If I had to do it again, I'd try to get out of it,'' Mrs.
McCann said. ``I don't think anything should go that long.''
   Jerome Seigfried of Mexico, Mo., who represented the plaintiffs
with attorney Rex Carr of Belleville, called his participation ``a
very interesting experience.''
   He said he had no regrets about taking the case, tried in
Illinois because Monsanto manufactured the wood preservative at its
Sauget plant. ``It was part of the job,'' he said. ``It's what I
do.''
   But like the jurors, Snively breathed a sign of relief that the
trial phase was over.
   The length of the trial was ``physically tough on everybody _
the stress, the fatigue,'' Snively said. ``After it's over,
everybody tends to gain a little bit of weight.
   ``It's just good to see your kids and family on a regular
basis,'' he said.

   Hundreds of police officers attended separate
funerals for two Detroit officers who were killed as they tried to
arrest a barricaded gunman.
   Officer Frank Walls, 39, was eulogized Friday in a service at
Verheyden Funeral Home in Grosse Pointe Park. His remains were to
be cremated.
   About 100 police cars joined a funeral procession later Friday
for Lt. James Schmit, 41, who was buried at St. Charles Cemetery in
Newport.
   The officers were shot about five hours apart Monday as police
tried to flush out Charles Knowles, a 50-year-old described as
having a history of mental problems.
   ``We've lost two brothers. These deaths bring a special kind of
pain,'' Detroit Police Chief William Hart said before the funerals.
``It's a pain you never get used to, and it's a pain that never,
ever goes away.''
   The standoff with Knowles ended when he was fatally shot by
other officers. Schmit and Walls were the first Detroit officers
slain this year.

   President Corazon Aquino today
welcomed the indictment of Ferdinand Marcos on U.S. racketeering
charges, saying it would hasten recovery of the billions of dollars
plundered during his 20-year rule.
   Mrs. Aquino, in a statement, said she hopes the prosecution in
New York of her predecessor will serve as a deterrent to other
dictators who steal from their countries and then seek asylum
abroad.
   ``This (indictment) is certainly welcome news in the Philippines
and I commend this evident commitment to the rule of law abroad,''
Mrs. Aquino said.
   Marcos has been living in Honolulu since he fled the country
during the February 1986 civilian-military revolt that swept Mrs.
Aquino to power. President Reagan invited Marcos to take up
residence in the United States.
   Marcos claims in a lawsuit filed in Honolulu that he was
deceived into leaving the country against his will.
   Marcos and his wife, Imelda, are restricted to the island of
Oahu because of his reported attempt last year to return to the
Philippines. U.S. officials are honoring a Philippine government
request that he not be allowed to return.
   On Friday, the U.S. government indicted former President Marcos,
his wife and eight associates on charges of racketeering. They
could face 20-year prison sentences if found guilty.
   Marcos was the highest-ranking former foreign official indicted
in the United States.
   The charges alleged that between September 1972, when Marcos
declared martial law in the Philippines, and 1986, the Marcoses
amassed $103 million through embezzlement, theft, bribes and
kickbacks.
   According to the indictment, the Marcoses illegally funneled the
money through secret bank accounts in Switzerland, Hong Kong and
the United States and then used the money to buy valuable New York
properties.
   ``I hope that this and other similar efforts undertaken in other
countries to investigate the crimes of the Marcoses will lead to
the early recovery of the stolen assets that rightfully belong to
the Filipino people,'' Mrs. Aquino said.
   Mrs. Aquino's government has accused the Marcoses of stealing up
to $10 billion in public and private assets during Marcos' rule.
Mrs. Aquino formed the five-member Presidential Commission on Good
Government to try to recover the wealth and bring the Marcoses to
trial.
   The commission's former chairman, Ramon Diaz, said the U.S.
trial will save the Philippines time in efforts to recover assets.
``A lot of evidence that we would have to present before the U.S.
courts (to recover U.S. property) will already have been
presented,'' he said.
   In Bern, Swiss authorities have ordered records on some Swiss
financial transactions made by Marcos, saying those records can be
turned over to the United States.
   The Aquino government alleges that Marcos and his associates
stashed much of their funds in Swiss banks. Swiss authorities put
that figure at at least $1 billion.
   But Beat von Rechenberg, Marcos' Swiss lawyer, said he would
``most probably'' file an appeal with the Federal Tribunal,
Switzerland's Supreme Court.

   A girl was missing today after an Italian
freighter rammed a Greek cruise ship carrying 475 British students
and teachers, causing the cruise ship to sink, officials said. Two
seamen were killed.
   At least 64 people, including 30 students, were injured Friday
evening when the Adige freighter tore a gaping hole in the
6,300-ton Jupiter, which was steaming out of Piraeus harbor. Two
remained hospitalized today.
   Screaming children jumped from the listing ship into oil-covered
waters before the vessel sank less than an hour after the collision.
   A British Embassy official said the 14-year-old girl, Vivienne
Barley, was the only person still unaccounted for.
   A Merchant Marine Ministry official said radio appeals were
broadcast ``for anyone who may have seen her or picked her up to
contact us.''
   Frogmen and Coast Guard officials searched the area where the
Epirotiki Lines cruise ship sank less than a mile from Piraeus
harbor on the start of an eight-day educational cruise.
   ``The Italian ship tore a huge hole below the waterline, almost
splitting the Jupiter in two ... no wonder it sank in less than an
hour,'' said Spyros Mavrikis, an Epirotiki spokesman.
   Greek Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou, looking fit and well
after major heart surgery in London, flew to Athens today promising
a full investigation into the collision.
   At the time of the accident, the 415 teen-agers and their 60
teachers and helpers were on a trip to Greek islands and ports in
Egypt, Israel and Turkey.
   ``I was sitting with my friends in the lounge when we looked out
of the window and saw this ship coming straight towards us,'' said
14-year-old Kirsty Spurling, a pupil at the Sacred Heart of Mary
convent school at Havering in Essex county, England.
   ``We all screamed, there was a bang and the boat began to tilt
... I said a prayer,'' she said.
   As the cruise ship listed, screaming youngster jumped overboard
into the oily waters of Athens' main port. Others were thrown into
the sea by the force of the swell as the vessel sank.
   Dozens of Coast Guard launches and tug-boats rushed to the
rescue, but there were conflicting views as to how the survivors
managed to escape the vessel.
   ``The ship tilted at a terrible angle and very quickly. We were
all told to get out of the boat and climb up as high as we could,''
said Grahame Addecott, an English teacher at the Sacred Heart of
Mary school.
   ``On deck we were told to hang onto the rails and it seemed
forever until the crew helped us down into the rescue boat ... some
of my girls were very frightened,'' he said.
   Some students said crew members chose to abandon ship rather
than help the students into boats.
   ``The crew all got out leaving us there to look after
ourselves,'' said Stephanie Stavrou, 16, from Dunster Close
Romford. ``I didn't see any of the crew after we got out on deck.''
   Weeping, oil-splattered children and teachers clung to each
other as they boarded buses bound for hospitals in the Piraeus
area. Four passengers were reported to have fractures and one
underwent surgery for abdominal injuries, British Embassy officials
said.
   The rest of the group was taken aboard another Epirotiki Lines
cruise ship berthed in Piraeus _ the Pegasus _ for the night.
   The tour company Schools Abroad, which coordinated the trip for
13 schools across England, said charter jets were flying the group
home today. The first of four planes with 140 people aboard, some
still wrapped in blankets, took off from Athens Airport just before
1 p.m.
   Merchant Marine Ministry officials identified the two dead
seamen as Vassilis Psomas, 22, and Athanasios Golemotis, both from
the Jupiter's 120-member crew. Golemotis' age was not available.
   Merchant Marine Minister Evangelos Yannopoulos said the Italian
ship was to blame and its skipper, Capt. Flavio Caminale, was
arrested on manslaughter charges.
   The Adige, a container ship owned by Sicula Oceanica Spa, Siosa
Line, of Palermo, Sicily, was transporting automobiles to Piraeus
and hit the Jupiter while maneuvering toward the dock.

   Iraq announced today it will release 25
Iranian prisoners of war in accordance with a U.N. cease-fire
resolution, the official Iraqi News Agency said.
   The agency, monitored in Nicosia, quoted an unidentified
spokesman of the Iraqi Foreign Ministry as saying the unilateral
decision was relayed to the International Committee of the Red
Cross.
   The spokesman was quoted as saying the Red Cross was asked to
disptach a delegation to Iraq ``to take the neccessary measures to
repatriate the POWs.''
   On Thursday, Iran rejected an Iraqi plan for repatriating
prisoners of war from the eight-year Persian Gulf conflict and said
Iraq must accept the U.N. plan for ending the war before prisoner
exchanges could start.
   The Iraqi spokesman was quoted as saying with the latest batch,
the total number of sick and aging Iranian prisoners released by
Iraq ``for purely humanitarian reasons, with no political
conditions attached'' reached 645.
   He called on Iran to reciprocate, adding Iran ``would be held
fully responsible for any delay in ending the sufferings of the
POWs and their families,'' the news agency reported.
   He said Iran ``has all along dealt with the POWs issue as a
political one, in order to exploit it for the puposes of Iran's
expansionist policies.''
   According to the Red Cross, Iran has 50,182 prisoners and Iraq
has 19,284 prisoners. But U.N. officials and diplomats in Iran and
Iraq believe Iran holds 60,000 to 70,000 POWs and Iraq 30,000 to
50,000.
   U.N. Resolution 598 calls for an immediate cease-fire,
withdrawal of troops to internationally recognized boundaries and
the exchange of prisoners.
   Iraq this week proposed to the International Red Cross and U.N.
Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar that repatriation of
prisoners should begin on humanitarian grounds if Iran reciprocates.
   But Iraq also made it clear its offer was unrelated to peace
negotiations, which stalled five days after a cease-fire was
declared on Aug. 20.
   The peace talks have deadlocked over Iraq's insistence that the
disputed Shatt-al-Arab waterway, which forms its southern border
with Iran, should be cleared of silt and ships sunk early in the
war.
   Iran has rejected the dredging demand, saying it is a secondary
issue that can be settled later in the negotiations.

   Israeli warplanes flew over the ancient
city of Baalbek in east Lebanon, police said today, fueling fears
of an imminent attack on the main stronghold of pro-Iranian
extremists.
   The rare nighttime overflights came hours after Israeli
fighter-bombers attacked other Palestinian and pro-Iranian
guerrilla bases to avenge the killing Wednesday of seven Israeli
soldiers in a suicide car bombing.
   Shiite Moslem kidnappers holding at least two American hostages
charged Friday that the United States gave advance approval to
Israel to strike at the guerrilla strongholds, and the kidnappers
threatened to harm the hostages.
   Nabih Berri, a Shiite Moslem leader, said today that the
kidnappers of the hostages committed an ``unforgivable crime'' by
threatening to harm them.
   Berri, who heads the mainstream Shiite Amal militia, spoke in an
interview with The Associated Press. Berri's Syrian-backed militia
has been locked in a fierce struggle with pro-Iranian
fundamentalists for mastery of the Shiite community, and,
therefore, has no influence on the kidnappers.
   Police in Lebanon said today that the death toll from the
Israeli air raids climbed to 16 when a wounded person died.
Thirty-four were hurt in the attack.
   Police said sonic booms jolted the population of Baalbek out of
their beds late Friday night and early this morning when the
Israeli jets crashed the sound barrier in several low-altitude runs
over Baalbek.
   ``They've seldom done such a thing since the 1982 invasion,''
said a police spokesman. ``People are afraid their city will be the
next target for Israel's retaliation to the suicide bombing.''
   Baalbek is controlled by the Iranian-backed fundamentalist group
that is believed to be the umbrella for kidnappers of the 14
foreigners in Lebanon.
   An estimated 3,000 Iranian Revolutionary Guards are based at the
Sheik Abdullah barracks on a hilltop overlooking the city that
harbors ancient Roman ruins.
   Hezbollah said victims of Israel's retaliatory raid were to be
buried today in a mass funeral in the Bekaa valley town of Mashgara.
   The air raids hit positions near Mashgara and the port city of
Sidon. Israeli officials often charge that Hezbollah and the PLO
cooperate in guerrilla warfare against Israeli troops and allied
militiamen in south Lebanon.
   Israel pulled most of its army from south Lebanon in June 1985
after a three-year occupation and carved out the six-to-10-mile
security zone to prevent guerrilla infiltration into its northern
settlements.
   Israel had vowed to retaliate for Wednesday's bombing, the
deadliest attack against Israelis in south Lebanon in 2{ years.
   ``Committing this stupidity and this attack shall not pass
without a punishment,'' said a typewritten statement in Arabic
signed Friday by Islamic Jihad, the pro-Iranian faction holding
American journalist Terry Anderson and educator Thomas Sutherland.
   The statement, delivered to the independent Beirut newspaper
An-Nahar hours after the attack, praised the Shiite Moslem suicide
car bomber.
   Anderson, 40, chief Middle East correspondent for The Associated
Press, was abducted in Moslem west Beirut on March 16, 1985.
   Sutherland, 56, of Fort Collins, Colo., was acting dean of
agriculture at the American University of Beirut when he was
abducted on June 9, 1985.
   Anderson and Sutherland are among nine Americans believed held
by pro-Iranian extremist factions linked to Hezbollah.
   The statement accused the U.S. administration of giving Israel
advance approval to attack Palestinian and Hezbollah guerrillas in
Lebanon. The pro-Iranian Hezbollah, or Party of God, claimed
responsibility for the suicide bombing.
   Sheik Fadlallah, considered to be Hezbollah's spiritual leader,
said he would do his best to protect the hostages.
   ``We continue to respect our previous commitments to defend
human rights in order to see these hostages free and safe as soon
as possible,'' he said.
   In Cadiz, Ky., Anderson's sister, Peggy Say, asked his captors
to ``recognize that Terry Anderson is totally innocent and has
never been involved in the continuing Middle East strife except as
a captive for 3{ years.''
   Friday's statement was the first since Aug. 18, when the group
said none of its hostages would be released soon.

   An FBI agent has been fired after being arrested
for selling a small amount of cocaine, a bureau spokesman says.
   Roderick Kimmons, 36, of Chicago, is accused of selling a
quarter-gram of cocaine to an undercover agent for $40 at a
nightclub Thursday, and a gram of the drug to a cooperating witness
for $100, FBI spokesman Bob Scigalski said.
   ``We heard rumors last week that he had been selling cocaine,''
said agent James McKenzie. ``When we hear something like that, we
make it a priority'' to make an arrest.
   Kimmons, an eight-year veteran, was arrested Friday and charged
with felony possession and distribution of a controlled substance,
and immediately dismissed, Scigalski said.
   Kimmons posted a $4,500 recognizance bond after arraignment. He
faces a maximum 20-year prison term if convicted.

   A student was taken into custody
after a pipe bomb exploded in a high school restroom and four other
bombs were found in lockers, authorities said.
   No one was hurt in the blast Friday but the boys' restroom was
extensively damaged, said Ventura County Sheriff's Sgt. Will Howe.
   The student, not identified because of his age, led deputies to
the other bombs after students and school officials said he might
be involved, Howe said.
   Most students at Newbury Park High School were attending a
homecoming rally when the explosion occurred and were not near the
restroom, Howe said.
   Principal Florence Lawyer said she had no idea why the bombs
were planted, but believes it was an isolated incident.
   Students were sent home after the blast.

   A holiday display that features a nativity
scene and Hanukkah menorah may be displayed on the city hall lawn
because it creates ``no real danger of establishing a state
church,'' a federal judge has ruled.
   The American Civil Liberties Union, which opposes the display,
says it will appeal Thursday's ruling but will await the U.S.
Supreme Court's decision on a similar case involving the city of
Pittsburgh.
   The ACLU contends the display contains religious symbols and
violates the First Amendment's separation of church and state.
   U.S. District Court Judge James Harvey ruled that Warren's
Christmas display does not endorse a particular religion and
``poses no real danger of establishing a state church as prohibited
by the First Amendment.''
   In December, U.S. District Judge Lawrence Zatkoff denied a
motion by the ACLU to remove the display, saying he found the
display secular in nature. Besides the creche and the menorah, the
display contains large candles and soldiers and incorporates the
city's Vietnam memorial.

   Chinese newspapers published a reader's letter
urging leader Deng Xiaoping to launch an anti-smoking campaign by
kicking the habit himself, a Hong Kong newspaper reported Saturday.
   Policeman Zhang Jianxin wrote that by smoking in public, Deng
encouraged thousands of Chinese to keep smoking, the independent
Chinese-language Ming Pao reported, quoting the Hong Kong China
News Service.
   The news agency was quoted as saying China's Health Newspaper
gave the letter prominent play and that it also ran in the Hygiene
Newspaper. Chinese media traditionally do not criticize China's
leaders.
   Zhang, of the northwest Xinjiang province, said he hoped Deng
will quit for his and the Chinese peoples' health.
   The agency said China produced 40 billion packs of cigarettes
annually and 250 million people smoke. It said of the 32,000 fires
last year, more than half were caused by careless smokers.

Gras time.
   As Bacchus XXI, Crystal will lead a parade of about 25 outsize

said Dr. Mervin Trail, another official in the krewe, as the old
New Orleans societies that sponsor Mardi Gras events are known.
   Crystal's selection continues Bacchus' tradition of celebrity

parade in 1969. Crystal's predecessors include Lorne Greene, Jackie
Gleason, Kirk Douglas, Charlton Heston, Perry Como and Henry

   Children's Defense Fund founder Marian Wright
Edelman delivered a disturbing report of the status of the nation's
youth as she accepted the third annual Albert Schweitzer Prize for
Humanitarianism.
   Noting that 13 million American children live in poverty and
that untold millions of more affluent children live in ``spiritual
poverty,'' Mrs. Edelman warned Friday that ``if we continue to
stand for it, our national future is damned.''
   Mrs. Edelman recalled her own upbringing as a black child in the
segregated South. ``We buried children who died from poverty,'' she
said. ``And I can't stand it that we still do.''
   Mrs. Edelman, the first black woman admitted to the Mississippi
bar, founded the Washington Research Project in 1968. It became the
Children's Defense Fund in 1973. The organization acts on behalf of
children, particularly disadvantaged children, through such things
as public education and lobbying.
   The $10,000 Schweitzer prize is sponsored by the Alexander von
Humboldt Foundation for distinguished achievement in the service of
humanity in the United States.

   Academy Award-winning actor Jack Lemmon,
whose efforts on behalf of human rights and world peace have
influenced several of the movie roles he's accepted, has been
honored with the Ralph Bunche Peace Award.
   Lemmon received the award, named for the American Nobel Peace
Prize winner, Friday from Mayor Tom Bradley and actress Jean
Stapleton, who is the honorary chairwoman for United Nations Day.
   ``I've been able to find material that would entertain but would
also move beyond entertainment,'' Lemmon said. ``Whatever the point
of view, it was not as important to have the audience agree with it
but to move it to stop and think.''
   Long known in Hollywood for his political advocacy, Lemmon has
appeared in such movies as ``The China Syndrome,'' about the
dangers of nuclear power, and ``Missing,'' about an American
political activist killed in Chile. He won a best actor Academy
Award for his role in ``Save the Tiger'' and a best-supporting
actor award for ``Mr. Roberts.''
   Bunche won the Nobel Prize in 1950 for his work on the U.N.
Palestine Commission. Lemmon called him ``one of the handful of
true heroes to me.''

to fight the disease.
   Nick Walters and his sister, April, participated in a Juveniles
Diabetes Foundation walkathon this month. They received up to
$3,300 in pledges, but had been able to collect only about $2,700.
   Nick remembered seeing Asner on a diabetes telethon last year

   Asner, who portrayed Lou Grant on ``The Mary Tyler Moore Show''

are common.
   ``At that moment (of making the pledge), they're so swept into

   Kidley Street seems too quiet to
be a battleground.
   But Republican George Bush and Democrat Michael Dukakis are
skirmishing there and throughout Macomb County and throughout the
nation for the votes of so-called Reagan Democrats.
   The county's predominantly white, middle-class voters bolted to
Ronald Reagan in 1980 and 1984 while they supported Democratic
candidates on most of the ballot _ as did many Democrats elsewhere
in the country.
   Macomb is ``an absolute 100 percent predictor of how Michigan's
going to vote,'' said Jay Neel, whom the Democratic National
Committee sent here in August to run a storefront Dukakis campaign
office in St. Clair Shores. ``And without Michigan, we're not going
to win.''
   Terry Gilsenan of Warren, a Republican district chairman,
agrees. ``If you don't carry (Macomb) county, you don't carry the
state,'' he said.
   Bordering predominantly black Detroit on the north and mainly
white, affluent Oakland County on the east, Macomb and its 700,000
residents are what Neel calls ``a microcosm of the country.''
   Auto industry factories and rows of bungalow houses crowd Eight
Mile Road, the county's southern border. Farther north are large
homes, apartment buildings, condominiums and newer factories, and
beyond them are mobile home parks and new subdivisions. A dwindling
number of farms and small towns are found in Macomb's northernmost
reaches.
   On Kidley Street, the middle-class, dual-income Zaleski and
Tremaine families are linked by their sons, Jason Zaleski and John
Tremaine, who are pals at Adlai Stevenson High School. But their
parents' divergent political leanings reflect the challenge facing
Bush and Dukakis.
   ``I don't think my luck has increased through the Republican
administrations,'' said Stanley Zaleski, a carpenter who voted for
Democrats Jimmy Carter in 1980 and Walter Mondale in 1984.
   ``I don't think I've made many great strides,'' he said. ``I've
got to run like hell just to keep up with things.''
   Zaleski plans to cast an unenthusiastic vote for Dukakis. ``He's
the lesser of two evils. The Democrats at least do try to help the
working man,'' he explains.
   Theresa Tremaine, a computer programmer, describes herself as a
lukewarm Democrat who voted for Carter in 1980 but switched to
Reagan in 1984 and plans to vote this time for Bush.
   If Mrs. Tremaine is a Reagan Democrat, the phenomenon she
represents goes back further than Reagan. The last Democratic
presidential candidate to carry Macomb County was Hubert Humphrey
in 1968. Richard Nixon won the county and state by comfortable
margins in 1972 and Gerald Ford did the same in 1976.
   Dukakis isn't writing off Macomb County partly because
otherwise, it's a staunch Democratic stronghold. Two of its three
House members, 11 of its 12 state legislators and 24 of its 25
county commissioners are Democrats.
   ``They were conservative Democrats long before Reagan came
along,'' said Kirby Holmes, a former GOP state legislator from
Utica. ``They just didn't like the presidential candidates that the
national party put forth.''
   Anti-tax sentiment is strong in Macomb. In the early 1980s,
voters recalled a state legislator who voted to raise Michigan's
income tax.
   Abortion is a touchy issue among its Roman Catholics, as are
U.S.-Soviet relationships among its Eastern European ethnic groups
and crime among auto workers who led the white flight from Detroit
to the suburbs after the city's 1967 race riots.
   Dukakis' task is to persuade Macomb's Reagan Democrats that he
is less liberal than past Democratic presidential nominees George
McGovern, Carter and Mondale, and that the gains Reagan boasts have
been illusory for them.
   The unemployment rate in Macomb County is running about 6.8
percent, somewhat higher than the national rate of 5.6 percent in
August.
   Recent local polls indicate that only one in five Macomb
Democrats who voted for Reagan in 1984 might vote for Bush in
November.
   Dukakis made a highly publicized visit Sept. 13 to a General
Dynamics Corp. factory in Sterling Heights, where he rode in an M-1
tank to underscore a speech stressing his commitment to a strong
U.S. military.
   Bush campaigned here in August and September, and Reagan
campaigned for his vice president earlier this month in Sterling
Heights, not far from the tank facility.
   Both Bush and Dukakis have played to Macomb's conservative
Democrats by portraying themselves as defenders of family values
and tough on crime, drugs and communism.
   ``It's a patriotic area,'' Gilsenan said. ``People were flying
the flag before it became popular again.''
   The first wave of newcomers to Macomb County after World War II
were mainly Catholics from Detroit who brought along their
Democratic loyalties that were nurtured by President Roosevelt and
the trade unions.
   ``The people who moved up into Macomb County in the 50s and 60s
came of age in the 30s and 40s and saved up enough to buy a home in
the suburbs,'' said state Sen. Doug Carl of Utica, the county's
only Republican in the state Legislature. ``But that was a
different generation.''
   Those older Democrats ``have retired to cottages up North, to
mobile homes in Florida or died off,'' said Carl, who is running
against liberal Rep. David Bonior, D-Mich., this year. ``Those
people are being supplanted by younger people ... concerned they'll
be able to pursue the same middle-class lifestyle as their
parents.''
   Neel said Dukakis' centrist message could finally end local
Democrats' eight-year infatuation with Reagan.
   In 1980, he said, ``Reagan hit it at the right time at the right
place. If he'd run against a John F. Kennedy, a Lyndon Johnson, a
Hubert Humphrey, he would have got his clock cleaned.''

   Michael Dukakis was at a pig farm, sitting on
a bale of hay and talking about rural America while Democratic Rep.
Richard Durbin stood a few feet away saying the presidential
candidate was going about things all wrong.
   With the election nearing, Dukakis' campaign message was
``completely overshadowed'' by George Bush's sharply critical
television commercials, Durbin said. His advice to his party's
candidate was that the uphill race could still be won, but Dukakis
needed above all to ``come out and be hard-hitting and forceful.''
   Now, Durbin and other Democrats with the same message have
gotten their wish.
   Over the next few days, Dukakis refined his new Populist
campaign rhetoric to its essentials, waved GOP brochures in the
autumn air with a denunciation that they were ``political garbage''
and charged in a new television commercial that Bush's own ads were
``full of lies, and he knows it.''
   In a television message Saturday night, Dukakis was accusing
Bush of a campaign ``of fear and of smear'' and he was vowing to
``fight my heart out for the things I believe in.''
   The polls say George Bush is on the verge of sweeping into the
White House in next month's election. But like trailing candidates
everywhere, Dukakis is making a final determined effort to salvage
his candidacy.
   ``This is 18 months and 450,000 miles. He's not giving up now,''
said Nick Metropoulos, the man who travels everywhere with the
governor.
   Yet even as Dukakis readied his charge, the GOP vice
presidential candidate was scoffing at the man from Massachusetts.
``Michael Dukakis is no Harry Truman,'' said Dan Quayle, referring
to the political patron saint of the underdog.
   The sharpened rhetoric and new commercials were not the only
evidence of Dukakis' last campaign stand. He also stepped up the
pace of campaigning at the same time Bush was cutting back on his.
And Dukakis seemed to accepting every TV interview offer that came
his way.
   Yet from Durbin's vantage point in rural Illinois to other party
officials around the country, Democrats say Dukakis needs
excitement as much as issues. Thus Michigan Gov. Jim Blanchard
twice last week leapt to his feet during rallies and pumped his
fists in the air like a cheerleader, trying to ignite the crowd and
the candidate.
   Democrats do not minimize the difficulties.
   Bush's lead in the national public opinion polls ranges from
seven points to 17, although Dukakis' own polls show it below 10.
Bush appears to have an overwhelming advantage in the Electoral
College, as well, with a seemingly solid foundation of Southern and
Rocky Mountain states.
   Dukakis' operatives have had well-publicized squabbles with
Democratic regulars from coast to coast. Dukakis' performance in
the second presidential debate on Oct. 13 left some of his aides
demoralized.
   Adviser Donna Brazile resigned last week after making personal
remarks about Bush that brought an apology from Dukakis.
   And for weeks, Durbin told reporters, Dukakis ``had his
character assailed and in some quarters destroyed by the Bush
negative advertising.'' Said Georgia Sen. Sam Nunn, ``I wouldn't
have been a punching bag on some of those issues.''
   But Dukakis aides also have insisted for weeks that if they
could break through Bush's persuasive campaign attacks the voters
would swing behind their man on the strength of his promise to
stand up for jobs, tougher trade competition, health care and
education.
   ``George Bush doesn't want this campaign to be about his record
and that's why he's put up a campaign of labels and fog and
deceptions,'' said Dukakis aide Leslie Dach.
   The new Dukakis commercials are designed to counter
advertisements the vice president has used.
   One Bush ad shows a revolving door with prisoners moving
through, and talks of the former Massachusetts furlough program and
a prisoner who failed to return from a weekend pass and later
brutalized a man and his wife.
   Dukakis' TV reply says that Bush ``won't talk about all the
thousands of drug kingpins furloughed from federal prisons while he
led the war on drugs,'' including one who raped and murdered a
pregnant woman of two. ``George Bush has taken a furlough from the
truth,'' the ad says.
   The second one is meant to counter a Bush ad that shows Dukakis
in a tank and contends the governor opposes several weapons. The
Dukakis counter-ad shows Dukakis watching the Bush commercial, then
clicking the television off and saying he favors the weapons.
   ``I'm fed up with it. Haven't seen anything like it in 25 years
of public life, George Bush's negative TV ads, distorting my
record, full of lies, and he knows it,'' he says.
   That commercial is similar to a script Durbin handed a Dukakis
aide last week, although the congressman disclaims any credit for
Dukakis' aggressive new style.
   One Dukakis aide said the governor began fighting back a few
weeks ago, after Republicans started using campaigning by Cliff
Barnes, who along with his fiance was attacked by Willie Horton,
the now nationally known escapee from a Massachusetts furlough
program.
   The ads were the most dramatic element of Dukakis' stretch drive
this week, but not the only one.
   He spent one day condemning Republican campaign brochures,
including one that said Dukakis had the support of murderers,
rapists and drug dealers.
   The next day, Dukakis compared Bush's campaign to Watergate and
said ``truth was the first casualty'' in both.
   All the while, he honed his rhetoric.
   ``George Bush wants to help the people who already have it made.
I want to make every American a full shareholder in the American
dream,'' he said.
   A few hours later, the line was refined: ``George Bush wants to
help the people who already have it made. I want to help every
American family make it.''
   A few days later, criticizing Bush's tax cut as favoring the
wealthy, he said simply, ``He's on their side. I'm on yours.''

<HEAD>Charge Of Alcohol Use At Atomic Plant Shows Need For NRC Rule,
Lawmaker Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTOPHER CALLAHAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A new allegation of alcohol abuse at a nuclear
power plant illustrates the need for strict federal regulations to
detect substance abuse at atomic reactors, says the chairman of a
House investigations subcommittee.
   ``It is the (Nuclear Regulatory Commission's) responsibility to
protect against drug and alcohol abuse,'' said Rep. Sam Gejdenson,
D-Conn., chairman of the House Interior and Insular Affairs
subcommittee on investigations and oversight. ``It is not enough
for the NRC to leave it to the industry to regulate itself.''
   Gejdenson, who has held a series of hearings on the question of
substance abuse at nuclear plants, wants the NRC to issue stiff
regulations on drug and alcohol abuse instead of leaving
regulations up to individual utilities.
   The commission proposed a new rule last month that would require
reactor owners to conduct random drug tests, test employees for
drugs based on cause, report drug use to the NRC and mandate
personnel sanctions. But the rule would leave alcohol detection and
enforcement up to ``the prudent judgment of each utility.''
   Commission officials say no final decision has been made on the
proposed regulation.
   In latest allegation of substance abuse at an atomic reactor,
Gejdenson provided The Associated Press with an NRC document
outlining an accusation made by an employee at the Clinton Power
Station in Clinton, Ill., against a senior plant manager.
   The employee, according to the report, told a superior that the
manager had alcohol on his breath and stumbled as he passed through
a radiation-detecting device on the night of Oct. 10.
   But officials at Illinois Power Co., operator of the reactor,
said the company hired a private investigator the next day who
concluded several days later that there was no evidence of alcohol
abuse.
   Stephen Perry, assistant vice president at the plant, defended
the utility's internal substance abuse program.
   In a telephone interview Friday, Perry said the employee, who
was charged with checking for fires at the reactor, reported his
accusation to a superior. The shift supervisor talked to the senior
manager ``at length'' and decided there was no evidence of alcohol.
   Perry said under the company's internal regulations, the manager
could have been ordered to take a blood test if the supervisor
found cause. He said such blood tests have been ordered in the past.
   The subsequent investigation turned up no evidence to
corroborate the alcohol charge, he said.
   But Gejdenson, who wrote a letter to NRC Chairman Lando W. Zech
Jr. last week urging a strict rule on both alcohol and drugs, and a
top Gejdenson aide said it is wrong to rely on self-policing and
criticized the NRC for not conducting its own investigation.
   ``At the very least you want the NRC to do is find out what
happened,'' said subcommittee investigator John Scheibel. ``The NRC
can't take the trouble to send somebody out there?
   ``The NRC is in a position of public trust, and at the very
least the public can expect the NRC to act cautiously and not just
accept the word of the person who said, `No, there was no
problem','' he said.
   Commission spokesman Frank Ingram said the NRC was ``looking
into'' the allegation, but said he did not know to what extent.
Scheibel said he was told by NRC officials the agency is not
conducting a separate investigation.
   Scheibel noted that the senior manager in question was a higher
ranking official at the company than the shift supervisor who would
have had to order the blood test. He said that could be an
``inhibiting factor.''
   But plant officials said a thorough _ and independent _
investigation was conducted and that no other employees
corroborated the alcohol allegation.
   The Clinton report comes on the heels of a subcommittee hearing
earlier this month that focused on an allegation of alcohol abuse
against a plant manager at the Davis-Besse reactor near Toledo,
Ohio.

<HEAD>Icelandic Residents Vote On Ruff-erendum On Dog Ownership</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By AGUST ASGEIRSSON</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>REYKJAVIK, Iceland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Residents of Reykjavik are getting one
last chance to stop the capital from going to the dogs.
   This week, they vote on an experimental program relaxing a ban
on dogs in the city of 88,000. The weeklong referendum begins
Monday and asks voters to say whether the 4-year-old program has
been a success.
   City Hall banished dogs in 1924 following an outbreak of
dog-related disease. For 60 years it resisted attempts to overturn
the ban, despite ridicule from abroad and lurid stories about mass
slaughter of illicit dogs.
   In 1978, dog owners went to the Supreme Court in an unsuccessful
bid to have the ban declared unconstitutional. The issue made
headlines again when Albert Gudmundsson, then the finance minister,
threatened to emigrate unless he could keep his dog in Reykjavik.
   Compromise finally came in 1984 when City Hall, while keeping
the ban on the books, set up some exemptions and promised a
referendum after four years on how Reykavik and man's best friend
were getting along.
   ``We are of the opinion that the vote is not necessary because
of the good experience we've had in allowing conditional
dog-ownership,'' Mayor David Oddsson, who owns a German shepherd
named Tanni (Fang), recently told Morgunbladid, Iceland's main
newspaper.
   But nevertheless, the promised ballot box is being set up in the
city sports hall, and citizens will vote yes or no on the question:
``Do you think that the experimental dog rules have been
successful?''
   Oddsson said the vote is not binding but if there is an
overwhelming majority either way, then ``we must take notice of
that.''
   With opinion polls showing 2-1 support for the exemptions, dog
owners are confident.
   But one city official, Magnus Oskarsson, said voters are so
apathetic on the issue they may ignore the referendum and give
anti-dog forces a victory by default.
   Strict rules apply to Reykjavik's 850 registered dog owners.
Annual licenses cost $120, dogs must undergo an annual medical
checkup, and owners must have insurance.
   The city center is permanently out of bounds, and dogs must stay
out of public parks between 8 a.m. and 9 p.m. They cannot enter
public buildings, restaurants, children's playgrounds, barbershops,
prisons, cemeteries, morgues and buses. Leashes are always required.
   According to city veterinarian Oddur Runar Hjartarson, the ban
was imposed after dogs began transferring a dangerous sheep disease
to human beings.
   Hyatid disease, which once infected an estimated 20 percent of
Iceland's population, is caused by a worm that can cause blindness
in people and even death, Hjartarson said. Dogs picked up the
disease from eating the intestines of slaughtered sheep.
   The disease has since been eradicated and illegal dog ownership
has become rampant _ along with the lurid stories.
   ``There were all these stories in the foreign press about dogs
being caught and killed. It never happened. I recall perhaps one
example of a dog being impounded,'' Oskarsson said.
   Gudrun Gudjohnsen, president of the Dog-Breeding Association,
warns a new ban ``would be a big step backward'' and not likely to
be enforced.
   ``During the 60 years of the old ban, there were hundreds of
dogs in the capital. People ... ought to realize that it is far
better to have an effective monitoring and control system than
going back to a system of no control,'' she said.

   The difficulty of reaching a short-term
agreement under which the United States keeps its military bases in
the Philippines raises what was once an unthinkable notion _ an
eventual American pullout from Subic Bay Navy Base and Clark Air
Base.
   The agreement signed last week after six months of
sometimes-bitter negotiations covers only the use of the bases
until 1991, providing for $962 million in economic and military aid
for the Philippines over the next two years. It is a sharp
increase, but many Filipino politicians say it's far from enough.
   If the Americans are to remain beyond Sept. 30, 1991, the
negotiators probably will face difficulties which were only hinted
at in this year's talks, according to analysts.
   Fred Brown, a Southeast Asia scholar, said until the talks
brought to the fore the spectre of a U.S. pullout from the
Philippines, ``it was sort of an unthinkable, unmentionable
issue.'' As the talks were going on, both Secretary of State George
Shultz and Defense Secretary Frank Carlucci said the United States
could move its bases if the Philippines demanded too much.
   Brown, who is with the Carnegie Endowment for International
Peace, an independently funded think tank, predicted that if
nationalist forces continue to shape the debate in the Philippines
over the bases, negotiators for both sides will consider a phaseout
of the U.S. presence in the Philippines.
   The debate in the Philippines also will be affected by how well
the current agreement is implemented.
   The funds promised in the agreement, while falling short of the
annual $1.2 billion sought by the Philippines, are still
substantially higher than the U.S. aid appropriated by Congress in
previous years for use of the bases. And in light of the U.S.
budget crunch, the difference is significant.
   Sen. Bob Dole, leader of the Republican minority in the Senate,
raised a warning flag: ``Just how that money is going to be found
in a foreign operations budget already carved to the bone to meet
other base rights and peace-keeping commitments is not readily
apparent to this senator.''
   But an influential legislative aide who spoke only on condition
of anonymity said that there is enough bipartisan support for the
Philippines so that ``there are ways the money could be found.'' He
conceded this would mean short-changing other aid recipients or
wrangling with the Defense Department for some of its money. ``It
won't be easy,'' he said.
   Another struggle is expected over a U.S. contribution to a $5
billion multinational aid program to help ease the Philippines' $28
billion debt. Although the package is unrelated, resolution of the
base pact was expected to boost support in Congress for the
international initiative.
   The United States is spearheading the effort, although Japan
will foot most of the bill.
   The international aid package, if it is approved and funded,
``will grant legitimacy'' to the U.S.-Philippine bases agreement in
the eyes of the Filipino public and leadership, said John Bresnan,
a senior research associate at the School of East Asia of Columbia
University.
   So far, President Corazon Aquino is facing a hard time selling
the new agreement to intellectuals and Manila's urban middle class,
who accuse her government of selling out their country's
sovereignty.
   But some analysts said that if Mrs. Aquino wants the Americans
to stay, she must bring the debate before the broad public and take
a position herself.
   ``She has to take a stand and begin to shape opinion,'' said
Bresnan.
   Retired Gen. Brent Scowcroft, former national security adviser
who headed a study of the bases issue for the Council on Foreign
Relations in New York, said, ``What we have to hope for is that the
Filipino people weigh in on this, because there is overwhelming
support among them for the bases.''
   The Filipinos who oppose the continued U.S. presence ``feel that
as long as we're there, they can't cut the umbilical cord with the
United States,'' said Scowcroft, ``and nothing we can do will
change that.''

<TEXT>
   In dealing a blow to an ambitious
Serbian politician, Yugoslavia's Communist leaders have shown how
difficult it is to quell ethnic turmoil or introduce democracy in
this one-party state.
   With millions watching on television, the Communist elite last
week ended 38 hours of bitter debate with a dramatic rebuff to
Serbian Communist party leader Slobodan Milosevic.
   A close ally of Milosevic, Dusan Ckrebic, was the only member of
the ruling Politburo not to win a secret vote of confidence
Wednesday from the party's policy-setting Central Committee.
   Ckrebic, an old-time Communist in his 60s, immediately offered
his resignation. But Milosevic angrily intervened to stop
consideration of the offer, and Ckrebic remains on the Politburo
for now.
   Another Ckrebic ally charged that an ``unprincipled coalition''
tried to bring Ckrebic down to hurt Milosevic.
   The meeting, which did little to tackle the growing economic
crisis, gave Yugoslavs a revealing look at their squabbling
leadership.
   Serbs who have rallied round Milosevic's campaign for greater
Serbian control over the provinces of Kosovo and Vojvodina were
furious that only a Serb _ Ckrebic _ fell victim to the
unprecedented vote of confidence for Politburo members.
   ``Did you see what they did to us?'' fumed a Belgrade television
journalist.
   The next day, 20,000 Serbs in Kosovo protested the outcome.
   Chanting ``We will not give up Ckrebic!'' they literally turned
their backs on two Politburo members who came to address complaints
that the Central Committee session did nothing to meet their
demands.
   The 200,000 Kosovo Serbs and Montenegrins, a minority in what
was once a Serbian heartland, want to end alleged harassment by the
ethnic Albanian majority. They also want to oust some ethnic
Albanian Communist leaders.
   The call for action extends far beyond Kosovo. With inflation at
217 percent and living standards halved since 1980, most of
Yugoslavia's 23 million people are fed up with leaders they
perceive as ineffectual and corrupt.
   The Central Committee's response to the widespread demand for
new leaders was the vote of confidence and the prospect that a
third of the committee's 165 members would be replaced in the next
six weeks.
   That would constitute the single biggest sweep of top party
ranks since Stalinists were purged after Yugoslavia's break with
Moscow in 1948.
   But it fell short of widespread expectations of an immediate
shake-up, and the choice of who should fall is likely to get mired
in the usual battle among the party leaderships of Yugoslavia's six
republics and two provinces.
   The broad powers given those eight leaderships under the 1974
constitution have enabled widely varying political cultures to
develop.
   The most obvious gap is between the rich, Western-oriented north
and the bankrupt, backward southern areas of Montenegro, Macedonia
and Kosovo.
   Another rift has opened up between liberal northern Slovenia and
the demagogic populism of Serbia's Milosevic.
   Party chief Stipe Suvar, from the republic of Croatia between
Slovenia and Serbia, hailed the vote of confidence in Politburo
members as a step to party democracy.
   But the way Milosevic tried to undo the verdict showed clearly
that however much he supports economic and even political reform,
he will protect Serbia's and his own interests first.
   The leaders agree that change is needed, Suvar said after the
Central Committee meeting. But he said the party's only experience
in cleaning its own house is in purges ordered from the top.
   ``We are still learning the rules of the game,'' he said.
   The half-hearted steps toward political reform show how hard it
is for any one-party system to change without the Communists either
relinquishing power to some form of popular control or simply
carrying out a ruthless purge.
   Stane Dolanc, a former No. 2 to the late Josip Broz Tito, said
during the Central Committee's debate that the crisis probably cost
Yugoslavia ``a billion dollars'' in lost foreign investments.
   Suvar tried to assuage what he said were foreign fears that
Yugoslavia is descending into chaos.
   ``Yugoslavia will not fall apart,'' he said. ``There is a great
deal of quarreling in Yugoslavia, but it is not as dangerous as it
may appear at first glance.''
   But Western creditors are likely to remain uneasy about
recovering any of Yugoslavia's $21 billion foreign debt.
   Economic and constitutional reforms designed to attract foreign
and private investment are lumbering their way through party and
government organs this fall.
   For years, Yugoslavs have called for such reforms _ and more
radical ones, such as a return to private farming in this largely
agricultural nation.
   Ironically, the political struggle fueled by the ambitions of
Milosevic may deter foreign investors just as Yugoslavia opens up
to capitalist investment.

<TEXT>
   South Korea's top opposition leader,
Kim Dae-jung, has received an invitation from a Soviet institute to
visit Moscow, aides said Saturday.
   Kim got the invitation last week from Georgy Arbatov, a member
of the Soviet Communist Party's Central Committee, the aides said.
   The letter from Arbatov, who also heads the U.S.-Canada
Institute, a Kremlin think tank, said Kim would be able to get a
Soviet visa at any Soviet Embassy overseas, with no dates
specified, they said.
   South Korea has no diplomatic relations with communist nations
and the Soviets have no diplomatic mission in South Korea.
   Kim was considering his visit to Moscow ``affirmatively'' but
has made no decision, the aides said.
   They said Arbatov also wanted to read Kim's studies about
political and other issues involving the United States, the Korean
peninsula and the Pacific region.
   Kim heads South Korea's largest opposition group, the Party for
Peace and Democracy, and aides have said he still wants to run for
the presidency again at the end of President Roh Tae-woo's
five-year term.
   Roh took office in February after winning last December's
presidential election over divided opposition candidates.

   The 100th Congress, which adjourned with a
parting salvo in the war against drugs, may best be remembered for
its wrestling over two national controversies _ the Iran-Contra
affair and the nomination of Robert Bork to the Supreme Court.
   Both dramas, played out in ornate committee rooms before
national television audiences, involved the lawmakers in bitter
feuding among themselves and with the White House.
   A host of other issues produced a lengthy list of
accomplishments over a two-year session that brought to a close the
first 200 years of congressional history.
   For the first time since 1976, the House and Senate, working
furiously, passed all 13 appropriations bills before the start of
fiscal 1989 _ an event accomplished at three minutes to midnight on
Sept. 30, the end of fiscal 1988.
   ``I think it's been one of the truly great Congresses in my
experience and in this century,'' said House Majority Leader Tom
Foley, D-Wash. ``It's turned out to be not only a historic
Congress, but also an extraordinarily productive one.''
   Other major legislative accomplishments included:
   _A multibillion dollar attack in the ``war against drugs'' that
features money for rehabilitation, up to $10,000 in civil penalties
and loss of federal benefits for personal use of even small amounts
of drugs, and a death penalty for drug dealers who murder during
drug-related crimes.
   _A complex tax package whose main purpose was correcting errors
in the 1986 tax overhaul, but also included dozens of tax benefits
to one group or another as well as the tax increases to pay for
them. It has a three-year price tag of $4.1 billion.
   _The first complete overhaul of the federal welfare system since
its inception during the depression of the 1930s.
   _Ratification of the first U.S.-Soviet arms reduction treaty.
The Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces, or INF, treaty requires
elimination within three years of all missiles with a range of 300
miles to 3,400 miles.
   _A sweeping revision of the trade laws, to reduce the trade
surpluses that other countries run with the United States.
   _The $18 billion Clean Water Act, passed after two vetoes by
President Reagan and designed to improve the quality of many of
America's waterways.
   _Catastrophic health insurance for millions of elderly or
disabled people who receive Medicare, providing free hospital care
for lengthy illnesses after the recipient pays the first $564.
   _Two civil rights bills, the Civil Rights Restoration Act and
the Fair Housing Act.
   _An $800 million health package designed to fight the AIDS
epidemic, including money for testing, research and home care.
   _A $1.2 billion bill providing individual payments of $20,000 to
Japanese-American survivors of World War II internment camps
established in Western states after the Japanese attack on Pearl
Harbor.
   _Drought relief for crop and livestock producers hit by the
summer drought, with a price tag estimated from $3.9 billion to
$5.1 billion.
   _A package of veterans legislation, including a bill to elevate
the Veterans Administration to Cabinet status, an action that will
give the new Department Veterans Affairs additional political clout.
   _An $88 billion highway and mass transit bill that permitted
states to boost the speed limit on some interstate highways to 65
miles per hour.
   _Legislation prohibiting smoking on domestic airline flights of
two hours or less, a period that covers the vast majority of
commercial flights.
   Both Senate Majority Leader Robert C. Byrd, D-W.Va., and House
Speaker Jim Wright, D-Texas, called the 100th Congress the most
productive in two decades.
   ``I believe it is the most productive one since LBJ, 20 years
ago,'' Byrd said, referring to the leadership of Lyndon Baines
Johnson and passage of the 1965 Civil Rights Act.
   ``Perhaps the most productive since 1965-1966,'' Wright echoed.
   Senate Republican Leader Bob Dole of Kansas was perhaps thinking
of the session's occasionally raucous, partisan, fighting moments
as well as its accomplishments, when he said he could sum
everything up with two words: ``historic and hysteric.''
   Wright, who assumed the speaker's chair at the start of the
Congress, replacing Thomas P. ``Tip'' O'Neill, ended the session
the subject of an ethics investigation into whether he abused his
office for personal financial gain. A separate ethic probe was
under way into whether he violated House rules by disclosing a
purported CIA covert operation in Nicaragua.
   Congress' prompt action on money matters, partly as a result of
the October 1987 stock market crash, meant the government started
fiscal 1989 this month without the usual threats of a
government-wide shutdown. President Reagan was relieved not to get
another catchall spending bill, wrapping together money for
hundreds of government programs.
   Following the market crash, White House officials and
congressional leaders held a series of closed-door meetings for a
month, seeking to end a year of clashes over spending and tax
levels. Their budget summit of last November produced an agreement
_ since adhered to _ that limited tax increases and set caps on
spending levels for domestic, military and foreign assistance
programs for the last two federal fiscal years.
   One of the Congress' earliest acts was to undertake a massive
investigation of the Iran-Contra affair. For 14 weeks during the
spring and summer of 1987 virtually all other business was shunted
into the background while House and Senate committees held
unprecedented joint hearings.
   Television carried the proceedings to the nation as Lt. Col.
Oliver North and his former colleagues wove a tale of a clandestine
enterprise extending to four continents. Parallels to Watergate
were drawn and suspense built over whether evidence ultimately
would link the entire affair directly to Reagan.
   The committees reviewed more than 300,000 documents and
interviewed more than 500 witnesses as they probed the sale of
weapons to Iran and the diversion of some of the ``profits'' to aid
the Contra rebels fighting Nicaragua's leftist government.
   Secretary of State George Shultz, who had opposed the
arms-for-hostages swap, summed it up for investigators: ``Our guys
got taken to the cleaners.''
   But in the end, there was no ``smoking gun.'' In a report issued
at the end of 1987, the committees concluded that a ``cabal of ...
zealots'' had lied, deceived Congress and each other and exhibited
disdain for the law. ``The ultimate responsibility for the events
in the Iran-Contra affair must rest with the president,'' they
concluded.
   Of 110 judicial court nominees submitted by Reagan to the
Senate, 91 were confirmed. As a result, in nearly eight years in
office, Reagan has named just more than half of the active judges
on U.S. district and appellate courts and the Supreme Court.
   By far the most contentious nomination fight was over Reagan's
nomination of Bork to succeed Lewis F. Powell. The conservative
nominee had written much that was controversial, and he refused to
back down from his criticism of what he saw as the Supreme Court's
unconstitutional activism.
   It was a fight basically fought out on television, from the live
broadcasts of the confirmation hearings and Senate sessions, to the
taped commercials from both sides.
   Even though clearly defeated, Bork declined to withdraw,
insisting on a vote. When it came, he was rejected 58-42. Reagan's
second attempt to replace Powell was torpedoed when Douglas H.
Ginsburg withdrew as a nominee after conflict of interest questions
arose he after he admitted smoking marijuana while a Harvard Law
School professor.
   Reagan's third choice, Anthony M. Kennedy, was confirmed 97-0
last Feb. 3.

   The most important social lawmaking done by the 100th Congress
was the welfare overhaul bill. A painstaking compromise, the new
law requires states to create job, training and education programs
and requires welfare mothers of children over 3 to participate in
them. States are also told to crack down on child support
collection and establish paternity in many more births involving
welfare recipients.
   The welfare changes are to be phased in over five years at a
cost of $3.3 billion. Proponents caution that the act is not a
panacea for poverty, but their aim is scarcely less modest. They
hope to see the welfare system transformed from a check-mailing
operation into an avenue to independence and parental
responsibility.
   While the welfare bill demonstrated cooperation between the two,
Congress took on the Reagan administration over civil rights.
   Over Reagan's veto, Congress enacted the Civil Rights
Restoration Act to broaden the protections afforded to women,
minorities, the elderly and the disabled under four federal civil
rights laws.
   The Supreme Court ruled in 1984 that only specific programs or
activities receiving federal monies had to comply with the four
anti-bias statutes. Under the new law, entire institutions,
government agencies and some corporations must comply even if only
one activity receives federal funds.
   Congress also strengthened the nation's fair housing law by
allowing stiff fines against those found guilty of discrimination.
Previous law only gave the federal government a mediation role.
   In the field of foreign affairs, the long-running dispute over
aid to the Nicaraguan Contra rebels was the most divisive issue.
The rebels benefited from $100 million in aid, including weaponry,
that had been approved by the previous Congress. But it was to
prove the last military assistance Congress would give.
   On Feb. 3, 1988, with Speaker Wright taking a high-profile role
and urging colleagues to ``give peace a chance,'' the House
defeated by eight votes an administration plea to give the rebels
new lethal aid. Follow-up legislation was approved to give solely
``humanitarian'' aid _ food, clothing and medicine _ to the
Contras. But by year's end even their supporters conceded the
rebels had ceased to be a fighting force.

<HEAD>Artist's Popularity Is Stronger Than Ever 10 Years After His Death</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A decade after the death of artist
Norman Rockwell, the little white house that holds his beloved
illustrations groans from the weight of 1.3 million visitors.
   And his Saturday Evening Post covers that art critics scoffed at
are fetching prices as high as $500,000 from such collectors as
Texas billionaire H. Ross Perot.
   The tall, thin, pigeon-toed artist, who called himself a hack
and feared losing his audience all his life, would be amazed and
amused at his enormous popularity, said his son Thomas Rockwell.
   ``He liked being recognized on the street, but he was always a
little surprised by it,'' Thomas said in a telephone interview from
his Poughkeepsie, N.Y., home.
   Rockwell's growing popularity threatens to overwhelm the pretty
town of 2,300 people where he lived for 25 years before his death
on Nov. 8, 1978, at the age of 84.
   Nearly 130,000 people will visit the Rockwell museum this year,
said director Laurie Norton Moffatt. She said the museum, which
opened in 1968 in the 18th century Georgian house, has stopped
advertising because it is filled to capacity six months of the year.
   ``He would have said `Gee whiz!' _ that was his favorite
expression _ `I can't imagine why they would want to spend all that
time looking at my pictures.' But he would be sorry about all the
traffic in town,'' said Margaret Batty, assistant museum director
and a friend of Rockwell's.
   ``I go home every Friday night and leave the town to the
tourists for the weekend,'' said insurance agent Marty Salvadore.
   Townspeople said they will breathe a sigh of relief when a new
museum finally opens far from the center of town. Ground breaking
is set for late 1989.
   All the excitement is for a humble painter who told The
Associated Press in an interview shortly before his death: ``I just
do the things that people pay me very high prices to do.''
   New York art dealer Judy Goffman believes Rockwell is the
best-known artist in America. ``He was on 3 million coffee tables
with The Saturday Evening Post,'' she said.
   She set an auction record for a Rockwell painting in 1981 with
her bid of $253,000 for ``The Homecoming Marine.'' She sold it to
Perot a few years later at double the price and believes Rockwell's
finest works now can fetch $1 million.
   Norman Percevel Rockwell began his magazine-cover career at 16
after dropping out of art school in New York. He was 22 when he did
the first of 321 Saturday Evening Post covers that would make his a
household name.
   His ``Four Freedoms,'' paintings that traveled the country in
1943, raised more than $130 million for the war effort. The year
before his death he was awarded the nation's highest peacetime
award, the Presidential Medal of Freedom.
   Up to his final year, however, Rockwell worked almost
obsessively. ``He felt even up to the end that his popularity might
all vanish,'' his son said.
   Rockwell said shortly before his death: ``I want to be working
on a picture and just fall over dead. ... I don't want to sit in a
chair or go to Florida or anything like that.''
   He did not get his wish. Ill health made it impossible for him
to work the last year of his life.
   Rockwell never was much of a businessman, his son said, and so
he often gave up the rights to his work and gave away his
paintings. When he died, ``he wasn't really a wealthy man,'' Thomas
Rockwell said.
   Thomas Rockwell's brother Peter, a sculptor who lives in Rome,
is casting a bronze sculpture of frolicking children for the new
Rockwell museum, and eldest brother Jarvis, an artist who lives in
Stockbridge, has shown some of his father's whimsical spirit with
temporary sculptures he has made out of plastic toys.
   Having Norman Rockwell for a father ``had its advantages and its
disadvantages,'' said Jarvis, 57. ``All I can say about it is that
I miss him.''

   A man required 30 stitches after
being attacked by a kangaroo at a popular camping area. ``I believe
it was capable of killing,'' the victim said Saturday.
   Shaun Fitzpatrick, 36, said the kangaroo pounced on him Friday
while he fed bread to about five of the marsupials at Grampians
National Park in Victoria.
   A witness with a videocamera filmed the attack, which appeared
unprovoked.
   The gray male kangaroo jumped at Fitzpatrick and kicked and
clawed him. The animal scratched Fitzpatrick's face and caused a
groin wound that required stitches.
   Fitzpatrick's four children, brother, sister-in-law, and a
cousin visiting from England were with him but fled to their car
when the attack began.

   A barbecued buffalo sandwich once
bitten into by Richard M. Nixon is being preserved for posterity by
an Illinois family.
   Steve Jenne, now 42, was a Boy Scout in his native Sullivan when
Nixon, then vice president, sank his teeth into the sandwich. Jenne
walked off with the uneaten portion and his family has kept it in a
deep freeze since.
   ``It'll probably stay frozen forever,'' Jenne said recently.
``It's been a part of the family for 28 years.''
   Nixon, then a presidential hopeful, was guest at a local
Republican barbecue in Sullivan. Jenne, 14, and his Scout troop
were detailed to surround Nixon's table to keep the throngs away.
   ``Security wasn't like it is today,'' Jenne recalled. ``It was
pretty lax.''
   Nixon had taken just three or four bites when he had to leave.
   ``I saw (the sandwich) sitting there, so I just grabbed it,
plate and all,'' Jenne recalled.
   That partially eaten sandwich became Jenne's claim to fame. The
incident got newspaper coverage at the time and again, eight years
later, when Nixon was elected president.
   The sandwich, Jenne said, has been stored in a glass jar over
the years. The paper plate on which it rested, still sporting
barbecue stains, is between the pages of a folder which his mother,
Hazel, created especially for ``sandwich souvenirs.''
   Printed on the plate, in a 14-year-old's handwriting, are the
words ``This is the plate on which Vice President and future
President Nixon ate buffalo barbecue. Sept. 22, 1960.''
   The sandwich has survived weather-related power outages and once
falling on the floor.
   ``I think (the sandwich) has survived better than Nixon has,''
Mrs. Jenne said.

   The scrubs became the first team in the Merry
Maids National Housecleaning Olympics as 12 teams of two maids each
vied in the vacuum cord curl, toilet bowl brush relay and
upholstery tool golf.
   About 560 Merry Maids franchise owners and managers, in Omaha
for a seminar, cheered on the finalists Friday, who had won the
right to compete by defeating other maids in local and regional
trials across the country.
   ``We do it (the games) to recognize our maids,'' said Dale
Peterson, a Merry Maids executive vice president. ``They're the key
to our success.''
   The competition came complete with bleachers, cheerleaders,
popcorn and peanuts and a twist on the traditional torch-lighting
ceremony.
   The two torch bearers raced into the Red Lion Hotel ballroom
carrying toilet bowl brushes and ``lit'' the crepe paper flames
that leapt from a toilet bowl on a marble pedestal.
   The gold medal winners were Marian Bosack and Marilyn Hadeen of
Council Bluffs, Iowa. Mary Hardway and Robin Moore of Newark, Ohio,
won the silver, while Jeannette Mooney and Danielle Sturtz of
Tempe, Ariz., won the bronze medal.

   Like it or not, if you plan to work during
the winter season to qualify for a discounted ski pass in this
mountain resort town, you will have to attend Smile School.
   The Vail Chamber of Commerce has decided that all bellhops,
bartenders and others working in the service industry must complete
the $25, three-hour courtesy class before qualifying for the ski
pass.
   The program officially is called Guest Service Orientation, but
it quickly took the name Smile School _ the name of a
town-sponsored orientation program for Vail bus drivers and parking
attendants.
   Not everyone is smiling over the chamber's decision.
   ``Smile School is a wonderful idea so our guests will enjoy good
service, but the chamber of commerce went about it in the wrong
way,'' said Allison Sullivan, a bartender at Bart and Yeti's. ``It
really wasn't the $25 cost, but just the way they announced that
attendance was required for the discount like we were school
children.''
   Employers who didn't pick up the $25 cost for their employees
``would come off like a bad guy, and that wasn't fair to them,''
she said.
   The merchant pass for employees will remain $625 for those who
earn their Smile School certificate, and $725 for other community
residents, including workers who don't take the course.
   ``We feel that excellent service to our guests must be stressed
because we face a very important year at Vail, especially with the
world championships that will bring the top international skiers
here,'' said Shelbi Williams, chamber director.

   A West German tourist bus veered off a
highway Saturday and overturned, killing two elderly West Germans
and injuring 21 other people, a Civil Guard traffic official said.
   The bus crashed at about 7 a.m. on the A-7 Mediterranean
highway, about nine miles south of this northeastern city, the
official said.
   The official identified the dead as the 73-year-old woman Luise
Jeschonneck and Friedrich Wilhelm Giunchi, 77, both of Duesseldorf.
He said the injured were from several other cities in West Germany,
but did not elaborate.
   The cause of the accident was not immediately known, he said.
   Hospital officials said 18 of the injured were treated and
released, and three remained hospitalized with broken bones.
   The Civil Guard official said it was not known where the bus
originated, but it apparently was headed toward Barcelona, 62 miles
south of Figueras.

<TEXT>
   The Lebanese, with rival Moslem and
Christian groups claiming to govern them, fear the monthlong
turmoil over a new president will formally sever ties that kept the
nation together through a 13-year civil war.
   ``We have no president and Parliament is lost. What is there to
help Lebanon survive?'' said Kazem Khalil, 88, the eldest of
Lebanon's Parliamentary deputies and an architect of the country's
independence from France in 1943.
   ``This is the worst crisis we've ever had,'' said Khalil,
appointed interim Parliament speaker last week. ``The political,
social and economic systems have ceased to exist. We just don't
know where we're heading.''
   He echoed the despair of most Lebanese at the creeping partition
of the country into Moslem and Christian cantons after Parliament
failed to elect a president to succeed Amin Gemayel when his
six-year term expired Sept. 23.
   Parliamentary efforts failed because Christian deputies, opposed
to Syrian-backed candidates who were the most serious contenders,
boycotted the electoral sessions and blocked a quorum.
   Gemayel appointed army commander Gen. Michel Aoun, a Maronite
Catholic, head of a caretaker military government minutes before he
stepped down.
   But acting Prime Minister Salim Hoss, a Sunni Moslem, declared
that his Cabinet, installed under Gemayel, was the legitimate one.
   Three Moslem army officers named as ministers under Aoun quit.
All but one Christian in Hoss' Cabinet resigned and handed their
ministries over to Aoun.
   The crisis deepened last week when Parliament failed to elect a
new speaker to succeed Hussein Husseini, a pro-Syrian Shiite
Moslem, after his one-year term expired. Khalil was appointed in
the session, which once again was boycotted by the Christians.
   The Americans had sought with the Syrians to produce a
compromise candidate for the presidency but have backed off
diplomatic efforts until after the U.S. presidential election Nov.
8, one well-informed Lebanese said.
   ``The United States now appears to be as much at a loss about
Lebanese as the leaders of Lebanon themselves,'' said the source,
who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Despite widespread fears that the constitutional crisis will
touch off new fighting, there have been only sporadic clashes
between Christians and Moslems.
   The two sides, after years of warfare and intervention by Syria,
Iraq, Israel and Libya, have achieved a military balance.
   The estimated 800,000 Christians, led by Samir Geagea, a former
medical student who commands their main militia, have been
receiving shiploads of weapons and ammunition from Iraq.
   Baghdad, freed from the gulf war against Iran by an Aug. 20
cease-fire, has been arming the Christians to sabotage Syria's
efforts to pacify Lebanon.
   Syria, Iraq's archrival in the Arab world, backed Iran during
the war and supports Lebanon's estimated 1.7 million Moslems.
   ``The Christians are armed to the teeth,'' a senior Lebanese
army officer said, also speaking on condition of anonymity.
   ``They can defend themselves against any Moslem or Syrian
attack, but ... they can't attack or make any territorial gains.''
   The stalemate has sent prices of food, gasoline and other basics
soaring. A 2.2-pound can of powdered milk cost 4,000 Lebanese
pounds Friday against 2,700 pounds Monday.
   The Lebanese pound, pegged at 8 to the dollar in 1982 and 337 on
Sept. 22, was at 540 Friday.
   So far, the rival governments have not embarked on an economic
war.
   The Christians easily could cut off electricity, fuel and water
supplies to Moslem west Beirut.
   They may be refraining because the Central Bank, where 70
percent of Lebanon's 9.3 million ounces in gold reserves are held,
is located on the Moslem side.

   An aircraft mechanic faces
manslaughter charges and could lose his certification following his
arrest for allegedly improperly installing an engine part that
caused a fatal plane crash.
   Jack Barker, a spokesman for the Federal Aviation Administration
in Atlanta, said he knew of no other prosecution of a mechanic for
a mistake that led to a fatal crash.
   ``The circumstances in this case are peculiar,'' Volusia County
sheriff's Sgt. Edward Carroll said Friday. ``By its very nature an
aircraft is a very sophisticated and very dangerous piece of
equipment. It's not like a car that if it breaks down, you dump it
by the side of the road.''
   Dale E. Halter, 43, of South Daytona Beach, an employee at
Spruce Creek Airport, was arrested Thursday by Volusia County
sheriff's investigators on charges of manslaughter by culpable
negligence, a third-degree felony, Carroll said. He was released on
$2,500 bond.
   Barker said Halter's FAA mechanic's license is under
investigation and could be revoked for violations of agency rules.
   The National Transportation Safety Board blamed the July 24
death of Donald R. Paul, of Gatlinburg, Tenn., on an air-oil
separator on his single-engine plane that had been worked on by
Halter.
   Improper installation of the separator caused the engine to lose
its oil and freeze up, Carroll said. Paul crashed shortly after
takeoff.
   ``We could trace the path of the plane down the runway from the
trail of the oil being expelled,'' Carroll said. ``If the thing had
been tested after the installation, it would have been detected.''
   Carroll said the charges did not represent a crackdown or a
change of policy by his department.
   ``This piece of equipment was installed in direct violation of
FAA regulations,'' Carroll said. ``This person is an FAA mechanic
and should have known _ that adds up to to probable cause for the
third-degree manslaughter charge.''

   One of the first lessons learned by a member
of Congress is that there's no better way to keep voters happy than
to cut their taxes.
   There's no money left in the federal treasury to grant any more
across-the-board tax reductions such as were approved in 1981. But
that doesn't prevent the lawmakers from granting targeted relief to
one group after another.
   That's exactly what they did in the tax bill that cleared its
final hurdle in Congress on Saturday. It now goes to President
Reagan, and sponsors predict he will sign it.
   The bill originally was designed to clear up confusing language
and correct errors in the landmark tax overhaul enacted in 1986.
But it was amended over and over to extend some expiring benefits,
add some new ones for selected groups, and raise taxes to finance
the benefits.
   The measure would have no effect on the federal deficit.
Although it would cut taxes by $4.1 billion over three years, it
would raise others by the same amount.
   And it is not just tax cuts and increases that were attached to
the bill. It includes a ``taxpayer's bill of rights'' to rein in
what some lawmakers view as an overly aggressive Internal Revenue
Service; for example, the agency would have to give 30 days' notice
before seizing bank accounts and other property, and would be
prohibited from promoting employees on the basis of how much they
collect.
   Some of the other provisions:
   _DIESEL: Wipe out a 1987 requirement that farmers, construction
companies and other tax-exempt, off-road users of diesel fuel pay
the federal tax of 15.1 cents a gallon and later apply for a refund.
   _MUTUAL FUNDS: For 1988 and 1989, permit owners of mutual fund
shares to deduct certain operating expenses of the fund without
regard to a general provision allowing deduction of only
miscellaneous expenses that exceed 2 percent of income.
   _HIGHER EDUCATION: Exempt from taxation interest earned on U.S.
savings bonds that are redeemed to finance a college or vocational
education, starting in 1990.
   _TUITION AID: Renew for 1988 an expired law allowing a worker to
avoid tax on up to $5,250 a year of employer-provided education
assistance. Graduate education would not qualify.
   _HOUSING: Extend through 1989 a tax credit for owners of newly
constructed low-income rental housing. Also, extend through 1989
and modify a tax exemption for bonds issued by state and local
governments to help low-income families buy their first home.
   _TOBACCO: Impose a tax of 45 cents per pound on pipe tobacco.
   _WRITERS: Allow free-lance writers, artists and photographers to
deduct work-related expenses even before a project produces income.
   _`HEIFER TAX': Permit livestock farmers to deduct expenses of
producing livestock before the animals begin generating income,
thus repealing what has become known as the ``heifer tax.''
   _ATHLETICS: Allow an 80 percent deduction for contributions to
college athletic scholarship funds even when such ``gifts''
guarantee a fan the privilege of buying a game ticket.
   _RESEARCH: Extend through 1989 a credit for increased spending
for research and experimentation.
   _JOB TRAINING: Extend through 1989 a credit under which the
government pays the first year of wages for certain newly hired
economically disadvantaged workers.
   _CONTRACTORS: Further restrict the ``completed-contract'' method
of accounting that allows defense contractors and most big
construction companies to delay taxes on part of their profits
until a project is completed. This change will raise $1.3 billion.
   _CORPORATIONS: Accelerate estimated tax payments from
corporations that switch from an annualized method of computation,
raising $869 million.
   _ALASKA CORPORATIONS: Repeal a provision that has allowed Alaska
Native corporations to sell some of their unused tax credits to
other companies; repeal will cost the Alaska companies $1 billion.
   _LIFE INSURANCE: Remove some of the tax advantages of using
single-premium life insurance as an investment. Loans from such
policies would be taxed as cash withdrawals; the new rules would
apply to policies whose cash value builds more quickly than one
paid through seven equal annual premiums. The change would cost
policyholders $345 million.
   _MAIL CARRIERS: Allow rural mail carriers to deduct 33.75 cents
for each mile a personal car is driven on a mail route; most people
are allowed 22.5 cents a mile for business-related mileage.
   _BUSINESS MEALS: Permit operators of offshore or Alaska oil rigs
and of some commercial vessels (but not luxury liners) to deduct
the full cost of meals provided to employees; most business may
deduct only 80 percent.
   _HOME SALE: Allow a surviving spouse to defer taxation on
profits from the sale of a principal home, just as though the
spouse had not died. Present law denies such a break if a spouse
dies after a home is sold and before a new one is built. Also, the
provision allowing a person over 55 to avoid tax on up to $125,000
of profits from the sale of a principal home in which he or she had
lived at least three of the last five years would be available to a
person who spends up to four of those five years in a nursing home.
   _HOME PHONE: Prohibit any person with a home-based business from
deducting any part of the base monthly telephone charge as a
business expense.
   _FARM MACHINERY: Tighten depreciation provisions for
single-purpose farm structures, such as poultry houses, and farm
machinery.
   _FARM INCOME: Expand a law allowing farmers to defer for one
year income from the drought-forced sale of livestock. Also, the
measure would ensure that farmers may defer taxes on payments
received as a result of drought-caused crop losses.
   _BANKS: Renew a tax break for healthy savings and loan
associations that take over failing associations, and extend the
benefit to banks.
   _HIGH-SPEED RAIL: Permit use of tax-exempt bonds to finance
certain high-speed rail facilities.
   _BLOOD DONORS: Permit states and blood-collection facilities to
require blood donors to list their Social Security numbers so they
can be traced if tests determine their blood is carrying the AIDS
virus.
   _AMISH: Exempt from Social Security taxes employees from Amish
and other sects with religious objections to the program;
self-employed Amish already are exempt.

<HEAD>Met Forges Final Link In `Ring Cycle' Chain</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE SILVERMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Fire and flood consumed the stage of the
Metropolitan Opera House in the final scene of Wagner's
``Goetterdaemmerung,'' but instead of fleeing in panic, the
audience leapt to its feet and cheered.
   The triumphant premiere of the new production Friday night meant
that the nation's leading opera house had forged the final link in
its long-awaited new production of Wagner's epic ``Ring Cycle.''
   The sets and the lighting were among the most spectacular ever
seen at the Met and, at least as far as the heroine and the villain
were concerned, it seemed as if the company had even brought back
the much-lamented bygone Golden Era of Wagnerian singing.
   Soprano Hildegard Behrens, singing and acting with passion and
elegance as the noble Bruennhilde, consolidated her claim as a
worthy successor to the great Birgit Nilsson. She and bass Matti
Salminen as the baleful Hagen dominated the stage and easily
penetrated even the cruelest waves of sound that Wagner _ and the
Met orchestra _ could provide.
   Not for 13 seasons had the company performed this last and
longest (nearly six hours including two intermissions) of the four
operas in which Wagner intertwined Norse mythology and 19th century
German philosophy with sometimes muddled, but generally powerful,
results.
   ``Twilight of the Gods'' as the opera is called in English,
turns on Hagen's determination to get his hands on the magical gold
ring that has been the source of all the trouble since his father,
Alberich, stole it from the Rhinemaidens in the first opera, ``Das
Rheingold.''
   The plot twists might seem silly were they not redeemed by
Wagner's glorious music, which carries the audience through
contrivances like an amnesia-inducing potion and a magical helmet
that disguises Siegfried so Bruennhilde can't recognize her own
husband when he kidnaps her.
   The sets by Guenther Schneider-Siemssen have combined naturalism
with high-tech effects throughout the earlier operas and reach
their artistic peak in Act 3. The first scene, a forest clearing
where Hagen murders Siegfried, is strikingly realistic, the tableau
resembling a Flemish painting. Gil Wechsler's lighting moves subtly
from dappled sunlight to encroaching darkness as the hero's doom
approaches.
   But the real stage wizardry is saved for the finale, when
Bruennhilde's suicide in Siegfried's funeral pyre literally sets
the world ablaze, causes the Rhine to overflow, and even burns up
Valhalla, the kingdom of the Gods. All this is vividly brought to
life as the orchestra, splendidly conducted by James Levine, pours
out the final measures of the score.
   In a performance so strong it's a shame the biggest weakness was
the Siegfried of Toni Kramer. He seemed ill at ease on stage, his
medium-sized voice showed severe strain by Act 2, and he gave only
a workmanlike rendition of his wonderful final narrative. Baritone
Anthony Raffell failed to make much impression in the thankless
role of Gunther, Hagen's half-brother. Soprano Kathryn Harries did
better as Gunther's sister, Gutrune, but had trouble with her high
notes.
   In the small but vital role of Waltraute, Bruennhilde's sister,
mezzo Christa Ludwig _ who was singing in Ring Cycles 20 years ago
_ made a dazzling impression and provided a valuable link with a
tradition the Met is bidding to revive.
   ``Goetterdaemmerung'' will be performed several more times this
fall. In the spring, the Met will stage three complete Rings _ one
of them on successive Saturday afternoons in April for a nationwide
radio audience.

<TEXT>
   Meat prices rose Saturday and bread
prices will rise by 60 percent, the government said, two days after
an unpopular austerity program was amended to allow salary raises
for some workers.
   The Belgrade daily Politika Ekspres said the latest price
increases ``will drive the remaining shoppers out of meat markets''
and will further depress living standards.
   Thousands of Yugoslavs in recent weeks have protested rising
prices in a growing economic crisis in the communist nation.
   As of Saturday, prime quality steak cost $6.36 a pound in
Belgrade, up from $5.55. Ground meat rose from $2.21 to $3.39 a
pound.
   The cheapest type of bread, now available for 5 cents a pound,
will cost 8 cents when new bread prices take effect Sunday,
Politika Ekspres said.
   Statistics published here say living standards have dropped to
the level of the mid-1960s. Inflation is running as high as 217
percent.
   Meat prices were boosted considerably three weeks ago. Last
year, the government had to cancel sharp increases in bread prices
after widespread protests.
   The average monthly income in Yugoslavia is $100, and experts
say about 80 percent of it goes for food.
   Faced with increasing strikes and worker protests, Parliament on
Thursday eased an austerity program of wage cuts and price rises
introduced in May.
   The amendments allow wages increases of 140 percent to 152
percent this year, but only for workers in profitable companies and
in hard-pressed social services like health and education.
   Another Belgrade newspaper, Vecernje Novosti, said about half of
Yugoslav companies, employing more than 2 million workers, will not
be able to increase their wages because they are not making profits.

   Representatives of 300 Indian tribes
will meet here this week to set a national agenda of Indian
concerns to be presented to the next president of the United States.
   The National Congress of American Indians, one of the nation's
oldest and largest Indian organizations, begins its 45th annual
convention Monday.
   ``Basically, we're going to develop a blueprint of what we would
like the new administration and the Congress to do,'' said Suzan
Shown Harjo of Washington, D.C., the executive director of the
organization.
   Among the issues to be discussed are hunting and fishing rights,
gaming regulation, health care, economic development and promotion
of treaty rights. The Winnebago Tribe of Nebraska is host of the
convention.
   Norma Stealer, vice chairman of the Winnebago tribal council,
said the convention is particularly important in a presidential
election year.
   ``Whenever someone new gets elected, they bring in a brand new
administration, and we have to start our education efforts all over
again,'' she said. ``It is an ongoing effort to bring the issues
that concern Indian peoples to the attention of those who make the
decisions.''
   The congress is a non-partisan organization representing Indians
of both political parties, Stealer said.
   ``We work at consensus-building,'' she said.
   The theme of the convention, ``The Next Generation: Here and
Now,'' stems from the idea that Indians must control their own
destiny, Stealer said.
   ``We have always talked about the future,'' she said. ``But now
we realize it's up to us to take responsibility. That's why this is
a very important conference for us.''
   Stealer was unsure how many delegates would attend, but she said
past years' conventions have drawn between 1,000 and 1,500 people.
   Harjo said scheduled speakers for the convention include South
Dakota Sen. Tom Daschle, U.S. Census Bureau Director John Kane, and
Colorado Rep. Ben Nighthorse Campbell, the only Indian member of
Congress.
   Discussions will be held on current litigation, the impact of
AIDS on Indian people, exploitation of Indian culture, the state of
mental health among Indians and the emergence of anti-Indian hate
groups.
   The National Congress of American Indians was founded in 1944.
The group says it serves Indian nations and tribes comprising more
than three-fourths of the American Indian and Alaska Native
populations.

<HEAD>Hurricane Joan Hits Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Killing 7</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: New thruout to UPDATE with storm downgraded to tropical storm

   Hurricane Joan slammed into Nicaragua
and Costa Rica today with 125 mph winds and blinding rain, killing
at least seven people and forcing thousands on the region's
Carribean coast to flee inland.
   The hurricane's winds later dropped to 70 mph, and it was
downgraded to a tropical storm, but forecasters predicted heavy
rains from the storm would cause flash floods and mud slides in
Nicaragua, Costa Rica and Honduras.
   Nicaraguan radio reported three dead and dozens injured on Great
Corn Island, about 45 miles off the city of Bluefields, and Costa
Rican authorities said four drowned and seven were missing there.
More than 77,000 people were evacuated in the two countries,
authorities said.
   On Nicaragua's coast, the storm flattened homes, felled trees
and cut communications. About 1,000 people were evacuated in the
early morning darkness after flood waters threatened to engulf a
neighborhood in Bluefields, 180 miles east of Managua. The group
was taken to a municipal building to ride out the storm, the state
radio, Voice of Nicaragua, reported.
   Precautionary evacuations also began in Managua as the storm
swept inland, according to a newspaper report.
   Severe flooding also was reported in coastal Costa Rican towns,
officials there said. Costa Rica has never been hit by a hurricane
in recorded history, and the last one that hit Nicaragua was in
1911.
   Earlier this week, the storm left at least 26 people dead and
tens of thousands homeless in Colombia and Venezuela.
   Forecasters with the National Hurricane Center in Coral Gables,
Fla., said the storm, traveling west at 8 mph, weakened as it
passed over land.
   Joan struck Great Corn Island late Friday, state radio reported.
   Heavy winds and rain knocked out power in Rama, 60 miles west of
Bluefields, and strong downpours were reported in central Chontales
and southern Rio San Juan provinces.
   Flash flood and mud slide warnings were issued for Costa Rica,
Nicaragua, western Panama and eastern Honduras. Forecasters
predicted more than 15 inches of rain would inundate those areas by
Sunday.
   Storm surges of 10 to 15 feet were expected near and just to the
north of the hurricane's center.
   At noon EDT today, Joan's center was near latitude 11.9 north
and longitude 84.5 west, or 120 miles east of Managua. Maximum
sustained winds were 70 mph.
   ``The danger is effective and real. There exists a great danger
of loss of life in the city of Bluefields,'' Information Minister
Manuel Espinoza said Friday night.
   Neighborhood civil defense committees in Nicaragua stacked
sandbags to form levees against flooding.
   Heavy winds and rain prompted the government to evacuate
hospitals in Puerto Cabezas, 120 miles north of Bluefields, and in
Boaco, an inland city 45 miles northeast of Managua.
   Under an emergency law declared Thursday, the government ordered
private firms to make available stocks of goods necessary to
confront the hurricane.
   Julio Aragon in Juigalpa, Nicaragua, 100 miles west of the
Caribbean coast, said refugees were streaming into the city ahead
of the storm.
   ``They're carrying everything they can _ chickens, pigs, sacks
of beans and other small belongings,'' he said.
   The San Juan and Colorado rivers near the Nicaraguan border
spilled their banks, as did the Coto River on the Pacific side,
officials said.
   Costa Rican officials feared Joan could destroy many of the
20,000 banana plantations along the coast.

   Emperor Hirohito's spirits improved Saturday
despite what doctors described as worsening kidney and liver
functions, a palace official said.
   Palace spokesman Kenji Maeda said Hirohito was unusually
talkative with aides and family members. His fever ebbed to 98.2 by
midday, one of the lowest since he fell seriously ill with
intestinal bleeding Sept. 19.
   By evening, however, the 87-year-old emperor's temperature rose
to 100 after doctors administered a blood transfusion of 0.84
pints, Maeda said.
   Hirohito has received 24.8 pints of blood since he fell ill.
   Hirohito's kidney and liver functions were worsening after
repeated transfusions, a senior palace official said.
   But the progression of his jaundice had stopped, and Hirohito's
anemia seemed to be improving, said the official, who spoke on the
condition he not be named.
   An anti-nuclear group protested widespread displays of reserve,
including cancellations of meetings and festivals in deference to
Hirohito's illness.
   ``These are taking place in disregard of ... the people's
sovereignty,'' the Japan Council Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs
said in a statement.
   ``This unusual state of affairs goes hand in hand with a
strengthening of the Japan-U.S. military alliance and a military
buildup. Where is it leading the people?''

   ``One-liners say a lot,'' says Dan Quayle,
contending that voters have been well informed this year even
though the presidential campaigns have often aimed merely for
catchy television ``sound bites.''
   ``There are a lot of subtleties communicated with a sound
bite,'' the brief TV clip on the evening news, he said. ``People
receive messages.''
   Voters, Quayle said, can receive a complex message from a simple
one-liner, especially when such elements as body language are added
in.
   While Quayle said television coverage of the campaign, the
dominant medium for most Americans, has occasionally lacked
substance, he also said ``the information is out there'' for voters
to make up their minds.
   Both of the presidential compaigns spend millions of dollars on
television advertising, and they arrange candidate appearances and
speeches with an eye toward getting a particular few seconds on the
news. But Quayle said that isn't all bad.
   ``What you have right now is you have to get a story across and
the temptation is to say `OK, we've got a message today we want to
get across on our own terms and nobody else's,''' Quayle said.
   ``That's a pretty good strategy,'' he said. ``You can't fault
the strategy.''
   ``The people, by and large, know a lot about all four of us,''
he said. ``It's more oriented to one-liners, but, you know,
one-liners say a lot.
   ``Let's not minimize the importance of one-liners.''
   Quayle made his comments Friday night in an interview as his
campaign plane returned to Washington after he spent a week
stumping in the Midwest and South.
   In the interview, Quayle was mildly critical of the coverage of
the campaign but generally satisfied that voters had been told what
they need in order to make a choice.
   ``I found out that, at least in my own case, sometimes I've
given what I think have been very susbtantative speeches. ... There
doesn't seem to be much interest in covering it,'' he said.
   ``The question is, have we been well-served? I think we know a
lot about Michael Dukakis and George Bsh. I think they really have
a very good idea of the four candidates.''
   Quayle said he's now more comfortable as a national candidate
because ``a national campaign is now something that's more behind
me than ahead of me.''
   That comfort level is increased because he's now settling into
the traditional role of a vice presidential candidate rather than a
lightning rod for controversy, he said.
   That point was underscored, he said, by a telephone call he
received from his wife, Marilyn, late in the week.
   ``She said `you must really be giving great speeches, having
great crowds, doing all the right things, because I haven't heard a
thing about you out here,''' he said. ``Welcome to the traditional
role of the vice presidential campaign.''
   Quayle said both of the presidential campaigns have dealt with
substantative issues.
   ``There have been a number of speeches, a number of debates,
probably too many speeches,'' he said. ``The information is out
there. The question is on how this information gets communicated.
   ``The question then becomes, what is being communicated? Is it
the 15-second sound bite?
   ``I'll be interested to find out what we've learned from this,''
he said. ``I think we've got to rethink it on both sides.
   ``You have to look at how television is used by both
campaigns,'' he said. ``It is very difficult to do in a
substantative way, even though there have been substantative
speeches.
   ``I'm sure we'll go back and there'll be new benchmarks,
there'll be new standards, maybe some old standards will be thrown
away.''

   Rep. Pat Swindall is attempting to beat an
Election Day deadline with his one-man, rush-to-justice defense in
a federal perjury trial that will climax one of the country's most
bitter congressional elections.
   If everything goes as expected, the two-term Republican
congressman will deliver his opening argument in U.S. District
Court on Monday, just one week after his indictment was handed up
and just 15 days before the Nov. 8 election.
   Swindall, a lawyer, is representing himself in the perjury case
and hopes a quick acquittal will bring victory at the polls.
   He has admitted to a mistake in judgment in negotiating an
$850,000 loan last year with an undercover agent posing as a
financier, but denies criminal wrongdoing. Eventually, Swindall
accepted a $150,000 check from a middleman, then returned it
uncashed.
   The 10 perjury charges brought against Swindall stem from his
testimony before a grand jury in February. Among other things,
Swindall testified he could not recall any mention of drug money;
tapes of the meetings have the agent saying the loan money was
probably drug-related.
   Swindall is facing the same challenger he did in 1986 in his bid
for a third term in the House. He calls it a race between ``a
Dukakis liberal and a Bush conservative.''
   Voters in the suburbs east of Atlanta will choose between
Swindall and Democrat Ben Jones, a one-time ``Dukes of Hazzard'' TV
star who has had to answer repeated questions from Swindall about
his admitted bout with alcoholism.
   Though Swindall demanded the speedy trial to obtain a verdict
before the election, he has stressed his disadvantage in manpower
and time to prepare for the trial, saying he will just have to rely
on the ``ol' innocent defense.''
   In fact, he will have more going for him, said lawyer Guy Davis,
a former policeman and prosecutor who was the Republican nominee
for governor in 1986. Davis has been a critic of Swindall but
expressed admiration for his tactics in the case.
   Davis said he has seen both laymen and lawyers successfully
defend themselves.
   ``Many defendants found that there was an advantage in that the
jury was continously being exposed to the defendant himself while
he conducts the trial,'' he said.
   If Swindall is a good courtroom performer, he said, he will be
able to impress his case on the jurors ``from the time the trial
starts, and not just from the time he takes the witness stand.''
   But Robert Fierer, who has handled a string of high-profile
criminal cases and represents another defendant in the
money-laundering probe, said that while Swindall may get the
underdog's sympathy from the jury, he is sacrificing some
potentially important options in rushing to trial.
   ``He really has given up investigative time, the time to go out
and find witnesses, to get prepared on witnesses, and that sort of
thing,'' Fierer said. Davis, however, noted that Swindall has had
access to transcripts of his meetings with the undercover agent for
some time, ``so he's probably, no doubt, well-prepared to go to
trial. And I think probably it is a wise thing for him to do.''
   And Davis said some pre-trial skirmishing over what can be used
in court and demands for information are not as crucial to Swindall
because ``in this case, the facts are fairly simple.''
   If the trial starts Monday, Swindall also gives up time for
pre-trial hearings that could have helped his defense, especially
on his claims that U.S. Attorney Robert Barr, also a Republican, is
promoting his career at Swindall's expense.
   U.S. District Judge Robert Vining ruled that Swindall may not
present those claims to the jury without conducting a pre-trial
hearing on whether Barr could be subpoenaed. Swindall hasn't
officially told the judge whether he wants the hearing, but he has
indicated he will not permit a delay in the trial.
   It will be up to the jury to decide whether Swindall can
reconcile the tapes of his meetings with the undercover agent with
his later grand jury testimony.
   Swindall has vowed to show his answers were not deceitful
because he simply could not remember everything said in the
negotiations.
   The 38-year-old congressman has had to curtail campaigning,
saying the trial has become the campaign's most important factor.
   His pre-indictment polls, he said, found a dead heat. Jones'
campaign manager, Maren Hesla, disagreed.
   ``Congressman Swindall has attempted to make the verdict the
election, but that's just not the case,'' Ms. Hesla said. ``We
enjoyed an 18-point lead prior to the indictment.''
   Jones, who has acknowledged a conviction for assault on his wife
during the days he was battling alcoholism, has been quiet about
his opponent's criminal case. Ms. Hesla acknowledged that Jones has
lost news media attention because of the focus on Swindall's case.
``We're doing what we can to be out there meeting the voters right
now,'' she said.

   Here is the text of President Reagan's weekly
radio address delivered Saturday from Camp David, Md.:
   My fellow Americans, Abraham Lincoln once said, ``You can't fool
all of the people all of the time.'' Well, this week, our liberal
friends have been trying to prove him wrong.
   They've charged that our record of lowering your taxes, ending
runaway inflation, and igniting the longest peacetime economic
expansion ever, has been bad for middle class working Americans.
   Well, it's time to remind them of a few facts.
   For example, the misery index: the miserly index was an election
year gimmick they cooked up for the 1976 campaign by adding the
unemployment and inflation rates. It came to 13.4 percent in 1976,
and they declared that no one had a right to seek reelection with a
misery index that high.
   Well, four years later, in the 1980 campaign, they didn't
mention the misery index, perhaps because it had grown to almost 21
percent. And this year, they still aren't mentioning it. Under us,
it's dropped to under 10 percent.
   Our liberal friends have been hopping around the country,
charging that real family income is no higher today than it was 20
years ago. Now, in fact, it's 14 percent higher. But why would they
bring family income up at all? After all, between 1977 and 1981 _
maybe you can guess why I picked those years _ the typical American
family's income, after taking out inflation, fell seven percent.
   Think of what it would mean to you and your family if somebody
were to cut your family's paychecks by that much today.
   Think of how much less you could buy at the grocery store, the
clothes you couldn't get for your children, how much less you could
put in the plate at your church or synagogue each week.
   And then, think of this: since 1981, when we came to office, the
typical family's income, after taking out inflation, has soared
more than 10 percent.
   One place you can see what this change means to you is in
housing. Our liberal friends have been talking a great deal about
affordable housing recently. Don't they remember that in 1980, as
housing prices and interest rates skyrocketed together, one of the
few times in history that's happened, and real family incomes
plummeted, the American dream of owning a home almost went down for
the count.
   And the top housing official of the previous administration
finally threw up his hands in despair and said, ``For many
hard-working families, housing is growing beyond their reach,''
   Yes, according to real estate industry economists in 1980, the
average American family made just over three-fourths of what it
needed to buy a home. Today, with interest rates half of what they
were and inflation under control, the typical American family makes
over 110 percent of what it needs to buy home.
   Renters are also doing better. When the liberals left office,
the national vacancy rates for apartments in the price range of low
and medium income families were around five percent, which means it
had become hard for low and medium income Americans to find an
apartment. Today, these national vacancy rates are around eight
percent, and it's the landlords who are having to wait longer to
find tenants.
   Add this all up and you see that we have more, much more,
affordable housing today then we had eight years ago.
   You'd think all these facts would give our liberal opponents
pause, but apparently not.
   When we note that since our expansion began, America has created
more than 18 million new jobs, that unemployment is nearly the
lowest it's been in 14 years, and that a greater proportion of
Americans are at work today than ever before in our history, the
liberals blandly respond that what we need are ``good jobs at good
wages.''
   Perhaps they believe that most Americans have bad jobs. I don't
believe that, and to tell the truth, I find remarks that put down
honest occupations _ yes, including short-order chefs _ offensive,
and I expect you do too. In any event, overall, job for job, the
jobs created since our expansion began pay more than the jobs that
existed before.
   The liberals charge that we've given tax breaks to the wealthy,
but when we came to office, the wealthy were paying 19.3 percent of
the federal individual income tax revenues. Now it's 26 percent.
   The charges go on and on, but the truth remains the same. No
matter how you look at it, the last time they were in office, the
liberals clobbered the American middle class and we stopped them.
   Some are calling this last-ditch opposition campaign an attempt
at ``class warfare.''
   So, what's new? Our liberal friends have been at war with
America's middle class for years. Now they want you to turn the
other cheek, but will they just take that as an opportunity to
really let you have it.
   Mainstream America is in better shape today than it's ever been.
Why would we ever want to put it back in the hands of those who
almost turned out its lights?
   Until next week, thanks for listening and God bless you.

   Here is the text of the Democratic response to
President Reagan's weekly radio address Saturday, from Senate
Majority Leader Robert C. Byrd of West Virginia:
   In less than three weeks, the American people will elect a new
president. It may be the most important election of this century.
   On the surface, this election has been a series of negative TV
ads, quicky polls and instant experts. The ads, the polls, and the
experts seem to be driving the process.
   Most Americans are unhappy with what they are seeing on their
televisions. We are a big people and we want a wide view of what's
at stake in this election. Everything important to the American
people cannot be reduced to a seven-second sound bite.
   The ads on television aren't going to tell you much of anything.
A little music, some flag waving, and then ``poof'' the ad is over.
   It's time to look beneath the surface and start asking the
important questions.
   We need a president who tends to the nation's business; who has
a sense of the future.
   We need a president who has a plan for making the trade deficit
a trade surplus; who is willing to make a real commitment to ending
the policy of borrow and debt that has put us into a sea of red ink.
   We need a president who wants to keep America strong and who
knows that economic power and military strength go hand in hand. We
need a president who believes in America so much that he is not
afraid to tell us we have problems that need fixing.
   We need a president who ways the same thing in public that he
says in private and who won't make secret deals with the Ayatollah.
   Two years ago, the American people put the Democrats back in
charge of the Senate. We won in 1986 because we told the American
people we would make a difference in their lives.
   Our agenda was clear and exact: check and balance a White House
that seemed to have lost its way. We delivered despite two years of
confrontation.
   When the American people asked for a clean water bill, we
delivered despite a White House that said no.
   When American workers wanted a new trade bill and jobs for
Americans, we delivered despite a White House that said no.
   When the American people demanded fairness on plant closing, we
delivered despite a White House that said no.
   When the American people demanded an end to the ``slash and
burn'' education policy of the White House, it was the Congress
that said yes.
   So who is in the mainstream of American politics? A look at the
record of the Democratic Congress will answer that question.
   This Congress has tried to be a ``family'' Congress. We have
tackled the problems that people talk about when they sit around
the kitchen table.
   For our senior citizens, we have expanded Medicare to include
catastrophic health insurance.
   For two-paycheck families, we fought for parental leave and
child care bills, only to run into a White House filibuster.
   For millions of working men and women, we fought for an increase
in the minimum wage despite White House opposition.
   For our nation's security, we fought against waste and fraud in
the Pentagon.
   As majority leader of the Senate Democrats, I take pride in the
work of the 100th Congress. We have done our duty. We have
addressed your concerns. We have listened to the people.
   Harry Truman once said that ``polls are like sleeping pills
designed to lull voters into sleeping on election day.''
   Don't let the polls lull you to sleep. Don't let the political
hucksters pick the next president.
   Look beneath the surface. Look to the record. Vote for the
future. Remember that America is always at its best when we face
our problems and never stand still.
   Thank you and God Bless You.

<HEAD>Reagan Hits Dukakis on Jobs, Byrd Says Democrats Champion of
Middle Class</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SUSANNE SCHAFER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Reagan ridiculed presidential
candidate Michael Dukakis' campaign theme of ``good jobs at good
wages'' on Saturday, asserting it is a cover for the belief ``that
most Americans have bad jobs.''
   President Reagan's weekly radio address from Camp David, Md.,
followed the pattern of recent weeks in which he has launched an
entirely partisan attack against the ``liberals'' in this year's
election campaign.
   While Reagan contended that the Republican Party was the
champion of the middle class, Senate Majority Leader Robert C. Byrd
of West Virginia also claimed that honor in the Democratic response.
   ``As majority leader of the Senate Democrats, I take pride in
the work of the 100th Congress. We have done our duty. We have
addressed your concerns. We have listened to the people,'' Byrd
said in an address relayed only hours after the Congress had
adjourned for the year.
   The senator said the Democratic-led Congress fulfilled a
specific agenda: ``check and balance a White House that seemed to
have lost its way. We delivered despite two years of
confrontation.''
   In his address, Reagan did not mention Dukakis or the GOP
candidate, Vice President George Bush, by name, but his target was
clear.
   Using his favorite catch-word for the Democratic Party, Reagan
asserted that ``our liberal friends'' in the campaign have no
response to the nation's robust economy or its low unemployment
rate.
   Reagan and Bush have repeatedly boasted that ``more than 18
million new jobs'' have been created during the economic expansion.
   But Dukakis has countered with the charge that many of the jobs
created during the Reagan presidency have been minimum-wage
positions, such as those in the fast-food industry.
   ``The liberals blandly respond that what we need are good jobs
at good wages,'' Reagan said. ``Perhaps they actually believe that
most American have bad jobs.''
   ``I don't believe that. And to tell the truth, I find remarks
that put down honest occupations _ and that's including short order
chefs _ offensive. And I expect you do too,'' Reagan added.
   ``The jobs created since our expansion began pay more than the
jobs that existed before,'' he said.
   Reagan also tried to counter Democratic charges that his
administration has given tax breaks to the wealthy by asserting
that the middle class has flourished under his administration.
   Charging that ``our liberal friends have been at war with the
American middle class for years,'' Reagan argued that ``mainstream
America is in better shape today than it's ever been. Why would we
want to put it back in the hands of those who almost turned out its
lights?''
   For his part, Byrd contended that the Democratic Congress has
dealt with ``the problems that people talk about when they sit
around the kitchen table.''
   Byrd said the Congress had expanded Medicare to include
catastrophic health insurance, fought for parental leave and child
care bills, and tried to obtain ``an increase in the minimum wage
despite White House opposition.''
   ``Harry Truman once said that ``polls are like sleeping pills
designed to lull voters into sleeping on election day,'' Byrd said.
``Don't let the polls lull you to sleep. Don't let the political
hucksters pick the next president.
   ``Look beneath the surface. Look to the record. Vote for the
future. Remember that America is always at its best when we face
our problems and never stand still,'' he said.

<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Here is a chronology of major events in the attempts to free the
three trapped whales in Barrow, Alaska:
   Oct. 13 _ The California gray whales were discovered trapped in
the ice east of Point Barrow. They apparently became stuck a week
before. Biologists were unable to contact an icebreaker to give aid.
   Oct. 14 _ The whales continued to swim several hundred feet
offshore, using two holes in the ice to breathe. Biologists
believed time was running out for the grays as nighttime
temperatures dropped to 13 degrees below zero, threatening to
shrink the whales' breathing space. Efforts failed again to contact
an icebreaking ship.
   Oct. 18 _ A biologist said one whale may have pneumonia, as an
Alaska Army National Guard Skycrane helicopter went to tow a
185-ton Hovercraft-type icebreaking barge 200 miles northwest to
the whales. President Reagan telephoned with his support.
   Oct. 19 _ Eskimos cut new holes in ice, but the barge effort was
hampered by shallow water. Biologists said the whales' health
appeared to be stabilized, and that they were handling their
captivity better than first believed.
   Oct. 20 _ The barge began its journey but moved only about six
miles through sand bars, mud and shallow water. Two Minnesota
brothers-in-law arrive with de-icers to enlarge breathing holes for
whales.
   Oct. 21 _ One of the whales, nicknamed ``Bone,'' disappeared and
was presumed dead. Rescuers tried ``Plan B:'' A five-ton concrete
``bullet'' wielded by a helicopter loaned by the Alaska Army
National Guard. Easterly wind opened ``leads,'' or open water,
through the ice within four miles of the whales. The Soviet Union
offered an icebreaker to help in the rescue.
   Oct. 22 _ Eskimos using chain saws had led the whales almost a
half-mile closer to open water by carving a string of 24 breathing
holes in the ice. The Skycrane dropping its ``bullet'' had punched
four 15-to-20-foot holes in the ice at 75-yard intervals, but a
massive pressure ridge of ice stood in the way.

<HEAD>Bentsen Warns Texas Voters Against Ticket Splitting</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEVEN KOMAROW</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>GILMER, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lloyd Bentsen warned his fellow Texans on
Saturday against ticket splitting to support him for the Senate and
Republican George Bush for president in hopes of giving powerful
jobs to two men with ties to the state.
   ``Some Republicans ... are trying to peddle the notion that you
can vote twice for Texas,'' Bentsen told a union audience in
Beaumont as he stumped with Democratic presidential nominee Michael
Dukakis. ``Have you heard that one?''
   It was a rare acknowledgement of the political problem tied to
his dual candidacies for vice president and re-election to the
Senate from Texas.
   ``A vote for George Bush is a vote for Dan Quayle, and a vote
for Dan Quayle sure isn't a vote for Lloyd Bentsen. A vote for
George Bush or Dan Quayle makes no sense if you care for Texas,''
he said.
   ``A vote for George Bush is a vote against a strong energy
policy that will bring this state back,'' he said.
   Under Texas law, Bentsen is allowed to run for both the vice
presidency and the Senate. He has said he would resign from the
Senate if he and Dukakis win, but he was staying in that race
because resigning would automatically hand the seat to Republican
opponent Beau Boulter for six years. A resignation, on the other
hand, would force a special election.
   Bentsen made his comments at a joint rally with Dukakis in a
packed hall owned by the local pipefitters union, whose members are
highly dependant on the oil and gas industry. East Texas is a
traditionally Democratic part of the state and the Dukakis-Bentsen
ticket needs to win big there to have any chance of carrying the
state and its 29 electoral votes on Nov. 8.
   Mike McCurry, Bentsen's press secretary, said the senator spoke
up because some news editorials in Texas had suggested that Texans
support the Republicans for president and Bentsen for the Senate,
instead of his Republican opponent Beau Boulter.
   Some Bush supporters, who also like Bentsen, have been making
that suggestion to boost ticket splitting. The polls show Bentsen a
handy winner in his Senate race but the Democrats behind in the
presidential race and they don't want Texas supporters of Bentsen
to feel satisfied by just supporting him for the Senate.
   After campaigning together in Beaumont, Dukakis and Bentsen went
their separate ways and Bentsen traveled north to Gilmer for the
annual ``Yamboree'' celebrating the year's crop of yams before
heading on to Missouri.
   On a stage decorated with bushels of yams and some pumpkins,
Bentsen told a crowd of several hundred people, not to listen to
Republican ads claiming that the Democrats wanted to take away
their guns and were weak on defense. He took particular umbrage at
a Republican Party ad featuring former test pilot Chuck Yeager
saying the Democrats were bad for the defense industry, which is a
major employer in Texas.
   ``I decided he set some of those high altitude records and
forgot to turn on his oxygen,'' Bentsen said.
   Orange-lettered signs proclaimed ``Yammin' with
Dukakis-Bentsen'' as the senator spoke and then rode around town in
a convertible waving at the friendly thousands attending the
festival.
   There was some disagreement in the campaign entourage as whether
there was any real difference between yams and sweet potatoes, and
Bentsen was asked what he thought the difference was.
   ``Well, I don't know,'' he said. ``But I'm yam proud to be
here.''

<DATELINE>GREAT BARRINGTON, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In a marathon worthy of Captain
Ahab's pursuit of the Great White Whale, a group of high school
students staged a 21-hour reading of ``Moby Dick,'' the classic
novel of man against whale.
   The fund-raising event Thursday through Friday kept 19 students
at Monument Mountain Regional High School immersed in whaling
music, a film version of the novel and Herman Melville's book.
   ``I'm going to bed for a little while because I have a soccer
game tomorrow, well today, actually,'' Margo Hamilton said early
Friday. ``I don't know if this helps to read the book, but it's
more fun.''
   Beginning Thursday afternoon, each student and teacher Trudy
Ames took turns reading chapters. They finished about noon Friday.
   Ames said she planned the reading of the novel set partly in
nearby locales, ``as a way of getting the students enthusiastic
about the book. I like the idea of oral reading and I think it's
important that they listen to each other read, too.''
   To set the mood, whaling music was played and a videotape of the
film ``Moby Dick'' played 14 times through the night.
   Money raised by the reading will help the students pay for a
whale watching trip or a visit to a whaling museum. Each student
sought out sponsors for the marathon, so Ames said she had no idea
yet how much money was raised.

   A man responding to a message recorded
on his office telephone answering machine went home and found his
wife and two children dead.
   Authorities believe Debra Sue Humphrey, 35, distraught about
recent marital problems, killed her 9-year-old son and 5-year-old
daughter before committing suicide Thursday or early Friday.
   William L. Humphrey discovered the bodies Friday morning, said
Lt. Lynn Moore of the Jefferson County Sheriff's Department.
   Humphrey, who apparently had been separated from his wife a
short time, discovered the message early Friday when he arrived at
work.
   The message warned him that something was wrong at home, so he
drove over and found his son, Brandon Michael, and his daughter,
Tiffany Lenor Humphrey, lying dead beside his wife, Moore said.
   Moore declined to disclose the specific content of the recorded
message.
   All three had been shot with a handgun that was recovered at the
home, along with a suicide note, sheriff's Sgt. Eddie White said.
   ``She left a note, at this time we are looking at it as a double
murder and suicide,'' he said.
   White declined to reveal the contents of the note but said it
``basically was just expressing the situation in general. She
regretted doing it and knew it was an immoral act.''
   ``I've never been so shocked in my life,'' said Georgia
Shoemaker, a neighbor. ``I just can't imagine. She seemed so crazy
about those kids.''

   Authorities arrested a Lebanese woman who
was carrying pictures of three Americans held hostage in Lebanon
and a letter from one of them in a false bottom in her suitcase,
police said Saturday.
   The woman stopped Thursday at Milan's Linate Airport was
carrying photos of Terry Anderson, Thomas Sutherland and Alann
Steen, said Fortunato Finoli, deputy director of the Milan police
anti-terrorist unit.
   He said the photographs were to be given to an Italian
businessman, who was not identified.
   She also carried a handwritten letter signed by Steen, he said.
She was arrested and charged with carrying $1,000 in counterfeit
U.S. bills and 50 grams of heroin, Finoli said.
   A U.S. Embassy spokesman contacted by telephone said officials
there had been informed about the incident.
   ``Yes, we are aware of it. It's in the Italian hands,'' he said.
Asked if the Italian businessman had any connection with the U.S.
government, he said: ``We're not saying a thing about it.'' He
spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Police refused to say who was to ultimately receive the pictures
and documents, or why.
   The woman arrived on a Middle East Airlines flight from Beirut
and her suitcase was examined thoroughly, like those of many other
Lebanese passengers, police said.
   Police also questioned the businessman, who was waiting for the
woman at the airport, but freed him because he committed no crime,
according to Finoli.
   It was not clear when the large, black-and-white head shots of
the three hostages had been taken, Finoli said, adding that police
were examining them. It was also not known when the letter from
Steen was written, he said.
   The letter was addressed to the Italian businessman and simply
``expressed thanks to everyone who was working for his (Steen's)
liberation,'' Finoli said.
   He said the woman, a Maronite Catholic identified as Aline
Ibrahim Rizkalah, 36, apparently worked as a courier for different
people in Lebanon. She told police she knew nothing about the
photos or documents.
   The woman said the Italian businessman was to give her money,
but he denied it, police said.
   Finoli refused to elaborate on the Italian's identity, saying
only that he was from the northern part of the country and ``well
known for other things.''
   The other documents in the woman's luggage were written in
Italian but were in a kind of code, which police were trying to
decipher, Finoli said. They did not mention the hostages, he said.
   He refused to release any more details.
   The arrest occurred before Islamic Jihad threatened to hurt the
hostages in retaliation for an Israeli air raid on Lebanon Friday.
   Islamic Jihad, a pro-Iranian fundamentalist faction, is believed
to hold Anderson and Sutherland, while Steen's abduction has been
claimed by the pro-Iranian Islamic Jihad for the Liberation of
Palestine.
   Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent for The Associated
Press, is the longest-held foreign hostage in Lebanon. He was
kidnapped March 16, 1985.
   Sutherland, acting dean of agriculture at the American
University of Beirut, was abducted three months later. He is of
Fort Collins, Colo.
   Steen, of Boston, was kidnapped on Jan. 24, 1987 at Beirut
University College, where he taught.
   They are among nine Americans believed held by pro-Iranian
extremist factions linked to Hezbollah, or Party of God. Others
believed held are three Britons, an Irishman and an Italian.

<HEAD>Three Arrests Follow Widow's Plea For Justice</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Police arrested three teen-agers following a
plea for justice from an Israeli immigrant who was slashed and
raped with her teen-age daughter after her husband was strangled.
   ``I have been left with nothing,'' the widow said in an
interview published Friday by Yediot Ahronot, a newspaper in
Israel. ``Now all I want is for them to find my husband's killers,
and to go back to Israel immediately.''
   Police said Saturday they had arrested Angel Diaz, 17, Dutval
Guzman, 15, and Victor Sanchez, 17, all of the Bronx, and charged
them as adults with murder, robbery, burglary and rape. Two other
suspects were being sought, police said.
   ``How, how could God give these people the ability to be such
sadists?'' the widow said in the Yediot Ahronot interview.
   It appeared the suspects killed their former employer in a money
dispute, stole the keys to his apartment, then went there and
attacked his wife and daughter, according to Capt. Thomas Fahey, a
police spokesman. Police declined to elaborate on the dispute.
   The names of the victims were withheld because sex crimes were
involved, said Sgt. Raymond O'Donnell, a police spokesman. However,
he said the 50-year-old man and his family had emigrated here from
Israel about eight years ago.
   The body of the man, a limousine driver and former contractor,
was found slumped in the seat of his car about 3 a.m. Tuesday in
the Bronx. He had been stabbed and strangled.
   About 2 a.m. Tuesday, a gang of youths wearing Halloween masks
entered the man's apartment in Brooklyn and attacked his wife and
teen-age daughter, police said.
   The woman told Yediot Ahronot that she and her daughter were
taken to separate rooms, handcuffed to beds and raped repeatedly.
``Where is the money? Where is your husband?'' they screamed _ but
did not say that her husband had been left for dead.
   The woman said the attackers also threatened to kill her
3-year-old daughter. ``I bit my lips and I knew that if I shouted,
they would kill the baby,'' she said.
   ``They cut them up and threatened them,'' said Judy Mause, a
family friend. ``They were terrified. The daughter is in bad shape.
... She is ruined.''
   The attackers also ransacked and robbed the apartment,
reportedly taking jewelry and $6,000 cash. A 14-year-old son was
away at the time of the attack.
   The man had owned a general contracting business at one point
and had employed Diaz, Guzman and Sanchez, O'Donnell said.
   Diaz was arrested about Friday evening at a Bronx hospital where
his girlfriend was having a baby. The other two arrests were late
Friday and early Saturday, police said.

<TEXT>
   Eddie Haskell joined Wally, June and the
Beaver before the two-story Cleaver home to mark the grand opening
of Universal Studios Florida, where ``The New Leave It To Beaver''
series will be produced.
   ``Hey, we're really excited about being here,'' Tony Dow, who
plays Wally Cleaver, told reporters Friday. ``The set looks great,
don't you think?''
   Standing before the familiar Cleaver home, which was trucked in
from Universal Studios in Hollywood, executive producer Brian
Levant introduced the cast members as they emerged one by one
through the front door.
   Mindful of tradition, Levant said as he announced the members of
the original cast: ``Barbara Billingsley ... Tony Dow ... Ken
Osmond .. and Jerry Mathers as the Beaver.''
   The arrival of the show at Universal Studios Florida was marked
by the ceremonial mounting of the Cleavers' house number _ 211.
   The numbers were hammered in and removed three times for the
benefit of TV crews who may have missed it.
   ``This is the day we've looked forward to for many, many years,
the beginning of production at Universal Studios Florida,'' studio
president Steven Lew said.
   Everything except the sidewalk (painted plywood) in front of the
Cleaver house came from Hollywood _ even the brown leaves (real
leaves) that were strewn about to simulate autumn.
   Once inside, the cast wandered around their home.
   Mathers looked through curtains to the back yard.
   ``Gee, here we are in Florida and we have the same neighbors,''
he said, looking out at a wall mural of homes and yards.
   Much of the 444-acre movie-television complex is still being
built. But ``The New Leave It To Beaver,'' which airs on cable's
SuperStation TBS, will produce 19 episodes this season in the
22,000-square-foot sound stage, which means the cast and crew will
be in Central Florida until March.
   The original ``Leave It To Beaver'' began in October 1957 on
CBS, then moved to ABC in October 1958, where the sitcom ran until
September 1963. Twenty years later, CBS aired a TV-movie titled
``Still the Beaver,'' which in turn spawned a series of the same
title on the Disney channel in 1984.
   Disney droped the Cleavers after two seasons, but Ted Turner
soon ordered 74 episodes for his cable station, which could keep
the series on the air until the early 1990s.
   Economy was a big factor in the move east. Michael Houbrick, a
spokesman for the show, said last season might have been the show's
last if it had to continue production on the West Coast, where
union wages are considerably higher than in Florida.
   The cast has nothing but praise for local hospitality and the
Universal facility. The studios in California were ``musty'' and
leaked, Mathers said.
   ``Every time it rained we had to move from one set to another.''
   Levant, however, said he sees few differences between Hollywood
East and West.
   ``We've still got to hide the palm trees when we go outside,
same as California.''

   The mother superior and five
Carmelite nuns who rebelled against her by barricading themselves
in their monastery have extended their period of seclusion, a nun
at the monastery said Saturday.
   The nuns locked themselves in the infirmary at the Monastery of
the Most Blessed Virgin Mary of Mount Carmel on Oct. 4. They fear
expulsion for opposing liberalizations at the cloister, including
the introduction of sweets, radio and television.
   Mother Theresa Hewitt says the dispute centers on the five nuns'
refusal to obey her. There are 13 nuns at the monastery.
   On Thursday, Mother Hewitt and Sister John of the Cross, one of
the five nuns, announced they would not speak to the media for two
days while both sides prayed for an end to the dispute.
   Sister Maria, a member of the Carmel who does not live at the
monastery, said Mother Hewitt has extended the period of seclusion
and prayer until Monday. The barricaded nuns agreed, she said.
   ``Mother Theresa wants the media to stay away and they all want
to get some rest,'' Sister Maria said.

<HEAD>ITT Announces Intention To Plead Guilty In Defense Case</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The ITT Corp. will plead guilty Monday to treating
an Air Force employee to meals and golf greens fees to allegedly
obtain inside information for two Air Force contracts worth $180
million, the company said.
   ``Quite frankly, while we don't condone what the (ITT) employee
did, it was fairly minor in the scheme of things,'' ITT spokesman
Jim Gallagher said Friday.
   The corporate guilty plea, to charges it conspired to defraud
the government, could result in a fine up to $500,000.
   The New York-based company's plans were disclosed in a statement
which says the case is not related to the recently publicized
Justice Department investigation of defense contractors, The Boston
Globe reported Saturday.
   ``It's somewhat prototypical of the kind of cases that one can
expect,'' said U.S. Attorney Frank McNamara. ``You have a lot of
the same elements and it shows in a kind of generic way how the
game is played.''
   ITT was indicted in June 1987, several months before the
investigation began of defense contractors' use of consultants to
get information for use in bidding for contracts.
   The indictment said ITT treated an Air Force employee at Hanscom
Air Force Base in suburban Bedford to golf greens fees, baseball
tickets, meals and liquor in exchange for information used to bid
on contracts.
   The ITT announcement follows a guilty plea to similar charges
entered last July by Edward M. Vicenzi, a former senior marketing
representative of the company's Gilfillan subsidiary in Van Nuys,
Calif.
   Federal prosecutors dropped three other counts in the indictment
accusing ITT of transmitting Air Force documents from Bedford to
ITT Gilfillan, the Globe reported.
   ITT Gilfillan won a preliminary $6.4 million development
contract for a missile decoy system that would lure homing missiles
away from Air Force radar sites. It also sought a contract for a
mobile air traffic control radar system.
   Neither system was built.
   However, the indictment alleged that Vicenzi obtained several
documents relating to the two programs from Maurice W. Raciti, a
deputy program manager in logistics in the Tactical Program office
at the Electronics System Division at Hanscom.
   Raciti, a 31-year veteran federal employee, resigned in late
1986 after being suspended by Air Force officials pending a federal
investigation. No charges have been filed against him.
   Vicenzi also has pleaded guilty to a separate charge of paying a
government employee $300 to make changes in a bid for a contract
sought by Emerson Electric Co. of St. Louis.
   Vicenzi has not been sentenced in either case. The charges
against him involve maximum penalties of up to 35 years in prison
and $500,000 in fines.

   Parliament on Saturday approved a
package of constitutional amendments designed to make the economy
more market-oriented and ease the worst economic crisis since World
War II.
   The amendments also would give Serbia more control over its
autonomous provinces of Kosovo and Vojvodina. The crisis has been
fueled by hundreds of thousands of Serbs protesting the alleged
harassment of Serbs in Kosovo by the majority ethnic Albanians.
   Adoption of the 34 measures was largely symbolic, since strong
opposition is expected when they are submitted to for approval by
the legislatures of each of Yugoslavia's six republics and two
provinces.
   The government meanwhile approved price increases of up to 53
percent on meat and 60 percent on bread, two days after Parliament
eased an unpopular austerity program by allowing salary raises for
some workers.
   The wage increases of between 140 percent and 152 percent for
this year will only partially compensate for falling living
standards because inflation is now at 217 percent.
   Meat prices were boosted just three weeks ago. Last year, the
government had to cancel sharp increases in bread prices after
widespread protests.
   The economic amendments were designed to help ease a crisis that
has reduced living standards by one-half since 1980.
   They provide for less state interference, greater private and
foreign investment and more market mechanisms in the economy, such
as closing unprofitable enterprises and sacking unnecessary or
undisciplined workers.
   The moves to give Serbia more control over Vojvodina and Kosovo
and a controversial proposal for army financing are likely to meet
particularly stiff resistance in regional legislatures.
   Serbia would increase its control over Kosovo's largely ethnic
Albanian judiciary, which Serbs contend is biased against them.
   The reforms also would require Kosovo pupils to study according
to programs drawn up in Serbia. The object is to broaden the
non-Albanian cultural background given to ethnic Albanian pupils.
   Kosovo and Vojvodina, administratively parts of the republic of
Serbia, have strenuously resisted Serbian communist leader Slobodan
Milosevic's efforts to curtail their autonomy.
   Serbs have held dozens of massive rallies to voice their support
for the constitutional reforms in the past five months, and
Vojvodina's party leadership was forced to resign this month over
the issue.
   The amendments also would allow the budget of the armed forces
to be replenished from funds of the republics in case of a
shortfall in the federal budget.
   The liberal northern republic of Slovenia has refused to endorse
the proposal.
   The army, which now is financed from the federal budget, long
has complained that triple-digit inflation is eating into its funds
and forcing it to take out loans from state banks to enable it to
continue operating.
   The constitutional proposals would amend about one-third of
Yugoslavia's 1974 constitution, said to be the world's longest with
406 articles.
   The amendments, due to be adopted by republican and provincial
legislatures by Nov. 29, the national holiday, are seen as an
interim solution before a ``new and modern'' constitution is
drafted, the state news agency Tanjug said.
   Stipe Suvar, who holds the annually rotating chairmanship of the
ruling Communist party, said last week a new draft constitution may
be ready for discussion by the next national party congress in 1990.

   Claude Montana perfected his A-line chic and
Givenchy turned out his peppiest clothes in several seasons during
Saturday shows for next summer's ready-to-wear.
   Jean-Paul Gaultier's collection drew gasps and occasional
laughter with designs that ranged from a bawdy-house look to a
traveling circus act.
   Everything was long and beautiful by Montana, who showed only a
few skirts between trousers shaped like fluid inverted cones. He
also showed an occasional pair of wide, cuffed linen shorts.
   He kept to a muted tone of greys, browns and dusty pinks. The
high-waisted trousers he has done before but they never looked
better.
   Montana showed silk jumpsuits and flowing skirts with tops
draped in silk chiffon fichus, sometimes off the shoulder.
   Some toppers had floppy lapels, others had swooped, stitched
necklines and natural shoulderlines.
   The sophisticated outfits also had vest fronts with open backs
crossed by straps.
   Everything was sleek and easy. Jackets often had a long flared
look from an easily fitted bodice. Square-necked sundress tops were
like trapeze dresses over pants.
   While all the day clothes were dressy, evening clothes were
anything but show-off. Usually in austere black, they had lacquered
lace and net cut-outs in the bodices over swirling chiffon skirts.
   Givenchy delivered a collection to keep his Palm Beach-to-Paris
clients happy. There were short skirts and pants or skirt suits
came out with a snug silhouette.
   These silk, smooth wool and pique outfits looked peppy with very
wide, white piping all over, creating a clean look in navy with
white or yellow. Chunky or big pastille buttons also brightened up
the scene.
   With circular necks and slightly blousing tops, the silk
flower-print dresses were completely Givenchy. Even more striking
were the widely-striped silks with stand-out capped sleeves, square
necks and straight short skirts.
   Jean-Paul Gaultier threw caution to the wind after showing more
conventional clothes last season. He sees the upcoming nineties as
naughty, with lacy corsets, jackets open to reveal bosoms and shiny
tight pants.
   There was a full line of underwear dressing including a
multicolored girdle tunic and a clinging girdle dress with a bra
top.
   The finale was based on multi-suspenders and garters covering
the colorful elasticized jersey or satin body suits underneath.

   Leftist guerrillas attacked two small
police stations in the south with machine guns and anti-tank
rockets, killing a corporal and wounding a local farmer, police
said Saturday.
   They were the first significant terrorist actions since
right-wing President Augusto Pinochet lost an Oct. 5 referendum on
extending his rule to 1997.
   According to a national police statement, eight guerrillas
opened fire Friday night with machine guns and M-16 rifles on a
small frontier post in Los Quenes, in the Andes foothills 20 miles
east of the city of Curico.
   The guerrillas then set a police building afire, destroying it
and a police jeep, the statement said. It said the gunfire killed a
corporal, Juvenal Vargas, and wounded a farmer visiting the post,
Fernando Garcia.
   An hour earlier, other guerrillas fired two anti-tank rockets at
another police post in Pichipellahuen, 55 miles southwest of the
town of Traiguen, the communique said. There were no injuries
reported in the attack.
   The communique blamed both attacks on the communist Manuel
Rodriguez Patriotic Front.
   A spokeswoman for a dissident faction of the front called
foreign news agencies in Santiago to claim responsibility for the
actions, saying they represented the start of a ``national
patriotic war.''
   Interior Minister Carlos Caceres called the police officer's
death ``an extremely cold terrorist act'' and called on Chileans
``to understand that this country wants to achieve democracy on a
peaceful level.''
   Caceres was named Friday, when Pinochet replaced half of his
Cabinet's 16 members in a shake-up prompted by Pinochet's
800,000-ballot loss in his bid to extend his term.
   The 72-year-old army commander seized power in a 1973 coup.
   Under the constitution, Pinochet remains in power until March
1990. The winner of open elections planned for December 1989 will
take over.
   While swearing in his new ministers, Pinochet firmly rejected
opposition calls to step down early and for consitutional reforms.
   Opposition leaders said his declaration and new Cabinet choices
dashed their hopes for prompt negotiations on the reforms.
   `The Cabinet is the same, only the names are different,'' said
Andres Zaldivar, vice-president of the centrist Christian
Democratic Party, the country's largest. ``It doesn't ... reflect
the feeling of the immense majority of Chileans who voted `no' on
Oct. 5.''
   Zaldivar, however, called on the opposition's ranks to ``keep a
cool head and firm nerves'' and not to resort to violent actions.
The coalition has repeatedly condemned leftist terrorist actions,
saying they provide an excuse for government repression.
   Ricardo Lagos, a prominent Socialist, noted that two army
generals, Public Works Minister Bruno Siebert and Economy Minister
Manuel Concha, and a retired navy admiral, Defense Minister
Patricio Carvajal, were retained while generals from the air force
and national police were ousted.
   The air force and national police are considered more
politically moderate than the navy or Pinochet's fiercely loyal
army.

   Twelve thousand law officers stood at attention
Saturday outside a church where a funeral Mass was held for two
city policemen who were shot in separate incidents within hours of
each other.
   Busloads of New York City police officers, their shields draped
with black mourning bands, were joined outside Our Lady of
Perpetual Help church by colleagues from around the state and from
Massachusetts, New Jersey and Connecticut.
   They stood 10 deep, filling more than six blocks of the Bay
Ridge neighborhood of Brooklyn. Hundreds of civilians also stood
behind police barricades surrounding the church.
   While the mourners waited outside in chilly, windy weather, a
wedding proceeded inside the church _ an event planned nine months
ago.
   Christopher Hoban, 26, an undercover officer from Bay Ridge, was
shot in the head and chest Tuesday night during a Manhattan drug
raid. Michael Buczek, 24, a highly decorated street officer who
lived in Suffern, was killed less than three hours later while he
and his partner pursued a suspect in Harlem.
   ``We will never turn this city over to those demons of death who
would take all our lives for a few coins of gold,'' Police
Commissioner Benjamin Ward told the mourners.
   Department officials called it the largest police funeral in
city history. It also was the first time in the department's
history that a double funeral had been held for officers killed in
separate incidents.
   There was silence when two hearses arrived _ broken by the slow
beat of drums from the police band. A lone bagpiper played
``Amazing Grace'' while the flag-covered caskets were carried up
the church steps.
   ``It seems fitting for Michael and Christopher to lie together
in this church because they shared so many common bonds,'' the Rev.
Victor Ulto said in an homily. ``Christopher and Michael shared a
vision that life could be better.''
   The mourners included Mayor Edward I. Koch, U.S. Sen. Daniel
Patrick Moynihan, U.S. Attorney Rudolph Giuliani, Manhattan Borough
President David Dinkins, Queens Borough President Claire Shulman
and City Council President Andrew Stein.
   At one point during the funeral, Koch held his head in his hands
and appeared to be sobbing.
   ``The social contract, even with criminals, was always that you
didn't kill cops,'' Koch said later in an address to mourners.
``Now, they go out of their way to kill cops.''
   In closing, Ulto said, ``I plead to each and every police
officer here: please remain faithful to your calling. ... Stand
true to what officers Michael Buczek and Christopher Hoban lived
and died for.''
   ``There are no words to describe our family's grief,'' the
Buczek family said in a written statement. ``Michael gave up his
life to fight the war on drugs.
   ``All we ask is that our nation's local and federal governments
support the death penalty and provide the funding necessary to win
the drug war.''

<TEXT>
   Rabbi David Aronson, former president of the
Rabbinical Assembly of America, has died after a short illness. He
was 96.
   ``He was one of the leading rabbis, nationally, in the last 60
years,'' said Rabbi Kassel Abelson, Aronson's successor at Beth El
Synagogue in the Minneapolis suburb of St. Louis Park.
   ``His work was very important, especially where it concerned
Jewish annulments and divorces,'' Abelson said. ``His book, `The
Jewish Way of Life,' published in 1945, has become a classic and
has been reprinted many times.''
   Aronson was born in Russia in 1892 and grew up in New York. He
attended New York University, Columbia University and the Jewish
Theological Seminary in New York.
   After ordination in 1919, Aronson served congregations in Salt
Lake City and Duluth, Minn., before joining Beth El in 1924. From
1948 to 1950, he was president of the Rabbinical Assembly of
America, an assembly of 1,200 Conservative rabbis.
   Aronson, who died Thursday, is survived by his wife, Bertha, of
Los Angeles, and two sons.
   A funeral service was scheduled for Sunday.

<HEAD>Million-Dollar Reward Offered For Identity Of Secret Client _ If</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Relatives of a man who was killed
in an unsolved hit-and-run are offering as much as $1 million to
anyone with information leading to the driver's identity.
   But the family says that before it can pay off, it first must
win a $6 million lawsuit against the driver, and his identity
apparently is known only to one person, an attorney who has won
court permission to keep it secret because of lawyer-client
privilege.
   That lawsuit is pending in Palm Beach County Circuit Court,
while state and private investigators continue trying to track down
the driver of the car.
   The suit was filed in February over the March 9, 1986, crash
that killed Mark Baltes in Palm Beach.
   Attorney Barry Krischer says the driver approached him for
counsel the day after the accident and he has steadfastly refused
to publicly identify him.
   On Oct. 12, Circuit Judge Timothy Poulton said Krischer did not
have to reveal that information because it is protected by
attorney-client confidentiality.
   ``This criminal is out there laughing at the system, hiding
behind the attorney-client privilege,'' says Joseph Farish,
attorney for Baltes' family. He devised the reward plan, announced
Friday, ``in order to make incentive for someone to come forward
and expedite this mystery.''
   Farish conceded that if someone comes forward with information
leading to the driver's identity, the tipster would have to wait
for a favorable jury verdict in the lawsuit.
   Richard Lubin, who represents Krischer, said he is indifferent
to Farish's tactics, as long as Farish does not trample on the
judge's ruling.
   ``It's really not my concern as long as he and everyone else
respects the attorney-client privilege,'' Lubin said.
   ``Anything that Mr. Farish or the Baltes family will do to help
us is welcome,'' said Chief Assistant State Attorney Ken Selvig.
``If this helps, we welcome it.''

   The USS Wisconsin, which received a
nearly $449 million overhaul, was recommissioned Saturday as
officials lauded the World War II warship as a mighty defender.
   ``When the Wisconsin was originally commissioned, it was the
most powerful warship on the seas,'' said Rep. Les Aspin, D-Wis.,
chairman of the House Armed Services Committee. ``With the new
modern weapons systems that were ably installed at Ingalls
Shipbuilding, it is once again the standard for blue water military
strength around the world.''
   The USS Wisconsin will join three other World War II battleships
that were modernized and returned to service _ the Iowa, New Jersey
and Missouri.
   The Navy said the $448.8 million refitting was a fraction of the
cost of building such a ship from scratch today.
   But Milwaukee Mayor John O. Norquist, who refused to attend the
ceremony, disagreed.
   ``The Navy calls this ship a bargain, but a half-billion-dollar
battleship is no bargain for Milwaukee and Wisconsin taxpayers,''
Norquist said.
   He said he it was ``incredible that taxpayers have been saddled
so much to bring back a ship that's mostly of nostalgic value.''
   The Wisconsin is 887 feet long, 108 feet wide and displaces
58,000 tons.
   It will be based in Norfolk, Va., until construction is
completed on a new naval base in Texas. It will have a crew of
1,600.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A rare, public rift in the Jewish community,
controversy over a political memo and harsh words from Defense
Secretary Frank Carlucci have focused attention on AIPAC, one of
the most powerful lobbying groups on Capitol Hill.
   The American Israel Public Affairs Committee, referred to as
AIPAC, is well-known in the corridors of power even though its
staff generally stays out of the limelight and prefers to work
behind the scenes.
   Thomas A. Dine, AIPAC's executive director, rarely gives
interviews, and AIPAC officials are not regulars on the television
and radio talk show circuit.
   Yet AIPAC has compiled a stunningly successful record since 1951
in promoting the relationship between the United States and Israel.
Jerusalem is the largest recipient of U.S. economic and military
aid, amounting to $3 billion this year.
   ``It's the strongest lobby in Washington, the strongest lobby in
the country,'' said former Rep. Paul Findley, an Illinois
Republican who wrote a book attacking AIPAC after his defeat in
1982.
   ``It remains a powerhouse on Capitol Hill because they have an
excellent, highly professional, highly trained staff,'' he said.
AIPAC staff members track legislation and have broad contacts at
the State Department and in the White House.
   AIPAC and its allies in Congress have played a large role in
opposing the sale of weapons to Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Bahrain and
Kuwait.
   Carlucci, in a speech to an Arab-American group Friday, said
congressional opposition to the sale of weapons to moderate Arab
countries was costing the United States ``tens of billions of
dollars worth of jobs.''
   Saudi Arabia, upset that its attempts to buy weapons such as new
fighter jets and Maverick antitank missiles from Washington often
have been stymied by Congress, recently signed a deal with Britain
to buy more than $30 billion worth of weapons.
   Carlucci did not mention AIPAC by name, but he criticized
``various interest groups and many in Congress'' for trying to
block sales to Arab countries.
   ``The notion that U.S. defense cooperation with moderate Arab
states poses a danger to Israel is ill-founded and untrue,'' he
said.
   But Rep. Mel Levine, D-Calif., a strong backer of Israel, said,
``Such sales are not in the American interest of peace in the
Middle East.''
   Findley, in a telephone interview from Jacksonville, Ill., said
he thinks AIPAC's real power stems from an indirect linkage between
the lobby and pro-Israel political action committees controlled by
Jewish groups.
   AIPAC strenuously denies the allegation and says it does not
make political contributions or endorse candidates.
   Spokeswoman Toby Dershowitz reiterated this position in a letter
to Washington Jewish Week, which had published a story saying the
CBS-TV show ``60 Minutes'' was looking into the relationship
between AIPAC and pro-Israel political action committees.
   ```60 Minutes' has no new `evidence' that AIPAC coordinates or
directs PACs,'' she said, adding that earlier allegations fall
``far short of `proving' any such direction or coordination.''
   Dershowitz also disavowed a 1987 memo written by a former junior
staffer at the lobbying group to another ex-staffer, Barbara
Amouyal.
   The memo discussed the Senate race in Rhode Island, describing
Republican incumbent John Chafee as a ``poor supporter of our
issue.'' It called for encouragement of the candidacy of Richard
Licht, the state's lieutenant governor who is Jewish.
   ``No such negative campaign exists'' against Chafee, Dershowitz
said.
   While AIPAC always has been a magnet for criticism from some
members of Congress, the airing of a disagreement in the Jewish
community over the lobby's activities was unusual.
   Six officials of the American Jewish Committee, the American
Jewish Congress and the Anti-Defamation League of the B'nai B'rith
complained in a letter that AIPAC had taken positions that were not
in accord with ``the consensus of the organized Jewish community.''
   The complaint was in the form of a letter that appeared first in
The New York Times.
   The letter said AIPAC erred in trying to close the Palestine
Liberation Organization's U.N. office in New York, and some Jewish
leaders disagreed with AIPAC's opposition to a big Kuwaiti arms
deal.
   Last week, the groups tried to paper over any differences with
AIPAC.
   They issued a statement in which they pledged to be ``fully
supportive'' of AIPAC's work. The three groups were among the
founding members of AIPAC in 1951.
   Some of Israel's supporters on Capitol Hill also played down the
significance of any rift.
   ``Do all Jews have the same opinion on Israel? No,'' said Rep.
Barney Frank, D-Mass. But that doesn't translate into an overall
lessening of support for Israel, he said.
   Although AIPAC officials ``generally do a good job,'' Frank
said, ``I think they sometimes tend to overkill.''
   ``The Jewish community is not homogeneous,'' said Rep. Larry
Smith, D-Fla., who said, ``I don't think it is anything but healthy
to have different points of view'' on issues.
   But Rep. Mervyn Dymally, D-Calif., chairman of the Congressional
Black Caucus and an AIPAC critic, said the open disagreement could
weaken the lobby because when ``leaders begin to speak out ... then
AIPAC will moderate their views.''
   AIPAC's money comes from its 50,000 members who sent
contributions. The group, which has a staff of about 70, will
operate with a budget of $6.6 million this year, Dershowitz said.
   Six people registered as lobbyists for AIPAC between April and
July this year. Lobbying reports filed with the Senate show that
Dine and AIPAC's chief lobbyist, Douglas Bloomfield, each earned
about $21,000 in the second quarter of 1988.
   Meantime, former CIA agent Victor Marchetti and author Mark Lane
said they have asked the Justice Department to investigate whether
AIPAC should be registered as a lobby for a foreign government
under the 1938 Foreign Agents Registration Act.
   Department spokesman John Russell said the agency determined in
the 1970s that AIPAC was not required to register because none of
its money came from Israel.

   Iraq said Saturday it will release 25
Iranian prisoners of war, but the two countries traded accusations
over the POW issue.
   The official Iraqi News Agency quoted a Foreign Ministry
spokesman as saying the new release will raise to 645 the number of
sick and aging Iranian prisoners who have been freed.
   According to the International Red Cross, Iran holds 50,182
Iraqi POWs and Iraq holds 19,284 Iranians. But U.N. officials and
diplomats place the figures much higher, saying Iran holds
60,000-70,000 and Iraq 30,000-50,000.
   The Iraqi spokesman said the International Committee of the Red
Cross was asked to send a delegation to organize the new
repatriation, according to the news agency report monitored in
Nicosia.
   It said he called on Iran to reciprocate and claimed that Iran
``had all along dealt with the POW issue as a political one in
order to exploit it for the purposes of Iran's expansionist
policies.''
   A Tehran Radio commentary on Saturday welcomed Iraq's planned
release of prisoners but said real progress on the issue would only
come through quicker peace negotiations.
   It also accused Iraq of waffling on the issue, claiming Irdaq
first said it would not exchange prisoners within the framework of
U.N. Resolution 598 but later supported elements of that plan.
   The resolution is the basis for the Aug. 20 cease-fire in the
8-year-long war.
   The commentary, monitored by the British Broadcasting Corp. in
London, said Iran was ready to exchange prisoners of war.

   More than 100 anti-abortion protesters were arrested in
Bridgeport, Conn., on Saturday, while a noisy, rain-soaked protest
in Boston drew as many counterdemonstrators as demonstrators.
   The crowd of protesters in front of the Summit Women's Center in
Bridgeport delayed the opening of the clinic for more than an hour,
witnesses said.
   ``The goal was to save babies' lives,'' said Bob Chuvala of
Danbury, who helped organize the protest for the Connecticut
Pro-Life Action Network. ``If some mother decided not to have an
abortion because of our presence there, then yes, we've
accomplished our goal.''
   Police originally said 131 people were arrested by midday, but
later revised that total to 103 adults and four juveniles. Officer
Sheila Peeler said the adults were released on written promises to
appear in Superior Court later, and the juveniles were released
into the custody of their parents, she said.
   Chuvala said there were about 50 people taking part in the
protest who were not arrested, bringing the total number of
participants to about 160.
   There were far fewer arrests in Boston, where about 300 people
turned out. Activists on both sides of the issue each claimed they
had more supporters in the crowd.
   ``They may be able to get away with this in Atlanta, but they
are not going to do this in Boston,'' said Louise Rice, an
organizer of the pro-choice counter-protest. Since July, large
anti-abortion protests in Atlanta have resulted in hundreds of
arrests.
   Deputy Boston police superintendent Ronald Conway said three
abortion opponents were arrested on disorderly conduct charges as
they sat on the sidewalk in front of the downtown Gynacare clinic.
   About 30 helmeted officers stood shoulder to shoulder in front
of the clinic to clear a path for arriving patients.
   No staff members or patients with appointments for abortions
were denied entry, said a clinic spokeswoman who would identify
herself only as Karla. But she added that there was no way of
knowing if any women were discouraged from coming in for
unscheduled pregnancy tests.
   ``We are not here to get arrested, to close buildings, to make
an issue,'' said Joseph Foreman, a Presbyterian minister from
Atlanta who helped organize the recent demonstrations there and was
advising the Boston protest.
   ``We are here to save children who are going to be killed,''
Foreman said.
   But Tess Ewing, another organizer of the pro-choice
counter-protest, said, ``It's not so much that they are pro-fetus,
they are anti-women. These people are trying to win back by
disruptive tactics the moral rights that they couldn't win by
legitimate means.''
   In Connecticut, Chuvala had declined to identify in advance
which of about a dozen clinics in the state would be the target of
Saturday's action because ``we need an element of surprise.''
   After the protest began at the clinic in Bridgeport, a woman who
answered the telephone at the center said, ``I'm sorry, we don't
have anything to say.'' Earlier, a coalition of abortion providers
in the state had vowed to do everything possible to keep open
whatever clinic was hit by the protest.

   A Shiite Moslem leader said Saturday that
kidnappers holding foreign hostages and threatening to hurt the
American ones were committing an ``unforgivable crime.''
   Nabih Berri, who heads the mainstream Shiite Amal militia, spoke
in an interview with The Associated Press after the Islamic Jihad,
a pro-Iranian fundamentalist faction, warned it would punish
American hostages it is holding.
   The Islamic Jihad threat was in retaliation for Friday's Israeli
air raids on Lebanon that killed 21 people and injured 34.
Officials had said 16 people were killed in the attacks but police
reported five more bodies were found in the rubble Saturday in the
southeastern town of Mashgara, one of the main targets of the
Israeli raids.
   Israeli warplanes flew over the pro-Iranian stronghold of
Baalbek in eastern Lebanon Saturday but no attacks were reported.
   Berri's Syrian-backed militia has been locked in a fierce
struggle with pro-Iranian fundamentalists for mastery of the Shiite
community. It has no influence on the kidnappers.
   In Milan, Italy, police said Saturday they arrested a Lebanese
woman at the airport who was carrying pictures of three American
hostages in Lebanon in a false bottom in her suitcase.
   The woman stopped Thursday was carrying photos of Terry
Anderson, Thomas Sutherland and Alann Steen to be given to an
Italian businessman, said Fortunato Finoli, deputy director of the
Milan police anti-terrorist unit.
   She also carried a handwritten letter signed by Steen, he said.
She was arrested and charged with carrying $1,000 in counterfeit
U.S. bills and 50 grams of heroin, Finoli said.
   Police refused to say who was to ultimately receive the pictures
and documents, or why they were being sent.
   They said the U.S. Embassy was notified.
   Finoli said the woman, a Maronite Catholic identified as Aline
Ibrahim Rizkalah, 36, was arrested before Islamic Jihad, or Islamic
holy war, threatened the U.S. hostages Friday and accused the
United States of giving Israel advance approval of the air attack.
   In Lebanon, Berri said Lebanese ``are against America's policy,
against America's support of Israel and against the American
administration. But we are not at all against the American
citizens.''
   He called the kidnapping ``an unjustified, unforgivable crime.''
   In its statement, the Islamic Jihad said: ``The criminal America
must realize it will not get away with what it has done, especially
in connection with the hostages we hold.''
   The group holds Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent for
The Associated Press, and Sutherland, acting dean of agriculture at
the American University of Beirut.
   Anderson is the longest-held foreign hostage in Lebanon. He was
kidnapped March 16, 1985. Sutherland, of Fort Collins, Colo., was
seized three months later. The Jan. 24, 1987 abduction of Steen, a
teacher at Beirut University College, has been claimed by the
pro-Iranian Islamic Jihad for the Liberation of Palestine.
   They are among nine Americans believed held by pro-Iranian
extremist factions linked to Hezbollah, or Party of God, the main
militia challenging Berri's Amal among Lebanon's Shiites. Others
believed held are three Britons, an Irishman and an Italian.
   Asked if he believed the foreign hostages would be released
soon, Berri said that would happen ``only if deals were struck
between the kidnappers and the hostages' governments.''
   In Mashgara, Hezbollah on Saturday buried eight air raid victims.
   About 1,500 mourners shouted ``Death to America, the great
Satan!'' and ``Death to Israel!'' as they paraded flag-draped
coffins through the streets. ``The more you kill us the more we
will fight!''

   The racketeering indictment of former
Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos signals the start of a
lengthy legal process that is likely to include several rounds of
plea bargaining with the Justice Department.
   Even if Marcos and the government don't work out a deal that
would spare both sides the expense of a trial, it could easily be a
year or more before Marcos would face a jury.
   Federal prosecutors allege Marcos embezzled more than $100
million from the Philippine government and used the money to buy
three buildings in New York City. The main charge carries a maximum
prison sentence of 20 years.
   ``Paradoxical as it may seem, Imelda and I welcome the
opportunity to show the whole world that these allegations of
dishonesty and criminal activity cannot be proven by our accusers.
We are confident that we will be vindicated,'' Marcos said in a
statement released Saturday by his spokesman, Gemmo Trinidad.
   As part of what they promise will be a vigorous defense, Marcos'
lawyers will embark on an extensive legal process of pre-trial
discovery that is likely to involve a demand for a massive review
of administration records for any documents suggesting Marcos was
offered assurances he wouldn't be prosecuted if he came to this
country.
   Whether any such records exist, the check for them and the
discovery process in general will take a long time.
   In Honolulu on Friday, Marcos attorney Richard Hibey referred to
the matter indirectly, saying President Reagan was responsible for
Marcos being brought to the United States, that Marcos considered
himself loyal to Reagan and expected some loyalty in return,
including safe haven in this country.
   Marcos was president of the Philippines for 20 years and a close
ally of a succession of U.S. administrations until he fled into
exile in February 1986.
   Hibey also said his client's health will be a major factor in
the case.
   Although he said Marcos, 71, is willing to attend his
arraignment either in Honolulu or New York by Oct. 31, where Marcos
and his wife would plead innocent, Hibey described Marcos' state as
``frail.''
   ``I am personally concerned ... that he may not be physically
able to withstand the rigors of a criminal trial of this scope and
magnitude,'' said Hibey.
   Trinidad, the Marcos spokesman, said Saturday that ``even at the
expense of his life, if he has to go to New York, he'll go. The
most important thing is not life, but honor and he will defend his
honor any place.''
   In the 2{ years Marcos has lived in Hawaii, he has been treated
for a variety of illnesses, including chest pains and an eye
ailment.
   Marcos' lawyers showed no enthusiasm with the deal the Justice
Department offered prior to his indictment, possibly pointing to a
drawn-out process of negotiation in the future.
   Calling the pre-indictment offer ``a set of non-negotiable''
demands, Hibey said Marcos had been instructed to accept or reject
a deal that would have required him and his wife to plead guilty to
felony racketeering charges and testify against others with no
assurances Marcos would not be jailed.
   And Marcos' lawyers are showing no reluctance to publicly
dispute information being put out by the government about the case.
   One Marcos attorney, John J. Tigue, flatly rejected the notion
that Marcos' lawyers hadn't responded to the Justice Department's
demands that he enter a guilty plea. Federal sources said Thursday
that the lawyers hadn't responded by a 5 p.m. EDT deadline. Tigue
said there had been miscommunication, that the deadline had been
5:30 p.m. and that the Marcos' lawyers had responded in time,
rejecting the offer. ``Of course we wouldn't let the deadline go
by'' without responding, said Tigue.
   Marcos decision to face indictment rather than plead guilty to a
crime also raises another intriguing question: How much political
damage might he inflict?
   A State Department cable that leaked out earlier this month
touches on the potential problem.
   It says, in part, that an indictment may prompt a vindictive
Marcos to ``seek to involve and embarrass'' U.S. and Philippine
officials by making allegations of improper or illegal conduct,
``however unfounded'' in an attempt to adversely affect relations
with the current Philippine government. The cable doesn't elaborate.
   In another development, a congressman confirmed early Saturday
that Marcos recently was subpoenaed to testify before a House
subcommittee.
   Rep. Dante B. Fascell, D-Fla., chairman of the House Foreign
Affairs Committee, said he signed the subpoena after it was
requested by the Asian and Pacific affairs subcommittee.
   Fascell declined to discuss what the panel wants to question
Marcos about, but The Virgininian-Pilot and the Ledger-Star,
newspapers in Norfolk, Va., reported from their Washington bureaus
that it involves long-standing allegations that Marcos funneled
millions of dollars into the 1980 and 1984 presidential campaigns
of Reagan.
   In Honolulu, television station KHON quoted Hibey as confirming
that the subpoena had been served. ``I understand it's for his
appearance today (Oct. 21) in Washington,'' Hibey told the station.
``That's not going to happen.''

   Troops shot and wounded 12 Palestinians on
Saturday in scattered clashes in the occupied territories, hospital
officials said. The army said a soldier was injured when he was
struck in the head by a rock.
   Also Saturday, 21-year-old Lt. Moti Shtaier died of wounds
suffered Wednesday when a suicide car bomb exploded in southern
Lebanon, the army said. His death raised the number of Israeli
troops killed in the explosion to eight. Two other soldiers were
hospitalized in critical condition.
   The bombing prompted Israeli air raids over southern Lebanon
Friday that killed 21 people and injured 34. Police initially said
16 people were killed but reported five more bodies were found in
rubble in the southeastern Lebanese town of Mashgara, one of the
main targets of the raids.
   Most of Saturday's rioting in the occupied territories was
confined to the Gaza Strip, where 650,000 Palestinians live, many
in refugee camps.
   The army placed curfews on Gaza's Nusseirat refugee camp and a
Gaza City neighborhood after violent protests, a military spokesman
said. Hospital officials said troops shot a 23-year-old resident in
the leg with a plastic bullet.
   The spokesman confirmed only one of the 12 wounded, identifying
him as a 16-year-old Gaza City boy shot and wounded by a plastic
bullet.
   Demonstrators stoned the army headquarters in Gaza's Jabaliya
refugee camp, an Arab reporter said. Soldiers responded with
plastic bullets, shooting and wounding a 20-year-old man in the
leg, the reporter and hospital officials said.
   The hospital officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity,
said another Jabaliya man in his 20s was severely beaten by
club-wielding soldiers.
   In Gaza's town of Rafah, protesters burned tires at the open-air
market and hurled stones, slightly injuring a soldier, the reporter
said. Troops fired tear gas and plastic bullets to disperse the
crowd, shooting and wounding a 13-year-old boy in the leg and a
46-year-old man in the hand, the reporter said.
   Five others were shot and wounded by plastic bullets in other
protests, the reporter said.
   In the West Bank city of Nablus, troops fired live ammunition to
disperse a crowd, wounding a 15-year-old Palestinian in the leg and
a 16-year-old in the stomach, hospital officials said. The
officials said an 18-year-old Palestinian from Salfit village was
brought to the hospital with a bullet wound to the stomach.
   The 10-month Palestinian revolt against Israeli rule of the
territories, captured from Jordan and Egypt in 1967 Middle East
War, has claimed the lives of 301 Palestinians and six Israelis.
   In Jerusalem, some 500 supporters of U.S.-born Rabbi Meir Kahane
held a rally Saturday night to protest the exclusion of the
ultra-right-wing parliament member from the upcoming elections Nov.
1. The parliament's Central Elections Committee barred Kahane from
running for office because of his racist views.
   ``Arabs are a cancer in our midst,'' Kahane told the crowd, who
chanted, ``Death to the Arabs'' and waved yellow flags with the
Kahane emblem, a fist inside a black Star of David. Kahane
advocates expelling all Arabs from Israel.

   The government said Saturday that it wants
Solidarity leader Lech Walesa to meet with the interior minister to
remove obstacles to upcoming top-level talks with the opposition.
   Walesa last week refused a request for such a meeting, but the
government continues to hope he will meet with Interior Minister
Czeslaw Kiszczak, spokesman Jerzy Urban said.
   At an unusual meeting with reporters, Urban said problems remain
over the participants, date and site of the talks. But he strongly
denied that the government was backing out of its promise to
discuss Poland's future with the opposition.
   ``I state tat we have wanted from the beginning and still want
the round-table to begin as quickly as possible,'' he said. ``The
round-table is our initiative, not anyone else's.''
   Solidarity, the first independent trade union movement in the
Soviet bloc, responded with a communique saying the insistence on
another Walesa-Kiszczak meeting was a discouraging development.
   ``This mounting of difficulties and the fact that nothing can as
of today be recognized as settled gives a very pessimistic
prognosis,'' said the statement.
   Walesa confirmed he turned down a proposed meeting with
Kiszczak, an army general who agreed with Walesa to hold the talks
in a meeting Aug. 31 during a wave of strikes in Poland.
   After getting the promise for the talks on the possible
legalization of Solidarity and union pluralism, Walesa quickly
halted Poland's worst strike wave since Solidarity was crushed in
the 1981 martial law crackdown.
   Walesa, speaking from his home in Gdansk, said he refused
another meeting with Kiszczak ``because a meeting on personnel
problems makes no sense. I won't permit any personnel changes'' in
Solidarity's proposed delegation.
   ``I like the general very much, and I am ready (to talk), but
the talk cannot concern personnel problems or problems of
Solidarity and pluralism,'' he said. ``This is all for the
round-table.''
   Walesa said the opposition could start the talks immediately if
the government agreed.
   ``I'm not going to travel and talk without a purpose, but I'm
ready to talk about the important things,'' he said.
   Urban said: ``There are various problems: who should issue
invitations, where it takes place, how many working groups there
will be. ... We also need to discuss and remove controversies
concerning the personnel composition.
   ``We strongly appeal (to the opposition) not to avoid the
necessary preparatory work so that the round-table can finally
meet,'' Urban said.
   Catholic mediator Andrzej Stelmachowski, who met with Politiburo
member Jozef Czyrek on Saturday, said only one major obstacle
remained. He said the government seeks to remove two people from
Solidarity's proposed delegation to the talks.
   Urban previously said there were problems with the proposed
participation of longtime Solidarity advisers Adam Michnik and
Jacek Kuron, who in the government's view advocate the overthrow of
communism.

   Stormy weather spread heavy rain, wind and cold air across parts
of New England on Saturday, with snow at some higher elevations,
while high wind whistled across parts of the northern Plains.
   A strong low pressure system over the southern New England coast
spread rain over much of the region during the night and into
Saturday morning.
   During the six hours up to 2 p.m. EDT, 1.70 inches of rain fell
at Brunswick, Maine; with 1.50 at Portland, Maine; and 1.05 inches
at Portsmouth, N.H.
   Colder air poured in behind the low and changed the rain to wet
snow over parts of south-central and northeastern New York state
and over most of Vermont.
   Up to 10 inches of snow accumulated at higher elevations of
Tompkins County in New York's southern tier. Six to 8 inches of
snow was measured across Schuyler County, and Ithaca got 5 inches.
   The heavy, wet snow in Tompkins County downed several trees and
power lines, and at 3 p.m. about half the county was without
electricity, said Julie Morehouse, a spokeswoman for the county
sheriff's department.
   In Cortland, N.Y., deputies said downed poles and power lines
caused widespread blackouts and roads were slippery and thick with
slush. Auburn, N.Y., asked Rochester for emergency generators to
provide temporary electricity while utility crews worked to restore
service.
   The New England coast was battered by strong wind, with gusts to
near 60 mph at Bar Harbor, Maine, during the afternoon.
   Strong wind and heavy rain knocked down power lines in parts of
Maine, and Central Maine Power Co. spokesman Clark Irwin said an
estimated 3,000 to 5,000 customers were blacked out in the Portland
area alone.
   At Bath, Maine, the scheduled launching of a new Aegis cruiser
was postponed at Bath Iron Works, the first launching to be put off
since 1967.
   Snow was also reported over the higher elevations of southern
West Virginia.
   Showers were widely scattered from the lower Great Lakes into
the mid Atlantic Coast.
   Strong, gusty wind blew over the northern Rockies and northern
high Plains behind a cold front moving across the northern Plains,
and a few showers developed over central Montana. Gusts to near 60
mph were recorded at Rapid City, S.D., and to 52 mph at Wheatridge,
Colo.
   While the Northeast had snow and cold, the central high Plains
had temperatures in the 80s over northwestern Kansas and eastern
Colorado. Readings also hit the 80s over much of southern and
central Texas, extreme southern Florida and the desert Southwest.
   In Central America, Hurricane Joan was downgraded to a tropical
storm after moving across Nicaragua, causing several deaths and
considerable damage.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 32
degrees at Binghamton and Saranac Lake, N.Y., to 98 at Palm
Springs, Calif. Saturday morning's low for the 48 states was 11
degrees at Gunnison, Colo.
   For Sunday, widespread rain was forecast from the Great Lakes
through the middle Mississippi valley and the lower Ohio and
Tennessee valleys into eastern Texas and the lower Mississippi
Valley. Rain changing to snow was forecast over northern Minnesota
and northwestern Wisconsin. Scattered rain was forecast over the
eastern Great Lakes and northern Maine.
   Highs only in the 30s were predicted over northern Minnesota; in
the 40s from the northern Plains through the upper Mississippi
Valley into northern New England; in the 70s and 80s from the
Pacific Coast through the Great Basin of Nevada and western Utah,
the southern Rockies, much of Texas and the Gulf Coast states into
the southern Atlantic Coast and Florida; in the low to mid 90s over
north-central California and the desert Southwest; and in the 50s
or 60s across much of the rest of the nation.

   Authorities detained the captain of an
Italian freighter and accused him of ramming a Greek cruise ship in
an accident that killed two Greek seamen, injured 54 passengers and
left two people missing.
   Italian officials on Saturday denied the Greek allegation and
said the freighter was at a standstill before the crash.
   Officials had reported a British teen-ager was missing and
feared dead after Friday's accident and on Saturday sponsors of the
tour of British students said a teacher also could not be accounted
for.
   Schools Abroad, the London-based organizer of the trip,
identified the missing student as Vivien Barley, 14, of Sutton
Confield, England, and the teacher as Bernard Butt from the T.P.
Riley Community in Walsall, England.
   The collision involved the freighter Adige and the 6,300-ton
Jupiter, which was carrying 486 British students and teachers. Most
of the schoolchildren arrived in London Saturday for tearful
reunions with their families.
   The crash tore a gaping hole in the port side of the Jupiter,
which sank less than a mile from shore. All others aboard the
Jupiter were rescued, and no injuries were reported from the Adige.
   Italian officials denied Greek claims that the Adige was at
fault.
   ``The responsibility for the collision is that of the captain of
the Adige, who, through criminal negligence, threw his ship into
the left side of the Jupiter,'' said Greece's merchant marine
minister, Evangelos Yannopoulos.
   The Adige, a container ship owned by Sicula Oceanica SPA, Siosa
Line, of Palermo, Sicily, ignored warnings from the Jupiter's
skipper as it was manuevering to dock, said Spyros Mavrikis, a
spokesman for Epirotiki Lines, the Jupiter's owner.
   Premier Andreas Papandreou, returning to Athens Saturday after
undergoing heart surgery in London, told reporters before his
departure that ``it was a question of the captain not knowing what
he was doing.''
   But Adige Capt. Flavio Caminale, being being held in the port
city of Piraeus on manslaughter charges, said the Greek ship was to
blame.
   ``We were stopped outside the Piraeus port, waiting for the
pilot so we could go in,'' Caminale said in a telephone interview
with Italy's RAI television network. ``The pilot was coming towards
me. At a certain point, I saw the cruise ship leaving port....
   ``Probably the wind pushed it, and I found it coming upon me. So
when I realized after a few seconds that this ship was coming at
me, I ordered the engines in reverse ... and, at the last moment,
when he (the cruise ship) saw that he couldn't pass, he violently
tacked to starboard. And in so turning himself, he struck my prow.''
   In Rome, Italy's Merchant Marine Ministry said the Adige ``had
been at a standstill for 10 minutes when Capt. Caminale spotted the
Jupiter leaving port, and realized promptly that it was on a
collision course.''
   ``The captain of the Italian ship immediately ordered its
engines to reverse direction,'' the communique said.
   There was not enough time for the order to be carried out, said
2nd Lt. Enrico Costantini at the ministry's operations center.
   Asked if the Greek ship had struck the Italian vessel, he said,
``I think so. That is what it appears at this moment.''
   Students and teachers were flown back to Britain Saturday aboard
four chartered jets. Some were still wrapped in blankets and many
wept as they boarded the jets.
   A government spokesman said three people remained hospitalized
in stable condition.
   The 471 teen-agers and their 15 teachers and chaperones were
starting an 8-day educational cruise when the collision occurred 20
minutes after the Jupiter left port.
   According to Mavrikis and port officials, the Adige's bulbous
nose rammed the cruise ship amidships below the waterline.
   ``Its prow tore a gash all the way up to the boat deck and the
engine room flooded. The tug boats managed to keep the ship afloat
while it was evacuated,'' Mavrikis said.
   Thirty-two vessels took part in a 25-minute rescue operation.
The Jupiter slid underwater 40 minutes after the crash.

<TEXT>
   Tens of thousands of Lithuanians
carrying torches and their national flag marched Saturday to a
cathedral the Soviet government said it will return to the Roman
Catholic Church.
   The procession began immediately after a Lithuanian nationalist
group was told the government had acceded to demands to return the
14th Century Vilnius Cathedral to its original use.
   The Vilnius Cathedral was a center of Christianity in the Middle
Ages and its confiscation by the officially atheist Soviet
government had angered many Lithuanians.
   ``It's been so many years, I just can't believe it,'' a
67-year-old Catholic woman said. The woman, who marched as the
scent of burning candles and torches filled the air, said she had
prayed at the cathedral as a girl before it was converted into an
art museum in 1950.
   The announcement came at the end of the first day of a two-day
conference of the Lithuanian Restructuring Movement, a broadly
backed group that is considering the most militant nationalist
demands yet from the three Soviet Baltic republics.
   ``The Lithuanian government has decided to return the Vilnius
Cathedral to believers as of Oct. 22,'' an official of the movement
told more than 1,000 delegates and hundreds of guests assembled in
the Vilnius Sports Palace.
   Members of the audience took to their feet, clapping and
cheering in the direction of the republic's new reform-minded
Communist Party chief, Algirdas Brazauskas.
   On Friday, Brazauskas told a news conference that services would
be allowed in the cathedral every Sunday and that another church
converted into a museum would be returned to its original use in
March.
   But Catholic officials were not satisfied and said they would
boycott the Vilnius Cathedral until it was completely turned back
to the church.
   An estimated 4 million Roman Catholics live in the Soviet Union,
about half of them in Lithuania.
   The return of the cathedral was the latest in what many
Lithuanians consider a dizzying period of change in the republic.
Brazauskas is a product of that change. He was named to head the
party just two days ago, replacing Ringaudas Songaila, a
conservative who had expressed only lukewarm support for the
restructuring group.
   Brazauskas had no reservations.
   ``I'm sorry to say that in its evaluation of the movement, there
were mistakes, and some were also made by the (party) Central
Committee,'' Brazauskas told the 1,100 delegates in a speech.
   The 56-year-old official stood on a stage in the Sports Palace
in front of a huge banner bearing the yellow, green and red stripes
of the flag of Lithuania's brief independence between World Wars I
and II. The flag was banned until this month.
   Brazauskas, who was interrupted repeatedly by applause during
his 20-minute address, met with Mikhail S. Gorbachev last week and
said the Soviet president believes the Lithuanian group can help
perestroika, Gorbachev's plan to restructure society.
   In his speech, Brazauskas expanded the list of reforms planned
at the request of nationalist activists. He said a nationalist
monument in Vilnius that was destroyed under Soviet dictator Josef
Stalin will be rebuilt.
   Victims of Stalin's repressions will be rehabilitated and they
or their survivors compensated, he said, and ``all the blank
spots'' in Lithuania's history will be cleared up.
   The Soviet Union took control of the independent Baltic states
in 1940 under a secret pact with Nazi Germany. Activists in all
three republics are demanding that authorities renounce the pact.
   In draft resolutions up for a vote over at the meeting, the
Lithuanian group said the 1940 takeover was an ``unlawful
occupation'' and that the republic ``reserves its right to withdraw
from the Soviet Union.''
   Groups in Estonia and Latvia have adopted similar resolutions.
But in several respects, the Lithuanian measures are more radical.
   In its draft resolutions, the movement says defense and foreign
policy should be handled jointly by the republic and the Kremlin.
It says Lithuanians should have the right to perform compulsory
military service in their republic and to set up their own
diplomatic missions abroad.
   The movement was formed in June and claims 180,000 supporters
among the republic's 3.6 million people.

   President Corazon Aquino praised U.S.
officials Saturday for indicting Ferdinand Marcos on racketeering
charges and said that could deter dictators from robbing the people
and seeking asylum abroad.
   Mrs. Aquino also said that former President Marcos' trial in the
United States would hasten recovery of his `hidden wealth'' _
billions of dollars her administration claims Marcos obtained
during his 20-year rule.
   Marcos and his wife Imelda, who have lived in Hawaii since he
was ousted in February 1986, were indicted in New York Friday on
charges that could send them to jail for 20 years if found guilty.
They were charged along with eight associates.
   The United States alleges that Marcos and his wife embezzled at
least $103 million in government funds including U.S. aid and
funneled the money to secret bank accounts in Switzerland, the
United States and other countries.
   The couple then allegedly used the money to buy valuable New
York properties, the indictment says.
   ``This (indictment) is certainly welcome news in the Philippines
and I commend this evident commitment to the rule of law abroad,''
Mrs. Aquino said in a statement read by her press secretary,
Teodoro Benigno.
   ``I hope that this and other similar efforts undertaken in other
countries to investigate the crimes of the Marcoses will lead to
the early recovery of the stolen assets that rightfully belong to
the Filipino people,'' the statement added.
   ``Significantly, also, the fact that the Marcoses are being
brought to justice will serve as a powerful deterrent to all those
who believe themselves above the law and those who would abuse the
public trust for private gain.''
   Mrs. Aquino's government has accused the Marcoses of stealing up
to $10 billion in public and private assets during his rule and
hiding the wealth in real estate, shares of stock, works of art,
jewelry and bank accounts around the world.
   News reports on the indictment came too late for Manila's
newspapers Saturday but most bannered reports from the previous day
that the Marcoses were about to be criminally charged.
   Political commentator Belinda Aquino _ no relation to the
president _ said in a front-page article in the Philippine Daily
Inquirer it was ironic that Marcos was being prosecuted for
violating U.S. laws and not for crimes committed in the Philippines.
   ``But what does it matter?'' she said. ``The important thing is
that the law has caught up with this rascal at last.''
   Officials said Marcos' trial in the United States would delay
his prosecution here even further, but noted the U.S. trial could
result in the recovery of some of the ``ill-gotten wealth.''
   Although it has repeatedly said it will file criminal charges
against Marcos, the Aquino government has not done so for fear
Marcos would insist on returning to defend himself. The
constitution forbids trial in absentia.

<TEXT>
   The stage has been set for a complex land swap
involving the 111-acre Phoenix Indian School campus and more than
100,000 acres of Florida swampland.
   Congress approved legislation concerning the swap on Thursday.
   The bill authorizes the Interior Department to dispose of the
school, which the Reagan administration wants to close because of
declining enrollments.
   The General Accounting Office, the investigative wing of
Congress, has described the downtown Phoenix land as perhaps the
most valuable undeveloped piece of urban real estate in the West.
Under the plan, the Collier family interests of Florida will get
68.4 acres of the Phoenix property in exchange for the Florida
acreage and a cash payment of at least $34.9 million.
   The transaction also calls for the Veterans Administration to
get 11.5 acres of the school property to expand its Phoenix
hospital; Phoenix to get 20 acres for a park; and Arizona to get
4.5 acres for a veterans home. The rest of the land is tied up in
road rights-of-way.
   The money paid by the Colliers will be placed into a trust fund
for the education of Indians in Arizona.
   The Florida land will be used to provide a buffer around the
Everglades and to provide habitat for endangered species, such as
the Florida panther.
   The House voted 316-32 approval of a package of bills in which
the Phoenix deal was included.
   The measure was approved by the Senate a week ago, but was
approved again by the Senate later Thursday and sent to President
Reagan for his signature. The new Senate vote was necessitated by a
minor change made by the House.

   Hundreds of British children rescued after a ship
collision off Greece returned home Saturday for tearful reunions
with their families but the trip organizer said one child and a
teacher were missing.
   The missing child, 14-year-old Vivien Barley of Sutton Confield,
England, was presumed dead, according to Greece's Marine Ministry.
It had been reported she was the only one of the 486 students and
teachers in the group not found.
   However, the organizer of the trip, Schools Abroad, announced
Saturday evening that teacher Bernard Butt from T.P. Riley
Community College in Walsall, central England, was also missing.
   ``All we know is several (pupils) say he helped them out of the
boat following the accident and was last seen by them helping
children out of the boat, as is typical,'' said school headmaster
Martin Taylor. ``Since then, there is simply no information, and
obviously we are very, very concerned,'' he said in an interview on
Independent Television News.
   However, a spokeswoman for Epirotiki Lines, owners of the Greek
cruise ship Jupiter that carried the British travelers, said later,
on condition of anonymity: ``I know this man is alive and well. I
have spoken to him myself.''
   ``He was accounted for earlier today; now he is not,'' a British
Foreign Office spokesman said, also on condition of anonymity. ``He
certainly did not board any of the planes to Britain.''
   An Italian freighter collided Friday with the Greek cruise ship
carrying the British children and teachers off the Greek port city
of Piraeus. Two Greek seamen aboard the Jupiter were killed, and 54
passengers were injured. The cruise ship sank.
   Greek authorities detained the captain of the Italian freighter
Adige and accused him of being responsible for the accident.
   The rescued children flew home aboard four chartered Boeing 737
jets to Stansted, Gatwick and Manchester airports and rushed into
the arms of their parents. Some of the injured passengers remained
behind in Greek hospitals.
   Some youngsters _ rumpled, pale and still wrapped in blankets _
burst into tears at the sight of their families. One father
collapsed at Manchester Airport as he waited for his daughter to
arrive. He was taken to a hospital.
   Some children were unable to speak, but others poured out their
stories.
   Teacher Roy Embrey described the children as ``magnificent,
absolutely fantastic. If it had been adults, I do not think we
would have got as many off the ship as we did.
   ``Some of the children could not swim and others were afraid to
jump .... Once we were in the water, all we could do was to swim
like the devil.''
   Andrew Gillon, 19, said he escaped from the sinking ship as it
tilted almost vertically in the sea.
   ``It went up on one side, stood up, and then I realized we just
had to get off,'' he said. ``But there was one girl, Sara Korb, who
would not come with me. She would not let go so I tried to talk her
down.
   ``She would not let go of the ladder, so in the end I had to
pull her hands off.''
   His tearful mother, Margaret Gillon, clung to her son as he told
his tale. ``Until I heard he was safe, I couldn't cry,'' she said.

   Timothy Puffe Sr., separated from his
wife, wanted to be with his two little boys.
   Now, he sits in an isolated jail cell with a wound healing on
his neck.
   He slashed his throat and lived. Police say he slashed the
throats of Timmy, 3, and Tommy, 2. They were buried Saturday.
   The 29-year-old father was charged last week with two counts of
first-degree murder, but a judge granted him permission Thursday to
see the boys one final time before their funerals.
   Puffe and his 27-year-old wife, Victoria, were getting a divorce
and custody of the boys was going to be a major issue. She and the
children had moved out in August and a temporary court order let
Puffe have the children on Sundays.
   Puffe was being held in lieu of $500,000 cash bail in a cell
equipped with a television monitor where officers ``are watching
him a bit more closely'' than other inmates, said Chief Deputy
Robert Andraschko of the Waupaca County Sheriff's Department.
   ``Timothy and Thomas will not have died in vain if we would see
children as a gift from God and not pawns in the lives and desires
of adults,'' the Rev. Donald Gauerke told about 100 mourners
Saturday at Trinity Lutheran Church.
   The church pastor urged family and friends to reflect on the
``joy and unending enthusiasm and vitality'' of the boys and to
forgive their father.
   The killings Oct. 15 left people stunned in the neighborhood of
neat lawns, no fences and well-kept, ranch-style homes. Basketball
hoops, bicycles and swing sets adorn many yards in this community
of about 6,200 about 40 miles southwest of Green Bay.
   ``Everybody has kids. It's just a neighborhood full of kids,''
said next-door neighbor Ellen Bodah. ``You can tell it kind of
bothers the kids.''
   The boys' mother and police found them in the house after Mrs.
Puffe received a phone call from her estranged husband. Mrs.
Puffe's daughter from a previous marriage, sleeping in another
bedroom, was unharmed.
   In a letter police found addressed to Mrs. Puffe, the father
wondered what his wife would joke about, ``now that I'm gone and I
took my little men with me,'' according to a criminal complaint.
   Neighbors and relatives described Puffe as a devoted father who
often worked 70 hours a week as a farmhand but spent every spare
moment with his sons.
   In a signed statement to police, Puffe said he drank about a
fourth of a quart of rum and wrote a note to his wife after putting
the children to bed.
   He took a knife from a kitchen drawer and lay down on the bed
where the two boys were, according to the statement filed in
circuit court.
   ``I cut Timmy first across the neck, I cut Tommy across the neck
right away, across the neck both the same way,'' the statement said.
   He called his wife and told her, ``I just killed the boys,''
then returned to the bedroom and lay between his sons, according to
the statement.
   ``With my right hand (I) cut my own throat,'' the statement
said. ``I wanted to be with my boys.''
   Police spoke twice with Puffe by telephone and he told them
there was no problem in the house. A third call went unanswered and
an officer looking through windows saw a man's figure lay down on a
bed, sit back up, fall sideways and crawl down a hall. Puffe
crawled out the front door of the home.
   He was hospitalized for a day and then went to jail.

<TEXT>
   The leaders of Jordan, Egypt and the
Palestine Liberation Organization met Saturday in an effort to
forge common proposals for an international peace conference in the
Arab-Israeli conflict.
   Their summit was held with a view toward Israel's parliamentary
elections on Nov. 1 and a session of the Palestine National
Council, which acts as the PLO's parliament, on Nov. 12.
   ``This meeting aims at coordinating Arab positions so we can
move forward quickly to convening an international peace
conference,'' PLO chairman Yasser Arafat told reporters after
meeting with King Hussein of Jordan and Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak.
   ``We want the Israeli voter ... to determine his interests
before the November election,'' said Osama Baz, Mubarak's chief
political adviser, when asked about the summit's significance.
   ``It is important for him (the Israeli voter) to know that there
is an Arab partner who is ready for peace,'' Baz told reporters.
``If he does not want it, we will have something else to say.''
   In Israel, Avi Pazner, a spokesman for Prime Minister Yitzhak
Shamir of the rightist Likud bloc, denounced the Aqaba conference,
calling it an attempt to influence the Israeli election.
   But a spokesman for Foreign Minister Shimon Peres, the head of
Israel's socialist Labor Party, said the summit proved Peres'
proposal for peace talks between Israel and a joint
Jordanian-Palestinian delegation is still viable.
   A senior PLO official in Aqaba, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said the talks focused on the form of a proposed
confederation between Jordan and a Palestinian state and on
improving relations between Jordan and the PLO.
   In July, Hussein renounced Jordan's claims to the
Israeli-occupied West Bank and curtailed his nation's longstanding
administrative ties with the occupied territories. He previously
terminated joint efforts with the PLO to arrange peace talks with
Israel.
   Arafat last visited Jordan for an Arab summit in November 1987.
   He told reporters he still supports the PLO's commitment to a
confederation between Jordan and an independent Palestinian state.
   He said he would give the 450-member Palestine National Council
four options: Declaring a Palestinian state under occupation, a
provisional state and government, a provisional government alone,
or asking temporary international protection for the occupied
territories.
   Aides said Arafat and Mubarak planned to leave Sunday.

<TEXT>
   President Reagan is expected to sign a broad
ranging anti-drug bill that calls for stiff penalties for drug
dealers including the death sentence in some cases involving
drug-related murders.
   The bill, characterized by Sen. Minority Leader Bob Dole,
R-Kan., as ``bad news for drug dealers and their customers,'' was
approved by Congress early Saturday.
   ``This is a very strong bill. The message is simple. Don't do
drugs. The country will not tolerate it,'' declared Senate Majority
Leader Robert Byrd, D-W.Va.
   The bill calls for creation of a Cabinet-level ``drug czar''
that would coordinate all aspects of the federal government's war
against illegal drugs. It also calls for stiffer penalties and a
variety of other sanctions, including loss of some federal benefits
and civil fines, for drug violations.
   White House spokeswoman Liz Murphy said she did not know when
the president will sign the legislation, adding that the bill had
not yet been sent over to the White House.
   Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y., one of the principle
sponsors of the legislation, said Saturday he expects Reagan to
sign the bill swiftly.
   Congress worked late into the night to enact the legislation
that many congressmen and senators wanted in time for the final
days of their re-election campaigns.
   A dispute over proposed anti-obscenity language _ sought by
conservatives, but labeled unconstitutional by many liberals and
moderates _ held up the vote until the early morning hours Saturday.
   The matter was worked out when it was agreed to create a new
obscenity trafficking offense and the House went on to approve the
overall legislation on a 346-11 vote. Two hours later the Senate
passed the measure with a voice vote.
   The bill would allow up to a $10,000 civil fine for possession
of even small quantities of drugs intended for personal use and
could, beginning in September, lead to the loss of student loans
and other federal benefits for anyone convicted of drug possession.
   Drug kingpins and others who kill or order killings while
committing drug-related felonies could be executed under a federal
death penalty provision in the legislation.
   Other provisions of the bill would:
   _Require for the first time health warning labels on alcoholic
beverages.
   _Toughen child pornography laws, including creation of penalties
for anyone who aids in the use of a child for producing sexually
explicit materials.
   _Establishes a one-year pilot program for drug testing of new
drivers' license applicants.
   _Expands the government's role in drug treatment, prevention and
research programs.
   _Allows the president to impose sanctions against countries
involved in laundering drug money.
   Because of continuing disagreements among some legislators,
provisions that would have required random drug testing for
transportation workers and those with safety-related jobs at
nuclear facilities were left out of the legislation.
   In Atlanta, Micky Sadoff, president of Mothers Against Drunk
Driving, called the legislation ``a fantastic success'' because of
its provisions involving alcohol.

   A shootout on the packed midway of the Texas State
Fair sent thousands of fairgoers fleeing in panic and ended with
one dead and three wounded, authorities said Saturday.
   ``I heard two or three shots and people in the center _ in the
middle _ started running in every direction,'' said Juan Salazar,
37, of Dallas, who was high above the midway on a ferris wheel.
``After that, you could see people in different spots just running
like crazy _ just getting away from this area.''
   Many bystanders were knocked down or trampled in Friday night's
panic, and several pregnant women went into labor, officials said.
One police officer was among the wounded and two other police
officers were injured in related scuffles, officials said.
   ``All I know is it got wild out there real fast,'' said police
Cpl. D.H. Boy, who was treated for bruises suffered while arresting
a young man with a gun in his waistband.
   Nancy Wiley, director of communication for the fair, said the
shooting probably would have little effect on the fair, in its last
weekend.
   ``This isn't the first time'' someone has been shot at a Texas
State Fair, she said. ``I've been at the fair more than 15 years.
This is not the first time there's been an incident, and I've never
seen it affect attendance before.''
   She also said the fair's directors would discuss handling of the
shooting and the panic on the midway as part of their general
review of the fair.
   The police presence at the fair was boosted this year and as of
Thursday, crime at the fair was down by 26 percent over last year,
police officials said. During the 1985 fair, 230 offenses were
reported including 57 rapes, murders, assaults and robberies.
   The shooting followed a brawl between black and Hispanic
fair-goers, one corporal said, but investigators were unsure
whether gang fights were involved or if the brawl and shootings
were connected.
   The shots and panic apparently began with a shooting near a
restroom, said police Capt. John Holt.
   Officer J.T. Dailey, who was working off-duty security at the
fair, overheard the shot, chased several people through the midway
crowd and found police Sgt. Manuel Vasquez, a gunman, and another
man struggling on the ground, Holt said.
   He said the gunman pointed a pistol at Dailey. Dailey fired, the
man returned fire, and the officer shot a second time, Holt said.
   Vasquez was shot in the hand and the man who police said shot
Vasquez died of multiple gunshot wounds.
   In addition to the gunman and the police sergeant, two other men
were shot, one near the restroom and one on the midway, Holt said.
   A witness to the shooting said Vasquez saved his life.
   ``If it hadn't been for that cop, I would have got shot. He got
ahold of his (the gunman's) hand,'' Lee Rodriguez said. He and his
family were leaving the fair when the shooting broke out and the
combatants fell on top of Rodriguez's pregnant daughter.
   She was one of eight pregnant women treated at Parkland and
Baylor hospitals for injuries or premature labor caused by the
fair-goers' stampede. Six were released and none gave birth,
hospital officials said. Information after the remaining two was
unavailable. Baylor officials said they treated five other people
trampled or bruised in the crush after the shooting.
   When Boy, the officer who had made an arrest, and other officers
realized an officer had been shot, they began moving through the
panicked crowd to help him.
   ``It was pretty scary. They were all coming at us and you didn't
know who had a gun,'' said Boy, 42, who has been a police officer
for 10 years.
   The wounded sergeant was in stable condition Saturday following
surgery at Baylor.
   The Dallas County medical examiner's office identified the dead
man as Bobby Joe Nabors, 18, of Dallas.

   Frito-Lay Inc. is voluntarily recalling 1,576
cases of its Peanut Butter Bars in 22 states west of the
Mississippi River after testing discovered the possibility of
salmonella contamination, the company said Saturday.
   The products have date codes of ``19 Dec 88'' and ``26 Dec 88''
on the front of the package and may have reached store shelves in
the past few days, a company statement said.
   Food and Drug Administration officials have been notified, the
company said.
   The limited recall was described as precautionary and Frito-Lay
said chances of anyone becoming ill from eating the bars is
believed to be remote. Salmonella bacteria have been known to
produce food poisoning and similar intestinal illnesses.
   Consumers were being asked to return the product to Frito-Lay
for a refund.
   The states covered by the recall are: Arizona, Arkansas,
California, Colorado, Idaho, Iowa, Kansas, Louisiana, Minnesota,
Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Mexico, North Dakota,
Oklahoma, Oregon, South Dakota, Texas, Utah, Washington and Wyoming.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal authorities investigating the crash of
a small plane near Frederick, Md., were looking Saturday into
whether the crash might be connected with the landing at about the
same time of a jet carrying President Reagan.
   The wreckage of a single engine Piper Arrow that crashed Friday
evening was found in mountainous terrain west of Frederick shortly
after dawn Saturday. The pilot, identified as Ronald Lee Spring,
36, of Fairfield, Pa., was killed.
   According to the National Transportation Safety Board and the
White House, preliminary information from the Federal Aviation
Administration indicates the Piper crashed about 20 minutes after
the landing at Frederick of a small Gulfstream II jet carrying the
president.
   The president and his wife, Nancy, were bound for the
presidential retreat at Camp David and flew into nearby Frederick
airport because rain and fog prevented them from taking a
helicopter directly to the retreat.
   There was speculation that the arrival of the president's plane
might have caused the smaller plane to be ordered into a holding
pattern until Reagan's plane landed.
   Alan Pollock, a spokesman for the NTSB, said he had no
preliminary information that the Piper was ordered to hold off its
landing, but he said air traffic communications with the plane
would be reviewed as part of the investigation.
   ``We still have to check the information out,'' Pollock said.
   Maj. Robert Ayres of the Maryland wing of the Civil Air Patrol
said the Piper had two to three hours of fuel left in its tanks
when it crashed.
   White House spokeswoman Liz Murphy said the president's plane
landed at Frederick at 5:32 p.m. Friday.
   Pollock said preliminary information from the FAA showed that
the Piper was given clearance to land at 5:38 p.m. but that the
plane disappeared from radar at 5:53 p.m.

<TEXT>
   Thousands of Greeks shouting ``Andreas
we're with you!'' gave Premier Andreas Papandreou a tumultuous
welcome when he arrived at Athens Airport after being in London for
two-months because of heart surgery.
   Waving banners in the green and white colors of Papandreou's
socialist party, the crowd pushed past police and surged around the
premier's plane.
   The 69-year-old Papandreou came slowly down the steps followed
by his friend Dimitra Liani, a former airline stewardess the
premier is expected to marry.
   Papandreou said in London he plans to divorce his U.S.-born wife
Margaret, who he married in 1951. Ms Liani, 34, is divorcing
architect Alex Kapopoulos, 45.
   Speaking with reporters aboard the plane, Papandreou said he
would stay active in politics. ``With all my strength, my knowledge
and my mental and physical capacity I will continue to serve the
interests of our people,'' he said.
   Papandreou came to power in 1981 and won a second four-year term
in 1985.
   There has been some question if he would campaign actively at
the head of his Panhellenic Socialist Movement in national
elections due by June 1989.
   Papandreou underwent open-heart surgery Sept. 30 at Harefield
Hospital in London.
   He did not name a replacement during his illness and continued
to supervise the government by telephone from the hospital. Cabinet
ministers frequently flew to London to confer with him.

   The 535 men and women who made up the 100th
Congress had a very good two years or a very bad two years,
depending on your point of view.
   In the 100th Congress the Senate subways did not run on time and
senators missed votes, a shouting congressman had his mike turned
off, a senator was arrested and Oliver North stole the show at the
Iran-Contra hearings.
   In the House the telephones stopped working, nearly all of them.
   In the Senate, the telephones worked too well, picking up
conversations from other offices without the knowledge of those
doing the conversing.
   Six members of the 100th Congress ran for their party's
presidential nomination _ Reps. Richard Gephardt, D-Mo., and Jack
Kemp, R-N.Y.; and Sens. Bob Dole, R-Kan., Joseph Biden, D-Del.,
Albert Gore, D-Tenn., and Paul Simon, D-Ill.
   None of them made it.
   But two members who did not make the run _ Sens. Lloyd Bentsen,
D-Texas, and Dan Quayle, R-Ind., found themselves on their party's
ticket anyway, as someone else's vice presidential running mate.
   Biden was later to contend that the furor over plagiarism that
forced him from the race saved his life.
   Saved his life?
   Biden spent months in the hospital recovering from operations
for a brain aneurysm that was diagnosed shortly after he ended his
candidacy.
   He said, and staff members agreed, that he would have ignored
the pain and plunged ahead with his campaign had he not been forced
from the race after disclosures he had adopted parts of the
speeches of other politicians word for word.
   That could have killed him, Biden said.

   One senator was credited with saving another senator's life.
   Sen. John Kerry. D-Mass., came upon Sen. Chic Hecht, R-Nev., in
a Senate hallway, choking. A slice of apple was stuck in his throat.
   Kerry, who had never before performed the Heimlich maneuver,
applied it four times, successfully dislodging the obstruction.
   ``He's a strong guy, he picked me right up and knew just what to
do,'' said Hecht.
   Any small irony in that?
   Well, yes.
   Kerry is chairman of the Democratic senatorial election
campaign, which is doing its best to upset Hecht's bid for
re-election.

   Throughout the 100th Congress, Democrats struggled to pass a
campaign spending limitations bill over Republican opposition.
   In the end they failed.
   But the battle will be remembered.
   At 1:30 a.m. one day last March, Republicans fled the Senate
floor to prevent a quorum from being established and to force the
Democratic leadership to adjourn.
   A call went out for the sergeant-at-arms to arrest absent
senators.
   Sergeant-at-Arms Henry Giugni used a master key to enter the
private office of Sen. Robert Packwood, R-Ore.
   Packwood was arrested and escorted to the Senate chamber.
   But he refused to enter.
   Giugni ordered a squad of detectives to lift Packwood from his
feet and to carry him inside.
   They did so and his presence gave the Democrats a quorum and the
Republicans a severe case of outrage.
   The Senate remained in session all night.

   The Senate worried about its ``quality of life.''
   Younger senators, especially those with children, grumbled about
legislative chaos, sessions that stretched deep into the night,
roll calls that stretched far beyond their allotted 15 minutes, a
``Tuesday-Thursday Club'' that saw senators stretch a two-day
weekend into four.
   Action was taken.
   In exchange for time off every fourth week, senators were
expected to be present Monday through Friday for the rest of the
month.
   Roll calls were restricted to 15 minutes with no waiting for
senators who did not show up on time.
   Almost immediately the law of unintended consequences went into
effect.
   With the 15-minute clock running, a band of senators piled off
elevators in the subway lobby of the Hart Senate Office building.
   The roofless, three-car train was waiting.
   But it was filled with visitors who happened to be blind.
   It took a while for the senators to get possession of the train.
   Fuming, they stormed onto the Senate floor minutes after the
roll call ended, only to be told that they could not vote and would
not be recorded.
   Now, during roll calls, the trains are reserved for the
exclusive transportation of senators.

   Senate oratory can get heated, and at times just a little
twisted.
   As the 100th Congress neared its end, Sen. Steve Symms,
R-Idaho., complained at length about the failure of Congress to
provide further military aid to the Contras in Nicaragua.
   He said:
   ``The gutless no-good 100th Congress on this issue has decided
to create its own doctrine, and that is to write it off.
   ``In other words, we will write off freedom in Nicaragua, throw
them to the alligators and hope the alligators will eat someone
else and eat us last and they can peel off a slice of that salami
and they will not bother us for now. Do not rock the boat.''

   Sen. William Proxmire, D-Wis., made the last speech of his
31-year Senate career.
   He said the job of being a U.S. senator was the best job in the
world, better even than being president of the United States.
   Senate Majority Leader Robert C. Byrd, D-W.Va., rose to praise
both speech and senator.
   Both were, Byrd said, ``Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious.''
   That, he said, means ``good.''

   Rep. Gary Ackerman, D-N.Y., also felt good.
   Ackerman used to weigh more than 280 pounds.
   He dieted. He exercised. And, in triumph, he went to the House
floor to announce he had lost more than 100 pounds.
   ``The House historian has confirmed that my weight loss is the
biggest of any member of Congress in history,'' the congressman
crowed.

   Sen. Daniel K. Inouye, D-Hawaii, presided over the congressional
Iran-Contra hearings wearing dark glasses to protect his eyes,
which were damaged by the glaring brightness of television lights
when he served as a member of the Senate Watergate Committee.
   But Inouye, who is of Japanese descent, said that the
Iran-Contra investigation was not the highlight of his year.
   The senator, who is also chairman of the Senate Indian affairs
subcommittee, was made an honorary Navajo at a sunrise ceremony on
a ridge in New Mexico and given a title: ``The Chief Who Returns
With a Plan.''
   ``I have a lot of plans,'' said Inouye, who, with his
colleague's consent, hopes to become majority leader in the 101st
Congress.

   Three foreigners who formerly were
Roman Catholic priests were expelled to neighboring Argentina
Saturday accused of distributing Marxist material, Asuncion radio
stations reported.
   The three, Antonio Cagna and Silvano Tessei of Italy and Michel
Derieux of Belgium, were arrested Oct. 13. An Interior Ministry
communique said they entered Paraguay as priests of the Franciscan
order years ago and then left the priesthood and married
Paraguayans.
   On Friday the government expelled Peter Paul Theis of West
Germany, also a former priest, on the same charges Friday. Theis
was sent to Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.
   ``The intended purpose of the dissemination of material of
Marxist content is the direct incitation to violence, and the
development of class warfare,'' the ministry said in a communique
Friday.
   The three men expelled Saturday were sent to Clorinda,
Argentina, 31 miles southeast of the capital of Asuncion.

<TEXT>
   One of three trapped whales was presumed
dead Saturday, but its companions inched toward open water as
Eskimos cut a string of breathing holes and a helicopter battering
ram smashed a path through thick ice.
   ``They certainly have a very good fighting chance in their
battle to escape,'' David Withrow, a federal marine mammal
biologist, said Saturday.
   However, a huge ridge formed by colliding ice masses stood in
the way of a breakthrough for the California gray whales, members
of an endangered species. The big marine mammals were about four
miles from open water.
   A second ice-smashing Skycrane cargo helicopter was standing by
two hours away in Prudhoe Bay in case rescuers decided a second
concrete ice-bashing ``bullet'' was needed.
   And at White House direction, the Air Force assigned the largest
aircraft in its inventory _ the C-5A Galaxy _ to ferry more
equipment from Prudhoe Bay to Barrow, Air Force Maj. Doug McCoy
said Saturday.
   The whale nicknamed Bone disappeared beneath the foot-thick ice
Friday afternoon. By midnight Friday, rescuers on the ice near this
small Eskimo town on the Arctic Ocean had given up hope Bone might
rejoin the others.
   North Slope Borough biologist Geoff Carroll said the whale was
presumed dead.
   ``Everyone is sorry to hear about the whale, but I don't think
it was totally unexpected,'' Carroll said Saturday. He had told
reporters earlier the whale was the weakest of the three, and had
some respiratory problems.
   Bone, Crossbeak and Bonnet became trapped at a small breathing
hole in unseasonably heavy ice more than two weeks ago during their
annual migration south. Open water was too far away for them to
reach it without surfacing to breathe.
   The missing whale got its name because skin on its snout had
been rubbed to the bone by the rough ice surrounding the breathing
hole. That condition may have led to Bone's death, said biologist
Craig George.
   ``Once they get a bone infection, they go pretty quick,'' George
said.
   The whale's body probably sank to the bottom but may float in a
few days because of gases from decomposition, George said. ``We'll
either find it or a (polar) bear will,'' he said. Polar bears feed
on whale carcasses.
   Something will have to be done about the ice ridge, and soon, if
the remaining whales are to be freed, said Col. Tom Carroll, in
charge of the Alaska National Guard's two Skycrane helicopters on
loan for the rescue.
   ``We looked for an alternate route (bypassing the ridge) and
didn't find it,'' he said. ``If there's no way through it, it will
have to be tackled early while the whales still are some ways from
it.''
   The ridge lies about a quarter-mile from an area of open water
leading to the open sea.
   The ridge was believed to be too thick to be punctured by the
helicopters' five-ton, steel-reinforced concrete hammers, and local
ice specialists were assessing the situation Saturday, said Geoff
Carroll. ``I think we're going to blast,'' he said.
   Bone disappeared about the same time rescuers had their greatest
success.
   About two dozen Eskimo volunteers, many of them bowhead whale
hunters, led the whales almost a half-mile closer to open water
Friday by using chain saws to carve a string of 10-by-30-foot
breathing holes. They continued carving holes on Saturday.
   De-icers, which keep the holes open by agitating the water,
freed the Eskimos to work on new holes.
   ``After waiting so long for high tech equipment, it's the local
people who have kind of taken over and made some progress,''
Carroll said.
   The whales, meanwhile, were swimming from hole to hole,
apparently responding to efforts to lead them to open water,
biologists said.
   ``Their swimming patterns now are about what you'd expect them
to be,'' said Withrow, who is from Seattle.
   Biologists removed a de-icing machine from the whales' original
hole late Friday and started one of the machines in the most
distant new hole. They also shined a bright light in the farthest
hole.
   In a matter of minutes, the whales popped up in that hole,
touching off a chorus of cheers from people on the ice.
   Rescuers shoveled snow and ice into the original hole Friday
evening in an effort to seal it and discourage the whales from
returning. But late Friday, they did just that, nosing up through
the slush.
   ``That's OK,'' Morris said. ``It's just a little retrogression.
We're in good shape.''
   The first huge CH-54 Skycrane helicopter loaned by the Guard
worked in the opposite direction from the Eskimo crews, working
from the open water back toward the whales, so as not to frighten
the mammals.
   The aircraft, designed to haul heavy cargo, used a concrete
block suspended from its cargo hook to punch four 15- to 20-foot
holes in the ice at 75-yard intervals.
   ``They hover the helicopter 20 feet over the ice, and drop the
`bullet,''' said Spec. 4 Wade Palmer, a Guard spokesman. ``It drops
through the ice on the second or third try. Then they pull it back
out.''
   The second Skycrane abandoned the repeatedly frustrated effort
to drag a 185-ton, icebreaking ``hover-barge'' 230 miles from the
oil fields at Prudhoe Bay.
   The population of endangered California gray whales has risen to
about 20,000, growing at an annual average of 2.5 percent for the
past decade, officials said.
   The whales spend their winters in the warm water off Mexico's
Baja California and Southern California and summer in the food-rich
northern seas.

Hurricane Joan.
   The death toll from the storm had reached 33 by Saturday, while
more than 77,000 people had been evacuated from their homes.
   Oxfam America of Boston hoped to get canned food, powdered milk,

   Austad, who died Thursday of heart disease, was appointed U.S.
ambassador to Finland in 1974, and was the U.S. ambassador to
Norway from 1980 to 1984.
   The Norwegian government awarded him the Great Cross of St.
Olav, the highest civilian honor, for his help in fighting heart
disease. He raised large amounts of money for research and arranged
for American doctors to teach Norwegian doctors heart surgery
techniques.
   Austad began his career in broadcasting at station KSL in Salt
Lake City, and later succeeded Arthur Godfrey as the CBS Washington
commentator. He was a founding trust member of Metromedia, where he
was vice president from 1961 to 1981.
   He was vice chairman of the 1972 inauguration of President Nixon
and was a delegate to the United Nations General Assembly.
   He served on the boards of the National Association of
Broadcasters, The National Chamber of Commerce, the International
Heart Foundation, the Arizona Heart Institute Board and the
Disabled American Veterans.
   Austad is survived by his wife, Lola Brown, and three daughters.

   A former housing authority official who said
he was inspired to steal more than $120,000 to help starving
villagers in his native Ghana was sentenced to two years in jail
and ordered to pay back the money.
   U.S. District Judge Marvin Katz on Friday also sentenced Anthony
Andoh, 43, to five years' probation after the jail term and ordered
him to pay back $126,337 in public housing funds stolen from the
Philadelphia Housing Authority and the New Haven Housing Authority
in Connecticut.
   Andoh was the finance director for the Philadelphia agency in
1985 and 1986, and the finance director for the New Haven agency in
1984 and early 1985.
   He pleaded guilty in July to stealing $48,314 from the
Philadelphia agency and to embezzling $78,023 from the New Haven
agency, but said in court Friday that he was moved to do so by the
suffering in the African country of Ghana.
   ``What I saw in Ghana in 1980 when I visited was synonymous with
the Holocaust,'' Andoh said. ``People were dying by the thousands.
People were fleeing the country. Everyone was suffering. They were
struggling just to get something to eat.''
   Andoh said those images haunted him when he returned to the
United States and inspired him to steal.
   Investigators found no evidence of Andoh giving any of the money
to charity.

<DATELINE>BLACKFOOT, Idaho (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A boxcar filled with radioactive waste
was headed back to the Rocky Flats nuclear weapons plant in
Colorado on Saturday, three days after Gov. Cecil Andrus banned the
temporary storage in Idaho of any new shipments.
   The boxcar full of low-level nuclear waste had been in limbo at
a rail yard in the eastern Idaho city of Blackfoot, the last stop
before a temporary waste storage facility at the U.S. Department of
Energy's Idaho National Engineering Laboratory about 35 miles
northwest of here.
   It originated at the DOE's Rocky Flats facility, 16 miles
northwest of Denver, but was stopped after Andrus issued an order
Wednesday banning the storage of additional waste at the lab.
   ``The boxcar will return to Rocky Flats and we'll probably just
leave it on our siding until we get permission to ship it someplace
else,'' said Charles Bogard, shift superintendent at Rocky Flats.
   The boxcar left Blackfoot mid-afternoon Saturday. An Idaho State
Police officer and a Union Pacific railroad agent had kept an eye
on the boxcar while it was in Blackfoot. It had been inspected for
safety by an environmental engineer from the Idaho National
Engineering Laboratory.
   Lab spokeswoman Penny Phelps said the decision was made late
Friday by Energy Department officials in Idaho, Colorado and
Washington.
   ``Primarily, the decision was made to kind of clear the air and
remove what we considered a contentious item,'' Mrs. Phelps said.
   The move was delayed by the need to examine the potential impact
of returning the waste to Rocky Flats, she said. ``It's not as easy
as turning your car around and driving back.''
   Andrus issued the order in an effort to force the Energy
Department to open the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant near Carlsbad,
N.M., the nation's first permanent repository for
defense-generated, low-level nuclear waste.
   More than 2 million cubic feet of low-level radioactive waste
already is stored above ground at the Idaho lab, awaiting transfer
to a permanent dump like the one in New Mexico, which was supposed
to open this month, but has been postponed until at least January.
   ``They have broken their word too many times,'' said Andrus, who
traveled to the New Mexico site last week. ``They cannot give us a
date.''
   ``Hopefully the opening of the WIPP facility will be the final
solution,'' Rocky Flats' Bogard said Saturday. ``We have about 90
days capacity and space on the plant site that's available where we
could safely store it.''
   The opening of the New Mexico site was pushed back after DOE
engineers raised questions about the safety of the proposed
repository. There have also been delays in certifying the casks
that will carry the waste to the site.
   New Mexico Gov. Garrey Carruthers said New Mexico communities
will object to opening the site until Congress provides money for
road bypasses and improvements on the route to the site.
   The Idaho governor won an assurance from Don Ofte, manager of
the Idaho laboratory, on Friday that the DOE will voluntarily abide
by his ban on all further shipment of waste into Idaho.
   The bulk of the waste at the lab, built up over two decades, has
come from the Rocky Flats plant. Other facilities also have been
ordered to stop shipping waste to the lab.
   Andrus said a westbound truckload of waste from the Argonne
National Laboratory in Illinois was turned back at Little America,
Wyo., after federal officials were notified it would be intercepted
by state police at the Idaho border.
   Meanwhile, an Oct. 19 letter from Sen. Tim Wirth, D-Colo., to
Energy Secretary John Herrington indicated the DOE began assessing
the storage situation only after Andrus blockaded Idaho.
   Wirth, in his letter to Herrington, again pressed for a list of
contingency plans to cope with the Andrus ban, declaring that in
his state ``the situation has changed from urgent to critical.''
   Wirth said Deputy Energy Secretary Joseph Salgado had notified
him Wednesday afternoon, shortly after Andrus imposed the ban, that
``he was pulling together an internal DOE working group to assess''
the governor's action.

<TEXT>
   Thousands of Nicaraguans, unfamiliar
with hurricanes and jaded by repeated warnings of possible U.S.
invasions, refused to flee Hurricane Joan's deadly path Saturday.
   The hurricane, with 125 mph winds, destroyed about 90 percent of
the buildings in the Caribbean city of Bluefields and slashed
through the Corn Islands off the Nicaraguan coast. The two areas
have a population of about 68,000.
   Although thousands were evacuated, thousands of others remained
in their homes despite warnings, President Daniel Ortega said in a
speech broadcast on radio and television.
   Initial reports said 15 Nicaraguans were killed Saturday and the
overall death toll from the storm that began ravaging the South and
Central American coasts last Monday was at least 65 in Nicaragua,
Costa Rica, Panama, Colombia and Venezuela.
   The hurricane weakened to a tropical storm, but torrential rains
continued and Nicaraguan officials said they would order forced
evacuations if need be as the storm struck Managua, 180 miles west
of Bluefields.
   David Zuniga, director of civil defense, angrily called for
people to go to shelters.
   ``Sandinista police and the EPS (the army) have orders to
evacuate by force if necessary,'' Zuniga said on television.
   Some who refused to evacuate low-lying ground said they didn't
believe the government, which has on numerous occasions called on
the people to mobilize against a U.S. invasion.
   ``The people were tired of these calls. They don't believe
them,'' said Ruben Hernandez, who refused to evacuate his home in
the Las Torres neighborhood on the edge of Lake Managua.
   ``The government has told us so many lies that we just don't
believe them any more,'' said a Managua woman who spoke with the
condition she not be identified.
   Others said people didn't realize what damage a hurricane could
inflict _ the last hurricane to strike Nicaragua was in 1911.
Government radio repeatedly issued storm warnings.
   Ortega said during his address that he had visited Bluefields on
Friday and urged people to leave.
   ``I told the people to leave their homes because it is easier to
rebuild your home than to reconstruct your life,'' he said.
   Only a few thousand people left Bluefields in a government
evacuation program Friday, although others fled coastal zones.
   Authorities feared Joan's heavy rains could cause more flooding,
especially in Managua, which is relatively flat and poorly drained.
   Thousands of refugees from the seven-year civil war with the
U.S.-supported rebels known as Contras have moved into Managuya,
swelling its population to 1 million. Many live in wooden shacks
beside dirt fields.
   Civil defense committees piled sand bags in front of many
buildings, cut tree limbs that might be blown down and cleared
drainage ditches. Windows of the eight-story Hotel Intercontinental
were taped over.

   Polls are illuminating an electorate in turmoil,
with voters still groping _ some of them dispiritedly _ toward a
decision in the presidential election, analysts say.
   While surveys indicate a healthy George Bush lead, striking
differences in gauging the size of the lead underline a certain
unhappiness with the choices, some pollsters said in recent days.
   And that means things still can change with just over two weeks
to go, they said.
   ``People are having lots of second thoughts,'' said Andrew
Kohut, president of the Gallup Organization. Even in polls that
have found stable results for weeks, he said, ``I term it stable
uncertainty.''
   Several pollsters _ but not all _ agreed with such an analysis:
That a good number of voters, even at this late date, remain
loosely committed to either Bush or to Democrat Michael Dukakis,
and could change their minds.
   ``I see more indecision than usual, and I ascribe that a lot to
the negativism of the campaign,'' said I.A. Lewis, chief of polling
for the Los Angeles Times. ``I think there's a kind of reluctance
for people to commit themselves to one of two people, neither of
whom they like.''
   Lewis, in the Times poll, has found that four in 10 of Dukakis'
supporters and nearly three in 10 of Bush's oppose the other
candidate more than they favor their own _ hardly an inspiring
reason to cast a vote.
   Gallup has found less than half of each candidate's supporters
backing him strongly, and a sizable share, roughly three in 10,
saying they could change their minds. And in an NBC News-Wall
Street Journal poll, 57 percent of likely voters wished they had a
different set of choices.
   ``Neither of these guys seems to attract the kind of commitment
that some other presidential candidates have had,'' said Larry
Hugick, political pollster for Gallup. Even though Gallup has found
a stable Bush lead since August, he said, ``If you look at the
depth of commitment, you'll see there's still potential for
change.''
   The view of a still-volatile electorate was not unanimous. Jeff
Alderman, pollster for ABC News, saw a more stable contest. His
surveys, like Gallup's bi-weekly ones, have found a steady lead for
Bush, and he has found considerably stronger support for the
candidates than Gallup has.
   ``My polling doesn't show very much volatility at all,'' said
Alderman, who has polled every night since Labor Day. ``There's a
clear indication of a very stable race.''
   But not all polls are in line with each other.
   An NBC-Journal poll, taken Friday through Sunday last weekend,
found an enormous 17-point Bush lead. A Harris poll Friday to
Monday the same weekend put it down to nine points. And an
ABC-Washington Post poll from the previous Wednesday to Tuesday put
it at seven, roughly where it's been for weeks.
   Most recently, a Newsweek poll of 1,013 registered voters
conducted by telephone on Thursday and Friday showed Bush leading
Dukakis 50 percent to 41 percent, with a margin of error of 4
percentage points.
   NBC pollster Laurily Epstein said her poll could have caught a
swing to Bush after the presidential debate last week, then missed
some shifting back to Dukakis on Monday. She noted that Bush
received wide publicity as the debate winner.
   Other pollsters shared her view, noting that Dukakis surged
after the Democratic convention last summer and Bush after the
Republican convention, but settled back as the publicity wore off.
   Their hypothesis: When voters don't have strong opinions, they
are more likely to be influenced by events, albeit momentarily.
   ``Polling immediately after momentous events catches people in
the process of making up their minds. What you see are these
distortions,'' said Kohut, the Gallup president. He likened it to a
runner's pulse after a race: ``It's an accurate reading. But you
can't generalize a lot from it.''
   Kohut and others said such skittishness in the electorate
magnifies the methodological differences in polls _ whether or not
they urge undecided voters to make a choice, for example _ and can
help skew results.

   Britain on Sunday reverted from Summer Time to
Greenwich Mean Time, moving clocks back one hour at 2 a.m. to 1
a.m. Ireland did the same.
   The traditional change again put Britain out of step with most
of Western Europe, which is one hour ahead of GMT in winter and two
hours ahead in summer.
   Summer Time, lasting from March to October, was first introduced
in 1916 to provide an extra evening hour of light for farmers and
save electricity during World War I. But it also means mornings are
darker for an hour.

   Republican presidential nominee George Bush picked up editorial
endorsements Saturday from newspapers in Chicago, New York and
Cleveland while Democrat Michael Dukakis won endorsements from
papers in Atlanta, St. Louis and Dayton, Ohio.
   The Chicago Tribune and the Chicago Sun-Times each endorsed Bush
in their Sunday editions, though the Tribune lamented the quality
of the campaign and Bush's choice of Sen. Dan Quayle, R-Ind., as a
running mate.
   Also endorsing Bush in their Sunday editions were the New York
Daily News, which said there are more fitting candidates than he or
Dukakis but that ``none will be on the ballot,'' and the Plain
Dealer of Cleveland.
   ``In a time of peace and prosperity, even a prosperity built on
credit, most voters don't want to take a chance,'' the Plain Dealer
said, adding that voters know more about Bush than Dukakis.
   The Atlanta Journal and The Atlanta Constitution said in their
joint Sunday editions Dukakis would ``strike the newer course of
the two'' candidates and ``... has shown a far better grasp of the
nation and its people.''
   The St. Louis Post-Dispatch said in its Sunday editions that
Dukakis ``has been more realistic'' than Bush in addressing the
trade and federal budget deficits and ``has set forth a humane and
enlightened social policy.''
   Dukakis also picked up an endorsement from the Dayton Daily News
in Ohio, which said in its Sunday editions that he ``has a keener
intellect than George Bush.''
   The Chicago Tribune called Bush's campaign ``abysmal'' but said
it favors him over Dukakis because ``we agree more with what he
says and fear less his leadership in the White House.''
   The Sun-Times said Bush was its ``emphatic choice'' for
president and called the Republican ``probably the most experienced
candidate ever to run for president.''

   Democrat Michael Dukakis defended his
record on crime Saturday in the South, where his prospects have
been hurt by George Bush's allegations on the subject.
   Later, in a taped speech on ABC-TV, the Democratic presidential
candidate accused Bush of waging a campaign ``of fear and of
smear.''
   At sunup Saturday, Dukakis spoke at a crowded pipefitters union
hall in Beaumont, accompanied by his running mate, Texas Sen. Lloyd
Bentsen. He capped the day by speaking back-to-back with Bush
before the National Italian American Foundation in Washington.
   ``Many of you know the vice president's been going to a lot of
ethnic festivals lately,'' Dukakis told the Italian group.
``George, it would have saved you a lot of time if you'd just
picked Pete Domenici to be your running mate.'' Domenici, a
Republican senator from New Mexico, is the son of Italian
immigrants.
   Dukakis, who delivered part of his address in Italian, repeated
many of the same self-deprecating jokes that he delivered at the Al
Smith dinner in New York two days earlier.
   On a serious note, he told the group: ``The immigrants' dream is
the American dream. It is now in our hands. We must never forget
that dream belongs not just to the privileged few but to all of
us.''
   Earlier, Dukakis visited Hawkinsville, Ga., for a barbecue rally
with top Georgia Democrats in what was to be a show of solidarity
in a major Southern state where the campaign has been in trouble.
   Before some 4,000 people at a rally in a high school football
field in rural Georgia, Dukakis was joined by former President
Jimmy Carter and the state's top elected Democrats.
   ``People say there's not a very good chance that we'll have a
governor from Massachusetts in the White House,'' Carter said.
``But I think that we and you and Mike Dukakis and Lloyd Bentsen
can turn it around.''
   Sen. Sam Nunn denounced Bush's campaign as one of ``distortions
and in many cases outright and total lies.''
   Attacking Bush's use of the case of furloughed inmate Willie
Horton, who attacked a family while released from a Massachusetts
prison, Nunn described in graphic detail the rape and murder of a
pregnant young mother by an inmate furloughed from a federal prison
under President Reagan _ and said it was Richard Nixon who signed
into law the federal furlough program.
   ``A governor and a president cannot prevent all the horrible
crimes we have today, even though it's on his watch,'' Nunn said.
``A presidential candidate, though, can be expected to tell the
truth and put it in perspective. And Vice President Bush has a duty
to do that.''
   The case of Patsy Pedrin is one Dukakis is usuing in new
television ads and which he spoke about earlier Texas and Louisiana
_ while saying he would ``never use that kind of human tragedy''
for political purposes.
   In both Texas and Georgia, where he campaigned Saturday, and in
Louisiana where he was Friday night, Dukakis trails Bush in polls
by as much as 10 points.
   In his Texas speech, Dukakis recounted the crimes of a prisoner
released on furlough from a federal prison while Bush was vice
president.
   ``I would never use that kind of human tragedy to accuse the
president of being soft on crime,'' Dukakis said. ``Maybe that's
the difference beteen me and George Bush.''
   In his television speech, which was set for 10:55 p.m. EDT on
ABC, Dukakis spoke of the beating and robbing of his father and the
hit-and-run death of his brother as examples of how ``my family has
been touched by violence.''
   ``I've led the fight against crime and drugs in my own state and
I intend to do so as president,'' he said.
   Before the rally with state party leaders in Georgia, state
Democratic chairman John Henry Anderson said, ``With this kind of
show of support, it sends a signal to the people of this state that
we're comfortable with our nominee.''

<HEAD>Hodel Proposes Cutting 2,000 Positions from Department</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Interior Secretary Donald Hodel has proposed
cutting 2,000 jobs in his 69,000-employee department, starting a
year from now, according to a report in The New York Times' Sunday
editions.
   An internal memorandum disclosed that Hodel proposed turning
many of those jobs over to private contractors, according to the
newspaper, which said it obtained the memo from sources outside the
government.
   More than 500 of the proposed cuts would be made in the National
Park Service, the Times said. The proposal calls for a study of the
feasibility of turning over to the private sector such jobs as
orientation services for park visitors and park maintenance.
   The proposal also suggests turning the map-making function of
the U.S. Geological Survey over to private enterprise, the Times
said.
   The memo was written by Richard Ventura, the assistant interior
secretary for policy, budget and administration.
   A department spokesman, Alan Levitt, said a second memorandum
stressed that no employees would be forced to retire. He said
normal attrition in the department was higher than the number of
proposed cuts.

<HEAD>Demonstrators Angry over `Sleazy, Cheap' TV Drama</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An AIDS support organization Saturday
called an NBC-TV series sleazy for an episode depicting the
fictitious murder of a bisexual man who knowingly infects sexual
partners with the deadly virus.
   ``NBC should not exploit the human tragedy of the AIDS epidemic
to increase rating points and profits,'' said Timothy Wolfred,
executive director of the San Francisco AIDS Foundation.
   Fearing the episode would unleash violence against carriers of
the virus, 60 demonstrators earlier this week shut down the
shooting on an outdoor scene of ``Midnight Caller,'' an action
drama series set in San Francisco. The first episode is scheduled
to air Tuesday night.
   The protests, set to resume Monday when Lorimar productions
resumes shooting, began after negotiations between several AIDS
groups, the show's producers, NBC officials and representatives of
the mayor's office failed to reach an agreement on changes in the
script.
   ``We are not asking NBC and the producers to cancel a `Midnight
Caller' episode on AIDS,'' Wolfred said in a statement Saturday.
``We would wholeheartedly support an episode that promotes
understanding of HIV disease.''
   A handout distributed with the statement called the disputed
episode, which will be shown sometime in the future, ``sleazy ...
sensational .... cheap television drama.''
   NBC said it has agreed to talk more with demonstrators next week
but insisted shooting will resume on Monday.
   In the episode in question, a bisexual man carrying the AIDS
virus purposely infects others by having sexual relations with
them. One of the partners, a woman who discovers she carries the
AIDS virus, shoots and kills the man at the end of the episode.
   Bob Singer, executive producer of the program, said he decided
to leave the murder in the script but that he asked for revisions
to reflect demonstrators' concerns.
   ``The hero says that the murder is absolutely the wrong
solution,'' said Singer. ``No one watching it could think we were
condoning this by any stretch of the imagination.''

   Michael Dukakis pressed his counterattack against front-runner
George Bush on Saturday, blaming a Bush campaign ``of fear and of
smear'' for distorting his image to voters. Bush disavowed Illinois
GOP ads asserting rapists and murderers vote for Dukakis.
   The two presidential candidates later capped their campaign days
by making back-to-back appearances before a National Italian
American Foundation banquet in Washington, sharing a dais for the
second time in three days.
   Dukakis repeated many of the same self-deprecating jokes he had
delivered when he and Bush addressed the Al Smith dinner in New
York earlier in the week, but on a more serious note, told the
Italian group: ``The immigrants' dream is the American dream. It is
now in our hands. We must never forget that dream belongs not just
to the privileged few but to all of us.''
   Bush maintained a serious tone throughout his remarks, recalling
his emotions when he has witnessed immigrants take the oath of U.S.
citizenship.
   ``I saw their tears of joy and felt their appreciation of the
American dream,'' Bush told the crowd. ``We share that joy tonight
... and we resolve together as Americans to preserve and protect
and, indeed, extend it in the years ahead.''
   In a taped-for-television speech, Dukakis touched on criticism
of his campaign style in a race in which all polls show him
trailing. ``I may not wear my heart on my sleeve,'' he said, but he
promised that in the remaining two weeks he would ``fight my heart
out for the things I believe in.''
   His remarks came in a five-minute speech his campaign paid to
air on ABC-TV at 10:55 p.m. EDT.
   Earlier, Dukakis and running mate Lloyd Bentsen campaigned in
Texas and Dukakis joined state party officials in a show of
solidarity in Georgia _ two Southern states where polls suggest
Bush has made headway by portraying the Democrat as soft on crime.
   Dukakis took the issue on in his speech, saying simply: ``In
their TV ads, the Republicans accuse me of being soft on criminals.
That's a lie.''
   Bush, in a brief appearance at his Washington home, dissociated
himself from one printed ad along that line.
   He was asked about brochures distributed by the state Republican
Party in Illinois with a headline saying, ``All the Murderers and
Rapists and Drug Pushers and Child Molesters in Masschusetts Vote
For Michael Dukakis.''
   Asked if he approved, Bush said, ``No I don't, and I don't back
some of the stuff they're saying about me. ... No I disapprove of
that.'' He didn't say what he objected to on the Democratic side.
   Bush was questioned after he met privately with former Cuban
prisoner Armando Valladares, who was freed after 22 years in 1982.
   On another matter, Bush was asked to comment on the racketeering
indictment of former Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos.
   ``That speaks for itself, and let the justice system go forward;
that's what I say,'' he said.
   Bush's running mate Dan Quayle, who was out of the public eye
Saturday, said in an interview Friday night that the two campaigns'
concentration on producing 15-second ``sound bites'' for evening
news shows wasn't so bad because ``one-liners say a lot.''
   ``The information is out there'' for voters to make their
decisions, he said.
   Dukakis' televised speech was part of a concerted effort by the
Dukakis campaign to reach a wider audience.
   He also is airing a tough new set of commercials accusing Bush
of distortions and lies and is planning a number of other
television appearances, including an interview Tuesday on the ABC
show, ``Nightline.''
   Bush has repeatedly criticized Dukakis for a former
Massachusetts prisoner-furlough program under which an inmate
failed to return after a weekend pass and later attacked a Maryland
couple.
   Dukakis, in a speech Saturday in Beaumont, Texas, recounted the
crimes of a prisoner who raped and murdered a pregnant young mother
after being released on furlough from a federal prison.
   ``I would never use that kind of human tragedy to accuse the
president of being soft on crime,'' Dukakis said. ``Maybe that's
the difference between me and George Bush.''
   National polls show Bush leading Dukakis by margins ranging from
seven to 17 points. And state polls show Dukakis trailing in such
key states as California, Texas and Ohio that are critical to his
hopes for victory on Nov. 8.
   Dukakis said in the taped TV speech that he enters the final two
weeks of the campaign an underdog and that ``some of you don't know
much more about me than a name and a set of labels.''
   ``Part of the fault may rest with our own effort,'' he said.
``But I think it is also fair to say that the other side has
pursued a campaign of distortion and distraction _ of fear and of
smear.''
   He cited Bush campaign ads attacking him for the Massachusetts
prison furlough program and for pollution in Boston Harbor.
   ``Are you satisifed with what you are hearing this year?'' he
asked. ``Do you think this is the way to pick the president of the
United States?''
   ``It isn't easy for the truth to catch up with the lies,'' he
said. ``And to clear up the fog of deception that has been spread
across the campaign.
   ``But I am determined to fight this fight.''
   ``I may not wear my heart on my sleeve, but I hope tonight you
have some sense of what is in my heart. And in the remaining days
of this campaign, I intend to fight my heart out for the things
that I believe in.''
   Responding to the Bush ads on crime, he mentioned the beating
and robbing of his father and the hit-and-run death of his brother
as examples of how ``my family has been touched by violence.''
   ``I've led the fight against crime and drugs in my own state and
I intend to do so as president,'' he said.
   President Reagan, in his weekly radio address, derided Dukakis'
campaign slogan of ``good jobs at good wages,'' contending it
amounts to a slur against such hard-working Americans as
``short-order chefs.''
   In the Democratic response, Senate Majority Leader Robert C.
Byrd of West Virginia said, ``We need a president who has a plan
for making the trade deficit a trade surplus, who is willing to
make a real commitment to ending the policy of borrow and debt that
has put us into a sea of red ink.''

   Vice President George Bush said Saturday he
does not approve of campaign literature that Republicans in
Illinois distributed saying Democrat Michael Dukakis is supported
by rapists, murderers and other criminals.
   ``No I don't and I don't back some of the stuff they're saying
about me. ... No I disapprove of that,'' Bush said, without
elaborating on what in particular he was taking exception to on the
Democratic side.
   He made the statement in answer to a question following a
meeting Saturday with former Cuban political prisoner Armando
Valladares, who was freed after 22 years in 1982.
   Bush called the Cuban, who wrote the book ``Against All Hope,''
an ``inspiration to all who are for human rights.''
   At a banquet Saturday night sponsored by the National Italian
American Foundation, Bush and Dukakis shared a dais for the second
time in three days.
   They shook hands briefly and both applauded politely as the
other was introduced. Before the dinner, Bush met briefly with
former Italian Prime Minister Bettino Craxi.
   In brief remarks, the vice president recalled his emotions when
he has witnessed immigrants take the oath of U.S. citizenship.
   ``I saw their tears of joy and felt their appreciation of the
American dream,'' Bush told the crowd of 3,000 attending the
dinner. ``We share that joy tonight ... and we resolve together as
Americans to preserve and protect and, indeed, extend it in the
years ahead.''
   Bush's campaign also announced the formation of Catholics for
Bush-Quayle '88, to be headed by former GOP Cabinet members William
Simon and William Bennett, Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., and
conservative activist Phyllis Schlafly.
   In general, the vice president was spending a quiet weekend
mostly out of the campaign spotlight. He planned to head to New
England on Monday, then begin an extended campaign trip across the
country.
   On another matter raised by questioners outside his residence
Saturday, Bush responded briefly when asked for a comment on the
racketeering indictment of former Philippine President Ferdinand
Marcos.
   ``That speaks for itself, and let the justice system go forward;
that's what I say,'' said Bush.
   The indictment returned Friday in New York alleges Marcos and
his wife Imelda defrauded three U.S. lending institutions of $165
million in order to buy and finance real estate in New York, and
amassed $103 million through embezzlement, bribes and kickbacks
then laundered the money through secret bank accounts.
   Bush said little about the presidential campaign except in
answer to a question about the Illinois brochures.
   Distributed by the state party, they bore the headline, ``All
the Murderers and Rapists and Drug Pushers and Child Molesters in
Masschusetts Vote For Michael Dukakis.''
   Bush has consistently sought to portray Dukakis as soft on
crime, citing in particular Massachusetts' former prisoner-furlough
program.
   Dukakis held up the Illinois brochures in campaign appearances
Wednesday and called them ``political garbage.''

   In what may have been his final remarks on the
Senate floor, Democrat John Stennis of Mississippi said Friday that
in ``thinking over the years that have passed so rapidly'' he's
concluded the most needed quality in a lawmaker is the willingness
to cooperate.
   The end of the 100th Congress marks the end of Stennis' Senate
career, dating to 1947. He will remain a senator until the 101st
Congress convenes in January.
   At 87, he is the chamber's oldest member, its president pro tem
and chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee.
   The senator, who lost a leg to cancer in 1983, spoke from his
wheelchair stationed next to the mahogany desk he used for much of
his career. The desk once belonged to Jefferson Davis.
   Stennis hailed the teamwork displayed over the last two years by
Senate Majority Leader Robert C. Byrd, D-W.Va., and Republican
Leader Bob Dole of Kansas.
   ``I believe these two have proved the necessity of
cooperation,'' Stennis said.
   He then referred to a recent landmark of cooperation, the summit
conference that was convened after the stock market crash last year
to set spending limits and plot deficit reductions.
   ``In thinking over the years that have passed so rapidly one of
the things that have given me renewed faith in our system is the
summit conference last year in which members of the House, the
Senate and the president met for many hours, day and night,'' he
said.
   ``It gives me strength as I leave here,'' Stennis said.
   Stennis, whose Senate carer has spanned the terms of eight
presidents, remains cheerful and upbeat.
   He emphasizes that he is leaving the Senate only because of his
age and health and would really have preferred to stay.
   ``He's talked about how he will miss the Senate but also about
what he intends to do to stay be busy,'' said Rex Buffington,
Stennis' press secretary. ``He's promised that he will stay busy
and productive; he just won't be sitting around.''
   He said that while Stennis has made no definitive plans, ``he
will look for opportunities to share his experiences, with young
people in particular.''
   Stennis plans to return to his home in De Kalb, Miss., after
closing his office here.
   ``He never admitted he moved away,'' Buffington said. ``He's
always said his home is DeKalb, Miss.
   ``He has not slowed down one bit,'' Buffington said of Stennis.
``He has said for years that he was a straight furrow to the end of
the row and as far as the Senate's row is concerned, he's still
plowing.''
   ``He continues to love the Senate and to have great faith in the
future of the Senate and the future off the country.''

<TEXT>
   The Chamber of Deputies is investigating
charges by the oilworkers union that the governor of Mexico state
embezzled $49 million from the government petroleum monopoly Pemex
when he headed it.
   Seven deputies from the governing Institutional Revolutionary
Party, or PRI, made the accusation against Gov. Mario Ramon Beteta
Thursday night.
   As PRI deputy Adolfo Barrientos, head of a local union, spoke,
oilworkers crowded into the chamber's public galleries shouted:
``To the gallows, to jail'' and ``He robbed the nation,'' the
financial daily El Financiero said.
   The speaker of the chamber named a 22-member commission to
investigate the charges. The investigation was approved by deputies
from both the PRI majority and opposition parties.
   Beteta, an economist and former treasury secretary, left Pemex
in January when he his took office as governor of the state of
Mexico.
   He was named head of Pemex by President Miguel de la Madrid as
part of his ``moral renewal'' campaign against corruption. He
replaced Jorge Diaz Serrano, whose conviction for embezzling $58.7
million from Pemex in a 1980 oil tanker deal was a showcase of the
campaign.
   During his five years as Pemex chief, Beteta clashed repeatedly
with the union.
   Barrientos accused Beteta of defrauding Pemex of $49 million
through a 1985 deal for two Yugoslav-built tankers, and said the
union had documents to back up its allegations.
   He said the deal involved a company called Flota Petrolera
Mexicana, which bought a pair of Yugoslav-built tankers with only
$2.5 million in capital, then leased them to Pemex for a profit of
$49 million.
   Barrientos also accused the former commercial director of Pemex,
Donasiano Tamez; a PRI senator from the state of Mexico, Jesus
Alcantara Miranda; and the president of Flota Petrolera Mexicana,
Isidoro Rodriguez, of being involved in the deal.

hours after rescuers scored their greatest success in moving the
animals closer to open water.
   The whale named Bone was last seen late Friday afternoon, said
Geoff Carroll, a North Slope Borough biologist helping lead the
effort to rescue the three California gray whales.
   By midnight, Carroll and others on the ice near this small town
on the Arctic Ocean had given up hope that Bone might rejoin the
others. Bone, Crossbeak and Bonnet have stuck together since
becoming trapped in unseasonably heavy ice more than two weeks ago
during their annual migration southward.

   The 100th Congress, ending a productive
two-year run today with an early morning flurry of legislative
action, sent President Reagan a compromise bill providing new
weapons to fight the war on drugs.
   Congress also approved tax adjustment legislation with a
three-year price tag of $4.1 billion.
   It upped the ante for Wall Street inside traders, passing
legislation to increase fines and prison terms for individual
offenders and to penalize investment firms that permit the
practice. But efforts to impose economic sanctions against Iraq for
poison gas attacks against Kurdish villagers were blocked in the
House.

   Former Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos
amassed $103 million through embezzlement, theft, bribes and
kickbacks, funneled it through secret bank accounts and used it to
buy valuable real estate, says the grand jury that indicted him.
   Marcos, 71, and his 59-year-old wife, Imelda, also defrauded
three U.S. lending institutions of $165 million in order to buy and
finance the properties, according to the racketeering indictment
returned Friday.
   ``This is a plan hatched and begun in the Philippines to move
massive amounts of money illegally into the United States,'' said
U.S. Attorney Rudolph Giuliani. ``Then the Marcoses came to the
United States and continued their illegal activities.''
   Saudi Arabian financier Adnan Khashoggi, a central figure in the
secret sale of arms to Iran by the Reagan administration, also was
indicted.

   To critics, the British government has forsaken
democracy with its decision to end the right of suspects to remain
silent under police interrogation in Northern Ireland. But
supporters, including distinguished judges, hailed the announcement
Thursday by Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's government as a
sensible, long overdue move that will mean fewer terrorists go free.
   Either way, Mrs. Thatcher's government is prepared to dump the
British equivalent of the U.S. Constitution's Fifth Amendment. The
Fifth Amendment holds that no person ``shall be compelled in any
criminal case to be a witness against himself ... without due
process of law.''
   New laws, expected to be passed for Northern Ireland by January
and for England and Wales by 1990, will allow a judge or jury to
deduce, if they wish, that a suspect's refusal to answer police
questions after arrest is an indication of guilt.

   Michael Dukakis kept on the attack Saturday, blaming a George
Bush campaign ``of fear and of smear'' for distorting his image to
voters. Bush, the leader in polls barely two weeks before the
election, met quietly at home with a former Cuban prisoner.
   Democrat Dukakis, touching on criticism of his campaign style,
said, ``I may not wear my heart on my sleeve.'' But he promised to
``fight my heart out for the things I believe in.''
   His remarks came in a five-minute speech his campaign paid to
air on ABC-TV at 10:55 p.m. EDT.
   Republican Bush kept a light schedule Saturday, meeting with
Armando Valladares, author of ``Against All Hope,'' a harrowing
account of his years as a political prisoner in Cuba.

   Polls are illuminating an electorate in turmoil,
with voters still groping _ some of them dispiritedly _ toward a
decision in the presidential election, analysts say.
   While surveys indicate a healthy George Bush lead, striking
differences in gauging the size of the lead underline a certain
unhappiness with the choices, some pollsters said in recent days.
   And that means things still can change with just over two weeks
to go, they said.
   ``People are having lots of second thoughts,'' said Andrew
Kohut, president of the Gallup Organization. Even in polls that
have found stable results for weeks, he said, ``I term it stable
uncertainty.''

Richard Durbin stood a few feet away saying the presidential
candidate was going about things all wrong.
   With the election nearing, Dukakis' campaign message was
``completely overshadowed'' by George Bush's sharply critical

candidate was that the uphill race could still be won, but Dukakis
needed above all to ``come out and be hard-hitting and forceful.''
   Now, Durbin and other Democrats with the same message have
gotten their wish.
   Over the next few days, Dukakis refined his new Populist
campaign rhetoric to its essentials, waved GOP brochures in the

its wrestling over two national controversies _ the Iran-Contra
affair and the nomination of Robert Bork to the Supreme Court.
   Both dramas, played out in ornate committee rooms before
national television audiences, involved the lawmakers in bitter
feuding among themselves and with the White House.
   A host of other issues produced a lengthy list of
accomplishments over a two-year session that brought to a close the

   The racketeering indictment of former
Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos signals the start of a
lengthy legal process that is likely to include several rounds of
plea bargaining with the Justice Department.
   Even if Marcos and the government don't work out a deal that
would spare both sides the expense of a trial, it could easily be a
year or more before Marcos would face a jury.
   Federal prosecutors allege Marcos embezzled more than $100
million from the Philippine government and used the money to buy
three buildings in New York City. The main charge carries a maximum
prison sentence of 20 years.
   As part of what they promise will be a vigorous defense, Marcos'
lawyers will embark on an extensive legal process of pre-trial
discovery that is likely to involve a demand for a massive review
of administration records for any documents suggesting Marcos was
offered assurances he wouldn't be prosecuted if he came to this
country.

   Israelis seem almost evenly split on the issue, and the Nov. 1

<HEAD>Mind-Boggling Buyouts With Borrowed Money Raise Disturbing
Questions</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Chriss in graf 12 is cq</NOTE>

   The multibillion-dollar takeover deals surfacing
almost every day make it clear that practically any company, no
matter how large, can now be bought with borrowed money.
   But this craze of debt-financed buyouts and other types of
restructuring, while often rewarding stockholders with windfall
profits, also raise a number of troubling questions, such as where
is all the money coming from, how will it affect the economy, and
what happens if the money cannot be repaid.
   Many critics believe the stupendous movement of money and
rapidly rising debt loads associated with these transactions
reflect nearsighted values that continue to grip corporate America
and Wall Street _ despite the lessons of speculative excesses
learned from the stock crash a year ago.
   Critics also blame the Reagan era of deregulation, lax
enforcement of antitrust laws and to some extent the stock crash
itself, which cut the price of many publicly held companies and
made them attractive targets.
   All of these elements have lured staggering sums of investor
cash, from pension managers to foreign banks, into the hands of
dealmaking strategists who promise a quick return.
   ``Money, the ability to get money when you need it, in these
huge amounts, is critical to all that's happening,'' said Kathryn
Rudie Harrigan, professor of strategic management at Columbia
Business School in New York.
   More conservative use of this money, she said, ``doesn't look
attractive when you're in a short-term world. We can't wait that
long. We've got to have instant pudding.''
   By some estimates, the amount of money available to finance
leveraged buyouts or LBOs _ in which a buyer borrows to acquire a
company and repays the debt with the company's earnings, cash flow
or assets _ totaled less than $100 million in 1980. Now it totals
at least $250 billion.
   Contrary to popular belief, most of this money does not come
from the fortunes of the rich. Much of it comes, indirectly, from
the pension funds of millions of American workers and retirees.
   Federal Reserve Board statistics show that the assets in these
funds alone totaled nearly $2 trillion last year.
   The money also comes from foreign lenders, notably Japanese
banks, the world's richest. Even some of the most conservative U.S.
banks and Wall Street firms, which once shied away from LBOs as
laden with uncertainty, are now joining in with hundreds of
millions in their own capital.
   ``It's really staggering, the amount of money out there that can
be focused in any area,'' said Chriss Street, managing director of
Seidler Amdec Securities Inc., a Los Angeles investment firm.
   ``I think it's a sign of greed more than anything,'' he said.
``Money always tends to drive in the rear-view mirror, it follows
track records. Right now the track records of people involved in
LBOs are staggering.''
   Dealmaking firms that specialize in LBOs, such as Kohlberg
Kravis Roberts & Co., have enjoyed spectacular success, giving
their own investors and clients returns of 30 percent or more a
year.
   Compare that with 12.5 percent so far this year in the stock
market, roughly 8 percent for a 1-year Treasury bill, 7.5 percent
in a money market mutual fund and less in a standard savings
account.
   Kohlberg completed the biggest LBO on record two years ago, a
$6.1 billion deal that took food conglomerate Beatrice Cos. private.
   But the definition of how big an LBO can get was rewritten this
past week, when the management of tobacco-food giant RJR-Nabisco
said it was considering a $17 billion LBO, which would be the
biggest corporate takeover ever.
   This gargantuan proposal came only three days after Philip
Morris launched an $11.4 billion takeover bid for Kraft Inc. and
only a few weeks after British conglomerate Grand Metropolitan PLC
offered $5.2 billion for Pillsbury Co.
   The common message in these undertakings, many securities
professionals said, was that any company can be a takeover target.
   ``They once said that just because Everest wasn't climbed
doesn't mean it couldn't be,'' Street said. ``My gut feeling is
you've got probably a couple of years before the real megadeals
will come to the fore.''
   Charles M. LaLoggia, editor of Special Situations Report, a
respected market newsletter based in Rochester, N.Y., said ``I'll
bet by the end of the year, something happens that even dwarfs this
RJR deal.''
   By far, the biggest worry about this frenzy of dealmaking is its
effect on the economy. Aside from the upheaval on millions of
affected workers and managers, there is an increasing fear that
LBO-restructured companies have too much debt and could default if
interest rates rise even slightly.
   ``If our current economic picture should change _ if we should
go into a recession _ the consequences for these LBOs are not
good,'' James Van Horne, a Stanford Business School professor,
wrote in a recent edition of the school's magazine. ``They are
financed with 90 percent debt or more, allowing almost no margin of
error or cushion.''
   The concern has been heightened recently because these
debt-financed takeovers are growing at the waning stages of an
economic recovery cycle that is now nearly 6 years old.
   ``When you want to be leveraged the most is when you're
bottoming out and on the way up,'' said LaLoggia, who predicts the
relentless pace of LBOs could lead to another financial crisis like
the crash last year.
   ``I don't see where bankers or businessmen, no matter how
sophisticated they are, are less susceptible to the herd
instinct,'' he said. ``They're going to have to pay the piper. A
year or two down the line, in hindsight, it's going to be
incredible how bad their judgment was.''

<HEAD>Buyout Wave Rocks Corporate Bond Market</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SKIP WOLLENBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The latest outbreak of buyout fever on Wall
Street has unsettled the corporate bond market, and analysts say it
may prompt more corporate borrowers to offer some buyer protection
when selling new bonds.
   In the past week, two of the biggest buyouts in history have
been suggested. Philip Morris Companies Inc. proposed an $11.4
billion takeover of Kraft Inc., and RJR Nabisco Inc. said its
management is considering taking the company private in a $17.6
billion deal.
   That kind of talk is bad news for those holding a buyer's bonds
because chances are the buyer will take on a lot more debt to
accomplish the deal.
   Suddenly the company that looked so solid when it sold the bonds
that individual and institutional investors now hold in their
portfolios doesn't look like such a great credit risk anymore.
   News of the latest potential buyouts sent prices reeling and
yields higher on billions of dollars in debt from Philip Morris and
RJR Nabisco.
   Dealers said the price of long bonds from RJR, for instance,
tumbled about 14 points, or $140 for every $1,000 in face value,
after word of the possible buyout reached the market. As prices of
its bonds fell, their yields rocketed nearly two percentage points
to about 11.9 percent.
   But the announcements had a broader impact, putting downward
pressure on corporate bond prices generally as speculation flared
about which other companies could be next, analysts said.
   That's a big difference between this and earlier buyout waves,
said Ronald Morse, senior vice president in charge of corporate and
government bond trading at Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.
   Morse said recent buyouts of a number of retailing firms mainly
affected only the bond prices of the companies involved.
   ``The opinion going into 1988 was that there are some companies
that are just too big to be put into play and their debt securities
were safe from event risk, the event being a takeover or leveraged
buyout,'' he said.
   But he said the latest buyout wave has ``substantially destroyed
this article of faith.''
   As a result, he said this past week's developments made some
investors wonder about the chances that the companies whose bonds
they hold may become involved in a similar situation, either as
aggressor or target.
   James Ednie, corporate vice president and senior industrial bond
trader at Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., said another reason for the
decline in corporate bond prices is that some big investors such as
pension funds are required to invest only in securities carrying
the higher credit ratings.
   When it appears a company may face a ratings downgrade, he said
these bondholders often scramble to sell those securities and
reinvest in higher-grade issues such as Treasury or utility bonds.
   ``One of the most common realities in leveraged buyouts is that
they tend to turn double-A and single-A credits into new credits of
less than investment grade,'' Ednie said.
   The two major debt ratings agencies, Standard & Poor's Corp. and
Moody's Investors Service, said that they were monitoring Philip
Morris and RJR to see if a reduction in rating is warranted.
   Dean Witter's Morse said one likely impact of merger mania will
be that those who buy bonds will demand greater assurance from the
issuer that they will be able to sell their bonds for a fair price
if the issuer later decides for whatever reason to load up on more
debt.
   Morse said some companies have attached so-called poison-put
options to their bond issues, giving bondholders the right to sell
the bonds back to the issuer at specified terms if the issuer
becomes involved in a buyout.
   Corporate managements generally don't like such provisions
because it limits their ability to make moves without incurring a
sizeable liability to buy back outstanding debt.
   But Morse said since the notion that some deals are too big to
be done has been called into question, companies may find they must
offer some protection to find ready buyers for their debt.

   The takeover-buyout mania now sweeping through
corporate America has some Wall Streeters applauding and others
shaking their heads.
   The fans of these multibillion-dollar deals say they are
powerful medicine for a stock market still struggling to recover
from the crash of 1987.
   In the absence of buying by individuals and many institutional
money managers, they ask, where would the stock market be today
without the leveraged-buyout specialists and the traders, known as
arbitragers, who follow in their wake?
   What's more, they say, takeovers and buyouts are a long-term
plus for the market because they reduce the supply of stock in the
marketplace, giving an upward bias to the prices of the shares that
remain available.
   But more skeptical observers, while acknowledging some of those
points, argue that all this wheeling and dealing is contributing
huge new amounts to an already dangerous accumulation of debt in
the U.S. economy.
   And the activity it generates in the market, they say,
represents unhealthy speculation rather than stable, long-term
investment.
   The mergers and acquisitions binge is nothing new, of course.
Takeovers and buyouts were a dominant force in the 1982-87 bull
market.
   A similar phenomenon occurred in the 1960s, when
conglomerate-building was the financial rage.
   Lately, however, the game has been played on an expanded scale.
In the past week alone, Philip Morris proposed an $11.4 billion
offer for Kraft and RJR Nabsico said it was considering a $17.6
billion management buyout plan.
   If such deals can be done, analysts say, there appears to be
virtually no limit to what might be attempted in the future, no
company too big to be ruled out as a takeover or buyout candidate.
   That prospect helped propel stock prices higher in the past
week. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 50.32 to
2,183.50, hitting its highest levels since the crash of '87 as the
first anniversary of that debacle passed.
   The New York Stock Exchange composite index gained 3.96 to
159.42; the NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market
added 4.00 to 388.59, and the American Stock Exchange market value
index was up 3.52 at 306.07.
   Volume on the Big Board averaged 170.63 million shares a day, up
from 147.05 million the week before.
   ``The short-term rewards to selling shareholders in the form of
capital gains are indisputable,'' analysts at Wright Investors'
Service in Bridgeport, Conn., observed in a recent appraisal of the
mergers-and-acquisitions craze.
   But ``the longer-term effects of takeovers are less healthy for
the economy and for equity investors generally.''
   Excessive debt-leveraging of corporate assets makes companies
more vulnerable in the event of a recession, the report said.
   ``In fact, there is the potential that defaults arising from
high debt service requirements for companies with reduced cash
flows will even aggravate the economy's troubles, when the next
recession comes.
   ``Although industry consolidations and restructurings may often
be useful for strengthening the competitive edge in global markets,
the transformation of billions of dollars of equity into debt is
eroding the financial footings of U.S. industry.
   ``Market volatility and instability have increased as a result
of the takeover wave, with the effect of driving many individual
investors out of the stock market for years to come, if not for
good,'' it said.
   Wright noted that the greatest takeover wave in history was a
basic cause of the stock market decline last October. The collapse
was as severe as it was ``precisely because the takeover wave had
pushed stock prices to artificially high levels,'' the report said.
   ``For that reason alone,'' Wright concluded, ``one should find
little comfort in the continuing high level of takeover activity.''

<HEAD>Control Of Futures Markets Remains Unresolved Issue</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Will be followed later in cycle with an ADD containing weekly
commodity price trends</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>

   One year after Black Monday, the question of which government
agency should oversee the financial futures markets remains
unresolved, a fact highlighted this past week at a gathering of
futures industry leaders and regulators in Chicago.
   A number of other crash-related issues also overhang the
nation's futures and options exchanges, but none arouses a more
emotional response among futures industry leaders than the control
question, especially among officials of the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange and the Chicago Board of Trade, the world's largest
futures exchanges.
   Futures and options trading is regulated by the 14-year-old
Commodities and Futures Trading Commission. Trading of stocks and
bonds is regulated by the Securities and Exchange Commission, set
up in 1934 as part of the New Deal.
   Despite the undeniable link between the stock market and
stock-index futures _ which can be used for either hedging stock
positions or speculating on stock-market movements _ the Chicago
exchanges have strongly opposed post-crash proposals that one
agency should regulate both markets.
   Instead, they have argued for the creation of an agency that
would coordinate sharing of trading information among all the
financial markets.
   SEC Chairman David Ruder asked Congress in January to enlarge
his agency's jurisdiction to give it ``direct regulatory
authority'' over stock-index futures and any new futures contracts
related to stocks.
   In Chicago on Thursday, Ruder took a more lenient stance, saying
post-crash efforts to better coordinate the activities of the SEC,
the CFTC and the markets were working satisfactorily.
   ``Nonetheless,'' Ruder said in a speech to the Economic Club of
Chicago, ``I continue to believe that in the long term there needs
to be an ability to look beyond the parochial concerns of each of
the separate stock and futures markets. In the long run, unified
jurisdiction over these increasingly linked and unified markets
will prove to be desirable.''
   Earlier in the day, while sitting on a discussion panel with
CFTC Chairwoman Wendy Gramm and four futures industry leaders,
Ruder was even more conciliatory on the issue, saying that
``contrary to many press reports, I do not regard that as a very
serious matter.''
   Chicago Merc President William Brodsky, who also sat on the
panel, expressed his position bluntly: ``I don't think you need a
single regulator to create cooperation.''
   Ms. Gramm, a Reagan appointee who has been in office less than
eight months, did not comment on the control issue but focused
instead on the likelihood of increased regulation of futures
trading under a Michael Dukakis administration.
   Dukakis is a Democrat and most of the bills introduced in
Congress in the past year proposing greater regulation of the
futures markets were sponsored by Democrats.
   But Ms. Gramm said she expected Republican Vice President George
Bush to win the November election. The big question, she said, was
whether Bush would be willing to veto any futures-related
legislation backed by a Congress likely to be dominated by
Democrats.
   The issue of regulatory jurisdiction over financial futures
could come to a head next year when Congress must vote on
reauthorizing the CFTC for another four years. By law, the agency
dies next year unless reauthorized by Congress.

<HEAD>Chevron USA Plans 400 Fewer Jobs at Port Arthur Refinery</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JEFF AWALT</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Chevron USA, citing increased
competition and reduced profit, announced plans Friday to cut the
workforce at its largest refinery by about 400 jobs.
   Company officials said a portion of the jobs will be eliminated
through attrition and early retirement.
   The 4,000-acre plant was purchased by the Chevron subsidiary in
1984 from Gulf Oil Corp, and employs more than 2,200 people.
   ``Chevron USA has announced plans to streamline the refinery
operations and the organization here to make the refinery more
competitive _ and not only to make it more competitive, but to
assure its continued operation,'' said company spokesman Art
Spencer.
   The exact number of layoffs will not be known until company
officials meet with union leaders to discuss the changes, he said,
but Chevron plans to operate the plant with about 400 fewer
employees.
   ``Any announcement involving a reduction in manpower is
difficult, but this has come as something of a relief to many of
our Port Arthur business people because it means that Chevron has
decided to keep the plant open,'' Spencer said.
   A company task force had presented four options to improve
refining operation profits, including the possibility of shutting
down the plant, or reducing the workforce by more than half,
Spencer sasid.
   ``This was the best of the (task force) alternatives,'' he said.
``It's a relief that we did not have to go to the big numbers.''
   The changes were prompted, in part, by continuing volatility in
the energy industry, he said.
   ``It relates to the extremely competitive market in which this
refinery functions,'' Spencer said.
   ``This Gulf Coast region is the most competitive petroleum
products market in the United States,'' he said. ``We have not been
competitive in this market for a long time.''
   Smaller Chevron refining operations in Pascagoula, Miss., and El
Paso have proven more profitable, he said.
   The Port Arthur refinery is the largest owned by Chevron, with
an operating capacity off 407,000 barrels of crude per day. After
streamlining, which is expected to begin immediately, ready
capacity will be about 329,000 barrels per day, Spencer said.
   ``We've never run 400,000 barrels a day here,'' he said.
   A renewed marketing strategy calls for the refinery to place a
greater emphasis on the production of petrochemicals, premium
unleaded gasoline and lubricating base oils, Spencer said. The
plant is one of few along the gulf coast with its own packaging
facilities.
   The company plans to complete the cutbacks by the end of the
first quarter 1989, Spencer said.
   The Port Arthur refinery first opened in 1901 and has undergone
numerous renovations, including a $600-million improvement project
in 1980, he said.

<HEAD>Knight-Ridder's Profit Down</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Knight-Ridder Inc. said Friday its third-quarter
profit fell 4.4 percent from a year ago, due mainly to weak retail
advertising and lower ad revenue.
   For the three-month period ended Sept. 30, Knight-Ridder's
after-tax profit totaled $31.99 million, or 57 cents a share, down
from $33.4 million, or 57 cents a share, in the year-ago period.
The latest quarter's net included $2.19 million from discontinued
operations.
   Earlier this month, the company announced plans to sell its
eight television stations.
   The media company's third quarter revenue rose 5.8 percent to
$503.1 million from $475.6 million.
   ``A lower tax rate and the benefits of the repurchase of our own
stock helped our earnings per share results during the quarter,''
said Robert F. Singleton, senior vice president and chief financial
officer.
   ``Revenue growth from newspaper operations was a disappointing
3.2 percent. Retail and general advertising, mirroring nationwide
trends, were both below our expectations,'' Singleton said.
   For the first nine months, Knight-Ridder's profit totaled
$110.79 million, up 5.4 percent from $105.11 million in the same
period in 1987. Revenue totaled $1.51 billion, up 4.8 percent from
$1.44 billion in the year-earlier period.

<HEAD>Stocks, Consumer Prices Up; Oil, Bond Prices Down</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: For Saturday PMs</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   The stock market's best-known indicator edged up to its highest
level of the year while bond prices lost ground and oil futures
prices slipped.
   Consumer prices, meanwhile, posted their smallest gain in three
months with a 0.3 percent advance in September, the government
reported Friday.
   On Wall Street, stock prices finished mostly higher, lifting the
Dow Jones average of 30 industrials by 2.31 points to 2,183.50.
   It was the third 1988 high this week as the blue-chip indicator
scored a net gain for the week of 50.32 points.
   Bond prices moved lower, however. The Treasury's 30-year bond
lost nearly $5 for every $1,000 in face value, pushing its yield
toward 8.9 percent.
   In the oil futures market, prices edged lower as traders awaited
word from two committees of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries that were meeting for a second day to discuss the
cartel's overproduction.
   The increase in the Labor Department's Consumer Price Index
meant consumer prices were rising at a moderate annual rate of 4.1
percent last month, down from an annual rate of 5.2 percent in
August.
   The most recent inflation report triggered an automatic 4.0
percent cost-of-living increase for the nation's 38.4 million
Social Security recipients, the second highest boost in the last 6{
years.
   The increase, which will increase the average retired worker's
pension by $21 a month, will show up in January.
   Economists, who had been worried about a new inflationary spiral
fueled by tight labor markets and drought-driven food increases,
said the price slowdown in September was an encouraging sign.
   ``The September price report should allay a lot of the
inflationary fears that were in financial markets the past few
months,'' said David Bassett, an economist with the WEFA Group, an
economic consulting firm in Bala Cynwyd, Pa.
   For the first nine months of the year, inflation has been rising
at an annual rate of 4.5 percent, little changed from the 4.4
percent increase for all of 1987.
   The 0.3 percent overall rise in consumer prices in September was
down slightly from increases of 0.4 percent in July and August as
gasoline prices fell by 1.7 percent, the biggest decline since
February.
   However, food prices climbed 0.8 percent and clothing costs shot
up 2.2 percent. These two components accounted for 70 percent of
the September price increase.
   In another government report, the Labor Department said
Americans' average weekly earnings, after adjusting for inflation,
rose a seasonally adjusted 0.5 percent in September, after falling
a sharp 1.3 percent in August, the worst drop in four years.
   The September increase stemmed from a rise in the number of
hours worked and in the earnings per hour, which more than offset
the increase in consumer prices.

<TEXT>
   Oil prices declined in skittish trading as two
OPEC committees continued meetings about the cartel's
overproduction.
   The December contract for West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark
grade of U.S. crude, fell 9 cents Friday to close at $14.37 a
42-gallon barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Several other
contract months fell by similar amounts.
   Trading was nervous, although less volatile than in sessions
earlier this week. The November contract for WTI, which expired on
Thursday, dropped 60 cents on Tuesday, soared 79 cents on Wednesday
and then tumbled 80 cents in its final day.
   Oil futures have traveled a rocky road in recent weeks because
of rampant overproduction by members of the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries and hopes that the OPEC committees
meeting in Madrid might make progress toward limiting the cartel's
output.
   Little concrete news came out of the gathering's first two days.
The pricing and long-term strategy committees ended a second day of
talks Friday with no announcement, and scheduled another round for
Saturday.
   OPEC President Rilwanu Lukman said Friday progress toward a new
production agreement rested on ironing out sharp differences
between Iraq and Iran.
   OPEC's current ceiling for 12 of its 13 member nations is 15.06
million barrels a day, although current production is estimated at
close to 21 million barrels a day.
   As trading wore on Friday, ``every time a different report of a
news story came out, (the market) would make a big move,'' said Jim
Fiedler, a trader with E.D.&F. Man International Futures Inc.
   ``The market's headline-driven,'' he said.
   Refined products traded on the Mercantile Exchange were mixed.
The November contract for home heating oil slipped 0.35 cent to
close at 42.71 cents a gallon.
   But prices for wholesale unleaded gasoline surged higher because
of tight supplies, Fiedler said.
   The November contract for gasoline rose 1.87 cents to settle at
51.22 cents a gallon.
   Fiedler called gasoline trading ``a different world by itself.''
