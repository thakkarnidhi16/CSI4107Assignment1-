   Representatives of 2,200 striking
registered nurses reached a tentative agreement with six private
hospitals Friday for pay raises of 21 percent, the California
Nurses Association said.
   The tentative pact was reached after the hospitals' negotiating
board accepted a proposal from the CNA, said Larry Arnold,
spokesman for Affiliated Hospitals, which is handling negotiations
for the medical centers.
   The nurses will return to work by Wednesday if the contract is
approved, Eileen Maloney, a spokeswoman for Mayor Art Agnos said.
They went on strike Aug. 2.
   If approved, the pact would end a citywide labor conflict that
at one point involved 4,000 nurses and hospital employees at eight
medical facilities. The labor dispute involved two unions and three
separate strikes.
   Nurses at the private hospitals last week turned down an offer
of a 20 percent increase over three years by a 2-1 margin. The
nurses were seeking 21 percent over two years.
   Under the tentative pact, nurses would receive an 8 percent pay
raise the first year of the contract, compared with the 7.5 percent
first-year raise in the previous offer, said nurses' spokeswoman
Karen Bardoni.
   ``The 8 percent the first year is very important in bringing
Affiliated up to the standards of other area hospitals,'' Bardoni
said.
   The increase would be over a 34-month period.
   The tentative agreement also carries improved language on
staffing levels and higher weekend differential pay.
   A ratification vote was set for Sunday.
   Union officials are endorsing the proposal and predicted
approval, Bardoni said. They also had recommended approval of the
earlier offer.
   Some 1,700-members of Local 250 of the Hospital and Health Care
Workers Union began returning to work this week after reaching
agreement with seven hospitals on a two-year pact that will restore
fringe benefits and short-term sick leave. Under the pact, some
workers will get raises of up to 6 percent over the life of the
pact and others will get bonuses of up to $300 at the end of two
years. The union had gone on strike July 26.

<TEXT>
   A federal appeals court Friday overturned a
judge's ruling that a Virginia savings and loan pay Penthouse
International Boardwalk Properties Inc. nearly $130 million for
allegedly sabotaging a loan.
   The decision, released Friday, also overturned an order that
Dominion Federal Savings and Loan Association pay $7.65 million in
damages to Queens City Savings and Loan, the lead lender in a $97
million loan package for an Atlantic City casino-hotel project.
   Penthouse President Robert Guccione spent more than $60 million
on the casino project, but sought extra financing in 1983. Dominion
Federal promised to provide $35 million in funding although it was
barred by law from making a single loan of more than $18.5 million.
   U.S. District Judge Kevin Duffy accused Dominion Chairman
William Walde in a July 31, 1987, decision of launching a cover-up
after a third lender pulled out of the deal.
   The appeals court, however, said in its 67-page opinion: ``There
was no evidence establishing that Dominion intended not to proceed
and there is an abundance of evidence to indicate just the
opposite.''
   Dominion Federal announced the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
decision. Reporters could not obtain copies late Friday.
   The McLean, Va.-based lending institution had posted a $50
million bond while awaiting the appeal.

<HEAD>Aquino OKs Measures to Block Marcos' Return</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MANILA, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Corazon Aquino approved
legal measures Friday to block the return of Ferdinand Marcos, who
has asked a court to grant him permission to come home and face an
accuser.
   At a meeting with key legal advisers, she authorized
Solicitor-General Francisco Chavez to file a motion with the
anti-corruption court to reject Marcos' petition to come home when
a former Cabinet minister gives a deposition against him in
November.
   Chavez said that if the lower tribunal upholds Marcos' request,
the government will appeal to the Supreme Court to keep the former
president from coming home from Hawaii, where he fled after a
February 1986 uprising that toppled his administration and
propelled Mrs. Aquino to power.
   In a petition filed Wednesday with the anti-corruption court,
Marcos asked permission to return so he could defend himself when
Baltazar Aquino, the former public works minister, gives a
deposition on alleged kickbacks by Japanese firms during the Marcos
administration.
   The former minister is not related to the president.
   The anti-graft court said last week that Marcos had the right to
be present and cross-examine Aquino if the testimony was to be used
in criminal proceedings.
   The anti-corruption court stopped short of ordering Marcos to
return, however, and Chavez indicated the government will use all
legal means to prevent Marcos from coming to the Philippines.
   In Hawaii, Marcos spokesman Gemmo Trinidad withheld comment on
the government's plans because ``we are confused by all the
reports'' on the proceedings.
   Aquino presidential spokesman Teodoro Benigno said the
government was trying to reconcile ``the demands of the judiciary
and the demands of national security.''
   Mrs. Aquino cited national security as the main reason for
preventing Marcos from coming back from his exile in Hawaii.
   But she has also pledged to abide by the decision of the courts,
even if they order Marcos home.
   Pro-Marcos groups within the armed forces have been responsible
for at least two of the half dozen major coup attempts against the
Aquino government. Key leaders of those coup attempts remain at
large.
   Philippine law bans trials in absentia, and the government has
delayed filing charges against Marcos for fear he would demand the
right to return.
   The government claims Marcos embezzled up to $10 billion during
his administration. Efforts to recover the money have foundered, in
large part because of the reluctance to file criminal charges.

<TEXT>
   Federal agents searched half a dozen
state Capitol offices belonging to lawmakers or their aides as part
of an apparent corruption probe, the FBI and a state senator said
Thursday.
   Sen. Joseph Montoya, the Democratic chairman of the Senate
Business and Professions Committee, and Assemblyman Pat Nolan, the
Republican floor leader of that chamber, confirmed that their
offices were among those searched by the FBI. But both denied
involvement in any improper activities.
   The FBI refused to reveal the names of the lawmakers or even the
subject of the investigation, but a Capitol source, who spoke on
the condition that he not be identified, said all of the parties
named in the search warrants were involved in the passage of a bill
involving investment banking regulations.
   A Senate aide who received one of the search warrants, chief
sergeant at arms Tony Beard, said the warrants specified documents
related to a vetoed bill involving investment banking law.
   At least one office was searched for more than three hours,
sources said.
   ``What I can tell you is that anything I have received in the
way of contributions or honoraria is always done as prescribed by
law,'' said Montoya, who confirmed that federal agents searched his
office.
   Montoya also confirmed that agents were seeking information on
the investment banking law bill.
   ``I guess they wanted to check things out,'' he said, adding
that agents were seeking information about two measures that passed
through his committee.
   ``The FBI executed warrants Wednesday on the offices of six
legislators and legislative assistants,'' said Terry Knowles,
special agent in charge of the Sacramento FBI office. ``The
searches were in connection with an ongoing investigation,'' and
were conducted late Wednesday, he added.
   A Capitol employee said a team of about 30 federal investigators
from the FBI and U.S. attorney's office served search warrants on
the lawmakers' offices.
   ``All I know is some agents came in last night and served some
warrants. There were no arrests, no obvious scene. I can't tell you
who (was served),'' the source said.
   ``My office and the offices of several members from both parties
were searched last night by the FBI. It is not clear to me yet what
the object of the investigation is, but I am confident that when
the investigation is completed, my office will be completely
cleared,'' Nolan said in a written statement.

<TEXT>
   The owner of a Bronx social club where a fire
killed six patrons was arrested Thursday and charged with
manslaughter and assault for maintaining the basement club in a
reckless manner, police said.
   Domingo Reyes, 37, of the Bronx, was arrested at a pay phone in
Manhattan after police traced a 45-minute call he made from a phone
booth to a precinct house, said police spokesman Sgt. Maurice
Howard.
   He was charged with six counts of second-degree manslaughter and
some 40 counts of assault for every person that was in the club
last Sunday at the time of the fire, he said.
   ``The section of the penal law that he's charged with, it covers
death caused in a reckless manner,'' said Howard. ``He maintained
the club in such a way it was reckless and that's where his
responsibility to the deaths comes in,'' he said.
   Howard said police had been searching for Reyes since the fire
at the Bronx club, known as The Hole.
   ``He had an impending sense that they were looking for him,''
Howard said in explaining why Reyes may have called police.
   When Reyes saw the unmarked cars pull up to the phone booth and
detectives getting out, ``he ran and there was a brief foot chase''
before he was captured, said Howard.
   Dozens of club patrons were injured in the fire, many severely
burned. Eighteen firefighters also were hurt, none seriously.
   Officials said the club was operated illegally because it served
liquor without a license and didn't have enough exits to comply
with building codes.
   Although arson was initially suspected, the fire was later ruled
to have been accidental.

<TEXT>
   Bernie Grant was branded a public enemy three
years ago for defending black youths involved in a north London
riot in which a policeman was hacked to death.
   Today, far from being hounded out of public life, 44-year-old
Grant is a member of Parliament and perhaps the most influential
black politician in Britain.
   When Grant, Diane Abbott and Paul Boateng won seats for the
opposition Labor Party in the June 1987 election to become the
first blacks ever to enter the House of Commons, many hailed it as
a breakthrough for Britain's 2.4 million blacks.
   Those who feared that Grant's flamboyant radicalism would prove
disruptive have been confounded. With his greying beard,
gap-toothed smile and melodious Caribbean accent, Grant has emerged
as a charming conversationalist and a dedicated parliamentarian.
   ``I suppose some people must have expected me to act in a
certain way and they were probably surprised,'' he said in an
interview. ``But I haven't adjusted my approach to politics in any
way.''
   That approach holds that the 4-percent black minority ``are at
the bottom of the pile'' and becoming ``a powder keg'' in the inner
cities.
   ``I wouldn't be surprised if there were another disturbance
tomorrow,'' he said. ``It's there and it's going to happen because
the government isn't paying any attention to it.
   ``We've got our backs to the wall, and we're fighting against a
very racist government that discriminates against black people.
   ``The problem I think black people are facing now isn't the
overt racism that to a large extent happened in the 60s ... but
it's the unconscious racism, the racism of the people that make
policy that will affect a large amount of black people adversely.''
   Grant emigrated from his native Guyana, a former British colony
on South America's northeast coast, to Britain in 1963. Here he
became the first black ever to head a municipal council, leading
the north London borough of Haringey for three years.
   He burst into national prominence in 1985 when an impoverished
housing project in the Tottenham area of Haringey erupted in riots
and the policeman was hacked to death _ the first ever to die in
British race-related unrest.
   Grant accused the predominantly white police force of sparking
the violence and, in his most controversial utterance, said the
blacks felt they had given the police ``a bloody good hiding
(thrashing).''
   He insisted he was not seeking to justify the killing but simply
explaining how other blacks felt about it.
   The effect was incendiary.
   The right-wing tabloid press called him ``Barmy Bernie,'' Home
Secretary Douglas Hurd branded him ``a high priest of race
conflict,'' and nearly 1,000 Haringey borough workers staged a
one-day strike demanding his resignation. His white girlfriend,
councilor Sharon Lawrence, received death threats.
   ``I've never denied it,'' he says now, ``I've never regretted
it, I've never withdrawn what I said. My position at the time was
to put forward the views of the young people.
   ``It defused the situation. A lot of the newspapers turned on
me. ... I was quite clear in what I was doing.''
   In the 1987 election, he carried Tottenham, where 37 percent of
the electorate are black or Asian, with a sharply reduced Labor
majority.
   In his maiden speech to Parliament, Grant said that unless young
blacks were offered better prospects, ``they will find other means
of expressing their frustration.''
   He claims police still harass black youths, using unnecessary
force and planting evidence.
   When he first arrived in Parliament, Grant said, he underwent an
initiation ceremony in which seven or eight legislators from the
governing Conservative Party gathered around him in the Smoking
Room and ``sort of baited me'' with racial innuendo.
   ``They were deliberately trying to create an incident, but it
didn't work,'' he said. ``I was quite cool.''
   When a doorman tried to eject him from the public gallery ``even
though he knew who I was,'' Grant threatened to withdraw from the
daily business of Parliament until the Speaker examined his
complaint. The doorman apologized.
   Grant has confronted Parliament with issues ranging from alleged
harassment of blacks in the armed forces to Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher's ``hands-off'' policy toward South Africa.
   But he said he has problems with the Labor Party too.
   He charges that its hierarchical system keeps black politicians
out of the limelight and ignores his expertise in local government
and race relations.
   Nonetheless, Grant said: ``I'm quite happy, despite all the
faults of the place (Parliament), to be there. It's relatively easy
compared to the pressure I was under when I was leader of Haringey
Council. To some extent, the spotlight has been dimmed.''

<TEXT>
   An 800-pound, lovesick boar named
Walter who's been hogging too much of his owner's attention lately
has been put up for sale, but so far there have been few offers for
the pining swine.
   ``A guy wanted to know if I would deliver him to Nova Scotia,''
said owner David Dewees, who is asking about $300 for Walter.
``There really haven't been any serious offers.''
   The trouble with Walter is that he's doubled in size since a
friend gave him to Dewees about 6 months ago and is ``desperately
in need of female companionship,'' according to the classified
advertisement Dewees ran this week in the Cape Cod Times.
   ``He's just rooting up the fences and is constantly looking
around and you can just tell by the noises he's making that he's
desperately looking for females,'' Dewees said.
   Walter eats like, well, a pig, putting away close to five
gallons of garbage a day, Dewees said.
   ``I feed him mostly garbage and of course the green stuff from
the garden that's left over and he loves it all,'' he said.
Neighbors bring their children to watch Walter at the trough.
   ``It's a huge, awful sight to see him eat,'' Dewees said.
   A cabinetmaker and construction worker who used to raise pigs,
Dewees says he won't have enough time this winter to look after
Walter, whose currently living at a nearby farm along with four
sheep and two horses.
   Walter, a blend of Hampshire and Poland China, is about 5 feet
long and has chewed through the planks of his pen with his 4-inch
tusks.
   Dewees said selling his porcine pet for meat isn't likely to
bring home the bacon because mature boar meat generally isn't good
for anything more than catfood.
   However, Walter isn't naturally boorish, even though he has made
mistaken advances to the back of a pickup truck and was turned down
for the local fair because there wasn't a pen strong enough to hold
him, Dewees said.
   ``He's really a very gentle fellow. He never has been aggressive
as far as meanness is concerned. He really needs companionship.''

   James C. Quayle was quoted in a story Wednesday in the Daily

``broads and booze.''
   The Indiana senator's father said Thursday he had intended the
statement as a reflection on himself.

   Maybe in Detroit they let the mayor cook for
himself and feast on his own sausage-and-sauerkraut. Maybe in
Pittsburgh they think that because the mayor is also a Jewish
grandmother she can subsist on her own chicken soup.
   Not in New York, where a food trend is big news and Mayor Edward
I. Koch's appetite _ and battle of the waistline _ are well-known.
   In New York, the mayor gets a chef. And the chef can cause his
own scandal.
   Because of an indiscretion in an administration that has seen
some major corruption, Koch is looking for a new cook to share
Gracie Mansion, the sprawling river-view estate the city provides
him on the ritzy Upper East Side.
   In what could be known as the Cheesecake Caper or Garlicgate,
chef Michael London resigned when investigators determined he had
improperly used city workers and facilities in his private catering
and baking business.
   While authorities decided not to prosecute, Koch ordered the
cook _ known for his salmon with garlic, his chocolate chip cookies
and his cheesecakes _ to quit or drop his outside work.
   London elected to leave the mayor's employ, giving Koch's staff
a task few other U.S. mayors ever have to deal with _ finding a new
live-in chef.
   Few other cities even provide their mayors with a home, never
mind a cook to live in it. That leaves most of them with a
coffeemaker in the office and maybe a takeout menu in a desk drawer.
   ``We do things a little differently here in the West,'' said
Bonnie Bartak, spokeswoman for Mayor Terry Goddard of Phoenix,
Ariz., who is a bachelor like Koch but cooks for himself and lives
in a bungalow he owns.
   ``Even our governor (Rose Mofford) is probably home fixing
herself a bologna sandwich like the rest of us,'' Ms. Bartak said.
   Los Angeles furnishes Mayor Tom Bradley with a place to live,
but on the rare occasion he dines there, Bradley and his wife must
fend for themselves, said Deputy Mayor Mike Gage.
   Nevertheless, he didn't want to help New York find a chef for
Koch.
   ``L.A. has some wonderful chefs, but we're not inclined to
export them. We enjoy them here,'' Gage said.
   Up the coast, San Francisco's Mayor Art Agnos has to provide his
own house _ and is struggling to make the payments _ said spokesman
Scott Shafer. Does he get a chef, at least?
   ``His wife wishes he did,'' said Shafer.
   Doesn't cook for himself, eh?
   ``I've never seen him near a stove.''
   It gets worse in small towns, apparently. Mayor Paul Warwick in
the small coastal Georgia town of Brunswick said he gets the
following:
   ``No chef, no house, no car.''
   He does, however, get a gasoline expense account in addition to
his $125-a-week salary.
   Koch's salary is exactly 20 times higher at $130,000 a year.
   Some mayors seem to manage quite well without a chef, practicing
the culinary arts themselves.
   Detroit Mayor Coleman Young is ``a connoisseur of chili,'' said
spokesman Bob Berg. ``He's also got a sausage and sauerkraut dish
that he puts together.''
   And in Pittsburgh, Mayor Sophie Masloff, a Jewish grandmother,
is known to make a good pot of chicken soup and a great batch of
cookies.
   But in New York, the tradition of hiring someone to cook for the
mayor seems well entrenched.
   Officials at City Hall and the city archives couldn't say which
mayor was the first to have a city-provided chef, but all agreed
that several men who served before Koch assumed office in 1978
enjoyed the perquisite.
   Koch spokesman Lee Jones said the chef's position, which pays
$51,000 a year, saves the city money because of the banquets Koch
holds and the entertaining he does as chief executive of the
nation's largest city.
   Besides, they say the cheesecake is really tasty.

   Rwanda and Burundi are like twins in the
womb of Africa.
   The tiny nations, landlocked in the center of the continent, are
a mirror image of each other, with common histories and languages
and ethnic likenesses.
   Cloaked by clouds that crown hills and mountain peaks and the
smoke from thousands of cooking fires, Rwanda and Burundi are two
of Africa's most beautiful _ and poorest _ countries.
   They also are among the most obscure.
   During the past quarter century, they have shared one of the
world's worst ethnic disputes: the unrest between the majority Hutu
and the Tutsi minority that has claimed hundreds of thousands of
lives.
   The bloodletting that runs through the histories of both
countries, like the meandering Akanyaru River that marks their
common border, began anew Aug. 14.
   Hutu tribesmen in two northern Burundi communes set upon their
Tutsi neighbors, hacking them to death with machetes and burning
them alive in huts, refugees and Burundi officials say.
   The Tutsi-dominated army was sent north as peacemaker, but the
soldiers turned executioners after discovering the carnage
inflicted on their tribesmen.
   How the most recent bloodbath began is unclear. But
historically, it has taken little to set either side off on a
murderous rampage.
   Gravediggers have confirmed at least 5,000 people killed. But
hundreds of Burundians, mostly Hutu, who fled into Rwanda to escape
the army's onslaught, insist that more people were left behind dead
than the 40,000 who crossed the Akanyaru River to refuge in Rwanda.
   ``In the beginning, there were many bodies floating along the
river,'' said Alexander Munyakayanza, one of the officials in
charge of three camps of refugees who have settled on the hillside
overlooking the marshy plain that leads to their former homes.
   The refugees in both camps and six similar camps are mostly
Hutus and they say their former homesteads are now killing grounds.
   The Burundi government denies army-led massacres, but refugees
are arriving in Rwanda with knife slashes, burns and bullet and
shrapnel wounds.
   Tribal problems exist in virtually every African country. But
modern weapons, the centuries-old feud and a pressure on land
unlike anywhere else in Africa, have led to frequent genocidal
orgies in Rwanda and Burundi.
   Belgium ruled Rwanda and Burundi as one territory known as
Rwanda-Urundi under a League of Nations and later United Nations
trusteeship from 1917 until 1962, when both countries were given
their independence. From 1899 until the end of World War I in 1917,
the area was part of German East Africa.
   Major ethnic problems in the region date from the 15th century
when the Tutsi _ tall and elegant Nilotic people _ migrated from
Ethiopia and imposed feudal rule on the short, stocky Bantu people
they found living in communes on the blue-green mountains and
hillsides.
   Today, the Tutsi govern Burundi, while the Hutu control Rwanda.
   The Hutu are the majority in both countries, making up 84
percent of the population, and the Tutsi the minority, at 15
percent.
   Nowadays, competition for space on the rolling landscape is at
the root of much of the ethnic animosity. Most of the people in
both countries are farmers.
   Rwanda is Africa's most densely populated state, with 6.1
million people crammed into an area about the size of Maryland.
Burundi is roughly the same size as its northern neighbor and has 5
million people.
   When independence came to Rwanda, the Hutu assumed political
power through the sheer weight of numbers. Their coming to power
was aided by a 1959 Hutu uprising in which 20,000 to 100,000 of the
then-ruling Tutsi were slaughtered and 200,000 more fled into
Burundi.
   The Tutsi held on to power in Burundi even after independence
and have kept the Hutu subservient with guns and intimidation.
   In 1972, Hutu in Burundi tried to overthrow the government
beginning with a massacre of hundreds of Tutsi. The rebellion was
crushed and the government, in reprisals, killed between 100,000
and 300,000 Hutu, including most of the tribe's intelligentsia,
according to human rights groups.
   ``The Tutsi live in mortal fear knowing they are in the
minority,'' said an American missionary who lived and worked in
Burundi from 1960 to 1970 and spoke on condition of anonymity.
``They fear that some Hutu leader is going to rally the people
around him and they know that will be the Tutsis' death knell.''

   Correspondent Sein Win, 66, has reported for the
AP from Rangoon since 1968. As a reporter and newspaper editor he
was imprisoned in 1960 by Burmese governments and on July 29 was
picked up again and released Thursday after being held for 28 days.
Here is his first person account:

<DATELINE>RANGOON, Burma (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   I was arrested on the night of July 29
with Burma in the grip of authoritarian rule. When I left prison
Thursday, I entered a new country.
   As I emerged from jail I witnessed an incredible thing: For the
first time in a quarter century, people _ thousands and thousands
of them _ were chanting, crying for democracy, and there were no
secret police, no soldiers with bayonets fixed and with fingers on
the triggers to stop the demonstrators.
   I was picked up along with nine others, including dissident Aung
Gyi who had earlier this year sent a series of letters to strongman
Ne Win pointing to political, economic and human rights problems in
the country and urging reform.
   We had been accused of something akin to treason although no
evidence was ever produced against me.
   During imprisonment in a special solitary cell measuring 16 feet
by 14 feet I was never told of the tumultuous events sweeping
Burma: the ouster of President Sein Lwin after 17 days in power,
killings of unarmed demonstrators, mass uprisings demanding the
return of democracy, which had once briefly flickered.
   After the authorities barged into my house at 10 p.m. and hauled
me off, my family sent a telex to the AP bureau in Bangkok. ``Daddy
has been taken away.'' it said. ``He won't be able to answer your
queries.''
   When Ne Win retired and was replaced as head of the ruling party
by Sein Lwin last month, one of the first acts of the new
leadership was to order our arrest. Challenged openly by the Aung
Gyi letters, which were reprinted and sold like hot cakes, the
government had apparently decided to crack down quickly.
   We were taken to Insein Prison, eight miles north of Rangoon,
interrogated separately, and charged under a new law of ``attacking
the state,'' comparable to high treason.
   The cells were furnished with a table, chair, bed, mattress,
blanket and mosquito net. A bath with running water was attached.
   Food was good. There was a cup of milk and an egg in the
morning, another cup of milk in the afternoon. The two main meals
included meat and soup.
   Except for loneliness, the thirst for news from the outside and
uncertainty over my future, life was not so bad. I had more than
enough time for Buddhist meditation.
   I found out later that my house was searched for four hours but
nothing incriminating had been found. My answers to the
interrogators were simple: My frequent visits to Aung Gyi were to
gather news. He also was an old, friend.
   Jail was not new to me. As editor of the English-language ``The
Guardian'' newspaper, I tried to do my part in fostering a free
press in the country and was jailed for nearly a month in 1960
under the Official Secrets and Emergency Provision Acts.
   I was let out on bail and the government withdrew the charges
after a year's trial.
   After Ne Win seized power in a 1962 coup, thousands of real or
imagined opponents were arrested, I was among them, spending three
years under ``protective custody'' without interrogation or trial.
   The lastest incarceration was far shorter than I expected. That
perhaps can be accounted for by the rapidly changing events in the
country. After 26 years of seemingly passive acceptance of
authoritarian rule, hundreds of thousands in Rangoon, Mandalay,
Prome, Pegu, Moulmein and elsewhere announced boldly that they had
had enough.
   I saw them when they opened the prison doors Thursday. I got
caught in crowd of demonstrators, delaying my return home. I could
hardly belive my eyes.
   Returning home, reunited with my wife and children who for the
28 days had received no word of my whereabouts or condition, I did
what I have been doing for most of my adult life. I sat down at the
telex and filed a story.

<DATELINE>BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The wreath by the Queen
Elizabeth Bridge into central Belfast is a reminder of how quickly
the balance can shift in the treacherous ebb and flow of the
Northern Ireland conflict.
   The wreath commemorates Lt. Alan Shields, a naval recruiting
officer who was blown up by a bomb while driving into Belfast
Monday, the 26th British military man to die in an Irish Republican
Army attack this year.
   Beyond the bridge, workers clear the wreckage left by an IRA car
bomb that exploded in the commercial heart of Belfast on Tuesday.
   The army deaths are a sharp increase from 1987, when the IRA
managed to kill only three soldiers, while the bombing is a
sobering reminder to Belfast not to take for granted the peace and
prosperity that has blossomed in its business and entertainment
center over six relatively bomb-free years.
   IRA successes usually go in short, bloody bursts, and no one
knows how long this one will last.
   But it represents at least a temporary change of fortunes for
the IRA in its campaign to rid Northern Ireland of British rule and
unite the province with the Irish Republic.
   Ever since November, when a bomb massacred 12 Protestant
civilians at a war memorial ceremony in Enniskillen, little had
gone right for the IRA.
   Blunder after blunder left a trail of 18 innocent dead,
Protestants as well as the blue-collar Roman Catholics whose
interests the IRA claims to represent.
   Thus the shift to attacks on soldiers, with little risk to
civilians, is a morale booster for IRA supporters, who were feeling
increasingly embarrassed at seeing the IRA repeatedly having to
excuse its mistakes.
   Things got so bad that Gerry Adams, president of the outlawed
IRA's legal political wing, Sinn Fein, had to warn the IRA publicly
to ``get its house in order.''
   The attacks on the army have taken place in mainland Britain and
continental Europe, but the deadliest have been in Northern
Ireland, where six off-duty soldiers were blown up in their van in
June, and eight died in a bus bombed last Saturday.
   The IRA's bolstered spirits were reflected in its boast that it
smuggled Tuesday's bomb in central Belfast through a massive
security net, and that in future, a sophisticated system of
non-defusible explosives would be used to set off more bombs,
combined with remote-control smoke grenades to warn off bystanders.
   ``The IRA are on a `high' at the moment, flush with weapons and
explosives, but it cannot be sustained, because against a resolute
government there is no way they can convert their violence into the
political concessions they demand,'' commented The Belfast
Telegraph, Northern Ireland's most influential newspaper.
   The government, responding to anguished Protestant appeals for
tougher anti-IRA measures, says it has taken decisions which it
says are being kept secret but will ``soon become apparent.''
   Newspapers speculate that these include sending in more troops,
extending legal powers to hold suspects, and tightening cooperation
with the Irish police to close the IRA's refuges south of the
border.
   But as the Telegraph itself noted, most of the ideas have
already been tried, ``and for every argument in favor of radical
change, there is another to say that it might make things worse.''
   Some analysts imagine the fighting reaching a stalemate in which
the British agree to talk about troop withdrawal, the IRA accepts a
truce, and all parties acknowledge the futility of violence and sit
down for peace talks.
   But Paul Arthur, a political scientist at the University of
Ulster, believes Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher is too deeply
committed to fighting terrorism to agree to anything that smacks of
a deal with the IRA.
   Arthur believes the only way the IRA will be defeated is if
enough Catholics are revolted by the bloodshed to expunge the
gunmen from their midst.
   That's why killing soldiers makes the most sense for the IRA.
   Civilian deaths only provoke revulsion, while killing local
policemen and militiamen gets marginal publicity in Britain,
compared with the death of a soldier who has been sent in from
Britain.
   The struggle at present is shaped mainly by propaganda needs.
   The IRA aims to turn the British public off Northern Ireland and
into a mood to bring the boys back home.
   ``The British people need to ask if there is not another way,''
says Sinn Fein's Adams. ``They should actively press for their
government to withdraw.''
   The British government counters with the charge that the weapons
and explosives fueling the summer blitz have come from Libya.
   These supplies, says Tom King, the government's Northern Ireland
Secretary, ``may have given some people the idea that somehow
violence can actually win.''

<HEAD>Bat Colony Chase Owners From House</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW LONDON, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A colony of more than 2,000 bats has
chased a couple from their home of 15 years, and one of them says
``it's too scary'' to move back until they're sure the winged
invaders are gone.
   After dark each day, Lorraine and Steve Disburger watch brown
bats flutter in and out of the yellow wood-frame house. They said
they haven't been able to find anyone to help them solve their
problem, largely because they have trouble getting people to
believe them.
   ``I'll never forget the night we left,'' Mrs. Disburger said
recently. ``I couldn't sleep. I was too scared. You could hear
them. It was one of those hot nights and it was like the house was
breathing.
   ``We had the lights on bright,'' she said. ``The bats were right
in the next room. Then one lit on Steve's leg. That did it. We went
outside and slept the rest of the night in our camper. The next
morning I begged my mother-in-law to take us in.''
   That was July 15, and they haven't been back to their central
New York home since except to do laundry and grab a few possessions.
   Disburger used heavy plastic to seal off the unfinished
second-floor room that seems to be the colony's nursery. But his
wife doesn't want to go near the house if she can help it.
   ``It's too scary,'' she said.
   She said she's been frustrated in trying to get help from pest
control experts, local and state health officials and legislators.
   The Disburgers have tried ultra-sound, mothball crystals and
smoke bombs to get rid of the bats. The only weapon that worked was
a tennis racquet, but smashing a bat creates possible exposure to
rabies and disease carried by the flying mammals.
   On Thursday, Stephen Frantz, a zoologist with the state Health
Department's Wadsworth Center for Laboratories and Research who
specializes in rodent and bat diseases, visited the Disburger home.
   ``Judging from what I've heard, it's certainly a problem,''
Frantz said before the visit. ``The large number of bats reported
is unusual, but not rare. This year, there seems to be more people
with serious problems.''
   The couple said they noticed more and more bats starting to
appear at the house about five years ago. They'd disappear in the
winter but would come back in spring, she said.
   The Disburgers tried their best to plug up their old house.
They'd sit in the camper at night and watch the entrances and exits
used by the bats. Disburger had ladders ready all around the
exterior; he'd run and get some insulation and plug a hole.
   The couple said they expect to spend up to $4,000 to rid their
house of the winged varmints. That includes scattering the colony,
plugging all the holes and putting on a new roof.
   Frantz said he was thinking of sealing up most of the holes in
the house, then installing one-way exits in the remaining ones.
When the bats leave at night to feed, he said, they won't be able
to get return.

<HEAD>Birth Defects Still Major Cause Of Premature Death In U.S.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BYRD</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Birth defects such as lung abnormalities,
cardiovascular problems and chromosome disorders continue to rank
as the nation's fifth leading causes of premature loss of life,
federal health researchers say.
   The national Centers for Disease Control, which tabulates
``years of potential life lost'' nationwide to determine the role
of various conditions in premature mortality, reported Thursday
that in 1986, birth defects robbed their victims of 651,523 years
of life they would have lived before age 65.
   That ranked fifth among all causes of premature life-years lost,
the Atlanta-based agency said. Ranking first was unintentional
injury, resulting in about 2.4 million lost life-years, followed by
cancers, heart disease and suicide and homicide.
   Birth defects have ranked fifth in all previous studies of
premature mortality published as far back as 1984, said researcher
David Erickson.
   ``As infant mortality due to other causes has been reduced (with
advances in prenatal care and medical treatment), congenital
anomalies (birth defects) have become the leading cause of infant
mortality,'' the CDC said in its weekly report.
   In detailed statistics from 1985, the latest year for which such
data are available, the leading category of premature mortality
from birth defects was lung abnormality _ either impartial
development or abnormal growth of the lungs. Those conditions
accounted for more than 9 percent of the life-years lost to birth
defects, the CDC said.
   Ranking behind lung abnormalities as a cause of premature loss
of life were conditions where infants were born with incomplete
brains, or with arrested development of the left side of the heart.
   Further, six of the 15 leading birth defects in the CDC's
premature mortality analysis were defects of the cardiovascular
system. Three chromosome defects, including Down's syndrome, were
also included in the top 15.
   The CDC uses age 65 as a statistical benchmark in its premature
mortality studies; most average American life expectancies are
somewhat higher.

   Here is a brief chronology of recent espionage
cases:
   Aug. 24, 1988 _ West German officials arrested former U.S.
soldier Clyde Lee Conrad and charged him with selling secret
documents to Soviet bloc intelligence. The disclosure cames after
The New York Times reported that Swedish and West German
authorities had arrested eight people involved in a spy ring that
supplied the Soviet Union with secret military documents for at
least 10 years.
   June 13, 1988 _ A Canadian, Stephen Joseph Ratkai, was charged
with gathering secrets about U.S. submarine-monitoring operations
at a naval base in Newfoundland during three periods in 1987 and
1988.
   June 3, 1988 _ A military jury sentenced Army Sgt. Daniel Walter
Richardson to 10 years in prison for passing unclassified documents
to an FBI agent who was posing as a Russian spy.
   June 2, 1988 _ A U.S. district court judge in Baltimore ruled
that former U.S. intelligence analyst Samuel Loring Morison would
be allowed to stay out of prison at least temporarily while he
appeals his October 1985 conviction for giving secret satellite
photographs of a Soviet nuclear aircraft carrier to a British
magazine.
   May 20, 1988 _ The 30-year prison sentence imposed on former
Marine Sgt. Clayton J. Lonetree was reduced by five years, and a
$5,000 fine was lifted. Lonetree was convicted in an August 1987
court martial on 13 counts, including allegations that he turned
over CIA identities and floor plans of the U.S. embassies in Moscow
and Vienna to the Soviet Union.
   Dec. 21, 1987 _ Ronald W. Pelton, a former National Security
Agency employee, lost an appeal of his June 1986 espionage
conviction for selling electronic surveillance secrets to Soviet
agents. He was sentenced to three life terms plus 10 years.
   Dec. 18, 1987 _ Anne Henderson-Pollard, the wife of convicted
spy Jonathan Jay Pollard, lost her bid for a reduction of her
five-year sentence for being an accessory after the fact to
possession of secret government documents and to a charge of
receiving embezzled government property.
   Jonathan Pollard, a former civilian intelligence analyst for the
Navy, is serving a life term for his guilty plea to selling
hundreds of pages of classified military documents to Israel.
   Dec. 17, 1987 _ Mikhail Katkov, a mid-level official at the
Soviet mission to the United Nations, was arrested in New York for
trying to obtain military-usable technology and was ordered
deported.
   Jan. 23, 1986 _ Randy Miles Jeffries, an employee of a
Washington stenographic firm that does U.S. government work,
pleaded guilty to giving classified national security documents to
the Soviets. Jeffries was arrested Dec. 20, 1986.
   Nov. 25, 1985 _ The United States agreed to a spy swap with
Ghana involving Michael A. Soussoudis, first cousin of Ghanaian
leader Flight Lt. Jerry Rawlings, arrested for receiving from his
lover, Sharon Marie Scrange, a low-level CIA clerk in Ghana, the
names of eight people allegedly employed by the CIA there. He
pleaded no contest to espionage charges and was sentenced to 20
years, suspended on the release of the eight accused agents from
Ghanaian jails.
   Nov. 6, 1985 _ Vitaly Yurchenko, a colonel in the Soviet KGB,
returned to Moscow after ``re-defecting.'' On Aug. 1 he had sought
political asylum at the U.S. Embassy in Rome. Yurchenko
subsequently traveled to the United States, where he briefed
American intelligence agents on Soviet operations, fingering former
CIA employee Edward L. Howard and Pelton as Russian spies.
   Oct. 28, 1985 _ John Anthony Walker, retired Navy communications
specialist, pleaded guilty to espionage charges for dropping off
secret documents for his Soviet contact near Washingtion. He is
serving a life sentence. He was arrested May 20.
   Oct. 28, 1985 _ Walker's son, Michael Lance Walker, a Navy
seaman, pleaded guilty to passing secrets to the Soviets through
his father. Now serving a 25-year prison term, the younger Walker
was arrested May 21.
   Aug. 7, 1985 _ Arthur James Walker, John Walker's brother, was
convicted of selling secrets to the Soviets. Walker, 51, said his
younger brother enlisted him to pass confidential documents from
the VSE Corp., a defense contractor for whom he worked as an
engineer. Walker was sentenced to life imprisonment and fined
$250,000.

<TEXT>
   Three fine actresses take all the parts in
``From the Mississippi Delta,'' a strong, evocative evening of
theater by Endesha Ida Mae Holland at off-Broadway's Theater Four.
   The presentation by the Negro Ensemble Company has nine
sections, stronger than vignettes, which weave individual lives
through a Mississippi Delta small-town tapestry from the early
1950s into the 1980s.
   Humor and personal tragedy are well-balanced in the play which
begins with a prologue of reminiscenses. In the first ``chapter,''
``Calm, Balmy Days,'' Latanya Richardson plays a white grandmother
who takes an 11-year-old black girl, played by Brenda Denmark, home
to babysit her granddaughter, played by Gwen Roberts-Frost. The
grandmother then calls the babysitter into the bedroom so her
husband can rape her.
   This is followed by the evening's strongest section, ``Second
Doctor Lady.'' Miss Richardson plays Ain't Baby, a name she
received when she no longer was the baby in her family. Now
middle-aged, she is a wonderful midwife. With the other two
actresses narrating dramatically and playing children peeking
through a back window, Ain't Baby delivers a breech-birth baby.
   ``The Water Meter'' is the funniest section of the evening. A
white meter reader tells a gullible old black woman that if anybody
steps on her ground-level meter her water bill will skyrocket. The
old woman has a pile of bricks and a notoriously bad aim so
children and drunks enjoy the challenge.

<HEAD>Archbishop Quits Democratic Party Over Abortion</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Connecticut's top Roman Catholic cleric
has ended his longtime affiliation with the Democratic Party and
reregistered as a Republican because of the Democrats' stances on
birth control and abortion rights.
   Archbishop John F. Whealon of Hartford announced his decision to
quit the Democratic Party in his weekly column in ``The Catholic
Transcript,'' the archdiocesan weekly newspaper appearing Friday.
   Whealon didn't say in his column that he had registered as a
Republican, but he made the switch last week, according to
officials in the office of the West Hartford registrar of voters.
   Whealon complained the Democratic platform drafted during the
recent national convention ``is in favor of contraception and
abortion, financed by the government.''
   He said the Republican Party platform expressed support for the
family and opposed abortion.
   ``In 1860, the Democratic Party was on the wrong side on the
moral question of slavery. It is on the wrong side of the more
serious moral question of abortion. Therefore, reluctantly, I am
unable in conscience to remain a registered Democrat. Feeling
abandoned, I hope that the Democratic Party regains its moral
principles and soul,'' the archbishop wrote.
   Whealon had been registered as a Democrat in Connecticut since
1969.
   ``I had no idea what his political affiliation was, and I don't
know that anyone else did either,'' Democratic State Chairman John
Droney said Thursday.
   ``We're glad to have him aboard,'' said Pauline Kezer, vice
chairman of the state Republican Party.

   The soldiers call it the
``rush hour.''
   Each day at about 4 p.m., groups of Palestinian youths barricade
streets with burning tires and hurl stones at Israeli soldiers.
Each time, the soldiers give chase through the narrow winding
streets of the city's outdoor market.
   ``It's some sort of a game, but it gets serious from time to
time,'' said Capt. Amnon, a reservist who was identified only by
his first name in keeping with army regulations.
   As he spoke, a column of black smoke rose from a burning tire,
signaling the start of the daily ritual of disturbances in this
West Bank city of 120,000.
   The soldiers in Amnon's company say they are weary and
frustrated with the lethal game that by army count has left 15
Nablus Arabs dead and nearly 150 injured in the past two months.
   ``It's like chasing our tail. If we go up the hill, they go
down. If we go down, they go up,'' said Lt. Moshe.
   As he and the other soldiers spoke to a reporter on a hillside
road, Arab youths sneaked up and pelted stones at the soldiers. The
soldiers dashed down the hill, but the youths had vanished.
   Lt. Moshe, a student in his 20s, and Pvt. Shalom, a farmer in
his 30s, pulled up in a jeep with a makeshift top of spare tires
and wire mesh serving as a protection against cement blocks dropped
from rooftops.
   ``I don't want rocks dropped on my head, and I don't want to
shoot them. But if I don't have a choice...'' said Shalom, his
sentence ending in a shrug.
   Soldiers have orders to refrain from firing unless their lives
are in danger or they are the targets of firebombs.
   For all other threats, they are supposed to use tear gas, rubber
bullets or plastic bullets.
   ``Frankly speaking, almost anything can be life-threatening,''
said Capt. Amnon, fatigue showing in the dark smudges under his
eyes.
   He said soldiers faced three to four dangerous situations every
day and it was often a struggle to maintain restraint. The threats
ranged from ball bearings fired from slingshots to stones hurled at
drivers.
   ``It's difficult to tell soldiers they have to stay cool. After
three weeks of this, everyone gets mad,'' said Amnon, a textile
merchant and veteran of the 1982-85 Lebanon war.
   ``I explain every day to the men that to shoot three or four
Arabs is not going to solve the problem or move us forward one
bit.''
   During a daylong tour with soldiers in Nablus, 37 miles north of
Jerusalem, a reporter heard the crackle of gunfire about 20 times,
although most were apparently warning shots.
   By army count, one Arab was wounded in the leg by live
ammunition, two by experimental plastic bullets and two by rubber
bullets.
   At one point, the radio on Maj. Elkana's jeep crackled and a
soldier manning a lookout post asked permission to shoot. He
proposed using a .22- caliber rifle to shoot at the legs of about
20 protesters erecting barricades on a main thoroughfare.
   ``Absolutely not,'' snapped Elkana. ``You are not to shoot
without my authorization.''
   Elkana, 32, from a kibbutz near Tel Aviv, said soldiers had to
show a presence throughout the city because ``we are the law here.''
   But he said he did not normally send his men into the maze-like
network of narrow alleyways that made up the old city as long as
Palestinians did not try to block main roads.
   ``See that fire?'' he said, pointing to a burning tire about 100
yards from the main road. ``I'm going to let it go. If we try to
put it out, they will throw stones and then we have to run after
them. I prefer to choose the time and place.''
   One hour later, squads of 10 to 20 Palestinians tried to choke
off a main street by simultaneously setting up burning barricades
at both ends.
   Soldiers called in a bulldozer, which charged through one
makeshift barricade, ripping open a water pipe that sprayed the
smoldering debris.
   Other soldiers wearing helmets with face shields entered the
marketplace. Members of the patrol could be seen frequently looking
up at rooftops from where Palestinians have dropped bricks, large
blocks and even refrigerators.
   ``The orders are to keep the situation under control. There is
no way we can just let them do what they want. If we did, it would
be total anarchy, just like Lebanon,'' said Capt. Amnon.

   When Secretary of State George P. Shultz comes
back from vacation after Labor Day, one of the first things he will
have to do is set priorities from an immense list of foreign policy
problems.
   There simply is not enough time left for Shultz and others in
the Reagan administration to take on all the woes of the world
before ringing the curtain down in January.
   But the long list is tempting because so many problems suddenly
seem ripe for solution, and a nudge from the United States could
make a difference.
   In Africa, the United States is front and center, using its
influence to seek solutions to the twin problems of Angola and
Namibia.
   It could be argued that only U.S. mediation could have moved the
Cubans and South Africans to where they are now __ holding talks in
Brazzaville that might pay off in independence for Namibia and the
withdrawal of Cuban troops from Angola.
   The continuing unrest of the Israeli-held West Bank beckons for
U.S. intercession. In Shultz's absence, the State Department gave
the Palestinian Arabs a lift by hinting they may be entitled to a
separate seat in peace talks and by admonishing Israel for ordering
25 more deportations from the troubled territory.
   Shultz is likely to give the Mideast one more college try by
scheduling a fifth visit to the region this year. There is little
evidence, though, that prospects for success have improved.
   Jordan's King Hussein has made official what seemed obvious to
many for so long: He will not assume the responsibility for
negotiating a solution to the Arab-Israeli dispute. Nor, with
national elections looming in November, is Israeli Prime Minister
Yitzhak Shamir by any stretch of the imagination prepared to
guarantee in advance of peace talks that Israel would withdraw from
the West Bank.
   Benny Begin, a rising star in Shamir's Likud party and son of
former Prime Minister Menachem Begin, reminded reporters during a
think-tank session this week on the Middle East that Sept. 30 will
mark the 50th anniversary of Munich.
   The Sudeten in 1938 was a strategic buffer between Germany and
Czechoslovakia. But it was absorbed by Germany, setting the stage
for the Nazis to attack Czechoslovakia, with the argument that the
rights of 3 million Sudeten Germans were being violated.
   Begin drew a parallel to the 1.5 million Palestinian Arabs whose
demands also have attracted important international support. The
fact that an Israeli politician finds Munich relevant to today's
Middle East illustrates the determination of a sizable segment of
the Israeli population not to give up the West Bank.
   That resistance, of course, stands smack in the way of Shultz's
plan for a settlement in which Israel would relinquish at least
part of the territory.
   So, when he is back in his comfortable office on the seventh
floor of the State Department, tanned and rested after a golfing
vacation, Shultz must decide how much energy to expend on the
Middle East and, if he decides on a lot, what other world problems
should be sidetracked.
   Tugging at his sleeve, too, is the U.S.-Soviet relationship, and
whether the improvement that resulted from four summit meetings
between President Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev
summit meetings could carry over into the negotiations to reduce
strategic nuclear weapons.
   There are a number of problems in verifying some of the more
elusive variety of these destructive missiles, bombers and
submarines that may defy solution. And yet many elements of a
possible treaty are already in place. A big push by Shultz, who put
the Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces treaty over the top through
regular meetings with Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze,
might just carry the day.

<HEAD>Pledge an Official Part of School Day In Massachusetts</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DUNCAN MANSFIELD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Teachers throughout Massachusetts continue to lead
children in the Pledge of Allegiance each day, on the voluntary
basis supported by Gov. Michael Dukakis.
   ``Every elementary school child has an opportunity to say the
Pledge of Allegiance to the flag every day,'' Education
Commissioner Harold Raynolds said in an interview Thursday.
   Republican George Bush has attempted to make Dukakis' 1977 veto
of a state law requiring teachers to conduct the pledge into a
campaign issue in their presidential contest.
   Dukakis, in vetoing the bill, cited advisory legal opinions and
U.S. Supreme Court precedents that making the pledge mandatory
would be unconstitutional. He says he supports saying the pledge
itself.
   Raynolds said Massachusetts schools observe that policy of
encouraging the pledge on a voluntary basis.
   ``The law is clear (that) those teachers who do not wish to
conduct it, or those students who do not wish to say it, are not
compelled to do so,'' he said. But he added that such exceptions
are ``very, very, very few, one or two perhaps in a school, in most
cases.''
   Bush has claimed that Dukakis was simply ``looking for a
reason'' to refuse to sign the bill.
   Dukakis responded this week that he recites the Pledge of
Allegiance himself and would urge children to do so.
   His 1977 veto was based largely on an advisory opinion from the
state Supreme Court.
   The court said the bill before Dukakis that year, to amend a
1935 law requiring teachers to lead the pledge once a week,
violated the First Amendment rights of freedom of speech and
religion. It also said the original law was unconstitutional.
   The amendment said: ``Each teacher at the commencement of the
first class of each day in all grades in all public schools shall
lead the class in a group recitation of the `Pledge of Allegiance
to the Flag.'''
   Failure of a teacher over a period of two consecutive weeks ``to
salute the flag and recite said pledge..., or to cause the pupils
under his charge so to do, shall be punished for every such period
by a fine of not more than $5.''
   At Dukakis' request, the state Supreme Court studied the
amendment and by a 5-2 vote issued an advisory opinion saying the
entire law regarding the pledge violated teachers' First Amendment
rights.
   The court cited a 1943 U.S. Supreme Court decision, West
Virginia Board of Education vs. Barnette, which held that requiring
a student, under the threat of expulsion, to recite the pledge and
salute the flag violated the student's First Amendment rights. The
student, a member of the Jehovah's Witnesses, had objected on
religious grounds.
   ``In our view, the rationale of the Barnette opinion applies as
well to teachers as it does to students,'' the state court said.
   ``However commendable the Legislature's interest may be in
imbuing young people with patriotic feelings, that interest can
only be implemented through a precise and narrowly drawn provision
which achieves the basic purpose without compromising First
Amendment rights,'' the justices said.
   Acting on the court's opinion, Dukakis wrote to the Legislature
in 1977, ``My oath of office, as does yours, requires me to uphold
the Constitution of the United States. I cannot sign any bill that
violates the Constitution, as this bill has been declared to do.''
   The Legislature overrode Dukakis' veto, by votes of 201-27 in
the House and 24-7 in the Senate. The bill became law and remains
on the books today.
   But then-state Attorney General Francis X. Bellotti issued an
opinion in 1977 saying that because of the constitutional question,
the law ``may not be enforced.''
   ``So it has never been enforced, couldn't be enforced,'' current
Attorney General James Shannon said Thursday.
   Bush, in political speeches over the past week, has said he
doesn't believe the framers of the Constitution would have
considered it a violation of anyone's constitutional rights to be
required to recite the Pledge of Allegiance. ``I would have signed
that bill'' and let the U.S. Supreme Court resolve the issue, he
says on the campaign trail.
   But Shannon said, ``The question really was, OK, do you for
political purposes make people go through the expense and the
trouble of having to strike down a clearly unconstitutional law, or
do you go with the highest court's decision? He (Dukakis) did the
right thing.''
   Laurence Tribe, a constitutional law professor at Harvard Law
School, said courts in other states have ruled similarly to the
Massachusetts court.
   ``The confusion that I think is created about it ... is that
many assume that if teachers have a right to kind of opt out of
leading the class in the pledge, that therefore the Pledge of
Allegiance will not be somehow an official part of the school
day,'' Tribe said.
   ``But of course that's not what was at stake. It remains an
official part of the school day. It is just a question of whether
teachers, like students, have a right for reasons of religious
conscience to be excused from taking part in it.''

   The controversy over whether Dan Quayle used
family influence to secure a spot with the Vietnam-era National
Guard dogged the Republican presidential ticket for a full week
before finally fading in recent days.
   Quayle said Thursday he had answered questions ``for seven days
now,'' and that the public was ``getting a little bit sick'' of the
issue. He said it was time to focus on the differences between the
two tickets.
   The guard questions arose immediately after the 41-year-old
Indiana senator was named to the Republican ticket by Bush. In his
inaugural news conference, Quayle was asked about his decision in
May 1969 to seek a guard position instead of accepting a draft or
volunteering for military service in Vietnam.
   Later, in the midst of a round of network television interviews,
Quayle was asked whether his prominent family pulled strings to get
him into the guard. He joined just six days before he became
eligible for the draft at the height of the Vietnam War. His
answers were not always consistent, but last Friday his spokesman
acknowledged that phone calls may have been made on Quayle's
behalf, and a former family employee acknowledged he had made one
such call.
   Thus began a controversy that occupied most of the vice
presidential candidate's first week of candidacy.
   Millions of young American men sought alternatives to Vietnam
service in the late 1960s, but Quayle's effort raised eyebrows
because of his pro-war stance then and his outspoken advocacy of a
strong national defense now. Quayle's decision to join the guard in
preference to service in Vietnam didn't sit well with everyone,
even among the higher ranks of the GOP.
   ``I must tell you, in my generation you knew who was in the
Guard and who was in uniform fighting for their country,'' said
Senate GOP Leader Bob Dole in a Sunday television interview. ``So
they're very sensitive about it _ they didn't have anybody they
could call, they couldn't influence anyone, say, `I asked my
parents.' Well, my father wore overalls, who's he going to
influence?''
   Quayle has run into scattered hecklers chanting ``Quayle's a
chicken'' and bearing signs reading ``Sissy Rich Boy,'' ``Dump
Quayle'' and ``War Wimp.''
   National Guard officials have repeatedly denied Quayle received
preferential treatment, insisting places were available in certain
units, including Quayle's.
   ``We have found nothing anywhere in our files that would
indicate any problem,'' said Capt. Cathi Kiger, a spokeswoman for
the National Guard in Indianapolis.
   A retired major general in the National Guard did acknowledge
Tuesday he told subordinates to hold open a space for Quayle after
retired Guard commander _ and Pulliam employee _ called to
recommend Quayle.
   Retired Maj. Gen. Alfred Ahner, who in 1969 was military support
plans officer for the state of Indiana and later headed the state
Guard, said he was contacted by retired Maj. Gen. Wendell
Phillippi, then managing editor of Pulliam's Indianapolis News.
   ``Wendell Phillippi had called and said he had a good man, and
said he thought he'd make a good Guardsman,'' Ahner said. ``That's
when I went over to personnel.
   ``They said they had a couple of spaces. I said hold one of
them, there's a good guy coming over.''
   Kiger on Wednesday cited General Order 25, which authorized
officials to fill the headquarters detachment's 138 allotted places
as of April 1, 1969. Guard records show no more than 134 men were
enlisted during April, May _ the month Quayle joined _ and June.
   ``We're not waving the flag here, but a lot of people are saying
`what's the big deal?''' Kiger said.
   Ahner notwithstanding, Quayle dismissed the issue Monday when he
spoke at a Veterans of Foreign Wars meeting in Chicago, saying he
didn't need his family's help to join the Guard.
   ``My Indiana National Guard unit had openings before I applied,
they had openings when I applied and they had openings after I
applied. So there was absolutely no influence used,'' said the
maternal grandson of Eugene C. Pulliam, who published newspapers in
Arizona and Indiana at the time Quayle enlisted.
   Retired Col. Jerome Rafferty, who was director of personnel in
1969, said the then-22-year-old Quayle was a solid Guard candidate,
but conceded the recommendations of high-ranking officers carried
some weight.
   ``If ... any of the generals called me and said they knew a man
who would make a good Guardsman, I'd prick my ears,'' he said,
``because they only sent the highest quality young man. That's the
way the system worked.''
   But Rafferty maintained that, despite a certain amount of
networking among officers, the service was fundamentally
egalitarian.
   ``We recruited on the basis of the needs of the service _ not
the individual,'' he said.
   The experience of a college dropout sworn in within three days
of Quayle seemed to confirm Rafferty's claims.
   Retired Sgt. Stephen W. Morell was able to complete processing
in three days while there was a 22-day span between Quayle's
initial testing and his enlistment. Morell, now an unemployed truck
driver, said he dropped out of college and walked into a local
recruitment office. He enlisted as a clerk-typist and served
side-by-side with Quayle.

   The White House is warning that if Congress
wants to enact new spending programs for the coming fiscal year,
lawmakers will have to find offsetting savings elsewhere or face
unpopular, automatic budget cuts.
   The Reagan administration's Office of Management and Budget
projected Thursday that the fiscal 1989 federal deficit would come
in just under the $146 billion target set in the Gramm-Rudman
balanced budget law.
   Under that legislation, if the budget office determines that the
red ink will exceed $146 billion, spending on defense and domestic
programs must be slashed automatically by whatever amount is
necessary to shrink the deficit to $136 billion.
   ``In that case, congressional overspending will trigger
across-the-board cuts that slash high priority programs every bit
as much as lower priority programs,'' President Reagan warned from
Los Angeles, where he is vacationing.
   OMB estimated that, including programs enacted through Aug. 15,
the fiscal 1989 deficit would be $144 billion. When figuring in
programs signed into law over the last few days, the amount of red
ink grew to $145.3 billion, just $700 million below the $146
billion budget-cut trigger.
   White House budget chief James C. Miller III noted that when
lawmakers return from their summer recess next month, they plan to
consider a collection of popular bills _ including hunger relief,
anti-drug programs, welfare reform, child care and a minimum-wage
increase _ that would boost the deficit beyond $146 billion.
   Miller told reporters that if those bills were enacted,
lawmakers would have to find compensating savings elsewhere or face
the automatic cuts, which are ``something I don't think anybody in
their right mind'' wants.
   House Budget Committee Chairman William H. Gray III, D-Pa., said
he believed spending would be kept under control.
   ``It's clear that Congress and the president are going to have
to walk a fiscal tightrope in the coming weeks, but I believe we
can maintain our balance and avoid crippling, across-the-board
cuts,'' Gray said in a prepared statement.
   Lawmakers are considered unlikely to set off the Gramm-Rudman
process of spending cuts and risk the wrath of voters angry because
their favorite programs have been slashed.
   On Aug. 19, the Congressional Budget Office estimated the 1989
deficit at $153 billion, an amount that would trigger $17 billion
in cuts. That projection, which serves only as a guideline for
lawmakers, was based on more pessimistic economic assumptions than
those used by the administration.
   Fiscal 1989 begins Oct. 1. OMB's final, binding calculation of
next year's projected deficit is due Oct. 15.
   The OMB estimates the deficit for the current fiscal year at
$152.3 billion.

<HEAD>Early Appointment of White House Science and Technology Adviser
Urged</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BARTON REPPERT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The next administration needs to exert
stronger White House leadership of U.S. science and technology
policy, according to an appeal issued by organizations representing
more than 750,000 scientists and engineers.
   In a letter to presidential candidates George Bush and Michael
Dukakis, the heads of 23 scientific and engineering societies
called for early appointment of a new White House science and
technology adviser who will have direct access to the president.
   They contended in the letter released Thursday that ``the most
urgent problems confronting the United States and the world today _
ranging from the destruction of the ozone layer and the `greenhouse
effect' to the spread of AIDS and the restoration of
competitiveness of U.S. industry _ depend on the effective
utilization of the nation's science and technology resources.''
   ``Leadership in science and technology policy must come from the
White House,'' they said, urging the candidates to devote ``careful
thought'' to the White House science and technology advisory
structure.
   ``We believe that this structure must be strengthened and that
the person selected to be the principal science and technology
adviser should have direct access to the president,'' the letter
said.
   It also urged that the appointment of a new science and
technology adviser be made early, enabling the adviser to have a
voice in filling sub-Cabinet level positions in federal agencies
which deal with science and technology issues.
   Spokesmen for the Bush and Dukakis campaigns said they had no
immediate comment on the letter.
   The letter was released at a news conference during which Val
Fitch, president of the American Physical Society, said the United
States was at a competitive disadvantage in the world economy
because about three-quarters of federal research and development
money goes to military programs.
   Fitch, a Nobel Prize-winning physicist from Princeton
University, called for a return to the ``halcyon days'' of the
Eisenhower and Kennedy administrations, when White House science
advisers had enjoyed more frequent and direct access to the
president.
   Russell C. Drew, president of the Institute of Electrical and
Electronics Engineers, said, ``We see the need for a much stronger,
pro-active role on the part of government in building partnerships
within the (science and engineering) community.''
   ``From the engineering standpoint, we see an extremely important
role for a vigorous science and technology adviser to the
president, in bringing these issues to the president, being a
spokesman in the councils of government, being an advocate when
necessary,'' Drew said.
   Howard K. Schachman, president of the Federation of American
Societies for Experimental Biology, said, ``We believe that
solutions to many of the world's most vexing problems will need to
be sought through the biological and medical sciences in the next
decade.
   ``The president must be given the detailed knowledge that will
allow him to judge the validity and implications of the latest and
best research,'' said Schachman.
   William R. Graham, a former NASA official, has been serving as
White House science adviser since June 1986. Prior to that, the
post was vacant for a six-month period following the resignation of
George A. Keyworth II in December 1985.

<HEAD>1989 Farm Income Prospects Down Slightly</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prospects for a hefty boost in the value of
U.S. agricultural exports this year have continued to improve, but
the Agriculture Department says the outlook is not quite so bright
for 1989.
   This fiscal year's export value is expected to jump 22 percent
to a four-year high of $34 billion, up from $27.9 billion in
1986-87, the department said Thursday.
   Shipments were forecast at 146 million metric tons in the year
that will end Sept. 30, up 13 percent from last year.
   Both the value and quantity estimates were up from the previous
USDA forecasts on May 26 of $33.5 billion and 145.5 million tons.
   Although the report cited no figures for subsequent years, it
said export values may increase in 1988-89 due to higher prices but
the volume of shipments may decline.
   In another report last week, the department's Economic Research
Service said the volume of 1989 wheat exports may drop 12 percent
from this year; corn, 4 percent; and soybeans, 29 percent.
   Thursday's report said the rise in 1988 estimates since May
stemmed from larger-than-expected exports of animal products,
slightly larger subsidized wheat exports, and higher corn prices
due to the drought.
   Noting that 1987-88 exports are now expected to be up $6.1
billion and 16.8 million tons, the report said, ``This largely
reflects reduced competitor supplies; higher prices for grains,
oilseeds and cotton; and increased U.S. export competitiveness''
helped by a lower-valued dollar and the Export Enhancement Program,
or EEP.
   Under EEP, selected countries _ including the Soviet Union and
China _ can get wheat and other designated commodities subsidized
by the U.S. government.
   The new forecast showed the value of grain exports at $12.2
billion, up from $11.8 billion expected in May and 1986-87
shipments worth $9.33 billion.
   Oilseeds, mainly soybeans, were forecast at $7.6 billion, down
slightly from $7.7 billion indicated three months ago. But that was
up from $6.47 billion last year.
   Exports of livestock products this year were raised to $4.7
billion from the May forecast of $4.5 billion. In 1986-87, those
were valued at $3.96 billion.
   Other major categories included: horticultural products, $3.7
billion this year, the same as indicated in May but up from $3.15
billion in 1986-87. Cotton export values were shown at $2.2
billion, the same as the earlier forecast. Last year's cotton
shipments were worth $1.43 billion.

   World cigarette production climbed 2.9 percent
last year to 5.12 trillion cigarettes, or ``pieces,'' says an
Agriculture Department analysis.
   ``China, accounting for 28 percent of the world cigarette
production, continues to be the driving force behind this
increase,'' the report said Thursday. ``China's output in 1987
increased 10 percent to 1.4 trillion pieces, registering
double-digit growth for the fourth consecutive year.''
   Not including China, world output remained nearly unchanged at
1.43 trillion cigarettes, although U.S. production rose 6 percent
to 689.4 billion pieces.
   Other countries posting gains of 3 billion or more cigarettes in
1987 included the Soviet Union, Poland, Spain, Philippines, Mexico,
Hong Kong, Bulgaria and South Korea.
   ``Increased production in the United States, Hong Kong and
Bulgaria went towards expanded exports,'' the report said.
``Production increases in the remaining countries were generally in
response to increased domestic consumption.''
   But some countries showed significant production cuts last year.
Japan led the way as cigarette output declined 10 percent to 266.4
billion pieces, the report said.
   ``This reduction was a result of a dramatic increase in imports
that reduced the market share of domestically produced
cigarettes,'' the report said.
   Other countries showing reduced production in 1987 included
India, Brazil, West Germany, Romania, Italy, France, Syria and
Yugoslavia.

   The National Association of Wheat Growers says
a plan by the Agriculture Department to change price support loan
procedures should be withdrawn.
   Frank Johannsen, president of the association, said Thursday
that wheat growers strongly oppose USDA's Aug. 10 proposal ``to
provide that 1987 and all subsequent crops of wheat, feed grains,
rice and soybeans would be ineligible for an extension of the
original 9-month loan.''
   The support loans are made to farmers who then are required to
repay the loans when due or forfeit the grain to the department's
Commodity Credit Corp. It has been a common practice in periods of
abundance to extend the loans, allowing the grain to be kept off
the market longer and not depress prices.
   Johannsen said in a letter filed with USDA that he recognized
the market situation changed in 1988 because of the drought but
that it does not justify prohibiting loan extensions on future
crops.
   ``Decisions on future loan extensions should be made on a
year-to-year basis and should be based on U.S. stocks, production
and projected domestic and world demand,'' he said.
   The USDA policy affecting loan extensions and the farmer-owned
reserve program, in which grain is stored over extended periods
until rising prices force their release, is facing legal challenges
by a group of farmers in U.S. District Court, St. Paul, Minn.

<TEXT>
   A judge ignored a death threat and
charged Colombia's biggest alleged cocaine trafficker in the
slaying of a newspaper publisher.
   Judge Consuelo Sanchez on Thursday ordered Pablo Escobar
arrested and charged with murder in the Dec. 17 shooting of
Guillermo Cano, owner of the Bogota daily El Espectador.
   The U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration says Escobar heads the
Medellin cartel, blamed for smuggling most of the cocaine that
reaches the United States.
   Miss Sanchez said she received a written death threat when it
was known the investigation was complete July 30 and that Escobar
was to be charged.
   The note, published by newspapers this month, said if Escobar
were charged, Miss Sanchez would be killed and that ``there is no
place on this planet'' where she could hide.
   In four years, drug traffickers have killed two dozen judges, a
justice minister, an attorney general, three journalists and scores
of policemen and soldiers.

<HEAD>Nevada Court Refuses To Drop Rock Group From Lawsuit</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CARSON CITY, Nev. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Nevada Supreme Court has refused to
drop the rock group Judas Priest from a lawsuit filed on behalf of
a youth who killed himself and another who attempted suicide after
listening to the band's music.
   The heavy metal group's attorney contended the British band
isn't subject to Nevada jurisdiction, but the state high court said
Thursday that jurisdiction ``is not unreasonable because the state
has a strong interest in protecting its citizens from personal
injury.''
   ``While it is true that the members of Judas Priest will now be
forced to defend a lawsuit in a country distant from their own, it
is more equitable to place such a burden on them, and not the
plaintiffs, because the band members consciously and deliberately
chose to develop a worldwide market,'' the court said.
   The case is scheduled to go to trial Oct. 10 in Washoe District
Court in Reno. Attorneys are expected to seek millions of dollars
in damages against the group, sued two years ago along with CBS
Records after James Vance, 19, and Ray Belknap, 18, shot themselves
two days before Christmas 1985.
   The suit, filed on behalf of Vance, who survived, and Belknap's
mother, Aunetta Roberson, claims the apparent suicide pact resulted
from the lyrics of the songs on Judas Priest's ``Stained Glass''
album, particularly ``Beyond the Realms of Death'' and ``Hero's
End.''
   The suit also blames the alleged hypnotic effect of the music
and the group's intentional cultivation of a cult following.

   A Phoenician tomb from the sixth
century B.C. has been discovered on this island off the southern
coast of Sardinia, archaeologists say.
   The tomb, untouched by grave-robbers, was located in the past
few days during an excavation in the necropolis of the ancient town
of Sulci.
   The tomb contained the remains of five bodies, 60 vases, one
golden earring, a number of glass necklaces and three stone
scarabs, said archaeologist Paolo Bernardini.
   He said it is believed to be one of the oldest tombs ever found
in Sulci.
   The Phoenicians were an ancient sea-trading people who colonized
areas of North Africa as well as southwestern Italy.

<HEAD>Former Soldier Spent Most Of Career In West Germany</HEAD>
<HEAD>With PM-Spy Ring</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Clyde L. Conrad, the former soldier arrested
in West Germany on suspicion of espionage, grew up as a shy but
well-liked youth in Sebring, Ohio, according to former high school
classmates.
   ``He was shy, but when you would compliment him he would give
you this sly smile that would catch your attention,'' said Joe
Igro, who was on the track team with Conrad at McKinley High
School, the northeast Ohio school where Conrad graduated in 1965.
   Igro said Conrad flew home from Germany for their 1985 class
reunion but ``there was just small talk, about old days in school,
not about what he was doing now.''
   Clinton Robert Waugaman, 41, who went through school with Conrad
and was the track team's manager during their senior year, said
Conrad kept to himself.
   ``As far as I know, he pretty much stayed home,'' Waugaman said.
``I don't even recall him ever dating much. He didn't associate
with that many people.''
   Conrad enlisted in the Army on Aug. 9, 1965, and during his 20
years of active-duty service, worked as an infantryman and then as
an ``administration specialist'' before retiring with an honorable
discharge in September 1985 while serving with the 8th Infantry
Division in West Germany, service records show. He served in the
Vietnam War from March 1966 to March 1967, but spent most of his
career in West Germany.
   Army officials said Thursday they still were trying to determine
what security clearances Conrad held when he retired. The Army said
his last job was listed as ``liaison non-commissioned officer,''
but said it would take at least until today to determine his
specific responsibilities in that position.
   The Army released the bare service record for Conrad, born in
August 1947, at the request of reporters but would not confirm he
was the man arrested in West Germany for allegedly leading an
international spy ring that funneled U.S. and NATO secrets to the
East bloc for 10 years.
   However, West German authorities have identified the man
arrested as a former U.S. soldier named Clyde Lee Conrad.
   The Army said that under the Privacy Act, it could not discuss
the ongoing espionage investigation.
   According to the service records, Conrad served with an
unspecified unit in West Germany from May 1967 to May 1970 and
again from June 1971 to June 1974.
   In November 1974, he was assigned to the 8th Infantry Division's
headquarters company, which is located in Bad Kreuznach. This
appears to be the first assignment that Conrad drew with a
headquarters detachment where sensitive documents would assuredly
be stored.
   Conrad served in that post until August 1979. The next month, he
was transferred to the 3rd Battalion of the 17th Infantry at Fort
Ord, Calif., where he remained until March 1980.
   The Army then sent him to the Defense Language Institute in
Monterey, Calif., where he successfully completed a course in basic
German.
   After finishing school in November 1980, he immediately hooked
back up with the 8th Infantry Division's headquarters company in
Bad Kreuznach, where he remained until his retirement.
   According to the service record, Conrad was a recipient of the
National Defense Service Medal, the Vietnam Service Medal, five
Army Commendation Medals, the Army Achievement Medal, three
Meritorious Service Medals and seven Good Conduct Medals.
   He also qualified as an expert with the M-16 rifle and qualified
for the Combat Infantryman Badge and the Parachute Badge. He won
promotion to the rank of sergeant first class in November 1979.

   South Korea and North Korea failed again
today to clear the way for full-scale talks on sharing the Olympics
and on a non-aggression pact and said they will not meet again
until after the Games.
   The two sides, after more than three hours of discussion, failed
to resolve any outstanding issues. The South proposed they meet
again in October after the Olympics. The North proposed a meeting
Oct. 13, which was accepted by the South.
   The decision not to meet until October appeared to indicate the
two sides had given up on efforts to work out an agreement on the
Olympics, which end Oct. 2.
   But South Korean officials would not rule out a last-minute bid
to try to get the North to participate in the Games in Seoul.
   The five-member delegations of lawmakers from each side smiled
and shook hands as the meeting opened in the South Korean building
at the Panmunjom truce village, 35 miles north of Seoul. The site
straddles the Demilitarized Zone, the neutral DMZ which divides the
two Koreas.
   Chief delegate Park Joon-kyu of South Korea urged the communist
North to agree to hold parliamentary talks in the North's capital
of Pyongyang next Monday to resolve the Olympic question.
   He noted that the Olympic flame was due to arrive in the South
on Saturday and time was running out before the Games begin on
Sept. 17
   ``The attention of the entire world is now focused on the
question of whether the grand festival of national reconciliation .
.. will be held or not,'' he said.
   The chief North Korean delegate, Chon Kum Chol, said talks
should be held as soon as possible, but still insisted that a
non-aggression pact should top the agenda. He said full-scale talks
should also stress the Olympics.
   Chon said the dispute over the North's call for representatives
of social and other groups taking part in the parliamentary talks
could be put aside and settled at the actual talks. But he held
fast that the full parliaments of both sides take part in the
negotiations.
   The talks began Aug. 19, ended in stalemate Monday and resumed
Friday only because their top delegates met Wednesday.
   South Korean officials said Thursday the negotiations would bog
down unless North Korea changes its ``unrealistic'' positions.
   ``It is up to North Korea. We have done enough and nothing more
to give,'' said one source close to the South Korean delegation,
who asked not to be identified.
   The two sides differ widely over an agenda and the size of the
parliamentary talks.
   North Korea is demanding a meeting of the full legislatures of
both sides, involving nearly 1,000 members, plus dozens of
representatives of all walks of life.
   South Korea is seeking a smaller meeting of up to 30 delegates
from each side, saying that a large group cannot effectively tackle
sensitive issues.
   Also in dispute is a North Korean demand that the two
legislatures publish a joint declaration of non-aggression, calling
for the withdrawal of 42,000 U.S. troops based in South Korea.
South Korea considers the U.S. military presence essential to its
defense.
   North Korea called for urgent talks on sharing the Sept. 17-Oct.
2 Olympics, but South Korean officials said it seemed more
concerned about issuing a joint declaration of non-aggression.
   South Korean officials say there is virtually no hope for North
Korea to take part in the Olympics. They say North Korea is trying
to keep the current talks alive as long as possible to distract
world attention from the Olympics.
   North Korea has said it will boycott the Olympics unless it is
made a co-host. The International Olympic Committee has rejected
the North Korean demand, saying that the Olympics are awarded to a
single city and cannot be shared.
   The Korean peninsula was divided into communist North Korea and
capitalist South Korea at the end of World War II in 1945. They
fought the Korean War from 1950 to 1953, which left more than a
million people dead.

   Authorities in five countries and two
continents have cracked a drug smuggling ring based in Milan,
arresting 76 people and seizing 230 pounds of cocaine, officials
said.
   Police said Thursday the cocaine is worth nearly $15 million.
The arrests and drug seizures took place during a four-year probe
that involved police in Italy, Argentina, Chile, Switzerland and
Austria, they said.
   Guglielmo Muntoni, the magistrate heading the investigation,
told a news conference that the drug trafficking ring smuggled
cocaine into Milan on flights through Zurich or Geneva, on a train
from Paris or by car from Spain through France.
   He said the last arrests came Wednesday night in Milan, where
police arrested two Uruguayans and seized 13.2 pounds of cocaine.
   Muntoni said the investigation used telephone taps, surveillance
and the monitoring of bank accounts.

<HEAD>Couple Charged With Conning Victims with Hard-Luck Stories</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LINDA DEUTSCH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A couple whose hard-luck stories of
broken-down cars and helpless pregnancy squeezed up to $200 an hour
from parking-lot Good Samaritans were actually apartment managers
who moonlighted as con artists, authorities said.
   Jeffrey Dwayne Allman, 31, and Tracy Chris Hartland, 24,
described as aspiring actors, were each charged with 22 misdemeanor
counts of petty theft for allegedly duping people in the scheme
that netted them up to $200 an hour, the City Attorney's office
said Thursday.
   Among the alleged victims was Los Angeles Times writer Jack
Smith, whose column recounting his suspicion and eventual surrender
of $20 during an encounter with the seemingly forlorn couple
brought at least 50 letters from readers who said they had been
similarly taken in.
   The couple, who have been dubbed the ``Yuppie Panhandlers'' by
authorities, are scheduled for a Municipal Court arraignment Sept.
1.
   City Attorney Jim Hahn said the couple approached people in
supermarket parking lots and at service stations and told elaborate
hard luck stories, asking for a loan which they promised to pay
back.
   The letters to Smith were turned over to police, and Hahn said
they provided the leads needed to identify the couple.
   ``I'm pretty soft-hearted and I was skeptical throughout because
there were some holes in their story. But then you wonder, `What if
it's true,''' said Smith, who was approached by the couple outside
a Pasadena supermarket in April.
   ``I hate to think I looked gullible. When I thought about it, I
said: `What a dumbbell you are,' '' Smith added.
   He said he has since talked to the woman, who apologized.
   Allman and Hartland, who were arrested Aug. 10 while making
their pitch to a man at a West Hollywood car wash, were not at all
down on their luck, Hahn said.
   They were being paid for managing a West Hollywood apartment
building and also received a free $776-a-month apartment as part of
the deal, Hahn said.
   He added that Allman admitted making about $200 an hour on the
con game which had been running for three years.
   Both Allman and Hartland have arrest records on drug related
charges, and Hartland has a shoplifting case pending, Hahn said.
   Explaining how the scheme worked, Hahn said the woman often
would sit in a car cuddling a dog or cat while Allman approached
the victims.
   ``Allman would spin elaborate tales of woe and misfortune about
how their car had broken down and they had spent all their money to
get it repaired, or about how the car had been burglarized and all
their cash stolen,'' he said.
   ``One victim remembered how Allman dropped imploringly to one
knee during his pitch to her,'' Hahn said, noting they would get
the name and address of each victim and promise to return the money.
   Often, the woman appeared to be pregnant, he said, and when the
couple left with between $10 and $100 they would wave at their
victims and say, ``God bless you.''
   ``That woman has been two months pregnant for two years,'' Smith
quipped.
   Those who helped the couple often went out of their way to do
so, Hahn said.
   A minister drove with the couple for 20 minutes in search of a
store which would cash a check so he could give them $53 in food
and cash. An elderly man took the couple home with him, fed them
and gave them $100 to help them get home to Lodi, where they said
they lived, Hahn said.
   Neither Allman or Hartland is listed in area telephone
directories, and they could not be reached for comment.
   The maximum sentence for each charge is six months in jail and a
$1,000 fine. Hahn said he also will seek restitution for all
victims.

   A white Mercedes owned by George Harrison and used

sale Thursday, said Victoria Wolcough of Christie's.
   Other auction highlights included handwritten lyrics to
``Whatever Gets You Through the Night,'' John Lennon's first hit
after leaving the Beatles, which went for $10,224; a pair of
Michael Jackson's dancing shoes, which fetched $5,577; and the
first major collection of clothing owned by the late punk rocker
Sid Vicious to be sold, which went for more than $16,900.
   ``It was an enthusiastic crowd, a very busy auction,'' said Ms.
Wolcough, adding that buying was dominated by Warren Stone of the
Hard Rock Cafe in Los Angeles and by Brian Murphy of the London
Hard Rock Cafe.

   Robert Mondavi, the dean of California
vintners, celebrated the 1988 harvest with the annual blessing of
grapes and the start of the crush in Napa Valley.
   Beaming under a cloudless, sunny sky Thursday, the energetic,
75-year-old Mondavi told tourists and guests crowding the crushing
area at his winery, ``This is our 23rd vintage ... thank you for
coming.''
   The crowd applauded after the Rev. Andre Tournier of St. Joan of
Arc Church in Yountville, wearing a 200-year-old robe, blessed the
grapes with new juice and holy water.
   After the blessing, Mondavi made a small speech, then wine was
served from tables lining the rear of the crush area.
   In 1966, Mondavi built Napa Valley's first new winery since
Prohibition. He began a quality-building program that, less than 10
years later, helped California wine compete successfully with
world-class European wines for the first time.

   Lawyers for the Beatles' licensing company
have filed suit over what they charge are pirated compact disc
recordings of songs and interviews by the former rock group.
   ``It not only rips off the Beatles, it rips off the public,''
said attorney Paul LiCalsi, representing London-based Apple Corps
Ltd.
   The eight pirated CDs include a 1961 audition tape the Beatles
made for Decca records and a 1962 live performance in Hamburg, he
said Thursday.
   The suit names Jay Chernow of Sayreville and two companies, San
Juan Record and Tape Club Ltd. and Music Rent, both of Parlin,
among other defendants.
   Reached for comment, Chernow said he was the president of the
companies, which only do licensing. He said the music and
interviews were legally licensed and denied the allegations in the
suit.

   Austrian maestro Herbert von Karajan,
the No. 1 attraction of the Salzburg festival for 30 years,
announced his resignation from the five-member festival directorate.
   Von Karajan, 80, who suffered a circulatory collapse last week
and had to cancel three conducting appearances, was the festival's
sole artistic director in 1956-60 and has been on the directorate
since 1964.
   Von Karajan's terse letter Thursday to festival president Albert
Moser gave no reasons for the surprise decision, prompting
speculation the maestro may have quit in a huff rather than because
he is ill. A copy of the letter was published by the Austria Press
Agency.
   For years, the festival has been the target of media criticism
for being elitist, too expensive and too conservative. The quality
of some of the performances also has been disputed.
   In a statement, the directorate noted the world-famous
conductor's decision ``with the greatest regret.''
   The statement said it was ``understandable'' that von Karajan
might want to lessen his administrative duties to concentrate on
artistic work and added the festival ``will do all in its power''
to secure him as a conductor for concerts and operas in future.
   Von Karajan has conducted at the famed summer music festival
since 1948.

   A defamation lawsuit filed by a
musician against rock star Billy Joel has been dismissed by the
Nevada Supreme Court because the musician's lawyer failed to file a
timely notice of appeal.
   Carson City musician John Powers sued after Joel called him ``a
creep'' and ``a poor little schlump'' and said he would like ``to
break his legs with my own hands'' in a 1982 Playboy magazine
interview.
   The Supreme Court's dismissal of the case Wednesday ended a
10-year legal battle that began when Powers sued Joel, claiming
Joel's 1978 hit ``My Life'' was originally recorded by Powers.
   Joel settled that suit in 1980 for $42,500, later saying his
attorneys and business manager told him to settle it as a nuisance
suit because it would cost him more to fight it.
   Part of the settlement was that Powers stop claiming the Joel
hit was a song Powers recorded in 1974. But Powers allegedly
continued to claim Joel's song was stolen, prompting Joel's
comments in the magazine interview.
   The state Supreme Court appeal was filed after a Reno judge
ruled in April that Joel didn't commit slander or defamation
although his remarks appeared to vilify Powers.

   The Treasury Department announced Thursday that it sold $9
billion of the bills at an average discount rate of 7.72 percent,
up from 7.40 percent at the last auction on July 28.
   The rates were the highest since the one-year bills sold for

<HEAD>U.S. to Review Duty-Free Rights of Israel, Five Other Nations</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. government is reviewing the duty-free
export privileges of six countries that have been accused of
abusing workers' rights, said U.S. Trade Representative Clayton
Yeutter.
   The six countries, including Israel, have been targeted in an
annual review under the Generalized System of Preference or GSP
program that allows ``developing'' nations to export products to
the United State free of charge, Yeutter announced Thursday.
   GSP beneficiary countries must comply with international trade
union laws, and Yeutter's decision to review the six countries was
based on petitions from labor unions, human rights and lobbying
groups.
   Last June the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee
complained that Israel was denying trade union protection to more
than 100,000 Palestinians who travel daily from the occupied West
Bank and Gaza Strip to work in Israel.
   The other countries to be reviewed are Syria, Burma, Haiti,
Liberia and Malaysia.
   The AFL-CIO filed the petitions against Syria, Burma and
Malaysia, the United Electrical Workers complained about Haiti and
an international lawyers group submitted the petition against
Liberia.
   ``My decision to accept or reject these petitions was made after
careful and deliberate consideration,'' Yeutter said in a
statement. He added that ``the acceptance of these petitions does
not prejudge our final determination.''
   Yeutter rejected petitions to review the GSP rights of El
Salvador, Guatemala, Indonesia, the Philippines, Thailand and
Turkey.
   If the countries lose their duty-free privileges Israel, which
in 1987 exported $487 million worth of goods under the GSP program,
would lose the most.
   A free-trade agreement between Israel and the United States
already exempts some Israeli exports from duty, but that 1986 pact
is being phased in over a 10-year period and still does not cover
hundreds of items.
   Malaysia also stands to lose, having exported $347 million in
goods under terms of the GSP, while the others exported far smaller
amounts.
   Currently, the United States grants duty-free treatment to about
3,000 products from 136 countries. According to government figures,
since the program's inception in 1976, the value of GSP duty-free
imports has grown to $16.3 billion.
   Three days of public hearings will be held starting Oct. 3 in
Washington on the case, and investigations will be conducted in the
targeted countries. The trade representative's final determination
will be announced on April 1, 1989.

<HEAD>Bentsen Says He Got Message Across, Despite Boos From VFW</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Democratic vice presidential candidate
Lloyd Bentsen says the booing he heard from the Veterans of Foreign
Wars doesn't mean he failed to get across his message that
Democrats are strong on defense issues.
   ``I tried in a dispassionate way to set the record straight. And
they'll remember that,'' said Bentsen.
   In his speech Thursday in Chicago before the VFW, the Texas
senator called Republican attempts at painting the Democrats as
weak and unpatriotic ``scurrilous.''
   Bentsen planned to reinforce his defense message today with a
visit to Atlanta and appearances with Georgia Sen. Sam Nunn, the
Democratic chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee.
   Bentsen, a decorated World War II bomber pilot, was greeted with
a standing ovation from the VFW. But he was interrupted four times
by boos and jeers from the crowd _ three times when he talked about
Democratic presidential nominee Michael Dukakis and once when he
mentioned former President Jimmy Carter.
   ``It got my adrenalin up,'' Bentsen told reporters later. ``I've
done enough campaigning that I know you're going to have some of
those along the way,'' he said of the unfriendly reception by some
in the audience.
   He said he was not surprised by the negative reaction to his
mention of Dukakis, saying, ``In part, you saw orchestrated
response by some who were quite partisan.''
   But the loud boos that greeted Bentsen's assertion that Carter
started the recent defense buildup ``surprised me,'' he said.
   ``Jimmy Carter toward the end of his term began to appreciate
... that our defense forces had deteriorated. He turned that
around,'' Bentsen said. ``That's not generally remembered and they
really didn't want to remember that.''
   Bentsen, wearing his VFW cap, asked the veterans to consider
Dukakis, also a veteran, as someone they could rely on to keep the
nation protected. He recited a list of defense programs supported
by the Massachusetts governor, including the cruise missile, the
stealth bomber and a new conventional weapons initiative.
   ``The simple truth is this: Governor Dukakis is a veteran, a
patriot, and an advocate of American strength and steadiness,''
Bentsen told the VFW. ``He can be trusted as a defender of American
security and as a champion of American values.''
   The VFW supported Ronald Reagan's presidential campaigns in 1980
and 1984 and warmly greeted Vice President George Bush and his
running mate, Sen. Dan Quayle of Indiana, on Monday.
   Bentsen was finishing up his campaign swing this week in the
deep South, after spending most of the first three days in the
Midwest.
   Besides visiting Mississippi and Georgia, he was scheduled to
address a state Democratic meeting in Hot Springs, Ark. today.
   Bentsen originally had been scheduled to return to Washington
tonight, but instead, he was heading back to his home state of
Texas. Bush was campaigning in the state, and Bentsen said he
wanted to respond to that.

<HEAD>Dukakis Back At Home After Two Days Of Sharp Attacks On
Reagan-Bush</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN KING</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Michael Dukakis was catching up on state business
today, back home after two days of wooing support in key industrial
states with his harshest attacks to date on President Reagan and
Vice President George Bush.
   The Massachusetts governor planned to spend most of today in his
office, emerging only to swear in a new member of the state
authority which oversees Logan International Airport.
   The Democratic presidential nominee arrived home Thursday night
and attended a fund-raising event after campaigning in Ohio and
Pennsylvania. He also returned with the endorsement of the AFL-CIO,
which he accepted Wednesday in Washington before heading out to
campaign in Michigan.
   Dukakis already had been to Michigan, Ohio and Pennsylvania
since accepting the nomination, and his return visits accentuated
his campaign's determination to secure a Democratic base in
industrial states.
   He toured a steel mill outside Pittsburgh on Thursday before
addressing an evening rally, telling both reporters and the rally
that economic growth during the Reagan years has left the average
American family behind.
   ``Opportunity for some isn't the goal we set for ourselves in
this America,'' Dukakis said. ``And maintaining the status quo _
running in place, standing still, isn't the future we want for our
country.''
   Dukakis chided Bush, the GOP presidential nominee, for not
telling the Republican National Convention last week how he would
erase the deficit.
   In Boston on Thursday night, about 150 gay rights activists
demonstrated outside Dukakis' fund-raising event to criticize a
state policy they say virtually bans placement of foster children
in gay and lesbian homes.
   There were no arrests, and by the time Dukakis and his wife,
Kitty, arrived, only a handful remained, chanting, ``Hey, hey, ho,
ho, homophobia's got to go.''
   ``We want Dukakis supporters to know that he's anti-gay,'' said
Mike Friedman, a spokesman for Mass Act Out, a gay rights group
that sponsored the protest with the Gay and Lesbian Defense
Committee.
   A Dukakis campaign official at the scene refused comment.
   In Cleveland, Dukakis delivered his sharpest attack to date on
Reagan-Bush drug policies, accusing the president and vice
president of failing miserably in the war on drugs.
   ``Today, after seven years of tough talk, the American people
want some answers,'' Dukakis told an audience. ``Why, after seven
years of task forces and policy boards and grandiose claims, have
cocaine imports tripled, drug-related deaths doubled, and heroin
imports risen by 50 percent?''
   Dukakis chided Bush for supporting spending billions of dollars
on the Star Wars space-defense plan at a time when the
administration has cut federal aid to state and local drug programs
by two-thirds.
   ``The drug cancer is eating away at the foundation of fragile
democracies throughout this hemisphere,'' Dukakis said. ``It's
corrupting governments, destroying economies, ravaging communities,
spawning terror and crippling lives.''
   He also blamed Reagan and Bush for a litany of drug-related
problems in the nation.
   ``Now the vice president says that if elected, he'll put his
vice president in charge of the war against drugs,'' Dukakis said.
``President Reagan tried that. It didn't work.''
   Dukakis stepped up his criticism of Reagan and Bush for dealing
with Panamanian military leader Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega, saying
for the first time that he considered the administration's conduct
criminal.
   ``For years, while General Noriega of Panama was actively
involved in the drug business, we were actively in business with
General Noriega,'' Dukakis said. ``My friends, that's criminal.''
   If elected, Dukakis promised to sign an executive order
prohibiting the CIA and other federal agencies from making payments
to suspected drug traffickers except during undercover
investigations.
   After spending today at the Statehouse, Dukakis was heading to
Washington on Saturday to be with Jesse Jackson, Coretta Scott King
and other civil rights leaders to commemorate the 25th anniversary
of the March on Washington led by the late Martin Luther King Jr.
   He was to spend the weekend relaxing in western Massachusetts
prior to a gubernatorial trip to the region Monday and Tuesday.

   They twisted, coffee-grinded and
jitterbugged their way into the nation's living rooms on the
original ``American Bandstand'' in the 1950s. Now, older and a
little less svelte, they're back in the city where it all began to
recapture their glory days.
   On Thursday, for the first time in a quarter century, 27 of the
original Bandstand dancers, including Joe, Kenny, Arlene, Carole,
Flossie and Jim, reunited to rehearse their steps for a rock 'n'
roll celebration over Labor Day weekend in Philadelphia.
   ``Any place there's dancing, I'll still go,'' said Joe Fusco,
who was 15 when he joined the show.
   Fusco, now 46, of south Philadelphia and Lis Braun of the Hot
Foot Agency, a talent agency for dancers, cooked up the idea of
bringing the gang together to dance, gossip and reminisce at the
rock 'n' roll event, called Rock `A' Rama.
   Fusco developed the two-hour show with Braun, contacted the
dancers and helped with the choreography.
   ``American Bandstand'' started life as a Philadelphia TV show in
1952, with Bob Horn as master of ceremonies. Dick Clark took over
as host in 1956, and the show made its network debut on ABC-TV on
Aug. 5, 1957.
   Clark moved the show to California in 1964, but many fans
remember it as a Philadelphia phenomenon.
   The Bandstanders invented steps that are still given a whirl:
the bunny hop, the chalypso and the stroll.
   ``You were like a big star. Girls chased ya; the guys hated
ya,'' said Fusco.
   So in a dance studio Thursday night, remembering the glory days,
they practiced their jitterbugs and coffee-grinding and listened to
Bobby Darin, Frankie Avalon and Neil Sedaka.
   The dancers have aged, some have gained weight or grown
mustaches, but they continue to follow what's hip in fashion and
dance steps. Several wore miniskirts, others donned sneakers and
pedal pushers.
   During breaks, they grabbed cameras and cigarettes and tried to
catch up with each others' lives before Joe called them back for
another try at ``Rock Around the Clock'' or ``Oh, Carole.''
   The reunion gossip even included a love story.
   Philadelphia's Carole Scaldeferri, a regular on the show from
1957 to 1961, met Richard Spada in 1957, when he was a fan who
traveled to Philadelphia to see the show in person.
   In 1977, Carole appeared on a Dick Clark television special,
where Richard spotted her. With the help of Clark and his wife,
Richard contacted Carole and the two were married six months later.
   ``Now I only dance at weddings,'' said Carole, 42.
   Bobby Baritz, a little out of breath from a fast jitterbug, said
he now runs a food and gift shop in New York City. He said fans
often spot the ``American Bandstand'' display in his store and gawk
at photographs of their favorite Bandstanders.
   Recalling the days when a secretary handled her fan mail, Arlene
Sullivan of Washington Township, N.J., said, ``They still remember,
they still remember.''
   And they do.
   David Frees of Ephrata is president and founder of the American
Bandstand Fan Club, which has more than 800 members in the United
States, Europe and Japan.
   ``You better believe I'll be there,'' Frees said of the Rock `A'
Rama appearance. There are no plans to televise the event.
   And it was Frees, not any of the original Bandstanders
interviewed Thursday, who remembered the words to the show's theme
song, written by Barry Manilow.
   ``I'll jump and, hey, I may even show 'em my handstand, because
I'm on the American Bandstand.''

<TEXT>
   A retired couple returned from a two-month
vacation to find their fashionable Manhattan apartment had been
looted of more than $750,000 in art and jewels, including works by
Renoir and Chagall.
   ``As soon as I opened the door, there was an emptiness,'' Red
Heller, 88, said Thursday.
   She and her husband, Ernest, a retired jewelry importer and
manufacturer, had been away since June and discovered the burglary
upon returning Wednesday night to their home, said a police
spokesman, Sgt. Ed Burns.
   Among the things missing were sculptures, paintings, carpets and
silverware, Burns said.
   ``How in the world could they have walked out with all this?''
Mrs. Heller said.
   It was not known how the burglar got into the 16th-floor
apartment, Burns said, noting that there was no sign of forced
entry. Police had no suspects.
   Heller said Thursday that the burglars took the most valuable
works, leaving behind those by lesser-known artists.
   ``I think they must have been here for days,'' he said. ``They
went over everything very carefully.''
   The missing items had been insured for their 1983 value of
between $500,000 and $750,000, but were worth more than that now,
Heller said.

<HEAD>Nude Models Need More Social Support, Daily Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nude models are unfair victims of popular
disapproval, a Chinese newspaper said today in an appeal for an
improvement in models' social status.
   The Guangming Daily said a survey of nude female models in the
eastern city of Nanking revealed they are subject to social scorn
and often have difficulty finding boyfriends or husbands.
   Some complained that even at the art institutes where they work,
teachers and students regard them as sexually ``liberated, modern
women.''
   The newspaper, China's leading daily for intellectuals, said one
model was arrested and fined $27 after getting into a fight after
she was insulted.
   The report did not mention male models.
   The women seldom earn more than $55 a month. That's about double
what a factory worker makes, but the models have no medical
benefits and often can't afford a doctor when they catch colds, the
report said.
   Few buildings in Nanking are heated, despite temperatures below
freezing in the winter.
   In February, another Chinese daily reported a 19-year-old girl
suffered a nervous breakdown because of the abuse she received for
posing nude at the Nanking Academy of Fine Arts.
   The Guangming Daily said artistic studies of the human body go
back thousands of years, but it said China is less receptive to
nudity in art because of its feudal history and long periods of
isolation.
   ``All society should give them more understanding and more
respect,'' it said.
   The nude has played a relatively minor role in Chinese art
history, and the prim Communist government that came to power in
1949 effectively banned all nude paintings.
   But nude modeling for art schools was revived around 1984, and
the government has since given cautious approval to art shows
featuring nude paintings. Shanghai last month opened an exhibition
of paintings and sculptures devoted to studies of the human body.

   George Bush's presidential campaign agreed to
drop a charter air carrier after media representatives refused to
fly on it due to safety concerns.
   Campaign officials arranged to meet today with Key Air officials
to negotiate termination of the $1.8 million contract, said
campaign spokeswoman Alixe Glen.
   She said the campaign would enter discussions with other
potential carriers and use a United Airlines charter in the
meantime.
   The decision came after a series of mishaps in the past week
involving the Key charter that carries the traveling press corps.
   ``The press corps wants to terminate the contract,'' said Glen,
noting that news organizations are charged to cover the cost of the
charter.
   ``The charter belongs to the press corps and we are trying to
meet their needs. They have a job to do and we aim to meet their
needs,'' she said.
   Terms of the settlement remained to be worked out, she said, but
added that Key oficials ``did not want to be an obstacle in any
way.''
   After some in the press refused to fly a Key plane earlier in
the week, the campaign already had switched to United for a
Thursday trip to San Antonio. But that Boeing 737-300 aircraft was
grounded for the day by an engine that overheated on takeoff from
Houston.
   Bush and a small pool of reporters aboard Air Force Two went on
to his event in San Antonio while the rest of the press corps was
left behind.
   The earlier incidents occurred Saturday when fumes and smoke
entered the cabin as the Key Boeing 727 was landing in Columbus,
Ohio, and Monday, when the same plane's wing flaps did not retract
as it was taking off from Chicago. The plane dumped fuel into Lake
Michigan and returned to Chicago.
   Key's president, Coleman Andrews, came to Houston on Thursday to
meet with members of the traveling press and campaign staff, but
his assurances did not change the minds of those worried about the
aircraft's safety.
   Bush has about 60 to 70 reporters, photographers, camera crews
and producers traveling with him as he campaigns for the presidency.

   Communities should be prepared ahead of time in
case they are struck by multiple suicides, since there is
``extremely compelling'' evidence that one can lead to another, the
Centers for Disease Control says.
   ``The middle of a crisis is no time to work out who's supposed
to be doing what,'' said Dr. Patrick O'Carroll, a CDC specialist in
suicide research.
   Being prepared is one of 10 recommendations the federal agency
issued Thursday to help communities deal with ``clusters'' of
suicides.
   The recommendations stem from a conference held in New Jersey
late last year to enable communities that have not seen outbreaks
of suicide to learn from those that have.
   On March 11, 1987, four Bergenfield, N.J., teen-agers killed
themselves in a garage in an apparent death pact. Within six days,
four more teen-agers were dead in the Chicago suburbs, and
officials said those suicides probably were triggered by reports of
the New Jersey deaths.
   Rule No. 1 in the CDC recommendations: Be ready to take action.
   ``When the problem does arise with suicide clusters, there is
usually a great deal of confusion,'' O'Carroll said in an interview
Thursday. ``This confusion can lead to different sectors of the
community working at cross purposes.''
   The CDC said public and mental health agencies, schools,
government, police, suicide hotlines and even the news media should
cooperate in advance to make plans for their community.
   Then, if a suicide cluster appears to be developing, the
community should work together to cope with its grief while
watching other troubled youths to prevent further deaths, the
report said.
   Though there are as yet no definitive studies of
suicide-prevention approaches, ``I would never advocate doing
nothing,'' O'Carroll said. He said there is ``extremely
compelling'' evidence that suicides can trigger more suicides.
   Only about 5 percent of the 5,000 teen suicides a year in the
United States are believed to be part of ``clusters,'' O'Carroll
said, but those clusters present the best opportunity for action.
   The response to suicide in a community ``has got to be gauged
according to the situation,'' O'Carroll said.
   For example, the suicide of a student at home during a weekend
would not call for ``some kind of enormous SWAT-team approach'' in
school Monday morning, he said. In that case, quiet discussion
would be in order.
   But if three or four suicides occur in a matter of days, ``and
the community is going crazy, in that situation you will do far
more harm than good by trying to play it low-key,'' he said.
   Among other CDC recommendations:
   _Avoid glorifying the victims and their deaths, and minimize
sensationalism.
   _Identify those at high risk and refer them to counseling.
   _Arrange for timely and accurate information flow to news media.
   _Identify elements that might increase suicide attempts and
alter them; i.e., block off places where suicide attempts are
taking place.

<HEAD>Air France A320 Flight to Amsterdam Forced To Turn Around</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An Airbus A320 jet that suffered mechanical
problems on its inaugural flight in April returned to Paris after
warning lights indicated a fire on board, landing gear problems,
and a computer failure, an Air France spokesman said.
   Air France Flight 914, bound for Amsterdam with 81 passengers,
took off Thursday from Charles De Gaulle Airport about 4 p.m. and a
few minutes later, warning lights indicated failure of the plane's
computers, the spokesman said.
   The A320 is equipped with a ``fly-by-wire'' system that controls
the plane's engines through computers rather than cables.
   A second set of lights indicating a fire in the toilet also
illuminated without apparent cause, the spokesman said, speaking on
condition of anonymity in keeping with company policy.
   As the plane prepared to land, more lights flashed, warning that
the landing gear failed. The pilot made a pass over the airport and
Air France technicians visually confirmed that the landing gear was
in place. The plane landed without further incident, the spokesman
said.
   The passengers went on to Amsterdam aboard other flights.
   The plane, the ``Ville de Paris,'' was the first of the
sophisticated A320s to be delivered to Air France after the plane
was certified for flight on Feb. 26.
   The same plane was delayed because of mechanical problems on its
inaugural flight over Paris in April with then-Premier Jacques
Chirac on board. The half-hour delay led to discussions in the
French press about the wisdom of letting the premier fly on the new
aircraft.
   In June, three passengers were killed when an A320 crashed
during a low-altitude demonstration flight before thousands of
people at an air show in eastern France. An investigation is under
way into the cause of the accident.
   Developed over four years at a cost of nearly $2 billion, the
A320 has been touted by the European consortium Airbus Industrie as
the fastest-selling plane in aircraft history.
   Airbus has received more than 500 orders or letters of intent to
purchase the plane from 21 countries, including the United States,
Canada and Britain.

<DATELINE>YELLOWSTONE NATIONAL PARK, Wyo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Brisk winds carried a
108,300-acre blaze over fire lines Thursday, fanning flames to
within less than a half mile of one of Yellowstone National Park's
most scenic areas and forcing officials to close the park's west
entrance.
   Meanwhile, a fire that came within a mile of a nuclear missile
silo in Montana moved away Thursday, and authorities in Oregon
ordered evacuation plans be prepared as flames neared two small
communities.
   The lightning-sparked Walker Mountain fire in southern Oregon
sent flames 100 feet into the sky less than a mile from a
subdivision outside Grants Pass, prompting the order from state
officials late Thursday that evacuation plans be readied for the
subdivision.
   ``There are ashes falling just like rain on our deck,'' said
Helen McCall, who lives at the Grants Pass city limits, about two
miles south of the 1,200-acre fire. She said 400-500 people live in
the subdivision.
   In eastern Oregon, a 5,000-acre fire caused evacuation plans to
be readied for the tiny community of Troy near the Washington line.
   Effie Rozier of the Red Cross said Troy is a ``motel and a
restaurant'' with about 50 residents scattered nearby.
   Crews in Yellowstone began hosing down the 600 cabins and other
buildings at the Canyon area, one of the largest developments in
the nation's oldest national park, as flames became visible from
the area. Firefighters also began unrolling water lines on roofs
for sprinkler systems to bolster protection.
   By late afternoon, firefighters had drawn the flames away from
Canyon and back toward the main section of the big North Fork fire
by setting backfires, Fire Information Officer Judith Downing said.
While there was no immediate threat to structures at Canyon,
officials won't know if the area is out of danger before Sunday,
she said.
   Two other fires _ the 162,000-acre Clover-Mist fire on the
park's eastern side and a 88,326-acre in the park's southern end _
burned but threatened no buildings. Ash and smoke from the fires
reduced visibility significantly in Wyoming and brought haze and
brightly colored sunsets to Colorado.
   To the south of Yellowstone in Grand Teton National Park and the
Bridger-Teton National Forest, fire managers chose to herd a
15,569-acre blaze north toward Yellowstone, hoping it would run out
of fuel when it merged with other blazes.
   Elsewhere in the West, fire crews struggled with blazes in
Montana, Utah, Idaho, Washington and California.
   In Yellowstone, all roads into the Canyon area were closed and
heavy smoke obscured the sun and reduced visibility to less than
200 yards. With the park's south entrance already closed, only
three entrances now remain open.
   Park officials evacuated 361 visitors from Canyon on Tuesday,
moving them to other park lodgings.
   A fire erupted over 2,500 acres of a mining area in western
Montana, forcing evacuations at one mine, destroying a house and
two bulldozers and threatening a 500-kilovolt power line feeding
power to the Pacific Northwest, officials said.
   In southern Montana, firefighters battling a pair of major
wilderness forest fires that burned close to 60,000 acres braced
for a hot afternoon with gusting winds.
   A lightning storm moved toward the Helena area, where fire crews
hoped to contain a 37,600-acre blaze to the southeast, while a
1,300-acre fire in central Montana moved away from a Minuteman
missile silo.
   That fire broke out Wednesday afternoon and more than doubled to
900 acres overnight, but Zail Chapman, dispatcher for the Helena
National Forest in Great Falls, said, ``The missile silo is
completely secure.''
   Oregon State Fire Marshal Olin Greene issued a statewide ban on
outdoor burning, with the exception of approved field burning, a
day after Gov. Neil Goldschmidt declared a state of emergency in
southwest Oregon, where three major fires charred 2,600 acres and
destroyed a rural house. A 2,000-acre fire burned north of Wallowa
in the northeast part of the state.
   The declaration cleared the way for the National Guard to help
fight the fires, but no troops were called out.
   The fires in southwestern Oregon started with a series of
lightning storms Tuesday night; at least 60 fires, most of them
small, were reported.
   In western Idaho, flames from the raging 2,450-acre Eagle Bar
fire near Hells Canyon spotted into the middle of a valuable
commercial stand of timber, forcing fire bosses to divert at least
one helicopter to try to contain the new blaze. Four other major
blazes were burning on over 4,000 acres in the state.
   In Washington, firefighters battled two large fires covering
more than 750 acres southwest of Mount Rainier National Park and a
200-acre lightning-sparked fire threatened about 15 homes near the
Oregon border. More than 20 small new fires blazed up around the
state.
   Firefighters in eastern Utah expected to contain a 200-acre fire
in the Ashley National Forest 26 miles north of Vernal and a
separate 350-acre fire in northern Utah, according to fire
management officer Ivan Erskin. Officials blamed a spark from a
bulldozer for starting a 150-acre fire in northern Utah at the
Powder Mountain Ski Area.
   Near Cloverdale, Calif., about 65 miles north of San Francisco,
a grass fire set off by a welder's torch burned a barn where the
welder was working and charred some 1,200 acres in steep terrain.

<HEAD>DeSillers Spared Jail; Lawyer Says She's Unfairly Maligned</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By A.J. DICKERSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Maria DeSillers is an unfairly maligned woman who
handled donations for her dying son as best she could, according to
the lawyer who successfully battled contempt motions that could
have put her in jail.
   The court-appointed curator for Ronnie DeSillers' estate sought
a contempt ruling because Ms. DeSillers has refused to hand over
financial records and items allegedly bought with some of the
$690,000 in donations for the boy.
   But Dade Probate Judge Francis Christie dismissed the contempt
motions Thursday, saying that if Ms. DeSillers gave up the records
they might ``incriminate her'' in criminal probes under way in Dade
and Broward counties.
   ``I'm very happy,'' said Ms. DeSillers, who while awaiting the
ruling gave her age as ``33, the same as Christ when he was
crucified.''
   Curator Karen Gievers, appointed by Christie in March after Ms.
DeSillers' handling of the donations was questioned, contends that
about $200,000 may have been misspent on such purchases as a used
BMW worth $13,500, a diamond-and-sapphire ring, a diamond-studded
gold cross, clothing, furniture and 18 gravesites.
   Lawyers for Ms. Gievers had no comment after Christie's terse
ruling but later requested an emergency hearing today on their
requests to seize disputed belongings of Ms. DeSillers. Also, they
want the judge to strike her $150,000 claim on her son's estate,
said Frank Johnson, another of her attorneys.
   Defense lawyer Roy Black argued during the two-day hearing that
Ms. DeSillers enjoyed a Fifth Amendment right against
self-incrimination and shouldn't have to give up financial records
or the disputed purchases.
   He also said some of the donations were expressly for his
client's personal expenses.
   ``I'm not saying people gave it for Maria to buy jewelry. If she
bought a pickup truck for $20,000, which is what they cost today,
nobody would have criticized her,'' he told the judge.
   ``You'd think this was `Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous.' This
is not a woman who deserves to be humiliated,'' said Black, adding
that his client was unfairly portrayed as ``greedy and grasping''
when she gave thousands of dollars to poor families with sick
children.
   Ronnie, 7, died in April 1987 at Children's Hospital of
Pittsburgh while awaiting his fourth liver transplant. His plight
made national news after $4,000 raised by his classmates for the
operation was stolen from a school closet.
   Among the donations was $1,000 from President Reagan and
$200,000 from Miami Beach industrialist Victor Posner. About a
third of the donations remain, frozen in the boy's estate.
   Shortly before the ruling, Ms. DeSillers' former fiance, Jose
Castillo, was handcuffed and whisked away as he stepped out of the
courtroom where he had sat supportively behind Ms. DeSillers.
   Castillo hocked two IBM computers, monitors and printers worth
$4,000 at a Broward County pawn shop, Abbey's, which he and Ms.
DeSillers have often used in the past, said Metro-Dade Detective
Barry Garafola. One of the computer sets had been stolen in a March
robbery, and the other has not been traced.
   As he was led away, Castillo termed ``ridiculous'' charges of
grand theft and another of dealing in stolen property. Detectives
could not say if Ms. DeSillers was involved.
   Her handling of the money came under question when the
Pittsburgh hospital sued for the $262,000 balance of the boy's
bill. She refuses to pay, claiming Ronnie received improper care
there, a charge the hospital denies.

   The General Motors Corp. is recalling more
than 600,000 1983 Oldsmobiles and Buicks to replace an emissions
control component that may have stopped working.
   The Environmental Protection Agency said Thursday a defective
thermal vacuum switch causes the cars to exceed federal standards
on emission of gasoline vapors and carbon monoxide.
   The agency said 613,582 vehicles, all with 5-liter engines, are
involved in the recall. They are the 1983 Oldsmobile Cutlass
Supreme, Cutlass Cruiser, Delta 88, Ninety-Eight, Toronado and
Custom Cruiser, and the 1983 Buick Le Sabre, Estate Wagon, Electra
and Riviera.
   GM said that after years of contact with gasoline the rubber
compounds used to make the vacuum switch deteriorate and allow fuel
vapor to be burned by the engine.
   The defective switch has no effect on the operation of the car,
would take less than one hour to replace GM said. The EPA estimated
the time of repair at 20 minutes.

   The Hyatt Hotels Corp. which has been hit by
complaints from several employees, says it is dropping its ban on
cornrow hairstyles and has initiated a program to encourage more
minorities to enter the hotel and resort management industry.
   There have been several instances, including one highly
publicized incident in Washington, of Hyatt employees complaining
that prohibiting the tightly braided hairstyle discriminated
against blacks, who consider cornrows part of their ethnic heritage.
   Officials of the District of Columbia Human Rights Office said
Thursday t news conference with Hyatt executives that because of
the policy change it has decided not file a complaint against the
chain.
   ``They (Hyatt officials) exhibited a spirit of cooperation like
no other we've seen,'' said Maudine Cooper, director of the office.
``There were policies against cornrows, but Hyatt has since
eliminated that policy.''
   Hyatt said that as part of the settlement with the city, it was
creating a nationwide college scholarship program in which selected
students at 20 historically black colleges and universities will
have the opportunity to participate in a 10-week paid summer
training program designed to attract minorities to hotel and resort
management.

   An opposition leader claims public support for
Panama's military leader Manuel Antonio Noriega is deteriorating
dramatically.
   ``Noriega's government is weaker by the day. The regime is
fighting for its survival,'' said Ambassador Juan B. Sosa at a news
conference on Thursday to mark six months to the day after Panama's
upheaval began with the failed attempt to oust Noriega as commander
of Panama's Defense Forces.
   Sosa said that a combination of factors had led to a ``dramatic
deterioration'' of Noriega's public support.
   Sosa, who continues to serve as Panama's ambassador to the
United States, retains control over Panama's embassy despite the
Noriega government's attempt to replace him, said public opposition
to Noriega was evident earlier this month when hundreds of
thousands of Panamanians turned out for the funeral of former
President Arnulfo Arias.
   The United States continues to recognize Sosa as Panama's
ambassador and maintains that President Eric Arturo Delvalle, who
was ousted the day after his abortive attempt to fire Noriega, is
the legitimate authority in Panama.

<TEXT>
   The city today mourned the loss of its
historic Chiado district, devastated by flames that raged out of
control while firefighters were hampered by narrow cobblestone
streets and low water pressure.
   Cultural landmarks in the 10-block area were reduced to
smoldering ruins in the blaze that broke out before dawn Thursday
in a 19th century department store and caused bottles of butane gas
to explode.
   Both the Armazens do Grandela and the Grandes Armazens do
Chiado, the city's only department stores, were destroyed as were
the Costa e Martins speciality grocery, the Eduardo Martins china
shop and the 350-year-old Casa Batalha button store.
   The stores were among the oldest in Europe, and their wooden
floors, staircases and cashier booths dated from the late 19th
century when the stores were built to cater to the Portuguese
capital's emerging middle class.
   Neither was fitted with a sprinkler system and firefighters
complained about low water pressure.
   Civil defense officials said a 60-year-old man died when flames
engulfed his apartment and that 43 other people, most of them
firefighters, were hospitalized for burns and smoke inhalation.
Hundreds were evacuated.
   The fire destroyed the offices of many lawyers and accountants
who scurried down the slippery streets carrying files and
documents. They were joined by fleeing residents carrying cats,
dogs and caged parakeets.
   Firefighters did not arrive at the scene until an hour after the
fire was reported about 3 a.m. by a watchman at the 19th-century
elevator built by Gustave Eiffel to connect the Chiado to streets
in the area below. Fire equipment for the district had been called
out to another, minor fire and became stuck in the narrow streets.
   The Chiado was a favorite haunt of Portuguese writers and
musicians with its cafes and shops selling fine leather gloves,
buttons, books and records.
   Its destruction was described by newspapers as the worst
disaster to strike the capital since an earthquake and fire in
1755. Much of the Chiado was created when the Marques de Pombal
rebuilt Lisbon after the quake.
   The cause of the blaze was under investigation. Police on
Wednesday questioned Manuel Martins Dias, principal shareholder in
the group that owns The Armazens do Grandela, the three-story
department store where the blaze broke out, about a mysterious fire
in another store owned by the group.
   Seen from the air late Thursday afternoon through a cloud of
dense smoke, the walls of the burned-out buildings stood like the
ruins of war in the midst of a sunny, red-roofed city.
   ``Lisbon is poorer because of this catastrophe,'' President
Mario Soares told reporters day as the fire roared through
150-year-old buildings behind him.
   Conservative Prime Minister Anibal Cavaco Silva joined Soares on
a tour of the fire scene. Cavaco, an economist by training, said
the city will have to make ``a major effort'' to rebuild the area
and create employment for the estimated 2,000 people who lost their
jobs.
   Fire department Maj. Anibal Matos Silveira said the fire could
smolder for several more days because of the wooden structures in
the buildings and the highly combustible materials in the shops.
   Hundreds of volunteer firefighters from towns and industrial
suburbs outside Lisbon poured into the city to help fight the blaze
as crowds of people gathered in the central Rossio Square to watch.

<TEXT>
   The controversy surrounding Dan Quayle's service
in the National Guard is ``a total creation of the media,'' says
the wife of the Republican vice presidential candidate.
   Marilyn Quayle makes her comments in an interview with Barbara
Walters for the ABC News program ``20-20,'' to be aired tonight,
and in today's editions of The Washington Times.
   ``I anticipated they (the media) would try their hardest to
knock Danny and they have certainly exceeded my wildest dreams,''
Mrs. Quayle told the newspaper in an interview from Boonville, Mo.
   Asked why she thought people are reacting so strongly to the
question of whether Dan Quayle pulled strings to enter the National
Guard at the height of the Vietnam War, Mrs. Quayle said in the
television interview: ``I don't think people are. I think it's a
total creation of the media.''
   Mrs. Quayle added that it had ``crossed her mind'' that
journalists are out to get George Bush's running mate.
   ``I can't substantiate that,'' she said in the television
interview recorded Wednesday. ``I think part of it is just the fact
that there were so many members of the media down in New Orleans
with nothing to do. And they decided they would find a story. And
they looked wherever they thought they could and dug something up.''
   ``They are supposed to be the news gatherers, the disseminators
and not the destroyers,'' Mrs. Quayle told the newspaper.
   She added that her biggest chore has been shielding her three
children _ Tucker 14, Benjamin, 11, and Corinne, 9 _ from the
coverage on television and in the papers and keeping their spirits
high.

   Share prices plummeted while the dollar also lost
ground in Tokyo trading Friday following key interest rates hikes
in Europe the previous day.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues, a 70.77
point-winner Thursday, lost 305.03 points, or 1.09 percent, to
close at 27,565.41.
   The dollar, which opened at 133.58 yen, down from Thursday's
133.76-yen finish, closed the week at 133.50 yen, down 0.26 yen. It
traded mainly between a range of 133.35-.73 yen during the day.
   Dealers said share prices were lower across the board in
cautious, thin trading because of speculation that the United
States might hike its interest rates in response to a round of
European rate hikes on Thursday.
   ``To make things worse, now is the end of the month, when the
trading (in Tokyo) normally slows down,'' said one stock dealer,
speaking on condition of anonymity.
   West Germany's Bundesbank raised its discount rate by 0.5
percent to 3.5 percent Thursday to support the mark and curb
inflation. France, Switzerland, the Netherlands and Austria also
raised their official rates, and Britain signaled an increase in
commercial rates.
   The weak dollar in Tokyo widely was attributed to dollar-selling
following a recovery by the mark after the Bundesbank rate hike and
the U.S. currency's subsequent relative decline.

<HEAD>Romania's Top Chess Player Asks Asylum, Says Romanian Officials
Harassed Him</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID GOODMAN</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Romania's top chess player says he has asked for
political asylum, contending Romanian officials harassed him after
he refused to play a tournament in a city he says is contaminated
with radioactive waste.
   ``The (Romanian Chess) Federation wanted to force me to do
things which were against the interests of my health and my
family,'' Mihai Suba told a Thursday news conference in the British
capital, where he is playing a tournament. ``They tried to get to
this point by blackmail, by threatening me.''
   ``It's not a pleasure,'' the 41-year-old chess grandmaster said
of his defection. He has also asked for asylum for his 14-year-old
son Christian, who is accompanying him.
   ``It's a necessity. It was unavoidable. I think it was the last
opportunity, at least with somebody of my family,'' he said.
   His wife, Sanda, 39, and a 9-year-old son, Viktor, remain in the
Romanian capital of Bucharest. He said he hoped his wife would
eventually be able to join him in London.
   He said Romanian authorities tried to punish him because he
refused to compete in a tournament in the Black Sea resort of
Eforia. He claimed the area was contaminated with major radioactive
deposits that threatened the health of the inhabitants.
   Suba also complained that the results of school examinations his
elder son took were lowered to help the children of highly placed
officials. ``I was very upset about this,'' he said.
   Suba told reporters he contacted the United Kingdom Immigrants
Advisory Service, a private organization that helps would-be
immigrants, on Tuesday and mailed an application to the Home
Office, which is in charge of immigration.
   A Home Office spokesman refused to confirm whether the Subas
applied to defect to Britain.
   Suba is ranked 78th in the chess world.
   His decision to defect didn't interfere with his play at the
Lloyds Bank Masters tournament.
   He was leading the 100 players in the tournament after five
rounds on Wednesday, but a loss in the sixth round on Thursday hurt
his chances of picking up the $2,125 first prize. Soviet Vassily
Smyslov, a former world champion, was among those competing.
   The Romanian grandmaster is the latest addition to a list of
celebrated Soviet and Eastern European chess players who have
sought asylum in the West. They include Viktor Korchnoi, who now
lives in Switzerland, and Lev Alburt, the 1986 U.S. champion who
lives in New York.
   Suba, who holds a masters degree in mathematics, said he would
support himself by winning chess prizes and looking for a job in
mathematics or computers. His visa allows him to stay in Britain
until the end of the year.

<HEAD>Defense Weekly: Cuba Using Lethal Chemicals Against Angolan Rebels</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Cuba is using poison gas to flush out South
African-backed Angolan guerrillas from their rural strongholds,
according to a U.N. expert quoted in a British defense publication.
   Jane's Defense weekly quoted Aubin Heyndrickx, head of
toxicology at the University of Ghent in Belgium and a U.N. expert
on biological and chemical warfare, as saying evidence based on
environmental samples shows Cuba is using the lethal mixture of
mustard gas and nerve gases.
   Soil, leaf and water samples taken from Angolan battle zones in
April showed clear traces of the gases, Heyndrickx was quoted as
saying.
   Jane's Defense weekly is an authoritative publication dealing
with military matters worldwide.
   The attack must have taken place in March or April, Heyndrickx
was quoted as saying, because the nerve gases are extremely
volatile and would not remain in the environment for longer than a
few weeks.
   The professor was quoted as saying he couldn't tell exactly
which nerve gas was used, although he knows it is one of the three
neurotoxins _ Soman, Tabun or Sarin. He did not say if any rebels
were killed by the gas.
   The report came as U.S. mediators were working on a compromise
timetable for a withdrawal of 50,000 Cuban troops from Angola.
South Africa has promised to pull out its troops from Angola by
Sept. 1 and grant independence to South-West Africa, also known as
Namibia, on condition the Cubans leave.
   Heyndrickx was quoted as saying he is convinced the Cubans are
continuing to uses gases in Angola to help win the war against
rebels of the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola.
   ``I'm sure the Cubans will go ahead with this. This is the new
military tactic,'' Jane's quoted him as saying.
   The guerrillas, backed by South Africa and the United States,
have been fighting since 1975 to force the Cuban- and Soviet-backed
Angolan government to share power. The guerrillas control large
portions of southern Angola.
   The professor was quoted as saying he has gas detection kits
captured from Cuban soldiers which are designed to measure whether
levels of poison in the atmosphere are toxic for man.
   A University of Ghent team examined patients in guerrilla field
hospitals and found evidence of nerve gas attacks in 1986 and 1984,
but none of those victims showed any trace of mustard gas, he was
quoted as saying.

<HEAD>California Newspaper Urges Quayle To Leave Ticket</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONG BEACH, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   As Republican vice presidential
nominee Dan Quayle headed to California for a two-day campaign
swing, the Press-Telegram joined the Des Moines Register in urging
him to leave the ticket he shares with Vice President George Bush.
   The Press-Telegram, in an editorial in today's editions, said
allegations about the Indiana senator's military record and his
link to a female lobbyist who appeared nude in Playboy are
distracting voters from the real issues in the election.
   ``If Dan Quayle remains on the Republican ticket, neither Bush
nor the nation will be well served,'' the editorial said.
   The editorial went on: ``Even when the candidates talk about
these issues, they are not heard. Media and public attention
focuses on J. Danforth Quayle, a handsome man with a short,
undistinguished record in the House and Senate and an intolerable
burden as a candidate.''
   The editorial called Quayle hypocritical for styling himself a
hawk on defense issues when he spent the Vietnam War years writing
press releases in the National Guard and imprudent for sharing a
condominium on a golfing trip with two congressional colleagues and
lobbyist Paula Parkinson.
   The editroial suggested possible replacements for Quayle as
Kansas Sen. Robert Dole, New York Rep. Jack Kemp, Indiana Sen.
Richard Lugar, or ``someone else with a deserved reputation for
integrity and leadership.''

   For years, a mother and three grown children
in this small town were known as a strange brood: their furniture
was upside down, they refused to use household plumbing and shouted
at all hours of the night.
   But the odd habits of Anna K. Moore, 68, and her children
generated only sympathy from townspeople, which deepened when
utility workers found the decomposed body of Mrs. Moore's daughter,
Dawn, in their house, officials said.
   ``I feel terrible about this whole situation,'' said John C.
Mullins, the police chief in this southeast Kentucky town of 8,000
people. ``To me, the outcome of this is the Moore family is going
to be stuck in a mental institution.''
   Officers on Wednesday arrested Mrs. Moore, her 38-year-old
daughter Michella and Michella's twin brother John, police said.
They were taken to a Lexington hospital for a medical evaluation
ordered by Whitley District Judge R. Blaine Stewart.
   The family's strange habits had grown stranger in the last two
or three years, according to Mayor Tom Thurston. In addition to the
upside-down furniture, shouting and refusal to use plumbing, the
house was falling apart and there was no glass in the windows.
   On Aug. 5, gas workers checking a meter at the house found
35-year-old Dawn Moore's body in a bedroom after Mrs. Moore asked
them if they would like to see her daughter, officials said.
   The family had put Miss Moore to bed after she collapsed July 8,
then rubbed her with lotions and flour in an attempt to heal her,
authorities said.
   Mrs. Moore later said she did not realize her daughter had died
until Miss Moore's body turned black.
   The woman died of natural causes, said Whitley County Coroner
Carl Paul, citing a preliminary autopsy report.
   The medical examination of the family was requested by Mrs.
Moore's brother, Richard Taylor of Louisiana, after he heard about
his niece's death, said his attorney, Darrell Saunders.
   For the people of Corbin, the order that the Moores be examined
represents an emotional release, Thurston said.
   ``We have a community that would have helped, if they had been
allowed,'' said the mayor. ``But they (the Moores) were unusually
independent and would not accept aid by anybody.''
   The family was considered harmless. John Moore used to listen to
his portable radio while he picked up trash downtown and his
sisters sat on a curb and watched.
   Mrs. Moore and Michella were arrested as they walked to a
grocery store, said police Lt. Pauline Burgan. They did not resist,
but did not seem to know what was happening, she said.
   ``The mother started hollering, `Don't hurt my daughter,' and
that was it,'' the lieutenant said.
   John Moore, arrested in woods behind his house, was handcuffed
after he screamed, neighbors said.
   ``I liked to cried when I saw them put him in the police car,''
said Harold Adkins.
   Stewart, acting on an initial medical evaluation at the police
department, ordered the Moores taken to Eastern State Hospital in
Lexington nearly 80 miles to the north.
   Under state law, the hospital evaluation must be conducted
within 72 hours. If it is determined the Moores need medical
attention and cannot care for themselves, they are entitled to a
hearing and trial before commitment.
   City Manager Dick Vermillion said committing the Moores would be
in the family's best interest.
   ``I think we would have been criticized real hard if we hadn't
taken action,'' he said. ``Suppose it happened again?''
   But Mullins, who knew the Moore children growing up, said
committing the family to a mental institution would be a ``real
injustice.''
   ``They may get properly clothed and properly fed,'' the police
chief said. ``But are they going to be happy there? Separated? I
don't think so.''

<HEAD>Lawmakers Go Back To Work After Opposition Walkout</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MEXICO CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lawmakers facing a Sept. 1 deadline for
certifying a new Chamber of Deputies returned to work early today
before an empty public gallery following a stormy debate that one
legislator said was proof of democracy.
   Opposition legislators walked out just before dawn Thursday
after a rowdy, all-night session of the chamber, sitting as an
electoral college to certify results of the July 6 general election.
   When the meeting resumed, the public galleries were closed,
although the press was allowed in.
   Opposition sympathizers earlier Thursday chanted, whistled,
threw coins and other objects and rose to comment on what in the
past have been staid sessions endorsing sweeping victories by the
governing Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI.
   ``Cuauhtemoc won!'' was a frequent chant.
   Presidential candidate Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, the leader of a
democratic reform movement, claims the PRI cheated him of victory.
   His supporters form the biggest bloc of opposition legislators
in the chamber, where the PRI must now contend with the strongest
opposition in nearly 60 years.
   The head of the PRI delegation, Guillermo Jimenez Morales, said
the unprecedented debate ``shows clearly that we are living within
a democratic framework.''
   The July 6 elections were tainted by widespread accusations that
the PRI tampered with voter registration rolls, stuffed ballot
boxes and destroyed ballots for opposition candidates.
   Opposition leaders have accused the party of steamroller tactics
to speed vote certification, especially in the chamber.
   ``We have to seek new ways (of protest) because the official
party is legitimizing fraud more and more every day,'' Alfredo
Noyola of the opposition National Action Party said Thursday after
227 opposition delegates walked out, temporarily halting the
chamber's work.
   He accused PRI delegates of rejecting all opposition requests to
investigate fraud. Jimenez Morales denied the charge.
   The body, made up of newly elected or re-elected deputies
themselves, must finish its work by Sept. 1, the date of outgoing
President Miguel de la Madrid's state-of-the-union address.
   The chamber must also certify the presidential election by the
Dec. 1 inauguration day of Carlos Salinas de Gortari, the PRI
candidate.
   If the deadlines aren't met, the PRI will suffer twin
embarrassments. There will be no Chamber of Deputies to sit in
joint session with the Senate for De la Madrid's speech, and he
will be unable to follow the PRI's tradition of formally
introducing the new president.
   Jimenez Morales said Thursday the nation's ``constitutional
order'' will be shattered if the chamber does not finish by Sept. 1.
   The PRI has not lost a presidential election since it was
founded in 1929, but the July 6 balloting marked the first time the
PRI won the presidency with less than 70 percent of the votes cast.
The PRI-dominated Federal Election Commission says Salinas won with
50.36 percent of the vote.
   Cardenas, a former PRI leader who broke away to head the leftist
National Democratic Front coalition, came in second with 31.1
percent. Manuel J. Clouthier of the conservative National Action
Party came in third with 17 percent.
   Also for the first time, the PRI did not win every race for the
64-member Senate. Four opposition senators already have been
certified for their posts. The Senate, sitting as a separate
electoral college, has been meeting routinely.
   Cardenas and Clouthier have urged Mexicans to reject the
election results.
   They have also accused the government of denying the electoral
colleges access to documents from about half the nation's 55,000
polling stations. The government denies the charge.
   On Thursday the PRI majority on the Federal Election Commission
rejected an opposition proposal to let the two electoral colleges
examine the documents. PRI representative David Jimenez said it
wasn't necessary since party representatives saw them on election
day, the Excelsior news service said.
   Soldiers earlier this week blocked opposition deputies from
entering the room where ballots are under guard.
   By law, the deputies- and senators-elect sit as separate
electoral colleges to certify their own elections, and then the
500-member Chamber of Deputies sits as an electoral college to
certify the presidential election.

   Pain and suffering were written on the face of
Emmanuel Kotlyar as he stressed to prominent political and cultural
figures the importance of building a center to chronicle the
millions _ like himself _ who fell victim to Josef Stalin.
   The frail man of 80 said he spent 14 years in a labor camp after
being arrested in 1929 on trumped-up charges, and hoped he would
live to see the building completed.
   ``We aren't doing it for us, but for the future generation,'' to
prevent a repetition of the terror, the balding Kotlyar said, his
body shaking, his voice trembling.
   Kotlyar stood with a cane at a microphone Thursday night in a
packed auditorium.
   For 2{ hours, about 200 intellectuals at the Union of Architects
headquarters brainstormed about what a monument to Stalin's victims
should look like, where it should be built and whether it should be
accompanied by a center that would study the repressions.
   No formal program or plan came out of the session, which brought
together the main forces behind the drive to put up a monument to
Stalin's victims: the informal group Memorial, officials of
theatrical, film and architect unions, Ogonyok, and the weekly
newspaper Literaturnaya Gazeta.
   There was no agenda, and those interested in speaking simply
took the microphone.
   ``We are tired of monuments,'' said Kotlyar. ``We have so many
of them. We need a center.''
   One of the center's main tasks, he said, should be to answer the
question of how many people were killed and imprisoned by Stalin
from the 1930s to 1950s.
   Those in the audience included Andrei Sakharov, one of the
founders of the country's dissident movement. Seated nearby was
Sergei Grigoryants, who publishes an unsanctioned journal called
``Glasnost,'' named after Mikhail S. Gorbachev's policy of openness.
   He received a fresh reminder Sunday, after a demonstration
against the Soviet-led invasion of Czechoslovakia 20 years ago,
that even under Gorbachev, expression of dissident political views
can land a citizen in jail. Grigoryants was among dozens of
demonstrators hauled away to a police station.
   Two popular intellectuals who have used art as axes to chip away
at Stalinism, author Anatoly Rybakov and playwright Mikhail
Shatrov, also attended.
   Last winter, Memorial, a band of scholars, lawyers and history
buffs, took to the streets with a petition drive and demonstrations
that got them detentions, fines and threats. But the crackdown was
halted suddenly this summer.
   With Gorbachev's support, the Communist Party conference that
ended July 1 passed a resolution called for a monument in Moscow to
Stalin's victims, who Western specialists estimate number about 20
million.
   The Union of Architects has since proposed converting a prison
in Sukhanovo, 15 miles east of Moscow, into a complex that would
include a monument, museum and archives containing documents about
the victims.
   Sukhanovo was a monastery before Soviet rule but under Stalin
was used as a prison where inmates were routinely tortured. It is
believed to be run now by the KGB.
   A competition for the design of the memorial complex is to be
held late this year or early next year, and organizers have set up
a special bank account to accept donations from the public to
finance the project.
   Groups in the Baltic republics and the Siberian city of Chita
are raising money for local monuments to Stalin's victims.

   A man has been accused of sending
threatening letters to pop singer Debbie Gibson, authorities said.
   Richard Pelfrey, 36, of Barberton, appeared in Municipal Court
on Thursday on charges of aggravated menacing and extortion for
allegedly making threats toward the singer and her family.
   A Summit County sheriff's spokesman, Tony DeLuca, said Pelfrey
sent threatening letters to the singer's publicity agency in New
York. Ms. Gibson performed in Cuyahaga Falls Thursday night.
   Pelfrey was being held in the Barberton jail in lieu of $3,500
cash bond.

   The number of applicants to medical schools is at
a 10-year low, partly because ``Baby Boomers'' are passing college
age and partly because the medical profession has lost some of its
glow, officials say.
   Medical school applicants numbered 10 percent fewer for the
1987-88 academic year than in 1986-87, and more than 30 percent
fewer than a decade before, according to a report in today's
Journal of the American Medical Association.
   ``Physicians are generally advising potential medical school
applicants not to go to medical school,'' said Dr. Marten Kernis,
vice dean of the University of Illinois College of Medicine, the
nation's largest medical school with 1,300 students.
   ``Physicians are working right now in a changing environment
with all sorts of federal regulations being imposed, changing
reimbursement policies, huge increases in medical malpractice
liability premiums, large increases in lawsuits, changes in the tax
structure, et cetera,'' he said Thursday.
   ``Many physicians are arguing that these characteristics are
mitigating against the practice of medicine.''
   The journal also noted that eight of 10 medical students are
debt when they graduate, and their average debt load is larger than
it has ever been _ $35,621 in 1987.
   The greatest increases in medical school enrollment are among
women and minorities, the journal said.
   John Sherman, executive vice president of the Association of
American Medical Colleges, agreed that medicine has lost some of
its luster.
   ``We know for certain that young people these days who otherwise
would be interested and qualified are being turned away from
medicine by their perception of what's involved _ both medical
education and practice,'' he said in a telephone interview from
Washington, D.C.
   The University of Illinois last week decided to cut 1989
enrollment by 10 percent, in keeping with reduced federal support
the past several years because of a projected doctor glut.
   Other schools are following a similar course, said Kernis, who
noted that colleges and medical schools are seeing the end of the
``Baby Boom'' generation.
   In addition, potential applicants may be discouraged by the
increasing cost of medical education, the perception that medicine
is more technological and less humane than it once was and the long
period of training involved, he said.
   The AMA reported that a total of 65,742 students were enrolled
in the nation's 127 accredited medical schools for 1987-88, a
decline of 400 students from the previous year and 1,701 fewer than
in 1983-84.
   The number of applicants was down for the third straight year,
to 28,123, and reflects a general decline over the past 10 years.
In 1977-78, for example, medical school applicants numbered 40,569,
the AMA said.
   In the past five years, the number of first-year white male
students has decreased by 13.2 percent, to 8,216, while the number
of black male students has decreased by 6.8 percent, to 572, the
journal said.
   But in the same period, the number of first-year white female
students increased by less than one-tenth of 1 percent, to 4,363,
while the number of black female students increased 31.7 percent,
to 682, it said.
   Women accounted for 37 percent of 1987-88 medical school
applicants and 36.5 percent of entering classes, the journal said.
   The number of Asians or Pacific Islanders entering U.S. medical
schools has more than doubled, with the percentage of first-year
male students increasing by 106.5 percent, to 1,179, and that of
female students by 128.4 percent, to 676, the journal said.
   ``I think that's a social phenomenon,'' Kernis said. ``We've had
a lot of immigration among Pacific islanders and Vietnamese and
Cambodians.''

   Nearly 12,000 people and dozens of famous
friends sang ``Happy Birthday'' to Leonard Bernstein in a four-hour
tribute that left America's most famous living conductor, usually
loquacious, nearly speechless.
   Bernstein chuckled and wept as friends, including actress Lauren
Bacall and composer-producer Quincy Jones, recalled the
conductor-composer's life and work at Thursday night's 70th
birthday gala at the Tanglewood music festival.
   But words almost failed the maestro when he was pulled to the
lectern for the finale.
   As hundreds of performers and the audience of 12,000 stamped
their feet, Bernstein shook his head ``no.''
   He grabbed the microphone, said, ``As Victor Borge would say
...,'' then let out a wail characteristic of the comic pianist.
   Most of the audience and 250 performers then sang ``Happy
Birthday'' to Bernstein before he walked offstage ahead of Bacall,
Jones and other celebrated pals.
   The Berkshire Hills gala was billed as one of the music world's
great events. The master of ceremonies was Beverly Sills, the
former diva who is retiring as director of the New York City Opera
in November.
   ``I love Lenny,'' she said. ``The only thing I would not do for
him is sing.''
   Besides the friends who volunteered their talents to honor
Bernstein and benefit the music school where he cut his conducting
teeth, performers, playwrights, poets and the New York Philharmonic
_ his old orchestra _ videotaped birthday messages that were
televised on huge screens at Tanglewood.
   It was all in honor of a man who gained enormous popularity and
fame with works ranging from Broadway classics like ``West Side
Story'' to classical compositions like ``Mass.''
   ``There once was a boy named Lenny, whose talents were varied
and many,'' sang Bacall in a song written by Stephen Sondheim for
the occasion. ``Poor Lenny, 10 gifts too many.''
   Borge praised Bernstein's flamboyance at the baton.
   ``A normal conductor comes in, bows, turns his back on the
audience and that's it,'' Borge said. ``With Lenny, he comes in,
you're already smiling.''
   Jones recalled being shocked when he first met Bernstein.
   ``I was all set to meet a man who was shy and introverted,
conservative, concerned about health food,'' recalled Jones.
``Wrong. This man goes to bed at 6:30 in the morning and at 6:45 he
wakes up.''
   Frank Sinatra sent a congratulatory letter that began ``Dear
Genius,'' and there were affectionate regards from leaders of
several countries, including President Reagan, Francois Mitterrand
of France and Prince Rainier of Monaco.
   Bernstein kissed and hugged friends throughout the night, but
declined to talk about the celebration and ordered photographers to
stop taking pictures of his 90-year-old mother, Jennie.
   ``You're going to tire out my poor old mummy,'' he said.
   But ``mummy'' was impressed.
   ``I've been to many events with Lenny, but this here tops it
all,'' she said.
   The concert, which launched a four-day benefit for the
Tanglewood music school, featured a smattering of short pieces with
a strong personal connection to Bernstein.
   Songwriter Betty Comden and pop singer Patti Austen, for
example, sang tunes from his Broadway shows ``On the Town'' and
``Wonderful Town.''
   His children sang a song they had written for him which included
the lines ``It's true the most difficult man in my life is you. A
guy who gives and gives is a hard kind of guy to live with.''
   Crying, Bernstein stood up and blew kisses. He also ran down the
aisle to embrace emigre Soviet cellist Mstislav Rostropovich, who
flew in from Paris to play ``Don Quixote.''
   That composition was one of the works Bernstein conducted in his
1943 debut with the New York Philharmonic as a last-minute
substitute for the ailing Bruno Walter. The appearance catapulted
Bernstein to instant stardom as a young, uniquely American
conductor in a field then dominated by older Europeans.
   Bernstein was among the first graduates of the Tanglewood school
in 1940 and has taught there every summer since.

<HEAD>Korean Talks Break Down; No More Discussions On Olympics Set</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By C.W. LIM</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>PANMUNJOM, Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   North Korea and South Korea today failed
to clear the way for full-scale talks on sharing the Olympics and
on a non-aggression pact, and both sides blamed each other for the
breakdown.
   The only agreement after more than three hours of talks was to
meet again Oct. 13 after the Olympics to continue talks on easing
tension.
   The two five-member delegations of legislators shook hands and
smiled before the meeting at the Panmunjom truce site, which
straddles the neutral Demilitarized Zone separating the two Koreas.
   But delegates later blamed each other for failing to resolve the
dispute over the Olympics, to be held in Seoul Sept. 17-Oct. 2.
   ``It has been confirmed that South Korea attempted to blow away
the Olympic question,'' the chief North Korean delegate, Chon Kum
Chol, told reporters.
   South Korean officials refused to rule out the possibility of a
last-minute bid to get the North to take part in the Games, but
they have rejected the North's demand to be a co-host of the Games.
   ``At this stage one thing is sure, that co-hosting is
impossible,'' said South Korean delegate Lee Han-dong.
   Chon denied the North would attempt to disrupt the Olympics.
South Korea fears its archrival may stage terrorist attacks during
the Games.
   North Korea has said it will boycott the Olympics unless it is
made a co-host. The International Olympic Committee rejected the
demand, saying the Olympics are awarded to a single city and cannot
be shared.
   North Korea insists that full-scale talks should have
non-aggression as their top item. It also demands the full
parliaments of both sides take part, while the South called for
smaller delegations.
   Also disputed is a North Korean demand that the two legislatures
publish a joint declaration of non-aggression, calling for the
withdrawal of 42,000 U.S. troops based in South Korea. South Korea
considers the U.S. military presence essential to its defense.
   The chief South Korean delegate, Park Joon-kyu, told reporters
the talks should not be considered a failure, because the two sides
had agreed to another meeting.
   ``The best thing to come out of this meeting is that we continue
to have talks,'' he said.
   The two Koreas are bitter rivals with hundreds of thousands of
troops facing each other along their tense 150-mile border.
   The peninsula was divided into communist North Korea and
pro-Western South Korea at the end of World War II. They fought the
Korean War from 1950 to 1953, which left more than a million people
dead.

<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   American endurance swimmer Lynne Cox crossed
Siberia's Lake Baikal today in four hours and 20 minutes, the
official Tass news agency reported.
   In a brief dispatch from the city of Irkutsk near the
crescent-shaped lake that is the deepest in the world, Tass said
the 31-year-old resident of Los Alamitos, Calif., swam about 11.25
miles in 52-degree water.
   She began at Tolstoy Cap and finished at the lakeside village of
Listvyanka in good physical condition, the news agency said.
   ``It was the first time in history that such a long swim was
accomplished in the icy waters of Baikal,'' Tass said.
   Ms. Cox, who had planned to do the swim Sunday, moved up the
date because of forecasts of bad weather in the lake area next
week. She had been training by staying in Baikal waters for several
hours a day, Tass said.
   Baikal, about 1,800 miles east of Moscow and north of Mongolia,
spans a long narrow valley between mountain ranges and is noted for
severe and changeable weather. The lake holds one-fifth of the
world's fresh water and reaches a depth of 4,800 feet at some
points.
   Ms. Cox has been making long-distance swims for more than a
decade, including crossing the English Channel, the Strait of
Magellan and the Cook Strait.
   Last year she swam 2.7 miles across the frigid Bering Strait to
the Soviet Union's far eastern extreme. She has said her endurance
swim across Lake Baikal was intended to promote U.S.-Soviet
friendship, peace and sports.

   A boat carrying Moslem pilgrims sank
after it was swamped by high waves on the flooded Padma River, and
a newspaper today said that 10 bodies were recovered and 50 others
were feared dead.
   The Bangladesh Observer reported that the boat was carrying 80
villagers to a Moslem holy site 40 miles southwest of Dhaka when it
sank early Wednesday.
   Police sources in Mmanikganj District reached by phone confirmed
that a boat sank Wednesday but did not report any deaths. They
refused to elaborate.
   The paper said 20 passengers were rescued by nearby fishing
boats. It said the 10 bodies were recovered by Thursday night and
50 others were feared drowned.
   Ferry and boat accidents are quite common in Bangladesh. On
Tuesday, a boat hit by a launch sank in the same stretch of the
river and police feared that 21 people were dead.
   Another ferry sank in southern Bangladesh on Monday and at least
50 people were feared dead, according to a newspaper.
   In Bangladesh, officials usually do not confirm deaths in
accidents, although local press reports are not denied.

<HEAD>Famed Lawyer Who Defended James Earl Ray Dies</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RUTH RENDON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Famed trial attorney Percy Eugene Foreman, best
known for bartering a guilty plea for the life of the man who
killed Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., has died at age 86.
   Foreman, often hailed as the king of Texas' criminal defense
lawyers, died minutes after suffering cardiac arrest Thursday at
Methodist Hospital.
   Mike DeGeurin, Foreman's law partner, said Foreman was admitted
to the hospital July 15. He was being released last week when he
suffered a heart attack.
   ``He worked up until the day he went into the hospital,'' said
DeGeurin, who worked with Foreman for 14 years. ``He actually
conducted business in the intensive care unit. He was shooing
doctors away.''
   Foreman was known for his courtroom theatrics, issue-clouding
rhetoric, spotlight shifting and verbal attacks on prosecution
witnesses that kept law students and spectators spellbound.
   ``In a murder case, you should never allow the defendant to be
tried,'' he once explained. ``Try someone else _ the husband, the
lover, the police, or if the case has social implications, society
generally. But never the defendant.''
   Foreman, however, persuaded James Earl Ray to plead guilty to
the 1968 slaying of King, the Nobel Prize-winning civil rights
activist, in exchange for a 99-year sentence. Ray charged later
that Foreman pressured him into the plea by saying the odds were
``99 percent'' certain he would go to the electric chair if he
faced a jury.
   Foreman estimated once he had tried 1,500 death penalty cases,
but of his clients, only a restaurateur named Steve Mitchell was
executed. Mitchell was convicted in 1952 of shooting his wife and
Foreman, who consistently opposed the death penalty, said later
Mitchell had ``deserved to die.''
   ``You can't win 'em all,'' he said.
   Foreman, born in a log cabin outside Livingston on June 21,
1902, was the middle child in a family of 10. His father and
grandfather were sheriffs of Polk County, but he chose to study law
at the University of Texas.
   ``I decided at age 8 to become a lawyer,'' he told The
Associated Press during an interview last December. ``I was
operating a shoeshine stand on a principal corner of the
courthouse. Lawyers would sit around the corner. They seemed to
live better and work less. I thought it'd be an easy way to make a
living.''
   Aside from handling death penalty cases, Foreman also made
headlines by handling divorce cases and claimed to have handled
more divorce cases than anyone else in the world. He was listed in
the Guinness Book of World Records for having attained the highest
cash settlement in a contested divorce in 1963 when Cecil Amelia
Blaffer Hudson got $9.5 million in cash, plus $20 million to $30
million in art.
   ``His style, his technique, his manner of handling himself
before the jury had a dramatic affect on my career. Not only mine,
but many other men and women in the state who practice law,'' said
Houston's other famed attorney, Richard ``Racehorse'' Haynes, who
used to skip law school classes to watch Foreman in court.
   ``I don't pretend to be the greatest lawyer who ever lived or
even the greatest lawyer today,'' Foreman said in December.
   ``But on the other hand I don't deny it.''
   Foreman's wife, Marguerite, died in 1979. Survivors include a
son, William of Galveston; a daughter, Marguerite of Huntsville; a
brother, Keith of Austin; and two sisters.
   Services were tentatively set for Monday in Settegast-Kopf
Funeral Home, DeGeurin said.

   A small plane carrying Deputy Prime
Minister Shah Moazzem Hossain and four others rammed into a jeep
during takeoff, killing the jeep's driver but causing no other
casualties, the official BSS news agency reported today.
   The accident occured at Bogra airport in northern Bangladesh on
Thursday when the aircraft skidded off the runway and hit the
parked jeep. News reports said one of the wheels of the plane
collapsed during takeoff and caused the aircraft to skid.
   The aircraft, which can carry up to seven people, was badly
damaged, BSS said.
   The jeep belonged to a local administrative officer who had come
to see off Hossain. Bogra is 100 miles north of Dhaka, the capital.

<TEXT>
   U.S. mediators are working on a
compromise plan for 50,000 Cuban troops to withdraw from Angola
within 18 months, sources close to negotiations between South
Africa, Angola and Cuba said.
   But the plan, offered during talks scheduled to conclude today,
is likely to be unacceptable to the Angolans and Cubans who were
insisting on a minimum of two years, the sources said. They spoke
Thursday on condition of anonymity.
   South Africa has promised to pull its troops out of Angola by
Sept. 1 and grant independence to Angola's southern neighbor,
South-West Africa, within a year, as long as the Cubans withdraw.
   The Marxist Angolan government publicly has offered to send the
Cubans home in four years.
   On Thursday, the four parties did not meet together, leaving the
Americans to work out a compromise proposal.
   Chester Crocker, secretary of state for Africa affairs, said the
talks ``were well on their way,'' though it is ``too soon to
anticipate their results.'' He commented in an interview with Congo
radio broadcast Thursday.
   Crocker said all parties had ``adopted a serious and
constructive approach'' for the conference.
   Diplomats refused to discuss details of the talks or say whether
new proposals for the Cuban withdrawal were offered.
   The Cubans back Angola's Marxist government in a 13-year-old war
with U.S.- and South African-supported rebels.
   In Windhoek, South-West Africa, the South African-led
territorial army said Thursday that it will lift a 7-year-old
overnight curfew in the northern war zone on Sept. 1.
   The curfew will not be reimposed if pro-independence guerrillas
of the South-West African People's Organization adhere to their
offer to observe a cease-fire beginning Sept. 1, a military
statement said.
   The curfew was imposed in 1981 throughout Ovamboland, the
northernmost and most populous region of South-West Africa, which
is also known as Namibia.

<HEAD>Crack Dealers Using Business Cards, Police Say</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In the classic capitalist manner, drug dealers
have begun to advertise the quality of their product and its easy
availability using business cards, police said.
   ``Their business cards say how good (the drugs) are and that
they want a nice quick transaction,'' said Lt. Michael Geraghty,
head of the Tactical Narcotics Team in southeast Queens.
   ``Most of the time the cards say what they are selling and where
and when it can be bought. Some of the cards have telephone
numbers.''
   Police Commissioner Benjamin Ward, at a luncheon interview
Thursday at the New York Post, also displayed a flier that exhorts
``kids'' to ``earn big bucks'' by becoming ``Crack-er Jack
Salesman.'' He noted, however, that the flier might be bogus.
   Ward appealed for support for a plan to create five more
Tactical Narcotics Teams to spread throughout the city. Mayor
Edward I. Koch is asking for $110 million for his plan to crack
down on drugs.
   The Queens team was formed after the execution-style killing of
rookie Officer Edward Byrne in February as he guarded the home of a
drug-case witness.

<HEAD>Irving Mansfield, Husband of Jacqueline Susann, Dead at 80</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Irving Mansfield, a publicist and television
producer who was best known as the husband of the late novelist
Jacqueline Susann, has died at age 80.
   Mansfield died Thursday at his Manhattan home after suffering a
heart attack, according to his family.
   Mansfield's best client was his wife, who wrote a series of sexy
best-sellers, including ``Valley of the Dolls,'' ``The Love
Machine'' and ``Once is not Enough.'' Ms. Susann died of cancer in
1974 at age 53.
   Before deciding in 1965 to devote himself to Ms. Susann's
career, Mansfield produced numerous television programs, including
ones starring Arthur Godfrey and Judy Garland. Later, he was
executive producer of the television mini-series production of
``Valley of the Dolls.''
   In 1983, Mansfield wrote ``Life with Jackie'' about his 35-year
marriage to Ms. Susann.
   ``Our lives were remarkably similar,'' he wrote. ``We both
wanted to be someone. We wanted to stand out from the crowd, lead
remarkable lives and be surrounded by people of talent and
accomplishment.''
   Stuart Applebaum, head of publicity at Bantam Books, said
Mansfield ``popularized what is now a staple of book promotion
efforts, the author tour.''
   ``Jackie became probably the most famous author of our time
because she was one of the first to use mass media, especially
television, to reach potential consumers,'' Applebaum added.
   Ms. Susann appeared frequently on ``The Tonight Show,'' as well
as game shows, sometimes in the company of her husband.
   Mansfield is survived by his second wife, Beverly, whom he
married in 1983, and a son, Guy.
   A funeral service was scheduled for noon Sunday at Riverside
Chapel in Manhattan.

   A commuter railroad train rammed into a
tractor-trailer stuck at a crossing in this New York City suburb
and derailed, slightly injuring 18 of the 40 people aboard,
authorities said.
   The truck's driver waved in a frantic attempt to warn the
westbound Long Island Rail Road train's engineer, but stood clear
as the locomotive slammed into his truck Thursday evening,
witnesses said.
   ``It just pushed the trailer right on its side,'' said Bob
Morgan, who was working nearby.
   LIRR spokesman Mike Charles, asked if the train's engineer had
seen the driver waving, said the accident was being investigated.
   The locomotive flipped on its side and into a lumberyard next to
the tracks and five passenger coaches derailed, said Susan McGowan,
a railroad spokeswoman. The only part of the train left on the
tracks was a rear engine car.
   Two cars on a siding also derailed when they were sideswiped.
   The injured, who suffered sprains and minor cuts, were treated
at Huntington Hospital, said hospital administrator Ronald
Gaudreualt.
   No regular train service was scheduled today on the LIRR branch
from Huntington to Port Jefferson about 20 miles to the east.

<HEAD>Green Drops Charges Against Tyson</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Boxer Mitch Green has dropped assault charges
against world heavyweight boxing champ Mike Tyson stemming from a
scuffle outside a clothing store, saying he hopes they will settle
their differences in the ring.
   Green arrived at a Harlem precinct with his lawyer David Lee on
Thursday, told police ``I'm dropping the charges,'' and left
without giving a reason for his decision, said a police spokesman,
Sgt. John Clifford.
   But outside the station, Green taunted Tyson, chanting ``Sissy,
Sissy,'' as he was booed by a pro-Tyson neighborhood crowd.
   Green, who once fought for the U.S. Boxing Association
heavyweight title and lost in the ring to Tyson two years ago, told
police Tyson knocked him down with a punch during a pre-dawn
scuffle Tuesday outside a Harlem haberdashery.
   ``Mike Tyson hit me and ran like a sissy,'' he told reporters
during a news conference, adding that Tyson hit him after he told
the champ he did not fight hard in their 1986 bout because he had
been cheated by promoter Don King.
   Tyson's description, issued a few hours later, was equally
succinct: ``He hit me first, I hit back and the fight was over ...
faster than Spinks,'' a reference to Tyson's first-round knockout
of Michael Spinks earlier this year.
   Tyson fractured a bone in his hand when he hit Green, placing in
jeopardy his title defense against Britain's Frank Bruno, scheduled
for Oct. 8.
   In his statement, Tyson dismissed Green as ``a punk and a true
coward'' who filed a criminal complaint as ``a publicity stunt.''
   ``I can beat this guy anytime, anywhere, any place,'' Tyson
boasted. ``I will teach him a lesson in the ring that he should
have learned already.''
   But first, he said, Green would have to survive ``some good
tough preliminary fights so that he's ranked again.''
   Tyson's manager Bill Cayton said a rematch would be ``absolutely
a very attractive fight.''
   Cayton told the Daily News that Green, paid just $30,000 to
Tyson's $250,000 despite a higher ranking at the time, ``deserves a
break.''
   In August 1987, Green was arrested after police found drugs in
his car and that his license had been suspended 54 times. A week
later, he was arrested and charged with disorderly conduct and
driving while intoxicated after he refused to pay a bridge toll.

<HEAD>Mayor Asks Judge To Order City Council To Certify Election Results</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SELMA, Ala. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mayor Joe Smitherman, accused by blacks of
being a ``dictator'' after his apparent re-election to an
unprecedented seventh term, has sued the council in this civil
rights landmark city for failing to certify his victory.
   Smitherman asked Dallas County Circuit Judge Charles Thigpen on
Thursday to order the council to certify the election so candidates
for seven contested council seats can begin campaigning.
   The judge scheduled a Monday hearing on the suit.
   The controversy over the mayor's race erupted Wednesday when the
council's three black members _ including Cleophus Mann, who is
seeking to become Selma's first black mayor _ voted against
certifying Tuesday's election results, which appeared to return
Smitherman to office without a runoff. The three white council
members voted for certification.
   ``We might as well have been in Panama,'' said Mann. ``We sit
around and let a dictator run things.''
   After the meeting, Mann almost came to blows with city attorney
Henry Pitts. One of Mann's campaign aides and another man were
arrested on charges of disorderly conduct.
   Attorney J.L. Chestnut, who represents two of the three black
council members, said he doubts Thigpen has the authority to force
elected officials to certify the election.
   ``This is a racially polarized city,'' Chestnut said of the
community of 27,000. ``There is absolutely no sentiment in black
Selma to certify any election.''
   ``This is one of the worst incidents I've seen since 1964,''
said Smitherman, referring to the start of civil rights protests
that marked his first year as mayor.
   On March 7, 1965, several hundred civil rights activists began a
50-mile voting rights march to Montgomery. State troopers and
sheriff's deputies, acting under orders from Gov. George Wallace,
beat marchers as they tried to cross the Edmund Pettus Bridge.
Television film of the beatings shocked the nation.
   Unofficial city results showed Smitherman defeating Mann by
3,752 votes to 2,769. A third candidate, Coy Darby, had 453 votes.
   If the results are upheld, Smitherman would not face a runoff
because he received more than half the vote.
   A second council meeting held Wednesday afternoon was boycotted
by the three black members. Without a quorum, no action could be
taken.
   Beverly Mitchell, a Mann aide, said Mann heard of numerous
irregularities in the election, including a predominantly black
precinct where polls opened 20 minutes late and had no official
poll workers for hours.
   Also, she claimed, city officials posted voter rolls only 10
days before the election while the requirement is 30 days. Ms.
Mitchell said Police Chief Melvin Summerlin intimidated people by
showing up at several polling places and asking workers ``if they
knew what they were doing.''
   Smitherman, a one-time segregationist, defeated another black
challenger in 1984 and took about 20 percent of the black vote. At
the 20th anniversary of the 1965 voting rights march, Smitherman
joined black leaders at the observance and, at one point, shared a
hymnal with Jesse Jackson and joined him in singing ``The Battle
Hymn of the Republic.''
   A policeman was stationed in front of Smitherman's office and
extra patrols were scheduled for his residence after Wednesday's
confrontations.

   For seven summers, International Zucchini
Festival aficionados have converged on southwest New Hampshire to
sing the praises of their favorite squash.
   But the zucchini fest has lost some of its zest, say fans of the
cucumber look-alike. Saturday's event at Keene State College here
will be the last, Zucchini Central Committee member Cindy Thomashow
announced this week.
   ``Seven years is a long time, and it's been great fun,'' said
Thomashow, whose committee organizes the festival. ``We want to
have more fun at this one than we've ever had before.''
   Fittingly, the Olympics are this year's theme for the fund
raiser. Events will include a zucchini toss, javelin throw _ and
zucchini rap contest. Individual vegetables will be awarded such
high honors as ``most international zucchini,'' ``best-dressed
zucchini,'' and ``best zucchini Olympic pet.''
   The festival is held to raise money for the private Harrisville
School, the Harrisville Children's Center and the Grand Monadnock
Arts Council.
   John Colony, who founded the event with his wife, said he's
amazed the festival lasted this long.
   ``When my wife and I thought of the idea, we thought it would go
one for two or three years,'' he said. ``If you're working on it
every year, it gets kind of tiresome. It's like telling the same
joke over and over.''

   The bride wore blue and carried a
revolver. So did the groom.
   Police officers Cassie Darnell and Mark Alley passed up the
traditional gown and tuxedo for a short wedding ceremony Wednesday
in district court.
   Instead, the off-duty officers exchanged vows before Magistrate
Krista Krause in their uniforms, complete with service revolvers.
   They aren't partners, but work the same shift.
   ``We just have a lot in common and understand what the other has
gone through,'' Darnell said before the ceremony. ``Before we
started dating, Mark said he would never marry another police
officer.''
   They dated for about a year, and Alley eventually changed his
mind. All he could say Wednesday was, ``I'm very happy.''
   More than 30 people attended the ceremony, including 15 or so
police officers.
   The couple exchanged vows under the bright lights of television
cameras. Alley blushed when instead of saying ``I pledge my faith
unto you,'' he said, ``I pledge my faith on TV.''
   He got it right the second time.

<HEAD>Botha Welcomed In Black Settlement Once Targeted For Demolition</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDS: UPDATES thruout with Botha visit. No pickup.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By LAURINDA KEYS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CROSSROADS, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Since it mushroomed overnight on
Easter 1974, this black shantytown has been visited regularly by
police, bulldozers and eviction agents.
   Today, in what aides called a symbolic move, President P.W.
Botha visited the settlement outside Cape Town that his government
tried so many times to destroy.
   Each time, the shacks of plastic sheeting and corrugated tin
were smashed. Each time, they reappeared in a different sandy
field. Each time, truckloads of women and children were carted away
to rural homelands, separated from the men who had jobs in Cape
Town. Thousands more families replaced them.
   Botha, making one of his few visits to a black township in his
10 years as South Africa's head of state, was loudly cheered when
he arrived at the long-troubled area that the government is now
trying to develop for blacks who fought anti-apartheid activists.
   ``Thank you, we accept you as our leader,'' a black choir sang
in the Xhosa language.
   The group said they made up the song for Botha's visit to
Crossroads, where dozens of people were killed and 70,000 people
left homeless during unrest in May and June of 1986.
   Botha stopped at a recently established employment center, where
appointed Mayor Johnson Ngxobongwana welcomed the president ``in
the name of all Crossroads residents.''
   Not everyone was happy about Botha's visit. Jan van Eck, an
anti-apartheid member of Parliament, said of Crossroads, ``The
black community that rejects an Archbishop (Desmond) Tutu and
accepts into its midst the oppressor, Mr. P.W. Botha, is far
removed from the rest of the oppressed people of South Africa.''
   He was referring to graffiti on a wall near the main entrance to
Crossroads that says: ``No entry for Tutu'' _ the black Anglican
leader who won the 1984 Nobel Peace Prize for his fight against
apartheid, under which the black majority has no voice in national
affairs.
   Mayor Ngxobongwana headed so-called vigilantes from the oldest
section of Crossroads who burned down neighborhoods in 1986 where
militant young anti-apartheid activists held sway.
   The government is building new homes for Ngxobongwana's
supporters, while most of his displaced opponents have moved where
the government wanted them _ a massive black township called
Khayelitsha, farther from Cape Town.
   Botha said the employment center was an example of his
government's attempts to develop black areas.
   ``To boycott is easy, but it leads nowhere,'' Botha told about
200 people in the center. ``To cooperate is sometimes difficult and
to take responsibility sometimes difficult. But history remembers
only those who build, not those who destroy.''
   The center is used to train unemployed people in carpentry,
bricklaying, sewing and other skills.
   The shantytown's troubled history centers around the
white-dominated government's former policy that people of
mixed-race had preference over blacks for all jobs in the Cape Town
region and that blacks lived there only as temporary workers.
   Crossroads was born as a result of the government's attempt to
remove several ``black spots,'' where blacks lived illegally.
   When three such areas were demolished in 1974, residents packed
their few possessions and moved, but only as far as an intersection
near Cape Town's airport.
   By 1976, Crossroads was a squatter city of 60,000 people, and
the government declared it an ``emergency camp.'' Subsequent
demolitions and evictions failed to stem its growth.
   In 1984, Botha abandoned the idea that the Cape should be a
job-preference area for mixed-race people and promised a halt to
forced removals for race separation purposes.
   By 1986, an estimated 200,000 blacks were living in Crossroads'
slums.
   But during a four-week period in May and June that year, battles
broke out between factions in different neighborhoods. Scores of
people died, and 70,000 were burned out of their shacks.
   Residents and community workers said police aided the so-called
vigilantes from the oldest section of Crossroads, who burned down
neighborhoods where militant young anti-apartheid activists lived.
   Critics charged that the 1986 violence was part of a government
plan to clear out overcrowded slums so they could be rebuilt with
lower density while troublemakers were moved farther away.
   The Cape Town Supreme Court is hearing the first of more than
3,000 damage suits by those who lost their homes. They charge the
police and government with responsibilty.

<TEXT>
   About 300 leftist guerrillas destroyed a
military base and police headquarters in a village attack that
killed 39 people, the deadliest raid by guerrillas in several
years, the Defense Ministry said.
   A ministry statement said Thursday that 15 guerrillas, 12
civilians, 10 soldiers and two policemen were killed. At least 10
civilians and soldiers were wounded and an unknown number were
missing after Wednesday's raid, the communique said.
   The Defense Ministry said the rebels from the Maoist People's
Liberation Army and the pro-Soviet Colombian Revolutionary Armed
Forces ambushed two security force patrols outside Saisa, a village
of 1,200 residents about 250 miles north of Bogota.
   Ten soldiers and two policemen died, the ministry said.
   Civilians in Saisa joined 15 soldiers that remained in the
village to battle the guerrillas for four hours. The battle left 15
guerrillas and 12 civilians dead, the statement said.
   The statement said civilian victims of the guerrilla attack
included a woman and her two small children who were burned alive.
   The ministry said reinforcements were sent Thursday to the area
but it was not immediately known if there was any new fighting.
   The attacks came as armed groups and the government of President
Virgilio Barco made moves to begin a new peace process. Guerrillas
have been fighting to overthrow Colombia's government for 30 years.

   Mechanics joined hundreds of other workers
on strike at a steel mill in southeastern Poland, and police backed
off after staging a massive show of force around a strikebound coal
mine, labor leaders said today.
   Poland's powerful Roman Catholic bishops urged the government to
renounce force in settling strikes around the country and
reiterated their stand that the government should allow free trade
unions _ a key demand of strikers.
   Ewa Kuberna, a spokeswoman for the outlawed Solidarity free
trade union, said about 3,000 workers were occupying the Stalowa
Wola steel mill. She said the mechanics joined other strikers late
Thursday and that the mill was shut down.
   Workers arriving for the first shift today were turned away by
management, Kuberna said.
   In the coal mining region of Silesia, police briefly surrounded
the July Manifesto mine near Jastrzebie late Thursday, Solidarity
activists said. Robert Kozak, a Solidarity spokesman in Warsaw,
said about 100 police vehicles, some equipped with water cannons,
surrounded the mine where a strike spawned Poland's worst labor
unrest since 1981.
   Kozak said police drove up to the main gate and turned flood
lights on the compound, which has been occupied by strikers for 11
days.
   He said security forces made no attempt to enter the mine, where
an estimated 600 workers remained holed up. Police left a short
time later, Kozak said.
   ``Intimidation and force must be abandoned, and the reasonable
voice of all the citizens of the country must be loyally
acknowledged,'' the bishops said in their first statement on the
strikes that began Aug. 16.
   They implicitly criticized the government for not meeting
agreements signed with workers during the 1981 unrest, saying ``The
social accords signed eight years ago and developed with such
difficulty remain a task to be fulfilled.''
   Earlier Thursday, three strikes crumbled in Silesia and steel
workers gave up an on-again, off-again strike in the Nowa Huta
steel mill outside Krakow.
   Strikes continued along Poland's Baltic coast, in the major
ports of Gdansk and Szczecin, and at least two coal mines, in
addition to July Manifesto, remained crippled by strikes.
   The strikers are demanding legalization of the Solidarity trade
union federation and better wages.
   An 11 p.m. to 5 a.m. curfew was in effect in Jastrzebie, at the
heart of the coal mine strikes. Provincial officials decreed
Thursday that non-residents were not permitted in the town.
   One strike committee member said riot police beat at least six
miners when they forced strikers to evacuate three paralyzed mines
Wednesday night, including the Borynia mine in Jastrzebie and the
Morcinek mine in nearby Kaszyce.
   But at least 20 people remained barricaded underground at the
third mine, the Mosczenica, witnesses said.
   The state news agency PAP said strikes ended Thursday at three
other shafts _ the Krupinski, ZMP and First of May.
   Strikes continued in only three mines, down from 12 at the
beginning of this week. Still strikebound were the July Manifesto,
Jastrzebie and 30 Years of People's Poland mines, the first to
declare strikes.
   The Gdansk port, the country's busiest, remained totally shut
down, according to reporters. But the state-controlled media said
parts of the port were working.
   Gdansk's port director issued an ultimatum that dockworkers
would be fired unless they signed statements that they are not on
strike.
   At the 30,000-worker Nowa Huta steel mill, workers who tried to
start a strike Wednesday idled various departments for 24 hours.
The last strikers gave up Thursday afternoon, said Stanislaw
Handzlik, a member of the plant's Solidarity organizing committee.
   Tentative talks began Thursday at the strikebound Szczecin port
between a strike committee and management.
   But Jozef Kowalczyk, a spokesman for the strikers, complained
that even while talks were going on, two ships containing security
troops menaced the dockworkers by sailing near the docks, although
the troops didn't land.
   Official accounts made no mention of a police role in ending any
strike, saying only that strikers gave up and reporting
preparations to restart work.
   Francinek Cichon, a member of the Morcinek strike committee,
said six men at Borynia were beaten as well as men at Morcinek, but
that no strikers needed hospitalization. There were some
detentions, he said.
   Also Thursday, U.S. congressional staffer Michael Hammond
announced that the Congress would soon approve a $1 million grant
to help Solidarity, which was outlawed by the Polish government in
1982.
   Hammond was in Krakow, at a gathering of more than 600 activists
from East and West who came together for an unofficial human rights
conference.
   Hammond, general counsel to the Senate Steering Committee, which
does research and provides support for Conservative members of the
chamber, said the United States already has provided two such
grants to Solidarity.

   An unidentified driver abandoned an
explosive-laden car near a U.N. peacekeeping checkpoint in south
Lebanon today and surrendered to Israeli-allied militiamen,
security sources said.
   A source said the driver surrendered to the Israeli-backed South
Lebanon Army militia shortly after parking the red Renault car near
a checkpoint manned by Fijian peacekeepers of the U.N. Interim
Force in Lebanon.
   The source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the driver
turned himself in to authorities on the northern edge of Israel's
self-proclaimed security zone. He did not elaborate.
   A UNIFIL spokesman said Fijian soldiers found the car rigged
with ``a quantity of explosives'' within yards of the Fijian
checkpoint, five miles south of this southern port city. He spoke
on condition of anonymity.
   He said UNIFIL's Swedish engineers would safely detonate the car
later in the day.
   A Lebanese car exploded near an Israeli army jeep in south
Lebanon on Aug. 19, killing its driver and a passenger and slightly
wounding three Israeli servicemen.
   A military source in Jerusalem said the car, also a Renault,
exploded about 40 yards from the jeep. He said it was not clear
whether the car was rigged with explosives or hit a mine.

   The heaviest rainfall in 20 years
has drenched much of West Africa, causing widespread damage and at
least 50 deaths, officials say.
   The Sahel states, impoverished nations on the southern fringe of
the Sahara Desert that have suffered recurring droughts for most of
the last 20 years, have received the heaviest rainfall, said Benoi
Cortier of AGHRY-Met, an agricultural research center in the Niger
capital of Niamey.
   Cortier, interviewed by telephone, said Thursday that the
rainfall zone extends from Mauritania along the West African coast
more than 2,400 miles to the Congo. It also stretches as far inland
to Chad, he said.
   Cortier said despite the damage caused by the rainfall that the
region should generally have a better harvest year than in recent
years.
   Since the rainy season began in June, the most rainfall in the
region was reported at a station in Guinea-Bissau, which received
56 inches. Most of the Sahel nations have received more than their
annual average rainfall the past three months.
   Niger, for example, received 27.4 inches, compared with an
annual average 22.4 inches. Rainfall in Nigeria this month was the
heaviest since 1928, the Ministry of Water Resources said.
   The Niger River overflowed, blocking many roads and leaving many
villages isolated. The only feasible transport in some areas was
the pirogue, a canoe-shaped boat.
   Nigeria reported the most damage in West Africa, with thousands
of homes destroyed in Kano and Borno states in the country's
northeast. More than 300,000 people were made homeless, the
military government said.
   The News Agency of Nigeria reported up to 50 deaths in Kano in
the first week of August and 26 deaths the following week in Borno
state.
   Chad reported eight deaths and 48 people injured when their
houses collapsed Tuesday in the capital N'djamena. Homes also were
destroyed in Ouninga Kebir, in the desert north near Libya.
Cameroon reported 1,000 homeless after heavy rains this week. It
had reported two deaths after torrential rains a week earlier.
Burkina Faso also has reported several deaths.
   Heavy rains also were reported in Timbuktu in Mali and in parts
of Senegal.

   Three street-preaching youngsters who have
been repeatedly suspended from school for shouting sermons will be
taught at home and have agreed to no longer preach on school
grounds, officials say.
   The Strode children _ Duffey, 11, Pepper, 7 and Matthew, 6 _
left Eastfield Elementary School this week to begin home
instruction, after another confrontation the first day of school.
Each had been suspended five times last spring for shouting Bible
verses outside school or for refusing to enter the building.
   Their father, David Stode, had said Wednesday they would
continue to preach at school despite the agreement to have them
taught at home. But after four hours of negotiations Wednesday
night, McDowell County school Superintendent David Ricketts
announced a new agreement.
   ``We have reached a new level of trust and understanding,''
Ricketts said. ``The Strodes have agreed not to preach or disturb
our schools, not even to preach at ball games.''
   In return, Ricketts said, school officials have dropped attempts
to get Strode to sign a release absolving the schools from
litigation.
   ``They have no desire to sue us and we certainly have no desire
to sue them,'' Ricketts said.
   Barry Weaver of Black Mountain, who has been street preaching
with Strode, took part in the negotiations.
   ``I said ... `You got to understand me and Dave. When we look at
you, we don't see lawyer and Ricketts. We see the Devil,''' Weaver
said. ```Everything we deal with has to be in that Bible. If it
ain't in the Bible, it don't exist. So Dave ain't gonna sign your
paper. But just leave him alone, let him teach his kids at home and
everything will work out fine.' And that was it.''

<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A black union organizer
detained without charge for 26 months died in a hospital today,
three days after collapsing in his prison cell, police said.
   The Congress of South African Trade Unions, the country's
largest black labor federation, demanded authorities explain the
circumstances surrounding the death of Alfred Makeleng and said its
lawyers were investigating.
   Makeleng, 27, was detained June 12, 1986 _ the day President
P.W. Botha declared a state of emergency that remains in effect. An
estimated 30,000 people have been detained without charge for
varying periods during the emergency, and five are known to have
died in custody.
   Police said Makeleng had complained of repeated headaches and
was treated by doctors at the Nylstroom Prison near the northern
town of Pietersburg.
   His condition ``suddenly deteriorated'' Tuesday and he was taken
first to a local hospital and then airlifted to Johannesburg
Hospital.
   The trade union congress said Makeleng had a ``mass of water on
the brain'' and was on a life support system at the time of his
death.
   Makeleng was an organizer for the South African Allied Workers
Union and worked as a publicity secretary for the United Democratic
Front, the country's largest anti-apartheid coalition.
   He was never charged with a crime and had not been questioned by
police in more than a year, according to his attorney, Nicholas
Hayson.
   ``Our lawyers are investigating the full circumstances and we
demand a full explanation from prison authorities and security
police,'' the union congress said. ``This tragedy once again
reflects the precarious position of detainees and counts as a grim
reminder of the basic inhumanity of detention.''
   The state-of-emergency regulations restrict reporting about
unrest, security force actions, treatment of detainees, some forms
of protest, and a broad range of statements the government
considers subversive. Enforcement of the regulations has not been
comprehensive.

   Ten Soviet experts today began inspecting
the U.S. cruise missile base in Sicily under the superpower treaty
to eliminate medium- and shorter-range nuclear weapons, U.S. and
Italian officials said.
   The Soviet inspectors, who arrived in Rome on Wednesday, flew by
U.S. military aircraft to the air base in Sigonella, then traveled
by helicopter to the Comiso missile base on the southeastern edge
of the island.
   U.S. and Italian officials say 112 Tomahawk cruise missiles are
deployed in Comiso.
   Under the treaty, the Soviets have 24 hours to inspect the
missiles, launchers and related equipment at the base. They can
request an eight-hour extension, which U.S. officials can grant or
refuse.
   The Soviets were escorted by 11 American officials and four
Italian representatives. The Soviet team was led by Gennadiy
Mikhailovich, while the Americans were headed by Col. John Fer,
chief of the on-site inspection agency in Europe.
   Comiso is the last American missile base to be visited by the
Soviets in the two-month inspection period ending at midnight Aug.
29. They have inspected bases in West Germany, Belgium, Britain and
the Netherlands.
   The treaty, signed in December, calls for the elimination within
three years of all U.S. and Soviet land-based missiels with ranges
from 300 to 3,000 miles.

   A TRW Inc. official apologized for the
company's role in a defense fraud case after the company paid a $3
million penalty for conspiring to overcharge the government for
military aircraft and M-1 tank parts.
   ``TRW as a company deeply regretted that the events occurred. We
have taken steps to try and prevent a recurrence of those
incidents,'' William B. Lawrence, TRW vice president and assistant
secretary, said Thursday outside U.S. District Court.
   Minutes earlier, Lawrence had waived the company's right to a
trial and entered a guilty plea on its behalf before Judge George
W. White.
   The combined fine and criminal penalty was one of the largest
ever assessed against a defense contractor, according to U.S.
Attorney Patrick McLaughlin.
   Four former TRW employees pleaded guilty earlier to conspiring
to defraud the government, and a fifth is to be tried Sept. 6 on
charges of conspiracy and making false statements, McLaughlin said.
   Lawrence said the conspiracy was limited to low-level managers.
   The company also paid a separate $3 million to be applied as an
advance payment on restitution to the U.S. Department of Defense,
Lawrence said. The money brings to $11.8 million the amount TRW has
given the government to settle a pending civil lawsuit.
   TRW estimates its Compressor Components Division overcharged the
government between $3 million and $11 million, Lawrence said. The
company sold the Compressor Components Division in 1986 as part of
a corporate restructuring.
   Lawrence said he did not expect Thursday's settlement to affect
other TRW defense contracts or attempts to bid for additional
defense work.
   TRW pleaded guilty Thursday to conspiring between 1973 and 1984
to inflate labor expenses for the manufacture of military aircraft
engine parts. The company also admitted it had conspired to inflate
labor costs on compressor fan blades for the M-1 tank between 1980
and 1984.
   The third count accused the company of conspiring to charge the
Defense Department for operations and labor never performed in the
manufacture of blades for the J-79 aircraft engine.
   The guilty plea concludes a federal investigation that began in
1984, when TRW voluntarily disclosed that its employees had engaged
in questionable conduct, McLaughlin said.

   The owner of an illegally operated Bronx social
club was arrested after a four-day search and charged with
manslaughter and assault in connection with a fire that killed six
people and injured 33, police said.
   The fire Sunday burned out the basement club, known as The Hole,
which officials say served liquor without a license and didn't have
enough exits to comply with building codes.
   Although arson was initially suspected, the Fire Department
later said the fire appeared to be accidental.
   Domingo Reyes, 37, the owner and operator of the club, was
arrested at a pay phone in Manhattan at 6:30 p.m. Thursday after
police traced a 45-minute call he made to the 46th Precinct, said
police spokesman Sgt. Maurice Howard.
   He was charged with six counts of second-degree manslaughter and
40 counts of assault for every person who was in the club at the
time of the fire, Howard said.

   Radio Shack is recalling outlet adapters, sold
since 1987 for use in operating electrical appliances overseas,
because the adapters may pose a shock hazard, the Consumer Product
Safety Commission reports.
   The adapters allow a voltage converter to be plugged into
foreign electrical outlets, allowing the use of American appliances
on foreign electrical systems.
   However, the adapters can separate from the base when pulled
from an outlet, exposing the user to possible electrical shock, the
safety commission said.
   Sets of four adapters were sold nationally under the ``Archer''
brand name for $7.95. Owners were urged to discontinue use of the
adapters and return them to any Radio Shack store for a refund.
   People needing more information can contact the commission at
1-800-638-2772.

<TEXT>
   Citing freedom of expression, the
California Supreme Court has barred the use of pandering laws to
prosecute a filmmaker whose cast performed sex acts on camera.
   The prosecution under pandering laws, which forbid the procuring
of prostitutes for pay, ``must be viewed as a somewhat transparent
`end run' around the First Amendment and the state obscenity
laws,'' Justice Marcus Kaufman said in Thursday's unanimous
decision.
   He also said pandering laws, if allowed in such cases and
applied to their limits, could be used against ``films of
unquestioned artistic and social merit, as well as films made for
medical or educational purposes.''
   Only a handful of pending prosecutions were directly affected by
the case. But lawyers said prosecutors in several counties were
following the ruling closely and would have been prepared to file
similar charges against local sex-film makers if the court had
allowed it.
   ``If they couldn't get a conviction under the obscenity section,
this (pandering) was the only thing left,'' said Stuart Goldfarb, a
lawyer for producer Harold Freeman, the defendant in the case. He
said there had been no attempt to prove that Freeman's movie,
``Caught from Behind, Part II,'' was obscene.
   Freeman was convicted of pandering for paying the cast in the
September 1983 movie to engage in sexual acts on film. Although the
pandering law requires at least a three-year prison sentence, the
judge said prison was unwarranted in Freeman's case and gave him 90
days in jail; that sentence, challenged by the prosecutor, was
never served.
   Kaufman gave two reasons for overturning the conviction:
Freeman's conduct was not covered by the pandering laws; and, if
the laws had applied, they would be unconstitutional in his case.
   The cast of the film was paid for acting, and not for ``sexual
arousal or gratification,'' so they were not prostitutes and
Freeman's hiring of them was not pandering, Kaufman said.

   A small plane that crashed into a
shopping center, killing three people and igniting a fire that
destroyed four stores, had been unable to gain altitude after
taking off, an investigator said.
   ``He didn't get very high, maybe 100 to 150 feet at the most,''
said Bruce Hill, an accident investigator with the National
Transportation Safety Board.
   The twin-engine Piper Aerostar broke through the roof of a print
shop Thursday afternoon and sent workers and passers-by fleeing.
One worker in the rear of the shop suffered severe burns and was in
critical condition today.
   According to witnesses and FAA reports, the six-seat plane
piloted by Lewis E. Phillips of Fort Lauderdale took off about 3:30
p.m. and circled several times before clipping power lines and
plunging into the strip shopping plaza, about a mile from the
runway.
   Phillips died in the crash; police did not immediately release
the names of the two passengers killed. All three victims were
burned beyond recognition, said police Lt. Tom Walsh.
   Damage to the shopping center was estimated at about $1 million.
   Residents and officials called for a probe into safety at North
Perry Airport, which is surrounded by densely populated
neighborhoods in this community 15 miles north of Miami. Four
people were killed in 16 collisions linked to the airport since
1982, not counting Thursday's crash.
   FAA spokesman Charles Wright in Atlanta said no flight plan was
filed and the plane's destination was unknown.

<TEXT>
   A former U.S. Army sergeant who
allegedly led an international spy ring sold the Soviets secret
documents on nuclear missile bases, military pipelines and NATO
troop strength, news reports said today.
   The Bild newspaper of Hamburg, which is known to have close
contacts to intelligence sources, quoted an unidentified West
German security official as saying Clyde Lee Conrad had sold
``extraordinarily important information.''
   A special Supreme Court panel ordered Conrad held in prison
pending further investigation following his arrest Tuesday. He was
charged with ``compelling suspicion of espionage activities in an
especially grave case,'' according to the prosecutor's office.
   Two men who officials said were part of the ring were arraigned
today in Sweden.
   Kurt Rebmann, the chief federal prosecutor, said Conrad also
recruited a second American soldier who received a ``five-figure
sum'' of money for supplying the ring with military secrets.
Rebmann refused to elaborate.
   Bild said information contained in documents that Conrad
allegedly sold included ``secret locations of nuclear missiles,
classified documents about pipeline systems, defense plans of NATO
and of U.S. divisions, and top-secret troop mobilization plans.''
   West Germany's ARD television network and The New York Times
also reported that such information was sold by the ring, which
allegedly had been operating since the late 1970s.
   The Times quoted U.S. and German officials as saying Conrad
guarded a safe that stored documents at the U.S. Army base in Bad
Kreuznach in central West Germany.
   Bild said Conrad lived in an elegantly furnished apartment near
the base.
   Officials have said the ring was believed to have stolen
documents concerning NATO defense plans for Europe and U.S. Army
contingency plans for a ground war with the Soviet Union in Europe.
   Alexander Prechtel, a spokesman for the federal prosecutor's
office, said Thursday that it's too early to determine what damage
the spying caused the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.
   ``We can't exclude the possibility that millions of dollars are
involved,'' he said.
   ``It could take months before we know the full extent of the
damage to NATO defenses,'' he added. He refused to release any
further details about the probe.
   In Goteborg, Sweden, a district court today arraigned two
Hungarian-born brothers, who Prechtel said were part of the ring.
Chief Prosecutor Sven-Olof Hakansson said the men, arrested
Tuesday, acknowledged working for the Hungarian intelligence
service.
   Security officials said Sandor Kercsik, 48, and Imre Kercsik,
34, were suspected of ``preparing unlawful intellegence activity
and supporting preparations of criminal acts.''
   A third suspect, the wife of one of the brothers, was detained
for questioning and released. Her arraignment was not immediately
sought.
   A U.S. Justice Department official, speaking on condition of
anonymity, called the spy case ``a serious encroachment on our
national security.''
   Army records released in Washington said Conrad, of Sebring,
Ohio, was born in 1947 and worked for the U.S. military for 20
years, first as an infantryman and then as an ``administration
specialist.''
   According to his service records, Conrad received the National
Defense Service Medal, the Vietnam Service Medal, five Army
Commendation medals, the Army Achievement Medal, three Meritorious
Service medals and seven Good Conduct medals.
   Prechtel said Conrad worked with classified military defense
plans for seven years at the U.S. Army base in Bad Kreuznach with
access to a wide array of secret documents.
   Conrad allegedly engaged in espionage work after he left the
service in 1985, Prechtel said.
   In a statement, Rebmann alleged that Conrad had turned over the
most recent batch of information to his Soviet bloc contact in
Vienna last month.
   Rebmann said officials still were investigating to determine
exactly what was missing.
   Cable News Network on Thursday quoted unidentified West German
sources as saying Conrad systematically photographed files from
1980 to 1985. The CNN report said investigators believe he may have
transferred material onto a personal computer, which was seized at
his home.
   Prechtel said that while ``several'' people had been taken into
custody or arrested, he could not confirm a New York Times report
Thursday that eight people were rounded up.
   The Times said the network was uncovered by West German and U.S.
officials, including agents from the FBI and the Army. The Army has
about 250,000 military personnel in West Germany at more than 200
installations and frequently warns its personnel to beware of
Soviet bloc spies.

   The city of Pontiac has negotiated a
settlement for security costs incurred during Pope John Paul II's
visit to Oakland County last year, but local police departments
have yet to see any money.
   The tab for security and traffic control for the papal Mass at
the Pontiac Silverdome Sept. 19 was almost $50,000.
   Police from Pontiac, Auburn Hills, Waterford Township and
Bloomfield Township provided security for the Mass, attended by
90,000 people.
   In a settlement negotiated between the city of Pontiac and the
Pontiac Stadium Building Authority, each police department will be
paid half the cost of services, Pontiac Police Chief Reginald
Turner said.
   The partial payments were reasonable because of the stadium's
``economic hardship,'' Turner said.
   Other than Pontiac, none of the communities that provided police
protection was included in the negotiations, and Turner said he
still needs to contact each department concerning the settlement.
   ``The Archdiocese (of Detroit) originally committed to pay for
reasonable security costs,'' he said. ``The stadium did not collect
from the archdiocese _ the sponsor of the event.''
   The church never promised to repay the police for security or
traffic costs, said Jay Berman, spokesman for the archdiocese,
adding that the protection would be provided for any visiting head
of state.

   A jury resumed deliberations today on
racketeering charges against 20 men in what authorities call the
nation's longest federal criminal trial, which has had more than a
year of testimony and evidence.
   Prosecutors charge the defendants constituted the hierarchy of
the New Jersey faction of the Lucchese organized crime family. The
organization allegedly ran loan-sharking, drug-dealing, illegal
gambling and fraudulent credit card operations, the government says.
   The principal defendant is reputed crime family captain Anthony
``Tumac'' Accetturo of Hollywood, Fla., who allegedly controlled
the New Jersey faction.
   The trial, which began with jury selection in November 1986,
frequently has been characterized by courtroom outbursts, wrangling
among the attorneys and delays needed to sort problems created by
the multitude of defendants.
   That atmosphere carried over to the first day of deliberations
Thursday, when the jury asked its first question just 10 minutes
after beginning work, asking for a copy of the indictment and
transcripts of opening arguments, and the lawyers began arguing
about how much should be given to the panel.
   U.S. District Judge Harold A. Ackerman rapped his gavel and
said: ``I've asked you in the nicest way, three times. Please be
quiet!''
   The jury's indictment question was resolved when lawyers learned
that the jury already had a copy of it, along with a roomful of
exhibits, but didn't know it was there.
   Two hours later, when the transcripts issue was near resolution,
the jury sent back another note: ``Cancel request.''
   All 20 defendants are named in the first count, charging a
conspiracy to violate the federal Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt
Organizations law.
   According to the Administrative Office of the Courts in
Washington, the trial is believed to be the nation's longest
federal criminal proceeding, surpassing the so-called ``Pizza
Connection'' heroin smuggling case that ended after 17 months in
March 1987.
   The trial, which yielded more than 40,000 pages of transcripts,
850 exhibits and testimony by 89 witnesses, ended 22 months and
four days after the first of 1,500 people reported to court for
jury selection.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Americans' personal incomes climbed a healthy
0.6 percent in July while consumer spending slowed from its
breakneck pace of the previous month, the government reported today.
   The Commerce Department said that the increase in incomes
matched a 0.6 percent rise in June and would have been even
stronger except for a drop in government subsidy payments to
farmers.
   Personal consumption spending, which includes virtually
everything except interest payments on debt, rose 0.5 percent in
July, less than half the 1.1 percent rise in June. The report
attributed much of the slowdown to a decline in sales of new cars.
   The slower consumer spending was seen as good news for the
economy because of worries that demand this year has been
outstripping the ability of factories to produce the goods, thus
creating rising inflationary pressures.
   The income gain looked particularly impressive because the key
component, wages and salaries, shot up 1 percent during the month,
reflecting continued strong employment gains.
   This was offset somewhat by a $9 billion rate of decline for
farm subsidy payments. Excluding these payments, which show extreme
month-to-month volatility, personal incomes would have risen 0.8
percent in July.
   Americans' disposable, or after-tax incomes, rose 0.6 percent in
July, down only slightly from a 0.7 percent June increase.
   With incomes rising slightly faster than spending, the personal
savings rate, savings as a percentage of disposable incomes, edged
up to 4.3 percent in July, compared to 4.2 percent in June.
   Following the 1.1 percent rise in spending in June, which had
been the biggest advance in 10 months, the 0.5 percent July
increase reflected gains in purchases of non-durable goods and
services.
   Non-durable goods spending rose at an annual rate of $3.5
billion compared to a $5.5 billion June increase. Purchases of
services, which includes housing costs, increased $12.2 billion
following an even stronger $18.6 billion June increase.
   But purchases of durable goods showed no change at all following
a $12 billion rise in June because sales of new cars fell during
July.

<TEXT>
   Television talk-show host Morton Downey
Jr. will not be arrested for scuffling with a weekly newspaper
editor because a prosecutor says he wants to devote his resources
to more serious crimes.
   Assistant State's Attorney Burton A. Kaplan said he rejected an
arrest warrant charging breach of peace that had been prepared by
police based on a complaint filed by Paul Bass, editor of the New
Haven Independent.
   ``I denied the warrant, not based on the merits of the case _
because I believe there was a violation by Mr. Downey _ but based
on other considerations, including the volume of business and the
resources of this office,'' Kaplan said Thursday.
   Kaplan said his staff in Superior Court can be used more
effectively tackling more serious cases such as murders, rapes and
other crimes.
   Bass said Thursday that he had mixed feelings about the decision.
   ``I understand Kaplan's need to prioritize,'' Bass said. ``The
courts are overbooked with cases. ... I'm very glad he said in his
statement that Downey broke the law.
   But, he added, ``I think it's unfortunate that some guy who's a
celebrity can get away with backing himself up with thousands of
groupies and he can get away with attacking someone. If it was a
poor black kid with three friends cheering him on, I think he would
get arrested.''
   Downey couldn't immedately be reached for comment. There was no
one on his staff at WWOR-TV in Secaucus, N.J., at work early today,
said a receptionist at the station.
   New Haven attorney Ira B. L Grudberg, who represented Downey,
said Thursday: ``Mr. Kaplan exercised his discretion wisely. There
are more important things than this, notwithstanding my client's
high visibility.''
   Downey scuffled with Bass and James Motavelli, editor of the
weekly Fairfield County Advocate, when tempers flared during a
stage show Aug. 14 at the Palace Performing Arts Center. The show
followed the confrontational format of Downey's television show.
   Bass' sister charged on stage and slapped Downey in the face
after Bass and Motavelli walked off. The standing-room-only
audience of 2,000 cheered the incident.

<HEAD>Bush Promises Jobs, Dukakis Focuses on Failed Drug Efforts</HEAD>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   George Bush promised new jobs for minorities and said during a
swing through his adopted home state that he'd be a ``good
president for all Americans,'' while rival Michael Dukakis accused
the vice president of bungling the nation's war against drugs.
   Dukakis, the Democratic presidential nominee, maintained his
code of silence on embattled Republican vice presidential candidate
Dan Quayle, who encountered fresh doubts about his resume.
   Quayle was campaigning in the Midwest trying to answer questions
on farm and trade issues when The (Cleveland) Plain Dealer reported
that he exaggerated his job record in the Indiana Attorney
General's office.
   Quayle had just begun to shed some of the questioning about his
military record and relations with a former lobbyist.
   Quayle's Senate biography, which is being distributed as
official background of the Republican vice-presidential nominee,
says: ``He was chief investigator for the Consumer Protection
Division of the Indiana Attorney General's Office from 1970-1971.''
   The Plain Dealer reported that the Consumer Protection Division
didn't even exist in 1970 and that Quayle spent most of the period
as a low-level clerk. It said he put in less than three months in
the investigator's job, and had already moved on to another job
when the division officially opened for business in September 1971.
   The new disclosure came just a few hours after Bush had declared
the controversy over his running mate to be a thing of the past.
   Campaigning in Texas with a Mariachi band and wearing a
guayaberra, Bush promised in the sweltering late-summer heat of San
Antonio ``to help those minorities who haven't really had a shot at
the starting line.''
   ``The best way to do that in employment is to have urban and
rural enterprise zones, a break in that tax structure that will
encourage business to locate where those populations are.''
   Reagan tried to create such zones on a national level in the
early part of his administration as a means to combat unemployment,
but opponents said they failed to produce results when tried on a
state level.
   Bush also said he supports affirmative action programs ``so
minorities have a better shot at the American dream,'' pledged to
fight gun control and help the faltering oil industry.
   Dukakis, returning to Boston after a Midwest sojourn, escalated
his attacks on Bush through his role in the Reagan administration.
   ``Why after seven years of task forces and policy boards and
grandiose claims have cocaine imports tripled, drug-related deaths
doubled, and heroin imports risen by 50 percent?'' he asked at a
rally in Cleveland.
   He also said the administration's association with Panamanian
leader Manuel Antonio Noriega while he was ``actively involved in
the drug business'' was ``criminal.''
   Dukakis later attended a fund-raiser in Boston, where 150 gay
rights advocates had protested a state policy they say virtually
bans placement of foster children in gay and lesbian homes. Only a
few protesters remained when he arrived.
   ``Dukakis vetoed this measure from the 1988 budget, but now that
he has become the Democratic presidential candidate, he has once
again chosen to pander to bigotry and prejudice,'' a flier said.
   Dukakis running mate Lloyd Bentsen ran into flak Thursday when
the World War II veteran pilot told a veterans' group that Dukakis
and the Democrats could be trusted with the nation's defense.
   Bentsen, wearing a VFW cap, was warmly received at the Veterans
of Foreign Wars Convention in Chicago. But in trying to make the
case for Dukakis on defense, he was interrupted four times by boos
or jeers _ once when he mentioned former President Carter's name.
   Bush, meanwhile, appeared to be softening his stance on the
Strategic Defense Initiative. The New York Times quoted the
Republican in its editions today as saying a decision on whether to
deploy a full or partial Star Wars defense system must await more
research into its capabilities and costs.
   ``What I want to do is to continue research at the levels of
funding, essentially, that we have requested,'' said Bush, who
earlier was promising deployment ``as soon as feasible.''
   In Washington, the debate over campaign debates continued. Nancy
M. Neuman, president of the League of Women Voters, said she was
encouraged that aides to Bush and Dukakis would meet next week to
begin negotiations on debates for the fall.
   Democratic chairman Paul Kirk criticized Bush for indicating on
Wednesday that he wanted to wait until at least Sept. 20 before
meeting Dukakis in debate. ``He's not going to be able to refuse to
debate,'' Kirk said.
   Republican chairman Frank Fahrenkopf said neither he nor anyone
in the Bush campaign ``agreed to a set number of debates on dates
certain or at particular locations.''

   A man opened fire on fellow Palestinians
blocking a West Bank road and wounded a 14-year-old boy, witnesses
and army officials said today.
   Another 14-year-old, Aymen Yammen, died today from a gunshot
wound he suffered Aug. 15 during clashes in the West Bank village
of Tal near Nablus, officials at Jerusalem's Mukassed Hospital said.
   His death brought to 254 the number of Palestinians killed since
the uprising began Dec. 8. Four Israelis have died.
   The army maintained curfews on six towns and refugee camps in
the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   It also closed a trade union in Arab east Jerusalem for a year,
alleging its members held meetings to initiate anti-Israeli
protests, a spokesman said. It was the 10th union to be closed
since the Arab uprising began Dec. 8.
   Meanwhile, Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir said he sees ``positive
elements'' in the Palestine Liberation Organization plan to declare
a provisional government in the occupied territories, the daily
Maariv newspaper reported.
   ``The PLO is declaring its total failure in bringing about the
destruction of Israel,'' Maariv quoted Shamir as telling aides this
week. ``It is reaching a conclusion that we should be confronted on
the political level.
   ``Secondly, the PLO's recognition of Israel, no matter inside
what borders, will influence radical Arab states and push them to
accept Israel's very existence ... and maybe to direct negotiations
with Israel,'' Shamir was quoted as saying.
   Israel's right-wing Trade and Industry Minister Ariel Sharon
rejected an upcoming U.S. review of Israel's duty-free privileges
in response to alleged abuses of Palestinian workers' rights.
   Sharon alleged Palestinian trade unions are ``cover-ups for
terror organizations. They are not innocent workers' unions but
front organizations behind which the PLO's political arm has been
hiding for years.''
   The American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee, a
pro-Palestinian lobby in Washington, has accused Israel of
indiscriminately closing down union offices, arresting Arab labor
activists and denying trade union protection to at least 100,000
Arabs in the territories who travel to jobs in Israel.
   U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter said Thursday he would
review Israel's duty-free trade status following the complaint,
which was filed in June.
   Sharon said: `We shall explain to our American friends that when
it comes to the lives of Jews, Israel would not be pressured by
economic sanctions.'' A country found to have abused worker rights
risks losing its rights to export products to the United States
free of charge under the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP).
In 1987, Israel exported $487 million worth of goods under the GSP
program.
   The shooting incident occured after youths manning the roadblock
in Ramallah attacked the Arab late Thursday because they suspected
him of collaborating with Israel, radio reports said. Only Arabs
who provide information to authorities are granted permission to
carry a weapon.
   But an Arab witness said the Arabs were arguing with the man
because he demanded to pass through their barricade.
   He said the man approached the barricade in his car, demanding
it be removed. When Arab youths refused and started to argue, ``He
just grabbed a pistol and shot the boy,'' said the witness, who
spoke on condition of anonymity.
   The clash followed three attacks on suspected collaborators in
the last two days.

   Eastman Kodak Co. has refused to honor a
second federal subpoena for information on contamination and
chemical use at a manufacturing plant because the request is too
broad, company spokesmen said.
   Kodak sent a letter Thursday to the Environmental Protection
Agency's regional headquarters in New York offering to ``sit down
and meet with them'' about the lastest subpoena, company spokesman
Paul Allen said Thursday night. ``What we need to do is find out
exactly what they want.''
   The new subpoena orders a Kodak vice president and other company
representatives to appear Tuesday before EPA officials in
Rochester. The Kodak officials were to give sworn testimony and
produce documents. The company received the subpoena Wednesday.
   Kodak earlier this month refused to honor a subpoena that
demanded documents concerning chemical spills and storage at Kodak
Park, a manufacturing area for the production of film and
photographic paper. It stretches over more than 7 miles of the city
and employs more than 30,000 people.
   The EPA action was prompted after Kodak notified the state
Department of Environmental Conservation earlier this year that its
own monitoring of groundwater had turned up low levels of
contamination at its property line. Kodak has contended that there
could be no health hazard to residents of surrounding homes because
of the low and deep levels of the contamination it found.
   The EPA, which issued the subpoenas, can ask a federal judge to
order Kodak to answer them. If ordered to comply and Kodak still
refused, the company could be held in contempt of court, EPA
spokewoman Kim Helper said.

<HEAD>Successful Test Of Shuttle Seals A `Critical Milestone' In Return
To Space</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Seals in a revamped version of the shuttle
booster joint blamed for Challenger's destruction worked in a test
firing despite intentional flaws, helping Discovery pass its ``most
significant milestone,'' the rocket's manufacturer says.
   An analysis of the Aug. 18 test at Morton Thiokol Inc.'s
northern Utah plant found that the aft seal, though the worst
flawed deliberately, succeeded in preventing superhot gases from
escaping, the company said Thursday.
   The success of the test, the fifth and final qualifying firing
of the new 126-foot solid-fuel booster, was vital to NASA's plans
to resume shuttle missions grounded since the Challenger disaster
on Jan. 28, 1986.
   ``This may be the most critical milestone as far as getting us
back into space,'' said Morton Thiokol spokesman Rocky Raab. ``It's
certainly the most significant milestone we've had to pass in the
solid rocket motor design.''
   If the positive evaluation of the test holds, NASA officials
have said they expect to set a firm date late next month or in
early October for Discovery's mission, the first shuttle flight
since the Challenger accident.
   Engineers who took apart the booster's aft segment ``looked at
the intentional flaws and were very pleased to see that hot gases
had not blown by the primary O-ring, that it had sealed properly,''
said Ed Snow, another company spokesman.
   A presidential commission blamed a faulty aft joint on one of
Challenger's two boosters for the spacecraft's explosion shortly
after liftoff. A plume of superhot gas burned through a rubber-like
O-ring in the joint and caused Challenger's outside fuel tank to
explode, killing all seven astronauts.
   Meanwhile, the FBI and NASA are investigating what appear to
have been deliberate cuts in some O-ring seals destined for use in
shuttle boosters, but none of the damaged O-rings had been shipped
to Morton Thiokol, said James Dockstader, vice president of
operations for HydraPak Inc., the West Jordan, Utah, company that
produces the O-rings.
   None of HydraPak's 85 employees has been dismissed, Dockstader
said, but he would not say if any had been disciplined.
   The redesigned joint incorporates a so-called ``capture
feature'' designed to seal the rocket during liftoff, preventing
hot gases from escaping.
   Snow said Morton Thiokol and National Aeronautics and Space
Administration engineers will continue tearing down the
four-segment rocket over the next week and a half.
   Earlier this week, Morton Thiokol workers completed the first
stage of evaluating the test firing by disassembing the booster's
nozzle section.
   Engineers found no problems, declaring it ``the best nozzle
yet,'' Raab said.
   Last week's $20 million test culminated Morton Thiokol's 2{-year
redesign effort.
   For the test, two of the rocket's three field joints _ including
the aft joint, the case-to-nozzle joint and the igniter-to-case
joint _ were peppered with 14 intentional flaws intended to test
the booster's safety features to their limits. The aft joint was
the most flawed.
   Defects included separations in the insulation that holds the
joints together, and channels cut to allow the gases to reach the
joint's middle O-ring.
   The O-ring is one of three such seals in each joint designed to
contain heat generated by ignition of the rocket's 1.1 million
pounds of propellant during launch.

<HEAD>Report: Store Unit 2 For 30 Years</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A report filed with the Nuclear
Regulatory Commission proposes sealing the crippled Three Mile
Island Unit 2 reactor for 30 years after the conclusion of a $1
billion cleanup, GPU Nuclear Corp. said.
   GPU, which oversees the two nuclear plants on Three Mile Island,
said in a statement Thursday the long-term storage of Unit 2 would
prevent exposing cleanup workers to radiation.
   As early as 1986, GPU outlined a plan for mothballing TMI-2.
However, the filing of the safety-evaluation report with the NRC
represents the first time the utility has formally specified a
30-year storage period following the conclusion of the 10-year
cleanup, said Doug Bedell, a company spokesman.
   The safety report is an elaboration of the earlier proposal, he
said.
   TMI-2 has been shut down since March 1979, when a combination of
human and mechanical errors led to a partial melting of the
reactor's nuclear fuel. The cleanup at the site is scheduled to end
next year.
   More than 99 percent of the radioactive fuel will be removed
from the plant, but some areas will remain too contaminated for
human entry.
   Over a 30-year period, exposure levels for cesium-137, the
dominant remaining isotope, would be reduced in half, the report
said.
   ``Although it would be possible to continue decontamination of
the facility, this effort would not appreciably enhance the overall
stability and maintainability of the facility nor would it add to
the overall margin of safety for the public,'' the report said.
   Further work beyond the end of the planned cleanup ``would
result in unnecessary additional occupational exposure to personnel
who would be conducting the decontamination tasks,'' the report
said.
   GPU officials previously outlined a plan for decommissioning the
Unit 2 reactor jointly with its sister plant, TMI-1, when that
plant is ready to be retired from service.
   Decommissioning is the final stage in a plant's life and
involves removing a plant from service and ensuring that any
residual radioactivity is reduced to levels that permit
unrestricted use of the site.

<HEAD>Good News Obscured by Inflation, Rising Interest Rates</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: LEADS with 5 grafs to UPDATE with Commerce Department report;
Picks up 3rd graf, `The department ...'</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By RICK GLADSTONE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   A rash of worrisome news on inflation and rising interest rates
was tempered today by a Commerce Department report that showed
Americans' personal income rose at a healthy pace last month but
their rampant spending declined.
   The report said personal incomes climbed 0.6 percent in July,
matching a June increase. But personal consumption spending, which
includes everything except interest payments on debt, rose 0.5
percent in July, less than half the 1.1 percent rise in June.
   The slower consumer spending was seen as good news for the
economy because of worries that demand for goods is overwhelming
supply and pushing up prices, a classic inflation pattern.
   Other economic reports released Thursday added to worries in the
financial markets that inflation is rising.
   The Commerce Department said the economy, overcoming a drag
caused by the drought, grew at the surprisingly strong annual pace
of 3.3 percent in the April-June quarter.
   The department also said the growth in the gross national
product, the total output of goods and services, would have soared
to a 4.3 percent annual clip had it not been for a $9.5 billion
loss in farm output in a drought-plagued year.
   In another report, the department said after-tax profits by
corporations surged 11.5 percent in the April-June quarter to an
annual rate of $166.6 billion, the best showing since the same
quarter of 1983.
   But it was the 5.1 percent April-June inflation rate reported by
the department, compared with just 1.7 percent in the prior three
months, that incited new worries over possible hikes in interest
rates by the Federal Reserve, which boosted rates earlier this
month.
   ``The economy is growing much too fast,'' said Robert Dederick,
chief economist of the Northern Trust Co. of Chicago. ``It is nice
to grow fast at the early stages of an expansion when you have an
lot of unemployment, but at this stage we just can't afford it.''
   Aggravating the concern were moves by West Germany and other key
European trading partners to hike interest rates in their
countries, partly to combat what they called the unwelcome effects
of a resurgent U.S. dollar.
   ``Today's step is an important signal which will be understood
by the foreign-exchange and capital markets,'' proclaimed West
German Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl. ``It should lead to
stabilization of the (currency) and capital markets and the first
reactions should show this is the case.''
   In response, the dollar tumbled against the West German mark and
British pound in heavy trading.
   ``Poehl used pretty strong language,'' said Derek Walker, an
economist at Midland Bank PLC. ``The Germans have shown us pretty
clearly that they really haven't been happy with the mark at the
level it's been.''
   The combined news of higher U.S. inflation, rising foreign
interest rates and falling dollar rattled the stock and bond
markets.
   On Wall Street, the Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks
fell 15.82 points to 2,010.85. The Treasury's key 30-year bond fell
$5 per $1,000 in face amount and its yield rose to 9.44 percent
from 9.40 percent late Wednesday.
   In another sign of the effects of rising interest rates, the
National Association of Realtors said sales of existing
single-family homes fell 5 percent in July, the first decline in
six months, as rising mortgage interest rates dampened demand.

   President P.W. Botha was greeted
by a black choir singing his praises today as he toured a
shantytown his government tried several times to destroy.
   Botha, making one of his few visits to a black township in his
10 years as head of state, was cheered loudly when he arrived at
the long-troubled Crossroads area outside Cape Town.
   ``Thank you, we accept you as our leader,'' a choir sang in the
Xhosa language.
   After years of trying to eliminate the squatters' town, Botha's
government is now building new houses in Crossroads.
   However, the population has changed. Most of the current 120,000
residents are believed supporters of the vigilantes who in 1986
burned down huge areas of Crossroads where anti-apartheid activists
held sway. Scores of people were killed and 70,000 squatters burned
out of their homes during that factional fighting.
   Botha stopped at a new job-training center where the appointed
mayor, Johnson Ngxobongwana, welcomed him ``in the name of all
Crossroads residents.''
   Ngxobongwana headed the so-called vigilantes.
   Many of his displaced opponents have moved where the government
wanted them _ a massive township called Khayelitsha, further from
Cape Town.
   Botha, accompanied by his wife, Elize, and daughter, Rozanne,
concluded his visit with a half-hour drive past Crossroads shacks
and an area where new homes are being built. Several thousand
residents looked on, many cheering, and youths ran after his car
when it left a child-care center.
   At one point, Botha inspected a house under construction, and
spread mortar with a trowel. Later, he shook the hand of a boy who
ran alongside his car.
   Jan van Eck, an anti-apartheid member of Parliament, said of
Crossroads, ``The black community that rejects an Archbishop
(Desmond) Tutu and accepts into its midst the oppressor, Mr. P.W.
Botha, is far removed from the rest of the oppressed people of
South Africa.''
   He was referring to graffiti on a wall near the main entrance to
Crossroads that says: ``No entry for Tutu'' _ the black Anglican
leader who won the 1984 Nobel Peace Prize for his fight against
apartheid, under which the black majority has no voice in national
affairs.
   Crossroads was declared a township last year _ the first time
its residents were not classified as squatters. Millions of blacks
live in squatter camps elsewhere in South Africa, and the
government has introduced legislation making it easier for
authorities to evict them.
   Botha said the employment center was an example of his
government's attempts to develop black areas.
   ``To boycott is easy, but it leads nowhere,'' Botha told about
200 people in the center. ``To cooperate is sometimes difficult and
to take responsibility sometimes difficult. But history remembers
only those who build, not those who destroy.''
   The center is used to train unemployed people in carpentry,
bricklaying, sewing and other skills.
   The shantytown's troubled history centers around the
white-dominated government's former policy that people of
mixed-race had preference over blacks for all jobs in the Cape Town
region and that blacks lived there only as temporary workers.
   Crossroads was born as a result of the government's attempt to
remove several ``black spots,'' where blacks lived illegally.
   When three such areas were demolished in 1974, residents packed
their few possessions and moved, but only as far as an intersection
near Cape Town's airport.
   By 1976, Crossroads was a squatter city of 60,000 people, and
the government declared it an ``emergency camp.'' Subsequent
demolitions and evictions failed to stem its growth.
   In 1984, Botha abandoned the idea that the Cape should be a
job-preference area for mixed-race people and promised a halt to
forced removals for race separation purposes.
   By 1986, an estimated 200,000 blacks were living in Crossroads'
slums when battles broke out between different neighborhoods.
Residents and community workers said police aided militants from
the oldest section of Crossroads who burned down neighborhoods
where anti-apartheid activists lived.
   The Cape Town Supreme Court is hearing the first of at least
3,000 damage suits by those who lost their homes. They charge the
police and government with responsibilty.

<TEXT>
   The battered body of a former legislator
was paraded through the streets of this medieval town today, one
day after he was fatally beaten by political rivals while
distributing food and blankets to victims of a killer earthquake.
   ``Hang the murderers,'' scores of young men chanted as they
marched in front of a jeep bearing the body of Karna Hyanju, once a
sympathizer of the now-outlawed Communist Party.
   Officials say the earthquake that rocked parts of Nepal and
India last Sunday killed at least 869 people, including seven in
Bhaktapur.
   Witnesses said Hyanju was beaten with umbrellas and sticks
Thursday afternoon, then dragged through the streets for two hours
before police intervened. He died today at Bir Hospital in
Katmandu, 7 miles west of Bhaktapur.
   Uttam Dhaubanjar, a 28-year-old bank employee and neighbor of
the dead man, said Hyanju was distributing blankets, milk and other
foodstuffs in Bhaktapur when he was accosted by a group of men who
accused him of giving relief materials to his own supporters and
ignoring others.
   ``People started beating him with umbrellas,'' Dhaubanjar said.
``There were a lot of scratches on his body, and a lot of blood. It
looked like one ear was missing. Then they made a necklace of their
shoes, put it around his neck and pulled him through the streets.''
   Hyanju served in the assembly from 1981 until 1986 when he lost
the backing of the one-time Communists in Bhaktapur, traditionally
a leftist stronghold.
   Bhaktapur, a 12th-century town of ancient Hindu temples, has a
population of about 50,000. As Hyanju's body was taken through the
winding streets en route to the cremation ground, thousands of
people jammed streets, temple steps and balconies of brick and mud
houses.
   Meanwhile, reports of earthquake damage continued to arrive from
remote parts of the country today. The Home Affairs Ministry said
the confirmed death toll in Nepal had reached 673.
   The official death toll in India was 196, but survivors, news
media and opposition politicians claim the government tally is far
too low and that the actual toll in India could reach 1,500.
   Sunday's earthquake registered 6.5 on the Richter scale, which
records energy released by a tremor according to ground motion
measured by a seismograph. A reading of 6 means the quake can cause
severe damage, while 7 signifies a major quake.
   In another development, Mother Teresa arrived unheralded
Thursday night at Katmandu's airport with food for earthquake
victims in the Himalayas.
   While others go through official aid channels, the 1979 Nobel
Peace Prize winning nun simply flew into the Nepalese capital 550
pounds of powdered milk and tins of biscuits.
   ``We have to show our love for the people, no?'' the 78-year-old
nun said.
   Mother Teresa, who runs a home for the dying in Calcutta, India,
said she would consult her fellow nuns of the Missionaries of
Charity in Katmandu before setting out to meet earthquake victims.
   Her shoulders hunched, her blue cardigan buttoned to her throat
over her blue-bordered white sari, she was ushered into the
airport's VIP lounge by a staffer from Indian Airlines and promptly
started asking how one could reach the quake-stricken areas.
   ``They didn't charge me overweight,'' she said. ``They never do.
I always travel with a big amount.''
   Several international relief organizations have offered to
provide aid for earthquake victims in Nepal, but their
representatives in Katmandu said they were still awaiting word from
the government on what was needed.
   Agencies already operating in Nepal, including UNICEF, have
supplied medical teams and medicine.
   The British government has sent supplies to eastern Nepal, the
hardest hit region, where it has several projects.
   RSS, Nepal's official news agency, said Thursday night the
Japanese government will provide $150,000 worth of tents, blankets,
medicine, biscuits and powdered milk.
   The United States provided $25,000 in immediate funds available
in Katmandu and is awaiting word on further needs. The U.S. Embassy
in New Delhi provided the same amount for Indian victims of the
quake.
   The European Economic Community today approved about $330,000 in
emergency aid for the quake victims. The 12-member trading bloc
said in a statement that the money was ``destined to finance
internal transportation of international aid and eventually other
essential assistance.''

   A 38-year-old man has been indicted by a federal grand jury in
Syracuse, N.Y., on charges that he threatened to have President
Reagan and other top federal officials killed, while a second man
was arrested in Maryland after making similar threats.
   Craig O. Copley, of Herrings, N.Y., who has criminal charges
involving violence on his police record dating back to the 1970s,
is also accused of in the indictment of threatening three federal
judges, a magistrate and a U.S. marshal in two letters.
   Meanwhile, in Baltimore, police and the Secret Service said
today that a man was taken into custody in Frederick, Md., Thursday
evening.
   The man, who claimed to be from Fort Wayne, Ind., made
``threatening statements against the president to police officers,
and he was subsequently taken into custody by my agents,'' said
Joseph R. Coppola, special agent in charge of the Secret Service in
Baltimore.
   Formal charges were expected to be brought against the man later
today, Coppola said. The man may be recommended for psychological
evaluation, the agent said.
   Copley's alleged threats against Reagan, former Attorney General
Edwin Meese III and FBI directors William Sessions and William
Webster was made orally July 15 while he was being investigated for
the letters, according to the indictment, which was handed up
Wednesday.
   The government takes all threats against officials seriously,
``but when a person has a long history of violent offenses, we
redouble our efforts,'' Assistant U.S. Attorney Craig Benedict said
Thursday.
   Copley sent the letters from a cell in the Jefferson County
Jail, where he was serving time for a parole violation, said
Benedict. The motive for the alleged threats was unclear, he said.
   Benedict said Copley will be examined to determine if he is
competent to defend himself against the threat charges. If
convicted on all three threats, Copley faces a maximum penalty of
15 years in prison and a $3,000 fine.
   In Frederick, Md., Police Chief Richard Ashton said the man
arrested Thursday met a truck driver in Ohio and offered him $600
for a ride to Washington.
   ``The closer they got to D.C., the more bizarre this guy's
behavior got,'' Ashton said. ``He started talking about killing
President Reagan and blowing up the Pentagon.''

<HEAD>Plane Repatriating POWs Crash Lands At Djibouti Airport</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GENEVA (AP) </DATELINE>

   A jet charted by the Red Cross to repatriate
Ethiopian and Somalian prisoners of war and civilian internees
crash-landed at Djibouti airport today, slightly injuring 20 of the
190 people on board, the International Committee of the Red Cross
said.
   The Boeing 707 was making its sixth flight in three days between
Mogadishu, Somalia, and Dire Dawa, Ethiopia, when the front landing
gear failed. The plane made a forced landing at Djibouti airport
with only the rear landing gear functioning, Red Cross information
officer Jette Soerensen said.
   The Red Cross said it hopes to resume repatriation flights early
next week, when another plane will be available. The effort to
return 3,700 Ethiopian and Somalians to their homelands began Aug.
23 and was expected to take about 10 days.

   Residents of several communities in Oregon and Montana were
ordered to be ready for possible evacuations as forest fires blazed
in the direction of their homes, but half the campgrounds in
Yellowstone National Park were closed.
   Fire crews in Washington, Idaho, Utah and California also
battled wildfires blackening thousands of acres Thursday.
   In southern Oregon, a lightning-sparked fire shot flames 100
feet into the sky less than a mile from a subdivision north of
Grants Pass, said Kathy Aplin of the Oregon Department of Forestry.
   The blaze doubled in size Thursday to 1,200 acres, prompting
state officials Thursday night to order evacuation plans for the
subdivision of about 1,000 residents.
   ``There are ashes falling just like rain on our deck,'' said
Helen McCall, who lives at the Grants Pass city limits, about two
miles south of the fire.
   No evacuations had been implemented yet, fire officials said
early today.
   In northeast Oregon, the growing Ward Canyon fire prompted
officials to order evacuation plans for the tiny town of Troy, near
the Washington line.
   The blaze expanded to 5,000 acres Thursday, crossing the Grand
Ronde River and burning 15 unoccupied structures, mostly hunting
cabins, Aplin said.
   Effie Rozier of the Red Cross said Troy is a ``motel and a
restaurant'' with about 50 residents scattered nearby.
   In both communities, either state fire officials or the county
sheriff could order evacuations if conditions worsened.
   Forest fires also were burning out of control just east of
Grants Pass near the towns of Rogue River and Medford, in Crater
Lake National Park and south of Pendleton in eastern Oregon.
   Near Grants Pass, firefighters using bulldozers to clear a fire
break early Thurday came upon the secluded home of Pam and Will
Abbott, 200 yards from the flames.
   ``It was just like something out of science-fiction movie,''
Mrs. Abbott said. ``At 3 a.m. the floodlights poured in from two
giant bulldozers. We are scared out of our wits. We just took
pictures of every room of our house and packed our clothes.''
   But the house was saved, Aplin said.
   Residents of Maxville, Mont., a town of two dozen homes about 90
miles southwest of Helena, were told to prepare for possible
evacuation as fire engulfed more than 5,000 acres of heavy timber
and forced closure of the main road through the area, U.S. Forest
Service officials said.
   Firefighters battling another 30,000-acre fire in south-central
Montana were trying to prevent flames from moving closer to Cooke
City and Silver Gate, two Montana communities near Yellowstone.
   ``We have about a 30 to 40 percent chance that we would have to
evacuate today'' from Cooke City and Silver Gate, said David
Liebersbach, incident commander on the Storm Creek fire.
   The southern edge of the fire was about 4 miles north of Cooke
City this morning and a rocky ridge with little vegetation stood
between the fire and the town, Liebersbach said. Strong wind out of
the north was forecast today.
   In central Montana, a fifth 1,300-acre fire that edged to within
a half mile of a Minuteman II missile silo Wednesday continued to
burn out of control.
   The Air Force on Thursday withdrew crews and equipment it had
sent as a precaution. Capt. Donald Planalp of Malmstrom Air Force
Base in Great Falls said there never was any danger to the
underground silo.
   Firefighters in Montana also battled two other blazes that
covered 30,000 and 37,600 acres apiece.
   In northwest Wyoming, wind was down overnight and fires in
Yellowstone National Park did not appear to make much overnight
progress, said park spokeswoman Joan Anzelmo. But she said
officials were checking to see if lightning during the night caused
any new fires.
   Six of the park's 12 campgrounds were closed and the west
entrance was closed during the early morning.
   A 108,000-acre blaze in the park moved to within a quarter-mile
of the Canyon hotel and campground complex Thursday, but
firefighters turned the flames away using backfires, or fires
intentionally set to burn up fuel.
   Park spokeswoman Amy Vanderbilt said the threat to the 600
cabins and other buildings in the area abated before sunset.
   The blaze is one of 10 burning in the nation's oldest national
park. Firefighters in the Bridger-Teton and Grand Teton national
forests to the south were trying to direct another 19,000-acre fire
toward Yellowstone's southern border.
   In eastern Utah, officials hoped to contain a wind-whipped,
200-acre fire that briefly threatened a cluster of summer homes in
Ashley National Forest. Near Idaho's Hell's Canyon, an elite fire
crew grappled with a spot fire in a huge stand of timber. The
blaze, part of a 2,540-acre fire on the Idaho-Oregon line, burned
in such steep terrain that only a helicopter dumping water from a
bucket was used.
   In Washington, firefighters battled two fires covering more than
750 acres southwest of Mount Rainier National Park, and an 80-acre
lightning-sparked fire threatened about 15 homes near the Oregon
line.
   Armed rangers and sheriff's deputies in Northern California
barricaded some 460 square miles, or about 40 percent, of
Stanislaus National Forest because of the fire hazard in the
tinder-dry woods.
   North of San Francisco in Cloverdale, Calif., firefighters
frustrated by wind and steep terrain expected to battle a
1,833-acre fire most of today before stopping its spread. The fire
forced about a dozen families to flee before shifting wind moved
flames away from their homes.

   The FBI and NASA are investigating
``suspicious'' damage discovered in some O-ring seals that had been
destined for use in space shuttle booster rockets, an official of
the manufacturing company said today.
   None of the damaged O-rings, which were found in June and which
appeared to have been deliberately cut, were sent to booster
manufacturer Morton Thiokol, said James Dockstader, vice president
of operations for HydraPak Inc., the West Jordan, Utah, company
that produces the O-rings.
   ``During the normal inspection procedures in the manufacturing
process ... certain space shuttle O-rings appeared to have received
damage of a suspicious origin,'' he said. ``The damaged O-rings
were immediately secured, and no damaged O-rings were shipped to
Morton Thiokol.''
   Morton Thiokol, the FBI and the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration were advised immediately, and Dockstader said both
agencies and HydraPak launched investigations.
   ``Relying upon the results of these investigations, HydraPack
has taken steps to prevent similar incidents in the future and is
confident the problem now is solved,'' he said.
   Dockstader said ``some kind of incision'' had been made in the
O-rings, but he declined to say how many were damaged or what
instrument had been used. He also refused to speculate on a
possible motive.
   None of the company's 85 employees has been dismissed,
Dockstader said, but he refused to say if any had been disciplined.
   FBI spokesman Cal Clegg confirmed the agency has launched an
investigation of possible sabotage, a federal violation. But he
declined to elaborate.
   Morton Thiokol is not investigating the incidents because the
company never received any damaged O-rings from HydraPak, Thiokol
spokesman Rocky Raab said today.
   ``It's always upsetting to hear that someone may, for whatever
reason, be deliberately damaging stuff that's intended for the
space program,'' Raab said. ``But we are satisfied that the steps
taken by HydraPak to resolve the situation are, in fact, adequate.''
   Because Thiokol carefully inspects any products from suppliers,
and never found any problems with the O-rings, the company is
satisfied ``that the situation has resulted in no particular
danger,'' Raab said.
   ``There is virtually no possibility that any damaged O-ring has
ever gotten into the flight hardware,'' he said.
   Morton Thiokol, which produces the boosters at its Wasatch
Operations in northern Utah, on Aug. 18 successfully conducted the
final qualifying test of the booster, which had been redesigned in
the wake of the 1986 Challenger explosion.
   The explosion, which killed Challenger's seven crew members and
grounded U.S. manned space program, was blamed on a faulty booster
joint which allowed a plume of fiery gas to escape, igniting the
craft's main liquid fuel tank.
   O-rings are used as seals to prevent the super-heated gases from
escaping the joints. Morton Thiokol engineers have redesigned the
joints to incorporate a third O-ring and other improvements,
including a metal capture feature, have been added.
   Dockstader said HydraPak submits the O-rings to thorough
internal inspections, which are followed by inspections by Morton
Thiokol personnel and the Defense Contract Administration Service.
   ``The nature of these cuts were such that they could not get
past our inspection,'' he said. ``They were very obvious, and there
is no fear that (any damaged O-rings) left our facility.''
   Dockstader said the plant is operated under a strict security
system. Among other measures, employees are required to wear badges
to gain access to the plant and visitors are always accompanied by
an escort.
   ``We have asked the FBI and NASA for a critique on security, and
we have not received any criticism,'' he said. ``We are always
security-conscious.''

   The Veterans of Foreign Wars rejected Jane
Fonda's apology for her support of North Vietnam during the Vietnam
war, and passed a resolution asking Congress to try her for treason.
   At their 89th annual convention Wednesday, about 13,400 VFW
delegates passed three resolutions by voice vote, one of which said
the apology ``is not enough to redeem the situation.''
   ``The VFW is not insensitive to a sincere expression of
contrition,'' the resolution stated, ``but the VFW wants to be
assured that the `apology' is not simply a means of bolstering her
sagging career and political fortunes.''
   The resolution said that in a speech at Michigan State
University in 1969, Fonda said ``all of us should `pray' to become
communists.''
   ``Does her `apology' mean she also disavows her communist
sympathies?'' the resolution asks.
   The third resolution, passed unanimously by voice vote, accused
Fonda of committing ``many treasonable actions and statements,''
and called for congress to put her on trial for treason.
   The resolutions also urged veterans to ask Congress to
investigate her actions during the war, and denounced ``Union
Street,'' a movie that stars Fonda and was partially filmed in
Waterbury, Conn.
   Fonda, an ardent opponent of U.S. involvement in Vietnam, took a
highly publicized trip to Hanoi during the war and posed for
pictures next to a North Vietnamese anti-aircraft gun.
   Last June, at her request, she appeared on the ABC program
``20@20'' to apologize.
   There was no immediate comment from Fonda or her
representatives. In Los Angeles, a man answering the phone at the
office of Rick Nicita, an agent who works with Fonda, said
spokesman Ron Meyer was not immediately available.
   Fonda was recently in Connecticut filming ``Union Street'' with
Robert DeNiro. Her presence divided the town between those who said
the movie would help the area economically and those who refused to
forgive her for her controversial past.

   The referee of a basketball game sponsored by
drug dealers in a city park was beaten to death over a bad call,
according to a report published today.
   The victim, an elementary school gym teacher described as a man
who devoted himself to children, apparently didn't realize who
sponsored the game, New York Newsday reported.
   The paper quoted unnamed sources as saying that the Supreme
Team, a crack gang that controls the Baisley Park housing project
in Queens, got the game up as a ``public service.''
   Greg Vaughn, 33, was killed in a park near the project when a
player, apparently angry about a call, struck him over the head the
night of July 30, police spokesman Sgt. Norris Hollomon confirmed.
   Vaughn had volunteered to referee the game at a playground a few
blocks from his home, Hollomon said. No arrests have been made.
   Capt. Joseph Hardiman, a Queens detective division commander,
was quoted by the paper as saying Vaughn apparently wasn't involved
in drugs and ``had the reputation of being a great guy.''
   Friends told Newsday that Vaughn tried to use sports to keep
drug-prone kids out of trouble.
   ``He really wanted to make a difference in kids' lives,'' said
Karen Dunston, who worked with Vaughn during his five years as
basketball coach at Medgar Evers College in Brooklyn, a post he
held along with his elementary school job.

   The first permanent household hazardous
waste collection center on the East Coast opened Friday in this
Martha's Vineyard community.
   The center, funded by a $28,000 state grant, will serve all six
towns on the island. State officials hope the pilot project will
spawn similar regional centers elsewhere in the state.
   Until now, the only way to dispose household hazardous wastes
such as paints, solvents and pesticides has been to wait for a
once-a-year collection day.
   James Gutensohn, commissioner of the state Department of
Environmental Management, said the project is especially important
to Martha's Vineyard because a single underground water source or
aquifer supplies water to the entire island.
   ``We are reducing the threat to the water supply that stems from
disposing of these wastes in a landfill,'' Gutensohn said.

   Strikers demanding democracy today halted
all train and air service in the capital, and rioting prisoners set
several buildings ablaze in Rangoon's jail. Most government offices
were deserted.
   ``Government control is eroding, but it has not disintegrated,''
said a Western diplomat in Rangoon. He spoke on condition of
anonymity.
   The influential daughter of Burma's late independence leader
spoke before 400,000 cheering protesters and demanded an interim
government to bring about democracy and end 26 years of
authoritarian rule.
   Aung San Suu Kyi said this alone could ease weeks of unrest that
has toppled one president and killed at least 112 people.
   In another development, retired Defense Minister Gen. Tin Oo
wrote a letter to President Maung Maung calling for an interim
government, an end to one-party rule and condemned the ruling party
for resorting to force.
   Soldiers and police have virtually disappeared from the streets
since the president ended martial law Wednesday. State-run Radio
Rangoon since has reported looting, arson and other violence, and
said today ``hooligans'' torched shanties in suburban areas.
   Security forces opened fire to quell prison riots in three
cities this week and at least seven inmates were killed, the radio
said.
   It said about 2,000 prisoners torched buildings in Insein Jail
eight miles north of Rangoon today. Smoke could be seen eight miles
away from the jail, where nearly 1,700 anti-government protesters
had been held. Smoke could be seen eight miles away.
   In Taunggyi, 290 miles northeast of Rangoon, police and
government employees joined about 100,000 demonstrators demanding
an interim government. Witnesses said it was the largest rally ever
in the Shan State capital.
   Striking workers halted all rail services and Union Burma
Airways domestic flights, officials said.
   Strikes also crippled most factories under the Industries
Ministry, and blue-uniformed factory workers riding in the
ministry's trucks took part in the Rangoon demonstrations.
   Strikes shut two oil refineries, in Syriam across the Rangoon
River and in Mann in central Burma. A strike at Rangoon port also
left scores of foreign ships waiting.
   No newspapers appeared for the second day because workers at the
six state-run dailies stayed away to demand democracy and press
freedom. People were reported to be hoarding goods as the price of
rice soared.
   Aung San Suu Kyi has no political experience but wields
considerable symbolic influence as the daughter of Aung San, who
led the country's struggle for independence from Britain and was
assassinated in 1947.
   She spoke a day after the country's most outspoken dissident,
Aung Gyi, also demanded an interim government. Aung Gyi spoke
before 200,000 people after he was freed from jail following a
month of detention on charges of ``attacking the state.''
   Aung San Suu Kyi asked the military to be ``the people's army''
and look after the people's interests.
   Western diplomats in Rangoon have cited reports of
anti-government feeling in the military and said it may intervene
to establish an interim government. In riots this month, security
forces in some towns reportedly let demonstrators take over local
administrations.
   In an Aug. 18 letter, former teachers of the Defense Services
Academy urged graduates to side with the people. A copy of the
letter was obtained today by The Associated Press in Bangkok,
Thailand.
   ``The D.S.A. did not teach you to wreck the economy of the
nation nor did we teachers teach you to kill the people
systematically or to apprehend and torture them,'' the letter said.
   ``The demonstrations and strikes started as the people were
starving,'' it said. ``It was not the work of ... rebels.''
   Catholic priests and nuns sang hymns to begin today's rally in a
field near the revered Shwedagon Pagoda. People of all ages and
from all walks of life, including students and Buddhist monks,
attended.
   Radio Rangoon said that all 2,750 people arrested during
demonstrations Aug. 3 to Aug. 25 in Rangoon had been released
except those who committed serious crimes. It said those freed
included 744 students, 165 government employees, and 27 Buddhist
monks.
   All other protesters nationwide have been ordered released, it
said.
   The demonstrations forced hard-line President Sein Lwin's
resignation on Aug. 12 and put pressure on Maung Maung, who took
power Aug. 19, to move toward multiparty democracy.
   Maung Maung also is chairman of the ruling Burma Socialist
Program Party.
   On Thursday, hundreds of thousands of people marched in Rangoon
to demand immediate democracy. They rejected Maung Maung's plan to
hold a party congress Sept. 12 to consider holding a popular vote
on whether to end one-party rule.
   When Ne Win, 77, resigned July 23 as chairman of the 1.1
million-member party after 26 years in power, he accepted indirect
responsibility for bloody student-led riots in March and June and
proposed a referendum on multiparty rule.
   But a special party congress rejected the proposal and selected
Sein Lwin to succeed him.
   Sein Lwin, a former army general blamed for harsh suppression of
dissent, took power July 27 and moved quickly against his
opposition. Aung Gyi was arrested two days later in a sweep that
also netted this correspondent.
   Protests against Sein Lwin turned bloody Aug. 8 when security
personnel fired to disperse crowds. The government reported 112
people killed, but diplomats believe the figure was much higher.

   A Puerto Rican nationalist facing trial
in the 1983 robbery of $7 million from a Wells Fargo depot has been
rearrested on charges that he shot an FBI agent in Puerto Rico when
he was arrested in 1985, officials said today.
   Filiberto Ojeda Rios was arrested in Hartford on a warrant from
Puerto Rico accusing him of shooting Special Agent Abelardo Alba on
Aug. 30, 1985, said U.S. Attorney Stanley A. Twardy Jr. The
indictment against him was handed up in Puerto Rico on Wednesday.
   Alba survived the attack, which occurred as he and five other
agents were seeking to arrest Ojeda Rios at his home on charges in
the Sept. 12, 1983, robbery of the Wells Fargo depot in West
Hartford, according to court documents.
   More than $7 million was stolen in a robbery federal authorities
say was masterminded by Los Macheteros, a militant, sometimes
violent group seeking Puerto Rican independence.
   Sixteen people are now awaiting trial in the robbery case.
Prosecutors have said Ojeda Rios was one of the leaders of Los
Macheteros.
   The 55-year-old Ojeda Rios was released on $1 million bond in
May after a pretrial detention lasting 32 months, longer than any
other defendant in federal history. An appeals court ruled that the
detention violated his constitutional rights.
   He was released into the custody of his attorney and has been
living in a Hartford apartment. He was under a judge's order to
remain in Hartford, stay at home between 8 p.m. and 7 a.m., and
wear an electronic bracelet so authorities could monitor his
whereabouts.
   Attorney William Kunstler, who has been involved in the Wells
Fargo defense, has said Ojeda Rios fired three shots at agents who
arrested him in San Juan because he feared being killed.
   Alba was struck in the eye by a fragment of a bullet that
ricocheted off a wall in the Ojeda Rios home, authorities said.
   If convicted of the shooting, Ojeda Rios could be sentenced to
up to 60 years in prison.

   Employees of the second-largest state
broadcasting network went on strike Friday, halting several
television and radio shows.
   It was the first labor strike involving a TV or radio network in
South Korea. The strikers allege the network is biased in favor of
the government.
   The 749-member union of the Moonhwa Broadcsting Corp. demanded
the resignation of the company's president, Hwang Sun-pil, and
actions to guarantee fair reporting.
   The MBC, one of the two state networks in South Korea, could not
broadcast a regular morning news program as union members picketed
the studio.
   Management said it would stay on the air with the help of 1,400
non-union members, most of them senior news editors and technical
crews. Union members said they would start a sit-in to press their
demand.
   The union, whose members include most junior reporters,
newscasters and cameramen in the company, alleged the network has
been pro-government.
   Culture and Information Minister Chung Han-mo denounced the
strike and warned it could hurt the Sept. 17-Oct. 2 Olympics.
   Riding on a nationwide political democratization movement,
unionized reporters have recently been increasing efforts to expand
press freedom. A few pro-government newspapers have been hit by
strikes demanding more such freedom.

and create jobs for minorities through business tax breaks.
   Texas _ which commands 29 electoral votes, and 270 are needed to
win the presidency _ has become a key battleground with the
selection of Sen. Lloyd Bentsen of Texas as the running mate of
Bush's Democratic rival, Michael Dukakis.
   Bush made no mention while campaigning Thursday of his
beleaguered running mate, Sen. Dan Quayle of Indiana, but he
predicted that he will win in his adopted home state in November.
   Bush seemed eager to get on with his campaign after many days of
media focus on the background of Quayle. Asked by reporters if he
thought the Quayle matter was behind him, Bush said, ``Yes, I do.''
   However, a new report today in The (Cleveland) Plain Dealer says
Quayle's official Senate and campaign biography contains inflated
claims about his service in the Indiana attorney general's office.
The newspaper reported that Quayle was an entry-level research
assistant for most of the time he claims to have been ``chief
investigator for the Consumer Protection Division of the Indiana
Attorney General's Office from 1970-1971.''
   Bush focused Thursday on his pitch to Texas voters, and after a
warm reception from several hundred supporters at a San Antonio
rally, he said, ``There does seem to be forward motion.''
   On his four-day swing through Texas, the vice president was
heading today to Longview for a rally, and on Saturday will go to
Dallas for a speech to a Marine Corps group and a Republican
fund-raiser.
   ``I will win in Texas but I will work hard to do that,'' Bush
told reporters as he left the rally en route to Houston.
   The campaign stop in San Antonio was tailored to appeal to the
region's large Hispanic population.
   Wearing a loose-fitting shirt called a guayaberra for the
occasion, he was welcomed at the downtown San Antonio River front
by a banner in Spanish and he was serenaded by a Mariachi version
of ``Hail to the Chief.'' In his remarks to the sweltering outdoor
rally, Bush promised ``to help those minorities who haven't really
had a shot at the starting line.''
   ``The best way to do that in employment is to have urban and
rural enterprise zones, a break in that tax structure that will
encourage business to locate where those populations are,'' Bush
said.
   ``I support affirmative action so minorities have a better shot
at the American dream,'' he said. ``I will be a good president for
all Americans.''
   At the rally, Bush promised he would ``put some incentive back
into the energy business, into the oil business,'' and said he
would resist gun control proposals.
   In an interview published today by the New York Times, Bush
appeared to back away from earlier promises to deploy the Star Wars
missile defense system ``as soon as feasible.'' He indicated that
cost would be a factor in determining whether to deploy it.
   ``I don't think we yet know what the price tag will be,'' Bush
said. ``If you went to a full deployment of a full strategic
defense, it would be very expensive. What I want to do is to
continue research at the levels of funding, essentially, that we
have requested.''
   Sheila Tate, Bush's press secretary, said the vice president was
not shifting his stance on Star Wars and has always supported
research on the defense system.
   She said Bush has long contended that ``full deployment would be
very, very expensive, that we would cross that bridge when we come
to it.''
   In Texas, Bush recalled his move to the state in the 1940s, with
his wife Barbara, to begin working in the oil industry.
   ``I was drawn to this state by two things _ Texas was a place of
big opportunity, a can do place, and it was strong in the
traditional values, family, faith and peace and patriotism,'' he
said. ``I'm proud to be back in my home state of Texas.''
   The vice president maintains a formal address at the Houstonian
hotel and condominium complex in Houston where he is staying during
his campaign trip.
   ``We are getting to be a high-tech state,'' he said, adding that
he would help stimulate new business by cutting the capital gains
tax and keeping Congress ``from strangling small business with
regulation.''

   One hundred diseased and vicious dogs were
found at a man's home, and most were put to sleep, officials said.
   Police charged Issac Taylor, 74, who lives on less than one
acre, with violating two ordinances regulating ownership of animals.
   It was the third time authorities have removed large numbers of
dogs from Taylor's property. Four dogs are allowed under Clinton
law.
   One officer was bitten when police and Animal Rescue League
officials went to Taylor's house Thursday, said Scott Worley,
animal control officer.
   A few dogs were killed by gunshots at the home Thursday after
officials were attacked, police said. One dog will be held for
observation for suspected rabies.
   Most of them were killed by lethal injection, said Debra
Boswell, director of the Mississippi Animal Rescue League, which
helped round up the dogs. ``Nearly all of them were diseased and
aggressive.''
   Taylor is being allowed to keep four dogs, but they must be
spayed or neutered, Boswell said.
   Taylor has an unpublished telephone number and couldn't be
reached for comment Thursday or Friday.
   But Boswell said Taylor believes he's being kind to an animal by
giving it a home.
   ``People think they're being kind by just putting food and water
out, but animals need more than that. They need medicine and human
contact,'' she said.

   A Romanian human rights expert denied his

to Geneva to present a report to a U.N. meeting.
   Dumitru Mazilu wrote a letter to the U.N. Subcommission on
Prevention of Discrimination and Protection of Minorities, urging
that it ``ask the Romanian authorities to put an immediate end to
the repressive measures and police terror against me and my
family.''
   Mazilu was to submit a study on youth and human rights at the
group's meeting in Geneva, but Romanian officials said he was
unable to attend and could not finish his study due to a heart
condition. They said he recently left Bucharest to be treated at a
health resort.
   The U.N. secretary-general's office is investigating.
   Mazilu, in an earlier letter to the subcommission, said the
government had forced him to drop the study and put him under
police surveillance.
   In his latest message, read aloud Thursday, Mazilu said he had
no ``personal problems'' that would keep him from presenting the
report.

   A bomb exploded under a policeman's car in
this northern city Friday, and the mayor of a nearby town said she
received telephone threats for her stand against an attack by
Basque separatists.
   The police officer was not in the car when the blast occurred
shortly after midnight, ripping apart the front seats, dislodging
the engine and shattering nearby windows. No injuries were reported.
   On Thursday, Basque separatists claimed responsibility for a
bombing Sunday that killed two civil guards in Estella. Mayor Rosa
Lopez told Spanish National Radio she had been threatened because
she engineered the ouster of a town councilor who refused to sign a
resolution condemning the bombing.
   The former councilor belongs to Herri Batasuna, the political
wing of the separatist group ETA, which claimed responsibility for
the Estella bombing.
   ETA, whose name stands for Homeland and Liberty in the Basque
language, seeks independence for the three-province Basque region
and Navarre, the neighboring region where the civil guards were
killed.
   ETA has claimed responsibility for killing more than 600 people,
mostly civil guard, military and police officers, since taking up
arms in 1968. It has killed eight people this year.

   A castle in a rural Japanese town and one in West
Germany will become ``sister castles,'' a local official said
Friday.
   One castle is in Maruoka in the northern Fukui prefecture and
the other is Marksburg Castle of Brauback, West Germany, a Maruoka
official said.
   Maruoka hopes the sister-castle agreement will promote cultural
exchanges with the West German city, 40 miles south of Bonn, town
official Masaaki Hayami said. The agreement will be signed in April
during Maruoka's centennial ceremonies, he said.
   Maruoka Castle, built in the 16th century by a samurai warlord,
is one of the oldest castles in Japan and has been designated as an
important cultural property by the government, Hayami said.
   Marksburg Castle, which stands along the Rhein River, was built
in the 13th century, and is one of the oldest castles in West
Germany, according to Hayami.
   He said the Marksburg and Maruoka castles are the oldest castles
maintaining their original conditions in the two countries.

<HEAD>Value Of `Celebrity Good Will' Can Be Divided in Divorce, Judge
Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HACKENSACK, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Comedian Joe Piscopo's fame is his
fortune, and it also should be his wife's, a judge says.
   Ruling in Piscopo's divorce case, Superior Court Judge Isabel B.
Stark said this week that Piscopo's ``celebrity good will'' can be
counted as an asset in dividing property with the star's wife,
Nancy.
   ``It is a quantifiable asset, just as in any other profession,''
Ms. Stark said. But she added that the way celebrity status should
be quantified is ``somewhat different'' from a partnership or
corporation.
   One of Piscopo's attorneys, Gary N. Skoloff, said Thursday it
was only the second time nationwide a judge in a divorce case had
placed a value on celebrity status. A judge in New York last March
made a similar ruling regarding actress Marisa Berenson.
   Skoloff, who vowed to appeal the ruling, said it was unclear
exactly what the value of Piscopo's celebrity was from the judge's
oral opinion, delivered Wednesday from the bench.
   He said he would have to wait for a written opinion, but added
that under his understanding of what the judge had said, Mrs.
Piscopo would be eligible to receive roughly $50,000.
   Piscopo is a onetime star of NBC's ``Saturday Night Live'' who
has appeared in several movie comedies including ``Wise Guys'' and
also stars in a popular series of beer commercials. He and his wife
separated three years ago.
   The state Supreme Court has held that medical and dental
licenses and a business degree are not assets that could be
distributed in court, said Skoloff. He said he would appeal Ms.
Stark's ruling on those grounds.
   The judge also said Mrs. Piscopo could move with the couple's
9-year-old son, Joseph John, to Florida.

<HEAD>Government Will Appeal to Supreme Court If Marcos Ordered Home</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIGUEL C. SUAREZ</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   The government of President Corazon
Aquino will appeal to the Supreme Court if a lower tribunal rules
that Ferdinand Marcos can come home to face an accuser, the chief
prosecutor said Friday.
   Solicitor-General Francisco Chavez made the statement to
reporters after a meeting between Mrs. Aquino and chief legal
advisers to study implications of a petition filed by the former
president to return when a former Cabinet minister testifies
against him in November.
   Marcos petitioned the anti-graft court Wednesday to allow him to
return so he could defend himself when Baltazar Aquino, the former
Public Works Minister, gives a deposition on alleged kickbacks by
Japanese firms during the previous administration.
   Last week, the anti-graft court said Marcos had the right to be
present and cross-examine Aquino if the testimony was to be used in
criminal proceedings. Aquino is no relation to the president.
   But the anti-corruption court stopped short of ordering Marcos
to return. Chavez said he will file a motion next week asking the
court to reject Marcos' petition.
   ``If our position is not upheld, then we will elevate the matter
to the Supreme Court,'' Chavez said. He added that he expected
Marcos to do the same if the lower court rejects the petition.
   The government was trying to reconcile ``the demands of the
judiciary and the demands of national security,'' presidential
spokesman Teodoro Benigno said.
   Mrs. Aquino cited national security as the main reason for
preventing Marcos from coming back from his exile in Hawaii, where
he fled after the February 1986 uprising that toppled his 20-year
administration.
   But she has also pledged to abide by the decision of the courts,
even if they order Marcos home.
   Defense Secretary Fidel Ramos said the military has begun
preparing security plans in the event that Marcos returns.
   Pro-Marcos groups within the armed forces have been responsible
for at least two of the half dozen major coup attempts against the
Aquino government. Key leaders of those coup attempts remain at
large.
   The Philippine government claims Marcos embezzled up to $10
billion during his graft-ridden administration.

   The jet carrying Democratic vice
presidential candidate Lloyd Bentsen and his entourage was grounded
today after a passenger door was forced closed incorrectly.
   The problem, which caused Bentsen to cancel a scheduled trip to
Atlanta, was the fourth in a series of mishaps in the last eight
days that have plagued campaign airplanes.
   The Bentsen aircraft, a Presidential Airways 737, had been
boarded by its traveling party of about 60, including the Texas
senator, his staff, Secret Service agents and journalists.
   A small puncture on the edge of the door and a damaged hinge
were discovered before the plane pulled away from the gate. The
plane was grounded indefinitely for repairs, and campaign officials
began making arrangements to fly directly to Hot Springs, Ark.,
where Bentsen had been scheduled to travel from Atlanta.
   On Saturday, fumes and smoke entered the cabin of a Key Air
Boeing 727 as it was landing in Columbus, Ohio, carrying the press
corps traveling with Republican presidential candidate George bush.
   On Monday, the same plane's wing flaps did not retract as it was
taking off from Chicago. The plane dumped fuel into Lake Michigan
and returned to Chicago. The Bush campaign agreed to terminate its
contract with Key after reporters refused to use the carrier
anymore.
   Journalists following Bush had another problem Thursday when
their United Airlines Boeing 737-300 was grounded after an engine
overheated on takeoff from Houston. The reporters missed Bush's
trip to San Antonio.

   Mourners at the funeral for President
Lazarus E. Salii were told that dissention and mistrust must be
resolved, after the first two presidents of this western Pacific
archipelago have died from violent means.
   ``We must cooperate with one another,'' said President Thomas O.
Remengesau, who is serving out Salii's term which ends this year.
   Salii was elected three years ago to succeed Palau's first
president, Haruo I. Remeliik, who was shot to death.
   Salii was found dead with a gunshot wound to the head Aug. 20 in
his home in the capital city of Koror.
   The government is withholding results of an autopsy performed
Monday to determine whether Salii was killed by a gunman or
committed suicide.
   The government will delay releasing the results until they are
reviewed by family members and the cabinet, said presidential aide
Bonifacio Basilius.
   Remeliik was gunned down outside his home. Three men convicted
at trial later were acquitted of murder charges on appeal.
   ``These two very tragic events have made us search our souls to
see if our people can survive in today's world,'' Remengesau told
the more than 1,000 mourners at the National Congress Building.
   High Chief Ibedul Yutaka M. Gibbins called for unity and peace
among Palauans.
   ``The people of Palau must work together in unity and cooperate
to bring prosperity to our future generations,'' Gibbons said.
   ``We cannot afford to lose the cream of our leadership,''
Remengesau, 57, said. ``These are costly lessons that must never
again be repeated.''
   Palau is a 400-mile-long archipelago about 600 miles east of the
Philippines and 4,500 miles southwest of Hawaii. Its nearly 15,000
residents inhabit eight of its 200 islands.
   The island chain, which implemented constitutional government in
1981, is a U.N. trusteeship with its affairs administered by the
United States' Department of the Interior.
   It has been seeking a new political status with the United
States that would terminate the trusteeship and make Palau
self-governing.
   Salii was a staunch proponent of a proposed compact of free
association under which Palau would receive $460 million in U.S.
aid during the first 15 years of a 50-year agreement.
   However, the pact has run into court challenges and an impasse
in the U.S. Congress on legislation to implement the agreeement.
   Former U.S. Ambassador Fred M. Zeder, who negotiated the compact
with Salii and Remeliik, said that Salii ``died for the cause'' of
sovereignty and self-determination.
   ``It is time for healing and forgiveness and that message should
be carried as well to Washington and the U.S. Congress,'' Zeder said
   James D. Berg, director of the State Department's Office of
Freely Associated State Affairs in Washington, said the U.S.
government will redouble its efforts ``to bring into reality a
freely chosen relationship'' for Palau.
   ``The way to honor President Salii's memory is for national
reconciliation,'' he said after the two-hour state funeral.
   Berg was part of a four-member U.S. delegation to the funeral
headed by Janet J. McCoy, principal deputy assistant secretary of
Interior.

<HEAD>Lawyers In Discrimination Suit Say FBI Investigating Them</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HOLDEN LEWIS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>EL PASO, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The FBI is using surveillance and
unfounded investigations to intimidate attorneys for 311 Hispanic
agents suing the bureau in a class-action discrimination suit, the
lawyers charge.
   But the FBI's assistant director labels the allegations
``outrageous and repugnant.''
   The flurry of charges and counter-charges in court Thursday
punctuated the end of the nine-day trial before U.S. District Judge
Lucius Bunton, who said he hopes to render a decision by Oct. 1.
Almost 100 witnesses testified.
   The 311 Hispanic agents joined in the class-action suit contend
the FBI discriminates in the promotion, discipline and assignment
of Hispanics. They seek unspecified damages and changes in FBI
policies.
   About 400 _ or 4.3 percent _ of the FBI's 9,400 agents are
Hispanic, compared to about 8 percent of the general population.
   The plaintiffs' attorneys, Hugo Rodriguez and Antonio Silva,
complained Tuesday and Thursday that the bureau has kept watch on
them and possibly begun an investigation to discredit them.
   ``This is the FBI,'' said Rodriguez, who resigned from the FBI
last year after 18 years. ``You've heard witness after witness
state that the first rule of the FBI is, `Don't embarrass the
bureau.' That's what this case is doing. It's bringing out the
dirty laundry of the FBI.''
   About 40 agents testified that the the bureau transfers Hispanic
agents more often to undesirable locations, hands them assignments
that are less glamorous or more dangerous, promotes them slower and
gives them less recognition for their successes.
   Witnesses called by the FBI denied the accusations.
   Rodriguez and Silva were notified Thursday that the FBI was
concerned about a possible security breach in connection with the
disappearance of an affidavit from Rodriguez' briefcase last month.
Someone mailed the affidavit to FBI headquarters.
   Rodriguez and Silva implied the FBI stole the document July 29
so it could start an embarrassing investigation.
   Silva told Bunton: ``The government is attempting to put us in
jail, to ruin our legal careers, for representing these men and
women of the FBI.''
   But Milt Ahlerich, FBI assistant director for Congressional and
public affairs, said the charge was false and denied an
investigation resulted from the affidavit's disappearance.
   ``They're the ones making a veiled allegation of a document
being taken from them,'' he said. ``The idea that the FBI would
tamper with attorneys' papers is outrageous and repugnant to the
FBI's mission.''
   On Tuesday, FBI attorney Lainie Simion tried to introduce into
evidence a document concerning a closed investigation into whether
Rodriguez and Silva were selling arms to the Nicaraguan Contra
rebels.
   Bunton did not allow the document into evidence. No charges
resulted from the investigation, which Rodriguez dismissed as a
groundless intimidation tactic that he said was started after he
reesigned from the FBI.
   An El Paso police officer lent credence to the surveillance
charges when he testified Thursday that he saw a man hiding in the
police garage last April, taking photos through a telephoto lens of
Rodriguez and Silva leaving the courthouse with the lead plaintiff,
Bernardo ``Matt'' Perez.
   The officer reported the incident to the FBI. A brief
investigation revealed nothing, testified Richard Schwein, special
agent in charge of the El Paso FBI office.
   Perez, the No. 2 agent in El Paso, filed the suit in January
1987.

secretary-general, in a historic conference room decorated with
murals depicting human proress.
   The Council Chamber of the Palais des Nations has witnessed such
other events as the signing last April of the Afghanistan agrement,
the conference on Laos in 1961-62, the conference of foreign
ministers on Berlin in 1958, the Big Four summit of 1955, and the
conferences on Korea and Indochina in 1954.
   This time, the goal is ending an 8-year-old war that has taken
up to 1 million lives and cost hundreds of billions of dollars.
   Here are brief profiles of the participants:

<TEXT>
   ALI AKBAR VELAYATI _ Iran's foreign minister is a 42-year-old
pediatrician who studied briefly at Johns Hopkins University in the
United States. He is regarded as a moderate and has pressed for an
end to Iran's isolation.
   Velayati has the support of Hashemi Rafsanjani, the parliament
speaker and acting military commander who was behind Iran's
acceptance of a cease-fire, and presumably that of revolutionary
patriarch Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini.
   He spoke against the late Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi as a young
man and spent time in jail for anti-government activities. Velayati
was instrumental in preparing Khomeini's return from exile in the
revolution that ousted the shah in 1979, and became foreign
minister in 1981.

   TARIQ AZIZ _ The foreign minister and deputy premier of Iraq,
51, is a close associate of President Saddam Hussein and among the
nation's most influential figures. He is a leader of the ruling
Baath Party and a member of the governing Revolutionary Command
Council.
   Aziz, a Christian in an overwhelmingly Moslem nation, is
considered one of the government's most articulate spokesmen. He
obtained a bachelor's degree in English literature from Baghdad
University, joined the Baath Party as a young man and worked for
Iraqi newspapers and television.
   He became editor of the party newspaper, Al-Thawra, and was
named informatrion minister in 1981, a year after escaping a bomb
assassination attempt blamed on pro-Iranian Shiite Moslems. It was
one of several attacks on Iraqi officials before the war began in
September 1980.

   JAVIER PEREZ DE CUELLAR _ The U.N. secretary-general is 68 and
in his second five-yer term. He is soft-spoken and given to
understatement, known more for discretion than dynamism.
   Perez de Cuellar is fond of the French saying: ``The melody
makes the song, not a loud voice.''
   He was Peru's ambassador to the United Nations in 1971-75 and
special U.N. representative to Cyprus from 1975-77, became
undersecretary-general for special political affairs in 1979 and
served as special representative to Afghanistan in 1981.
   In the first recent success for U.N. diplomacy, his special
representative Diego Cordovez mediated the Afghanistan settlement
signed in April.

   Pop singer Diana Ross gave birth to a baby
boy today, the singer's publicist reported.
   It was the 44-year-old singer's fifth child and her second with
husband Arne Naess Jr., according to publicist Elliot Mintz.
   He declined to say where the infant was born, or give the
child's birth weight or name.
   Ms. Ross married Naess, a Norwegian shipping tycoon, in October
1985. She gave birth to their first child, also a boy, last
October. That child's name is Ross Arne Naess.

   A jury began deliberating today whether
the Copper-7 intrauterine device caused sterility in a 30-year-old
Minnesota woman.
   The plaintiffs, Esther Kociemba of Elk River and her husband,
William, asked the jury Thursday to penalize Copper-7 maker G.D.
Searle & Co. by awarding at least $16.5 million, far more than any
jury has awarded in 18 similar cases.
   ``You are going to have the ability to step right into that
board room and send a message ...,'' Michael Ciresi, the Kociembas'
attorney, told the jury. ``Maybe they'll learn a lesson.''
   Ciresi, who spearheaded litigation against A.H. Robins that
resulted in a settlement of $38 million for 198 users of the Dalkon
Shield IUD, maintained during the three-month trial that the
Copper-7 caused pelvic inflammatory disease that rendered Mrs.
Kociemba sterile. The Chicago-based Searle improperly tested the
device, he argued.
   ``The Copper-7 was a time bomb ticking away in women's wombs,''
Ciresi told the jury. ``Searle knew and concealed the dangers of
that device from the medical community.''
   But Paul Strain, a lawyer for Searle, said the company exceeded
U.S. Food and Drug Administration requirements in marketing
Copper-7, which was once the most widely used IUD in America.
   He attacked the credibility of the plaintiffs' witnesses and
said Ciresi did not even prove that Mrs. Kociemba suffered from
pelvic infection, let alone that it was caused by the Copper-7.
   ``Time and again the Searle doctors did more than they had to do
to ensure the safety of the women who were going to use the
Copper-7,'' Strain said. ``The medical literature fortifies the
judgment that the Copper-7 is safe and effective.''
   Strain termed ``raw and mean'' allegations that Searle concealed
evidence about the Copper-7 ``to hurt women'' and said one expert
witness for the other side had testified in many trials and ``would
always blame an IUD unless a woman had a gunshot wound to the
abdomen.''
   Strain cautioned the jury to base its decision on facts instead
of sympathy for Mrs. Kociemba, who wept quietly for much of the day.

<HEAD>Tentative Accord Reached Covering Former PSA Attendants</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MATT YANCEY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   After months of wrangling that included a job
action which forced 170 flight cancellations, USAir and its flight
attendants' union have hammered out a tentative agreement on wage
parity for former Pacific Southwest Airlines attendants.
   Officials for the airline and the Association of Flight
Attendants said Friday the accord also extends for another year,
with some minor modifications, a contract covering a total of 4,203
attendants. The current contract was up for renewal and amendment
Sept. 1.
   The new contract, which has to be ratified by the union members,
was reached late Thursday in Pittsburgh after 10 days of intense
negotiations there, said Judy Stack, an official of the Association
of Flight Attendants.
   USAir acquired Pacific Southwest in May 1987 but operated it as
a separate subsidiary until last April before merging the two
operations.
   The 961 former Pacific Southwest attendants had been represented
by the Teamsters but voted to switch to the Association of Flight
Attendants just prior to USAir's acquisition of PSA.
   Stack said the former PSA attendants generally were on pay
scales about 10 percent less than those at USAir. The company had
offered to bring the two groups of workers to parity over a
three-year period.
   The union had wanted that accomplished faster. When the two
sides reached an impasse last spring, many attendants refused to
work overtime on the Memorial Day weekend, forcing USAir to cancel
some 170 flights then.
   Neither Stack nor David Shipley, a spokesman for the airline,
would disclose details of the agreement. They said completion of
the ratification vote is expected in late September.
   The union and the company now have to go through the same
process to integrate a contract covering some 3,000 flight
attendants at Piedmont Airlines into the USAir accord.
   USAir purchased Piedmont last November and hopes to merge their
operations next March.

<TEXT>
   China and the Soviet Union will try to remove the
last major hurdle to restoring relations when they meet this
weekend to discuss Cambodia.
   ``The major obstacle in the way of normalizing Sino-Soviet
relations is the Kampuchean (Cambodian) question,'' Foreign
Ministry spokesman Jin Guihua said Thursday. ``This obstacle must
be removed before ... relations can be normalized.''
   The talks between Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Igor Rogachev
and his Chinese counterpart Tian Zengpei are to begin Sunday. It
will be the first time the two sides have met solely to discuss
Cambodia.
   Vietnam, backed by the Soviet Union, has occupied Cambodia since
1979. China supports the Khmer Rouge, one of three guerrilla groups
in the opposition.
   ``The talks will concentrate on how to press Vietnam to withdraw
all its troops from Cambodia at an early date,'' Jin said at the
weekly briefing.
   ``We hope that the talks will achieve positive results to
contribute to the improvement of relations between our two
countries,'' he said.
   Rogachev is to arrive in Beijing Saturday.
   The world's two largest communist countries split over
ideological and strategic differences in the early 1960s. Moscow
and Beijing have met every other year since 1982 to discuss
normalizing relations and have encouraged a steady increase in
trade and cultural contacts.
   But China has consistently held that three obstacles stand in
the way of normalization: Soviet support of Vietnam's occupation of
Cambodia, Soviet military presence in Afghanistan and Soviet troops
stationed along the Chinese border.
   Premier Li Peng, in a meeting Thursday with Prime Minister
Noboru Takeshita of Japan, said Soviet support for Vietnam's
occupation of Cambodia blocks normalized political ties.
   The Soviet Union has already taken steps to remove the other two
obstacles by beginning a withdrawal of its troops from Afghanistan
in May and reducing troop strength along the Chinese border with
Soviet ally Mongolia.
   China, which backs the Khmer Rouge and other forces fighting
Vietnamese troops in Cambodia, says the Soviet Union, which gives
the Hanoi government financial support, must use its influence to
end Vietnam's occupation.
   Vietnam invaded Cambodia in late 1978 and ousted the Khmer Rouge
who killed hundreds of thousands of people during its four-year
rule.
   Vietnam agreed in May to withdraw 50,000 troops this year and
remove all its forces by 1990. It also has endorsed recent talks
between the anti-Vietnamese resistance coalition and the pro-Hanoi
government in Phnom Penh.
   The success of the Beijing talks would also pave the way for the
first Sino-Soviet summit since Nikita Khrushchev visited Beijing in
1959.
   Both Chinese senior leader Deng Xiaoping and Soviet leader
Mikhail S. Gorbachev have expressed interest in a summit, but China
refuses to participate in a meeting until Moscow pressures Vietnam
to leave Cambodia.

   Hundreds of Siberians cheered Friday as an
American swam about 11\ miles across chilly Lake Baikal to promote
U.S.-Soviet friendship.
   Lynne Cox of Los Alamitos, Calif., made the early morning swim
across the crescent-shaped lake, the world's deepest, in four hours
and 20 minutes, Tass reported.
   ``Wish me success,'' Ms. Cox, 31, shouted to a crowd as she
plunged into the 52-degree water.
   The official Soviet news agency said hundreds of residents of
the city of Irkutsk stood on the banks to cheer Ms. Cox.
   Strong winds and currents made the journey difficult. At one
point, she told Tass, she considered giving up because her leg
cramped. But two people jumped off accompanying boats and raised
her spirits to continue, and she made it to the Listvyanka
settlement, the finishing point, Tass said.
   American jazz saxophonist Paul Winter was on shore near the end
of Ms. Cox's journey, and played ``America the Beautiful'' and a
song about Baikal.
   ``I was overwhelmed, and that understates the whole thing,'' she
said of the reception she received as she made her way to an
ambulance, where she spent about 20 minutes recovering.
   ``Seeing all those people, those people from the village, I
think we're doing something good,'' she said.
   Ms. Cox said she overcame the difficulties of the swim in the
name of ``goodwill, peace and friendship between the peoples of the
U.S.S.R. and U.S.A.,'' according to Tass.
   Before leaving, Ms. Cox was hoisted onto a small retaining wall
from which she told the crowd through a loudspeaker: ``I've found
some warm hearts in Siberia.''

<DATELINE>SANTA FE, N.M. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The death of Jesse Merlan, a local radio
commentator known as ``Joe Question,'' apparently was caused from
poison in his breakfast cereal, police said.
   Merlan, 75, died Thursday at St. Vincent Hospital. He had spent
10 days in the intensive care unit at the hospital before he died
of multiple heart attacks, his son Tom Merlan said.
   Police Detective Jack Dietz said Merlan and his wife, Wilma, 80,
were hospitalized Aug. 15 after they ate bran cereal containing a
pesticide. Mrs. Merlan was discharged a few days later.
   ``We're looking at it as a suspicious death and we're trying to
find out how (the poison) got there,'' Dietz said. An autopsy was
planned.
   Dietz said the cereal was bought in bulk from a local store.
   ``Nobody seems to think the poison came from the wholesaler,''
he said.
   There have been no other cases reported, and investigators
believe Merlan's death was an isolated case.
   Investigators identified the poison as a pesticide sold as Temik
and said it is federally restricted and available only to licensed
users. Merlan was not licensed, Dietz said.
   The officer said the cereal was kept in a jar that might have
previously contained the poison, but no other traces of it have
been found.
   As Joe Question, Merlan had been host of a call-in talk show for
various radio stations in the area since about 1970.

   Rep. Richard Cheney, R-Wyo., a member of the
House Republican leadership, was released from George Washington
University Hospital on Friday, a week after undergoing coronary
bypass surgery.
   Cheney, 47, who served as White House chief of staff during the
Ford administration, had suffered three reportedly mild heart
attacks in 1978, 1984 and in June of this year.
   A spokesman, Pete Williams, said Cheney had been advised by his
physician that if he underwent the operation he could remain
physically active and reduce the possibility of further heart
attacks.
   Cheney, chairman of the House Republican Conference, left last
week's GOP convention in New Orleans a day early and underwent
surgery on Friday.
   Williams said Cheney will rest at home for the next two weeks
and return to work at the end of the congressional summer recess,
on Sept. 7.

<NOTE>Eds: Leads throughout with talks resuming in joint session,
settlement depends on resolving border treaty, details. No pickup.</NOTE>

<TEXT>
   The Iranian envoy took a hard line today at the
second day of the Iran-Iraq peace talks, saying a lasting
settlement to the prolonged dispute depends on observance of a 1975
border treaty repudiated by Iraq.
   The joint face-to-face session between foreign ministers was
temporarily abandoned this morning. U.N. Secretary-General Javier
Perez de Cuellar said it was difficult for the bitter rivals to
continue meeting. They met instead in separate rooms for about two
hours.
   But in the afternoon, the face-to-face session was resumed by
Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati and Iraqi Foreign
Minister Tariq Aziz, flanked by their delegations. There was no
immediate word on progress.
   However, Velayati delivered a strong statement after the morning
session about the validity of the 1975 Algiers Treaty on Iran-Iraq
boundaries. The issue poses a major stumbling block in the
negotiations.
   Emerging from the morning session, Velayati told reporters,
``For reaching this comprehensive, just and honorable solution, we
have valid criteria ... (United Nations) Resolution 598, (the)
outline plan of the secretary-general and the 1975 treaty between
Iran and Iraq.''
   In September 1980, President Saddam Hussein renounced that
treaty, which gave Iran rights to the disputed Shatt-Al-Arab
waterway, and five days later invaded Iraq.
   The border issue and treaty are considered critical to a peace
settlement because Resolution 598 requires troop withdrawal to
mutually recognized boundaries. Iraq now says the boundaries are in
question.
   Iraqi officials recently reaffirmed their repudiation of that
treaty.
   Earlier in the day, Perez de Cuellar told reporters that
problems between Iran and Iraq have lasted centuries, ``and then it
is not in one afternoon that we can decide.''
   The session began Thursday with a joint session led by the
secretary-general, and both sides addressed each other through
intepreters. It was the first face-to-face meeting of foreign
ministers since the Persian Gulf war began almost eight years ago.
   But after two hours the session was suspended, and both sides
met in separate chambers for three more hours, with U.N. officials
meeting them and reporting to Perez de Cuellar.
   The format of separate rooms was continued today, U.N. spokesman
Francois Giuliani said. The secretary-general first met separately
with each minister, then the delegations consulted in separate
rooms, he said.
   U.N. officials, based in another room, occasionally visited the
delegations and Perez de Cuellar at times met the delegations
separately.
   Meanwhile, a small group of Iraqi Kurds and other Iraqi
opposition groups demonstrated outside the building and protested
the Baghdad government's use of chemical weapons on its rebellious
Kurdish minority.
   Iraq had demanded the direct, face-to-face talks before a
cease-fire to test Iran's intentions. Iran refused and both sides
agreed on direct talks shortly after the halt in hostilities.
   ``I am sure the parties sincerely want to solve the problem,''
Perez de Cuellar said today. ``(But) I think we have to be a little
patient.''
   He said the arrangement was made at the request of the two
countries. ``I would prefer to have them all the time in the main
room with me.'' But, he said, ``I have to accommodate myself to the
wish of the parties.''
   The talks began about one hour late. Velayati declined to answer
questions from reporters at the entrance of the building. The bulk
of the Iranian delegation had arrived earlier, on time for the
meeting.
   Giuliani denied reports by U.N. officials that the
secretary-general was considering appointing former Swiss President
Kurt Furgler as his special representative to continue the
Iran-Iraq talks.
   He also dismissed a Swiss Radio report that Edouard Brunner, the
No. 2 in the Swiss Foreign Ministry, would be appointed. He said if
Brunner is appointed Swiss ambassador to Washington, ``There is no
question of the secretary-general appointing him as his personal
representative,'' Giuliani said.
   Brunner is being considered for the post, but if appointed, he
would not take the position until next year.
   The peace process is expected to be long and difficult, possibly
lasting years. The direct talks were made possible after Iran and
Iraq both accepted U.N. Security Council Resolution 598, calling
for a cease-fire.
   Before the talks began, Perez de Cuellar held several meetings
with Aziz and Velayati in New York. The warring sides agreed to
hold direct talks following a cease-fire that began Aug. 20.
   The truce appeared to be holding. Saeem Fahmawi, a spokesman for
the 350 U.N. observers monitoring the 733-mile Iraq-Iran warfront,
said in Baghdad there have been no major violations.
   The Iranian and Iraqi delegations in Geneva include political
figures, military representatives and legal experts on war relief,
prisoner repatriation and reparations.
   The agenda was not disclosed, but the secretary-general said the
talks were aimed at carrying out the cease-fire resolution, which
also calls for troop withdrawal to international boundaries, return
of war prisoners, reparations and a comprehensive peace.
   It also calls for an impartial body to determine which side
started the war.
   Repatriation of POWs is any thorny issue. Many of the 80,000 war
prisoners are expected to refuse repatriation because they have
publicly supported the detaining country.

<TEXT>
   U.S. peace activists announced Friday they are
forming an international campaign to secure the release of all
political prisoners in South Korea after two Americans were
arrested for participating in a recent Seoul rally.
   Susan Bailey of the People's Anti-War Mobilization, a New
York-based group that opposes the U.S. military presence in South
Korea, also called for the withdrawal of the 45,000 American troops
stationed there.
   Bailey told a news conference that she and another American,
Charles Scheiner, were arrested Aug. 20 at a rally held five days
earlier by supporters of the movement to unify North and South
Korea.
   ``I was surrounded by plainclothes police on foot,'' Bailey
said. ``They began screaming at us, forcibly grabbed us, picked us
up and threw us in the back seat of unmarked cars.''
   Bailey maintains that she and Scheiner were held by the Seoul
Metropolitan Police and by immigration authorites for 55 hours
without being allowed to contact U.S. Embassy officials, and then
were deported without being charged with a crime.
   South Korean government officials told embassy representatives
that Bailey and Scheiner violated laws prohibiting tourists from
participating in political demonstrations, according to the State
Department.
   Bailey also contends that Young Sook, a South Korean woman who
had served as her hostess and interpreter, was jailed after
authorities charged she was associating with political subversives.
   Bailey, a secretary at the University of Maryland, said her
interpreter's jailing is meant to have a chilling effect on South
Korean political activists.
   ``Clearly, the South Korean government is intent on making an
example out of Young Sook as a way to discourage contact between
the South Korean government and the international community,''
Bailey said.
   Several international human rights organizations, as well as
former U.S. Attorney General Ramsey Clark, are working to secure
Sook's release, Bailey said.
   State Department officials did not have information on Young
Sook's case, and calls to the South Korean embassy in Washington
were not returned immediately.

<TEXT>
   U.S. Sen. Quentin Burdick should make a full
recovery from an operation in which part of his colon was removed
as a precaution against cancer, aides and his doctor said.
   ``We obviously think this will be a short-term problem, but we
feel as the senator recovers and returns to work he will
demonstrate his vigor and vitality,'' Burdick's chief of staff,
David Strauss, said Thursday after the surgery.
   The 80-year-old North Dakota Democrat has served in the Senate
since 1960, when he won a special election, and is running for
re-election this year to a fifth full term. He faces Republican
Earl Strinden in November.
   An 18-inch section of Burdick's colon was removed during a
2{-hour operation at Bethesda Naval Hospital in Maryland, and the
procedure was a ``complete success,'' said Charles Blankenship, who
performed the surgery.
   No cancer was apparent in the excised colon tissue, but tests
will determine if any was present, the doctor said in a telephone
interview.
   Three polyps were removed from Burdick's colon during a routine
screening in July and one was found to be cancerous, according to a
statement issued by Burdick's office.
   There was a slight chance the cancer could have spread to his
lymph nodes, so the section of the colon where the cancerous polyp
was found was removed as a precaution, Blankenship said.
   Following the surgery, Burdick was conscious and appeared
``normal for an 80-year-old man after a major operation,'' the
doctor said.
   Burdick is expected to remain in the hospital for seven to 10
days and resume a full schedule Sept. 7, Strauss said.
   The operation was similar to one President Reagan underwent in
July 1985, when two feet of his colon was removed, Strauss said.
   Burdick has tried to deflect talk about his age and health with
a public relations campaign emphasizing his commitment to fitness.
He has been photographed wearing a karate outfit and once offered
to fight the candidates for the Republican Senate nomination ``toe
to toe, any rules you want.''
   Party activists last year urged Burdick to step down because of
his age in favor of a Senate bid by Rep. Byron Dorgan, D-N.D.
Burdick rejected the idea and eventually won the party's
endorsement after Dorgan declined to challenge him.

   Equipment trucks caused massive traffic jams and
craftsmen spent a week of sleepless nights setting up, but the La
Scala opera company of Italy is ready to open its second tour of
Japan, its director said Friday.
   The Milan-based troupe opens Thursday in Tokyo in an expensive
tour that director Carlo Maria Bandini hopes will promote Italian
opera culture throughout Japan.
   ``In Europe almost all theaters are state-run, with considerable
support coming from the government,'' Bandini said at a news
conference. ``If only the Japanese music scene could receive more
assistance from the state.''
   The month-long, 16-performance tour includes renditions of
Verdi's ``Nabucco,'' ``I Capulet E I Montecchi'' by Bellini, and
Puccini's ``La Boheme'' and ``Turandot.''
   Noted conductors Riccardo Muti, Carlos Kleiber and Lorin Maazel
are conducting the operas. The casts are led by baritone Renato
Bruson, tenor Peter Dvorsky, bass Paul Plishka, and sopranos
Mirella Freni, Ghena Dimitrova and Galia Savova. Film director
Franco Zeffirelli designed the sets for ``La Boheme'' and
``Turandot.''
   ``Teatro Alla Scala,'' known for the grandeur of its huge sets,
sent more than 63 containers of sets, props and equipment that
along with instruments and other supplies required 150 trucks.
   ``When they delivered their loads from Yokohama to Tokyo they
caused a massive traffic jam,'' said Tadatsugu Sasaki, director of
the Japan Performing Arts Foundation, the tour's promoter. ``It's
taking 900 people to set everything up.''
   Most of the performances will be in two halls in Tokyo, with two
performances in Osaka and one in Yokohama.
   The performing arts foundation flew more than 550 performers,
musicians and machinists from Italy, housing them, paying part of
their salaries and giving each a daily allowance of about $200.
   It is also hiring about 200 extras from the local foreign
community to fill out crowd scenes.
   The tour is costing the promoter about $16.5 million, said
Sasaki. But the yen's dramatic rise means this is 2.2 billion yen
today, compared with 4 billion yen three years ago.
   Still, Sasaki says he expects to take a loss. ``We expect to
cover only 1 billion yen ($7.5 million) of the cost through ticket
sales,'' he said. ``We'll try to cover the rest from La Scala and
some kind of assistance from arts foundations and such.''
   Unlike most operas and musicals that tour Japan, La Scala is not
receiving Japanese corporate sponsorship.
   Offers came from ``seven firms ranging from a pharmaceutical
producer to a company that makes rice cookers,'' Sasaki said. ``But
I didn't want a firm to utilize culture just for their own
publicity or to improve their image.''
   In Milan, ticket sales cover about 30 percent of the cost and
the government pays the rest, Bandini said. Opening night tickets
back home go for $750, but the top tickets usually are about $150,
he said.
   Tickets for the Japan performances cost from $90 to $263. If
they cost any more, people could not afford to come, he said.
   ``The Cultural Affairs Agency is not contributing a single
yen,'' Sasaki said. ``But they sure are asking for a lot of
complimentary tickets.''

<TEXT>
   A federal appeals court today upheld contempt
fines against the city of Yonkers for defying an order to
desegregate housing but capped the penalties at $1 million a day,
diminishing the threat of bankruptcy.
   The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals also upheld contempt fines
against the four City Councilmen who voted against the
desegregation plan.
   Previously, U.S. District Court Judge Leonard Sand imposed fines
on the city of $100 that would double daily, quickly going into the
millions and breaking the city's annual budget in less than a month.
   In a 39-page opinion, the appeals court also delayed
reimposition of the fines for seven days to permit the city to seek
an appeal before the U.S. Supreme Court.
   Yonkers Mayor Nicholas C. Wasicsko, who favors accepting Sand's
order, did not immediately return a telephone call today seeking
comment on the ruling.
   Under the new timetable, if the contempt continues, Yonkers
would pay $12,800 next Friday and would reach the $1-million-a-day
cap a week after that, at which time the city would have paid more
than $2.6 million in all. The total would mount by $1 million each
day after that.
   The Yonkers budget for the year, $337 million, would be wiped
out in about 11 months, but the city would face bankruptcy long
before that. A state agency has already taken over the city's
pursestrings, imposing spending restrictions and drafting a
worst-case plan.
   Sand also imposed $500-a-day fines against the four councilmen
and ordered their eventual jailing if they continued to balk at
complying with his ruling.
   Those sanctions were suspended Aug. 9 when the city and the four
councilmen appealed to the 2nd Circuit. If they had not been, the
council members were scheduled to go to jail Aug. 11.
   By Aug. 9, the city had paid $12,700 in fines and each
councilman had paid $3,500.
   In upholding the fines against the four councilman, the
three-judge appeals panel said the threat of jail would resume in
nine days.
   The four councilmen had indicated Thursday they would again vote
once again to defy the courts at a special City Council meeting set
for 2 p.m. today.
   The defiant council members said they hadn't changed their minds
about the desegregation plan, which would create 800 units of
affordable housing throughout the city.
   Sand, who in 1985 found Yonkers liable for 40 years of
segregated housing and schooling, imposed the fines Aug. 2 after
the Council refused by a 4-3 vote to endorse the housing plan.
   The city had argued that Sand's contempt finding and fines were
unfairly punishing Yonkers for the defiance of ``renegade'' council
members who would not change their votes because of the political
consequences.
   Lawyers for the council members, in turn, argued that Sand
exceeded his judicial discretion by ordering members of legislative
body to vote a certain way.
   But the 2nd Circuit concluded that ``under the circumstances of
this case, the recalcitrant council members may be required to vote
to implement the consent judgment, and that the city, in addition
to the council members, may be ... subjected to coercive sanctions
for failure to abide'' with Sand's orders.
   The court ruled that Sand ``acted well within'' his discretion
in starting the fines against the city at $100 a day, but added
that ``at some point, however, the doubling reaches unreasonable
proportions.''
   The appeals court noted: ``under the current schedule the fine
for day 25 is more than $1 billion; the fine for day 30 is more
than $50 billion.''
   The panel said the doubling fines were excessive ``when the
level of each day's fine exceeds $1 million.''

   The Department of Defense announced Friday it
will set up a voting information center where military personnel
can dial in to learn about the top candidates for state and
national offices.
   Callers need only enter a two-letter abbreviation for their home
state to hear recorded two-minute messages from the presidential
and vice presidential candidates, as well 90-second messages from
congressional and gubernatorial candidates.
   The center, located at the headquarters of the Non-Commissioned
Officers Association in Alexandria, Va., will also provide callers
with voter registration assistance and answer any questions not
covered by the taped messages.
   The officer's association has conducted a voter registration
drive on military bases and ships worldwide since January. It
expects to register more than 250,000 servicemen and women,
according to C.R. Jackson, the association's executive vice
president.
   The center will operate from Aug. 29 through Election Day.
   Callers using the Defense Department telephone network will be
able to reach the service by dialing (8) 285-4333 on touch tone
phones or (8) 221-6100 on rotary dial phones.

   Scientists at Oxford University have determined
the Shroud of Turin, said to be the burial cloth of Jesus Christ,
is a fake, the Evening Standard newspaper reported today.
   The newspaper claimed radiocarbon dating tests prove the shroud
was made in about 1350 A.D.
   The 14-foot cloth, kept in Turin Cathedral, bears the image of a
bearded, crucified man.
   The Evening Standard gave no attribution for its report but
quoted Dr. Richard Luckett of Magdalene College, Cambridge
University, as saying: ``I think that as far as seems possible the
scientific argument is now settled and the shroud is a fake.
   ``I suppose there will be certain people who will never want to
believe it, but it seems unlikely these tests could be 1,300
years'' off, Luckett was quoted as saying.
   An official at Magdalene said Luckett had left a message saying
he wouldn't be giving interviews.
   Luckett, whose university is an ancient rival of Oxford, was not
connected with the Oxford tests, but he has been associated with
investigations of its history and examined it in Turin in 1973.
   Tests also were made at the University of Arizona in Tucson and
the Federal Polytechnic in Zurich, Switzerland. All three
institutions agreed to keep their findings secret to enable the
Catholic Church to announce the results in September or early
October.
   Professor Luigi Gonella in Turin, the liasion between Cardinal
Anastasio Ballestrero of Turin and the three laboratories, said
today he had received no word from Oxford and was ``amazed'' by the
report.
   Gonella said Oxford scientists made blind-tests on three samples.
   ``They were asked to date the three samples, not to determine
which of them belongs to the shroud,'' he said.
   Gonella confirmed the Oxford experiments were completed, but he
said the results wouldn't be released until after scientists from
the three laboratories had met to coordinate them.
   Dr. Michael Tite, who supervised the Oxford tests, said: ``The
results from all three centers are now in and are being
coordinated. We are not saying anything because an announcement
will be made in September or early October by Turin via the Vatican
press office.''
   Tite, keeper of the British Museum's research laboratory,
stressed that while each laboratory received three samples of
cloth, they were not told what they were and samples were taken
from the shroud and from medieval and other cloths.
   ``It was blind testing,'' he said.
   The announcement of the results is expected from Cardinal
Ballestrero, who authorized thumbnail-size samples to be cut from
the shroud.
   At Oxford's Research Laboratory for Archaeology and the History
of Art, where the tests were made, a woman on the staff who would
not give her name said: ``No data has been disclosed by this
laboratory.''

<TEXT>
   More than a week of labor unrest is
putting pictures of Lech Walesa and striking Polish workers back
into newspapers and on television screens. Here, in
question-and-answer format, is some background on the unrest:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   Q. What are the issues this time?
   A. In the approximately 20 strikes since Aug. 16, the chief
demand has been to make legal the banned trade union Solidarity,
followed by calls for higher wages.
   Solidarity was suppressed and then outlawed following the
imposition of martial law in Dec. 13, 1981. But it has remained
active, at first mainly as an underground organization but in
recent years more openly as the government has become less
restrictive.
   Poland's faltering economy has given new impetus to strike
actions, and when strikes broke out in April and again this month,
Solidarity activists led the protests.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   Q. What is the state of the economy?
   A. The government this year launched its ``second stage'' of
economic reform that aims to reduce government subsidies, eliminate
inefficient enterprises, give managers more autonomy, remove
obstacles to private enterprise and make wages more dependent on
individual performance.
   Broad price increases were announced as part of the program,
which sent inflation rocketing from about 25 percent a year to
about 60 percent. Wages were raised, too _ even higher than
inflation according to the government _ but many workers felt that
their incomes have not kept up with prices.
   Meanwhile, supplies of consumer goods to the stores have been
even more erratic than usual, partly because of adjustments to the
reform program.
   After a wave of strikes in April and May, the government
announced the price-increase program had been handled poorly and
its top priority now would be controlling inflation and improving
the availability of consumer goods.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   Q. What are the workers' complaints?
   A. Average wages in Poland are low, about $100 a month at the
official rate of exchange. Many industrial workers say they are
forced to work long hours and on weekends just to make ends meet.
About two pounds of meat costs about one day's wages and a color
television about four months' wages.
   Young workers, who have dominated the strikes, want affordable
housng. The waiting period for cooperative apartments can be 20 to
30 years in some parts of the country and private housing is beyond
their means.
   After Solidarity was crushed, the government set up an official
trade union federation which has shown some militancy on behalf of
workers.
   But because the head of the federation is a member of the ruling
Politburo and it tends to be dominated by the party, many workers
do not trust the federation and want Solidarity restored.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   Q. What does Solidarity want?
   A. Legal status and talks with the government about restoring
the economy.
   Solidarity says econmic reform is necessary but it should be
done with the consent and guidance of the workers. But even
Solidarity admits that many of the goals of the reform require
sacrifices.
   While the union wants to encourage economic reform, it also
wants to preserve aspects of the socialized economy that benefit
workers: subsidized housing, generous vacations and cradle-to-grave
security.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   Q. Why won't the government recognize Solidarity?
   A. The government says Solidarity started out with broad popular
support but was hijacked by radicals who oppose Poland's communist
system and is supported by money from abroad. It says the ``former
union'' is now a wholly political group with only about 30,000
supporters nationwide, compared with 10 million members in 1981.
The new official unions, with 7 million members, are the legitimate
representatives of workers, it says.
   The government says it is willing to talk to former Solidarity
members who are interested in constructive change, but not while
they are leading illegal strikes and not if they oppose Poland's
Constitution, which gives the Communist Party the ``leading role''
in Poland.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   Q. What is Lech Walesa's role?
   A. Walesa is Solidarity's national chairman and is keeping in
touch with strikers nationwide while leading the strike at the
Lenin shipyard in Gdansk, where he works as an electrician.
   He has advisers with him in Gdansk, including some intellectuals
like historian Adam Michnik. Other Solidarity activists are running
a nationwide information network to make sure the union's side of
the strike is publicized.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   Q. Why is 1988 different from 1980?
   A. Strikes in Poland this year have not sparked the same degree
of public enthusiasm as in 1980, when virtually the entire nation
went on strike and an unbridled national euphoria gave rise to
Solidarity.
   After the experience of martial law and eight years of economic
decline, the attitude expressed by many Poles, even among some
sympathetic to Solidarity's goals, is ``Strikes are useless. What
good will it do?''

<HEAD>Judge Sides With Unions Fighting for Jobs at Eastern</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TONY WINTON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge today extended his earlier
action to bar Eastern Airlines from firing 4,000 workers and said
he would detail his objections to the company's reorganization and
cutback plans by Tuesday.
   U.S. District Judge Barrington D. Parker issued a terse,
two-page ruling saying that the three unions fighting Eastern's
plans ``are entitled to preliminary injunctive relief.''
   The financially troubled airline, a subsidiary of Texas Air
Corp., said it anticipated an appeal of Parker's actions.
   The scope of the ruling was not immediately clear. Parker's
ruling said a full opinion would be issued setting forth ``the
limits of the the preliminary injunctive relief.'' Earlier this
month, the judge issued a restraining order blocking the carrier's
plans to reduce its service and close its Kansas City hub Sept. 1.
   A spokeswoman for the Miami-based Eastern, Karen Ceremsak, said
in a statement that the company believes the unions ``are not
entitled to relief of any sort and we expect we will be filing an
appeal at the appropriate time.''
   The statement said the airline would take no action against the
employees ``pending clarifications of what our obligation will be
under terms of the ruling.''
   The Eastern plan, announced July 22, also calls for elimination
of 140 of its 1,225 daily flights to trim costs.
   The three unions _ the Airline Pilots Association, the
International Association of Machinists and the Transport Workers
Union _ contend the layoffs can't take place until the carrier
negotiates with its employees under the Railway Labor Act.
   Eastern, which has lost about $1 billion over the last decade,
says the cuts are necessary to prevent further losses.
   The unions allege the reductions are a part of a plan to move
Eastern's assets to Continental Airlines, another subsidiary of
Texas Air Corp.
   At a hearing before Parker earlier this month, union attorneys
produced a draft of a speech that Texas Air Chairman Frank Lorenzo
was to give to Japanese investors in 1986 after Texas Air acquired
Eastern.
   The draft said the purchase of Eastern gave Texas Air a better
bargaining position against its unions. ``Eastern's airplanes can
be repainted and moved over to Continental, where they will be
flown by non-union pilots,'' the speech draft said.
   Lorenzo said the draft was prepared by an investment banking
firm. It was unclear from court testimony whether Lorenzo ever
delivered that portion of the speech.

<HEAD>President Botha Cheered in Visit to Troubled Shantytown</HEAD>
<NOTE>With LaserPhoto</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By LAURINDA KEYS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CROSSROADS, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President P.W. Botha was cheered
and serenaded Friday as he toured a black shantytown once targeted
for demolition and now being upgraded following battles that ousted
anti-apartheid activists.
   Botha, who has visited only a handful of black towns during his
10 years in power, opened a new job-training center for the
township near Cape Town and inspected a housing project on land
formerly controlled by squatters who opposed the government.
   Botha extolled the example set by appointed mayor, Johnson
Ngxobongwana, the leader of the ``vigilantes'' from the oldest
section of Crossroads who burned out the militant squatters in 1986.
   ``I'm encouraged by your positive attitude, which can serve as
an example ... for other communities to get similar facilities,''
Botha said.
   He stopped at a job-training center where Ngxobongwana welcomed
him ``in the name of all Crossroads residents.'' The president
briefly played a xylophone and listened while a choir sang in his
honor, ``Thank you _ we accept you as our leader.''
   Scores of people were killed and 70,000 squatters left homeless
during the 1986 factional fighting. The conflict left Nxgobongwana
in control, and last year Crossroads was declared a township _ the
first time since it was established in 1974 that its residents were
not classified as squatters.
   Millions of blacks live in squatter camps elsewhere, and the
government has drafted legislation making it easier for authorities
to evict them.
   The government is building new homes for some of Ngxobongwana's
supporters, who make up a majority of Crossroads' estimated 120,000
residents. Many of his displaced opponents have moved where the
authorities wanted them, into a vast township called Khayelitsha,
farther from Cape Town.
   Botha, accompanied by his wife, Elize, and daughter, Rozanne,
concluded his visit with a half-hour drive past Crossroads' shacks.
He inspected a house under construction, and spread mortar with a
trowel. Later, he shook the hand of a boy who ran alongside his car.
   Botha said the employment center exemplified his government's
attempts to develop black areas.
   ``To boycott is easy, but it leads nowhere,'' Botha told about
200 people in the center. ``To cooperate is sometimes difficult and
to take responsibility sometimes difficult. But history remembers
only those who build, not those who destroy.''
   The center is used to train unemployed people in carpentry,
bricklaying, sewing and other skills. Botha said 800,000 people
have been trained at such facilities since 1984.
   ``I hope those who are only trying to belittle our country will
also come and see what can be done if they leave us alone,'' Botha
said.
   Sen. Paul Simon, D-Ill., on a five-day South African visit, made
a simultaneous tour of Crossroads. He is a strong supporter of
economic sanctions to protest South Africa's apartheid policies of
racial segregation.
   Since Crossroads began to grow in 1974, it was visited regularly
by police, bulldozers and eviction agents.
   Each time the shacks were smashed, they reappeared in a
different sandy field. Each time truckloads of women and children
were driven away to rural homelands, separated from their menfolk
who worked in Cape Town, thousands more families arrived. By 1986,
an estimated 200,000 blacks lived in its slums.
   ``Crossroads at a certain stage was seen almost as the starting
point of the revolution,'' Information Minister Stoffel van der
Merwe said Thursday. ``It is significant that the state president
is visiting there and no abnormal security will be necessary. It is
symbolic.''
   Its troubled history centered around the government's former
policy that mixed-race people had preference over blacks for jobs
in the Cape Town region, and that blacks lived there only as
temporary workers.
   Crossroads was born as a result of the government's attempt to
remove several ``black spots'' where blacks lived illegally.
   In 1984, Botha abandoned the idea that the Cape should be a
job-preference area for mixed-race people and promised a halt to
forced removals for separation purposes. Raids and demolitions
continued under slum clearance and anti-squatting laws.
   A Cape Town court is hearing the first of more than 3,000 damage
suits by those who lost their homes in 1986. They contend police
helped the vigilantes.
   Jan van Eck, an anti-apartheid member of Parliament, said of
Crossroads, ``The black community that rejects an Archbishop
(Desmond) Tutu and accepts into its midst the oppressor, Mr. P.W.
Botha, is far removed from the rest of the oppressed people of
South Africa.''
   He was referring to graffiti near the main entrance to
Crossroads that says: ``No entry for Tutu'' _ the black Anglican
leader who won the 1984 Nobel Peace Prize for his anti-apartheid
campaign.

<TEXT>
   Representatives from 10 island nations in the South
Pacific and related organizations began talks Friday to strengthen
ties and to find ways to cooperate with Japan.
   It was the first such conference held in Japan since World War
II, said Takeju Ogata, general manager of the Sasakawa Peace
Foundation, which sponsored the two-day meeting that drew 46
representatives.
   ``The nations of the Pacific island region hold great potential
across the broad spectrum of political, economic, and cultural
endeavors, and in recent years, the world's attentions for this
region have risen,'' Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita said in a
message read to the gathering.
   Heads of state or ministers from Fiji, Kiribati, Micronesia,
Papua New Guinea, the Solomon Islands, Tonga, Tuvalu, Vanuatu,
Western Samoa and the Cook Islands and officials and
representatives from eight other countries including Australia, New
Zealand, Indonesia and France met in a Tokyo hotel.
   Tuilaepa Sailele, finance minister of Western Samoa, said in a
speech that the Pacific region ``is becoming the focus of
superpower rivalry.''
   ``With the declaration of this decade as the `decade of the
Pacific,' it is certainly opportune that we ought to gather here to
debate its future development,'' he said.
   About 450 people, including 150 invited guests and officials of
the Japanese government and businesses, attended Friday's session,

<HEAD>Tokyo Exchange Says Employees Bought Stock After Deal Leaked</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TETSUO JIMBO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Tokyo Stock Exchange said Friday that 34
employees of Nippon Steel Co. and Sankyo Seiki Manufacturing Co.
bought more than 68,000 shares of Sankyo stocks before the
companies announced a major deal.
   ``There was apparently a leak of insider information,'' said
Takao Nojiri, a senior managing director of the exchange. ``We will
issue a strict warning to both companies and request them to submit
their report on the cause of the leak and measures they will
implement to avoid recurrence of such a case.''
   Fifteen workers of Sankyo, a precision-machinery maker, and 19
workers of Nippon Steel, the world's largest steel maker, each
purchased an average of 2,000 shares of Sankyo as early as four
months before the announcement, the exchange said.
   After markets closed July 29, the companies announced an
agreement on Nippon Steel's acquisition of a large stake of Sankyo.
   About a week before the announcement, the share price of Sankyo
began skyrocketing. The exchange suspected major insider trading
and launched an unusually thorough investigation.
   On the day of the announcement, volume of Sankyo shares traded
on the Tokyo Stock Exchange soared as much as 10 times the previous
day's, leading the exchange to take an unusual measure of
suspending the transaction of Sankyo shares in the afternoon
session.
   Under the current Japanese securities law, neither the companies
nor workers will be a subject of criminal charges.
   Scandals involving stock dealings in recent months intensified
pressure on the Tokyo market to upgrade its ethical standards to
that of the Western countries and forced the Finance Ministry to
revise the Securities and Exchange Law.
   Parliament recently passed a law allowing the Finance Ministry
and the exchange a greater investigatory power. The law was
partially implemented Tuesday.
   A provision enabling securities authorities to press criminal
charges on insider trading will not take effect until next April.
   ``We have to implement the new law step by step to make it
work,'' said Kazuo Futagawa of the Finance Ministry's securities
bureau.
   The exchange also said some of the 34 employees of Nippon and
Sankyo were directly involved in coordinating the agreement, but
officials refused to give the exact number and their names.
   ``Under the current law, those individuals did not violate any
law and we cannot say they were involved in insider trading,'' said
Nojiri.
   ``The purpose of our investigation is not to pinpoint the people
but to find out if there was a lack of appropriate control of
information within those companies and make them to correct it,''
he said.
   Hitoshi Shimakura, the exchange's director of the transaction
review department, said some of the employees bought more than
5,000 shares before the deal was announced. But he added: ``We
would rather not go into details of what individuals did.''
   He also said the exchange will not release the names of
individuals to their employers.
   Nippon president Yutaka Saito met the chairman of the exchange,
Michio Takeuchi, on Thursday and expressed regret for his
employees' wrongdoing.

   The Tennessee Valley Authority is
scrapping its employee suggestion program until somebody can
suggest a more economical way to run it.
   TVA set up the program last fall to encourage cost-saving ideas,
but the operation cost the federal utility more to administer than
it saved.
   ``The idea of the program was good, but what we ended up with
was a bureaucratic, convoluted system that took so long to review
the suggestions that it proved to be ineffective,'' said Sue
Wallace, acting director of TVA's human resources department.
   TVA received nearly 1,000 suggestions from employees over 10
months, including 46 that collectively saved about $580,000. Ten
percent of that savings was paid to the employees as a bonuses for
their ideas.
   The problem was that TVA spent about $700,000 on the program,
including $514,000 in staff expenses, said Ms. Wallace.
   Among other things, there was a two-inch-thick handbook of rules
specifying who and what could be included in the program to qualify
for the bonuses.
   TVA directors voted earlier this week to end the program, and a
group of managers and employees is working on a new system.

   The Indiana State Fair has changed a lot
since Lincoln D. Stafford attended his first one, in 1915, when he
had to hoe corn on his grandfather's farm to make money to go the
big event.
   ``I worked a whole 10 days for $5. I spent $4.95 the last day
(at the fair) and went home with a nickel,'' Stafford said this
week at the fairgrounds.
   Stafford, now 90 and pastor at the Gospel Chapel in Linton, says
it's amusing to hear today's fairgoers complain about the lack of
air conditioning at the fairgrounds.
   ``It hadn't been invented when I first came,'' he said.
   The content of the fairs also has changed during the last seven
decades.
   ``A lot of the focus was on different sports _ baseball, horse
pulls, basketball _ and other farm-related contests,'' he said.
   But there's been an even a more dramatic change in the fairgoers.
   ``I like to study people at the fair,'' Stafford said. ``And in
1915, people wore clothes. Now they don't.''

<HEAD>Sweden: Haven For Refugees, Sanctuary For Spies</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Spy Ring, Bjt</HEAD>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Swedes are proud to have sheltered
political refugees from all over the world, but now they're finding
their hospitality abused by spies and terrorists, officials say.
   Fifteen or 20 international terrorists may be moving to Sweden
every year to find sanctuary under false identities, police say.
They are among thousands of immigrants or refugees seeking asylum.
   ``The many terrorists we have in this country is the price we
pay for our open society,'' said Krister Hansen, head of the
anti-terrorist section of the Security Police.
   In a recent book titled ``Espionage in Sweden,'' several leading
defense writers claim that neutral Sweden is becoming a playground
in the game of East-West espionage. The Soviet KGB keeps about 100
agents here, while the CIA has about 10, the book said.
   This week, Swedish police arrested two Hungarian-born Swedes
suspected of being couriers for an international spy ring working
against NATO. The ring is alleged to be headed by a former American
army sergeant in West Germany.
   Sandor Kercsik, 48, and Imre Kercsik, 34, were arraigned in
court Friday. Prosecutors said they came to Sweden in the 1960s.
   Both doctors, they prospered and were well-liked by their
neighbors, who said they were stunned to learn that the brothers
were agents of the Hungarian intelligence service.
   In another case this summer, police raided the home of a
Palestinian businessman and uncovered documents indicating he was a
senior commander of the Abu Nidal terrorist organization.
   Samir Mohammed Khadar married a Finnish-born Swede and moved
here two years ago. He traveled frequently, but led an otherwise
unremarkable life in a Stockholm suburb.
   In July, Khadar was blown apart by a bomb in Athens. The
explosion was linked to an assault by a terrorist squad a few hours
later on the City of Poros cruise ship which killed nine people and
wounded about 90.
   Before leaving on his fatal mission, Khadar had stashed away a
supply of weapons in a forest north of Stockholm, which police said
could have been used to attack the nearby Arlanda international
airport or an embassy in the city.
   Hansen told the Svenska Dagbladet newspaper this week that eight
of every 10 people seeking political asylum arrive at Arlanda
airport without passports, and police cannot be sure who they
really are.
   After years of large-scale immigration, Sweden may have 25,000
residents whose real identities are unknown, he said. Many could be
common criminals.
   ``It is not generally done to have a security check'' on
prospective immigrants, said Marie Andersson of the Immigration
Ministry. ``It's up to the police to decide.''
   A newcomer is asked his name and birth date, is photographed and
fingerprinted, and within hours can have a new identity.
   Last year, 16,000 people came to Sweden seeking asylum, and
another 12,000 immigrated for other reasons. It can take up to two
years to process the application, and during that time the newcomer
lives at the government's expense.
   People like Khadar and the Kercsik brothers are able to relocate
in Sweden because of a tradition of open doors.
   During World War II, Sweden accepted Jews and other refugees
fleeing the Nazi onslaught. Later, Hungarians came after the 1956
invasion of their country, as did Czechs after 1968.
   Independence-seeking Kurds fleeing homes in Iran or Iraq also
came. Some belonged to the shadowy Kurdish People's Party which had
been involved in terrorism. Sweden refused them asylum, but did not
deport them to their native countries where they risked execution.
   Members of the Kurdish group have been suspects in the unsolved
1986 assassination of Swedish Prime Minister Olof Palme, although
no one has been prosecuted in the case.
   Until the 1970s Sweden encouraged immigration to fill jobs. ``No
one talked about terrorism until then,'' Ms. Andersson said in an
interview.
   ``Even when we didn't need the workers any more, the legislation
never changed and the flow of refugees increased,'' she said.
   Now, despite the recent incidents, an overhaul of the system is
unlikely.
   ``Everyone is very proud of our generous policy. I don't think
the politicians want to change it,'' said Ms. Andersson.

   A crash that disrupted Long Island Rail
Road service will cost the commuter rail system an estimated $2.6
million, a spokeswoman said Friday.
   The railroad should be back on a normal schedule Saturday. A
train Thursday night rammed a tractor-trailer rig stuck at a
crossing. Train service was canceled on one branch of the railroad.
   Eighteen people were injured, none seriously.
   The LIRR expected to repair damaged tracks and remove the
derailed cars by late Friday or early Saturday, according to
spokeswoman Susan McGowan.
   Ms. McGowan said Friday's morning rush hour went as well as
could be expected.
   ``There wasn't much confusion,'' she said, adding that commuters
used another branch of the LIRR and buses.
   A witness to the crash said the driver of the tractor-trailer
rig frantically tried to warn the train but then stood clear as the
locomotive slammed into his flatbed trailer, which was carrying a
bulldozer.
   The collision caused the engine to flip on its side, spilling
diesel fuel. The engine and the second car ended up in a lumberyard
adjacent to the tracks, Ms. McGowan said.
   Three other cars derailed and two cars that were being stored on
a siding were sideswiped and derailed, she added.
   LIRR spokesman Mike Charles said investigators would try to
determine why the train did not stop in time. Among the questions,
he said, is how fast it was going and ``whether or not indeed the
truck driver did try to flag the train down.''

<HEAD>Former Alderman Who Ran Against Daley Dies</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Robert E. Merriam, a former alderman who lost to
Richard J. Daley in the 1955 mayoral race and then became adviser
to three presidents, has died of a heart attack. He was 69.
   Merriam, who died at home Thursday, also wrote ``Dark
December,'' a popular account of his Army recollections of the
World War II Battle of the Bulge.
   The son of a reform alderman and 1911 mayor candidate, Merriam
switched to the Republican Party in 1947 and was elected alderman
of the 5th Ward.
   After he lost to Daley in the 1955 race by more than 125,000
votes, Merriam remained an outspoken critic of the mayor and his
patronage system. Daley remained in office from 1955 until his
death in 1976.
   Merriam also came to the attention of President Dwight D.
Eisenhower, who appointed him assistant director of the Bureau of
the Budget. He later served under presidents Richard Nixon and
Gerald Ford as chairman of the President's Advisory Commission on
Intergovernmental Affairs.
   He also was executive vice president for Urban Investment &
Development Co. from 1971 to 1976, when he became partner in
Alexander Proudfoot and Co., a consulting firm.
   He is survived by his wife, Marguerite; two daughters; and a
son. Funeral arrangements were pending.

<TEXT>
   A Greek freighter left for its next port
still carrying seven Korean crewmen who wanted off because they
didn't like the food.
   The Koreans had complained of mistreatment to Savannah's port
chaplain, saying the Greek food served on board deprived them of
the vegetables and rice to which they are accustomed, said the
chaplain, the Rev. Mario Balbi.
   The seamen sent a telex to the ship's owner asking for
permission to leave because of ``suffering conditions,'' but there
was no response from Good Faith Shipping Co. of Greece before the
refrigerated cargo ship left Wednesday for Tunisia, Balbi said.
   ``They are now out in the middle of the ocean,'' the chaplain
said Thursday. ``I don't know if they will hear back from the owner
at sea or when they arrive in Tunisia.''
   Without permission to leave, the seamen would not have been paid
the wages owed them and could not have afforded to return home.
   The ship's captain and top officers are Greek, and Balbi said
the Korean crewmen told him the captain bought only Greek food each
time the ship called on ports in various countries, including
Greece, Turkey, Algeria and the United States.
   The Atlantic, with a crew of 25, docked in Savannah on Monday.
Balbi said the ship's master would not discuss the complaints with
him.

   Sen. Dan Quayle conceded today that a
portion of his resume indicating he spent two years as the chief
consumer investigator for the Indiana Attorney General's office is
``inaccurate.''
   Quayle said he did not know how the error occurred, but that his
staff was responsible for putting together his resume.
   Quayle's official Senate biography states that from 1970 to
1971, he was the ``chief investigator'' for the Consumer Protection
Division of the Indiana Attorney General's office.
   But The (Cleveland) Plain Dealer reported today that Quayle
actually held that position for only two and one-half months.
   ``If it indicated that, that is inaccurate. I didn't hold that
job for two years,'' Quayle told reporters aboard his campaign
plane.
   He acknowledged that he held the job for ``several months'' but
said he did not have ``an exact time frame.''
   The paper said he was an entry-level research assistant for most
of his time in the office.
   Earlier, Quayle press secretary David Prosperi called the
newspaper report ``a cheap shot'' and said, ``He held the office.
He worked his way up to that position and that's that.''
   Prosperi said he was not sure how many months Quayle had held
the consumer protection job, but added, ``The important point is
that he held the job. He didn't make it up.''
   The Plain Dealer said the consumer protection division didn't
even exist in 1970, and Quayle had already gone to work in the
governor's office when it was officially opened.
   ``He just helped set it up,'' said Robert E. Lybrook, a
Martinsville, Ind., lawyer who became the chief investigator when
the division officially opened for business in September 1971.
   ``He wasn't chief of anything when he went over there,'' added
M. Stanton Evans, a former editor at the Indianapolis News who
arranged Quayle's job interview with then-Attorney General Theodore
L. Sendak.
   The Plain Dealer said state records show that Quayle went to
work in the attorney general's office as a ``legal assistant'' in
January 1970. It said the job is similar to that of a law clerk and
involved drafting memoranda, performing research and writing
letters.
   The newspaper said Quayle held the investigator's job for 2{
months but that state records show he already was working for
then-Gov. Edgar Whitcomb as an administrative assistant when the
consumer division was officially launched.
   Quayle had completed campaigning for the day when the Plain
Dealer story appeared and neither he nor his aides were immediately
available to comment.
   Quayle's campaign moves west today to Montana, Utah and
California.
   Quayle's claim to have been chief investigator is contained in
his Senate biography, which is being distributed as official
background by the Republican campaign.
   The latest disclosures came just as Quayle and Republican
presidential nominee George Bush were seeing a week-long dispute
about Quayle's military record begin to dissipate.
   During his campaign appearances Thursday, Quayle aimed his pitch
at farmers in Missouri and South Dakota.
   In stops at state fairs in both states, Quayle met with farmers
and told them: ``Don't let anybody ever tell you that America is
not still dependent on agriculture and the farmers for our quality
of life.''
   He called the trade bill signed into law recently and whose
principal architect was his Democratic counterpart, Sen. Lloyd
Bentsen, ``a good first step to send a message that we are very
serious about trade,'' but promised stronger farm legislation next
year to enhance exports and make agricultural goods more
competitive.
   Quayle was asked in press encounters about his vote last month
against establishing a Cabinet-level position for the Veterans
Administration.
   Quayle on Monday told a veterans group his vote on the VA issue
was a ``youthful indiscretion,'' but he said at a news conference
Thursday in Boonville, Mo. that he did not regret his vote.
   But his comments seemed to leave room for doubt as to whether he
thought the vote was a mistake: ``Perhaps my vote was not the right
vote. I still think it's the right vote and I stand by my record.''
   Bentsen suggested Wednesday that Quayle is not mature enough to
be in a job a heartbeat away from the presidency.
   ``I am qualified, if that situation arises,'' Quayle said,
adding that he is an expert on national defense and security issues.
   He called this year's drought-relief package ``a good bill''
that he voted for, but did not respond to questions about why he
opposed some drought relief measures in earlier years. ``I stand on
my record,'' he said, when asked about the earlier votes.
   Quayle's candidacy has been dogged by questions about whether he
pulled strings to avoid the draft and enter the National Guard
during the Vietnam War. He has denied using any ``undue influence.''
   Quayle's aides insisted that the draft controversy had faded.
   The candidate was greeted in Columbia by a contingent of
supporters, but some opponents in the crowd chanted ``Quayle's a
chicken'' and others displayed signs reading ``Sissy Rich Boy,''
``Dump Quayle'' and ``War Wimp.''

   L. Lozhnikov, 58, the vessel's alternate captain, apparently

   Tass did not say how fast the hydrofoil was traveling.

   President Reagan's allergist reports there is
``no essential change'' in his condition after an annual checkup,
White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said today.
   Reagan, who gets a weekly shot to control his reaction to
pollen, met Thursday with his long-time allergist, Dr. Ralph
Bookman.
   ``It was routine,'' the spokesman said.
   Reagan also was scheduled to be seen by Dr. John House for an
ear, nose and throat checkup.
   ``There are no problems that we are aware of at this point. It
should be a routine check,'' the spokesman said.
   The examinations are conducted in the president's penthoue suite
at the plush Century Plaza Hotel.
   Reagan is spending a week of his August vacation here with his
wife Nancy.
   They are to return to their ranch near Santa Barbara on Saturday.
   The spokesman said the White House, holding to past practice,
would not release the detailed results of the examinations.
   Reagan spent two days this week trying to rev up his
conservative California followers for Vice President George Bush.
   Other than attending a series of private dinners with long-time
friends, the president has been secluded in his penthouse tower.
   For her part, the first lady has been overseeing the
refurbishment of the home in Bel-Air that the couple plans to
inhabit after leaving the White House.
   But so far, Fitzwater said Reagan apparently has no plans to see
the house during this visit to Los Angeles.
   The spokesman, asked why the president appeared to be
disinterested in a home he'll live in, said, ``He probably is
interested.''
   ``I don't know what his familiarity is with the house,''
Fitzwater said, adding that he knows the president is familiar with
the neighborhood.
   The $2.5 million ranch-style home is owned by Wall Management
Services, a group of about 20 unidentified Reagan friends who
bought it with the Reagans in mind, according to Mrs. Reagan's
spokeswoman, Elaine Crispen.
   The three-year lease gives the Reagans the option to renew the
lease or purchase the property.
   The extate includes 1.4 acres of grounds and a 35-year-old house
with 7,192 sware feet of living space, as well as a pool.
   More than any other vacation trip, Reagan has devoted time to
helping boost Bush's quest for the White House, as well as the
campaign coffers of state Republican candidates.
   On Tuesday, Reagan traveled to Orange County for a $500-a-plate
GOP fundraiser for Sen. Pete Wilson, R-Calif., and one day later
appeared with Bush at a pep rally on Wednesday.
   Reagan is scheduled to attend two more fundraisers on Saturday
on his way north to his 688-acre ranch in the Santa Ynez Mountains.

   When his company's trucks kept
being stolen, Norman Asch called the doctor _ the witchdoctor.
   Asch, an executive of a Johannesburg paper and packaging firm,
said electronic alarms failed to prevent the theft of four company
trucks in the past two years.
   ``Someone suggested I try a witchdoctor. I was very skeptical
but I believe that if you don't understand something, you should at
least have respect for it,'' Asch told The Star, a Johannesburg
daily that reported the story Thursday.
   A witchdoctor was brought from Tzaneen, a rural center 220 miles
northeast of Johannesburg.
   ``He poured some liquid into various parts of the vehicles and
marked the underside of some other parts,'' Asch said. ``He left a
small, plastic doll hanging from each rear-view mirror.''
   Asch said none of the company's vehicles has been stolen for the
past six months.

   The new army chief told military

   Gen. Aslam Beg said the Aug. 17 plane crash that killed Zia was

   He stopped short of laying blame, but pointed to warnings from
Moscow and New Delhi in the days preceding the crash of the C-130
transport plane. Also killed were U.S. Ambassador Arnold Raphel, a
U.S. Army general and 27 others.
   The Soviet Union said Aug. 13 it would not tolerate Pakistan's
continued support of anti-communist guerrillas in Afghanistan.
Indian Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi warned Pakistan on Aug. 15 over
its alleged aid to Sikh separatists in western India.
   Beg was the No. 2 man on the army staff, which was headed by
Zia. He said the armed forces had no desire to meddle in politics,
APP reported.
   Beg said he and the armed services chiefs agreed to form an
emergency council with acting President Ghulam Ishaq Khan to
maintain law and order until after general elections on Nov. 16.
   ``We accepted the responsibility for the sole reason that no one
was (to be) allowed to exploit the situation to meet his nefarious
designs of harming the country,'' Beg was quoted as saying.
   Ishaq Khan, former senate chairman, promised to continue
preparations for the Nov. 16 polls. He said he had no objection to
candidates running as political parties.
   Zia, who seized power in a 1977 military coup, banned party
tickets in 1985 elections, prompting a boycott by most opposition
groups.
   He allowed formation of a civilian government among those who
did participate, but fired it last May for alleged corruption and
incompetence.
   Ishaq Khan's interpretation of the election rules has given new
hope to political leaders such as Benazir Bhutto of the
left-leaning Pakistan People's Party and to former Prime Minister
Mohammad Khan Junejo of the center-right Muslim League.
   The Movement for the Restoration of Democracy, an opposition
alliance that includes Ms. Bhutto's party, scheduled a rally for
Saturday in the southwestern city of Quetta.
   U.S. and Pakistani investigators continued to try to figure out
what made Zia's plane explode and crash.
   Ishaq Khan, Beg and others have said they are convinced it was
sabotage but have withheld comment on how it was done or by whom.

<HEAD>Death Toll Rises to 981, Legislator Beaten to Death</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   An earthquake that devastated parts of
Nepal and India earlier this week has killed more than 980 people,
officials from the two countries said Friday.
   Mourners paraded through the streets of this medieval town,
calling for revenge after a former legislator was beaten to death
by political rivals while he was distributing relief supplies to
earthquake victims.
   ``Hang the murderers,'' scores of young men chanted as they
marched in front of a jeep bearing the battered body of Karna
Hyanju, once a sympathizer of the now-outlawed Communist Party.
   Witnesses said Hyanju was beaten with umbrellas and sticks late
Thursday afternoon, then dragged through the streets for nearly two
hours before police intervened. He died Friday at the Bir hospital
in Katmandu, 7 miles west of Bhaktapur.
   Uttam Dhaubanjar, a 28-year-old bank employee and neighbor of
the dead man, said Hyanju had been handing out blankets, milk and
other food in Bhaktapur when he was accosted by a group of men who
accused him of giving relief supplies only to his own supporters.
   Reports of damage and devastation continued to arrive from
remote parts of Nepal on Friday, and the Home Affairs Ministry
updated its confirmed death toll to 704.
   In India, the official count rose to 277. But survivors, the
news media and opposition politicians say the toll could be as high
as 1,500.
   Sunday's earthquake registered 6.5 on the Richter scale, which
records energy released by a tremor according to ground motion
measured by a seismograph. A reading of 6 indicates the possibility
of severe damage, while 7 signifies a major quake.
   Dhaubanjar said he saw about 40 people rounded up by police
Thursday night after Hyanju's beating death. He said many belonged
to the same Communist faction that Hyanju once supported.
   ``People started beating him with umbrellas,'' Dhaubanjar said.
``There were a lot of scratches on his body, and a lot of blood. It
looked like one ear was missing. Then they made a necklace of their
shoes (by tying the laces together), put it around his neck and
pulled him through the streets.''
   As Hyanju's body was taken through the winding streets of
Bhaktapur, a 12th-century town of ancient Hindu temples, thousands
of the town's 50,000 people jammed streets, temple steps and the
balconies of brick and mud houses.
   Pashupati Rana, one of several Cabinet ministers who marched in
the funeral procession, said several people were arrested in the
killing, including the mayor, the deputy mayor and a member of the
Rashtriya Panchayat, or non-partisan assembly.
   Rana, who is minister of local development and legislative,
affairs, called Hyanju's death ``political murder.''
   Hyanju served in the Panchayat from 1981 until 1986 when he lost
the backing of the Communists in Bhaktapur, traditionally a leftist
stronghold.
   The Panchayat, whose members are elected on non-party lines, was
created after the late king Mahendra abolished the old Parliament
and all political parties in 1960, saying a Western-style
parliamentary system was not suited to his mountain kingdom.
   Dhaubanjar and a group of young men who gathered around him said
Hyanju was perceived as a government supporter despite his previous
communist leanings.

<HEAD>Massive Locust Plague Expected To Hit Africa</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ROME (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Dense bands of locust larvae will ``explode'' into
massive swarms in the next two weeks in central and east Africa,
and the insects will inflict severe damage on crops, a U.N. agency
said Friday.
   ``The extent of infestation in certain African countries is
enormous, and we are extremely concerned,'' said Edouard Saouma,
director-general of the U.N. Food and Agricultural Organization.
``There is no doubt that there will be heavy damage to crops in the
middle of the agricultural season.''
   Lukas Brader, head of the agency's emergency center for locust
operations, said that 14 million to 17 million acres of land in
Chad, Sudan and Niger are infested with dense bands of locust
larvae.
   ``They are going to explode in the next two weeks and form
massive swarms which will affect large areas of agricultural
lands,'' he said, adding that the size of each swarm could cover
hundreds of square miles.
   ``The plague has reached unprecedented proportions and cannot be
controlled in the near future,'' Brader said.
   Heavy rains, particulary in Sudan, have created favorable
breeding conditions for the locusts. While the situation has been
serious for several weeks in Chad and Sudan, the problem has
worsened sharply in Niger recently with about 4.2 million acres
infested, the FAO said.

   Jeff Pitman is blind, but he sails for the same
reasons sighted people do: fresh air, warm sunshine and the feel of
the wind at his back.
   ``You don't need eyes to sail,'' he says, ``as long as you can
feel the wind and know where it's going to take you.''
   Pitman's not just optimistic. Sighted volunteers who accompany
blind sailors in a program held at marinas in the Charlestown and
South Boston sections of Boston corroborate his claims.
   ``I've learned more from them, I haven't taught them a thing,''
said Harry McDonough, 68, a former champion sailor whose Courageous
Sailing Center sponsors the 10-year-old program with the Carroll
Center for the Blind in Newton. It is believed to be the only
organized sailing program for the blind in the country.
   McDonough was inspired to help teach the blind to sail as a
result of his own experiences learning to sail. At age 4, he said,
his father taught him to sail blindfolded so he would learn to
better sense the wind and gain balance.
   ``It's more about feel and balance than sight,'' McDonough said
on a recent Saturday while he motored around Boston Harbor checking
on the blind sailors. ``I always said that someday I'd teach the
blind to sail _ and it works.''
   ``When you sail, you sail in relation to the wind,'' said
volunteer guide John Trickett, 29. ``All the key factors about
sailing have nothing to do with sight.''
   Visually impaired people from all over New England participate
in the sailing program. The cost is $1 per season. Most have never
been on a small boat when they step gingerly onto the vessels.
   ``When I first went out I was a little scared the whole boat was
going to tip over with me in it,'' said Gil Busch. ``But now I
don't have that feeling anymore. I just enjoy it.''
   Rose Prescott, 41, a rehabilitation counselor blind since age 5,
and Melinda Conrad, 41, who is legally blind, travel by bus from
Concord, N.H., every weekend to sail.
   ``We may not beat anyone else out here but we have fun,'' said
Conrad. ``Our friends think we're a little crazy but then they know
that we'll try anything. We go cross-country skiing, we went to
Jamaica and London. We like being outdoors.''
   Prescott said she was a little fearful at first.
   ``All they say out here is `Rose!' _ to let me know I should do
something,'' said Prescott. ``I kind of fill in the blanks and
figure out what should be done.''
   Volunteers sail in boats with the blind sailors, teaching
novices how to trim the sails, how to tack and reminding them not
to try to sail against the wind. For those with some experience,
the guides are there merely to tell the blind sailors if other
boats are coming or if they are too near shore.
   ``To be a good sailor you need to be in harmony with the wind
and the waves and the boat,'' said Arthur O'Neill, who directs the
program for the Carroll Center.
   Heather Schroder, 27, a volunteer guide, said she was doubtful
the blind could sail when she heard about the program. But she was
soon convinced.
   ``It doesn't matter whether you're blind or not,'' she said.
``You just need a good instructor.''
   The blind sailors sail every Saturday either at the Courageous
Sailing Center at the Charlestown Navy Yard or in the protected
waters of Pleasure Bay off Castle Island in South Boston.
   At the end of the summer, they participate in a special regatta.
The rules are simple: One sighted volunteer accompanies each blind
sailor in a boat but the volunteer is not allowed to touch anything
during the race. He or she is allowed only to warn of hazards.
   ``This isn't going to make them to be Olympic sailors,'' said
McDonough. ``We're just teaching them something to love that they
otherwise would never get a chance to do.''

<HEAD>Crew Outraged at Construction Site Drug Search</HEAD>

   More than 200 workers at a city construction
project were forced to kneel before drug-sniffing dogs or lose
their jobs, an experience one angry union official likened to
slavery.
   Municipal officials and representatives of the project's
construction manager said Thursday that the Aug. 18 search at the
city's $81 million Morton H. Meyerson Symphony Center turned up
nothing.
   ``When they make you get down in front of an animal on your
knees, that's getting back into slavery,'' said Bill Hawkins,
business manager of Ironworkers Local 481.
   Bruce Lady, senior vice president for J.W. Bateson Co., the
company that is serving as construction manager, said he and other
managers knew about the search and submitted to it.
   Workers and managers were invidually taken to a room and asked
to squat on one knee while a dog sniffed them.
   The search, which involved more than 200 workers, was undertaken
after a former employee reported that drugs were allegedly being
used at the construction site. ``The construction industry has a
certain amount of risk and danger to it, and that has to be
controlled,'' Lady said.
   Clifford Keheley, Dallas Public Works director, said he
authorized the search the day before it was conducted without
consulting any other city officials.
   ``They wanted our concurrence and we, of course, gave it
immediately,'' Keheley said. ``I would have seen a bigger problem
of not doing it. If there's any suspicion at all of illegal
activity on that site, we don't want it.''
   Several workers said they would gladly have submitted to blood
tests or other samples if there had been probable cause to suspect
drug use.
   ``This is the only major construction job going on (in Dallas)
right now _ and if you didn't submit to that search, you got kicked
off your job,'' Scott Alcox, a 28-year-old flagman, said. ``It is
degrading to have to get down on your knees to keep your job.''

   The owner of an illegal basement nightclub where
six people died in a fire was arrested at a pay phone after police
traced a call he made to a detective to assert his innocence,
authorities said Friday.
   Domingo Reyes, 37, was charged Thursday with six counts of
manslaughter and 10 of reckless endangerment in the blaze at the
Bronx club known as The Hole, said Deputy Chief Daniel Ryan.
   The Fire Department said the blaze Sunday appeared to be
accidental, but Reyes was held responsible because the club was
illegally operated, authorities said.
   The club served liquor without a license and did not have enough
exits, officials said.
   Six patrons were killed and 33 others injured. The reckless
endangerment counts relate to the 10 most seriously injured, Ryan
said.
   Reyes was arrested after he called police, ran out of change and
gave the number to a detective who promised to call back, said
Ryan. The detective kept him on the line for 35 minutes while
police used the number to locate the phone.
   ``Reyes was explaining (to the detective) he didn't think he'd
done anything wrong,'' said Ryan. ``Basically, he was protesting
his innocence.''
   Police are also looking for Reyes' partner in the club, but Ryan
said he is believed to be out of the country.
   Police had raided The Hole five times since March and made nine
arrests, said mayoral spokesman Tom Kelly. The steep, narrow
staircase leading down to the club was ``no better than a ladder,''
said Fire Department spokesman John Mulligan.
   Mayor Edward I. Koch, who said Monday he wanted the city to do
more to close illegal social clubs, described the club, a
50-by-75-foot T-shaped space, as a ``rabbit warren.''

   His hair usually looks like he has just emerged

its lopsided knot often hangs limply on his wrinkled shirt. There
are stains on his trousers.
   This is a composite picture of Joe Kennedy drawn by Gentleman's
Quarterly, the men's fashion magazine which features the young
Massachusetts congressman on the cover of its September issue.
   In the course of several days with a GQ writer, Kennedy downed
countless cans of Coke and explained his feelings about the
homeless, aid to the Contras, the Kennedy family legacy and other
topics.
   But the magazine couldn't keep its mind off Kennedy's
appearance. As he was driving to a television interview, GQ noted,
``His hair has dried at right angles to his face.''
   At a photo session in his Washington office, Kennedy ``is
beltless,'' the magazine noted. ``His mismatched shoelaces are

   A prosecutor, saying there are more
dangerous people to prosecute than a combative talk show host, has
decided not to arrest Morton Downey Jr. on a complaint that he
scuffled with a weekly newspaper editor during a stage show here.
   Assistant State's Attorney Burton A. Kaplan said he has rejected
an arrest warrant charging Downey with breach of peace based on a
complaint filed by Paul Bass, editor of the 24,000-circulation New
Haven Independent.
   ``I denied the warrant, not based on the merits of the case _
because I believe there was a violation by Mr. Downey _ but based
on other considerations, including the volume of business and the
resources of this office,'' Kaplan said Thursday.
   Downey was in Detroit with his producer and publicist Jim Langan
on a publicity tour Friday, according to a member of his show's
staff at WWOR-TV in Secaucus, N.J., who said one of the men would
comment later.
   Downey scuffled with Bass and James Motavelli, editor of the
weekly Fairfield County Advocate, when tempers flared during a show
Aug. 14 at the Palace Performing Arts Center. The show followed the
confrontational format of Downey's syndicated television show.
   Bass's sister, Sharon Bass, charged on stage and slapped Downey
in the face after Bass and Motavelli walked off. The
standing-room-only audience of 2,000 cheered.
   ``I understand Kaplan's need to prioritize,'' Bass said
Thursday. ``The courts are overbooked with cases. ... I'm very glad
he said in his statement that Downey broke the law.''
   But, he added, ``I think it's unfortunate that some guy who's a
celebrity can get away with backing himself up with thousands of
groupies and he can get away with attacking someone. If it was a
poor black kid with three friends cheering him on, I think he would
get arrested.''

   Almost 10,000 people rocked to ``Wake
Up Little Suzy'' and ``Bye, Bye Love'' in this western Kentucky
town to celebrate the homecoming of the Everly Brothers.
   Don and Phil Everly, who consider Central City their hometown
because they spent summers here when they were young, performed a
benefit concert Thursday night, their first here since they hit the
national record charts about 30 years ago.
   The Everlys donated $6,500 for a police radio system for the
town six months ago.
   Mayor Hugh Sweatt Jr. said that's when townspeople began
organizing the homecoming, which also included the dedication of a
monument to the singers and renaming the three-mile section of U.S.
62 that runs through town ``Everly Brothers Boulevard.''
   Don was born at Brownie, a now-extinct coal camp just outside of
town, but Phil was born in Chicago.
   At a city hall ceremony Thursday, Sweatt gave Phil Everly an
honorary birth certificate from Kentucky.
   ``You can't be born in Chicago,'' Sweatt said. ``You can be
delivered in Chicago, but you have to be born in Kentucky.''
   ``I really appreciate you making be a full-blown Kentuckian,''
Phil Everly told the crowd of 1,000 at the ceremony. ``I've been
lying for a lot of years.''

<HEAD>Soldiers Trade Gunfire in Panama; Army To Cut Tour Length</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NORMAN BLACK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Military Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A squad of Army Special Operations soldiers on
a routine patrol at Howard Air Force Base, Panama, traded gunfire
with a small group of intruders but no one was hurt, Pentagon
officials said Friday.
   The Thursday night incident came as the Army was poised to cut
the required tour length in Panama, part of a continuing effort to
reduce the number of military dependents in the troubled Central
American nation.
   The service hopes to encourage more soldiers to opt for
so-called ``unaccompanied tours'' _ leaving their families behind _
by reducing the tour commitment, said Defense officials, who asked
not to be named.
   The exchange of gunfire, which occurred Thursday evening near an
oil tank farm, was the first such incident in nearly three weeks.
   The officials said American soldiers spotted two or three
intruders before nightfall Thursday, drawing fire from the
unidentified men but not returning it. Later, around 9 p.m., the
soldiers were patrolling the tank farm area and again spotted
intruders, who again fired. This time they returned the gunfire.
   The intruders immediately ``broke contact'' and slipped into the
jungle, the sources said.
   The pending tour reduction plan, stemming in part from a
campaign of harrassment against Americans, would allow Pentagon
officials to move more military families from civilian housing in
and around Panama City to military housing on U.S. bases.
   According to the sources, the plan is awaiting final approval
from Gen. Carl Vuono, the Army's chief of staff, and Army Secretary
John Marsh. That should come early next week, the officials said
Friday.
   Once the Army acts, the other three military services are almost
certain to follow suit, predicted one official.
   Currently, soldiers deployed to Panama are expected to serve for
three years if accompanied by their family and two years if
unaccompanied. The new plan would reduce an accompanied tour to 2{
years and slash the minimum unaccompanied tour to just 15 months.
   ``Given all the turmoil, we're hoping more soldiers will decide
they can go unaccompanied and stick it out for 15 months,'' said
one official.
   Over the past five months, the Pentagon has succeeded in
reducing by 50 percent the number of military families living
outside U.S. bases in Panama _ dropping the total still off-base to
about 1,130. The effort has taken on more momentum this summer
because of what the United States describes as a deliberate
campaign of harrassing Americans.
   U.S. officials in Panama City said Aug. 21 that American
personnel had reported at least 240 incidents of harassment by
Panamanian authorities this year, including attempts to extort
bribes for traffic violations and the stoppage of mail.
   The harassment comes at a time when the United States is
continuing to press economic sanctions against Panama in a bid to
oust the country's leader, military strongman Manuel A. Noriega.
Noriega has been indicted by two federal grand juries in Florida on
drug trafficking charges.
   Panama is the home of the U.S. Southern Command, the
organization responsible for all U.S. military forces in Central
and South America. There are about 10,000 American servicemen
stationed permanently in Panama, plus about 2,200 servicemen who
have been assigned there on a temporary basis since the spring to
upgrade security at American bases.
   Sources said the move to reduce tour lengths for soldiers in
Panama comes amid rumors that Noriega's government intends to
cancel the leases on 100 off-base housing units rented by the Army
itself for military families.

   Air traffic
controllers canceled planned strikes after the government pledged
to improve airport equipment, union leaders said Friday.
   The decision came a week after controllers in Catalonia agreed
to cancel three days of strikes in return for government promises
to raise pay for all 940 controllers in Spain and eliminate
regional salary differences.
   The strikes would have affected Spain's busiest holiday routes
and collapsed its Mediterranean airports, already overburdened by
summer travelers.
   The Tenerife controllers called off the strike after Civil
Aviation chief Manuel Mederos pledged to install a new radar system
at Reina Sofia airport and improve the control tower at Los Rodeos
airport, the leaders said.
   They said Mederos also agreed negotiate raises for controllers
at Los Rodeos.
   In the world's worst airplane crash, 580 people were killed at
Los Rodeos when two Boeing 747 airliners collided on the runway on
March 27, 1977.
   Spanish news reports said government concessions to the
controllers nationwide would cost $3 million and raise salaries by
an average of 17 percent.

   Police officials said Friday they were
investigating a fight that broke out between police officers and
followers of black Muslim leader Louis Farrakhan who were trying to
drive prostitutes from the capital's red-light district.
   The trouble began about 11:30 p.m. Thursday, when officers
noticed about 25 members of the Nation of Islam shouting insults at
streetwalkers and trying to disrupt their contact with passing
motorists, said police spokesman Joseph Gentile.
   Officers patrolling the intersection just five blocks from the
White House repeatedly warned the Muslims not to jaywalk or step in
front of moving vehicles, Gentile said.
   When one officer attempted to issue a jaywalking citation to one
of the Muslims, several of the man's friends began to push the
officer, who called for help from colleagues, the spokesman said.
   When order was restored 20 minutes later, three police officers
and four Muslims had been hurt, none seriously, and eight of
Farrakhan's followers had been arrested.
   Seven were charged with disorderly conduct and one with
assaulting a police officer, Gentile said. He said officials were
investigating the incident.
   Earlier this year, members of the Nation of Islam beat a
television reporter and cameraman after they refused to turn over
videotapes that reportedly showed several Muslims assaulting a
suspected drug dealer. No charges were filed.
   Police later acknowledged that patrols by Farrakhan's followers
helped reduce narcotics trafficking at an apartment complex that
was one of Washington's most notorious drug marketplaces.

<TEXT>
   Greenpeace activists dumped a pile of
dead fish in front of a chemical factory Friday and then chained
themselves to the gate to protest its discharges into the Baltic
Sea.
   Greenpeace member Ingrid Jutting told The Associated Press the
waste from the Kemira Oy company is killing fish in the Gulf of
Bothnia on Finland's southwestern coast.
   ``We don't deny that we are dumping 50,000 tons of ferrous
sulfate and other heavy metals and impurities into the sea,'' said
company spokesman Kalevi Tiihonen. He said the level was within
legal limits and would be reduced in the next four years.
   The Vuorikemia plant on the island of Reposaari produces 84,000
tons of titanium dioxide a year for use in paint, paper, plastic
and cosmetics. ``The problem is that with every ton of titanium
dioxide, over eight tons of sulfur dioxide waste is produced, which
Kemira dumps into the sea,'' Ms. Jutting said.
   ``Fishermen have reported that as much as 80 percent of their
catch has to be thrown away,'' said Ms. Jutting. ``The fish,
herring in particular, are often dead, deformed or too small to
eat.''

<HEAD>Vietnam Says `Hostile Policy' Must Be Settled</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Vietnam's foreign minister said Friday
the United States must end what he called its ``hostile policy''
against his country before Hanoi will resume cooperation on
humanitarian issues.
   Foreign Minister Nguyen Co Thach said he sent a letter Aug. 10
to retired Gen. John W. Vessey, a special U.S. presidential envoy,
reaffirming Vietnam's opposition to congressional testimony July 28
by U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Gaston Sigur.
   Sigur had called for continued isolation of Vietnam until it
ends its decade-old occupation of Cambodia.
   Thach spoke with reporters after talks with Thai Prime Minister
Chatichai Choonhavan and Foreign Minister Siddhi Savetsila on the
last day of a five-day visit. He later flew home.
   Thach gave no details of his letter to Vessey, but said, ``The
cause (of suspension of cooperation) is there so to resume
(cooperation), you must liquidate the cause.''
   Vietnam said Aug. 3 it was temporarily halting participation in
efforts to account for U.S. servicemen missing in the war and in
resettling former political prisoners in the United States, despite
recent agreements on those issues.
   It cited Sigur's testimony as the reason for its decision.
   In his testimony Sigur argued against a congressional resolution
urging the establishment of ``interest sections'' _ diplomatic
missions below the level of embassies _ in Hanoi and Washington,
saying the move would not improve cooperation on humanitarian
issues.
   Thach and Vessey agreed a year ago that Vietnam would accelerate
its accounting of nearly 1,800 Americans missing in action, and in
return the United States would help Vietnam with its humanitarian
problems.
   Thach told Vessey in July that Vietnam would try to resolve 70
top priority MIA cases by year's end, and welcomed joint
excavations for remains between August and October.
   Also last month, the two countries held talks on a U.S. offer to
resettle former U.S. government employees and officials of the
American-backed South Vietnam government who were sent to
``re-education camps'' after the 1975 North Vietnamese victory.
   Thach said that in talks with the Thai foriegn minister he
reaffirmed Hanoi's willingness to take back Vietnamese refugees who
want to return and who pose ``the biggest burden to Thailand.'' But
he noted that ``forced mass repatriation is not humanitarian.''

<HEAD>Trial Posponed for Brother of Oakland Pitcher</HEAD>
<DATELINE>COLORADO SPRINGS, Colo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A kidnapping and attempted murder
trial was postponed after the defendant's lawyer said it would hurt
the Oakland Athletics pennant chances and harm the career of his
client's brother, star pitcher Dennis Eckersley.
   A new trial date has been set Dec. 12 for Eckersley's older
brother, Wallace, 35, who is charged with the 1987 choking, beating
and stabbing of a 59-year-old woman and leaving her for dead.
   The trial was set Aug. 22, but a motion to postpone was filed
Aug. 4. District Court Judge James Franklin granted the motion
after a hearing and set the new trial date.
   The motion said a defense investigator recently visited
California ``following leads and witnesses in order to support the
defense of intoxication'' and had uncovered more potential
witnesses. Wallace Eckersley lives in Los Angeles.
   Wallace Eckersley's lawyer, Dennis Hartley, contended the motion
for postponement rested largely on the need for more time to
prepare a defense.
   But the two-page motion also dealt with Dennis Eckersley, 33,
and the effect the trial might have on his career if he were called
in midseason to testify.
   The document said Eckersley will be a ``critical'' defense
witness.
   ``Dennis Eckersley's ball club is in first place in their major
league division and will go to the playoffs in all likelihood,''
the court document said. ``The management of the club is absolutely
opposed to his appearance as a witness until after the baseball
season.
   ``The calling of Dennis Eckersley would cause tremendous adverse
publicity for his ball club and for himself and could have a
substantial effect on his major league career and this season in
particular. It would be grossly unfair to potentially ruin another
life or career in this situation,'' the document said.
   ``I think it's very interesting about this baseball,'' said the
victim, Sigrid Marie Griswold of Colorado Springs. ``When I read
the motion and found three paragraphs devoted to the baseball
issue, I was shocked.''
   Daniel Immel of Denver pleaded guilty to kidnapping in the case
and was sentenced in November to 48 years in prison. Wallace
Eckersley also pleaded guilty but changed his mind after Immel's
sentencing and asked for a trial.
   Reached by telephone in Oakland, Calif., Athletics General
Manager Sandy Alderson said Thursday he was not aware of a motion
to postpone and had not been contacted about the possibility of
Dennis Eckersley testifying.
   ``We were vaguely aware of something involving his brother,''
Alderson said. ``But we were not specifically aware of a trial
pending.''
   But Alderson added that ``clearly something of this sort would
be a distraction to Dennis during the course of the season. From
our standpoint, it would certainly be in our best interest that
Dennis not be involved.''

<DATELINE>LISBON, Portugal (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Smoldering fires and the risk of
collapsing buildings Friday prevented investigators from finding
the cause of a blaze that destroyed much of the historic Chiado
shopping district.
   Civil engineers and other experts were told their inquiry would
have to wait until the fire completely subsided in the cellars of
the 150- and 200-year-old buildings that were used to store highly
combustible materials such as textiles and paper.
   Firefighters also said the burned-out shells of the Armazens do
Grandela and the Grandes Armazens do Chiado department stores were
probably beyond propping up and could collapse at any minute.
   The fire broke out in the Armazens do Grandela early Thursday
and in the next four hours swept through buildings on the narrow
streets of the neighborhood known for its speciality shops and
cafes where artists and writers gathered.
   One man died and 43 people, six of whom remained hospitalized
Friday, were injured.
   Fire officials say they don't know what caused the blaze, the
worst in the capital in 200 years. News reports raised the
possibility of arson.
   Union representatives said about 2,000 people, mostly clerical
and shop workers, lost their jobs.
   Lisbon Shopowners Association President Jose Ferreira de Matos
put damages at $600 million, nearly double the estimate of
insurance adjustors.
   He told a news conference that stores in the entire downtown
area would suffer from the effects of the fire despite official
promises to rebuild the Chiado.
   ``We fear that people will change their shopping habits,'' he
said. ``Remember that it took 14 years to restore the National
Theater after it burned.''
   Matos said 40 stores were destroyed, not counting the offices of
many lawyers and accountants on upper floors.
   Lisbon Mayor Nuno Kruz Abecasis, who met Thursday night with
architects, urban planners and cultural officials, told reporters
it would be a year before reconstruction of the area could begin.
   Matos called the old, battered state of the equipment used by
firefighters ``shameful.''
   The daily Correiro de Manha said reporters sent to the central
fire station discovered that none of the buildings destroyed in the
Chiado was connected to the department's centralized alert system.
   Neither of the two department stores had sprinkler systems
installed, and no recent fire inspections had been carried out in
the area's shops, the paper said.
   The weekly Sabado said the most serious outcome of the fire was
that Lisbon citizens, ``who have long lived with the impression
that their city is under permanent threat ... are now aware how
little is done to avoid such disasters.''
   Jorge Monteiro, owner of three stores destroyed in the Chiado
fire, urged Matos to demand an impartial inquiry into why the mayor
had ignored shopowners' protests and built stone planters and
tables in the middle of the Rua do Carmo that prevented
fire-fighting equipment from reaching the Armazens do Grandela
store.
   The Chiado district is in a part of Lisbon that was rebuilt
following a disastrous 1755 earthquake and fire that destroyed much
of the medieval part of the city.

   Young workers this summer are experiencing the
lowest unemployment rate since 1969 with a record 68.5 percent of
the nation's youths holding jobs, the Labor Department said Friday.
   The unemployment rate among workers aged 16-24 was 10.9 percent
in July compared with 11.7 percent a year ago, the department said.
   But all of the improvement was among whites; blacks did not
share in any of it, the government said. Only about half of the
nation's black youths have jobs this summer, compared with
three-fourths of white youths.
   ``Black youths continued to be about twice as likely as whites
to work in government jobs,'' said the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
``Their proportion in these jobs, however _ 12.6 percent this
summer _ has dropped 4 full percentage points from the high reached
two summers ago.''
   The jobless rate for white youths in July was 8.9 percent,
compared with 9.7 percent a year earlier. The rate among black
youths was almost three times higher _ 25.3 percent, the same as in
July 1987.
   The proportion of youths either working or looking for work
climbed to an all-time high of 78.6 percent in July, 0.6 percentage
point above what it was a year ago.
   But because of the continuing decline in the size of the youth
population, the actual number of young workers in the labor force
has fallen by 270,000 in the past year to 25.3 million, the
department said.
   Labor force participation among white youths has reached a
record 79.4 percent this summer after hovering around 78.6 percent
the past four years.
   ``In marked contrast,'' the government said, ``labor force
participation for black youths, which had dropped more than 2
percentage points between 1986 and 1987, held steady at 65.7
percent in July.''

   The government on Friday described a
rare strike this week by 300 miners as ``regrettable'' but
understandable in view of economic hardships under an austerity
program.
   It said some of the workers' demands were met.
   State-run newspapers said the cabinet met Thursday and decided
to change regulations regarding sick leave pay to eliminate
contradictions the miners had asked be done away with.
   Judit Csehak, minister of social-welfare and health, said the
new regulations which would reduce sick pay received since Jan. 1
by about 10 percent would go into effect Oct. 1.
   The miners at the Komlo mine in southern Hungary had complained
that because of a quirk in tax laws introduced at the beginning of
this year, workers on sick leave could earn more than those working
regularly.
   Government spokesman Gyorgy Marosan said the government
considered the 20-hour strike ``regrettable and avoidable'' but
understandable ``under the circumstances,'' newspapers reported.
   The official news agency MTI reported that the government would
ask parliament to consider amendments to the tax bills before the
end of this year, but gave no details.
   In a letter to the government, the miners warned that the tax
``does not stimulate increased production or the undertaking of
extra shifts.''

   The director of a textile plant
tried to discipline strikers by locking them up, it was reported
Friday.
   About 5,000 workers at the Makedonka plant in Stip in in the
southern republic of Macedonia staged a four-day strike this month
to protest low wages and living conditions, the Belgrade daily
Politika said.
   Ljiljana Velkova of the ready-made clothes department addressed
the workers and complained that she and 20 other workers were
locked in a room by director Livanta Naseva, the newspaper said.
   Ms. Velkova was in an advanced stage of pregnancy and became ill
while locked up, requiring hospitalization.
   Factory officials insisted that Ms. Naseva locked the door for
only five minutes, but Ms. Velkova was rushed to hospital 3{ hours
later, the paper said.

   Communist Party leader Zhao Ziyang told Prime
Minister Noboru Takeshita of Japan on Friday that China will never
seek to establish a sphere of influence in Cambodia.
   Zhao also urged Japan to invest more in China's coastal areas
and said an economically strong China will benefit Japan and the
rest of Asia.
   Takeshita's meeting with Zhao concluded two days of extensive
talks with Chinese leaders that both sides said heralded a new era
of close relations between the two Asian countries.
   Takeshita met earlier Friday with President Yang Shangkun and
senior leader Deng Xiaoping, who said their countries should seek a
``new type of relationship'' based on mutual trust, Japanese
officials and the official Xinhua News Agency reported.
   Zhao said China, main backers of the Khmer Rouge and other
anti-Vietnamese guerrillas in Cambodia, supports a democratic,
neutral government in the Southeast Asian nation.
   He said China ``has no selfish interests'' in Cambodia and would
not approve a return to power by the Khmer Rouge, who killed
hundreds of thousands of people during its 1975-78 rule.
   The national evening news quoted Zhao as saying a greater danger
was that the pro-Vietnam government of Hun Sen would use its
military strength to gain sole power.
   Zhao said China demands that Vietnam, which toppled the Khmer
Rouge in 1978 and installed Hun Sen, withdraw all its troops.
Vietnam has agreed to pull out its estimated 100,000 troops by 1990.
   Zhao said China seeks the formation of a four-party coalition,
including Hun Sen and the three-party resistance, headed by
resistance leader Prince Norodom Sihanouk.
   Sihanouk, frequently at odds with his resistance partners, has
suggested he might seek a government with Hun Sen that would shut
out the Khmer Rouge.
   Zhao said the four factions should disband their armies and
establish a unified national defense army with each faction
contributing equal numbers of troops, the evening news said.
   Japanese officials said Takeshita agreed with China's approach
and was considering ways to contribute to a political settlement in
Cambodia. Japan has suggested it might help finance an
international peacekeeping force.
   The officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
Takeshita did not offer to act as a mediator in the Cambodian
conflict.
   On Sunday, Foreign Ministry officials from China and the Soviet
Union, the main backer of Vietnam, will meet for the first time in
Beijing to probe ways to end the Vietnamese occupation and bring
peace to Cambodia.
   The Japanese officials said Zhao thanked Takeshita for Japan's
economic assistance and pushed for Japanese participation in his
pet project, the development of China's coastal areas into a vast
economic zone for export-oriented processing industries.
   On Thursday, at a meeting with Premier Li Peng, Takeshita
announced that Japan will provide $6.4 billion in loans for about
40 Chinese development projects in the 1990-95 period.
   Japan accounts for only about 8 percent of foreign investment in
China, well below Hong Kong and the United States, and China has
complained the Japanese are too cautious about putting their money
into Chinese projects.

   The Rev. Jerry Falwell said Friday he will
lead the way as faculty and administrators voluntarily submit to
the drug screening required this year of Liberty University's 6,000
students.
   ``All of us have agreed to voluntary drug testing at random and
several of us at the top, myself included, will be drug tested,''
said Falwell, the school's founder and chancellor.
   He said he knows of no other U.S. college or university that
tests all students for drugs. ``I'm hopeful they will watch what
we're doing and follow suit,'' he said.
   Liberty students were notified by mail over the summer and each
has signed a waiver agreeing to submit to urine screening.
   ``We have checked with thousands of young people and haven't
received a complaint,'' said Falwell, a television evangelist and
founder of the Moral Majority conservative lobbying organization.
   Urine-testing could begin next week and will include all
students during the program's first year, said Dr. Gregg Albers,
the school's director of health services.
   There are no plans to test employees of Falwell's other
organizations.
   Tests will be given to about 200 students a week in a special
bathroom designed to make it difficult for anyone to alter the
urine sample.
   The urine will be screened three times with the last test
breaking it down to the molecular level. Testing will be done for
illegal and abusable prescription drugs and will be used to spot
other health problems, Albers said.
   Students who test positive will be offered counseling, and
possibly a second chance.
   ``While the school takes a very strong position against drugs,
we're not going to be unreasonable in our methds,'' said Falwell
spokesman Mark DeMoss.

   Panamanian military leader Manuel Antonio
Noriega has fired the Panamanian consul in Tampa, Fla., whose
office had been used by State Department envoys for obtaining visas
for travel to that country, a Panamanian diplomat said Friday.
   The Noriega government has been rejecting visas approved by
Panama's consulate in Washington because it is staffed by officials
loyal to ousted President Eric Arturo Delvalle.
   As an alternative, American diplomats had been obtaining travel
documents from the Tampa consul, Elizabeth Martinez, who had
maintained ties with both the Noriega government and Delvalle
loyalists.
   But a Panamanian diplomat in Washington, a supporter of
Delvalle, said Ms. Martinez was fired this week by Noriega.
   A receptionist at the Tampa consulate, reached by telephone,
said Ms. Martinez was ill on Friday. She said she was unaware of
the report that Ms. Martinez had been removed from her post.
   A State Department official could not confirm that Ms. Martinez
had been fired but said the Noriega government was no longer
accepting visas signed by the Tampa consulate. The official and the
Panamanian diplomat insisted on anonymity.
   Another department official said U.S. diplomats have
alternatives other than the Tampa consulate for obtaining visas but
he refused to elaborate.
   The Reagan administration has declined to recognize the Noriega
government and regards Delvalle as the legitimate authority in
Panama even though he was ousted six months ago and has been in
hiding in Panama ever since.
   It also recognizes Delvalle's ambassador to Washington, Juan B.
Sosa, as the official Panamanian representative in the United
States.
   Sosa, who has ignored attempts by Noriega to replace him, told a
news conference Thursday that the embassy officially recognizes the
Tampa consulate, implying that Ms. Martinez had broken with Noriega.
   The New York Times said in its editions of last Sunday that the
Tampa consulate recently had approved visas for 14 American
officials who were either serving in Panama on expired visas or
recently assigned to Panama.
   The administration has barred its diplomats from having official
dealings with representatives of the Noriega government. As a
result, U.S. diplomats have been prevented from obtaining visas
from consuls loyal to Noriega.

   A prison inmate who tested positive for
the AIDS virus and allegedly spit on a correctional officer has
been indicted on a charge of attempted murder.
   Curtis Weeks, 27, who was serving a robbery sentence, told
several prison guards at the Department of Corrections Diagnostic
Center that he had AIDS and threatened to infect them, said David
Weeks, a special prosecutor. Curtis and David Weeks are not related.
   ``He carried it out by spitting on the officer,'' the prosecutor
said. ``This guy has a disease and he's using it aggressively
against other people.''
   Grand jurors who handed up the indictment Tuesday saw a video
recording of the prisoner's actions.
   Doctors said Curtis Weeks tested positive for HIV, which causes
the fatal acquired immune deficiency syndrome. There is no known
cure for the disease. Chances of AIDS transmission by saliva are
extremely low, said David Weeks.
   ``But the crux of the matter is his intent, even though he may
not be able to carry it out by that means,'' he said.
   The guard has experienced a ``great deal of trauma'' and must
have periodic blood tests to check for the presence of the virus,
said the prosecutor.
   Curtis Weeks faces a possible sentence of 25 years to life in
prison if found guilty of attempted murder.

   A spokesman for Kurdish rebels said
Friday that 88 civilians were killed and 500 people injured when
Iraqi warplanes dropped poison gas bombs on five Kurdish villages
in northern Iraq a day before.
   Western diplomats in the Iraqi capital of Baghdad confirmed that
Iraq has launched a major assault on the Kurdish guerrillas now
that it has been freed from fighting Iran by a week-old cease-fire.
   Iraq's 3.5 million Kurds have been fighting for an independent
homeland for more than 50 years. The guerrillas formed an alliance
with Iran two years ago, opening a second war front that pinned
down tens of thousands of Iraqi troops badly needed in the main
battlefields to the south.
   Thursday's reported attacks on the Kurds came as Iranian and
Iraqi leaders met in Geneva for talks to end the nearly 8-year-old
war. Kurdish and Iranian officials have said Iraq has used an Aug.
20 cease-fire to intensify its campaign against the guerrillas,
while Iraq claims Iran is using the truce to regroup shattered
forces.
   Six fighter-bombers carried out the attack on five villages in
the Zakho and Amadiyah regions of northern Iraq near the Turkish
border, said the spokesman for the Kurdish Democratic Party. The
spokesman, who demanded anonymity, said 88 people died and 500 were
injured.
   The rebel spokesman called The Associated Press bureau in
Nicosia from a West European capital, which he refused to be
identified for ``security reasons.''
   The use of chemical weapons is outlawed under a 1925 Geneva
agreement.
   ``We appeal to the United Nations and the International
Committee of the Red Cross to offer their humanitarian assistance
to the gas victims through the Turkish Red Crescent,'' that
country's equivalent of the Red Cross, said the spokesman.

<HEAD>Bush Says Dukakis is Lax on Crime</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Republican George Bush on Friday accused
Michael Dukakis of lax crime policies, turning the tables on the
Democrat's criticism of Reagan administration drug efforts a day
before.
   During a campaign trip in his adopted home state, Bush also took
up the defense of his embattled running mate, Sen. Dan Quayle of
Indiana, telling a rally that Quayle would be ``an outstanding vice
president.''
   Bush told the rally in Eastern Texas that it was ``an insult''
for Dukakis to refer to President Reagan's drug policies as
``criminal'' and ``absurd'' when thousands of federal and local law
enforcement officials ``are putting their lives on the line every
single day to stop the narcotics flow.''
   Dukakis, Bush said, ``is the governor who vetoed the mandatory
sentencing for drug dealers. He opposes capital punishment for drug
king pins. And he fought tooth and nail to keep that outrageous
furlough program that lets murderers, rapists and drug dealers out
on appeal.''
   As to his own plans to combat drugs, Bush, who headed a Reagan
task force on drugs, said ``one way we must do it is support our
local law enforcement officers who are out there every day.''
   Bush also repeated his support for Quayle, who he has not
mentioned by name in two previous days of campaigning.
   Bush touted the congressional qualifications that the Bush
campaign had hoped to emphasize before Quayle became embroiled in
questions about using his family influence to join the National
Guard rather than be drafted during the Vietnam War.
   ``Here's a man elected twice to the Congress, twice to the
Senate, a wonderfully thoughtful person who has taken a leadership
role in job retraining ... but also is a member of the Armed
Services Committee, knows as I do that only a strong America can
prevent expansion of totalitarianism around the world,'' Bush told
a hall filled with about 2,500 supporters.
   ``He'll be an outstanding vice president.''
   Bush telephoned Quayle from his plane Friday morning, said Bush
chief of staff Craig Fuller. The vice president told Quayle, ``I
think things are going very well.''
   Bush last spoke to his 41-year-old running mate two days
earlier, said press secretary Shiela Tate, who said the two ``keep
in touch.''
   Bush aides said the campaign believes the firestorm over Quayle
has peaked. Quayle himself now refuses to answer further questions
about his National Guard service.
   Bush is pushing hard to tout his credentials as a Texan, a state
where he moved 40 years ago to go into the oil business and later
served as a member of the House.
   ``This is a key state and I'm not going to let them take it away
from me,'' he told the Longview rally. ``It's my state ... I
understand this state.''
   At the end of his speech, Bush briefly donned a white 10-gallon
hat. He put it on again at the airport before leaving Longview and
when he stepped off Air Force Two in Houston.
   He told the Texans he would do more for them than Dukakis,
highlighting their differences on energy, defense and gun control.
   ``My opponent opposes offshore drilling, and I support it,''
Bush said.
   He also called for a tax credit for oil exploration to increase
the industry drilling rig count, adding ``and I do know what a rig
count is.''
   He reiterated his support for the Strategic Defense Initiative
which Dukakis opposes. ``He says it is fantasy. I say it is
essential. I will support research vigorously and fully and when it
is ready I will deploy it,'' Bush said.

<HEAD>Seizure Ordered Of Jewelry, Other Items Bought By DeSillers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By A.J. DICKERSON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A judge Friday ordered the seizure of jewelry and
other luxury items that Maria DeSillers allegedly bought with some
of the $690,000 donated by strangers last year for her dying son's
liver transplants.
   Dade Probate Judge Francis Christie granted a request from
lawyers for a court-appointed curator of the estate of Ronnie
DeSillers, who died in April 1987 at age 7. The order also struck
Ms. DeSillers' $150,000 claim on the estate.
   ``I'm going to ruin you, lady,'' a furious Ms. DeSillers said as
the curator, Karen Gievers, left the judge's chamber Friday. Ms.
Gievers ignored the comments and declined to say anything about
them later.
   ``You call this justice? She'll never run for public office in
this state,'' Ms. DeSillers said loudly as her attorneys sought to
quiet her.
   In a separate ruling Thursday, Christie dismissed Ms. Gievers'
request to hold Ms. DeSillers in contempt for not handing over
records of her purchases and the disputed items themselves, which
include a diamond-sapphire ring and diamond-studded gold cross.
   Being forced under threat of jail to turn over the records and
purchases could violate Ms. DeSillers' right against
self-incrimination, because criminal investigations are under way
in Dade and Broward counties, the judge had ruled Thursday.
   Michael Dribin, an attorney for Ms. Gievers, said having a third
party seize the items did not expose Ms. DeSillers to
self-incrimination. Friday's order does not cover the records, only
the disputed items.
   Ms. Gievers has estimated that the amount of donations that Ms.
DeSillers may have improperly spent on herself, family and friends
was $200,000.
   The seizure order does not list any dollar value for the items.
Besides the ring and the cross, it includes such things as an IBM
computer, a diamond-studded gold bracelet, about $4,000 in
furniture, a car phone and a gold watch.
   Ms. Gievers declined to say when the seizure might take place.
   The national spotlight turned on Ms. DeSillers in early 1987
after the theft of $4,000 raised by Ronnie's classmates for a
needed transplant. Donations poured in, including $1,000 from
President Reagan and $200,000 from Miami Beach millionaire Victor
Posner.
   Ronnie died after three failed liver transplants at Pittsburgh
Children's Hospital. His mother has refused to pay the $262,000
balance of his medical bill, claiming the boy received inadequate
care, a charge the hospital denies vehemently.
   Ms. Gievers, an attorney, was appointed curator of the child's
estate in March, after Ms. DeSillers' handling of the donations
came under fire when it was learned she rented an apartment in a
posh, waterfront apartment building and had purchased a used BMW
for $13,500.
   Roy Black, one of Ms. DeSillers' lawyers, 33, says some of his
client's purchases may not be improper as claimed because some of
the donations were given for her personal use.
   Black said his client has been unfairly portrayed as ``greedy
and grasping'' when she gave thousands of dollars to poor families
with sick children.

<HEAD>Senate Panel Blasts Administration for Pressuring Federal Reserve</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE ROBINSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Senate committee accused the Reagan
administration Friday of placing excessive political pressure on
the Federal Reserve Board to speed up the growth of the nation's
supply of money.
   ``Since the time of the stock market crash in October of 1987,
the Federal Reserve has come under excessive political pressure
from the administration,'' the Senate Banking Committee said in a
report.
   Remarks by former Treasury Secretary James Baker and Council of
Economic Advisers Chairman Beryl Sprinkel as well as a letter
written by Assistant Treasury Secretary Michael Darby were cited as
examples of political pressure.
   Following the October 1987 crash, the Federal Reserve's Open
Markets Committee sent a large infusion of cash into the economy
but then began tightening again, rekindling administration concerns.
   The report quoted Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan as
saying he was concerned about efforts to influence the Fed and that
such moves might end up backfiring because ``we will feel a
necessity to do precisely the opposite.''
   In Los Angeles, presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater rejected
the report's contention.
   ``We are not doing that,'' Fitzwater said. ``The Banking
Committee is wrong. The Fed is independent. We are not applying
pressure of any kind.''
   Four Republican members of the panel also issued a statement
saying the report ``loses objectivity and perspective'' in
portraying the remarks of Sprinkel and Darby ``as an effort to
exert improper pressure.''
   The statement was signed by Sens. Jake Garn, R-Utah; David K.
Karnes, R-Neb.; Kit Bond, R-Mo., and Phil Gramm, R-Texas.
   The Republicans also scoffed at the report's contention that
Sprinkel attempted to influence the Federal Reserve through the
press, saying his views were not supposed to be kept secret and
noting that the Banking Committee itself had called him as a
witness in open hearings.
   The report said Sprinkel ``has made repeated attempts to
influence Federal Reserve policy through the press and through
criticisms published in the Economic Report of the President for
1988.''
   It said Darby ``wrote a letter to the governors of the Federal
Reserve Board and to the Reserve Bank presidents on the Federal
Open Market Committee just before the February meeting suggesting
that money growth was too slow.''
   The report said the remarks could be ``ironically
counterproductive'' because they ``could result in the Fed acting
less vigorously than it otherwise would in the recommended
direction, or acting in a direction contrary to the suggesting of
the administration, in an effort to preserve the Federal Reserve's
reputation for independence.''
   ``The problems of political independence are particularly acute
at the present time when all members of the board of governors were
appointed by the Reagan administration,'' said the report.
   The report described as ``somewhat diversionary'' attempts ``by
some within the administration'' to blame the crash on the Fed's
slow-growth policy preceding October 1987.
   It said slow growth was a result of an agreement between the Fed
and the administration made necessary by the 1987 Louvre Accord
between the United States and six other major industrial nations.
The accord was aimed at stabilizing the dollar after a two-year
lowering.
   ``The administration is therefore jointly responsible for the
slow rate of money growth and any of the resulting consequences,''
the report said. ``Attempts to single out the Federal Reserve as
the scapegoat for the stock market crash or any of the consequences
of the slower than normal growth in the money supply are therefore
incredible.''

   The sky was clear and sunny over much of the nation Saturday
with only widely scattered precipitation.
   At midday, showers were scattered from central Arizona into
southern Nevada, over northwestern Montana and western South
Dakota, and across Florida and eastern Georgia.
   Elsewhere, showers and thunderstorms developed over New England.
   During the six hours up to 2 p.m. EDT, 1.48 inches of rain fell
at Brunswick, Ga., but rain elsewhere was lighter.
   During the night, a severe storm spun off high wind that ripped
out windows and walls and cut power at the southern California town
of Baker, in the Mojave Desert.
   No injuries were reported but several mobile homes were damaged,
windows at numerous businesses were blown out and the back wall of
an auto service garage was knocked down, collapsing its roof, said
Baker firefighter James Meral.
   Officials estimated damage at $500,000 to $1 million. There was
no official reading on wind speed in the town 150 miles northeast
of Los Angeles.
   Midday temperatures Friday reached 100 over central Texas and
the desert Southwest, and near 100 from north-central Texas into
south-central Oklahoma.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 55
degrees at Crescent City, Calif., to 105 at Palm Springs, Calif.
Friday's low for the 48 states was 40 degrees at Aberdeen, S.D.,
and Bismarck, N.D.
   For Saturday, showers and thunderstorms were forecast over the
Florida Peninsula, from Michigan and Wisconsin into southeastern
Minnesota and northern Indiana, over Missouri, eastern Kansas and
Oklahoma, from southeastern Wyoming across Colorado, and from
central Arizona into southwestern Utah. Scattered showers were
forecast along the Virginia coast.
   High in the 60s were predicted over North Dakota and northern
Minnesota; in the 70s and 80s from New England into the Carolinas,
and over southern Florida, the remainder of the Great Lakes, across
the Ohio Valley, over the remainder of the northern half of the
Mississippi Valley, from South Dakota across northern Kansas, from
Montana across northern New Mexico, across the Pacific Northwest,
and along the California coast; from near 100 to about 105 over the

<HEAD>Navy To Begin Random Drug Testing Of Civilian Employees</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NORMAN BLACK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Military Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Navy said Friday it would begin random
drug testing of selected civilian employees this fall.
   The service said its final plan for the tests had been signed
Aug. 6 by Navy Secretary William Ball and that 81,000 of the Navy's
337,000 civilian workers are being notified they will be subject to
urinalysis testing for drugs.
   Although testing legally could begin as early as Oct. 6, the
Navy does not plan to start the program until early November, said
Lt. Ken Ross, a Navy spokesman.
   The Navy becomes the second military service to launch a testing
program for civilian workers; the Army already is testing civilian
workers in sensitive positions. The Air Force still is working on
its testing guidelines.
   All of the military services have long tested men and women on
active duty.
   Three months ago, the Department of Health and Human Services
forwarded to Congress the drug testing plans of 24 different
government agencies, technically clearing the way for the agencies
to begin testing when they were ready.
   The plans were developed as part of a broad administration
campaign to ensure a drug-free workplace.
   In forwarding the Defense Department's plan to Congress, HHS
said the Pentagon had tagged about 200,000 civilian positions as
sensitive enough to warrant testing, but did not provide a
breakdown among the various services.
   The department employs about 1 million civilian workers.
   According to Ross, most of the 81,000 Navy positions designated
as subject to testing are in the areas of ``public health and
safety, protection of life and property, law enforcement and
national security.''
   Civilian workers who receive a notice that their job has been
designated ``sensitive'' and who then immediately request
assistance for drug use will be offered counseling and
rehabilitation without penalty, Ross said.
   Those who do not voluntarily come forward in the very beginning
and who subsequently test positive for drugs will be subject to
administrative and punitive sanctions up to and including
dismissal, the spokesman said.
   Ross said the Navy plans to test about 20,000 civilians during
the first year of its program. Unlike military personnel, the
civilian workers will be allowed to provide urine samples without
being directly observed, the spokesman said.
   The drugs to be tested for include marijuana, cocaine, opiates,
amphetamines and phencyclidine.

<HEAD>Bush, Quayle Paint Dukakis as Weak on Crime</HEAD>

<BYLINE>AP Political Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   George Bush and Republican ticketmate Dan Quayle depicted
Michael Dukakis as weak on crime on Friday, and the vice president
said his Democratic rival's criticism of Reagan administration
anti-drug efforts were ``an insult.''
   Dukakis spent the day working in his governor's office in
Massachusetts and offered no immediate rebuttal to he latest
Republican campaign blasts. Democratic vice presidential candidate
Lloyd Bentsen called for more spending on rural health care
programs as he toured Mississippi.
   Bush behaved more and more like a man who felt the controversy
surrounding his running mate's service in the Indiana National
Guard was fading. The vice president talked with Quayle by
telephone for the first time in two days and reporters were told
that Bush advised his running mate that ``things are going very
well.''
   But Quayle also conceded an error in his official biography _
after his press spokesman first denounced a newspaper story about
the matter as a ``cheap shot.''
   The Indiana senator said it was ``inaccurate'' to say that he
had spent two years working as chief consumer investigator for the
Indiana attorney general's office, but blamed the error on his
staff. ``If it indicated that, that is inaccurate,'' he said of his
official biography. ``I didn't hold the job for two years.''
   The issue arose after The Plain Dealer of Cleveland reported
that Quayle actually held the position for a little over two
months. Quayle was hired as an entry-level employee in the attorney
general's office in Indiana in 1970, several months before the
consumer division was created. He later held the investigator
position.
   But after more than a week of fending off controversy about
Quayle and his service in the National Guard, the Republicans went
on the offensive.
   Bush attacked Dukakis as he spent his second straight day trying
to firm up support in his _ and Bentsen's _ home state of Texas.
   ``He is the governor who vetoed the mandatory sentencing for
drug dealers. He opposes capital punishment for drug kingpins. And
he fought tooth and nail to keep that outrageous furlough program
that lets murderers, rapists and drug dealers out on appeal,'' the
vice president said of his Democratic opponent.
   Bush also fired back at Dukakis' sharp attack Thursday on the
Reagan administration's war on drugs. Dukakis said parts of it were
``criminal'' and added the enterprise was a failure.
   ``That is an insult,'' Bush said, adding that his Democratic
rival should have noted that many federal and local law enforcement
personnel have lost their lives trying to stop the illegal flow of
narcotics.
   His press aide, Sheila Tate, denied the vice president was
shifting his position on Star Wars. Bush said three weeks ago he
favors deployment of the missile defense system ``as soon as
feasible.'' In an interview with the New York Times, Bush noted
that full deployment would be ``very expensive'' and said any
decision would have to await further research.
   Quayle, campaigning in Billings, Mont., criticized Dukakis for
supporting gun control during his tenure as governor of
Massachusetts. ``Americans would be much better off if our opponent
believed in crime control rather than gun control,'' he said.
   Dukakis tended to state business, but paused to answer a
question after swearing in a new transportation official. Asked
about Bush's statement on Star Wars, the governor said, ``I think
he's taking the right position and I'm pleased that he has.''
Dukakis has long been a firm opponent of the Reagan
administration's space-based missile defense proposal, while Bush
is a supporter.
   Aides said Dukakis would soon scale back the amount of time he
devotes to statehouse duties and increase his campaigning around
the country from three days a week to five or six.
   Bentsen, on a swing through the South, went with 87-year-old
Sen. John Stennis to a hospital ward where premature infants are
cared for. He later said he will continue to seek increased
spending for rural health care programs, including those dealing
with newborns.
   Bentsen was unable to make a scheduled appearance in Atlanta
later in the day when his chartered jet was grounded.
   The front door of the Boeing 737 was damaged when federal agents
guarding the plane forced it closed. They broke a hinge mechanism
which props the door open when it's on the ground, and that in turn
punctured the door. The damage meant the door might not stay open
in case of an emergency evacuation, and the Federal Aviation
Administration ordered repairs, said campaign spokesman Mike
McCurry.
   The incident came on the heels of several mishaps with planes
chartered for reporters covering Bush's campaign. But it marked the
first time a candidate had to alter his travel plans because of
problems with his aircraft.
   In Washington, one-time Dukakis rival Jesse Jackson pledged to
get out the vote for the Democratic ticket. ``Dukakis and Bentsen
represent an alternative, a chance to change,'' Jackson said.
   In the colorful rhetoric that marked his campaign, Jackson said:
``Bush and Quayle want to privatize the Justice Department. They
want to privatize foreign policy. They want to privatize public
education. And since they like privacy so much, I want to help them
move back into private life.''

   A policeman spotted a bomb
attached to his car Friday and British army explosives experts
defused it, authorities reported.
   No group claimed responsibility for the bomb, but suspicion fell
on the Irish Republican Army.
   The officer, who was not identified, found the bomb while his
car was parked at his home in Sion Hills near Strabane in County
Tyrone, 115 miles west of Belfast.
   Later Friday, a court in the Irish Republic refused to block
extradition of Robert Russell to Northern Ireland, where he will
resume a 20-year prison sentence imposed in 1978 for the attempted
murder of a policeman.
   Russell, 30, is suspected of membership in the IRA, which is
outlawed on both sides of the border. He escaped from the Maze
Prison in Northern Ireland during a mass breakout in 1983 and has
fought extradition since.
   Members of Sinn Fein, the IRA's legal political wing, held a
vigil at Dublin's Mountjoy jail Friday to protest the decision.
   Police said the car bomb defused in Sion Hills contained three
pounds of the lightweight explosive called Semtex, which is made in
Czechoslovakia and has been used by the IRA in its current wave of
attacks on soldiers and other security personnel.
   About 150 families were evacuated from nearby homes while the
bomb squad conducted carefully controlled explosions over five
hours to make the device harmless, police said.
   The British Broadcasting Corp. reported Friday that
Czechoslovakia has promised to stop Semtex from reaching the IRA.
Security forces have said in the past the explosive was included in
arms shipments from Libya.
   A car bomb using Semtex killed a Royal Navy recruiting officer
Monday as he drove home from his office in Belfast.
   On the British mainland, funerals were held for six of eight
soldiers killed Aug. 19 in the IRA bombing of a bus near Omagh,
County Tyrone.
   ``The hope for Ireland is her ordinary people, who will never be
daunted by the men and women of violence,'' the Rev. Robert Ray
told 400 mourners at the funeral of Pvt. Jason Winter, 19, in
Lyngford, 120 miles west of London.
   About 10 miles farther west, leather-jacketed motorcyclists
accompanied the hearse of Pvt. Peter Bullock, 21, a fellow member
of the Somerset Sickle Bikers Club, to the cemetery at Stoke sub
Hamdon, Somerset.
   The bikers sent a wreath in the shape of a motorcycle wheel. It
joined another wreath, one of six sent to the funerals bearing the
message, ``From the people of County Tyrone.''
   Twenty-seven military personnel have been killed this summer by
IRA attacks in Northern Ireland, mainland Britain and continental
Europe. The bus attack was the deadliest since 1982.
   The IRA is fighting to drive the British from Northern Ireland
and unite the Protestant-dominated province with the republic,
which is overwhelmingly Roman Catholic.
   Labor Party lawmaker Tony Benn, who is making a left-wing
challenge to Neil Kinnock for the party leadership, said in
Glasgow, Scotland, that Britain should leave in January 1990.
   ``If a peacekeeping force is needed to cover the transition, it
should be a United Nations force,'' he said. ``The argument that
British troops must remain to stop bloodshed is completely invalid,
for these troops are a central part of the problem.''

<HEAD>Toyota Funds Repairs On Some Out-Of-Warranty Parts</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Toyota Motor Corp. sometimes repays dealers who
make repairs on out-of-warranty parts, but an executive on Friday
denied that the practice constitutes a ``secret warranty'' used to
quiet customers who complain.
   Bob Daly, Toyota's national service operations manager,
confirmed information from a 12-page Toyota document published
Friday in The Detroit News that lists 41 components for which
Toyota Motor Sales USA can be reimbursed by its Japanese parent
company.
   The reimbursements let dealers provide free service on the
components, but Toyota spokesman Jerry Giaquinta stressed that the
list does not set guidelines on what work can be done free of
charge.
   Toyota district offices decide what parts will be repaired or
replaced without charge, he said.
   The document lists items including cracked dashboard pads,
peeling blue paint, slipping automatic transmissions, worn engine
cylinders, camshafts, cruise controls, catalytic converters, fuel
pumps, and brakes.
   Daly said a customer generally has to complain to get the free
repairs.
   ``A dealer might point out to him that a component shouldn't
have failed and offer to seek reimbursement from Toyota, but in
most cases it would be up to the customer to request it,'' he said.
   Most automakers long have acknowledged paying for selected
post-warranty repairs to keep customers satisfied, but Toyota's
list apparently is the longest made public, the newspaper said.
   Clarence Ditlow, director of the Center for Auto Safety, a
public interest group in Washington, D.C., called the policy a
``secret warranty'' used to quiet complaining customers while
others who do not complain are charged for the same repairs.
   ``What they're doing is taking care of customers who are likely
to cause them image problems by squawking too loudly, while
ignoring thousands of others who don't complain,'' Ditlow said.
   ``We do not have a secret warranty,'' Daly said. ``We make a
case-by-case determination under our customer satisfaction policy
whether to reimburse for a repair that occurs beyond the normal
warranty.''

   Local officials have asked the
Federal Aviation Administration to investigate North Perry Airport
after a small plane crash killed three people, the latest in a
string of accidents at the airport, a county spokesman said Friday.
   Meanwhile, federal investigators were at the printing shop that
was destroyed when a twin-engine Piper Aerostar crashed shortly
after takeoff Thursday and exploded into flames. All three people
aboard the plane were killed.
   ``They are still there completing the on-scene investigation and
getting ready to move some of the wreckage,'' said George Prellezo
of the National Transportation Safety Board office in Miami. FAA
officials also are examining the wreckage.
   Before Thursday's crash, four people had been killed in 16
accidents involving planes taking off or landing at the airport in
this Fort Lauderdale suburb since 1982, Broward County spokesman
Ron Gardner said. The airport is used mainly by small planes.
   Gardner said FAA officials in Florida had agreed to the county
Aviation Department's request for an investigation. He also said
the department had asked the national Aircraft Owners and Pilots
Association and the North Perry Airport Safety Committee to examine
the airport's operations.
   Jack Barker, an FAA spokesman in Atlanta, said he was not aware
of plans to investigate the airport. Nevertheless, he said a
special FAA inspection of the facility in May found fewer safety
problems than a similar inspection a year before.
   County officials recently announced a $575,000 plan to add 1,000
feet to the 3,000-foot airport runways.
   ``This will put aircraft at a higher altitude when they cross
the airport's boundaries, and this gives a pilot who gets in
trouble the maneuverability area to possibly turn back to the
airport,'' Gardner said.
   Some residents of the densely populated neighborhoods
surrounding the airport strongly oppose to the small aircraft
traffic.
   ``I'm going to start a petition to get those small planes out of
here,'' said real estate broker Jeanette Piazza. ``I'm serious
about this.''
   According to witnesses and FAA reports, the six-seat Piper
circled several times before clipping power lines and plunging into
a strip shopping plaza about a mile from the runway.
   ``He didn't get very high, maybe 100 to 150 feet at the most,''
said Bruce Hill, an accident investigator with the NTSB.
   FAA spokesman Charles Wright in Atlanta said no flight plan was
filed and the plane's destination was unknown. But Gardner said
flight plans aren't required for many local flights.
   The dead pilot was identified as Lewis Phillips, 55, who owns
Lauderdale Aviation at North Perry. Names of his two passengers
were not immediately released.
   A typesetter at the printing shop, Kelli Crist, 24, suffered
burns over 27 percent of her body and was in critical condition at
Jackson Memorial Hospital in Miami, said spokesman Michael Mirando.
   Three other stores in the shopping center were destroyed.
Officials estimate the damage at about $1 million.
   ``I'm a pilot myself,'' said Phillips' widow, Pat. ``I know
there's been a lot of problems at that airport and I don't want it
to look bad or I don't want my husband to look bad.''

   President Reagan made a recess appointment
Friday of Robert B. Oakley as ambassador to the Islamic Republic of
Pakistan, the White House announced.
   Oakley is a career foreign service officer and has served as the
State Department's anti-terrorism chief.
   The official takes the place of Arnold Raphel, who was killed in
a plance explosion last week with Pakistani President Mohammad Zia
Ul-Haq.
   Secretary of State George Shultz traveled to Zia's funeral with
Oakley and introduced him as the designated man for the post.
   Reagan made the appointment while in California for his annual

   Michael Dukakis applauded Republican rival George
Bush's statement that deployment of the costly ``Star Wars'' space
defense system should be contingent on further research, saying
Friday that ``I'm glad to see that the vice president now agrees
with me.''
   The Massachusetts governor spent Friday at the Statehouse, but
campaign aides said his time in the capital would soon begin
dwindling. They said Dukakis planned to spend only one full day in
Boston after Labor Day, devoting at least five days a week to
campaigning.
   Dukakis' only public event was a swearing-in ceremony for a new
member of the Massachusetts Port Authority, the agency that
oversees Logan International Airport, the Boston Fish Pier and
several roads and commerce centers.
   He was not scheduled to field questions from reporters. But he
responded when asked about Bush's comments, published in Friday's
editions of The New York Times, that the Strategic Defense
Initiative, the formal name for the space defense system, was
``very expensive'' and that deployment decisions should await
further research.
   Dukakis said the comments showed that Bush was backing away from
his earlier position, although the vice president said several
weeks ago that he would deploy the system as soon as it was
feasible.
   ``I think that makes sense,'' Dukakis said of Bush's latest
statement. ``I'm glad to see that the vice president now agrees
with me and a great number of American citizens.''
   Dukakis was attending a fund-raiser Friday evening and heading
to Washington on Saturday to participate in ceremonies marking the
25th anniversary of the civil rights march on the nation's capital
led by the late Martin Luther King Jr.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Farmers suffering drought losses will not be
allowed to double up on benefits under ongoing emergency livestock
feed provisions and the new disaster payment program, the
Agriculture Department said Friday.
   Undersecretary Roland R. Vautour said that if a farmer has a
crop loss that would qualify him for both programs, he cannot
collect on the same loss twice.
   ``However, a livestock producer who has a loss of 1988 crop corn
production could receive emergency livestock feed assistance based
on part of his loss and disaster payments based on the remainder,''
Vautour said.
   The basic restrictions are spelled out by the Disaster
Assistance Act of 1988. Vautour said the while the statutory
provisions of the new law went into effect on Friday, the
regulations and operating procedures which will implement these
provisions have not been completed.
   ``Producers should start assembling their sales receipts and
other data to substantiate their actual production information,''
he said.
   Department officials have said they hope to begin actual
operation of the $3.9 billion drought-aid law by Oct. 1. At that
time, they hope, farmers can begin applying at country offices of
the department's Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation
Service for benefits.

<TEXT>
   Besides the damage, the
forest fires ravaging the nation's oldest park are giving those
visitors who are still around a new persective on a landscape
normally crowded with summer tourists.
   At Mud Volcano, an area of boiling cauldrons several miles north
of Fishing Bridge, the smell of smoke from distant fires mingled
with the stench of sulfer from the cauldrons.
   The fires have charred more than 400,000 acres of forest and
forced large sections of the park to close.
   The parking lot for Mud Volcano is sprawling, but Melanie and
Lanny Simcoff and their children were alone in it. One other small
group was working its way along the boardwalk through the area.
   The family, from San Francisco, had planned to leave the
community of Lake on Wednesday and head south into Grand Teton
National Park, but the fires closed the road to Grand Teton.
   ``We're going to go back to Lake and rent a rowboat and row
around by ourselves,'' said Mrs. Simcoff. ``Actually, though, I
kind of enjoy being alone in Yellowstone at the height of the
tourist season.''
   Ed and Sue Kline were staying at Fishing Bridge, a small resort
on the north end of Yellowstone Lake that has avoided the flames.
   ``We've been just enjoying ourselves on this side of the park,''
said Kline, of Irvine, Calif. ``We'll do some fishing, go on a
couple of hikes and make the best of a difficult situation.''
   Bob Shaw, assistant manager of the general store at Fishing
Bridge, shook his head at his almost empty store, which had roughly
a dozen people in it Friday morning.
   ``Normally, the first three weeks in August are peak season,''
said Shaw.
   Sandy Snell is a ranger-naturalist who has been turned into a
media escort. Once the fires are gone she'll have a new lesson to
impart on park visitors.
   ``We'll tell people about what happened this summer, about it
being an usually dry year and about Park Service policy on fires,''
she said. ``And we'll talk a lot about fire ecology and hopefully
give people walks through some of the fire areas and compare them
with some of the unburned areas.
   ``It will be a real good opportunity to see the changes that
take place,'' Snell added. ``It's like a living laboratory. We'll
learn a lot from it, I'm sure.''

<DATELINE>CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sen. Paul Simon defended U.S.
sanctions against South Africa on Friday, the end of a five-day
visit, and contended that most blacks support the measures.
   Simon, an Illinois Democrat who ran unsuccessfully earlier this
year for his party's presidential nomination, said the United
States has the responsibility to protest South Africa's system of
race discrimination.
   Referring to silence in America when Adolf Hitler first began
persecuting Jews, he said, ``We don't want to repeat that.''
   Simon heads the Senate Foreign Relations subcommittee on African
affairs and will have a major role in debate on pending legislation
to stiffen U.S. sanctions.
   At a news conference Friday Simon said Washington should wait
for greater political change before easing sanctions even if South
Africa's white authorities free Nelson Mandela, the African
National Congress leader who is serving a life prison sentence.
   ``One of the ways that dismay will be expressed is through
sanctions, by my country and increasingly by other nations also,''
Simon said.
   ``We find no pleasure in imposing sanctions. It is not done as
punishment, but as the only clear signal we know how to send that
we want this great country of yours to also become a just country.''
   Simon met with both government and opposition leaders during his
tour.
   He said some blacks he met opposed sanctions, but he said a
majority support them. Many Americans who oppose sanctions say they
hurt South African blacks more than the government, and South
Africa has made similar arguments.
   By law and custom, apartheid establishes a racially segregated
society in which the 26 million blacks have no vote in national
affairs. The 5 million whites control the economy and maintain
separate districts, schools and health services.
   Government officials say they are pursuing gradual race reforms
and will not be hurried by sanctions.
   The sanctions approved by the U.S. Congress in 1986 forbid all
new public and private loans to this nation and bar trade in
certain products.

   A rape victim's parents said Friday they
were so outraged by the assault on their daughter that they had no
choice but to pursue her attacker for more than a year.
   Their persistence led to the arrest of Robert Biddings of
Columbus, who was indicted Friday in the rape of the daughter and
four other women and girls. Police said he is a suspect in as many
as five dozen attacks attributed to the so-called handcuff rapist.
   ``That is every parent's first reaction: `I'll go out and get
the person who did this to my child,''' said the mother. ``But the
feeling never left me, and I always had a very strong premonition
that he would return.''
   Police said the woman, standing at the same bus stop where her
daughter was attacked in June 1987, acted as a decoy while her
armed husband watched and waited in the dark.
   The couple, who agreed to a news conference on the condition
they not be identified, said they staked out the spot only a few
times before the wife was attacked Aug. 5. She was grabbed from
behind, carried to a nearby yard and thrown to the ground before
her husband managed to frighten the man off. The couple got a
license number that led to Biddings' arrest.
   Biddings, 34, was charged by the grand jury with 12 counts of
rape, six counts of kidnapping, two counts of aggravated robbery
and one count of felonious assault in connection with the attack on
the mother and the rapes of her daughter and four others.
   Prosecutor Michael Miller said the investigation is continuing
and more charges could be brought. The nickname ``handcuff rapist''
resulted from the use of handcuffs early in the four-year series of
attacks.
   At the news conference, the couple sat, nervous and unsmiling
but holding hands, as reporters questioned them. Their 23-year-old
daughter was with them, and all three were hidden from television
cameras by a screen.
   The mother said she and her husband decided to go looking for
their daughter's attacker shortly after the incident occurred. She
said she was never afraid during the stakeouts.
   ``I was furious,'' she said.
   Her husband said police discouraged both of them.
   ``I was not hesitant at taking the law into my own hands,'' he
said. ``Me and my wife had concerns, we had talked about it for
numerous, numerous hours ... the dangers of it. I made a serious
attempt at discouraging her from doing it.''
   Their daughter said she had no idea what her parents were doing,
initially.
   ``After I found out, I was very scared for them, and I was upset
that my mother was hurt over this,'' she said. ``I'm very proud of
them, however.''
   The courthouse news conference was arranged by the prosecutor's
office. In addition to media inquiries, the office said it had also
been deluged by people interested in producing a television movie
about the case.
   ``I don't understand all the attention, actually,'' the mother
said. ``We're private people. We did what we had to do and don't
feel we should get any credit for doing anything. We're
embarrassed. I'm very embarrassed.''
   Although their persistence paid off, the couple said they would
discourage others from doing the same.
   ``It's very dangerous. Everything went wrong. It didn't happen
the way it was supposed to,'' the mother said. ``He wasn't supposed
to get his hands on me. I could have been killed.''
   But their daughter said the arrest encouraged her.
   ``It makes me feel like there is hope,'' the daughter said.
``Never give up on your police and not to be afraid to step forward
... because even though he has assaulted you and it's all said and
done, maybe you can stop him from assaulting someone else and stop
someone else from going through the pain.''

<TEXT>
   The fiery sorghum liquor maotai no longer will be
served at state banquets, the official media said Friday.
   Xinhua, the news agency, said the Foreign Ministry has decided
to stop serving hard liquor at banquets for foreign dignitaries.
Only wines were served Thursday night at a dinner given by Premier
Li Peng for Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita of Japan, the report
said.
   The government is conducting a campaign against public waste and
extravagance. The banquet, a popular function in China, is a prime
target.
   Menus now are to be held to four courses, not the customary 10
or 15, and feasting is expected to end in 1{ hours. The rule on
liquor follows removal of price controls on maotai and other
liquors, which caused huge price increases.
   A bottle of maotai, previously set at $5.40 but accessible only
to people with good connections, now costs more than $40.

<HEAD>Experts Say Seals Not Killed By Virus</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: LEADS thruout to UPDATE with higher estimate of dead seals,
new seal deaths off Britain, upcoming meeting</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By PAUL VERSCHUUR</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Researchers have determined
something other than a viral epidemic killed thousands of North Sea
seals, but a government spokesman making the announcement Friday
refused to give the cause.
   Officials in London said seals had begun to die in British
waters and estimated more than 10,000 of the marine mammals have
died in recent months.
   If accurate, that estimate would represent a major increase in
the number. Scientists elsewhere in Western Europe have estimated
the number about 3,000 lower.
   Animal health experts and environmentalists had speculated
chemical pollution in the water may have lowered the seals' ability
to fight disease.
   The Dutch National Institute for Public Health and Environmental
Protection has determined what caused the seal deaths and is
working on a cure, according to a Health Ministry official who
spoke Friday on condition of anonymity. She said the researchers
would disclose their findings next week.
   Neither the herpes nor the picorna viruses widely held
responsible for the seal deaths are the main cause, the spokeswoman
said, adding that the findings resulted from months of research by
the institute and the Seal Clinic in the nothern Dutch village of
Pieterburen, western Europe's biggest hospital for seals.
   She said the researchers ``have proved it was one definite
factor'' that killed the seals. Although other factors may have
contributed to the disease, the spokeswoman said, ``it was the
straw that broke the camel's back. ... All the dead seals had it.''
   The disease apparently undermines the mammals' disease-fighting
immune system and they usually die of pneumonia or liver infection.
``Whether environmental pollution has played a role I don't know,''
she said.
   According to the spokewoman, the researchers are expecting to
disclose details of a possible cure for the disease when they
publish their findings Thursday in the British scientific magazine
Nature.
   ``All I'm allowed to say is that I'm very happy,'' Seal Clinic
director Lenie't Hart told The Associated Press.
   Since May 1, a total of 216 seals died along Britain's coasts
and 18 perished killed off Northern Ireland, officials of the
government-run Natural Environment Research Council said Friday in
London.
   Officials of the council's Sea Mammal Research Unit said more
than 10,000 seals have died in the North Sea. They estimated the
world population at 500,000.
   Previous estimates said up to 3,500 seals have died in West
German coastal waters and 3,000 more deaths had cut the Danish seal
population in half. More than 800 were reported to have died off
Norway and the Netherlands.
   Britain's Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals
said it had organized a conference for next Tuesday to formulate
plans to handle the immediate problems created by dead and dying
seals.

   Jane Fonda's apology for supporting North Vietnam
during the Vietnam War has failed to impress the Veterans of
Foreign Wars, who voted to ask Congress to try her for treason.
   During their 89th annual convention this week, 13,400 VFW
delegates adopted three resolutions concerning Fonda, including one
saying ``a mere apology is not enough to redeem the situation.''
   The VFW also denounced her upcoming movie ``Union Street,'' and
called for her ``to be tried by the United States government as a
traitor.'' The last resolution passed unanimously by voice vote.
   ``How do you go back 20 years and make amends?'' VFW spokesman
Vern Pall said. ``What is this woman really after? This is no way
to redeem the hurt and pain she caused those troops in Vietnam.''
   Fonda, an ardent opponent of U.S. involvement in Vietnam, took a
highly publicized trip to Hanoi in 1972.
   Last June, at her request, she appeared on the ABC program
``20-20,'' saying she was ``very sorry for some of what I did.''
   Fonda's publicist, Steve Rivers, said Friday from Los Angeles,
``The Justice Department stated in 1972 that Jane hadn't done
anything wrong.''
   Fonda reached an out-of-court settlement with the federal
government in 1979 in which she agreed not to press a $1 million
lawsuit, in exchange for the FBI's admission that it spied on her
improperly and its promise to adhere to Justice Department
guidelines in the future.
   One resolution passed by the group Wednesday said the VFW ``is
not insensitive to a sincere expression of contrition.''
   ``But the VFW wants to be assured that the `apology' is not
simply a means of bolstering her sagging career and political
fortunes,'' it said.
   Fonda's husband, California Assemblyman and former anti-war
activist Tom Hayden, has faced similar campaigns, including an
unsuccessful attempt by veterans groups to have him ousted from the
legislature as a ``traitor'' in 1986.

   Two bombs jolted the Moslem part of the
city Friday and residents joined a strike against what they view as
Israeli and U.S. support for Christian militias blocking election
of a pro-Syrian president.
   The bombs exploded in west Beirut in the early evening within
hours of each other, police said, but no casualties were reported.
   One went off at a garbage dump and the other in a narrow street
off a commercial district. They shattered windows and wrecked
shutters of shops in both areas. No group claimed responsibility.
   In South Lebanon, U.N. peacekeeping troops what they suspected
of being a car bomb but the vehicle did not contain explosives.
   The strike closed government offices, banks, shops, restaurants,
gasoline stations, amusement centers and other businesses in west
Beirut and areas policed by Syrian soldiers. Sponsors said
bakeries, pharmacies, hospitals and the news media were exempt.
   However, life was normal in Christian east Beirut and the
385-square-mile Christian enclave northeast of the capital, police
said.
   The Lebanese Forces, the main Christian militia, opposed the
strike and a spokesman described it as ``a reflection of Syria's
hegemony.''
   ``The Syrians have forced their surrogates to call the strike
after the defeat of their candidate in the first round of the
presidential elections,'' the Lebanese Forces official said,
speaking on condition of anonymity.
   Syria is Lebanon's main power broker. It has 40,000 soldiers
stationed in the north and south and in sections of Beirut.
   Parliament failed Aug. 18 to muster the needed quorum to elect a
president. The only serious candidate was Suleiman Franjieh,
Syria's closest Christian ally in Lebanon and a personal friend of
Syrian President Hafez Assad.
   Leftists and Moslem militia leaders have blamed Parliament's
failure to elect Franjieh, 78, on American and Israeli opposition.
   Beirut's leading independent daily paper An-Nahar said last week
the quorum was not achieved because the United States opposed the
election of a ``confrontational candidate.''
   Several businessmen in west Beirut voiced doubt that the strike
would lead to the election of a new head of state before the
six-year term of President Amin Gemayel expires Sept. 23.
   ``This is playacting,'' said a grocer who identified himself
only as Abu Musbah. ``I don't believe that a president brought in
by a strike would be good for a country which has been on strike
for years.''
   He was referring to the 13-year-old civil war, which has claimed
more than 130,000 lives and shattered the nation's economy, once
the most flourishing in the Middle East.
   A spokesman for the U.N. Interim Force in Lebanon said Fijian
soldiers found the red Renault deserted a few yards from their
checkpoint and reported it was rigged with ``a quantity of
explosives.''
   The peacekeepers' Swedish engineers fired two anti-tank shells
at the car almost seven hours after it was discovered deserted, the
spokesman said.
   ``The shells exploded destroying the vehicle. There was no other
explosion, apparently the car didn't contain any explosives,'' said
the spokesman, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   U.N. troops sealed off the area and blocked traffic along the
coastal highway south of the port of Tyre after the car was
discovered.

   The Security Council condemned on Friday
the use of chemical weapons in the Iran-Iraq war, expressing deep
dismay over their ``more intense and frequent'' use against Iran.
   The 15 council members voted unanimously to condemn the use of
chemical weapons a violation of a 1925 Geneva protocol.
   The British-sponsored resolution did not name Iraq as the
attacker but cited reports by U.N. chemical weapons experts
accusing the government in Baghdad of using poison gas, including a
mustard gas attack on an Iranian city Aug. 2.
   At that time, both Iran and Iraq had accepted Security Council
Resolution 598 demanding a cease-fire in the 8-year-old war, but no
truce date had been set.
   Peace talks opened Thursday in Geneva. A Kurdish guerrilla
group, the Kurdish Democratic Party, claims Iraq dropped poison gas
bombs on six Kurdish villages in northern Iraq that day.
   Kurds have been fighting Iraq, Iran and Turkey for more than 50
years for a separate homeland.
   Sir Crispin Tickell, the British ambassador to the United
Nations, said, ``There are extremely delicate discussions taking
place in Geneva at the moment. We would not wish to do anything to
upset those discussions.
   ``The resolution makes perfectly clear in the preamble who we
think has been using chemical weapons, and I think it's best for
the moment to leave it at that.''
   The preamble notes the Security Council is ``deeply dismayed by
the (investigative) missions' conclusions that there had been
continued use of chemical weapons in the conflict between Iran and
Iraq and that such use against Iranians had become more intense and
frequent.''
   Iraq admitted last month that it had used chemical weapons, but
claimed Iran used them first. Iran says it has the ability to
produce such weapons but has not done so.
   The resolution asked other nations to halt the export of
chemicals used to produce such weapons, and encouraged
Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar to promptly investigate
allegations of the use of chemical weapons.
   It noted the continuing negotiations of the Conference on
Disarmament in Geneva on banning the development, production and
stockpiling of chemical weapons and arranging the destruction of
current stockpiles.
   The 1925 Geneva protocol bans the use of chemical and biological
weapons but does not prohibit their manufacture.
   The Security Council passed a similar resolution in May, but
that one did not specifically cite the use of chemical weapons
against Iranians.
   On Tuesday, the Security Council released a report by U.N.
investigators that blamed Iraq for using mustard gas Aug. 2 in an
air raid on Oshnaviyah, an Iranian city near the northeast corner
of Iraq.
   U.N. experts found chemical and medical evidence of mustard gas
use, and found splinters of shells similar to those found after
attacks on Iranian civilians in 1984, 1986, 1987 and earlier this
year, ``indicating their utilization during an Iraqi air attack on
Oshnaviyeh.''
   Iranian authorities said the air raid injured 2,680 civilians.
No deaths were reported. The U.N. experts interviewed 24 patients
who were still hospitalized when they visited the areas Aug. 12-14.
   Council members stood for a minute of silence at the opening of
their meeting Friday in memory of Pakistan's President Mohammad Zia
ul-Haq, who died in a plane crash Aug. 17.

   The U.N. chief recessed Persian Gulf peace talks
Friday for a day of ``reflection'' after a four-hour session during
which Iran and Iraq apparently took uncompromising positions on how
define their common border.
   ``I hope that on Sunday, after reflection, flexibility perhaps
will start,'' U.N. Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar told
reporters after presiding over a joint session with the two
delegations. ``We are making progress slowly, but we are trying.''
   Iran's foreign minister, Ali Akbar Velayati, first raised the
border problem in a brief public statement Friday, the second day
of talks which are expected to last months, if not years.
   He said Iran insists that implementation of the U.N. cease-fire
resolution 598, which provides for withdrawal of forces ``to
internationally recognized boundaries,'' be based on a 1975 treaty
between Iran and Iraq.
   That treaty was aimed at settling centuries of border disputes
between Iran and Iraq. President Saddam Hussein of Iraq repudiated
it on Sept. 17, 1980, five days before Iraqi forces invaded Iran
following border clashes. Iraq wants the peace talks to include a
renegotiation of the border.
   Velayati also made it plain that Iran wants an independent body
to be formed quickly to assign blame for the 8-year-old war, which
claimed more than a million dead or wounded.
   Iran expects the body to identify Iraq as the aggressor, a
verdict that could also be the basis for reparation claims.
   Velayati called the 1975 treaty and an ``outline plan'' prepared
by Perez de Cuellar for putting the treaty into effect ``vital
criteria'' for reaching peace.
   The most controversial part of the 1975 treaty made the southern
boundary between Iran and Iraq the middle of the Shatt-al-Arab
waterway, Iraq's only access to the sea at the Persian Gulf. The
treaty granted Iran its claim to the eastern half of the 127-mile
waterway.
   A major cause of the war was the dispute over the Shatt-al-Arab.
   The truce continued to hold meanwhile, but guerrilla groups from
both sides traded new accusations of government-ordered massacres.
   In New York, the U.N. Security Council condemned the use of
chemical weapons in the war, expressing deep dismay over their
``more intense and frequent'' use against Iran.
   The British-sponsored resolution, adopted unanimously by the
15-member council, did not name Iraq as the attacker, but cited
reports by U.N. chemical weapons experts blaming Baghdad for using
poison gas, including a mustard gas attack on the Iranian city of
Oshnaviyah on Aug. 2.
   After Thursday's two-hour opening talks in Geneva, face-to-face
talks were abandoned temporarily and both sides stayed in separate
chambers, with U.N. officials meeting them and reporting back to
Perez de Cuellar.
   But Friday afternoon, both parties met again in joint session.
   Outside the sprawling U.N. complex, about 200 exiled Iraqi Kurds
protested Iraq's use of chemical weapons and waved banners
demanding, ``Stop the massacre of Kurds.''
   A Kurdish guerrilla group, the Kurdish Democratic Party, charged
that six Iraqi air force planes dropped poison gas bombs on Kurdish
villages in northern Iraq on Thursday, the day the Geneva talks
started. A spokesman who telephoned the Nicosia bureau of The
Associated Press said that 88 civilians were killed and 500 were
injured.
   Moslems attending the Friday prayer service in Geneva's
imposing, Saudi-financed mosque passed a large colored poster
illustrating the chemical bombing of the Iraqi Kurdish town of
Halabja, which Iran said killed 5,000 people last March.
   Iraq-based Iranian guerrillas, meanwhile, accused Iran of
killing political prisoners.
   Massoud Rajavi, leader of the Iranian People's Mujahedeen
guerrillas, called on Perez de Cuellar to send a mission to Iran to
halt an ``accelerated pace of killings.''
   He charged Iranian authorities arrested more than 10,000 people
on political charges in the past few weeks and that hundreds of
Mujahedeen sympathizers were executed.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Here are some comments Friday from the
presidential campaign trail:
   
   GEORGE BUSH, slamming Michael Dukakis for criticizing the Reagan
administration's drug efforts: ``He is the governor who vetoed the
mandatory sentencing for drug dealers. He opposes capital
punishment for drug kingpins. And he fought tooth and nail to keep
that outrageous furlough program that lets murderers, rapists and
drug dealers out on appeal.''
   
   MICHAEL DUKAKIS, applauding Bush's statement that deployment of
the ``Star Wars'' space defense system should be contingent on
further research: ``I think that makes sense. I'm glad to see that
the vice president now agrees with me and a great number of
American citizens.''
   
   DAN QUAYLE, saying he won't authorize the public release of his
academic records: ``I don't want you to go through and pore over
all those mediocre grades I got.''
   
   JESSE JACKSON, pledging to get out the vote for the Democratic
ticket: ``Bush and Quayle want to privatize the Justice Department.
They want to privatize foreign policy. They want to privatize
public education. And since they like privacy so much, I want to
help them move back into private life.''
   
   Sen. JOHN STENNIS, D-Miss., praising his colleague Lloyd Bentsen
during a campaign stop in Jackson: ``I was really thrilled when I
heard ... he was going to be the candidate for vice president. No
one there (in the Senate) excels him, and not too many equal him.''

<DATELINE>TAMPA, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A jury Friday convicted a man of murdering
and dismembering a prostitute whose remains were discovered three
years later, stuffed in a back porch freezer.
   The 12-member panel later returned to deliberations and
unanimously recommended James Warren Bailey, 45, of Tampa be
electrocuted for the March 1985 slaying of Kimberly Ann Hanlon.
   In Florida, a jury recommendation is not binding on the judge,
who in capital cases has the final say between life in prison and
death. Hillsborough Circuit Judge Richard Lazzara set sentencing
for Sept. 26.
   The jury convicted Bailey after more than five hours
deliberations over two days.
   Hanlon, 27, was shot once in the back of the head. Her limbs and
head were then severed with a power saw.
   Bailey's 14-year-old daughter tipped police after she and a
friend found the frozen body on the family's cluttered back porch
in March.
   The state argued that Hanlon was killed because she was dealing
drugs for Bailey and he thought she had cheated him.
   James A. Whyte, 26, a two-time Florida felon with an admitted
drug problem, testified for the prosecution that he helped hold the
woman at Bailey's home while she was beaten and raped by Bailey and
co-defendant Irvin George Riley, a 28-year-old former Martins
Ferry, Ohio, resident who is schedued for trial on the same charges
later this year.
   Whyte testified that Riley, on Bailey's orders, shot Ms. Hanlon
as Bailey held down her arms and Whyte laid across her legs. Bailey
then cut off her arms, legs and head with a power saw, Whyte said.
   Whyte was promised 25 years probation in a plea bargain with
prosecutors for his testimony.
   ``It must be clear to you that I don't like making deals with
people like Mr. Whyte,'' Assistant Hillsborough State Attorney Mike
Benito told jurors in closing arguments. ``I made a deal with this
guy so you would hear what Mr. Bailey did to Kimberly Hanlon. I
think you needed to know that.''
   Defense attorney Bob Fraser noted that after Bailey was arrested
in March authorities had only a circumstantial case until Whyte
voluntarily contacted police four months later and offered details.
   ``He probably knew there was a body in the freezer. He must
have,'' Fraser said in his closing statement. ``But that doesn't
mean he killed it. ... Whoever killed her loathed her ... For you
to convict my client on Whyte's testimony is preposterous.''
   Bailey did not take the stand.

<HEAD>Experts Dismiss Newspaper Report that Shroud Of Turin Is A Fake</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: New material and editing throughout, UPDATING with

<TEXT>
   A British newspaper reported Friday that the
Shroud of Turin, said to have been wrapped around Jesus after his
crucifixion, is a fake but experts discounted the newspaper report
as unsubstantiated rumor.
   ``As yet, we do not have a final figure,'' Dr. Michael Tite said
Friday night in an interview on Independent Television News.
   The 14-foot cloth kept in Turin Cathedral in Italy bears the
image of a bearded, crucified man.
   Tite is coordinater of radio-carbon dating tests made on the
cloth by Oxford University, the University of Arizona at Tucson,
and the Federal Polytechnic in Zurich, Switzerland.
   He said results from each testing center have been circulated to
the others ``with a proposal for a coordinated date on the shroud
from the samples, but I haven't heard from anyone as of yet.''
   Tite is keeper of the British Museum's research laboratory and
supervised the Oxford tests.
   The London Evening Standard reported without attribution Friday
that radio-carbon dating tests conducted by scientists at Oxford
University showed the shroud was made about 1350.
   However, it quoted Dr. Richard Luckett of Magdalene College,
Cambridge University, as saying: ``I think that as far as seems
possible the scientific argument is now settled and the shroud is a
fake. I suppose there will be certain people who will never believe
it but it seems unlikely'' that the tests could be 1,300 years off.
   ``This report is without any serious foundation,'' said Susan
Black of the British Society for the Holy Shroud of Turin,
established 10 years ago to pursue investigations into the cloth.
   ``There have been so many of these type of reports and they're
all rumors. It's all got totally out of hand.''
   All three institutions conducting tests agreed to keep their
findings secret and forward them to the Roman Catholic Church in
Italy for an official announcement in September or early October.
   Both Luckett and Professor Robert Hedges, head of the
radio-carbon dating laboratory at Oxford which was responsible for
the tests, were unavailable for comment Friday.
   Luckett, whose university is an ancient rival of Oxford, was not
connected with the tests but has been associated with
investigations of its history.
   In Turin, Professor Luigi Gonella, the liaison between Cardinal
Anastasio Ballestrero of Turin and the three laboratories, said he
had received no word from Oxford and was ``amazed'' by the Evening
Standard report.
   Gonella said Oxford scientists made blind-tests on three samples.
   ``They were asked to date the three samples, not to determine
which of them belongs to the shroud,'' he said.
   He confirmed that the Oxford experiments were completed but said
results wouldn't be released until after scientists from the three
laboratories met to coordinate them.
   Tite said earlier Friday that an announcement on results ``will
be made in September or early October by Turin via the Vatican
press office.''
   He said each laboratory received three samples of cloth, but
were not told what they were. He said samples were taken from the
shroud and from medieval and other cloths.
   ``It was blind-testing,'' he said.
   Announcement of the results is expected to come from
Ballestrero, who authorized thumbnail-size samples to be cut from
the shroud kept in his cathedral.
   University of Arizona geoscientist Paul E. Damon and physicist
Douglas J. Donahue headed the Arizona study of the shroud, but
declined comment.
   Spokeswoman Janet Bingham said she was ``pretty sure our guys do
not know the results from the other institutions,'' and that the
Arizona scientists ``just can't make any comments until it's the
official announcment. They will not comment on any rumors.''
   Ms. Bingham said she had spoken with Tite, who ``assures me that
they have not released any information.''

<HEAD>Premier Calls Press Censorship a Mistake</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Sadek el-Mahdi said
censoring foreign media this week was an overreaction to
unfavorable coverage of floods and Sudan's lagging relief efforts.
The restrictions are being dropped.
   He told an Italian television interviewer Thursday that
falsehoods had been written about the situation in Sudan but the
censorship was a mistake.
   Abdullah Jallab, acting undersecretary in the Information
Ministry, told The Associated Press on Friday: ``We do not have
censorship, and we do not believe in its effectiveness.''
   Information Minister el-Sayed Abdallah Mohammed Ahmed, ordered
foreign journalists and photographers Wednesday to take pictures
and interviews only while accompanied by a ministry representative.
He also said news or photos could not be sent from Sudan without a
censor's stamp.
   El-Mahdi said Thursday that Sudan ``is a free country with an
independent judiciary'' and anyone whose rights are violated by the
press has recourse to the courts.
   Jallab, interviewed in English, said Friday: ``The prime
minister is the highest executive ... so his statement would
eventually cancel any previous measures.''
   Sudanese officials, including the prime minister have denounced
stories in foreign news media attributing corruption and
incompetence to the relief effort for 1.5 million people left
homeless by three weeks of flooding in the Khartoum area.
   Jallab said no journalist had been censored and none would be.
He said ministry representatives assigned to accompany
photographers and television crews were there to help with
logistics, not to censor.
   ``We are only facilitating their missions. We do not tell them
what to do,'' Jallab said. ``One of the reasons that led to the
ouster of the former regime was the lack of press freedom.''
   The measures Ahmed outlined were similar to those in effect
during most of the 16-year rule of Gaafar Nimeiri, whose presidency
ended in a military coup in April 1985.
   El-Mahdi's civilian government took over a year later and has
maintained some of the most liberal press laws in Africa.

   A defendant in what is believed to be the
longest federal criminal trial in American history wanted special
consideration because of his sleep disorder, so he asked the judge
about his ``sleeping motion.''
   ``I thought we had put that to bed,'' U.S. District Judge Harold
A. Ackerman replied to the laughter and groans of the defendants
and attorneys in his Newark courtroom.
   On another day, Ackerman angered some when he called one motion
``creative nonsense at best.''
   Ackerman, 60, spent nearly two years with the Herculean task of
handling the U.S. v. Accetturo, et al. case.
   The trial ended Friday when the jury, after 21 months of
proceedings but only 14 hours of deliberations, acquitted all 20
defendants of racketeering charges. The defendants, alleged to be
members of the Lucchese crime family, had been charged with
organized crime activities in New Jersey.
   During the trial, 20 litigators, including some of New Jersey's
most highly regarded lawyers, and two defendants representing
themselves filled Ackerman's courtroom. He acted as referee to a
throng of egos, and sometimes one of his toughest tasks was just
keeping the courtroom quiet.
   He made more than 100 rulings on legal motions. Legal papers
from the case fill 15 feet of file drawers.
   Ackerman's judicial record includes a landmark decision in a
civil racketeering case brought by the government against Teamsters
Local 560. In 1984, Ackerman ruled that the Union City local had
been dominated by organized crime for a quarter century and placed
it under a trustee's control, the first such action in the nation.
   Earlier this year, because of comments he had made in news
reports in his typically outspoken fashion, ousted union officials
sought to have Ackerman removed from the case. The 3rd U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals refused.
   At about the same time, the appellate court was considering
another Ackerman matter. The judge had ordered a lawyer and his
firm back into the Lucchese trial after a key defendant's attorney
contracted cancer.
   The lawyer fought his appointment in appeals to the U.S. Supreme
Court and lost. Along the way, though, the 3rd Circuit mildly
chided Ackerman for the ``leisurely pace'' of the trial.
   The judge then lengthened trial days and reduced delays.
   Ackerman attended Seton Hall University and Rutgers University,
where he received his law degree in 1951.
   The former sportswriter served as a judge in the state Division
of Workmen's Compensation and was a state judge in Union County
before President Carter nominated him for U.S. District Court in
1980.

<HEAD>Mexican Opposition Spars With Governing Party Over Elections</HEAD>

   Opposition lawmakers showed up Friday at the
House of Deputies for a continuing session to certify the results
of July elections, and a governing party leader threatened to go
ahead without them if necessary.
   Opposition deputies had walked out of the session early Thursday
to protest what they view as the governing party's unwillingness to
check reports of voting fraud in the elections. They returned to
the chamber Thursday afternoon.
   Lawmakers pledged Friday to work round-the-clock if need be to
install a new national House of Deputies in time for outgoing
president Miguel de la Madrid's state-of-the union address Thursday
to a joint session of lawmakers.
   The political sparring reflects a new atmosphere resulting from
the elections. The opposition made major gains against the
Institutional Revolutionary Party, known by its Spanish initials
PRI, which has dominated national politics for nearly 50 years.
   President Miguel de la Madrid is expected on Sept. 1 to formally
present his successor elected in July, Carlos Salinas de Gortari.
Salinas officially takes over for a single six-year term in
December.
   Opposition leaders say the voting was riddled with fraud and
challenge the official results that give Salinas a victory with 50
percent of the vote. His two leading challengers have barnstormed
the country urging people to reject the election results.
   ``The pressure for time is on, and this will oblige the deputies
to sit continuously in the House,'' congressional spokesman Pedro
Pablo Trevino said in a telephone interview.
   Trevino said a majority of deputies had agreed to stay
round-the-clock in permanent session through the weekend if
necessary to certify the vote count.
   The proceedings have unfolded in a raucous atmosphere, with
opposition sympathizers chanting, whistling, and throwing coins and
other objects from the public galleries. The session resumed Friday
with all public but the news media excluded.
   The deputies are sitting as an electoral college to certify the
results of their own elections, and the Senate members have been
doing the same. The House later will certify the presidential vote
count.
   Guillermo Jimenez Morales, leader of the PRI bloc, told
reporters that if necessary, the PRI can muster a bare majority of
one vote, install the lower chamber and proceed with business
without the opposition.
   According to the preliminary vote count, the PRI should get 247
of 500 House seats and the opposition 227, with 26 seats undecided.
   The PRI has never lost a major election since it was formed in
1929 years ago and usually won the presidential race by more than
70 percent of the votes cast.
   Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, a dissident who broke away from the PRI in
November to demand a cleaner electoral process, came in second on
the leftist National Democratic Front ticket with 31 percent. He
claims he actually won the election.
   The conservative National Action Party's Manuel J. Clouthier
came in third with 17 percent.
   Also, for the first time in six decades, the PRI lost four seats
in the Senate _ all to the Cardenas coalition.

<HEAD>Homeless Author Is Offered Shelter by Widow of Violin Thief</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SPRINGFIELD, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A best-selling author whose hard luck
has forced him to live out of his van was offered shelter by the
widow of a man who harbored a famous stolen violin for almost 50
years.
   Marcelle Hall, of Bethel, Conn., said Friday she tracked down
Charles Webb, author of ``The Graduate,'' and his ex-wife wife at a
western Massachusetts motel earlier this week and offered to take
them in after reading of their plight.
   ``I jumped right to the phone as if some power was leading me,''
Mrs. Hall said in a telephone interview. ``I saw their picture and
I thought, `They probably do the same things I do, give it all
away, and sometimes you get shafted.'''
   She said she hoped Webb would write a book about the stolen
violin and how she came to be married to the man who held it for a
half-century.
   But Webb's ex-wife, who uses only the name Fred and who
continues to live with him, said Webb might not be able to write
such a book.
   ``The only problem is that Charles doesn't know if he can write
the story about the violin. He hasn't written anything factual,''
she said.
   Mrs. Hall gained national attention last year when she said her
second husband, Julian Altman, confessed before he died in Aug. 15,
1985, that his violin was a stolen Stradivarius he had bought for
$100 from the man who had stolen it. The violin was stolen at New
York's Carnegie Hall in 1936 from Bronislaw Huberman, an
internationally known violinist who died in 1947.
   The violin was authenticated for its insurer, Lloyd's of London,
which had paid $30,000 to Huberman. Last year, Lloyd's insured it
for $800,000 and reportedly intended to sell it, and Mrs. Hall said
Lloyd's was going to pay her a reward.
   Mrs. Hall said she met Altman in Washington in 1968 and they
married in Las Vegas in March 1985, two days before he was
sentenced to two years in jail for sexually molesting one of her
granddaughters.
   She said Friday that she had married him to regain control of
her financial holdings. After serving four months of his sentence,
he was diagnosed with stomach cancer and moved to a hospital where
he died, Mrs. Hall said.
   Webb's 1962 novel was made into the hit movie of the same name
starring Dustin Hoffman. The movie evoked the discontent of a
generation fed up with materialism. He and Fred came to
Massachusetts in search of a publisher after living for a decade in
their van in southern California.
   In more prosperous days, the Webbs had given away two houses out
of a need, Webb said, to ``get free of things.''
   Fred said the couple would drive to Connecticut on Saturday to
meet Mrs. Hall and consider the offer. ``It sounds a little bit
gothic, but we might be able to handle something like that,'' she
said.
   Webb wrote four novels until 1978, when he stopped writing.
   The Webbs divorced eight years ago after 20 years of marriage
because they believed the institution of marriage violated their
constitutional rights to freedom, Fred said.

   The president of a laboratory was arrested
Friday and charged with illegally throwing medical waste in an open
trash bin outside the office, authorities said.
   A 10-day surveillance of the medical lab uncovered garbage bags
containing hypodermic needles and syringes, blood vials and other
medical waste, said Brooklyn District Attorney Elizabeth Holtzman.
   Two of the blood vials were found to contain hepatitis B virus,
she said.
   Marvin Numeroff, 58, and his company, Universal Diagnostic
Corp., were charged with 21 misdemeanor counts including
second-degree reckless endangerment and violations of the Public
Health Law.
   The most serious charges carry a maximum prison term of one year
in jail. The company and Numeroff also face criminal fines of up to
$26,000 and thousands of dollars in civil penalties.
   Holtzman said that the needles and syringes found in the garbage
bags were not broken or crushed to make them inoperable and were
not placed in puncture-resistant containers as required by law.
   City Sanitation Commissioner Brendon Sexton said his department
received a tip Aug. 16 that medical waste at the lab was being
disposed of in the sewer. Investigators found no evidence of that,
but they did discover the garbage bags with medical waste in the
trash container.
   Among the items found in the bags were 60 loose needles, an
unspecified number of syringes, 25 urine samples, 15 blood vials
and a scalpel blade.
   Sexton, when asked about the rash of medical waste found on
beaches in the metropolitan area this summer, was not optimistic
that authorities would find the source.
   ``We may never know,'' he said.

   The opening of ``The Last Temptation of Christ'' in Salt Lake
City was delayed Friday because someone broke into the movie
theater, stole the film and slashed a screen, police said.
   The Centre Theatre canceled the first showing of Martin
Scorsese's film, but found another copy and held its second
scheduled showing, said Salt Lake City Detective Lt. Mel Shields.
   The movie also made its debut Friday in Atlanta, the heart of
the Bible Belt, with about 300 protesters singing and praying
outside. In Denver, 50 protesters sang hymns and preached in an
attempt to dissuade the nearly 300 people who attended the first
showing there.
   In Atlanta, the movie showed on two screens in a theater complex
at Phipps Plaza, in trendy Buckhead, north of downtown. A short
line began forming two hours before the first show, a mall official
said.
   The movie opened last week in Texas, Arizona and Michigan,
attracting hundreds of pickets. The previous week, the movie opened
in seven U.S. cities, attracting thousands of demonstrators.
   Protesters have objected to the film's portrayal of Christ. The
movie's last scene depicts Christ, while hanging on the cross,
hallucinating about abandoning his role as Savior, having sex with
Mary Magdalene and raising a family. He rejects the temptation.
   The movie has been condemned by Utah's predominant Mormon Church
and other conservative religious denominations nationwide. Some
groups have called for a boycott of the film, and of MCA, the
parent company of Universal Pictures.
   In Salt Lake City, an employee at the theater referred questions
to Cineplex-Odeon spokeswoman Linda Friendly in Toronto, but a
secretary said she had left the office for the day.
   Shields said there were signs that a side door to the downtown
theater was forced. Inside, police found 5-foot-long slashes on the
theater's screen.
   It was not known how the film was shown.
   Police had no suspects, Shields said.
   ``I don't understand what all the big deal is about,'' Kirk
Smith, 30, of Atlanta said after watching the movie there. He said
he had wanted to see it ``before all the hullabaloo started, but
after that started I just wanted to see it more.''
   The protesters marched, sang religious songs, prayed and held a
rally in an area in front of the mall that had been cordoned off
for them.
   Entertainer Pat Boone, in Atlanta for an appearance at an
amusement park, stopped by. ``I don't need to see the film,'' he
told demonstrators. He said he had begun to read the novel on which
the film is based years ago, ``and when I saw where it was going I
put it down.''
   Mall management not only cordoned off an area for the
protesters, but also provided them with portable lavatories and
power for their sound system.
   ``It's because we realize everyone in this issue has rights,''
said Mark Craft, a spokesman for MSA Managment, which runs the mall.
   Craft said business had not been hurt by the controversy. ``If
anything, business is up.''

   A man arrested after allegedly making threats
on President Reagan's life was admitted Friday to a psychiatric
hospital for observation and treatment.
   Frank Colby Sills, 35, was transferred to the Clifton T. Perkins
Hospital on the recommendation of two doctors who examined him
under a court order issued earlier in the day, said Mercy Hospital
spokesman Chris Zang.
   U.S. Magistrate Paul Rosenberg said he was ``satisfied that the
individual may be suffering from a serious mental illness which may
require immediate treatment, in that there is a reasonable cause to
believe that as a result of the mental illness the individual may
be dangerous to himself and others.''
   The arrest came after the Secret Service was contacted Thursday
evening by police in Frederick, Md., who apprehended the man at a
truck stop. Officials said no decision had been made on whether to
press charges against the man.
   ``He did make threatening statements against the president to
police officers and he was subsequently taken into custody by my
agents,'' said Joseph R. Coppola, special agent in charge of the
Secret Service in Baltimore.
   ``He had been traveling in a pickup truck from Indiana to Ohio
where he met a truck driver and offered him $600 to drive him and
his truck to Washington, D.C.,'' Frederick Police Chief Richard
Ashton said. ``So he put his pickup on the back of this other guy's
truck and the closer they got to D.C., the more bizarre this guy's
behavior got. He started talking about killing President Reagan and
blowing up the Pentagon.''
   A Secret Service agent said the man claimed to be from Fort
Wayne, Ind., but the federal public defender released no
biographical information.

<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A court rejected a government
bid Friday to merge the country's second-largest black township
with an impoverished homeland 180 miles away.
   The union, decreed by President P.W. Botha last December, met
widespread opposition among the half-million residents in the
township of Botshabelo. Many feared the government would declare
the distant homeland, Qwaqwa, to be independent and deprive them of
South African citizenship.
   Botshabelo, comprised mostly of clusters of shanties spread
across a treeless plain, is in Orange Free State, the most sparsely
populated and conservative of South Africa's four provinces.
   A three-judge panel of the provincial Supreme Court declared
Botha's proclamation invalid Friday, saying it would not promote
the political development of Botshabelo's residents.
   The government issued no statement after the ruling, made in
response to a case brought by township resident Gauta Lefuo. The
government can appeal the ruling.
   Governing officials said the merger is compatible with their
longstanding policy of locating black ethnic groups in
self-governing or nominally independent homelands. Botshabelo is
made up predominantly of South Sotho people, as is Qwaqwa.
   But the judges said there were few similarities between
Botshabelo and Qwaqwa, aside from ethnicity.
   Established nine years ago, Botshabelo has been depicted by
anti-apartheid activists as a dumping ground for blacks not needed
or wanted in the rest of the Orange Free State. Most of its
residents were expelled from white-owned farms.
   The homeland policy is part of the nation's policy of racial
segregation known as apartheid. By law and custom, apartheid
establishes a racially segregated society in which South Africa's
26 million blacks have no vote in national affairs. The 5 million
whites control the economy and maintain separate districts, schools
and health services.
   After pamphlets were dropped from security force helicopters
announcing the merger, nine Botshabelo clergymen wrote to Botha.
They warned that the situation was ``a recipe for frustration and
resultant violence.''
   ``It is unfeasible that one of the poorest self-governing states
should administer and develop the second-largest black township in
South Africa,'' the clergymen said.
   Soweto, near Johannesburg, is the largest black township in the
country.
   The judgment marked the second major court defeat this year for
the government's policy of homeland consolidation.
   The country's highest court, the Appeal Court, ruled last April
that Botha had acted without proper authority when he incorporated
the 120,000-member community of Moutse into the adjoining,
semi-autonomous homeland of KwaNdebele, northeast of Pretoria.
   Most Moutse residents do not belong to the Ndebele tribe that
predominates in KwaNdebele.

   Customs officers making a random check
of a cattle truck arriving from the Netherlands Friday turned up
1,600 pounds of hashish worth $3.4 million, police said.
   The Dutch truck driver, Teunis Overweel, 32, appeared Friday in
Harwich Magistrate's Court and was charged with illegal importation
of drugs, said police in Harwich, a port city 71 miles northeast of
London.
   Overweel will be held in custody pending another court
appearance next Tuesday, said a police spokesman who demanded
anonymity.
   The truck was not carrying livestock. Police said the drug was
concealed in trays in the chassis.
   Police said they did not know Overweel's hometown.

   The officer in charge of the Navy Rescue
Swimmer School went on trial Friday in the death of a recruit after
a military judge refused to dismiss the dereliction-of-duty charges.
   Lawyers for Lt. Thomas A. Torchia had asked for dismissal on the
grounds that Vice Adm. N.R. Thunman, chief of naval education and
training, was biased against Torchia in convening the court-martial
and had tried to influence its outcome. Defense lawyers cited the
admiral's comments to news media Mirecki's family and a
congressional committee.
   But the judge, Cmdr. Newell D. Krogmann, ruled that Thunman's
statements were non-prejudicial.
   ``He never indicated any culpability by any one with regard to
the death,'' Krogmann said.
   Also Friday, Torchia's lawyers exercised their right to have the
case decided by a panel of officers rather than the judge, and four
officers were selected. They will hear opening statements and
initial testimony Saturday in a trial that will last at least
through Monday, Krogmann said.
   Torchia, 32, of Princeton, Ill., was in charge of the school at
Pensacola Naval Air Station on March 2 when Airman Recruit Lee
Mirecki, 19, of Appleton, Wis., died after he panicked, climbed out
of a swimming pool and shouted that he wanted to quit.
   Instructors allegedly pushed Mirecki back into the water and
held his head under until he collapsed and died from a fear-induced
heart attack or drowning.
   Torchia, who was talking on the telephone in his office
overlooking the pool at the time, is accused of failing to
safeguard the physical well-being of Mirecki and other
subordinates. The prosecution contends he should have prevented the
use of unsafe and unlawful force and had failed to establish
policies banning the use of force and recognizing the right of
students to drop out.
   In arguments on the admissibility of certain evidence, Lt.
Thomas C. Leighton, one of Torchia's lawyers, argued that using
force on students was crucial to proper training.
   Since Mirecki's death, instructors have been prohibited from
touching students.
   Torchia is one of two Navy men being court-martialed in the
case. If convicted, he could face a letter of reprimand, loss of
seniority for promotion and forfeiture of two-thirds of his pay for
three months, said Lt. Cmdr. Dennis Hessler, a public affairs
officer.
   Petty Officer 2nd Class Michael W. Combe, 26, a instructor from
Tempe, Ariz., is to be tried on charges of involuntary
manslaughter, battery and conspiracy to commit battery. His trial
was scheduled to begin Monday but will be delayed until Torchia's
case is concluded.
   Torchia's former boss, now-retired Capt. C.L. Lavinder Jr.,
commander of the Navy Schools Command in Pensacola at the time of
the death, received a letter of reprimand for dereliction of duty.
   Four other enlisted instructors were given non-judicial
punishment of fines and in two cases reductions in rank. Four
supervisory personnel, one an officer and three of enlisted men,
were given non-punitive letters of caution.

   President Reagan continues to suffer from
mild hearing loss in his left ear and moderate hearing loss in his
right ear, his physicians reported Friday.
   ``There has been no change in the president's hearing deficit in
the past ten years,'' White House physician Dr. Larry Mohr said in
a statement issued following Reagan's annual hearing examination.
The exam was conducted at the president's penthouse suite in the
Century Plaza Hotel.
   The statement said Reagan's two hearing aids also were checked
and ``are working perfectly.'' The president wears hearing aids in
both ears and he ``continues to have the same mild hearing loss in
the left ear and moderate hearing loss in the right ear that he has
had on previous examinations,'' the statement said.
   The president was examined by three physicians, including his
longtime ear, nose and throat specialist, Dr. John House. Reagan
started to use a new type of hearing aid last year and he has had
no complaints. He can adjust the volume by using a credit card-size
control.
   Earlier Friday, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said the
president's allergist had determined there has been no essential
change in his sensitivity to pollen.
   Reagan, who receives weekly shots to control the allergy, has
been undergoing a battery of annual checkups in the midst of his
traditional August vacation.
   The president was examined Thursday by his longtime allergist
Dr. Ralph Bookman, and the checkup ``was routine,'' the spokesman
said.
   Reagan is spending a week of his August vacation here with his
wife, Nancy.
   Outside of appearing at campaign rallies for Vice President
George Bush and Sen. Pete Wilson, R-Calif., the president has left
his suite only for private dinners with old friends in the evenings.
   The Reagans are scheduled to return to their ranch near Santa
Barbara on Saturday after attending fund-raising events for the
California Republican Party and for Rep. Robert Lagomarsino,
R-Calif.
   Fitzwater said the party event, in Thousand Oaks, Calif., will
be attended by 350 to 400 people who either contributed or gathered
$5,000 per person for GOP campaign coffers.
   About 1,000 people, contributing $200 apiece, were to attend the
fund-raiser for Lagomarsino near Santa Barbara, Fitzwater said.
   The Reagans have no public events scheduled next week and are to
remain at the ranch until after Labor Day, he said.

   A U.S. anthropologist and two
Amazon Indian chiefs were arraigned Friday on charges of engaging
in illegal political activities and could be expelled from Brazil.
   Darrell Posey, 41, of Henderson, Ky., and chiefs Paulo Paiakan
and Kube-I of the Kayapo tribe were accused of breaking Brazil's
Foreigners Law during a trip to the United States this year.
   The law, passed in 1980 when Brazil was under a military
government, prohibits non-Brazilian residents or visitors from
speaking out publicly on domestic political issues.
   The trial has caused a sensation here. It is first time native
Indians have been legally considered foreigners.
   Posey's lawyer, well-known human rights defender Jose Carlos
Castro, said Friday the trial was suspended ``at least until
December'' because Kube-I had returned to his village for the
harvest and festival period and refused to show up at court.
   The court gave Kube-I 90 days to present himself for arraignment.
   ``This is a landmark case. I've been studying native peoples for
24 years, and this is the first time a native group has been
considered foreign by a white government,'' Posey said by telephone
from his office in Belem, a city at the mouth of the Amazon River
2,140 miles northwest of Rio de Janeiro.
   He said the two Kayapo chiefs were invited by Florida
International University in Miami to speak about forest
conservation. Posey, who has lived and worked in Brazil since 1977,
said he went along as a friend and interpreter.
   ``They (the two Indians) said they were worried about
deforestation in the Amazon, erosion, mercury pollution from gold
mining, and hydroelectric projects that displace Indian tribes.
They're especially upset at the Xingu project that will inundate
about ... (18.8 million acres) of land, mostly Indian territory,''
Posey said.
   The Kayapos number about 5,500 and live in the southern Amazon
jungle.
   Environmental groups later invited Paiakan and Kube-I to speak
to the World Bank in Washington. The bank suspended funding for the
Xingu project.
   Many Brazilians believe the Indians were responsible for
blocking the project, but Posey said funding already had been
suspended because of financing problems with the government power
company Eletronorte.
   The trial began Friday in Belem at the 3rd Federal Court of
Para, a northern Amazon jungle state. If found guilty, the three
face a prison term of up to three years each and expulsion from
Brazil.
   It was not clear where the Indians could be expelled to.
   ``That's a very interesting question. But it's the government's
problem,'' Posey said.
   Legally, Indians are wards of the state and don't have the full
rights of other citizens.
   Posey said he felt the trial was an attempt by the government to
intimidate scientists and native Indians and keep them from
speaking out on politically sensitive issues.
   ``No matter what the outcome of the trial is, the effects will
be very unpleasant. I am prohibited from working in any Indian area
as long as the case is pending. My work is paralyzed,'' he said.
   The Foreigners Law was enacted and often used by the military
governments that ruled Brazil from 1964 to 1985. Foreign priests
and students who spoke out about political affairs were charged and
sometimes expelled from the country.
   However, this is the first time the law has been used since
Brazil returned to civilian rule in 1985 under President Jose
Sarney.
   Posey said he wasn't afraid of being expelled.
   ``If I'm found guilty ... I wouldn't want to stay here any
more.''

   The FBI said Friday it is investigating
apparent sabotage of O-rings destined for space shuttle booster
rockets, a problem a NASA official said may have been motivated by
a company incentive program.
   The defects were detected before any damaged rings were sent to
the rocket maker.
   A ``very small number'' of O-rings that appeared to have been
deliberately cut were discovered in June by the manufacturer,
HydraPak Inc., and the incident was immediately reported to the
FBI, NASA, and rocket maker Morton Thiokol, said James Dockstader,
HydraPak vice president of operations.
   He said a check showed none of the flawed seals was shipped to
Morton Thiokol.
   ``These things are inspected more times than you can hardly
believe. But it's a serious nature. This O-ring has a great deal of
visibility in the space program and around the world, and we can
understand that. They are handled very carefully,'' Dockstader said.
   However, television station KTVX quoted a former Morton Thiokol
employee Friday night as saying one deliberately cut O-ring was
placed in a rocket segment under assembly at Morton Thiokol.
   ``I was there when they received the damaged O-ring, and it was
labeled from HydraPak, and it was in a package that had gone
through quality assurance at Morton Thiokol,'' said the unnamed
worker.
   The man said when he called attention to the flawed seal he was
told to keep quiet because the exposure could cause further delays
in the space shuttle program.
   Morton Thiokol spokesman Rocky Raab denied the allegations,
saying, ``No unacceptable component has either been delivered to us
or been delivered by us for use in the shuttle program.''
   The company conducts extensive ``acceptance inspections'' of any
parts intended for flight hardware, and records of those
inspections show there was ``virtually no possibility that any
damaged O-ring has ever gotten into the flight hardware,'' Raab
said.
   A faulty O-ring that allowed super-hot exhaust gases to escape
sideways through a joint and ignite the shuttle's exterior fuel
tank was blamed by a presidential commission for the Jan. 28, 1986,
Challenger explosion, which killed the craft's seven-member crew
and grounded the nation's shuttle program.
   J.R. Thompson, director of NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center
in Huntsville, Ala., said some HydraPak employees are suspected of
damaging O-rings to receive bonuses awarded to workers who found
defects.
   ``My understanding is they tightened internal final inspection,
incentivized it or came up with some kind of program to make sure
(no flawed O-rings) got out,'' Thompson told The Huntsville Times
on Friday.
   ``After HydraPak set up this internal thing, perhaps some
employees may have been taking advantage of it. That's what's
suspected. Whether it's a fact, I don't know. We're treating it as
an internal HydraPak thing,'' he said.
   Under the incentive plan, workers reportedly were awarded points
for finding defects missed in previous inspections. When they
accumulated enough points, they received a cash bonus. However, the
system was eliminated since the defects appeared, The Times
reported.
   Dockstader denied, however, that HydraPak employees were given a
cash incentive and said Thompson was ``either misinformed or
misquoted.''
   ``Employees do not benefit monetarily from finding a defect,''
he told The Associated Press. Asked if the company had a
point-system incentive plan, Dockstader said he could not comment.
   He did confirm a Times report that, in addition to the O-rings
that were deliberately cut, several others were left in a curing
oven believed to have been left deliberately on a
hotter-than-normal setting.
   Former HydraPak inspector Cathy Crocker told KSL-TV Friday that
she discovered three O-rings with slash marks as early as May, but
management was unable to determine who was responsible.
   After more cuts were found, Crocker said she was asked to take a
lie-detector test.
   ``I did. I had nothing to hide. I liked my job at that company.
I took the test and I failed it. They came in and took me off my
inspection,'' she said.
   Crocker said that when cuts continued to surface in some
O-rings, she was moved to a filing job and was asked by management
to resign.
   Dockstader said no employees were fired as a result of the
investigations, but he would not say if any were disciplined.
   Dockstader said security at the suburban Salt Lake plant was
strict, including employee badges for admission and escorts for
visitors. But Crocker claimed security was lax and that anyone
could walk into the plant.
   HydraPak, with offices solely in Utah, also produces various
industrial seals and hydraulic components and employs about 85
people.
   FBI agent Cal Clegg said his agency was investigating the
possibility of sabotage, but he declined to elaborate.
   NASA Inspector General Bill Colvin likewise refused to discuss
the space agency's investigation. But he said National Aeronautics
and Space Administration officials believe none of the damaged
O-rings ever made it to Morton Thiokol and that their discovery
would not affect shuttle launch plans.
   Morton Thiokol decided not to conduct an investigation because
the company never received any damaged O-rings, said spokesman
Rocky Raab.
   ``It's always upsetting to hear that someone may, for whatever
reason, be deliberately damaging stuff that's intended for the
space program. But we are satisfied that the steps taken by
HydraPak to resolve the situation are, in fact, adequate,'' Raab
said.
   Dockstader would not comment on HydraPak's efforts to resolve
the matter except to say the company had taken steps to prevent
similar incidents in the future and ``the problem is now solved.''
   The damaged rings were discovered by a HydraPak inspector, he
said. Had the rings passed the company's inspection, however, they
still would have been examined by resident inspectors from Morton
Thiokol and the federal Defense Contract Administration Service.
   On Aug. 18, Morton Thiokol culminated a 2{-year effort to
overhaul the booster with an apparently successful test-firing of
the redesigned rocket at the company's Wasatch Operations plant 70
miles northwest of Salt Lake City.
   The firing was the fifth and final qualifying test before the
booster can be cleared for flight.
   NASA is expected next week to set a date for the launch of
Discovery, the first post-Challenger mission.
   At the launch pad at Kennedy Space Center, engineers continued
to troubleshoot two problems that cropped up during a test firing
of Discovery's engines on Aug. 10.
   One involves a small leak of hydrogen in an area where fuel
lines extend into the shuttle from the external fuel tank. The
other is the sluggish behavior of three valves that control the
flow of liquid oxygen into the orbiter.

   Two Zimbabwe air force officers died
when their twin-engine plane crashed during a training flight, the
Defense Ministry said Friday.
   A ministry spokesman, who by custom was not identified, said the
plane crashed Thursday at Thornhill air base near Gweru, 172 miles
southwest of Harare.
   The air force officers were identified as flying instructor
Tawanda Hove and junior pilot Joseph Nyandoro. They were engaged in
landing maneuvers in a twin-engine Cessna training aircraft.
   The Defense Ministry ordered an investigation into the crash,
the spokesman said.

   Republican vice presidential candidate Dan
Quayle's official resume says he was the Indiana Consumer
Protection Division's chief investigator a year before the unit was
created, state records show.
   The law creating the unit passed April 14, 1971, and took effect
July 1. Officials said Quayle served as chief investigator from
July until mid-September, when he became administrative assistant
to then-Gov. Edgar D. Whitcomb.
   Quayle's Senate biography, which his campaign is using as his
official background, says he was chief investigator of the unit in
the Attorney General's office from 1970 to 1971.
   ``He was assigned to our section in the spring of 1971,'' said
Robert Smith, the unit's first director and now an attorney in
Indianapolis.
   ``He was in fact the chief investigator. He helped get the unit
set up. (But) it would not have been before 1971,'' Smith said
Friday in a telephone interview. ``We formally began operations
July 1.''
   Quayle conceded Friday that the resume entry was ``inaccurate''
and said his staff had written the document.
   ``If it indicated that, that is inaccurate. I didn't hold that
job for two years,'' Quayle told reporters aboard his campaign
plane.
   Earlier, however, Quayle spokesman David Prosperi called the
revelation of the error by The Plain Dealer of Cleveland ``a cheap
shot.''
   Quayle was hired as an entry-level research assistant by the
state Attorney General's office in 1970 after he returned from six
months of basic and advanced training for the Indiana National
Guard.
   Quayle, a 1969 graduate of DePauw University, was attending
Indiana University Law School at the time.
   M. Stanton Evans, then an editor with the Indianapolis News,
helped arrange his job interview with the state. Evans worked for
Eugene C. Pulliam, Quayle's grandfather and publisher of the News.
   ``At no point in any of this did Dan Quayle ask any favors or
use any influence,'' said Evans, now with the National Journalism
Center in Washington, D.C.
   ``He wouldn't have been hired as a chief investigator. He was
hired in an entry-level job and was promoted to a whole bunch of
jobs on his merits. It's a nothing story,'' Evans said.
   Theodore Sendak, the Attorney General at the time, recently had
surgery and is unable to comment, according to his son, Timothy
Sendak.
   Patricia Gifford, a Marion Superior Court judge who was then an
assistant attorney general, said Friday that prior to the
establishment of the Consumer Protection Division, ``all complaints
and inquiries were handled by me. The legal assistant assigned to
me and utilized as my chief investigator was Dan Quayle.'' Her
statement was released by the Quayle campaign.
   The Consumer Protection Division was created by the state
legislature to resolve complaints over defective products, false
claims in ads, faulty speedometer readings and mail-order fraud.
   In 1980, Quayle referred to himself as a ``Vietnam-era veteran''
in campaign literature when he was running against three-term
incumbent Birch Bayh in a Senate race.
   Quayle, who enlisted in the Indiana National Guard, dropped the
reference after objections by some Vietnam combat veterans.
   In that same election, which he won, Quayle said he was ``on
active duty for several periods during his tenure'' in the Guard.
The statement referred to periods when Quayle was in basic training
and 15 days of camp each summer.

<HEAD>Security Council Calls for End of Palestinian Deportations</HEAD>
<DATELINE>UNITED NATIONS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.N. Security Council on Friday asked
Israel to stop deporting Palestinians and expressed concern over
growing violence in the Israeli-occupied territories.
   After private consultations, Council President Li Luye of China
read a statement saying, ``The members request Israel immediately
to desist from deporting any Palestinian civilians and immediately
to ensure the safe return of those already deported.''
   Since the start of the Palestinian uprising last Dec. 8, Israel
has deported 33 Palestinians and ordered another 25 expelled from
the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip. The Israelis say those
covered by the orders helped foment the unrest, which has killed
254 Arabs and four Israelis.
   The U.N. statement said the deportations violate Security
Council resolutions and Geneva accords.
   It also said Security Council members are worried that the
violence ``has grave consequences for endeavors to achieve a
comprehensive, just and lasting peace in the Middle East.''
   The United States also has criticized Israel's deportation
policy.

   Israeli troops shot and wounded a 9-year-old
Palestinian girl Friday when she violated a curfew by running out
of her West Bank home, an Arab hospital official said.
   In the Gaza Strip, a mob of Palestinians attacked a fellow Arab
alleged to have cooperated with Israeli authorities, and news
reports said another alleged collaborator opened fire a day earlier
on a Palestinian mob that was blocking his way in the West Bank,
wounding a teen-ager.
   The incidents were the latest in a series of Palestinian attacks
on suspected collaborators, including three in the past week.
   Also Friday, 14-year-old Aymen Yammen died from a gunshot wound
to the eye that he suffered during clashes last week in the West
Bank village of Tal, officials at Jerusalem's Mukassed Hospital
said.
   The fatality raised the Palestinian death toll in the
8-month-old Arab uprising to 254. Four Israelis have also died.
   In Arab east Jerusalem, the army closed a trade union for a
year, alleging its members held meetings to initiate anti-Israeli
protests, an army spokesman said. It was the 10th union to be
closed since the Arab uprising began Dec. 8.
   Israel's right-wing Trade Minister Ariel Sharon accused
Palestinian trade unions of acting as ``cover-ups for terror
organizations.''
   ``They are not an innocent workers' union but front
organizations behind which the PLO's political arm has been hiding
for years,'' Sharon told Israel radio.
   Sharon also denounced an upcoming U.S. review of Israel's trade
privileges because of alleged abuses of Palestinian workers' rights.
   The American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee, a
pro-Palestinian lobby in Washington, has accused Israel of closing
down union offices indiscriminately, arresting Arab labor activists
and denying trade union protection to more than 100,000 Arabs in
the territories who travel to jobs in Israel.
   U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter said Thursday he would
review Israel's duty-free trade status following the complaint,
which was filed in June.
   A country found to have abused worker rights risks losing its
privilege to export products to the United States free of duties
under the Generalized System of Preferences. In 1987, Israel
exported $487 million in goods under the program.
   Responding to Yeutter's statement, Sharon said: ``We shall
explain to our American friends that when it comes to the lives of
Jews, Israel will not be pressured by economic sanctions.''
   An Arab hospital official said nine-year-old Marah Nadadeli was
shot in the left leg when she ran out of her house in Nablus, the
largest West Bank city.
   The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the girl
thought she heard the army announce on loudspeakers that a curfew
was over. The announcement actually said the curfew was continuing.
   The 120,000 residents of Nablus have been confined to their
homes since Thursday.
   A 23-year-old Nablus man was also shot in the left leg by
soldiers, a hospital official said, adding that he did not know the
circumstances.
   In the occupied Gaza Strip, residents of the Jabaliya refugee
camp attacked a Palestinian fireman who worked for the military
administration and his family defended him with knives and chains,
the army said.
   It said two of the Arab attackers were treated for slight
injuries and arrested.
   In Ramallah Thursday, a Palestinian also suspected of
collaborating with Israel opened fire on Arab youths who refused to
let him through a barricade, Israel radio and Arab news reports
said.
   The man was believed to be a collaborator because only Arabs who
work with the authorities are granted permission to carry a weapon,
the news reports said.
   Iyad Hassan Mahmoud Nabali, 14, who was shot in the shoulder,
told The Associated Press from his hospital bed that the man ``got
out of his car, pulled a pistol and shot me.''
   The clashes followed three attacks on suspected collaborators
over the past three days. In the worst incident, masked men broke
into the home of Saadi Hazaza in the West Bank village of Yatta
Wednesday and hacked him to death with axes.
   In another development, the Nazareth-based Arab weekly A-Sinara
said the Palestine Liberation Organization was considering forming
a provisional government next month composed of Palestinian
academics from the occupied territories, Europe and the United
States.
   The newspaper said formation of the government-in-exile would be
announced either at next month's U.N. General Assembly session in
New York or when PLO chief Yasser Arafat addresses the European
Parliament Sept. 13.
   In New York, the U.N. Security Council on Friday asked Israel to
stop deporting Palestinians and said it was was worried by growing
violence in the occupied territories.
   Since the start of the Palestinian uprising, Israel has deported
33 Palestinians and ordered another 25 expelled from the occupied
lands. The Israelis say those deported helped foment the unrest.

   A federal jury Friday acquitted 20 reputed
mob figures of racketeering charges, ending what is believed to be
the nation's longest federal criminal trial and handing the
government a stunning defeat.
   The jury, which had been selected 21 months ago, read 77
separate innocent verdicts before the courtroom erupted in
pandemonium. The defendants and their attorneys hugged and gave a
standing ovation to the jury, which had deliberated just 14 hours.
The jury forewoman wept.
   ``What's there to say,'' Assistant U.S. Attorney V. Grady
O'Malley said. ``Apparently the jury just resented the length (of
the trial) and the breadth of the indictment.''
   The government had charged that Anthony ``Tumac'' Accetturo of
Hollywood, Fla., and his co-defendants controlled a powerful New
Jersey faction of the Lucchese organized crime family that had
illegal gambling, loan-sharking, drug-dealing and fraudulent credit
card operations.
   The defense tried to discredit government witnesses, many of
whom had serious criminal records. The government contended that
only such insiders could tell the story of the organized crime
family.
   Defense attorney David Ruhnke said the verdict was a ``complete
rejection'' of long government racketeering prosecutions against
numerous defendants.
   ``We think this is certainly the last prosecution that can be
brought like this,'' added defense attorney Miles Feinstein.
   ``My client is enormously thrilled by the result,'' said
Accetturo's attorney, Stephen Skoller.
   ``I'm just glad it was everybody (acquitted),'' said Michael
Taccetta, a Florham Park resident charged with supervising the
organization in New Jersey.
   The defendants and their lawyers waited outside the courthouse
to applaud the jurors as they emerged before going to a restaurant
to celebrate. Some of the jurors blew kisses, waved and smiled
broadly.
   ``They should never, ever do anything like this to anybody
again,'' said juror Dorothy Bannigan. ``It's really unfair, not
only to defendants but to jurors.''
   The jurors went through each charge against each defendant and
reached a conclusion so quickly because they had a ``good system.''
   Another juror, hospital maintenance worker Gerald Caesar Jr.,
reached at his home in East Orange, said, ``I just want to enjoy my
family and get back to my lifestyle.
   ``I don't want to be bothered. Don't call me any more,'' he
added, before hanging up the phone.
   Before they were dismissed, U.S. District Judge Harold A.
Ackerman thanked the jury, saying, ``I commend you in the highest
terms for your dedication, your patience, your attentiveness.''
   ``I'm just glad it's over,'' the judge said later, adding he
planned to go on vacation as soon as possible.
   The panel began deliberating Thursday morning with a record to
consider that included 40,000 pages of transcripts, testimony from
89 witnesses and 850 exhibits, including 400 tapes.
   The government's star witness was Joseph Alonzo, a diagnosed
schizophrenic, admitted drug addict and alcoholic and convicted
criminal who had shot one of the defendants _ his cousin _ five
times.
   Defense attorney Robert L. Brown, elected mayor of Orange during
the trial, criticized the government for calling ``liars, thieves,
crooks and criminals'' as witnesses.
   ``American jurors realize that's not enough under our
Constitution,'' he said.
   Michael Critchley, who represented Taccetta, called the verdict
a ``collective victory.''
   ``The odds in this one were against 1,000 to 1,'' he said.
   The government had alleged the defendants, charged in an
indictment unsealed in March 1986, operated out of the
Hole-in-the-Wall luncheonette in Newark, where pictures of
gangsters Al Capone and Meyer Lansky hang on the wall. Witnesses
testified about kisses of respect for the boss, ``tribute''
payments and mob ``sit-downs.''
   U.S. Attorney Samuel A. Alito Jr., who came to office after the
indictment was unsealed in August 1985, said he had no regrets
about the prosecution but in the future would try to keep cases
``as short and simple as possible.''
   ``Despite this loss, the days of the Mafia are numbered,'' said
Alito.
   According to the Administrative Office of the Courts in
Washington, the trial surpassed in length the ``Pizza Connection''
heroin smuggling case, which ended after 17 months in March 1987.

   Many in this blue-collar town remember
Clyde Lee Conrad only distantly, a 1960s classmate who was shy,
with a sly smile, and in recent years was generous with his family.
   Now authorities in West Germany say the former Army sergeant may
have headed an international spy ring that sold NATO defense
secrets to the Soviets at high prices for 10 years.
   Conrad, 41, enlisted in the Army on Aug. 9, 1965, soon after he
graduated from Sebring McKinley High School. Acquaintances said he
seldom returned to his hometown of 5,000 people, about 55 miles
southeast of Cleveland, although he came back in 1985 for a 20-year
class reunion.
   ``He had flown home from Germany. It was in August, and he told
us that in a month or two he would retire,'' said Joseph E. Igro,
who was on the school's track team with him. ``It was about 20
years since anyone had seen him, since he joined the service right
out of high school. There was just small talk, about old days in
school, not about what he was doing now.''
   The Conrad family lived in two houses on McKinley Avenue,
neighbors say. The first house, where Clyde grew up, caught fire a
short time after the family moved across the street.
   ``Clyde sent cash _ money _ to his mother to buy a house about
five years ago,'' said Tammy Andrews, 22, a neighbor before the
Conrads moved from here several years ago. ``What we heard was that
every time he would move (in Germany), he would buy a new house.''
   The Conrads still own their former home on the street, and a
tenant is trying to buy it, neighbors said. Neighbors said they
were not sure where the Conrads now live, although his father and a
sister lives in Alliance, about six miles west of here.
   Conrad's father, Harry, said Friday he had not seen his son in
nine years. Other relatives were not immediately available for
comment. His sister, Caron Henschen, told The Alliance Review that
family members have not spoken with Conrad since his arrest.
   Conrad was arrested Tuesday and was being held in a West German
prison pending further investigation. He was charged with
``compelling suspicion of espionage activities in an especially
grave case,'' according to the prosecutor's office. West German
authorities have said millions of dollars may have been involved.
   At the Tin Lantern restaurant in downtown Sebring, owner Dennis
Rohde made light of the allegations.
   ``You want our spy sandwich?'' Rohde asked patrons. ``It comes
with a secret decoder ring.''
   But Rohde admitted the news seemed to have taken residents aback.
   ``They're just shocked. Nobody expected it,'' said Rohde, 50.
``They live in this town for years, and they suddenly have a spy
scandal and they say, `My God, how could it be someone from here?'
''
   One McKinley Street resident, who would give her name only as
Mrs. Robert Blake, said she remembered Clyde Conrad as a youngster
but learned little about him or his family despite living on the
same street for more than 30 years.
   ``We'd talk every now and then, just occasionally,'' Mrs. Blake
said of the family. ``But people around here pretty much mind their
own business. I knew them, but their business was their business
and I didn't get into it.''
   ``The family was real well-liked,'' said Susan Reed, 33, who
lived three houses from the Conrads. ``I didn't know Clyde, the one
that was in Germany, but I ran with his sister.
   ``They just minded their own business and never got into no
arguments or nothing.''
   Bill Gill, 65, said he used to go to the racetrack with Clyde
Conrad's father, Darrell.
   ``We used to go to the track quite often,'' Gill said. ``We'd
bet a couple of dollars on each race, a little here, a little
there. Sometimes we'd win _ most of the time, we'd win _ but
sometimes we'd lose.''
   Of the allegations against Clyde, Gill said: ``I don't believe
he done it. I don't know for sure, but I knew his daddy, and I just
don't believe it.''

<HEAD>Jury Deliberating Copper-7 Case</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A jury began deliberating Friday whether
the Copper-7 intrauterine device caused sterility in a Minnesota
woman.
   Esther Kociemba, 30, and her husband, William, of Elk River, are
seeking at least $16.5 million from G.D. Searle & Co., manufacturer
of the birth-control device. The damages sought are more than any
jury has awarded in 18 similar cases.
   The jury, which has heard three months of testimony, began
deliberations Friday morning and was sent home about 5 p.m. Jurors
were instructed to return Monday.
   Michael Ciresi, the Kociembas' attorney, argued during trial
that the Copper-7 caused pelvic inflammatory disease and rendered
Mrs. Kociemba sterile. He said the Chicago-based Searle was
negligent in designing the device with a tailstring that he said
provided a haven for bacteria.
   The Copper-7 was rushed to market without proper testing and
sold to women without adequate warning that it could cause public
inflammatory disease, and without warning that it was too large for
women who had never given birth, Ciresi said.
   Searle's attorney, Paul Strain of Baltimore, said the company
exceeded U.S. Food and Drug Administration requirements in
marketing Copper-7, which was once the most widely used IUD in
America. He attacked the credibility of witnesses called by Ciresi
and said Ciresi did not even prove that Mrs. Kociemba suffered from
pelvic infection, let alone that it was caused by the Copper-7.
   Ciresi asked the jury for $15 million in punitive damages, $1.5
million to $2 million in compensatory damages for Mrs. Kociemba and
$300,000 in compensatory damages for her husband.
   The FDA approved the Copper-7 in 1974, and Searle sold between
300,000 and 400,000 of the IUDs in the United States before
withdrawing the product in the wake of numerous lawsuits.
   Ciresi's Minneapolis law firm represents more than 150 of the
500 Copper-7 users who have sued Searle and Mrs. Kociemba's case is
the first it has tried.

   Strikes and violence spread in Burma and
BBC Television quoted reliable sources as saying that up to 1,000
inmates were killed when guards opened fire at Insein Jail outside
Rangoon on Friday.
   State-run Rangoon radio reported earlier that 2,000 inmates
rebelled at Insein jail on Thursday, setting buildings ablaze. It
said guards opened fire and ``some inmates and prison guards were
injured.''
   There was no immediate explanation for the discrepancy between
the Thursday date given by Rangoon radio and the Friday time given
by the British Broadcasting Corp. TV broadcast Friday night.
   Huge anti-government rallies continued in Burma Friday, and
retired ranking military officers joined those demanding immediate
democracy in the Asian nation.
   The BBC broadcast, monitored in London, said:
   ``Anti-government demonstrations are reported to have begun .. .
(at Insein Jail) early in the day when prisoners had left their
cells for breakfast. Several who tried to give speeches are said to
have been shot dead and in the chaos that followed fires were
started.
   ``As inmates fled to escape the flames, it is reported that
security guards opened fire. According to reliable sources, about
1,000 people were killed. Rangoon radio in its account said guards
fired on prisoners as they tried to open the gates to escape from
the burning building, but it speaks only of several people being
wounded.''
   The report was by BBC correspondent Christopher Gunness, who had
been in Rangoon and filed it from Dhaka, Bangladesh. The BBC told
The Associated Press it was not sure when Gunness left Rangoon.
   Gen. Tin Oo, a former defense minister, said earlier in a letter
to President Maung Maung that ``thousands of lives have been lost''
since the coup that began authoritarian military rule 26 years ago
``and the country is in the grip of a general strike paralyzing the
whole administration.''
   ``It is now long overdue to abolish one-party (government) in
favor of a multiparty system,'' he wrote. ``It is imperative to
immediately transfer power to an interim government ... composed of
people acceptable to the country.''
   A copy of the letter, dated Friday, was seen by the AP.
   Another letter urged Maung Maung, the first civilian president
since the coup, to form an interim government and release political
prisoners. It was dated Tuesday and signed by a retired brigadier
and 14 colonels.
   Rangoon radio reported two other prison riots besides that at
Insein:
   _Prisoners set fires at Bassein, 90 miles west of Rangoon, on
Wednesday, guards shot one inmate dead and about 100 prisoners
escaped.
   _At Akyab jail in Arrakan state bordering Bangladesh,
``prisoners and people outside of the prison shouted slogans,
demonstrated and started to riot'' Thursday night. Six inmates were
killed, 24 were wounded and about 1,600 escaped.
   According to the radio, all the prisoners were convicted of
crimes unrelated to the anti-government protest. It said all the
2,750 people arrested this month during demonstrations in Rangoon
had been released, except for those accused of serious crimes.
   The radio said protesters commandeered 27 buses Friday in
Rangoon, stole gasoline under threat of violence and drove the
buses around the city.
   An earlier broadcast said ``some violent incidents, looting and
destructive acts have been reported in several townships since
martial law was revoked in the Rangoon city development areas''
Wednesday, and ``hooligans'' set shanties afire in some parts of
the capital. No details were given.
   Officials said strikes halted trains and domestic flights of
Union Burma Airways on Friday; closed oil refineries at Syriam,
across the Rangoon River, and at Mann in central Burma; crippled
most factories of the Industries Ministry, and stranded foreign
ships in Rangoon port.
   Most government offices in Rangoon were empty. Friday was the
second day without newspapers because workers at the six state-run
dailies stayed home.
   People are hoarding necessities and the price of rice has soared.
   The largest and most widespread protests since the military
takeover of 1962 have had the government on the defensive for a
month. At least 112 people have been killed in Rangoon alone, by
official count, and unofficial reports put the toll much higher.
   Turmoil began when 77-year-old Ne Win, who led the coup and
imposed rigid socialist rule, resigned late in July and the ruling
Burma Socialist Program Party chose Sein Lwin to succeed him.
   Demonstrations began almost immediately against Sein Lwin, who
was blamed for the ruthless crushing of dissent, and turned bloody
Aug. 8 when security forces began shooting into crowds. Sein Lwin
resigned after 17 days and Maung Maung, the attorney general and
one of two civilians in the Cabinet, replaced him Aug. 19.
   Student-led rallies continued and protesters demanded full
democracy.
   Even Maung Maung's recommendation Wednesday that a special party
congress be held Sept. 12 to consider a referendum on one-party
rule did not end mass actions in the streets.
   Rallies have been peaceful since Sein Lwin quit, but the
situation has deteriorated since Maung Maung lifted martial law
Wednesday and security personnel virtually disappeared from the
streets.
   Police and government workers in Taunggyi joined 100,000
demonstrators Friday in demanding an interim government. Witnesses
said it was the largest rally ever in the Shan state capital, 290
miles northeast of the capital.
   In Rangoon, Aung Gyi Suu Kyi, daughter of late independence
leader Aung San, told 400,000 cheering people only immediate
democracy could end the unrest. She asked the military to be ``the
people's army'' and look after their interests.

   A tremor shook northern Chile Friday, but
no damage or injuries were reported, authorities said.
   The Seismological Intitute of the University of Chile said the
tremor measured three on Mercalli scale and was centered 190 miles
north of Santiago, near the coastal city of La Serena.
   Police reported no damage or injuries.
   The Mercalli scale gauges the intensity of an earthquake as felt
in a specific location. The scale runs from 1 to 12: a 1 reading is
not felt except by very few, favorably situated. A 12 reading is
total damage.

<TEXT>
   Premier Karoly Grosz will meet Romanian
President Nicolae Ceausescu on Sunday, apparently to discuss a plan
to raze villages in Romania, official media said Friday.
   The terse report over Hungarian radio did not contain details,
but it was clear that Ceausescu's plan to destroy 7,000 of
Romania's 13,000 villages will be the main topic of their
discussions in Arad, Romania.
   Hungarians have complained that the move will wipe out hundreds
of ethnic Hungarian communities.
   The two leaders will hold ``a working meeting ... on the basis
of a mutual agreement,'' the report said.
   Hungarian Communist Party spokesman Laszlo Major said the
Romanian president proposed the meeting through diplomatic channels
on Thursday. Arad is about 25 miles from the Hungarian border. The
proposal was accepted in a hurriedly convened special session of
the Hungarian party's Politburo Friday, Major said.
   The visit appears to have been arranged following a Hungarian
initiative to defuse a deepening crisis between the Warsaw Pact
allies over the plan to raze the villages and resettle the tens of
thousands of residents.
   Hungary has long accused the Romanian government of
discrimination against the 1.7 million ethnic Hungarians who live
in Romania, most of them in Transylvania.
   Last weekend, Politburo member Imre Pozsgay denounced the
resettlement plan as ``a crime against mankind.''
   The meeting will be the first encounter between the two
countries' leaders in 11 years.
   In retaliation for an anti-Romanian demonstration in Budapest of
about 50,000 people in June, Ceausescu ordered the closure of a
Hungarian consulate in Cluj-Napoca and of a Hungarian culture
institute in Budapest that never started operation.
   Romanian refugees and independent Hungarian groups Monday night
started a two-week demonstration against the plan opposite the
Romanian Embassy in Budapest.

   Former Black Panther leader Huey
Newton, who had refused parole from prison until a fellow inmate
and ex-Panther also was released, decided to leave after all,
prison officials said Friday.
   Newton, in San Quentin for two months for parole violations,
refused to leave on his scheduled release date Tuesday, demanding
that convicted murderer Elmer ``Geronimo'' Pratt also be freed.
   Newton apparently changed his mind about staying behind bars
when prison officials served him with extra conditions of parole,
including a clause that should he again decline to leave, it would
be considered a parole violation, said prison spokeswoman Jeanne
Ballatore.
   Newton's refusal to leave so far has merely been a violation of
prison rules, she said. The new clause would make it a parole
violation, a much more serious offense.
   Newton was processed Friday, she said.
   Pratt is serving a life term for the 1968 slaying of a Santa
Monica woman during a $30 robbery. He entered prison in 1972 and
lost his eighth bid parole two weeks ago for parole when a state
panel called him a ``danger to the public.''
   Pratt's supporters contend he was framed, that he's a political
prisoner and the victim of police efforts to jail Panther leaders
and dismantle the Oakland-based Black Liberation Movement of the
late 1960s and early '70s.
   Newton, 45, co-founder of the defunct Black Panthers and its
defense minister, has had two decades of scuffles with the law.

   A decree made public Friday gives broad powers to
paramilitary police accused by political activists of unprecedented
brutality in breaking up demonstrations.
   The decree says the special police, attached to the Interior
Ministry, will be responsible for keeping public order at
demonstrations, which have become more frequent under Soviet leader
Mikhail S. Gorbachev's policy of glasnost, or greater openness.
   It gives them the power to enter homes and businesses in pursuit
of suspects, seize autos and communications equipment and use a
wide range of weapons.
   Crowd control previously was the responsibility of regular
police, who also are governed by the Interior Ministry. The
paramilitary police until now had been assigned only to guarding
prisons and labor camps, and protecting government property and
special shipments.
   The Presidium of the Supreme Soviet approved the decree July 28,
and it was published in a legislative digest that reached
subscribers Friday.
   Soviet media have not reported the measure, signed by President
Andrei Gromyko, but carried extensive dispatches on a decree of the
same day that requires advance permission for public demonstrations
and meetings and sets stiff fines and jail terms for violators.
   Political activists say the paramilitary police turned up at a
demonstration Sunday in Moscow and during this year's unrest in
Armenia.
   ``In peacetime, the army is taking on extraordinary powers,''
said Yuri Mityunov, a leader of an unofficial opposition political
group called the Democratic Union. ``What is happening here is what
happens in other countries only under martial law.''
   Mityunov said the new measure gives paramilitary police _ not
regular police _ jurisdiction for the first time over political
meetings and demonstrations.
   Dissident journalist Sergei Grigoryants said unprovoked beatings
at Sunday's protest were unprecedented in recent times.
   On Sunday, the paramilitary police helped regular police stop a
Democratic Union protest in Moscow's Pushkin Square against the
Soviet-led invasion of Czechoslovakia 20 years ago.
   They wore khaki uniforms without insignias, black boots and
berets with Interior Ministry markings. More than 100 protesters
were arrested and dissidents said the paramilitaries beat and
kicked about 30 of them.
   Mityunov said some members of the force told those arrested they
had served in the Soviet army in Afghanistan.
   Paramilitary police units were reported in Armenia as early as
February, months before the decree. They helped quell
demonstrations by Armenians demanding the annexation of
Nagorno-Karabakh, a predominantly Armenian region attached to the
neighboring republic of Azerbaijan.
   Under the decree, paramilitary police need not obtain a search
warrant from a prosecutor, as regular police are required to do.
Mityunov said this violates a constitutional provision of
inviolability of the home.
   Gorbachev told a special Communist Party conference June 28
there should be ``strict observance of the rights of citizens to
the inviolability of their private life, home, the secrecy of
telephone communication, postal and telegraph correspondence.''
   On Friday, Mityunov said: ``Gorbachev ... called for creation of
a state based on laws, but even in the times of (Soviet dictator
Josef) Stalin there weren't laws that openly violated the
constitution, such as this one does regarding inviolability.''
   The decree says the paramilitary police will be used to stop
violations of public order that have a ``mass character,'' threaten
people's lives and health, disrupt businesses and damage property.

<DATELINE>YELLOWSTONE NATIONAL PARK, Wyo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Residents of two towns on
the edge of Yellowstone National Park were warned Friday they might
have to evacuate because of a 36,000-acre forest fire, and inside
the park rangers shepherded convoys of tourists down roads
otherwise closed by fires.
   Forest fires also threatened two communities in Oregon, where
youngsters at one Bible camp were sent home as a precaution.
Numerous fires also charred woodlands in parts of Washington,
California, Utah and Idaho, where one fast-moving fire forced
firefighters to pull back Friday.
   Two additional battalions of U.S. Army troops, about 1,200
soldiers, from Fort Lewis, Wash., were being trained to assist
hard-pressed civilian crews, according to officials of the Boise
Interagency Fire Center, which coordinates firefighting efforts in
the West. About 1,200 men from Fort Lewis already are fighting
fires in and near Yellowstone.
   Friday's two convoys of up to 350 cars allowed tourists to get
from one side of the park to the other in safety, after a ranger
drove the route between the park communities of Canyon and Norris
to check its condition.
   Ranger Mona Devine said notices were posted Thursday night
notifying visitors of the convoys. ``They think it's a big
adventure. Of course, some of the people are upset,'' she said.
   The convoys filed past the 114,000-acre ``North Fork'' fire, one
of 10 involving about 400,000 acres of the park.
   Just outside the park's northeast entrance, a 36,000-acre blaze
in the Absaroka-Beartooth wilderness area in south-central Montana
threatened two towns Friday and a fire official said evacuation
plans were ready.
   ``We have about a 30 to 40 percent chance that we would have to
evacuate'' Cooke City and Silver Gate, said David Liebersbach,
incident commander on the Storm Creek fire.
   The southern edge of the fire was about four miles north of
Cooke City and a rocky ridge with little vegetation stood between
the fire and the town, Liebersbach said.
   ``But today we have a forecast of high northerly winds and we
could have wind-carried embers that would carry as far as one mile
out in front of the fire,'' he said.
   He estimated that perhaps 500 to 1,000 people might be affected
if an evacuation is ordered.
   Yellowstone stopped charging its $10 entry fee Wednesday because
of the inconvenience fires created for visitors.
   But some visitors saw the restricted access in Yellowstone as a
blessing.
   ``I kind of enjoy being alone in Yellowstone at the height of
the tourist season,'' said Melanie Simcoff of San Francisco. ``This
is nice, actually, and they say we're here at a very historical
moment in the park's history.''
   Park facilities at Grant Village, Lewis Lake, Norris, Canyon,
Pebble Creek and Madison remained closed Friday.
   The park's west entrance was re-opened Friday morning, although
intermittent closures were expected. The only other major roads
open in the park included the one from the park's north entrance to
Mammoth and Tower; from the northeast entrance at Cooke City to
Tower and Mammoth; from Mammoth to Indian Creek; and from the west
entrance to Old Faithful, also subject to intermittent closures.
The park's south entrance near Grant Village also remained closed.
   On Friday afternoon, park officials began discouraging people
from leaving through the park's northeast entrance because the road
east of Cooke City was closed in case residents of that town have
to evacuate.
   From the south entrance, the Rockefeller Memorial Parkway
leading into Grand Teton National Park also was closed, because of
a 21,500-acre fire in the Bridger-Teton National Forest.
   Some 1,525 firefighters, including about 600 soldiers from Fort
Lewis, battled the 162,700-acre Clover-Mist fire burning in the
park and in steep, rugged terrain in the Shoshone National Forest.
   Elsewhere, residents of Maxville, Mont., a town of about two
dozen households 90 miles southwest of Helena, were told to stand
by Friday for possible evacuation as a fire spread to about 7,500
acres of heavy timber overnight, said Palmer Bowen, a fire
information officer. Winds pushed the fire away from the town
during the day, though, he said.
   The fire forced closure of the main road through the area,
destroyed a trailer home and two bulldozers and chased fire crews
out of a mining camp in the Deerlodge National Forest.
   In southwestern Oregon, the lightning-sparked Walker Mountain
fire crept within a half mile of a subdivision of about 1,000
people north of Grants Pass. In the northeastern corner of the
state, the Ward Canyon fire spread to within a mile of the tiny
community of Troy, authorities said.
   Both communities were placed on evacuation alert. The Ward
Canyon blaze had burned 15 unoccupied structures, mostly hunting
cabins.
   About 120 second-grade children from the Fir Point Bible Camp
were taken to a school about 25 miles north of Grants Pass ``as a
precautionary move'' after the Woods Creek fire grew to 500 acres,
said Jim Fisher, a state Forestry Department spokesman. He said the
children headed home Friday and the fire was 75 percent contained.
   Also in the state's northeast corner, the Tepee Butte fire
exploded to 18,000 acres of grass and timber by Friday morning from
150 acres Thursday afternoon, and firefighters said it could spread
to as many as 80,000 acres.
   In western Idaho, swirling winds and dry conditions forced fire
bosses to withdraw hundreds of firefighters from the raging Eagle
Bar fire near Hells Canyon, which spread to over 3,000 acres along
the Idaho-Oregon border.
   Thirty firefighters were trapped for an hour in a hotspot and
had to use their fire shelters for safety before being airlifted
out by helicopter at dawn.

<HEAD>Greece Says U.N.-Sponsored Cyprus Talks ``Encouraging''</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATHENS, Greece (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Greece on Friday called this week's
U.N.-sponsored talks between Cyprus President George Vassiliou and
Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash ``an encouraging start'' for
future negotiations.
   The two met in Geneva to try to break a three-year deadlock in
negotiations to reunite the east Mediterranean island.
   ``It is undoubtedly an encouraging start that could create the
preconditions for more concrete rapprochements between the two
sides in the future,'' government spokesman Sotiris Kostopoulos
said.
   Vassiliou said Thursday that his first meeting ever with
Denktash generated goodwill, ``but there is still a huge gap
between our positions.'' The two agreed to meet again Sept. 15 in
the island's capital, Nicosia.
   He repeated Greece's call for a Cyprus solution under U.N.
auspices, adding ``the Cyprus problem must also be solved within
the framework of international law.''
   Cyprus has been unofficially partitioned since 1974 when Turkey
invaded Cyprus after an abortive Athens-backed coup by supporters
of union with Greece.

   Here at a glance are major fires burning in the forests of the
West and Northwest:
   _Wyoming: Ten fires have burned an estimated 400,000 acres in
Yellowstone National Park, closing several roads and developed
communities.
   South of the park in the Bridger-Teton National Forest, the
22,811-acre Huck fire was burning to the northeast toward
Yellowstone's southern boundary.
   To the east in the Bighorn National Forest, firefighters
contained the 10,900-acre Lost fire Thursday.
   _Montana: A 36,000-acre blaze in the Absaroka-Beartooth
wilderness area in south-central Montana threatened the towns of
Cooke City and Silver Gate, just outside the northeast entrance to
Yellowstone.
   About 10 miles west, the Hellroaring Creek fire grew to about
30,900 acres.
   Southeast of Helena, fire crews were still trying to contain the
37,600-acre Warm Springs fire.
   _Oregon: In the southwest, the lightning-sparked 1,790-acre
Walker Mountain fire moved within a half-mile of a subdivision of
about 1,000 people north of Grants Pass. In the northeast, the
5,000-acre Ward Canyon fire moved to within a mile of the tiny
community of Troy. It had destroyed 15 unoccupied structures,
mostly hunting cabins. Also, the lightning-caused Teppe Butte fire
30 miles north of Enterprise ballooned to 18,000 acres from 150
acres Thursday afternoon.
   The Prophecy fire in Crater Lake National Park had burned 2,000
acres, spokeswoman Dee Westerberg said.
   _Washington: Six fires in Colville National Forest were spread
by wind overnight from 60 acres to an estimated 600 to 800 acres. A
4,000-acre fire burned out of control on the Colville Indian
Reservation with no one available to fight it.
   Lightning was blamed for at least 25 new fires in eastern
Washington.
   _Utah: The 200-acre Deer Lodge fire in Ashley National Forest
briefly threatened 15 to 20 summer homes before the wind changed. A
fire believed started by a spark from a bulldozer at the Powder
Mountain ski area grew to 450 acres.
   _Idaho: The Eagle Bar fire just east of Hells Canyon near the
Idaho-Oregon border grew to 3,000 acres; officials said wind-blown
embers started fires up to a half mile ahead of the main fire.
   _California: An 1,800-acre fire in trees, grass and brush near
Cloverdale, 65 miles northwest of San Francisco, was 90 percent
contained by fire lines and 75 percent controlled.

   Share prices recovered moderately in thin trading
on the Tokyo Stock Exchange Saturday following a major decline the
previous day.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues won back 113.50
points, or 0.41 percent, to close Saturday's half-day session at
27,678.91 points.
   The index plummeted 305.03 points Friday after European
countries raised their key lending rates, depressing stock markets
around the world.
   Volume traded on the first section of the exchange, where most
major shares are listed, was a light 230 million shares.
   ``The gain in the Nikkei index is largely caused by the rebound
of major shares such as steel and electronics,'' said a dealer at
Nikko Securities Co.
   ``But the market as a whole doesn't look too good. Trading is
very thin and a small number of investors are buying a portion of
shares which suffered a big loss yesterday (Friday),'' he added,
speaking on condition of anonymity.
   Another dealer at a major securities firm said the Tokyo market
will be revitalized again on Monday when securities companies start
a new monthly operation.
   Transactions made after Monday will go into the September
account for securities companies, which traditionally emphasize
stock trading within the first few days of each new month, the
dealer said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   The foreign exchange market is closed Saturdays.

   The ``Pogo'' comic strip, which went into
hibernation 15 years ago with the death of artist Walt Kelly, will
return in January with new adventures of the critters at the
Okefenokee Swamp.
   Artist Neal Sternecky, 27, and writer Larry Doyle, 29, who
worked together on the student newspaper at the University of
Ilinois at Urbana-Champaign, will revive Pogo the possum, Albert
the Alligator, Porky Pine, Howland Owl and Churchy LaFemme.
   ``Pogo,'' one of the first comic strips to comment on political
affairs and social issues, will continue to address current events,
said Lou Schwartz, president of Los Angeles Times Syndicate, which
will distribute the strip.

   Teachers throughout Massachusetts continue to lead
children in the Pledge of Allegiance each day, on the voluntary
basis supported by Gov. Michael Dukakis.
   ``Every elementary school child has an opportunity to say the
Pledge of Allegiance to the flag every day,'' Education
Commissioner Harold Raynolds said in an interview Thursday.
   Republican George Bush has attempted to make Dukakis' 1977 veto
of a state law requiring teachers to conduct the pledge into a
campaign issue in their presidential contest.
   Dukakis, in vetoing the bill, cited advisory legal opinions and
U.S. Supreme Court precedents that making the pledge mandatory
would be unconstitutional. He says he supports saying the pledge
itself.
   Raynolds said Massachusetts schools observe that policy of
encouraging the pledge on a voluntary basis.

   Organizers expect tens of thousands of people
to gather Saturday to try to rekindle the dream that the Rev.
Martin Luther King Jr. shared with the nation 25 years ago during
the march on Washington.
   King's widow, Coretta Scott King, Democratic presidential
nominee Michael S. Dukakis and civil rights leader Jesse Jackson
plan to address the gathering.
   But Republican presidential nominee George Bush did not respond
to an invitation, said the Rev. Joseph Lowery, who succeeded King
as head of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference.
   ``We have not heard from Mr. Bush,'' Lowery said at a news
conference Thursday. A Bush spokesman, Dan McLagan, said the vice
president plans to campaign in Texas on Saturday.
   An estimated 250,000 people marched in Washington on Aug. 28,
1963, one of the great days in the civil rights movement and the

   Nearly 12,000 people and dozens of famous
friends sang ``Happy Birthday'' to Leonard Bernstein in a four-hour
tribute that left America's most famous living conductor, usually
loquacious, nearly speechless.
   Bernstein chuckled and wept as friends, including actress Lauren
Bacall and composer-producer Quincy Jones, recalled the
conductor-composer's life and work at Thursday night's 70th
birthday gala at the Tanglewood music festival.
   But words almost failed the maestro when he was pulled to the
lectern for the finale.
   As hundreds of performers and the audience of 12,000 stamped
their feet, Bernstein shook his head ``no.''
   He grabbed the microphone, said, ``As Victor Borge would say
...,'' then let out a wail characteristic of the comic pianist.

   Pain and suffering were written on the face of
Emmanuel Kotlyar as he stressed to prominent political and cultural
figures the importance of building a center to chronicle the
millions _ like himself _ who fell victim to Josef Stalin.
   The frail man of 80 said he spent 14 years in a labor camp after
being arrested in 1929 on trumped-up charges, and hoped he would
live to see the building completed.
   ``We aren't doing it for us, but for the future generation,'' to
prevent a repetition of the terror, the balding Kotlyar said, his
body shaking, his voice trembling.
   Kotlyar stood with a cane at a microphone Thursday night in a
packed auditorium.
   For 2{ hours, about 200 intellectuals at the Union of Architects
headquarters brainstormed about what a monument to Stalin's victims
should look like, where it should be built and whether it should be
accompanied by a center that would study the repressions.

   For years, a mother and three grown children
in this small town were known as a strange brood: their furniture
was upside down, they refused to use household plumbing and shouted
at all hours of the night.
   But the odd habits of Anna K. Moore, 68, and her children
generated only sympathy from townspeople, which deepened when
utility workers found the decomposed body of Mrs. Moore's daughter,
Dawn, in their house, officials said.
   ``I feel terrible about this whole situation,'' said John C.
Mullins, the police chief in this southeast Kentucky town of 8,000
people. ``To me, the outcome of this is the Moore family is going
to be stuck in a mental institution.''
   Officers on Wednesday arrested Mrs. Moore, her 38-year-old
daughter Michella and Michella's twin brother John, police said.
They were taken to a Lexington hospital for a medical evaluation
ordered by Whitley District Judge R. Blaine Stewart.

   A former U.S. Army sergeant
arrested in West Germany headed an international spy ring that sold
NATO defense secrets to the Soviets at high prices for a decade,
officials said Thursday.
   ``We can't exclude the possibility that millions of dollars are
involved,'' said Alexander Prechtel, spokesman for the chief
federal prosecutor's office.
   A second American soldier who was not identified received a
``five-figure sum'' of money for supplying the ring with military
secrets, said Chief Federal Prosecutor Kurt Rebmann, and Prechtel
said two Hungarian-born brothers arrested Tuesday in Sweden with
cipher keys, coded messages and radios were a part of the ring.
   It was too early to know how much damage was caused to the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization, Prechtel said in an interview, but
the ring is believed to have stolen documents concerning NATO
defense plans for Europe and U.S. Army contingency plans for a
ground war with the Soviet Union in Europe.
   Clyde Lee Conrad, the former sergeant, was arrested Tuesday, and
a statement from the prosecutor's office said he was charged with
``compelling suspicion of espionage activities in an especially
grave case.''

   Authorities on Thursday released Burma's
top dissident and nearly 1,700 anti-government protesters, and
hundreds of thousands more rallied to demand immediate democracy,
rejecting the president's proposal to consider multiparty rule.
   Dissident Aung Gyi left Insein Jail, quickly organized a rally
of about 200,000 people, and demanded an interim government be
formed to lead the nation to democracy.
   On Wednesday, President Maung Maung bowed to three days of mass
protests against one-party rule and called for a referendum on
multiparty democracy. The leader _ the nation's third in five weeks
_ lifted martial law imposed Aug. 3 in Rangoon, withdrew troops
from the city center and lifted curfews throughout the country.
   But to the people in the streets Thursday, the moves clearly
were insufficient.
   About 400,000 people marched through the streets of the capital
demanding the government give the people democracy immediately,
witnesses said. Diplomats earlier said up to 1 million people
marched in the city Wednesday.

   Government figures showed Thursday that the
economy, surging through a stiff drag caused by the drought, grew
at the surprisingly brisk annual pace of 3.3 percent in the second
quarter but inflation hit a six-year peak of 5.1 percent.
   The Commerce Department said that the gain in the gross national
product, the total output of goods and services, would have soared
beyond the 3.3 percent clip had it not been for a
larger-than-expected $9.5 billion loss in farm production. Without
that impact of the drought, GNP growth from April through June
would have hit a 4.3 percent annual pace, it said.
   The 5.1 percent inflation rate, compared with just 1.7 percent
in the first quarter, sparked new worries that the Federal Reserve
will be forced to step up its anti-inflation campaign by sending
interest rates even higher to quell the heatup.

   Too many school lunches rate a ``C'' grade
because of their high fat content, a consumer nutrition group said
Thursday, urging cafeterias to serve ``healthfully modified'' meals
such as chili atop baked potatoes instead of hot dogs.
   Ellen Haas, executive director of Public Voice for Food and
Health Policy, said her group spotted encouraging trends toward
fresh fruit and vegetables in a survey of school menus.
   But she said the main courses served in school cafeterias ``far
too often are fried foods'' and other dishes high in saturated fat.
   The $3.7 billion school lunch program, serving some 27 million
children, is run by the Agriculture Department. Surplus commodities
purchased by USDA account for 20 percent of the foods used in the
program.

   All of the 350 observers, drawn from 24 countries, were in place

   Fahmawi said that since the cease-fire took effect Aug. 20,

   But diplomats and other sources said that mixups over
transportation, passports, communications and protocol meant that

   The leader, Maj. Pierre Buyoya, was quoted on state-run Radio

Burundians have fled to Rwanda to escape fighting between the
majority Hutu and the minority Tutsi, who control Burundi's

   The government said Monday that 5,000 people were killed, but
Buyoya said some bodies may not have been counted. The government
said its initial figure came from gravediggers sent to bury the

   Buyoya said the soldiers who killed Hutu civilians were not
acting under government orders but started the slaughter after
discovering the bodies of Tutsi tribesmen.

<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A year after a leaking gasoline line caused
his car to explode, 25-year-old Donald Cowart remained so severely
burned that he would die without long and painful treatment. Cowart
asked to be allowed to die.
   Question: Should the hospital grant his request?
   The increasing frequency of questions like this has led to a
national resurgence in the study of ethics, according to Preston K.
Covey, director of Carnegie Mellon University's Center for the
Advancement of Applied Ethics, which opened in June.
   Ethicists say the number of such centers has been increasing in
the last decade, especially at medical schools.
   ``If your medical school or center doesn't have a serious
program to address the ethical as well as the scientific, you are
kind of behind the times,'' said Bruce Jennings, associate for
policy studies at New York's Hastings Center, perhaps the oldest
ethics research institute, founded in 1969.
   ``I would say there has been a change in attitudes since the
1950s and 1960s when philosophers felt the study of ethics was not
very interesting,'' he said. ``Now it's one of the most vital areas
in academic philosophy.''
   Carnegie Mellon decided to open an ethics center because, like
many other universities, ``we felt that a new priority should be
given to ethics and values,'' Covey said. ``Instead of just caring
about them, we should start doing something about them.''
   The university expects its center will help students and
professionals deal with a wide range of ethical issues, including
insider trading, influence peddling, managing AIDS in the
workplace, sexual harassment, South African divestment,
whistleblowing, fetal tissue research, abortion, organ transplants
and affirmative action, Covey said.
   A Carnegie Mellon videodisc telling the story of Cowart's 1973
accident and subsequent medical care, called ``The Right to Die,''
is used to guide businessmen, government officials and health care
professionals through the complexities of moral questions that
didn't exist 20 years ago, Covey said.
   At certain points in the story, the videodisc is stopped to
allow seminar participants to debate the ethical issues and make
their own decisions about what should have been done.
   Cowart was not allowed to die, and today he is remarried and a
practicing attorney in Texas, Covey said.
   The Kennedy Institute of Ethics at Georgetown University in
Washington, D.C., lists 56 U.S. ethics centers or programs in its
International Directory of Bioethics Organizations, many of them
formed in the last few years.
   Spectacular science fiction-like news stories about new medical
techniques and capabilities have helped glamorize ethics, said
Albert Jonsen, who heads the University of Washington School of
Medicine's new department of Medical History and Ethics.
   ``The first heart transplant was done in the late 1960s and that
captured the attention of everyone,'' Jonsen said. ``Every one was
asking, `Is that right? Taking the heart out of one person and
putting it in another?' The media played that up in a big way and
got a big response.''
   The reaction also enlivened debate among philosophers,
scientists and doctors, he said.
   ``The reactions to that within medicine was to say, `This is
fantastic technology _ what's its best use? It may have adverse
consequences,''' Jonsen said.
   ``In medicine you're supposed to benefit your patients. That's
the first rule. The ethical question we are asking is can this .. .
benefit my patient?''
   The University of Pittsburgh's Center for Medical Ethics, which
opened in February 1987, was formed after administrators and
faculty began reflecting on medical cases that grabbed the public's
attention, said center director Alan Meisel.
   ``One day in 1984, I picked up the paper and found a front-page
story on Baby Faye, the little girl who received a baboon's heart
at Loma Linda University Medical Center in California. I reflected
about that every day for a week, and I thought of similar
stories,'' Meisel said.
   ``Finally, we said that this is an important topic and we should
do something about it.''
   Kidney dialysis and organ transplantation sparked ethical
debates in the 1970s, said LeRoy Walters, director for the Kennedy
Institute's biomedical ethics center.
   ``Today the new developments are in genetics and reproduction,''
he said. ``Also, with the emphasis on the civil rights movement and
the women's movement, more patients have been demanding more
information from doctors about themselves, about their conditions,
and there has been more emphasis on the patient's right to
determine what treatment he or she should have.''
   The University of Minnesota's year-old Center for Biomedical
Ethics also was formed after medical school administrators,
students and doctors agreed more attention should be paid to
ethics, said center director Arthur Caplan.
   ``You need new ethical norms at a time of rapid change,'' Caplan
said.
   Although only a few weeks old, the Carnegie Mellon center
already has been busy conducting seminars for the Edison Electric
Institute, the Pittsburgh office of the Internal Revenue Service,
the federal Department of Agriculture and a number of other groups
and agencies.
   Advances in medical technology have led to perhaps the most
uncomfortable, most highly publicized ethical questions, but
difficult issues also arise in other areas, ethicists say.
   ``Suppose you sat down and thought about rearranging your
investment portfolio to avoid businesses and investments in South
Africa,'' Covey said. ``Could you come out just as well? And if you
could and it doesn't cost you anything, wouldn't that be a good
thing to do? ...
   ``For a variety of reasons, the business world is becoming more
alert to ethical issues _ either to keep out of trouble or make
their operations run more smoothly or because they simply want to
be more responsible ethically to their employees and to society,''
Covey said.
   Like other ethics centers, the Carnegie Mellon center does not
advocate particular moral values, however.
   ``The idea is not to sell ethics consulting, but to help people
come to grips with ethical issues on their own,'' Covey said.

   Sometimes, one can get sick of all that
culture during a European vacation.
   That, anyway, is how it appears to Dr. Graziella Magherini, the
head of psychiatry at Santa Maria Nuova Hospital in central
Florence.
   In the past 10 years she has treated more than 115 tourists for
what she calls ``Stendhal's Syndrome'' _ an emotional reaction to
hundreds of years of history and art, all hitting the traveler at
once.
   ``The historical memory in these cities of art stirs the
emotions,'' she says. ``They can be emotions of great pleasure but
also of great pain.''
   With its vast pink-and-green Duomo cathedral, its museums filled
with Renaissance art and its dark cobbled streets, Florence is a
throwback to another century _ except, of course, for the hordes of
backpackers and signs reading in English, ``We make real Italian
ice cream.''
   Magherini maintains that the overwhelming sense of the past
sometimes disorients tourists and leads to panic attacks, intense
feelings of persecution and abandonment and a loss of a sense of
reality and identity.
   ``Very often, there's the anguish of death,'' she says, prompted
by the vivid sense of historical figures that reminds visitors of
their own mortality.
   Magherini's work has aroused considerable interest, not to
mention debate, in the hometown of Michelangelo, Botticelli and
Donatello.
   ``It sounds simply ridiculous,'' declares Serena Padova,
assistant director of the Palatine Gallery.
   Patrizio Ostecresi, administrator of the Duomo, says he's seen
no unusual effect inspired by the church.
   ``People have committed suicide here,'' he says, knitting his
brow. ``But I don't think it's the art.''
   Nonetheless, the local government is interested in the research.
The city of 425,000 receives 5 million tourists a year who spend
upwards of $670 million.
   The province of Florence last year gave Magherini and several
researchers a grant to expand their study. They are now trying to
get data from Venice and Jerusalem to see if the phenomenon exists
there.
   Magherini says she first noticed something wrong a decade ago,
as more and more tourists visiting the works of art arrived at the
hospital filled with anguish. A thing of beauty, it seemed, was not
always a joy to behold.
   Most people suffered psychological problems, but some also
complained of heart palpitations or dizziness.
   She perceived two categories of sufferers: solitary travelers,
often Europeans of a sentimental bent; and members of organized
tours who apparently have difficulty adjusting to new things.
   Many of the latter group, she says, are Americans from small
towns and ``with a cultural level that is not very sophisticated.''
   The team has studied the cases of 115 people who were
hospitalized, but many other people were treated and released,
Magherini says.
   The researchers decided to name the problem after Stendhal, the
French novelist who lived in Italy in the early 19th century and
wrote of being overwhelmed emotionally by the beauty and the past
in Florence's Santa Croce Church.
   Modern Stendhals have reached crisis points before
Michelangelo's statue of David and Caravaggio's painting of
Bacchus, and under the concentric circles in the Duomo cupola,
Magherini says.
   However, it's not like tourists are disturbed by a Donatello or
terrified by a Titian. ``It's everything put together,'' she says.
   Magherini admits that the some of the symptoms may stem from
travel weariness and stress.
   However, she says, ``most people have spoken of how they felt in
this city, their rapport with this city.''
   Dr. Paulo Pancheri, director of the Adult Psychology Clinic at
the University of Rome, said people can be moved by historic cities
but ``it doesn't seem likely it would be a syndrome.''
   Nicola Carriglia, Florence's tourism director, suggests that the
problem is really the crowds and the quick pace of modern travel.
   ``It isn't the monuments and the art that make people feel
sick,'' he insists.
   Magherini advises her patients to rest and be with people of
their own culture. In some cases, she prescribes tranquilizers.
   ``Italian cities of art are outside the reality of American
life,'' notes the Duomo's Ostecresi. ``Here a normal building is
300 or 400 years old. People sometimes feel like they're in a
film.''
   Visitors need to take more time, he says, adding: ``Even
Stendhal tried to see too much.''

<HEAD>Tennessee Williams Comes To Life At Edinburgh Festival</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MATT WOLF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>EDINBURGH, Scotland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Tennessee Williams, the tortured and
talented Pulitzer Prize winner, is being reborn at the Edinburgh
Festival in a one-man show that pays homage to one of America's
greatest playwrights.
   ``I like to think of it as a tribute to the man,'' actor Ray
Stricklyn said of ``Confessions of a Nightingale,'' his solo show
about the late author of ``The Glass Menagerie'' and ``A Streetcar
Named Desire.''
   The 90-minute play, adapted by Stricklyn and Charlotte Chandler
from Chandler's book, ``The Ultimate Seduction,'' had its European
debut on Aug. 24 at Edinburgh's St. Cecilia's Hall. It is the only
American theatrical offering among this year's official line-up at
the Scottish capital's 42nd annual arts binge.
   The 54-year-old Stricklyn introduced the show in January 1985 at
the Beverly Hills Playhouse in California. The tanned,
silver-haired actor has taken it on regular tours ever since,
stopping at New York's Jack Lawrence Theater for a brief run in the
fall of 1986.
   ``It's been a wonderful high,'' Stricklyn said in an interview
prior to the first of five Edinburgh performances.
   He said that Williams, who died in 1984 one month before his
73rd birthday, had been an important influence in his life,
figuring in ``the beginnings, the so-called end and then the
restart (of my career).''
   In 1953, newly arrived in New York from his home in Houston,
Texas, Stricklyn used a Williams one-act play to audition for drama
school. The first Broadway play he ever saw was ``The Glass
Menagerie,'' and the fledgling actor even found himself acting
opposite the playwright at a party in the mid-1950s.
   ``I always said Tennessee was my first leading lady,'' chuckled
Stricklyn. The reading, from the Hungarian play ``Fata Morgana,''
cast Williams as an older woman in love with the young man played
by Stricklyn.
   In 1972, Stricklyn decided to give up acting to join a public
relations firm in Los Angeles, and he made what he thought would be
his farewell stage appearance playing Lord Byron in a Houston
production of Williams' ``Camino Real.''
   Then, in 1983, he returned to the stage in a Los Angeles
production of Williams' ``Vieux Carre,'' and the chance to embody
the playwright soon followed.
   ``I started it in a small way, never dreaming it would have a
life,'' he said of ``Confessions,'' which began as a short piece to
accompany the unveiling of a bust of Williams at the Beverly Hills
Playhouse.
   Stricklyn was wary at first of continuing the impersonation: ``I
was very hesitant; I had always avoided one-person shows.'' But he
soon found the rewards irresistible.
   ``It opened up a whole new career for me because I had been a
juvenile actor when I quit,'' he said. ``When I was 35, I was still
getting occasional calls to play teen-agers. Doris Day had nothing
on me.''
   Stricklyn empathized with Williams' own concerns about
depression, aging and the vicissitudes of life in the theater.
   ``I certainly felt I could identify from the point of view of a
career that had started off well as a young actor and then the
years when it wasn't working and I had to get out of the
business,'' he said.
   Stricklyn is working again, with seasons on TV's ``The Colbys''
and ``Dynasty'' behind him and a stint on the CBS series, ``Wise
Guy.''
   Following Edinburgh, Stricklyn takes ``Confessions'' to North
Carolina and then is hoping for a run in London.
   The experience, he said, has been cathartic in a way Williams
might have understood.
   ``Tennessee had a wonderful line: `If I get rid of my demons I
lose my angels,''' said Stricklyn. ``I'm trying to do everything in
reverse: to get rid of my demons and gain my angels.''

<HEAD>Rats! A New Reason to Stay Up Even `Later'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KATHRYN BAKER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   OK, so you've managed to stay awake all the way
through ``Late Night with David Letterman.'' Now it's time to hit
the hay, right?
   Wrong. NBC is torturing sleepyheads sans VCRs by tacking on a
new half hour after Letterman that's gonna be hard to turn off _
``Later with Bob Costas.''
   Yeah, Costas is that sports guy, the one who does baseball for
NBC. But this is not a sports show, and Costas has quickly proven
himself a facile interviewer with an intelligent, easygoing style
that fits just about any kind of guest.
   For his premiere week last week, he had a candid, two-part
interview with newswoman-author Linda Ellerbee, handled delicate
questioning of former child superstar Gary Coleman and traded bits
with comedian Billy Crystal. Part 2 of the Crystal interview airs
tonight.
   The first show with Ellerbee was extremely serious. Outspoken as
she is, Ellerbee seemed even more open than usual when she talked
about her late colleague Jessica Savitch, the subject of a couple
of recent tell-all books that raise questions about the way NBC
handled the troubled star.
   Ellerbee told Costas of her one-time jealousy toward the
beautiful blond anchorwoman, then her eventual realization that
Savitch was a woman out of her league and painfully aware of it,
gradually sinking into drug abuse. Ellerbee said she and some NBC
colleagues met over a weekend to plan some kind of psychological
rescue mission, but it was too late. Savitch drowned when her car
fell into a canal adjoining a restaurant parking lot; the accident
was unrelated to drugs.
   Costas handles the subject sensitively. The next night with
Ellerbee was lighter as she offered up her irreverent assessment of
network news, and the two ended up in a funny, casual discussion of
the movie ``Broadcast News.'' Viewers might as well have been
sitting around the kitchen table with them.
   With Coleman, Costas had another serious story on his hands. The
one-time toast of TV when he starred on ``Diff'rent Strokes,''
Coleman is now a grown young man with serious health problems _ he
needs a third kidney transplant _ and very little acting work. He
is bitter toward his parents and management for not giving him more
guidance as a child. Costas elicited the necessary information, but
allowed the young actor to maintain his dignity throughout.
   Costas seemed overprepared for Crystal, occasionally asking
questions that contained answers _ ``What's different about your
(Muhammad) Ali (impression) compared to others who may have gotten
the voice but not the character?'' or, about life on the road as a
standup comic, ``Is it true you often ate dinner by the bathroom
light in the motel?''
   By tonight's show, Costas hits his stride with Crystal. There's
a very nice exchange when Crystal recalls the genesis of perhaps
his best comedy bit, his bittersweet impersonation of an old, black
jazz musician _ ``Can you dig it? I knew that you could.''
Crystal's father produced jazz shows and he remembers being around
those guys when he was a child and being profoundly influenced by
them.
   ``That's the reason I've always performed, was these guys,'' he
tells Costas. ``Because no matter what was happening to them, when
they got up and played, they felt good.''
   Costas gets to combine his first love, baseball, in this
interview when he and Crystal discuss the brilliant, 8-minute film
Crystal and Christopher Guest made for ``Saturday Night Live,'' in
which they played two retired Negro League baseball players,
Rooster and The King. Costas doesn't miss a beat when Crystal
suggests being interviewed for a few minutes in character as
Rooster.
   For the next two weeks, Costas continues his eclectic guest list
with Larry King, Sonny Bono, Chuck Norris, Rona Barrett, ``Phantom
of the Opera'' star Michael Crawford and ``Night Court'' star John
Larroquette.
   The show airs only Monday-Thursday, because, as Costas notes,
``nobody wants to tinker with that great American institution,
`Friday Night Videos,''' which incidentally also has Dick Ebersol
as its executive producer.
   Costas will not be relegated to only late-night all season. He's
on NBC's team covering the prime-time Summer Olympics starting next
month. But insomniacs needn't worry. Costas has taped enough shows
to cover him while he's in Seoul.

<HEAD>Upcoming: Bigger Merit Raises</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A big change could be coming in payroll merit
increases as an intense period of corporate belt-tightening begins
to relax.
   The possibility doesn't represent any change of heart by those
who control payrolls, but instead is simply the hardnosed
recognition of an economic reality _ that there may not be much to
be gained through further tightening.
   It is nothing new in American life. It has happened before and
will happen again because it is a self-correcting cyclical
phenomenon, as a bit of recent history illustrates.
   At the tail end of the 1970s, for example, major companies
sought to improve their net income by cutting staffs, limiting pay
raises and otherwise becoming leaner, meaner and more efficient.
   It wasn't a choice easily arrived at, and in fact, it was long
delayed. For nearly two decades American companies had been
developing an enormous midriff of white-collar workers _ and
becoming less competitive because of it.
   The problem was exacerbated by inflation, which rose to
double-digit levels and effectively priced many American products
out of the growing global marketplace. Change was imperative. Costs
had to be cut.
   One company after another adopted the same policy: Pare staffs
and restrain pay raises; get more net for the payroll dollar. Some
companies went further and closed plants, but most just watched the
payroll.
   Then, as the economy recovered from the big recession of the
early 1980s, the pressure came off again. Growth was in again. In
1982, according to a compensation survey released this week, merit
raises rose 9.1 percent.
   And then, once again, the lid came down. American companies,
though more efficient now, continued to receive stiff competition
from abroad. Payroll-watching was in again. Work forces shrank;
salary increases dwindled.
   Since 1982, according to Sibson & Co., a management consulting
firm, salary increases have declined steadily. By 1988, merit
increases averaged just 5.3 percent. And next year, says Sibson,
the average will be 5.2 percent.
   But now, it states, the cutting may have reached its limit. The
jobless rate is down to the mid-5 percent range, meaning most of
those laid-off workers have found new jobs. Companies now are
looking for workers.
   It could mean a big shift of emphasis by those who watch the
bottom line. Instead of improving profits by squeezing payrolls,
some companies now might have to seek results by rewarding good
workers with bigger pay raises.
   The result, says Sibson, could be the end next year of seven
years of steadily declining salary increases and downsizing of
staffs.
   ``It appears companies may have achieved all they can in those
areas,'' says James Mitchell, a Sibson principal who managed the
survey, the results of which are based on responses from 653
companies.
   Many companies are much leaner today than four years ago, said
Michell, adding that the key issue now facing companies is how to
retrain and motivate those employees who have remained with their
organizations.
   He concludes that ``incentive programs which allow companies to
share the risks and reward with their employees will take on a
greater role as organizations address this issue.''
   Mitchell said three-quarters of survey participants now have
incentive compensation programs, and that many are planning to
extend them.
   The reason, he says, is corporations recognize they need to pay
more attention to motivating workers, to rewarding performance and
to increasing productivity.
   And, as it was in the earlier part of the cycle, when downsizing
and pay restraints were in vogue, the goal is the same: The bottom
line.

<HEAD>Leslie Caron Revels in Gigi's Other Side</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ELAINE GANLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   She was a waif-like but winsome coquette whose
delicious romantic romps added a touch of whimsy to the 1950s and
early '60s. Today, Leslie Caron, the ``Gigi'' of yesteryear, is a
grandmother who's about to portray the matriarch of fashion Coco
Chanel in a TV movie.
   She's also written a book of short stories called ``Vengeance,''
and a screenplay she describes as a ``parable of war.''
   ``I suppose I have two sides to my nature,'' Caron said in an
interview. ``But I'm not cute. Whatever I am, cute is not the
word.''
   Caron retains a place in film history, a time when the musical
embodied the spirit and romance of an era. Beginning in 1951 with
Gene Kelly in ``An American in Paris,'' through ``Daddy Longlegs''
with Fred Astaire in 1955 to 1958's Academy Award-winning ``Gigi,''
she won the hearts of audiences around the world.
   But now, more than three decades later at the age of 57, she is
remembered mainly as America's French gamine-in-residence.
   While still a teen-ager, Caron was plucked from a Paris ballet
by Kelly, who took her to Hollywood where she went under contract
for MGM.
   ``I was stereotyped after `An American in Paris,''' she said.
``And I think Americans a long, long time ago decided that I was
cute, a gamine and all those things. Actually, I'm a very serious
person.''
   Caron credits much of her artistic bent to the legacy left by
her American-born mother, a dancer whose own dreams went
unfulfilled. ``My mother protected me and helped me fulfill my
wishes. But I think they were the expression of her wishes.''
   Her mother's suicide in 1967 stoked her determination and left
``a feeling of unfinished business.'' As she approached 40, she
took up writing and refuge in Paris, her hometown.
   A word processer sits on a table in her living room. Caron had
just returned from the printer with the script of the film she
wrote and plans to direct.
   ``It's a moral tale. It's about the incapacity of people to get
along. In other words, it's a parable of war on a family scale,''
she said.
   The screenplay, whose title she refuses to divulge, is to be a
family affair. She hopes her children, Christopher and
actress-daughter, Jennifer, who has given her a grandchild, will
participate in the project. Both are the children of her second
marriage to Peter Hall, director of Britain's National Theater.
Caron has been married three times.
   She has written what she calls a ``good part'' for herself,
meaning neither cute nor guileless. ``I might have been innocent
and guileless when I was 18,'' she said. ``But, my God, the years
have passed and I've lived quite a lot of drama. And the public
keeps seeing the same films on the television.''
   In 1984, Doubleday and Co. published a collection of her short
stories, ``Vengeance.''
   ``They are sort of brutal,'' she said. ``No, cruel is the better
word. I do have a sharp eye and a wicked sense of humor.''
   As a one-time star still at work, Caron is finally able to
stretch herself as an actress in a variety of roles.
   ``For the last 10 years, the spectrum of parts I'm offered just
swings widely,'' she said.
   Most recently, she portrays Chanel in a syndicated TV miniseries
for the fall season, ``The Man Who Lived at the Ritz.'' Based on
the best-selling novel by A.E. Hotchner, it is the story of an
American artist, played by Perry King, caught in wartime Paris
between the Resistance and the Nazis.
   Last year, Caron played the submissive wife of Lenin, portrayed
by Ben Kingsley in the movie, ``The Train,'' which recounted the
exiled Lenin's journey home to start the Russian Revolution. She
also appeared in an episode last year on TV's ``Falcon Crest.''
   Caron thinks of herself as a survivor.
   ``I remember a rather cruel producer, cruel and rude, who said
as she hired me that she so admired (Brigitte) Bardot for retiring
when she was losing her looks,'' Caron recalled. ``I think it's so
against everything I believe because so long as there is life,
there's a contribution you can make. ... I think one must not just
be banking on one's looks.''

<HEAD>Irwin Winkler Is ``Hands-On'' Producer</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HILLEL ITALIE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Film producer Irwin Winkler prefers being on the
front line to thinking about the bottom line.
   ``For the good producer, raising capital is about the last thing
to worry about,'' he said. ``If you're good, the money comes very
easily.
   ``Everybody sees themselves through the golden light. I see
myself as somebody involved from the very conception. Every film I
do I'm involved with from the very conception of the project.''
   Winkler (``Rocky,'' ``The Right Stuff,'' ``Raging Bull'') sticks
to that principle on his latest production, ``Betrayed.'' He
developed the screenplay, helped with casting, was on the set
during filming and worked on the post-production and promotion.
   ``Betrayed'' was directed by Costa-Gavras (``Z,'' ``Missing'')
and stars Debra Winger and Tom Berenger. Winger plays an FBI agent
who must learn whether Berenger, a Texas farmer, is involved with
right-wing extremist activities.
   The opening scene of ``Betrayed'' shows the murder of a
controversial radio personality by a white extremist group, similar
to the 1984 slaying of Denver talk-show host Alan Berg.
   ``I was interested in the subject of the murder of Berg and then
I did some research,'' Winkler said. ``I found this kind of
widespread group of extremists. This is a group of people looking
to overthrow the United States government.''
   Though the producer does not call ``Betrayed'' a ``message
film,'' he hopes it will increase awareness about extremist groups.
   ``What we say is that you've got to face it,'' he said. ``You
can't run away. The only problem I can see for the film is not
enough people want to recognize that it exists in our country.''
   Berenger was the first to be cast. His work as the scarred
sergeant in the Academy Award-winning ``Platoon'' attracted the
filmmakers. ``We really wanted someone who was very All-American;
there aren't that many of them,'' Winkler said.
   Winkler prides himself on the care put into each of his films;
his active participation is atypical of film producers.
   ``Probably in this business, you couldn't name more than a dozen
really hard-working, caring producers that are involved creatively
making the film,'' he said.
   Winkler worked as a mailboy, a projectionist and a clapper _ one
who goes to live TV shows and applauds and laughs _ before deciding
to get into the movie business.
   He began producing films in the 1960s and had his first major
hit in 1969 with ``They Shoot Horses, Don't They?'' which received
nine Academy Award nominations and won the best actor prize for Gig
Young. Winkler's biggest success came with ``Rocky,'' which
received 10 nominations in 1976 and won the Oscar for best picture.
   ``It was just a nice little movie, very cheap,'' Winkler
recalled. ``I think it caught the American conciousness at the
time. Maybe because we were just coming out of the (Vietnam) war
and everybody wanted to believe in something, and here was a
character who believed in himself.
   ``The whole purpose of the movie was, even if you don't win the
title, if you have self-respect it's more important.''
   Despite his string of successes, Winkler, like most producers,
is largely unknown to the general public, which tends to associate
producers with the financial aspect of the film.
   ``Most of the producers don't know what they do. The
misconception of the producers' function is really not a
misconception. Most producers don't do a very good job,'' he said.
   ``That perception of the producer whose just out there packaging
all of this is generally right.''
   While film critics usually detect a pattern in the films of a
certain director or actor, the producer's contribution often
remains unnoticed. Winkler believes a basic theme does exist, a
``Winkler'' trademark, so to speak in many of his films.
   ``Somebody pointed it out to me that almost every film I'm
involved with deals with how people react in a particular
situation, usually a situation of stress,'' he said.
   ``Whether it's a guy like Rocky, responding with courage and
daring or Debra Winger in `Betrayed,' if you go through all those
films, you find that common thread.''
   Winkler does not see that pattern in most of the films now being
made. ``I think the biggest change in the industry is that the
studios have really become conglomerates so there's not the
personal touch you used to have.''
   He is also concerned about the lack of quality screenplays.
``That's what's hurting the business the most. What we really have
to do is show some respect for the writers and encourage more young
people to become writers so we'll have better stories.''
   Although many of Winkler's productions have been financially
successful, he does not claim any expertise in what makes a film
popular at the box office.
   ``You can never figure,'' he said. ``It's a mysterious set of
circumstances.''
   As for his movies: ``I'm just trying to tell a nice story.
Whether you're a writer or a producer, all you want to do is tell a
good yarn.''

<HEAD>Santana Strikes Chord In Musical Scene After Two Decades</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ANTHONY MARQUEZ</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When jazz great Miles Davis recently
praised the originality of Carlos Santana, the low-key musician
expressed satisfaction that he still strikes a singular chord on
the musical scene after two decades.
   ``For Miles to tell me this, hey, that's a great compliment, but
it shows that I'm not on stagnant water,'' said Santana, who's
admired for his stirring guitar solos. ``Stagnant water stinks. You
need water to go out, you need water to come in _ all the time. And
in order to do it, you have to become a student. Once you have a
master's and you know everything, it's a drag.''
   To keep his music flowing, Santana will release a three-record
LP early next month and has launched a tour that reunites Gregg
Rolie, Jose ``Chepito'' Areas and Michael Shrieve, three original
members of the band that evolved during jam sessions in San
Francisco's heavily Hispanic Mission District.
   The Santana Blues Band made its debut in 1968 at the Fillmore
West where Santana recently held court at a small side table
overlooking busy Geary Street, talking about his new album, the
feelings behind his music and the popularity of Latin-rhythm groups.
   The Mexican-born Santana arrived in San Francisco in 1961,
entering the national spotlight with a show-stopping performance at
Woodstock in 1969. He has gone on to earn 14 gold albums, nine
platinum albums and sell more than 25 million records worldwide.
   Despite a pocketful of popular hits _ including ``Evil Ways,''
``Black Magic Woman,'' ``Oye Como Va,'' ``Soul Sacrifice'' and
``Europa'' _ the 41-year-old Santana has continued experimenting.
The new anthology, including some unreleased cuts, serves to ``give
a testimony of the things we have become and lived.''
   ``We're looking to take the music further. I mean, play the
music and respect it for the way you play it, but also embrace the
future and take some new chances,'' said the slender, mustachioed
Santana.
   ``We want to serve the people with our music,'' he said. ``Music
is a healing force if played correctly. I really believe that,
aside from being the universal language, it's a healing force and
reminds us that we have more things in common than we think.''
   For Santana, who began playing guitar at age 8, music has never
been a strictly commercial endeavor.
   ``Music is not to make a living,'' he said. ``Music is to help
the conditioning of life. People play for many different reasons
and all of them according to their heart's capacity. My capacity
tells me that I can do a great service by doing music correctly.
People know when you're playing something from your heart and when
you're just giving lip service.''
   Before Gloria Estefan and the Miami Sound Machine began doing
the ``Conga'' and Los Lobos started playing ``Tex-Mex,'' Santana
was infusing his music with the ``Latin rhythm.''
   In past cuts such as ``Samba Pa Ti,'' ``Oye Como Va'' and
``Black Magic Woman,'' Santana showcased ``salsa'' when it was
still considered something to add to Mexican dishes.
   Still, most of the recent publicity surrounding Hispanic-theme
movies _ ``La Bamba,'' ``Stand and Deliver'' and ``Milagro
Beanfield War'' _ and Latin-rhythm musical groups fail to even
mention Santana.
   ``For Gloria Estefan and Los Lobos and all the other
Spanish-speaking people today, if they want to go to the future,
they got to go through me first,'' Santana said.
   On the other hand, Santana expressed satisfaction his music has
not been easily categorized, and points out his innovative music
has endured for two decades.
   ``I consider myself a musician and a stylist, in bringing forth
a certain thing that all generations can relate to,'' he said.
``That's better for me than being something mega-everything for
three years.''
   The new album, titled ``Viva Santana!,'' is the latest of 25 LPs
released during his career. He also cut albums with Buddy Miles and
John McLaughlin.
   The tour began on Aug. 26 at Tacoma, Wash. Some scheduled stops
include St. Louis, Richmond, Va., New York, Boston, Atlanta, Dallas
and Los Angeles.

   Republican vice presidential nominee Dan
Quayle built up a record in Congress that departed only
occasionally from the Reagan administration's line but along the
way he took some positions he doesn't mention in his resume.
   For example, he advocated special tax breaks for smokers,
dieters, foreign golfers, batboys and batgirls for professional
baseball teams, and college football coaches.
   The tax breaks for smokers and dieters was proposed in a ```Kick
the Habit' Tax Credit Bill,'' which he sponsored and which, in the
interest of health, would have allowed a tax credit up to $150 for
half the cost of enrolling in a weight-loss or stop-smoking
program. It didn't become law.
   And Quayle once threatened to try to rename Chicago in honor of
former Sen. Vance Hartke, D-Ind., unless some Illinois lawmakers
dropped efforts to rename the Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore in
memory of the late Sen. Paul H. Douglas, D-Ill.
   During his four years in the House and almost eight years in the
Senate, the Indiana senator has been a steady advocate for military
spending and for reducing the government's role in daily life. Some
votes have put him at odds with organized labor, veterans and other
interest groups.
   Quayle sought to overhaul federal budget procedures in an effort
to cut the budget deficit. He voted for President Reagan's big 1981
tax cut and then followed that with votes to raise taxes in 1982,
1983, 1984 and 1987 _ tax increases that Reagan signed after vowing
to oppose tax increases. Quayle now is on record with his running
mate, George Bush, to oppose future tax increases.
   On May 10, 1985, Quayle and most other Senate Republicans voted
for a budget that would have eliminated the cost-of-living increase
in Social Security pensions while boosting the defense budget to
offset inflation. The vice president broke a 49-49 tie and the
budget passed. The House subsequently refused to cut the Social
Security increases.
   The 41-year-old Quayle is best known as an author of the 1982
Job Training Partnership Act, which emphasized involvement of local
government and private employers in training young and unskilled
workers. His Senate co-author was Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass.,
whose name the Republicans invoke with ridicule on the campaign
trail.
   As a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, Quayle
developed a reputation for learning the intricacies of the defense
budget and weapons systems. Few are more vocal in support of
Reagan's Strategic Defense Initiative _ nicknamed Star Wars.
   After some initial skepticism, he fought tirelessly for approval
earlier this year of the U.S.-Soviet arms-limitation treaty and _
to the surprise of some conservatives _ opposed most of a dozen
conservative challenges to the pact.
   Quayle fought just as consistently against another top
initiative of 1988: a Democratic-sponsored bill requiring that
large companies give workers at least 60 days' notice before a
shutdown. He voted for every effort to water down the bill.
   He voted for aid to the anti-government rebels in Nicaragua; for
a constitutional amendment allowing organized prayer in schools;
against abortion; against gun control and for capital punishment.
   Although he endorsed extension of the Voting Rights Act, he
fought restoration of some civil-rights protections that had been
nullified by a Supreme Court decision.
   Breaking with the White House, he voted to override Reagan's
vetoes of economic sanctions against South Africa and of a bill
authorizing $18 billion in clean-water projects. Last year he voted
for an $88 billion highway-mass-transit bill but would not vote to
override Reagan's veto of that measure.
   Here are some other stands taken by Quayle:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   _Against a bill elevating the Veterans Administration to the
president's Cabinet. (On the campaign trail last week, he said that
vote was the result of youthful indiscretion and said he now
supports the proposal.)
   _For overhaul of the welfare system.
   _Against paying reparations to Japanese-Americans interned
during World War II. He voted for the bill after efforts to
eliminate reparations failed.
   _Proposed, at the urging of management of the Indianapolis
Indians, an amendment to overturn a Labor Department ruling that
child-labor laws prohibit youths under 16 from serving as batboy or
batgirl for professional baseball teams at night games.
   _Offered an amendment to exempt foreign professional athletes
from a law under which the United States taxes the full worldwide
income of any alien who is in this country at least 180 days a
year. Quayle, an avid golfer, said the law discourages such
athletes from playing in U.S. charity tournaments.
   _Sought to allow college football coaches to qualify for
pensions through their association, rather than through a college.
   _For requiring regulation of the manufacture of armor-piercing
bullets.
   _Against allowing Jewish soldiers to wear a yarmulke while in
uniform.
   _For limiting the president to one six-year term.
   _Against restricting private employers' use of lie detectors to
examine employees.
   _Against a presumption that any disability suffered by a veteran
who took part in atmospheric nuclear tests or in the atomic bombing
of Japan was service-connected.
   _Against extending the amnesty period for aliens to apply for
legalization.
   _Against expanding Medicare to cover certain catastrophic
medical costs, a measure signed into law with much fanfare by
Reagan. Quayle's was one of only 11 votes against it.
   _For prohibiting distribution of contraceptives to unmarried
minors without parental consent.
   _Against cutting money for child nutrition.
   _For allowing religious colleges in the District of Columbia to
deny certain benefits to homosexual groups.
   _Against requiring the labeling of imported food products.
   _Against a resolution stating it would not be in the interest of
U.S. security to prosecute Lt. Col. Oliver North.
   _For sharp reductions in appropriations for administering legal
services for the poor.
   _Against banning possession of a firearm that is not detectable
by airport security machines.
   _Against requiring the president to notify Congress within 48
hours when a covert operation is under way (compared with 10 days
under current law).
   _For allowing one branch of a private educational institute to
discriminate even through another branch is receiving federal funds.
   _Against requiring small businesses to make structural changes
in their buildings to accommodate the handicapped.
   _For creating a federal holiday in memory of Martin Luther King
Jr.

   Twenty-seven times this year Sen. Lloyd
Bentsen has voted against the majority of his Democratic colleagues
in the Senate on a variety of issues, including Star Wars, abortion
and immigration policy, and some of his votes put him at odds with
his running mate, Michael Dukakis.
   When 77 percent of Senate Democrats voted on Feb. 4 against
granting $60 million to rebels fighting the Nicaraguan government,
Bentsen was on the opposite side. On July 13, 75 percent of
Democrats voted against allowing oil drilling in parts of the
eastern Gulf of Mexico, but Bentsen voted for it.
   Those votes were an exception for the Texas senator, who now is
his party's nominee for vice president.
   During 17{ years in the Senate he has usually been found in the
middle of the pack. Of 212 substantive votes Bentsen has cast this
year, 185, or 87 percent, sided with the majority of Democrats.
   In 1987, Bentsen voted on 408 roll calls, and 90 percent of the
time _ on 365 votes _ he sided with most other Democrats.
   Averaging his annual ratings by the Americans for Democratic
Actas,'' Bentsen has
said, referring to the leftist government in Nicaragua.
   Dukakis favors federal financing of abortions. Bentsen calls the
issue one of the toughest for him but generally supports federal
money only in the case of rape or incest or when the mother's life
would be endangered by carrying a baby to term.
   On the basic question of abortion, Bentsen says, ``It's a
woman's right to make that decision after consulting her physician,
hopefully her pastor or priest.''
   Dukakis apparently is unequivocally opposed to capital
punishment. Bentsen has voted for it, most recently on May 16, when
the Senate approved the death penalty for certain drug-related
murders. More than half the Democrats opposed that bill.
   Dukakis favors handgun control; Bentsen is on the other side. On
the most recent vote on the issue, in 1987, Bentsen opposed an
amendment prohibiting firearms that cannot be detected by airport
security devices. Seventy-four percent of Democratic senators voted
for the amendment.
   Dukakis and Bentsen appear unconcerned about their differences.
``I didn't pick Lloyd Bentsen to be a clone of Michael Dukakis,''
the presidential nominee explained. ``We agree on most things but
we disagree on some.''
   Bentsen was in the minority on April 20 when the Senate, on a
61-35 vote, killed an amendment that would have required a balanced
federal budget before any financial reparations could be paid to
Japanese-Americans interned during World War II. Only eight other
Democrats were with Bentsen on that vote.
   Bentsen later voted for the reparations bill, which passed 69-27.
   More than two-thirds of Democrats favored a six-month extension
of the amnesty period during which illegal immigrants could apply
for legalization. But Bentsen voted with most Republicans and the
extension failed, 56-40.
   Bentsen, whose state's energy industry is in deep trouble, voted
July 13 to allow the Interior Department to approve drilling on
existing leases in the eastern Gulf of Mexico. The amendment failed
59-37, with 75 percent of Democrats voting no.
   On 150 of the 212 substantive votes this year, Bentsen voted on
the same side as Majority Leader Robert C. Byrd of West Virginia
and liberal Sen. Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts. On 17
occasions, Bentsen was aligned against the two; he was allied with
Byrd against Kennedy on 23 votes; on eight he sided with Kennedy
against Byrd.
   Bentsen has consistently been among a minority of Democrats on
key defense issues; he has been considerably more hawkish.
   On the 27 votes this year in which Bentsen was opposed by most
members of his party, six were on major defense questions,
including the MX mobile missile, the Strategic Defense Initiative
(he opposed cuts in both; Dukakis opposes SDI, also known as Star
Wars), and on requiring the mothballing of two aging aircraft
carriers when their replacements are commissioned (he opposed it).
   Some other key Bentsen votes this year:
   _Down the line against conservative efforts to modify the
U.S.-Soviet INF arms treaty.
   _For the Grove City civil rights restoration bill and most
attempts to weaken it. Against most Democrats, he supported
amendments involving abortion and schools controlled by religious
organizations.
   _For a bill generally prohibiting employers from using lie
detectors on employees.
   _For legislation prohibiting a president from withholding
details of covert operations from Congress.
   _Against a resolution disapproving a U.S.-Japanese agreement on
peaceful uses of nuclear energy.
   _For three major bills that he, as chairman of the Finance
Committee, shepherded through the Senate: Welfare overhaul,
Medicare benefits for some expenses of catastrophic illness (with a
tax increase on the elderly to pay for them) and a sweeping trade
bill.
   _For an amendment requiring that government AIDS-related
literature emphasize abstinence from illegal drug use and from sex
outside a monogamous marriage.
   _Against stripping federal courts of authority in cases
involving disputes about school prayer.
   _For requiring that lucrative ``golden parachute'' benefits for
corporate executives be subject to stockholder approval.
   _Against requiring written parental consent before government
clinics may provide contraceptives to minors.
   _For creating a Department of Veterans Affairs in the Cabinet.

<HEAD>Ad Agency Stocks Sidelined This Olympic Year</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SKIP WOLLENBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Politicians and Olympic sponsors usually try for
the limelight with advertising every four years, but their efforts
this year have failed to make ad company stocks stars on Wall
Street.
   Industry analysts estimate that the major advertising stocks as
a group have underperformed the broader market by about 10 percent
this year.
   They say the outlook for the group remains tied closely to the
performance of the economy next year.
   ``The industry has gone through three tough years,'' said Alan
Gottesman, who follows the ad business for the investment firm
PaineWebber.
   But he said the rigors of industry consolidation and
cost-cutting may have put the group in a position to benefit from
whatever surprises may lie ahead.
   Over the past two years, consolidation created some huge ad
holding companies _ Omnicom Group Inc., WPP Group PLC and a bigger
Saatchi & Saatchi PLC. The publicly-held ad companies also include
Interpublic Group of Companies Inc., Ogilvy Group and Foote, Cone &
Belding Communications Inc.
   Simultaneously, agencies were laying off workers and taking
other cost-cutting steps. Gottesman estimates ad industry
employment is down 3 percent to 5 percent from a year ago.
   The belt-tightening came in time for the industry to reap
earnings benefits from ad spending growth expected due to the
elections and the Olympic Games.
   But the anticipated spurt has largely failed to materialize.
   In June, the industry guru Robert J. Coen of the ad agency
McCann-Erickson scaled back his estimate of U.S. ad spending growth
for the year to 8.4 percent, down from the 9 percent gain he had
forecast six months earlier.
   Some other ad industry analysts expect even slower growth.
   James Dougherty, who follows advertising stocks for County
Securities, said ``the quadrennial year is turning out to be a big
zero.'' He expects an increase excluding direct mail spending of 5
percent to 6 percent this year.
   Dougherty said the economy is at a different stage in the
business cycle than it was when ad spending climbed at double-digit
rates in 1976 and 1984.
   ``The economic news this year hasn't been bad, but it hasn't
been as good as it was in those years at the beginning of a big
expansion,'' he said.
   Charles Crane, who follows the ad business for Prudential-Bache
Securities, said U.S. ad spending should rise about 7 percent this
year.
   He said spending didn't get its normal quadrennial lift because
consumer spending increases have been anemic. That hurt ad stocks,
he said, because ``the market has been shying away from consumer
cyclical stocks this year.''
   Looking ahead, Coen expects ad spending will grow 7.5 percent in
1989, while Dougherty and Crane expect growth roughly matching this
year's pace.
   Dougherty noted that commercial time is sold out on the summer
Olympics broadcasts, and that advance sales of time on the three
major television networks for the fall exceeded last year's strong
totals.
   But even so, he said ``I don't have anybody telling me clients
are increasing their budgets.''
   Crane said a pickup may occur in consumer spending as the trauma
of last fall's stock market crash recedes, and said that would make
the case ``for 1989 not being a bad year at all.''
   As a result he finds the ad stocks ``attractive, with the caveat
that I don't expect a recession before 1990.''
   In their search for new ways to generate revenue, some of the
major ad agencies have been buying marketing services firms that
offer the consulting, promotion and design work that ad companies
once spurned.
   Dougherty said the results from this shopping spree have been
mixed.
   Crane said a gradual movement by major advertisers away from the
flat-fee system of compensating ad agencies could be a boon to
well-managed agencies.
   Under some new methods, agencies are taking lower base rates but
get incentive payments if their advertising works, boosting sales
or market share.
   Gottesman said the recent pace of new product introductions
indicates that consumer products companies are taking risks and
becoming more agressive. That could be a plus for ad companies
because new product rollouts usually mean more advertising.
   He is not pushing the group, but feels good about it.
   ``If there are no surprises, the ad stocks go sideways,''
Gottesman said. ``But if we see some surprises, the surprises will
likely be on the good side and the stocks are going to go up.''

   Ever alert for investment opportunities, many
Americans have been burned in recent years by unscrupulous
operators promoting overpriced art and collectors coins, the
Federal Trade Commission warns.
   While both rare coins and art can prove good investments,
avoiding mistakes requires either considerable knowledge or
reliance on a trustworthy adviser.
   Perhaps the most important thing to avoid is allowing oneself to
be pressured into a quick decision, especially by a telephone
salesperson, the FTC says.
   And do not give out credit card numbers or bank account numbers
to anyone calling you.
   Often salespeople will claim you have won some sort of contest
and the numbers are needed for ``verification.'' Don't fall for it,
the FTC warns, you risk big losses by giving out such numbers to
unfamiliar callers.
   Salespeople often try to snow buyers with tales of big increases
in the value of prints or coins.
   In the case of art they will sometimes ghoulishly claim the
artist is seriously ill and that, when he dies, the price will
skyrocket.
   But the technology for reproducing pictures is excellent today,
so that what is claimed to be a limited edition print worth $500 to
$3,500 can in fact turn out to be a good quality reproduction,
worth $50 at best.
   ``Therefore, it is very important to consult a reputable local
authority on the subject, such as an art appraiser or museum
curator, before purchasing any work of art,'' the FTC says in a new
consumer fact sheet on art fraud.
   Copies of the alert, as well as FTC investor alerts on Rare
Coins, Telephone Investment Fraud and Telemarketing Travel Fraud
can be obtained, at no charge, by writing: Public Reference,
Federal Trade Commission, Washington, D.C., 20580.
   The FTC urges consumers to be skeptical of claims of
authenticity for coins and art, noting that crooks often print up
fraudulent certificates or authenticity for art or fake coin
grading certificates. They sometimer refer buyers to ``experts''
who are actually paid by them, and may promise refunds which they
later refuse to make good on.
   It can help to check out sellers with the local Better Business
Bureau, consumer office or state attorney general's office. But
remember, it isn't unusual for a company to change its name
periodically to avoid being identified with past complaints.
   Whatever the situation, don't be rushed, the FTC urges, no offer
is so good that it cannot wait for a cool, professional examination.
   ``Ask yourself: if this offer is so good, why is a total
stranger making the effort to sell me this investment?'' the agency
suggests.
   In the case of rare coins, the FTC suggests checking with
professional organizations to see if the dealer is a member in good
standing before sending any money. These groups include the
American Numismatic Association in Colorado Springs, Colo; Industry
Council for Tangible Assets, Washington, D.C.; and Professional
Numismatists Guild in Van Nuys, Calif.

<HEAD>Dan Quayle: From Idyllic Hoosier Childhood To Rock-Ribbed
Republican</HEAD>
<NOTE>With LaserPhoto</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By SHARON COHEN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>HUNTINGTON, Ind. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Dan Quayle, born into a world of Indiana
privilege and conservative causes, preached the gospel of
rock-ribbed Republicanism long before he ever walked the corridors
of Congress or became George Bush's running mate.
   ``Politics comes naturally to the family,'' said Ernest
Williams, retired editor of the nearby Fort Wayne News Sentinel.
``Dan represents the fulfillment of a family dream.''
   In his road to the Republican ticket, Quayle never wavered in
his personal or political leanings: the popular fraternity boy
became an amiable candidate, the teen who learned golf made the
game his passion, the youth who displayed a Barry Goldwater sticker
on his car in the '60s proudly voted for the tenets of the Reagan
revolution from his back bench in the Senate.
   Back at DePauw University in the late 1960s, ``He was basically
a little political commentator,'' recalls Delta Kappa Epsilon
fraternity brother John Socolofsky. ``I think you genuinely could
see something light up there. There was definitely a spark.''
   ``He was really well versed,'' he added. ``It was obvious that
was the fabric of the family.''
   However, not everyone saw him quite that way. Quayle was
``undistinguished'' and ``mediocre,'' said Michael Lawrence, a
former DePauw professor who taught Quayle constitutional law. ``He
didn't work very hard. He was not very bright. He didn't get much
done.''
   Asked about Quayle being chosen for the No. 2 spot on the GOP
ticket, Lawrence said: ``It confirms what I was told when I was a
little kid, that anybody can grow up to be president.''
   In the days since Quayle was anointed by George Bush, the fabric
of his family has turned into political drama as Quayle struggled
to vindicate himself amid a torrent of controversy about his
lackluster academic career, his personal life and most of all, his
National Guard service during the Vietnam War _ and whether he used
family clout to secure bullet-free duty.
   In a matter of days, James Danforth Quayle, 41, the first baby
boomer on a national ticket, has catapulted from relative obscurity
to the withering glare of the limelight, a man on the hot seat, a
second-term senator vying to be a heartbeat away from the
presidency.
   ``From a guy who could walk down the street unrecognized, bang,
he's suddenly put in the spotlight,'' law school friend and federal
appeals Judge Dan Manion said this week. ``He was unprepared and
that's probably not a very good way to put a vice president in.''
   If this is a test of Quayle's mettle, he'll pass with flying
colors, his friends believe.
   ``From everything I have seen, he's demonstrating very definite
resilience,'' said Gerald Warren, Quayle's former economics
professor at DePauw. ``He'll survive very well.''
   Quayle surely inherited his fervor for conservative politics
from his grandfather, Eugene C. Pulliam, a media mogul who founded
a multi-million-dollar newspaper empire that includes the Arizona
Republic, Phoenix Gazette, Indianapolis Star and Indianapolis News.
   The Quayle family owns the Huntington (Ind.) Herald-Press.
Quayle's father, James, is publisher; the senator, who worked as a
young associate publisher before entering politics, is vice
president. The circulation of the paper is less than 9,000.
   Quayle spent his childhood in Indiana and Arizona, moving west
with his family as a small boy in the mid '50s when his father
helped run the Pulliam newspapers. They returned to Huntington in
1963 when Dan was a high school junior.
   For Quayle, life in this rural northeast Indiana town was filled
with penny-ante poker games with his buddies, dancing to juke box
tunes at the now-defunct Swing Inn, part of the YMCA, and cruising
down Jefferson Street, stopping at the A&W Root Beer stand and the
Penguin Point drive-in.
   ``He had a regular kid existence,'' said high school pal Taylor
Cope, now a Chicago area cardiologist. ``It's been said he was a
rich kid, but that never showed when he was a teen. He didn't have
his own car.'' He borrowed his mother's.
   As a senior in college, he was a big man on campus _ and drove a
beat-up International Scout.
   Already, his political philosophy was forming. ``He was very,
very conservative at the time. He was pro Goldwater,'' Cope
recalled. ``He was pro-war because the president was pro-war. ''
   Carla Rice, who dated Quayle in high school, told a reporter
Quayle had a bumper sticker on his car with the chemical symbols
for gold and water. ``And he said in this big voice, `And that is
the next president of the United States.'''
   The conservative sentiment, light years away from the angry
chants and window-smashing rampages of the anti-Vietnam protests,
also prevailed at DePauw, a small, upper middle-class liberal arts
college in Greencastle, where Quayle majored in political science.
   ``It was not a very controversial social environment,'' said
Socolofsky. ``The war wasn't even debated in classrooms there.''
   Michael Miller, economist with the U.S. Bureau of Labor
Statistics and a former fraternity brother, was a freshman when
Quayle was a pledge trainer.
   ``I remember the night Richard Nixon was elected in 1968. Dan
had a party in his room. There were a couple of TVs going. The only
thing I can remember he (Quayle) was at the convention _ he was an
usher to the stage _ he really got a big kick out of that.
   ``The Democrats were studying somewhere, I suppose.''

   Following his father's and grandfather's footsteps, Quayle
joined Delta Kappa Epsilon _ also Bush's fraternity at Yale _ and
became vice president at the so-called campus ``animal house.''
   ``We were the beer generation,'' Socolofsky added. ``We really
enjoyed getting a keg of beer, putting some music on and having
dates.'' Whatever the trend on other campuses, Quayle has said he
never used or even experimented with marijuana.
   Quayle was popular, making friends easily. He also was a premier
golfer. But his academic record was less impressive. Quayle says he
was the ``proverbial C-plus'' student, but he flunked a
comprehensive political exam he needed to graduate. He later took a
different test and passed.
   Ted Katula, DePauw's athletic director and former golf coach,
says Quayle ``was a very tough competitor. I liked his confidence.
It gave me confidence. ... He's very aggressive. ... I'd like to
have six Dan Quayles playing for me.''
   Quayle's none-too-stellar academic career later became a touchy
topic when DePauw faculty members rejected a proposal to award the
senator an honorary law degree. They later reversed themselves
after the university president appealed.
   After college, Quayle entered the National Guard at the height
of the war. Wendell Phillippi, a former Indianapolis News editor
and a family friend, said he recommended Quayle to a top Guard
official, who asked the guard personnel office to put a slot ``on
hold'' for him. He was brought aboard as a welder before being
shifted to a public relations post.
   Questions about whether the hawkish Quayle pulled strings to
avoid the front lines have dogged the senator, who at week's end
refused to answer any more questions about it. ``I was not seeking
special treatment,'' he said. ``No rules were broken.''
   James Quayle also denied suggestions this week that clout got
his son into Indiana University School of Law when his grades
couldn't. His father told a reporter that ``Danny's (a) pretty good
salesman,'' who talked his way into law school, arguing DePauw was
tougher than other schools.
   In law school, Quayle met his wife, Marilyn, another law
student. They wed after a 10-week courtship and have three children.
   Associates say the Quayles live a middle-class existence in
suburban northern Virginia, with Marilyn cutting and styling her
husband's hair, and both sharing parental duties, such as
babysitting.
   Starting out in Indiana, Quayle worked as investigator for the
state attorney general's office, administrative assistant to the
governor and at the Huntington paper before a GOP official, Orvas
Beers, approached him to challenge Democratic eight-term Rep. Ed
Roush in 1976.
   He is ``a real charmer,'' Beers says now. ```I thought he'd get
a lot of the women's vote because of his friendliness, his
personality and his good looks.''
   Beers said Quayle took to politics naturally. ``Only one time
did I ever have to suggest anything. Danny was standing talking to
a group of people (when he was running for the first time). I said,
`Danny, get yourself out and shaking hands. He didn't argue a bit.
And he didn't stop shaking hands the rest of the campaign.''
   Quayle's former press secretary, Larry Smith, said the
blue-eyed, blond senator bristles at talk about his looks and
comparisons to matinee idol Robert Redford. ``He wanted to be taken
seriously. He wanted to be taken as a professional trying to do a
job,'' said Smith, news director of WHAS-TV in Louisville, Ky.
   One day a trade group from Indiana visited Quayle's office, and
as is custom, they were asked if they wanted a photo taken with the
senator. One woman in particular ``was thrilled,'' Smith recalls.
``She made a compliment about his beautiful blue eyes. He was very
embarrassed. He tried to lighten the moment. He said, `Larry's got
blue eyes.'''
   Quayle served two terms in the House before defeating three-term
Sen. Birch Bayh in the 1980 Reagan landslide. ``Taking on Bayh, it
gives you an idea about his competitiveness,'' Katula said. ``He's
not afraid to take a chance.''
   Quayle easily won re-election in 1986 and is known as an expert
on defense issues and an ardent supporter of Reagan's Star Wars
anti-missile shield. He also led the administration fight against
providing advance notice of plant closings and wrote the Job
Training Partnership Act, a nationwide employment program.
   Earlier in his career, Quayle was on the fringes of a scandal
that resurfaced with his nomination to the Bush ticket. In 1981, an
insurance industry lobbyist, Paula Parkinson, said she had had a
relationship with a Delaware congressman and shared a vacation
house in Florida a year earlier with him and two other House
members, one of whom was Quayle.
   Playboy magazine, for whom Parkinson subsequently posed,
reported this week that she will say in an upcoming issue that
Quayle propositioned her and she refused. Quayle has angrily denied
the accusation and said he was there on a golfing outing.
   Smith says of his ex-boss: ``I never saw Dan Quayle give a
second look to any woman. He was as straight an arrow you'd ever
want to meet.''
   Smith said Quayle has a hard time keeping on schedule. He said
one day they were running from one meeting to another and they were
trying to get to an airport. ``We passed a driving range and I'm
watching the clock.''
   Quayle made them stop. ``Dan picked up a can of balls and he
fired off a few,'' said Smith, while they anxiously waited. ``That
was his release and his relaxation.'' They made it to the airport.
   Friends say that although they're a little surprised at Quayle's
fast climb up the political ladder, he's used his assets well.
   ``What he's done shows he had some talent and organization and
friends in the right places,'' Cope says. ``His success speaks well
for himself.''

   Government figures indicate the economy,
shaking off the drag caused by the drought, grew at the
surprisingly brisk annual pace of 3.3 percent in the second
quarter, while inflation hit a six-year peak of 5.1 percent.
   The Commerce Department said Thursday the gain in the gross
national product would have soared beyond the 3.3 percent clip had
it not been for a larger-than-expected $9.5 billion loss in farm
production. Without the drought impact, GNP growth from April
through June would have hit a 4.3 percent annual pace, it said.

   The Reagan administration estimated the budget
deficit in the upcoming fiscal year would be low enough to avoid
politically painful, automatic spending cuts under the Gramm-Rudman
balanced budget law.
   But the White House budget chief also warned Thursday that
Congress had little room to enact new spending programs before the
slashes, totaling at least $10 billion, would have to be invoked.
   The Office of Management and Budget said that based on programs
enacted through Aug. 15, the fiscal 1989 deficit would be $144
billion _ $2 billion below the $146 billion level at which
across-the-board cuts would be required.

<HEAD>Oil Prices Down Sharply In Volatile Market</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Oil futures prices finished sharply lower in
volatile trading, as the market hit a bearish downturn after
reports of higher OPEC production.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, contracts for October
delivery of West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark grade of U.S.
crude oil, fell 37 cents a barrel to close at $15.31 Thursday.
October crude closed 2 cents lower in Wednesday's trading.
   Contracts for September delivery of wholesale unleaded gasoline
dropped 1.07 cents to finish at 46.44 cents a gallon. Most other
contract months for gasoline also declined. Wholesale heating oil
for September fell 1.30 cents to 42.45 cents a gallon.
   Analysts said the October contract for crude oil tumbled below a
critical technical level of $15.50 a barrel on reports that
production by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries had
surged anew.
   ``Reports that OPEC production has reached 19.5 million to 20
million barrels a day caused a sharp decline in the market today,''
said Chris McCormack, an analyst with Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.
``The market also broke a key technical level.''
   Analysts said that once the market hit $15.50 a barrel, negative
sentiment took over, sending prices even lower.
   The oil futures market has been largely inactive in recent
weeks, without much fresh news on supply and demand to guide it.
Analysts said Thursday's reports provided the first sign of
direction in some time, and speculated that prices could weaken
further as the increased oil outflow reaches consuming nations.
   ``It looks like we're about to start a move to the down side,''
McCormack said.
   Last week, the market focused on developments in the Middle East
and a tentative cease-fire between Iran and Iraq. Analysts have
speculated that an end to the fighting between the two OPEC nations
could mean the fractious 13-member oil cartel would set production
limits, thus helping to raise world oil prices.
   But on Thursday, analysts said the market reacted to rumors that
Iran had refused to go along with a quota proposed by other OPEC
members.

<HEAD>Boeing Sets Industry Record For Single-Year Commercial Jet Orders</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE TIBBITS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Strong world economies, attractive airline fares
and a movement by airlines to more fuel-efficient aircraft have
helped Boeing Co. break its own 10-year-old record for commercial
jets ordered in a year, the company says.
   Boeing announced Thursday that an Linjeflyg, a domestic Swedish
airline, had ordered six 737-500 jetliners and took options on six
more, giving Boeing 466 jetliner orders for the year.
   That broke the old record of 461 planes Boeing set in 1978.
   The order, worth more than $175 million, boosted the dollar
value of Boeing's announced 1988 orders to $20.7 billion. Boeing
several weeks ago surpassed the record of $19.9 billion in new
orders set last year.
   ``This represents four consecutive years of record orders for
Boeing,'' John Hayhurst, vice president of marketing for Boeing
Commercial Airplanes told a news conference.
   ``This has been a very good year,'' added Chris Longridge, vice
president of sales for the Boeing operating company. ``Next year,
we're forecasting to have a reasonable year, perhaps not as good as
this one.''
   Still, Hayhurst said Boeing is predicting that over the next two
decades, the world's airlines will need almost as many new planes
as the 8,171 now in service, and Boeing should continue to provide
the largest share.
   Boeing this year picked up a number of large orders, including
15 747-400 jumbo jets by Japan Air Lines, 50 757s by American
Airlines, 30 757s by United Airlines, and the biggest commercial
jetliner order ever, a $4.6 billion deal with International Lease
Finance Corp. for 100 aircraft.
   In addition, both GPA Rolls Ltd., of Shannon, Ireland, and Delta
Air Lines of Atlanta have said they may be interested in ordering
large numbers of Boeing planes, possibly this year.
   ``With the possible order of up to 50 757s pending with GPA
Rolls, a Delta order and another possible 75 jets which could be
used in the Navy's long-range anti-submarine warfare patrol
aircraft program, Boeing could keep going like gangbusters,'' said
Paul Nisbet, an aerospace analyst with Prudential-Bache Securities
in New York.
   Hayhurst said Boeing has benefited from strong world economies
that permit people to travel. Airline fares also are attractive, he
said, particularly in the United States.
   Further, airlines are starting to turn to more fuel-efficient
and economical aircraft, including new Boeing planes that Hayhurst
said are significantly cheaper to operate and far quieter than
earlier jets.
   Hayhurst said Boeing predicts that air traffic growth will
continue at about 5 percent a year through 2005.
   ``All of this means a significant amount of traffic growth in
the next 17 years,'' he said. ``In fact, in the year 2005, that 5
percent traffic will mean that the traffic growth will be about 2{
times what it is today. And we forseee a requirement for about
7,400 airplanes, new airplanes, in that delivery timeframe.''
   Longridge said Boeing now has backlog of 1,036 jets, the
industry's highest, which translates to years of work on its
commercial production lines.
   Presently, Boeing is turning out 14 737s and four 757s a month
at its Renton, Wash., plant, with 757 production to increase to
five a month next February, Longridge said. The company is making
five widebody 767s and three 747s a month at its Everett, Wash.,
plant, but plans to boost that rate to five jumbo jets a month by
mid-1989, he said.
   He declined to say whether these plans mean additional hiring at
Boeing, which now employs about 92,000 people in the Puget Sound
region.
   Stockholm-based Linjeflyg, a new customer for Boeing, will take
delivery of the first of the 108-passenger 737-500s in February
1991. The new jets will be powered by CFM56-3B1 engines.
   Boeing's stock closed down 12{ cents a share Thursday, at
$58.62{, after rising $2.12{ a share Wednesday.

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar held steady against major currencies in
calm European trading today as the market reassessed trends
following a round of interest rate hikes. Gold prices rose.
   Foreign exchange dealers said the dollar was weaker in early
trading in Frankfurt but was recovering later in European markets
after short-covering and profit-taking on long non-dollar positions.
   On Thursday the U.S. currency fell after the West German central
bank raised its discount rate by half a point to 3.5 percent.
France, Switzerland, the Netherlands and Austria also hiked their
key rates.
   It was also pushed lower after Deutsche Bundesbank President
Karl Otto Poehl said the West German central bank ``will continue
to do everything to stem the decline of the Deutsche mark against
the dollar.''
   One trader said Friday that the market was taking a breather
following the activity caused by interest rate increases.
   In Tokyo, where the business day ends before Europe's begins,
the dollar fell 0.26 yen to a closing 133.50 yen. Later, in London,
it was quoted at 133.75 yen.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning, compared with late Thursday's
rates, included: 1.8630 West German marks, unchanged from Thursday;
1.5730 Swiss francs, up from 1.5715; 6.3332 French francs, up from
6.3275; 2.1042 Dutch guilders, up from 2.1030; 1,385.75 Italian
lire, up from 1,384.13; and 1.2365 Canadian dollars, up from 1.2342.
   In London, the British pound was trading at $1.6950, cheaper for
buyers than Thursday's late $1.6995.
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $433.40 a troy ounce. At
midmorning, the City's five major bullion dealers fixed a
recommended price of $433.75, up from Thursday's late bid of
$433.50.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $433.80, up from $433.50 bid late
Thursday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold dropped 86 cents to close at a bid
$435.24.
   Silver was quoted in London today at a bid price of $6.72 a troy
ounce, down from $6.77 at Thursday's close.

   Europe's decision to raise key interest rates
resulted in a plunge in share prices and the U.S. dollar on Tokyo
markets Friday.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues, which lost
321.47 points during the morning session, stayed almost even in the
afternoon to finish the day at 27,565.41. The market shed 305.03
points, or 1.09 percent, which is the biggest one-day decline since
Aug. 10, when it lost 615.49 points.
   ``The decision to raise key interest rates in Europe shocked
many investors and froze them,'' said a stock dealer at a major
securities firm in Tokyo.
   ``We've already had enough unfavorable external factors one
after another,'' he added, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   But the market is unlikely to rebound because investors are
still waiting to see how the United States and Japan will react to
the interest rate rise in Europe, according to the dealer.
   Other dealers said the decline of New York stocks overnight and
an upward revision for the U.S. second-quarter GNP weighed on
sentiment.
   Volume traded on the first section was 450 million shares.
   The dollar, which opened at 133.58 yen, closed at 133.50 yen,
down 0.26 yen from Thursday's close of 133.76 yen. The currency
ranged between 133.35 and 133.73 yen.
   The dollar's fall was largely attributed to dollar selling in
Europe as the German Mark recovered after European countries
decided to raise their key interest rates.
   The West German Bundesbank's council meeting decided Thursday to
raise the discount rate by 0.5 percentage point to 3.5 percent, in
a coordinated move with six other European countries including
France, Switzerland and Britain.

   Senior leader Deng Xiaoping today welcomed Prime
Minister Noboru Takeshita of Japan and said his visit to China will
lift relations between the two countries to a new level.
   The meeting in the Great Hall of the People came a day after
Takeshita announced Japan will provide $6.4 billion in credit for
Chinese development projects from 1990 to 1995.
   Takeshita held extensive talks with Premier Li Peng shortly
after his arrival on a six-day visit Thursday, and also met today
with President Yang Shangkun and Communist Party General Secretary
Zhao Ziyang.
   Deng, the guiding force in China's past decade of economic
reforms, said he was enthusastic about cooperation between the two
nations.
   ``With your visit, Sino-Japanese friendly relations will
certainly reach a new level,'' he said.
   The 84-year-old Deng, a military strategist in the 1937-45 war
against Japan, has been sharply critical of Japan in the past.
   Japanese officials said Deng spoke optimistically of the future
and avoided the controversial subjects that have marred bilateral
relations in recent years.
   Those include Japan's former trade surplus _ now reversed in
China's favor _ China's perception of a rise in Japanese militarism
and a court case which awarded a Kyoto student dormitory, claimed
by China, to Taiwan.
   The officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Deng
told Takeshita that China's economic reforms have now entered a
difficult phase and mentioned that prices are rising rapidly.
   The officials quoted Deng as saying China, now trying to end
price controls, will need five years to fully stabilize its pricing
system. Deng, according to the officials, said introducing more
foreign investment and technology would help China's economy.
   On Saturday, China and Japan expect to sign an investment
protection agreement which both sides hope will encourage Japanese
businesses to invest in China.
   In the past year, Deng has resigned from almost all his official
positions, although he still wields considerable influence in
government and party policy.
   The officials said Takeshita discussed Taiwan with Yang, the
81-year-old ceremonial head of state.
   Yang explained China's position of encouraging more contacts
with Taiwan, and said China would be interested in meeting directly
with officials of the rival Nationalist government, the officials
said.
   Takeshita, according to the officials, said Japan welcomes a
recent relaxation of China-Taiwan tensions, including a lifting of
Taiwan's ban on visits to the mainland.
   No details were immediately available on the meeting with Zhao.

<HEAD>Iowa Farmers Begin Idaho Hay Harvest</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW, Idaho (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Another 15,000 acres of Idaho grasslands
were opened to drought-plagued Iowa farmers for hay harvesting, but
organizers said more equipment was needed to take advantage of the
bonus.
   U.S. Soil Conservation Service officials said Thursday the
number of acres available for harvest in northern Idaho had been
increased to 20,000 from the original 4,500 acres.
   ``We have the manpower we need, but not all the equipment,''
said Mike Tracy, a spokesman for the Idaho Farm Bureau, which
organized the project in conjunction with the Iowa Farm Bureau.
Organizers said local farmers and implement dealers were continuing
to donate equipment for the harvest, but there was still a need for
swathers, hay balers and tractors, he said.
   Burlington Northern is donating railcars to ship the hay back to
Iowa.
   Farmers in the Colfax, Wash., area also donated more than 1,000
bales of their own hay to the Iowans.
   Midwestern farmers lost as much as 75 percent of their hay crop
to the worst drought in 50 years this summer.
   Tracy originally estimated as much as 5,000 tons of hay could be
harvested on the original 4,500 acres. It was not known how much
could be expected to be harvested on 20,000 acres.
   The 64 men, women and teen-agers arrived Tuesday after a
40-hour, 1,600-mile bus trip from south and central Iowa.
   After a hearty farm breakfast at a Grange hall Thursday, the
Iowans began harvesting the hay they hope will feed their hungry
livestock back home.
   ``They were really getting itchy to get some work done,'' Tracy
said.
   Hay mowers began cutting grass on fields near Deary, about 30
miles northeast of Moscow, on land set aside in a government
erosion-control program. The U.S. Department of Agriculture
recently released the Conservation Reserve Program land, which is
normally not farmed, for harvest by drought-afflicted farmers.
   The harvest could take as long as 10 days, but cutting and
baling must be finished by Aug. 31, a deadline set by the
Agriculture Department. Tracy said organizers have notified the
office of Sen. James McClure, R-Idaho, that they may have to ask
for an extension from Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng.
   The generosity of their agricultural colleagues and the Moscow
community was overwhelming, the Iowans said. Harvest equipment was
donated by local farmers and implement dealers.
   ``I'd be a bit leery if someone wanted to use my equipment,''
said Don Tibbals, a dairyman from Albia, Iowa.

<TEXT>
   Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis toured a
high-tech specialty steel plant with four other Northeastern
governors and then promised, if elected president, to create a
national center for steel technology to help the industry find new
markets.
   ``We can't have a growing national economy without a strong
steel industry,'' said Dukakis, who was in Pittsburgh on Thursday
for a two-day Conference of Northeastern Governors.
   Among flying sparks and penetrating heat, the governors toured
Allegheny Ludlum Corp.'s advanced technology steel plant in
Brackenridge, where computer-guided furnaces and machinery turn out
stainless steel for the nation's largest specialty steelmaker.
   Dukakis said he was pleased to learn from Allegheny Ludlum
Chairman Richard Simmons that the average worker at the plant,
which employs almost 2,800 about 20 miles north of Pittsburgh,
earns $31,000 a year.
   ``That's what Lloyd Bentsen and I mean when we talk about good
jobs at good wages,'' he said.
   Dukakis was joined at the plant by Pennsylvania Gov. Robert
Casey, Vermont Gov. Madeleine Kunin, Connecticut Gov. William A.
O'Neill and Rhode Island Gov. Edward D. DiPrete.
   Casey is chairman of this year's conference and selected the
theme _ ``Sustaining Northeast Manufacturing: A Key To Economic
Vitality.''
   The governors also toured the University of Pittsburgh's
Research Center in Harmarville, where they saw a demonstration of a
computerized machine that instantly analyzes the chemical
composition of materials.
   At the labs of Suprex Corp., a 6-year-old high-tech firm,
Dukakis pressed a hypodermic needle filled with liquid vinyl
plastic into a table-top machine, which then flashed its analysis
of the fluid onto a separate screen.
   The focus of the conference was to examine state economic
development strategies and the role they play in determining how
well manufacturers make the transition into the world marketplace.
   Today, the governors, including New Jersey Gov. Thomas Kean and
Maine Gov. John McKernan, will participate in a roundtable
discussion on manufacturing-related concerns.

<HEAD>Cocoa Prices Fall to Seven-Year Low</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The price of cocoa on the London market dropped to
its lowest level in seven years Friday.
   In morning dealings, cocoa beans for December delivery changed
hands at 831 pounds ($1,404) per metric ton, a loss of 24 pounds
($40) on last night's close and the lowest price for cocoa since
June 1981, traders said. A metric ton is equivalent to 2,204.62
pounds.
   The market's weakness reflects the prospect that 1988-89, which
runs between October and September, could be the fifth consecutive
season of overproduction, the sources added.
   Hopes are also dwindling that International Cocoa Organization
producer and consumer member countries can settle differences and
open the way for new price-support measures.
   The two sides meet here next month to discuss a possible
stockpiling scheme, but its introduction depends on agreement on
the minimum price that should be defended and payment by producers
of arrears to the organization, industry sources said.
   Crop prospects in West Africa and the Far East are said to be
better than at this time last year, when drought was causing some
concern, and another record crop is therefore in prospect for
1988-89.
   Latest figures from the International Cocoa Organization and
private traders indicate that the current 1988-87 crop will reach
an all-time high of more than 2 million metric tons.
   Many countries, including the Ivory Coast, Brazil, Malaysia and
Indonesia, are expecting record 1987-88 production figures.
   Traders said that the Ivory Coast _ the world's biggest cocoa
producer _ could harvest an even bigger crop in 1988-89 than this
season's estimated 630,000 to 645,000 tons.
   Such a prospect would increase pressure on the country's cocoa
marketing authorities to relax their present reserve selling
strategy.
   Since April, the Ivory Coast has been refusing offers under
1,300 per ton for its high-quality cocoa, Ivorian officials said.
   This has pushed up the price for best quality beans generally,
but there is a big surplus of poorer quality cocoa that is
depressing the London market, traders said.

<HEAD>U.N. Agency Warns of `Explosion' of Locusts in Africa</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ROME (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The desert locust plague in central and east Africa
will ``explode'' in the next two weeks, causing severe damage to
crops, the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization warned Friday.
   ``The extent of infestation in certain African countries is
enormous, and we are extremely concerned,'' FAO Director-General
Edouard Saouma said in a statement. ``There is no doubt that there
will be heavy damage to crops in the middle of the agricultural
season.''
   Dr. Lukas Brader, head of the agency's emergency center for
locust operations, said that 6 to 7 million hectares (14 to 17
million acres) of land in Chad, Sudan and Niger are currently
infested with dense bands of locust larvae.
   ``They are going to explode in the next two weeks and form
massive swarms which will affect large areas of agricultural
lands,'' he said, adding that the size of each swarm could cover
hundreds of square kilometers.
   ``The plague has reached unprecedented proportions and cannot be
controlled in the near future,'' Brader said.
   Heavy rains, particulary in Sudan, have created favorable
breeding conditions for the locusts. While the situation has been
serious for several weeks in Chad and Sudan, the problem has
sharply worsened recently in Niger with some 1.7 million hectares
(4.2 million acres) infested, FAO said.
   FAO said it has convened a meeting of affected and interested
countries in Rome next week.

<HEAD>States Investigating Food Companies' Advertising</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CINCINNATI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Eight states want to find out whether claims
made by dozens of food companies in advertising are misleading.
   Authorities in Minnesota, California, Massachusetts, New York,
Missouri, Texas, Iowa and Wisconsin are examining advertising that
could lead consumers to believe that some products are low in such
substances as cholesterol, sugars and fats, officials said.
   The states have been cooperating in a summerlong investigation,
Norine Olson-Elm, a Minnesota special assistant attorney general,
said Thursday.
   ``We are not challenging ingredients,'' Ms. Olson-Elm said from
her St. Paul, Minn., office. ``We are concerned about advertising
and labeling, how products are marketed and promoted to the
public.''
   The states have not decided how to proceed if they find evidence
of false or deceptive advertising, but they ultimately could sue
the companies, the attorney said.
   Fines would range from $2,500 in California to $25,000 in
Minnesota for each violation, she said.
   The states started the investigation because the claims in some
of the advertising were not covered by federal law, Ms. Olson-Elm
said.
   ``Consumers interpret light to mean low in calories rather than
light in color and texture,'' Ms. Olson-Elm said. ``Light is not
defined by federal law. Consumers have no clear perception other
than it is a reduction.''
   Five companies known to be under scrutiny are Procter & Gamble
Co., of Cincinnati; Kitchens of Sara Lee, Deerfield, Ill.; Nabisco
Brands, Inc., East Hanover, N.J.; Campbell Soup Co., Camden, N.J.;
and Louis Rich Co., Madison, Wis, the newspaper said. Such diverse
products as soup, cereal, cheesecake and meats are involved.
   Procter & Gamble has been asked to provide information
substantiating its claims that its all-vegetable Crisco shortening
contains no cholesterol.
   Spokesmen for the companies said they stand behind the
advertising.
   The investigation covers television, radio and print advertising
regarding nutrition and such ailments as heart problems, cancer and
osteoporosis.
   Companies have been asked to provide samples of advertising, Ms.
Olson-Elm said.
   ``We have set different deadlines for each company,'' she said.
``There is no one target date.''
   One concern of the states is the use of palm oil, which Ms.
Olson-Elm said is higher in saturated fat than many other oils.
   Although soybean oil is the primary ingredient in P&G's Crisco
shortening _ advertised as being cholesterol-free _ it contains
some palm oil.
   ``Studies indicate that saturated fats in palm oil will increase
cholesterol, and therefore we are concerned about palm oil being
included in products that are otherwise lower in saturated fats,''
Ms. Olson-Elm said.
   Cholesterol is a fatty substance in the blood that clogs
arteries, often contributing to heart attacks.
   Palm oil is added to Crisco to give it texture at room
temperature, Procter & Gamble spokesman Don Tassone said.
   The saturated fat content of palm oil is 40 percent. But because
of the relatively small amount of it in Crisco, the overall level
of saturated fats in Crisco is 28 percent, Tassone said. He said
palm oil, as a vegetable oil, does not contain cholesterol.

<HEAD>Toyota's Annual Earnings Up 18.9 Percent</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Toyota Motor Corp. reported that its profit after
taxes surged 18.9 percent in its latest fiscal year from the year
before.
   Japan's largest automaker said in an annual report released
Friday that its profit rose to 238.01 billion Japanese yen, or
around $1.78 billion, in the fiscal year ended June 30 from 200.21
billion yen, or $1.50 billion, in the previous year.
   Sales for the year increased 11.1 percent _ to 6.691 trillion
yen, or around $50.04 billion, from 6.025 trillion yen, or $45.06
billion.
   Toyota's total car production for the year was 2,904,071, up 9.9
percent, while truck and bus output edged up 0.6 percent to 950,621.
   The automaker sold 3,831,454 vehicles in its fiscal 1988,
including 2,924,760 cars. The sales included exports of 1,237,867
cars.
   After posting a record profit of 648 billion yen for the fiscal
year ended June 30, 1985, Toyota sustained declines for the next
two years due to the yen's sharp rise in value against the dollar,
which made exports to the United States more expensive.
   Until 1986, Toyota had been Japan's most profitable company for
six straight years. In fiscal 1987, however, Toyota placed third
behind Nomura Securities Co. and Tokyo Electric Power Co.

<HEAD>Neiman Marcus Parent Company To Acquire Another Famous Dallas
Retailer</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A tentative agreement has been reached for the
parent of Neiman Marcus to buy Horchow Mail Order Inc., another
famous Dallas retailer, officials of Neiman Marcus Group Inc. say.
   The two companies announced Thursday they had reached a
tentative agreement for the purchase of the $100 million-plus
premier catalog sales company.
   The final terms have not been settled, officials of Neiman
Marcus Group Inc. of Chestnut Hill, Mass., a division of soft drink
and cinema conglomerate General Cinema Corp., said.
   ``The mail-order business has a lot of potential for us, and
we've said that about Neiman's mail-order business,'' said Peter
Farwell, Neiman Marcus spokesman. ``That's why we're investing in
the new distribution center in Las Colinas (near Dallas).''
   Neiman Marcus previously announced construction of a
270,000-square-foot distribution center to be opened in May 1989.
   Clay Johnson, president of Horchow, said his company's
distribution center in suburban Farmers Branch, where Horchow
orders are processed and packaged, is operating at full capacity.
Johnson declined to comment on how the company might benefit from
Neiman's additional capacity.
   Officials from both companies would not comment on how Horchow
would fit with Neiman's existing catalog operation. The Neiman
Marcus Christmas Book is expected to have a 3.2 million mailing
this year. Neiman also mails 18 other catalogs to its customers
throughout the year.
   Chairman Roger Horchow will be returning to the Neiman fold,
which he left in 1973 when he bought the mail-order business from
Kenton Corp, if the deal is completed. In his 11 years at Neiman,
Horchow had worked his way through the ranks from buyer to vice
president of the retailer's mail-order sales division.
   Horchow Mail Order, which sells luxury giftware, apparel and
other merchandise, has grown tenfold since the Dallas merchant took
over, with sales of more than $100 million.

<HEAD>Macmillan Board Rejects Maxwell Offer</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Takeover target Macmillan Inc. said Friday its
board has determined that the $2.34 billion tender offer launched
earlier this month by Maxwell Communications Corp. is inadequate.
   Maxwell has offered $80 a share for Macmillan, topping a
$75-a-share tender offer begun in July by the Robert M. Bass Group
Inc. of Fort Worth, Texas.
   The New York-based publishing and information services concern
said in a statement that it has had discussions with other parties
that have led the board to believe that ``more than $80 could be
obtained'' in the event of a sale.
   Macmillan stock consistently has traded above $80 a share
recently. In trading on the New York Stock Exchange Thursday,
Macmillan lost 12.5 cents to close at $83.25 a share.
   While Macmillan said it would continue discussions with all
interested parties, the company also noted that it might improve
the restructuring program it unveiled as a counterpoint to Bass's
bid. Bass won an injunction that prevents Macmillan from proceeding
with the restructuring, but Macmillan said it will continue to
``vigorously'' appeal the ruling.
   Bass, which already owns 9.2 percent of Macmillan, opened the
bidding in May by offering to acquire the company for $64 a share.
Shortly after the group sweetened its bid to $75 a share,
London-based Maxwell entered the fray.
   Macmillan rejected the Bass tender offer as ``inadequate'' but
until Wednesday had declined to comment on the Maxwell offer.
Macmillan has denied reports that its executives have held talks
regarding a leveraged buyout.

   The stock market was narrowly mixed today,
following a broad retreat in the previous session.
   The level of trading was very slow.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which marked the first
anniverasry of its peak of by falling 15.82 on Thursday, was up
3.91 at 2,014.76 after 30 minutes of trading today.
   But declining issues took a narrow lead over gainers among
issues listed on the New York Stock Exchange, with 359 up, 453 down
and 495 unchanged.
   Big Board volume amounted to 13.34 million shares as of 10 a.m.
on Wall Street compared with 19.69 million shares at the same point
Thursday.
   Worries that inflation may be accelerating at a pace that would
prompt the Federal Reserve to push interest rates higher have
weighed on the market.
   On Thursday, the government revised upward its earlier estimates
of both economic growth and inflation in the second quarter.
   Coupled with a round of interest rate hikes in Europe, the news
sent stock prices broadly lower.
   But most analysts expect no big moves in either direction,
however, because of the increasingly sluggish level of trading as
the Labor Day holiday approaches.
   Among the early active issues on the NYSE, Goodrich was up \ at
47{, Potomac Electric was up [ at 20\ and Wickes was unchanged at
13.
   The NYSE composite index was up 0.13 at 147.07. At the American
Stock Exchange, the market value index was up .06 at 293.27.
   On Thursday, the Dow Jones average of 30 industrials fell 15.82
to close at 2,010.85.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declines by more than 2 to 1 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
453 issues up, 998 down and 501 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the NYSE came to 127.64 million shares,

<HEAD>Scherer Proxy Vote Challenged</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Newly elected R.P. Scherer Corp. directors who
favor selling the gelatin capsule maker have asked a Delaware court
to seat them immediately.
   Theodore Souris, Frederick Frank and John S. Scherer filed suit
Thursday in the Court of Chancery in Delaware asking that they be
declared winners in a recent proxy contest.
   But Peter A. Dow, one of the apparent losing nominees, filed a
Chancery Court complaint contesting the proxy results. Dow argued
he should have been re-elected because the final tabulations
excluded about 310,000 votes meant for him.
   Dow backs Scherer management, led by chief executive officer
Peter Fink, which advocates keeping the company independent.
   Dow was defeated by Souris, who was backed by Karla Scherer
Fink, daughter of the company's late founder and Peter Fink's
estranged wife.
   Mrs. Fink and John Scherer, her brother, are both directors.
They control about 38 percent of the company.
   Despite John Scherer's re-election and the election of Souris
and Frank, management still maintains a 6-5 majority. Mrs. Fink
said she would seek support from other directors for her plan to
sell the company.
   In results announced Wednesday, Souris received 3,019,449 votes
to 2,670,876 for Dow.
   Dow claimed 75,000 shares voted by SLH Asset Management in favor
of Souris actually had been acquired by Bessemer Securities Corp.
He said Bessemer unsuccessfully requested that the shares be voted
for Dow.
   He also said 235,200 shares voted in his favor by a trustee,
Manufacturers National Bank of Detroit, should have been counted.
The votes weren't counted after Mrs. Fink, a beneficiary of the
trust, obtained a Michigan Court of Appeals ruling saying the
shares shouldn't be voted.

<HEAD>Income Up As Spending Surge Slows</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARTIN CRUTSINGER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Americans' personal incomes climbed a healthy
0.6 percent in July while consumer spending slowed from its
breakneck pace of the previous month, the government reported today.
   The Commerce Department said that the increase in incomes
matched a 0.6 percent rise in June and would have been even
stronger except for a drop in government subsidy payments to
farmers.
   Personal consumption spending, which includes virtually
everything except interest payments on debt, rose 0.5 percent in
July, less than half the 1.1 percent rise in June. The report
attributed much of the slowdown to a decline in sales of new cars.
   The slower consumer spending was seen as good news for the
economy because of worries that demand this year has been
outstripping the ability of factories to produce the goods, thus
creating rising inflationary pressures.
   The income gain looked particularly impressive because the key
component, wages and salaries, shot up 1 percent during the month,
reflecting continued strong employment gains.
   This was offset somewhat by a $9 billion rate of decline for
farm subsidy payments. Excluding these payments, which show extreme
month-to-month volatility, personal incomes would have risen 0.8
percent in July.
   Americans' disposable, or after-tax incomes, rose 0.6 percent in
July, down only slightly from a 0.7 percent June increase.
   With incomes rising slightly faster than spending, the personal
savings rate, savings as a percentage of disposable incomes, edged
up to 4.3 percent in July, compared to 4.2 percent in June.
   Following the 1.1 percent rise in spending in June, which had
been the biggest advance in 10 months, the 0.5 percent July
increase reflected gains in purchases of non-durable goods and
services.
   Non-durable goods spending rose at an annual rate of $3.5
billion compared to a $5.5 billion June increase. Purchases of
services, which includes housing costs, increased $12.2 billion
following an even stronger $18.6 billion June increase.
   But purchases of durable goods showed no change at all following
a $12 billion rise in June because sales of new cars fell during
July.

<HEAD>SEC Says Son Of Hamburger Magnate Admits Insider Trading</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The son of hamburger magnate Carl N. Karcher
admitted under oath to insider trading, saying he ordered the sale
of Carl Karcher Enterprises securities when he found out the
company was about to have a drop in earnings, according to federal
documents.
   The Securities and Exchange Commission said in recently filed
papers that Carl Leo Karcher hould be found guilty and fined
without a trial because the admissions clearly established guilt.
   U.S. District Judge Edward Rafeedie is expected to rule on the
SEC's motion for a summary judgment on Sept 12, it was disclosed
this week.
   The younger Karcher told SEC lawyers during an out-of-court
hearing in 1985 that he didn't believe he was doing anything wrong
by selling the debentures to the company that operates the Carl's
Jr. fast-food chain four days before the firm's losses were
publicized.
   ``I firmly believe that it was my legal right to sell those ...
at the time if I was selling it at a loss,'' Karcher told the
lawyers.
   Karcher saved at least $10,500 by selling the debentures and
avoiding the drop in market price, the SEC says.
   Insider trading charges have been filed against Karcher, his
father and 13 other family members.
   The SEC alleges the elder Karcher illegally tipped off some of
his relatives in 1984 that the Anaheim-based company was headed for
a drop in earnings.
   All the defendants have denied the charges. The SEC is seeking a
summary judgment only against the younger Karcher.

   Louis Zahn Drug Co., the leading drug
wholesaler in the Midwest, says it is being acquired by
Dallas-based FoxMeyer Drug Co.
   Melvin Zahn, the company's owner and son of its founder,
declined to give a reason for the sale or to disclose the purchase
price.
   But Marvin Kamensky, a lawyer who helped handle the sale, said
that many Zahn accouts are smaller pharmacies that find it
difficult to compete against larger, chain drugstores
   ``It's a rough business,'' he said. ``There are tremendous
pressures.''
   Privately held Zahn, founded in 1931 and based in this Chicago
suburb, had ``in excess of $200 million'' in revenues last year
through the sale of pharmaceuticals and sundries to more than 1,000
hospitals and pharmacies in Illinois, Wisconsin, Indiana and
Michigan, officials said Thursday.
   The company employs about 200 people.
   FoxMeyer, a subsidiary of National InterGroup Inc., of
Pittsburgh, had net sales of $2 billion for the year ended March 31.
   ``The acquisition of Louis Zahn Drug Co. is part of FoxMeyer's
strategy to concentrate on growing and strengthening its core drug
distribution business,'' said Howard M. Love, chairman and chief
executive officer of National InterGroup.
   In 1987, National Intergroup lost $600,000 on sales of almost
$3.4 billion.

<HEAD>Nippon, Sankyo Employees Traded Before Deal Was Announced</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Tokyo Stock Exchange said Friday that 34
employees of Nippon Steel Co. and Sankyo Seiki Manufacturing Co.
bought more than 68,000 shares of Sankyo's stock before the
companies announced a business deal.
   Fifteen employees of Sankyo, a precision machinery maker, and 19
employees of Nippon Steel purchased an average of 2,000 Sankyo
shares each as early as four months before the announcement,
according to the exchange's transaction review section.
   Officials at the Finance Ministry and the exchange have been
investigating trading in Sankyo, whose stock soared hours before
Nippon, Japan's largest steelmaker, purchased an 18 percent stake
in the company.
   The exchange took the unusual move of suspending trading in
Sankyo shares on the afternoon of July 29, but the volume of Sankyo
shares traded in the morning session still was nearly 10 times the
previous day's level.
   Securities officials have said they had suspected massive
insider trading.
   The exchange refused to name any of the 34 employees or charge
them with insider trading even though it confirmed that some of
them were directly involved with coordinating the business
agreement.
   ``Under the current law, those individuals did not violate any
law, and we can not say they were involved in insider trading,''
said Takao Nojiri, a senior managing director of the exchange. ``We
believe it is not appropriate for us give out information which may
lead to identifying them.''
   But Nojiri acknowledged that there apparently was ``a leak of
insider information.''

   Stock prices edged higher today following a
broad retreat in the previous session.
   The pace of trading slowed from this week's already sluggish
rate.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which marked the first
anniverasry of its peak by falling 15.82 points on Thursday, was up
5.51 at 2,016.36 after 90 minutes of trading today.
   Advancing issues took a narrow lead over losers among issues
listed on the New York Stock Exchange, with 564 up, 467 down and
575 unchanged.
   Big Board volume amounted to 31.62 million shares as of 11 a.m.
on Wall Street compared with 48.32 million shares at the same point
Thursday.
   Worries that inflation may be accelerating at a pace that would
prompt the Federal Reserve to push interest rates higher have
weighed on the market.
   On Thursday, the government revised upward its earlier estimates
of both economic growth and inflation in the second quarter.
   Coupled with a round of interest rate hikes in Europe, the news
sent stock prices broadly lower.
   But today, the government reported personal income rose by 0.6
percent in July, a bit below expectations, while personal spending
rose 0.5 percent.
   After that report, bond prices edged higher. That sent yields on
the closely-watched 30-year Treasury bond, for instance, to 9.43
percent from 9.45 percent late Thursday.
   After a mixed opening, stocks also moved slightly higher.
   Among the early active issues on the NYSE, Sunshine Mining
slipped \ to 3~, Goodrich was up { at 47} and Wickes was unchanged
at 13.
   The NYSE composite index was up 0.29 at 147.23. At the American

   Grain and soybean futures opened slightly lower
today on the Chicago Board of Trade in the absence of any news that
would affect prices.
   Analysts said the corn and soybean markets gradually are
shifting their focus from the dry growing season to the harvest,
when prices typically move lower.
   ``We're starting to see some corn harvest activity in the South
and two weeks from now we'll probably see it moving into the Corn
Belt,'' said Walter Spilka, a grain analyst with the investment
firm Smith Barney, Harris & Co. in New York. ``It's pretty
difficult to buy the market when the harvest is just around the
corner.''
   The wheat market, despite today's weak opening, is preparing for
an expected increase in foreign demand, Spilka said. In particular,
wheat traders expect the United States and Soviet Union to reach
agreement soon on a new long-term grain pact.
   In early trading, wheat was unchanged to 2 cents lower with the
contract for delivery in September at $3.93 a bushel; corn was \
cent to 1} cents lower with September at $2.80\ a bushel; December
oats, the only oat contract trading early in the session, were \
cent lower at $2.60\ a bushel; soybeans were 3{ cents lower to {

   Livestock and meat futures were mostly higher in early trading
on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Live cattle were .20 cent to .52 cent higher with October at
72.62 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .10 cent to .90 cent higher
with September at 82.75 cents a pound; hogs were .15 cent to .37
cent higher with October at 41.22 cents a pound; frozen pork
bellies were .08 cent to .35 cent higher with February at 55.50

   Livestock and meat futures settled mostly higher on Thursday.

<TEXT>
   A lawyer for entertainer Merv
Griffin has proposed a trust agreement in which Griffin would take
control of Resorts International Inc. stock and then place the
Atlantic City casino under a trust headed by a former industry
executive.
   The Casino Control Commission was to rule today on the proposal,
which could clear the way for Griffin to apply for interim
authorization to run the casino. He is trying to buy it from
developer Donald Trump and other shareholders.
   This morning, Resorts International adjourned a special
stockholders meeting in Atlantic City because not enough votes were
cast to approve Griffin's offer to acquire the hotel-casino
business.
   Company head I.G. ``Jack'' Davis said the American Stock
Exchange erroneously reported the meeting would be held Sept. 13 so
an insufficient number of votes were cast.
   The meeting was scheduled to resume Tuesday at 3 p.m. at the
Atlantic City casino, he said.
   Under a proposal outlined to the commission Thursday by lawyer
Nicholas Casiello, the Griffin Co., solely owned by the former talk
show host, would take control of the Resorts stock. The company in
turn would be placed under a trust headed by Al Luciani, a former
casino executive.
   The state Attorney General's Office has opposed that
arrangement. Deputy Attorney General Mary Jo Flaherty told
commissioners the stock should be placed directly under the control
of the trust, rather than Griffin's company.
   Griffin has agreed to buy Resorts stock for about $300 million
and sell back to Trump the unfinished Taj Mahal casino complex.
   The deal is contingent on state approval of a trust agreement
and an interim authorization for Griffin to operate the casino.

<TEXT>
   A federal bankruptcy judge ruled today
that former financier Marvin L. Warner cannot escape the payment of
$22 million in restitution he was ordered to make by an Ohio court.
   Lawrence Kane Jr., special prosecutor for the state of Ohio,
said the order by U.S. Bankruptcy Judge George L. Proctor was
``very significant.''
   Proctor granted the state of Ohio's motion for summary judgment
in the case.
   Warner, 69, a former U.S. ambassador to Switzerland, owned the
Cincinnati-based Home State Savings Bank, which collapsed in 1985
after losing $144 million in investments.
   Warner was sentenced in March 1987 by an Ohio judge to 3{ years
in prison and ordered to pay $22 million in restitution after he
was convicted of six counts of unauthorized acts and three counts
of securities fraud in connection with the bank's failure. He is
appealing that conviction and sentence.
   Warner, who filed for reorganization of his finances under
Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy Code in October 1987, had
sought a ruling that he was no longer liable for restitution
ordered by the state of Ohio because he had filed for bankruptcy.
   But the judge ruled Warner ``cannot avoid the $22 million order
through the bankruptcy mechanism,'' Kane said.
   The ruling, Kane said, will allow the state of Ohio to proceed
against Warner to collect the money, including any future assets he
may obtain.
   According to Warner's financial schedules, creditors are seeking
to recover $4.5 billion from him. He claimed he has only $384
million in assets.

   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which marked the first
anniverasry of its peak by falling 15.82 points on Thursday, was up

   Big Board volume amounted to 45.00 million shares as of noon on
Wall Street compared with 67.45 million shares at the same point
Thursday.
   ``There have been some very selective areas that have been
trying to pull ahead, but there is no conviction. The market has
been in this holding pattern for most of this week,'' said Charles
Jensen, technical analyst for MKI Securities Corp.
   Worries that inflation may be accelerating at a pace that would

weighed on the market.
   On Thursday, the government revised upward its earlier estimates

<TEXT>
   Prices closed lower on the London stock exchange
Friday as concerns over rising global interest rates and poor
British trade figures continued to unsettle the market.
   Trading dwindled almost to a standstill during the afternoon as
most players covered positions ahead of the three-day bank holiday
weekend in Britain, dealers said.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-stock index finished down
9.5 points, or .05 percent, at 1,770.7.
   Volume was a moderate 415.6 million shares, compared with the
524.1 million shares traded Thursday. However, most of the
session's volume was recorded during the course of the morning and
a scant 18.2 million shares changed hands in the last hour of
trading.
   Analysts said the market was still reeling from Thursday's news
that Britain's merchandise trade deficit widened to 2.15 billion
pounds in July, from about 1 billion pounds in June.
   The trade deficit, double the market's expectations, provoked
the Bank of England to signal a 1 percent hike in British
commercial banks' base lending rates to 12 percent.
   ``The market is clearly taking its time to absorb and adjust to
news that was as shocking as the trade figures,'' said Charles
Larkum, an equity analyst at James Capel and Co. in London.
   Larkum said little economic or corporate news was expected over
the course of the next two weeks and predicted that the FT-SE
100-stock index would remain around its current levels. The only
factor that could upset this scenario is if Wall Street pulls lower
with any significant momentum, he said.
   ``The market is bound to stay nervous until we get some more
data coming through,'' Larkum said.

   When she's not tending to her sheep or
horses, Sara Shaw is busy running a mail-order food business out of
her farm house that ships smoked pheasant and other locally
produced foods all over the country.
   Shaw, who was involved in the anti-war movement in the 1960s and
worked as a book designer in New York City before moving to
Minnesota in 1973, started Prairie Gourmet last summer.
   ``I don't envision myself as the head of a big corporation,''
said Shaw, whose business is located near Ortonville in western
Minnesota. ``I just want it to be a stable business that offers
employment to ... people in the area.''
   Shaw was raised in Meriden, Conn., but said she's found her
niche in rural America.
   ``This is my way of counting. Very quietly I can make a
difference by the jobs for women, by responsible agriculture,''
said Shaw, who lives in a comfortably cluttered farm house
surrounded by farm fields. ``In my own small way, I've come full
circle. Rather than thinking that I have to go out and protest,
I've chosen to come back to the country and work.''
   Shaw said she decided to start her own company following a
divorce and after hearing an inspirational speech by Texas
Agriculture Commissioner Jim Hightower.
   ``Hightower's talk was about how he was trying to turn around
the Texas food economy by not shipping all of their produce out to
be processed, but instead doing it in state. His talk was the basis
for my doing something like that,'' she said.
   Prairie Gourmet ships fresh and smoked pheasant, wild rice,
smoked sausage and lutefisk and lefsa as well as other foods,
including desserts. All of the foods are produced in Minnesota.
   For example, she buys her wild rice from the Leech Lake Band of
Chippewa; most of the pheasants are supplied by the Pomme de Terre
Game Farm in Morris; and area families sell Shaw the duck, wild
turkeys and mallards.
   Shaw employs two local residents part-time during the summer and
about eight during the holiday season to help with packing and
shipping.
   She called the business so far ``extremely successful'' and said
she had sales of $10,000 her first season.
   ``For the fact that I just got the business going last year, I
was just thrilled,'' said Shaw, who got started with a $5,000 loan
for computer equipment from the Big Stone County revolving loan
fund.
   It's important for lenders to support rural residents trying to
start new companies, Shaw said.
   ``I want other counties ... to understand that they have to take
risks sometimes, especially with women who are just trying to get
things going,'' she said. ``We're desperate in many situations, but
with a little help and a little confidence shown in us, we're able
to get some things off the ground.''
   Shaw said she's now working on setting up a cooperative cannery
where rural residents can sell jams and jellies.
   ``In their own gardens, they can raise a lot of these products.
I'd like ownership to be spread to different men and women within
the community, and for them to be responsible for it,'' said Shaw.
   Being a single woman was not a disadvantage in starting Prairie
Gourmet, she said.
   ``The only problems I've run into have been because of the lack
of my own experience,'' she said.
   Shaw said she plans to meet informally with women this fall to
talk to them about starting their own companies.
   ``They just need to hear from another woman and talk to someone
else to say, `Yes, you can do it. I know you're scared, I know you
don't see how in the world you're going to pull this together.'
It's amazing how much confidence you can give someone else,'' she
said.

<HEAD>Watch Your Economic Assumptions</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Watch your economic assumptions!
   This warning could be offered at any time of the year and at any
point in the economic cycle, but it is especially relevant now. The
reason: If your assumptions are wrong, your conclusions could be
terribly wrong.
   An example of the problem is now circulating in the popular
media, to wit, that rising interest rates make it almost inevitable
that a consumer-sector recession will develop.
   The assumption is that rising rates on variable home mortgage
loans and other variable-rate instruments, will cost the consumer
so much that little will be left for the purchase of goods and
services.
   True, rising rates could force many consumers into awkward and
even destructive financial situations, but many others might
benefit. In fact, it is likely that more money _ not less _ might
be put into the hands of consumers.
   The conclusion that higher rates could ruin the consumer economy
is based largely on the assumption that there are more debts than
assets.
   Not so, says E. Eric Heinemann, chief economist of the
investment firm Ladenburg, Thalmann & Co.
   He observes that the reverse is true, explaining: ``Data
compiled by the Federal Reserve and the Commerce Department show
plainly that during periods of rising rates, consumer interest
income goes up more than consumer interest payments.
   ``The reason for this is simple: Overall, American consumers are
enormous net creditors _ their financial assets exceed their debts
by at least $4 trillion, a margin of more than 2 to 1.''
   Another error of assumption might entrap those who argue that
the economy faces a downturn for the simple reason that the
economic expansion, now in its 69th month, is due for a fall. It is
too old, they say.
   Maybe so, maybe not.
   Some economists aren't convinced that the economy has been on a
steady roll for nearly seven years. They concede that the official
figures indicate an uninterrupted expansion; but they wonder if the
figures are correct.
   Some of the questioning arises from data supplied by Sindlinger
& Co., a Wallingford, Pa., research firm that obtains its
information from intensive telephone interviews with a
cross-section of households.
   The key to the consumer economy, says Albert Sindlinger, is what
he calls ``Household Liquidity,'' or a continuing measurement of
the financial ability of households. That, he says, is the engine
of the economy.
   ``By our calculations based on Household Liquidity, the current
economic recovery is about 20 months old,'' says Sindlinger.
Household Liquidity, he says, bottomed out in November 1986. At the
time, he listed 31 states in recession.
   He contends this was a genuine recession, a bona fide
interruption of the economic expansion, but that it was obscured
from national figures by unusually strong economic activity on the
East and West coasts.
   Sindlinger measures only a few states remaining in recession
now, but asserts that if that wasn't a recession we went through
two years ago then an unidentified monster was plodding through the
economic woods.
   Another incorrect assumption trapped some of the haughtiest
economic minds last October, when so many of them stated flatly
that a securities market collapse of such great magnitude would
lead inevitably to recession.
   Some will continue to argue that in spite of a strong economy
the verdict isn't in yet _ that a recession still lies ahead _ but
they aren't likely to get much of a hearing.
   A recession could be in the offing, since recessions are always
in the offing; some economists would have nothing to say if that
threat wasn't there to talk about.
   But linking the next recession to the securities market collapse
is getting more difficult by the day. The collapse might indeed by
a contributant to that recession, but it will be difficult to cite
it as the trigger, or chief factor.

   The stock market drifted slightly higher today

5.51 at 2,016.36 with two hours left in the session.
   Advancing issues held a narrow lead over losers among issues
listed on the New York Stock Exchange, with 632 up, 612 down and
593 unchanged.
   Big Board volume amounted to 65.34 million shares as of 2 p.m.
on Wall Street compared with 91.26 million shares at the same point
Thursday.
   Worries that inflation may be accelerating at a pace that would
prompt the Federal Reserve to push interest rates higher have
weighed on the market.
   On Thursday, the government revised upward its earlier estimates
of both economic growth and inflation in the second quarter.
   But today, the government reported personal income rose by 0.6
percent in July, a bit below expectations, while personal spending
rose 0.5 percent.
   Analysts said today's report calmed worries that inflationary
pressures were continuing to build.
   Stocks were supported by a mild rally in the bond market.
   Yields on the closely-watched 30-year Treasury bond, for
instance, fell to 9.42 percent from 9.45 percent late Thursday.

<HEAD>IMF Opens New Loan Window for Debtor Governments</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CARL HARTMAN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The International Monetary Fund announced
Friday it will lend debtor governments more money if they are hit
unexpectedly by higher interest on their old debts.
   The World Bank, the fund's sister organization, estimates Third
World debt will reach more than $1.2 trillion at the end of this
year. Much of that was lent at interest rates that vary every day,
so when rates go up, the outflow of money from the borrower country
grows heavier.
   For example, if a country has borrowed $50 billion at a variable
rate, it has to pay out an extra $500 million a year whenever the
annual rate goes up by one percentage point.
   The fund calls its new system the Compensatory and Contingency
Financing Facility. If the borrowing country accepts the fund's
conditions, it will be able to borrow up to 35 percent of its
contribution to the fund, called its quota.
   Argentina, the country now in the most acute financial trouble,
would qualify to borrow another $504 million if it could make an
agreement with the fund. Argentina has not been able to borrow from
the fund recently because it has failed to get its government
deficit down to the promised level.
   The fund and the World Bank are owned by 151 governments, with
the United States holding the largest block of votes.
   ``For a purchase (loan) to take to take place, the member's
(economic) performance under the associated arrangement (loan
agreement) from the fund must be satisfactory and the member must
be prepared to adapt its ... policies if necessary ...,'' the IMF
announcement said.
   The fund typically makes its loans by installment. When a
borrower is found not to be performing satisfactorily, the next
installment is not disbursed. Often commercial banks also stop
disbursements when the fund does. This has occurred with Argentina.

<TEXT>
   Americans' personal incomes, bolstered by the
biggest increase in wages in seven months, rose 0.6 percent in July
while consumer spending slowed because of a drop in auto sales, the
government reported Friday.
   The 0.6 percent increase in incomes was identical to the June
advance and would have been an even stronger 0.8 percent if it had
not been for a big drop in farm subsidy payments.
   Spending on personal consumption, which includes virtually
everything except interest payments on debt, rose a 0.5 percent in
July. While this was less than half the 1.1 percent June advance,
economists said it showed that overall demand remained strong
despite a decline in car purchases.
   As with other recent statistics, economists found signs of
growing inflationary pressures in the report, primarily in a 1
percent gain in wages and salaries, the biggest rise in this key
income component since last December.
   While rising incomes are normally viewed as healthy, economists
have begun worrying that demand pressures are outstripping the
economy's ability to produce goods, thus creating a classic recipe
for rising inflation.
   Those fears were heightened Thursday when the government
reported that the overall economy, as measured by the gross
national product, was growing at a 3.3 percent annual rate from
April through June, faster than previously believed, while a GNP
price index shot up at the fastest rate in six years.
   ``We have a lot of economic activity out there and it is
generating a lot of jobs and spending power for American
consumers,'' said Sandra Shaber, an economist with the Futures
Group, a Washington consulting firm.
   She said that for the first time since the late 1970s, consumers
appeared to be basing purchases on a belief that they needed to act
before prices went higher.
   ``Up until recently, we have had enormous resistance to price
increases, but I think we are beginning to see a buildup of
inflationary expectations,'' she said.
   David Jones, an economist with Aubrey G. Lanston & Co., a
governemnt securities dealer, said the personal income report
showed that economic growth was showing no signs of slowing down in
the July-September quarter, despite efforts by the Federal Reserve
to dampen demand by pushing interest rates higher. He predicted
further credit tightening in the months ahead.
   ``This is too much of a good thing for the Fed,'' he said. ``We
are seeing the strength in consumer spending coming on top of an
already strong trade sector and stepped-up spending by businesses
for plant and equipment. It raises the threat of accelerating
inflation.''
   However, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater, in Los Angeles
with President Reagan, called the report ``good news.''
   ``The figures in the report are favorable, with steady income
growth, good growth in consumer spending and an in the personal
saving rate,'' Fitzwater said.
   The 0.6 percent rise in incomes in both June and July was the
best showing since a 1 percent increase last March.
   Wages and salaries rose $24.5 billion in July, compared to an
increase of $18.9 billion in June, with increases in manufacturing
contributing $3.8 billion of the increase.
   The overall increase was offset by a $9 billion drop in farm
subsidy payments, which are extremely volatile from month to month.
   Americans' disposable, or after-tax incomes, rose 0.6 percent in
July, down only slightly from a 0.7 percent June increase.
   With incomes rising slightly faster than spending, the personal
savings rate, savings as a percentage of disposable incomes, edged
up to 4.3 percent in July, compared to 4.2 percent in June.
   The 0.5 percent increase in spending followed a 1.1 percent June
advance which had been the largest gain in 10 months.
   Total spending rose $15.7 billion, compared to a huge $36.1
billion June advance. The July performance represented slower
growth in spending for non-durable goods and services and no change
at all in the durable sector because of a drop in auto sales.
   But analysts noted that car sales have rebounded in August and
they predicted further spending gains because of this.
   The changes left incomes at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of
$4.07 trillion while personal consumption spending rose to an
annual rate of $3.24 trillion.

<HEAD>Mercantile Exchange Chief Quits After Government Agency Criticizes
Him</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The chairman the New York Mercantile Exchange
has resigned following an unusual criticism of him in an
investigation by the federal agency that supervises
commodities-futures trading.
   William M. Bradt, an independent energy-futures trader on the
exchange, quit after the Commodities Futures Trading Commission
said in a 98-page report that he had conducted himself
inappropriately in some exchange matters.
   The report on a previously disclosed inquiry concerning Bradt
said that he had improperly engaged in discussions on a new
business venture with Kevin P. Conway, the exchange's former
compliance director.
   The report also criticized Bradt for accepting fees from a
Chicago member firm of the exchange, evidently for his work in
helping create an oil-options contract traded there.
   Bradt announced his resignation Thursday after the commission
issued the critical report, considered highly unusual for a
government agency that historically has played a minimal
supervisory role in the markets.
   The report stopped short of asserting Bradt had broken any
rules, but recomended changes to strengthen the exchange's
standards of conduct that would avoid giving the appearance of
conflicts of interest.
   In a statement about Bradt's resignation, the exchange made no
mention of the criticism contained in the report, saying only that
it had cleared him of allegations of wrongdoing. The exchange said
Vice Chairman Zoltan Guttman replaced Bradt.
   ``I am pleased with the findings contained in the CFTC report
and that at no time were any Exchange or CFTC rules or regulations
violated,'' the statement quoted Bradt as saying. ``However, I
believe it is in the best interest of my business, my family and
the Exchange, now that I've been vindicated, to step down as
chairman.''
   The rapidly growing exchange is the world's major crude-oil
futures market. It also is an important center for contracts in
heating oil, gasoline, propane, platinum and palladium.

<HEAD>Former Western Airlines Customers Eligible for Rebate or Mileage</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   As many as 265,000 travelers who bought discount
fares on the former Western Airlines are eligible to receive credit
for up to 7,000 frequent-flier miles under a settlement approved in
a Chicago court.
   Judge Albert Green of Cook County Circuit Court on Thursday
approved the settlement of a class-action lawsuit filed three years
ago against Western, which has since been acquired by Atlanta-based
Delta Air Lines Inc.
   The lawsuit alleged that Western overcharged customers when it
levied cancellation or alteration fees ranging from 25 percent to
50 percent of the ticket price.
   Lawyers Alvin W. Block and Russell C. Green, representing the
plaintiffs, said Western added transportation taxes onto the basic
fare price before computing the penalties, instead of levying the
penalties only against the fare price.
   Eligible fliers are those who changed or canceled the discount
tickets on Western flights between Jan. 1, 1985 and April 1, 1987.
   Under the settlement, which carries a maximum cost to Delta of
$100,000, the airline did not admit any wrongdoing, but agreed to
give affected travelers their choice of a $4.80 refund, 3,000 more
miles on a Delta frequent-flier account at any time, or 7,000
additional miles if the traveler uses them by Dec. 31.
   Green said the deadline for rebates, some of which could have
been higher with documentation from customers, was Aug. 2, and
notices were sent before that to 265,000 people and published in
more than 60 newspapers.
   Claim forms are available from Delta, many travel agents and
airports, as well as from the lawyers representing the plaintiffs.
   Western operated mostly in the West, but also served other
cities including Chicago, New York and Washington.

<NOTE>Eds: SUBS last graf to CORRECT wheat closing price to $3.90 sted

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Grain and soybean futures closed mostly lower in
light trading Friday on the Chicago Board of Trade in the absence
of any news to influence the market, analysts said.
   ``It was a dull session with further erosion of values,'' said
Ben George, a Merrill Lynch Futures Inc. grain trading specialist
on the exchange floor.
   George said talk circulated that the Soviet Union was in the
market for U.S. corn, but he added the item was ``becoming almost a
daily rumor'' and had little market impact.
   Analysts said the corn and soybean markets were gradually
shifting their focus from the dry growing season to the harvest,
when prices typically move lower, .
   ``We're starting to see some corn harvest activity in the South
and two weeks from now we'll probably see it moving into the Corn
Belt,'' said Walter Spilka, a grain analyst with Smith Barney,
Harris & Co. in New York. ``It's pretty difficult to buy the market
when the harvest is just around the corner.''
   At the close, wheat was 3 cents to 4{ cents lower with the
contract for delivery in September at $3.90 a bushel; corn was 3{
cents lower to } cent higher with September at $2.77 a bushel; oats
were 1{ cents lower to 1{ cents higher with September at $2.54 a
bushel; soybeans were 3{ cents lower to 5 cents higher with
September at $8.32 a bushel.

<HEAD>Asbestos Claimants Miss Supreme Court Deadline, Manville Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DENVER (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Manville Corp. announced Friday that a group of
asbestos claimants had not met a deadline for petitioning the U.S.
Supreme Court to review the company's Chapter 11 reorganization
plan.
   That means just one appeal must be reviewed by the court before
Manville can implement the plan.
   ``Obviously we're pleased, because it means that we're just one
step closer to emerging from Chapter 11 and being able to operate
as a normal company again,'' said Manville spokesman David Samson.
   ``It also means we're just one step closer to the point where
the (Personal Injury Settlement) Trust can be activated and
asbestos health claimants can begin to be compensated,'' he said.
   Manville filed for bankruptcy protection six years ago, on Aug.
26, 1982, when more than 400 asbestos-related lawsuits were being
filed against the company each month.
   A proposed reorganization plan was confirmed by the Bankruptcy
Court for the Southern District of New York in December 1986, but
it cannot be consummated until all appeals are exhausted.
   The plan created the personal injury trust as well as a Property
Damage Trust to settle asbestos-related claims. It also devised a
schedule for paying secured and unsecured creditors.
   A group of about 700 asbestos health claimants had challenged
parts of the plan that prevent payment of punitive damages to
asbestos claimants and that require lawsuits for asbestos injuries
to be filed against the Manville Personal Injury Settlement Trust
rather than Manville Corp., the company said.
   The appeal was turned down by the New York bankruptcy court,
U.S. District Court and the U.S. Court of Appeals. Manville
officials said the group failed to petition the Supreme Court for a
review of the plan by the deadline at midnight Thursday.
   Earlier this summer, MacArthur Co. and Western MacArthur Co., a
Minneapolis-based building materials distributor, petitioned the
Supreme Court for a review of the bankruptcy court's approval of
more than $700 million in settlements negotiated between Manville
and 29 insurance carriers.
   The Supreme Court has not acted yet on MacArthur's petition.

   Martin Marietta Corp., a defense contractor,
has agreed to pay $430,000 to settle claims that the company
overbilled the Defense Department, the Justice Department said
Friday.
   Assistant Attorney General John Bolton said the charges against
the Bethesda, Md., company stemmed from claims filed in 1983.
   The government claimed Martin Marietta's aerospace division in
Baltimore, Md., improperly charged costs directly related to its
unsuccessful effort to win a major Defense Department contract for
the light assault vehicle. The costs were charged to an indirect
account that was partially reimbursed by the government.
   The government also claimed that in 1983 the company changed the
account numbers from certain independent research and development
efforts to an account that was partially reimbursed by the
government.
   A company spokesman who asked not to be named confirmed the
$430,000 settlement but added that the corporation ``believes it
did nothing wrong and specifically disputes the validity of the
Justice Department claim.''

<HEAD>Stock Trading Slows to Lowest Level Since Thanksgiving</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   One day after the anniversary of the stock
market's highest point in history, trading slowed to a trickle
Friday, with business on the New York Stock Exchange falling to its
lowest level in nine months.
   ``I looked at my calendar and thought it was a holiday,'' said
Lawrence R. Helfand, manager of retail sales at the Chicago-based
investment firm Rodman & Renshaw Inc.
   ``I just think a lot of people are finding an excuse to take
vacations or an early Labor Day,'' he said. ``There's no question
that people are just sitting on the sidelines.''
   NYSE volume totaled 89.24 million shares. That is the first time
volume has fallen below 100 million shares this year and is the
lowest since an 86.36 million share day last Nov. 27, the day after
Thanksgiving.
   Other measurements of the market's performance were considered
equally uninspiring, traders said. The Dow Jones average of 30
industrials rose 6.58 to 2,017.43. For the week, it rose 1.43
points.
   By contrast, on Aug. 25, 1987, the Dow average hit a record high
level of 2,722.42 and NYSE volume totaled 213.48 million shares. It
was from that point on that the market began a nervous decline that
led to the historic Oct. 19 crash, when the Dow average lost 508
points.
   Traders generally have blamed the stock market's performance of
late on an underlying post-crash investor apathy and concern about
rising interest rates.

   The central banks appear to have won the latest
round in their bout to subdue the dollar, which finished lower
Friday against several key foreign currencies.
   But just how long the victory will last remains in question, as
bullish sentiment surrounding the dollar still lingers.
   Traders spent the day assessing a round of interest rate hikes
that began Thursday in West Germany and were mimicked by a number
of European countries.
   The West German mark continued to draw broad strength from the
rate hike as well as from a statement by Bundesbank President Karl
Otto Poehl, who said the central bank would do everything to
prevent the mark from weakening.
   Although the dollar moved lower against the mark and several
other major currencies, analysts said there is an underlying
favorable sentiment toward the dollar that simply won't go away.
   ``People have been buying dollars recently on the basis of
interest rate increases to come,'' said Stephen Leach, a currency
analyst at Chemical New York Capital Markets Group.
   ``They have been somewhat restrained in selling dollars because
of the view that (the dollar) will be going up later,'' he said.
Higher interest rates increase the attractiveness of
dollar-denominated securities.
   While many analysts say U.S. interest rates are taking a
breather now, they are looking for further upward moves after
November's presidential election. ``That will stop the dollar from
falling,'' said David Wyss, chief financial economist at Data
Resources, a Lexington, Mass.-based consulting firm.
   The Federal Reserve, which surprised the financial markets
earlier this month by hiking its key lending rate, is more
concerned about keeping the economy from overheating than
manipulating the level of the dollar, he noted.
   Still, keeping the dollar in a reasonable range, partly so that
the U.S. trade deficit continues to decline, requires some skilled
juggling.
   A dollar that is too high makes foreign goods cheaper, whetting
American consumers' appetite for imports. ``And you cannot solve
that by raising interest rates overseas because that slows down
other economies, and they're going to import fewer U.S. goods,''
said Frank Watson, a vice president at Swiss Bank Corp.
   Despite the much-touted rise in the dollar, analysts agree that
its climb has been pretty much confined to the European currencies,
with the exception of the British pound.
   Based on Thursday's closing rates, the dollar was up 2.7 percent
against the mark from year-ago levels, Data Resources said, but it
was off 6.1 percent against the Japanese yen and 4.2 percent
against the British pound.
   ``The huge Japanese segment of the market is quiet, and that
suggests we've come off in part because people recognize there
isn't enough momentum at this stage,'' Leach said. ``The central
banks have won this round, but it may not last very long.''
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day
begins, the dollar fell to a closing 133.50 yen from Thursday's
133.76. Later in London, it was quoted at a higher rate of 133.65
yen. And in New York the dollar closed at 133.78 yen, up from
133.44 yen on Thursday.
   Thursday's report that Britain's trade deficit swelled to 2.15
billion pounds in July from 1 billion pounds in the previous month
continued to pummel the pound. In London it cost $1.6910 to buy one
pound, cheaper than $1.6995 late Thursday. In New York, it cost
$1.6870 to buy one pound, cheaper than Thursday's $1.6965.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late
Thursday, included: 1.8573 West German marks, down from 1.8657;
1.5681 Swiss francs, down from 1.5705; 6.3065 French francs, down
from 6.3413; 1,382.00 Italian lire, down from 1,385.00, and 1.2392
Canadian dollars, up from 1.2360.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Thursday,
included: 1.8565 West German marks, down from 1.8630; 1.5655 Swiss
francs, down from 1.5715; 6.3010 French francs, up from 6.2375;
2.0970 Dutch guilders, down from 2.1030; 1,380.50 Italian lire,
down from 1,384.13, and 1.23725 Canadian dollars, up from 1.2342.
   Gold prices eased. Republic National Bank of New York said gold
was bid at $432 a troy ounce as of 4 p.m. EDT, down from $432.60 on
Thursday. On New York's Commodity Exchange, gold bullion for
current delivery slipped to $432.10 a troy ounce, from Thursday's
$432.80.
   Gold fell in London to a late bid price of $431.40 a troy ounce,
compared with late Thursday's $433.50. In Zurich, gold closed at a
bid $432, compared with $433.50 late Thursday. Earlier in Hong
Kong, gold fell 86 cents to close at a bid $435.24.
   On New York's Comex, silver bullion for current delivery fell to
$6.655 a troy ounce, from $6.708 an ounce on Thursday. In London,
the metal was trading at a late bid price of $6.64 a troy ounce,
compared with Thursday's $6.77.

<HEAD>Postponements Delay Griffin's Deal For Resorts International</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOYCE A. VENEZIA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Resorts International adjourned a
special stockholders meeting on Friday because not enough votes
were cast to approve entertainer Merv Griffin's offer to acquire
the gaming and real estate company.
   Griffin also ran into a stumbling block at a meeting of the
state Casino Control Commission, which postponed a vote on a
proposed trust agreement Griffin must have approved to take over
Resorts from developer Donald Trump.
   Griffin plans to purchase Trump's controlling Class B stock for
$135 a share and has made a tender offer for all of the company's
Class A stock at $36 a share.
   He wants to acquire the Class A and Class B stock of Resorts for
about $300 million and will pay Trump $60 million to terminate his
lucrative management contract with Resorts. After that, Trump will
pay Griffin $255 million to purchase the 1,250-room Taj Mahal
casino complex, which is under construction next door to Resorts.
   The entire deal is contingent on state approval of the trust
agreement and interim authorization for Griffin to operate the
casino.
   Friday's procedural snags left some people unhappy, namely
stockholders who had traveled a distance to attend the meeting at
Resorts in Atlantic City. The meeting was rescheduled for 3 p.m.
Tuesday.
   In explaining why the stockholders meeting would have to be
adjourned, Resorts President I.G. ``Jack'' Davis Jr. said the
American Stock Exchange erroneously reported the meeting would be
held Sept. 13, so an insufficient number of votes were cast.
   When Davis adjourned the meeting immediately after opening it,
several people among the 100 or so stockholders present protested
loudly and demanded at least an update.
   Davis, however, calmly stated, ``I've been advised by our legal
counsel that it is inappropriate and perhaps even counter to
regulations that I discuss anything relating to the merger.''
   He added that he would answer questions privately after the
meeting adjourned.
   Once he left the podium, he was immediately surrounded by
stockholders and offered his apologies.
   ``We have about 2 million proxies and we need about 2.8
million,'' he said. ``Merv Griffin isn't going to buy the stock
until the shareholders have voted on the merger.''
   Meanwhile, the Casino Control Commission delayed a vote on
Griffin's proposed trust agreement because commissioners could not
agree whether a simple majority vote of 3-2 or a more rigorous 4-1
vote was required. The panel is scheduled to vote Tuesday.
   Under the proposed trust agreement, the Griffin Co., solely
owned by the former talk show host, would take control of the
Resorts stock. The company in turn would be placed under a trust
headed by Al Luciani, a former Atlantic City casino executive now
working at the Golden Nugget casino in Las Vegas.
   The state attorney general's office has opposed that
arrangement. Deputy Attorney General Mary Jo Flaherty told the
commissioners Thursday the stock should be placed directly under
control of the trust, rather than Griffin's company.
   Unable to agree on what form of majority was necessary to
approve the trust agreement, the casino commission asked lawyers
for both sides to submit briefs.
   At Tuesday's meeting, they will vote first on the majority
question and then on the trust proposal itself, said commission
spokeswoman Carol Kokotajlo.

<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Chrysler Corp. on Friday ran legal advertisements
in the nation's 20 largest newspaper markets, detailing a proposed
settlement in a lawsuit involving cars driven with disconnected
odometers before being sold as new.
   The three-column ads would run only one day, Chrysler spokesman
Tony Cervone said. The ads are addressed to people with Chrysler
cars bought before Oct. 9, 1986 and which were involved in the
company's ``Overnight Evaluation Program.''
   A proposed settlement of the suit was filed Aug. 19 in St.
Louis, and must be approved by U.S. District Judge John F. Nangle,
who has scheduled a hearing for Oct. 11.
   Chrysler has agreed to pay more than $16 million to people who
bought the cars driven in the program. The No. 3 automaker also
said it would provide new cars to consumers who were sold cars
damaged and repaired during the program.
   The company has extended warranties on cars driven but not
damaged in the program.
   The proposed settlement says a consumer taking part in it will
be paid a minimum of $500. The exact amount depends on how many
consumers take part in the settlement.
   The ad said notices of the settlement have been sent to some
consumers, and carries an address where other consumers may send
claims to be part of the class.
   Anyone objecting to the settlement must notify Nangle's court by
Sept. 30, and anyone wanting to remove themselves from the
settlement must do so by Oct. 7.

<HEAD>Boeing Falls Nine Months Behind In Navy Contract</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An $800 million contract to put new wings on the
Navy's aging A6-E attack jets has fallen nine months behind
schedule, Boeing Military Airplanes has confirmed.
   The new wings, made of graphite and other advanced composite
materials, are to extend the life of the airplanes, which went into
production in the late 1950s. Approximately half the Navy and
Marine Corps' 340 A6-Es have been grounded or restricted because of
metal fatigue.
   An article in this week's Aviation Week & Space Technology, an
aerospace industry publication, said the Wichita, Kan.-based Boeing
subsidiary had fallen 41 wings behind schedule. So far, only three
wings have been delivered.
   The magazine reported the Navy has decided to buy more of the
original metal wings from Grumman Corp. as replacements and will
restructure the rewinging program.
   No contract has been signed with Grumman to make the additional
metal wings. Capt. Michael Kearney, Naval Air Systems Command A6-E
program manager, told Aviation Week it will take Grumman 18 months
from any agreement before the first metal wings are delivered.
   The flight of the first test jet with a composite wing has
slipped back to January. The first such aircraft had been scheduled
for delivery in October, but will now be delayed until all problems
are solved, the magazine said.
   Vice Adm. Joseph B. Wilkinson, commander of the Naval Air
Systems Command, visited Boeing's Wichita plant in June, then wrote
Boeing Military Airplanes President Robert L. Dryden to complain
about poor attention to quality control. The Navy is withholding
approximately $100 million from Boeing because of the delay,
Aviation Week said.
   Boeing officials said they think they have solved the problems
and are moving toward the planned production rate of six wings per
month.
   ``We had some early start-up problems, some engineering changes,
and a delamination problem late last year,'' said Boeing
spokeswoman Carolyn Russell. ``That's all been resolved. More
recently, we had some fasteners that were too short. We're
inspecting all those, replacing any of those that need to be
replaced.
   Boeing's Wichita unit has 1,900 people working on the A6-E wing
project and is under contract to produce 174 production wings and
five test wings, Ms. Russell said. The first wing, scheduled for
delivery last November, was delivered in mid-May.
   Boeing has said in recent quarterly earnings reports that
startup costs and delays in military programs have cut into its
profits.

   Lorimar Telepictures Corp. said
Friday it has agreed to sell WPGH-TV in Pittsburgh to the owner of
stations in Hartford, Conn., and Miami.
   Lorimar, best known as the producer of ``Dallas,'' ``Knots
Landing'' and other TV shows, said the independent UHF station
would be purchased by a group organized by Michael Finkelstein,
owner of WTXX-TV in Hartford and WDZL in Miami.
   The price wasn't disclosed. Lorimar bought WPGH in January 1987
for $21.2 million.
   The sale to Renaissance Communications, a company organized by
Finkelstein along with Warburg Pincus Capital, is subject to
regulatory approval and negotiation of a definitive agreement.
   Lorimar, which has agreed to be acquired by Warner
Communications Inc., has been selling some assets in recent months,
and WPGH is the fourth of its six small television stations to be
sold.

<HEAD>Cocoa Futures Hit 12-Year Low On Threat To International Pact</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Cocoa futures prices plunged to their lowest level in 12 years
Friday on reports the International Cocoa Organization was
considering drastic changes in the funding of its price-support
operations.
   Cocoa for September delivery on New York's Coffee, Sugar & Cocoa
Exchange fell $37 to settle at $1,266 per metric ton, the lowest
price since late 1976.
   On other markets, cattle futures advanced while pork futures
were mixed; grains and soybeans were mostly lower; precious metals
declined; energy futures rose; and stock-index futures were
unchanged.
   The cocoa market, already weakened by large surpluses, was
shaken by reports the secretary of the International Cocoa
Organization had circulated a memo suggesting producer nations stop
paying a levy to the ICCO on Oct. 1, the beginning of the 1988-89
marketing year.
   The current ICCO agreement requires producers to pay the
organization a $30 levy for each metric ton of cocoa they sell. The
organization of the world's largest cocoa producer and consumer
nations uses the money to control world prices by buying and
maintaining a buffer stock of surplus cocoa.
   Producers have fallen $68 million behind in their levy payments,
with the largest producers _ the Ivory Coast and Brazil _ owing $48
million and $9 million, respectively, according to Sandra Kaul,
cocoa market analyst with Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. in New York.
   The ICCO secretary's memo to the organization's members
suggested the organization should abandon any hopes of collecting
the levy payments and devise another way to finance its operations,
Ms. Kaul said.
   ``This proposal is a drastic measure that people had not been
expecting,'' she said. ``In effect, this would be the end of the
ICCO pact.''
   The secretary suggested, as a financing alternative, that the
ICCO sell a total of 25,000 metric tons of buffer stock cocoa over
the next two marketing years.
   Such an action would have little impact on prices, Ms. Kaul
said, citing the 200,000-ton surplus expected in the 1988-89 year.
But the psychological impact of abandoning the current financing
agreement would be enormous, she said.
   Although the producers are not likely to ever pay all they owe,
``by keeping up the pretense of asking them for the levy, it keeps
up hope of some negotiated compromise down the road,'' she said.
   ICCO members will discuss the proposal at a two-week meeting in
London that begins Sept. 5, she said.
   Firm demand and expectations of declining supplies boosted
cattle futures on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange but the pork
complex finished mixed on the belief that larger numbers of hogs
would soon be heading to market, analysts said.
   Live cattle settled .05 cent to .87 cent higher with October at
72.97 cents a pound, a new contract high; feeder cattle were .20
cent to .53 cent higher with September at 82.25 cents a pound; hogs
were .10 cent lower to .20 cent higher with October at 41.05 cents
a pound; frozen pork bellies were .03 cent to .33 cent lower with
February at 54.82 cents a pound.
   Grain and soybean futures settled mostly lower in light
profit-taking on the Chicago Board of Trade in the absence of
influential news, analysts said.
   ``It was a dull session with further erosion of values,'' said
Ben George, a Merrill Lynch Futures Inc. grain trading specialist
on the exchange floor.
   Wheat settled 3 cents to 4{ cents lower with September at $3.90
a bushel; corn was 3{ cents lower to 2} cents higher with September
at $2.77\ a bushel; oats were unchanged to { cent higher with
September at $2.54 a bushel; soybeans were 4 cents lower to 7{
cents higher with September at $8.31{ a bushel.
   Precious metals futures fell modestly on New York's Commodity
Exchange.
   Gold settled 70 cents to 80 cents lower with October at $435.60
a troy ounce; silver was 5.5 cents to 5.6 cents lower with
September at $6.66 a troy ounce.
   Oil futures prices finished higher on the New York Mercantile
Exchange in sporadic trading, bouncing back from a steep slide the
day before.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil was 3 cents to 6 cents higher
with October at $15.34 a barrel; heating oil was .22 cent to .36
cent higher with September at 42.67 cents a gallon; unleaded
gasoline was .15 cent to .50 cent higher with September at 46.79
cents a gallon.
   On the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, the contract for September
delivery of the Standard & Poor's 500 stock index settled unchanged
at 259.70 points.

<TEXT>
   Bond prices eased and closed little changed
Friday after strengthening on news of moderate rises in personal
income and spending that diluted fears of acute inflation.
   The Treasury's key 30-year bond rose about $1 for each $1,000 in
face amount, and its yield softened to 9.43 percent from 9.45
percent late Thursday. Earlier in the trading session, the 30-year
bond was up about $5.
   Bond brokers said the market initially strengthened after the
Commerce Department reported Americans' personal income rose by 0.6
percent in July and personal consumption spending rose 0.5 percent.
   Department figures showed that two components of inflation,
rising wages and surging demand for goods, were not as excessive as
many bond investors had anticipated. The bond market is sensitive
to inflation because it erodes the value of fixed-income
investments.
   The Commerce Department report caused short-covering, which
means professional traders who had sold borrowed bonds on the
assumption that the market would drop because of the new rushed to
buy them back. The effect was to raise prices.
   Nevertheless, bonds eased as the day drew to a close, partly
because market professionals were reluctant to go into a weekend
with risky positions and decided to take some profits on whatever
gains they had made for the week.
   In the secondary market for Treasury bonds, prices of short-term
governments rose about 1-32 point, intermediates rose about [ point
and long-term maturities rose about 3-32 point, the financial
reporting service Telerate Inc. said.
   The movement of a point equals a change of $10 in the price of a
bond with a $1,000 face value.
   The Shearson Lehman Daily Treasury Bond Index, which measures
price movements on all outstanding Treasury issues with maturities
of a year or longer, rose 0.46 to 1,123.53.
   In corporate trading, industrials and utilities also
strengthened slightly. Moody's Investment Grade Corporate Bond
Index, which measures price movements on 80 corporate bonds with
maturities of five years or longer, rose 0.14 to 281.65.
   Muncipal bonds also were slightly higher or unchanged, brokers
said.
   Yields on three-month Treasury bills rose to 7.57 percent as the
discount rose 6 basis points to 7.34 percent. Yields on six-month
bills were unchanged at 7.87 percent and the discount stayed at
7.48 percent. Yields on year bills rose to 8.30 percent as the
discount rose 1 basis point to 7.72 percent.
   A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. The yield
is the annualized return on an investment in a Treasury bill. The
discount is the percentage that bills are selling below the face
value, which is paid at maturity.
   The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between
banks, traded at 8[ percent, down from 8\ percent late Thursday.

<HEAD>Stocks Post Slim Gain in Slowest Trading of Year</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Updates with closing prices throughout.</NOTE>

<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The stock market posted a slim gain Friday as
trading volume withered to its lowest level of the year.
   Analysts said stocks took some support from a mild runup in bond
prices, which sent yields on some fixed-income issues a bit lower.
   But they said the sluggish trading totals indicated investors
continue to play it safe while awaiting a clearer signal on the
direction of the economy, inflation and interest rates.
   ``There have been some very selective areas that have been
trying to pull ahead, but there is no conviction. The market has
been in this holding pattern for most of this week,'' said Charles
Jensen, technical analyst for MKI Securities Corp.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which fell 15.82 on
Thursday, rose 6.58 to 2,017.43. That left the market's best-known
index with a gain of 1.43 points for the week.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 7-to-6 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
725 issues up, 605 down and 601 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the NYSE came to 89.24 million shares,
down from 127.64 million in the previous session. The NYSE index
rose 0.30 to 147.24.
   That was the slowest trading level of 1988 and the lowest since
86.36 million shares were traded on Nov. 27, 1987, the day after
Thanksgiving.
   Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including
trading at regional exchanges and on the over-the-counter market,
totaled 106.96 million shares.
   Worries that inflation may be accelerating at a pace that would
prompt the Federal Reserve to push interest rates higher have
weighed on the market.
   But the government reported Friday that personal income rose by
0.6 percent in July, a bit below expectations, while personal
spending rose 0.5 percent.
   Analysts said the report calmed worries that inflationary
pressures were continuing to build.
   The report sent bond prices mildly higher, reducing their yields
slightly.
   Nonetheless, Jensen said relatively high rates on fixed-income
securities such as Treasury issues are giving investors appealing
alternatives to stocks.
   ``No one wants to get out there and be aggressive. They can stay
on the sidelines and generate some pretty nice yields without much
risk,'' he said.
   Gene Jay Seagle, director of technical research at the brokerage
Gruntal Financial Inc., said he thinks the slow trading indicates
``a market that seems to feel the worst that can hit us has
happened.''
   ``This is a very sold out market,'' he said. ``There is so much
pessimism and so much cash ... that the chance is for a breakout on
the upside.''
   Northeast Utilties was the most active issue on the NYSE, rising
[ to 18]. Friday was the deadline for shareholders to qualify for a
quarterly dividend.
   Primerica was up 2] at 30[ on speculation that it may be a
takeover target.
   Macmillan rose | to 83~. The company rejected as inadequate an
$80-a-share takeover bid from Britain's Robert Maxwell and said it
may propose a sweetened restructuring plan.
   Among other actively-traded stocks, Exxon rose { to 46\,
Goodrich jumped 1] to 48| and Coca Cola was up | at 39}.
   The Wilshire Associates Equity Index, the market value of NYSE,
American and OTC issues, rose $5.164 billion, or 0.20 percent.
   Standard & Poor's industrial index rose 0.65 to 298.01, and
S&P's 500-stock composite index was up 0.50 to 259.68.
   At the American Stock Exchange, the market value index rose 0.66
to 293.87. The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter
market closed at 374.43, up 0.39.

   A three-year battle over the Seattle-Tokyo air
route took another twist Friday as a federal appeals court ordered
the Department of Transportation to award the route now held by
United Airlines to rival Continental Airlines.
   The decision by the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the
District of Columbia left Continental joyful, United silent, and a
third contender for the route, American Airlines, puzzled.
   A Transportation Department spokesman said the agency would have
no immediate comment.
   ``The lawyers are studying it and a response will be
forthcoming,'' the spokesman, Bill Mosley, said.
   United spokesman Joe Hopkins in Chicago responded, ``We will
have no comment until we have time to review it.''
   Continental President Martin R. Shugrue said his airline was
``extremely gratified with the decision.
   ``The law was on our side, as we maintained all along.''
   ``We're clearly disappointed,'' said American spokesman Jim
Brown in Fort Worth, Texas. ``However, at this point, since we were
not involved in that particular litigation, there's not a great
deal of action we can take that we are aware of. We will look more
closely at the decision by the Appeals Court to see if, in fact,
American Airlines has any options at this point.
   ``It's difficult for us to see how Continental Airlines would be
a carrier that would help strengthen national interests as it
regards service to Tokyo and transpacific service in general.''
   Continental, American and United have been vying for the
Seattle-Tokyo run and at various times each has been recommended by
administrative law judges or senior DOT officials to fly the route.
   This summer alone, an administrative law judge recommended that
United be awarded the route, a top DOT official subsequently
recommended it go to American, and a DOT assistant secretary then
said further study was needed.
   The appeals court, in a highly technical order, ruled DOT
violated administrative procedures when in June 1987 it decided to
begin again the process of selecting an airline rather than making
a final decision.
   At that time, an administrative law judge recommended
Continental be awarded the route, but a senior DOT official
disagreed, recommending United retain it.
   In Friday's ruling, the appellate court said, ``Continental and
American had a statutory right to a prompt decision on the merits
of their applications (for the route) and the Department cannot
escape this obligation. ...''
   The court said the DOT had had 90 days to either accept the
administrative law judge's recommendation or come up with its own
decision on who should fly the route. Starting the proceedings over
was not acceptable, the court said.
   The court ordered that DOT recommend to President Reagan that
Continental receive the route.
   Mosley said the White House would review the recommendation for
``foreign policy or national defense'' implications but approval
was usually pro-forma.
   All three airlines had engaged in a heated competition for the
route.
   United President Stephen Wolf said at a hearing it would be
unfair for the department to strip his airline of the route after
it had spent years trying to acquire it and had sunk millions of
dollars into developing it at a time when it was just becoming
profitable.
   United had previously warned it would have to cancel its
Seattle-Hong Kong run if it lost the route and transfer many of its
2,500 employees workers based at Seattle-Tacoma International
Airport.
   American President Robert Crandall testified that United, which
already flies between Los Angeles and Tokyo and San Francisco and
Tokyo, wanted to retain the Seattle route to block other airlines
from gaining a foothold in Far East markets.
   Continental Chairman Frank Lorenzo said his airline was prepared
to slash fares to the Far East if it received the route, including
one-way Seattle-Tokyo fares, as low as $299.
