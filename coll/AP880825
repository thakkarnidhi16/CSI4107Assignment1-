<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Professor Josiah Thompson is an expert on
such noted philosophers as Kierkegaard, Nietzsche _ and Sam Spade.
   Spade? What in the name of Humphrey Bogart is going on here? A
career change, that's what.
   In 1976, Thompson, driven by a ``thirst for experience,'' left
his tenured position as professor of philosophy at Haverford
College _ a prestigous Quaker school in Pennsylvania, came to San
Francisco and became a private detective.
   He couldn't have picked a better city in which to set up shop.
   San Francisco's hills are steeped in the lore of Dashiell
Hammett and his legendary sleuth, Sam Spade, the ``blond Satan''
whose hair darkened when brought to the screen by Humphrey Bogart
in ``The Maltese Falcon.''
   There's even a bronze plaque on a San Francisco street,
recalling a murder that took place only in Hammett's mind: ``On
approximately this spot Miles Archer, partner of Sam Spade, was
done in by Brigid O'Shaughnessy.''
   Thompson, whose previous writings were mostly limited to the
academic world, has recounted his metamorphosis in a book
appropriately called ``Gumshoe: Reflections in a Private Eye''
(Little, Brown, $17.95).
   He was born 53 years ago in East Liverpool, Ohio, where his
father sold dishes. During World War I, his father took a pair of
field glasses from a dead German and gave them to the youngster.
   Thompson, whose nickname is Tink, still uses the glasses on
cases. He keeps them hanging over his desk and has used them on
stakeouts.
   Even though slightly built, he played halfback in high school,
closing his eyes ``on every play.'' Later, he was under fire in
Lebanon as an ensign with a Navy Underwater Demolition Team, the
elite Frogmen.
   Why did he become a professor in the first place, going from
football bruises and the sound of warfare to the safety of a
college campus?
   ``I had plenty of money when I got out of the Navy, with
demolition and combat pay,'' he said. ``I was a good student in
high school so I went to Oxford and from there took the line of
least resistance.''
   When that line became a cul-de-sac, he took a sabbatical and
grabbed a job with an established detective agency in San Francisco.
   During his apprenticeship and as his own boss, Thompson has
worked on such headline cases as the defense of Black Panther Huey
Newton on assault and murder charges, and the defense of William
and Emily Harris in the Patty Hearst case.
   There were also other, less publicized capers, ranging from
recovering $30,000 from under the floorboards of an attic in a drug
case to retrieving a kidnapped child from India.
   Thompson's wife, Nancy, sells real estate. They have two adult
daughters and a son who plays soccer in college. He never carries a
gun and he thinks the most dangerous part of his job is ``mistaken
identity.''
   ``I was taken for a spy on a case in Morocco,'' he said. ``And
one time in Canada, while working on a drug case, word got around
that a hit man was being brought in. When people heard I was from
California, some of them thought I was the guy. The bars would
clear when I came in.''
   While honing his skills as a gumshoe, Thompson has become
fascinated by Hammett and Spade, so much so that on one case he
took the time to interview some of Hammett's relatives.
   Hammett, through Spade, was a bit of a philosopher, he says.
   ``In order to love, one must put off hardness and shiftiness,''
Thompson said. ``The ability to lie effectively, to appear
different than one really is, all the disguises essential in the
world of power, become, in the world of love, temptations, artful
excuses to avoid the nakedness love requires, to avoid love.''
   Hammett knew this, he said.
   ``That's why in the last line of The Maltese Falcon he makes
Spade `shiver' as he looks down the cold barrel of his future.''

<DATELINE>YELLOWSTONE NATIONAL PARK, Wyo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A fire that has charred a
35-mile swath across the heart of Yellowstone National Park
threatened one of the park's most picturesque areas and forced out
hundreds of visitors, officials said Wednesday.
   The rapidly burning North Fork fire, which started July 23 in
Idaho's Targhee National Forest, grew to nearly 100,000 acres and
forced the closure Wednesday morning of the Canyon area.
   Winds expected to reach 50 mph Wednesday in the park failed to
materialize, and by nightfall the fire remained one mile to the
west of the area, which is located a bit north of the center of the
60-mile-square park.
   Elsewhere, crews southeast of Helena, Mont., said they expected
to contain the 37,600-acre Warm Springs Creek blaze by Friday
evening; and in Idaho, air tankers and fire crews fought a surging,
1,000-acre blaze on the slopes of Hells Canyon, the nation's
deepest gorge.
   The closure of Canyon, Yellowstone's largest development with
600 cabins and 280 campsites, sent more than 700 visitors and
employees to other parts of the park.
   ``My children are all excited about it,'' said tourist Allen
Jones, of Staffordshire, England. ``It didn't detract from our
visit at all.''
   By midmorning Wednesday, only firefighters and reporters
remained at Canyon, and the buzzing of chain saws filled the air as
crews hurriedly removed downed trees and undergrowth. Smoke in the
air partially obscured the view of the 308-foot Lower Falls and
109-foot Upper Falls.
   Fire officials said they hoped to keep the North Fork fire
burning to the north of the Canyon area, but feared that embers
could bring the blaze right into Canyon.
   Michelle Rotter, a park service public information officer, said
the North Fork fire could then conceivably burn from Canyon and
into the area blackened by the Clover Mist fire some miles to the
east, in effect cutting the park virtually in two.
   Although not the biggest of the 10 fires that have burned more
than 354,000 acres in Yellowstone, the North Fork blaze has become
the most dangerous to structures. Firefighters previously had come
near to containing the fire, but the lack of rainfall combined with
winds gusting to 60 mph repeatedly have fanned it out of control.
   The 156,500-acre Clover Mist fire earlier this week swung into
the Shoshone National Forest east of Yellowstone. In the national
forest, 635 Army regulars were working with professional
firefighters to halt the advance.
   The so-called Snake Complex of fires, which includes the Red,
Shoshone and Falls fires in southern Yellowstone, spread over
80,000 acres by Wednesday. While forcing the closure of the Grant
Village area and the park's south entrance, the fires were not
threatening any structures.
   Fires also posed threats both north and south of the park.
   To the south in Grand Teton National Park and the Bridger-Teton
National Forest, firefighters dwarfed by 150-foot walls of flame
battled to keep the 12,600-acre Huck fire from crossing into
Yellowstone about 1{ miles away. The fire had more than doubled in
size from Tuesday to Wednesday.
   Just over the Montana line north of the park, nearly 600
additional firefighters and a top-level fire-management team from
Alaska arrived Wednesday to take over the 27,000-acre Storm Creek
fire. The blaze is burning out of control in a wilderness area
seven miles north of Cooke City, a town near the northeast corner
of the park.
   Near Helena, crews had expected to contain the 37,600-acre Warm
Springs Creek blaze Wednesday night, but pushed the deadline back
two days because of one troublesome area along the fire lines, fire
information officer Bob Krepps said. The 2-week-old fire has burned
more than a dozen structures.
   ``Once that's done and held, there's nothing much left to cause
us any problem,'' Krepps said Wednesday. ``We're getting close. The
noose is tightening.''
   In Idaho, more than 400 firefighters were committed to the Eagle
Bar blaze in Hells Canyon, which was burning out of control with no
containment target in sight. The blaze made two significant runs
Wednesday, moving into the Deep Creek drainage containing 12
million board feet of timber and toward the base camp at Kinney
Point.
   In southern Oregon, a fire in Crater Lake National Park that
charred 85 acres Tuesday grew to more than 1,000 acres Wednesday,
burning across the park boundary into neighboring Winema National
Forest.
   In central Oregon, firefighters nearly contained a blaze that
charred 110 acres and forced the brief evacuation of three homes,
but several lightning-caused blazes elsewhere in the state were
reported out of control.
   In southwestern Washington, calmer winds and cooler temperatures
allowed firefighters to cut a containment line around 75 percent of
a 500-acre fire 30 miles southwest of Mount Rainier National Park,
officials said. The fire grew from 60 acres to 500 on Tuesday
thanks to gusty wind, 100-degree air and low humidity.

<HEAD>Consumer Division Work Was Overstated, Report Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CLEVELAND (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sen. Dan Quayle's version of duties he handled
as a consumer watchdog when he worked for the Indiana attorney
general in 1970-71 appear to be exaggerated, an Ohio newspaper
reports in its Friday editions.
   The (Cleveland) Plain Dealer reported that state records in the
Indiana archives reveal that Quayle, 41, was a research assistant _
an entry-level job _ in the attorney general's office for most of
that time, and held the consumer watchdog job for only 2{ months,
from July to mid-September in 1971.
   Quayle's Senate biography, which is being distributed as
official background of the Republican vice-presidential nominee,
says: ``He was chief investigator for the Consumer Protection
Division of the Indiana Attorney General's Office from 1970-1971.''
   The Plain Dealer reported that the division was just being
organized at the time.
   ``He just helped set it up,'' said Robert E. Lybrook, a lawyer
in Martinsville, Ind., who became the chief investigator in
September 1971, when the division officially opened for business.
   State personnel records show Quayle was already working for
then-Gov. Edgar Whitcomb as an administrative assistant when the
consumer division was officially launched.
   The consumer division had been created earlier in 1971 by the
Indiana Legislature. The division was empowered to help resolve
consumer complaints over such things as defective products, false
advertising, odometer tampering and mail-order fraud.
   ``I don't remember when Quayle first started out,'' said Robert
A. Smith, an Indianapolis lawyer who was the consumer division's
first director. Smith said Quayle was assigned to his staff for a
brief time before leaving to work in the governor's office.
   Said M. Stanton Evans, an editor at the Indianapolis News who
arranged Quayle's job interview with then-Attorney General Theodore
L. Sendak: ``He sure didn't start in that (consumer) job. He wasn't
chief of anything when he went over there.''
   Evans worked for Eugene C. Pulliam, publisher of Indiana's
largest newspapers and Quayle's grandfather.
   State records show that Quayle, who graduated from DePauw
University in May 1969 with a political science degree, went to
work in the attorney general's office as a ``legal assistant'' in
January 1970.
   The job is similar to that of a law clerk. It involved drafting
legal memoranda, performing research for opinions and writing
letters, according to other employees who worked in the attorney
general's office at the time. Quayle was attending night school at
Indiana University School of Law at the same time.
   The office's annual report, filed in the Indiana state archives,
shows Sendak didn't have a consumer division in 1970. Quayle's
picture was in the report with those of seven other research
assistants.
   Sendak's 1971 annual report, which he was required to file under
state law, has the pictures of the three staffers in the new
consumer division. The three included Smith, as the director,
Roland D. Mather as assistant director and Robert E. Lybrook as
chief investigator. Quayle was not even listed as being on the
attorney general's staff.

<TEXT>
   A former U.S. Army sergeant
arrested in West Germany headed an international spy ring that sold
NATO defense secrets to the Soviets at high prices for a decade,
officials said Thursday.
   ``We can't exclude the possibility that millions of dollars are
involved,'' said Alexander Prechtel, spokesman for the chief
federal prosecutor's office.
   A second American soldier who was not identified received a
``five-figure sum'' of money for supplying the ring with military
secrets, said Chief Federal Prosecutor Kurt Rebmann, and Prechtel
said two Hungarian-born brothers arrested Tuesday in Sweden with
cipher keys, coded messages and radios were a part of the ring.
   It was too early to know how much damage was caused to the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization, Prechtel said in an interview, but
the ring is believed to have stolen documents concerning NATO
defense plans for Europe and U.S. Army contingency plans for a
ground war with the Soviet Union in Europe.
   Clyde Lee Conrad, the former sergeant, was arrested Tuesday, and
a statement from the prosecutor's office said he was charged with
``compelling suspicion of espionage activities in an especially
grave case.''
   The New York Times in its Friday editions quoted officials as
saying Conrad gave away information on rocket bases and a secret
NATO oil pipeline in West Germany to resupply tanks. The report
from Washington did not identify the officials.
   Conrad was born in 1947 in Ohio and worked for the U.S. military
for 20 years, Prechtel said. Army records list his hometown as
Sebring, Ohio.
   He worked as an infantryman and then as an ``administration
specialist'' during his active duty, according to his service
records released in Washington. Conrad received the National
Defense Service Medal, the Vietnam Service Medal, five Army
Commendation medals, the Army Achievement Medal, three Meritorious
Service medals and seven Good Conduct medals.
   Prechtel said Conrad worked with classified military defense
plans for seven years at a U.S. Army base in Bad Kreuznach, in
central West Germany, and had access to a wide array of secret
documents. Conrad allegedly continued espionage work after he left
the service in 1985, Prechtel said.
   Rebmann said Conrad turned over the most recent batch of
information to his Soviet bloc contact in Vienna just last month.
   Cable News Network on Thursday quoted unidentified West German
sources as saying Conrad systematically photographed files between
1980 and 1985. The CNN report said investigators believe he may
have transferred material onto a personal computer, which was
seized at his home.
   Espionage cases are common in West Germany, where Soviet bloc
agents are active and sometimes are caught. But allegations of deep
involvement by an American citizen in a West German-based ring are
extremely rare.
   An official at the U.S. Justice Department, speaking on
condition of anonymity, called the case ``a serious encroachment on
our national security.''
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said President Reagan had
been kept informed about the investigation ``on a continuing
basis.'' But he added, ``We won't have any response or reaction at
this point. We're looking into it.''
   A special panel of West Germany's Supreme Court ordered Conrad
held in prison pending further investigation, Rebmann said.
   Prechtel said the West German-based spy ring started in the late
1970s and used couriers from Sweden.
   In Goteborg, Sweden, authorities said they detained two
Hungarian-born brothers who confessed to working for the Hungarian
secret service.
   The two men, physicians who immigrated to Sweden in the 1960s,
were detained with radios, cipher keys and coded messages,
authorities said. Their names were not released.
   The New York Times reported Thursday that eight people were
arrested by Swedish and West German in the ring operating through a
German-Hungarian connection.
   The report said investigators believe the spy ring provided
U.S., West German and NATO secrets to the Hungarian intelligence
agency. The Hungarians then shared the secrets with the Soviet
Union, officials told the Times.
   Prechtel, speaking from his office in the city of Karlsruhe,
confirmed virtually all of the Times report. But he said
``several'' people were taken into custody or arrested and could
not confirm that the number was eight.
   The Times said the network was uncovered by West German and U.S.
officials, including agents from the FBI and the Army. The Army has
about 250,000 military personnel in West Germany at more than 200
installations and frequently warns its personnel to beware of
Soviet bloc spies.
   Rebmann said Conrad ``is under compelling suspicion of having
delivered ... documents to a Soviet bloc secret service by means of
a command officer and couriers living abroad in return for high
payments.''
   He did not identify the command officer but said the two last
met in Vienna last month when Conrad allegedly again handed over
secret documents for payment.
   After his retirement, Conrad tried to recruit other soldiers for
espionage, Rebmann said.
   ``He recruited another member of the U.S. Army for espionage
work and paid him a five-figure sum for the delivery of military
documents,'' Rebmann's statement said. The type of currency was not
disclosed.
   The prosecutor's spokesman declined to release any further
information about the second soldier.

   Democrat Michael Dukakis said Thursday that cocaine imports have
tripled in seven years and charged the Reagan administration with
permitting a ``drug cancer'' to take root. George Bush said he
represents ``proven tested leadership'' and likened his
presidential rival to Jimmy Carter.
   Dukakis and Bush sparred long distance as their vice
presidential running mates encountered turbulence on their own
campaign rounds.
   Democrat Lloyd Bentsen was booed repeatedly when he praised
Dukakis before the Veterans of Foreign Wars meeting in Chicago.
``The simple truth is, Gov. Dukakis is a veteran, a patriot and an
advocate of American strength and steadiness,'' the Texas senator
said.
   Republican vice presidential candidate Dan Quayle was greeted in
Columbia, Mo., by competing groups of supporters and demonstrators
and a few signs that read, ``War Wimp'' and ``Quayle's a Chicken.''
That was a reference to the furor over his National Guard service
at the height of the Vietnam War.
   The Indiana senator told reporters the public was ``getting a
little sick'' of the controversy, and at a meeting later with
farmers, he added, ``I won't take any questions'' about the subject.
   Quayle said he was qualified to assume the presidency ``if that
situation arises.'' He added that at 41, he is nearly as old as
John Kennedy was when he won the White House.
   Quayle faced new questions on his resume, however. The
(Cleveland) Plain Dealer reported in its Friday editions that
Quayle held an entry-level job in the Indiana attorney general's
office for most of the time he claimed to be ``chief investigator''
for the office's Consumer Protection Division.
   The candidates spoke as the debate over campaign debates
continued in Washington. Nancy M. Neuman, president of the League
of Women Voters, said she was encouraged that aides to Bush and
Dukakis would meet next week to begin negotiations on debates for
the fall.
   Democratic chairman Paul Kirk criticized Bush for indicating on
Wednesday that he wanted to wait until at least Sept. 20 before
meeting Dukakis in debate. ``...He's not going to be able to refuse
to debate,'' Kirk said.
   Dukakis leveled a sharp attack on the drug policies pursued by
President Reagan, and said Bush had failed in his task as a leader
in the administration war on drugs. He said the administration was
``actively in business with (Panama) General Manuel Noriega while
Noriega was involved in drug activity.
   ``My friends, that's criminal. That's criminal,'' he said.
   ``Why after seven years of task forces and policy boards and
grandiose claims have cocaine imports tripled, drug-related deaths
doubled and heroin imports risen by 50 percent?'' Dukakis added in
a speech in Cleveland. He said the ``drug cancer'' was undermining
governments overseas and was the ``single greatest cause of
violence in America today.''
   An upbeat Bush said the campaign momentum belonged to him as he
opened a four-day campaign swing through his adopted home state of
Texas. He said the country needs ``proven, tested leadership'' in
the White House.
   The vice president compared Massachusetts Gov. Dukakis to former
President Carter, adding he did not want to return to the
``malaise'' that occurred ``the last time a governor came out of
nowhere and became president of the United States.'' Carter won the
White House in 1976 campaigning as a former governor of Georgia.
   Standing in the late-summer heat in San Antonio, Bush told a
riverfront rally that he would revive the faltering oil industry,
create a better climate for small business, fight against federal
gun control and provide jobs for the state's large minority
population.
   ``I want to help these minorities who haven't really had a shot
at the starting line,'' he said.
   Bush made no mention of Quayle in his remarks, but said, ``Yes,
I do,'' when asked if he thought the controversy was behind him.
   Bush, meanwhile, appeared to be softening his stance on the
Strategic Defense Initiative. The New York Times quoted Bush in its
Friday editions as saying a decision on whether to deploy a full or
partial Star Wars defense system must await more research into its
capabilities and costs.
   ``I don't think we yet know what the price tag will be,'' Bush
said. ``If you went to a full deployment of a full strategic
defense, it would be very expensive. What I want to do is to
continue reserach at the levels of funding, essentially, that we
have requested.''
   Bentsen was wearing his VFW cap as he defended Dukakis before a
hostile audience. ``The simple truth is this: Gov. Dukakis is a
veteran, a patriot and an advocate of American strength and
steadiess,'' he said. ``He can be trusted as a defender of American
security _ and as a champion of American values.''
   But the Texas senator and World War bomber pilot was interrupted
four times by booing, including once when he said that Carter had
begun the much-heralded defense buildup.
   The booing appeared to be led by VFW members from Massachusetts,
and at one point the organizations's national commander, Earl L.
Stock, Jr., appealed for quiet. ``I had a tough assignment and I
fulfilled it,'' Bentsen said. ``Obviously some of them didn't want
to hear it.''
   Quayle campaigned through the Midwest, telling his audiences it
was time to ``talk about the future'' and not his controversial
past.
   Referring to questions about his Vietnam-era stint in the
National Guard, Quayle said the public is ``getting a little bit
sick'' of that issue.
   ``I've answered questions for seven days now,'' he told
reporters as he arrived in Columbia, Mo.
   ``We're going to talk about the future. We're going to talk
about jobs. We're going to talk about other issues that the
American people are interested in.''
   Quayle said he was qualified to be elected to a job placing him
first in line for the presidency. ``I am qualified if that
situiation arises,'' the Indiana senator said. ``I'm very close to
the same age as Jack Kennedy was when he was elected.'' Kennedy was
43 in 1960 when he won the White House and had been in Congress for
eight years, compared to 12 for Quayle.

<HEAD>Dade Teacher Salaries Bring Flood Of Applications</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Also in Thursday AMs report.</NOTE>

<TEXT>
   Dade County's approval of a whopping 28 percent
teacher salary increase and a larger role for teachers in school
decision-making has brought a flood of applications from around the
country, officials say.
   News of the new contract approved by the Dade school board last
month has ``spread like wildfire,'' said Terence Garner, director
of teacher recruitment in Dade County.
   ``My desk is literally covered with messages from people calling
and wanting applications or copies of the contract sent,'' said
Garner.
   ``We have enough candidates so principals can look at five to
eight people for every one position,'' Garner said. ``We promised
the school board we're going to hire the cream of the crop and now
we're getting it.''
   Last-minute hiring is under way and is expected to continue even
after classes begin Monday in the Dade County's system, which
includes the city of Miami. With about 255,000 students and more
than 15,200 teachers, it's the nation's fourth-largest.
   There's also an avalanche of applications in Rochester, N.Y.,
where the city school district attracted national attention last
fall with a contract that boosted salaries and gave teachers more
responsibility.
   ``When we go to college recruiting fairs, we have lines of
people waiting to talk to us,'' said Ed Delaney, director of
teacher personnel for the district.
   The three-year contract in Rochester raised salaries an average
40 percent over three years and offered some teachers who accept
difficult assignments and work longer hours the chance to make
$70,000 a year by the third year of the contract.
   In Dade County, average teacher pay will rise to $33,066 the
first year of the contract, 9 percent above last year's pay of
$30,000. Veteran teachers with doctorates could earn up to $64,000
a year. By the third year of the contract, the average pay would
rise to $39,646, 28 percent above last year's pay.
   The contract also calls for expanding teachers' say in school
decision-making. Teachers, principals and union stewards will sit
together on faculty councils and make shared decisions, and teacher
committees will help design schools and hire principals. Teachers
are expected to approve it overwhelmingly when they vote Thursday
and Friday.
   Dade's $33,066 average salary will be the highest in the state,
nearly $8,000 above Florida's statewide average in 1987-88 and more
than $5,000 above the 1987-88 national average of $28,031, as
calculated by the National Education Association.
   ``I think many other districts will have to follow what we've
done in order to be competitive,'' Garner said. ``Teacher salaries
all over will have to continue to rise.''
   But state school officials say it could be some time before
districts elsewhere in Florida follow Dade's lead.
   ``I think Dade County has unique characteristics. The cost of
living is more in Dade County, the union-administration
relationship is extremely strong and cooperative, the emphasis on
local solutions is greater there than anywhere else,'' said David
Voss, spokesman for Education Commissioner Betty Castor.
   ``We probably have the best labor-management relationship in the
United States,'' said Annette Katz, spokeswoman for the Dade
teachers' union. ``That happened over a number of years, and it
happened because of trust.''
   Katz said Dade's contract could encourage frustrated teachers
elsewhere in Florida to flock to the Miami area, although other
spokesmen say Dade's real competition is other large urban
districts nationwide, not other Florida districts.
   ``We're not trying to raid people, but yes, people are
interested,'' Katz said. ``We have to recruit the best teachers we
can find.''
   Laurie Murray, executive vice president of the teachers union in
Duval County, which includes the city of Jacksonville, agreed that
things are better in Dade.
   ``We've made some of the same proposals that Dade has but
there's been no interest at the administrative level in shared
decision-making,'' she said. ``Teachers have only a minimal input
in every area.'' Management's latest offer in Duval is for a 4
percent pay hike, she said.

   Sybil Ludington won't be beheaded after all
_ but she might be scalped.
   Both suggestions might have appealed to the British troops who
were bedeviled by the 16-year-old heroine of the Revolutionary War.
But local officials who made the suggestions insist they mean Sybil
no harm _ they just want to help her overcome an embarrassing
problem.
   It seems that Sybil _ a statue of her, that is _ has begun to
foam at the mouth.
   Last month, Putnam County officials were nearly ready to remove
the head of the statue to clean out the mold causing the foam. But
Tuesday night, a committee of the County Legislature heard an
alternate remedy.
   By slicing a small hole in the statue's head, legislator Lynn
Greenwood said, workers might be able to remove the growth.
   Ms. Greenwood said she opposed decapitation, preferring a
``scalp job, which will be done at a more reasonable cost and (be)
less dramatic to the people who see her every day.''
   The bronze statue on the shore of Lake Gleneida depicts the
16-year-old girl riding a horse in 1777, when she dashed through
the countryside warning colonists that British forces were burning
nearby Danbury, Conn.

   While they know the guest of honor won't
attend, residents of this southeastern Nebraska community are
planning a celebration to mark the birth of the newest member of
England's royal family.
   The birth of Princess Beatrice, pronounced BEE-a-tris, gives the
community of nearly 13,000, pronounced Bee-AT-tris, a reason to
display pride in the name they share.
   ``It's a unique opportunity,'' said Randy Baynes, a member of
the Gage County Visitors Committee.
   Plans call for a Sept. 1 baby shower at the Chamber of Commerce
to honor the princess, born Aug. 8. She is the daughter of Prince
Andrew and his wife, Sarah, the Duke and Duchess of York, and is
fifth in line to the throne.
   ``We're planning on serving iced tea and cake, but maybe tea and
crumpets might be more appropriate,'' said Diane Schwenke,
president of the Chamber of Commerce.
   While residents will be able to drop off cards and gifts for her
royal highness, the town's official presents will include a
T-shirt, mug, honorary Beatrice citizenship papers, a Beatrice
Public Library card, a bib cross-stitched with her name, and a deed
giving her one square inch of land at the Homestead National
Monument near here, Mrs. Schwenke said.

<TEXT>
   Officials have dumped more than 30,000
gallons of milk at a dairy farm following the recent deaths of more
than 20 cows, possibly from something they ate, authorities said.
   The milk apparently was not contaminated but was dumped as a
public health precaution until the cause of the cow deaths is
determined, according to officials from the farm and the state
agriculture department.
   ``I do not believe there is any contaminant or toxicant causing
the cattle deaths,'' Jay Boosinger, director of the division of
dairy industry for the Florida Department of Agriculture and
Consumer Services, said Wednesday.
   ``But it's better to err on the side of public health and safety
and recommend that they not market the milk.''
   Boosinger said milk, water, and feed samples, as well as tissue
samples from one of the cows that died during the past two weeks,
were collected from the 967-acre Imagination Farms, which milks
1,100 cows. Test results were not expected until later this week.

   Rock star Prince can't be faulted for lack of
hard work.
   Prince will barely be back from his European concert series next
month when he will begin his first U.S. tour in four years with a
pair of concerts in his home state of Minnesota.
   Prince, who lives and records in suburban Chanhassen, is
scheduled to play Sept. 14 and 15 at the Met Center in Bloomington.
   Then, he'll hit the road through at least Oct. 19, taking his
90-member entourage to suburban Chicago, Cincinnati, New York City,
Washington, D.C., Atlanta and Philadelphia.
   More dates will be added, said Bob Merlis, vice president of
publicity for Warner Bros. Records Inc.
   And after concluding the U.S. tour, Prince might just jet off
for a Far East tour early next year, Merlis said.

   Country singer Johnny Paycheck, who
faces up to 9{ years in prison for his 1986 conviction in a barroom
shooting, will perform this weekend in his native state.
   The bearded performer is to sing in this southwestern Ohio town
and in Dayton on Saturday, and then at a benefit concert Sunday
near Chillicothe.
   Paycheck, 49, faces a prison sentence of 4{ to 9{ years for his
conviction on charges he shot and wounded another bar patron, Larry
Wise, on Dec. 19, 1985, at a Hillsboro tavern. According to Wise,
Paycheck apparently took offense when Wise offered him a meal of
turtle soup and venison, to which Paycheck responded, ``I'm no
country hick.''
   Paycheck, best known for the 1978 hit ``Take This Job and Shove
It,'' claimed self-defense in the shooting. He has been free on
bond for two years while he appealed. But the 4th Ohio District
Court of Appeals this week upheld his conviction.
   Highland County Prosecutor Rocky Coss said the singer could

   Lorimar Telepictures tried to characterize
Valerie Harper as a greedy, insane star going through menopause,
the actress' attorney says.
   Barry Langberg confronted Lorimar television president David
Salzman with the accusation during cross-examination Wednesday in
Lorimar's breach-of-contract lawsuit against Ms. Harper and her
countersuit against the company.
   Salzman adamantly denied that the production company sought to
paint such an image of the 48-year-old actress.
   ``You don't agree with the fact that she was greedy?'' asked
Langberg.
   ``I don't agree,'' said Salzman.
   ``Do you agree with the fact that she was insane?'' asked the
attorney.
   ``She said she was insane,'' he replied. Langberg then repeated
the question and Salzman answered, ``I think at times ... she acted
as if she was going insane.''
   ``What about going through a change of life?'' asked Langberg.
   ``No,'' replied Salzman. But he acknowledged that he had written
the words, ``Change of life'' at the top of a page of notes he took
on negotiation meetings with Ms. Harper over her series,
``Valerie.''
   Lorimar ultimately replaced Ms. Harper with Sandy Duncan and
changed the name of the series to ``The Hogan Family.''
   Ms. Harper says she was wrongfully fired. Lorimar says she broke
her contract.

<HEAD>Party Membership Declines For First Time In Two Decades</HEAD>
<DATELINE>STANFORD, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The number of people throughout the
world who belong to the Communist Party declined slightly from 1986
to 1987, according to the Hoover Institution.
   Total membership decreased from 89.8 million in 1986 to 88.6
million the following year, the conservative think tank at Stanford
University reported in its 1988 Yearbook on Communist Affairs.
   That compares with a 7.6 percent increase in party membership
from 1985 to 1986, the yearbook reported. The publication also has
recorded a leap of more than 70 percent in international Communist
membership since the early 1970s, when the total was about 50
million.
   The small drop from 1986 to 1987 indicates that Communists
around the world are fed up with the Soviet Union, said yearbook
editor Richard Staar.
   ``(It) can be attributed to several factors. ... Most important
is the openly admitted failure of the politico-economic system in
the U.S.S.R.,'' he said.
   ``The system has failed. It no longer serves as a model, even
for Eastern Europe,'' Staar added.
   Another factor is the increased exposure of young people living
in Communist countries to ``the success of capitalist governments
around the world,'' Staar said.
   But while there may be fewer Communists throughout the world,
there are more in California, the party said.
   ``We have found a tremendous renewed interest in Marxism and the
Communist Party in the last year,'' said Kendra Alexander,
chairwoman of the California Communist Party.
   ``Our own membership, while admittedly not very large, has
climbed by about 250 members to about 1,000 people,'' she said.

<HEAD>Justice Department's Ethics Program Faulted</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOAN MOWER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Congressional investigators are faulting the
Justice Department for not routinely evaluating its ethics program
or providing enough training on ethics.
   The General Accounting Office, in a report released Wednesday,
also said the Justice Department is the only federal agency that
does not require many of its employees to file confidential
financial disclosure forms.
   ``Other agencies have found such reports to be a necessary part
of their ethics program,'' the GAO said.
   High-ranking Justice employees, like those at other agencies,
must submit public financial disclosure forms under the 1978 Ethics
in Government Act.
   But every agency except Justice requires civil servants with
significant duties and responsibilities to file the confidential
forms listing assets, investments and a spouse's job.
   ``This deviation from the practice elsewhere in the government
is based on Justice's view that there has been no legal authority
to require confidential reports since January 1979 when the Ethics
in Government Act of 1978 took effect,'' said the GAO, Congress'
auditing arm.
   Justice officials have said they will ask for the confidential
forms when the Office of Government Ethics, which monitors the act,
submits final regulations, possibly this fall.
   An official at the ethics office said Justice was the only
agency that has balked at the confidential forms.
   ``We have recognized for years that they (Justice Department
officials) desperately need a confidential system,'' said the
official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. ``They are the main
law enforcement branch; they should have it.''
   The GAO said the overall Justice ethics program ``contains many
of the basic elements required by law and regulations. ... However,
certain required elements are missing.''
   Ethics programs are handled by the various divisions of the
Justice Department. Allegations of ethical misconduct are reported
to the Office of Professional Responsibility, which reports to the
attorney general.
   As a result of the decentralization, procedures on how to
implement ethics programs differ at the department. ``For example,
some components' procedures for reviewing public financial
disclosure reports were more comprehensive than others,'' the
report said.
   Moreover, Justice ``has not periodically evaluated the ethics
program and not all of the Justice components have provided formal
ethics training.''
   Without proper evaluation, department officials are unable to
determine if various divisions are ``properly reviewing and
certifying public financial disclosure reports,'' the GAO said.
   The report suggests periodic evaluations of the department's
ethics programs, and a new program to train Justice employees in
ethics and standards of conduct matters, including post-employment.
   The report was released as Attorney General Richard L.
Thornburgh assumes command of the department with a promise to
review the department's operations thoroughly.
   Thornburgh succeeded Edwin Meese III, whose ethical conduct is
still under review by the department's Office of Professional
Responsibility.
   The report was requested last December by Reps. William D. Ford,
D-Mich., and Gerry Sikorski, D-Minn. Ford is chairman of the House
Post Office and Civil Service Committee; Sikorski chairs a
subcommittee on human resources.
   Sikorski said at the time that his panel observed that Justice
``has failed to maintain an effective system of preventing ethics
violations by DOJ (Department of Justice) employees.''
   He cited questions about Meese's stock holdings in seven
regional telephone companies, and a June 1987 letter by Meese's
wife Ursula to a federal judge in Tennessee requesting leniency for
a family friend who was awaiting sentencing.
   Meese's activities were investigated by independent counsel
James C. McKay, who concluded that Meese probably broke tax and
conflict-of-interest regulations, but said there was not enough
information to prosecute.
   Meese said McKay's report vindicated him.

   Police arrested 25 city parking authority workers
in breaking up a ring that bilked Paris out of up to $3.1 million
in parking meter receipts over two years, authorities said.
   Police said Wednesday they discovered nearly two tons of

hidden in a house in the Paris region on Tuesday.
   The arrests were made Tuesday and Wednesday, and more may come

   Paris has had pay parking since 1971. The individual meters,
however, have been phased out and replaced by about 6,000
coin-operated machines that provide timed cards which drivers
display inside the windshield of their vehicles. Policemen then
ticket violators.
   Police did not say how the money collectors managed to skim off
coins from the machines without drawing the attention of the city's
accountants.

<HEAD>EPA Calls For Strict Dumpsite Regulations to Protect Groundwater
Supplies</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID GOELLER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The long arm of the Environmental Protection
Agency is reaching out to the local town dump _ and the huge
metropolitan landfill as well.
   EPA, in its first major effort to regulate the land disposal of
household trash and garbage, is proposing rules that officials say
would force nearly every municipal dump to take steps to protect
the environment.
   Announced Wednesday, the plan would require all of the nation's
municipal solid waste landfills to install often-expensive
monitoring equipment to detect pollution of groundwater supplies.
   The proposal, not expected to be popular with local governments,
would require the cleaning up of dumps found to be leaking
contaminants into underground aquifers.
   The draft regulations would force operators to put waterproof
covers over dumps when they are closed and would set restrictions
on where a new dump can be located.
   Many dumps that open after the rules take effect, probably not
before 1991, would have to install bottom liners to prevent leakage
and have systems to collect the polluting liquids found in dumps.
   ``It's a very strong protective rule,'' said J. Winston Porter,
assistant EPA administrator for solid waste and emergency response.
``In some cases, people are going to have to spend a lot of
(compliance) money.''
   The plan would leave many compliance details up to states, so
long as a dump did not impose any greater danger to humans than a
1-in-10,000 chance of contracting cancer from water contaminated by
a dump's leachate.
   Porter told a news conference that states would have flexibility
to operate their own compliance programs with an underlying
proviso: ``We don't care what you do, but you cannot leak.''
   The proposal would apply to an estimated 6,000 solid waste
landfills _ 78 percent of them owned by local governments _ that
handle about 80 percent of the 160 million tons of household refuse
produced each year, he said.
   At least one of every four municipal dumps is believed to be
violating one or more state groundwater-protection standards, he
said.
   Porter said the dangers posed by municipal dumps can be seen in
the ``Superfund'' priority cleanup list, where nearly one of every
five facilities awaiting decontamination was once a municipal solid
waste landfill.
   Around the nation, less than a third of the operating dumps have
groundwater monitoring systems, only 15 percent have bottom liners
and only 5 percent have leachate collection systems, according to
EPA.
   ``Almost all landfills will have to do something,'' Porter said.
``There are very few landfills that meet all these requirements.''
   He said he could not estimate precisely how much cost would be
added to the nation's annual $4 billion to $5 billion bill for
dumping, burning and recycling its trash and garbage.
   One EPA control scenario estimated the extra cost could reach
$800 million a year, or about $11 per household.
   ``It will add something to the homeowner's bill,'' Porter said.
``We don't think it will be dramatic.''
   He said he expects positive reaction from states because they
will have flexibility to structure their dump-control programs to
meet particular hydrogeologic and topographical conditions.
   ``I think we'll get two other reactions: local governments will
say this is too expensive and environmental groups will say it
isn't strong enough,'' Porter said.
   He said the higher dump operating costs under the proposed rules
could nudge local governments to make greater efforts to recycle
trash, a move that could aid EPA's national goal of recycling 25
percent of all household refuse.
   EPA expects to take a year to obtain public comment on the
proposal before making it final, Porter said. Dumps would then have
18 more months before they had to comply with the requirements.
   He said some dumps might close to evade the proposed rules, a
move he acknowledged would leave them without leakproof covers
unless they are in one of the handful of states that now require
them.

   World output of poultry meat is up 3 percent
this year and is expected to gain further in 1989, according to the
Agriculture Department.
   A survey of 51 major producing countries by the department's
Foreign Agricultural Service released Wednesday showed 1988 poultry
meat production at 30.12 million metric tons, up from 29.21 million
last year. The forecast for 1989 is for 31.09 million tons.
   The European Economic Community and the United States account
for most of this year's increase, while Brazil will be a major
contributor in 1989, the report said.
   Six countries in addition to the 12-nation EEC account for 23.1
million tons of this year's poultry meat total and 23.8 million
tons of the 1989 forecast.
   Looking at the 1989 forecast, the report showed U.S. production
at 9.79 million tons; Brazil, 2 million; Canada, 700,000; EEC, 6.01
million; Hungary, 500,000; Soviet Union, 3.3 million; and Japan,
1.5 million.
   Other countries, not listed, are expected to account for 7.29
million tons of the 1989 forecast of 31.09 million tons.
   World egg production is expected to be up 1 percent this year,
with the largest increase in the Soviet Union. Production is
expected to grow more slowly in 1989, the report said.
   In a related report, the department said U.S. egg production in
July dropped 2 percent from a year earlier to 5.68 billion eggs.
The total number of laying hens declined to 268 million birds, down
3 percent from July 1987.
   However, July production per hen was up, averaging 2,118 eggs
per 100 birds, compared with 2,097 a year earlier.

   The Agriculture Department says commercial
flower growers will have a new, genetically engineered dwarf
version of the long-stemmed lisianthus next spring.
   Roger H. Lawson of the department's Agricultural Research
Service said Wednesday the deep-purple lisianthus may be the first
commercial flower developed through biotechnology research.
   The dwarf lisianthus will be sold as a potted plant, rather than
seed, and will be available in April 1989, he said. It will be made
available by the Society of American Florists and USDA.
   Lawson, who heads up a new floral crops program funded jointly
by USDA and the floral society, said the new plant bears several
tulip-sized blooms at once, is a 6- to 10-inch mutation of a
2-foot-tall lisianthus that is popular in many parts of the world
as a cut flower.
   Wild lisianthus grows throughout the American prairie region, he
said.

family alleges.
   The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration opened an
investigation Wednesday into 1.7 million Ford Escort and Mercury
Lynx cars to determine if the rear seat belts are safe. The agency
turned down a request by the child's family that the cars be
recalled immediately.
   ``Everything I know tells me that study on top of study means
finesse,'' said Harold Sakayan, a Washington attorney for the
family of James Garrett, who was crippled at age 11 in the 1985
crash of a Ford Escort. ``It puts it on the back burner for
awhile.''
   He accused the agency of seeking to placate congressional
critics while deferring action on the issue until after the next
president is inaugurated.
   Garrett in January filed a petition for recall of the 1984-1988
cars on behalf of the child's parents, Larry and Patricia Garrett
of La Plata, Md.
   The couple alleged a strap retainer caused the seat belt to ride
around their child's waist rather than the hips. When the car in
which they were riding smashed head-on into a tractor-trailer, the
seat belt cut through the soft tissue to their son's spine, they
said.
   The Garretts in January won a $3.3 million judgment against Ford
for their child's injuries.
   NHTSA said in a letter to the Garretts' attorneys that a limited
technical review had left the agency ``unable to conclude that the
strap retainer has had an adverse effect on the performance of the
system.''
   The agency said the Lynx and Escort seat belts met federal
safety standards, but added, ``Testing did indicate that the ...
rear safety belts with and without the strap retainer fit
differently on test subjects compared to rear safety belts in some
other cars.''
   The agency ordered a mid-level investigation, an engineering
analysis, to probe the safety effects of the belts' fit.
   Ford said it believes the belts are safe. ``They meet or exceed
all federal motor vehicle safety standard performance requirements,
including those for location, fit, strength and ease of use,'' Ford
said.
   ``We are confident that the agency, too, will conclude that no
safety-related defect is involved,'' Ford said.
   In the 1985 accident, near Annapolis, Md., a second back-seat
passenger, 14-year-old Christopher Gaboury, was killed. The two
front-seat occupants were hospitalized after the accident but
escaped crippling injury, even though the passenger compartment
crumpled in the collision.
   The accident and subsequent lawsuit prompted public questioning
of the safety of rear-seat safety belts, particularly those with
the unusual design found in the Escort and Lynx.
   Belts that ride against the hips are braced on a large mass of
bone in an accident, keeping the passenger anchored while avoiding
damage to the spine. Belts that ride above the hip under the impact
of a crash can slice through the body's soft tissue to the spine,
resulting in paralysis or death.
   NHTSA said its strong recommendation that seat belts be used
remains unchanged.
   ``Whether it be at the front or the rear, ... you are far better
off wearing any kind of belt than no belt at all, and that is based
on studies of hundreds of thousands of accidents and fatalities and
injuries,'' said Ron DeFore, NHTSA spokesman.

<HEAD>Plants `Crying' Out for Water</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   This summer's drought has caused plants
literally to ``cry'' out for water as they wither, and scientists
are trying to determine if their sounds _ too highly pitched for
the human ear _ are attracting destructive insects.
   Department researchers have been using electronic gadgets for
more than four years to hear corn and other drought-stressed plants
make noises as cell structures, or water tubes, break down from a
lack of water traveling from roots to the leaves.
   When there is adequate water in the soil, the water and
nutrients flow upward in the tubes under tension. If the soil lacks
enough water, the tension becomes too great and the tubes fracture.
   One potential benefit from this kind of research would be new
ways of letting irrigation farmers know precisely when to water
their fields. Also it could aid in developing new plant varieties,
which would be better equipped to move water and nutrients from
roots to leaves.
   Robert Haack, an entomologist at the department's North Central
Forest Experiment Station, East Lansing, Mich., and a colleague,
Bill Mattson, think there might be a connection between the noises
and flocking of some insects, such as bark beetles, to
drought-damaged trees.
   The noises are called ultrasonic acoustic emissions, and are in
the 100-kilohertz range, while sound heard by humans is no more
than about 20 kilohertz.
   While the ultrasonic emissions have been documented, their role
in attracting insects remains only an educated guess.
   Haack, the research leader, said in a telephone interview
Wednesday from his East Lansing office, that he thought it was ``a
neat idea'' that the noises of stricken trees might attract insects.
   ``We're just starting up'' on the tree-insect project, he said.
``We don't have enough to make any speculation on what we might
find.''
   Haack said insects have been known for a long time to be
attracted by certain influences such as color and scent. But Haack
said that to the best of his knowledge there has not been
conclusive work linking the ultrasound of trees to insect behavior.
   The project only got under way three weeks ago, he said. A lot
of time has been spent rounding up necessary equipment, part of it
borrowed from other laboratories near Michigan State University,
where the Forest Service operation is located.
   ``It could turn out that these sounds do attract insects,''
Haack said. ``Or it might not ... or it might be a combination of
things.''
   In any case, Haack is starting by depriving potted white pine
seedlings of water and recording their ultrasounds. The next step
will be to see if the recorded sounds attract beetles.
   Eventually, Haack hopes to see what role the tree sounds play in
the choice of sites for beetles to mate and lay eggs.

<HEAD>Reagan Says Quayle Experienced on Military Issues</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SUSANNE M. SCHAFER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Reagan came to the defense of GOP
vice presidential candidate Dan Quayle by claiming that the junior
senator from Indiana has more experience on military issues than
Democrat Michael Dukakis.
   Reagan, appearing Wednesday at a rally with Vice President
George Bush, offered his lengthiest comments to date about Quayle
since the vice president tapped the 41-year-old last week as his
running mate.
   Since the announcement was made, Bush and Quayle have been
dogged by questions about the conservative senator's use of family
connections to help him join the National Guard and avoid the draft
when many young Americans were being sent into combat in the
Vietnam War.
   Although Reagan made no mention of the flap, he opened his
remarks by praising Bush and adding, ``I like your running mate,
too.
   ``He has had many more years of experience dealing with national
security affairs than the head of the other ticket,'' Reagan said.
   The president lauded Quayle's work on a major job training bill
without mentioning that Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass.,
co-sponsored the measure.
   ``Dan Quayle stands for the same principles as George Bush and I
do,'' the president said.
   ``And he has the most important qualification of all for a
co-pilot _ he won't be trying to turn the plane in one direction
while the pilot is flying it in the other.''
   Reagan argued that Bush is well-prepared for the presidency
after eight years in the co-pilot's seat.
   ``I once said that he is a great vice president, but I know and
I've seen that it didn't come easily. George Bush is a man of
action _ a man accustomed to command,'' Reagan said.
   The president offered no examples of duties he'd handed the vice
president, but said that ``day in, day out, I've sought George
Bush's counsel.''
   Reagan, as he has in several campaign appearances here amidst
his annual August vacation in California, poked fun at the
Democratic ticket, calling it ``a three-headed ticket that doesn't
know left from center.''
   The president has often referred to the Democrats as running a
triumvirate for the White House, attempting to paint Jesse Jackson
as an unseen but powerful force in the campaign of Dukakis and his
running mate Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas.
   The president, who is scheduled to undergo a battery of annual
eye, ear, nose and throat exams during his week-long stay in Los
Angeles, has no public events until Saturday, when he is scheduled
to take part in two fund-raisers for the California GOP and Rep.
Robert Lagomarsino, R-Calif.
   Afterwards, Reagan and his wife, Nancy, are to return to their
Santa Barbara ranch until after Labor Day.

<TEXT>
   Patrick D. Kelly spent hundreds of
dollars to beat a traffic ticket for running a red light, but said
he is glad to have his name cleared, even if it took 2{ years and
11 court appearances.
   The 35-year-old house painter said his battle cost him more than
$2,000, of which he expects to get back only $171.50 from the city
in repayment of the fine and court costs.
   A Jefferson County Circuit jury Tuesday acquitted Kelley after
less than 10 minutes deliberations.
   ``I almost broke into tears,'' he said. ``I guess it shows truth
will prevail. The system does work, if you fight it long enough.''
   Kelley, who received the citation in March 1986, was convicted
in Municipal Court two months later. He appealed, saying the
citation contained several errors, including identifying him as
black rather than white.
   On Tuesday, Judge Mike McCormick offered to dismiss that case,
but Kelley said he wanted his name cleared by a jury.
   Officer A.W. Ellis testified the mistakes he made on the
citation probably occurred when carbon paper in his ticket book
accidentally transferred information from another ticket.

<HEAD>Bush Campaign Gives No Definite Date For Debate</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DONALD M. ROTHBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Political Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rival presidential candidates George Bush and
Michael Dukakis are saying they want to debate this fall but sound
far from agreement on when or where or how often they will meet.
   ``Vice President George Bush will debate his opponent this
fall,'' said a brief statement Wednesday from the Bush campaign.
But the announcement also said it was ``unlikely that a debate can
occur prior to Sept. 20.''
   That brought an outraged reaction from Dukakis campaign chairman
Paul Brountas, who accused the Bush campaign of ``seeking to
unilaterally reject'' debates scheduled for Sept. 8 in Birmingham,
Ala., and Sept. 14, in Annapolis, Md.
   Brountas said the Bush campaign decision not to accept the
earlier dates ``threatens the full schedule of debates anticipated
for the fall. It is a transparent effort to limit the number of
debates.''
   Dukakis, during a stop in Michigan, said flatly, ``I'm going to
be in Annapolis on the 14th with or without him.''
   The Birmingham debate is being sponsored by the League of Women
Voters, the Annapolis forum by the bipartisan National Commission
on Presidential Debates.
   A Bush spokesman said that while the Republican presidential
nominee had said long ago he would debate his Democratic opponent,
he had never agreed to any specific events.
   Bush campaign chairman James A. Baker III is expected to meet
with Brountas in Washington next week to negotiate the debate
format.
   The campaign statement said they would discuss ``sponsorship,
timing, ground rules and other related matters.''
   The announcement said Bush aides were confident ``the two
campaigns would be able to work out the details of the debate
schedule between themselves.''
   It also said the campaign ``thanked the groups and organizations
which had offered to help expedite the process.''
   Brountas retorted: ``Mr. Baker stated that the campaign is not
prepared for a debate prior to Sept. 20. This is inexcusable. The
presidential commission debates have been scheduled for over a year
and the vice president has known he would be his party's nominee
for more than five months. ...
   ``The American people have a right to the full schedule of these
debates as agreed upon by the two national political parties.''
   Dukakis added during a campaign stop in Cleveland: ``After seven
years of on-the-job training, it seems to me that he ought to be
able to go to work and debate the issues. ... The vice president
has been saying a lot about defense and national security, and I'm
ready to debate him.''
   Bush campaign spokesman Mark Goodin said: ``There were never any
commitments made on specifics of a debate schedule. We've been very
specific in saying the vice president wants to debate Governor
Dukakis.''

<HEAD>AFL-CIO Hopes to Deliver Huge Margin of Union Votes to Dukakis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MATT YANCEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Labor Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The AFL-CIO is gearing up a drive to deliver
Democrat Michael Dukakis a margin of at least 2{ million votes
among its 14 million members on Election Day.
   Presidents of 87 of the labor federation's 91 affiliated unions
gave the Massachusetts governor an unqualified endorsement
Wednesday.
   Union political operatives said the first step in their campaign
for Dukakis is to make sure that 85 percent to 90 percent of union
members and other voters in their families are registered, compared
with 72 percent of the voting age population as a whole in the last
presidential election.
   ``You need about six weeks in most states to have an effective
drive,'' said John Perkins, the labor federation's political
director. Perkins will head the effort using computers at AFL-CIO
headquarters here.
   The next step will use computers to track individual members'
concerns on various issues, with letters sent to them on Dukakis'
position on those issues. The aim is to obtain at least 65 percent
to 70 percent turnout Nov. 8.
   AFL-CIO President Lane Kirkland estimated the federation's
endorsement of Walter Mondale in 1984 was worth a net 2 million
votes despite exit polls showing that as many as 47 percent of
voters from union households cast their ballots for President
Reagan.
   ``Our rule of thumb is that we have to do two-thirds or better
in order to be successful in the election,'' Kirkland said. ``We
fell short of that. I'm reasonably confident that the results this
time will be improved.''
   United Steel Workers President Lynn Williams said winning
passage of a law requiring employers to give 60 days advance notice
of plant closings and layoffs has renewed labor's confidence going
into the campaign's final 11 weeks.
   ``In the primaries, we had our members running (as potential
delegates to national conventions) on behalf of every Democratic
candidate, but we have a very united position now in the Steel
Workers, and my sense is it's that way across the labor movement,''
Williams said.
   Owen Bieber, the president of the United Auto Workers, said a
poll of his members by the American Arbitration Association showed
a 96.9 percent level of support for Dukakis.
   ``And that was before Dan Quayle,'' Bieber said, referring to
the Indiana senator tapped last week as the GOP vice presidential
nominee and the controversy since then on his use of family
connections to help him avoid the Vietnam War draft.
   Quayle led the Reagan administration's opposition on Capitol
Hill to the plant closing notices law and has one of the lowest
pro-labor voting records _ 9 percent _ in the Senate.
   Labor leaders acknowledged that an overwhelming majority of
their rank-and-file probably are unaware of Quayle's role in
defeating union-sought labor legislation over the past seven years.
   One of their missions between now and Election Day, they said,
is to educate their members on Quayle's votes.
   ``At this point I just hope he's not forced off the ticket,''
Rachelle Horowitz, political director for the American Federation
of Teachers, said of Quayle. ``I want him out there campaigning.''
   Bush campaign spokesman Mark Goodin called the AFL-CIO's
endorsement of Dukakis ``a classic dog bites man story.''
   ``Every four years the AFL-CIO trots out what has become an
obligatory endorsement of a Democratic presidential candidate and
1988 is obviously no exception,'' Goodin said.
   Among those unions abstaining in Wednesday's endorsement was the
largest, the 1.6 million-member Teamsters, which endorsed Ronald
Reagan in 1980 and 1984 after making no presidential endorsement in
1976.
   Newly installed Teamster President William McCarthy of Boston,
who according to union sources dislikes Dukakis, said he is
withholding an endorsement until a mail poll of his members is
completed Sept. 16.
   Asked if the Teamsters might endorse Bush, a union official
said, ``I just don't see it.''
   ``If the poll comes back strong for Dukakis, we'll probably
endorse him,'' said the Teamster official, who spoke on condition
of anonymity. ``If it's close, we'll probably remain neutral.''
   The 30,000-member Air Line Pilots Association said it was
delaying an endorsement until after its convention next month. The
40,000-member Marine Engineers union also voted to abstain,
reaffirming its decades-old policy of making no presidential
endorsements.
   The Newspaper Guild qualified its endorsement, voting 4,000 of
its 25,390 members as abstaining primarily because of opposition by
its 1,000-member Wire Service Guild local to taking sides in the
election.

<TEXT>
   The United States and the Soviet Union have
agreed tentatively to extend their grain deal for another year
while trying to complete a new, longer-range accord, a U.S.
official says.
   The official, who asked not to be identified, said Wednesday
that the two countries agreed through diplomatic channels last week
on an extension that is essentially identical to the current pact.
   A second official insisted that no final agreement had been
reached, but said he believed that one could be completed shortly.
   ``We feel like we made some progress, but we're still far apart
on pricing, minimums and things of that nature,'' Thomas Kay, chief
of the Department of Agriculture's Foreign Agricultural Service,
said of the first three U.S.-Soviet negotiating sessions.
   Kay said the two countries are trying to schedule a fourth
meeting.
   ``I'm optimistic at the next session we'll reach an agreement,''
he said.
   Under the current five-year pact, which expires Sept. 30, the
Soviets must buy at least 9 million tons of U.S. grain annually.
   The grain deal benefits American farmers, now experiencing
severe drought problems, and the Soviet Union, which often looks to
the West for grain even though it has had a good harvest this year.
   Last month, the Agriculture Department estimated that the
Soviets would have a bumper harvest of 215 million metric tons,
which would be their third best crop ever. The Soviets are
importing grain to build up their stockpiles and to feed expanding
livestock herds.
   The Soviets already have been given permission to purchase more
than 12 million tons of grain for this year. As of last month, they
had bought more than 5 million tons of corn, more than 9 million
tons of wheat, 830,700 tons of soybeans and 1.3 million tons of
soybean meal.

   A genetically engineered AIDS vaccine made
with the virus used in smallpox vaccinations soon will be tested on
volunteers at six university medical centers, the National
Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases says.
   Each of the medical centers will recruit nine volunteers to
first determine the vaccine's safety and its ability to produce an
immune response.
   There is no chance of contracting AIDS from the vaccine since it
contains no live or killed human immunodeficiency virus that causes
the deadly disease, the institute said Wednesday.
   The volunteers must be healthy men or women who pass a blood
test showing they are not infected with the virus that causes AIDS
and ``who are not engaged in behavior that would place them at high
risk of contracting HIV,'' the institute said.
   While the institute is conducting numerous research projects to
find effective drugs to treat HIV victims, this is only the second
vaccine to be approved for testing. The first study began a year
ago.
   ``We are quite a distance away from getting a vaccine that would
be approved for general use,'' said Elaine Baldwin, spokeswoman for
the institute. ``It is estimated we will not have an AIDS vaccine
until the mid-1990s.''
   The vaccine is produced by using live vaccinia virus, which has
been used for years as a smallpox vaccination. That disease has now
been wiped out worldwide.
   At each of the six centers, six volunteers will receive the AIDS
vaccine and three will receive vaccinia vaccine alone, as a
control. Neither the volunteers nor the physicians conducting the
test will know which vaccine each person is receiving until data is
analyzed.
   The medical centers that will conduct the studies are the
University of Maryland, Baltimore; Johns Hopkins University,
Baltimore; Vanderbilt University, Nashville, Tenn.; University of
Rochester (New York); Baylor College of Medicine, Houston; and
Marshall University, Huntington, W.Va.
   Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome attacks the body's immune
system, rendering it incapable of resisting other diseases and
infections. AIDS most often is spread through close contact with
blood, blood products or semen from infected persons. Its chief
victims have been homosexual men and intravenous drug users.
   As of Monday, AIDS had been diagnosed in 71,171 Americans, of
whom more than half, or 40,090, have died, according to the federal
Centers for Disease Control. No one is known to have recovered from
AIDS.

   A deputy police chief resigned under fire
Wednesday as the police commissioner issued a report blaming him
and other brass for a riot at a park that led to 100 complaints of
police brutality.
   Deputy Chief Thomas Darcy, a 31-year police veteran, commanded
hundreds of police officers who were deployed to defuse a
demonstration at Tompkins Square Park on Manhattan's Lower East
Side on Aug. 6.
   The demonstration _ against a 1 a.m. curfew at the park _ turned
violent and more than 50 people were hurt in clashes between police
and protesters. More than 100 charges of police brutality were
later filed with the Civilian Complaint Review Board.
   Commissioner Benjamin Ward's report said a lack of supervision
was responsible for ``the appalling behavior of some members of the
department.''
   ``The control of the situation was lost during the first
confrontation between police and demonstrators and never
sufficiently regained,'' wrote Chief of Department Robert J.
Johnston, who prepared the 16-page report.
   ``For this Chief Darcy, the highest-ranking member of the
department at the scene, must be held accountable.''
   The other two supervisory officers at the confrontation, Deputy
Inspector Joseph Wodarski and Capt. Gerald McNamara, also were
disciplined.
   Wodarski was the ranking officer at the scene during a crucial
period when Darcy returned to his office about a dozen blocks away
to go to the bathroom, but he deferred all major decisions to
McNamara.
   ``Unfortunately,'' the report said, ``Capt. McNamara's actions
were not well planned, staffed, supervised or executed. Unnecessary
confrontations resulted, which culminated in a riot.''
   A key mistake, according to Ward, was McNamara's decision, at
the beginning of the demonstration, to transmit an emergency signal
that mobilized 300 police officers from all over the city without
making any provisions for adequate supervision of the officers.
   Even after Darcy returned to the park, the mobilization call was
never taken off the air. As a result, officers continued to pour
into the area, further confusing the situation, Ward said.
   Wodarski was reassigned from his prestigious post as commanding
officer of the Midtown South Precinct to another, as a command in
Queens.
   McNamara will be temporarily removed from his job commanding the
9th Precinct for a six- to seven-month retraining period, Ward
said. During that time, the East Village Precinct house will be
placed under the command of Inspector Elson Gelfand.
   The Civilian Complaint Review Board has already identified
several officers involved in the melee, relying in part on
videotapes taken by neighborhood residents. The videotapes show
police officers, some of whom covered or removed their badges,
striking demonstrators for no apparent reason.
   The board recommended that charges be brought against two
officers, both of whom were placed on modified assignment Wednesday
pending outcome of a departmental trial.
   Darcy, 56, had been criticized anonymously shortly after the
riot when Ward cited the decision by the ranking officer at the
park to leave the scene to go to the bathroom at a crucial moment.
The commissioner had said that was one of 10 mistakes that led to
the melee.
   Darcy was trained in crowd control during the 1960s as a member
of the Tactical Patrol Force. The New York Police Department was
widely praised in those years for developing tactics that helped
the city avoid the wide-scale civil disorder that plagued many
other big cities.

<TEXT>
   The California lotto machine that selects
winning numbers jammed Wednesday night during a drawing for a $38
million jackpot, one of the nation's largest gambling windfalls.
   Lottery officials, following disaster recovery guidelines,
hastily conducted another televised drawing a half hour after the
regular time.
   ``There are procedures to handle this sort of thing and they
were followed,'' said Bob Taylor, the lottery's top spokesman at
Sacramento headquarters.
   The first, incomplete drawing was ruled invalid, Taylor said. A
drawing announcer called out the number 33 during the initial
drawing but no ball bearing the number rolled out of the machine.
   At the outset of the second drawing, the announcer said, ``We've
reloaded the machine and are beginning a new drawing.''
   The reason the device failed was still being investigated,
lottery officials said. It was the first failure in the 22-month
history of the game.
   Before the first drawing, Californians were grabbing $1 lotto
tickets at an estimated average rate of more than 500 a second.
   ``The lines are unreal. People who normally buy $5 worth of
tickets are buying $20 worth,'' said Anaheim liquor store owner
Mike Notery Sr. ``Anybody with money to spend is thinking, nothing
ventured, nothing gained.''
   The fast pace of sales left lottery officials unsure of the
exact jackpot total. Officials expected to determine Thursday
whether there was a winner, and verify that person's identity later.
   If nobody picked the correct six numbers out of a choice of 49
numbers, the jackpot will be added to Saturday's drawing, said
officials.

   Mayor W. Wilson Goode circumvented the city
prison board and ordered condoms distributed to inmates as part of
an AIDS prevention program in Philadelphia jails.
   On Monday, the board voted 3-2 with one abstention against
making condoms available to prisoners, despite pleas from health
officials and testimony from an inmate suffering from the deadly
disease.
   Goode said Wednesday his program, which takes effect Sept. 1,
also includes anonymous AIDS testing, counseling and treatment of
prisoners.
   Prison board member M. Mark Mendel, an attorney who strongly
opposes distributing condoms, said Goode had the prerogative to
circumvent the board.
   Mendel said he opposed the proposal because the law prohibits
sex between prisoners.
   ``We're sending mixed signals,'' he said.
   He also said he doubted that prisoners will use the condoms,
especially in cases of rape.
   ``A prisoner with AIDS is an animal'' who would not care whether
his sex partner has protection from the disease, Mendel said.
   Mendel said only eight prisoners in the city's jails have been
diagnosed as having acquired immune deficiency syndrome, indicating
that ``prisons are not AIDS factories.''
   David Fair, director of AIDS programs for the city Health
Department, said earlier this week that two prisoners have died
from the disease. He said the number of prisoners infected with the
AIDS virus would be difficult to estimate but could total more than
half of the 3,700 in custody.
   During a two-hour discussion before Monday night's vote, Public
Health Commissioner Maurice C. Clifford urged approval of the
policy, saying sexual activity was rampant in the city's jails.
   ``We are not condoning sexual activity,'' Clifford said. ``We
are saying it is taking place ... and the best protection against
AIDS is using a condom.''

<HEAD>Ursula Meese's China Travel Prompts Clarification of Justice Trip
Guidelines</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Justice Department should not have allowed
former Attorney General Edwin Meese III's wife to accept a free
trip to China last year, the Office of Government Ethics says.
   ``The bottom line is, if the Department of Justice considers it
an official function, then the Department of Justice must pick up
the tab for its own employees,'' said Don Campbell, a spokesman at
the ethics office.
   Ursula Meese accepted the all-expenses-paid trip as a guest of
People-To-People International of Kansas City, a non-profit
organization.
   She and Deborah Morris, the wife of Joseph Morris, head of the
office of liaison services, accompanied their husbands to an
international legal seminar after Justice officials said it was
proper for them to do so, Campbell said.
   ``We disagreed with them in the outcome,'' Campbell said. ``They
analyzed it, and they saw it a little bit differently than we
did.'' Federal regulations prohibit relatives of federal employees
from accepting trips and gifts.
   The Justice Department paid for travel by the attorney general
and other department employees.
   The ethics office plans no more action, Campbell said, terming
the decision on the China trip ``a close call,'' but the office has
sent a letter to Justice spelling out how similar trips should be
handled in the future.
   Five Justice officials, along with Meese _ who resigned Aug. 12
and is now a private citizen _ plan to attend a similar legal
conference in Tokyo between Aug. 29-Sept. 1.
   ``What we basically said was that we are not going to challenge
anything on the China trip, but here is guidance for the Japan
trip,'' Campbell said.
   The Justice employees who are traveling to Japan are Patrick
Korten, the department's chief spokesman; Charles Rule, assistant
attorney general for antitrust; Morris of the liaison office;
Cheryl Nolan, one of Morris' subordinates, and Richard Abell,
director of the office of Justice programs. Mrs. Morris is not
scheduled to go on the trip, a secretary in Morris' office said.
   Deborah Burstion-Wade, a Justice spokeswoman, said the
conference is designed to explore legal and economic relations
between Japan and the United States.

<HEAD>GOP Legislators Say Publicity Has Helped Quayle</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Republican Sen. Dan Quayle, whose
candidacy for the vice presidency has been dogged by controversy,
should be thankful he's not being ignored, say Republican
legislators.
   ``They say that as an elected official, even bad press is good
press,'' said state Delegate Martha Klima of Lutherville, Md.
   Quayle, who spoke to the Southern Legislative Conference on
Wednesday, was unanimously endorsed by fellow Republicans, who said
his troubles actually may help him in the long run.
   ``It has added to the party and I want to thank the press,''
said West Virginia Delegate Robert Jones of Martinsville. ``It's
inviting more questions, and I think the exposure's good.''
   It was one of the first appearances Quayle has made on his own
on the campaign trail since his selection by GOP presidential
nominee George Bush.
   The most persistent questions have been about whether he used
his family's influence to gain a spot in 1969 in the Indiana
National Guard to avoid a tour in Vietnam.
   Kentucky Rep. Ken Harper of Crestview Hills said the publicity
has turned what would have been a two-month job of introducing the
relatively unknown Quayle to the public into a free advertising
campaign.
   ``It's taken a person who was not well-known and made him a
household word,'' Harper said.
   Sen. Lloyd Bentsen of Texas, the Democratic vice presidential
running mate of Michael Dukakis, preceded Quayle on the platform
before the Southern lawmakers.
   Other Southern GOP lawmakers said the attention focused on
Quayle has taken away from the GOP ticket.
   ``I think anytime you spend a lot of time about an ancillary
issue ... obviously it's divisive,'' said Louisiana state Sen. John
Hainkel of New Orleans. ``It hasn't been good because it's taken
the spotlight off the things we ought to be talking about.''
   Kentucky state Rep. Bill Strong of Hazard agreed, saying, ``It's
kind of stymied the ticket. It's dominated the news where Bush
can't get his message across.''
   Georgia state Sen. Jim Tysinger of DeKalb County said the
Democratic ticket also has suffered by the attention paid to Quayle.
   ``It has hurt both of them,'' Tysinger said. ``Dukakis hasn't
been in the news and neither has Bush.''
   No Republican said Quayle's problems are serious enough to
warrant his dismissal from the GOP ticket.
   ``I think it would be terrible to take him off the ticket,''
said Hainkel. ``If I was George Bush, I wouldn't even consider
that. You'd infuriate every man who ever served in the National
Guard for one thing.''
   Many lawmakers thought the news media would suffer the
consequences of a backlash if they continued to harp on Quayle's
service in the National Guard.
   There was unanimous agreement that enough had been said about
the subject.
   ``It's detracted from what the American people need to know,''
said Tennessee state Rep. Edward H. Moody of Morristown.
   ``Maybe we can get on to some of the campaign issues now,''
added Maryland's Klima.

<HEAD>Film On U.S. Racism Poses Advertising Dilemma</HEAD>
<HEAD>LaserPhoto LA1</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN HORN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>HOLLYWOOD (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It's one thing getting filmgoers to watch the
make-believe violence of a ``Nightmare on Elm Street.'' It's
another luring them to witness a true-to-life racial lynching that
mirrors the sickness of their society.
   Yet that's the challenge facing the makers of the explosive
movie ``Betrayed,'' which opens in theaters across the country on
Friday but has already suffered one advertising snafu that left
preview audiences steaming.
   Filled with unbridled bigotry and an all-too-real racial murder,
the film stands as a study in how _ and how not _ to market an
earthshaker.
   ``This movie is enormously difficult,'' says Gordon Weaver, who
is supervising the advertising campaign. ``This is a very tough,
tough film.''
   What makes ``Betrayed,'' directed by Costa-Gavras, a hard sell
is its explicit depiction of U.S. white supremacists _ a topic
audiences might want to avoid. So producer United Artists looked
for another marketing hook within the movie.
   Cut to Debra Winger and Tom Berenger, the film's stars. For
United Artists, the popular pair made for a natural advertising
angle. Thus, in the first ``Betrayed'' posters, or ``one sheets''
as they are called, Winger and Berenger were shown embracing.
   From the looks of the poster, ``Betrayed'' appeared to be a
steamy little film, perhaps an update of ``Jagged Edge,'' which
was, in fact, written by ``Betrayed'' author Joe Eszterhas.
   But preview audiences expecting ``Betrayed'' to resemble an
adventure-packed pulp romance were startled to see a band of
hard-working Midwestern farmers who lead a double life as racist
killers.
   The white supremacists murder a talk-show host reminiscent of
Denver radio personality Alan Berg, who was gunned down in 1985 by
members of The Order. They hunt down and lynch a black youth and
denounce homosexuals, Jews and various ethnic groups.
   In more than one instance, preview audience members
spontaneously erupted in anger, either walking out or speaking out
against the film while it was still on screen. Said one woman at a
Century City screening: ``All white people are not like that!''
   The time was ripe, it seemed, for a new advertising campaign _
the film's future hung in the balance.
   ``What we found out was that people didn't know how to react to
this film,'' said Brenda Farrier, who with Weaver was called in to
consult on the $6 million advertising campaign.
   ``We had to help the audience along and say, `It is going to be
an upsetting film. It is not going to be a musical,''' Farrier
said. The decision was ironic: If the movie were to be popular,
United Artists was saying, people had to be ready to hate what they
saw.
   ``Powerful films do cause people to say, `I don't want to see
this. ... It makes me uncomfortable.' That's the risk that you
run,'' said Tony Thomopoulos, chairman and chief executive officer
of United Artists Pictures.
   Costa-Gavras, a French director, has made a career specializing
in disturbing films such as ``Missing,'' ``State of Siege'' and
``Z.''
   ``When we first started screening the film for people,''
Thomopoulos said, ``we found out that if people were not prepared
for what they were going to see, their reaction was so shocked that
they weren't able to digest it all, and they missed a great deal of
the film. Now we are taking this approach of making people aware.''
   Among the first moves that Farrier and Weaver made was dropping
the sexually tinged poster, which was to have been used as a
newspaper advertisement.
   The poster was replaced with an unusual, unillustrated full-page
ad that ran in newspapers in Los Angeles, New York and Chicago _
but in the hard-news, not entertainment sections.
   The movie, the ad said, is ``a profoundly disturbing and often
shocking motion picture portrait of a hidden part of contemporary
America. It will anger you. It will upset you.''
   A new television ad, which began the first week of August, was
just as blunt: ``It will change the way you think ... forever.''
   Soon, United Artists introduced a television commercial built
around interviews with average-looking moviegoers leaving
screenings. Said one: ``The movie was terrifying.'' Said another:
``It will kick you in the rear end.''
   After that ad ran, United Artists finally began running
commercials that addressed the entire storyline, and Winger and
Berenger were finally revealed to be lovers.
   While reviews and box-office receipts will ultimately prove
whether ``Betrayed'' is an interesting movie, United Artists has,
at least, set the stage.
   Said Weaver: ``All we can do now is wait.''

   French director Costa-Gavras admits he has a
knack for hitting sensitive nerves with his films about political
repression, but he's fascinated by what he sees as dualism in
American society.
   His latest movie, ``Betrayed,'' examines racist paramilitary
groups in the United States, and is likely to come under siege
itself for its depiction of hard-working Midwestern farmers who
lead a double life as racist killers.
   ``As an outsider, that's what fascinates me _ and confuses me _
about this country,'' the 55-year-old director said in a recent
interview. ``You have racism here, especially against outsiders,
yet you can have a presidential candidate who is Greek boy with a
Jewish wife.
   ``You have worked so hard to fight totalitarianism and keep your
democracy, yet your government supports dictators.''
   Costa-Gavras also filmed ``Missing,'' about a right-wing
dictatorship in Chile. Conservative columnist George Will called
the story about a young American who disappeared during the coup
that brought Gen. Augusto Pinochet to power ``a fraud'' and ``a hit
'n run act of cowardice.''
   In ``State of Siege,'' an earlier film shot in Chile during the
regime of Marxist president Salvador Allende, Costa-Gavras offended
the left wing. The Chilean Army refused to cooperate in making the
film, and pro-communist actors quit during the filming, claiming
the movie was pro-CIA.
   ``You have to understand that people of my generation thought we
knew the truth _ the only right way. We learned the hard way that
it wasn't so easy,'' said the Greek-born Costa-Gavras, who now
lives in France.
   ``So when I make movies, I feel it's absolutely important to be
critical of everyone. I don't accept everyone's ideology
automatically.''

<HEAD>Reports: Spy Network Stole Secret Western Military Documents</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   West European authorities detained eight people
involved in a spy ring that supplied the Soviet Union with secret
military documents for at least 10 years, according to published
reports.
   Principals in the newly uncovered ring, which operated through a
German-Hungarian connection, caused a major security loss to the
United States in the late 1970s, The New York Times reported today.
   Officials refused to describe the loss, the Times said.
   Senior officials at the Pentagon and the State Department
learned about the espionage network in the last few days, the
newspaper said.
   Documents concerning NATO defense plans for Europe were believed
stolen as well as the U.S. Army contingency plans for a ground war
in Europe against the Soviet Union, the newspaper said.
   Investigators told the Times they believe that the West
German-based spy ring, aided by couriers in neutral Sweden,
provided documents apparently obtained from U.S. soldiers to the
intelligence agency of Hungary, a Soviet ally.
   The network was uncovered by West German and U.S. officials,
including agents from the FBI and the Army, the Times said. The
Army has about 250,000 military personnel in West Germany at more
than 200 installations.
   The Times said officials did not know how long the network had
been operating.
   The newspaper quoted unidentified U.S. officials as saying
authorities in Sweden and West Germany detained eight people on
Tuesday but that some were brought in only for questioning.
   Those detained included a retired Army sergeant who has been
living in West Germany, the Times said.
   Names of those involved and further details of the case have not
been made public.
   National Swedish television reported Wednesday that security
police in Stockholm arrested three Swedes suspected of spying for
an East European country. The two men and a woman were detained
Tuesday in the southwestern port city of Goteborg and Chief Public
Prosecutor Sven-Olof Hakansson was to ask a court to arraign them
today, the report said.
   The State Department said in a statement, ``We understand that
there has been an apprehension by West German authorities, but do
not consider it appropriate to comment at this time.
   ``Our policy is not to comment on ongoing, sensitive
investigations, particularly when they involve an allied
government,'' said Phyllis E. Oakley, State Department spokeswoman.

   Here, at a glance, are the main issues to be
discussed in the Iran-Iraq cease-fire talks opening today:
</TEXT>
<HEAD>PRISONERS OF WAR</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   The U.N. Security Council's cease-fire Resolution 598 urges that
the POWs ``be released and repatriated without delay after the
cessation of active hostilities'' in accordance with the Geneva
conventions.
   U.N. Secretary-General Perez de Cuellar, who sent a special
mission to the two countries to inquire into the POW situation,
says the actual figure is more than 80,000.
   The all-Swiss International Committee of the Red Cross which
supervises observance of the Geneva Conventions has registered
50,182 POWs in Iranian camps and 19,284 POWs in Iraqi camps.
   Many of the POWs on both sides are expected to refuse
repatriation because they have supported publicly the detaining
power. The Red Cross, which is expected to organize the
repatriation, says it will accept the mandate only if it has access
to every prisoner to make sure he agrees to repatriation.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>WAR GUILT</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Resolution 598 envisions establishment of an ``impartial body''
to investigate the ``responsibility for the conflict.'' Iraq
invaded Iran Sept. 22, 1980, after weeks of border skirmishes and
Iran expects Iraq to be branded as the aggressor. Iraq says it
acted after assassination attempts against its leaders by
pro-Iranian extremists and Iranian calls for the overthrow of the
Iraqi leadership.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>BORDERS</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Resolution 598 refers to the withdrawal of all forces ``to the
internationally recognized borders without delay.'' Iran holds that
the 737- mile common border was delineated in a treaty concluded in
1975 between the two countries during the rule of Shah Reza Pahlavi.
   In particular, that treaty granted Iran its long-sought claim to
the eastern half of the 127-mile Shatt al-Arab, the confluence of
the Euphrates and Tigris rivers and Iraq's only access to the open
sea.
   That waterway has been the subject of border disputes for
centuries. Iraq unilaterally repudiated the 1975 treaty on Sept.
17, 1980, five days before its forces crossed into Iran.
   President Saddam Hussein called the waterway ``totally Iraqi and
totally Arab.'' On Sept. 23, 1980, Iraq announced three territorial
conditions for ending the war _ Iranian recognition of Iraqi claims
to the entire waterway, to water rights to rivers flowing from Iran
to Iraq, and to three Persian Gulf islands seized by Iran in 1971.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>REPARATIONS</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   In 1985, Iran officially assessed the cost of its war damage as
$350 billion and announced it would seek reparations. An Iranian
newspaper earlier this month on estimated total losses due to the
war at $600 billion. There has been no recent official claim by
Tehran. Iraq has not issued an official assessment of war damages.
Resolution 598, which calls for a ``comprehensive, just and
honorable settlement,'' makes no direct reference to reparations.

<DATELINE>WILLIAMSTOWN, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   His 1962 novel ``The Graduate''
became a smash-hit movie evoking the discontent of a generation fed
up with materialism. Today, however, Charles Webb finds himself
looking for a handout.
   ``The things he stands for and believes in are principles he
can't live by any longer,'' said Webb's ex-wife Fred, who has
accompanied him through two itinerant decades that has left the
couple virtually homeless.
   Webb, 49, says his abhorrence of material things led him to give
away two houses during the good times. He says he is nearly
destitute, living out of a van on a few thousand dollars a year.
   ``It's hard to make anybody believe the author of `The Graduate'
needs money,'' he said Wednesday.
   Webb said hard times have driven him and his 48-year-old ex-wife
out of the southern California campground where they lived for the
past decade to the Massachusetts town where Webb went to college 30
years ago.
   He came East, he said, in hopes of finding a publisher for his
latest project, a compilation of writings on prejudice.
   His plight, however, has taken him to the welfare office in
North Adams, which rejected him because he has no permanent address.
   The novelist, whose hero in ``The Graduate,'' Benjamin Braddock,
struck a chord among young readers with his post-graduate misery at
his parents' suburban home, has lived until now according to what
friends consider impossibly high and even self-destructive
standards.
   ``If he's hard up for dough, it's obviously due to ... his
inclination toward divestiture,'' said Eric Davis, who graduated
with Webb from Williams College in 1961 and teaches at the private
Commonwealth School in Boston.
   He said the couple's tendency to rid themselves of property
explains why they gave their Hollywood house to a real estate agent
in the 1960s and a home to the Massachusetts Audubon Society in
1970, when, Webb said, he felt the need for ``getting free of
things.''
   After the Webbs' marriage in 1962 in Fred's posh hometown of
Lakeville, Conn., they sold their wedding gifts at a yard sale,
many of them to the guests who had given them.
   A yearning to be free also explains their decision to divorce
eight years ago, although they had no intention of separating.
Fred, an artist whom Webb met when she was a student at Bennington
College in Vermont, said the couple felt marriage was a violation
of their constitutional right to freedom.
   Webb, the son of a well-to-do California doctor, espoused odd
views back in college, Davis said.
   ``We always used to wonder whether Chuck was putting us on,'' he
said. ``He's quite sophisticated, a very intelligent person with a
real heart, but he always said things that sounded peculiarly
simple.''
   Webb was the envy of classmates with the publication of ``The
Graduate,'' which he wrote after his own graduation in a small
apartment in Cambridge that he rented with the help of a college
creative writing grant.
   The obscure 1962 novel was catapulted to fame by the movie, and
Webb was declared a highly gifted writer with a keen ear for
dialogue. ``The Graduate'' was followed by four other novels,
including ``The Marriage of A Young Stockbroker,'' which also was
made into a movie. His last work, ``Booze,'' was published in 1978.
   Webb says he received only $20,000 for the film rights to ``The
Graduate,'' which starred Dustin Hoffman, in the days before
authors insisted on a percentage of the movie's sales. The novel,
however, is still in print and continues to earn a few thousand
dollars in royalties annually.
   But he doesn't regret the unusual life that led to his dilemma.
``It's hard to think there would be another way to do it,'' he said.

<DATELINE>MEMPHIS, Tenn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Protesters hoping to block plans for an
archaeological dig at two Indian mounds kneeled around a colorful
Indian prayer blanket and called on the Great Spirit for help.
   ``This is a spiritual issue. These grounds are sacred to Native
Americans,'' said Harry Moore, regional director of the National
Conference of Christians and Jews.
   Moore accompanied three Protestant preachers and an Indian
spiritual leader Wednesday as they joined a dozen other critics of
the proposed dig. The mounds are all that remain of an Indian
village that sat beside the Mississippi River about a thousand
years ago.
   Protests led by several American Indians who said the graves of
their ancestors would be violated stopped a dig scheduled at the
site in June by a Memphis State professor and his students.
   Now, state officials are considering a dig at the mounds, but
state archaeologist Nick Fielder said the protesters don't
understand what he's up to.
   ``Archaeologists are interested in seeing such sites preserved.
We don't have to be at odds,'' Fielder said.
   The state is trying to have the mounds registered as a national
historic site, he said, and digs will be conducted only if required
as part of that application.
   The mounds are not believed to contain graves, but if any are
found, they will be left alone, Fielder said.
   However, protesters said the site is sacred to American Indians
and should not be disturbed for any reason.
   ``Freedom of religion is as dear to these people as it is to me
as a Baptist,'' said the Rev. W.C. Holmes, pastor of Beulah Baptist
Church.
   Holmes, the other pastors and Moore joined with Rosemarie
Abeita, an Indian spiritual leader from New Mexico, in the prayer
beside the mounds. The group kneeled before an altar made of wood
carvings, eagle feathers and other religious items.
   ``Make of us one people and help us recognize our common home of
this Earth,'' said the Rev. Nancy Hastings Sehested, pastor of
Prescott Memorial Baptist Church.
   After their prayer, the demonstrators held hands in a circle,
sang ``We Shall Overcome'' and recited the Lord's Prayer.
   Ms. Abeita said the mounds already have been disturbed too much
over the years. They were used for fortifications during the Civil
War, and 27 skeletons were dug up and removed from the mounds in
the 1930s, she said.
   Fielder said the skeletons were uncovered by a work crew
building a road, not by archaeologists. Placing the mounds on the
National Register of Historic Places would prevent that sort of
thing from happening again, he said.

<HEAD>New Evidence of Recovery From Acid Rain</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Scientists who built a 1,400-square-yard roof to
shield the ground from acid rain reported today their experiment
gives new hope that lakes and streams can recover when such
pollution stops.
   Acid rain, which results from certain kinds of man-made
pollution, can harm fish, other aquatic life, vegetation, buildings
and monuments.
   For the experiment, begun in 1984 and reported in the British
journal Nature, Norwegian and Swedish researchers built the roof
over a site in southern Norway that had been exposed to acid rain.
   Precipitation that fell on the roof was filtered to remove
acid-rain components, then distributed beneath the roof by
sprinklers.
   Analysis showed the runoff beneath the roof began to recover
normal chemistry after the structure was built.
   That ``indicates that chemical changes caused by acid deposition
are largely reversible,'' the researchers wrote.
   The results agree with previous studies from Canada, the United
States and Scotland, they said.
   Further studies of soil and runoff will be needed to see if they
can completely recover from acid rain, they said.

<TEXT>
   A witch doctor using a monkey as
bait captured the companion of a notorious man-eating crocodile,
but the 200-year-old killer croc remains at large, a newspaper said
today.
   Bujang Sudin, a 16.4-foot long specimen weighing 397 pounds, was
pulled from a river Saturday and sold to a nearby crocodile farm,
the New Straits Times said.
   The newspaper said the witch doctor, Bakir Alias Yeop, lured the
crocodile with the monkey and chanted, ``Bujang Sudin come.'' It
said two other men then helped haul the crocodile from the river.
   The report quoted Abang Adris Abang Suhai, a police official in
Sarawak state, 540 miles southeast of Kuala Lumpur.
   Police said the people of Sungai Sadong village in Sarawak had
been complaining that a crocodile was troubling them and chasing
them as they walked along the river bank. They wanted it caught.
   Police said they did not know if Bujang Sudin had eaten any
humans. The crocodile's companion, however, has, and has been the
subject of massive police hunts.
   He is Bujang Senang, which means ``easy-going bachelor'' in
Malay, and he is believed to have been born about 200 years ago.
Bujang Sudin means ``bachelor Sudin''.
   In 1984, Bujang Senang became famous in Malaysia when he killed
a 51-year-old man who was in a boat near his home. On Aug. 2, 1982,
the crocodile killed an 86-year-old man.
   Police sharpshooters scoured the rivers in an effort to track
down the crocodile. Authorities called witch doctors from as far
away as Indonesia to help.
   Police have stopped looking for Bujang Senang, although there
have been occasional reports of him being sighted along various
rivers.

<HEAD>New Evidence Found for Global Fire Contributing to Extinctions

   Ancient clay deposits provide evidence that a
global fire contributed to widespread extinctions of dinosaurs and
other life forms 65 million years ago, scientists reported today.
   The hypothesis, put forth in 1985, is that the fire was ignited
by the impact of a huge meteorite.
   Some scientists say such an impact could have kicked up enough
dust to block sunlight for a long time, triggering extinctions by
lowering temperatures and killing vegetation. A worldwide fire
could have added other dangers, University of Chicago chemist
Edward Anders said Wednesday in a telephone interview.
   Apart from burning or choking in the flames, organisms could
have perished from newly formed toxic compounds, or from an
eventual warming of temperatures triggered by carbon monoxide the
fire poured into the atmosphere, he said.
   The study, by Anders and others, appears in the British journal
Nature and involved close examination of ancient clay samples from
five sites in Europe and New Zealand.
   Researchers found that carbon, thought to be from the soot,
settled on the ground at about the time as particles of iridium,
which are believed to have come from the meteorite. That suggests
the fire was ignited by the impact, rather than occurring much
later, Anders said.
   Analysis also showed uniformity in the types of carbon found at
the sites, suggesting the carbon came from a single global fire,
Anders said. Two sites show a particular type of hydrocarbon that
may have come from the burning of coniferous trees, he said.

   A study by the American Newspaper Publishers
Association shows the newsroom is the least likely place in a
newspaper's plant to find blacks and other racial minorities.
   The study, made public Wednesday, found racial minorities make
up 16 percent of the workforce of American newspapers, but only 8
percent of the news and editorial staffs.
   The ANPA survey also said that 37 percent of the papers'
employees are women. Nationally, women constitute 47 percent of the
workforce and racial minorities 21 percent.
   The ANPA said 10 percent of newsroom employees were minorities,
but one-fifth of those were clerical or administrative workers.

<HEAD>Military Families Move Inside Bases In Panama</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   More than half the U.S. military families
living in Panama have moved onto American bases over the past five
months, Defense Department officials said.
   At the same time, a growing number of servicemen going to the
troubled Central American nation are making the tour without their
families, allowing the U.S. to move more military families inside
bases.
   Maj. Kathy Wood, a Pentagon spokeswoman, said Wednesday that
1,134 military families were living off-post in Panama City as of
Aug. 1, down from 2,450 on March 1. About 12,200 American
servicemen are stationed in Panama.
   The effort to move dependents onto the bases has taken on more
momentum this summer because of what the United States has
described as a deliberate campaign of harassing Americans.
   The United States is continuing to press economic sanctions
against Panama in a bid to oust military leader Manuel A. Noriega,
who has been indicted in the United States on drug trafficking
charges.

<TEXT>
   Burma's government on Thursday freed the
country's top dissident and nine others arrested in a crackdown by
former hard-line President Sein Lwin. A day earlier, the new
president lifted martial law in the capital and called for a
referendum on multiparty democracy.
   Those released included this correspondent, who on the drive
home from Insein Jail saw for the first time in 26 years people
shouting for democracy without any official hindrance.
   People of all ages, wearing red headbands symbolizing defiance,
road in open trucks around the capital shouting, ``Give us
democracy immediately!'' Banners hung across the roads said: ``We
want democracy! We want a multiparty system!''
   On Wednesday, President Maung Maung, beseiged by mass street
protests, said the ruling party soon will hold an emergency
congress to consider popular demands for an end to authoritarian
rule.
   Maung Maung, in power for only a week, is the country's first
civilian leader since military-dominated, one-party rule was
instituted in 1962.
   This correspondent was arrested during July 29-30 raids that
also netted leading dissident Aung Gyi and others. The official
government News Agency of Burma accused them of ``attacking the
state.''
   The demonstrations that led to Sein Lwin's ouster after just 17
days in office left 112 people dead by official count and led to
martial law being imposed in Rangoon.
   A tourist said people danced in the streets of the capital on
Wednesday when Maung Maung ended martial law, ordered troops from
the city center and lifted curfews throughout the country.
   Maung Maung, Burma's first civilian leader in 26 years, called
for a popular vote on restoring multiparty democracy and said his
government would resign if the ruling party rejects his plan.
   ``General elections will be held as soon as possible'' if the
people approve a multiparty system, and no top government officials
will run, the president said.
   Maung Maung noted that Ne Win, who led the 1962 military coup
that began authoritarian one-party rule in Burma, proposed a
referendum on multiparty government when he resigned July 23 but
that members of the ruling Burma Socialist Program Party rejected
the proposal.
   The party leadership will meet again in the next month to
consider the referendum again, he said. State-run Radio Rangoon
said the party will meet Sept. 12.
   ``If the congress refuses to hold a referendum, I and ... the
Central Executive Committee will resign from the party,'' said
Maung Maung, one of 14 members of the committee.
   If the party congress approves the idea of a referendum, the
People's Assembly, or parliament, will meet the next day and
``arrangements will be made to hold a national referendum in the
quickest time possible,'' he said.
   If the people then approve a multiparty system, the Constitution
will be amended, the People's Assembly will be dissolved and
general elections will be held as soon as possible, he said.
   ``Neither I nor any personnel of the State Council, the Council
of Ministers, the Council of People's Justices, the Council of
People's Attorneys and the Council of People's Inspectors will run
in those elections,'' the president said.
   In Washington, State Department spokeswoman Phyllis Oakley said
the United States welcomes ``this movement toward democracy.''
   But a U.S. official who spoke on condition of anonymity said
protesters want a clear announcement that elections will be held
within a week or two, not a process that could take months.
   Ne Win, a former general, organized the military-dominated party
in 1962. In 1964, he outlawed all other parties and began pursuing
the rigid socialism and international isolation that turned one of
Southeast Asia's wealthiest nations into one of its poorest.
   When he resigned last month as chairman of the 1.1
million-member party, Ne Win, 77, cited his age and accepted
indirect responsibility for bloody student-led riots against his
government in March and June.
   He said then that the rioting ``showed the lack of trust and
confidence in the government'' and called for a referendum on
multiparty government.
   The rallies Wednesday, the third straight day of mass
anti-government protest, attracted ``from several hundred thousand
to up to 1 million'' people in the capital city of 3.5 million, a
Western diplomat said.
   When the radio announced martial law was lifted, ``the soldiers
started to immediately pull up the barbed wire barricades, pull
them away and retreat,'' Tom Lubin, a Chicago attorney traveling as
a tourist, said after reaching Bangkok from Rangoon.
   ``The crowd immediately began to gravitate toward Sule pagoda
and the town hall. People were dancing in the streets, shouting,
`We have won,''' said Lubin, 26. He said monks threw water on each
other in a traditional celebration.
   ``A few of the soldiers were beginning to crack smiles at the
people,'' he said. ``They seemed much more relaxed.''
   No violence was reported.
   Diplomats said the demonstrators marched along main streets in
Rangoon and dispersed after five or six hours.
   About 5,000 people sat outside the U.S. Embassy listening to
Burmese writers, lawyers, doctors and other professionals speak
over loudspeakers, a Western diplomat said. The demonstrators sent
frequent messages to the embassy asking for publicity and moral
support, he said.

<HEAD>Jerome Robbins Musical to Have A $55 Broadway Ticket Price</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL KUCHWARA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Drama Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   ``Jerome Robbins' Broadway Dances'' will have a
top ticket price of $55, the highest on Broadway, when it opens at
the Imperial Theater next year.
   The $7 million musical will feature more than a dozen dance
numbers from some of the biggest hits by the famed director and
choreographer, including ``Fiddler on the Roof,'' ``West Side
Story,'' ``The King and I'' and ``Peter Pan.''
   The current top ticket price on Broadway is $50, the going rate
for such musical hits as ``The Phantom of the Opera,'' ``Les
Miserables,'' ``Cats,'' ``Me and My Girl'' and ``Into the Woods.''
   ``The Life and Adventures of Nicholas Nickleby'' had a $100
ticket price but that was for an eight-hour extravaganza viewed in
a marathon one-day performance or over two four-hour evenings.
   ``Jerome Robbins' Broadway Dances'' will be an expensive show to
rehearse and operate, says Gerald Schoenfeld, chairman of the
Shubert Organization, which is co-producing the musical.
   The show, which begins preview performances Jan. 16 and opens
Feb. 26, has a cast of 60, Schoenfeld said, and will need to sell
out every performance for more than a year to recoup its
investment, even with a $55 top ticket price.
   ``We are limited to one source of income in the theater _ the
box office,'' Schoenfeld said Wednesday. ``It's a question of
economics.''
   Adding to the cost is the musical's 22-week rehearsal period, an
extraordinary amount of preparation. Most musicals have six weeks
of rehearsals before opening. ``Broadway Dances'' began its
rehearsals Aug. 15 at the Imperial and features a cast of
relatively unknown performers.
   Before rehearsals began, Robbins spent months interviewing many
of the original performers in his shows and, if they were
available, watching videotapes of original productions, Schoenfeld
said.
   Robbins' Broadway career began in 1944 when he did the
choreography for ``On the Town,'' the Leonard Bernstein-Betty
Comden-Adolph Green musical about three sailors on leave in wartime
New York. Among the other shows he was involved with were
``Gypsy,'' ``A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum,''
``Bell Are Ringing,'' ``High Button Shoes,'' ``Miss Liberty'' and
``Look Ma, I'm Dancin'.''
   Robbins left Broadway in 1964 after directing and choreographing
``Fiddler on the Roof.'' He concentrated on ballet, including many
works for the New York City Ballet, where he is ballet
master-in-chief with Peter Martins.

   Sen. Quentin Burdick, D-N.D., was admitted
to a hospital, according to his wife.
   The 80-year-old Burdick, a member of the Senate since 1960, was
hospitalized Wednesday at the National Naval Medical Center at
Bethesda, Md., said his wife, Jocelyn.
   Mrs. Burdick refused to say why her husband was hospitalized,
but said she talked to him Wednesday night and he was fine.
   Duty officers at the hospital declined comment late Wednesday.
   Burdick is running for re-election this year against Earl
Strinden, the longtime Republican majority leader in the state
House.
   Democratic leaders last year urged Burdick not to run for
another six-year term because of his age.
   Burdick was hospitalized four days in December for a concussion
after he slipped on some ice and struck his head.

<HEAD>Pinochet Government Lifts Emergency Measures For First Time In 15
Years</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By EDUARDO GALLARDO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The country's military leaders have
lifted all state of emergency measures for the first time since
President Augusto Pinochet seized power in 1973, a move the
opposition greeted with cautious approval.
   Wednesday's decree comes just days before the four-man ruling
junta is expected to nominate Pinochet, an army general, as sole
candidate in a presidential referendum slated for October.
   Interior Minister Sergio Fernandez, in a news conference, told
reporters the presidential decrees lifting the emergency ``will
take effect upon publication in the official bulletin,'' probably
today or Friday.
   Opposition leaders said they hoped the move would increase the
likelihood of a clean referendum. But they said it should have come
sooner and that it remained to be seen if the government would
actually allow citizens to fully exercise basic political freedoms.
   The two measures are a state of emergency and a state of
disturbance to internal peace.
   Under the state of emergency, the government is authorized to
suspend publication and broadcasts by news media and restrict
public gatherings.
   The state of disturbance measure permits Pinochet to order the
arrest and detention of opponents for up to 20 days; send into
exile citizens deemed dangerous to internal security; order
internal exile for up to three months, and restrict freedom of
information and public gatherings.
   Lawyer Gustavo Villalobos of a Roman Catholic human rights
organization told The Associated Press in a telephone interview
that the lifting of the states of emergency could allow most of
Chile's 504 political exiles to return. In London, an Amnesty
International report issued today said clandestine groups linked to
Chile's security forces have increased their attacks on government
opponents and become a major force of political repression.
   More than 100 people have been assaulted or kidnapped in the
past 18 months, while hundreds more have received death threats,
said the London-based international human rights group.
   Emergency measures have been in effect since Sept. 11, 1973,
when Pinochet led a coup that toppled the government of elected
President Salvador Allende, a Marxist. Such measures have been
lifted before but never all at once as in Wednesday's move.
   Fernandez said the government believed it could do without the
emergency powers because authorities had succeeded in establishing
order within Chile.
   A leading pro-government politician, Hermann Chadwick, said the
decision ``means that the country can rest assured that the
upcoming electoral event will be held with full democratic
guarantees.''
   In the presidential referendum, Chileans will vote ``yes'' or
``no'' on a single candidate to be picked Tuesday by Pinochet as
commander-in-chief of the army and by his counterparts in the navy,
air force and national police. Pinochet himself is considered
virtually certain of gaining the nomination.
   If voters approve the candidate, he will start an eight-year
term on March 11, 1989. If not, an open election will be held
within a year with Pinochet remaining in power until then.
   No precise date has been announced for the vote, but Pinochet
said it will be held in early October.
   The political opposition, the Catholic church, the Reagan
administration and even some government supporters had asked that
the restrictive measures be lifted before the referendum.
   ``It's better late than never,'' said Alejandro Hales, a leading
opposition activists and president of the Chilean Lawyers
Association.
   ``I now hope that the government will not resort to any legal
loopholes to prevent Chileans from exercising rights of which they
have been deprived for 15 years,'' Hales said.
   Patricio Aylwin, president of the moderate opposition Christian
Democratic Party, said, ``We now hope ... that all Chileans will be
allowed to really and effectively exercise public liberties.''
   Manuel Bustos, president of the nation's main labor federation,
said the decision ``creates better conditions for a clean
referendum.''
   Monsignor Carlos Gonzalez, president of the National Bishops
Conference, said the government's decision ``will contribute to the
peace of everyone, it gives tranquility, it gives confidence.''

   As authorities tried to shut them off
from the outside world, striking coal miners communicated through a
clandestine network of couriers and listened in the dark to radio
reports of the standoff.
   Provisions in stores in Jastrzebie, a southern mining city of
100,000, dwindled after the strikes began Aug. 16, with cheese and
fresh meat virtually disappearing from the shelves.
   But food still reached the strikers. Farmers donated food and
funds for the strikers and on Wednesday, 330 pounds of fresh pork
arrived from Solidarity supporters in Bialystok, a city 335 miles
away near the Soviet border.
   The police presence at the July Manifesto mine increased
dramatically when more than 30 police vehicles took up positions at
the main gate.
   A few hours later, 103 police vehicles, including an armored
personnel carrier, jeeps, trucks and three water cannons, rolled
through the city in the direction of another mine.
   The road leading to July Manifesto, where the leaders of the
Silesian mine strikes set up headquarters, was sealed off by an
army roadblock.
   A nightime curfew took effect Tuesday. Residents were ordered
off the street from 11 p.m. to 5 a.m. to ``preserve the peace,''
according to signs posted throughout the city.
   The miners helped organize an effective network of couriers to
relay messages among the striking mines and through a strike
information center in the city's Blessed Virgin Mary Church.
   Police detained at least two couriers and accused them of
speculating in bread and butter Wednesday. The two later were
released and immediately resumed their rounds at the mines.
   Strikers resolved to continue their occupation until they won
legalization of Solidarity and better wages.
   ``There are fewer people, but they are in an excited mood and
they will stay to the end,'' said a regional Solidarity leader who
visited several mines Wednesday.
   Not all the town's attention focused on the strike.
   Mothers in Jastrzebie were busy buying school supplies and new
clothes for children who return to school Sept. 1.
   Those items take a big bite out of the family budget. A new
school bag costs the equivalent of $4.50, or a miner's wages for a
full day.
   At the church, a group of students from universities in Warsaw
and Krakow typed newsletters and communiques. They put the latest
word on strikes around the country on a blackboard, and flags of
Poland were pinned on a map of the country to mark strike locations.
   In between radio news bulletins, students listen to the Doors
and other old rock groups.
   At least two mines, July Manifesto and 30 Years of People's
Poland, printed daily strike newsletters on the premises. On
Tuesday, 125 miners at the latter mine descended 500 yards
underground because they feared a police assault.
   On Wednesday, the miners decided to divide up shifts to have
about 40 at time underground.
   Music soothed strained nerves, and whenever possible miners
played cassettes over the loudspeakers.
   Still, according to the couriers inside the mines, radio news
was the first priority. On the hour, strikers huddled together to
listen to the latest news of the situaion of those who joined them
in their struggle.
   They tuned by turns to Polish state radio, Radio Free Europe and
the Polish-language service of the British Broadcasting Corp.

   Share prices inched up on the Tokyo Stock Exchange,
while the U.S. dollar lost ground against the Japanese yen in
trading Thursday.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues, a 130.24-point
loser Wednesday, closed at 27,870.44, up 70.77 points, or 0.25
percent.
   The market recovered in the afternoon following a 31.32-point
decline during the morning session.
   The dollar, which opened at 133.93 yen, fell to close at 133.76
yen after moving in a tight range of 133.75-134.05 yen.
   ``Investors are very cautious ahead of the scheduled West German
(central) bank's decision on its discount rate, which has been
keeping them from buying stocks,'' said an analyst at a major
securities firm.
   ``Although the recovery on Wall Street overnight led to the
Tokyo market's rebound this morning, lack of direction in the
market reversed the trend,'' he said, speaking on condition of
anonymity.
   Foreign exchange dealers said the U.S. currency fell partly
because dollar-selling intervention by U.S. and European central
banks to support the West German mark finally has become effective.
   But the dollar's sluggishness will continue until investors
determine whether the German central bank will raise its key
lending rate to support its currency, they said.

<HEAD>Ali Gets Blood-Cleansing Treatment</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HILTON HEAD ISLAND, S.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Muhammad Ali is receiving
blood-cleansing treatments by a doctor who blames the former boxing
champion's weakened condition on household pesticide poisoning and
not blows to the head.
   The 46-year-old former heavyweight champion walked into a
hospital waiting room throwing jabs in the air minutes after
undergoing an eight-hour blood treatment to relieve the slurred
speech and tremors that have plagued him in recent years.
   ``I feel like I can fight (heavyweight champ Mike) Tyson,'' Ali
said in a hoarse voice slightly above a whisper at Hilton Head
Hospital.
   Ali referred questions to his physician, Dr. Rajko Medenica, an
immunologist who specializes in cancer and blood disorders.
   Ali arrived in Hilton Head on Tuesday night to undergo
plasmapheresis, during which his plasma was removed and replaced
with an artificial product prepared by Medenica. Plasma is the
yellowish fluid in which other components of the blood circulate in
the body.
   Although Ali has been diagnosed as having parkinsonian syndrome,
possibly brought on by blows to the head during his boxing career,
Medenica disagrees.
   Calling it ``The Muhammad Ali Syndrome,'' he blamed household
pesticide poisoning, which probably affected him so severely
because of his rapid metabolism when he was in peak physical
condition.
   Ali likely will return to Hilton Head for the treatments every
three months or so, Medenica said.
   ``My goal is to remove the circulating toxins. By the end of the
year, he should be much better,'' he said.
   Although Ali had trouble speaking, he moved with ease and
appeared to be in good spirits. Moments after a brief
question-and-answer session, he playfully pulled a small red
handkerchief from his pocket and made it appear and disappear
several times.
   ``I like to show people how easily they can be deceived,'' he
said. Ali then performed other tricks, signed autographs and posed
for photographs with delighted hospital workers.
   His wife, Lonnie, said that other than the slurred speech, Ali
is doing better than many people realize. ``He feels no pain. He's
never sick. There is no hard part living with Muhammad. There is
nothing special I have to do for him, except make sure he takes his
medication.''
   Ali called Medenica the greatest doctor in the world. ``He's got
methods I've never seen before,'' he said.

<HEAD>Iowa Farmers to Begin Idaho Hay Harvest</HEAD>

   Despite a bounty of good will and aid found
here, drought-afflicted Iowa farmers are worried that the Idaho hay
they are cutting for hungry livestock back home won't be enough to
make it through winter.
   ``A lot of us guys are just plain out of hay,'' said Albia,
Iowa, dairyman Don Tibbals, one of the farmers who were to begin
cutting today. ``But when things are as bad as they are back home,
every little bit helps.''
   The 64 men, women and teen-agers who arrived late Tuesday after
a 40-hour, 1,600-mile bus trip scouted fields Wednesday where they
would begin harvesting hay near Deary, about 30 miles northeast of
Moscow.
   The farmers, from south and central Iowa, came to the Palouse
region of northern Idaho to cut hay on lands set aside for a
government erosion-control program.
   Conservation Reserve Program land is normally not farmed, but
the U.S. Department of Agriculture has released it for harvest by
drought-afflicted farmers, said Mike Tracy, spokesman for the Idaho
Farm Bureau, which is coordinating the hay project with the Iowa
Farm Bureau.
   At a dinner Wednesday night, the Iowans were assigned to fields
and machinery. Plans were to work from field to field _ like an
assembly line _ until hay is harvested from the 4,500 acres
available.
   The harvest could take 10 days, but cutting and bailing must be
finished by Aug. 31, a deadline set by the Agriculture Department.
   Depending on field conditions, the program was expected to
produce 1,500 tons to 5,000 tons of hay, which will be shipped
without charge to Iowa by the Burlington Northern Railroad.
   Sipping coffee Wednesday morning while waiting for a bus to take
them to the fields, the Iowans fretted over their ability to feed
and water their livestock through the winter.
   The Iowans said that where usually there are three to four
cuttings of hay a season, this year there was one poor harvest.
   ``A lot of farmers are feeding their winter hay now,'' said
Junior McCall of Clarinda, Iowa. ``We usually don't have to start
(feeding) hay until December,'' added Larry Keller of Nunia, Iowa.
   In addition to donations of transportation, equipment, food and
lodging, the Idaho Farm Bureau received countless offers to assist
in the harvest, Tracy said. Offers of money to help the project
poured in from around the country, he said.

<HEAD>Inmates Escape In Second Break From Same Prison in Six Weeks</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DONCASTER, England (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Eleven convicts escaped from a
low-security prison by cutting a hole in a fence while other
inmates rioted, police said today. It was the second such escape
from the prison in six weeks.
   South Yorkshire police said 10 convicts remained at large
following the break late Wednesday from Lindholme Prison in
northern England. One was captured on a farm near the prison, they
said.
   A police statement said the escapees were not considered
dangerous and were serving time for such crimes as robbery and
theft.
   Police were called to the prison after a small number of the 753
inmates started smashing windows. The violence spread, and some
inmates broke into the prison kitchen and hospital, causing minor
damage, police said.
   Meanwhile, the 11 cut a hole in a wire mesh fence surrounding
the compound and fled.
   Prison guards managed to restore order after about two hours
while 100 policemen, aided by dogs, ringed the prison to prevent
further escapes while the fence was repaired.
   Officers set up roadblocks and began searching the surrounding
countryside for the escapees. No injuries were reported in the
disturbance.
   On July 16, six inmates escaped from the prison by cutting a
hole in the fence while other prisoners went on a four-hour
rampage, smashing buildings and setting them on fire. Four of those
escapees were captured.
   Britain's overcrowded and often antiquated prison system has
been plagued in recent years by riots and demonstrations. Prisoners
have complained about overcrowding, poor living conditions,
brutality by guards and petty restrictions.
   Authorities admit living conditions are bad in some prisons and
say the government is trying to solve the problem by building new
prisons.

   Stock prices plunged today and
businessmen expressed fears for government stability after
Ferdinand Marcos requested permission for the first time to return
home and confront an accuser.
   The 70-year-old ex-president, living in exile in Hawaii, filed a
petition Wednesday with the anti-corruption court demanding the
right to defend himself when a former Cabinet minister testifies
agaist him in November.
   Last week, the court ruled that Marcos had the right to
cross-examine former Public Works Minister Baltazar Aquino when he
gives evidence in a deposition hearing Nov. 7.
   It was the first time Marcos formally sought permission from any
Philippine institution to return to the land he fled after the
February 1986 uprising that toppled his administration and
propelled Corazon Aquino to the presidency.
   Mrs. Aquino said today that she would stand by a commitment to
abide by whatever decision the court renders in the case.
   ``At the same time, I'm also committed to work for the national
interest,'' she said without elaboration in a statement read by
spokesman Teodoro Benigno. Mrs. Aquino had previously refused to
allow Marcos to return.
   Marcos asked the Department of Foreign Affairs to issue him a
passport within three days and to request the U.S. government to
lift restrictions that bar him from leaving Hawaii.
   U.S. officials have said they will not allow Marcos to leave
without Mrs. Aquino's consent.
   In the petition, Marcos said the court had no choice but to
grant his request or order the Philippine government to halt a
preliminary investigation that authorities say will lead to the
filing of formal criminal charges against Marcos.
   Solicitor-General Francisco Chavez said Baltazar Aquino _ who is
not related to the president _ will testify about alleged bribes
paid by Japanese firms during the Marcos administration.
   Marcos said that as a lawyer, he demanded the right to represent
himself.
   ``The only possible way of lawfully preventing the undersigned
from personally appearing and defending himself in all such cases
is for the ... incumbent government to dismiss (any charges) with
prejudice,'' Marcos said, meaning no charges would ever be filed.
   Defense Secretary Fidel Ramos told reporters Wednesday that the
military was drawing up security plans in the event Marcos comes
home.
   Today, share prices on the Manila Stock Exchange fell 20 points,
and brokers said the drop reflected concern over a possible Marcos
return.
   Stock prices began falling Monday as rumors spread the former
president would come back soon, and one dealer predicted a 30
percent decline unless Mrs. Aquino takes an unequivocal stand
against Marcos returning.
   Luisabel Cortez, clerk of the anti-corruption court, told The
Associated Press the three justices were studying the Marcos
petition but had not decided whether to call a hearing.
   The Aquino government has been under pressure from Swiss
authorities to file formal charges against Marcos before they will
provide information about secret bank accounts Marcos allegedly
maintains in Switzerland.
   Government officials claim Marcos embezzled up to $10 billion
during his administration and stashed millions in Swiss bank
accounts.
   Philippine law bans trials in absentia, and officials have
delayed filing criminal charges for fear Marcos would insist on
returning.
   Last Saturday, military Chief of Staff Gen. Renato de Villa said
the armed forces command would not try to block Marcos' return but
noted that the former president's presence would cause ``security
risks.''
   Marcos still enjoys support among conservatives in both the
general population and the ranks of the armed forces.
   His supporters have been agitating for Mrs. Aquino to let Marcos
come home for the funeral of his mother, Josefa Edralin-Marcos, who
died May 4. Family members and Marcos supporters say no date for
the burial will be set until the ousted president is allowed to
come home.

<HEAD>Study: No Increased Death Rate Among Grieving Parents</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A study published today casts doubt on the widely
held belief that the grief of losing a loved one can shorten the
lives of surviving relatives.
   The research, conducted in Israel, found that parents who lose a
son to war or accidential death go on to lead full lifespans
despite their grief.
   ``These findings raise questions about the effect of grief as a
death-provoking factor,'' wrote Dr. Itzhak Levav and colleagues
from Hadassah Medical Organization and Hebrew University in
Jerusalem.
   An editorial published with the study in the New England Journal
of Medicine concluded that the stress of grief is unlikely to cause
illness in most people.
   ``The physician owes it to the patient to point out the
strengths of the human response rather than the susceptibilities
that are often belabored in the media,'' wrote Drs. Malcolm P.
Rogers and Peter Reich of Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston.
   ``Rather than emphasize the disruptive power of stress,'' they
concluded, ``the physician may do better to emphasize human
resilience and the power of life.''
   Some studies have found that when a spouse dies, the surviving
husband or wife is also at risk of an untimely death. However, this
could result from a lifetime of sharing the same hazards, such as
smoking or poor diet, rather than grief.
   In the latest study, the researchers reviewed the lifespans of
two groups of bereaved Israeli parents: those of all 2,518 soldiers
killed during the Yom Kippur War in 1973 and those of 1,128 young
men who died in accidents between 1971 and 1975.
   Overall, mortality among these parents was the same as for the
general population of Jewish Israelis. However, there was one
exception. They found that the death rate was significantly
elevated among widowed mothers who lost a son.

<HEAD>Study Confirms Hazard of Low Lead Exposure to Children</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Exposure to low levels of lead early in life is
linked with subtle impairment of mental development in 4-year-old
children, according to a study published today.
   The study increases the growing body of research suggesting that
small amounts of lead can hinder the growth of babies' brains.
   Last year, a Boston study found slow mental growth among
2-year-olds who had been exposed to low levels of lead before
birth, although these children were not considered retarded. The
latest research, conducted in Australia, provides similar findings
for older children.
   The researchers wrote that their findings suggest ``that any
adverse effect of lead is cumulative and may result in long-term
impairment in development rather than a delay in development.''
   The study, published in the New England Journal of Medicine, was
conducted by Dr. Anthony J. McMichael and colleagues at the
University of Adelaide.
   The doctors studied 537 children who lived in Port Pirie, a town
in south Australia near a large lead smelting plant.
   At age 2, their average blood level of lead was 21 micrograms
for each deciliter of blood. A microgram is one-millionth of a
gram; a deciliter is a tenth of a liter, which equals 2.1 pints.
   Large amounts of lead have clearly been linked with brain damage
and death. But the potential ill effects of low levels is still
controversial.
   No one knows precisely how much, if any, lead in the blood can
be considered safe. Until recently, U.S. scientists considered
levels above 25 micrograms unacceptable. But the Boston study,
conducted at Children's Hospital, found that development is slowed
if fetuses are exposed to levels above 10 micrograms before birth.
   The Australian researchers determined the youngsters' average
blood lead concentrations during their first four years of life and
gave them tests to assess their mental development. They found that
those with lead levels of 32 micrograms of lead scored 7 percent
lower than those with levels of 11 micrograms.
   However, those with higher lead exposure were not retarded. Even
though they did worse than those with low lead exposure, their
scores were slightly above average.
   The findings could not be explained by other possible influences
upon mental development, such as the mothers' intelligence or their
home environment.
   The researchers said that their work, along with the Boston
study, ``indicate that there may be no clear threshold below which
an adverse effect on mental development does not occur.''
   In the United States, the level of lead in the air has fallen
substantially in recent years because most cars now use unleaded
gasoline. However, flaking layers of old lead paint may still be a
hazard, as well as water tainted by lead pipes.

   Amnesty International today said evidence
indicates Chile's security forces are linked to clandestine groups
that have carried out more than 100 assaults or kidnappings in the
past 18 months.
   Hundreds of government opponents have received death threats as
the clandestine groups have become a major force of political
repression, the London-based international human rights group.
   Amnesty said Chile's military government blames the attacks and
threats on ordinary criminals or independent extremist groups. But
it said there is ``convincing evidence'' they are in fact carried
out by groups linked to the security forces.
   ``Evidence which has emerged through the courts, the groups'
methods of operation, the impunity with which they operate and the
vast resources available to them all clearly point to an
association with the security forces and official condonement,''
said the report.
   In addition, it said, in rare instances, members of units have
been photographed or otherwise identified as belonging to the
military or police.
   ``Anyone perceived as critical of government practices risks
harassment and thousands live with the uncertainty of possible
abuse,'' the report said. ``Intimidation by clandestine groups is
now one of the most common methods of political persecution in
Chile.''
   The report said intimidation by such groups began to spread in
1983 following an increase in opposition demands for a return to
democracy.
   The attacks have increased in the buildup to an October
presidential referendum, it said. The military junta will choose a
single candidate for president, and voters will approve or reject
that choice.
   Victims of harassment or abuse have included political and trade
union officials, human rights workers, community leaders in poor
neighborhoods, bishops, lawyers, court officials, journalists and
political activists, Amnesty said.
   The report cites 128 cases of intimidation, including that of
Oscar Eloy Gomez, regional president of the Chilean Teachers'
Association in the northern town of Arica and leader of a local
campaign for a no vote in the referendum.
   In April, he was forced into a vehicle by unidentified men who
later fired shots at his feet, kicked and beat him and told him he
would get more of the same if he continued his activities.
   Other victims have been given electric shocks, burned with hot
metal or acid, or had marks cut into their flesh, Amnesty said.
   As well, hundreds of death threats have been sent, some with
drawings of coffins and skulls or accompanied by dead animals, it
said.
   Sergio del Solar, president of the Quilpue Humans Rights
Commission, said he found a dead cat outside his home, its throat
slit.
   ``It was terrible,'' he was quoted as saying. ``All I could
think of was to hide it so that my family wouldn't suffer.''
   The report said that secret groups reportedly were behind the
1987 disappearance of five political activists, the 1986 murder of
four opposition politicians and three other deaths in 1985.
   Amnesty said that although the government has said these
incidents will be investigated, ``not one of the hundreds of cases
brought to the attention of the courts resulted in any of the
perpetrators being brought to justice.''
   President Augusto Pinochet has ruled Chile since Sept. 11, 1973,
when he led a military coup that toppled the government of elected
President Salvador Allende, a Marxist.

   A crude bomb was placed in the luggage of a Soviet
woman flying from the Ukrainian capital Kiev to the Volga River
city of Kuybyshev, but it failed to explode, the official Tass news
agency said.
   Tass said in a dispatch Wednesday that police suspect the
woman's husband, a former army colonel, of making the bomb and
planting it.
   ``The device had a tremendous explosive potential. Experts are
trying to find out why it did not work,'' the agency said.
   It said the woman, who was not identified, found the device in a
suitcase as she unpacked her bags at the home of a relative she was
visiting. She was traveling with her 15-year-old daughter.
   The woman called police when she found the device, which
contained parts of an ordinary alarm clock, and experts were called
to dismantle it, Tass said.
   The bomb was set to explode 35 minutes into the 870-mile flight,
it said.
   ``Police who conducted an investigation in Kiev found in the
house and garage belonging to the woman passenger's family the
things similar to those of which the explosive device was made,''
Tass said.
   ``It was found out as well that her husband disappeared after
learning about the safe landing of the plane in Kuybyshev,'' the
article said.
   The woman's husband, a former colonel in the Red Army, was
working as an engineer at a Kiev plant.
   Tass did not say when the flight occurred or what kind of
explosives were used.

   Showers and thunderstorms doused sections of Arizona and
dampened much of New England today after pounding rain triggered
dozens of car crashes and lightning knocked out power to 82,000
customers in Southern California.
   ``You couldn't see your hand in front of your face,'' Officer
Ron Kauffman of the California Highway Patrol said of Wednesday's
cloudburst.
   Along a 4-mile stretch of Interstate 15, the rain helped cause
16 crashes involving 27 vehicles, injuring 15, officials said.
   Those accidents included one involving a mortuary van that
overturned, spilling two bodies onto the highway, said patrol
Officer Mark Mezzano. Motorists put the bodies back in the van.
   The downpour soaked a Los Angeles apartment building, forcing 75
residents into a shelter. An activist led 30 homeless people camped
out in a park to the Los Angeles County Building for shelter.
   Lightning cut power to 82,000 homes and businesses in Southern
California, including 70,000 in Los Angeles suburbs and 4,000 in
the city, utility officials said.
   Showers and thunderstorms that produced heavy rain in parts of
Arizona Wednesday night continued today. At the Grand Canyon, 2
inches of rain had fallen by Wednesday afternoon.
   Showers were widespread from northern New England to the
southern New England coast. Showers and a few thunderstorms
lingered over sections of Florida and the northeast Gulf Coast.
   Today's forecast called for scattered showers from the Great
Lakes to New England, with showers most numerous in Upper Michigan
and northern New England; widely scattered showers and
thunderstorms from southern Texas to the Gulf Coast and northern
Florida; and showers and thunderstorms from Arizona to southern
Utah.
   High temperatures were predicted in the 80s or 90s across much
of the nation, the 60s in Maine and upper Michigan, the 70s from
North Dakota to the lower Great Lakes, upper Ohio Valley, and
southern New England and along the Pacific Coast; and between 100
and 105 in the desert Southwest, the central valleys of California
and parts of the southern Plains.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 a.m. EDT ranged from 45
degrees at Lake Yellowstone, Wyo., to 93 degrees at Chandler and
Phoenix, Ariz.

<HEAD>Police Chief Resigns As Commissioner Blasts Supervision During
Riot</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The police chief in charge of hundreds of
officers at a demonstration that turned into a riot resigned as the
police commissioner released a scathing report blaming the violence
on poor supervision.
   The report on Aug. 6's confrontation at Tompkins Square Park
criticized Deputy Chief Thomas Darcy, 56, for a series of mistakes,
beginning with his leaving the scene for about 90 minutes at a
crucial time to use the bathroom.
   ``It was clear from the review that some police officers engaged
in the excessive use of force against private citizens by striking
demonstrators with nightsticks and kicking other apparently
defenseless people,'' said Commissioner Benjamin Ward.
   Darcy, a 31-year veteran who was the designated commander of the
hundreds of officers deployed at the Lower East Side park, offered
his resignation shortly before Ward released the report Wednesday.
   The two other supervisory officers at the confrontation, Deputy
Inspector Joseph Wodarski and Capt. Gerald McNamara, also were
disciplined. Departmental charges also were brought against two
other officers, and more were expected, Ward said.
   The demonstration against enforcement of a 1 a.m. curfew that
has since been suspended ended with injuries to more than 50
people, including passers-by.
   More than 100 charges of police brutality were filed.
   A police review board, U.S. Attorney Rudolph Giuliani and
District Attorney Robert Morgenthau are conducting separate
investigations into the complaints.
   ``The control of the situation was lost during the first
confrontation between police and demonstrators and never
sufficiently regained,'' wrote Chief of Department Robert J.
Johnston in the report.
   A key mistake, according to Ward, was McNamara's decision at the
beginning of the demonstration to transmit an emergency signal that
mobilized 300 officers from all over the city without making any
provisions for adequate supervision.
   Other major errors included use of a low-flying helicopter with
a search light, whose hovering presence acted as a magnet and drew
people to the confrontation, and the premature decision to send
police on horses into the crowd.
   Wodarski was reassigned from his prestigious post as commanding
officer of the Midtown South Precinct to a command in Queens, but
he did not lose his rank. Ward said McNamara will be temporarily
removed from his job commanding the a precinct for six to seven
months of retraining.
   Darcy will receive a $55,000 annual pension.
   The police review board has identified several officers involved
in the melee, relying in part on videotapes taken by neighborhood
residents, and recommended charges against two.
   The commissioner noted that 17,000 of the department's 26,000
officers had been hired since 1980, and they, as well as their
superiors, had no experience with riots.
   However, he said, ``The New York City Police Department is
better than the events in Tompkins Square Park would have you
think.''
   Among the report's recommendations was a major training program
in crowd control and policing of street disorders.

<HEAD>Judge Rejects PTL Reorganization Plan</HEAD>

   PTL's bankruptcy trustee says he'll
shorten the time the ministry has to sell its assets when he
submits a revised reorganization plan to a bankruptcy judge who
rejected his first proposal.
   In rejecting the reorganization plan Wednesday, U.S. Bankruptcy
Judge Rufus Reynolds said it failed to take into account the
ministry's poor financial health.
   ``This plan does not work,'' Reynolds said. ``It does not
reflect the situation.''
   He gave PTL bankruptcy trustee M.C. ``Red'' Benton until Oct. 1
to prepare a new plan, and until Sept. 10 to return with
information on potential buyers of the ministry's assets.
   Benton said PTL's secured creditors rejected the plan because it
allowed five years for the sale of the assets. PTL's major
contributors, called lifetime partners, also rejected the plan, he
said.
   Reynolds could have approved the plan despite the negative votes
from creditors, but decided against it.
   Proceeds from the sale of assets would repay PTL's debts, which
could top $130 million.
   Reynolds rejected the idea of closing down operations, saying
that would kill PTL's revenue sources, which include donations from
viewers of the televised ministry and proceeds from the Heritage
USA Christian retreat near Fort Mill.
   The ministry, which entered bankruptcy proceedings in June 1987
after the resignation of founder Jim Bakker in a sex-and-money
scandal, has been divided into the newly named Heritage Ministries
and a corporation holding PTL's assets.
   Benton said after the hearing that he would propose speeding up
the time required for the sale of assets to six to seven months.
   Benton did not address the effect of the reorganization plan's
rejection on potential buyers of the assets. But he said setting a
sale within seven months would let creditors know how much they
would be receiving much quicker than the five years allowed in the
original plan.
   Benton told the court the debtor corporation has been losing
$400,000 a month, and needed $885,000 from the sale of other assets
to survive 30 more days. Reynolds approved that request.
   Benton said he expected to have by a Sept. 1 a firm offer from
Canadian Peter Thomas of the Samoth Capital Corp. to buy the
Heritage USA theme park, satellite television network and other
property. The company has offered $113 million for the network,
park and 1,700 acres of undeveloped property.
   He said there also may be offers from Bakker, Charlotte, N.C.,
businessman George Shinn and an Oklahoma group he declined to
identify.

<TEXT>
   Formal campaigning began today for next month's
general elections, but the contest has been overshadowed by a
public exchange between the only leader Singapore has known and his
designated successor.
   The tension began in a three-hour speech Aug. 14, when Prime
Minister Lee Kuan Yew cited the shortcomings of Deputy Prime
Minister Goh Chok Tong. On Monday, he suggested Goh see a
psychiatrist.
   Goh said that Lee really meant a psychologist, and added that he
planned to nudge the prime minister out of office, probably within
two years.
   Lee said Monday that his deputy could not communicate as well on
television and at mass meetings as he could in small groups. ``I
don't know why. I have suggested to him perhaps a bit of
psychological adjustment, maybe a psychiatrist, something holds him
back.''
   Goh told reporters Tuesday that Lee suggested he consult a
psychologist, ``not a psychiatrist, who is for mentally distressed
people.
   ``I do not believe that a psychologist could help me. A speech
therapist and trainer will, and I have been seeing my speech
trainer for over a year,'' said Goh, who sometimes appears stiff
and uneasy during televised speeches.
   ``I am not President Reagan. I am not good at one-liners.
Neither am I Prime Minister Lee. I am not good at making three-hour
speeches.''
   Goh quoted Lee as saying the prime minister ``is only waiting to
be nudged out by a firm elbow. When the time comes, probably inside
two years, I will gently nudge him out.''
   Goh was picked as the next leader by Cabinet members in 1984,
but Lee will remain in power following the Sept. 3 elections and
there are no formal plans to end his rule.
   The dispute and the eventual shift in power has overshadowed the
election in the rich island nation, a former British colony that
separated from Malaysia in 1965. Lee has been its only prime
minister and the People's Action Party its only governing party.
   The Business Times said in an editorial today that ``the 1988
election is really about the handing over of the baton from Lee
Kuan Yew to Goh Chok Tong, the final passing of power ...''
   The governing party captured unopposed 11 of the 81 seats in
Parliament when nominations closed Wednesday. Formal campaigning
started today.
   The party is favored in most of the contested districts against
137 candidates from seven opposition parties and four independent
candidates. Only 51 opposition candidates ran in the last election
in 1984.
   All but three seats in Parliament, which was dissolved last
week, were held by the governing party, which needs at least 41 to
form a new government and run the country for the eighth
consecutive term.
   Opposition leaders have denounced changes in the constitution as
attempts to strengthen governing party rule.
   One proposed constitutional amendment is to change the now
ceremonial presidency into an elected office with enhanced powers.
   It is widely assumed that if the 46-year-old Goh takes power,
Lee, who will be 65 on Sept. 16, will become the first elected
president.
   In that role, he would have veto power over the nation's
spending and nominations of Supreme Court judges, the attorney
general and other senior posts.
   The new president would lack full executive power, but would be
able to make speeches in Parliament and have access to all
government departments.

<HEAD>AIDS-Afflicted, Retarded Girl to Stay Home for Present</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A mentally retarded 6-year-old girl afflicted
with AIDS may stay in a home instruction program while an appeals
court decides whether she must be enclosed in a glass booth if she
attends school, a federal judge ruled.
   Eliana Martinez earlier won the right to attend school with
other retarded children when the fall term begins Monday in
Hillsborough County. But she would be isolated in a special
6-by-8-foot booth until she is potty trained and stops sucking her
thumb.
   The child's adoptive mother, Rose Martinez, fought in court for
two years to get her daughter in the class but balked at the glass
cage required by District Judge Elizabeth Kovachevich.
   Ms. Martinez' attorney, Steve Hanlon, appealed to the 11th U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta. He also filed a motion for a
local stay, asking that Eliana be allowed to attend classes with no
restrictions or be kept in the county's homebound school program
until the Atlanta court rules.
   Chief Judge William Terrell Hodges ruled on that motion
Wednesday, allowing the girl to continue her instruction at home
until the appeal is heard.
   Hanlon said he asked the appeals court for ``expeditious
consideration'' that, if granted, could mean a ruling in late
September or October.
   The school board Tuesday displayed the glass booth, equipped
with a desk, toilet and sound system, to about 150 parents of other
children who will attend the Manhattan Exceptional Center this
fall. Only 11 of the school's 189 students would be in Eliana's
classroom.
   Several parents expressed concern over having their children in
school with the AIDS-afflicted girl. One parent, Rob Preston, said
his child would not go to school if Eliana shows up.

   Swedish authorities kept three East
bloc immigrants under surveillance for several years before
detaining them this week on suspicion of spying, authorities were
quoted as saying today.
   The suspects _ a married couple and a man _ faced arraignment
today on charges of illegal intelligence activity, the Aftonbladet
daily said. Swedish radio, however, said the woman was released
after questioning and was no longer suspected of criminal activity.
   The New York Times reported that the three were among eight
people involved in a spy ring that stole defense plans for Western
Europe and gave them to the Soviet Union.
   The ring was based in West Germany, while couriers who aided it
were based in Sweden, the Times reported.
   The identities of the suspects were kept secret. Under Swedish
regulations, their names may not be published even after they are
charged in court.
   Aftonbladet said all three were in their 40s and that one was a
physician. They were detained Tuesday morning in the southwestern
port city of Goteborg, it said. The couple has lived in Sweden at
least 10 years, and the man came to Sweden in 1958, the newspaper
said.
   The Goteborgs Posten quoted Torsten Bjorkhede, the Goteborg head
of the security police, as saying the case was handled in
cooperation with other intelligence agencies, which he refused to
name.
   ``In any case, it's a question of activity which went on
continuously for a long time. It is not a matter of a single
incident,'' he said.
   The surveillance had gone on for ``years,'' he said.
   Authorities refused to elaborate on the affair. ``This is such a
special crime that we cannot say much now at the beginning of the
investigation,'' Chief Prosecutor Sven-Olof Hakansson was quoted as
saying in the Svenska Dagbladet newspaper.
   Hakansson was quoted as saying the suspects could not be
arraigned on spying charges since their actions were not directed
against Sweden. ``Illegal intelligence activity'' is a lesser
charge.

<HEAD>Suspected Collaborator Hacked To Death; Fifth Arab Dies In Jail</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAN IZENBERG</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   About 30 masked men hacked to death a West Bank
Palestinian accused of collaborating with Israeli agents, Arab
residents and Israel radio said today.
   The army said he died in a clan dispute, but the village's
Israeli-appointed mayor, when asked who was responsible, told The
Associated Press: ``The whole village.''
   Palestinians meanwhile shuttered stores and stayed home from
their jobs today in the second day of a general strike called in
honor of four Arabs who have died in Israeli jails.
   A fifth Palestinian died Wednesday in a Gaza Strip jail, and the
army said it was investigating the circumstances. It acknowledged
force was used against him as he was being detained.
   The army imposed a curfew on Nablus, the West Bank's largest
city, and surrounding refugee camps after 14 Palestinians were shot
and wounded Wednesday in clashes with troops.
   Another were four were wounded Wednesday in the Gaza Strip
refugee camp of Shati.
   The strike was widely observed in the occupied territories.
Streets were deserted in Gaza City, and columns of black smoke from
burning tires were visible.
   On the Jerusalem-Bethlehem highway, assailants stoned several
Arab cars to enforce the strike, injuring four Palestinians. They
threw a firebomb at an Israeli passenger bus northeast of
Jerusalem, slightly injuring two Israelis, Israel radio said.
   In the West Bank village of Yatta near Hebron, the masked men
broke into the home of Saadi Hazaza late Wednesday, dragged him
outside and hacked him to death with axes, Arab witnesses and
Israel radio reported.
   The army said Hazaza apparently was killed in a clan dispute,
but villagers said he was targeted because he collaborated with the
Israeli authorities. Mayor Ismail Abu Hamid said the whole village
was responsible for his death.
   Hazaza carried a gun, a privilege only granted to West Bank
Arabs who cooperate with Israelis. He was stabbed in Hebron a month
ago and was released from a hospital three days before his death,
Israel radio said.
   Hazaza was the third suspected collaborator to be killed since
the Dec. 8 start of the uprising against Israel's 21-year rule in
the West Bank and Gaza.
   His death brought the Palestinian death toll to 253. Four
Israelis also have died.
   The army said it was investigating the death of 42-year-old Hani
Shami, who died Wednesday in army custody. Shami, a resident of the
Jabaliya refugee camp, was arrested Monday night when he tried to
stop soldiers from detaining his son, the army said.
   ``Some force was used against'' Shami as he was being detained,
an army spokeswoman said. She said he was examined twice by doctors
while in custody and found to be in good condition. On Wednesday,
he was discovered unconscious and later pronounced dead.
   Following U.S. criticism of Israel's deportation of Palesinians
suspected of subversion, Foreign Minister Shimon Peres said today
that authorities only deported Palestinians as a measure of last
resort.
   ``There is no policy of deportations. There are individual
decisions on deportations,'' he told Israel radio.
   Israel has expelled 33 Arabs since the beginning of the
Palestinian uprising and has issued deportation orders against 25
more.
   Israel television reported military courts will begin hearing
the appeals of the 25 next Sunday. If the judges turn them down,
they may turn to the Supreme Court.
   In Washington, State Department spokeswoman Phyllis Oakley said
the United States was ``shocked by ... Israel's decision to expel
an additional 25 Palestinians.''
   In a first such warning to the Jewish state, U.S. officials said
relations could suffer if the deportations continued.

   A 12-year-old boy fascinated by pigeons was
chasing them in an empty parking garage when he tripped into an
empty elevator shaft and plummeted 12 stories to his death, police
said.
   Keith Shipley apparently went with several friends to the top
floor of the garage Wednesday to catch pigeons, said Baltimore
police Sgt. Timothy Keel. He was stretching to reach one of the
birds and fell when he caught his leg on a short chain-link fence
surrounding the shaft, Keel said.
   The boy loved pigeons and kept a cage on the roof of his home,
his mother, Catherine O'Dell, said.
   ``I never gave him permission to do that, but he did it
anyway,'' Mrs. O'Dell said. ``He even hid a couple in his room,
that's how much he loved them.''
   When the garage was first built, cars were taken to the top
floors via a large elevator, authorities said. Because the top
floor was no longer used, the elevator had been removed.

<HEAD>Coast Guard Says Barge Has Stopped Leaking Fuel</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A petroleum barge that sprang a leak
after possibly being damaged in a storm has stopped spewing fuel,
and an 18-square-mile slick won't do serious environmental damage
to the Chesapeake Bay, the Coast Guard says.
   ``While she's been aground, she's lost effectively all of her
cargo from two tanks,'' said Cmdr. George Naccara, executive
officer of the Coast Guard's Marine Safety office in Hampton Roads.
   The vessel, which leaked about 4,000 barrels, or 168,000
gallons, of light fuel, remained in containment booms set up
Wednesday afternoon, Naccara said late Wednesday.
   The 240-foot barge ran aground Wednesday morning in about 12
feet of water in Indian Creek on the Chesapeake's western shore.
The Coast Guard diverted the barge into the creek in an attempt to
get it to a pier where it could unload the fuel.
   The barge held 19,500 barrels of diesel fuel and gasoline,
Naccara said.
   ``We had a three-mile-by-six-mile sheen,'' said Coast Guard Lt.
Rod Walker. ``It will disperse over time.''
   Mike LaCivida, a spokesman for the Virginia Department of
Emergency Services, said some of the fuel washed ashore. The Coast
Guard said it expected minimal to moderate environmental damage.
   ``It's such a light oil that dissipates and evaporates
rapidly,'' said Naccara, adding that no migratory birds are in the
area this time of year.
   Naccara said the barge's owner, Eastern Carriers Inc. of
Hockessin, Del., accepted responsibilty for the accident and sent a
second barge to help offload the fuel from the damaged barge.
   The 37-year-old barge, en route from Baltimore to Richmond, was
being towed by a tug when it reported a leak, Naccara said. The
tug's crew said the barge might have been damaged in a storm about
two hours earlier, he said.
   ``Winds picked up to 25 knots and the operator of the tug
reported waves of about five feet,'' Naccara said.

<TEXT>
   Anti-government demonstrators
controlled this southernmost Burma town today, and student leaders
claimed similar takeovers were occurring throughout the country.
   This correspondent, traveling by motor launch from the Thai
mainland, found no Burmese immigration officials at their posts and
was told all army and police units had withdrawn Wednesday to an
area about one mile from this prosperous market town.
   The pullout, student leaders said, came after President Maung
Maung announced that the ruling Burma Socialist Program Party would
next month hold an emergency congress to consider popular demands
for a return to democracy.
   About 300 workers, merchants and students today marched through
Victoria Point, known as Kawthaung in Burmese, asking others to
join them in further demonstrations in coming days. Two jeeps were
packed with students.
   ``We'll continue to demonstrate. We want elections as soon as
possible,'' said student leader Nyi Htwe, calling Maung Maung's
promises of democracy ``a political trick.''
   He said there was support among demonstrators for Aung Gyi, a
leading dissident released today from nearly a month's
imprisonment. But the 21-year-old Rangoon University senior
admitted uncertainty over Burma's future.
   ``Only Lord Buddha can know what will happen in the future,'' he
said, speaking at the student headquarters set up in the town's
high school.
   Nyi Htwe claimed the intelligence network set up by student
organizations in Rangoon was reporting that authorities in other
Burmese cities similarly had surrendered control and in some areas
were cooperating with anti-government forces.
   He said a volunteer defense group was being organized among the
town's 80,000 residents to help maintain law and order.
   Students said that they carried no weapons and there had been no
bloodshed as demonstrators confronted troops in the town last week.
   They described some soldiers applauding as protesters gathered
outside a military compound pleading with them to refrain from
using force. They said about 70 soldiers from the Mergui-based
101st Division had been stationed in the town, armed with automatic
weapons and U.S.-made M-79 grenade launchers.
   In earlier demonstrations in Rangoon and other areas, troops
opened fire on crowds of protesters and hundreds of casualties were
reported.
   Nyi Htwe said he and about 100 other students from Rangoon had
arrived at Victoria Point in July to begin directing
anti-government agitation. He said most of the students were former
residents of the town, located on an island off the southern tip of
Burma, about 490 miles southeast of Rangoon.
   University and high school students have spearheaded the
uprisings against 26 years of authoritarian rule, but Buddhist
monks, laborers, professionals and even government civil servants
swelled their ranks as the protests intensified.
   The town appeared calm despite the ongoing demonstrations.
   The central market was open and passers-by looked at posters
affixed to walls of low-slung houses.
   One poster showed ousted President Sein Lwin, widely held
responsible for ordering troops to fire on protesters, with an M-16
rifle and a bandoleer stuffed with bullets slung around his neck.
It read: ``Sein Lwin is Rambo.''
   Another depicted Ne Win, who resigned as Burma's leader last
month, as a dog perched on a chair with Maung Maung sitting under
him and Sein Lwin off to one side and labeled ``running dog.''
   Maung Maung, although a civilian, has been closely associated
with Ne Win and the authoritarian system for decades and is
considered unacceptable by many anti-government protesters.
   Victoria Point is one of the few points along the Thai-Burmese
border where Thai nationals are officially allowed access. Most of
the border is controlled by ethnic minority rebels fighting the
Rangoon government.
   The town has prospered and its population has mushroomed because
of trade with Thailand and two-way smuggling. As tension mounted in
recent weeks, Burmese authorities closed the entry point
intermittently.
   But after a 20-minute boat ride from the Thai town of Ranong
today, no officials were at dockside to inspect border passes.

   The international office of the
Solidarity free trade union movement today appealed for funds for
strikers, their families and ``victims of repression'' in Poland.
   ``The needs are great,'' Jerzy Milewski, head of the
Brussels-based international office of Solidarity, said in a
statement. ``If the authorities adopt the worst possible tactics,
thousands of strikers are threatened with dismissal from work and
extreme poverty.''
   On Aug. 16, strikes began in the coal mines of southern Poland.
Since them more than 20 enterprises joined in, including shipyards,
transport companies and steel mills.
   Strikers demand higher pay, better working conditions and the
legalization of the Solidarity trade union movement, which was
outlawed in 1982.
   In a separate statement, the European Trade Union Confederation
called on the 12 European Economic Community nations to urge the
Polish authorities to stop using violence to end the strikes.
   The European union federation said it ``fully supports the
aspirations and demands of Polish workers and Solidarity.
   ``The strikes now under way in Poland show clearly the absence
of trade union liberties.''
   The federation said five East European nations _ the Soviet
Union, Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, East Germany and Hungary _ have
asked for formal diplomatic relations with the EEC and that a
Polish request was expected soon.
   As part of its improving relations with Eastern Europe, the EEC
must raise the issue of respect for trade union rights, the
federation said.

<HEAD>Miners Return to Work After Strike</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   More than 300 employees of a coal mine
in southern Hungary returned to work today after a 20-hour strike
that posed the first worker challenge to the strict economic
policies of premier Karoly Grosz.
   In negotiations with senior government officials, the strikers
won a promise the government would try to iron out a quirk in a new
income tax law that allows workers on sick leave to earn more than
those working regularly.
   The strikers at the Komlo mine 100 miles south of Budapest
threatened to halt work again if parliament does not remove this
quirk.
   In addition, the government instructed companies to pay bonuses
to miners who complained they had lost 30 percent to 50 percent of
their bonuses under the new tax laws.
   The daily Magyar Nemzet published the text of a letter sent by
the strikers to Grosz, who in May became Communist party leader,
urging him to settle ``the oft-repeated problems'' of miners at
Komlo, 100 miles south of Budapest.
   The letter attacked the personal income tax introduced Jan. 1 as
part of Grosz's attempts to stimulate the stagnating economy. It
said the tax ``does not stimulate increased production or the
undertaking of extra shifts.''
   ``We all realize the present position and the problems both in
the national economy and in our own company, but we are faced with
a situation in which our own living conditions have become worse,
our real income having been reduced as a result of the inflationary
impact,'' the letter added.
   Inflation has reached 18 percent this year. The income tax has
reduced the net income of many workers by introducing taxes on
bonuses and earnings from second and third jobs.
   Grosz' government is trying to stimulate the economy to curb a
foreign debt of $18 billion.
   The letter justified the strikers' demands for changes in the
tax system by noting government and party leaders have said for
years that ``they consider the demands of workers legitimate and
will see that these are met.''
   ``We miners have always honestly done our duty toward the
dictates of the national economy, and feel it is the ethical duty
of the government to meet our requests now,'' the letter said.
   Reports of strikes in communist Hungary are extremely rare, and
the relatively swift media coverage of the stoppage at the Komlo
mine appeared to reflect the greater openness of the state-run
media since Grosz became party leader.

<HEAD>Jackson Ends Three-Day Fast Protesting California Grapes</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   With the symbolic passing of a small cross made
of grape vines, the Rev. Jesse Jackson ended a three-day fast and
vowed to wage a continuing boycott against California table grapes.
   Jackson, who received the cross from Cesar Chavez as the
president of the United Farm Workers Union ended a 36-day
water-only fast, ended his fast Wednesday and passed the cross to
the Rev. Joseph Lowery, president of the Southern Christian
Leadership Conference.
   Lowery, of Atlanta, said he will fast until Saturday, when he
will hand the cross to actors Martin Sheen and Robert Blake, who
will fast.
   ``I have fasted with Cesar Chavez,'' Jackson said. ``I have
shared the pain. I want to be a better person. I want to be an even
more committed person to the workers and the abandoned families who
harvest the food we eat.''
   Wednesday's ceremony occurred outside a Jewel Co. food store,
but Jackson and other demonstrators stressed they were not calling
for a boycott of the supermarket chain _ only a boycott of the
grapes, which the UFW maintains are treated with pesticides
dangerous to farm workers.
   The union contends pesticides contribute to cancer, miscarriages
and birth defects among those who pick grapes.
   California table grape growers acknowledge that four pesticides
are used, but say the same chemicals are sprayed on other
vegetables and fruits and pose no health risk.
   A spokesman for California table grape growers said Chavez is
targeting the industry because the union does not have any
contracts with growers.
   ``That's the bottom line,'' spokesman Adam Ortega said from Los
Angeles. ``They're accusing stores of selling poisoned grapes.
That's not true. They're scare tactics.''

   Emma M. Melville, the nation's first civilian
to witness an atomic test, has died in a Baltimore hospital. She
was 87.
   In 1953, Civil Defense officials selected the 51-year-old
homemaker and grandmother to witness an atomic bomb test in the
Nevada desert.
   Mrs. Melville's trip was featured on Edward R. Murrow's ``See It
Now'' television news magazine. The national program broadcast a
special CBS report titled, ``Mrs. Melville's Atomic Bomb.''
   Of the experience she said, ``Movies and other pictures ...
aren't enough. ... It's something a person cannot realize or
imagine without first-hand experience. It was beautiful, too, if so
dreadful a thing can be linked with beauty.''
   Mrs. Melville, who died Tuesday, is survived by a son and two
daughters.

<TEXT>
   A couple trying to raise $15,000 to
start a new life in California placed a newspaper ad asking for a
dime from each resident of San Francisco but won't get far on the
$2.50 raised so far.
   The ad in last week's issue of the weekly San Francisco Bay
Guardian cost $23, said Ed Hatley, who had hoped San Francisco's
680,000 residents would bankroll the move from northwest Arkansas.
   ``A dime from everyone in San Francisco will help us move to
California,'' Hatley and his wife, Bonnie Mae, wrote in the
advertisement.
   They've received about two dozen responses. Most included an
encouraging word or two: ``Come on out to this great state. Hope to
see you soon,'' was one offering. All included a dime, nothing more
than that. As of Wednesday night, eight days after the ad appeared,
Hatley had collected about $2.50, he said.
   ``We were just interested in moving out to California,'' he said
by telephone from Bentonville, population 9,000. The Hatleys have
no children and have lived in Bentonville for nine years. He does
theater, movie and video production work and says there's not much
work for him in northwest Arkansas.
   Hatley had hoped he could find work in San Francisco.
   Hatley, 35, who came here from Florida, said he didn't have
another plan in the works to get money for the trip.
   ``I really like northwest Arkansas a lot,'' he said. ``If the
money did happen, though, we'd make the move. It's simply that the
American dream is to have work you can enjoy.''

   A young couple who offered to sell their
third child _ a 2-day-old girl _ said they didn't want to put up
with another diaper change, a Maryland state trooper said at their
preliminary hearing.
   Gino Gargone, 24, and his wife, Doris, 22, were ordered
Wednesday to stand trial on charges of trying to sell the infant
for $30,000 to the trooper, who posed as a divorcee desperate for a
child, a prosecutor said.
   Mrs. Gargone was held in lieu of $100,000 bail and her husband
was being held on $500,000 bail, according to Bucks County
Assistant District Attorney Dale A. Reichley.
   District Justice Catherine Stump Wednesday ordered the Gargones
to face formal arraignment Oct. 7 on charges of dealing in infant
children and conspiracy. If convicted, they could be sentenced to
15 years in prison and fined a total of $50,000, according to
District Attorney Alan Rubenstein.
   A third suspect, Steven Schwartz, 40, a Baltimore auto body shop
worker who acted as a go-between, is still at large, Reichley said.
The case started when the Maryland State Police responded to an
advertisement in the Jewish Times of Baltimore offering a child for
sale; the number given was the body shop where Schwartz worked.
   The Gargones were arrested July 16 after they turned their
daughter over to Maryland State Trooper Angelique Rutledge at a
motel in the Philadelphia suburb of Quakertown.
   Rutledge said Gargone told her in a telephone conversation that
his wife already had two boys, ages 1 and 2, and they wanted the
third baby placed in a good home.
   ``He told me about the family history ... that his wife was
pregnant two times in the last two years,'' Ms. Rutledge said. ``He
said he didn't want to put up with another diaper change.''
   Mrs. Gargone, who sat quietly next to her husband during the
hearing, lowered her head and cried when she saw photographs of her
husband allegedly handing over their infant.
   The baby girl was turned over to the Bucks County Children and
Youth Services Agency, which placed her in foster care. The
Gargones' two boys are being cared for by their maternal
grandmother.

<NOTE>Eds: New throughout with Dukakis speech.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By JOHN KING</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CLEVELAND (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Michael Dukakis today accused the Reagan
administration of ``criminal'' dealings with Panama's Gen. Manuel
Antonio Noriega and demanded that the president and Vice President
George Bush explain why the United States has ``been in bed with
General Noreiga.''
   The Democratic presidential nominee, in a sharply worded attack
on the Reagan-Bush anti-drug effort, said the administration's
indifference to the war on drugs threatened the nation's children,
families, schools, streets and economy.
   ``The most serious threat to our national security in this
hemisphere is the avalanche of drugs that is pouring into this
country and poisoning our kids,' Dukakis said in a speech at the
Cuyahoga County Courthouse.
   ``And it is the drug traffickers and those who cover for them
who are the enemies of everything we stand for in the world today.''
   ``How can we ask our kids to say no to drugs here at home when
we have an administration that's been in bed with General
Noriega?'' Dukakis asked.
   He chided President Reagan for refusing to seek the help of
Latin and Central American leaders to curb drug trafficking and
said if elected he would use more foreign aid to assist those
countries in eradicating drug crops and protecting public officials
whose lives are endangered by drug cartels.
   ``Today, after seven years of tough talk, the American people
want some answers,'' Dukakis said.
   He then recited a litany of administration and Bush policies he
said were misguided, saying the ``Star Wars'' space defense program
is an unnecessary and costly idea taking vital resources away from
anti-drug efforts.
   Dukakis frequently criticizes Reagan and Bush for dealing with
Noriega, the Panamanian strongman who is under U.S. indictment on
drug charges. But today was the first time he called the
administration's conduct criminal.
   ``For years, while General Noreiga of Panama was actively
involved in the drug business, we were actively in business with
General Noreiga,'' Dukakis said. ``That, my friends, is criminal.''
   On Wednesday, Dukakis questioned Bush's promise to create 30
million new jobs and his credentials to manage the nation's economy.
   ``The next president of the United States must be an economic
leader, not a cheerleader,'' Dukakis said in speeches in Washington
and Grand Rapids, Mich.
   ``He must do more than talk about jobs, he must be a president
who knows how to build a strong economy and has done it,'' the
Massachusetts governor said. ``A president who knows how to create
and save jobs and has done it. A president who has the strength and
the vision and the values to build a strong and vibrant future for
America.''
   The Democratic presidential nominee traveled to the Midwest on
Wednesday after visiting the nation's capital to accept the
endorsement of the AFL-CIO.
   He attended a briefing at a high-tech center at a university in
Grand Rapids in predominantly Republican west Michigan and then
delivered essentially the same speech he gave to the AFL-CIO
delegates.
   But he did add a fresh attack on Bush, whose promise to create
30 million new jobs if elected president has been questioned by the
GOP presidential nominee's own advisers.
   ``This election isn't about whether Mr. Bush's own economists
believe his speeches,'' Dukakis said. ``It's about making every
American a full shareholder in the American dream. It's about
creating jobs with a future, jobs you can count on, jobs you can
raise a family on.''
   Dukakis conceded that more Americans are working today than at
any time in history but said most people who have been forced to
change jobs during the Reagan administration have had to accept
lower-paying jobs. He also said that in real terms, average family
income has not risen in 20 years, despite a substantial increase in
the number of dual-income households.
   ``That's the price our workers and their families are paying for
voodoo economics,'' Dukakis said. ``And that's why we're going to
have a Democratic president and vice president in 1989.''
   Dukakis told the Grand Rapids crowd that he had a ``sad
announcement'' _ that Bush has refused to appear at a debate
scheduled for Sept. 14 at the Naval Academy in Annapolis, Md.,
where Dukakis has suggested the topics be foreign policy and
national security.
   ``The vice president said he's not ready yet,'' Dukakis said.
``After seven and a half years....'' The crowd laughed and
applauded as Dukakis' voice trailed off.

   Iran-Contra defendant Oliver L. North,
heckled and picketed during a fund-raising speech, called 1988 a
critical election year for ``the fate of freedom,'' as a dozen
demonstrators were arrested outside.
   Supporters paid up to $500 for the banquet inside the Waukesha
Exposition Center Wednesday night, while pro- and anti-North
demonstrators gathered outside. In the auditorium, North's audience
cheered security guards when two women were escorted to an exit
after interrupting his speech.
   ``The Vietnam veterans are outside protesting,'' one of the
women shouted.
   ``That little disruption was a remarkable testament to the
Constitution of the United States,'' North said, contrasting
American freedom of speech with censorship in the Soviet Union.
   Demonstrators, estimated from 125 to 200, gathered outside the
hall before North arrived. Authorities said there was shoving and
that some objects were thrown.
   Twelve were taken into custody, Deputy Sheriff Terry Martorano
said. The Waukesha County sheriff's office said 11 were eventually
booked on disorderly conduct charges.
   Two also were charged with resisting arrest and one for
possession of a controlled substance, Martorano said. Most posted
bond within a few hours and could receive court dates within two
weeks.
   North, a former Marine lieutenant colonel, was a national
security aide to President Reagan when accused of a role in the
Iran-Contra affair. His appearance was part of a fund-raising swing
shared with Stephen B. King, a candidate for the Republican
nomination for the U.S. Senate.
   ``The fate of freedom could well be determined by the 1988
elections,'' said North, who was promised $25,000 for his legal
defense fund. ``The leadership of the modern-day Democratic Party
is not willing to pay the price for freedom.''

<HEAD>Striking Municipal Workers Stage Protest March In Soweto</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SOWETO, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   About 3,000 striking municipal
workers confronted security forces at City Hall today after one of
the largest protest marches in a black township in recent years.
   Leaders of the march unsuccessfully demanded a meeting with
Soweto's black mayor and white town clerk, and police ordered the
strikers to disperse. The strikers then marched back to a church
three miles away where the march began.
   Many of the strikers have been fired in the past two weeks.
   Trucks loaded with black soldiers followed the procession, and
army riflemen were deployed atop the city council chambers. A
police helicopter buzzed low over some of the workers as they began
the return march, and police fired some tear gas.
   As they approached City Hall, marchers chanted slogans in
support of the outlawed African National Congress guerrilla
movement and unfurled banners denouncing the local government.
   Protest marches are illegal in South Africa unless the
government gives advance authorization.
   The strike, which has disrupted trash collection and other
services in the township of 2.5 million people, began in late June
when Soweto officials said they could not raise pay until a
widespread rent boycott ended. The strike was suspended briefly,
then resumed July 19.
   Soweto, near Johannesburg, is one of dozens of black townships
nationwide affected by a rent boycott that has cost local
administrators more than $220 million in unpaid rent. The boycott
started in a group of townships south of Johannesburg in September
1985 and spread to Soweto in June 1986.
   The boycott was launched to press a variety of political
demands, including lifting the national state of emergency,
withdrawing security forces from black townships and releasing
political prisoners.
   Authorities have tried several tactics, including evictions, in
an attempt to break the boycott. The latest strategy is to sell at
auction the homes of boycott participants.
   Many blacks have low regard for their local officials, who are
widely viewed in the townships as collaborating with the
white-dominated central government.
   By law and custom, apartheid establishes a racially segregated
society in which the 26 million blacks have no vote in national
affairs. The 5 million whites control the economy and maintain
separate districts, schools and health services.

<HEAD>New Study: Most Homeless People Are Just Poor _ Not Mentally Ill</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARK PERKISS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A new study says most homeless people are not
mentally ill or alcoholic, but are simply poor and in need of help.
   ``For the general public, the stereotype of mental illness is
there, but more and more researchers are finding that's not the
situation,'' said Michael Sosin, a professor at the University of
Chicago's School of Social Service Administration.
   Sosin and two associates conducted the two-year study, which was
released Wednesday. In 1986, the researchers interviewed 535
homeless people in Chicago's soup kitchens, shelters and other
places where free meals are served.
   Only about 20 percent of those who were or had been homeless had
spent time in a hospital for treatment of mental illness, Sosin
said.
   Advocates for the homeless agreed with the study's findings.
   ``The indigent are not mentally ill or alcoholic. There are
families, single women with children, abused women and runaway
youth who have been threatened or abused,'' said Ronald Vander
Kooi, a specialist in housing and homelessness for the Salvation
Army in Chicago.
   ``The only common denominator they have is being without
shelter,'' he said.
   ``These findings mirror the new face of homelessness in every
region of the country,'' said Robert Hayes, founder of the
Coalition for the Homeless, an advocacy group in New York City.
``Homeless people are not sick _ they need help finding jobs and
affordable housing.''
   Sosin said stringent welfare requirements that make it difficult
for the poor to receive public aid contribute to homelessness. He
said that while it may appear the economy is improving, ``for the
people at the bottom it isn't getting better.''
   ``We were surprised that many of the homeless had at one time
held working-class jobs,'' he said. ``Most .. are without shelter
for the first time and have been on the streets for about six
months. They're not long-timers.''

<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sen. Paul Simon met today with
South African Foreign Minister Pik Botha, and the two men said they
aired their differences over apartheid without yelling at each
other.
   ``You name the controversial agenda ... we talked about it,''
said Simon, D-Ill., who favors U.S. economic sanctions against
South Africa. ``We had a good, frank discussion.''
   Simon, who unsuccesfully campaigned for the Democratic
nomination for the presidency this year, is on a five-day,
fact-finding tour of South Africa.
   Simon is chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Subcommittee
on African Affairs and will play a major role in deliberations on
pending legislation to intensify U.S. sanctions against South
Africa.
   Limited sanctions have been in effect since 1986.
   ``We never yelled at each other,'' Botha said after the meeting
in a Johannesburg suburb. ``The senator has put all the difficult
questions. But he has given me the opportunity to put my side.
That's all I can ask.''
   Botha and other South African leaders say they are pursuing
gradual race reforms at their own pace and will not be pressured by
sanctions. They also say black South Africans stand to suffer the
most from any economic hardships caused by sanctions or foreign
disinvestment.
   By law and custom, apartheid establishes a racially segregated
society in which the 26 million blacks have no vote in national
affairs. The 5 million whites control the economy and maintain
separate districts, schools and health services.
   Simon predicted Wednesday that Congress would intensify
sanctions against South Africa unless the government agreed to a
timetable for dismantling apartheid.
   ``(Simon) came here determined to find justification for
sanctions,'' The Citizen, a pro-government daily, said in an
editorial today.
   ``But then Americans do tend to have a simplistic _ should we
say a Simple Simon _ approach to other countries, and South Africa
is probably the worst example of this American madness to recreate
countries in their own image,'' the newspaper said.
   Simon visited several black townships and met with black leaders
such as Anglican Archbishop Desmond Tutu.
   The senator's request to meet with imprisoned African National
Congress leader Nelson Mandela was rejected by the government.
   The 70-year-old Mandela, South Africa's best known black leader,
is in Cape Town's Tygerberg Hospital being treated for tuberculosis.

<HEAD>Steelers Founder Dies at 87</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: UPDATES throughout with new background. A version also moved
on the sports wire.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Art Rooney Sr., who bought the Pittsburgh
Steelers in 1932 for $2,500 in racetrack winnings and turned the
team into a National Football League powerhouse in the 1970s, died
today. He was 87.
   ``At 7:45 a.m. this morning the Chief ... passed away in his
sleep with his family at his bedside,'' said Dr. Theodore Gelet,
Rooney's personal physician.
   Rooney had been in a coma since Monday. He was admitted to Mercy
Hospital with a stroke Aug. 17 after becoming dizzy at the team's
offices at Three Rivers Stadium.
   Rooney's Steelers struggled for 40 years until the 1970s, when
coach Chuck Noll and quarterback Terry Bradshaw led the team to
dominance in the NFL, becoming the only club to win four Super Bowl
games.
   Rooney's reputation for honesty, sincerity and benevolence won
him thousands of friends and once prompted Supreme Court Justice
Byron White, known as ``Whizzer'' during his Steeler playing days
in the 1930s, to say:
   ``There is no man in the world I respect more than Art Rooney.''
   Yet ``The Chief,'' as he was known, was a shrewd entrepreneur
and race-track operator who earned millions before turning over his
sports empire to his five sons in the late 1960s.
   Despite his wealth, Rooney never left the decaying neighborhood
on Pittsburgh's North Side where he grew up. His daily rituals _
Mass at a neighborhood church, five-minute walk to the stadium,
cigars and chats with reporters _ rarely changed.
   ``I'm a Pittsburgh guy,'' Rooney would say.
   Born Jan. 26, 1901, in Coultersville, Pa., Rooney was one of
eight children of a saloon keeper who moved his family to
Pittsburgh in 1903. As a youngster, he played where Three Rivers
Stadium now stands.
   Though his Steelers brought him the most fame, Rooney's first
love was horse racing. His racing holdings once included Yonkers
Raceway in New York, a dog track in Florida, the William Penn
Racing Association at Liberty Bell near Philadelphia and the Green
Mountain Race Track in Vermont.
   He even blamed his love of racing for the Steelers' early
football failures: ``I didn't give it the time. I was always going
to the race track.'' It wasn't until after 1969, a 1-13 season,
that the Steelers' luck changed. Rooney's son Dan, the team's young
president, hired away Baltimore Colts' assistant coach Chuck Noll
to lead the club. Then, in the first round of the college draft,
the Steelers took a promising defensive lineman named Joe Greene.
   The Steelers' first-round pick in 1970 was a brash quarterback
named Terry Bradshaw, who threw just six touchdown passes and 24
interceptions that season.
   ``When I was getting a lot of heat early on, he was the one who
told me, `You're going to be great. Don't worry about what those
guys are saying,'' Bradshaw said of Rooney.
   ``There was no other owner like him,'' Bradshaw said. ``He was
an original. He was a Northern Dancer, a Joe Namath _ one of a
kind.''
   The team went on to win Super Bowls in 1974, 1975, 1978 and 1979
and were hailed as ``The Team of the Decade.''
   Rooney, one of Pittsburgh's finest athletes, played football
against Jim Thorpe, baseball against Negro League greats Satchel
Page and Josh Gibson and was a superior boxer asked to represent
the United States in the 1920 Olympics.
   He is survived by his sons: Dan, the Steelers' president; Art
Jr., a vice president and former scouting director; and Pat, Tim
and John, who are involved in various family-related businesses.
   Funeral services will be held Saturday morning in Pittsburgh.

   General Motors Corp. has begun recalling more
than 600,000 1983 Oldsmobiles and Buicks for repair of the
vehicles' emissions control systems, the Environmental Protection
Agency said today.
   A defective thermal vacuum switch causes the cars to exceed
federal standards on emission of gasoline vapors and carbon
monoxide, the EPA said.
   Repair of the component will take about 20 minutes, the EPA said.
   The agency said 613,582 vehicles are involved in the recall.
They are the 1983 Oldsmobile Cutlass Supreme, Cutlass Cruiser,
Delta 88, Ninety-Eight, Toronado and Custom Cruiser, and the 1983
Buick Le Sabre, Estate Wagon, Electra and Riviera.
   The models all have 5-liter engines.

   Democratic presidential candidate Michael
Dukakis complained today about recent accusations by Republicans
against him and his wife, saying the charges are becoming a
distraction to the campaign.
   Speaking at a roundtable discussion with local reporters,
Dukakis said he and his wife, Kitty, are having to ``deny
nonexistent facts.''
   ``I think there's a pattern here,'' he said, raising his hand
above his head. ``I hope to keep a high place.''
   On Wednesday, the Democrat's campaign issued a statement saying
that a suggestion by Idaho Republican Sen. Steve Symms that Mrs.
Dukakis had burned an American flag is ``totally false and beneath
contempt.''
   Symms' comment was the third time in a few days that prominent
Republicans have aired allegations that the Democrats have rebutted
swiftly.
   The allegations come at a time when Republicans are struggling
to shift the campaign focus away from GOP vice presidential nominee
Dan Quayle and questions about his Vietnam-era service in the
National Guard.
   In an interview Tuesday with a radio station in Blackfoot,
Idaho, Symms raised the allegation that Mrs. Dukakis burned the
flag during an anti-war demonstration in the 1960s.
   ``As I've been told, I haven't seen this, but I heard that there
are pictures around that will surface before the elections are over
of Mrs. Dukakis burning the American flag while she was an anti-war
demonstrator during the '60s,'' Symms said.
   But Paul Costello, an aide to Mrs. Dukakis, issued a denial
Wednesday that read:
   ``Senator Symms' statement about Mrs. Dukakis is totally false
and beneath contempt. Mrs. Dukakis believes that the American flag
is a symbol of our nation's commitment to freedom and she respects
everything for which it stands.''
   The suggestion that Mrs. Dukakis had burned a flag was
``absolutely false,'' Costello said, adding that while she opposed
the Vietnam War, she could not recall ever participating in
anti-war protests.
   Dukakis aides twice called back to heap abuse on Symms.
   ``I guess the Republicans are doing the limbo to see how low
they can go,'' Costello said.
   Dukakis aide Mark Gearan added, ``Senator Symms should be
especially careful with rumors.''
   The other incidents:
   _On Sunday, in an appearance on ABC's ``This Week with David
Brinkley,'' New Hampshire Gov. John Sununu referred to a ``report I
saw in the press'' that allegedly said Democratic vice presidential
candidate Lloyd Bentsen had run ``to get his son'' admitted to a
special slot in a National Guard unit.
   Bentsen's son denied the allegation and said he enlisted in the
Texas National Guard in 1968 after personally contacting the
commander of the unit he wanted to join. ``He was wrong,
absolutely, categorically wrong,'' Lloyd M. Bentsen III said of
Sununu's comment.
   _On Monday, New York Rep. Gerald Solomon, the senior Republican
on the Veterans Affairs Committee, called reporters to talk about
Dukakis' draft deferments. ``I just want to point out that Dukakis
received his first of three educational deferments eight months
before the Korean War ended,'' Solomon said in Chicago. ``My point
is not to point fingers at Dukakis, because what he did was legal.
But he avoided combat by using his education deferments. There's
nothing wrong with what he did because it was allowed.''
   Dukakis swiftly denied any suggestion that he had used college
deferments to avoid combat in the Korean War, saying, ``I served my
country proudly.''
   Dukakis attended Swarthmore College from 1951-1955, requesting
and receiving draft deferments in 1952, 1953 and 1954. He said he
went to his draft board with several weeks of school left and asked
to be drafted immediately. He spent slightly less than two years in
the Army, including 16 months as part of a United Nations
contingent assigned to the demilitarized zone in Korea after the
fighting ended.

   A fire today destroyed much of Lisbon's
historic shopping district, killed one person and injured 29 before
firemen brought it under control 10 hours after it began in a 19th
century department store.
   Maj. Anibal Matos Silveira, the official coordinating more than
800 firemen at the scene, told reporters that the Chiado shopping
district would ``continue to smolder'' for another day.
   President Mario Soares, who toured the 10-square-block area four
hours after the fire broke out in the Armazens do Grandela
department store on the Rua do Carmo pedestrian mall, said one man
was killed.
   Spokeswoman Ersilia Soares at San Jose Hospital said 29 people
were being treated for burns and smoke inhalation, and six were in
serious condition.
   The Portuguese news agency LUSA said the fire was Lisbon's worst
disaster since a fire and earthquake destroyed much of the city in
1755.
   LUSA earlier quoted fire officials as saying they didn't have
enough water to fight the blaze. Firemen with sooty faces
complained that pressure was too low to get the water to the upper
stories where the flames leapt from one building to another.
   Silveira said the shells of the burned-out, five- and six-story
buildings on Rua do Carmo, Rua Garrett, Rua Nova do Almada and Rua
Sacramento may collapse.
   The fire also destroyed Grandes Armazens do Chiado, Lisbon's
other department store, and numerous speciality shops that had been
a fixture of Lisbon's commercial life for the past 150 years.
   The fire reportedly began around 5 a.m.
   Officials said they did not know what caused it, but Lisbon
residents were awakened by explosions of bottled gas in the stores.
   Officials at the scene said hundreds of people were left
homeless by the fire and ``at least 2,000'' were out of jobs. No
exact figures were available.
   The Grandela and Chiado department stores were among the oldest
in Western Europe with wooden floors and stairways and
old-fashioned booths for cashiers. They had no sprinkler systems.
   The Chiado district is next to Lisbon's central Rossio Square 10
blocks in from the Tagus River estuary. It forms a part of the city
rebuilt by the Marques de Pombal after the 1755 disaster.
   Soares, viewing the flames pouring from buildings on the rua do
Carmo from the platform of the 19th century Santa Justa elevator
built by Gustave Eiffel, said the fire was a ``catastrophe.''
   Prime Minister Anibal Cavaco Silva, an economist, told reporters
at the scene the city faced an ``enormous task of reconstruction.''
   ``We are indebted to the firemen, and now we have to get down to
work to rebuild this area,'' Cavaco said.
   Regular Lisbon firemen were joined by volunteer companies from
surrounding areas. Radio stations called on firemen on their annual
August holidays to return immediately to Lisbon.
   Virgilo Madeira, a 67-year-old florist, looked out on Rua
Garrett as flames swept up the street toward his tiny Pequeno
Jardim flower shop.
   ``In all the 50 years I've been here, I've never seen such a
thing,'' he said. ``But I'm not leaving. I have nowhere to go.''
   Police ordered residents of the area to evacuate their homes as
firemen dragged orange hoses up old wooden staircases and onto the
red tile roofs.
   Old women in black huddled in doorways holding dogs and cats in
their arms, and men in suits and ties slipped down the wet, cobbled
streets carrying parakeets in cages.

   Soldiers in Burundi shot to death
hundreds of Hutu tribesmen and dropped firebombs on villages after
Hutus burned and hacked hundreds of rival tribesmen to death,
refugees say.
   The Hutu refugees are pouring into Rwanda from neighboring
Burundi, where ethnic warfare with the rival Tutsi tribe has killed
at least 5,000 people and sent more than 40,000 fleeing for their
lives across the border.
   Nearly two weeks after the flare-up in a centuries-old tribal
feud between the majority Hutu and dominant Tutsi, refugees from
Burundi are arriving at the rate of 2,000 a day into Rwanda,
Africa's most densely populated country.
   ``We're trying to help them, but they are overwhelming us,''
Fredric Karangwa, governor of this province, said Wednesday.
   The influx of refugees, all Hutu, began Aug. 15. The refugees
say that a day earlier, Hutus turned on Tutsi tribesmen in two
northern communes, hacking hundreds to death with machetes and
burning others in huts.
   None of the refugees admitted involvement in the slaughter, and
it was not known what prompted the massacre.
   Refugees said the Tutsi-dominated army, sent north as
peacemakers, turned into executioners when they arrived and found
the carnage against their brethren.
   ``The soldiers were rounding up Hutus and shooting them,''
refugees said. ``They are collecting them into groups, taking them
inside houses, closing the doors and windows and then shooting.''
   The Burundi government denied the allegations and blamed the
bloodshed on exiled Hutus who infiltrated the tiny central African
nation. But many of the refugees in Rwanda have knife slashes,
bullet or shrapnel wounds and burns.
   The refugees, most of them peasant farmers, said government
helicopters dropped firebombs on fleeing villagers.
   The short, stocky Hutu account for 84 percent of Burundi's 5
million people, but the tall, lanky Tutsi _ about 15 percent of the
population _ control the military and the government.
   About 8,000 people were crammed into three camps in this section
of southern Rwanda. Most were camped on hills overlooking a
marshland and the Akanyaru River, the route to safety for fleeing
Burundians.
   In a local clinic, a doctor and several nurses said they treated
dozens of bayonet and bullet wounds.
   In one crowded waiting room, Reverin Ndururutse, 32, held his
5-year-old nephew, Immaculata. The boy's right side was peppered
with shrapnel. A bandage covered a finger on his right hand, where
the tip had been torn away by a bullet.
   Ndururutse said his nephew and his own 3-year-old son were the
only survivors of a family of 15 herded into a house by soldiers
who opened fire.
   The adults threw themselves on top of the two children,
Ndururutse said.
   Thousands of Burundians have used dugout canoes to cross the
slow-moving Akanyaru River. They hid in papyrus reeds near the
river until dusk and then crossed during the night.
   Beyond the marshes on the Burundi side, Rwandan officials say,
the Burundi military has closed the border and set up machine-gun
posts to stop the exodus.
   The site of most of the killing is in Burundi's remote north
around the farming communes of Ntega and Marangara. The army has
sealed off the areas.
   But the refugees keep coming and the influx has put a strain on
Rwanda, which already is hard pressed to deal with its own
population of 6.1 million.
   Rwanda has appealed for international aid. A team from the U.N.
High Commissioner for Refugees, which said 41,000 refugees had
arrived by Wednesday, is assessing the needs.
   Rwanda and Burundi, former Belgian colonies, each are about the
size of Maryland.
   The current bloodletting was the first reported ethnic violence
since Maj. Pierre Buyoya seized power in Burundi in a bloodless
coup Sept. 3, 1987 while former President Jean-Baptiste Bagaza was
out of the country.
   After an abortive 1972 coup attempt by Hutus, Tutsis massacred
100,000 Hutus, including most of the tribe's intelligentsia, human
rights groups said.

<HEAD>Former Texas Governor Dies</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Former Texas Gov. Price Daniel, who once
said he would rather hold that job than the presidency, died in
this southeast Texas town early today. He was 77.
   The former governor and U.S. senator died at about 1 a.m., said
George Christian, a former press secretary to Daniel.
   Daniel apparently suffered a massive stroke at his ranch and was
taken to Yettie Kersting Hospital at Liberty, Christian said. He
was dead upon arrival, a spokeswoman said.
   Daniel was brought in at 1:10 a.m. and had no vital signs,
hospital spokewoman Margie Hagan said. Paramedics were unable to
determine the cause of death immediately.
   Daniel served three two-year terms as governor from 1957-63 but
lost an unprecedented bid for a fourth term in a Democratic primary
race won by John Connally.
   ``The death of Price Daniel is a loss to the people of America.
He never, never overlooked the problems with which the people were
concerned. We're going to miss people of his caliber,'' said former
Gov. Preston Smith. ``I've lost one of my best friends.''
   Smith appointed Daniel to the Texas Supreme Court in January
1971. Daniel retired from the court eight years later.
   Daniel started his public career as a member of the state House
of Representatives in 1939, became speaker in 1943 and later waived
his legislative exemption and enlisted in the Army as a private. He
left the service in 1946 with the rank of captain.

   Republican presidential nominee George Bush says
Democrat Michael Dukakis was ``looking for a reason'' to veto a
bill permitting classroom recitations of the Pledge of Allegiance.
   Pushing what chief of staff Craig Fuller called ``a winning
issue for us,'' Bush jumped on Dukakis on Wednesday for vetoing a
1977 Massachusetts bill that would have required teachers to lead
children in saying the pledge.
   ``I would have signed that bill,'' the vice president, with
President Reagan on the stage, told some 3,000 Republicans packed
into a Los Angeles hotel rally replete with celebrities and red,
white and blue balloons.
   The attorney general of Massachusetts jumped to the defense of
Dukakis today, telling a television interviewer that the bill
Dukakis vetoed would have imposed criminal penalties on teachers
who declined to lead their classes in the pledge, even if they did
so because of their religious convictions.
   Attorney General James Shannon, a Dukakis supporter, also said
on ABC's ``Good Morning America'' that in the last decade, the
state's governors have obeyed all 25 advisory opinions the
Massachusetts Supreme Court has issued on pending legislation.
   ``He did what he should have done under our system,'' Shannon
said. ``We have a constitutional system and he took an oath to
uphold the Constitution.''
   Bush and Reagan, rarely seen together, did a political tap-dance
on the Massachusetts Democratic governor who is trying to recapture
the White House after nearly eight years of Republican rule.
   Bush flew to his adopted home state of Texas afterward, and the
vice president planned campaign appearances in San Antonio,
Longview and Dallas over the next three days.
   Bush had Republican National Convention delegates in New Orleans
join him in reciting the Pledge of Allegiance as he concluded his
nomination acceptance speech a week ago.
   Vice presidential aides at the time would not say why Bush had
ended his speech in this unusual fashion, although media consultant
Roger Ailes barked to a reporter, ``That's the way he lives.''
   Now the Bush campaign leadership thinks it has found an issue
for the vice president to seize upon. In fact, Bush concluded a
campaign rally Monday in Spokane, Wash., with the Pledge of
Allegiance.
   Dukakis told reporters Tuesday he says the Pledge of Allegiance
himself and would urge children to do so, but said the question
before him was whether a governor or any other chief executive
could sign into law a bill they knew to be constitutionally
defective because of previous court rulings.
   ``If the vice president is saying he'd sign an unconstitutional
bill, then in my judgment, he's not fit to hold the office,''
Dukakis said Tuesday.
   Striking back, Bush said he would sign such a bill and let the
Supreme Court wrestle with the constitutional question.
   Bush said that Gov. Jim Thompson, R-Ill., had faced a similar
piece of legislation, and had signed it.
   ``Let's face it, my opponent was looking for a reason not to
sign that bill,'' he said. ``I would have to look for a reason to
sign that legislation.''
   Bush said it was ``hard for me to imagine'' that the framers of
the Constitution would have considered it a violation of anyone's
constitutional rights to be present for a recitation of the Pledge
of Allegiance.
   ``I just don't believe that was their concept when they wrote
the Constitution for our great country,'' he said.
   The sponsors of the Reagan-Bush show had lined up an all-star
cast of celebrities to serve as warm-ups, including comedian Bob
Hope, actress Cheryl Ladd, actor Charlton Heston and singers
Tiffany and Pat Boone.
   Reagan addressed directly for the first time a question that has
hovered about Bush ever since he made his presidential ambitions
known _ his reputation for having failed to make his presence known
as vice president.
   ``I once said that he is a great vice president,'' Reagan said,
``but I know and I've seen that it didn't come easily.''
   ``George Bush is a man of action _ a man accustomed to
command,'' he said. ``The vice presidency doesn't fit easily on
such a man. But George Bush is also a patriot. And so he made it
fit.''
   Reagan said that ``day in, day out, I have sought George Bush's
counsel from the very first day of our administration. ... No one
has been closer to my side and has contributed more to our
successes.''

   When Ralph Hume didn't receive his World War
II medals or discharge papers by 1955, he decided it wasn't ``worth
all the hassle.''
   But 15 days ago he got a surprise _ a package from the Navy that
contained his American Campaign, Asiatic Pacific and Victory medals
he earned while in the South Pacific for five years.
   The package also contained an envelope with a copy of his
discharge papers that were first mailed in 1956 to a Florida base
where Hume had been stationed in the late 1940s.
   ``I was shocked beyond words,'' Hume said Wednesday from his
home in Moores Hill, Ind., about 30 miles from Cincinnati.
   ``I knew in my heart I had earned them, and I guess at that time
I just didn't think it was worth all the hassle,'' he said. ``I
figured I'd go to a surplus store and buy them some day, but I
never did.''
   The package had been mailed this month from the Navy Liaison
Office in St. Louis, Mo. Inside, an envelope postmarked August 1956
had been mailed from the Bureau of Naval Personnel in St. Louis to
Eglin Air Force Base in Florida. Hume had been stationed there
while in the Air Force following his naval career.
   The address, however, had been crossed out and ``return to
sender'' stamped on the envelope.
   Dina Martin of the Navy Liaison Office could confirm only that
the package had come from her office, but not why. Nor did she know
where the items had been for the past 32 years.
   ``We don't send out anything unless there is a request for it,''
Ms. Martin said. Hume, however, said he's hasn't talked to the Navy
since 1955.
   That may change.
   He said he's still waiting for the Purple Heart and a Good
Conduct medal from the Navy and the Air Force.

   A gunman in a car opened fire on a crowd
outside a pool hall, wounding eight people in a gang-related
shooting, police said today.
   No arrests were made, and nobody could provide a description of
the assailant's vehicle, police officer Ralph Askew said.
   The victims were standing outside a pool hall in south central
Los Angeles late Wednesday when 18 to 19 rounds, possibly from an
automatic weapon such as an AK-47 assault rifle, were fired from
the vehicle, Askew said.
   The area is popular with drug dealers, police said.
   Wednesday night's attack apparently was in revenge for a
shooting of a rival gang member earlier this week, Askew said. He
was unable to provide any details of the previous shooting.
   It was believed to be the worst multiple shooting since the
so-called Good Friday drive-by shooting earlier this year, in which
13 people were hit, one fatally.
   In addition to the eight wounded, a pregnant woman was hurt
during the panic, Askew said. She was taken to California Medical
Center after complaining of labor pains, but birth was not imminent
and doctors were trying to stabilize her condition, said hospital
administrator Marlene Delp.
   Another woman, who was shot in the leg, was in good condition at
the hospital, Ms. Delp said. Six other victims were treated and
released at two other hospitals, but authorities could not specify
the condition of the ninth victim.

   Riot police crushed strikes at three
southern coal mines, miners said today. Other strikes continued
along the Baltic seacoast but appeared to falter at a major steel
mill, activists said.
   There were conflicting reports on the status of the strike at
the Lenin shipyard in Gdansk, where indirect talks between the
government and Solidarity leader Lech Walesa were reportedly under
way.
   Strike spokesman Bogdan Olszewski said Walesa and 1,300
supporters spent Wednesday night at the strikebound shipyard. But
state radio estimated only a few hundred people were on strike at
the shipyard.
   The Gdansk port, the country's busiest, remained shut down, said
reporters who visited it today. The government had claimed part of
the port had reopened.
   Gdansk's port director also issued an ultimatum that dockworkers
would be fired unless they signed statements that they are not on
strike by Thursday afternoon, state radio said. But strikers were
ignoring the appeal.
   A prominent Roman Catholic intellectual, Andrzej Stelmachowski,
met with Walesa today as an intermediary to get talks started in
the strikes, said Adam Michnik, an adviser to Walesa.
   Stelmachowski met twice with senior government officials before
coming to Gdansk and his visit to the shipyard was approved,
Michnik said. But it was unclear if he carried any message from the
authorities for the strikers.
   The nine-day wave of strikes is the most serious to confront
communist authorities since Solidarity was crushed in 1981. The
strikers are demanding legalization of the independent union
federation, higher wages and better working conditions.
   Activists said strikes continued at seven mines in the coal-rich
southern region of Silesia and in the Baltic port of Szczecin.
   At the Nowa Huta steel mill outside Krakow, a strike continued
but had weakened since Wednesday, when about 1,000 employees
stopped work, said Maciej Mach, an activist at the plant. Nowa
Huta, which has 30,000 employees, was the scene of a major strike
in May during the last wave of labor unrest. A police raid ended
the previous stoppage.
   Police completely cleared strikers from the Borynia mine in
Jastrzebie and the Morcinek mine in nearby Koszyce during the
night, according to workers from both mines. All strikers were
evicted from the nearby Moszczenica mine except 40 who managed to
elude police and descended into the mine shaft with bread and
lanterns, witnesses said.
   The state-run news agency PAP, in a brief dispatch, said miners
``left the mine'' at Morcinek and also reported the strike ending
at Borynia. It did not mention the Moszczenica mine.
   ``I was convinced the police would just try to intimidate us and
not rush us, but it didn't turn out that way,'' said Francinek
Cichon, a member of the Morcinek strike committee.
   He said police detained Andrzej Andrzejczak, leader of the
Morcinek strike committee, and beat at least six men at the Borynia
mine and an unspecified number at the Morcinek mine. He said none
required hospitalization.
   The raid at the Borynia mine began shortly after a column of
about 100 police vehicles entered Jastrzebie, Cichon said.
   One striker said at least 30 vehicles blocked the mine's main
gate. The miners then linked arms, sat down and began to sing
hymns, said the man, who refused to give his name.
   Riot troops ordered strikers to leave, but the miners did not
budge until the troopers began to drag them out by their clothes,
the miner said. Police herded men into waiting buses and drove them
home, he said. Management told men to return to work Friday.
   Government spokesman Ryszard Straus said all but a few strikers
left the Moszczenica mine and that the mine was working. He said
about 20 strikers were still inside.
   No action was taken at three other mines on strike in Jastrzebie
_ the July Manifesto, 30 Years of People's Poland and the
Jastrzebie Mine, activists said. Before the raids, labor leaders
said the docks, shipyards and 10 coal mines were occupied by
strikers. PAP said eight mines were affected.
   The strikes, which began with a walkout at the July Manifesto
mine, have idled at least 100,000 workers at more than 20
enterprises.
   Strikes in Gdansk closed the last key division of Poland's
busiest waterfront. Tons of high-grade export coal sat in rail cars
at the bulk-loading terminal, idle since Monday.
   Riot police sealed off strikebound enterprises including the
Lenin shipyard, where the strike began Monday.

   A Southern Baptist minister who said he often
watched pornographic films before raping women was sentenced to 10
life terms after pleading guilty to charges in a series of attacks,
prosecutors said.
   Gregory Charles Goben, 28, pleaded guilty Wednesday to five
charges of burglary and sexual assault and five charges of
aggravated sexual assault, Dallas County assistant district
attorney Mike Gillett said.
   Between sobs that made his answers inaudible at times, Goben
said his actions were the result of viewing pornographic material.
   State District Judge Ron Chapman in Criminal District Court of
Dallas sentenced Goben to serve the terms concurrently, Gillett
said. Goben will be eligible for parole in 15 years.
   Goben was a pastor of Outreach Baptist Church in suburban
Garland.
   As part of his plea agreement, Goben agreed to provide
authorities with information on other attacks he will not be
prosecuted for. He also agreed to submit to blood tests to
determine whether he carries any sexually transmitted diseases that
could have been passed on to his victims.

<HEAD>Group Says School Lunches Improving But Contain Too Much Fat</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JILL LAWRENCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   School lunches are improving but many still
contain too much fat _ at least partly because the Agriculture
Department is ignoring its own dietary recommendations, a nutrition
group said today.
   The school lunch program ``is run more as an agriculture support
program rather than as a nutrition program,'' said Ellen Haas,
executive director of Public Voice for Food and Health Policy.
   She said the department issued dietary guidelines in 1980 but
has done little to see that they are followed in the $3.7 billion
national school lunch program serving some 27 million children.
   Many of the foods provided to schools under the commodity
purchase program compound the problem because they are high in fat,
Haas said.
   Public Voice released a list of traditional menus heavy on fried
food, mashed potatoes and sweet deserts and compared that to some
school districts that are serving ``healthfully modified'' menus
that include baked chicken breasts, raw vegetables, fresh fruit,
lowfat milk and salad dressings, and homemade, whole wheat baked
goods.
   Singled out for particular praise was the Denver school
district's main course of baked potato topped with chili _ a
healthful variation on the chili-topped hot dog favored by other
districts.
   Haas said ``we just don't buy'' the idea that kids won't eat
healthy foods and said the trick is to teach them good eating
habits when they're in the lower grades, without access to fast
food at lunchtime.
   ``Our young children are a captive audience. We have an
opportunity here,'' she said. ``We're trying to build healthy
eating behavior.''
   The department ``firmly supports the idea that school lunches
should be consistent'' with the dietary guidelines, said USDA's
Suzanne S. Harris, deputy assistant secretary for food and consumer
services.
   ``However, scientific evidence does not support setting absolute
daily intake levels of sugar, fat or sodium for children,'' she
said in a statement. ``Nutrition strategies warranted for the
general adult population may actually be harmful to children,
particularly low-income children, during periods of growth and
development.''
   She said ``arbitrary decisions to reduce fat may significantly
reduce calorie content. Diets very low in fat must be compensated
with large amounts of carbohydrate often requiring more food than a
child can eat.''
   Public Voice made a number of recommendations, among them:
   _The Agriculture Department should set specific limits on the
amounts of fat, sodium and sugar permitted in school lunches. The
department says there is no scientific consensus on such levels for
children, but Public Voice disagrees.
   _The department should separate the lunch program from the
commodity program and seek out higher-fiber food items for
distribution to schools.
   _The department should establish a national food service
management institute to train and help districts serve better
quality lunches. The department said it has authorized $50,000 to
study the feasibility of setting up such a program in Mississippi.
A report to Congress is due this fall.
   _The department should re-institute a ban on the sale of snack
foods on school grounds. Currently sales are banned only in
cafeterias or during meal periods. The department, citing court
cases, says Congress would have to pass a specific law if more
stringent federal controls are desired.

   The government today freed the country's
most outspoken dissident, and within hours he demanded before a
crowd of 200,000 people an interim government to lead Burma back to
democracy.
   State run radio said the government freed nearly 1,700 people
arrested in riots during the 17-day rule of Sein Lwin, who resigned
Aug. 12 as president after hundreds of thousands protested across
the country.
   More than 400,000 people marched through the streets of the
capital today demanding immediate democracy, an Asian diplomat said
by telephone. Diplomats said as many as 1 million people marched in
the city on Wednesday.
   Civilian President Maung Maung on Wednesday lifted martial law
in the capital, ended curfews and called for a referendum on
multiparty democracy in this isolated Asian nation. For 26 years,
Burma was under rigid one-party rule that turned it into one of the
world's poorest countries.
   Official Radio Rangoon said 1,683 protesters were released from
Insein Jail today. It said all others arrested nationwide since
Aug. 3 in connection with the rioting would be freed except those
accused of serious crimes. Martial law was imposed Aug. 3 in
Rangoon.
   Those freed today included 442 students, 78 government employees
and 27 Buddhist monks, the radio said. The release brought to more
than 2,500 the number the government has freed. It was not known
how many remain jailed.
   Dissident Aung Gyi was among 10 people, including this
correspondent, arrested during raids July 29 and July 30 and also
freed today. The official News Agency of Burma earlier said they
were held for ``attacking the state.''
   Aung Gyi told the outdoor rally in Rangoon today, ``We have
complete trust in President Maung Maung and Chairman of the Council
of People's Justice Tin Aung Hein.'' Maung Maung, in power for only
a week, is the country's first civilian leader since 1962. Aung
Hein also is a civilian.
   But Aung Gyi added: ``I demand Maung Maung and Tin Aung form an
interim government immediately to avoid anarchy and bloodshed in
the country.''
   ``We agree!'' the crowd shouted back.
   This correspondent, on the drive home from Insein Jail, saw
people freely shouting for democracy for the first time in 26 years.
   People of all ages, wearing red headbands symbolizing defiance,
rode in open trucks around the capital shouting, ``Give us
democracy immediately!'' Banners hung across the roads said: ``We
want democracy! We want a multiparty system!''
   No newspapers were available because workers at all six
government-approved dailies were on strike to demand democracy and
press freedom.
   Government ministries were open, but no senior officials were at
their desks and the few junior employees on hand appeared to be
doing little work.
   Many local government offices in Rangoon earlier were ransacked
by mobs and were deserted today.
   After word of the releases spread, a crowd of well-wishers
surrounded Aung Gyi's home. Aung Gyi, a former army brigadier who
sided with former leader Ne Win before they split over differences
in economic policy, quickly began planning for a mass meeting at
his home.
   The release of the 10 detainees was unconditional.
   Maung Maung said Wednesday the 1,000-member congress of the
ruling Burma Socialist Program Party would meet in emergency
session to consider popular demands for an end to authoritarian
rule.
   State-run Radio Rangoon said the session would be Sept. 12.
   Maung Maung's government also has freed more than 700 people
arrested during four days of riots that ended Aug. 12 with the
toppling of Sein Lwin.
   At least 112 people were killed in the unrest, many of them
fired upon by troops as they protested peacefully.
   The London-based human rights group Amnesty International, the
U.S. Embassy in Rangoon and other organizations had called for
their release.
   In a speech broadcast by Radio Rangoon on Wednesday, Maung Maung
said he would ask an emergency party congress to consider the
referendum on ending one-party rule.
   He said if the congress refuses, the 15-member Central Executive
Committee _ which includes himself _ would resign from the party.
If the congress agrees to a referendum, arrangements would
immediately be made for the vote, he added.
   If the people choose a multiparty system, ``general elections
will be held as soon as possible'' and no top government members
will be candidates, Maung Maung said.
   Ne Win led the 1962 coup that toppled an elected government and
began the rule of the Burma Socialist Program Party. The former
general outlawed all other parties in 1964 and began the rigid
socialist and isolationist policies that turned Burma, one of
Southeast Asia's wealthiest nations, into one of the world's
poorest.

   Famous friends of Leonard Bernstein began
arriving in town today to celebrate the 70th birthday of the
legendary conductor and composer at the music festival where he
began his career 50 years ago.
   Among the celebrities participating in tonight's Tanglewood
concert honoring Bernstein's contributions to concert halls and
Broadway are diva Beverly Sills, actresses Lauren Bacall and
Phyllis Newman, songwriter Stephen Sondheim, composer-producer
Quincy Jones, humorist Victor Borge and cellist Mstislav
Rostropovich.
   The staff at the summertime home of the Boston Symphony
Orchestra promised that the birthday bash, a retrospective of
Bernstein's works, would be one of the music world's great events.
   Tanglewood spokeswoman Nancy Patton said actress Elizabeth
Taylor and publisher Malcolm Forbes wouldn't arrive, as planned, in
Forbes' hot-air balloon because Ms. Taylor has suffered a back
injury.
   But she said that Democratic presidential nominee Gov. Michael
S. Dukakis and his wife, Kitty, would attend a Sunday performance
honoring Bernstein, as would Secretary of State George Shultz.
   Bernstein, composer of ``West Side Story,''``Candide'' and
``Mass,'' was among the first graduates of Tanglewood's music
school in 1938 and has taught at the school every summer since.
   Proceeds from the four-day benefit, with tickets ranging up to
$5,000, will go to the music school.

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gov. Michael Dukakis did the right thing when he
vetoed a ``clearly unconstitutional'' 1977 Massachusetts law
imposing criminal penalties on teachers who failed to lead their
classes in the Pledge of Allegiance, state Attorney General James
Shannon said today.
   But Deborah Steelman, domestic policy director for George Bush's
Republican presidential campaign, said, ``Criminal penalties are
not the issue. What's at issue here was leadership.''
   Shannon, a supporter of Dukakis' Democratic presidential bid,
said on ABC's ``Good Morning America'' that the legislation
required criminal penalties against teachers who refused to lead
their classes in the pledge, ``even if their own religious
convictions said they shouldn't do that.''
   In vetoing the bill, Dukakis obeyed an advisory opinion from the
Massachusetts Supreme Court that the legislation was
unconstitutional. The state's governors have been given about 25
advisory opinions by the high court on legislation in recent years,
Shannon said.
   ``Never once, with all those different governors, has any
governor signed into law in Massachusetts a bill which our state's
highest court said was unconstitutional,'' he said.
   ``Since he took an oath of office to uphold the Constitution, he
had an opinion from our state's highest court that that law was
unconstitutional and he did the only thing that he could do under
the circumstances,'' Shannon said of Dukakis.
   On the same program, Steelman said Dukakis was not bound by the
court's advice.
   ``If he wanted to test this issue all he had to do was sign the
bill into law and press his case to the national Supreme Court.
   ``What's at issue here is leadership, whether you've got a
candidate who will stand up for the majority of Americans beliefs,
or whether you've got a candidate who won't even stand up for his
own beliefs.''
   The veto was overriden by the Legislature and the law went on
the books, but it has never been enforced and its constitutionality
has not been challenged.
   The court said the bill was unconstitutional because the state
cannot force citizens to take an oath that may controvert their
religious beliefs.

   Democrat Michael Dukakis today called ``criminal'' Reagan
administration dealings with Panama strongman Manuel Antonio
Noriega while Republican vice presidential candidate Dan Quayle
prepared for a new round of questions about his military and
personal life.
   ``For years, while General Noriega of Panama was actively
involved in the drug business, we were actively in business with
General Noreiga,'' Dukakis said in Cleveland. ``That, my friends,
is criminal.''
   He chided President Reagan for refusing to seek the help of
Latin and Central American leaders to curb drug trafficking and
said if elected he would use more foreign aid to assist those
countries in eradicating drug crops and protecting public officials
whose lives are endangered by drug cartels.
   ``How can we ask our kids to say no to drugs here at home when
we have an administration that's been in bed with General
Noriega?'' Dukakis asked.
   Quayle scheduled a late afternoon news conference after several
days of avoiding reporters' questions about his entry into the
National Guard during the height of the Vietnam War and his
relationship with a female lobbyist.
   Wednesday night, Quayle countered questions about his military
record with thrusts against Dukakis' defense policies. He called it
``one of the worst false impressions'' that Dukakis supported a
strong defense.
   But Democratic running mate, Lloyd Bentsen, came to Dukakis'
defense today. ``The simple truth is this: Gov. Dukakis is a
veteran, a patriot, and an advocate of American strength and
steadiness,'' Bentsen said in remarks prepared for the Veterans of
Foreign Wars convention in Chicago. ``He can be trusted as a
defender of American security _ and as a champion of American
values.''
   Bentsen also bragged of his own record as a World War II bomber
pilot in a contrast to his GOP rival's stint in the Guard.
   ``I have been there. And I yield to no person or party in my
passion for freedom,'' he said.
   The counterchanges occurred against the backdrop of wrangling
over when Dukakis and Vice President George Bush would debate, and
polls showing that Bush's post-convention lead was narrowing.
   Quayle fared well in one of those surveys, which showed support
for his selection as the Republican vice presidential nominee and
his service record during the Vietnam War.
   Quayle, saying ``I can take the heat,'' told an audience of
1,000 current and former National Guard members in St. Louis he was
proud of his Guard service. Quayle has been dogged since his
nomination last week with allegations that he pulled strings to get
into the Guard and avoid duty in Vietnam. He kept the media at bay
Wednesday and did not answer questions.
   Dukakis, touring the industrial states of Michigan, Ohio and
Pennsylvania after picking up the endorsement of the AFL-CIO
leadership in Washington, took aim at the Reagan administration's
claims to seven years of growth and prosperity.
   Conceding that more Americans are working today than at any time
in history, he said average family income has remained stagnant.
   ``I've met too many people who have accepted jobs over the last
eight years that pay a lot less than their old jobs,'' he said in
Grand Rapids, Mich. ``I've met too many couples who are working
harder at two jobs just to stay in place.''
   The AFL-CIO has 14 million members, and President Lane Kirkland
said Wednesday the endorsement should be worth a net of 2.5 million
votes for Dukakis.
   Dukakis, repeatedly criticized by Republicans as being soft on
defense, was assaulted on that front Wednesday by Quayle and Reagan.
   ``One of the worst false impressions Michael Dukakis has put
forward is the idea that he stands for a strong national defense,''
Quayle told the Guard audience. ``Maybe he sincerely believes that.
But he stands for the opposite, and that position has been clouded
over by the distractions of the last few days.''
   In Los Angeles, Reagan told a rally that Quayle, a member of the
Senate Armed Services Committee, ``has more experience dealing with
national security affairs than the head of the other ticket.''
   Reagan also praised Bush as a ``man of action ... accustomed to
command.''
   ``The vice presidency doesn't fit easily on such a man,'' Reagan
said. ``But George Bush is also a patriot. And so he made it fit.''
   Bush jumped on Dukakis on Wednesday for vetoing a 1977
Massachusetts bill that would have required teachers to lead
children in saying the pledge.
   ``I would have signed that bill'' and let the Supreme Court
wrestle with the constitutional question, Bush said in a joint
appearance with Reagan.
   Courts have ruled such laws to be unconstitutional.
   ``If the vice president is saying he'd sign an unconstitutional
bill, then in my judgment, he's not fit to hold the office,''
Dukakis said Tuesday.
   Two polls Wednesday indicated that the surge Bush received
during last week's Republican National Convention already was
dissipating. An NBC-Wall Street Journal survey put the vice
president's margin as 44-39, while a Harris survey pegged it at
49-47. Both leads were within the margin of error of three
percentage points, indicating the race is a dead heat.
   In the NBC-Journal poll, 64 percent said Quayle's military
record should not be an issue and 27 percent said it should. Also,
42 percent of registered voters approved of Quayle as the GOP vice
presidential nominee, 27 percent disapproved and 30 percent were
not sure.
   The two campaigns sparred over the timing of campaign debates
for the fall, with Dukakis aide Paul Brountas saying it was
``inexcusable'' for Bush to decline dates of Sept. 8 and 14
established by organizations interested in staging the
confrontations. Bush campaign chief James Baker said, ``It is
unlikely that a debate can occur prior to Sept. 20.''
   Aides to the two candidates are expected to open face-to-face
negotiations on debates next week in Washington.
   The NBC-Journal poll was conducted Saturday through Monday among
1,762 registered voters, the Harris poll Friday through Monday
among 1,310 likely voters.

<HEAD>Cabinet Minister: Mandela May Be Moved From Hospital</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Jailed black leader Nelson
Mandela may be moved soon from the hospital where he has been
treated for tuberculosis, a Cabinet minister indicated today.
   Information Minister Stoffel van der Merwe declined to say
whether Mandela would go back to Pollsmoor Prison, where he has
been serving a life sentence for plotting an anti-government
sabotage campaign.
   The African National Congress leader, jailed since 1962, was
moved from Pollsmoor to nearby Tygerberg Hospital on Aug. 12.
Doctors say he is expected to recover fully after a recuperation
period of about five months.
   ``Hospitals are for people that are in need of immediate
treatment,'' van der Merwe said. ``If he is not in need of
immediate treatment, then it becomes logical to move him somewhere
else. Whether inside Pollsmoor or outside Pollsmoor is another
question.''
   Asked if Mandela was still in need of immediate care, van der
Merwe replied: ``Not as immediate as before.''
   The government has said it is seriously considering the
possibility of freeing Mandela, whom many blacks consider their
leader. Some officials have suggested that Mandela, after he is
discharged from Tygerberg Hospital, would be moved to a private
clinic and kept there under custody while the government continues
to assess the consequences of his possible relesase.
   About 60 black women from an anti-apartheid organization came to
Tygerberg today with flowers for Mandela. They left the flowers at
a reception desk, then left the hospital dancing and chanting
pro-Mandela slogans.
   The African National Congress is the major guerrilla group
fighting the white-dominated government and its system of apartheid.
   By law and custom, apartheid establishes a racially segregated
society in which the 26 million blacks have no vote in national
affairs. The 5 million whites control the economy and maintain
separate districts, schools and health services.

<HEAD>Evacuated Residents Spend Second Day Away From Homes</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MONTREAL (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   About 3,000 evacuated residents spent a second
day away from their homes today awaiting the results of soil and
water tests to see whether a PCB fire caused long-term
contamination of their community.
   ``We don't know if we and our homes have been contaminated,''
said Louis Charbonneau, one of 150 frustrated evacuees from
suburban St. Basile-le-Grand being sheltered in a local school.
``My wife is pregnant. What tells us that her pregnancy won't be
affected?''
   The first test results were to be made public later today, but
there was no guarantee the residents would be allowed back into
their homes. Most were staying with friends and relatives.
   The fire burned overnight Tuesday at a depot storing 23,400
gallons of oil tainted with PCBs, or polychlorinated biphenyls. The
flames sent a toxic black cloud over a 5.5 square mile area. No one
was seriously injured but at least 50 were treated for lung and
skin irritation.
   Quebec Agriculture Minister Michel Page estimated that 400 cows
could have been contaminated, as well as hundreds of acres of
farmland.
   Authorities sealed off the normally tranquil suburb, 15 miles
east of Montreal, and told residents not to eat fruit or vegetables
from their gardens, drink tap water or use backyard pools until
tests were completed.
   PCBs are suspected of causing cancer and production of the
chemical is banned. But supplies formerly used to cool
hydroelectric transformers are stored at depots throughout the
province, which has no facility capable of neutralizing or
destroying the chemicals.
   Some of the 3,000 residents who were whisked from their homes
hired a lawyer on Wednesday to give legal clout to their anger over
the presence of potentially deadly chemicals in their neighborhood.
   ``Clearly, they're looking at a terribly serious type of damage
from the health, economic, commercial ... points of view,'' said
Montreal lawyer Irwin Liebman.
   Dr. Gaetan Carrier of De Maisonneuve-Rosemont Hospital in
Montreal said exposure to PCBs could cause cancers, liver
disorders, skin rashes, birth defects and spontaneous abortions.
   Quebec Premier Robert Bourassa and Environment Minister Clifford
Lincoln flew to St. Basile on Wednesday to face hostile residents
who have lobbied for years to have the PCB dump removed.
   Bourassa said the incident was ``serious but not dramatic,'' and
promised compensation to the victims.
   But residents were not mollified. ``Get that damned stuff out of
here,'' shouted Charbonneau to cheers and applause from the crowd.
``You have turned our town into the garbage can of the province.''
   Quebec Fire Commissioner Cyrille Delage, directing an inquiry
into the fire, said the warehouse's fire and burglar alarm didn't
work.
   But he said the depot's owner, North Central Dynamics Inc., had
conformed with safety regulations introduced by his department in
1985 for storing PCBs.
   Residents have charged, however, that the lack of a fence,
sprinkler system and security guard made the site a time bomb.
   Lincoln said he intends ``to go after'' the company, whose major
shareholder is former Environment Canada employee Marc Levy.
   No cause of the fire has been determined but officials were
considering the possibility of arson because of the manner in which
the warehouse exploded and blazed.
   Only about 5,720 gallons of the PCB-contaminated oil burned,
leaving the problem of how to dispose of the remainder, officials
said.

<HEAD>Radio Station Decides Not To Air Quayle Parody Song</HEAD>
<DATELINE>INDIANAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A musical spoof of Sen. Dan Quayle's
National Guard service has been banned from the radio station where
it first aired, the station manager said today.
   The parody, ``I Spent the War in Indiana,'' was ruled off-limits
by WFBQ's manager Chris Wheat after a close vote by listeners on
whether to continue playing the song.
   The spoof, co-written by station disc jockey Tom Griswold and
local song writer Rickey Ridell, first aired Monday. It was pulled
by Wheat the next day after listener complaints. Wheat then asked
listeners to vote on whether they wanted to keep hearing it.
   The song spoofs Quayle's alleged use of family influence to get
into the Guard in 1969 while others were sent to Vietnam.
   The final tally of the 24-hour call-in vote was 5,182 votes for
the station to continue playing it and 4,676 votes against playing
it.
   Wheat said the 500-vote margin was inconclusive and he feared
the station would alienate half its listeners if the song continued.
   ``Quayle has not been accused of being a draft dodger,'' Wheat
said. ``There has been no proof of that. There was enough in the
song that we felt it was in our best interest to discontinue it.''
   Wheat said he believes Griswold and his sidekick, disc jockey
Bob Kevoian, ``understand that we wanted to protect the radio
station as a whole, and that it wasn't going to be a yes-no,
black-or-white vote. The vote was close and it led me to believe
that to continue playing it would be a detriment to the station.''
   Griswold said he was considering releasing the song on an
inexpensive cassette with proceeds from sales going to the Vietnam
Veterans of America organization.

   A man pushing a bicycle cart containing a
sleeping bag, duffel bags and a canteen was fatally shot in a crowd
of stunned downtown office workers, the second transient killed
this week, police said.
   The gunman, apparently a transient, casually walked up to the
victim at about 5 p.m. Wednesday, shot him three times with a
pistol concealed in a newspaper and fled through a construction
site, witnesses said.
   Several witnesses said they had seen the victim collecting cans
in the area, a trendy converted warehouse district.
   The Hennepin County medical examiner has not identified the
victim; no arrests were made, police said.
   On Monday, a vagrant was shot and killed in St. Paul. A
36-year-old drifter from Cincinnati has been charged in the
shooting, which police said apparently occurred during an argument.

   A truck carrying 19 tons of dirt
contaminated with toxic PCBs was stolen outside a truck stop and is
the object of a nationwide alert, police said.
   The truck was stolen Wednesday night when the driver stopped to
eat, Lt. David Hartin said.
   The contaminated dirt apparently was destined for a toxic waste
landfill at Emelle in rural southwest Alabama near the Mississippi
line, Hartin said.
   Ray Strickland, a coordinator for the federal Environmental
Protection Agency in Atlanta, said officials believed the truck was
loaded with dirt from the Texas Eastern pipeline leakage which has
required an extensive cleanup.
   State troopers issued a nationwide bulletin to law officers in
an attempt to locate the black 1980 Peterbilt truck. Hartin said
the truck's trailer was clearly marked with yellow and white
placards warning that its contents were dangerous PCBs.
   PCBs, or polychlorinated biphenyls, can cause cancer and can
cause burns on contact.

   According to the radio, floodwaters reached three feet in the
heaviest rainfall in 10 years.
   Most of the houses in Kousseri, on the Chari River just opposite
N'Djamena, Chad, are built of mud and have thatched roofs, easily
destroyed by heavy rainfall.
   A similar torrential downpour struck the town of Garoua on Aug.

<TEXT>
   About 1,500 Taiwanese aborigines marched
Thursday to demand that the government return their ancestral lands.
   The demonstrators, some in aboriginal costumes and wearing
yellow headbands that proclaimed ``Return my land,'' ended their
march at the office of the Executive Yuan, or cabinet, where they
presented a petition.
   It urged the government to expand aboriginal land reservations
and pass a law to protect them. Taiwan has 10 aborigine tribes who
account for 1.6 percent of this island's 20 million people.
   The demonstrators say many of them have to pay rent to live on
ancestral land occupied by the state-run Taiwan Sugar Corp., or
administered by the government's Forestry Agency.
   The Interior Ministry said about 593,000 acres of land have been
reserved for aborigines. The demonstrators said their ancestors had
8 million acres in the 1940s when Japan ruled Taiwan.
   ``The land policy does not make sense,'' said Liu Wen-hsiung, a
leader of the demonstration, ``Why should I rent or buy from the
government land that my family has lived on for generations?''

<HEAD>American Plans to Swim Across Lake Baikal Friday</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   American swimmer Lynne Cox will take the plunge
into Lake Baikal for a 9.92-mile swim Friday, two days earlier than
scheduled because of forecast bad weather, Tass reported.
   The official news agency said in a dispatch Thursday from the
eastern Siberian city of Irkutsk, where Ms. Cox is training, that
the weather service forecast a heavy storm for the weekend. She had
planned her swim in the world's deepest lake for Sunday.
   ``I am now sure that I will swim well the whole
16-kilometer-long distance from the Tolsty Cap to the Listvyanka
settlement,'' she told Tass after swimming Thursday in the Angara
River.
   The main concern will be the water temperature. Lake Baikal,
shaped like a crescent, is rarely warmer than about 50 degrees
Fahrenheit.
   Ms. Cox, 31, of Los Alamitos, Calif., hopes to be the first
person to swim across Lake Baikal, which reaches a depth of 4,800
feet at some points. It is about 1,800 miles east of Moscow and
north of Mongolia.
   Soviet media have been reporting extensively on her
preparations. Radio Moscow, Tass and Soviet newspapers have run
frequent reports.
   Ms. Cox has been making long-distance swims for more than a
decade. She has tackled the English Channel, the Strait of Magellan
and the Cook Strait. Last year she swam 2.7 miles across the frigid
Bering Strait.
   The endurance swim in Lake Baikal is meant to promote
U.S.-Soviet friendship, peace and sports, she said.
   She has been training by staying in Baikal waters for several
hours a day, Tass said.

<HEAD>Report Says 120,000 Caiman Skins Smuggled Into Japan</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Smugglers used stolen or falsified export documents
to ship more than 120,000 skins of a protected species of alligator
into Japan in the past seven months, a wildlife protection
organization said Thursday.
   TRAFFIC Japan, the wildlife trade monitoring group of the World
Wide Fund for Nature, said the smugglers shipped South American
caiman skins by a complex route involving at least seven South
American and Asian countries.
   At least 46 tons of the skins from more than 120,000 alligators
entered Japan in the first seven months of this year through
Thailand alone, the group said.
   It said it believed the skins were part of a larger shipment
that was loaded onto Asian-bound ships off the coast of Uruguay at
the end of last year.
   The declared customs value of the skins was about $3.2 million,
``but retail value would be four to five times more,'' spokeswoman
Cecila Song said. The skins are used in Japan mainly for belts and
watchbands.
   Permits are required for exporting South American caiman skins
under the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species,
an international treaty regulating trade in protected plants and
animals, Ms. Song said.
   Japanese officials allowed the shipments to enter the country
without proper verification of the export documents, the group said.
   It said an eight-month investigation revealed a serious lapse of
treaty administration in Thailand and Japan.
   The group said it began its investigation when Japanese customs
data showed a sudden increase in imports of alligator skins from
Thailand.
   It said Thai authorities confirmed that stolen Thai documents
were used for a shipment of 15,000 caiman skins to Japan, and that
the government of Colombia disputed documents issued in Singapore
that identified Colombia as the source of 35,000 more skins.
   An estimated 200,000 caiman skins, many poached in Brazil, were
loaded on ships off Uruguay in 1987. After Japan initially refused
to allow their entry because of insufficient documentation, the
skins were taken to South Korea and Taiwan, which are not members
of the convention, and to Singapore, the group said.
   But because Japan was likely to scrutinize imports of skins from
those countries, they were moved to Thailand, which is a member of
the convention, the group said.
   It said Japan's Ministry of International Trade and Industry
responded to evidence of illegal caiman trade by beginning a new
voluntary check system on all imports of the skins. Ministry
officials were not available Thursday night for comment.

   Three new opinion polls have found narrow leads
for George Bush in the presidential race, although voters preferred
the Democratic vice presidential nominee to Bush's own running
mate, Sen. Dan Quayle.
   Bush's leads _ five points in one poll released Wednesday, two
points in two others _ fell within their margins of sampling error.
The race was 44 percent to 39 percent in an NBC News-Wall Street
Journal poll, 49-47 in a Harris survey, 48-46 in an ABC
News-Washington Post poll.
   The polls showed increases in Bush's popularity after the
Republican National Convention in New Orleans last week. His
opponent, Michael Dukakis, had led by as many as 18 points after
the Democratic convention.
   However, some pollsters have suggested that Bush's
post-convention rebound was cut short by attention on questions of
whether Quayle used his wealthy family's influence to avoid the
draft during the Vietnam War.
   Pollster Louis Harris said he believed the issue had ``blunted
and badly eroded'' Bush's boost. But Jeff Alderman, pollster for
ABC News, said he had not seen statistical evidence that Quayle had
damaged Bush's standing. And 64 percent in the NBC-Journal poll
said Quayle's military record should not be an issue in the
campaign.
   In Harris' poll, Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, Dukakis' running mate,
outpolled Quayle by 57-40 when voters were asked their preference
for vice president alone. Fifty-two percent rated Bush's choice of
Quayle as ``only fair'' or ``poor,'' compared with 44 percent who
said ``excellent'' or ``pretty good.''
   Quayle fared better in another measure, used in the NBC-Journal
poll: Forty-three percent approved of him as the GOP vice
presidential nominee, while 27 percent disapproved and 30 percent
said they were not sure.
   The NBC-Journal poll was conducted Saturday through Monday among
1,762 registered voters, the Harris poll Friday through Monday
among 1,310 likely voters. Both had error margins of plus or minus
three points.
   The ABC-Post poll was conducted Aug. 17 through Tuesday among
1,123 likely voters, with a margin of error of plus or minus four
points.
   Earlier this week, Bush led by six points in a CBS News poll
conducted Friday through Monday and four points in a Gallup poll
done the same time; those spreads also fell within the three-point
margins of sampling error.
   Another Gallup poll, done on the last day of the convention,
Thursday, and on Friday, found Bush leading by nine points,
slightly beyond the four-point error margin of that survey.

<HEAD>Judge Dismisses Contempt Motion Against Maria DeSillers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By A.J. DICKERSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A judge today spared Maria DeSillers a jail
sentence for contempt of court, ruling she could not be ordered to
surrender records and items bought with donations for her late son
Ronnie's liver transplant.
   Dade Circuit Judge Francis Christie said surrendering the items
``would tend to incriminate her'' in parallel criminal
investigations.
   Ms. DeSillers only smiled slightly as the judge made the
annoncement.
   ``I'm very happy. People have forgotten what Ronnie went
through,'' she said outside the courtroom.
   Ronnie, 7, died in April 1987 while awaiting a fourth transplant
at Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh.
   ``I'm just gratified,'' said her attorney Roy Black, who had
repeatedly raised the issue of self-incrimination during the
two-day contempt hearing.
   Michael Dribin, the attorney for the court-appointed curator,
refused to comment on the ruling.
   The hearing was to determine if Ms. DeSillers should be jailed
for her failure to turn over financial records and surrender
jewelry, clothes, furniture and other items she bought with some of
the $690,000 donated for her son's unsuccessful operations.
   As the hearing ended, however, it was Ms. DeSillers' boyfriend
Jose Castillo who was taken into custody by Metro-Dade police.
Castillo had been sitting supportively behnd Ms. DeSillers during
the proceedings.
   Police spokesman Victor Fernandez said Castillo had pawned a
stolen computer at the same shop he also pawned items allegedly
bought by Ms. DeSillers with donations.
   Earlier during the hearing, Diana Munez told the court she gave
Maria DeSillers $900 in cash for her personal use.
   ``I imagined she would have some need. I put it in purse,'' said
Munez, one of six witnesses who said their contributions were for
both Ronnie and his mother.
   Another witness, Maria Garcia, said she gave $50 for Ronnie and
gave other cash to his mother ``for whatever she needed.''
   In closing arguments Black said his client, who is also under
criminal investigation, has a right against self-incrimination.
   ``The court, I know, has the power to put her in jail, and a lot
of people would applaud,'' Black said. ``I just ask the court to
exercise its discretion and common sense.''
   But Dribin said the matter was clear.
   ``What's at issue is the integrity of the legal system,'' Dribin
said. ``Ms. DeSillers was the custodian of those funds. She has a
resonsibility to account for them.''
   Lawyers handling the estate of the boy ``are trying to show
she's a greedy, uncaring person and that's not so,'' Black said.
   Christie had ruled that the thousands of donations for Ronnie
belong in a trust to pay the boy's outstanding medical bills or to
help sick, needy children.
   The judge had repeatedly ordered Ms. DeSillers to give to
court-appointed estate curator Karen Gievers the financial records
and items allegedly bought with about $200,000 in donations.
   Ms. DeSillers this month surrendered her BMW car but nothing
else, and Ms. Gievers has asked the judge to hold her in contempt.
   Ronnie's plight was widely publicized after more than $4,000
gathered for him by schoolmates was stolen from a classroom closet,
and donations began pouring in from around the world.
   Among donations received were $1,000 from President Reagan and
$200,000 from Miami Beach industrialist Victor Posner.
   Ms. DeSillers gave Children's Hospital a deposit but has refused
to pay the remaining $262,000 medical bill, claiming that her son
received improper care.

   Defense lawyers today asked the Navy to
dismiss a dereliction-of-duty charge against a lieutenant who
sought a court-martial in an effort to clear his name in the
training death of a rescue-school recruit.
   The military judge, Cmdr. Newell D. Krogmann, made no immediate
decision on that request.
   He did, however, grant a defense motion for Vice Adm. N.R.
Thunman, who convened the court-martial, to be called as a witness
to answer questions about whether he might be biased against Lt.
Thomas A. Torchia, 32, of Princeton, Ill.
   The trial was then recessed while lawyers met with the judge to
discuss procedural matters.
   In asking for the court-martial, Torchia put his Navy career on
the line, since he was offered unspecified non-judicial punishment
that would have been less severe than what he faces if convicted at
the court-martial.
   Testimony at a June investigative hearing indicated Airman
Recruit Lee Mirecki, 19, of Appleton, Wis., was literally scared to
death when Navy rescue swimmer instructors allegedly pushed him
back into a pool and held his head underwater after he had panicked
and climbed out during a drill.
   Mirecki had a phobia about being pulled under water, which
triggered heart failure followed by drowning at Pensacola Naval Air
Station, a pathologist testified.
   Torchia, 32, was formerly in charge of the Navy Rescue Swimmer
School.
   A guilty verdict could bring him up to three months of
confinement, loss of pay and a formal reprimand that could made
advancement in the Navy extremely difficult.
   But by opting for a trial he has an opportunity to exonerate
himself.
   The Navy accuses Torchia of negligently failing to ensure that
Mirecki was permitted to drop out of the voluntary course during a
dangerous training exercise although he knew the recruit had tried
to drop out and was afraid of the water.
   Torchia was in his office overlooking the pool talking on the
telephone at the time of Mirecki's death, witnesses said.
   He is one of two Navy men facing courts-martial as a result of
Mirecki's death. Scheduled for trial Monday is Petty Officer 2nd
Class Michael W. Combe, 26, charged with the more serious counts of
involuntary manslaughter, battery and conspiracy to commit battery.
   Combe is accused of holding Mirecki underwater. If convicted, he
could be dishonorably discharged and sentenced to prison for more
than three years. He was denied the option of accepting less severe
non-judicial punishment.
   Four other instructors, all petty officers, accepted
non-judicial punishment that included reductions in rank for two of
them and fines.
   Mirecki died during a drill known as ``sharks and daisies,'' in
which instructors, playing the role of panicked air-crash
survivors, would randomly grab trainees in head holds.
   Students were supposed to pull the instructors under to break
their grip, then put them in rescue holds and tow them to the side
of the pool.
   After Mirecki was forced back into the pool, Combe put a head
hold on him, according to investigative testimony. Witnesses
differed on whether Mirecki collapsed while in the instructor's
grasp or extricated himself and collapsed while towing Combe.

   Police firing anesthesia darts to subdue a
lion and a tiger that escaped their circus cage miscalculated the
dosage and killed the animals, the circus manager said.
   Two tigers and two lions escaped Wednesday their cage via an
open door at the Circo Ruso in this northern city while an animal
trainer was rehearsing a new routine with them, manager Angel
Cristo said.
   Cristo said he and several assistants managed to return one of
the tigers to the cage, but the other three animals fled the circus.
   Police found the animals nearby. One of the officers armed with
the darts fired on the animals.
   ``Unfortunately the dose used to put the two lions and the tiger
to sleep was excessive, and two of the animals died from a heart
attack,'' Cristo said.
   The other lion was returned to the circus. No one was injured,
Cristo said.

<HEAD>More Flooding Expected From Tropical Depression That Killed Three</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A tropical depression blamed for
three deaths in Puerto Rico began moving over the Dominican
Republic and Haiti today with more flooding expected, forecasters
said.
   The depression was centered about 35 miles west-southwest of
Santo Domingo and was packing winds of 35 mph with storm-force
gusts, according to a 6 a.m. EDT advisory by the National Hurricane
Center in Miami.
   ``The movement over land is the only thing that's keeping this
from strengthening into a tropical storm,'' said forecaster Bob
Case.
   The depression, moving toward the west-northwest at 15 mph, was
expected to trigger rainfall totals of 5 to 10 inches in the
Dominican Republic, where flash-flood warnings were in effect.
   Flash-flood warnings remained in effect for Puerto Rico, where
6.6 inches of rain were reported over the past 24 hours.
   Two men and a 12-year-old boy were killed in Puerto Rico in two
separate incidents Wednesday night when trees crushed their cars as
they were driving along rural roads, police said.
   State Secretary Sila Calderon declared a state of emergency and
National Guard units were mobilized to rescue families trapped by
swollen rivers.
   In Mayaguez on the western side of the island, the Civil Defense
ordered hundreds of residents in low-lying areas to abandon their
homes.
   More than 100 homes in different parts of the island were
destroyed or seriously damaged by flooding, according to the Civil
Defense.
   Education Department Secretary Awilda Aponte Roque closed public
schools throughout Puerto Rico because of flooding danger.
   A second depression remained far off in the Atlantic, about
1,000 miles west-northwest of the Cape Verde Islands off west
Africa. It was moving west at about 17 mph and had sustained winds
of 35 mph.
   ``As far north as it is now, the chances of it getting here are
pretty slim,'' Case said.
   Depressions are upgraded to tropical storms when their sustained
winds reach 39 mph and to hurricanes when winds hit 74 mph.
   There have been two tropical storms so far in the 1988 Atlantic
Ocean hurricane season, but neither reached hurricane strength. The
season runs from June 1 to Nov. 30.

   Here are excerpts from the speech delivered by Martin Luther
King Jr. on Aug. 28, 1963, in Washington, D.C.:
   I say to you today, my friends, so even though we face the
difficulties of today and tomorrow, I still have a dream. It is a
dream deeply rooted in the American dream.
   I have a dream that one day this nation will rise up and live
out the true meaning of its creed: ``We hold these truths to be
self-evident: that all men are created equal.''
   I have a dream that one day on the red hills of Georgia the sons
of former slaves and the sons of former slave owners will be able
to sit down together at the table of brotherhood. I have a dream
that one day even the state of Mississippi, a state sweltering with
the heat of injustice, sweltering with the heat of oppression, will
be transformed into an oasis of freedom and justice.
   I have a dream that my four little children will one day live in
a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin
but by the content of their character.
   I have a dream today!
   I have a dream that one day, down in Alabama, with its vicious
racists, with its governor having his lips dripping with the words
of interposition and nullification, one day right there in Alabama,
little black boys and little black girls will be able to join hands
with little white boys and little white girls as sisters and
brothers. ...
   So let freedom ring from the prodigious hilltops of New
Hampshire; let freedom ring from the mighty mountains of New York;
let freedom ring from the heights of the Alleghenies of
Pennsylvania; let freedom ring from the snow-capped Rockies of
Colorado; let freedom ring from the curvaceous slopes of
California. But not only that, let freedom ring from Lookout
Mountain of Tennessee; let freedom ring from every hill and
molehill in Mississippi _ from every mountainside, let freedom ring.
   And when this happens, when we allow freedom to ring, when we
let it ring from every village and every hamlet, from every state
and every city, we will be able to speed up that day when all of
God's children, black men and white men, Jews and Gentiles,
Protestants and Catholics, will be able to join hands and sing in
the words of the old Negro spiritual:
   ``Free at last. Free at last. Thank God Almighty, we are free at
last.''

<HEAD>Soviets Take First Step Toward Foster Care Program</HEAD>

   The Soviet Union has taken the first step toward a
paid foster care program, changing a system that for years has
relied on orphanages as the only official means of supporting
children without parents.
   The Communist Party newspaper Pravda reported Thursday on a
decree from the Council of Ministers tht laid the groundwork for a
foster program, but was vague on its details.
   Pravda said that under the program, foster parents would be
recruited to move into newly constructed ``children's towns,''
where they would be responsible for the rearing of up to 10
children.
   ``In such children's settlements, apartment houses, a school, a
sports center and gardens should be included. Such settlements will
be built with local climatic and social conditions taken into
consideration,'' Pravda said.
   But the article did not say how much foster parents would be
compensated, give guidelines on who would be considered a foster
parent or under what circumstances the person would qualify for
financial support.
   Over the years, some Soviets voluntarily have taken parentless
children into their homes, but have received no compensation from
the state.
   If support was forthcoming, it usually was in the form of an
offer of food rationing coupons from the Soviet Children's Fund, a
charitable organization that was formed only recently.
   The decree said foster parents should be given priority
consideration in booking state-provided vacation lodging and will
remain at full pension, if they are elderly or retired.
   ``Foster parents have to be supported by their respective
offices and organizations, they have to be given places at rest
houses and santoriums,'' the article said.
   For years, public discussions on parentless children centered on
those who were orphaned. But lately the official media has
acknowledged that some children are homeless because of abusive or
alcoholic parents, or an unwed mother unwilling to bear the stigma
or responsiblity of single parenthood.
   Officials said three years ago that 300,000 children were being
reared in state orphanages and most were placed there by single
mothers.
   In recent years, the media has published reports detailing
corruption in some orphanages, where children's food is sold on the
black market and they are improperly clothed and housed.
   The Council of Ministers said authorities will build 30
children's towns, which appear similar in concept to cluster homes
in the West, and 150 to 200 children will be housed there.

   Israeli helicopter gunships today rocketed
densely populated districts and Palestinian bases inside a refugee
camp.
   Police said 10 people, including one guerrilla, were wounded in
the six-minute attack south Lebanon's Ein el-Hilweh refugee camp
that began at 5:45 p.m. Police said three Israeli helicopter
gunships flew in from the Mediterranean Sea to blast their targets.
   The camp is on the outskirts of Sidon, 25 miles south of Beirut.
   The helicopters fired at least 10 rockets at civilian
neighborhoods and Palestine Liberation Organization bases on the
main Ein el-Hilweh road, usually crowded at that time of day.
Police said three rockets crashed on the main road, wounding nine
civilians and damaging a car.
   Sidon-based reporters said black smoke billowed from the
stricken targets in Ein el-Hilweh, the largest refugee camp in
Lebanon with 60,000 people.
   Police said four rockets hit an empty two-story base used by the
Palestine Popular Struggle Front, the fourth time in one year the
center has been raided by the Israelis.
   Three other rockets slammed into the one-story office of George
Habash's Marxist group, the Popular Front for the Liberation of
Palestine. Those rockets wounded a guerrilla from the front and
blasted gaping holes in the building.
   A spokesman for the Israeli army command in Jerusalem confirmed
the raid and said its aircraft had returned home safely. He
provided no other details, but Israeli military sources confirmed
that helicopter gunships were used.
   Both officials spoke on condition of anonymity.
   The raid was Israel's 13th into Lebanon this year. By police
count, 65 people have been killed and 93 wounded in the 12 previous
air raids.
   The last attack was on Aug. 9, when Israeli warplanes bombed a
guerrilla-run radio station in southern Lebanon.

   A National Guard tank broke free
from a trailer and took a spin down a residential street, but
caused no damage or injuries in its 25-yard dash.
   ``It was the craziest thing I've ever seen,'' said resident
Debbie Trudeau. ``I was in the kitchen at about 3:45 p.m. when I
heard the tank's transport trailer hit the ground.
   ``I looked out the window and it (the trailer hitch) just broke
to pieces and the tank rolled off its bed. Then the hitch drilled
into the ground,'' Ms. Trudeau said.
   The truck carrying the M68 tank had left the freeway and was
traveling on a residential street when the tank rolled off the
truckbed Wednesday afternoon.
   The tank came to a stop without causing any damage or injuries,
said Deputy Chris Allen of the San Bernardino County sheriff's
substation in Rancho Cucamonga, located about 45 miles northeastof
downtown Los Angeles.
   The tank was en route to its home base in Colton when the
accident happened.

   Republican vice presidential candidate Dan
Quayle said today he was tired of talking about the controversy
surrounding his military record, saying ``I've answered questions
for seven days now.''
   The Indiana senator said he thought the public also had heard
enough on the issue.
   ``The American people want to talk about the future. I believe
that they're getting a little sick and tired of going back twenty
years,'' he told reporters en route to the Missouri State Fair.
   After avoiding reporters for days, Quayle made himself available
several times today and scheduled a late afternoon news conference.
   On Wednesday, Quayle depicted himself as an expert on defense
matters during a speech before a supportive National Guard group,
and said he won't ``run away'' from the dispute over his own
military record.
   Speaking to a uniformed crowd of 1,000 current and former Guard
members, the Republican vice presidential nominee sought to answer
allegations that he pulled strings to get into the Guard and avoid
duty in Vietnam.
   ``I was not seeking special treatment. I wasn't looking for
favors,'' Quayle said. He said when he joined the Guard in 1969,
``I had no reason to be ashamed of my service.''
   ``And you know what, I'm sure as hell not ashamed of it now!''
Quayle said as his audience cheered.
   Quayle's speech came after a day in which he was carefully
shielded from reporters. Aides acknowledged that they were trying
to shift the focus away from questions about Quayle's own military
record and personal life as he opened his first solo campaign trip.
   David Prosperi, Quayle's press secretary, said the speech was
intended to deal with the Guard question and then ``go beyond to
talk about defense'' and other issues the campaign wanted to stress.
   Quayle sprinkled his speech with sarcastic remarks about ``my
newfound friends in the news media.''
   ``I did in fact eat graham crackers'' as a youngster, ``was very
partial to Superman and Dennis the Menace comic books'' and
``traded Valentine cards with a beautiful second-grader named Penny
who lived across the street,'' Quayle said in a mock ``tell-all''
moment with the audience.
   He said, however, that the scrutiny is a consequence of his vice
presidential candidacy and he is prepared to confront that.
   ``It's not fun, but I knew what I was getting into and I can
tell you, I can take the heat,'' Quayle said.
   In his speech, Quayle said he believed Democratic presidential
nominee Michael Dukakis ``is enjoying this firestorm because it's
helped distract people from the issues of this campaign.''
   He attacked Dukakis for an ``anti-defense attitude'' for
opposing such weapons systems as the Strategic Defense Initiative
and the MX missile.
   ``One of the worst false impressions Michael Dukakis has put
forward is the idea that he stands for a strong national defense,''
Quayle said. ``Maybe he sincerely believes that. But he stands for
the opposite, and that position has been clouded over by the
distractions of the last few days.''
   Quayle had a good-natured encounter at the Lexington, Ky.,
airport with his Democratic counterpart, Sen. Lloyd Bentsen of
Texas, who had just warned Southern state legislators not to ``risk
youthful indiscretion'' in someone like Quayle who might someday
ascend to the presidency.
   Quayle ignored reporters' questions seeking a response to
Bentsen's remarks.
   Bentsen had noted Quayle's abrupt about-face earlier this week
in which he told a Veterans of Foreign Wars convention that
``youthful indiscretion'' was to blame for his vote last month
against elevating the Veterans Administration to a Cabinet-level
department.

   Severe overcrowding at two Brooklyn psychiatric
centers led the state commissioner of Mental Health to declare a
state of emergency today, a spokesman for the agency said.
   The declaration will allow the state to immediately transfer 190
patients from the state-run Kingsboro Hospital and 50 from the
Kings County Psychiatric Center, a city-run facility, said
spokesman Steve Osborn.
   ``We're declaring a state of emergency because the extreme
overcrowding is affecting the life and safety of patients at both
hospitals,'' said Osborn, a spokesman for Mental Health
Commissioner Richard C. Surles.
   Most of the patients will be transferred to state facilities on
Long Island and Rockland, Dutchess and Orange counties, he said.
   The Kings County Psychiatric Center has 160 beds for mental
health patients and a current population of 195, Osborn said.
   Matters are worse at the neighboring Kingsboro State Psychiatric
Center, where there are 566 beds and 736 patients, he said.
   The result is that psychiatric patients have been sandwiched six
in a room instead of four, and have been left in beds in hallways
and day rooms, Osborn said. At Kings County, patients have been
left in the emergency room for days, waiting for a room, he added.

<TEXT>
   Ronald Reagan will have been out of office
for over two years _ and 80 years old _ when a library housing his
papers and recalling his time in office opens on a cactus-covered
hillside northwest of here, if all goes according to plan.
   Officials originally hoped to make it the first presidential
library to open while the president it honors was still in office,
but those intentions were scuttled by years of controversy and
delay.
   Nonetheless, plans are moving now.
   The city council of Simi Valley, which must provide water and
sewer service to the site on a cactus-covered hillside northwest of
Los Angeles, gave its approval this week.
   ``Everything is chugging along pretty nicely,'' said Ann Rock, a
city council member. ``It looks like we're going to go ahead on
it.''
   Ventura County, which must grant a conditional use permit for
construction, will hold an environmental hearing Aug. 31.
   ``We don't anticipate or see any snail darter incident, although
anything can happen,'' said Carl Morehouse, a staff planner for the
Ventura County government.
   The library will be reached by a winding road that will rise
from an altitude of about 920 feet to 1,190 feet above sea level.
The site commands a spectacular view of the countryside and, on a
clear day, the peaks of the offshore Channel Islands in the
distance.
   It will be the ninth presidential library in the National
Archives system and the first west of the Rockies. The others are
for Herbert Hoover at West Branch, Iowa; Franklin D. Roosevelt at
Hyde Park, N.Y.; Harry S. Truman in Independence, Mo.; Dwight D.
Eisenhower at Abilene, Kan.; John F. Kennedy in Boston; Lyndon B.
Johnson in Austin, Texas; Gerald R. Ford in Ann Arbor, Mich., and
Jimmy Carter in Atlanta.
   Officials of the Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation are
aiming at breaking ground this fall, possibly in September. Opening
date is tentatively scheduled for 1991.
   Plans to have Reagan's presidential library open while he was
still in the White House were snagged in a controversy over the
site.
   Efforts to locate the library on the campus of Stanford
University in Palo Alto fell through in April 1987 ran into stiff
opposition from faculty and city landowners.
   Fund-raising also did not go as rapidly as hoped, and not all of
the currently estimated cost of $45 million has been raised.
Officials won't say how much they still need.
   Even in its new location, the project aroused some controversy,
particularly since the part of the 100-acre site on which the
building will stand lies within a greenbelt maintained by a
decade-old, non-binding agreement among the communities of Simi
Valley, Moorpark and Thousand Oaks.
   The real estate development firm of Blakeley-Swartz, which
donated the land, originally announced plans to build a 300-room
hotel and conference center on 540 acres adjacent to the library
site.
   Officials of the three communities told the county they did not
want the library ``used as means for further land-use concessions
on any property within the greenbelt.''
   So plans for the hotel and conference center have been dropped.
   In addition to the switch to a Southern California site, there
have been some changes in design.
   When the library was to be built at Stanford, a separate public
affairs institute was planned. Now the project has been scaled down
to just the library, with some rooms for conferences and work space
for Reagan when he visits.
   The basic, mission-style building designed by architects Hugh
Stubbins and Associates for the Stanford site has been retained for
the new location. An arched colonnade that had been designed to
harmonize with other Stanford buildings was dropped in favor of
straight columns and wooden beams more typical of mission
architecture.

<HEAD>Dutch Call For Joint European Spy Satellite</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROLAND DE LIGNY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Western European nations must be
prepared to participate in a joint spy satellite program because of
increasing work load of American spacecraft, an advisory report
said Thursday.
   The confidential report by a group of Dutch defense experts was
presented to Defense Minister Willem van Eekelen and Foreign
Minister Hans van den Broek.
   Its main recommendation reflects the Netherlands' increasing
efforts to bolster military cooperation in Western Europe, along
with the region's economic cooperation.
   A major result of such cooperation would be a closer involvement
of France in the defense of Western Europe. Although France is a
member of the Atlantic Alliance, it does not take part in NATO's
integrated military command.
   ``A truly joint spy satellite program would be important for a
number of reasons, and the strengthening of the European pillar
within NATO would be one of them,'' a source within the
Netherlands' defense establishment told The Associated Press in a
Thursday interview. He spoke in exchange for anonymity.
   France, Italy and Spain are developing the Helios espionage
satellite, which costs more than $1 billion and is scheduled to be
launched in 1992.
   ``It's far too late (for other European NATO member nations) to
get a foot in the door of the Helios project'' that began in 1986,
said the Dutch source, who is familiar with the contents of the
advisory report.
   The report recommended the Dutch government participate in
Helios' successor, believed to become operational somewhere in the
first decade of the next century, according to the source.
   At present, the Dutch armed forces, as well as those of most
other allies, are dependent on those American satellite photos that
the U.S. government allows to be dissiminated, the source said.
   ``But we forecast that the work load of the American spy
satellites will increase sharply in the coming years, what with the
verification work emanating from the INF treaty, and in the near
future possibly a START agreement,'' said the source.
   He was referring to the recently-ratified Intermediate-Range
Nuclear Force treaty between the United States and the Soviet
Union, which eliminates all medium- and shorter-range nuclear
missiles.
   In Geneva, the superpowers are currently engaged in negotiations
on sharp reductions in their strategic nuclear arsenals, talks
known under their acronym START.
   ``It would be a good thing if the European allies were not too
dependent on the Americans in their intelligence-gathering from
space, and launched their joint satellite in the future,'' the
source said.
   ``And we're especially looking at France for such cooperation''
because the French lead in space expertise, according to the source.
   The report's recommendations, which have not yet been adopted as
official government policy, marked another step on the long road
toward closer European military cooperation, a concept strongly
favored by the Dutch.
   Last year, the Netherlands lobbied for the formation of a
Western European naval presence in the Persian Gulf, arguing that
Europe has a vital interest in keeping open the area's oil shipping
lanes.
   At the time, the Dutch were chairing the Western European Union,
an informal, seven-nation defense forum including France. The
efforts led to the dispatch of a joint Dutch-Belgian mine-sweeping
force, which operated under the umbrella of British warships in the
gulf.

   General Motors Corp. on Thursday began
recalling more than 600,000 1983 Oldsmobiles and Buicks to replace
an emissions control component that may have quit working.
   The Environmental Protection Agency said a defective thermal
vacuum switch causes the cars to exceed federal standards on
emission of gasoline vapors and carbon monoxide.
   GM said the switch, which allows fuel vapor to be burned by the
engine, fails because rubber compounds used in its construction
deteriorate after years of contact with gasoline.
   The defective switch has no effect on the operation of the car,
GM said.
   The automaker said installation of the new switch would take
less than one hour. The EPA estimated the time of repair at 20
minutes.
   The agency said 613,582 vehicles, all with 5-liter engines, are
involved in the recall. They are the 1983 Oldsmobile Cutlass
Supreme, Cutlass Cruiser, Delta 88, Ninety-Eight, Toronado and
Custom Cruiser, and the 1983 Buick Le Sabre, Estate Wagon, Electra
and Riviera.

   Democratic vice presidential candidate Lloyd
Bentsen, booed repeatedly, told veterans today that Michael Dukakis
``can be trusted'' to maintain the nation's defense.
   ``I have been in the crosshairs of the enemies of freedom,'' the
67-year-old former World War II bomber pilot told a Veterans of
Foreign Wars convention. ``I have been there. And I yield to no
person or party in my passion for freedom.''
   Republicans, Bentsen said, ``have behaved as if the flag were a
partisan and not a personal virtue.''
   The Reagan administration has relied on ``extreme partisanship
and overheated campaign rhetoric instead of a patient, bipartisan
approach to national security issues,'' he said in a speech text
released prior to delivery.
   ``The simple truth is this: Gov. Dukakis is a veteran, a
patriot, and an advocate of American strength and steadiness,''
Bentsen said. ``He can be trusted as a defender of American
security _ and as a champion of American values.''
   Bentsen was well received personally, receiving standing
ovations when he arrived and when he left. But he was interrupted
by boos four times, three times when he mentioned Dukakis; once
when he referred to former President Carter.
   Stopped by booing after he said that Carter had begun the
defense build-up, he told the crowd: ``Pretty hard for some of you
to accept that.''
   After the speech, Bentsen said he thought there had been some
organized opposition to the speech. Republicans, he said, ``were
desperate to find an issue.''
   Bentsen cited Dukakis' emphasis on improving non-nuclear
weapons, maintaining a nuclear deterrent, support of the Stealth
bomber and a new submarine-launched missile. Dukakis, he said,
would manage military spending more effectively.
   While praising his running mate, Bentsen blasted both Vice
President George Bush and Sen. Dan Quayle, R-Ind., for supporting
cuts in veterans health care programs.
   While avoiding direct criticism of Quayle for serving in the
National Guard during the Vietnam War, Bentsen's highlighting of
his own military record was an indirect swipe.
   ``I think that the breadth of experience that I've had, and the
tests that I've undergone, some of the things that happened to me
early on, in combat, make you grow up pretty fast,'' the Texas
senator said Wednesday in a speech to the Southern Legislative
Conference, a group of state legislators he said included many
Reagan Democrats.
   He suggested that Quayle lacked the maturity needed to lead the
country, a requirement of someone who would be vice president.
   Bentsen's speech today to the Veterans of Foreign Wars
convention in Chicago is three days after Vice President George
Bush and Quayle addressed the group. One of the objectives of
Bentsen's speech was to contest the GOP contention that the
Democrats are weak on defense, campaign aides said.
   His speech was drafted with the help of Dukakis speechwriters so
it would be in harmony with an address the Massachusetts governor
plans to deliver in early September before the American Legion.
   More conservative than Dukakis on defense issues, Bentsen has
supported aid to the Nicaraguan Contra rebels, the MX Missile and
the B-1 bomber. Dukakis opposes those policies, but Bentsen has
been trying to highlight areas where the two men agree, such as
strengthening conventional forces and more effective management of
the Pentagon.
   After the VFW speech and a luncheon in Chicago, Bentsen was
scheduled to attend a veterans' celebration at a county fair in
Trenton, Tenn.
   In stepping up his criticism of Quayle, Bentsen has begun citing
the Indiana senator's voting record on veterans bills.
   Among those is Quayle's vote against creating a Cabinet-level
veterans department _ a position Quayle reversed before the VFW
earlier this week with the explanation that his earlier position
was ``youthful indiscretion.''
   ``A youthful indiscretion? My friends, that vote occurred only
five weeks ago,'' Bentsen said. ``I don't think America can risk
youthful indiscretion in someone who could become our president at
any moment.''
   Bentsen spent Wednesday night in Milwaukee, where he took a boat
ride up the Milwaukee River and visited a sausage factory store.
   Bentsen had planned to complete a four-day campaign swing
Friday, but it has been extended to allow Bentsen a day in Texas at
week's end at the same time Bush is campaigning there. Both men
claim Texas as their home state.

   A bus company's most faithful customer
will get free rides for a year after racking up almost 500,000
miles in 45 years of commuting to and from work.
   Texas Bus Lines Inc. gave Helen Csontos the pass in honor of her
estimated 22,000 Galveston-La Marque round trips.
   Ms. Csontos, her arms filled with a bouquet of flowers presented
by Texas Bus President Scott Keller and Galveston Mayor Jan
Coggeshall, found herself surrounded by photographers, camera crews
and reporters as she stepped off the bus from work Wednesday.
   ``I'm a little flabbergasted, I guess,'' the 72-year-old
Galveston native said of all the attention. ``It's real thrilling.''
   Ms. Csontos, who never learned to drive, began commuting on May
1, 1943, her first day on the job as a laboratory technician in a
doctor's office. Her fare then was $1, but it has since increased
to $5.75, for the round-trip of less than 23 miles.
   ``I haven't figured it out, but I imagine I have bought a bus in
that many years,'' she said.
   The bus line keeps good tabs on their best customer, whom they
call ``Miss Helen.''

<HEAD>City Agency Gives Initial Approval to Ambitious Watts
Redevelopment Project</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Community Redevelopment Agency board gave
initial approval to the largest redevelopment plan in Los Angeles
history, an ambitious refurbishing of homes and businesses in the
blighted Watts area.
   The plan approved Wednesday proposes to redevelop more than
1,900 acres of decaying homes, apartments, small businesses,
industrial sites and public housing projects.
   Also envisioned are new factories on abandoned sites, additional
housing, a vocational school and shops and restaurants near the
historic Watts Towers by the end of the century.
   The South Central Los Angeles community of Watts once flourished
with tire and auto plants and other factories. But it was ravaged
after the 1965 black protests that resulted in riots and fires.
   Although there are nice homes and small businesses in Watts, it
is dominated by vacant lots, boarded-up stores, overcrowded slum
apartments and the abandoned factory sites.
   In the first step of the project, the CRA authorized an aerial
survey of a 3-square-mile area.
   ``We see that the time is ripe,'' said Councilwoman Joan Milke
Flores, who represents most of the area and spearheaded the
project. ``All of this will come together to provide some jobs and
increase business development in the area.''
   ``This is what the promise of redevelopment is about, helping
communities in great need,'' added Councilman Robert Farrell, who
represents part of the area.
   More than 56,000 people live in the area and 86 percent of them
are black and 13 percent Hispanic. Most are poor, with an average
income of $11,427. Most residents rent their homes and have not
completed high school.
   Flores said she hopes the project will be funded through private
funds and with federal and state funds from enterprise zone
programs, in which businesses are granted tax breaks and other
incentives to hire the unemployed.

   Dozens of townspeople, many wearing ``Peace
on Earth'' buttons, turned out today to greet a Soviet delegation
from Dickson, Siberia, outside President Reagan's boyhood home.
   ``We are carrying with us warmest greetings from all the
residents of Soviet Dickson,'' said visiting Mayor Nikolai T.
Kartamyshev, speaking through an interpreter from the porch of the
house in this small northern Illinois city. ``We are enthusiastic
because of your warm attitude and generous attitude towards us.''
   Kartamyshev said he sensed a ``general feeling of comradeship.''
   Mayor James E. Dixon of the Illinois city, who worked to make
the weeklong goodwill summit a reality, said, ``It's been a long,
difficult road making this connection, but we're glad we made it.''
   He also said the Soviets were suffering from jet lag after a
missed airline connection in New York and their arrival in Illinois
on Wednesday.
   ``But we're not tired,'' said Soviet interpreter Nikolai S.
Vishnevsky of Moscow.
   The delegation then entered the Reagan home for a private tour.
   ``It's interesting because he's the president and this is where
he spent his childhood,'' Kartamyshev had said earlier. ``We
connect Reagan with the positive changes in the relations between
our countries.''
   Vishnevsky said the Dickson-Dixon summit, beginning today, marks
the first time a delegation from a small town in the Soviet Union
has traveled to its sister city in the United States.
   ``The people of Dickson are interested in almost everything
about life in America, because we have very scarce information
about your country and your people, and the information we have is
almost entirely about politics,'' he said.
   First on the agenda today for Kardamyshev, Vishnevsky and
journalist Boris S. Ivanov was a private tour of Reagan's boyhood
home with Mayor Dixon, great-great-great-grandson of the town's
founder.
   The two-story frame house on the south side is where Ronald
``Dutch'' Reagan, son of a shoe salesman and a dress maker, lived
from 1920 until he left for college in 1928.
   Born in nearby Tampico, Reagan moved to Dixon with his family
when he was 9, and it was here that he began to show an interest in
drama, politics and athletics.
   ``We want to give them a feeling for the community where the
president came from,'' Dixon said. ``We want to show them what kind
of community impacted on his personality and ultimately on his
presidency.''
   Storefront signs proclaim ``Peace on Earth'' written in English
and Russian, and buildings display flags of the United States and
the Soviet Union.
   Dixon officials also hoped to impress the Soviets with their 7
miles of petunia-lined streets, scenic Rock River setting and the
friendly, hard-working, peace-loving residents in the town of
15,700.
   Not everything has gone smoothly. Ivanov dryly noted that the
visitors had to wait in line two hours in New York before getting
their passports and visas checked, and missed a flight to Chicago.
   ``It's beautiful here,'' he said, ``but your bureaucracy is much
worse than ours.''
   Dickson, Siberia, is a city of 5,000 on the Taimyr Peninsula in
extreme northern Siberia, above the Arctic Circle, and boasts of
being the northernmost community in the Soviet Union.
   The city, a staging area for early Arctic explorers, is named
for Oskar Dickson, a 19th century Swedish merchant who provided
supplies for the expeditions.
   Its Illinois sister-city was founded as a Rock River ferry-boat
crossing in 1830 by John Dixon. Pioneers battled Indians for
control of the fertile river valley and a fort was established to
preserve peace. One member of its militia was Abraham Lincoln.
   Dixon and Dickson established a sister-city relationship in
early 1987. But Dickson, Siberia, was closed to visitors from other
countries until last year, its officials said.

<TEXT>
   The pilot of the so-called third plane
connected to the 1986 collision of an Aeromexico airliner and a
private plane over suburban Cerritos was dismissed as a defendant
in lawsuits filed by victims' families.
   Roland Paul Furman of Buena Park did not contribute to the
collision by making a radio call to an air traffic controller, U.S.
District Judge David V. Kenyon ruled Wednesday.
   Documents prepared by Furman's attorney, Stephen L. Nelson, said
Furman's plane was 10 miles from the collision when he communicated
with controller Walter White.
   Nelson said White became aware of Furman's plane on his radar
eight to 20 seconds after the airliner and the single-engine Piper
Archer collided on Aug. 31, 1986. Eighty-two people were killed,
including everyone aboard the two planes and some people on the
ground.
   Nelson said Furman had been named in at least 25 lawsuits.
   ``The claims against Furman are based on the theory that his
presence in the Los Angeles Terminal Control Area distracted White
from Aeromexico and (the Piper Archer) somehow contributed to the
cause ... (but) undisputed facts in the case undercut this
theory,'' Kenyon wrote.

   Authorities said today they have
arrested a former U.S. soldier and charged him with espionage for
leading an international spy ring that sold military secrets to the
Soviet Union over the past 10 years.
   Chief Federal Prosecutor Kurt Rebmann said the charges against
former Army Sgt. Clyde Lee Conrad involved an ``especially grave
case'' of supplying American and NATO defense secrets to the
Soviets through the spy ring.
   The most recent delivery took place last month in Vienna,
Rebmann said.
   ``We can't exclude the possibility that millions of dollars are
involved'' in the case, said Alexander Prechtel, a spokesman for
Rebmann. He said it was too soon to say exacly what damage was done
to NATO.
   The U.S. State Department said in a statement in Washington,
``We understand that there has been an apprehension by West German
authorities, but do not consider it appropriate to comment at this
time.''
   But FBI spokesman Milt Ahlerich said: ``This is a very
significant matter. The interest to this country is acute. It is a
matter of intense interest to the FBI.''
   Authorities in Sweden said today they have detained two
Hungarian-born brothers who confessed to working for the Hungarian
secret service and who apparently were members of an international
spy ring.
   Sven-Olof Hakansson, chief prosecutor of the Goteborg district,
said the men, both physicians who immigrated in the 1960s, were
detained on Tuesday with radios and coded messages.
   ``We have worked in cooperation with German police because it
was very important to arrest these people at the same time so they
could not warn each other,'' said Torsten Bjorkhede, chief of the
Swedish security police.
   Prechtel said the arrested Swedes were suspected of being part
of the same ring, which he said was based in West Germany and used
couriers from Sweden.
   Hakansson said the suspected spies had traveled several times to
West Germany.
   Prechtel, said in a telephone interview that he couldn't rule
out the possibility the charge of espionage against Conrad might be
raised to treason. The spokesman said Conrad was ``the head'' of
the ring.
   Prechtel said Conrad was from Ohio, but he could not provide the
hometown.
   The statement came after The New York Times reported today that
Swedish and West German authorities had arrested eight people
involved in a spy ring that supplied secret military documents to
the Soviets for at least 10 years.
   Prechtel, speaking from his office in the city of Karlsruhe,
confirmed virtually all of the Times report on the case.
   He confirmed that documents concerning North Atlantic Treaty
Organization defense plans for Europe were believed stolen as well
as the U.S. Army contingency plans for a ground war in Europe
against the Soviet Union.
   But he emphasized that officials were still conducting in-depth
investigations to determine exactly what was missing.
   Prechtel said that while ``several'' people had been taken into
custody or arrested, he could not confirm that the number was eight.
   The ring was based in West Germany, while couriers were based in
neutral Sweden, the spokesman also confirmed.
   Rebmann said Conrad sold secret documents to ``a Soviet bloc
secret service.''
   Conrad has been sent to investigative detention following his
appearance before a special panel of the West German Supreme Court,
Rebmann's office said.
   Rebmann's statement said that Conrad had worked for the U.S.
military for 20 years before his discharge in 1985. It said he was
born in 1947, but did not give his hometown in the United States.
   Principals in the newly uncovered ring, which operated through a
German-Hungarian connection, caused a major security loss to the
United States, according to the Times report, later confirmed by
Rebmann.
   The report said investigators believe the spy ring provided
American, West German and NATO secrets to the Hungarian
intelligence agency. The Hungarians then shared the secrets with
the Soviet Union, officials told the Times.
   The Times said the network was uncovered by West German and U.S.
officials, including agents from the FBI and the Army. The Army has
about 250,000 military personnel in West Germany at more than 200
installations.
   Rebmann's written statement said the charge against Conrad was
``compelling suspicion of espionage activities in an especially
grave case.''
   The statement said that in the seven years before his 1985
discharge, Conrad had access to military defense plans at a U.S.
base in the West German city of Bad Kreuznach.
   ``The accused is under compelling suspicion of having delivered
these documents to a Soviet Bloc secret service by means of a
command officer and couriers living abroad in return for high
payment,'' the statement said.

<HEAD>Police Promise to Investigate Wrong Arrests in Vice Sweep</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Police said Thursday they were
investigating the arrests of teen-agers wrongfully accused of
prostitution during a vice sweep.
   A senior officer was assigned to head the internal police
investigation, said Deputy Commissioner Godwin Mabika.
   Helmeted riot police and uniformed patrolmen rounded up young
women in downtown Harare this week as part of a drive against
street crime and prostitution.
   But police confirmed that vacationing schoolgirls, teen-agers
going to a movie theater and at least one foreign tourist were
caught in the sweep. They were among some 150 girls and young women
detained in communal cells at the central police station in Harare.
   Police did not say how many of the 150 were wrongly arrested.
   Press reports said many of those arrested, including one
14-year-old girl, were made to sign ``admission of guilt'' papers
and pay fines to secure their release. Teen-agers were denied
access to legal advice, the reports said.
   Zimbabwe's biggest daily, The Herald, Thursday attributed
arrests of innocent bystanders to ``bungling'' by police. It quoted
legislator Sydney Malunga as saying police sweeps violated human
rights.
   Several thousand women have been arrested in periodic police
operations against prostitution since independence in 1980.

   New wildfires ignited as hundreds of soldiers fanned out along
fire lines today, while a huge blaze threatened one of Yellowstone
National Park's most scenic areas and flames came within a mile of
a nuclear missile silo in Montana.
   In Oregon, Gov. Neil Goldschmidt declared an emergency Wednesday
night, clearing the way for deployment of the National Guard to
help fight raging fires. Crews also struggled against blazes in
Idaho, Washington and California.
   The Boise Interagency Fire Center, which coordinates
firefighting in the West and Alaska, said 66,000 fires have
blackened 3.3 million acres in drought-plagued 1988, 300,000 acres
more than in 1986, considered the region's worst year.
   ``Obviously, we've got a wild year here,'' said spokeswoman
Bernie Pineda.
   In Montana, fire broke out Wednesday afternoon a half-mile from
a Minuteman II nuclear missile site between Great Falls and
Lewistown, the Air Force said.
   The blaze more than doubled to 900 acres overnight, but Zail
Chapman, dispatcher for the Helena National Forest in Great Falls,
said, ``The missile silo is completely secure.''
   About 240 firefighters were in the area, and the fire was
expected to be contained by tonight, he said.
   Malmstrom Air Force Base at Great Falls sent military police and
firefighters to protect the silo Wednesday afternoon but withdrew
them during the night, Capt. Donald Planalp said this morning.
   ``There is really nothing above ground that's flammable,''
Planalp said.
   Firefighters in Yellowstone hoped for continued low winds to
help keep the 108,300-acre North Fork fire from moving the one mile
to an evacuated campground and hotel complex. The fire grew 10,000
acres overnight and expanded north into stands of pine, but did not
get any closer to about cabins.
   About 360 visitors were evacuated Wednesday as flames advanced
to within 1{ miles of the Canyon compound.
   ``It's a hassle,'' said visitor Pat Bentz of Prineville, Ore.
``I just hope I don't have to go through this kind of thing again.''
   The evacuation left only firefighters and reporters to contend
with the heavy smoke that obscured the sun and veiled views of the
308-foot Lower Falls and 109-foot Upper Falls.
   Ten fires involving 355,000 acres were burning in Yellowstone,
closing five other campgrounds, the Grant Village hotel area and
the south entrance.
   Firefighters at the 156,500-acre Clover-Mist fire in
northeastern Yellowstone received aid from 635 soldiers from Fort
Lewis, Wash., who took over mop-up work on the fire's east flank in
the Shoshone National Forest.
   To the south in Grand Teton National Park and the Bridger-Teton
National Forest, firefighters planned to guide a 16,000-acre fire
toward Yellowstone's southern border, where they hoped it would
join two other blazes and consume all available fuel.
   To the east, Bighorn National Forest officials hoped to contain
an 11,000-acre fire by tonight.
   In southern Montana, about 600 more firefighters headed for the
28,000-acre Storm Creek fire in the Absaroka-Beartooth Wilderness.
Management of the firefighting was handed over Wednesday to a
top-level team from Alaska.
   Commander Dave Liebersbach said the fire gained between 500 and
1,000 acres on its southern flank Wednesday and was 4 miles from
Cooke City, 3 miles closer than Tuesday.
   He said a ridge separated the fire and the tourist community
just outside Yellowstone's northeast gate. Officials said there was
a 10 percent to 20 percent chance the fire could cross the ridge
today.
   Southeast of Helena, crews neared containment of a 16-day-old
blaze that destroyed more than a dozen structures. Firefighters on
Wednesday began hand-burning the last troublesome area along fire
lines surrounding the 37,600-acre blaze. Officials predicted it
would be contained by Friday evening.
   A raging fire on the steep slopes of Hells Canyon at the
Idaho-Oregon line forced crews to move their base camp to escape
the flames. The fire mushroomed Wednesday from 1,200 acres to
2,000, making a run into a stand of timber containing 12 million
board feet of wood.
   Oregon's state forester, James E. Brown, requested National
Guard aircraft to help map the fires.
   No ground troops were immediately called out in the governor's
emergency order, which applied only to southwest Oregon.
   A fire at Ward Canyon in northeastern Oregon grew to 2,000 acres
today, forcing 220 firefighters to abandon the fight and consider
moving their threatened camp.
   About 200 firefighters also battled a 1,000-acre fire in Crater
Lake National Park and adjacent land.
   A blaze at Walker Mountain northeast of Grants Pass burned 650
acres by late Wednesday, and authorities drew up contingency
evacuation plans for residents.
   Lightning storms Tuesday peppered southwestern Oregon, starting
at least 60 fires.
   In Washington state, winds whipped a fire seven miles northwest
of Morton from 50 to 250 acres overnight, while more than
firefighters worked to contain a nearby 500-acre blaze.
   Near Cloverdale, Calif., about 65 miles north of San Francisco,
a grass fire set off by a welder's torch burned a barn and charred
some 2,000 acres in steep terrain. The fire was advancing toward a
nearby subdivision.

   Federal investigators with warrants
searched the state Capitol offices of a half dozen members of the
California Legislature and their aides, the FBI announced today.
   The FBI refused to reveal the names of the lawmakers or even the
subject of the investigation, but a Capitol source, who declined to
be identified, said all of the objects of the search warrants were
involved in the passage of a bill involving investment banking
regulations.
   The searches late Wednesday were part of an ongoing
investigation, said Terry Knowles, special agent in charge of the
Sacramento FBI office.
   A Capitol employee said a team of about 30 federal investigators
from the FBI and U.S. Attorney's office served search warrants on
the offices of at least one state senator and two members of the
Assembly _ all from Southern California.
   The source said the subject of the warrants was a bill
regulating commercial banks which passed the Legislature with only
minimal opposition earlier this year and was vetoed by the governor.

   The City Council deadlocked along racial
lines on whether to certify the election of Mayor Joe Smitherman to
a seventh term, with his black challenger claiming the mayor was a
``dictator'' who had stolen the election.
   Two people were charged with disorderly conduct Wednesday in
this town of 27,000 people that is a landmark of the civil rights
movement, after the council split 3-3 on whether to accept
Tuesday's vote.
   Smitherman's main challenger, City Councilman Cleophus Mann, who
is seeking to become Selma's first black mayor, said one precinct
did not open on time Tuesday and that there were other
irregularities.
   ``You stole it!'' Mann shouted at the meeting.
   ``We might as well have been in Panama,'' he said. ``We sit
around and let a dictator run things.''
   Returns showed Smitherman receiving 3,752 votes in Tuesday's
three-way, non-partisan election. Mann received 2,769 votes; Coy
Darby, a white challenger, received 453 votes.
   If the results are upheld, Smitherman would not face a runoff
election, because he received more than 50 percent of the vote.
   After the meeting, Mann nearly came to blows with city attorney
Henry Pitts, and one campaign aide and another man were arrested on
charges of disorderly conduct.
   A second council meeting, Wednesday afternoon, was boycotted by
the council's three black members. Without a quorum, no action
could be taken.
   ``This is one of the worst incidents I've seen since 1964,''
Smitherman said, referring to the year he first took office as
mayor and the year when voting rights demonstrations first brought
national attention to the city.
   ``That's the old civil rights crowd, and they're trying to
rehash the '60s,'' Smitherman said. ``This is not a representative
of the black citizens of Selma. That was a bunch of disruptive
goons and they got what they came for.''
   On March 7, 1965, several hundred civil rights activists began a
50-mile voting rights march to Montgomery. State troopers and
sheriff's deputies, acting under orders from Gov. George Wallace,
beat marchers as they tried to cross the Edmund Pettus Bridge.
   Television film of the beatings shocked the nation. Two weeks
later, a second, much larger march left Selma with the support of
the federal government.
   The clash also was credited with spurring Congress to pass the
Voting Rights Act, which removed the poll tax and other legal
barriers that had discouraged black voter registration.
   Smitherman said he planned to file a lawsuit to certify the
election results.
   Arrested after Wednesday's council clash were the Rev. Ernest
Swift Sr., 42, one of Mann's campaign workers; and Byron Douglas
Smith, 21. Pitts said both men shouted at him and threatened him.
   Swift was arrested a second time when, released from jail, he
returned to City Hall and shouted at the mayor that he was ``still
a crook because you had people crooked at the polls.''
   Later, a policeman was stationed in front of Smitherman's office
and extra patrols were scheduled for his home.

   Muhammad Ali, the boxer who
dubbed himself ``the greatest,'' is receiving blood-cleansing
treatments from a doctor he calls the greatest in the world.
   The 46-year-old former heavyweight champion walked into a
hospital waiting room Wednesday throwing jabs in the air minutes
after undergoing an eight-hour blood treatment to relieve slurred
speech and tremors that have plagued him in recent years.
   The doctor blames Ali's condition on household pesticide
poisoning and not blows to the head.
   ``I feel like I can fight (heavyweight champ Mike) Tyson,'' Ali
said in a hoarse voice slightly above a whisper at Hilton Head
Hospital.
   Ali referred questions to his physician, Rajko Medenica, an
immunologist who specializes in cancer and blood disorders.
   Ali underwent plasmapheresis, during which his plasma was
removed and replaced with an artificial product prepared by
Medenica. Plasma is the fluid in which other components of the
blood circulate in the body.
   Although Ali has been diagnosed as having parkinsonian syndrome,
possibly brought on by blows to the head during his boxing career,
Medenica disagrees.
   Calling it ``The Muhammad Ali Syndrome,'' he blamed household
pesticide poisoning, which probably affected him so severely
because of his rapid metabolism when he was in peak physical
condition.
   Ali likely will return for treatments every three months or so,
Medenica said.
   ``My goal is to remove the circulating toxins. By the end of the
year, he should be much better,'' he said.
   Although Ali had trouble speaking, he moved with ease and
appeared to be in good spirits. Ali called Medenica the greatest

   American soprano Maria Ewing, who won rave reviews
when she danced naked as Salome in her debut at London's Royal
Opera House in April, is seeking a divorce from husband Sir Peter
Hall, artistic director of Britain's National Theater.
   Her lawyer Anthony Rubenstein said Wednesday that the
38-year-old Detroit-born singer will file a petition for divorce
from 57-year-old Hall as soon as possible.
   The couple married in 1982 and have a 6-year-old daughter.
   Hall, who plans to launch his own production company in
September when his contract expires, has headed the prestigious
state-funded National Theater since 1973. He made no comment on the
divorce.

   French philosopher Jean Guitton accepted
the Fiuggi-Meeting 1988 award, which recognizes those who
``distinguish themselves in defending the cultural and religious
values of man.''
   Guitton, 87, a member of the French Academy since 1961, has
written about the relationship between Catholicism and modern
thought.
   The award, a plaque and $21,645, was given Thursday by Foreign
Minister Giulio Andreotti, who called Guitton ``one of the great
figures of European culture and contemporary Catholicism.''
   Addressing youths in the audience, Guitton said they have the
duty to ``help humanity and the church to continue to live and not
just survive. Maybe the 21st century, thanks to you, will be an
even more enlightening century.''

   Gov. Mario Cuomo has agreed to testify in a case
involving his former law firm.
   After almost nine years of postponements and delays, lawyers
this month subpoenaed Cuomo to appear in court with his financial
records.
   ``We were willing to object to the method by which these
subpoenas were served,'' Cuomo's lawyer, Peter J. Johnson Jr., told
state Supreme Court Justice Carmine Ventiera, according to New York
Newsday.
   ``He (Cuomo) almost blew me out of the water when he said,
`Forget about it. I can't wait to testify. I want the truth to be
told,''' Johnson said Wednesday.
   The dispute involves nearly $6 million in legal fees.
   Cuomo is suing his former law partner, Michael Nicholson, and
Nicholson's wife and current partner, Diane, for a share of the
fees earned by the law firm after he left in 1975.
   The estate of Peter E. Dwyer, a late partner in the firm, also
is suing the Nicholsons for a share of the fees.
   The Nicholsons have in turn sued Cuomo, claiming he accepted a
$100,000 liquidation fee when he resigned in 1975.
   Cuomo contends the Nicholsons deliberately underestimated the
firm's assets at the time the liquidation fee was assessed.

   Distance runner Zola Budd, who
dropped out of international racing in May, says she's engaged to
marry a liquor store owner in her hometown.
   Budd told the independent South African Press Association on
Thursday that the engagement ``happened very suddenly yesterday.''
   Her fiance, Mike Pieterse, 26, who said he had known Budd for
about two years, told the the government-run South African
Broadcasting Corp. that the couple had not set a wedding date.
   Since her return to South Africa in May from Britain, Budd has
been a student at the University of the Orange Free State in her
hometown, Bloemfontein.
   Budd, 21, moved to Britain in 1984 and received a British
passport within weeks, allowing her to compete in the Olympic Games
in Los Angeles that year.
   South Africa is banned from most international sports because of
its apartheid policies of racial segregation. Anti-apartheid groups
have staged demonstrations virtually everywhere Budd raced in the
last four years.

   Members of the anti-apartheid
Progressive Federal Party walked out of Parliament on Thursday to
protest a government manuever aimed at pushing through
controversial legislation.
   One of the bills would strengthen enforcement of the Group Areas
Act, which mandates racially segregated residential areas. Another
would give authorities more powers to evict black squatters.
   President P.W. Botha's National Party holds an overwhelming
majority in Parliament's white chamber and is able to gain support
for most legislation from the majority parties in the two smaller
chambers, one for Asians and one for people of mixed-race.
   The two non-white chambers, however, have refused to consider
the current bills, insisting instead on total repeal of the Group
Areas Act.
   The black majority is excluded from Parliament and has no vote
in national affairs.
   The leader of the white chamber, F.W. de Klerk, announced
Thursday that parliamentary rules would be suspended so the six
pending bills could be dealt with solely by the white legislators.
   Progressive Federal members said the rule change made a farce of
the parliamentary process.
   ``You are doing it to pass laws which are repugnant to the vast
majority of people in South Africa,'' said the party's whip, John
Malcomness. ``If you put them to a referendum of all the people of
South Africa, they will be massively rejected.''
   The far-right Conservative Party, which favors a strengthening
of apartheid laws, joined the Progressive Federal Party in
condemning the rule change, which was approved on a 116-35 vote.
   Last week, Botha said 80 percent of South Africa's whites and 70
percent of Asian and mixed-race voters would endorse residential
segregation in a referendum. The Rev. Allan Hendrickse, leader of
the mixed-race chamber, has dared Botha to arrange such an election.
   The proposed amendment to the Group Areas Act would sharply
increase penalties for violators and would negate a current court
ruling that violators could be evicted only if alternative housing
were available.
   Information Minister Stoffel van der Merwe said the act was
virtually unenforceable at present and needed amendment ``to give
people a sense of security.''
   In the United States, he said, wealthy people could buy their
way into neighborhoods with de facto segregation.
   ``We only want to create the same option for people in South
Africa,'' he said, noting that the government has proposed allowing
some multiracial neighborhoods for people who desire them.

<HEAD>City Council Votes to Let Police Arrest People Who Look Like Drug
Dealers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The City Council has voted to let police arrest
and search people who look or act like drug dealers _ regardless of
whether the people are seen making drug deals.
   The ordinance, approved Wednesday, also says such loiterers may
be fined $500 if they are known drug dealers or pass money,
packages or written material to passers-by in an area known for
drug sales.
   Civil libertarians questioned the ordinance, which says someone
may be arrested who ``loiters in a public place in a manner and
under circumstances manifesting the purpose of selling any illegal
controlled substance ...''
   A known drug dealer is defined as someone who has been convicted
of drug charges within the last year.
   Councilman Al Gonzalez said he proposed the ordinance at the
request of Lou Caudell, first assistant police chief.
   ``This allows uniformed police officers to get actively involved
in the war on drugs,'' said police Lt. Doug Kowalski.
   But Joe Cook, president of the Dallas chapter of the American
Civil Liberties Union, said he expected the group to challenge the
ordinance because it treads on due process and civil rights.
   Cook said such an ordinance could be used to harass political
activities and could increase tension between police and the city's
minority communities.
   Councilwoman Diane Ragsdale initially cast the only vote in
opposition to the ordinance, saying she feared the rights of
innocent people could be trampled.
   But she later reversed her vote, saying she would seek
assurances from Police Chief Mack Vines that the ordinance would
not be abused.

   The foreign ministers of Iran and Iraq today held
the first direct peace talks between their countries since the
Persian Gulf war began eight years ago. The talks were mediated by
the head of the United Nations.
   Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati and his Iraqi
counterpart, Tariq Aziz, sat at separate tables facing each other
across a spacious room. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar
faced them from a third table.
   The meeting was suspended after 2{ hours, U.N. spokesman
Francois Giuliani told reporters. Afterward, the Iranian and Iraqi
delegations moved to separate rooms and U.N. officials shuttled
between the two groups and reported to the secretary-general, who
remained in the room where the direct talks were held.
   ``They are consulting,'' Giuliani told reporters. ``It is not a
bad sign, nor a good sign, it's a normal process of consultation,''
he said when asked by reporters if there was a problem with the
talks. ``Please don't interpret this as a sign that things are
going well, or badly. They are going normally.''
   Earlier Giuliani told reporters the talks would continue through
Sunday.
   Western diplomatic sources, meanwhile, said the
secretary-general was considering naming a three-man panel to
determine which side started the war. The sources, speaking on
condition of anonymity, said one representative could be from Iran,
one from Iraq and one from the International Court of Justice.
   The direct talks were held in the Art Deco-style Council Chamber
of the Palais de Nations. The two foreign ministers and their aides
entered separately from the right and left sides. The ministers did
not exchange greetings.
   Reporters were present briefly and watched the beginning of the
session on closed-circuit television. As reporters left, Aziz
lighted a cigar.
   ``Your excellencies, I warmly welcome you,'' Perez de Cuellar
said in English as he led the meeting. The Iraqi delegation of 15
was seated to his left and the Iranian delegation of 13 was to his
right in a triangular set-up of long, widely separated tables.
   The U.N. chief said he hoped ``our discussions would be
businesslike, constructive and, indeed, productive.''
   The Council Chamber overlooks Lake Geneva and is decorated with
gold leaf and sepia ink murals of human progress and abolition of
war.
   The peace process was expected to be long and troublesome. The
issues are numerous _ from disputed border locations to prisoners
of war _ and the bitterness between the Persian and the Arab sides
runs deep.
   Since a U.N.-supervised cease-fire began six days ago, both
sides have traded charges of truce violations and questioned their
adversary's sincerity and will for peace. But no serious fighting
has been reported.
   Earlier today, Aziz and Velayati met separately with Perez de
Cuellar. Both ministers were accompanied by their delegations and
ignored questions shouted at them from about 100 reporters pressing
against crowd control barriers in the main entrance of the building.
   Perez de Cuellar said he expects direct talks between Iraq and
Iran to last months, but some diplomats believe the peace process
could drag on for years.
   Arriving in Geneva today, Velayati said the talks should
``arrive at a just, comprehensive, honorable and durable settlement
of all outstanding issues between Iran and Iraq.''
   Iran accepted the U.N. cease-fire resolution July 18 after a
string of battlefield defeats. Iraq had agreed to the resolution
shortly after the Security Council passed it in July 1987.
   The agenda for the Iran-Iraq talks could include troop
withdrawal to international borders, resolution of a border
dispute, repatriation of prisoners of war, reparations, freedom of
navigation in the disputed Shatt al-Arab waterway and the gulf and
other issues.
   Iran also is insisting on the creation of an impartial body to
determine which side started the war. It has said that Iraq must be
branded the aggressor if there is to be lasting peace.
   Iraq invaded Iran in September 1980 after border skirmishes.
   Any ruling on guilt in the war would affect the question of
reparations. Official Iranian assessments have put the cost of war
damage at $350 billion. Iraq has not given an estimate.

   Defense contractor TRW Inc. pleaded guilty
today to fraudulently overcharging the government up to $11 million
for military aircraft and M-1 tank parts and agreed to pay $3
million in fines.
   TRW ``deeply regrets that the events occurred'' and has created
programs approved by the Defense Department to prevent them from
happening again, said TRW Vice President William Lawrence.
   Lawrence, who entered the plea on three counts on behalf of the
company, said TRW has paid a separate $3 million to be applied as
an advance payment on restitution to the Defense Department. The
amount of restitution TRW owes is to be decided in a pending civil
case.
   The company estimated that it inflated costs by $3 million to
$11 million; government officials have declined to comment on those
figures.
   TRW also paid a combined criminal fine and penalty of $3
million, one of the largest ever assessed against a defense
contractor for procurement fraud, said U.S. Attorney Patrick M.
McLaughlin in Cleveland.
   In connection with the case, two former TRW employees have
pleaded guilty to defrauding the government, and one former
employee faces trial Sept. 6, the government said.
   TRW was charged with conspiring between 1973 and 1984 to falsely
inflate labor expenses for the manufacture of aircraft engine
parts. A conspiracy to inflate labor costs on compressor fan blades
for the M-1 tank took place between 1980 and 1984, McLaughlin said.
   The third count charges that TRW conspired to charge the Defense
Department for operations and labor that were not performed in
connection with the manufacture of blades for the J-79 aircraft
engine.
   ``The three counts ... detail a long-standing course of conduct
by TRW employees to alter, backdate and destroy documents to
conceal the falsely inflated labor costs,'' the government said in
a news release.
   The guilty pleas conclude a federal grand jury investigation
that began in 1984, when TRW voluntarily disclosed that its
employees had engaged in questionable conduct, McLaughlin said.

   Rival pizza suppliers are fighting, and the
result is that school cafeterias will do without for at least five
weeks, officials said.
   ``It's going to cause a riot,'' Leonard Smackum, director of
food service for the Baltimore school system warned the Board of
Estimates on Wednesday. ``Pizza is our most popular item.''
   The board voted to toss out bids on 760,000 slices of cheese
pizza and re-advertise the contract after spending nearly an hour
listening to two vendors argue over whose bid was lower.
   On a 3-1 vote, the board decided the bidding process made it
difficult to determine which of the two bids, $219,000 or $229,000,
was actually the lowest.
   The dispute arose when Nardone Brothers Baking Co. of
Pennsylvania said it would add two-tenths of an ounce of cheese on
each slice beyond the 2 ounces required by the contract, thus
providing tastier pizza.
   The extra cheese would be free to the city as long as the
federal government continued to provide free cheese through a
surplus program, said a spokesman for Nardone.
   But the rival supplier said the federal program could end this
year, raising the cost of the pizza.
   The start of the school year may be saved for pupils, however.
   The Board of Estimates approved contracts with suppliers of
Mexican-style pizza and French-bread pizza.

<TEXT>
   U.N. military observers scrambled on
Thursday to assemble the Iran-Iraq cease-fire despite
communications snags, suspicious hosts and uncertainty about the
location of minefields.
   All of the 350 observers, drawn from 24 countries, were in place
by Thursday, U.N. spokesman Saleem Fahmawi said. Communications
personnel were expected to establish a radio network ``very soon,''
he said.
   Fahmawi said that since the cease-fire took effect Aug. 20,
there have been ``just minor incidents which have been fully
resolved.''
   But diplomats and other sources said that mixups over
transportation, passports, communications and protocol meant that
some observers were not in place on Aug. 20.
   Those who were frequently found themselves with inadequate
communications, poor maps and uncertainty about where the
minefields were as they patrolled in temperatures often exceeding
110 degrees.
   Diplomats and U.N. officials said they rapidly are overcoming
the snags the hastily assembled force, sent to countries unfamiliar
with U.N. procedures, had been expected to face.
   ``They're no more than the growing pains of a new mission in two
countries which have absolutely no experience with this type of
thing,'' said Col. John Annand, the Canadian deputy commander of
the U.N. Iran-Iraq Military Observer Group.
   Iran and Iraq, both deeply suspicious of outsiders and
distrustful of each other, found hundreds of foreign soldiers, some
armed, landing at their airports with their own communications
equipment.
   U.S. C-5A Galaxy transport planes ferried Canadian
communications troops to NATO's Incirlik base in Turkey. The jets
flew on to Iraq, but shipments to Iran were transferred to Canadian
C-130 transports.
   The delays caused by the transfers were compounded when Iran
initially demanded 48 hours' notice and a complete list of men and
equipment on each flight, diplomats said.
   Iran also objected to the assault rifles carried by U.N. support
troops.
   Although U.N. troops normally need no passports, diplomats said
Tehran demanded them, forcing consular officials to scramble to
issue hundreds of new documents.
   As a result, diplomats said, operations in Iran have been about
two days behind those in Iraq, forcing the delay of some operations
in Iraq.
   Efforts to set up a U.N. communications network were complicated
by confusion over frequencies. Iraq approved one set, Iran another.
Now officials are trying to get them to agree on a single set so
observers on both sides can talk to each other.
   Diplomats and U.N. personnel said they rely heavily on the host
armies to help out during the initial cease-fire stages.
   Observers in the central sector said they sleep and eat in Iraqi
officers' quarters and depend on Iraqi guides and translators. They
said cooperation was good.
   Observers are using hand-held UHF radios to report to command
centers. These relay the messages by telephone to sector
headquarters, which use Iraqi army lines to reach the central
headquarters in Baghdad.
   Within a few days, diplomats said, the communications teams
should have a U.N. network carrying communications from the front
to U.N. headquarters in New York.
   The observer teams have little idea where the border is. One of
their main tasks is to make sure that both armies withdraw to the
pre-war frontier.
   That's likely to be most difficult in the north, where the
Iranians have long infiltrated into the Kurdistan mountains to
fight alongside Tehran-backed Kurdish guerrillas. The Iraqis are
still battling the rebels in the region.
   The 730-mile border has been in dispute for decades and will
have to be ironed out in the peace talks in Geneva.
   The Iranians consider the southern border to be the median line
of the Shatt Al-Arab waterway under a 1975 agreement.
   But President Saddam Hussein of Iraq tore up that treaty days
before the war erupted in September 1980 and is likely to claim
sovereignty over the whole waterway, Iraq's only outlet to the
Persian Gulf.
   With only 350 men, the observers cannot spot every incident. But
they will check reports of violations and significant troop
movements along the front, which ranges from rugged mountains in
the north through ravine-cut hills in the center to marshes and
desert in the south.
   ``Mines are the biggest problem,'' said Capt. Arne Ophus, a
Norwegian observer. ``We have to be careful.''
   The guides who accompany the observers in their air-conditioned
land cruisers don't know where all the minefields are because many
were planted by Iranians.

   Forget the radio weatherman: A new

   The Portland Weather Machine comes to life at noon.
   It sprays water, blinks lights, plays a trumpet fanfare and
releases one of three weather symbols from a steel globe _ a
gold-leaf sun for clear days, a silvery blue heron for
precipitation, and a roaring copper dragon for a storm.
   The 30-foot sculpture also includes a weathervane for wind
direction and a series of lights that indicate the temperature. To
show air quality, a lens glows green on clear days, amber on hazy
days and red on smoggy ones.
   Some 500 people attended the sculpture's unveiling Wednesday by
another famous weather performer, Willard Scott of NBC's ``Today

   ``The Weather Machine will help us recognize and celebrate the

been in the works for nearly five years, was designed by four local

   ``It was just a silly idea to see if anyone would find it,'' Ms.
Neilsen said. ``Can you believe it only took three days for the
bottle to float up here? I actually threw two bottles overboard,
and the second one washed up in almost the same place. We got a

<TEXT>
   Hyatt Hotels Corp. on Thursday announced that
it had dropped its ban on cornrow hairstyles and initiated a
program to encourage more minorities to enter the hotel and resort
management industry.
   The changes stem from complaints by several Hyatt employees
across the country, including one in Washington, that prohibiting
the tightly braided hairstyle discriminated against blacks, who
consider cornrows part of their ethnic heritage.
   Officials of the District of Columbia Human Rights Office said
at a news conference with Hyatt executives that because of the
policy change it has decided not file a complaint against the chain.
   ``They (Hyatt officials) exhibited a spirit of cooperation like
no other we've seen,'' said Maudine Cooper, director of the office.
``There were policies against cornrows, but Hyatt has since
eliminated that policy.''
   Hyatt said that as part of the settlement with the city, it was
creating a nationwide college scholarship program designed to
attract minorities to hotel and resort management.
   Under the plan, selected students at 20 historically black
colleges and universities who have completed their sophomore or
junior years will have the opportunity to participate in a 10-week
paid summer training plan.
   ``We hope to give students a realistic understanding of the
hotel business, and to allow for student development through
responsible and accountable assignments,'' said Tom Perry, an
assistant vice president for personnel with Hyatt. ``Students who
perform to expectation will be extended an offer to join Hyatt as a
management trainee upon graduation.''
   Just 2.4 percent of the 10,000 students enrolled last year in
college hotel management programs were black, Perry noted.
   The district government could have fined Hyatt if Cooper's
office had found evidence of discrimination.
   The settlement does not affect complaints already filed by Hyatt
employees over the hotel chain's former ban on cornrows, Cooper
said. Jimmy Lee Solomon Jr., a Hyatt attorney, said four complaints
are pending nationwide.
   Solomon would not discuss details of any of the cases, but he
said the hotel had made some ``generous'' settlement offers.

<HEAD>Burma Frees Top Dissident, 1,700 Others; Thousands March For
Democracy</HEAD>

   Authorities on Thursday released Burma's
top dissident and nearly 1,700 anti-government protesters, and
hundreds of thousands more rallied to demand immediate democracy,
rejecting the president's proposal to consider multiparty rule.
   Dissident Aung Gyi left Insein Jail, quickly organized a rally
of about 200,000 people, and demanded an interim government be
formed to lead the nation to democracy.
   On Wednesday, President Maung Maung bowed to three days of mass
protests against one-party rule and called for a referendum on
multiparty democracy. The leader _ the nation's third in five weeks
_ lifted martial law imposed Aug. 3 in Rangoon, withdrew troops
from the city center and lifted curfews throughout the country.
   But to the people in the streets Thursday, the moves clearly
were insufficient.
   About 400,000 people marched through the streets of the capital
demanding the government give the people democracy immediately,
witnesses said. Diplomats earlier said up to 1 million people
marched in the city Wednesday.
   Anti-government demonstrators controlled Victoria Point, the
southernmost town in Burma, and student leaders claimed similar
takeovers were occurring throughout the country.
   About 300 workers, merchants and students marched through
Victoria Point, and one student said Maung Maung's promise of
democracy was ``a political trick.''
   Aung Gyi addressed a hastily arranged rally at Padonma Ground,
where public stage shows are held. It is near his home in the
Sanchaung area of the capital.
   ``We have complete trust in President Maung Maung and Chairman
of the Council of People's Justices Tin Aung Hein,'' he said. Both
men are civilians in the military-dominated government.
   But Aung Gyi added: ``I demand Maung Maung and Tin Aung Hein
form an interim government immediately to avoid anarchy and
bloodshed in the country.''
   ``We agree!'' the crowd shouted.
   Aung Gyi, a former army brigadier, was a close associate of
former strongman Ne Win, but they split over differences in
economic policy.
   Ne Win led the 1962 coup that toppled the elected government. He
began one-party rule and imposed rigid socialist and isolationist
policies that turned one of Southeast Asia's wealthiest nations
into one of its poorest.
   When Ne Win, 77, resigned last month as chairman of the 1.1
million-member party he cited his age and took indirect
responsibility for violent riots in March and June.
   He said the rioting ``showed the lack of trust and confidence in
the government'' and called for a referendum on multiparty rule.
   Sein Lwin, a former army general widely hated for crushing
dissent, succeeded Ne Win on July 27 and moved quickly against his
opposition. He resigned Aug. 12 after at leat 112 people were
killed when troops fired into crowds of anti-government
demonstrators.
   Aung Gyi, 70, recently wrote a series of letters decrying
economic and political decay under the ruling Burma Socialist
Program Party, and specifically mentioned Sein Lwin.
   Aung Gyi, this reporter and eight others were arrested on July
29-30.
   Sein Lwin was succeeded Aug. 19 by Maung Maung, who had been
attorney general.
   After his detention, Aung Gyi's name became a rallying cry of
some of the hundreds of thousands of people who took to the streets
to condemn Sein Lwin, and later, to demand that Maung Maung move
toward multiparty democracy.
   Earlier Thursday, heading home from Insein Jail, people shouted
for democracy without any official hindrance for the first time in
26 years.
   The atmosphere was festive. The sea of people and horn-honking
vehicles and the absence of police and soldiers snarled traffic in
the city center and made movement difficult.
   Many people wore red headbands, and the national flag was flying
upside down, both symbols of defiance.
   Government ministries were open but nearly empty, with no senior
officials at their desks and the few junior employees on hand doing
little work. Some local government offices were deserted after they
had been ransacked by mobs.
   Banners on buildings and vehicles, including some government
cars, called for peaceful protest to bring about an immediate end
to one-party rule.
   No newspapers were available because workers at all six
state-run dailies struck Wednesday to demand democracy and press
freedom.
   State-run Radio Rangoon said 1,683 protesters were released
Thursday from Insein Jail. It said all others arrested nationwide
since Aug. 3 in connection with the rioting would be freed except
those accused of serious crimes.
   Those freed Thursday included 442 students, 78 government
employees and 27 Buddhist monks. The release brought to more than
2,500 the number of people freed, but it was not known how many
remain in jail.
   Maung Maung said Wednesday he would ask the party at an
emergency congress soon to consider a referendum on multiparty
rule, which could lead to general elections. Radio Rangoon said the
meeting would be Sept. 12.
   He said if the party refuses he and the 13 other members of the
Central Executive Committee would resign from the party.
   In another development Thursday, Gen. Bo Mya, head of one of
Burma's most powerful rebel groups, the Karens, said a democratic
government in Rangoon would be only a first step towards ending the
40-year-old civil war.
   He said in Bangkok, Thailand, that his 17,000 guerrillas and
other rebel groups were ordered to step up attacks against the
government.

   Court officials on Thursday postponed a
decision on whether to dismiss weapons charges against syndicated
columnist Carl T. Rowan, who has been accused of using an
unregistered handgun to wound a teen-age trespasser at his home.
   A District of Columbia Superior Court hearing commissioner, Roy
T. Ellis, agreed to put off until Sept. 12 a hearing on dismissing
charges, to give prosecutors time to study the matter. City
attorneys said they would file papers within a week opposing
Rowan's request that the charges be dropped.
   Rowan's attorney, Raoul L. Carroll, asked last week that the
charges be dismissed, saying he had evidence that Rowan and his
son, Carl Jr., had been told they didn't have to register the
weapon used in the June 14 shooting.
   The columnist, who has written in favor of gun control, has been
charged with one count each of possessing an unregistered gun and
carrying ammunition for it. Each misdemeanor charge carries a
possible penalty of one year in prison and a $1,000 fine.
   A local ordnance enacted in 1976 requires that all handguns be
registered.
   But Rowan and his son, a former FBI agent who owned the
.22-caliber pistol, contend they had been told the weapon did not
need to be registered because law enforcement personnel were exempt.
   That statement was supported by a memo written Aug. 11 from city
Corporation Counsel Frederick D. Cooke to Police Chief Maurice T.
Turner indicating that some police officers have erred in enforcing
the gun registration law.
   ``It has come to my attention that some officers in the MPD
(Metropolitan Police Department) have interpreted the provision so
as to exempt from registration firearms owned by MPD officers or
other law enforcement officers,'' Cooke wrote Turner.
   ``I understand further that when an officer ceases to be an MPD
or other law enforcement officer this `exempt' status is not
revoked and the former officer is not required to surrender the
weapon,'' Cooke continued.
   ``I do not agree with (the) premise that law enforcement
officers are exempt from registration of any non-department weapons
they may own.''
   The law should be amended to make clear that law enforcement
officers are not exempt from the city's stringent handgun law,
Cooke added.
   Carroll, who submitted the memo in his dismissal motion, said it
substantiates the claims of innocence his client has already made.
   Beverly Burke, a spokeswoman for the corporation counsel,
refused to comment on the memo, and refused to outline how the city
will counter Rowan's request.

<TEXT>
   New Jersey's system of paying for public
education is unconstitutional and discriminates against poor urban
districts, an administrative law judge ruled Thursday.
   ``There are unmet educational needs in poor, urban districts and
vast program and expenditure disparities between property-rich
suburban and property-poor urban school districts,'' Judge Steven
L. Lefelt said.
   The ruling comes after nearly two decades of legal and
legislative battles, and once again throws into question the way
the state funds public schools. It could force the state to spend
millions of dollars more each year on education.
   ``I do not believe that poor urban districts, even with better
management practices and the expulsion of politics, could raise
sufficient funds ... to address all of the disparities and unmet
needs that I believe must be addressed under our constitution,''
Lefelt said.
   His ruling capped a seven-year legal battle over a lawsuit
brought on behalf of 20 school-age children in Camden, Irvington,
East Orange and Jersey City.
   The suit charged that the state funding system leaves poorer
districts with far less money than their surburban counterparts and
creates disparities in the quality of education.
   Education Commissioner Saul Cooperman has 45 days in which to
accept, modify or reject Lefelt's ruling.
   Lawyers for the state and the group that filed the suit, the
Newark-based Education Law Center, predict the case eventually will
go to the state Supreme Court.
   Although Lefelt's ruling is a major victory for the law group,
the judge did not agree with the group's contention that New
Jersey's funding system is intentionally discriminatory. Instead,
he said, it is ``motivated by cost efficiency and not race.''
   Lefelt said the Legislature must revamp the system so poor
districts receive more money to improve schools.
   His decision came more than 15 years after the Supreme Court
first ruled that New Jersey's former system of funding education,
with its heavy reliance on property taxes, discriminated against
poorer districts.
   The Legislature then enacted a school funding formula, and
passed a state income tax in 1976 to pay for it.

   The State Department on Thursday praised the
lifting of restrictions on civil rights in Chile and expressed hope
that the action will lead to additional steps that will allow ``the
full and free expression of popular will.''
   The move Wednesday by Chile's military leaders was the first
time since they took power in 1973 that the state of emergency had
been lifted.
   The announcement came less than a week before the expected
selection by the country's four-man junta of President Augusto
Pinochet as the sole candidate in a presidential referendum later
this year.
   Successive U.S. administrations have been hostile to Pinochet's
rule, and Thursday's statement by State Department spokeswoman
Phyllis Oakley was one of the few positive comments about Chile's
leadership in 15 years.
   ``The U.S. government has stated on repeated occasions that the
continuation of states of exception which limits basic civil rights
is incompatible with democratic electoral processes,'' Mrs. Oakley
said.
   She said the termination of the ``states of exception'' is a
``positive step which we applaud.''
   ``We firmly hope that this decision by the Chilean government
signals a lasting guarantee of the civil rights of the Chilean
poeple,'' she added. ``We also hope that by ending the states of
exception, the Chilean government is indicating a sincere desire to
take further steps to allow the full and free expression of popular
will.''

   The parents of a Peace Corps worker
learned Thursday that their son, a volunteer in Nepal, was safe
following an earthquake last weekend that killed at least 750
people in that country and neighboring India.
   ``They called this morning, that's the first we had heard about
anything since the quake,'' said Arthur Giaquinta, whose
24-year-old son, Peter, lives in a village 10 miles north of the
hard-hit Dharan Bazar township.
   Jim Flanigan, a Peace Corps spokesman in Washington, said Peter
Giaquinta was ``fine as far as we know.''
   In Boston, the brother of Peace Corps volunteer Bettyjean
Bouffard, 27, said Thursday she called her relatives to say she was
safe. The call, said Dave Bouffard, was the first news the family
had had of her safety.
   ``We're ecstatic,'' he said, adding that his sister had been
living with a Nepalese family five miles from the earthquake
epicenter.
   Flanigan said the Peace Corps has been able to track down all
but three of the 157 volunteers in Nepal. There are no Peace Corps
members in India, he said.
   The three, he said, are from Michigan, Wisconsin and the
Philadelphia area; he declined to release their names.
   ``We have a problem with roads out, monsoon rains,'' Flanigan
said. ``In the best of times, reaching some of these volunteers is
several days.''

   Most of a day-old 168,000-gallon gasoline
and diesel fuel spill in Chesapeake Bay dissipated by midday
Thursday and a 2-square-mile slick was fading quickly, a Coast
Guard official said.
   The crippled barge from which the fuel leaked was loading its
remaining 651,000 gallons into another vessel, an operation that
was expected to be completed late Thursday night, said Cmdr. George
Naccara, executive officer of the Coast Guard's Marine Safety
office in Hampton Roads.
   The 168,000 gallons leaked from two ruptured tanks Wednesday,
leaving an 18-square-mile slick near the western shore of the lower
bay. However, Naccara said most of the fuel already had dissipated
by midday Thursday.
   ``We completed a helicopter fly-over of the entire bay, and
there's absolutely nothing to be seen,'' Naccara said Thursday
afternoon.
   Although a 2-square-mile ``rainbow sheen'' remained on nearby
Fleets Bay, he said, that was rapidly disppearing.
   Naccara said state officials planned to meet Thursday with a
representative of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration to discuss the impact of the spill.
   The 240-foot, 37-year-old barge was being towed from Baltimore
to Richmond by the tug Oceola when the leak was reported about 7:30
a.m. Wednesday.
   The barge ran aground in about 12 feet of water as it headed for
a Kilmarnock pier, Naccara said. The barge was surrounded with a
containment boom to halt the spread of fuel.
   The barge is owned by Eastern Carriers Inc. of Hockessin, Del.
Naccara said the company sent a second barge to help offload the
fuel Thursday morning.

<TEXT>
   Panamanian Ambassador Juan B. Sosa, a leader
of forces opposed to Panama's military leader Manuel Antonio
Noriega, said Thursday a combination of factors has led to a
``dramatic deterioration'' of Noriega's public support.
   ``Noriega's government is weaker by the day. The regime is
fighting for its survival,'' Sosa told a news conference he called
six months to the day after Panama's upheaval began with the failed
attempt to oust Noriega as commander of Panama's Defense Forces.
   Sosa continues to serve as Panama's ambassador to the United
States, sharing the U.S. position that President Eric Arturo
Delvalle is the legitimate authority in Panama. Delvalle was ousted
the day after his abortive attempt to fire Noriega.
   Sosa, who retains control over Panama's embassy despite the
Noriega government's attempt to replace him, said public opposition
to Noriega was evident earlier this month when hundreds of
thousands of Panamanians turned out for the funeral of former
President Arnulfo Arias.
   As a further sign of what he called ``the dramatic deterioration
of the regime,'' Sosa said there has been a wave of strikes
recently, widespread anti-government demonstrations by high school
students and loss of diplomatic support in Latin America.
   Noriega has responded by imposing strict curbs on independent
news media, Sosa said.
   ``We do not think that we are in a paralysis. We know we are
making progress. We know that Noriega is today more weakened than
he was three months ago and definitely more weakened than he was
six months ago,'' Sosa said.
   Sosa suggested that Democratic presidential candidate Michael
Dukakis was being misleading earlier Thursday when he said the
Reagan administration had engaged in ``criminal'' dealings with
Noriega, ignoring the military leader's alleged involvement in drug
trafficking. Noriega has been indicted on drug charges by two
federal grand juries in Florida.
   Based on what he has read, Sosa said, ``past mistakes'' by the
United States concerning Panama date back to 1972 and have been
committed by every administration since then.
   Insisting that it would be improper to dwell on the past, Sosa
said ``as long as the administration is constructive, positive and
supportive of our efforts, that is what we want.''
   Sosa, alluding to the series of economic sanctions the
administration has imposed against Panama, said he is grateful for
the U.S. contribution to the anti-Noriega cause.
   Among other measures, the United States has imposed a series of
economic sanctions against Panama.

<HEAD>Burundi's Leader Says Soldiers Killed Civilians In Reprisal For
Massacres</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JERRY GRAY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>KIGALI, Rwanda (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Burundi's leader said Thursday his
soldiers killed civilians in reprisals for the massacres of rival
tribesmen, and he said the death toll from the ethnic war could
rise above 5,000.
   The leader, Maj. Pierre Buyoya, was quoted on state-run Radio
Burundi, monitored in neighboring Rwanda. More than 41,000
Burundians have fled to Rwanda to escape fighting between the
majority Hutu and the minority Tutsi, who control Burundi's
government and military.
   The government said Monday that 5,000 people were killed, but
Buyoya said some bodies may not have been counted. The government
said its initial figure came from gravediggers sent to bury the
dead.
   Buyoya said the soldiers who killed Hutu civilians were not
acting under government orders but started the slaughter after
discovering the bodies of Tutsi tribesmen.
   Many of the Hutu refugees fleeing to Rwanda arrived with
bayonet, knife and bullet wounds, as well as stories of soldiers
killing Hutu on sight. Until Thursday, the Burundi government
denied those allegations.
   The trouble began Aug. 14 when the Hutu attacked Tutsi in two
communities in northern Burundi, hacking hundreds to death with
machetes and burning people alive in huts, refugees said.
   Buyoya blamed the trouble on exiled Hutu he said had crossed
from Tanzania.
   But refugees blamed most of the deaths on Burundi's
Tutsi-dominated army.
   ``The soldiers were rounding up Hutus and shooting them,'' one
refugee said. ``They are collecting them into groups, taking them
inside houses, closing the doors and windows and then shooting.''
   Reverin Ndururutse, 32, said his 5-year-old nephew and his
3-year-old son were the only survivors of a family of 15 herded
into a house by soldiers who opened fire. He said the adults threw
themselves on top of the two children.
   In Washington, the State Department said Hutu civilians, not the
army, probably initiated the violence. Spokeswoman Phyllis Oakley
said, ``It's a tragic situation'' and said the United States was
giving emergency aid to the refugees in Rwanda.
   Rwanda appealed for international aid for the sudden influx of
refugees, who still are arriving at an average of 2,000 per day,
according to the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees office in
Rwanda.
   Rwanda is the most densely populated nation in Africa, and the
refugees are severely straining the impoverished country's
resources.
   Burundi has asked the refugees to return home and promised to
help them resettle.
   In an appeal to diplomatic missions Thursday, Burundi asked for
international aid to help rehabilitate the 100,000 people it said
were affected by the slaughter.
   The government said it would need enough tents, blankets,
cooking utensils, food and other supplies to aid the affected
population for three months, according to a Western diplomat in
Burundi's capital, Bujumbura.
   ``It just said it had taken stock of what was needed, but did
not state amounts,'' said the diplomat, who spoke on condition of
anonymity in a telephone interview.
   The note did not explain how the government arrived at the
100,000 figure or the three-month time frame, said the diplomat.
   Buyoya said Wednesday his government was trying to restore order
and promised that those found guilty of involvement in the
slaughter would be punished, Radio Burundi reported in a broadcast
monitored in Nairobi.
   He appealed to those who lost their relatives ``to refrain from
acts of violence and revenge. Such behavior may reverse our aim of
forging ahead in developing Burundi.''
   Buyoya, who seized power in a bloodless coup Sept. 3, 1987, said
the victims of the fighting ``belonged to all tribes,'' according
to the broadcast.
   Buyoya said his government would try as soon as possible to lift
a 7 p.m. to 5 a.m. curfew. The government also has restricted
travel between towns and banned meetings of more than five people.
   Rwanda and Burundi, former Belgium colonies, each are about the
size of Maryland. About 6.1 million people are crammed into Rwanda,
while 5 million live in Burundi, Africa's second most densely
populated country.
   The short, stocky Hutu comprise about 84 percent of the
population in both nations and the tall, lanky Tutsi 15 percent.
But the Hutu have ruled in Rwanda since 1959, when they overthrew
the former Tutsi-dominated government and killed an estimated
100,000 people.
   In Burundi, the Tutsi have held onto power. The most serious
threat to Tutsi rule was in 1972, when the Hutu attempted a coup,
killing hundreds of Tutsi before the rebellion was crushed.
   The government retaliated by slaughtering between 100,000 and
300,000 Hutu, incuding most of the tribe's intelligentsia,
according to human rights groups.

<HEAD>Hostages Will Be Freed Soon, Beirut Newspaper Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The 18 foreign hostages held in Lebanon
will be freed soon, a leading Beirut newspaper reported Thursday.
   Anglican Church envoy Terry Waite will be the first one
released, the daily As-Safir said. ``The countdown has begun,'' it
said in a one-paragraph report attributed to unidentified Western
diplomatic sources in Moslem west Beirut.
   The leftist newspaper, based in west Beirut, has good
connections with Moslem groups that may have information on the
hostages, most of whom are believed held by pro-Iranian Shiite
Moslem zealots.
   Rumors of an impending release of hostages have been frequent
around the Middle East since Iran and Iraq agreed to a cease-fire
and peace talks.
   However, the pro-Iranian group believed to hold most of the
hostages issued a statement last week denying those reports.
   ``The release of Anglican Church envoy Terry Waite will be the
first step'' to freeing the hostages, the paper said without saying
when that would happen.
   Waite, 48, envoy of the Archbishop of Canterbury, the most Rev.
Robert Runcie, disappeared Jan. 20, 1987, after leaving his west
Beirut hotel to negotiate the release of American hostages held by
the pro-Iranian Islamic Jihad, or Islamic Holy War.
   An anonymous caller purporting to speak for Islamic Jihad told a
news agency in Beirut last week that Waite was alive and ``We might
release him if the government of (Prime Minister Margaret) Thatcher
showed good intentions.''
   However, Islamic Jihad had not claimed Waite's abduction. It
also had insisted in the past that it would communicate only in
writing and accompanied by a photograph of one of the hostages to
prove the message's authenticity.
   One day after the Aug. 17 telephone call, Islamic Jihad sent
such a statement to a Western news agency, insisting that no
hostage will be freed until its demands are met. That statement was
accompanied by a photograph of American hostage Terry Anderson.
``What everyone expects soon is a mirage assumed to be water by a
thirsty man,'' said the statement.
   Anderson, 40, of Lorain, Ohio, is chief Middle East
correspondent for The Associated Press. He is the longest-held
hostage, kidnapped on March 16, 1985.
   ``Counting on regional and international developments will not
be of use at all in releasing the captives in Lebanon,'' the
statement said, apparently referring to the recent cease-fire in
the Iran-Iraq war and conciliatory statements by some Iranian
leaders toward the West.
   The hostages include eight Americans and two Britons in addition
to Anderson and Waite. The other captives are a West German, an
Italian, an Irishman, an Indian and two unidentified men.

   Government figures showed Thursday that the
economy, surging through a stiff drag caused by the drought, grew
at the surprisingly brisk annual pace of 3.3 percent in the second
quarter but inflation hit a six-year peak of 5.1 percent.
   The Commerce Department said that the gain in the gross national
product, the total output of goods and services, would have soared
beyond the 3.3 percent clip had it not been for a
larger-than-expected $9.5 billion loss in farm production. Without
that impact of the drought, GNP growth from April through June
would have hit a 4.3 percent annual pace, it said.
   The 5.1 percent inflation rate, compared with just 1.7 percent
in the first quarter, sparked new worries that the Federal Reserve
will be forced to step up its anti-inflation campaign by sending
interest rates even higher to quell the heatup.
   ``The economy is growing much too fast,'' said Robert Dederick,
chief economist of the Northern Trust Co. of Chicago. ``It is nice
to grow fast at the early stages of an expansion when you have an
lot of unemployment, but at this stage we just can't afford it.''
   The 3.3 percent second quarter growth represented an upward
revision from a month ago when the government estimated the GNP
expanded at a 3.1 percent during the spring. GNP growth in the
first three months of the year was 3.4 percent.
   Strength in both quarters came from big improvements in the
trade deficit, which shrank at an annual rate of $18.9 billion in
the spring, the best performance in eight years.
   Business investment shot up 16.3 percent in the second quarter,
the biggest increase in a year, as companies boosted capital
spending plans to meet increased export demands. Government and
consumer spending was up as well in the second quarter.
   But the demand strength helped trigger a sharp jump in prices.
After rising at an annual rate of 1.7 percent in the first quarter,
the GNP deflator's 5.1 percent showing in the second quarter was
the worst since the third quarter of 1982.
   The big jump in the GNP deflator, which reflects changes in
buying patterns as well as prices, was attributed to higher costs
for clothing, food and gasoline.
   ``It is no surprise that inflation is rising,'' said Allen
Sinai, chief economist of the Boston Co. ``We are seeing classic
demand-pull inflation where too many dollars are chasing too few
goods.''
   But even economists who fear rising inflation and
credit-tightening by the Fed will topple the country into a new
recession are not predicting a downturn until mid-1989 at the
earliest.
   Growth in the current July-September quarter will likely be even
stronger than the spring quarter, promising a robust economy
through the Nov. 8 presidential election, analysts said. And many
economists believe the country will be able to escape a slump next
year as well.
   ``We are not calling for a recession because we don't think that
inflation is going to get so high that the Fed will have to tighten
that severely,'' said David Berson, chief economic forecaster for
the Federal National Mortgage Association.
   He predicted that the GNP would expand at a 4 percent rate this
year, the best showing since 1984. He said growth would slow to
just half that pace in 1989 as the higher interest rates ripple
through the economy.
   The higher rates have already begun to pinch the housing
industry. Sales of existing single-family homes fell 5 percent in
July to an annual rate of 3.63 million units. The National
Association of Realtors blamed recent increases in mortgage rates
for the first sales decline in six months.
   In another report, the Commerce Department said that after-tax
profits by corporations surged 11.5 percent in the second quarter
to an annual rate of $166.6 billion. It was the best showing for
profits in five years, but economists warned that profits are
likely to be squeezed beginning in the second half of the year from
rising labor costs.
   The government estimated that the drought will reduce farm
output by $14.3 billion in 1988, shaving about one-half percentage
point from growth for the full year. The impact in the second
quarter dropped production at an annual rate of $9.5 billion and
the government said the impact would be even more severe in the
third and fourth quarters of the year.
   Analysts said this reduction, while slowing growth, will worsen
inflationary pressures as well because it reflects a drop in output
rather than a reduction in demand.
   The various changes left the GNP, after adjusting for inflation,
at an annual rate of $3.99 trillion in the second quarter.

   Applause, hearty handshakes and declarations
of friendship and world peace greeted a small delegation from
Dickson, Siberia, on Thursday on the first visit by Soviet citizens
to President Reagan's boyhood home.
   Autograph seekers and well-wishers crowded the yard around the
two-story, white frame house where Ronald ``Dutch'' Reagan lived in
1920 as a 9-year-old boy with his parents, Jack and Nelle, and
older brother Neil.
   A private tour of the Reagan home topped the agenda for Dickson
Mayor Nikolai T. Kartamyshev, journalist Boris S. Ivanov and
interpreter Nikolai S. Vishnevsky of Moscow.
   ``I have written in the special (guest) book inside that a great
man deserved a great memory and I am happy to be at such a special
place,'' Kartamyshev said as the delegation finished its tour of
the three-bedroom house.
   ``There are a lot of great men who have come from small and
ordinary places,'' he said.
   Mayor James E. Dixon of the host city doffed his straw top hat
and officially welcomed the Soviet group.
   ``They are trying to show us that they are good people and they
want peace,'' Dixon said. ``I hope they will go back knowing we are
their friends.''
   Dixon said the Soviet visitors were suffering from jet lag,
having arrived in this town of 15,700 aobut 100 miles west of
Chicago, late Wednesday night. But they appeared enthusiastic when
greeted by a crowd of about 100.
   ``We are carrying with us warmest greetings from all the
residents of Dickson,'' Kartamyshev said. ``Now we can say
something has been achieved with our sister-city ties.''
   Many in the crowd wore buttons proclaiming ``Peace on Earth'' in
English and Russian. Others had pictures of the flags of the United
States and the Soviet Union.
   As the Soviets made their way from their tour car to the house,
they were stopped several times by onlookers who shook their hands,
slapped their backs and welcomed them.
   A local radio station broadcast the ceremonies live, including a
15-minute speech by Kartamyshev, who also answered questions from
reporters.
   ``We associate Reagan with the positive changes in relations
between our countries,'' Kartamyshev said. ``It's interesting to
see where he spent his childhood.''
   The Soviet mayor said he hoped the spirit of ``glasnost,'' a new
spirit of openness in Soviet society, would allow a reciprocal
visit by Dixon's mayor and other Americans to his town. It is a
remote, frontier village of about 5,000 in extreme northern
Siberia, above the Arctic Circle.
   Dickson, named for Oskar Dickson, a 19th-century Swedish
merchant who provided supplies for expeditions for early Arctic
explorers, generally is closed to foreign visitors because of
nearby military installations.
   Kartamyshev said he no longer fears a world war between the
superpowers because of Reagan's recent peace initiatives and said
the Dickson-to-Dixon good-will summit was evidence of the U.S.
president's success.
   The Soviets brought gifts for their hosts, including a medallion
inscribed ``From Dickson With Love'' and bearing the American and
Soviet flags united in a heart-shape.
   Reagan, son of a shoe salesman and a dressmaker, lived in Dixon
from 1920 until he left for college in 1928.
   However, his parents never owned a house and lived in several
places during the 17 years they called Dixon home.
   The house picked as the Reagan museum was the first place the
family lived in Dixon and it's the home Reagan said he remembered
best.
   The Soviets where shown the bed Reagan shared with his brother,
the wallpaper in the living room, decorated just as it was in 1920,
and they even saw the loose tile around the fireplace where Reagan
hid pennies.

   Iran and Iraq on Thursday opened the first
face-to-face negotiations on ending their 8-year-old war, and the
mediator, U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar, voiced
hope they would embark on a ``path of peace.''
   Perez de Cuellar welcomed the delegations headed by Iranian
Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati and his Iraqi counterpart,
Tariq Aziz, and they sat at long, rectangular tables positioned
left and right of the U.N. team in a triangular fashion.
   ``Your presence clearly indicates your governments are quite
prepared to pursue the path of peace,'' he said, adding that he
hoped the talks would be ``businesslike, constructive and, indeed,
productive.''
   The atmosphere in the ornate U.N. hall was sober. Aziz smiled
and nodded at the Iranians when the two delegations entered the
chamber, but there was no reaction.
   The delegates numbered 13 on the Iranian side and 15 on the
Iraqi side. Perez de Cuellar was flanked by five aides.
   The meeting began about 20 minutes late. As journalists were
told to leave the chamber so that the private talks could start,
Aziz lit a cigar and began puffing on it.
   U.N. spokesman Francois Giuliani said the meeting was conducted
in English, Arabic and Farsi.
   After about 2{ hours, the delegations moved into different
rooms, where U.N. representatives consulted with them separately.
Giuliani said he could not provide further details and added: ``It
is not a bad sign, nor a good sign. It's a normal process of
consultation.''
   ``It was a good discussion,'' Perez de Cuellar said Thursday
night as he announced the talks had ended for the day and would
resume Friday. ``We covered many points and the two parties want to
consult with their covernments.''
   Giuliani said the round of talks was expected to continue
through Sunday at least, but he did not know exactly when it would
end or when Perez de Cuellar would leave Geneva.
   A truce that took effect Aug. 20 appeared to be holding. Saeem
Fahmawi, a spokesman for the 350 United Nations observers
patrolling the 733-mile Iraq-Iran warfront, said in Baghdad that
there have been no major violations.
   Hashemi Rafsanjani, Iran's Parliament Speaker and acting
commander of the country's armed forces, charged on Thursday,
however, that Iraq was ``obstructing peace efforts'' to end the
conflict, Tehran radio reported.
   Rafsanjani said Iran will keep its forces along the front line
``so that Iraq is forced to accept peace.''
   Before their face-to-face meeting Thursday, Aziz and Velayati
held separate talks with Perez de Cuellar, the Iraqi for about 50
minutes and the Iranian for 75 minutes. Both ignored questions
shouted by reporters waiting at the main entrance of the building.
   The two delegations include political representatives, legal
experts, army representatives and officials of relief societies.
   The talks are the first step toward implementing U.N. Resolution
598, which was adopted by the Security Council more than one year
ago. It calls on Iran and Iraq to cooperate with the
secretary-general in achieving ``a comprehensive, just and
honorable settlement'' of all outstanding issues.
   Implementation of the cease-fire resolution involves a wide
range of issues including settlement of border disputes and
establishment of a commission to determine which side started the
war.
   Diplomats have said that Iran and Iraq are divided over the
agenda of peace talks. Iran is seeking strict adherence to
Resolution 598, while Iraq wants to introduce other issues, like
navigation rights in the disputed border, the Shatt-al-Arab
waterway.
   Repatriation of POWs is also expected to be a thorny issue.
Perez de Cuellar has said there are more than 80,000 POWs in total.
Many of the prisoners on both sides are expected to refuse
repatriation because they have publicly supported the detaining
country.
   The all-Swiss International Committee of the Red Cross, which is
expected to organize the repatriation, has said it will require a
mandate from both sides allowing it access to every prisoner to
make sure he agrees to repatriation.
   U.N. sources said the U.N. chief was considering appointing
former Swiss president Kurt Furgler as his representative to
mediate the talks. The multilingual Furgler, who made Swiss history
as successful mediator in a dispute between two Swiss language
groups, served on the federal cabinet until last year.
   If the negotiations are still under way in mid-September, they
might move to U.N. headquarters in New York, because Perez de
Cuellar must preside at the opening of the General Assembly on
Sept. 20, said U.N. spokeswoman Nadia Younes.
   The exiled main Iraqi opposition group, the Tehran-based Supreme
Council of the Islamic Revolution in Iraq, said peace was
impossible unless it can join the talks.

official said.
   Sattar Edhi, who operates nationwide ambulance and social

Hyderabad, 107 miles northeast of Karachi.
   Most of the victims were teenage boys returning home from a
holiday procession in Hyderabad, Edhi said. The small, locally

   Police were searching Thursday for a
Japanese man suspected of being a leftist radical banned from South
Korea. Authorities are concerned about possible terrorist
infiltration before the Olympic Games.
   Police officials said they were looking for a man identified as
Hiroyaki Kawamura, who arrived in Seoul on a 30-day tourist visa.
They said there is a ban on a leftist of that name, but they did
not know if it was the same man.
   South Korean authorities have been on the lookout for terrorists
who might try to disrupt the Olympic Games, scheduled in Seoul
Sept. 17-Oct. 2.
   A senior member of the Japanese Red Army terrorist group, who
was detained in Tokyo late last year, reportedly was headed for
Seoul. The group has ties to communist North Korea, which is
threatening to boycott the Olympics unless it is allowed to co-host
the Games.
   The International Olympic Committee has rejected North Korea's
bid to co-host the Olympics on the grounds that the Games are
awarded to a single city.

<TEXT>
   Republican George Bush pledged
Thursday to help minorities ``who haven't really had a shot at the
starting line'' by giving tax breaks to businesses that locate in
urban and rural enterprise zones.
   In a campaign appearance filled with Hispanic overtones, Bush
said he would revive the faltering oil industry, create a better
climate for small business, fight against federal gun control and
provide jobs for the state's large minority population.
   Standing on the historic San Antonio riverfront in a
sweat-drenched guayaberra, a Latino-style cotton shirt, Bush touted
the Reagan administration record of 17 million new jobs, but did
not repeat his own pledge to create 30 million new jobs. Some of
Bush's own advisers said that promise was a bit hyperbolic.
   ``I want to help these minorities who haven't really had a shot
at the starting line,'' he said, pledging to do that by creating
tax breaks for businesses that locate in rural and urban areas.
   As he was leaving San Antonio, reporters asked Bush if he
thought the cntroversy over running mate Dan Quayle was behind him.
``Yes, I do,'' he said. ``There does seem to be forward motion _
it's something in the air.''
   ``It smells like victory,'' Bush added.
   Bush, a New England native who has made Texas his adopted home
state, made repeated mention of the fact that 40 years ago he and
his wife Barbara chose to move here.
   ``I knew that Texas was where I wanted to raise our family and
where we wanted to go out and make a living,'' he told the rally.
   His voice rising, Bush continued, ``I was drawn to this state by
two things _ Texas was a place of big opportunity, a can-do place,
and it was strong in the traditional values _ family, faith and
peace and patriotism. I keep those values uppermost in my mind,''
he said.
   Bush also said he would ``put some incentive back into the
energy business'' and decrease dependence on foreign oil. And he
said he would cut the capital gains tax and keep Congress ``from
strangling small business with regulation.''
   Bush arrived at the rally of a few hundred supporters after
taking a tour by tourist barge for about a mile down the river. He
was serenaded by mariachi guitar players. The rally closed with a
mariachi version of ``Hail to the Chief,'' and a song that has
become one of the Republican theme songs this year, ``La Bamba.''
   Bush compared opponent Michael Dukakis to former president Jimmy
Carter, saying voters did not want to return to the ``malaise''
that occurred ``the last time a governor came out of nowhere and
became president of the United States.
   ``We need proven tested leadership,'' he said.
   He continued his criticsm of Dukakis' veto of a Massachussetts
measure that would have required teachers to lead their classes in
the Pledge of Allegiance.
   ``I think it's time he let the Pledge of Allegiance out on
furlough,'' Bush said. Referring to the fact that courts have
upheld the Dukakis point of view, Bush said he would appoint judges
who would interpret the Constitution _ ``not legislate.''
   Bush made the remarks during a four-day swing through Texas, a
state where his campaign is focusing with increasing intensity
since the Democrats named Texas Sen. Lloyd Bentsen to their ticket.
   ``I'm proud to be back in my home state of Texas,'' he said.
   Bush flew to San Antonio from Houston, where he maintains an
official address at the posh Houstonian Hotel.
   Bush's roots in Texas go back to the 1940s when he and his wife
Barbara moved here, and Bush began his career in the oil business.
Eventually he started his own company, and then was elected to
Congress from Texas.

   Senators Ernest F. Hollings and

and discussed a new U.S. trade law and textile bill that Indonesia
fears is protectionist.
   After the meeting, Hollings, D-S.C., told reporters he would try
to retain the free trade system because the United States has
bought many agricultural and industrial products from Indonesia.
   A trade ministry expert, Rudy Lengkong, said the minister
conveyed to the senators Indonesia's deep concern over the new
trade bill during the meeting, and warned that it might be
protectionist.
   He said Indonesia will continue to seek official ways to ease
the restrictions because ``we have also purchased U.S. commodities
like cotton, flour and soybeans in a large amount.''
   Hollings and Shelby, D-Ala., arrived here Wednesday for an
official visit through Aug. 29.
   Earlier they paid a courtesy call on President Suharto.

<TEXT>
   The value of U.S. agricultural exports is
expected to jump 22 percent to a four-year high of $34 billion this
fiscal year, up from $27.9 billion in 1986-87, the Agriculture
Department said Thursday.
   In terms of actual quantity, shipments were forecast at 146
million metric tons in the year that will end Sept. 30, up 13
percent from last year.
   Both the value and quantity estimates were up from the previous
USDA forecasts on May 26 of $33.5 billion and 145.5 million tons.
   Although the report cited no figures for subsequent years, it
said export values may increase in 1988-89 due to higher prices but
the volume of shipments may decline.
   The report said the rise in estimates since May stemmed from
larger-than-expected exports of animal products, slightly larger
subsidized wheat exports, and higher corn prices due to the drought.
   Noting that 1987-88 exports are now expected to be up $6.1
billion and 16.8 million tons, the report said, ``This largely
reflects reduced competitor supplies; higher prices for grains,
oilseeds and cotton; and increased U.S. export competitiveness''
helped by a lower-valued dollar and the Export Enhancement Program,
or EEP.
   Under EEP, selected countries _ including the Soviet Union and
China _ can get wheat and other designated commodities subsidized
by the U.S. government.
   The new forecast showed the value of grain exports at $12.2
billion, up from $11.8 billion expected in May and 1986-87
shipments worth $9.33 billion.
   Oilseeds, mainly soybeans, were forecast at $7.6 billion, down
slightly from $7.7 billion indicated three months ago. But that was
up from $6.47 billion last year.
   Exports of livestock products this year were raised to $4.7
billion from the May forecast of $4.5 billion. In 1986-87, those
were valued at $3.96 billion.
   Other major categories included: horticultural products, $3.7
billion this year, the same as indicated in May but up from $3.15
billion in 1986-87. Cotton export values were shown at $2.2
billion, the same as the earlier forecast. Last year's cotton
shipments were worth $1.43 billion.

   Japan's new defense chief said Thursday the
government must win the people's ``understanding and support'' and
he expressed regret over the collision of a submarine and a fishing
boat that killed 30 civilians.
   Kichiro Tazawa spoke to senior agency officials and officers one
day after he was appointed by the prime minister as the agency's
new director-general, replacing Tsutomu Kawara.
   Kawara resigned Wednesday to take responsibility for the deaths
in the incident July 23, when a naval submarine and a sport fishing
boat collided in Tokyo Bay. Thirty of the 48 passengers aboard the
fishing vessel were killed.
   ``The nation's defense is first established based on the
people's understanding and support. In this regard the collision
between the submarine and the fishing boat is truly regrettable,''
Defense Agency spokesman Youichi Fukumori quoted Tazawa as saying.
   Tazawa, 70, a former minister of Agriculture, Forestry and
Fisheries and head of the National Land Agency, also said the
agency will take ``all possible measures'' to prevent similar
accidents from recurring, according to Fukumori.

<TEXT>
   A press plane chartered by George Bush's
presidential campaign was forced to abort its takeoff from a
Houston airfield Thursday, the third time in less than a week that
problems plagued a Bush press plane.
   In the latest incident, a United Airlines Boeing 737-300 was
beginning its takeoff at Ellington Field when the pilot suddenly
applie the brakes.
   No injuries were reported but about 50 reporters and
photographers were temporarily stranded and were unable to cover
the vice president's trip to San Antonio.
   John Clark, 49, the pilot, told reporters one engine had
overheated and that he decided to abort shortly before the plane
reached the critical point of takeoff.
   ``The indicator lights showed the engine was hot and we decided
to abort at 60 knots,'' he said.
   The journalists were told that immediate repairs were not
possible. A smaller group of reporters accompanied the vice
president aboard Air Force Two.
   Bush was scheduled to return to Houston and spend the night
there before flying to Longview, Texas, on Friday for another
appearance.
   The Bush campaign's press plane problems began last Saturday
when fumes from an air conditioning vent filled the cabin as a
Boeing 727 landed in Columbus, Ohio. That plane is owned by Key
Airlines.
   Two days later, the same plane had just taken off from Chicago
when the pilots noticed the jet's wing flaps would not retract. The
plane returned to Chicago after the pilots dumped fuel into Lake
Michigan.
   Reporters covering Bush refused to fly on another Key Airlines
plane, so the campaign chartered a new press plane from Sun World
Airlines for an uneventful flight Tuesday night to Sacramento,
Calif.
   Thelma LeBrecht, an AP Network News reporter covering Bush, said
reporters were not told why the campaign had switched to a United
charter on Thursday, but she said most reporters expressed relief
that a major carrier had been chosen.
   When the United flight was aborted, however, she said, many
reporters broke into a chant: ``Key Air, Key Air.''

said Judge Niels Erik Jensen.
   Gottlieb, 56, testified in Copenhagen city court, and his
testimony will be sent to authorities in Stuttgart, West Germany,
who will decide whether to request Schwamberger's extradition.
   Gottlieb, who immigrated here 17 years ago and took Danish
citizenship, lost his entire family during the Nazi occupation of
his village of Przemysl in eastern Poland during World War II.
   He told the court that as a 12-year-old he witnessed
Schwamberger participate in the killings of many Jews, including a
woman and 25 children who were forced to dig their own graves and
then were shot.
   Schwamberger, 76, is a former SS officer suspected of ordering
killings in Przemysl in 1943 and 1944. He is imprisoned in
Argentina.
   ``I saw him whipping children and forcing people to dig their
own graves and then shooting them. That man is responsible for the
deaths of thousands of people,'' Gottlieb was quoted as saying by
the B.T. newspaper.

   Iranian-backed Shiite Moslem militants
Thursday buried five of their fighters killed in a clash with the
Israeli Army in south Lebanon, and vowed to intensify their
guerrilla war.
   ``We shall escalate the fighting against Israel until victory,''
said Sheik Mohammed Yazbek, a leader of Hezbollah, or Party of God.
   He told about 100 mourners during the funeral of the five
guerrillas killed Wednesday: ``The martyrs who fell in the heroic
confrontation yesterday call upon all of you to take part in
military action against the Zionists.''
   Mourners chanted ``Allah akbar!'' (``God is great!'') as the
funeral procession moved through Sohmor village in the western
Bekaa Valley north of Israel's self-designated border security zone.
   Six Israeli soldiers were wounded in the clash with Hezbollah
near the village of Kawkaba, nine miles north of Sohmor.
   Israel established the six- to 10-mile zone in 1985, when it
withdrew the bulk of its army from south Lebanon three years after
invading the country.
   The zone, patrolled by 1,000 Israelis and more than 1,000
militiamen of the Israeli-armed South Lebanon Army, serves as a
buffer against cross-border raids.

<HEAD>Union Carbide Tells Court It Will Keep $3 Billion</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BHOPAL, India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Union Carbide Co. assured a court Thursday
it would keep as assets $3 billion, the amount of money the Indian
government claims as compensation for the gas disaster that killed
more than 2,800 people.
   Anil Diwan, attorney for the Danbury, Conn.-based company, gave
a written agreement to Bhopal District Judge M.W. Deo.
   Carbide was responding to fears expressed by Indian government
lawyers that Carbide would restructure its capital worldwide in an
effort to circumvent the court's final ruling.
   More than 2,800 people died in December 1984 when toxic gas
leaked from a Bhopal pesticide plant owned by Carbide's Indian
subsidiary.
   The Indian government, on behalf of the victims, filed a $3
billion lawsuit against Union Carbide in September 1986, claiming
negligence caused the worst industrial accident in history.
   Union Carbide has maintained it was caused by sabotage by a
disgruntled employee.
   India filed suit after passing a law making it the sole
representative of all the victims and after a U.S. court said
American courts did not have jurisdiction in the case.
   In its written agreement, Carbide said it ``has maintained and
shall continue to maintain unencumbered assets with a fair market
value of $3 billion.''
   Indian government counsel Vepa Sarathy told the Bhopal court
that the document was legal because it was not signed. Deo called
it ``an inadvertent error'' and ordered Carbide lawyers to get it
signed.
   Deo suspended hearings in the case until the High Court rules on
a petition filed by Carbide in July. Carbide is seeking to have Deo
removed from the case, accusing him of bias against the company.
   The hearing will reconvene Sept. 16.

   Sen. Paul Simon and South
African Foreign Minister Pik Botha met Thursday and said they were
able to debate apartheid without yelling at each other.
   ``You name the controversial agenda ... we talked about it,''
said Simon, D-Ill., who favors U.S. economic sanctions against
South Africa. ``We had a good, frank discussion.''
   Simon, who unsuccessfully ran for president this year, is on a
five-day fact-finding tour of South Africa.
   Simon is chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Subcommittee
on African Affairs and will play a major role in deliberations on
pending legislation to intensify U.S. sanctions against South
Africa. Limited sanctions have been in effect since 1986.
   ``We never yelled at each other,'' Botha said after the
100-minute meeting in a Johannesburg suburb. ``The senator has put
all the difficult questions. But he has given me the opportunity to
put my side. That's all I can ask.''
   Botha and other South African leaders say they are pursuing
gradual race reforms at their own pace and will not be pressured by
sanctions. They also say black South Africans stand to suffer the
most from any hardships caused by sanctions or foreign
disinvestment.
   Simon later flew to Cape Town, where he conferred with two
leaders of the anti-apartheid Progressive Federal Party, including
Helen Suzman, the longest-serving member of Parliament. Mrs. Suzman
opposes sanctions.
   On Friday, Simon plans to visit Crossroads, a black shantytown
near Cape Town. His visit will coincide with one by President P.W.
Botha, who will be making his first official trip to Crossroads.
   By law and custom, apartheid establishes a racially segregated
society in which the 26 million blacks have no vote in national
affairs. The 5 million whites control the economy and maintain
separate districts, schools and health services.
   A pro-government newspaper, The Citizen, editorialized Thursday
that Simon ``came here determined to find justification for
sanctions.''
   ``But then Americans do tend to have a simplistic _ should we
say a Simple Simon _ approach to other countries, and South Africa
is probably the worst example of this American madness to recreate
countries in their own image,'' the newspaper said.
   Earlier in his trip, Simon visited several black townships and
met with black leaders such as Anglican Archbishop Desmond Tutu.
   The senator's request to meet with imprisoned African National
Congress leader Nelson Mandela was rejected by the government. The
70-year-old Mandela, South Africa's best known black leader, is in
Cape Town's Tygerberg Hospital being treated for tuberculosis.

   Two bombs exploded Thursday outside
banks, causing damage but no injuries, a government official said.
Police suspect the Catalonian separatist group Terra Lliure.
   The Basque separatist group ETA, meanwhile, claimed
responsibility for an Aug. 21 car bomb that killed two civil guards
in the northern town of Estella.
   A Barcelona civil governor's office spokesman said the first
bomb exploded at 3:10 a.m. in the doorway of a Banco Espanol de
Credito (Banesto) branch office in the suburb of Hospitalet de
Llobregat.
   The blast damaged the building and four nearby cars in the
northeastern city, the official said.
   Less than two hours later, an explosion rocked a downtown Banco
Central office and shattered glass in surrounding buildings, he
said.
   The official said no group claimed the attacks, but the two
bombs were of a type used by Terra Lliure, which seeks independence
for Catalonia and has carried out frequent attacks in Barcelona,
capital of the autonomous region.
   In the Basque country, ETA claimed responsibility for the Aug.
21 car bomb that exploded as two civil guards drove by in their
patrol car, killing them instantly and slightly injuring a woman
and her young child in a nearby apartment.
   In notes to several Basque newspapers and radio stations, ETA
rejected the government's condition that the group lay down its
weapons before beginning negotiations to end separatist attacks.
   The government also has said it will not talk to ETA until the
group releases businessman Emiliano Revilla, who was kidnapped
outside his Madrid home six months ago.
   ETA, whose name stands for Homeland and Liberty in the Basque
language, seeks independence for the three-province Basque region
and Navarre, the neighboring region where the attack took place.
   ETA has claimed responsibility for killing more than 600 people,
mostly civil guard, military and police officers, since taking up
arms in 1968. It has killed eight people this year.

   Stenosis of the aorta is a constriction of the main artery
pumping blood from the heart and can be corrected by surgery.
   Papandreou underwent tests Tuesday night at the cardiac unit of
Athens General Hospital. Looking flushed, he told reporters as he
walked out of the hospital, ``I simply decided to have a

   Corporations' after-tax profits shot up 11.5
percent from April through June, the biggest advance in five years,
the government reported Thursday.
   The Commerce Department said that after-tax profits rose to an
annual rate of $166.6 billion in the second quarter.
   The increase, which followed a 2.5 percent rise in the first
quarter, was the biggest gain since a 14.5 percent rise in the
second quarter of 1983.
   The profit advance was led by increases for transportation
companies, public utilities and manufacturers of durable goods,
items expected to last three or more years, the report said.
   Manufacturers of non-durable goods had weaker profits in the
second quarter except for petroleum companies, which enjoyed an
increase.
   Allen Sinai, chief economist of the Boston Co., attributed the
overall profits advance to the better-than-expected economic growth
this year.
   ``Corporate profits have been the sensation of the year,
reflecting a strong economy, rising product prices and strong
production growth in manufacturing,'' he said.
   But Sinai said he believed corporate profits would be squeezed
in coming months as business costs, especially wage costs, begin to
accelerate.
   Among the details in the profits report:
   _Before-tax profts jumped 8.6 percent in the second quarter, to
an annual level of $310.7 billion, following a smaller 1.5 percent
first quarter increase.
   _Corporate profits, after adjusting for depreciation and
inventories, rose 5 percent in the second quarter to an annual rate
of $332 billion after no gain at all in the first quarter.
   _Corporate cash flows, a measurement intended to show the funds
corporations have for investment, rose 2.6 percent to an annual
rate of $397.7 billion after a 0.9 percent rise in the first
quarter.
   _Dividend payments to stockholders rose 1.8 percent in the
second quarter to an annual rate of $103.1 billion following a 2.0
percent rise in the first quarter.

   Military President Augusto Pinochet's
decision to lift all states of emergency helps meet opposition
conditions for fair play in an October presidential referendum.
   But other measures being urged by critics have yet to be
adopted, and the critics say doubts persist that the vote will
enjoy legitimacy.
   ``We still have to wait and see,'' Patrico Aylwin, president of
the centrist Christian Democratic Party, told foreign reporters.
   Gen. Pinochet on Wednesday signed decrees to end all states of
emergency for the first time since he seized power in a 1973 coup.
The decrees take effect upon publication in the official bulletin,
expected this week.
   His right-wing government plans a referendum on a single
presidential nominee to be picked by military commanders, including
Pinochet, at a meeting set for next Tuesday. Pinochet, who is also
the army commander, is expected to be nominated.
   No exact date has been announced for the yes-or-no ballot, but
Pinochet said it will be in early October. If a majority vote yes,
the nominee will be president until 1997. If most voters reject
him, open elections will be held in 1990, with Pinochet remaining
in place until then.
   Opposition parties and the local Roman Catholic Church set four
basic conditions for a fair ballot: high voter registration; an end
to the states of emergency; equal access to the mass media, and a
vote free of fraud and intimidation.
   By mid-August more than 7 million of Chile's 8 million eligible
voters had registered, thus resolving the first condition
   The second condition was met, at least formally, by Wednesday's
decrees. Under the emergency states, the right to assembly and
freedom of the press could be restricted and the government could
jail and expel leftist critics.
   With the lifting of the measures, opposition groups can stage
rallies without government authorization. ``It's impossible to
image conducting a campaign without the right to gather publicly,''
Aylwin said.
   He said the opposition would wait and see if the government is
sincere about its vows to respect civil liberties.
   Ricardo Lagos, a prominent Socialist in a 16-party opposition
coalition, said Thursday, ``I'm left with the sensation that this
is a cosmetic operation.''
   Monica Madariaga, a former justice minister under Pinochet who
now is critical of his government, said the president ``has placed
the country under a state of observation'' and could declare a new
state of emergency if the opposition failed to behave.
   On Tuesday, navy commander Jose Merino warned that even stronger
emergency measures could be adopted if public disturbances occurred.
   But Roman Catholic Church leaders expressed confidence in the
government's good faith. Cardinal Juan Francisco Fresno said in a
written statement that he received news of the measure ``with
satisfaction, and asks all Catholics to intensify their prayers for
the welfare of the country.''
   Still pending is the question of access to television and the
press. Television, which is tightly controlled by the state, and
the biggest newspapers have provided little space to the
opposition. Political groups campaigning for a ``no'' vote complain
that their advertisements are rejected but there is intensive
pro-government propaganda.
   ``Under these conditions, the plebiscite loses legitimacy,''
Lagos said in a recent interview.
   Election laws drawn up by the government guarantee each side 15
minutes of free television time each day in September, from 10:45
p.m. to 11:15 p.m. Opposition leaders say the hour is too late for
many people and that this still fails to compensate for hundreds of
pro-government ads broadcast and published during the past year.
   ``There is an immense abuse and fraud by the government in
access to television,'' said Andres Zaldivar, a Christian Democrat.
   He said that because of unfair conditions, if the government
declares a victory in the ballot ``the immense majority of Chileans
are not going to believe it, and the entire world is not going to
believe it.''
   But he and other opposition leaders virtually discount the
possibility of a fraudulent count on the night of the ballot. They
said election laws authorizing the presence of independent monitors
at polling places will make any attempt at direct fraud too obvious.
   The opposition coalition, pro-government parties and a
church-sponsored group each has established a network of thousands
of monitors to provide parallel vote counts.

   Officials declared a state of emergency Thursday
at two Brooklyn psychiatric hospitals, saying patients were
squeezed into overcrowded rooms and forced to sleep in shifts on
cots in hallways.
   The action allows the state to begin moving patients to less
crowded facilities without permission of family or guardians, said
Steve Osborn, a spokesman for state Mental Health Commissioner
Richard C. Surles.
   ``There is no patient privacy, no ability to accommodate
patients who are not able to be admitted as in-patients right
away,'' said the city's mental health chief, Dr. Sara Kellermann,
who had urged Surles to declare the emergency.
   ``As a result they end up eating with trays on their laps, end
up sleeping on very rudimentary cots ... and they are literally
sleeping in hallways in four-hour shifts,'' she said. Hospital
employees would wake patients up after a few hours to allow others
to lay down, she said.
   Though officials were aware of overcrowding at psychiatric
facilities in New York City, they said they did not realize the
magnitude of the problem until they conducted an in-person
investigation.
   The city-run Kings County Hospital has 160 beds for mental
health patients and a current population of 195, according to
Osborn.
   Matters are worse at nighboring Kingsboro State Psychiatric
Center, where there are 566 beds and 736 patients. Osborn said it
was not unusual to see six patients squeezed into a room intended
for four.
   Kellermann said she was extremely distressed at the conditions
she found. In one case, she said, psychiatric patients were placed
in an open, atrium-style emergency room _ sometimes for days _
waiting for a bed.
   State officials denied a request to tour the facility. Osborn
cited patient confidentiality.
   The transfer of about 240 patients from the two centers to
facilities outside New York City should start within a few days,
Osborn said.
   In addition to overcrowding, the state cited Kings County for
``patient idleness,'' lack of privacy and building safety code
deficiencies.

   A tropical depression churned over
the Dominican Republic Thursday after dumping heavy rains on Puerto
Rico, where it killed three people and left 485 homeless.
   The depression, with maximum winds of 35 mph, struck land in the
Dominican Republic after passing 150 miles south of Puerto Rico,
according to the National Weather Service in San Juan.
   A 6 p.m. EDT advisory from the National Hurricane Center in
Miami said the depression was centered over the Dominican Republic
about 75 miles north of Port-au-Prince, capital of neighboring
Haiti. It said the weather system was headed west-northwest at 15
mph and expected to move along the northern coast of Cuba for the
next 12 to 24 hours.
   The system was not expected to grow much stronger unless its
center moved well north of Cuba, forecasters said.
   The depression dropped 6.6 inches of rain on Puerto Rico in 24
hours before moving westward to nearby Dominican Republic,
forecasters said Thursday.
   Two men and a 12-year-old boy were killed in Puerto Rico in two
separate incidents Wednesday night when trees crushed their cars as
they were driving along rural roads, police said.
   State Secretary Sila Calderon declared a state of emergency, and
National Guard units mobilized to rescue families trapped by
swollen rivers. In Mayaguez, on the western side of Puerto Rico,
Civil Defense authorities ordered hundreds of residents in
low-lying areas to abandon their homes.
   More than 100 homes around the island were seriously damaged by
flooding, including two that were destroyed, according to Civil
Defense officials. They also reported 67 flooded areas, 33
mudslides, 18 overflowed rivers, eight damaged highways and three
damaged bridges.
   Nora Perez Ruiz, 22, fled to an emergency shelter with her two
brothers and mother from her home near Mayaguez.
   She said she had worried about flooding since the last major
floods hit the area in 1975. ``I've been nervous and occasionally
haven't been able to sleep thinking about when a flood would
come,'' she said Thursday.
   The state of emergency was lifted Thursday, and public schools
reopened after a daylong closure. But 485 people in 10 towns were
still being sheltered in schools, housing projects and a sports
center, Civil Defense authorities said.
   The depression was expected to trigger rainfalls of 5-10 inches
in the Dominican Republican, where flash flood warnings were in
effect.
   Mark Zimmer, a forecaster for the National Hurricane Center in
Miami, said the depression would weaken as it passed over
Hispaniola, the island shared by the Dominican Republic and Haiti.
   However, he said it could intensify into a tropical storm when
it moves back out to sea. He said that would probably happen Friday.
   ``Right now, it's too early to say whether it's going to become
a hurricane,'' Zimmer added.
   Depressions are upgraded to tropical storms when their maximum
sustained winds reach 39 mph and to hurricanes when maxium
sustained winds hit 74 mph.
   Two tropical storms have developed so far in the Atlantic Ocean
during this year's hurricane season, but neither reached hurricane
strength. The season runs from June 1 to Nov. 30.
   Meanwhile, a second depression that formed near the Cape Verde
Islands off West Africa died Thursday in the distant Atlantic Ocean
about 1,550 miles from Bermuda, forecasters said.

   Two sports agents charged with racketeering and
extortion in their dealings with college athletes pleaded innocent
Thursday and a defense lawyer said they would fight the allegations.
   New York-based agents Norby Walters, 56, and Lloyd Bloom, 29,
entered their pleas before U.S. District Judge George Marovich, who
released the defendants on their own recognizance and set trial for
Feb. 27.
   ``We will defend this case extremely vigorously, you can count
on that,'' said Walters' attorney, Robert Gold.
   Walters and Bloom refused to discuss the case.``In every movie
I've ever seen, they say, `Anything you say can and will be used
against you,' so I'm not saying anything,'' Walters said.
   Walters and Bloom were indicted Wednesday on charges of
racketeering, mail fraud, wire fraud and extortion.
   They are accused of using money and gifts to entice dozens of
players into signed agreements, some of them postdated, allowing
the agents to represent them in professional contract negotiations.
   The National Collegiate Athletic Association prohibits college
players from signing representation contracts or taking money while
still eligible to compete.
   If the players tried to back out of the deals, they were warned
that Walters and Bloom had friends who would visit them and break
their legs, said U.S. Attorney Anton R. Valukas. An imprisoned mob
figure was named as an unindicted co-conspirator.
   The indictment said Walters, who heads World Sports &
Entertainment in New York, also used threats to sign acts in the
music business, including the Jackson Five.
   Prosecutors said Walters and Bloom induced the athletes to
defraud their schools by accepting cash and signing contracts in
violation of NCAA rules, and then signing affidavits saying they
had not broken any NCAA rules.
   If convicted, the two each would face up to 70 years in prison
and $2 million in fines.
   Valukas said 43 college athletes who signed with Walters and
Bloom avoided prosecution by signing pre-trial agreements to
perform community service and to reimburse portions of their
scholarships to their universities.
   Edward Bozik, athletic director at the University of Pittsburgh,
said he was ``gratified'' by the indictments.
   ``This sends a strong message to the student athletes that they
can be held accountable if they are involved in a fraud,'' he said.
Three of the 43 athletes attended Pitt.
   The indictment named reputed organized crime figure Michael
Franzese as an unindicted co-conspirator, alleging that Walters and
Bloom used his reputation to coerce athletes into signing
contracts. Franzese is serving a 10-year federal prison term in
California for racketeering and tax violations.
   The indictment says Franzese was a silent partner in Walters'
firm, and financed efforts by the two agents to sign college
athletes. The Chicago Tribune, citing unidentified sources, said
prosecutors obtained Franzese's cooperation in the 18-month
investigation.
   In a related case, California-based sports agent Dave Lueddeke,
37, also was charged Wednesday along with Cris Carter, a
22-year-old wide receiver with the National Football League's
Philadelphia Eagles.
   Carter, who left Ohio State with a year of college eligibility
remaining, was charged with obstruction of justice and mail fraud.
Lueddeke was charged with perjury and obstruction of justice
stemming from an alleged $5,000 payment to Carter. Lueddeke was
indicted, while the charges against Carter were included in a
criminal information filed by prosecutors.
   If convicted, Carter would face up to 10 years in prison and a
$500,000 fine, while Lueddeke would face up to 15 years in jail and
a $750,000 fine.

   Flood-ravaged Sudan scraped for such
basics as bread, electricity and drinkable water on Thursday.
Floodwaters covered about 280 square miles of land in the north,
the state-run Sudan News Agency said.
   Electricity, transportation, communications were badly affected.
   The Irrigation Ministry reported a slight drop of 1.2 inches in
the swollen Nile River at this capital city of 4 million people,
and forecast a continued decrease over the next few days.
   Prime Minister Sadek el-Mahdi has warned, however, that the
flood situation could deteriorate again in the first week of
September, the peak rainy season.
   The Sudan News Agency said water covered an area stretching from
Merowe, 200 miles north of Khartoum, to Abri, 100 miles south of
the Egyptian border. It said islands in the Nile were completely
submerged and their inhabitants had been evacuated to safe areas.
   The Nile overcame levees in several areas in Khartoum, including
one containing many diplomatic residences. Military units were
mobilized to help stop the waters' advance.
   Whole suburbs in Khartoum were flooded. Streets were turned into
impassable mud tracks, hampering relief operations.
   Torrential rains Aug. 4-5 triggered the worst floods in this
northeast African country's history. The floods have left 1.5
million people homeless, at least 91 dead, tens of thousands of
homes destroyed and some of Sudan's most fertile farmland inundated.
   Worst affected were shantytowns at the outskirts of Khartoum.
The towns, made up of tin, canvas and mud hovels, house between
750,000 and 1 million displaced Sudanese who fled to the capital to
escape the 5-year-old civil war in the south.
   Despite concerted international relief efforts by about two
dozen countries since the floods started three weeks ago, lines of
children, women and elderly people waiting for bread remain common,
even at night.
   Information Minister El-Sayed Abdallah Mohammed Ahmed on
Wednesday night harshly criticized Europe and the United States,
especially Sudan's former colonial power, Britain, accusing them of
not doing enough in light of the scope of the disaster.
   Opposition parties, however, claimed the government is
distributing relief supplies only to its supporters.
   Eliaba James Sarur, leader of the opposition in Parliament and
chairman of the Union of Sudanese Parties, told a news conference
Thursday the government's parties ``distribute the aid to their
supporters through their members in the Parliament, their election
committees and some of their organizations.''
   The problems have been compounded by the start of the annual
flood of the Nile, which already has overflowed in central and
northern Sudan and in parts of Khartoum.
   Luxurious hotels along the Nile have been surrounded by water.
   In nearby Omdurman, many owners had to abandon flooded dairies
and poultry farms, making the scarcity of fresh milk and eggs worse.
   Britain on Thursday contested claims by Sudan that British aid
for flood victims was inadequate. The Foreign Office said six
planes had flown out with government and charity supplies, not just
one as Ahmed had said.
   Sudanese Charge d'Affaires Gubara Abdelrhman Gubara was summoned
to the Foreign Office in London to be told of Britain's displeasure.
   The International Red Cross said Thursday in Geneva that an
estimated 100,000 trapped victims of the flood disaster will
probably have to be supplied by air.
   Dan Prewitt, head of the International Red Cross delegation at
Khartoum, reported that the airlift was needed because the flooded
area north of the capital was virtually inaccessible.

   A small plane crashed through the
roof of a print shop Thursday, killing three people in the plane
and severely burning one person on the ground, officials said.
   ``It doesn't appear there were any survivors'' from the plane,
said police Sgt. Keith Plant.
   Plant said it is believed there were three people in the
building, located in a small strip shopping center, and three
people in the plane when it crashed.
   Two people in the building escaped with minor injuries but the
third, a 24-year-old woman, was in critical condition with
second-degree burns over her face, neck, chest and arms, said Linda
Hamlin, spokeswoman for Hollywood Memorial Hospital.
   ``The people heard the crash, heard the explosion, and had time
to get out,'' Fire Capt. Sam Halpert said. ``It was a split-second
decision.''
   Federal Aviation Administration spokesman Jack Barker in Atlanta
said the plane was a Piper Aerostar that took off from the nearby
North Perry Airport about 3:30 p.m. The plane can seat six people.
   Halpert said rescuers, who were waiting for the fire to cool
down, hoped that no one else was in the plane or the building. ``We
know we're going to find people dead (from the plane); we're hoping
it's as few as possible,'' he said.
   Ray Saks, who works at the Pembroke Auto Center across the
street from the crash, said he heard the plane ``sputtering and
misfiring up above us.''
   ``Next time we turned around, the wing tip went right into the
roof of Neway Printing on the other side of the street,'' Saks said.
   ``We had an immediate explosion and a fire that went up probably
about 70 feet in the air,'' he said.
   Saks said he was worried because the print shop contained large
amounts of chemicals.
   ``There is the possibility of toxic chemicals,'' Plant said,
adding that hazardous waste teams were on the site. But he said the
fire was under control and the situation was not considered
dangerous.
   Police closed off all roads in the vicinity. The accident cut
power to many homes in the neighborhood.
   Ralph DiGiamo, who owns a nearby deli, said his son Joe, who
worked at the the print shop, and the shop's co-owner, Pat
Goldberg, were the two people who were slightly injured. The
seriously injured woman was another worker, he said, but he didn't
know her full name.
   ``She's lucky she didn't get killed because she works right in
that back end where the plane hit,'' said the elder DiGiamo. ``My
son ran out the front door right away.''

   Masked Palestinians wielding axes killed an
Arab farmer suspected of cooperating with Israel, witnesses said
Thursday. Other masked men attacked Palestinian laborers defying a
strike order and injured three.
   The attacks reflected growing divisions among Palestinians over
the future of their 8{-month uprising.
   Israeli aircraft bombed a Palestinian guerrilla base near the
southern Lebanese port city of Sidon, the army command said.
   Israeli military sources and Lebanese police said rocket-firing
helicopter gunships were used in the air raid, Israel's 13th in
Lebanon this year.
   Lebanese police said 10 people, including one guerrilla, were
wounded in the six-minute attack on targets in the Ein el-Hilweh
refugee camp on the outskirts of Sidon.
   Two Israelis, including a 10-year-old boy, were slightly injured
when attackers threw a firebomb at an Israeli passenger bus
northeast of Jerusalem, police said.
   In the West Bank village of Yatta south of Jerusalem, masked men
broke into the home of Saadi Hazaza late Wednesday, dragged him
outside and hacked him to death with axes, Arab witnesses and
state-run Israel radio reported.
   Underground leaders have urged Palestinians to halt all
cooperation with Israeli authorities, including working for the
Israeli military government, and have called for attacks on
Palestinians who give Israel information.
   Hazaza, 32, was the third suspected collaborator to be killed
since the uprising in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip began
Dec. 8. His death brought to 253 the number of Palestinians killed,
although most have been killed by Israeli gunfire. Four Israelis
also have died.
   The army said Hazaza may have been killed as part of a
longstanding family feud.
   But the radio and witnesses who spoke to The Associated Press
said he had carried a weapon _ a privilege Israel grants only to
Palestinians who provide information to authorities.
   Israel radio also reported that the deputy chief of staff, Maj.
Gen. Ehud Barak, severely reprimanded a senior officer for shooting
and killing a Palestinian after chasing him in a helicopter. Barak
found that the officer, identified only as Col. G., did not shoot
the Palestinian from the air, as had been reported, and convicted
him of improper use of weapons, not manslaughter. The incident
occurred in February near Bani Naim village.
   Israeli newspapers have said the officer intended to resign from
the army.
   Palestinians went on strike Thursday for the third time this
week to protest the deaths of four prisoners in Israeli jails.
   Merchants shut businesses and public transport was halted, but
some Palestinians complained and others tried to reach work in
Israel. Two dozen were seen at a Jerusalem archaeological site.
   Masked men trying to enforce the strike hurled stones at cars
carrying Arab laborers from Bethlehem, injuring three.
   On Wednesday in the northern West Bank village of Azzun,
hundreds of villagers stoned two Palestinian brothers suspected of
collaborating with Israel as they passed in their car, Israel radio
and Arab witnesses said.
   The two were identified as Tahseen Mansour, 43, an
Israeli-appointed regional leader, and Basseem Mansour, 35.
   Tahseen Mansour opened fire, wounding a 20-year-old among the
crowd, the witnesses said, adding that both men escaped.
   The Israeli army maintained curfews Thursday on six areas in the
West Bank and Gaza Strip, confining some 255,000 Palestinians to
their homes.
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir said in a message to U.S.
Secretary of State George P. Shultz that Israel would ``continue
its policy of selective deportations,'' a Shamir aide said.
   Shamir sent his spoken message through U.S. Ambassador Thomas
Pickering. It came in response to criticism from the State
Department, which said continued Israeli deportations could
threaten relations between Jerusalem and Washington.
   Since the start of the Palestinian uprising, Israel has deported
33 Palestinians and ordered another 25 expelled.
   ``The U.S. is not responsible for order here _ we are,'' Shamir
said in remarks broadcast by Israel radio.

   A mobile home carrying American
handicapped children slipped off a road in this Nuevo Leon state
capital Thursday, and two children and the driver were slighly
injured, Federal Highway Police said.
   Police Commander Raul Sandoval said the children, aged 6 and 11,
and the 45-year-old woman driver were treated at Monterrey
University Hospital and released.
   Sandoval identified the woman as the director of the Hope House,
a home for handicapped children in Austin, Texas. He said he did
not know her name and referred further inquiries to the U.S.
Consulate.
   Jorge Cavazos, a U.S. Consulate official, said her name was Rosy
White McGarrigl, but he did not have the childrens' identities. He
said the three were in fine condition and apparently would go home
Thursday.
   The Americans were returning from a vacation trip to
Guadalajara, capital of Jalisco state, about 600 miles southwest of
Monterrey.
   Sandoval said the mobile home, with four or five children
aboard, was on a highway on Monterrey's northeast when the driver
attempted to turn into a gasoline station.
   The wheels of the vehicle apparently locked and it slid off the
road into a 5-foot ditch. A small wheelchair was found at the
scene. The accident happened shortly after 6 a.m., Sandoval said.
   ``She was driving very slowly. It's just that she had some
mechanical problems,'' Sandoval said in a telephone interview.
   He said the mobile home was being followed by a bus carrying
about 25 children from the same institute and both vehicles were
heading toward the border at Laredo, Texas, about a three-hour
drive from Monterrey.

   Democratic vice presidential candidate
Lloyd Bentsen last week ordered stocks in companies doing business
in South Africa sold after finding his blind trust had invested in
them, his spokesman said Thursday.
   ``He just did it'' without any prodding from anyone, spokesman
Jack Devore said, confirming a report Thursday in The Patriot
Ledger of Quincy, Mass. The report said the Texas senator saw the
blind trust stock holdings for the first time on Aug. 12, about a
month after his nomination for the vice presidency.
   The newspaper report said the trust had invested $120,000 to
$400,000 in the companies.
   By selling the stocks, Bentsen avoided a conflict with the
Democratic Party platform, which calls for South Africa to be
listed as a ``terrorist'' state and calls the nation a ``uniquely
repressive regime.''.
   The Democratic platform also promises to set a date for U.S.
corporations to withdraw from South Africa.
   According to Bentsen's financial disclosure form, his blind
trust included investments worth between $15,000 and $50,000 in
each of the following companies, which the state says do business
in South Africa: Caterpillar Inc., Chevron, Colgate, Palmolive,
Johnson & Johnson, Minnesota & Manufacturing, Monsanto Co., Tenneco
Inc., and Unisys Corp.

<TEXT>
   A federal jury Thursday began deliberating
the fate of 20 reputed organized crime figures in what is believed
to be the nation's longest federal criminal trial.
   The jury in the 21-month-old trial faced a vast array of
materials, including more than 40,000 pages of transcripts, the
testimony of 89 witnesses and 850 exhibits.
   The 12-member panel, which retired for the night and was to
return Friday morning, made its first request within 10 minutes of
entering the jury room, seeking copies of the indictment and
transcripts of opening arguments.
   Attorneys then began arguing about what portions of the opening
arguments should be excised, only to have the jury send out another
note two hours later canceling the request.
   Meanwhile, the indictment question was resolved when it was
learned that the jury already had a copy of it _ along with a
roomful of exhibits _ but didn't know it was there.
   The jury must decide 77 separate charges, basing its
deliberations on the complex instructions it received Wednesday
from U.S. District Judge Harold A. Ackerman.
   The trial has exhausted participants and backed up the federal
courts in New Jersey.
   One prosecutor became a father twice. An attorney who had been
commuting from Florida died of cancer, touching off a dispute over
his replacement that went all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court.
One witness was on the stand for four months.
   ``My marriage began and ended during this trial,'' said defense
attorney Maria Noto. ``The attention that I chose to devote to (it)
rather than to my new husband had a great deal to do with it.''
   ``It's a monster,'' Ms. Noto said. ``It's an amorphous,
uncontrollable, confused monster.''
   Jury selection began Nov. 20, 1986, when the first of 1,200
people were screened for the panel, and opening arguments began in
March 1987.
   Since then, one defendant briefly attended court in a hospital
bed until his moaning interfered. Another passed out.
   A third, acting as his own attorney and given to telling jokes
to the jury, cross-examined his cousin _ who on the stand
apologized for once shooting the defendant five times in the head.
   The case began in August 1985 with the unsealing of a
racketeering indictment naming Anthony ``Tumac'' Accetturo of
Hollywood, Fla., who authorities say is a captain in the Lucchese
crime family, and the other defendants.
   Accetturo allegedly controlled the powerful New Jersey faction
of the family, which authorities say ran loan-sharking, illegal
gambling, drug-dealing and fraudulent credit card operations across
the state.
   The government charges the group operated out of a Newark
luncheonette called the Hole-in-the-Wall, where pictures of
legendary gangsters Al Capone, Meyer Lansky and Charles ``Lucky''
Luciano hung.
   Key witnesses, many of whom were criminals and onetime
associates of the defendants, testified about the group's reputed
mob traditions: kisses of respect and ``tribute'' payments for the
boss; ``sit downs,'' meetings held to resolve disputes; and visits
to mob hangouts by luxury-hotel manicurists to do the nails of
defendants.
   Defense attorneys said the witnesses, their imaginations fired
by movies and television shows, had manufactured the scenes.
   During a month of summations, they urged the jury to disregard
testimony from criminals, confessed liars and drug-users _ many
cooperating with the government in exchange for leniency and
financial support.
   That support, the defense says, exceeds $300,000 _ just part of
the millions of dollars invested in the case by the government.
   Court-appointed attorneys have received an estimated $3 million.
Then there are the $175,000 paid to jurors; the salaries of three
prosecutors, the FBI case agent, judge, and extra U.S. marshals for
security; and copying costs for a mountain of documents.
   U.S. Attorney Samuel A. Alito Jr., who started his job after the
trial began, says the expense is worth it, although he acknowledges
concerns about the trial's length.
   ``We will do everything we can to keep (future) trials at
reasonable lengths,'' he said.
   According to the Administrative Office of the Courts in
Washington, the trial has exceeded what previously was thought the
longest federal criminal proceeding, the ``Pizza Connection'' case,
which ended in March 1987 after 17 months. The jury convicted 18
men for participating in a heroin ring that used pizzerias as
fronts.
   Ackerman said the Newark trial has been stressful.
   ``Because of its length, I've been rationing my strength,'' he
said, calling the jury's patience ``absolutely astonishing.'' Two
jurors were dismissed and replaced by alternates early in the
trial, while a third was excused just last month after she told the
judge the trial was ``making me crazy.''
   Defense attorney Robert L. Brown has the unusual problem of
handling his client's interests as well as those of the city of
Orange, of which he was elected mayor this spring.
   ``It has caused a lot of late nights at City Hall,'' he said.

<HEAD>Jane's Says Cuba Using Lethal Chemicals Against UNITA</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Cuba is using a lethal mixture of Soviet-supplied
mustard gas and nerve gases to flush out South African-backed
Angolan rebels from their strongholds in remote areas, Jane's
Defense weekly reported Thursday.
   Prof. Aubin Heyndrickx, head of toxicology at the University of
Ghent in Belgium and a United Nations expert on biological and
chemical warfare, was quoted as saying his evidence that Cuba is
using the gasses is based on environmental samples taken from the
Angolan battle zone in April.
   Jane's Defense weekly is an authoritative publication dealing
with military matters worldwide.
   Soil, leaf and water samples showed clear traces of mustard gas
and nerve gases, Heyndrickx was quoted as saying.
   The attack must have taken place in March or April, Heyndrickx
was quoted as saying, because the nerve gases are extremely
volatile and would not remain in the environment for longer than a
few weeks.
   The professor was quoted as saying he couldn't tell exactly
which nerve gas was used, although he knows it is one of the three
neurotoxins, Soman, Tabun or Sarin.
   The report came as U.S. mediators were working on a compromise
timetable for a withdrawal of 50,000 Cuban troops from Angola at
talks in the Congo. South Africa has promised to pull out its
troops from Angola by Sept. 1 and grant independence to South-West
Africa, also known as Namibia, on condition the Cubans leave.
   Heyndrickx was quoted as saying he is convinced the Cubans are
continuing to uses gases in Angola to help win the war against
rebels of the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola
(UNITA).
   ``I'm sure the Cubans will go ahead with this. This is the new
military tactic,'' Jane's quoted him as saying.
   The UNITA rebels, backed by South Africa and the United States,
have been fighting since 1975 to force the Cuban- and Soviet-backed
Angolan government to share power. The rebel group controls large
portions of southern Angola.
   The professor was quoted as saying he has gas detection kits
captured from Cuban soldiers which are designed to measure whether
levels of poison in the atmosphere are toxic for man.
   A University of Ghent team examined patients in UNITA field
hospitals and found evidence of nerve gas attacks in 1986 and 1984,
but none of those victims showed any trace of mustard gas, he was
quoted as saying.

   Price Daniel, who served Texas for 40
years as state legislator, attorney general, U.S. senator, governor
and jurist, died Thursday at his ranch in southeast Texas. He was
77.
   George Christian, former press secretary and executive assistant
to Daniel, said Daniel suffered what was believed to be a massive
stroke at his ranch and was taken to Yettie Kersting Hospital at
Liberty, 35 miles northeast of Houston, where he was pronounced
dead on arrival.
   Longtime friends and former political foes praised Daniel's
devotion to Texas, where his varied career as a public servant
placed him alongside 19th century revolutionary hero Sam Houston.
   Daniel and Houston were the only Texans to quit the U.S. Senate
to run for governor, a position Daniel said he would rather hold
than the presidency of the United States.
   Daniel married Houston's great-great-granddaughter, Jean Baldwin
Houston, in 1940.
   Republican Gov. Bill Clements requested that Texas flags be
flown at half-staff in honor of Daniel, a Democrat.
   ``No man has done more for our state than Price Daniel,''
Clements said in a statement. ``He will be remembered as a great
patriot, a great American and, most of all, as a great Texan. I am
truly saddened.''
   Former Democratic Gov. Preston Smith said Daniel ``never, never
overlooked the problems with which the people were concerned. We're
going to miss people of his caliber. I've lost one of my best
friends.''
   Smith appointed Daniel to the Texas Supreme Court in January
1971, a job he held until his retirement in 1979.
   Daniel, elected to the U.S. Senate in 1952, served four years
before making a successful bid for governor with a close Democratic
primary victory over Ralph Yarborough.
   He served three two-year terms from 1957-63 but lost an
unprecedented bid for a fourth term in a Democratic primary race
won by John Connally.
   Christian said Daniel would be remembered for preserving for the
state the revenue from rich offshore oil fields.
   Daniel started his public career as a member of the state House
of Representatives in 1939. He became speaker in 1943 but later
waived his legislative exemption and enlisted in the Army as a
private.
   He left the service in 1946 with the rank of captain and won a
race that year for state attorney general. He won two more
uncontested terms in 1948 and 1950.
   Daniel received an undergraduate degree in journalism from
Baylor University at Waco in 1931 and a law degree from Baylor
University the following year. He worked as a reporter for the Fort
Worth Star-Telegram and the Waco News-Tribune and later was
co-owner of weekly newspapers in Liberty and Anahuac.
   In addition to his wife, Daniel is survived by three of his four
children.
   His oldest son, Price Daniel Jr., 39, was shot to death Jan. 19,
1981, during an argument with his wife, Vickie Daniel. Mrs. Daniel,
who had filed for divorce, claimed the shooting was an accident.
She was later acquitted of murder in a trial at Liberty.
   Services were scheduled for 2 p.m. Saturday at the United
Methodist Church in Liberty, with burial in the Daniel family
cemetery near his ranch.

   More than 600 activists from East and West
came together for an unofficial human rights conference Thursday,
while the government confronted workers striking to legalize
Solidarity.
   Solidarity leader Lech Walesa was scheduled to give the opening
address at the conference, one of the largest ever held in an East
bloc country. But he sent his apologies, saying he could not come
because he was holed up with other strikers at the Lenin shipyard
in Gdansk.
   ``The highest necessity forces me to stay away,'' the 1983 Nobel
Peace Prize laureate wrote to conference participants. ``I am
taking part in a strike to defend human and workers' rights.
   ``I believe that the epoch of totalitarian systems based on
violations of human rights seems to be coming to an end in this
part of the world.''
   Also at the conference Thursday, U.S. congressional staffer
Michael Hammond announced that the Congress would soon approve a $1
million grant to help Solidarity, which was outlawed by the Polish
government in 1982. Solidarity was the first independent labor
movement in the East bloc.
   Hammond, general counsel to the Senate Steering Committee, which
does research and provides support for Conservative members of the
chamber, said the United States already has provided two such
grants to Solidarity.
   He called on the Polish government to legalize the trade
federation.
   ``Any improvement in relations between the U.S. and the
government of Poland must be predicated on an improvement in the
human rights situation in Poland,'' Hammond said. ``I can tell you
with authority that this means Solidarity must be legalized.''
   The conference opened in a church in Nowa Huta, an industrial
suburb of Krakow in southern Poland, a region at the hub of the
current strikes that began 10 days ago. Nowa Huta is also home of
the sprawling Lenin steel mill, where police violently broke a
major strike in May.
   The conference was organized by Solidarity's Commission of
Intervention and Lawfulness, which monitors human rights in Poland,
and the outlawed peace group Freedom and Peace. It is scheduled to
end Saturday.
   Poland was represented at the conference by filmmaker Andrzej
Wajda, literary critic Jan-Jozef Lipski and senior Solidarity
adviser Bronislaw Geremek. Miner Adam Giera came to deliver a
message from striking miners in the city of Jastrzebie, about two
hours away.
   American guests included Jeri Laber, executive director of the
U.S. Helsinki Watch Group; and Boston Mayor Raymond Flynn.
   Conference organizers invited government officials, including
Interior Minister Gen. Czeslaw Kiszczak. But only a lower-level
official from the ministry came, and he made no statements.

<HEAD>Chilean Journalist Arrested, Others Protest Government Treatment</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Authorities on Thursday arrested a
journalist accused of slandering a military prosecutor, and other
news people stopped work for one hour to protest their treatment by
the right-wing government.
   About 60 journalists also rallied in front of the presidential
palace to protest what they describe as persecution of journalists
by the military government of President Augusto Pinochet.
   Francisco Herreros, director of the leftist weekly magazine
Cauce, was arrested Thursday, according to records filed at a
military court in Santiago. He was held on a government-filed
complaint of slandering a military prosecutor in an article
published in June.
   Radio news broadcasts were suspended during the work stoppage
from 11 a.m. to noon, and many print reporters and television
journalists also joined the protest. The protest had been planned
before the arrest.
   About 60 members of the Chilean Journalists' Association, which
called the protest, gathered in front of the presidential palace
for a brief rally. They released a letter of protest addressed to
Interior Minister Sergio Fernandez.
   ``Persecution of journalists has continued,'' the letter said.
It said 29 journalists now face criminal slander charges filed by
the government in either military or civilian courts.
   The charges stem from articles critical of Pinochet, government
officials or the armed forces.
   In a presidential referendum to be held sometime in October,
Chileans will vote ``yes'' or ``no'' on a single candidate to be
picked Tuesday by Pinochet, as commander-in-chief of the army, and
by his counterparts in the navy, air force and national police.
Pinochet himself is considered virtually certain of gaining the
nomination.

   Republican vice presidential nominee Dan
Quayle, countering suggestions that he is not mature enough to be
president, said Thursday he is qualified ``if that situation
arises.''
   As for his youth, the 41-year-old Indiana senator said, ``I'm
very close to the same age as Jack Kennedy was when he was elected
_ not vice president, but president.''
   Quayle also said he had answered questions about his military
record and that the American public is ``getting a little bit
sick'' of hearing about the issue.
   ``I've answered questions for seven days now,'' Quayle told
reporters as he arrived in Colmbia, Mo. ``We're going to talk about
the future. We're going to talk about jobs. We're going to talk
about other issues that the American people are interested in.''
   The Indiana senator scheduled a series of stops in Missouri,
ending with an appearance in Sedalia at the state fair.
   A scheduled news conference there was canceled at the last
minute along with another event because of what aides said were
time constraints. Quayle took questions from farmers at the state
fair but told them, ``I won't take any questions about the Indiana
National Guard.''
   Most of the farmers' questions centered on Medicare reform,
drought relief legislation and the newly-signed trade bill, which
Quayle opposed in the Senate debate but described Thursday as ``a
good first step to send a message that we are serious about trade.''
   Apart from the canceled news conference, Quayle allowed
reporters to question him Thursday in an apparent shift in campaign
strategy. Quayle had stayed away from the press on Wednesday so
attention would focus on his speech to a group of National
Guardsmen, said Stuart Spencer, Quayle's campaign chairman.
   Quayle was asked about remarks Wednesday by Sen. Lloyd Bentsen,
his Democratic counterpart, suggesting that Quayle was not mature
enough for a job that was a heartbeat away from the presidency.
   ``I am qualified, if that situation arises,'' Quayle said,
adding that he felt he had special expertise in national defense
and security issues.
   He told reporters in Boonville that he did not regret his vote
against establishing a Veterans Administration Cabinet post. But he
said he was ``a team player'' and would support the new Cabinet
post since Bush favored it.
   Quayle had indicated Monday to a Veterans of Foreign Wars
convention that his vote might someday be viewed as a youthful
indiscretion. But Thursday, he insisted he did not regret the vote.
   ``I still believe my vote was correct,'' he said.
   Quayle's aides insisted that the controversy over whether he
pulled strings to enter the National Guard during the Vietnam War
had faded, especially after a rousing reception from the Guardsmen
Wednesday night.
   ``We think the issue is behind us,'' he said. ``We want to keep
it behind us.''
   Spencer said Bush's pollster, Robert Teeter, was doing regional
polling to see if the American public agreed.
   Quayle was greeted in Columbia by a contingent of supporters,
although some in the crowd chanted ``Quayle's a chicken.'' Some
negative signs were sprinkled among the pro-Quayle signs, reading
``Sissy Rich Boy,'' ``Dump Quayle'' and``War Wimp.'

   Cool, wet air covered parts of the Northeast on Thursday, and a
few showers and thunderstorms hit scattered parts of the South and
Southwest.
   Hazy skies stretched from Wyoming as far away as Denver as
forest fires in Yellowstone National Park continued to spew smoke.
Visibility was poor over western Wyoming.
   Cool, unstable air over western New York State and Lake Ontario
generated showers while rain and fog covered parts of northern New
England and kept temperatures down in the 50s and low 60s.
   Afternoon temperatures were only in the 60s over the northern
Great Lakes and northeast Minnesota.
   Showers and thunderstorms were scattered over portions of
southwest Texas as well as over Florida and along the coast of the
Carolinas. Thunderstorms also were developing over the mountains in
central Arizona.
   Temperatures were in the 90s from Texas across the lower
Mississippi Valley and the Gulf Coast to Florida.
   Isolated showers also doused northwest Montana.
   Temperatures ranged from 90 to above 100 degrees in the desert
Southwest and the Great Basin. Most other regions showed readings
in the 70s and 80s.
   At 3 p.m. EDT, temperatures ranged from 54 degrees at Marquette,
Mich., to 102 degrees at Chase Field Naval Air Station, Beeville,
Texas. The early morning low was 29 degrees at Jackson, Wyo.
   Friday's forecast called for scattered showers and thunderstorms
over Florida, southern Georgia and along the North Carolina coast
in the Southeast, and over Arizona, western New Mexico, southwest
Colorado and Utah in the West. Showers and thunderstorms also were
forecast for the Black Hills of South Dakota. Showers were expected
from the northern Great Lakes to northern New England.
   Highs were predicted to be in the 70s and 80s over much of the
northern half of the nation and along the California coast, with
highs only in the 60s over Upper Michigan and northeast Minnesota.
Highs were forecast to be in the 90s over the central and southern
Plateau and New mexico, and from the southern Plains across the
lower Mississippi Valley to the Gulf Coast, Florida, the Tennessee
Valley and the southern Atlantic Coast states. Highs were expected
to be near 100 degrees from central Texas into south-central Kansas
and between 100 and 105 in the desert Southwest and the valleys of
central and southern California.

<HEAD>Two of Israel's Main Political Parties Merge Formally</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two parties forming Prime Minister Yitzhak
Shamir's rightist Likud bloc formally merged Thursday into a single
party that will take part in November general elections.
   The union was a formality because the two parties have fielded a
joint list of candidates for parliament since 1965. But some
political observers said it constituted a final victory for the
right-wing views of the Herut movement over the more moderate
Liberal Party.
   The union of Herut and the Liberal Party also put an end to any
hopes nursed by the left-leaning Labor Party that the Liberals
might bolt the Likud and form a coalition with Labor.
   Herut has 28 seats in the present parliament and the Liberals
13. The Likud and Labor share power in the current coalition
government but elections polls indicate a slight advantage for the
new party, called the Likud-National Liberal Movement, and its
right-wing allies, over the leftist parties headed by Labor.
   Before the official union, leaders of Herut and the Liberals
signed a covenant stating that Israel had an indisputable right to
all of the Land of Israel, including the occupied territories.
   Former Prime Minister Menachem Begin, who founded the Herut
movement in 1948 and was architect of the 1965 partnership with the
Liberal Party, sent a letter of congratulations to the participants.
   Three thousand Likud supporters attended the signing ceremony,
where Shamir delivered a speech attacking his Labor Party rivals.
   Shamir charged that Labor blamed Israel instead of the Arabs for
the Palestinian uprising that began last Dec. 8 and the failure to
reach a peace settlement.
   ``I thought we had gotten rid of this cursed guilt complex a
long time ago,'' Shamir said.

   A high-ranking officer received a letter
of reprimand and four other supervisory personnel were given
nonpunitive letters of caution in the death of a rescue swimmer
trainee, a Navy spokesman said Thursday.
   The information was disclosed as proceedings began in the
court-martial of Lt. Thomas A. Torchia, former officer in charge of
the Navy Rescue Swimmer School where Airman Recruit Lee Mirecki,
19, of Appleton, Wis., died March 2.
   Testimony at a June investigative hearing indicated Mirecki died
from a fear-induced heart attack or drowning. Instructors allegedly
pushed Mirecki back into a swimming pool and held his head under
water after he had panicked, climbed out and shouted that he wanted
to quit.
   Torchia's former boss, now-retired Capt. C.L. Lavinder Jr., who
headed the Navy Schools Command at Pensacola Naval Air Station at
the time of Mirecki's death there, received a letter of reprimand
for dereliction of duty from Rear Adm. David R. Morris, said Lt.
Cmdr. Dennis Hessler, a public affairs officer.
   Hessler said the letters of caution were issued to an officer
and three enlisted men with ranks of chief petty officer or above,
but their identities could not be disclosed because the punishment
didn't go on their records.
   Torchia and an enlisted instructor scheduled for trial Monday
are the only personnel facing court-martial in the case.
   Nonjudicial punishments against four enlisted rescue swimmer
instructors, including reductions in rank for two of them and
fines, were ordered by Morris on June 29 and made public then.
   The letters of reprimand and caution were not disclosed before
Thursday because no one asked, Hessler said. He was asked Thursday
after Lavinder's punishment was mentioned during a hearing on
motions to dismiss dereliction-of-duty charges against Torchia.
   Torchia, 32, of Princeton, Ill., was in his office overlooking
the pool, talking on the telephone, at the time of Mirecki's death,
witnesses have said.
   He had been offered unspecified nonjudicial punishment but
requested a court-martial so he could have an opportunity to clear
himself.
   Cmdr. Newell D. Krogmann, the military judge, denied a motion to
dismiss the second of two counts against Torchia. The motion
alleged insufficient evidence.
   The judge later Thursday heard testimony on a motion to dismiss
both counts on grounds the chief of naval education and training,
Vice Adm. N.R. Thunman, who convened the court-martial, was biased
against Torchia.
   Krogmann said he would make a decision when proceedings
reconvene Friday. The trial will begin if he denies the motion. He
has two other options: dismiss the case or remove it from Thunman
and shift it to another admiral of equal or higher responsibility
for an independent decision on whether a court-martial is warranted.
   Thunman ordered the court-martial against the advice of the
investigating officer, Cmdr. Daniel J. D'Alesio, who recommended no
disciplinary action against Torchia.
   A guilty verdict could bring Torchia up to three months'
confinement, loss of pay and a formal reprimand that could make
future advancement in the Navy extremely difficult.
   Scheduled for trial Monday is Petty Officer 2nd Class Michael W.
Combe, 26, of Tempe, Ariz. He is charged with involuntary
manslaughter, battery and conspiracy to commit battery.
   Combe is accused of holding Mirecki under the water. If
convicted he could be dishonorably discharged and sentenced to
prison for more than three years. He was denied the option of
accepting nonjudicial punishment.

<BYLINE>By RUTH RENDON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Flamboyant defense attorney Percy Foreman, who
bartered a guilty plea for the life of the man who assassinated the
Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., died Thursday at the age of 86.
   Foreman died of cardiac arrest, said Methodist Hospital
spokeswoman Brenda Koch. Family members did not wish to release
further details, she said.
   Foreman once estimated he had tried 1,500 death penalty cases,
but of his clients, only one, a restaurateur named Steve Mitchell,
was executed. Mitchell was convicted in 1952 of shooting his wife,
and Foreman, who consistently opposed the death penalty, said later
Mitchell ``deserved to die.''
   ``You can't win 'em all,'' Foreman said of the case, but later
confided he blamed himself.
   He persuaded James Earl Ray to plead guilty to the 1968 slaying
of King, the Nobel Prize-winning civil rights leader, in exchange
for a 99-year sentence. Ray charged later that Foreman pressured
him into the plea by saying the odds were 99 percent certain he
would go to the electric chair if he faced a jury in Tennessee.
   Ray contended he only purchased the rifle used in the Memphis
assassination and gave it to a man named ``Raoul.'' He charged
Foreman failed to investigate two mysterious Louisiana men who, he
contended, would have helped his case.
   But Foreman testified before a U.S. House assassinations
committee in 1978 that Ray admitted to him he faked the story of a
conspiracy and thought the killing would make ``a hero to the white
race.''
   ``His style, his technique, his manner of handling himself
before the jury had a dramatic effect on my career. Not only mine,
but many other men and women in the state who practice law,'' said
Houston's other famous attorney, Richard ``Racehorse'' Haynes, who
used to skip law school classes to watch Foreman in court.
   ``I think his loss is a major loss in the quality of law. He's
gone but will not be forgotten. I believe he will be the yardstick
from which we will judge the other lawyers,'' Haynes said.
   Foreman was born June 21, 1902, in a log cabin near the East
Texas town of Coldspring. His first job was as a shoeshine boy in
Polk County, where his father was sheriff.
   He began studying law after World War I and kept the $5 bill he
received as the fee for his first legal case _ drawing up a lease
on a five-acre orchard.
   Foreman reacted in character April 30, 1982, when a woman whose
divorce he had handled was arrested and charged with trying to hire
someone to kill him.
   ``I'm too busy to die,'' Foreman growled when asked for comment.
   He built a practice based on unswerving loyalty to clients.
``They may not always be right, but they are never wrong,'' he once
said.
   ``In a murder case, you should never allow the defendant to be
tried,'' he explained. ``Try someone else _ the husband, the lover,
the police, or if the case has social implications, society
generally. But never the defendant.''

   One person was killed and four others
were injured Thursday when a tractor-trailer carrying 8,000 gallons
of diesel fuel overturned and exploded on the Capital Beltway
during the evening rush hour, fire officials said.
   Washington area traffic was snarled as a two-mile stretch of the
Beltway, the highway that forms a loop around the District of
Columbia, was closed for four hours. Traffic in one direction on
that section of the highway remained halted later into the evening.
   The accident occurred when the truck struck a van, lost control
and rolled over the highway's center barrier, said Prince George's
County Fire Department spokesman Tony DeStefano. Sparks from the
skidding truck ignited the fuel as the fuel container broke up in
the wreck.
   The truck's 32-year-old driver was taken to Prince George's
General Hospital with burns on 18 percent of his body.
   One person, believed to be male, smashed into the wreckage in a
car and was instantly killed, DeStefano said.
   One man in the van that was struck by the truck suffered spinal
injuries and was flown to a shock trauma center in Baltimore,
DeStefano said. Two other men in the van received minor injuries.
   Names of the victims had not been released late Thursday.
   Authorities said the explosion posed no immediate danger to area
residents, and let the fire burn out by itself.
   ``It posed no hazard because the tank had already opened and was
burning,'' DeStefano said. ``The best way to dispose of the product
is to let it burn.''

   Opposition legislators on Thursday stormed
out of a session to certify a new national House of Deputies and
accused the governing party of blocking inquiries into charges of
voting fraud.
   ``We have to seek new ways (of protest), because the official
party is legitimizing fraud more and more every day,'' Alfredo
Noyola of the opposition National Action Party said.
   The opposition parties, who had left before dawn Thursday after
a nightlong debate, returned to the chamber when a new session
began Thursday afternoon, and the lengthy wrangling resumed.
   The House of Deputies is sitting in as an electoral college to
certify the deputies elected in July 6 nationwide balloting.
   Press sections were open at the new session Thursday afternoon,
but public galleries were closed because opposition sympathizers
had been chanting, whistling, and sometimes throwing coins and
other objects.
   The July 6 elections were tainted by widespread accusations that
the governing Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, won by
tampering with voter registration rolls, packing ballot boxes and
destroying ballots for opposition candidates.
   Since then, opposition leaders have accused the PRI of bullying
and steamroller tactics to speed up vote certification, especially
in the House. That chamber must also certify the presidential
election by the Dec. 1 inauguration day of President-elect Carlos
Salinas de Gortari.
   The two major opposition candidates have barnstormed the nation
urging Mexicans to reject the election results.
   After a heated nightlong debate, all 227 opposition deputies
walked out of the Congress building early Thursday, temporarily
paralyzing the 500-member electoral college. The body must finish
its work in time to seat a new House by Sept. 1.
   On that date, both the House and the Senate are to meet in joint
session to hear outgoing President Miguel de la Madrid's
state-of-the-union address.
   The Senate, sitting as a second electoral college, continued
hearings normally Thursday to certify the election for its
64-member body.
   The PRI had not lost a presidential election since it was
founded in 1929.
   But the July 6 balloting marked the first time the PRI won the
presidency with less than 70 percent of the votes cast. Returns
this time gave Salinas victory and a single six-year term by 50.36
percent of the vote.
   Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, a former PRI leader that broke away to head
the leftist National Democratic Front coalition, came in second
with 31.1 percent. Manuel J. Clouthier of the conservative National
Action Party came in third with 17 percent.
   For the first time also, the PRI lost its complete domination of
the Senate. Four opposition senators already have been certified
for their posts.
   By law, the deputies- and senators-elect sit as separate
electoral colleges to certify their own elections, and then the
500-member House sits as an electoral college to certify the
presidential election.
   Both Cardenas and Clouthier have been claiming the election was
fraudulent and accusing the government of denying the electoral
colleges access to documents from about half the 55,000 polling
stations nationwide to conceal irregularities. The de la Madrid
administration has denied the charge.
   ``The PRI members are denying us a voice and are turning down
all requests by the opposition (that fraud be investigated) in
their hurry to conclude the (House electoral college) process,''
Noyola said Thursday in a telephone interview.
   Guillermo Jimenez Morales, leader of the PRI delegates to the
House electoral college, denied the charge in a newspaper interview.
   ``In any case, the attitude adopted by the opposition shows
clearly that we are living within a democratic framework and a free
world, and each one can do what he wants with his freedom,'' he
told the newspaper Excelsior.
   The House had voted unanimously to close the public galleries
minutes before the opposition members walked out, college spokesman
Pedro Pablo Trevino said.
   ``The decision was taken because several deputies were not only
grossly insulted by sympathizers from opposition groups, but many
had coins and other objects tossed at them,'' he said.

   Too many school lunches rate a ``C'' grade
because of their high fat content, a consumer nutrition group said
Thursday, urging cafeterias to serve ``healthfully modified'' meals
such as chili atop baked potatoes instead of hot dogs.
   Ellen Haas, executive director of Public Voice for Food and
Health Policy, said her group spotted encouraging trends toward
fresh fruit and vegetables in a survey of school menus.
   But she said the main courses served in school cafeterias ``far
too often are fried foods'' and other dishes high in saturated fat.
   ``Our young children are a captive audience. We have an
opportunity here,'' Haas said. ``We've got to establish lifestyles
that have healthy eating habits.''
   The Denver-based American School Food Service Association called
the report ``shallow'' and said ``school lunch is again getting a
bad rap.''
   The $3.7 billion school lunch program, serving some 27 million
children, is run by the Agriculture Department. Surplus commodities
purchased by USDA account for 20 percent of the foods used in the
program.
   Therein lies the root of the problem, according to Public Voice,
because the commodities ``are often high in fat, sugar or sodium.''
   ``Congress has compounded the problem by bowing to the milk
producers' lobby and requiring that schools serve whole milk, with
low-fat milk optional,'' it said.
   Public Voice recommended, among other things, that USDA set
limits on the amount of fat, sodium and sugar permitted in school
lunches and distribute healthier commodities to schools.
   But Suzanne S. Harris, deputy assistant secretary of agriculture
for food and consumer services, said in a statement that ``it would
be irresponsible'' to let commodities purchased by the government,
as required by law, go unused.
   Furthermore, she said, ``the scientific community does not
support setting absolute levels for sugar, fat or sodium at this
time'' because current recommendations regarding children are
controversial.
   ``Nutrition strategies warranted for the general adult
population may actually be harmful to children, particularly
low-income children, during periods of growth and development,''
Harris said.
   Pat Bayer, executive director of the American School Food
Service Association, said the Public Voice report offers a
``shallow view of research'' that is an overreaction to calls by
the surgeon general to reduce fat intake. The association
represents 65,000 school nutritionists and school lunch directors.
   ``I think that it is patently ridiculous to blame school lunch
for obese America,'' Ms. Bayer said. ``The fact is that school
lunches are often the healthiest and most balanced meals some
children receive all day.''
   ``We just think school lunch is again getting a bad rap,'' she
said.
   However, Haas said the National Science Foundation, the National
Institutes of Health and the American Heart Association agree that
fat should not constitute more than 30 percent of a child's daily
caloric intake. And she said the average school lunch contains 39
percent fat.
   Public Voice listed several examples of traditional menus heavy
on fried chicken and fish, mashed and fried potatoes and sweet,
prepared deserts. The group compared those with ``healthfully
modified'' menus adopted by some school districts.
   For example, in Kennesaw, Ga., students got baked chicken
breasts with lemon and garlic, steamed broccoli and carrots, a
homemade whole wheat roll and fresh fruit. And in Denver, one meal
was a baked potato topped with chili, accompanied by raw broccoli
and carrots and sweet potato pie.
   ``We hear complaints that students won't eat this stuff,'' Haas
said. ``We just don't buy that.''
   Some school districts won praise for serving lowfat milk and
homemade lowfat salad dressings, buying the ingredients themselves
to substitute for higher-fat commodities from USDA.
   Haas urged the department to help keep nutritious meals
affordable by adapting the commodities program to more closely meet
USDA's own 1980 dietary guidelines. For example, she said, it could
offer schools whole potatoes and plain chicken rather than potato
rounds and breaded chicken ready for frying.
   Public Voice also recommended that:
   _USDA establish a national food service management institute to
train and help school systems serve higher-quality lunches. Harris
replied that the department has authorized $50,000 to study the
feasibility of setting up such a program in Mississippi. A report
to Congress is due this fall.
   _The department reinstitute a ban on the sale of snack foods on
school grounds. Sales now are banned only in cafeterias or during
meal periods. Harris, citing court cases, said Congress would have
to pass a specific law if more stringent federal controls are
desired.

<HEAD>Memorial Garden for Dorothy Parker Designed to Improve
Black-Jewish Ties</HEAD>

   The ashes of celebrated writer and wit Dorothy
Parker will be interred in a memorial garden at NAACP headquarters
in a gesture of friendship between blacks and Jews, the director of
the civil rights organization said Thursday.
   The dedication of the garden on Sept. 16 will put an end to the
homelessness of Parker's ashes, which have resided for years in a
New York office file cabinet.
   Parker, who was Jewish, was an outspoken civil libertarian. When
she died in 1967, she left her estate to the Rev. Martin Luther
King Jr., and, on his death, to the National Association for the
Advancement of Colored People.
   ``In celebrating Ms. Parker, we proudly celebrate our
relationship with the Jewish community, reaffirming and renewing
our commitment to work hand in hand to erase the stain of all forms
of racial, religious, sexual and ethnic injustice and intolerance
from our society,'' said Benjamin Hooks, executive director of the
NAACP.
   Rabbi Murray Saltzman of the Baltimore Hebrew Congregation
called the memorial ``a testament of good will toward Dorothy
Parker, and, through her, to the Jewish community.''
   Hooks offered to have the ashes buried at the organization's
national headquarters after learning this spring they were being
kept in lawyer Paul O'Dwyer's office.
   Hooks said most people know little more about Parker than her
oft-repeated quip, ``Men seldom make passes at girls who wear
glasses.''
   ``There was much more to Ms. Parker than those sparse and not
totally accurate two lines _ her short stories, her reviews, her
essays, her plays, her movie scripts and her conversational gems,''
Hooks said.
   ``One of my favorites was her reported remark when one of her
archrivals was described as her own worst enemy. `Not while I'm
around,' Ms. Parker retorted. They don't make them like that
anymore.''
   The memorial garden will be located in a tiny grove of towering
white pine trees behind the chapel of a former monastery now
occupied by the NAACP. Its centerpiece will be a plaque on the
ground surrounded by a circle of brown brick. Plans call for
leaving a natural floor of soft pine needles.
   The circle represents the Round Table at New York's Algonquin
Hotel, legendary for the gab sessions held there by Parker and a
collection of the best-known literary figures of her time, said
Harry Robinson, dean of the Howard University School of
Architecture and Planning.
   The architecture school provided the design and a minority-owned
construction company will do the work, Robinson said. Hooks said he
did not know how much the project would cost.
   The evening before the garden's dedication, a one-woman show
about Parker's life, written by and starring Laurel Ollstein, will
premiere at the Arena Playhouse in Baltimore. The play is titled,
``Hope, Laughter and a Sock in the Eye.''

<HEAD>Bentsen Booed by VFW While Defending Dukakis</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Adds six grafs to UPDATE with Tennessee appearances.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By STEVEN KOMAROW</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Democratic vice presidential candidate Lloyd
Bentsen, a decorated World War II bomber pilot, was booed by
veterans on Thursday when he said Michael Dukakis and the Democrats
could be trusted with the nation's defense.
   ``The simple truth is this: Gov. Dukakis is a veteran, a
patriot, and an advocate of American strength and steadiness,''
Bentsen told the Veterans of Foreign Wars convention in Chicago.
``He can be trusted as a defender of American security _ and as a
champion of American values.''
   While President Reagan has been a strong advocate for the
military, he ``has purchased military strength at the expense of
national solvency,'' Bentsen said, warning of the threat of the
huge national budget and trade deficits.
   Bentsen himself was warmly received by the crowd and got a
standing ovation. But in trying to make the case for Dukakis on
defense, he was interrupted four times by boos or jeers _ once when
he mentioned former President Carter's name.
   At one point, when Bentsen talked about Dukakis ``bringing
fiscal responsibility and management competence to our national
defense programs,'' the VFW's national commander, Earl L. Stock
Jr., had to stand and quiet the crowd. Bentsen then asked for the
``courtesy to debate,'' and received applause.
   The booing of Dukakis appeared to be led by the Massachusetts
delegation to the convention.
   Jim Reynolds of Florida, a retired veteran who said he was once
the Democratic chairman in Saugus, Mass., said Dukakis was
``anti-veteran'' and had appointed a non-veteran to head the state
soldier's home.
   The Dukakis campaign staff brought out John Halachi, the state
commissioner of veterans affairs, to respond to the event and gave
reporters papers on the governor's positions on veterans issues.
   Halachi, a Vietnam veteran, said the Massachusetts delegation
included a vice chairman of Veterans for Bush. He said the
criticisms of Dukakis were untrue, and that former Gov. Edward King
had appointed the non-veteran.
   Bentsen told reporters he had been prepared for some flak.
   ``I had a tough assignment and I fulfilled it. And I think I
really gave them something to think about,'' he said. ``Obviously,
some of them didn't want to hear it.''
   Bentsen, in his speech, said the Republicans were circulating
``scurrilous charges.'' Bush and Quayle spoke before the VFW
convention on Monday.
   ``At times, I'm afraid, our Republican friends have behaved as
if the flag were a partisan and not a personal virtue,'' he said.
   He received applause when he asserted: ``My friends, if I
believe that there was a thread of truth in that garish tapestry of
partisan blame, I would not have joined Mike Dukakis on the
Democratic ticket.''
   Bentsen wore his American Legion cap as he delivered the address.
   ``I have been in the crosshairs of the enemies of freedom,''
said the 67-year-old former bomber pilot. ``I have been there. And
I yield to no person or party in my passion for freedom.''
   Bentsen cited Dukakis' emphasis on improving non-nuclear
weapons, maintaining a nuclear deterrent, and support of the
Stealth bomber, the cruise missile and a new submarine-launched
missile.
   While praising his running mate, Bentsen blasted both Vice
President George Bush and Sen. Dan Quayle, R-Ind., for supporting
cuts in veterans health care programs.
   ``Each time the Reagan-Bush administration proposed cuts, the
Democrats fought them off,'' he said.
   From Chicago, Bentsen went to an event to honor veterans at the
Gibson County fair in northwest Tennessee, among them about 20
World War I veterans about the age of Bentsen's father, a flier in
the Great War.
   In a talk there, Bentsen said Reagan rejected a military
spending bill because of partisan politics.
   ``The reason he vetoed it was because George Bush came in with
his pollsters and said they wanted to be able to charge the
Democrats with weakness on defense,'' said Bentsen.
   Some of the participants were angry with Bentsen's appearance.
   ``I took my vacation to help my daddy do this,'' said Leanne
Hutchison. ``We were told no politicians would be here, that this
wouldn't be a political thing.''
   ``This has turned into a political party,'' said Brenda Davis as
she helped prepare the military staple ``SOS'' _ creamed chipped
beef on toast.

<HEAD>Challenger Center `Mission Site' Opens in Houston</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   More than two and a half years after the
Challenger exploded, relatives of the crew turned the astronauts'
dream of teaching children about space into reality Thursday with
the opening of the first Challenger Center.
   The center at Houston's Museum of Natural Science, paid for with
a $150,000 private grant, will give students an opportunity to make
a simulated space flight complete with a mission control center and
scientific experiments.
   ``We knew we couldn't launch a satellite. Discovery will do that
for us, but we could continue scientific and education objectives
of that mission,'' said June Scobee, widow of Challenger commander
Dick Scobee and chairman of the board of the Challenger Center.
   ``The Challenger Center mission began with the Challenger crew.
The idea to continue it was a mission by the families,'' she said,
accompanied at the opening by relatives of other crew members.
   ``This is a milestone event,'' said David J. Barram, vice
president of corporate affairs for Apple Computer Inc., which
donated computers to the center. ``The center and its educational
innovations are giant steps down new pathways to knowledge for our
children _ and for us.''
   Mrs. Scobee and the other Challenger relatives conceived the
center as a memorial to the deceased crew and their educational
mission. The Challenger carried Christa McAuliffe, a Concord, N.H.,
high school teacher who was to have conducted the first classroom
experiments from space.
   The Houston center is expected to serve as a model for dozens of
similar centers, or Mission Sites, planned for science museums
throughout the country.
   The planned hub of the network will be the Challenger Center
Space-Life Station, a $15 million facility to be built in
Washington.
   Throughout the summer, 580 Houston-area students have been
training at the Houston Mission Site, which can accommodate 30
students at a time.
   ``It's confusing. It's very complicated to memorize
everything,'' said 10-year-old Lindsay Kemp, who sat in as captain
of mission control during Thursday's simulated flight somewhere
between Earth and Mars. ``But I'm very interested in space and am
learning things.''
   The flight simulator is named ``2061 Simulator'' and is designed
to give children the impression they are on a mission in that year.
   Kerry Joels, director of educational facilities for Challenger
Center, said that year is significant because it will mark the
100th anniversary of spaceflight, the 75th anniversary of the
Challenger, and the next visit to Earth's solar system of Halley's
Comet.
   Museums in 31 cities and five foreign countries have expressed
interest in participating in the program, with Boston; Atlanta;
Charlotte, N.C.; Chicago; St. Louis; Alamagordo, N.M.; Seattle,
Portland, Ore.; and San Diego already taking part in planning
sessions, Challenger Center officials said.

<HEAD>Meeting Generated Goodwill, But Huge Gap Remains</HEAD>

   President George Vassiliou of Cyprus said Thursday
that his first meeting ever with Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf
Denktash generated goodwill, ``but there is still a huge gap
between our positions.''
   ``We did not make an effort to narrow or to widen this gap. What
we concetrated on was to get to know each other and agree on the
procedure for future intensive negotiations,'' he told The
Associated Press in an interview.
   ``The fact that we did agree on the procedure so quickly is a
good omen.'' Later, an anonymous bomb threat delayed Vassiliou's
return to Cyprus, but a search of the Olympic Airways Boeing 737
proved the call to be a hoax, said the commander of the Geneva
airport security force, Maj. Roland Troyon.
   U.N. Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar invited Vassiliou
and Denktash to Geneva in an effort to break the nearly 3-year-old
deadlock in negotiations for the reunification of the east
Mediterranean island.
   In Ankara, an announcement by the Foreign Ministry expressed
Turkey's pleasure that the two Cypriot leaders decided to start
intercommunal negotiations to seek a settlement.
   Cyprus has been unofficially partitioned since a Turkish
invasion in 1974 following an Athens-backed coup by supporters of
union with Greece.
   The U.N. chief said Wednesday that after conferring with him,
the two men agreed to embark on intensive negotiations in the
island's capital, Nicosia, on Sept. 15. They will meet him again in
New York about six weeks later to review any progress achieved.
   Vassiliou was elected president last February as a non-party
independent candidate with support from both the left and right.
   Four previous top-level meetings since the Turkish invasion,
between Denktash and then-President Spyros Kyprianou and
Kyprianou's predecessor, the late Archbishop Makarios, all failed
to achieve progress.
   The two sides have agreed on a settlement based on establishing
a bizonal federation to reunify the island and dissolve the
breakaway Turkish Cypriot state established in north Cyprus in Nov.
1983 and recognized only by Turkey.
   They disagree over constitutional arrangements and the
implementation of U.N. resolutions on Cyprus ignored by Turkey.
   These demand withdrawal of the estimated 30,000 Turkish
occupation troops and 50,000 settlers from Turkey brought to north
Cyprus, and the return of 200,000 expelled Greek Cypriot refugees
to their homes there.
   Denktash reiterated in Geneva his rejection of the troop
withdrawal before the dissolution of the internationally recognized
Cyprus government and the establishment of a joint Greek and
Turkish-Cypriot interim administration.
   But Denktash indicated there were better prospects of a
settlement in talks with Vassiliou, who has stated repeatedly he
wants to settle the problem before the end of his first year in
office.
   ``This is the sort of man I wanted, and I found him. He is the
type I can negotiate seriously with,'' Denktash said.

<TEXT>
   They boogied and stomped their way into the
nation's living rooms in the 1950s when American Bandstand was
filmed in Philadelphia. Now they're back in the city where it
began, rehearsing for a reunion.
   For the first time in 30 years, 27 of the original Bandstand
dancers, including Kenny, Arlene, Carole, Flossie and Jim, got
together Thursday night to rehearse their steps for a show Sept. 4
at Philadelphia's Penn's Landing.
   ``American Bandstand,'' with host Dick Clark, made its network
debut on ABC television Aug. 5, 1957.
   Bandstander Joe Fusco of south Philadelphia and Lis Braun of the
Hot Foot Agency cooked up the idea of bringing the gang together
again. They came from Philadelphia, Camden, Manhatten and Houston
to bunnyhop, gossip and reminisce.
   ``Any place there's dancing, I'll still go,'' said Fusco, who
was 15 when he joined the show.
   Fusco developed the two-hour show with Braun, contacted all the
dancers and helped with the choreography. When he's not dancing,
Fusco is a professional party organizer.
   ``You were like a big star. Girls chased ya; the guys hated
ya,'' he said.
   The show was filmed near the University of Pennsylvania, across
from the Pop Singers drugstore, where the dancers used to hang out
to meet their fans. The drugstore is no longer there, but the steps
the dancers invented are still given a whirl: the bunny hop, the
chalypso and the stroll.
   Bob Horn emceed the show from its inception in 1952 until Dick
Clark took over in 1956. Clark moved the show to California in
1964, but the show's fans still remember it as a Philadelphia
phenomenon.

   Maria DeSillers need not give up financial records
of donations for her dying son's liver transplants, a judge ruled
Thursday, dismissing contempt motions that could have landed her in
jail.
   Forcing Ms. DeSillers to give the records and items allegedly
bought with some of the $690,000 in donations to the
court-appointed curator of her son Ronnie's estate ``would tend to
incriminate her,'' said Dade County Probate Judge Francis Christie.
   ``I'm very happy,'' said Ms. DeSillers, who while awaiting the
ruling gave her age as ``33, the same as Christ when he was
crucified.''
   During the two-day contempt hearing, her attorney, Roy Black,
argued that Ms. DeSillers had a Fifth Amendment right against
self-incrimination because prosecutors in Dade and Broward counties
are investigating her for possible criminal violations.
   Lawyers for curator Karen Gievers had no immediate comment on
the ruling, but later received an emergency hearing Friday before
Christie on their request to seize disputed properties and to
strike Ms. DeSillers' $150,000 claim on her son's estate, said
another of Ms. DeSillers' lawyers, Frank Johnson.
   Ms. DeSillers received massive publicity last year after the
theft of $4,000 that her 7-year-old son's classmates had raised for
the boy's liver transplant.
   Donations poured in, including $1,000 from President Reagan and
$200,000 from Miami Beach industrialist Victor Posner. Ronnie died
in April 1987 while awaiting a fourth transplant at Children's
Hospital in Pittsburgh.
   Ms. DeSillers' handling of the money came under question when
the hospital sued for the $262,000 balance of the boy's bill. She
refuses to pay, claiming Ronnie received improper care, a charge
the hospital vehemently denies.
   Shortly before the ruling Thursday, Ms. DeSillers' former
fiance, Jose Castillo, was handcuffed and whisked away as he
stepped out of the courtroom where he been accompanying Ms.
DeSillers.
   Metro-Dade Detective Barry Garafola said Castillo pawned two IBM
computers, monitors and printers worth $4,000. One of the computer
sets had been stolen in March, and the other has not been traced,
the detective said.
   As he was led away, Castillo called the charge ``ridiculous.''
His bail was set at $1,000 per count on a charge of grand theft and
another of dealing in stolen property.
   Detectives said they could not say if Ms. DeSillers was
involved. Ms. DeSillers was ``devastated'' by the arrest, said
Johnson.
   Ms. Gievers, a lawyer, was appointed by the court in March to
oversee Ronnie's estate after the charges arose that the money
might have been misspent by Ms. DeSillers.
   Ms. Gievers said Ms. DeSillers apparently spent some $200,000 of
donations improperly, including $13,500 for a used BMW and $11,000
for jewelry. The curator had sought the records to confirm her
findings.
   Christie froze the estate assets, which are to be used for
outstanding bills or to help other needy, sick children.He also
repeatedly ordered Ms. DeSillers to give up financial records and
to hand over purchases allegedly made with the donations.
   When she refused, Ms. Gievers sought the contempt of court
citations, punishable by fines or jail time. Christie declined to
elaborate on his brief order Thursday rejecting that request.
   Black portrayed his client as an unfairly maligned and generous
woman who handled the publicity, money and her only child's death
as best she could. He also said that some of the donations were
meant for Ms. DeSillers' personal use.
   ``I'm not saying people gave it for Maria to buy jewelry. (But)
if she bought a pickup truck for $20,000, which is what they cost
today, nobody would have criticized her,'' he told the judge.
   ``You'd think this was `Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous.' This
is not a woman who deserves to be humiliated,'' Black said.

<TEXT>
   Marilyn Quayle says the controversy over her
husband's service in the National Guard was created by bored,
biased journalists who have ``gone too far.''
   Mrs. Quayle made her comments in an interview Wednesday with
Barbara Walters for the ABC News program ``20-20,'' set to air
Friday night.
   Asked why she thought people are reacting so strongly to the
question of whether Dan Quayle pulled strings to enter the National
Guard at the height of the Vietnam War, Mrs. Quayle replied: ``I
don't think people are. I think it's a total creation of the
media.''
   Mrs. Quayle said it had ``crossed her mind'' that journalists
are out to get the Republican vice-presidential nominee.
   ``I can't substantiate that,'' she said. ``I think part of it is
just the fact that there were so many members of the media down in
New Orleans with nothing to do. And they decided they would find a
story. And they looked wherever they thought they could and dug
something up.''
   She said the race is ``extraordinarily important to our
country.''
   ``And when you deal in rumors and innuendo instead of dealing
with the issues that are important to the continuation of the
success of our country, not only is that an insult to every voter
in this nation, but it's not fair to the voters,'' she said.
``They've (the media) gone too far.''
   Mrs. Quayle said her husband may attract more scrutiny from some
members of the media because of his conservative views.
   ``I just have the feeling that there is in a great deal of the
media a bias not only towards Republicans, but especially towards
conservative Republicans,'' she said. ``And it's come out many
times over, it's something we deal with all the time.''

<HEAD>Suriname, France Sign Agreement to Repatriate 10,000 Refugees</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PARAMARIBO, Suriname (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   France and Suriname signed an accord
Thursday paving the way for voluntary repatriation of about 10,000
Surinamese refugees who fled into French Guiana to escape fighting
between rebels and the army.
   ``This is a significant step to solve this grave human suffering
and is cause to be hopeful,'' said Gaston Le Paudert, the French
charge d'affaires in Paramaribo.
   France has pledged to help pay the cost of repatriation.
   The agreement did not specify how or when the refugees will be
repatriated. It said, however, that as a first step the refugees
will receive special identification cards.
   Also signing the pact were the U.N. High Commissioner for
Refugees, George Gordon-Lennox, who drafted the text, and
Suriname's foreign affairs minister, Edwin Sedoc.
   ``For the voluntary return of the refugees it is necessary that
peace return in the eastern part of Suriname,'' Le Paudert said.
   Rebel leader Ronny Brunswijk has led a guerrilla war since 1986
against the army in Suriname, a former Dutch colony in northeast
South America. Brunswijk refused to stop the insurgency in the tiny
country despite the election last November of civilian President
Ramsewak Shankar, who replaced junta leader and present army
commander Desi Bouterse.
   Under the accord, the refugees must return voluntarily and
France, which now pays about $1.5 million a month to house and feed
them, cannot evict the refugees from French Guiana.
   The refugees have said they will not go home until they have
guarantees the fighting will stop.
   Meanwhile, 14 barefoot gold miners in a dug-out canoe arrived
Thursday in a small village in Brokopondo province in central
Suriname, and said nine rebels with machine guns had attacked their
isolated camp two days earlier.
   They said the guerrillas beat them and stole all their
valuables. The miners said the rebels took the small amount of gold
they had, loading it onto two boats owned by the mine, and made off
with their shoes, a refrigerator, cooking utensils and shotguns.
   The 14 men reached the village after paddling two days down
Sarakreek River in a large canoe given to them by the rebels, who
told them their mining camp was operated by Bouterse and ordered
them to abandon it.

<HEAD>Bush: Deployment Decision Depends on More Research</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A decision on whether to deploy a full or
partial Star Wars defense system must await more research into its
capabilities and costs, Republican George Bush said in a published
interview.
   ``We don't know yet, which system is going to be the most
effective, so my view is full funding of the research and then make
the deployment decision when you have all the cards on the table,''
Bush said in an interview published in Friday's editions of The New
York Times.
   The vice president, in an apparent softening of earlier promises
to deploy the Strategic Defense Initiative ``as soon as feasible,''
indicated that cost would be a factor in determining whether to
deploy it. President Reagan has advanced SDI _ an anti-missile
system using new, space-based technologies _ as a shield against
nuclear missiles which could make those weapons obsolete.
   ``I don't think we yet know what the price tag will be,'' Bush
said. ``If you went to a full deployment of a full strategic
defense, it would be very expensive. What I want to do is to
continue reserach at the levels of funding, essentially, that we
have requested.''
   The Reagan administration has asked for more than $4 billion for
SDI research this year.
   Bush also said that he recently has become interested in the
concept of a limited system _ ``not a full shield, but a partial
deployment.''
   ``If I can get convinced by the experts that that would be a
guardian, a safeguard against a weapon accidentally fired, or
weapons in the hands of some terrorist state, then I'd be
interested in this partial deployment,'' he said.
   ``At this juncture I am not prepared to endorse it, but I'm not
prepared to totally reject it,'' Bush added.
   The Times said the interview was conducted as Bush flew to
Houston after a rally in Los Angeles on Wednesday.
   In Bush's speech accepting the Republican nomination for
president last week, he said he would ``continue our policy of
peace through strength,'' and added: ``I will modernize and
preserve our technological edge and that includes strategic
defense.''
   A passage in the Republican Party platform reads, ``We are
committed to rapid and certain deployment of SDI as technologies
permit....''

months, but some diplomats believe the peace process could drag on
for years.
   Perez de Cuellar planned separate meetings with the foreign
ministers of Iran and Iraq before direct talks begin later today on
forging a lasting peace after eight years of war that claimed
nearly a million lives.
   Arriving in Geneva today, Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati of

   Riot police crushed strikes at two
southern coal mines and beat some men after dragging them from the
mines, activists said today. Witnesses said strikers at a third
colliery escaped underground.
   Despite the police raids in this coal-rich region where miners
nine days ago began Poland's most serious strike wave since 1981,
activists said strikes continued in the Baltic ports of Szczecin
and Gdansk.
   The Borynia mine in Jastrzebie and the Morcinek mine in nearby
Koszyce were completely cleared of strikers during the night,
according to workers from each of the mines.
   About 40 miners at the Moszczenica mine managed to elude police
during the raids and descended into the shaft with bread and
lanterns, witnesses said.

duty in Vietnam.
   ``I was not seeking special treatment. I wasn't looking for

   The long arm of the Environmental Protection
Agency is reaching out to the local town dump _ and the huge
metropolitan landfill as well.
   EPA, in its first major effort to regulate the land disposal of
household trash and garbage, is proposing rules that officials say
would force nearly every municipal dump to take steps to protect
the environment.
   Announced Wednesday, the plan would require all of the nation's
municipal solid waste landfills to install often-expensive
monitoring equipment to detect pollution of groundwater supplies.
   The proposal, not expected to be popular with local governments,
would require the cleaning up of dumps found to be leaking
contaminants into underground aquifers.

   Sports agents backed by a reputed mobster lured
college athletes with lucrative bonuses, then threatened them with
violence if they refused to sign contracts, according to an
indictment of three agents and a pro football player.
   The long-simmering scandal tainting college athletics boiled
over Wednesday with the indictment of New York-based agents Norby
Walters, 58, and Lloyd Bloom, 29, on charges of racketeering, mail
fraud, wire fraud and extortion.
   They are accused of using money, gifts and threats to enlist
dozens of players into signed _ in some cases postdated _
agreements allowing the agents to represent them in professional
contract negotiations.
   If the players tried to back out of the deals, they were warned
that Walters and Bloom had friends who would visit them and break
their legs, said U.S. Attorney Anton R. Valukas.

<HEAD>Kennebunkport Residents Wary of Bush Presidency Impact</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEPHEN COSTELLO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>KENNEBUNKPORT, Maine (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In this staunchly Republican town
that Vice President George Bush calls his summer home, bumper
stickers are urging residents to ``Save Kennebunkport, Vote
Democratic '88.''
   While Bush is enjoying a surge in popularity in post-GOP
convention polls, the stickers appearing on dozens of cars and
trucks in this coastal resort community reflect the oft-heard
grumbling that Bush's presidential candidacy is ruining the tourist
trade _ and the town.
   ``A Bush presidency would make this place so busy it would be
unbearable,'' says resident Jason Wentworth. ``Already it's full of
people streaming in to see his house.''
   Wentworth, a member of the York County Democratic Party, has
printed and sold more than 750 of the anti-Bush bumper stickers in
the past couple of months.
   He says they are intended to help save Kennebunkport from the
tourist traffic chaos threatened by a Bush presidency as much as
they are meant to be a political statement.
   When Bush effectively clinched the GOP nomination with primary
victories last March, the 2,900 year-round residents looked forward
to a busy summer tourist season because of Bush's occasional
presence here.
   The crowds, indeed, are big. But they don't stay, and they
hardly spend any money.
   Instead, many of the tourists visit for only an hour or two,
driving past the Bush estate on picturesque Walker's Point,
stopping to snap a photo and then motoring back to Interstate 95.
   ``A lot of people come up to see where he lives,'' says Mary
Drake, owner of a downtown gift shop. ``They don't come to shop.''
   Nearly every hotel, inn and guesthouse in Kennebunkport has
vacancies. Stores report declining sales, and many businesses say
fewer tourist dollars are being spent than in any year in recent
memory.
   Ask how business has been this summer, and the usual response
is, ``Don't ask,'' or ``It's so, so slow.'' Hopes for a profitable
season have been cast aside like undersized lobsters, which are
this town's other big money-maker.
   ``It's been really, really slow compared to the last couple of
years,'' said Julie Brown as she surveyed the empty Strudel Shop
restaurant.
   ``When he (Bush) is in town, for a couple days it's real busy,
but then it slows down,'' she said.
   Matthew Treadwell, who works at the Indian Whale Watch, a tour
boat company less than two miles from Bush's home, says there've
been only two sold-out cruises so far this summer, even with
excellent weather and numerous whale sightings. Last year at this
time, the figure was 20.
   At Mabel's Lobster Claw Restaurant, where Bush frequently dines
when he is visiting, Mabel Hanson bemoans the slow season but is
reluctant to blame the vice president.
   ``I don't think it has anything to do with Mr. Bush, but we're
having a terrible summer,'' she says.
   Why? ``Everybody's got their own opinion,'' says Susan Savell,
executive director of the Kennebunk-Kennebunkport Chamber of
Commerce. Some say it's a sign of bad economic times. Others say
it's been too hot, too cold, too rainy.
   But privately, many locals complain that Bush's presence has
scared away tourists who fear nightmarish crowds and traffic jams.
   ``People are afraid to come up, but it's not like that at all.
It's just dead,'' said Gerda Towne, owner of two downtown stores.
   Bush's seaside compound, situated at the end of a rocky
peninsula in southern Maine, has become the major tourist
attraction in town.
   Traffic is nearly always heavy near his home. Motorists park
next to no-parking signs lining the twisting, two-lane road, and
clamber onto the shore to take pictures.
   Kennebunkport Police Lt. Robert Sullivan confirms that traffic
has been heavier around the Bush estate this summer, but he says
traffic became a serious problem about a decade ago. He wouldn't
blame Bush for that.
   Wentworth says many Republicans have bought his anti-Bush bumper
stickers to show their concern for the future of Kennebunkport in
the event of a Bush presidency.
   ``The town was never meant to handle the kind of traffic that's
already coming in,'' Wentworth said, ``I feel that much of that is
due to him, and he's not even president yet.''

<HEAD>ABC Documentary Examines Crisis in Foster Care</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KATHRYN BAKER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Kathy, a teen-ager who feels unloved and
unwanted after growing up in a series of foster homes, sums up the
circular problem of foster care more succinctly than an army of
experts:
   ``I would tell the people that want to put their kids in foster
care that they shouldn't do it, because they shouldn't have brung
their kids into the world if they can't take care of 'em.''
   As described in ABC's documentary ``Crimes Against Children:
Failure of Foster Care,'' airing Tuesday, an overburdened
bureaucracy is forced to make extremely delicate choices: try to
keep the family together and risk further neglect, abuse, even the
ultimate horror of a child's death? Or break up the family and
consign the child to a life of shuffling among foster homes, where
abuse is not unknown?
   ABC previously examined the issue of foster care in 1979's
``Nobody's Children.'' Since then, reports of child abuse have
skyrocketed, and there are more unwed mothers and poverty-stricken
families putting even more pressure on the system.
   The documentary uses praiseworthy restraint; the stories of
abused children, wrecked families and frustrated social workers
need no embellishment. The reporter is Rebecca Chase. Av Westin is
executive producer, Ray Nunn senior producer.
   Take the story of Jesse, a neglected Houston infant who was
placed in a loving foster home but returned to his mother and her
new husband _ an alcoholic with a history of child abuse _ after
they underwent counseling.
   Not long afterwards, before a social worker could get the
obviously battered 2-year-old out of the home, he was admitted to
the hospital in a coma. Jesse's former foster mother, Sharon
Wilkens, recalled visiting him at the hospital in hopes he could
hear her. ``We told him that we loved him, and that he hadn't done
anything wrong, and that we were very sorry, we thought his new
parents were going to be able to love him too, and that Jesus would
be waiting to meet him.''
   Jesse never came out of the coma.
   On the other side are families torn asunder by hard times and
put back together only after years of struggling through red tape.
   Bright, articulate 12-year-old Boyd was not abused. His mother
voluntarily gave up her children when she was hospitalized and
couldn't care for them.
   ``My worst fear is never seeing my mother again,'' Boyd says.
``The foster care people are trying to tell my mother that she's
not good enough right now. She's good enough for me anytime.''
   It took five years for Boyd's mother to get her children back.
Boyd, accompanied by his mother, testified before a congressional
committee investigating foster care.
   Some foster parents seriously abuse the children they are
supposed to care for. One Chicago child was tortured to death by
her foster parents after her case was lost in a bureaucratic maze
and the couple moved her illegally to North Carolina.
   There are also stories of social workers strapped by lack of
resources. Jackie Gillard of Chicago must enter dangerous
neighborhoods trying to track down many of the dozens of families
she oversees, 90 percent of whom do not have telephones. She
complains that her agency gets attention only when one of its
failures makes the news.
   The documentary concludes with more uplifting stories, most of
them based on successful local programs _ educating foster parents,
keeping families together in times of trouble and helping grown
foster children adjust to life on their own.
   Most documentaries on social problems end with calls for more
money. And obviously, money for more workers to ease caseloads
would help enormously. But this is one problem that only human
caring will eventually solve.
   As Chase concludes, ``The need for community involvement has
never been greater. The system desperately needs more foster
parents, adoptive parents, court advocates and just friends. How
else are we going to put real caring into foster care?''

   `EXILES' IN PRODUCTION _ Academy Award-winning filmmaker Richard
Kaplan is making a two-hour documentary for PBS this season. ``The
Exiles'' will tell the story of European artists, scholars and
intellectuals who emigrated to the United States shortly before the
outbreak of World War II to escape fascism. Kaplan says the stories
told by the immigrants were so compelling, he lets them tell their
tales and dropped the narration. Kaplan won an Oscar for best
feature documentary for ``The Eleanor Roosevelt Story.'' ``The
Exiles'' will air sometime in the spring of 1989.

<HEAD>Surge Expected in Farm Bankruptcies</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP Extra</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL C. BUELOW</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MADISON, Wis. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bankruptcy court officials predict the
drought will force hundreds of Midwestern farmers who might
otherwise have survived financially to abandon their fields after
the coming harvest.
   After a sharp drop in bankruptcy cases in the first half of
1988, courts throughout the Farm Belt expect a surge in bankruptcy
petition filings in the next six months, even with help from the
huge federal drought assistance bill, according to officials in
Iowa, South Dakota and Wisconsin.
   ``The figures looked so promising, but with what's happened this
summer we're not going to bump along with this low figure,'' said
Ann Manley, chief clerk of the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Madison.
   Michael Duff, an assistant to the U.S. Department of
Agriculture's assistant secretary for economics, said farm
bankruptcies linked to the drought would increase nationwide later
this year, stunting an economic upturn in the farm economy that
began in late 1987.
   ``Last year debts were actually less than receipts and land
values stabilized. But historically, anytime you have a drought the
numbers go up and down,'' Duff said. ``There were probably a number
of farmers on the line, having a make-or-break-you year and they
probably will go bankrupt or quit.
   ``We don't have any way of knowing how many, but it will be a
national kind of problem,'' Duff said.
   The Madison court, which handles bankruptcy petitions involving
individuals, businesses and farms for 44 of Wisconsin 72 counties,
received 154 petitions from farmers the first seven months of the
year. That compared with 293 for the same period last year.
   Since 1985, farm bankruptcies have made up 13 percent to 16
percent of total cases in the Madison district. There were 420 in
1985, 511 in 1986 and 448 last year.
   ``I'll predict filings will more than double by the end of the
year,'' Ms. Manley said. ``We'll be around 400 again.''
   Barbara Everly, chief clerk of the U.S. Bankruptcy court in
Cedar Rapids, Iowa, said she expected a 20 percent increase in
bankruptcies this winter.
   ``You're not only talking about farms, but it may be the final
blow for implement dealers and service stations and the convenience
stores in those small farm communities that have been on the
edge,'' said Everly.
   As in Wisconsin, Everly said farm bankruptcies in Iowa so far
this year have fallen well below previous levels. She said climbing
land values in the state and an improving farm economy had eased
financial woes.
   But now, with crops stunted or wiped out and many farmers still
owing the costs of seed and fertilizer, ``I expect that lenders are
getting terribly, terribly jumpy,'' she said.
   Ed Jesse, a University of Wisconsin agriculture economist,
called the drought ``a major setback'' to an agriculture economy
that began improving late last year.
   ``A lot of them are just going to have to call it quits,'' Jesse
said.
   In South Dakota, farm bankruptcies were down by almost 78
percent the first seven months of the year.
   Pat Naylor, deputy clerk for the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Sioux
Falls, S.D., said 61 farm petitions had been filed through July,
compared to 311 for the same period a year ago.
   South Dakota was among the early states hardest hit by the
drought.
   However, Judge Irvin Hoyt of the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in
Pierre, S.D., said the number of farm bankruptcies would depend on
the eligibility and timing of federal drought aid to farmers.
   President Reagan signed the $3.9 billion drought assistance bill
Aug. 11, and the government hopes to begin taking applications by
Oct. 1. Under the law, aid to farmers who lose more than 35 percent
of their expected harvest will cover 65 percent of that lost
income. For farmers who suffer crop losses of more than 75 percent,
the aid would equal 90 percent of the lost income.
   ``Until we know exactly ... when (aid) will be available,
particularly for those in bankruptcy who must modify their plans,
we won't know what's going to happen with filings,'' Hoyt said.
   Farmers generally file Chapter 11 petitions, which grant
protection from creditors and create a plan for debt payment, or
Chapter 12 petitions, which were created in 1986 in the Family Farm
Act.
   Chapter 12 petitions generally resemble Chapter 11 petitions,
but proponents say they give the debtor stronger control over the
payment schedule and use a trustee, generally an attorney, to
administer it.
   Chapter 11 and 12 debt payment plans can be modified to fit
unexpected economic troubles and even allow payments to be
temporarily suspended. But the huge financial losses anticipated in
the drought may require payments to be reduced or suspended for so
long that creditors might urge liquidation, said Mark Bromley, a
Lancaster attorney who handles farm bankruptcies.
   Creditors ``would have a strong argument that the (normal
bankruptcy) plan simply won't work,'' Bromley said.
   ``My greatest concern would be for the people already in
bankruptcy. In some cases, payment plans may have to be modified to
drastically reduce or suspend payments for a year,'' Bromley said.
   Bromley and Hoyt also said that next spring's operational costs
for feed, fertilizer and other items may be too high for some under
present plans and reduced income.
   ``Buying at higher costs will throw those plans and cash flows
back into court for modifications,'' Bromley said.
   Bromley said he's had relatively few consultations with farmers
about financial problems this summer.
   ``I think the reason is it's so hard out there, so beyond the
experience of most farmers, that they want to wait and see where
things fall,'' he said.

<HEAD>USDA Researcher Says Rural Population Decline May Be Easing _
Again</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Census figures show that living in rural
America away from city clamor is not quite as attractive as it once
was, but Agriculture Department experts say the countryside could
beckon again when times improve.
   During the 1970s it seemed to many demographers, including
Calvin L. Beale of the USDA's Economic Research Service, that rural
living was on a roll, that people flocking from the cities were
turning the tide of decades of migration from farms and small towns.
   But the human tide weakened in the early 1980s as the economy
faltered, farmland values plummeted and rural employment suffered.
Quickly, says Beale, the ``exceptional rural and small-town growth
of the previous decade ended.''
   A study of ``metro'' and ``non-metro'' counties shows that
during the years of the population turnaround, Americans once again
began heading for the cities.
   The federal government says a metro area is one having a city of
at least 50,000 as a nucleus and adjacent communities that have a
high degree of economic and social integration with that city.
   Beale said that in the 1980-83 period, the non-metro population
increased at the rate of 0.83 percent a year, which once again
trailed the metro gain of 1.1 percent annually. Moreover, there
were 720 non-metro counties with population declines, half again as
many as in the low levels of the 1970s.
   Even so, the rural population balance looked pretty good by
comparison with the 1950s and 1960s, when huge waves of people
moved from farms and small towns to the cities.
   And then the situation worsened.
   From 1983 to 1986, despite a recovery in the national economy,
the ability of rural areas to attract or retain people rapidly
deteriorated, Beale said. The annual non-metro population increase
dropped to 0.42 percent per year, only half as high as the 1980-83
rate, while the annual metro population increase rose slightly to
1.12 percent.
   It is this science of numbers, decimals and fractions that makes
the lives of demographers exciting. And shifts in where people live
can translate into huge meanings for the nation as a whole as
economies of small towns, counties and cities gain or lose.
   Beale's analysis is in the current issue of RDP, or Rural
Development Perspectives, a periodical issued three times a year by
the department's Economic Research Service.
   In his assessment, Beale said that the very low growth of
non-metro population in the 1983-86 period was ``the most striking
feature of post-1980 trends.''
   During that time, 1,306 counties, or 55 percent of all non-metro
counties in the country, lost residents between 1983 and 1986.
   ``The average loss per county was not large, but the incidence
of loss was as widespread as when farm consolidation was at its
peak in the 1960s, when 53 percent of the non-metro counties lost
population, and in the 1950s, 54 percent,'' Beale said.
   But there are bright spots, too. Counties known as retirement
havens continue to attract new residents, not just older people but
younger workers who provide services and goods to the retired
population.
   These counties grew annually by more than 1.78 percent from 1980
to 1986, more than double the national rate, Beale said.
   Also, non-metro counties with a fourth or more of their
residents commuting to jobs in metro areas grew by 1.13 percent a
year, a bit faster than the national growth rate, although a sharp
decline from their 1.92 percent gains in the 1970s.
   ``After mid-1983, non-metro counties with any growth at all were
a rarity throughout the Great Plains, Corn Belt and central and
northern Appalachia,'' Beale said. ``In Iowa, the quintessential
farm state, 84 of 88 non-metro counties lost population from 1983
to 1986, as outmovement more than offset any excess of births over
debts.''
   Beale said lower birth rates also help prompt the population
decline in rural areas. During the 1950s and 1960s, the non-metro
birth rate was considerably higher than the more recent rate. In
the 1960s, it averaged more than 20 births per 1,000 people, with
the death rate at less than 10 per 1,000.
   In 1980-86, the rural birth rate was 15.6 per 1,000 people, a
decline of about a fourth from the 1960s, while the death rate was
about the same at 9.6 per 1,000.
   But Beale said ``the worst may be over'' for non-metro areas in
terms of economically related population declines. Farm income,
supported heavily by federal subsidies, was at an all-time high in
1987, debts have declined somewhat, exports have improved,
commodity surpluses have declined and 1988 cash income is expected
to be second only to last year's.
   ``These positive factors do not presage an increase in the farm
population, for there is no need for additional farmers,'' he said.
``But if the improved conditions are sustained, they should lead to
resumed local investment and spending, and greater retention of
population in farm counties.''

   The unassuming green building in this
city's produce district looks like a warehouse and, like a
warehouse, it's filled with row after row of boxes and cans of food.
   But Mary Garvey sees it differently.
   ``This is a laboratory,'' she says. ``We're creating a new
industry.''
   Garvey, 31, is president of Grocery Express, a company that
delivers just about anything you can find on a supermarket shelf to
people who can't or don't want to shop and who are glad to pay a
little extra for convenience.
   ``People have less and less time. And that trend is not
reversing,'' Garvey said in a recent interview.
   About 5,000 people in the city and the northern San Francisco
Peninsula save time by ordering groceries from Garvey's 7-year-old
company and having them delivered for a flat fee of $4.25. Prices
are about 15 percent higher than at large supermarkets and about
the same as at a corner grocery, Garvey said.
   Forty percent of her patrons are businesses, elderly and
homebound people, but the rest are two-income couples, professional
singles or families with young children.
   ``These are people who have no time but lots of demands on their
time,'' she said.
   Katherine Craven, a writer and homemaker, first called Grocery
Express 6{ years ago when she was pregnant and didn't want to climb
stairs to her second-floor Victorian flat with bags of groceries.
   ``For me it's been a great thing, and particularly in the winter
or if someone is sick, it's just a godsend,'' said Craven.
   Customers order from among several hundred items in Grocery
Express' catalog, a 128-page guide that includes fresh flowers,
restaurant meals and food gift baskets as well as fresh meat and
produce and canned and packaged goods.
   Each item has a number, which Grocery Express' clerks punch into
a computer, noting whether customers want their chicken boned or
bananas barely ripe. Customers also can file orders through their
home computers.
   Orders are put together in the company's 18,000-square-foot
warehouse and delivered in one of seven vans.
   Garvey, who has an economics degree from Stanford University,
learned about business from her family's company, Garvey
Industries, a Wichita, Kan.-based concern dealing in oil and gas,
grain and real estate.
   Grocery delivery, while not a new idea, has not been a very
profitable one. Over the past 15 years, other entrepreneurs have
started companies like Grocery Express but failed, Garvey said.
   Grocery Express nearly became one of those failures after an
enthusiastic beginning. Garvey was an original investor, but it was
her former husband, Michael Meagher, and friend John Coghlan who
were the real founders, she said. Garvey became more involved in
the business and took it over two years later.
   In 1984, the company's sales had leveled off at about $2
million, but the firm had yet to turn a profit. Grocery Express
raised its prices, but lost customers and even more money.
   The next year, it came close to shutting down. But Garvey, who
describes herself as eternally optimistic, was sure she could turn
the company around.
   ``I was just certain this is a business people need,'' she said.
``I looked at it from a different point of view _ long term _ and
was willing to spend the additional time and money.''
   Since 1985, Garvey has put between $1.5 million and $2 million
into the firm, reduced prices and used direct mail and radio ads to
regain former customers and win new ones.
   In 1986, sales rose to $2.3 million with a loss of $330,000, and
last year, sales increased to $2.7 million while the company's loss
shrank to $75,000.
   Garvey expects to turn a profit this year. She's also planning
to expand her delivery area and is considering opening another
warehouse.
   Of her company's future, she said, ``It's going to be
interesting to see.''

   Farmers Insurance Group Inc. of Los Angeles
and Batus Inc. have ended a bitter eight-month takeover battle,
with Farmers agreeing to be bought by the tobacco and retailing
company for $5.2 billion cash.
   The definitive agreement announced late Wedneady for a friendly
merger at $75 a share would give Louisville, Ky.-based Batus'
British parent, BAT Industries PLC, a long-sought foothold in the
U.S. financial services industry.
   Chairmen of the two companies jointly announced the merger

   The nation's automakers have reported a 13.2
percent dip in their mid-August sales of cars and trucks, but
analysts attribute much of the drop to the curtailment of buyer
incentives.
   General Motors Corp.'s share of the U.S. market slipped during
the period to 46.4 percent, down from 54.3 percent during the same
period last year, according to figures released Wednesday.
   Ford Motor Co. boosted its share from 28.6 percent to 31.6
percent, and Chrysler Corp. increased its share from 11.2 percent
during mid-August 1987 to 13.6 percent during the same period this

   The aluminum industry's bid for early labor
contract settlements have failed, as bargaining ended in
disagreement over economic issues.
   Aluminum Co. of America and Reynolds Metals Co. opened talks
Aug. 9 with the United Steelworkers of America and the Aluminum,
Brick and Glass Workers.
   About 21,000 members of the two unions will continue working
under two-year contracts that do not expire until May 1989. Since
the two sides reached an impasse in the early talks they planned to
reopen the bargaining nearer the expiration date.

   The International Monetary Fund has offered
Brazil $1.41 billion in new credits to add to the $120.2 billion
the nation is expected to owe at the end of the year.
   The Brazilian government, hard hit by inflation, may draw
installments of the loan through Feb. 28, 1990. Under the fund's
usual practice, reviews are held after each installment to decide
if the borrower has been performing as agreed and whether the next
installment can be drawn.

   Stock prices surged Wednesday, bouncing back nearly three-month
lows. The Dow Jones industrial average climbed 37.34 points to
close at 2,026.67.
   The dollar was pushed lower by a variety of factors, including
central bank intervention.
   Bond prices fell in quiet trading.
   Grain and soybean futures advanced; coffee, livestock,
precious-metals and stock-index futures all rose and energy futures
finished mostly lower.

   Oil futures prices continue to drift lower in
slow summer trading.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, oil futures finished mostly
lower for a second straight day Wednesday in light trading.
Contracts for October delivery of West Texas Intermediate, the
benchmark grade of U.S. crude oil, slipped 2 cents a barrel to
close at $15.68, after falling 21 cents a barrel on Tuesday.
   Contracts for September delivery of wholesale unleaded gasoline
rose 0.33 cent to finish at 47.51 cents a gallon. Most other
contract months for gasoline declined. Wholesale heating oil for
September fell 0.28 cent to 43.75 cents a gallon.
   Analysts say trading continues to be driven mostly by technical
market factors, as traders await fresh news affecting supply and
demand and, particularly, developments involving the Organization
of Petroleum Exporting Countries.
   ``The fundamentals are unchanged,'' said Chris Gohler, an energy
futures broker at Elders Futures Inc.
   Even the American Petroleum Institute's weekly report on U.S.
oil inventories, released after the close of trading Tuesday,
failed to shake up the market.
   For the week ended Aug. 19, the API figures showed a decline in
crude oil stocks to around 340 million barrels from 344 million the
previous week, which normally would be bullish for crude prices.

   A small New Jersey company and the local arm
of international pharmaceutical giant F. Hoffmann-La Roche hope to
profit from the fight against drug abuse, through their disposable
drug testing kits.
   The kits are aimed at law enforcement agencies and businesses
that engaged in on-the-spot drug testing, but can be hampered by
the time consuming process of having to send samples off to a lab
for analysis.
   Drug Screening Systems Inc., of Blackwood, is marketing a system
called InstaScreen that it says is as easy to use a brewing a cup
of coffee _ which is where the idea originated.
   ``While making a cup of coffee in a Mr. Coffee machine, we said,
`Hey, why not do something like this?' And that was it,'' said
Raymond F. Akers Jr., a founder of Drug Screening Systems.
   ``Quite honestly, it was one of those, `ah hah!' things,'' he
said in an interview.
   To use the company's device, a urine sample is poured through a
disk-shaped filter that collects detectable amounts concentration
of any illegal narcotics. The filter is chemically treated to hold
any drug traces, and turns the color red if drugs are present.
   Drug Screening's device likely will face competition from the
number of similar tests being created by other companies. One such
competitor is Hoffmann-La Roche Inc. of Nutley, an unit of the
Swiss pharmaceutical giant F. Hoffmann-La Roche & Co.
   Hoffmann-La Roche plans to put its Ontrak system on the market
in October, said Albert Seidner, director of drug abuse marketing
for Hoffmann-La Roche subsidiary Roche Diagnostic Systems.
   Ontrak costs about $2 per test for a specific drug. Urine is
placed on a channeled slide and a chemical is added to detect drug
traces. The tests come in packages of 40 or 100 and are being tried
by criminal justice agencies, said Seidner.
   Patents have been issued for the Hoffmann-La Roche product, he
said. They have been approved for InstaScreen, said Akers' patent
lawyer, Carl Spivak of Philadelphia, but not yet issued.
   InstaScreen kits, which cost about $5, contain gloves, two
collection cups, strainer, chemical disk and vials. It also
includes a bottle for sending positive samples to a lab for
confirmation.
   On-site tests reduce the chance of a mix-up because the samples
do not have to be sent to a lab. Also, the tester does not have to
wait the usual days or weeks for the sample to be returned.
   InstaScreen and Ontrak also are immune to befuddlement by
vinegar or salt, condiments commonly used to mask the presence of
drugs.
   Salt flicked from under a fingernail or vinegar added from a
hidden vial prevents most immunoassay tests from working, Akers
said. In such tests, antibodies bind with the drug chemicals to
register a positive result, but salt and vinegar interfere with the
reaction.
   However, InstaScreen uses chemicals and not antibodies to
identify a drug presence, Akers said.
   Hoffmann-La Roche's test, although it is an immunoassay, is a
type that is not defeated by salt or vinegar, said Seidner.
   Akers founded Drug Screening with his father Raymond F. Akers
Sr. in March 1987. The company went public in May with a $3 million
stock offering. Drug Screening will report its first fiscal year
earnings in several weeks, and expects a profit on a projected $3
million in sales, said Akers.

<HEAD>Sales Slip In Mid-August, But Incentives of Last Year Skew Numbers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By FREDERICK STANDISH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sales of domestically-produced cars slipped 18.5
percent in mid-August compared with the same period last year, but
analysts said buyer incentives a year ago colored the latest
figures.
   U.S.-made truck sales fell 1.8 percent during the Aug. 11-20
period, making for a 13.2 percent overall decline in sales of
vehicles from U.S. factories, automakers reported Wednesday.
   The companies reported selling 298,580 cars and trucks during
the period this year, compared with 343,845 vehicles during the
same time last year. There were nine selling days in both periods.
   ``Incentives were just coming in last year and there are no new
incentive programs right now,'' said David Healy, an auto industry
analyst with Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. in New York.
   Healy said the numbers were misleading because of the
incentives, and that ``They (sales) are very strong.''
   Arvid Jouppi, an analyst in Detroit, disagreed with the strength
of the sales.
   ``The simple story is it's going to take incentives and an early
influx of 1989 models to get the sales moving up again,'' he said.
   Car makers have scheduled their 1989-model introductions through
the coming month. Ford Motor Co. unveiled its 1989 lineup on
Wednesday.
   ``I would say that there is every indication that the industry
has to do one of two things _ get into a very intense
share-of-market war or they have got to simply come up with
innovative new incentives,'' Jouppi said.
   General Motors Corp. showed the largest decline in the 10-day
sales, a 30.3 percent decline to 88,394 cars from 126,887 during
the period last year.
   Ford's sales fell 10 percent, to 60,184 cars from 66,907 cars
last year, and Chrysler Corp. sales fell 0.8 percent to 25,985 this
month from 26,200 during the period last August.
   For the year through Aug. 20, each of the Big Three reported
increased sales compared with the same period last year; GM by 1.2
percent, Ford by 9.9 percent and Chrysler by 13.7 percent.
   During the Aug. 11-20 period, GM's market share fell to 46.4
percent from 54.3 percent during mid-August of last year. Ford's
market share rose to 31.6 percent from 28.6 percent and Chrysler's
share moved up to 13.6 percent from 11.2 percent.
   Honda North America Inc. said it sold 9,259 cars during
mid-August of this year compared with 7,563 cars in the same period
last year _ a 22.4 percent increase.
   Nissan Motor Corp. USA's sales fell 4.5 percent during the
period from 4,380 cars in mid-August 1987 to 4,182 in the same
period this year. Toyota Motor Sales USA Inc. reported sales of
1,429 cars during the period this year compared with 1,188 last
year, an increase of 20.3 percent.

   Here are sales results for the eight major U.S.
automakers for Aug. 11-20.
   Percentage changes in sales are based on average daily sales
during each period rather than comparisons of straight totals.
There were nine selling days in the period this year and nine last
year.
   Cars and trucks made in the United States by Honda, Nissan,
Toyota and Mazda are counted as domestic and appear in this table.
   Cars and trucks imported for sale under the GM, Ford and Crysler
names are counted as foreign. Sales of imported cars and trucks are
reported at the end of each month.

   Ford Motor Co.'s 1989 model Thunderbirds
and Cougars could help the nation's No. 2 automaker cut further
into sales of industry leader General Motors Corp., according to
one analyst.
   ``Ford has been on a hot streak recently and I wouldn't be
surprised if the new Thunderbird and Cougar allows them to eat some
more of General Motor's lunch as far as market share is
concerned,'' said David Healy of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.
   Ford on Wednesday unveiled the redesigned Thunderbird and Cougar
and said it hopes to sell about 1.6 million cars and 1.6 million
trucks in 1989, a 6.7 percent increase over this year's projected 3
million total sales.
   Overall, the industry is forecasting a drop from expected sales
of 10.4 million cars this year.
   At a news conference held to coincide with an auto dealer
convention in neighboring Boston, Ford executives said the company
is targeting sales of about 130,000 each for the new Mercury Cougar
and Ford Thunderbird, which underwent broad design changes in a
five-year, multimillion-dollar development effort.
   Ten-day U.S. automotive sales figures released Wednesday gave
Ford a 31 percent market share compared with 28 percent last year
at this time, while GM slipped from 54 percent to 45 percent.
   ``GM's share has been slipping and I wouldn't be surprised if
these new models keep that trend going,'' Healy said.
   Ford executives said the company will increase production
capacity at some plants to meet higher demand for 1989. The sales
targets for the new Thunderbird and Cougar mark a 30 percent
increase over this year. The company said both cars would be priced
under $20,000.
   ``We're convinced at Ford that the economy is going to remain as
good as it is today,'' said Ross H. Roberts, general manager of
Ford's Lincoln-Mercury Division. ``We see nothing on the horizon,
none of those black clouds you frequently hear about, that says
business is going to be bad.''
   The new Cougar is two inches shorter than current models, the
wheelbase is nine inches longer and the car sits lower to the
ground. Roberts said the 113-inch wheelbase adds 10 cubic feet to
the passenger compartment. It has just six carryover parts from
this year, including the name and crest.
   The 1989 model Thunderbird, which led Ford's move to aerodynamic
styling five years ago, has a nine-inch longer wheelbase than this
year's model, low profile headlamps, and larger wheels and brakes.
   Some of the new Cougars and Thunderbirds will be equipped with a
standard 3.8-liter V-6 engine.
   ``These vehicles are going to come on strong with higher
performance engines,'' said Thomas O'Grady of Integrated Automotive
Resources, a market researcher in Wayne, Pa.
   Ford earned $1.66 billion in the second quarter of 1988, setting
an industry earnings record for the second straight three-month
period. In the first quarter, Ford earned $1.623 billion.
   Aside from the Cougar and Thunderbird, other new Ford lines
showed few if any changes for 1989, the 50th anniversary of the
Mercury name.
   Production of Thunderbird and Cougar is to begin in October. The
cars will be on introduced to the public Dec. 26 _ both late starts
for a new model year, which officially begins Oct. 1.
   Lincoln-Mercury is targeting total sales of 717,000 cars next
year, a 7 percent market share of a projected 10.25 million car
sales. That would be an increase of 0.3 percentage points over this
year and give the division its best year since 1978.

   R.P. Scherer Corp.'s management said it plans
to seek a review of the election of two directors who represent a
group that favors selling the pharmaceutical capsule maker.
   Dissident shareholders led by the company founder's daughter,
Karla Scherer Fink, elected the new directors to the 11-member
Scherer board, according to proxy voting results announced
Wednesday.
   The vote, which took place at the company's Aug. 17 annual
meeting, left directors who back management and oppose selling
Scherer with a 6-5 edge on the board, compared with 8-5 before the
vote, the dissidents said.
   Scherer Chief Executive Officer Peter Fink, Karla Fink's
estranged husband, said acknowledged the election of dissident
candidate Frederick Frank to the board, but said the results of
close voting in the seat apparently won by dissident Theodore
Souris, who unseated incumbent Peter Dow, would be reviewed.
   Theodore won 3,019,449 votes to Dow's 2,670,876.
   Karla Fink and her shareholders' committee disputed the need for
a review, spokeswoman Beth Lyons said. ``The election is final and
official,'' she said. ``That is the certified count from the
inspectors.''
   But Peter Fink said the company would insist on a complete
review of proxy cards voted for Souris and Dow.
   In a statement to employees following the meeting, he said,
``Perhaps the most important fact for you to remember is that
regardless of the outcome of the election, we have received no
offers to buy the company.''
   ``Furthermore, even if Mrs. Fink's nominees for directors are
both seated, she would still not have enough support on the board
of directors to gain approval for her proposed sale of the
company,'' Fink said.
   Karla Fink has said she would try to convince additional
directors of the wisdom of putting the company up for sale, and
launch another proxy fight at next year's annual meeting to try to
elect additional directors backing her position.
   Scherer Chairman Wilber Mack adjourned the meeting until 10 a.m.
Sept. 1, saying results of the review would be announced then.
   Karla Fink and board member John Scherer, the son of company
founder John S. Scherer, disputed Mack's authority to adjourn and
stated they were accepting the voting results as announced.
   Scherer, with 2,800 employees, is a leading maker of soft
gelatin capsules for drugs, vitamin supplements and similar
products. It had record sales of $290.7 million and earnings of
$15.1 million for its fiscal year ending March 31.

   The U.S. dollar was mostly lower against the major
currencies in European markets today.
   Gold prices rose.
   Foreign exchange dealers said their markets were nervous and
inclined to sell ahead of developments expected later in the day,
including U.S. gross national product statistics, the British trade
figures and German interest rates.
   In Tokyo, where the business day ends before Europe's begins,
the dollar fell 0.54 yen to a closing 133.76 yen. Later, in London,
it was quoted at 133.55 yen.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning, compared with late Wednesday's
rates, included: 1.8767 West German marks, down from 1.8915; 1.5820
Swiss francs, down from 1.5950; 6.3735 French francs, down from
6.4250; 2.1185 Dutch guilders, down from 2.1370; 1,393.50.Italian
lire, down from 1,403.50; and 1.2330 Canadian dollars, up from
1.2321.
   In London, the British pound was trading at $1.6825, more
expensive for buyers than Wednesday's late $1.6788 rate.
   Gold, which gained $2.75 a troy ounce in New York on Wednesday
as the dollar fell, opened in London at a bid price of $434.70 a
troy ounce. At midmorning, the city's five major bullion dealers
fixed a recommended price of $434.80. Both were up from Tuesday's
late bid of $433.90.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $434.75, up from $433.50 bid late
Wednesday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold rose $2.1 to close at a bid $436.10.
   Silver was quoted in London at a bid price of $6.78 a troy
ounce, down from $6.81 at Wednesday's close.

   Share prices recovered moderately in thin trading
on the Tokyo Stock Exchange today, while the dollar edged downward.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues gained 70.77
points, or 0.25 percent, to close at 27,870.44.
   The market's main index rebounded toward the end of the
afternoon trading despite its 31.32-point decline during the
morning session. It opened at 27,924.39.
   Trading was thin with 400 million shares, due to a strong
wait-and-see mood among investors, according to Nikko Securities'
Yoshio Shimoyama.
   ``Investors just weren't buying enough, waiting to see what
happens to the West German bank's decision on its discount rate. In
addition, the U.S. GNP report is coming out right after that,'' he
said. The revised U.S. gross national product figure for the second
quarter will be announced Friday.
   Among the issues that led the market's recovery today were steel
and real estate stocks.
   Investors on the foreign exchange trading were also in a
cautious mood, although some dollar-selling in Europe and Tokyo
weakened the value of the U.S. currency, said an exchange dealer at
a commercial bank in Tokyo.
   ``Nothing starts until the West German decision (on the discount
rate) comes out,'' he added, speaking on condition of anonymity.

<HEAD>French Industrialist Tapie Candidate For Donnay Rescue</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   French industrialist Bernard Tapie
wants to take over Donnay SA, the Belgian tennis racket maker that
went bankrupt last week, officials said Thursday.
   ``Tapie is welcome but if another serious candidate presents a
more credible, more interesting offer, he will have priority,''
said Jacques Hardy, a union spokesman.
   The daily Le Soir reported Tapie, 43, has already reached a
``tentative'' takeover accord under which 150 of the 350 jobs would
be saved.
   In recent years, Tapie has bought a range of failing firms and
made them profitable, becoming something of a symbol of French
entrepreneurial spirit.
   Donnay, the world's number one racket maker a decade ago, was
declared bankrupt last Friday by a Belgian court after failing to
reach agreement with creditors on new funds and a restructuring of
its debt.
   Hours later, Damaco International of Hong Kong, became the first
takeover candidate.
   Donnay, based in Couvin near the French border, is
majority-owned by the Donnay family. It reached its peak when Bjorn
Borg advertised its rackets but began to lose money after the
Swedish tennis ace retired in 1981.
   Donnay has debts of 1.4 billion Belgium francs ($35 million). In
1987, its revenue was 1.16 billion francs ($29 million), down a
third from 1986, and posted a loss of 80 million francs ($2
million).
   Early in the decade, Donnay made over 1.5 million rackets a year
and had a staff of 600. After Borg retired, its output of tennis
rackets fell by 50 percent and its staff was cut to 350.
   Officials said this was because Donnay ignored the trend for
rackets made of synthetic products and failed to sign a new tennis
star to advertise its product.

<HEAD>Farmers Insurance Group Agrees to $5.2 billion Buyout by Batus
Inc.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE GARTIES</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Farmers Insurance Group Inc. has agreed to a
$5.2 billion cash acquisition by Batus Inc., ending an acrimonious
eight-month takeover battle.
   The agreement at a price $3 per share higher than Batus' last
publicly announced bid was revealed Wednesday night by the chairmen
of Los Angeles-based Farmers and Batus, the Louisville, Ky.-based,
tobacco and retailing company.
   The agreement for a friendly merger at $75 a share would give
Batus' British parent, B.A.T Industries PLC, a foothold in the U.S.
financial services industry.
   The two sides began discussing a friendly buyout late last week
when Batus offered $72 per share, an increase of $9 per share over
its previous best offer.
   Stock of Farmers, the seventh-largest property and casualty
insurer, dipped 50 cents to $69.25 a share in active
over-the-counter trading Wednesday. The agreement was announced
hours after the market closed.
   ``In reaching its unanimous decision, Farmers' board of
directors considered the concerns regarding this combination which
have been raised during regulatory hearings, and has been satisfied
that these concerns will be adequately addressed in the merger of
the two companies,'' said Leo E. Denlea, Jr. chairman and chief
executive officer of Farmers Group Inc.
   ``We firmly believe that Farmers and Batus can work with the
insurance regulators to give the assurances necessary to enable
this merger to be accomplished to the benefit of all parties,''
Denlea added.
   Farmers' resistance to Batus included suggestions that the
company had suppressed research pointing to the dangers of smoking.
Farmers also persuaded a number of state and national lawmakers to
attack the British parent firm because it has operations in
racially segregated South Africa.
   But the merger talks, which began last Wednesday, were strictly
business, said Patrick Sheehy, chairman of both B.A.T and Batus.
   ``I think often things that are said in court are much more
acrimonious than one's true feelings,'' Sheehy said in an
interview. ``When it came to sitting down and talking, we both
decided we were going to do it in a spirit of trust and good will.''
   Sheehy said Farmers was pursued because it was found to be the
U.S. insurer most like B.A.T's British insurance business.
Attractions included similar lines of insurance and a
company-operated network of 14,000 agents.
   Sheehy said negotiations were complicated by Farmers' structure.
The Farmers group is made up of three policyholder-owned insurance
exchanges and a company-owned life insurance business.
   Farmers has 68.4 million common shares outstanding.
   Batus promised that Farmers' operations would be essentially
unchanged under the new ownership and Farmers suggested it would
drop its fierce resistance to Batus in hearings before insurance
regulators in several states.
   A joint announcement said that Batus, Farmers, Farmers Insurance
Exchange, Fire Insurance Exchange and Truck Insurance Exchange, the
reciprocal insurance exchanges managed by Farmers, have agreed to
provisions that would assure that the exchanges and their
policyholders would not be adversely affected in the merger.
   Batus began pursuing Farmers in January with a friendly offer of
$60 a share that was spurned by Farmers' management.
   Farmers resisted the buyout in hearings before insurance
regulators in nine states where the merger needed approval.
   The company claimed that Batus, which owns the maker of Kool and
Viceroy cigarettes, was unlikely to continue Farmers' emphasis on
non-smoker insurance discounts. Batus has vowed to continue the
discounts.
   The merger won the approval of insurance regulators in Arizona,
and was given conditional approval in Ohio and Illinois. Idaho,
Washington and Oregon have rejected the deal and decisions or
hearings are pending in Texas and Kansas.
   California regulators rejected the merger, but that decision was
overturned by a state court.

   Britain's merchandise trade deficit spurted 72
percent to a record 2.65 billion pounds, the equivalent of $4.5
billion, in July, the government reported Thursday.
   Immediately after the report was released, the Bank of England
signaled a full percentage point increase in the British commercial
banks' base lending rate to 12 percent.
   Barlcays Bank PLC, Midland Bank PLC, Lloyds Banks PLC and
National Westminster Bank PLC quickly responded.
   That was the eighth time the central bank signaled an increase
in the benchmark rate since early June when it stood at a 10-year
low of 7.5 percent. All the previous increases had been half-point
gains.
   Stock prices plunged, but the pound, uncertain, darted up and
down on the news.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index, which had
been down just about 3 points earlier, fell 50.6 points, or 2.8
percent, to 1,768.6 by 2:00 p.m.
   The pound was quoted at 1.6805 dollars after the news vs. 1.6915
dollars before.
   Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson said the interest rate
hike was necessary and that interest rates would remain at current
levels from some time.
   ``The import figures confirm that the economy has been growing
too fast. We have to slow it down and that means higher interest
rates,'' Lawson said in a British Broadcasting Corp. radio
interview.
   ``The government is determined to do whatever is necessary to
keep inflation under control,'' Lawson said.
   The deficit compared with a revised shortfall off 1.54 billion
pounds (2.6 billion dollars) in June and a 1.02 billion-pound (1.7
billion-dollar) gap in July 1987, the Department of Trade and
Industry said.
   Britain's current account deficit spurted to 2.15 billion pounds
($3.6 billion) in July, compared with a revised deficit of 1.04
billion pounds ($1.8 billion) in June and a deficit of 323 million
pounds ($546 million) in July 1987.
   The current account includes ``invisible'' trade, such as
services, overseas investment earnings and official transfer
payments, which was estimated to be in surplus by 500 million
pounds ($845 million) in July.
   July's deficits were much larger than expected by the markets,
which had anticipated a merchandise trade gap of 1.51 billion
pounds ($2.6 billion) and a current account deficit of 1.01 billion
pounds ($1.7 billion).
   The department originally reported June's trade deficit as 1.52
billion pounds ($2.6 billion) and the current account deficit as
1.02 billion pounds ($1.7 billion).

   Contract talks between ailing Pan Am Corp. and
its flight attendants union are at an impasse, and the airline is
seeking federal mediation, according to Pan Am and union
representatives.
   The union made a proposal countering the company's offer at a
Tuesday meeting, but Pan Am rejected it without discussion, flight
attendants union spokeswoman Lois Schneider said Wednesday.
   Pan Am spokesman Alan Loflin refuted that statement today. ``We
were willing to negotiate,'' he said.
   Loflin said Pan Am officials asked the National Mediation Board
Wednesday to bring a federal mediator into the negotiations. New
contract talks have not been scheduled yet.
   Pan Am management has been seeking $90 million in wage
reductions from the Independent Union of Flight Attendants over
three years, as part of its plan for financial recovery.
   The union's counter-proposal involved smaller wage cuts, Ms.
Schneider said.
   ``At this point, we're considering options,'' she said.
   The flight attendants' contract expires on Aug. 31. Under
federal labor rules, the union could strike at the end of a 30-day
``cooling-off'' period following the declaration of an impasse by
the mediator.
   Margaret Brennan, the union's president, issued a statement
contending Pan Am's latest action shows it intended to take labor
relations ``back to the dark ages.'' She asked for a congressional
investigation into Pan Am and its actions in the negotiations.
   Members of the largest union at Pan Am, the Transport Workers,
recently rejected a wage freeze agreement that would have saved the
company an estimated $81 million over three years. The Transport
Workers union also has asked for federal mediation.
   Pan Am had a net loss of $265.3 million last year and is seeking
about $540 million in pay cuts and other concessions over three
years to turn itself around. Its chairman, Thomas Plaskett,
recently said the airline might sell its Latin American routes if
labor concessions are not made.
   The two unions representing pilots and flight engineers at Pan
Am agreed earlier this year to wage cuts totaling about $240
million over three years.
   Pan Am also has imposed $35 million in cuts under federal labor
rules on employees represented by the Teamsters union.

   General Motors Corp. has begun recalling more
than 600,000 1983 Oldsmobiles and Buicks for repair of the
vehicles' emissions control systems, the Environmental Protection
Agency said today.
   A defective thermal vacuum switch causes the cars to exceed
federal standards on emission of gasoline vapors and carbon
monoxide, the EPA said.
   Repair of the component will take about 20 minutes, the EPA said.
   The agency said 613,582 vehicles are involved in the recall.
They are the 1983 Oldsmobile Cutlass Supreme, Cutlass Cruiser,
Delta 88, Ninety-Eight, Toronado and Custom Cruiser, and the 1983
Buick Le Sabre, Estate Wagon, Electra and Riviera.
   The models all have 5-liter engines.

   The stock market opened lower today, unable to
extend the brisk rally of the previous session.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which climbed 37.34
points on Wednesday, was down 14.40 at 2,012.27 after 30 minutes of
trading.
   Declining issues outpaced gainers by a margin of 7 to 2 among
issues listed on the New York Stock Exchange, with 199 up, 713 down
and 455 unchanged.
   Big Board volume amounted to 19.69 million shares as of 10 a.m.
on Wall Street compared with 18.09 million shares at the same point
Wednesday.
   Analysts said interest rate worries continued to weigh upon the
market.
   Before the New York stock market opened today, the West German
central bank raised a key lending rate and banks in several other
European countries followed suit.
   Those developments sent the U.S. bond market lower in early
trading.
   The 30-year Treasury bond, for instance, lost about $7.50 for
every $1,000 in face value while its yield jumped to 9.47 percent
from 9.40 percent.
   Analysts said the increase in European rates stirred speculation
that U.S. rates could also be headed higher. That hurt stocks
because higher rates could cut corporate profits and make
government notes and bonds more attractive.
   The U.S. government's announcement today that it had revised its
estimate of second-quarter economic growth upward to 3.3 percent
rate from 3.1 percent had been anticipated and appeared to have
little impact on the market.
   Today's activity comes on the first anniversary of the Dow Jones
industrial average's peak of 2,722.42.
   Among the early active issues on the NYSE, International
Business Machines was off } at 112, American Express fell { to 28\
and American Telephone & Relegraph was down \ at 24}.
   In over-the-counter trading, Farmers Group was up { at 69}. The
company agreed to a $75-a-share takeover offer from B.A.T.
Industries of Britain.
   The NYSE index was off 0.95 at 146.98. On the American Stock
Exchange, the composite market value index fell 0.64 to 293.42.
   On Wednesday, the Dow Jones industrial average climbed 37.34
points to 2,026.67, its biggest gain in nearly a month.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 5-to-2 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
1,089 issues up, 376 down and 498 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the NYSE came to 127.80 million shares,
up from 119.54 million in the previous session.

<HEAD>Survey Shows 95 Percent of Business Travelers Receive No Training</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A survey revealed that 95 percent of
America's business travelers received no training on how to
efficiently and effectively travel.
   In addition, 72 percent of the corporate travel planners said
their companies did not provide formal training or orientation
about business travel for their employees, according to the survey
commissioned by the non-profit Marriott Business Travel Institute.
   Brian Tierney, executive director of the institute, said
American business spends more than $66 billion annually on business
travel and $32 billion on training as a whole, but not on
travelling.
   He said many business travelers are not properly prepared for
the rigors of travel and become frustrated as soon as they pack
their bags.
   ``This frustration leads to a tired, hassled traveler whose
ability to be productive, and to conduct business on the road, can
be seriously affected,'' he said.
   Those frustrations can come from wasted time at airports, hotels
and car rental agencies. Untrained travelers often do not request
advanced boarding passes for their flights, don't know that they
can ask for rental car express reservation, and fail to use express
or video checkout at hotels.
   ``By understanding these and other basic ins and outs of
business travel _ which can be communicated in employee training
programs _ business travelers can improve their efficiency and
effectiveness, and find the rigors of travel less stressful,''
Tierney said.
   The MBTI was established earlier this year to research, observe,
monitor and report issues, trends and developments that have an
impact on present day business travel.
   In the survey, the MBTI asked 75 business travelers if they had
received any formal training or orientation from their employers
before they took their first business trip. Those who had not
received training then were asked about benefits they would have
received if formal training had been offered.
   The benefits mentioned most were reductions in stress and cost,
better use of time, greater productivity and more enjoyment.
   The corporate travel managers questioned agreed with the
benefits and added that a well-trained traveler projects a more
professional image.

<TEXT>
   Gillette Co. said it has secured $1.2 billion in
credit for the stock repurchase program it created as part of a
settlement with a dissident shareholder group that fought for
control of the toiletry company.
   A syndicate of banks will supply the credit, including $730
million to buy back stock from shareholders, Gillette said
Wednesday.
   The stock repurchase plan was announced earlier this month as
part of an out-of-court settlement that ended a bitter proxy fight
between Gillette and Coniston Partners, a New York investment firm.
Coniston wanted control of Gillette's board to sell the company to
the highest bidder.
   Both sides sued each other, charging violations of of federal
securities laws during the proxy fight.
   Under the stock buyback plan, stockholders will be able to sell
one-seventh of their shares to Gillette at or above a market price
of $45. Stockholders also have the right to sell their options.
   Gillette said it plans to repurchase 16 million shares of its
112 million outstanding shares. Coniston, Gillette's largest
shareholder, would net a profit of about $14.4 million before
expenses by selling back 1.1 million shares. It still would own
about 6 million Gillette shares.

<HEAD>Consumer Price Inflation Continues Slide</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES ANDERSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MEXICO CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Consumer prices continue to ease under a
tough government anti-inflation program, with prices rising 0.7
percent in the first half of August, the central Bank of Mexico
announced Wednesday night.
   It predicted smaller increases in consumer prices for the
remainder of the month once sales taxes are reduced and other
measures taken under the government's Economic Solidarity Pact.
   The central bank attributed most of the rise in the consumer
price index to ``residual effects'' of price hikes for meat and
services in the final days of July.
   ``Without this influence, the Index would have remained
practically stable,'' the bank said in a statement.
   Prices for fruits, fresh vegetables, sugar, personal items and
electric appliances actually fell between Aug. 1-15, while rents,
at two percent, and clothing, at 1.2 percent, led price gains.
   The bank forecast even lower inflation for the rest of August
because of reductions in the value added tax for basic goods and
medicines that went into effect Aug. 18.
   The government enacted its Economic Solidarity Pact in December
as inflation was reaching a record 159.2 percent for all of 1987.
   A freeze on the peso currency exchange rate, the federal minimum
wage and prices for government-regulated goods and services forms
the centerpiece of the program.
   Under the pact, inflation reached 43.3 percent for the first
seven months of 1988, while the annual rate since July 1987 was
122.3 percent.
   On Aug. 14, the government announced modifications to the pact
and extended it to Nov. 30, President Miguel de la Madrid's last
day in office.
   While maintaining the freezing of wages, official prices and the
peso exchange rate, the government said it would reduce sales taxes
from six to zero percent on processed foods and medicines by Sept.
1.
   It also ordered retailers to reduce prices for their goods an
average of 3 percent compared to prices in effect between July 7
and August 7.
   On Saturday, Commerce Department inspectors closed several
Mexico City pharmacies for failing to abide by the new price
guidelines.
   Commerce Secretary Hector Hernandez Cervantes said Wednesday the
government will launch a national media campaign reminding
consumers that savings from the sales tax reductions must be
reflected in prices at the cash register. The ads will urge
consumers to report suspected violations to authorities.
   The government also plans to publish lists of retailers' prices
for thousands of consumer items to compel compliance with the pact,
Hernandez Cervantes said.

   The economy expanded at a brisk annual rate of
3.3 percent from April through June in spite of a severe shock from
the drought that seared much of the country, the government
reported today.
   The gross national product, the broadest measure of economic
health, expanded at essentially the same rate as in the first
quarter, when the GNP rose at an annual rate of 3.4 percent.
   But inflation in the second quarter, the Commerce Department
said, was accelerating at its fastest pace in almost six years.
   ``The economy is growing much too fast and if it isn't reigned
in quickly, it is surely going to mean that inflation will be much
more pronounced,'' said Robert Dederick, chief economist for
Northern Trust Co. of Chicago.
   ``It is nice to grow fast in the early stages of an expansion
when you have a lot of unemployemnt, but at this stage we just
can't afford it,'' he said.
   The robust 3.3 percent growth rate occurred despite the fact
that the impact of the drought on farm production shaved a full
percentage point from second quarter growth, the government said
today.
   Without the drought, the GNP would have shot up at a 4.3 percent
annual rate in the April-June period.
   The government estimated that the drought will reduce farm
output by $14.3 billion in 1988, shaving about 0.4 percentage point
from growth for the full year.
   Even with the troubles in the farm belt, however, the economy
continued to show its resiliency, propelled by a sharp turnaround
in the country's trade deficit and strong growth in business
investment and consumer spending.
   But inflation accelerated as well, with a GNP price index that
measures a changing market basket of goods rising at an annual rate
of 5.1 percent, the fastest increase since a 5.8 percent rise in
the third quarter of 1982.
   The big surge in inflation, which followed an increase of 1.7
percent in the first quarter, was blamed on higher consumer prices
for clothing, food and gasoline.
   The burst of inflation served to emphasize the problems facing
the expansion, which has already lasted a peacetime record of 69
months.
   With growth so robust, the economy is beginning to see rising
inflationary pressures from tight labor markets and demand
outstripping production.
   The Federal Reserve since March has been pushing interest rates
higher to dampen demand, but many economists are worried that
unless growth slows in the coming quarters, the central bank will
have to clamp down even harder and risk pushing the country into a
recession in 1989.
   In good news for Republican presidential chances, however,
economists see no likelihood that economic growth will slow
appreciably before the Nov. 8 election.
   Many analysts believe the economy in the current quarter may be
expanding at an even faster rate than in the spring.
   The Reagan administration has already boosted its economic
growth projection for the full year to 3.5 percent, which would be
the best performance since 1984.
   Today's GNP estimate of 3.3 percent for the second quarter
represented an upward revision from a month ago, when the
government put GNP growth at a lower 3.1 percent during the quarter.
   The improvement came from higher spending by the federal
goverment, consumers and businesses than previously estimated.
   The trade deficit shrank at an annual rate of $18.9 billion in
the second quarter, the best showing since 1980.
   This coupled with a 2.7 percent rise in consumer spending and a
sharp 17.9 percent advance in business investment provided much of
the economy's strength during the quarter.
   This strength was offset somewhat by the drought. Originally,
the government had estimated that the drought reduced GNP growth by
one-half percentage point in the second quarter. With farm losses
mounting, however, the government has doubled the adverse impact,
saying that farm losses totaled $9.5 billion at an annual rate in
the second quarter. Analysts estimated that figure would rise even
higher in the third and fourth quarters.
   The various changes left the GNP, after adjusting for inflation,
at an annual rate of $3.99 trillion in the second quarter.
   In other good news, the government said today that after-tax
corporate profits shot up 11.5 percent in the second quarter
following a 2.5 percent rise in the first quarter. The performance
was the best showing since a 14.5 percent rise in the second
quarter of 1983.
   Many private economists believe that the administration's growth
estimate for the entire year is too low.
   The monthly survey of 51 top economists by Blue Chip Economic
Indicators, a financial newsletter, put the consensus estimate of
GNP growth for this year at 3.8 percent.
   The economy has shown surprising strength this year. In the wake
of last October's stock market collapse, many analysts were
forecasting a recession this year.
   However, growth has stayed at strong levels, propelled by a big
turnaround in the U.S. trade deficit which has boosted the fortunes
of American manufacturing companies.
   Consumer spending and business investment to expand production
facilities also have contributed to the strength this year.
   This rapid growth has helped push unemployment down to 14-year
lows. But the rapid growth also has begun to push up against supply
restraints because of tight labor markets and high operating rates
in many industries.
   This often translates into rising inflationary pressures as
workers demand higher wages and businesses boost prices.
   To fight the inflationary pressures, the Federal Reserve since
late March has been boosting interest rates to dampen demand.
Earlier this month, it hiked its discount rate one-half percentage
point to 6.5 percent.
   This credit tightening, many economists believe, will slow
growth starting in the fourth quarter and extending into next year.
   Some analysts are worried that if inflationary pressures
continue to increase and the Fed is forced to clamp down further,
the risks of a substantial slowdown and possibly even a recession
will rise for 1989.

<HEAD>West Germans Raise Key Interest Rates; Other Europeans Follow</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   West Germany's central bank raised a key interest rate today to
3.5 percent from 3 percent because of the stronger dollar, and
central banks in several Western European countries quickly
followed.
   The action marked the latest in a round of higher interest rates
worldwide and came a few weeks after the U.S. Federal Reserve
tightened credit in the United States by pushing interest rates
higher.
   The U.S. currency slumped in response to the action today by the
West German Bundesbank and other European banks. The dollar was
quoted at around 1.8660 West German marks at midmorning in New
York, down sharply from 1.8820 marks late Wednesday.
   In Britain, the Bank of England signaled a full percentage point
increase in the British commercial banks' base lending rate to 12
percent, following a government report on the country's trade
deficit in July.
   The report showed the July trade gap soared 72 percent to a
record 2.65 billion pounds, or about $4.5 billion.
   The central banks of Switzerland, Austria and the Netherlands
announced interest rate hikes shortly after the Bundesbank move.
   In Tokyo, however, a senior Bank of Japan official said there is
``absolutely no need to consider an adjustment in Japan's monetary
policy just because the Bundesbank and the Bank of England raised
their base rates.''
   The higher West German discount rate goes into effect on Friday,
the Bundesbank said in a statement. The discount rate is the
interest the Bundesbank charges on loans to other banks.
   The Bundesbank was selling dollars in the open market shortly
after making its announcement, according to currency dealers in
Frankfurt, West Germany.
   Karl Otto Poehl, president of the Bundesbank, cited the weakness
of the West German mark against the dollar as a reason for lifting
the key rate, which makes mark-denominated investments more
attractive.
   ``Today's step is an important signal which will be understood
by the foreign-exchange and capital markets,'' Poehl said. ``It
should lead to stabilization of the (currency) and capital markets
and the first reactions should show this is the case.''
   Following the Bundesbank action, the dollar slid to 1.8640 marks
at the Frankfurt currency exchange in early afternoon.
   Earlier, the U.S. currency had fallen to an official Frankfurt
fixing of 1.8764 marks from Wednesday's official level of 1.8960
marks.
   Poehl told reporters that the dollar's strength against the mark
endangered efforts to adjust trade imbalances between the world's
major trading partners.
   He also said the Bundesbank will ``continue to do everything to
stem the decline of the mark against the dollar.''
   The Bundesbank president also said the discount rate increase
was aimed at curbing West German inflation and bringing the
country's above-target money supply growth back into the proper
range.
   The Bundesbank has adjusted domestic interest rates upwards
three times in the past eight weeks.

   Stock prices fell broadly today, weighed down
once again by worries about interest rates.
   But the pace of trading remained sluggish.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which climbed 37.34
points on Wednesday, was down 18.31 at 2,008.36 after 90 minutes of
trading.
   Declining issues outpaced gainers by a margin of 3 to 1 among
issues listed on the New York Stock Exchange, with 273 up, 956 down
and 439 unchanged.
   Big Board volume amounted to 48.32 million shares as of 11 a.m.
on Wall Street compared with 42.58 million shares at the same point
Wednesday.
   Analysts said stocks suffered from renewed interest rate worries.
   Before the U.S. stock market opened today, the West German
central bank raised a key lending rate and banks in several other
European countries followed suit.
   Analysts said the increase in European rates stirred speculation
that U.S. rates could also be headed higher. That hurt stocks
because higher rates could cut corporate profits and make
government notes and bonds more attractive.
   The U.S. government said today it had revised upward its
estimate of second-quarter economic growth to 3.3 percent rate from
3.1 percent. While that revision was in line with expectations,
analysts said a simultaneous upward revision in an inflation
measure tied to the gross national product worried some traders.
   Prices in the U.S. credit market moved lower in the early going,
pushing interest rates higher.
   The 30-year Treasury bond, for instance, lost about $7.50 for
every $1,000 in face value while its yield jumped to 9.47 percent
from 9.40 percent.
   Today's activity comes on the first anniversary of the Dow Jones
industrial average's peak of 2,722.42.
   Among the early active issues on the NYSE, Eastman Kodak was off

<TEXT>
   America's economy and corporate profits expanded briskly this
spring, the government said today, but the news was overshadowed by
higher inflation, rising interest rates, slumping financial markets
and a slowdown in home sales.
   The Commerce Department said the gross national product, the
broadest measure of economic health, rose at an annual rate of 3.3
percent from April through June despite severe shock from the
drought that seared much of the country. The GNP rate of expansion
was unchanged from the first quarter.
   Without the drought, the GNP would have shot up at a 4.3 percent
annual rate in the April-June period.
   The government also said after-tax corporate profits shot up
11.5 percent in the second quarter following a 2.5 percent rise in
the first quarter. The performance was the best since a 14.5
percent rise in the 1983 second quarter.
   But April-June inflation as measured by a GNP price index rose
at an annual rate of 5.1 percent, the fastest increase since a 5.8
percent rise in the third quarter of 1982, the department said. The
surge was blamed on higher prices for clothes, food and fuel.
   Further obscuring the GNP and corporate profit news was that key
West European nations raised interest rates today, blaming the move
on the stronger U.S. dollar and consequent weakness in their own
currencies. The increases signaled another round of higher interest
rates worldwide.
   Those developments helped incite a selloff in the bond market, a
sensitive barometer of interest rates and the economy. The
Treasury's key 30-year issue fell nearly $7.50 per $1,000 in face
amount and its yield rose to 9.46 percent from 9.39 percent late
Wednesday.
   On Wall Street, where traders were recalling the stock market
peak a year ago today, prices slid as well. The Dow Jones
industrial average was down about 18 points to the 2,008 level by
late morning.
   Rising interest rates also played a key role in a 5 percent drop
in existing single-family home sales last month, a real estate
trade group said today. The National Association of Realtors said
the decline was partly the result of higher mortgage costs.
   The developments came a day after the government reported
America's trade deficit shrank 15 percent in the April-June
quarter, which heartened Republicans fighting to retain the White
House but didn't impress the financial markets.
   The difference between what the United States spends and sells
abroad narrowed to a deficit of $29.9 billion in the second
quarter, compared with a $35.2 billion deficit in the first quarter.
   Many economists regard the trade deficit as one of the most
visible weaknesses in the economy, reflecting a relentless
addiction to cheap imports and consequent difficulty for domestic
companies trying to compete. Democrats have attempted to make the
trade deficit an issue in the presidential campaign.
   But the improvement reported Wednesday suggested U.S.
manufacturers were making strong gains in selling abroad. Some
economists are predicting the trade deficit will drop by nearly 25
percent for the entire year, marking the first annual improvement
since President Reagan took office.
   Republicans are hoping voters will focus on the improvement,
which already has shown up in the Commerce Department's monthly
merchandise trade reports.
   In other economic news, major automakers said Wednesday that
mid-August sales of U.S.-made cars and trucks fell by 13.2 percent
from the same period a year earlier, when sales were inflated by
buyers taking advantage of dealer incentives.

<TEXT>
   Japan should eliminate barriers that restrict
U.S. chocolate manufacturers from promoting their products in that
country, says the chairman of the House of Representatives' Energy
and Commerce Committee.
   Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich., said in letters made available
Thursday that discriminatory trade practices ``directly affect more
than $75 million in retail sales by American chocolate
manufacturers in Japan.''
   In the letters, sent on Monday to Nobuo Matsunaga, Japan's
ambassador in Washington, and U.S. Trade Representative Clayton
Yeutter, Dingell called for swift action to end the chocolate
restrictions.
   ``In the Japanese system, industry trade associations can
establish fair competition codes, which are then adopted by the
Japan Fair Trade Commission,'' Dingell said.
   ``Among other things, these codes limit promotional activities,
such as lotteries or premiums offered to consumers _ activities
that Japanese companies can conduct freely in America,'' he said.

   Grain and soybean futures prices opened mixed
today on the Chicago Board of Trade.
   Traders started out looking for confirmation of rumors that
China was planning a big soyoil purchase that would be subsidized
under the U.S. export bonus program. But when that failed to
materialize, they promptly took a big chunk of the top of soyoil
prices.
   Wheat, meanwhile, took a hit when a Department of Agriculture
official denied that a one-year extension of the grain accord with
the Soviets already was complete.
   That pact, the first step in what is anticipated to result in
another five-year deal between the superpowers, still is expected
to be complete sometime soon.
   On the opening, wheat was 3 cents to 4{ cents higher, with the
contract for delivery in September at $3.94 a bushel; oats were {

   Livestock and meat futures prices opened mixed at the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange.
   Live cattle were .17 cent lower .22 cent higher, with October at
71.52 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .40 cent lower to .23 cent

   A federal judge today denied motions for a
new trial for a Maryland entrepreneur, the former president of the
Seven-Up Co. and a soft drink bottler who had been convicted of
price fixing.
   Morton M. Lapides, 57, chairman of the board of Alleghany
Beverage Corp. of Cheverly, Md., and James J. Harford, former
president of Mid-Atlantic Coca-Cola Bottling of Silver Spring, Md.,
and the Alleghany Bottling Co. were convicted following a six-week
trial in April and May.
   Lapides and Harford face a maximum three years in prison.
Alleghany faces a maximum $1 million fine. U.S. District Judge
Robert G. Doumar was expected to impose sentences today.
   ``I am very concerned with restitution to the public,'' Doumar
said. ``People who believe money is the answer to any crime because
they are a corporation should think differently when they enter
this court.'
   At the time of his conviction, Harford was the president of
Seven-Up, but resigned that post three days after the conviction.
Harford's conviction was the result of actions while heading the
Coca-Cola bottling firm, and did not involve Seven-Up.
   The convictions were part of an on-going Justice Department
probe of the soft drink industry, which has resulted in 11 grand
jury investigations in eight other states.
   Lapides and Harford were convicted of rigging the wholesale
price of their respective products in 1983 and 1984. Alleghany
Beverage was the parent company of Alleghany Pepsi-Cola Bottling
Co. until 1985 when Lapides sold the subsidiary for $160 million.
   During the trial, the defense contended that neither man knew of
the scheme and that if the allegations were true, then it was the
work of lower level employees who made decisions without their
bosses' knowledge.
   Federal prosecutors argued that the two bottlers reached an
accord to halt the previous bitter competition by fixing the
wholesale price of their products sold to schools, motels, hotels,
and other commercial buyers in Maryland and Virgina.
   Mid-Atlantic pleaded guilty to earlier, similar indictments and
agreed to pay $2 million in fines for price rigging in Virginia and
Washington, D.C., markets.
   In March, both bottling firms also agreed to rebate $45,000 to
Virginia to be distributed to school districts for overcharges on
their soft drink purchases. The agreement drawn up by Attorney
General Mary Sue Terry called for Mid-Atlantic to pay $30,000 and
Alleghany $15,000.
   Prior to the April conviction, several other soft drink
executives have been found guilty or pleaded guilty to a variety of
charges.
   In February 1987, Armand S. Gravely, a former Richmond division
manager for Alleghany, was convicted of price fixing and
obstruction of justice. He was sentenced to four months in jail and
fined $15,000.
   Edward L. Wynns, a Mid-Atlantic vice president, pleaded guilty
in May 1987 to charges he lied to the grand jury investigating the
price fixing.
   The former president of Alleghany Bottling, James P. Sheridan of
Timonium, Md., was given a 3-year sentence, with all but 120 days
suspended, and fined $45,000 in August 1987 after pleading guilty
to price fixing.
   A third executive indicted along with Lapides and Harford, Odis
R. Allen, a Mid-Atlantic vice president, pleaded guilty to price
fixing in March.

<HEAD>120,000 Alligator Skins Smuggled Into Japan, Report Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   More than 120,000 skins of a protected species of
alligator were smuggled into Japan during the past seven months
using stolen or falsified export documents, a wildlife protection
organization said Thursday.
   Traffic Japan, the wildlife trade monitoring group of the World
Wide Fund for Nature, said the South American caiman skins were
shipped by a complex route involving at least seven South American
and Asian countries before they arrived in Japan.
   At least 46 tons of the skins, from more than 120,000
alligators, entered Japan in the first seven months of this year
through Thailand alone, the group said. It said it believed the
skins were part of a larger shipment that was loaded onto
Asia-bound ships off the coast of Uruguay at the end of last year.
   The declared customs value of the skins was about 427 million
yen (about $3.2 million), ``but retail value would be four to five
times more,'' spokeswoman Cecila Song said. The skins are used in
Japan mainly for belts and watchbands.
   Permits are required for the export of South American caiman
skins under the regulations of the Convention on International
Trade in Endangered Species (CITES), an international treaty
regulating trade in protected plants and animals, Song said.
   Japanese officials allowed the shipments to enter the country
without proper verification of the export documents, the group said
in a statement.
   ``Traffic's 8-month investigation has revealed a serious lapse
of CITES administration in Thailand and Japan, and has uncovered a
long paper trail of illegal CITES documents and other ploys
involving Thailand, Colombia, Chile, Venezuela and Singapore to
mask the illegal origins of the poached skins,'' the statement said.
   It said Japan's Ministry of International Trade and Industry had
responded to evidence of illegal caiman trade by instituting a new
voluntary check system on all imports of the skins.
   ``But unless they come up with a system involving legal
penalties, we don't think there will be any improvement, especially
with the high profits involved,'' Song said.
   Ministry officials were not available Thursday night for comment.

   The stock market retreated broadly today,
weighed down by worries about rising interest rates a year to the
day after the Dow Jones industrial average closed at its all-time
high.
   The level of trading was up from the previous session, but was
still relatively sluggish.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which climbed 37.34
points on Wednesday, was down 27.56 to 1,999.11 at noontime.
   Today's decline comes on the first anniversary of the Dow Jones
industrial average reaching its record close of 2,722.42 last Aug.
25.
   Declining issues outpaced gainers by a margin of 5 to 3 among
issues listed on the New York Stock Exchange, with 287 up, 1,044
down and 443 unchanged.
   Big Board volume amounted to 67.45 million shares as of noon on
Wall Street compared with 59.85 million shares at the same point
Wednesday.
   Analysts said stocks suffered from renewed interest rate worries.
   Before the U.S. stock market opened today, the West German
central bank raised a key lending rate and banks in several other
European countries followed suit.
   Analysts said the increase in European rates stirred speculation
that U.S. rates could also be headed higher. That hurt stocks
because higher rates could cut corporate profits and make
government notes and bonds more attractive.
   The U.S. government said today it had revised upward its
estimate of second-quarter economic growth to 3.3 percent rate from
3.1 percent. While that revision was in line with expectations,
analysts said a simultaneous upward revision in an inflation
measure tied to the gross national product worried some traders.
   Prices in the U.S. credit market moved lower in the early going,
pushing interest rates higher.
   The 30-year Treasury bond, for instance, lost about $7.50 for
every $1,000 in face value, while its yield jumped to 9.48 percent
from 9.40 percent late Wednesday.
   Lawrence R. Helfand, manager of retail sales at Rodman & Renshaw
Inc. in Chicago, said the rising rates were offering ``some stiff
competition for the stock market.''
   He noted that yields on some short-term Treasury issues are
above 7 percent, and are attractive to investors looking for a
haven for their money while awaiting some clarification of where
the economy is headed.
   ``We won't make much headway until there is a sign that higher
interest rates have begun to slow the economy,'' he said.
   Northeast Utilities was the most active issue on the NYSE with
more than 11.7 million shares traded by midday. It was unchanged at
19. Friday is the deadline to qualify for the company's quarterly
dividend.
   Among other active issues on the NYSE, Hanson was down ] at 11},
International Business Machines fell 2 to 110}, American Express

<HEAD>Appeals Court Upholds CNW Sale</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal appeals court has ruled that CNW Corp.
may sell 208 miles of railroad without giving labor unions a voice
in the sale.
   The decision by the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals affirms an
earlier U.S. District Court ruling.
   The decision also bars a threatened strike against CNW's Chicago
& North Western Transportation Co. railroad by unions opposed to
the proposed track sale.
   The Railway Labor Executives' Association had filed a motion to
stop the railroad from closing the sale to FRVR Corp., a subsidiary
of Chicago-based Itel Corp.
   The association said Wednesday it was considering appealing the
circuit court decision to the U.S. Supreme Court.
   The labor group, citing the Railway Labor Act, had argued that
the railroad was obligated to negotiate over the effects of the
sale on its employees because it will result in changed pay,
seniority and working conditions.
   CNW contended the labor issues involved constitute a minor
dispute that should be resolved in binding arbitration.
   ``We are free to sell branch lines to regional line operators,''
said company spokesman James Foote after the ruling. ``The decision
means the unions can't strike over the sale because it's a minor
dispute.''
   The section of track, which runs from Milwaukee to Green Bay,
Wis., will be called the Fox River Valley Railroad after the sale
to FRVR is complete, Foote said.
   Chicago-based CNW is the holding company for the railroad, a
leading Midwest freight hauler that also operates area commuter
trains used by 41,000 people.
   The sale of the line is not related to a contract dispute over
train crew size that caused a brief strike at C&NW earlier this
month. The walkout was halted by Congress, which extended a
cooling-off period until Sept. 9.

   John F. Merriam, who headed the former
Northern Natural Gas Co. of Omaha during a period of rapid gas-line
expansion, died after suffering a stroke. He was 84.
   Merriam, who had been hospitalized in Kentfield, Calif., since
June, died Tuesday, according to his son, J. Alec Merriam of
Tiburon, Calif.
   Merriam retired in 1966, and he and wife, Lucy, moved to San
Francisco in 1972.
   Merriam joined Northern Natural Gas in 1930 as a $200-a-month
clerk. He became president in 1950 at age 46 and was chairman and
chief executive officer when he retired. He remained on Northern's
board of directors until 1975.
   Northern Natural Gas became InterNorth Inc. and then Enron Corp.
The company has moved its home office from Omaha to Houston.

   The Pentagon said today it believes the Soviet
Union's jet fighter program has benefitted from the diversion of
French milling equipment in a case of illegal exporting that rivals
the wrongdoing by Japan's Toshiba Corp.
   Fred Hoffman, a Pentagon spokesman, said a French concern by the
name of Forest Line is under investigation by authorities in France
and the United States.
   ``The investigation involves the alleged diversion of dozens of
very sophisticated milling machines to military users in the Soviet
Union,'' Hoffman added.
   ``We believe the machines were used in the Soviet MiG (jet
fighter) program.''
   Hoffman was asked about the investigation after another top
Pentagon official, Stephen D. Bryen, told a group of Pentagon
reporters Wednesday that U.S. authorities have been deeply involved
in investigating a ``serious'' technology diversion case.
   Bryen, the deputy undersecretary of defense for trade security
policy, refused at the time to identify the company under
investigation. He said only that American investigators were
receiving ``splendid cooperation'' in the matter; that some
individuals already had been charged and other arrests would
follow, and that he hoped to make more information available in a
few months.
   Other government sources then disclosed Wednesday the
investigation concerned a French company known as Forest Line that
once went by the name of Ratier-Forest, and that information was
subsequently acknowledged by Hoffman.
   ``The case ... involves a French company which is currently
under investigation by the French government,'' said Hoffman. ``The
company name is Forest Line.''
   The other sources, who insisted on anonymity, said U.S.
intelligence agents tipped the French early this year about alleged
Forest Line sales of heavy milling equipment to the Soviet Union.
   ``There has been good cooperation,'' said one source. ``We
shared information with them and they moved quickly.''
   The French case surfaced last spring but attracted little notice
then.
   French authorities disclosed in April that four people had been
arrested under anti-espionage laws, including Louis Tardy, chairman
of Machines Francaises Lourdes, and Jean-Paul Chamouton, president
of Forest Line.
   Machines Francaises Lourdes, now bankrupt, was the parent
company of Forest Line, which specialized in manufacturing heavy
tool equipment.
   No trials have been held, and the status of the cases is unclear.
   The Toshiba scandal came to a head earlier this year when the
Toshiba Machine Co., a majority-owned subsidiary, was found guilty
in a Japanese court of illegally trading high-tech items with the
Soviet Union. The firm was convicted of selling sophisticated
milling machines to the Soviet Union in the early 1980s. The
machines can be used to fashion quiet submarine propellers.
   U.S. military experts claim the Toshiba sale has complicated
dramatically the task of locating Russian subs.
   Bryen, while never naming the company now under investigation,
drew attention to the matter Wednesday when asked if the Pentagon
had become involved in any other major export probes since Toshiba.
   ``There's even a bigger one, but it's different,'' Bryen
replied. ``It's a different kind of case because, first of all,
we've had splendid cooperation on it. There's more, much more
involved than the Toshiba case.
   ``It's certainly serious and it's in a different field; it's in
the aerospace area,'' he said. ``It's under investigation and there
have already been some equivalent of U.S. indictments on the case,
in another country. There's going to be some others.
   ``But I'm going to be real cagey on this because I don't want to
spring it yet. But I think in the next few months we should be
prepared to describe it in more detail.''
   Asked if any American citizens were known to be involved, he
replied: ``Not that I know of at the moment.''
   The Toshiba incident helped lead to enactment of new trade
legislation and sanctions against that company in the United States
as well as a Japanese government overhaul of export licensing
procedures.
   Last fall, when revelations about the Toshiba case were
surfacing, a Norwegian police investigation found that several
European companies _ including Forest Line _ had conspired to
divert sensitive technology to the Soviets dating back to the 1970s.
   The U.S. sources said Wednesday, however, that the current
investigation involved equipment sales that continued at least
through 1986 and possibly 1987 _ long after the last Toshiba
transaction.
   ``That's what makes it serious,'' one source said.
   The Forest Line equipment, said to include huge milling
machinery that can be used to fabricate aircraft fuselages and jet
engine turbine blades, was allegedly sold to the Soviets after
corporate executives submitted fraudulent applications for export
licenses, the sources said.
   Bryen told reporters the Reagan administration has made great
strides in clamping down on the exports of sensitive military
technology to the East bloc and in convincing U.S. allies to do the
same.

<HEAD>Americans Sing for Success in Japan</HEAD>

<DATELINE>HONOLULU (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   If the thought of giving an after-dinner speech
makes you nervous, singing in a foreign language for prospective
clients might cause you to lose your appetite.
   Honolulu attorney Wallace Fujiyama did not like the idea, but
after socializing with Japanese clients, he realized American
business skills were not enough to assure success in Tokyo.
   He spoke Japanese, but, he says, he needed to learn to sing it.
   ``If you're going to succeed as a businessman, you have to do
business the way they do it, and in Japan, everybody sings,'' says
Fujiyama. ``Everybody from the ordinary salary worker to the
corporate presidents and executives.''
   The songfests usually begin after a business meeting or social
gathering, he says, when the company's executives take their turn
at the microphone singing popular Japanese tunes. After they are
finished, their guests, such as Fujiyama, are invited to give it a
go.
   ``For you to refuse is a great insult, but to sing badly is even
worse,'' he says.
   So Fujiyama began to practice, first by singing along in his car
with ``karaoke'' tapes, which are high-quality instrumental
versions of popular songs. Later, one of his Japanese clients gave
him with an elaborate sound system for his downtown Honolulu
office, complete with laser disk, two tape players and an oversized
video screen so he could watch his technique.
   A star was not quite born, but Fujiyama swears he is improving.
   ``I still don't want to sing out in public, but I've gotten
better. I can carry a tune now,'' he says.
   Fujiyama cannot explain the cultural differences that cause
Japanese _ young and old _ to sing at home along with variety shows
(which flash the lyrics on the television screen) and at
``karaoke'' bars with professional equipment, light shows and
audiences; while Americans tend to sing in their cars with the
windows rolled up and are relieved when they manage ``Happy
Birthday'' without embarrassing themselves.
   But Bill Feltz, who specializes in Japanese culture at the
East-West Center here, has some ideas.
   ``Japanese, as in many countries, are not as ashamed of singing
as we are in the United States,'' says Feltz, who as an
ethnomusicologist studies music of Asian cultures. ``There you're
not expected to sing like Bruce Springsteen or Beverly Sills.''
   In many Asian cultures, Feltz says, people have a common
repertoire and sing songs they learned as children for their entire
lives. In the United States, he said, more emphasis is put on the
quality, so elementary school students who once belted out ``My
country 'tis of thee....'' with abandon learn to be self-conscious
and clam up as they grow older.
   That's what happened to Adrian Mangiboyat, 32, who left his job
as a reporter for the Pacific Business News here to teach English
in a Japanese village.
   ``I guess I sang at school as a little kid, but I outgrew that.
I never sang along with the radio, in the shower, nothing like
that,'' he says. ``But when I applied for the job (in Japan) they
said singing was an integral part of Japanese culture, and I knew I
was in trouble.''
   Mangiboyat earned the teaching position in a program sponsored
by the Japanese government, but before he departed for
Yabuki-Machi, a small town 100 miles north of Tokyo, he enrolled at
the University of Hawaii.
   In a nine-week course called ``Voice Training for the Tone
Deaf,'' Mangiboyat and other would-be warblers spent two hours a
week learning scales, pitch and simple songs. Their homework
included taking the stage at a local ``karaoke'' bar popular with
Japanese tourists.
   ``The Japanese officials said being able to sing will give me an
edge with my students and the other villagers. It will show them
that I really tried to learn about their culture.''
   Fujiyama agrees.
   ``By asking you to sing with them, they're saying `let's be
friends.'''

<HEAD>West German Central Bank Raises Key Interest Rate</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FRANKFURT, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   West Germany's central bank
raised a key interest rate Thursday to defend the value of its
currency and fend off inflation, leading a round of rate hikes in
Europe.
   The Bundesbank raised its discount rate, which it charges on
loans to other banks, by half a percentage point to 3.5 percent.
   Karl Otto Poehl, president of the Bundesbank, cited the weakness
of the mark against the U.S. dollar as a main reason for lifting
the discount rate.
   The higher discount rate should cause other interest rates to
rise. That would support the exchange value of the mark by making
mark-denominated investments more attractive.
   The dollar eased more than a pfennig to level around 1.8650
marks soon after the Bundesbank's announcement.
   France, Great Britain, Switzerland, the Netherlands and Austria
followed the Bundesbank's lead and raised rates.
   ``Today's step is an important signal which will be understood
by the foreign exchange and capital markets,'' Poehl said.
   Poehl told reporters that the dollar's strength against the mark
endangered efforts to adjust trade imbalances between the world's
major trading partners.
   He also said the Bundesbank will ``continue to do everything to
stem the decline of the mark against the dollar.''
   Poehl also said the discount rate increase was aimed at curbing
inflation and bringing the country's above-target money supply
growth back into the proper range. The mark's weakness has
contributed to inflation by raising import prices.
   The Bundesbank decided to keep its Lombard rate steady at 5
percent, and indicated no change in its rate on securities
repurchase agreements.
   The Bundesbank has adjusted German interest rates upwards three
times in the past eight weeks. It raised the Lombard rate to 5
percent from 4.5 percent on July 28, following a hike in the
discount rate to 3 percent from 2.5 percent on June 30.

<HEAD>Stocks Fall on British Trade Deficit News</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: New throughout with closing index.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Stocks fell sharply Thursday following news of a
British trade deficit in July that was nearly double market
expectations and a subsequent hike in British interest rates.
   A sagging start on Wall Street also depressed share prices.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index fell 39
points, or 2.1 percent, to close at 1,780.2.
   Earlier in the afternoon, the index was down more than 50 points.
   Volume was a relatively strong 399.3 million shares by
midafternoon.
   Following the trade figure release, the Bank of England signaled
a 1 percentage point hike to 12 percent in the British commercial
banks' base lending rate.
   Britain's merchandise trade deficit spurted to a record 2.65
billion pounds, equivalent to $4.5 billion, in July, compared with
a revised shortfall of $1.54 billion in June.
   The country's current account deficit, which includes invisible
trade such as overseas investment earnings as well as merchandise
trade, spurted to 2.15 billion pounds in July, compared with a
revised deficit of 1.04 billion pounds in June.

<TEXT>
   The British government, trying to curb inflation,
on Thursday pushed up interest rates to a 2{-year high after
announcing a record trade deficit for July that was nearly double
the previous record.
   The July deficit and the interest-rate hike, both unexpectedly
large, rocked British financial markets.
   Share prices plummeted on the London Stock Exchange and trading
volume picked up. The British pound first fell on the trade news,
and then had a mixed reaction to the interest-rate hike.
   The British rate rise came amid a round of key interest-rate
increases in Western Europe. The Bundesbank, West Germany's central
bank, raised its discount rate by half a percentage point to 3.5
percent. The central banks of France, Switzerland, the Netherlands
and Austria followed the Bundesbank, hiking their own key rates.
   In London, the Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index,
which plunged more than 50 points before recovering some of its
losses, closed 39 points, or 2.1 percent, lower at 1,768.6, amid
moderate trading volume.
   The pound soared to $1.6995 late Thursday from $1.6788 late
Wednesday, but it fell to 3.16 West German marks from 3.17 marks.
   The Bank of England signaled a full percentage point increase in
the commercial banks' base lending rate to 12 percent, soon after
the Department of Trade and Industry reported that Britain's
merchandise trade deficit soared in July to a record 2.65 billion
pounds, or about $4.5 billion.
   The previous record trade gap was 1.7 billion pounds, or around
$2.9 billion, in May.
   Britain's four leading commercial banks _ Barclays Bank PLC,
Midland Bank PLC, Lloyds Bank PLC and National Westminster Bank PLC
_ quickly responded to the Bank of England's signal.
   Many market watchers had anticipated an increase of only half a
percentage point in the base lending rate.
   It was the eighth increase in the benchmark rate since early
June, when the rate stood at a 10-year low of 7.5 percent, and it
brought the base lending rate to its highest level since January
1986. The previous hikes were half-point increases, with the most
recent coming on Aug. 8.
   ``The import figures confirm that the economy has been growing
too fast. We have to slow it down and that means higher interest
rates,'' Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson said.
   Spurred by Britain's strong consumer spending, imports jumped 13
percent, across the board, to 9.43 billion pounds, or about $16
billion, in July, while exports fell 0.9 percent to 6.78 billion
pounds, or $11.5 billion.
   ``The government is determined to do whatever is necessary to
keep inflation under control,'' Lawson said in a British
Broadcasting Corp. radio interview. ``The economy as a whole is
doing extremely well,'' he added.
   The full-point interest-rate hike was viewed as a major
additional tightening of monetary policy to help reduce the growing
inflationary pressures in the economy. Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher has repeatedly said that reducing such pressures is her
top economic priority.
   Inflation in Britain increased to an annual rate of 4.8 percent
in July from 4.6 percent in June.
   A spate of recent economic reports has confirmed
faster-than-expected growth in the British economy.
   On Tuesday, for example, the goverment reported that Britain's
inflation-adjusted gross domestic product, measured by the output
of goods and services, rose 1.3 percent in the second quarter from
the first. The markets had expected a rise of only 1 percent.
   Recent weakness in the pound, exacerbated by the latest trade
report, has given the Thatcher government room to increase interest
rates without pushing the pound dangerously high, which would hurt
British exports even more.
   ``We now have a genuine balance-of-payments crisis. These
figures are appalling,'' said John Shepperd, director of the London
investment firm Warburg Securities, referring to the July trade
report.
   The latest trade deficit compared with a 1.02 billion pound, or
$1.7 billion, gap in July 1987.
   Britain's current-account deficit jumped to 2.15 billion pounds
in July, up from a revised deficit of 1.04 billion pounds in June
and a deficit of 323 million pounds in July 1987.
   The current account includes ``invisible'' trade, such as
services, foreign investment earnings and official transfer
payments, which was estimated to be in surplus by 500 million
pounds in July.

<HEAD>Grand AM Is No Typical 4-Cylinder</HEAD>
<HEAD>LaserPhoto and LaserGraphic</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ANN M. JOB</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>For The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It's not often that a compact car with a
four-cylinder engine can offer a decent sporty-car ride. But the
1988 Pontiac Grand AM SE is no typical four-cylinder compact.
   For starters, the standard 2-liter, fuel-injected engine is
turbocharged and can produce 165 horspower. Pontiac adds it can go
from 0 to 60 in a brisk eight seconds.
   The Grand AM SE's standard suspension package includes Goodyear
Eagle GT+4 all-season radial tires and stabilizer bars that make
for a firm, stable ride.
   Inside, there's a sporty feel with the thick, leather-wrapped
steering wheel, contoured front bucket seats _ molded to hold your
body in place _ and turbo boost gauge set amid a sporty driver area.
   Outside, the Grand AM SE is one of the prettiest of General
Motors Corp.'s cars, with bumpers and front, side and rear skirts
that match the body so there's no gaudy chrome.
   In fact, the styling, which debuted in the 1985 model year,
helps explain why the Grand AM is the Pontiac Division's volume
leader.
   From the buyer's perspective, it has snazzy styling, said
Pontiac spokesman Reggie Harris. Exterior styling and cost are the
two main reasons cited by buyers, he added.
   The lowest-priced Grand AM is $10,269, including $400 for
shipping, Harris said. But the SE test car totaled just under
$15,000.
   That $10,000-$15,000 price range encompasses many of the Grand
AM's competitors, such as the Buick Skylark and Dodge Lancer, which
start around $10,400, and the Honda Prelude, which starts around
$13,600.
   Harris noted the Grand AM _ which comes in three versions, the
Grand AM, the LE and the SE _ is particularly adept at luring young
buyers.
   Median age of buyers is 32, with 63 percent under age 35, Harris
said. Forty-even percent are male, 55 percent are married and 38
percent have college education. Median income is $40,000 annually.
   The test car, an SE, was fun to drive. The suspension and
engine, linked to a three-speed automatic transmission, offered
somewhat of a muscle-car ride complete with throaty rumble from
under the hood during hard accelerations.
   Handling was admirable, even at high speeds. There was no roll,
no sway.
   The trunk was roomy, and the rear seats split and folded down
for more storage space.
   There were nice touches inside for driver and passengers. Map
lights were available in front and rear.
   Front visors had slits in the material to slip paper, maps,
etc., and netting on the back of the front seats offered spots for
newspapers, magazines for rear-seat passengers.
   Controls for the AM-FM stereo and cassette player as well as
ventilation were conveniently located at the front of the center
console.
   Fit and finish inside and out was excellent.
   I noticed a few problems, too. At 5-foot-4, I found it difficult
to put the seat belt into its latch alongside the driver seat once
I had the seat moved up to where I could touch the pedals
comfortably.
   The seat belt latch was jammed between the driver seat and the
center console storage area. It was also difficult to unlatch the
belt without first moving the driver seat back a ways, for the same
reason.
   The Grand AM has a cruise control system found in many other GM
cars that is mounted on the turn signal stalk. As with the other GM
cars, I sometimes discovered the lever in the on position even when
the cruise wasn't actuated.
   Still, it's unsettling to glance down and see it on.
   Rear seating, for three, might be snug.
   The car also gulped down the gasoline. Fuel economy is rated at
20 miles per gallon in the city and 27 mpg on the highway, but in
my demanding city-highway driving I didn't get 20.
   Lastly, the center console had yellow spots that would light up
to indicate what gear the automatic transmission was in. But in
bright sunlight, it was murder trying to see what gear the shifter
had settled in.
   Consumer Reports says the 1986 Grand AM with four-cylinder
engine, the latest model it has information for, had an average
record for trouble, up from worse-han-average for the 1985 model.
Still, 1988 looks to be the best year for Grand AM yet, with
projections of 220,000 sales compared with 216,065 in the 1987
model year and 190,994 in the 1986 model year.
   We're in great shape for that car line, Harris said, noting
sales have been on target.
   He said even Mary Kay, the cosmetics company, has ordered a
fleet of 5,000 Grand AMs for its employees. But he quickly added
they won't be pink.

<HEAD>Aircraft Giant Breaks Record with Help From Swedish Order</HEAD>
<BYLINE>BY GEORGE TIBBITS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Boeing Commercial Airplane Co. today announced an
order for six 737-500 jetliners, which helped the aircraft
manufacturer break the industry record for new plane orders in a
single year.
   The order by Linjeflyg, a Swedish domestic airline, sent
Boeing's orders for the year to $20.7 billion for 466 planes,
breaking the Seattle-based company's own record of 461 orders set
in 1978.
   Linjeflyg's order, including spare parts, was valued at $175
million. The airline, a new customer for Boeing, also took out an
option for six more 737s. The twin-engine jet is designed to carry
108 passengers.
   John Hayhurst, vice president of marketing for Boeing Commercial
Airplanes, said the outlook for further strong orders for Boeing is
good.
   Boeing is predicting that airline traffic growth will grow by 5
percent a year through 2005, when it will be about 2{ times busier
than today, Hayhurst said.
   Future traffic growth translates into a need for 7,400 new
airplanes between now and 2005, said Hayhurst, who added Boeing is
well-positioned to get a good share of those orders.
   Both GPA Rolls Ltd., of Shannon, Ireland, and Delta Air Lines of
Atlanta have said they may be interested in ordering large numbers
of Boeing planes, possibly this year.
   ``With the possible order of up to 50 757s pending with GPA
Rolls, a Delta order and another possible 75 jets which could be
used in the Navy's long-range anti-submarine warfare patrol
aircraft program, Boeing could keep going like gangbusters,'' said
Paul Nisbet, an aerospace analyst with Prudential-Bache Securities
Inc. in New York.
   Chris Longridge, vice president of sales at Boeing Commercial
Airplanes, said today's order gives Boeing a commercial jet backlog
of 1,036.
   ``This is the highest backlog we have ever had at Boeing'' and
is the highest in the industry, Longridge said.
   Presently at its Renton, Wash. plant, Boeing is turning out 14
737s and four 757s every month. The production of 757s will
increase to five a month next February, Longridge said.
   At Boeing's Everett plant, five 767s are being produced a month
and three 747s, but plans are to boost that rate to five of the
jumbo jets by mid-1989, Longridge said.
   He declined to say whether these plans mean additional hiring at
Boeing.
   Boeing employment in the Puget Sound region currently stands at
about 92,000.

   Stock prices posted some broad losses today,
weighed down by worries about rising interest rates.
   The level of trading was up from the previous session, but was
still relatively sluggish.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which climbed 37.34
points on Wednesday, was down 26.31 to 2,000.36 with two hours left
in the session.
   Today's decline comes on the first anniversary of the Dow Jones
industrial average reaching its record close of 2,722.42 on Aug.
25, 1987.
   Declining issues outpaced gainers by a margin of nearly 11 to 3
among issues listed on the New York Stock Exchange, with 324 up,
1,071 down and 483 unchanged.
   Big Board volume amounted to 91.26 million shares at 2 p.m. on
Wall Street compared with 84.44 million shares at the same point
Wednesday.
   Analysts said stocks suffered from renewed interest rate worries.
   Before the U.S. stock market opened today, the West German
central bank raised a key lending rate and banks in several other
European countries followed suit.
   Analysts said the increase in European rates stirred speculation
that U.S. rates could also be headed higher. That hurt stocks
because higher rates could cut corporate profits and make
government notes and bonds more attractive.
   The U.S. government today revised upward its estimate of
second-quarter economic growth to 3.3 percent rate from 3.1 percent.
   Prices in the bond market moved lower, pushing interest rates
higher.
   The 30-year Treasury bond, for instance, was down about $6.25
for every $1,000 in face value, while its yield jumped to 9.46
percent from 9.40 percent late Wednesday.

<TEXT>
   Grain and soybean futures prices ended mixed to
slightly higher Thursday on the Chicago Board of Trade.
   Analysts described the day as ``featureless'' because few signs
of confirmation could be found for a pair of rumors that strongly
influenced trading one day earlier.
   Soybeans were pressured at the opening as speculation that China
was planning a big soyoil purchase under the U.S. export bonus
program failed to gain support. There was some firming up late,
however, as the beans closed mostly higher.
   Wheat climbed across the board on talk of increased export bonus
business, despite the fact that reports Wednesday of a completed
one-year extension of the grain accord between the Soviets and the
United States appear to have been premature.
   On the close, wheat was 2} cents to 4 cents higher, with the
contract for delivery in September at $3.93{ a bushel; corn was 4}
cents lower to 1{ cents higher, with September at $2.81 a bushel;
oats were 1 cent lower to { cent higher, with September at $2.54{;
and soybeans were 5 cents lower to 6 cents higher, with September
at $8.35 a bushel.

<HEAD>Nevada Casinos Report Revenue Gain</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CARSON CITY, Nev. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gamblers lost a record $4.07 billion in
Nevada casinos in fiscal 1988 to give the clubs a 9.8 percent
revenue gain over the previous year, a report released Thursday
found.
   Gaming Control Board spokesman Harlan Elges called the results
for the 12 months ended June 30 good, although he noted that 1987
revenue had been a bit higher, 10.2 percent, when compared with
1986.
   ``There are no downturns, nothing is slowing the casino industry
down at this point,'' Elges said.
   In the Las Vegas area, clubs grossed $2.83 billion, or about 70
percent of all winnings, up 10.2 percent from 1987, the board said.
In the Reno area, the take was $729.3 million, up 7.2 percent from
the prior year.
   In Douglas County, including clubs on Lake Tahoe's south shore,
resorts grossed $336.2 million, an 11.2 percent increase. And in
Elko County, resorts took in $94.7 million, up 13.3 percent.
   Carson City showed the only decrease, with the $36.5 million
taken in by clubs here reflecting a 2.2 percent decline in the
money won from gamblers the year before. That's a slight
improvement over fiscal 1987 revenues which were off 2.5 percent.

<HEAD>News Corp. Fourth Quarter Net Down 67.5 Percent</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   News Corp. Ltd., a vast communications
conglomerate with holdings that range from British newspapers to
the Fox Broadcasting Co., reported a 67.5 percent drop in
fourth-quarter earnings Thursday, attributing the results to Fox
startup costs and a big decline in asset sales.
   Excluding those factors, News Corp. said, its earnings rose 41
percent from the comparable period a year earlier.
   The company, based in Sydney, Australia, and controlled by
publishing-entertainment entrepreneur Rupert Murdoch, earned $128.1
million in the three months ended June 30, vs. $394.4 million a
year earlier.
   Earnings for the previous quarter and year were inflated by more
than $300 million in special gains, largely property sales.
   Earnings per share for the latest quarter, stated in American
Depositary Receipts listed on the New York Stock Exchange, were 82
cents vs. $2.61 a year earlier. An ADR represents two of the
company's ordinary shares.
   The company said fourth-quarter revenue totaled $1.2 billion, up
22.3 percent from $981.3 million.
   In a statement from its New York office, News Corp. based the
figures on what it called the average rates of exchange between
U.S. dollars and Australian dollars prevailing in each period.
   For the year, News Corp. said earnings totaled $341.27 million,
or $2.20 per ADR, a 37.3 percent decline from the $544.43 million,
or $3.72 per ADR, earned in fiscal 1987.
   Revenue totaled $4.35 billion, vs. $3.5 billion, a 24.2 percent
increase.
   News Corp. is a diversified international media and
entertainment company with primary interests in newspapers,
magazines, book publishing, movie and television production and
distribution, and commercial printing. Principal operations are in
Australia, the Pacific Basin, Britain and the United States.
   Besides Fox, which the company is attempting to build into the
fourth major U.S. network, News Corp.'s American holdings include
Metromedia TV stations and number of magazines and newspapers,
among them the Boston Herald American and San Antonio Express-News.
Most recently the company acquired Triangle Publications Inc.,
publisher of TV Guide and Seventeen, for $3 billion.

   Stock prices pulled back today after a big rise
in the previous session, as worries about rising interest rates
took a toll.
   But prices finished above the day's lows and trading remained
sluggish.

   Before the U.S. stock market opened today, the West German
central bank raised a key lending rate and banks in several other

higher.
   The 30-year Treasury bond, for instance, lost about $5 for every
$1,000 in face value, while its yield rose to 9.44 percent from
9.40 percent late Wednesday.
   Analysts said yields on shorter-term government issues were also
tempting investors to stay on the sidelines until the interest rate
outlook clarifies.

<HEAD>Farmers-Batus Agreement Ends Eight-Year Battle</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Farmers Insurance Group Inc.'s agreement to
be bought by Batus Inc. for $5.2 billion ends a bitter eight-month
battle that included unusual skirmishing over the evils of smoking
and investment in South Africa.
   Spokesmen for the Los Angeles insurer and the Louisville, Ky.,
tobacco and retailing conglomerate couldn't say Thursday just how
many lawsuits and administrative proceedings have been spawned by
their fight.
   But the merger deal, which was announced late Wednesday, calls
for the companies to cooperate in unraveling the tangle and
cooperating in pressing for approval of the purchase by insurance
regulators in various states.
   Farmers agreed to be bought by Batus for $75 a share, $3 a share
higher than Batus' highest previous publicly announced offer and
$12 more a share than Batus has been offering stockholders on the
market.
   No date has been set for a needed vote on the merger by
shareholders of Farmers, the nations' third-largest home and auto
insurer and seventh-biggest property and casualty insurer.
   Batus, the American subsidiary of BAT Industries PLC of Britain,
owns Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corp., maker of Kool, Viceroy and
other brands, Appleton Papers and retailiers including Sak's Fifth
Avenue and Marshall Field's.
   The deal requires the approval of insurance regulators in nine
of the states where Farmers does business, and hearings before
those regulators were the forum for the most acrimonious
accusations in the takover battle.
   Farmers representatives maintained that Batus, as a tobacco
producer, would end non-smoker discounts for Farmers policy
holders. When Batus vowed to continue the discounts, Farmers
suggested ownership by Batus would prevent it from crusading
against smoking as strongly as it has in the past.
   Farmers also lined up numerous local, state and national elected
officials to blast Batus' British parent, BAT Industries PLC, for
maintaining businesses in racially segregated South Africa.
   After the deal was cut, Batus Chairman Patrick Sheehy said the
earlier acrimony hadn't effected the week-long negotiations.
   ``I think often things that are said in court are much more
acrimonious than one's true feelings,'' Sheehy said in an interview.
   One or the other of the companies has challenged or threatened
to challenge the seven state regulatory decisions issued to date,
some in court and some in appeals to the regulators.
   By dropping various lawsuits and jointly appealing regulators'
decisions, the companies said, officials believe they can clear the
regulatory path to a merger as early as the end of the year.
   The merger won the approval of insurance regulators in Arizona,
and was given conditional approval in Ohio and Illinois. Idaho,
Washington and Oregon have rejected the deal and decisions or
hearings are pending in Texas and Kansas.
   California regulators rejected the merger, but that decision was
overturned by a state court.

   Insilco Corp. said Thursday it accepted a
$1.1 billion buyout offer from two Texas oilmen, tossing aside a
previous takeover agreement with a management-led group.
   Under the latest arrangement, INR Holdings Inc., headed by Cyril
Wagner Jr. and Jack E. Brown of Midland, Texas, will pay $31.75 in
cash for each of Insilco's outstanding 25.6 million shares.
Including debt, the deal has an indicated value of about $1.1
billion, Insilco said in a statement.
   In active trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Insilco closed
up $1.12{ a share Thursday to $31.12{.
   Two weeks ago, Insilco agreed to a management-led leveraged
buyout with First Boston Corp. But Insilco's board said Thursday
that it had withdrawn its support of the $29-a-share offer, which
valued the company at about $950 million.
   Dissenting shareholders last week filed lawsuits against
Insilco, charging that management's offer was too low.
   In a leveraged buyout a company is acquired largely through
borrowed funds that are repaid through the target company's profits
or asset sales.
   Anaylysts had said higher bids would increase the chance a buyer
would have to sell at least some divisions of Insilco to finance
the purchase.
   Once a leading silver operation known as International Silver
Co., Insilco restructured itself into an industrial holding company
and producer of specialty consumer and high technology products.
   Several subsidiaries have wide brand-name recognition, including
Rolodex desktop equipment, Red Devil paints and Taylor school
yearbooks.
   Insilco reported a flat overall earnings for the first half of
1988, $21.7 million, or $1.02 a share, vs. $21.5 million, or $1.02,
a year ago. But its profit from ongoing operations increased about
11 percent and sales rose almost 21 percent.
   Wagner and Brown are engaged in the exploration and production
of oil and natural gas, the operation of gas pipelines, real estate
development and other businesses.
   Earlier this year, the pair launched a hostile tender offer for
USG Corp., a Chicago-based building products concern. But Wagner
and Brown terminated their offer in June, a month after they lost a
bid for six seats on USG's board in a heated proxy contest.
   To finance the Insilco acquisition, INR Holdings said it has
obtained commitments totaling $980 million from Wagner, Brown and
Merrill Lynch & Co.
   The deal received the unanimous endorsement of a special
committee of outside directors, Insilco said. INR Holdings will
begin a cash tender offer within five business days of the
execution of a definitive merger agreement.

<HEAD>European Central Banks Raise Interest Rates</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARCY GORDON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   In the latest round of higher interest rates worldwide, the
central banks of Britain, West Germany and several other European
countries hiked their key rates Thursday.
   The actions rekindled fears of a global interest-rate spiral and
unnerved financial markets. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones average
of 30 industrial stocks, up 37.34 points on Wednesday, dropped
15.82 to 2,010.85.
   The European interest-rate hikes also had the intended effect of
knocking the dollar lower, especially against the West German mark.
The U.S. currency was quoted at around 1.8645 marks in late
afternoon trading in New York, down sharply from 1.8820 marks late
Wednesday.
   Some analysts believe the rate hikes by West Germany's
Bundesbank, the Bank of England and other European central banks
could prompt another sharp tightening of credit in the United
States _ where the Federal Reserve pushed rates higher only a few
weeks ago.
   ``There's some danger that we could get'' an increase in the
Fed's discount rate, said Robert Brusca, chief economist for
investment firm Nikko Securities Co. International Inc. ``The
dollar is really looking like it's made a turn for the worse.''
   Other experts, however, deem it unlikely that the Fed would take
such dramatic action again to raise rates so close to the
presidential election in November. Instead, they expect the central
bank to nudge rates gently higher by using its routine operations
in the money markets _ even if inflationary pressures heat up and
the dollar slumps.
   ``The farther we get along on this process of leapfrogging
(interest rates), the more reluctance starts to grow,'' said Hugh
Johnson, a senior vice president of First Albany Corp. ``In some
ways, it's like a poker game and everyone starts raising the ante _
and some people start dropping out.''
   In a surprise move Aug. 9, the U.S. central bank announced a
half-percentage point increase in its discount rate to combat
inflation. That put the fee the Fed charges member banks for
short-term loans at 6.5 percent, its highest level in more than two
years.
   It was the first rise in the key rate since September 1987 _ the
month preceding the stock market crash _ and sparked a half-point
increase in the U.S. prime lending rate to 10 percent.
   After the Fed increase, many market watchers believed it was
only a matter of time before the United States' major trading
partners responded in kind.
   ``We had been more or less anticipating'' a European rate rise,
said David Redding, an international economist for Bankers Trust
Co. ``It's more of a catch-up on the part of the foreigners.''
   The Bank of England signaled a full percentage point increase in
the British commercial banks' base lending rate to 12 percent,
following a government report on the country's trade deficit in
July.
   The report showed Britain's July trade gap soared 72 percent to
a record 2.65 billion pounds, or about $4.5 billion. British
Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson said the rate was boosted
to keep inflation under control.
   The Bundesbank raised its discount rate to 3.5 percent from 3
percent, citing the dollar's recent strength against the mark. The
central banks of France, Switzerland, the Netherlands and Austria
quickly followed suit with rate hikes.
   In Tokyo, however, a senior Bank of Japan official said there is
``absolutely no need to consider an adjustment in Japan's monetary
policy just because the Bundesbank and the Bank of England raised
their base rates.''
   While the increases may have been foreseen, experts did find
surprising the ferocity of the West Germans' verbal attack on the
dollar.
   Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl said the bank will
``continue to do everything to stem the decline of the mark against
the dollar.''
   Poehl's strident remarks seemed to overreach the February 1987
``Louvre'' agreement on the value of the dollar informally adopted
by the major industrial countries, Redding suggested.
   ``It makes you wonder about the coordination,'' he said. He
noted contrasting statements recently by U.S. officials indicating
that the dollar could rise a bit more before its advance would need
to be stemmed.

Report are for week ended Tuesday. All other figures are for the

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Assets of the nation's 449 money market mutual
funds rose $369.2 million in the latest week, the Investment
Company Institute said Thursday.
   The rise, to $269.06 billion in the seven-day period ended
Wednesday, followed a revised $3.13 billion increase in the funds'
assets the previous week, according to the Washington-based mutual
fund trade group.
   The funds' assets hit a record high $280.02 billion in the week
ended Feb. 24.
   The Investment Company Institute said that in the latest week,
assets of 221 general purpose funds rose $17.6 million to $85.37
billion, assets of 102 broker-dealer funds dropped $104.3 million
to $114.0 billion, and assets of 126 institutional funds rose
$455.9 million to $69.68 billion.
   The seven-day average yield on money market mutual funds rose in
the week ended Tuesday to 7.22 percent from 7.14 percent the
previous week, according to Donoghue's Money Fund Report, a trade
journal based in Holliston, Mass.
   The 30-day average yield rose, to 7.06 percent from 6.99
percent, Donoghue's said.
   The average maturity of the portfolios held by money funds was
33 days, down from 34 days, Donoghue's said.
   Separately, the newsletter Bank Rate Monitor said its survey of
100 leading commercial banks, savings and loan assocations and
savings banks in the nation's 10 largest markets showed the
effective annual yield available on money market accounts rose to
5.92 percent as of Wednesday from 5.87 percent a week earlier.
   The North Palm Beach, Fla.-based newsletter said the effective
annual yield available on special savings accounts, called Super
NOW accounts, was unchanged at 5.13 percent.
   Bank Rate Monitor said the effective annual yield was 7.58
percent on six-month certificates of deposit, up from 7.51 the
previous week. Yields were 7.89 percent on 1-year CDs, up from 7.82
percent; 8.18 percent on 2{-year CDs, up from 8.12 percent; and
8.50 percent on 5-year CDs, up from 8.45 percent.

   The dollar fell Thursday in heavy trading
sparked by a round of interest rate increases in Europe and a tough
statement from the head of West Germany's central bank.
   Gold prices were mixed. Republic National Bank of New York said
gold was bid at $432.60 a troy ounce as of 4 p.m. EDT, down from
$434.60 an ounce late Wednesday.
   West Germany's Bundesbank raised its discount rate by half a
percentage point to 3.5 percent to defend the value of the mark and
guard against the inflation that comes from having a weak currency.
   France, Switzerland, the Netherlands and Austria also raised
official rates, and Britain signaled an increase in commercial
rates.
   In a strongly worded statement, Bundesbank President Karl Otto
Poehl said the central bank ``will continue to do everything to
stem the decline of the Deutsche mark against the dollar.''
   Poehl said exchange rates had gotten out of line with those
agreed upon by the Group of Seven major industrialized nations and
added that ``it's not in the mutual interest if the current trend
continues.''
   The West German central bank continued to sell dollars in the
open market.
   ``The Germans have shown us pretty clearly that they really
haven't been happy with the mark at the level it's been,'' said
Derek Walker, an economist at Midland Bank PLC in London.
   Higher European rates make it more attractive to hold securities
denominated in the European currencies.
   But the dollar found some support from news that the second
quarter U.S. gross national product was revised upward to 3.3
percent growth from 3.1 percent.
   Traders said that the strong growth indicates that U.S. interest
rates may rise to match Thursday's increases in European rates.
   The dollar fell most sharply against the West German mark,
sinking to 1.8657 in late New York trading after briefly touching
as low as 1.8575. It closed at 1.8820 Wednesday and 1.9128 Tuesday,
meaning its two-day decline was about 2.5 percent.
   In London, the pound rose to $1.6995 from Wednesday's late
$1.6788. Later in New York, the pound rose to $1.6965 from $1.6869
late Wednesday.
   In Tokyo, where the business day ends before Europe's begins,
the dollar fell 0.54 yen to a closing 133.76 yen. Later, in London,
it was quoted at 133.30 yen. In New York, the dollar fell to 133.44
yen from 133.83 yen late Wednesday.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late
Wednesday's rates, included: 1.5705 Swiss francs, down from 1.5855;
1.2360 Canadian dollars, up from 1.2339; 6.3413 French francs, down
from 6.3960; 1,385.00 Italian lire, down from 1,396.50.
   Late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Wednesday's
rates: 1.8630 West German marks, down from 1.8915; 1.5715 Swiss
francs, down from 1.5950; 6.3275 French francs, down from 6.4250;
2.1030 Dutch guilders, down from 2.1370; 1,384.13 Italian lire,
down from 1,403.50; and 1.2342 Canadian dollars, up from 1.2321.
   In Hong Kong, gold rose $2.10 a troy ounce to close at a bid
$436.10.
   Gold fell in London to a late bid price of $433.50 an ounce,
compared with Wednesday's late bid of $433.90. In Zurich, gold
closed at a bid of $433.50 an ounce, unchanged from late
Wednesday's bid.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold bullion for current
delivery fell to $432.80 a troy ounce from $434.90 late Wednesday.
   Silver bullion prices fell on the London market. Silver was
trading at a late bid price of $6.77 a troy ounce, compared with
Wednesday's $6.81.
   On New York's Comex, silver bullion for current delivery fell to
$6.708 a troy ounce from $6.782 an ounce late Wednesday.

<HEAD>Stocks Retreat on First Anniversary of Dow Jones Industrial Peak</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Updates with closing prices throughout.</NOTE>

   The stock market retreated in sluggish trading
Thursday, as concerns about rising interest rates resurfaced on the
first anniversary of the all-time peak in the Dow Jones industrial
average.
   ``People's attitudes are not as positive as they were a year
ago,'' said Jack Garry, manager of institutional trading at the
brokerage Butcher & Singer Inc. in Philadelphia.
   A round of interest rate increases overseas and a new U.S.
economic report that contained an upward revision in one measure of
inflation for the second quarter were cited by analysts as reason
for the price slide.
   They said the combination stirred worries that U.S. interest
rates could be headed higher, making returns on Treasury securities
more competitive with those expected from stocks.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which climbed 37.34 on
Wednesday, lost 15.82 to close at 2,010.85. One year ago, the
market's best-known barometer had closed at 2,722.42, its record
high.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declines by more than 2 to 1 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
453 issues up, 998 down and 501 unchanged. The NYSE index fell 0.99
to 146.94.
   Volume on the floor of the NYSE came to 127.64 million shares,
compared with 127.80 million in the previous session. Nationwide,
consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trading at
regional exchanges and on the over-the-counter market, totaled
148.23 million shares.
   The market opened lower and the Dow Jones industrial average
extended its decline through midafternoon. The blue-chip index was
off 26.31 points at 2 p.m. before recovering some lost ground in
the last two hours of the session.
   Before the U.S. stock market opened, the West German central
bank raised a key lending rate and banks in several other European
countries followed suit.
   Also in advance of the opening, the Commerce Department revised
upward its estimate of second-quarter economic growth to 3.3
percent from 3.1 percent, and simultaneously boosted its estimate
of an inflation measure tied to the gross national product to show
a rise of 5.1 percent, up from 4.1 percent.
   Analysts said the combination of European rate hikes and the
revised inflation estimate stirred speculation that U.S. rates
could be headed higher. Investors expect that if the economy
continues to expand rapidly and inflation rises, the Federal
Reserve may encourage higher interest rates.
   Prices in the U.S. bond market slipped Thursday, nudging rates
up.
   The 30-year Treasury bond, for instance, lost about $5 for every
$1,000 in face value, while its yield rose to 9.45 percent from
9.40 percent Wednesday.
   Lawrence R. Helfand, manager of retail sales at Rodman & Renshaw
Inc. in Chicago, said the rising rates were offering ``some stiff
competition for the stock market.''
   He noted that yields on one-year Treasury bills are above 8.2
percent, and are proving attractive for investors looking for a
haven for their money in a volatile financial climate.
   ``We won't make much headway until there is a sign that higher
interest rates have begun to slow the economy,'' he said.
   Butcher & Singer's Garry said he expects trading to remain
sluggish until after the Labor Day holiday. ``We are in a drifting
pattern,'' he said.
   Northeast Utilities was the most active issue on the NYSE with
more than 12.1 million shares traded. It fell \ to 18}. Friday is
the deadline to qualify for the company's quarterly dividend.
   Insilco rose 1[ to 31[. The company's board approved a
$31.75-a-share buyout offer from two Texas oilmen.
   Among active blue-chip issues, International Business Machines
fell 1[ to 111|, Exxon slipped \ to 45}, American Express fell | to
28[ and General Electric edged up [ to 40[.
   In over-the-counter trading, Farmers Group rose } to 70. The
company agreed to a $75-a-share takeover offer from B.A.T.
Industries of Britain, but some obstacles remain to completing the
deal.
   The Wilshire Associates Equity Index, the market value of NYSE,
American and OTC issues, fell $16.52 billion, or 0.63 percent.
   Standard & Poor's industrial index fell 2.14 to 297.36, and
S&P's 500-stock composite index was off 1.95 to 259.18.
   At the American Stock Exchange, the market value index fell 0.85
to 293.21. The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter
market fell 1.99 to 374.04.

   The two broadest measures of the nation's money
supply fell in the week ended Aug. 15, the Federal Reserve Board
reported Thursday.
   The Fed said the measure known as M2 fell to a seasonally
adjusted $3,027.5 billion in that week, from $3,028.2 billion the
previous week.
   An even broader measure, M3, fell to 3,823.4 billion from
$3,825.2 billion.
   The narrowest measure of the money supply, M1, fell to $780
billion from $782 billion the previous week.
   M1 includes cash in circulation, deposits in checking accounts
and non-bank travelers checks. M2 is M1 plus accounts such as
savings deposits and money-market mutual funds. M3 is M2 plus
less-liquid accounts, such as certificates of deposit in minimum
denominations of $100,000.
   In judging monetary policy, the Fed has indicated it is
monitoring the value of the dollar, commodity prices and the
difference between short- and long-term interest rates. It also has
shifted attention from M1 to the two broader money supply measures
   For the latest 13 weeks, M1 averaged $778.1 billion, a 6.4
percent rate of gain from the previous 13 weeks, the Fed said,
although it has not set a specific target range for that figure
since early last year.
   In other reports:
   _The Federal Reserve Bank of New York reported commercial and
industrial loans at major New York City banks fell $1.16 billion in
the week ended Aug. 17, compared with a gain of $440 million the
previous week.
   _The Federal Reserve said bank borrowings from the Federal
Reserve System averaged $592 million a day in the week ended
Wednesday, up from $556 million the previous week.
   _The Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis reported that the
monetary base, the seasonally adjusted total of member bank
reserves held at Federal Reserve banks and cash in bank vaults and
in circulation, was $281.9 billion in the two-week period ended
Wednesday, up from $280.2 billion two weeks earlier.

<HEAD>Petroleum Futures Hurt by Reports of Overproduction, Iran-Iraq
Squabbling</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES LITKE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Petroleum futures prices fell broadly Thursday, plunging sharply
at times amid reports of overproduction by OPEC and renewed
saber-rattling between member nations Iran and Iraq.
   ``Instead of fighting on the battlefield, they seem to want to
fight in the press,'' said Jim Ritterbusch, vice president of
trading and research for Carson Petroleum Co. in suburban Chicago.
``And all that posturing just makes people nervous.''
   In other markets, copper futures prices extended recent gains as
demand remained strong, platinum joined gold and silver in a
precious metal decline, cocoa futures continued plunging, and grain
futures prices were mixed while soybeans were mostly higher.
   Petroleum futures came under pressure at the opening and moved
steadily lower as the market absorbed its first blow when a report
pegged production by members of the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries at between 19 million and 20 million barrels.
   A second blow came later in the day as Iranian oil minister
Khazempour Ardbelli was quoted as saying his nation would refuse
any attempt to allot Iraq to the same 2.36 million barrel-per-day
share of OPEC production granted Iran.
   Iraq has been outside OPEC production quotas since 1986, when it
claimed the economic drain of the Persian Gulf war with Iran
necessitated the extra production. Iraq's current output is
estimated at 2.6 million barrels per day.
   ``Iran calls Iraq `obstructionist' and it makes some people
edgy,'' said Ritterbusch.
   Crude oil prices on the New York Mercantile Exchange settled 34
to 41 cents lower, with the contract for delivery in October at
$15.31 per barrel; heating oil was 1.17 cents to 1.30 cents lower,
with September at 42.45 cents a gallon; and unleaded gasoline was 1
cent to 1.10 cents lower with September at 46.44 cents a gallon.
   Copper futures, meanwhile, were .55 cent to 1.65 cents higher at
the New York Commodity Exchange, with August at 102.35 cents a
pound.
   But the precious metals, which made some gains Wednesday,
retrenched Thursday.
   Platinum futures on the New York Mercantile Exchange slipped
$3.50 to $6.20, with October at $547.70 a troy ounce. At the New
York Commodity Exchange, gold dropped $2 to $2.20, with August at
$432.80 a troy ounce; silver lost 7.4 cents to 7.7 cents, with
August at 670.8 cents a troy ounce.
   Cocoa futures took another beating as traders, already unnerved
by the size of the worldwide surplus, left the market after rumors
that the Ivory Coast, the world's leading producer, was back
selling after a long absence.
   ``People who held long positions just bailed out because they
aren't seeing any turnaround,'' said Arthur Stevenson of
Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. in New York. ``The Ivory Coast
rumors, if true, would be very, very negative.''
   Cocoa futures settled $33 to $45 lower on the New York Coffee,
Sugar and Cocoa Exchange, with September at $1,303 per ton.
   Grain futures prices were mixed while soybeans were mostly
higher at the Chicago Board of Trade.
   On the close, wheat was 2\ cents to 4 cents higher, with the
contract for delivery in September at $3.93 a bushel; corn was 4
cents lower to 2} cents higher, with September at $2.80} a bushel;
oats were unchanged to 1 cent lower, with September at $2.54; and
soybeans were 5 cents lower to 5\ cents higher, with September at
$8.35{ a bushel.
   Livestock and meat futures finished mixed to mostly higher at
the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Live cattle settled .02 cent lower .80 cent higher, with October
at 72.10 cents a pound; feeder cattle were unchanged to .83 cent
higher, with August at 81.80 cents a pound; live hogs were .10 cent
lower to .62 cent higher, with October at 40.85 cents a pound; and
frozen pork bellies were .60 cent to 1.20 cents higher, with
February at 55.15 cents a pound.

<HEAD>Bond Prices Skid on GNP Report, Overseas Interest Rate Hikes</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bond prices slumped Thursday after a round of
interest rate hikes overseas and a government report that inflation
accelerated during the second quarter.
   The Treasury's bellwether 30-year bond fell 17-32 point, or
about $5.30 for every $1,000 in face amount.
   Its yield, which moves inversely to its price and is an
indicator of interest rate trends, rose to 9.45 percent from 9.40
percent late Wednesday.
   The central banks of Britain, West Germany and several other
European countries raised key interest rates Thursday in response
to the dollar's recent strength.
   The coordinated steps pushed the dollar downward, and set a
negative tone as trading opened in the bond market, said Elizabeth
G. Reiners, vice president for money market research at the
investment firm Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.
   The Federal Reserve recently raised its discount rate, the
interest it charges its member banks, and traders feared the
overseas rate hikes might prompt the Fed to increase the rate
again. That would force bond prices lower.
   The bond market was dealt a bigger blow, however, when the
Commerce Department issued its revised gross national product
figures for the second quarter.
   The department said the economy expanded at a robust annual rate
of 3.3 percent from April through June despite the severe impact of
the drought on farm production. That was up from an earlier
estimate of 3.1 percent.
   What hurt bonds was a GNP price index, which rose at an annual
rate of 5.1 percent during the quarter, the sharpest increase since
a 5.8 percent rise in the third quarter of 1982.
   The 30-year Treasury issue fell nearly a point on the news, Mrs.
Reiners said. The market has been sensitive to reports about
inflation because the Federal Reserve has tightened credit in an
attempt at keeping inflation in check.
   Prices recovered, however, as traders had second thoughts about
the GNP report, Mrs. Reiners said.
   ``Most people realize it's second quarter data, only through
June,'' she said. And with the recent interest rate hikes in this
country, ``possibly there'll be some abatement in the economy,''
she said.
   In the secondary market for Treasury securities, prices of
short-term government issues were [ point to 7-32 point lower,
intermediate maturities ranged 9-32 point to ] point lower, and
20-year issues were 13-32 point lower, according to figures
provided by Telerate Inc., a financial information service.
   The movement of a point is equivalent to a change of $10 in the
price of a bond with a $1,000 face value.
   The Shearson Lehman Daily Treasury Bond Index, which measures
price movements on all outstanding Treasury issues with maturities
of a year or longer, fell 2.66 to 1,123.07.
   Corporate bonds also were down. Moody's Investment Grade
Corporate Bond Index, which measures price movements on 80
corporate bonds with maturities of five years or longer, was down
0.60 to 281.51.
   Municipal bonds slipped as well. The Bond Buyer Municipal Bond
Index slipped 7-32 point to 88 16-32, while its yield rose to 8.16
percent from late Wednesday's 8.14 percent.
   Yields on Treasury bills moved higher. Three-month bills rose 3
basis points to a discounted rate of 7.28 percent and a yield of
7.51 percent. Six-month bills were up 3 basis points to a
discounted rate of 7.48 percent to yield 7.87 percent, and one-year
bills rose 4 basis points to a discounted rate of 7.71 percent and
a yield of 8.27 percent.
   A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. The yield
is the annualized return on an investment in a Treasury bill. The
discounted rate is the interest rate the market uses to price bills.
   The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between
banks, was quoted at 8\ percent, up from 7 13-16 percent late
Wednesday.

<HEAD>Former Coke Bottler Sentenced To Six Months In Price-Fixing
Conspiracy</HEAD>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NORFOLK, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A prominent Maryland entrepreneur and the
former president of The Seven-Up Co. each were sentenced to the
maximum three years in prison and fined $100,000 Thursday for their
part in a price-fixing conspiracy.
   Morton M. Lapides, 57, chairman of the board of Alleghany
Beverage Corp. of Cheverly, Md., and James J. Harford, former
president of Mid-Atlantic Coca-Cola Bottling of Silver Spring, Md.,
were convicted in May following a six-week trial.
   U.S. District Judge Robert G. Doumar suspended all but 179 days
of Lapides' sentence and all but six months of Harford's sentence.
Doumar also placed both men on three years' probation after the
completion of their sentence, with each required to perform
community service during that period.
   Harford has appealed his conviction and Lapides is expected to
do so.
   The federal jury had found that Harford, Alleghany Bottling and
Lapides, as head of Alleghany Bottling's parent company, conspired
to fix the wholesale price of Coke and Pepsi-Cola products.
   Sentencing for the corporation will continue Friday, and Doumar
said proceedings could take several days.
   When convicted, Harford was the president of Seven-Up, but
resigned that post three days later. Harford's conviction was the
result of actions while heading the Coca-Cola bottling firm and did
not involve Seven-Up.
   The convictions were part of an on-going Justice Department
probe of the soft drink industry, which has resulted in 11 grand
jury investigations in eight other states.
   Lapides and Harford were convicted of rigging the wholesale
price of their respective products in 1983 and 1984. Alleghany
Beverage was the parent company of Alleghany Pepsi-Cola Bottling
Co. until 1985 when Lapides sold the subsidiary for $160 million.
   During the trial, the defense contended neither man knew of the
scheme and that if the allegations were true it was the work of
lower level employees who made decisions without their bosses'
knowledge.
   Federal prosecutors argued the two bottlers reached an accord to
halt the previous bitter competition by fixing the wholesale price
of their products sold to schools, motels, hotels, and other
commercial buyers in Maryland and Virginia.
   Mid-Atlantic pleaded guilty to earlier, similar indictments and
agreed to pay $2 million in fines for price rigging in Virginia and
Washington, D.C., markets.
   In March, both bottling firms also agreed to rebate $45,000 to
Virginia to be distributed to school districts for overcharges on
their soft drink purchases. The agreement drawn up by Attorney
General Mary Sue Terry called for Mid-Atlantic to pay $30,000 and
Alleghany $15,000.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney David C. Jordan had argued Harford be
given the maximum sentence because ``he is the highest culpable
official at Mid-Atlantic.
   ``We should not allow this case with such tremendous damage to
the public to be a source of cynicism to the public'' by giving
Harford a light sentence, he said.
   During the hearing, Doumar said he had received numerous letters
from friends, relatives and business associates on Harford's
outstanding achievements in the community.
   In his sentencing, the judge commended Harford for his work in
the community, and for his persistent urging of Coca-Cola to become
more involved.
   ``Your company did a lot of good for the community through your
urgings, but you were being charitible to the public with money you
took from the public,'' he said.
   Prior to the conviction, several other soft drink executives
have been found guilty or pleaded guilty to a variety of charges.
   In February 1987, Armand S. Gravely, a former Richmond division
manager for Alleghany, was convicted of price fixing and
obstruction of justice. He was sentenced to four months in jail and
fined $15,000.
   Edward L. Wynns, a Mid-Atlantic vice president, pleaded guilty
in May 1987 to charges he lied to the grand jury investigating the
price fixing.
   The former president of Alleghany Bottling, James P. Sheridan of
Timonium, Md., was given a 3-year sentence, with all but 120 days
suspended, and fined $45,000 in August 1987 after pleading guilty
to price fixing.
   A third executive indicted along with Lapides and Harford, Odis
R. Allen, a Mid-Atlantic vice president, pleaded guilty to price
fixing in March.

   Sales of existing single-family homes, jolted
by rising mortgage rates, dropped 5 percent in July, the first
decline since January, a real estate trade group said Thursday.
   The National Association of Realtors said that sales of existing
homes dropped to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 3.63 million
units last month, following a 6.4 percent increase in June.
   The decline was the first since a 4.8 percent drop in January
with analysts blaming the setback on rising mortgage rates.
Fixed-rate mortgages climbed to a nationwide average of 10.5
percent at the end of July and have risen even faster in August,
topping 10.71 percent last week.
   John Tuccillo, chief economist for the Realtors, said even with
the July drop in demand, sales were still at the second highest
monthly level of the past year.
   ``Even with the recent and prospective increases in interest
rates, sales in 1988 will almost certainly be higher than we
anticipated at the beginning of the year,'' he said.
   The median price of a home rose from June to July by $1,400 to
$91,600, up 3.7 percent from a year ago, when the median sales
price for an existing home was $88,300.
   For the first time in a decade, the Midwest led in
year-over-year price changes, with an increase of 7 percent to a
median price of $70,600. The Northeast remained the highest-priced
region of the country, with a median price of $146,700 last month,
up just 0.6 percent from a year ago.
   The median price in the West was $123,500 last month, 4.2
percent higher than a year ago, while the median price in the South
of $85,600 was 5.7 percent higher than a year ago.
   Tuccillo said that the big jump in home prices in the Midwest
reflected a rebound in the region's rust belt industries because of
the boom in manufacturing caused by rising export sales. He said
the smaller price increase for the Northeast reflected some
softening in demand after two years of strong sales.
   All regions of the country except the West suffered sales
declines in July.
   The sharpest decline occurred in the South, where sales were
down 7 percent in July to an annual rate of 1.32 million units. In
the Northeast sales dropped 6.8 percent to an annual rate of
690,000 units while sales in the Midwest fell by 5.1 percent in
July, compared to June, but were 4.4 percent higher than a year ago.
   The West saw sales rise 3.2 percent to an annual rate of 690,000
units in July.

<HEAD>Expert: Recent Rains Limit Damage To Christmas Tree Industry</HEAD>

   Recent rains have Michigan tree
growers dreaming of a green Christmas.
   The drought killed more than 10 million seedlings in Michigan,
but the rains should help keep Christmas tree prices about the same
as last year, said Melvin Koelling, a forestry professor at
Michigan State University.
   ``From the consumer standpoint, I don't expect a change in
quality, quantity or price this year,'' Koelling said Thursday.
``Retailers shouldn't use the drought as justification for price
increases.''
   Koelling said Michigan is the nation's biggest producer of
Christmas trees, followed by Oregon and Wisconsin. Michigan
produced 55 million Christmas trees in 1987, and should be at or
above that level this year, depending on demand.
   Millions of trees have been spared from drought damage since
rains began in mid-July, Koelling said.
   ``Those rains came exactly when they had to come,'' Koelling
said. ``We would have lost a significant number of large trees
without the rains.''
   Many trees up to 6 years old died, he said. Most Christmas trees
are harvested after about 10 years' growth.
   Scotch pines, the mainstay of Michigan's Christmas tree crop,
have fared better than fir trees, Koelling said.

<HEAD>Woodworkers Union Ratifies Simpson Pact</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Woodworkers at three Simpson Timber Co.
mills in Washington and California have ratified a new labor
agreement, ending a strike that began June 24, union leaders said
Thursday.
   The agreement covering 1,300 workers is similar to contracts
ratified earlier by woodworkers at Willamette Industries and Boise
Cascade Corp., making Simpson the region's third timber company to
end a summer walkout by settling with its union.
   Chuck Macrae, a vice president of the International Woodworkers
of America-U.S., said picket lines came down immediately after the
vote was counted Thursday.
   The 800 Simpson employees at Shelton, Wash., and 500 at northern
California mills at Arcata and Korbel will begin returning to work
immediately, said Simpson spokesman Jim Hartley.
   Like the Willamette and Boise settlements, the Simpson deal
includes a $1,400 signing bonus, plus wage increases of 3 percent
next year, 4 percent in 1990 and 4 percent in 1991.
   Simpson woodworkers also got a new productivity-based incentive
plan. Simpson's logging crews have had successful productivity
incentive plans for two years, Hartley said.
   The Simpson walkout was part of a larger regional timber strike
that began June 6 and eventually affected about 7,900 workers in
five states.
   About 3,400 workers remain on strike at mills operated by
Champion International Corp., DAW Forest Products Inc., WI Forest
Products Inc., Lakeview Lumber Co. and Morgan Products Ltd.
   As negotiations began this year, workers demanded restoration of
wages and benefits cut two years ago when the companies were
struggling to get out of an industry-wide recession. The industry
wanted to limit raises to bonuses, avoiding costly increases in
basic wage rates.
   Champion International officials say local issues have been
resolved at all but two of their six struck Pacific Northwest
plants.
   Once the local issues are settled, Champion International
representatives want to meet with union leaders to negotiate
remaining economic issues, they said Wednesday.
   Some 2,400 Champion workers have been affected by the strike,
including 450 at a plant in Roseburg.
   Results still are pending from ratification votes being taken
this week on tentative agreements affecting 1,200 non-striking
workers at Georgia-Pacific Corp. mills in Oregon and California.
   Union leaders expected to complete the Georgia-Pacific tally by
Monday.
